Cis-UCA has been demonstrated to initiate suppression of selected immune responses in several experimental systems. Topical application of UCA-containing products reduces UV-induced erythema, but a role for endogenous UCA in photoprotection has not been reported. In this study the relationship between UCA isomers, pigmentation, minimal erythema dose (MED), and stratum corneum thickness was investigated. Pigmentation, concentration of total UCA, and the percentage present as the cis-isomer was measured in 36 healthy subjects, skin type I-IV, at six UV-exposed and nonexposed body sites: forehead, chest, back, outer upper arm, inner upper arm, and buttock. The MED was determined by phototesting on buttock skin, and a punch biopsy for measurement of stratum corneum thickness was taken adjacent to the site of the phototest. The percentage of cis-UCA was significantly higher in UV-exposed than on nonexposed areas. A small intraindividual variation in total UCA was found, being high on the buttock and the arm, lowest on the forehead. The subject to subject variation of total UCA was considerable at all body sites. No correlation was found between total UCA and MED, skin type, pigmentation, or stratum corneum thickness.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22341270>Antitumor effects of cis- on experimental urothelial cell carcinoma of the bladder.</a></h2><p>We determined the effect of protodynamic therapy against bladder cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. We investigated cis- in rat bladder cancer cell cultures and in an orthotopic rat urothelial carcinoma model to assess its safety and antiproliferative activity.The rat bladder cancer cell line AY-27 was exposed to cis- (BioCis Pharma, Turku, Finland) at pH 6.5 or 7.4 for 2 hours. Cell viability was measured by colorimetric assay at 24 and 48 hours. For in vivo experiments AY-27 cells were instilled into the  treated bladder of 17 rats. After 4, 7 and 10 days 14 rats were treated intravesically with cis- 6% (weight per volume) or vehicle. Rats were sacrificed on day 12 and the bladders were dissected. Immunohistochemical staining was done to assess apoptosis (caspase-3) and cell proliferation (Ki-67) in vivo.Cis- caused dose dependent, pH dependent inhibition of AY-27 cell proliferation, showing the protodynamic action at concentrations of 0.5% and 1%. At higher cis- doses complete cell death was observed. All tumors detected in animals treated with vehicle were muscle invasive (stage T2 or greater) but only 43% of tumors were muscle invasive in the cis- treated group (p=0.049). There was no difference in the percent of apoptotic or proliferating tumor cells between treatment groups. No signs of toxicity were observed.Cis- showed direct antiproliferative activity against rat bladder cancer cells in vitro and antitumor effects in vivo.

Hyaluronic  (HA) was used as a comparator compound.Bladder irritation was induced in female rats by intravesical hydrochloric  (HCl) infusion. Vehicle, 0.5% HA, or 2% cis-UCA solutions were infused intravesically twice a day for three consequent days. On the fourth day, urodynamical measurements were performed, the animals were sacrificed, and the bladders were removed for histopathological assessment.HCl treatment caused significant impairment of bladder function indicated by decreased micturition intervals and voided urine volumes and induced severe voiding dysfunction observed as occurrence of overflow incontinence. These functional changes were accompanied by increased bladder weight, hemorrhage, and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the urothelium. Intravesical cis-UCA treatment recovered bladder function by significantly prolonging the micturition interval, increasing the voided volume, and reducing the occurrence of overflow incontinence. All these changes were comparable to the effects of HA.Intravesical administration of cis-UCA was able to partially recover bladder function impaired by chemical irritation. Cis-UCA may offer a novel intravesical treatment option in some inflammatory conditions of the bladder. Neurourol.

By this action, N-formyl-L-glutamate (FG) is hydrolyzed to produce L-glutamate plus formate. Urocanate, the first product in the pathway, induced all five enzymes, but FG was able to induce FGase alone, although less efficiently than urocanate did. This induction by FG resulted in the formation of an FGase with electrophoretic mobility identical to that of the FGase induced by urocanate. A 9.6-kilobase-pair HindIII DNA fragment containing the P. putida FGase gene was cloned into the corresponding site on plasmid pBEU1 maintained in Escherichia coli. Insertion of the fragment in either orientation on the vector resulted in expression, but a higher level was noted in one direction, suggesting that the FGase gene can be expressed from either of two vector promoters with different efficiencies or from a single vector promoter in addition to a less efficient Pseudomonas promoter. FGase was purified 1,110-fold from the higher-expression clone in a yield of 10% through six steps. Divalent metal ions stimulated activity, and among those tested (Co, Fe, Zn, Ca, Ni, Cd, Mn, and Mg), Co(II) was the best activator, followed by Fe(II). FGase exhibited a Km of 14 mM for FG and a specific activity of 100 mumol/min per mg of protein in the presence of 5 mM substrate and 0.8 mM CoCl2 at 30 degrees C. The enzyme was maximally active in the range of pH 7 to 8. FGase was found to be a monomer of molecular  50,000. N-Acetyl-L-glutamate was not a substrate for the enzyme, but both it and N-formyl-L-aspartate were competitive inhibitors of formylglutamate hydrolysis, exhibiting Ki values of 6 and 9 mM, respectively. The absence of FGase activity as an integral part of histidine breakdown in most other organisms and the somewhat uncoordinated regulation of FGase synthesis with that of the other hut enzymes in Pseudomonas suggest that the gene encoding its synthesis may have evolved separately from the remaining hut genes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8818884>Further studies on biochemical characteristics and serologic properties of the genus Aeromonas.</a></h2><p>We characterized a collection of 268 Aeromonas isolates from diverse sources (clinical, animal, and environmental sources) for their species and serogroup designations. Overall, 97% of these strains could be identified to the genomospecies level by using an expanded battery of biochemical tests. Members of the Aeromonas hydrophila complex (A. hydrophila, HG2, and A. salmonicida), a group that has previously been difficult to separate biochemically, could easily be distinguished from one another by using a number of recently described phenotypic properties which included utilization of DL-lactate and . Differences in species distributions on the basis of the source of isolation were noted. Serogroup analysis of these 268 isolates plus a number of reference cultures indicated that (i) each genomospecies is serologically heterogeneous and individual serogroups can be found in more than one species, (ii) most type or reference strains for each hybridization group are not serologically representative of the genomospecies at large, (iii) serogroups O:11, O:34, and O:16 predominate clinically (48%), supporting previous studies indicating their importance in human infections, and (iv) most A. trota strains do not express the O139 antigen of Vibrio cholerae. The collective results suggest that both species and serogroup designations are important factors in establishing which isolates can cause human infections when they are acquired from nonclinical sources (foods, animals, and the environment).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24049652>Anti-inflammatory effects of  derivatives in models ex vivo and in vivo of inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p> (UCA) derivatives were tested for their anti-inflammatory activity in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in two models: ex vivo and an experimental mouse model. Ex vivo: inflamed colonic tissue was incubated in culture medium with or without the UCA derivatives. Biopsies, incubated with UCA derivatives, produced lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 as compared to control biopsies. The same compounds also showed increased levels of IL-10, providing an additional indication for anti-inflammatory properties. In vivo: a combination of two imidazoles and a combination of two of their ethyl esters were administered to mice while colitis was induced by oral administration of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Some parameters did not show conclusive effects, but the imidazoles and their ethyl esters reduced the area of inflammation and the number of infiltrating neutrophils. Fibrosis and the sum of all histological aspects were reduced by the imidazoles, whereas the ethyl esters reduced the colon  to length ratio. These results suggest that the UCA derivatives have anti-inflammatory effect on IBD. In addition, fine tuning of the ex vivo model may provide an elegant way to predict anti-inflammatory effects of potential drugs in humans, which may decrease the need for animal experiments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9349842>Dietary L-histidine regulates murine skin levels of trans-, an immune-regulating photoreceptor, with an unanticipated modulation: potential relevance to skin cancer.</a></h2><p>Solar ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB; 290-320 nm) causes skin cancer and suppresses cell-mediated immunity, preventing the rejection of UV-induced tumors. One mechanism initiating UV suppression involves the trans to cis photoisomerization of  (UCA), a histidine derivative found in the stratum corneum. The addition of L-histidine to nonpurified mouse diet has been shown to increase skin trans-UCA levels and sensitivity to UVB immune suppression. Specially formulated L-histidine diets (0.40-64 g/kg) fed to BALB/c mice that were monitored over a 19-wk period resulted in an unexpected modulation of skin trans-UCA. ANOVA revealed a group-time interaction, providing initial evidence that the skin levels of trans-UCA were modulating up and down in all groups except the control group (6.4 g/kg diet). We observed that both high (64 g/kg diet) and low (0.4 g/kg diet) levels of dietary L-histidine resulted in the increase of skin trans-UCA to levels significantly higher than those recorded in the control group. In mice fed these histidine levels, skin trans-UCA increased to between 2.9 and 3.6 nmol/mg skin (64 g/kg diet, over 5 wk; 0.4 g/kg diet, over 8 wk) and then decreased to approximately 1.69 nmol/mg skin, the base-line level (64 g/kg diet, over 11 wk; 0.4 g/kg diet, over 17 wk). The increase in trans-UCA levels in mice with low L-histidine intake may be the result of protein malnutrition, consistent with weight loss observed in those mice. The modulation of trans-UCA levels in skin by dietary L-histidine has not been previously described; its role in skin cancer development is under investigation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8310001>A garlic extract protects from ultraviolet B (280-320 nm) radiation-induced suppression of contact hypersensitivity.</a></h2><p>Lyophilized aged garlic extract has been incorporated at concentrations of 0.1%, 1% and 4% by  into semipurified powdered diets and fed to hairless mice. Under moderate UVB exposure conditions resulting in 58% suppression of the systemic contact hypersensitivity response in control-fed mice, a dose-responsive protection was observed in the garlic-fed mice; contact hypersensitivity in the UVB-exposed mice fed 4% garlic extract was suppressed by only 19%. If the UVB exposure was replaced by topical application of one of a series of lotions containing increasing concentrations of cis-, a dose-responsive suppression of contact hypersensitivity was demonstrated in control-fed mice ( at 25, 50, 100 and 200 micrograms per mouse resulting in 22-46% suppression). Mice fed a diet containing 1% aged garlic extract were partially protected from cis--induced suppression of contact hypersensitivity, with greater protection from the lower concentrations of . Mice fed a diet containing 4% aged garlic extract were protected from all concentrations of . The results indicate that aged garlic extract contains ingredient(s) that protect from UVB-induced suppression of contact hypersensitivity and suggest that the mechanism of protection is by antagonism of the cis- mediation of this form of immunosuppression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2120224>Cloning and expression of rat histidase. Homology to two bacterial histidases and four phenylalanine ammonia-lyases.</a></h2><p>Histidase (histidine ammonia-lyase, EC 4.3.1.3) catalyzes the deamination of histidine to . Apart from phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, which is not expressed in animals, histidase is the only enzyme known to have a dehydroalanine residue in its active site. The amino site precursor and the mechanism of formation of dehydroalanine are not known. As an initial step to determining the precursor of dehydroalanine in histidase, we have isolated a functional cDNA clone for histidase from a rat liver cDNA library using an affinity-purified antiserum. The 2.2-kilobase cDNA has a 1,971-base pair open reading frame coding for a 657-amino  polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 72,165 Da. The cDNA has a rare polyadenylation signal (AAUACA) that appears to inefficiently direct polyadenylation in transfected COS monkey kidney cells. Conversion of this sequence to the consensus polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA) resulted in increased levels of stable mRNA. COS cells transfected with a histidase expression vector produce active histidase. The formation of active histidase in cells that have no endogenous histidase activity suggests either that the requisite modifying enzyme is present in these cells or that the dehydroalanine residue forms by an autocatalytic mechanism. Rat histidase was found to have 41 and 43% amino  identity to Pseudomonas putida and Bacillus subtilis histidases, respectively. Phenylalanine ammonia-lyases from parsley, kidney bean, and two yeast strains were also found to have approximately 20% amino  identity to rat histidase. On the basis of the similarity of function of histidase and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, dehydroalanine at the active sites, and the sequence conservation over a large evolutionary distance (mammals, bacteria, yeast, and plants), we propose that the genes for histidase and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase have diverged from a common ancestral gene, of which the most conserved regions are likely to be involved in catalysis or dehydroalanine formation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2852797>Quantification of  isomers in murine skin during development and after irradiation with UVB light.</a></h2><p> has been postulated as the photoreceptor mediator of immunosuppression induced by ultraviolet-B (UVB) irradiation. We have shown previously that transplanted epidermal cells from neonatal mice, irradiated mice or mice skin painted with cis- suppress the immune responses to herpes simplex virus. Dorsal skin from foetal mice at 3 weeks gestation and from neonatal mice within 1 day of birth were assayed for the presence of cis- and trans- and compared with the amounts in the ears of 2, 4, 6 and 8-week old mice. Foetal mice had a low skin  content (11.9 ng/mg wet ), neonatal mice 227 ng/mg, while the other ages had at least 340 ng/mg. Neonatal mice were found to have 11.4%  as the cis-isomer, whereas foetal mice had undetectable amounts and all remaining ages had about 4%. Irradiation of 7-week-old mice with 96 mJ/cm2 UVB light resulted in the presence within the ears of 31.1%  as the cis-isomer. This level was maintained for at least 16 h, then declined slowly until, after 7 days, 16.2% was in the cis-form. Nonirradiated ears contained 4.7% cis-isomer. It is known that UVB irradiation of mice suppresses the delayed type hypersensitivity response to HSV. The suppression was found to be dependent on the time interval between irradiation and infection with virus; this had to be longer than 5 h and less than 14 days.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15677>The enzymatic conversion of L-histidine to  by whole cells of Micrococcus luteus immobilized on carbodiimide activated carboxymethylcellulose.</a></h2><p>Whole cells of Micrococcus luteus (formerly Sarcina lutea ATCC 9341) have been covalently linked to a carboxymethylcellulose support system, with the retention of histidine ammonia-lyase activity.

The specific activity of the pure enzyme (63 mumol of  min-1 mg-1) is similar to those so far reported for the enzyme from other sources. The purified enzyme appeared to be homogeneous by analytical disc electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing (pI = 4.95). The molecular  determined by Sephadex G-200 gel filtration is 200000. The optimum pH is 8.2, and the optimum temperature is 50 degrees C. The enzyme showed strict specificity to L-histidine (Km = 3.6 mM). Several histidine derivatives are not susceptible to the enzyme but do inhibit the enzyme activity competitively; the most effective inhibitors are L-histidine methyl ester (Ki = 3.66 mM) and beta-imidazole lactic  (Ki = 3.84 mM). L-Histidine hydrazide (Ki = 36 mM) and imidazole (Ki = 6 mM) noncompetitively inhibited the enzyme EDTA markedly inhibited enzyme activity and this inhibition were reversed by divalent metal ions such as Mn2+, Co2+ Zn2+, Ni2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+.

The aim of this study was to determine if administration of cis-UCA would be effective in attenuating colitis and the possible role of IL-10. Colitis was induced in 129/SvEv mice by administering 5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) for 7 days in drinking water. During this period mice received daily subcutaneously injections of cis-UCA or vehicle. To examine a role for IL-10, 129/SvEv IL-10(-/-) mice were injected for 24 days with cis-UCA or vehicle. Clinical disease was assessed by measurement of , stool consistency, and presence of blood. At sacrifice, colonic tissue was collected for histology and measurement of myeloperoxidase and cytokines. Splenocytes were analyzed for CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T-regulatory cells via flow cytometry. Murine bone-marrow derived antigen-presenting cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) ± UCA and cytokine secretion measured. Our results demonstrated that cis-UCA at a dose of 50 µg was effective in ameliorating DSS-induced colitis as evidenced by reduced  loss and attenuated changes in colon /length. This protection was associated with reduced colonic expression of CXCL1, an increased expression of IL-17A and a significant preservation of splenic CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T-regulatory cells. cis-UCA decreased LPS induced CXCL1, but not TNFα secretion, from antigen-presenting cells in vitro. UCA reduced colonic levels of IFNγ in IL-10(-/-) mice but did not attenuate colitis. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that cis- is effective in reducing the severity of colitis in a chemically-induced mouse model, indicating that pathways induced by ultraviolet radiation to the skin can influence distal sites of inflammation. This provides further evidence for a possible role for sunlight exposure in modulating inflammatory disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8736333>Effect of topical cis- on local lymph node activation during contact sensitization in mouse, rat and guinea-pig.</a></h2><p>Cis- (cUCA) has been suggested as a mediator of impairment of contact hypersensitivity induction by ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation. We ascertained whether topical cUCA influences local lymph node activation during induction of contact hypersensitivity. Topical cUCA or vehicle was applied during the local lymph node assay to oxazolone. Local lymph node  and cell number were assessed in all animals. Additionally, cell proliferation rate was studied in Hartley guinea-pigs and CBA/Ca mice, whereas activation of antigen-presenting cells was quantified in NMRI mice and Wistar rats. Topical cUCA suppressed all parameters of local lymph node activation due to oxazolone application in guinea-pigs. No effect, with the exception of a suppression of antigen-presenting cell activity, was seen in mice. No effect was seen in rats. The study shows that topical cUCA may suppress local lymph node activation during contact sensitization and suggests that differences between the effect of cUCA in different animal species may exist.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9155259>The effect of chronic treatment of mice with  isomers.</a></h2><p>Trans- (trans-UCA) accumulates in the upper layers of the epidermis and can be isomerized to cis-UCA by UV light irradiation. Cis- possesses immunosuppressive properties that have led to its consideration as one of the initiators of UV-induced immunosuppression. High quantities of cis-UCA persist in human skin for prolonged periods in the summer months. In the present study, mice were injected intradermally with trans-UCA and cis-UCA three times a week for 4 weeks in order to ascertain the long-term effects of the presence of these compounds in the skin. The  of mice and of their spleens were unaffected by the cis- or trans-UCA treatment. A decrease in thymus , accompanied by an increase in lymph node , was detected in the cis-UCA-treated mice compared with trans-UCA-treated mice and untreated controls. A net accumulation of lymphocytes and dendritic cells (DC) in lymph nodes was evident following cis-UCA treatment but the percentage of both CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes as well as Ia+ DC remained constant among the different treatment groups, indicating that there was no specific migration or proliferation of a particular subset of cells. The in vitro lymphoproliferative response of lymph node cells to the mitogen concanavalin A was significantly sup pressed by cis-UCA treatment. The density of Langerhans cells in the epidermis of the ears was not altered by the chronic cis-UCA treatment. However, chronic cis-UCA treatment did suppress the mixed skin lymphocyte reaction response utilizing epidermal cells from the ears (an uninjected area of skin), indicating a systemic suppression. Compared with trans-UCA treatment, chronic cis-UCA treatment did not cause a significant reduction in the contact hypersensitivity response to oxazolone or the delayed hypersensitivity response to herpes simplex virus. Thus, chronic treatment with cis-UCA led to the suppression of some, but not all, of the immune parameters that are affected by UVB irradiation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8565287>Dietary beta-carotene and ultraviolet-induced immunosuppression.</a></h2><p>Ultraviolet (UV)-induced immunosuppression is a critical step in UV carcinogenesis, permitting tumour outgrowth. We investigated the effect of dietary beta-carotene on UV suppression of contact hypersensitivity (CHS) to trinitrochlorobenzene (TNCB) in BALB/c mice. Mice were fed for 10-16 weeks chow alone or supplemented with 1% beta-carotene or placebo as beadlets. Serum beta-carotene was detectable by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis only in beta-carotene-fed mice (2.06 +/- 0.15 micrograms/ml). Serum retinol was 0.22-0.27 micrograms/ml in all three groups. Mice (n = 41/dietary group) were irradiated with 0, 4.5, 9 or 18 kJ/m2 of UVB and the CHS response was measured. Decreased CHS responses were observed in all UV-irradiated groups compared with unirradiated controls. UV dose-responses for suppression of CHS derived by first-order regression analyses of plots of percentage suppression of CHS as a function of log10UV dose showed significant slopes (P < 0.02) for all three dietary groups and similar residual variances between groups, P > 0.05. The UV dose for 50% suppression of CHS was 6.3 kJ/m2 for control, 6.4 kJ/m2 for placebo, and 5.5 kJ/m2 for beta-carotene-fed mice. No significant differences in slopes or elevations between UV dose-responses were observed, P > 0.05. Skin levels of the initiator of UV-induced immunosuppression, cis , were determined by HPLC in mice given 0 or 9 kJ/m2 of UV (n = 28/dietary group). No significant differences were observed between dietary groups (range 35.2-41.1 ng/mg skin, P > 0.15) We conclude feeding beta-carotene to BALB/c mice does not alter susceptibility to UV immune suppression, in contrast to human studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11471746>Effect of dietary histidine content on the change in content of skin  isomers in hairless mice irradiated with ultraviolet B.</a></h2><p>Hairless mice were fed with a 10% amino  mixture diet (control diet, 0.42% histidine content), the control diet without histidine (histidine-free diet), or the control diet rich in histidine (histidine-rich diet; histidine content, 4.2%) for 32 days. They were irradiated with UV light of 312 nm for 30 min, and skin samples were periodically taken for measuring the  isomers. Total  isomers were decreased by UV irradiation in all the three groups, the recovery being the fastest in the histidine-rich group. The percentage increase in cis-/total  was quickly increased by UVB irradiation. The recovery of the ratio was slightly higher in the histidine-rich group, although the total  level was higher in the histidine-rich group than in the others. Therefore, the absolute cis- content in the skin was almost the same among the three groups. These results indicate that the increased histidine intake strengthened UVB protection without any decrease in immune suppression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10598754>Sunscreen protection against cis- production in human skin.</a></h2><p>Commercial sunscreens may offer some protection from immunosuppression induced by ultraviolet (UV) radiation, but agreement concerning the degree of protection is lacking. Cis-, formed by the photoisomerization of transurocanic  is considered an important mediator of the cutaneous immunomodulation resulting from exposure to UV radiation. We investigated the effect of sunscreens on the isomerization of  in 17 human subjects. Two sunscreens containing chemical filters, sun protection factor (SPF) 4 and SPF 10, and a SPF 10 sunscreen with a physical filter were applied at a thickness of 2 mg/cm2. The effect of a thin layer (0.5 mg/cm2) of the chemical SPF 10 sunscreen was also evaluated, as the amount of sunscreen applied in practice may be considerably less than recommended. All areas were irradiated with a single UV dose of 3.6 SED (standard erythema doses). In irradiated unprotected skin the median net production of cis- was 52% (relative amount). In the sites treated with the chemical sunscreens, the production of cis- was 7.4% (SPF 4) and 3.5% (SPF 10), and isomerization was thus reduced more efficiently at a higher SPF (p<0.01). The physical sunscreen reduced the formation of cis-UCA to 15%, and was significantly less effective than both the chemical SPF 10 sunscreen (p<0.01) and the SPF 4 sunscreen (p<0.01). The production of cis- in the area treated with the thin layer of the chemical SPF 10 sunscreen was 22%. The protection against the production of cis- was therefore reduced significantly (p<0.01) when the sunscreen was applied in an amount lower than recommended.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12862421>High transfection efficiency of poly(4-vinylimidazole) as a new gene carrier.</a></h2><p>Poly(4-vinylimidazole) (P4V) was obtained by free radical polymerization of 4-vinylimidazole (4V) prepared by decarboxylation of .

Permethrin alone decreased thymic  and cellularity. Although cUCA alone did not affect thymic end points, coexposure to topical permethrin and cUCA exacerbated the thymolytic effects of permethrin. The single topical dose of permethrin also depressed several immune responses in isolated splenic leukocytes. This included splenic T-cell proliferative response to mitogen, splenic macrophage hydrogen peroxide production, and splenic B lymphocyte-specific antibody production. Unlike the effect of coexposure to these agents on thymic end points, cUCA did not exacerbate permethrin's adverse effect on any of the splenic end points examined. These results appear to suggest divergent mechanisms by which these compounds affect precursor and functionally mature T cells. At the doses used in this study, permethrin caused neurotoxic effects, including lethality, in a portion of the mice. For undetermined reasons, cUCA significantly increased the rate of lethality caused by permethrin. Although the permethrin doses used in this study exceed that typically used in human medicine, these results raise some concerns about the possibility that sunlight, via cUCA, may increase the risk of adverse central nervous system and immune effects caused by permethrin alone.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6628454>Measurement of the skin  content in normal and histidinemic infants.</a></h2><p>The  content of the skin was measured photometrically in a large number of normal and histidinemic infants. A very high content was demonstrated in the normal newborn infants, followed by a rapid decrease throughout early infancy. In contrast, 36 measurements in 17 infants with histidinemia revealed a much lower content even in their newborn periods. Thus, the quantification of skin  was considered to be simple and useful for confirming the diagnosis of histidinemia, especially in a neonatal mass-screening program.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/650295>Effect of excess dietary L-histidine on plasma cholesterol levels in weanling rats.</a></h2><p>Supplementation of a closed formula, cereal based stock diet with excess L-histidine at a 5% or 8% level for 4 days reduced growth and induced hepatomegaly and an increase in plasma cholesterole levels in weanling rats. The enlargement of the liver was in part due to glycogen accumulation; plasma glucose concentration was unchanged. Feeding four different amino acids (L-phenylalanine, L-glutamic , glycine and L-tryptophan), at levels which caused reduction of growth comparable to the 5% and 8% L-histidine supplementation, did not effect liver  or plasma cholesterol levels. L-Threonine added, at a 2% level, to the 8% L-histidine diet did not alleviate any of the histidine effects. Rats fed a diet containing 5% , the first metabolite of the histidine degradative pathway, grew at a normal rate but had higher plasma cholesterol levels compared to rats fed stock diet. When rats fed L-histidine-or -supplemented diets were returned to stock diet, a normal growth rate was resumed immediately and plasma cholesterol levels returned to normal within 6 days. These results suggest that L-histidine and/or  induce a hypercholesterolemia which disappears several days after the supplementation ceases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19877415>[A portable sensory system for phenols detection based on molecular-imprinted polymers with catalytic properties].</a></h2><p>Portable devices for the express control of the phenols content in water were developed. Polymers mimicking active site of the enzyme tyrosinase, synthesized using the method of molecular imprinting, were obtained by co-polymerization of the complex Cu (II)-catechol- ethyl ester with ethyleneglycoldimethacrylate. Concentration of phenols in the analyzed samples was detected using universal portable device oxymeter with the oxygen electrode in a close contact with catalytic molecularly-imprinted polymer as a transducer. The detection limit of phenols detection using the developed sensor system based on polymers-biomimics with the optimized composition comprised 0.078 mM, while the linear range of the sensor comprised 0.078-5 mM. The working characteristics of the portable sensor devices were investigated. The possibility of repeated use of the catalytic polymers-biomimics as selective elements of the developed portable sensor systems was demonstrated. Storage stability of sensor systems at room temperature was 12 months (90%). As compared to traditional methods of phenols detection the developed sensor system is characterized by operation simplicity, compactness, and low cost.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2636983>Cis- stereospecifically modulates human monocyte IL-1 production and surface HLA-DR antigen expression, T-cell IL-2 production and CD4/CD8 ratio.</a></h2><p>UV irradiation is known to photoisomerize epidermal trans- (trans-UCA) to cis- (cis-UCA), which has been postulated to be involved in local and systemic downregulation of immune responses. We have earlier shown that cis-UCA suppresses interleukin 1 (IL-1) production in human epidermal cells. To study the possible effects of UCA isomers on human peripheral blood lymphoid cells, these cells were cultured in the presence of either UCA stereoisomer, and a number of immunological parameters were assayed. Cis-UCA (100 micrograms/ml) caused a significant downregulation of monocyte IL-1 production, and diminished monocyte HLA-DR expression. Cis-UCA also caused a significant reduction in the CD4/CD8 ratio. Furthermore, T-cells preincubated with cis-UCA caused a significant downregulation of purified protein derivative-induced interleukin 2 production by autologous T-cells. The trans isomer had no effect in any of these in vitro tests. The reported stereospecific effects of cis-UCA are compatible with the postulated function of this chemical as an UV-induced, low-molecular- immunomediator substance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11204225>Analysis of histidine and  isomers by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography.</a></h2><p>The qualitative separation performance of a C18, C8 and C4 reversed-phase column was investigated for the separation of histidine and its metabolites histamine, 1-methyihistamine and trans- and cis-. Trans- and cis- were baseline separated from their precursor histidine on all three columns using isocratic elution with a mobile phase composed of 0.01 M aqueous TEAP pH 3.0 and acetonitrile at a ratio of 98:2 (v/v). However, histidine was not separated from histamine and 1-methyihistamine. Selecting the C8 column and introducing 0.005 M of the ion pairing reagent 1-octanesulfonic  sodium salt into the aqueous solution and acetonitrile at a ratio of 90:10 (v/v), significantly improved the separation. The separation was also followed by a change in the retention times and the order of elution. The sequence of elution was histidine, cis-, trans-, histamine and 1-methylhistamine with retention times of 5.58 +/- 0.07, 7.03 +/- 0.15, 7.92 +/- 0.18, 18.77 +/- 0.24 and 20.79 +/- 0.21 min (mean +/- SD; n=5). The separation on the C8 column in the presence of the ion-pairing reagent was further improved with gradient elution that resulted in a reduction in the retention times and elution volumes of histamine and 1-methylhistamine. The detection limits of histidine and trans- at a wavelength of 210 nm and an injection volume of 0.05 ml were 5 x 10(-8) mol l(-1) (n=3). The kinetic of the in-vitro conversion of trans- into the cis-isomer after UV irradiation was depending on the time of exposure and the  of the light source. UVB light induced a significantly faster conversion than UVA light. TUCA and cUCA samples kept at -25 degrees C were stable for up to 50 weeks. Samples, eluted from human skin showed various concentrations of histidine and trans- and cis- with an average of 1.69 +/- 0.33 x 10(-5) mol l(-1), 1.17 +/- 0.43 x 10(-5) mol l(-1) and 1.67 +/- 0.33 x 10(-5) mol l(-1), respectively (n=8).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1606724>Prevention of spontaneous and cyclophosphamide-induced diabetes in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice with oral 2-acetyl-4-tetrahydroxybutylimidazole (THI), a component of caramel colouring III.</a></h2><p>The effect of oral administration of THI, a compound present in ammonia caramel food colouring, was studied in spontaneous and induced murine diabetes mellitus. Continuous administration of THI at 400 ppm in drinking water reduced the prevalence of spontaneous diabetes in female NOD/Lt mice from 63% in untreated controls to 8% in treated animals. Since cyclophosphamide (CP) accelerates and intensifies diabetes in NOD mice, we also studied the effect of THI in this model. Diabetes incidence was reduced from 100% in mice given only CP to 13-14% in mice given THI either concurrently or from 14 days previously. Histologically, THI greatly reduced the severity of insulitis. As measured by flow cytometry, all THI-treated mice had a 60-80% reduction in splenic CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. THI-treated mice showed no untoward effects and specifically no  loss, or pathological changes in their livers, kidneys or lungs. However, there was moderate atrophy of the thymus cortex. THI is a small imidazole-containing compound with structural similarity to histamine and , both known to have immunosuppressive properties. It is a widely used food additive with no known long-term toxic effects at low dosage. Thus, THI could be a useful immunosuppressive agent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2416709>[Filaggrins].</a></h2><p>It has been shown in recent studies that a group of histidine-rich proteins play a significant role--as interfilamentous matrix proteins--in keratin formation in the epidermis of man and other species. These proteins have been termed filaggrins in reference to their ability to aggregate in vitro reconstituted keratin filaments to macrofibrils with a striking similarity to the ultrastructural keratin pattern. Filaggrins derive from high molecular  precursor proteins--profilaggrins--which are synthesized in the keratohyaline granules and break down rapidly into filaggrins when the granular cells undergo transition into corneocytes. Further metabolic breakdown of filaggrins leads to the formation of other compounds which subserve physiological functions: e.g. , which is possibly a natural sunscreen, and free amino acids, which are thought to contribute to the hygroscopic character of the horny layer and to its barrier function. Alterations of filaggrin metabolism have been recognized in a number of pathological states of the skin and may be responsible for disturbed epidermal differentiation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26362807>Determination of biogenic amines in beer and wine by capillary electrophoresis-tandem mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>A capillary electrophoresis-tandem mass spectrometry (CE-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous assessment of nine biogenic amines (spermine, spermidine, putrescine, cadaverine, histamine, phenylethylamine, tryptamine, tyramine, and ) in commercial samples of beer and wine is introduced. The samples were submitted to a simple clean-up step with poly(vinylpolypyrrolidone) followed by filtration. Electrophoretic separation in a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-coated capillary using 0.5 mol L(-1) acetic  (pH 2.5) as background electrolyte and detection by electrospray-tandem mass spectrometry was employed. The range of the correlation coefficients of the calibration curves of the analyzed compounds was 0.996-0.999, and the limits of detection and limits of quantification were in the range of 1-2 μg L(-1) and 3-8 μg L(-1), respectively. The recovery values for samples spiked at three concentration levels (0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 mg L(-1)) ranged from 87 to 113% with standard deviation not greater than 5.8%. The use of a PVA-coated silica capillary allows suppressing the electroosmotic flow and, consequently, increasing of the separation efficiency. The method was successfully used to determine biogenic amines in commercial samples of beer and wine.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This study shows that Bacillus sp. strain B1, which was previously identified by our group, is effective in regulating P. globosa by excreting active metabolites. Heat stability, pH stability and molecular weight range of the algicidal compounds from strain B1 were measured and the results demonstrated that the algicidal activities of these compounds were not affected by pH or temperature variation. The algicidal compounds extracted with methanol were isolated and purified by ODS-A column chromatography and HPLC. The algicidal compounds corresponding to peaks 2-5 eluted from HPLC were further analysed by quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Q-TOF-MS). PeakView™ Software determined the compounds corresponding to peaks 2-5 to be L-histidine, o-tyrosine, N-acetylhistamine and  on the basis of the accurate mass information, the isotopic pattern and MS-MS spectra. Furthermore, these compounds were also able to eliminate Skeletonema costatum, Prorocentrum donghaiense and Heterosigma akashiwo. This is the first report of bacteria-derived algicidal compounds being identified only by Q-TOF-MS and PeakView™ Software, and these compounds may be used as the constituents of algicides in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27011348>-modified chitosan nanoparticles can confer anti-inflammatory effect by delivering CD98 siRNA to macrophages.</a></h2><p>CD98 plays an important role in the development and progression of . Here, CD98 siRNA (siCD98) was complexed with -modified chitosan (UAC) to form nanoparticles (NPs), which were transfected into Raw 264.7 macrophages in an effort to convey anti-inflammatory effects. Characterization showed that the generated NPs had a desirable particle size (156.0-247.1nm), a slightly positive zeta potential (15.8-17.5mV), and no apparent cytotoxicity against Raw 264.7 macrophages and colon-26 cells compared to control NPs fabricated by Oligofectamine (OF) and siRNA. Cellular uptake experiments demonstrated that macrophages exhibited a time-dependent accumulation profile of UAC/siRNA NPs. Further in vitro gene silencing experiments revealed that UAC/siCD98 NPs with a weight ratio of 60:1 yielded the most efficient knockdowns of CD98 and the pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF-α. Indeed, the RNAi efficiency obtained with our NPs was even higher than that of the positive control OF/siCD98 NPs. These results suggest that UAC/siCD98 NPs might be a safe, efficient and promising candidate for the treatment of inflammatory disease.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The two isomers modulate immune functions in several experimental systems. In particular, cis-UCA has been shown to induce antigen-specific immune tolerance, but the molecular mechanism of this effect is unknown. The present investigation was instituted to disclose any effect of UCA isomers on the cellular expression of the costimulatory antigens CD80 (B7/BB-1) and CD28. CD80 expression was efficiently induced in monocytic (CD14+) cells by human interferon-gamma, while CD28 levels on lymphocytes remained unchanged, as detected by flow cytometry. Neither UCA isomer showed any effect on the expression patterns of these costimulatory molecules. The results obtained suggest that the mode of action for epidermal UCA-induced tolerogenesis may not involve modulation of CD80 (B7/BB-1) or CD28 expression.</p></html>
