Nonalcoholic  disease, the most common chronic  disorder in developed countries, is characterized by the abnormal retention of excess lipid within hepatocytes and predisposes individuals to  cancer. We previously reported that the levels of Lissencephaly 1 (LIS1, also known as PAFAH1B1) are down-regulated in human hepatocellular carcinoma. Following up on this observation, we found that genetic deletion of  in the mouse  increases lipid accumulation and inflammation in this organ. Further analysis revealed that loss of  triggers endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and reduces triglyceride secretion. Attenuation of ER stress by addition of  (TUDCA) diminished lipid accumulation in the -deficient hepatocytes. Moreover, the Golgi stacks were disorganized in -deficient  cells. Of note, the  -knockout mice exhibited increased hepatocyte ploidy and accelerated development of  cancer after exposure to the  carcinogen diethylnitrosamine (DEN). Taken together, these findings suggest that reduced  levels can spur the development of  diseases from steatosis to  cancer and provide a useful model for delineating the molecular pathways that lead to these diseases.© 2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27214655>Calorie-induced ER stress suppresses uroguanylin satiety signaling in diet-induced .</a></h2><p>The uroguanylin-GUCY2C gut-brain axis has emerged as one component regulating feeding, energy homeostasis, body mass and metabolism. Here, we explore a role for this axis in mechanisms underlying diet-induced  (DIO).Intestinal uroguanylin expression and secretion, and hypothalamic GUCY2C expression and anorexigenic signaling, were quantified in mice on high-calorie diets for 14 weeks. The role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in suppressing uroguanylin in DIO was explored using tunicamycin, an inducer of ER stress, and  (TUDCA), a chemical chaperone that inhibits ER stress. The impact of consumed calories on uroguanylin expression was explored by dietary manipulation. The role of uroguanylin in mechanisms underlying  was examined using Camk2a-Cre-ER(T2)-Rosa-STOP(loxP/loxP)-Guca2b mice in which tamoxifen induces transgenic hormone expression in brain.DIO suppressed intestinal uroguanylin expression and eliminated its postprandial secretion into the circulation. DIO suppressed uroguanylin through ER stress, an effect mimicked by tunicamycin and blocked by TUDCA. Hormone suppression by DIO reflected consumed calories, rather than the pathophysiological milieu of , as a diet high in calories from carbohydrates suppressed uroguanylin in lean mice, whereas calorie restriction restored uroguanylin in obese mice. However, hypothalamic GUCY2C, enriched in the arcuate nucleus, produced anorexigenic signals mediating satiety upon exogenous agonist administration, and DIO did not impair these responses. Uroguanylin replacement by transgenic expression in brain repaired the hormone insufficiency and reconstituted satiety responses opposing DIO and its associated comorbidities, including visceral adiposity, glucose intolerance and hepatic steatosis.These studies reveal a novel pathophysiological mechanism contributing to  in which calorie-induced suppression of intestinal uroguanylin impairs hypothalamic mechanisms regulating food consumption through loss of anorexigenic endocrine signaling.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the subsequent unfolded protein response (UPR) have been implicated in lipid-induced insulin resistance. However, the UPR is also a fundamental mechanism required for cell adaptation and survival. We aimed to distinguish the adaptive and deleterious effects of lipid-induced ER stress on hepatic insulin action. Exposure of human hepatoma HepG2 cells or mouse primary hepatocytes to the saturated  acid palmitate enhanced ER stress in a dose-dependent manner. Strikingly, exposure of HepG2 cells to prolonged mild ER stress activation induced by low levels of thapsigargin, tunicamycin, or palmitate augmented insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. This chronic mild ER stress subsequently attenuated the acute stress response to high-level palmitate challenge. In contrast, exposure of HepG2 cells or hepatocytes to severe ER stress induced by high levels of palmitate was associated with reduced insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation and glycogen synthesis, as well as increased expression of glucose-6-phosphatase. Attenuation of ER stress using chemical chaperones (trimethylamine N-oxide or ) partially protected against the lipid-induced changes in insulin signaling. These findings in  cells suggest that mild ER stress associated with chronic low-level palmitate exposure induces an adaptive UPR that enhances insulin signaling and protects against the effects of high-level palmitate. However, in the absence of chronic adaptation, severe ER stress induced by high-level palmitate exposure induces deleterious UPR signaling that contributes to insulin resistance and metabolic dysregulation.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22177958>Reduction of endoplasmic reticulum stress using chemical chaperones or Grp78 overexpression does not protect muscle cells from palmitate-induced insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is proposed as a novel link between elevated  acids levels, obesity and insulin resistance in  and adipose tissue. However, it is unknown whether ER stress also contributes to lipid-induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle, the major tissue responsible of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal. Here, we investigated the possible role of ER stress in palmitate-induced alterations of insulin action, both in vivo, in gastrocnemius of high-palm diet fed mice, and in vitro, in palmitate-treated C(2)C(12) myotubes. We demonstrated that 8 weeks of high-palm diet increased the expression of ER stress markers in muscle of mice, whereas ex-vivo insulin-stimulated PKB phosphorylation was not altered in this tissue. In addition, exposure of C(2)C(12) myotubes to either tuncamycine or palmitate induced ER stress and altered insulin-stimulated PKB phosphorylation. However, alleviation of ER stress by either TUDCA or 4-PBA treatments, or by overexpressing Grp78, did not restore palmitate-induced reduction of insulin-stimulated PKB phosphorylation in C(2)C(12) myotubes.

These organs have been shown to have increased susceptibility to cold ischemia/reperfusion (CIR) injury in comparison with otherwise comparable lean livers; the mechanisms governing this increased susceptibility to CIR injury are not fully understood. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is an important link between hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome. In this study, we investigated ER stress signaling and blockade in the mediation of CIR injury in severely steatotic rodent allografts. Steatotic allografts from genetically leptin-resistant rodents had increased ER stress responses and increased markers of hepatocellular injury after  transplantation into strain-matched lean recipients. ER stress response components were reduced by the chemical chaperone taurine-conjugated ursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), and this resulted in an improvement in the allograft injury. TUDCA treatment decreased nuclear factor kappa B activation and the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 and interleukin-1β. However, the predominant response was decreased expression of the ER stress cell death mediator [CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP)]. Furthermore, activation of inflammation-associated caspase-11 was decreased, and this linked ER stress/CHOP to proinflammatory cytokine production after steatotic  transplantation. These data confirm ER stress in steatotic allografts and implicate this as a mediating mechanism of inflammation and hepatocyte death in the steatotic  allograft.Copyright © 2011 American Association for the Study of  Diseases.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23804416>Vertical sleeve gastrectomy reduces hepatic steatosis while increasing serum bile acids in a weight-loss-independent manner.</a></h2><p>Our objective was to investigate the role of bile acids in hepatic steatosis reduction after vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG).High fat diet (HFD)-induced obese C57Bl/6 mice were randomized to VSG, Sham operation (Sham), Sham operation with pair feeding to VSG (Sham-PF), or nonsurgical controls (Naïve). All mice were on HFD until sacrifice. Mice were observed postsurgery and data for body weight, body composition, metabolic parameters, serum bile acid level and composition were collected. Further hepatic gene expression by mRNA-seq and RT-PCR analysis was assessed.VSG and Sham-PF mice lost equal weight postsurgery while VSG mice had the lowest hepatic triglyceride content at sacrifice. The VSG mice had elevated serum bile acid levels that positively correlated with maximal weight loss. Serum bile composition in the VSG group had increased cholic and . These bile acid composition changes in VSG mice explained observed downregulation of hepatic lipogenic and bile acid synthetic genes.VSG in obese mice results in greater hepatic steatosis reduction than seen with caloric restriction alone.

The ER stress response is activated in the livers of mice fed a methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet, yet the role of ER stress in the pathogenesis of MCD diet-induced steatohepatitis is unknown. Using chemical chaperones on hepatic steatosis and markers of inflammation and fibrosis in mice fed a MCD diet, we aim to determine the effects of reducing ER stress. C57BL/6J mice were fed a MCD diet with or without the ER chemical chaperones 4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA) and  (TUDCA) for 2 wk. TUDCA and PBA effectively attenuated the ER stress response in MCD diet-fed mice, as evidenced by reduced protein levels of phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2α and phosphorylated JNK and suppression of mRNA levels of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein, glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa, and X-box binding protein 1. However, PBA and TUDCA did not decrease MCD diet-induced hepatic steatosis. MCD diet-induced hepatic inflammation, as evidenced by increased plasma alanine aminotransferase and induction of hepatic TNFα expression, was also not reduced by PBA or TUDCA. PBA and TUDCA did not attenuate MCD diet-induced upregulation of the fibrosis-associated genes tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-9. ER chemical chaperones reduce MCD diet-induced ER stress, yet they do not improve MCD diet-induced hepatic steatosis, inflammation, or activation of genes associated with fibrosis.

However, its function in hepatic lipid metabolism is unclear. Here, we identified a role for mGPDH in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Specifically, mGPDH expression and activity were lower in fatty livers from patients and mice with NAFLD (ob/ob, high-fat diet [HFD] and db/db). Liver-specific depletion of mGPDH in mice or mGPDH knockdown in cultured hepatocytes exacerbated diet-induced triglyceride accumulation and steatosis through enhanced lipogenesis. RNA-sequencing revealed that mGPDH regulated endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-related proteins and processes. mGPDH deletion exacerbated tunicamycin (ER stress inducer)-induced hepatic steatosis, whereas  (ER stress inhibitor) rescued mGPDH depletion-induced steatosis on an HFD. Moreover, ER stress induced by mGPDH depletion could be abrogated by the intracellular Ca chelator 1,2-bis (2-aminophenoxy) ethane N,N,N´,N´-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester, mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) inhibitor cyclosporine A, or cyclophilin-D (Cyp-D) knockdown. mGPDH promoting Cyp-D ubiquitination was also observed. Finally, liver-specific mGPDH overexpression attenuated hepatic steatosis in ob/ob and HFD mice. Conclusion: mGPDH is a pivotal regulator of hepatic lipid metabolism. Its deficiency induces ER stress by suppressing Cyp-D ubiquitination, a key regulator of the mitochondrial Ca conductance channel mPTP, and results in hepatic steatosis. mGPDH may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of NAFLD.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29500188>Metabolomics Profiles of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in a Korean Prospective Cohort: The Korean Cancer Prevention Study-II.</a></h2><p>In the prospective Korean Cancer Prevention Study-II (KCPS-II), we investigated the application of metabolomics to differentiate subjects with incident hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC group) from subjects who remained free of cancer (control group) during a mean follow-up period of 7 years with the aim of identifying valuable metabolic biomarkers for HCC. We used baseline serum samples from 75 subjects with incident HCC and 134 age- and gender-matched cancer-free subjects. Serum metabolic profiles associated with HCC incidence were investigated via metabolomics analysis. Compared with the control group, the HCC group showed significantly higher serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase, and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase. At baseline, compared with the control group, the HCC group showed significantly higher levels of 9 metabolites, including leucine, 5-hydroxyhexanoic acid, phenylalanine, tyrosine, arachidonic acid, and  (TUDCA), but lower levels of 28 metabolites, including oleamide, androsterone sulfate, L-palmitoylcarnitine, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) 16:0, LPA 18:1, and lysophosphatidylcholines (lysoPC).

The prevalence of NAFLD in Japan has nearly doubled in the last 10-15 years. Increasing evidence supports undernourishment in utero being causatively connected with the risk of NAFLD in later life. Low body mass index (BMI) has been common among Japanese women of childbearing age for several decades due to their strong desire to be thin. It is plausible that insufficient maternal energy intake by pregnant Japanese women may underlie the rapid increase in the prevalence of NAFLD in Japan. In order to clarify the mechanisms by which undernourishment in utero primes adult hepatic steatosis, we developed a mouse model of fetal undernourishment with a hepatic fat deposit-prone phenotype on an obesogenic high fat diet in later life. We found that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response parameters were activated concomitantly with the deterioration of hepatic steatosis and also that the alleviation of ER stress with the chemical chaperone,  (TUDCA), significantly improved hepatic steatosis. Therefore, undernourishment in utero may program the future integration of ER stress in the liver on an obesogenic diet in later life and also induce the deterioration of hepatic steatosis.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is proposed as a crucial disease mechanism in obese and insulin-resistant animals (such as ob/ob mice) with simple steatosis, but its role in NASH remains controversial. We therefore evaluated the role of ER stress as a disease mechanism in foz/foz mice, which develop both the metabolic and histological features that mimic human NASH. We explored ER stress markers in the liver of foz/foz mice in response to a high-fat diet (HFD) at several time points. We then evaluated the effect of treatment with an ER stress inducer tunicamycin, or conversely with the ER protectant  (TUDCA), on the metabolic and hepatic features. foz/foz mice are obese, glucose intolerant and develop NASH characterized by steatosis, inflammation, ballooned hepatocytes and apoptosis from 6 weeks of HFD feeding. This was not associated with activation of the upstream unfolded protein response [phospho-eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) activity and spliced X-box-binding protein 1 (Xbp1)]. Activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and up-regulation of activating transcription factor-4 (Atf4) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-homologous protein (Chop) transcripts were however compatible with a 'pathological' response to ER stress. We tested this by using intervention experiments. Induction of chronic ER stress failed to worsen , glucose intolerance and NASH pathology in HFD-fed foz/foz mice. In addition, the ER protectant TUDCA, although reducing steatosis, failed to improve glucose intolerance, hepatic inflammation and apoptosis in HFD-fed foz/foz mice.

Whether ER homeostasis is affected in cows experiencing fatty liver is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential role of ER stress in hepatic lipid accumulation in calf hepatocytes and ER stress status in dairy cows with severe fatty liver. In vitro experiments were conducted in which hepatocytes were isolated from calves and treated with different concentrations of fatty acids,  (TUDCA; a canonical inhibitor of ER stress), or both. The increase in phosphorylation level of protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) and inositol requiring protein-1α (IRE1α) proteins, and the cleavage of activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6) protein in response to increasing doses of fatty acids (which were reversed by TUDCA treatment) in primary hepatocytes underscored a mechanistic link between fatty acids and ER stress. In addition, fatty acid treatment increased the abundance of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c, acetyl-CoA carboxylase-α, fatty acid synthase, and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1, and lipid accumulation in calf primary hepatocytes, whereas inhibition of ER stress by incubating with TUDCA significantly weakened these effects. Overall, results in vitro indicate that inhibition of ER stress in calf hepatocytes alleviates fatty acid-induced lipid accumulation by downregulating the expression of lipogenic genes. In vivo experiments, liver and blood samples were collected from cows diagnosed as healthy (n = 15) or with severe fatty liver (n = 15). The phosphorylation level of PERK and IRE1α, the cleavage of ATF6 protein, and the abundance of several unfolded protein response genes (78 kDa glucose-regulated protein, AMP-dependent transcription factor 4, and spliced X-box binding protein 1) were greater in liver of cows with severe fatty liver. The present in vivo study confirms the occurrence of ER stress in dairy cows with severe fatty liver. Considering the causative role of fatty acid-induced ER stress in hepatic lipid accumulation in calf hepatocytes, the existence of ER stress in the liver of severe fatty liver cows may presage its participation in fatty liver progression in dairy cows.

TLR4 agonist treatment reduced damage in steatotic  grafts. When TLR4 action was inhibited, PPARγ antagonists did not protect steatotic  grafts. In conclusion, TUDCA reduced PPARγ and this in turn up-regulated the TLR4 pathway, thus protecting steatotic  grafts. TLR4 activating-based strategies could reduce the inherent risk of steatotic  failure after transplantation.© Copyright 2012 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23548375>Autophagy is involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced cell death of rat hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Both endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and autophagy have been shown to display dual roles in cell survival in multiple cell lines. There is a reported but poorly understood link between ER stress, autophagy, and cell death. We hypothesized that autophagy plays a role in ER stress-dependent cell death in rat hepatocytes.Primary hepatocytes isolated from both lean and obese male Zucker rats were cultured and treated with tunicamycin (TM), , 3-methyladenine, and wortmannin for 12 h. The ER stress-associated genes glucose-regulated protein 78 and C/EBP homologous protein were examined via quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. Immunostaining with microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 as well as electron microscopy were used to evaluate autophagy activity. Trypan blue exclusion was used to determine hepatocyte cell viability.In both lean and steatotic hepatocytes, we found that TM induced both C/EBP homologous protein and glucose-regulated protein 78 messenger RNA expression. Cells with increased ER stress were undergoing increased autophagy and had a significant decrease in cell viability. Both  and 3-methyladenine treatments attenuated TM induced ER stress, autophagy, and cell death, whereas wortmannin treatment reduced autophagy and cell death but without changing ER stress.These data suggest that autophagy is a likely downstream mediator of ER stress-induced cell death in rat hepatocytes. Further exploration of the link between autophagy and ER stress in hepatocyte injury will yield important information that may be leveraged for treatment of liver injuries such as ischemia/reperfusion.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Steatotic livers show impaired regenerative response and reduced tolerance to hepatic injury. We examined the effects of  (TUDCA) and 4-phenyl butyric acid (PBA) in steatotic and non-steatotic livers during partial hepatectomy under I/R (PH+I/R). Their effects on the induction of unfolded protein response (UPR) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress were also evaluated. We report that PBA, and especially TUDCA, reduced inflammation, apoptosis and necrosis, and improved  regeneration in both  types. Both compounds, especially TUDCA, protected both  types against ER damage, as they reduced the activation of two of the three pathways of UPR (namely inositol-requiring enzyme and PKR-like ER kinase) and their target molecules caspase 12, c-Jun N-terminal kinase and C/EBP homologous protein-10. Only TUDCA, possibly mediated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase upregulation, inactivated glycogen synthase kinase-3β. This is turn, inactivated mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel, reduced cytochrome c release from the mitochondria and caspase 9 activation and protected both  types against mitochondrial damage. These findings indicate that chemical chaperones, especially TUDCA, could protect steatotic and non-steatotic livers against injury and regeneration failure after PH+I/R.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29027487>Effect of  on PUFA levels and inflammation in an animal and cell model of hepatic endoplasmic reticulum stress.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate hepatic polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and inflammatory response in an animal and cell model of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Rats were divided into control, tunicamycin (TM)-treated, and TM +  (TUDCA)-treated groups. Hepatic ER stress was induced by TM and the ER stress inhibitor TUDCA was injected 30 min before induction of ER stress. Liver THLE-3 cells were treated with TM and TUDCA was administered in advance to decrease cytotoxic effects. Necroinflammation was evaluated in liver sections, while cell viability was determined using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay kit. ER stress was confirmed by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis of C/EBP-homologous protein and 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein. Arachidonic acid (C20:4n-6), dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (C20:3n-6), eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5n-3), and docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6n-3) in liver tissue and THLE-3 cells were determined by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cyclooxygenase (COX), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were measured in tissue and cell samples. Hepatic ER stress was accomplished by TM and was alleviated by TUDCA. TM treatment significantly decreased PUFAs in both liver and THLE-3 cells compared to controls. PLA2, COX, and PGE2 levels were significantly increased in TM-treated rats and THLE-3 cells compared to controls. TUDCA leads to a partial restoration of liver PUFA levels and decreased PLA2, COX, and PGE2. This study reports decreased PUFA levels in ER stress and supports the use of omega-3 fatty acids in liver diseases demonstrating ER stress.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23512345>Lipid overloading during  regeneration causes delayed hepatocyte DNA replication by increasing ER stress in mice with simple hepatic steatosis.</a></h2><p>Impaired  regeneration has already been reported in many genetic modification models. However, in diet-induced simple hepatic steatosis, which showed similar phenotype with clinical pathology, whether  regeneration is impaired or not remains unclear. In this study, we evaluated  regeneration in mice with diet-induced simple hepatic steatosis, and focused on excess lipid accumulation occurring during  regeneration.Mice were fed high fat diet (HFD) or control diet for 9-10 weeks. We analyzed intrahepatic lipid accumulation, DNA replication, and various signaling pathways including cell proliferation and ER stress during  regeneration after partial hepatectomy. In addition, some of mice were pretreated with  (TUDCA), a chemical chaperone which alleviates ER stress, and then we estimated TUDCA effects on  regeneration.The peak of hepatocyte BrdU incorporation, the expression of proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) protein, and the expressions of cell cycle-related genes were observed in delayed time in HFD mice. The expression of phosphorylated Erk1/2 was also delayed in HFD mice. The amounts of  triglyceride were at least twofold higher in HFD mice at each time point. Intrahepatic palmitic acid was increased especially in HFD mice. ER stress induced during  regeneration was significantly higher in HFD mice. In HFD mice, pretreatment with TUDCA reduced ER stress and resulted in improvement of delayed  regeneration.In simple hepatic steatosis, lipid overloading occurring during  regeneration might be caused ER stress and results in delayed hepatocyte DNA replication.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29139555> inhibits intestinal inflammation and barrier disruption in mice with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>The gut-liver axis is associated with the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

The effect of  (TUDCA), a candidate drug for NAFLD, on intestinal barrier function, intestinal inflammation, gut lipid transport and microbiota composition was analysed in a murine model of NAFLD.The NAFLD mouse model was established by feeding mice a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. TUDCA was administered p.o. during the last 4 weeks. The expression levels of intestinal tight junction genes, lipid metabolic and inflammatory genes were determined by quantitative PCR. Tissue inflammation was evaluated by haematoxylin and eosin staining. The gut microbiota was analysed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.TUDCA administration attenuated HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, inflammatory responses,  and insulin resistance in mice. Moreover, TUDCA attenuated gut inflammatory responses as manifested by decreased intestinal histopathology scores and inflammatory cytokine levels. In addition, TUDCA improved intestinal barrier function by increasing levels of tight junction molecules and the solid chemical barrier. The components involved in ileum lipid transport were also reduced by TUDCA administration in HFD-fed mice.

Fibrates induce the hepatic expression of murine multidrug resistance 2 ( Mdr2 ), encoding the canalicular phospholipid translocator. The physiological role of PPARalpha in regulation of Mdr2 and other genes involved in bile formation is unknown. We found no differences in hepatic expression of the ATP binding cassette transporter genes Mdr2, Bsep (bile salt export pump), Mdr1a / 1b, Abca1 and Abcg5 / Abcg8 (implicated in cholesterol transport), the bile salt-uptake systems Ntcp (Na(+)-taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide gene) and Oatp1 (organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1 gene) or in bile formation between wild-type and Ppar alpha((-/-)) mice. Upon treatment of wild-type mice with ciprofibrate (0.05%, w/w, in diet for 2 weeks), the expression of Mdr2 (+3-fold), Mdr1a (+6-fold) and Mdr1b (+11-fold) mRNAs was clearly induced, while that of Oatp1 (-5-fold) was reduced. Mdr2 protein levels were increased, whereas Bsep, Ntcp and Oatp1 were drastically decreased. Exposure of cultured wild-type mouse hepatocytes to PPARalpha agonists specifically induced Mdr2 mRNA levels and did not affect expression of Mdr1a / 1b. Altered transporter expression in fibrate-treated wild-type mice was associated with a approximately 400% increase in bile flow: secretion of phospholipids and cholesterol was increased only during high-bile-salt infusions. No fibrate effects were observed in Ppar alpha((-/-)) mice. In conclusion, our results show that basal bile formation is not affected by PPARalpha deficiency in mice. The induction of Mdr2 mRNA and Mdr2 protein levels by fibrates is mediated by PPARalpha, while the induction of Mdr1a / 1b in vivo probably reflects a secondary phenomenon related to chronic PPARalpha activation.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8607791>Chronic administration of ursodeoxycholic and  changes microsomal membrane lipid content and  acid compositions in rats.</a></h2><p>We studied the effect of oral supplementation with ursodeoxycholate (UDCA) or tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDCA) on the lipid content and  acid composition of rat hepatic microsomes. UDCA and TUDCA significantly increased the total amount of lipids with the exception of cholesteryl-esters. UDCA significantly increased the triglycerides and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) microsomal content, and decreased the cholesterol/phospholipids and the phosphatidylcholine (PC)/PE ratio. Both treatments increased the percentage oleic acid and of polyunsaturated  acids (PUFA) in each class of lipids. UDCA and TUDCA had a different action on PUFA microsomal molar percentage of phospholipids: UDCA increased the relative percentage of PUFA in the PE fraction, while TUDCA increased the relative percentage of PUFA in the PC fraction. These changes in the hepatic lipid content and composition might in part explain both cytoprotective action of these hydrophillic bile acids and their effect on membrane fluidity.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30246717>Role of X-Box Binding Protein-1 in Fructose-Induced  Lipogenesis in HepG2 Cells.</a></h2><p>A high consumption of fructose leads to hepatic steatosis. About 20-30% of triglycerides are synthesized via de novo lipogenesis. Some studies showed that endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) is involved in this process, while others showed that a lipotoxic environment directly influences ER homeostasis. Here, our aim was to investigate the causal relationship between ERS and fatty acid synthesis and the effect of X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1), one marker of ERS, on hepatic lipid accumulation stimulated by high fructose.HepG2 cells were incubated with different concentrations of fructose. Upstream regulators of de novo lipogenesis (i.e., carbohydrate response element-binding protein [ChREBP] and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c [SREBP-1c]) were measured by polymerase chain reaction and key lipogenic enzymes (acetyl-CoA carboxylase [ACC], fatty acid synthase [FAS], and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 [SCD-1]) by Western blotting. The same lipogenesis-associated factors were then evaluated after exposure of HepG2 cells to high fructose followed by the ERS inhibitor  (TUDCA) or the ERS inducer thapsigargin. Finally, the same lipogenesis-associated factors were evaluated in HepG2 cells after XBP-1 upregulation or downregulation through cell transfection.Exposure to high fructose increased triglyceride levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner and significantly increased mRNA levels of SREBP-1c and ChREBP and protein levels of FAS, ACC, and SCD-1, concomitant with XBP-1 conversion to an active spliced form. Lipogenesis-associated factors induced by high fructose were inhibited by TUDCA and induced by thapsigargin. Triglyceride level in XBP-1-deficient group decreased significantly compared with high-fructose group (4.41 ± 0.54 μmol/g vs. 6.52 ± 0.38 μmol/g, P < 0.001), as mRNA expressions of SREBP-1c (2.92 ± 0.46 vs. 5.08 ± 0.41, P < 0.01) and protein levels of FAS (0.53 ± 0.06 vs. 0.85 ± 0.05, P = 0.01), SCD-1 (0.65 ± 0.06 vs. 0.90 ± 0.04, P = 0.04), and ACC (0.38 ± 0.03 vs. 0.95 ± 0.06, P < 0.01) decreased. Conversely, levels of triglyceride (4.22 ± 0.54 μmol/g vs. 2.41 ± 0.35 μmol/g, P < 0.001), mRNA expression of SREBP-1c (2.70 ± 0.33 vs. 1.00 ± 0.00, P < 0.01), and protein expression of SCD-1 (0.93 ± 0.06 vs. 0.26 ± 0.05, P < 0.01), ACC (0.98 ± 0.09 vs. 0.43 ± 0.03, P < 0.01), and FAS (0.90 ± 0.33 vs. 0.71 ± 0.02, P = 0.04) in XBP-1s-upregulated group increased compared with the untransfected group.ERS is associated with de novo lipogenesis, and XBP-1 partially mediates high-fructose-induced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells through augmentation of de novo lipogenesis.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25111690>Uric acid induces fat accumulation via generation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and SREBP-1c activation in hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is currently one of the most common types of chronic liver injury. Elevated serum uric acid is a strong predictor of the development of fatty liver as well as metabolic syndrome. Here we demonstrate that uric acid induces triglyceride accumulation by SREBP-1c activation via induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in hepatocytes. Uric acid-induced ER stress resulted in an increase of glucose-regulated protein (GRP78/94), splicing of the X-box-binding protein-1 (XBP-1), the phosphorylation of protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK), and eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2α (eIF-2α) in cultured hepatocytes. Uric acid promoted hepatic lipogenesis through overexpression of the lipogenic enzyme, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) via activation of SREBP-1c, which was blocked by probenecid, an organic anion transport blocker in HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes. A blocker of ER stress,  (TUDCA), and an inhibitor of SREBP-1c, metformin, blocked hepatic fat accumulation, suggesting that uric acid promoted fat synthesis in hepatocytes via ER stress-induced activation of SREBP-1c. Uric acid-induced activation of NADPH oxidase preceded ER stress, which further induced mitochondrial ROS production in hepatocytes. These studies provide new insights into the mechanisms by which uric acid stimulates fat accumulation in the liver.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26539645>Myristic acid potentiates palmitic acid-induced lipotoxicity and steatohepatitis associated with lipodystrophy by sustaning de novo ceramide synthesis.</a></h2><p>Palmitic acid (PA) induces hepatocyte apoptosis and fuels de novo ceramide synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Myristic acid (MA), a free fatty acid highly abundant in copra/palmist oils, is a predictor of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and stimulates ceramide synthesis. Here we investigated the synergism between MA and PA in ceramide synthesis, ER stress, lipotoxicity and NASH. Unlike PA, MA is not lipotoxic but potentiated PA-mediated lipoapoptosis, ER stress, caspase-3 activation and cytochrome c release in primary mouse hepatocytes (PMH). Moreover, MA kinetically sustained PA-induced total ceramide content by stimulating dehydroceramide desaturase and switched the ceramide profile from decreased to increased ceramide 14:0/ceramide16:0, without changing medium and long-chain ceramide species. PMH were more sensitive to equimolar ceramide14:0/ceramide16:0 exposure, which mimics the outcome of PA plus MA treatment on ceramide homeostasis, than to either ceramide alone. Treatment with myriocin to inhibit ceramide synthesis and  to prevent ER stress ameliorated PA plus MA induced apoptosis, similar to the protection afforded by the antioxidant BHA, the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-Fmk and JNK inhibition. Moreover, ruthenium red protected PMH against PA and MA-induced cell death. Recapitulating in vitro findings, mice fed a diet enriched in PA plus MA exhibited lipodystrophy, hepatosplenomegaly, increased liver ceramide content and cholesterol levels, ER stress, liver damage, inflammation and fibrosis compared to mice fed diets enriched in PA or MA alone. The deleterious effects of PA plus MA-enriched diet were largely prevented by in vivo myriocin treatment. These findings indicate a causal link between ceramide synthesis and ER stress in lipotoxicity, and imply that the consumption of diets enriched in MA and PA can cause NASH associated with lipodystrophy.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24865256> attenuates progression of steatohepatitis in mice fed a methionine-choline-deficient diet.</a></h2><p>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been implicated in the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. A methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet induces robust ER stress response and steatohepatitis, but the effects of ER stress modulation on the course of steatohepatitis remain uncertain. The present study evaluated whether reducing ER stress using the chemical chaperone  (TUDCA) could limit hepatocyte lipoapoptosis and progression of MCD diet-induced steatohepatitis.HuH7 cells stably transfected with sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (HuH-Ntcp cells) and palmitate (PA) were used. Experimental steatohepatitis was induced in male C57BL/6 mice using an MCD diet, and three different doses of TUDCA (500, or 1,000 mg/kg, once daily; or 500 mg/kg twice daily) were administered by gavage from the start of the MCD diet regimen or after 4 weeks.TUDCA reduced PA-induced ER stress as manifested by decreased eIF2α phosphorylation, XBP1 splicing and expression of BiP, ATF4, and CHOP in HuH-Ntcp cells. TUDCA also decreased PA-induced JNK phosphorylation, Puma up-regulation and Bax activation, which in turn suppressed caspase-dependent hepatocyte lipoapoptosis. Mice given TUDCA did not show a significant decrease in the intrahepatic triglyceride contents and steatosis. However, TUDCA treatment significantly reduced hepatic damage compared to controls for both early and late treatment groups. TUDCA treatment reduced the expression of ER stress markers and pro-apoptotic proteins, leading to decreased apoptosis and oxidative stress. Finally, TUDCA reduced histological fibrosis along with the down-regulation of pro-fibrotic gene expression in both early and late treatment groups.These results show that TUDCA attenuates the progression of MCD diet-induced steatohepatitis by reducing ER stress.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p></html>
