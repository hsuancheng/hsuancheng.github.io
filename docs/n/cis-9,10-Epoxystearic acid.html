We showed here that CYP709C1 is capable of hydroxylating   at the omega-1 and omega-2 positions. This work was performed after recoding and heterologous expression of a full-length cDNA isolated from a wheat cDNA library in an engineered yeast strain. Investigation on substrate specificity indicates that CYP709C1 metabolizes different   varying in their chain length (C12 to C18) and unsaturation. CYP709C1 is the first identified plant cytochrome P450 that can catalyze sub-terminal hydroxylation of C18  .  is metabolized with the highest efficiency, i.e. K((m)(app)) of 8 microM and V(max(app)) of 328 nmol/min/nmol P450. This, together with the fact that wheat possesses a microsomal peroxygenase able to synthesize this compound from oleic acid, strongly suggests that it is a physiological substrate. Hydroxylated   are implicated in plant defense events. We postulated that CYP709C1 could be involved in plant defense by producing such compounds. This receives support from the observation that (i) sub-terminal hydroxylation of  is induced (15-fold after 3 h) in microsomes of wheat seedlings treated with the stress hormone methyl jasmonate and (ii) CYP709C1 is enhanced at the transcriptional level by this treatment. CYP709C1 transcript also accumulated after treatment with a combination of the safener naphthalic acid anhydride and phenobarbital.

Of the common opportunistic protists associated with AIDS (Cryptosporidium, Toxoplasma, and the microsporidia), more is currently known about the lipids of P. carinii than the others. Lipids that are synthesized by the organism but not by humans are attractive targets for drug development. Thus, the elucidation of delta 7C-24-alykylated sterol and  biosyntheses in P. carinii is currently being examined in detail, since these have been identified as P. carinii-specific lipids. The development of low-toxicity drugs that prevent sterol C-24 alkylation and the specific inhibition of the lipoxygenase that forms  might prove fruitful. Although humans can synthesize coenzyme Q10, the anti-P. carinii activity and low toxicity of ubiquinone analogs such as atovaquone suggest that the electron transport chain in the pathogen may differ importantly from that in the host. Although resistance to atovaquone has been observed, development of other naphthoquinone drugs would provide a broader armamentarium of drugs to treat patients with P. carinii pneumonia. Studies of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and of infected lungs have demonstrated that the infection causes a number of chemical abnormalities. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained after the removal of lung cellular material and the organisms has been shown to contain larger amounts of surfactant proteins and smaller amounts of phospholipids than do comparable samples from P. carinii-free lungs. Increased phospholipase activity, inhibition of surfactant secretion by type II cells, and uptake and catabolism of lipids by the pathogen may explain this phenomenon related to P. carinii pneumonia. Although not yet thoroughly examined, initial studies on the uptake and  of lipids by P. carinii suggest that the organism relies heavily on exogenous  nutrients.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p></html>"><h"<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10476426>.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9854022>Catalytic triad of microsomal epoxide hydrolase: replacement of Glu404 with Asp leads to a strongly increased turnover rate.</a></h2><p>Microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) belongs to the superfamily of alpha/beta-hydrolase fold enzymes. A catalytic triad in the active centre of the enzyme hydrolyses the substrate molecules in a two-step reaction via the intermediate formation of an enzyme-substrate ester. Here we show that the mEH catalytic triad is composed of Asp226, Glu404 and His431. Replacing either of these residues with non-functional amino acids results in a complete loss of activity of the enzyme recombinantly expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For Glu404 and His431 mutants, their structural integrity was demonstrated by their retained ability to form the substrate ester intermediate, indicating that the lack of enzymic activity is due to an indispensable function of either residue in the hydrolytic step of the enzymic reaction. The role of Asp226 as the catalytic nucleophile driving the formation of the ester intermediate was substantiated by the isolation of a peptide fraction carrying the 14C-labelled substrate after cleavage of the ester intermediate with cyanogen bromide. Sequence analysis revealed that one of the two peptides within this sample harboured Asp226. Surprisingly, the replacement of Glu404 with Asp greatly increased the Vmax of the enzyme with styrene 7,8-oxide (23-fold) and 9, 10-epoxystearic acid (39-fold). The increase in Vmax was paralleled by an increase in Km with both substrates, in line with a selective enhancement of the second, rate-limiting step of the enzymic reaction. Owing to its enhanced catalytic properties, the Glu404-->Asp mutant might represent a versatile tool for the enantioselective bio-organic synthesis of chiral fine chemicals. The question of why all native mEHs analysed so far have a Glu in place of the acidic charge relay residue is discussed.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15145985>Human CYP4F3s are the main catalysts in the oxidation of  acid epoxides.</a></h2><p>CYP4F isoforms are involved in the oxidation of important cellular mediators such as leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and prostaglandins.

Kinetic analyses of the progress curves, obtained at low substrate concentrations (i.e. [S] much less than Km), and determination of the enantiomeric excess of the residual substrate by chiral-phase high-performance liquid chromatography at different reaction times, indicate that the epoxide hydrolase hydrates preferentially cis-9R, 10S-epoxystearic acid (V/Km ratio, approximately 20). Interestingly, this enantiomer is obtained by epoxidation of oleic acid catalyzed by peroxygenase, a hydroperoxide-dependent oxidase, we have previously described in soybean (Blée, E., and Schuber, F. (1990) J.Biol. Chem. 265, 12887-12894). For the epoxide hydrolase to show high enantioselectivity there must be a free carboxylic acid functionality on the substrate which probably influences its positioning within the active site. This selectivity, which in principle can be used for kinetic resolution of the  enantiomers, is much reduced with methyl cis-9,10-epoxystearate. 18O-Labeling experiments indicate that water attacks both  enantiomers on the oxirane carbon which has the S-chirality.

One pathway of HNE formation consisted of initial oxygenation of NON into (2E)-4-hydroperoxy-2-nonenal (HPNE) by a novel (3Z)-alkenal oxygenase activity, followed by conversion of HPNE into HNE by a previously recognized hydroperoxide-dependent epoxygenase. The hydroperoxide intermediate was detected in coincubations of NON and oleic acid, in which experiments the HPNE generated from NON supported epoxygenase-catalyzed epoxidation of oleic acid into . Furthermore, by using an enzyme preparation in which the epoxygenase had been inactivated by pretreatment with hydrogen peroxide it was possible to isolate and characterize racemic (4R,4S) HPNE following incubation of NON. Although the (3Z)-alkenal oxygenase resembled a lipoxygenase in its action, it was not inhibited by the lipoxygenase inhibitors, 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid and nordihydroguaiaretic acid. In a second pathway, HNE was produced by rearrangement of 3,4-epoxynonenal, which was in turn formed from NON by a reaction catalyzed by hydroperoxide-dependent epoxygenase. Support for this pathway came from experiments in which 18O-labeled HNE was isolated following coincubation of NON and 13-18O-labeled linoleic acid 13-hydroperoxide. The existence of 3,4-epoxynonenal as a transient intermediate in HNE biosynthesis was further demonstrated by the isolation of 3,4-epoxynonenal (61% (4R)-configuration) as a trapping product in short time incubations interrupted by addition of sodium borohydride. The two  established for biosynthesis of HNE involved the hydroperoxide-reducing and the olefin-epoxidizing activities of hydroperoxide-dependent epoxygenase. In the absence of extraneous olefins and hydroperoxides the two  would be tightly coupled and follow the stoichiometry: 2NON + 1O2-->2HNE.

The nucleophilic nature of sEH catalysis was demonstrated by comparing the enzymatic and nonenzymatic hydrolysis products of tDPPO. The results from single turnover experiments with greater or equal molar equivalents of sEH:substrate were consistent with the existence of a stable intermediate formed by a nucleophilic amino acid attacking the epoxide group. Tryptic digestion of sEH previously subjected to multiple turnovers with tDPPO in H2 18O resulted in the isolation and purification of a tryptic fragment containing Asp-333. Electrospray mass spectrometry of this fragment conclusively illustrated the incorporation of 180. After complete digestion of the latter peptide it was shown that Asp-333 of sEH exhibited an increased mass. The attack by Asp-333 initiates enzymatic activity, leading to the formation of an alpha-hydroxyacyl-enzyme intermediate.

Since hypochlorite did not react with the saturated phospholipid, dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), and the reduction of double bonds in egg yolk phosphatidylcholine liposomes occurred at the same rate in both oxidized and non-oxidized liposomes, it may be suggested that hypochlorite interacted precisely with LPO products.

To gain a better understanding of the biochemical roles of the two classes, NbEH1.1 and NbEH2.1 were isolated from Nicotiana benthamiana and StEH from potato and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant proteins were assayed with a variety of substrates. NbEH1.1 only accepted some aromatic epoxides, and displayed the highest enzyme activity towards phenyl glycidyl ether. In contrast, NbEH2.1 displayed a broad substrate range and similar substrate specificity as StEH. The latter enzymes showed activity towards all fatty acid epoxides examined. The activity (Vmax) of NbEH1.1 towards phenyl glycidyl ether was 10 times higher than that of NbEH2.1. On the contrary, NbEH2.1 converted  with Vmax of 3.83μmolminmg(-1) but NbEH1.1 could not hydrolyze . Expression analysis revealed that NbEH1.1 is induced by infection with tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and wounding, whereas NbEH2.1 is present at a relatively constant level, not influenced by treatment with TMV and wounding. NbEH1.1 transcripts were present predominantly in roots, whereas NbEH2.1 mRNAs were detected primarily in leaves and stems. Overall, these two types of tobacco EH enzymes are distinguished not only by their gene expression, but also by different substrate specificities. EH1 seems not to participate in cutin biosynthesis and it may play a role in generating signals for activation of certain defence and stress responses in tobacco.

CYP77A4 was heterologously expressed in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain (WAT11) engineered for cytochrome P450 expression. Lauric acid (C(12:0)) was converted into a mixture of hydroxylauric acids when incubated with microsomes from yeast expressing CYP77A4. A variety of physiological C(18) fatty acids were tested as potential substrates. Oleic acid (cis-Delta(9)C(18:1)) was converted into a mixture of omega-4- to omega-7-hydroxyoleic acids (75%) and  (25%). Linoleic acid (cis,cis-Delta(9),Delta(12)C(18:2)) was exclusively converted into 12,13-epoxyoctadeca-9-enoic acid, which was then converted into diepoxide after epoxidation of the Delta(9) unsaturation.

Neither stearic acid (C(18:0)) nor linolelaidic acid (trans,trans-Delta(9),Delta(12)C(18:2)) was metabolized, showing that CYP77A4 requires a double bond, in the cis configuration, to metabolize C(18) fatty acids. CYP77A4 was also able to catalyze the in vitro formation of the three mono-epoxides of alpha-linolenic acid (cis,cis,cis-Delta(9),Delta(12),Delta(15)C(18:3)), previously described as antifungal compounds. Epoxides generated by CYP77A4 are further metabolized to the corresponding diols by epoxide hydrolases located in microsomal and cytosolic subcellular fractions from Arabidopsis thaliana.

Microsomal epoxide hydrolase was precipitated with acetone after brief incubation with [1-(14)C]epoxystearic acid.

Pure epoxide hydrolase and crude microsomes showed a single radioactive signal of the expected molecular mass that could be suppressed by inclusion of the competitive inhibitor 1,1,1-trichloropropene oxide in the incubation mixture.

Plant EHs were found to differ in their enantioselectivity, i.e. their ability to discriminate between the two enantiomers of . For example, while the maize enzyme hydrated both enantiomers at the same rate, the EH from soybean exhibited very high enantioselectivity in favour of 9R,10S-epoxystearic acid. This latter enzyme also exhibited a strict stereoselectivity, i.e. it hydrolysed the racemic substrate with a very high enantioconvergence, yielding a single chiral diol product, threo-9R,10R-dihydroxystearic acid. Soybean EH shared these distinctive stereochemical features with the membrane-bound rat liver EH. The stereochemical outcome of these enzymes probably results from a stereoselective attack by the nucleophilic residue on the oxirane ring carbon having the (S)-configuration, leading to the presumed (in plant EH) covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate. In sharp contrast, the reactions catalysed by cytosolic rat liver EH exhibited a complete absence of enantioselectivity and enantioconvergence; this latter effect might be ascribed to a regioselective formation of the acyl-enzyme intermediate involving C-10 of , independent of its configuration.

Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained after the removal of lung cellular material and the organisms has been shown to contain larger amounts of surfactant proteins and smaller amounts of phospholipids than do comparable samples from P. carinii-free lungs. Increased phospholipase activity, inhibition of surfactant secretion by type II cells, and uptake and catabolism of lipids by the pathogen may explain this phenomenon related to P. carinii pneumonia.

Glutathione conjugation reactions.</a></h2><p>A hollow-fiber technique was used in the enzymatic glutathione conjugation of lipophilic toxins. Native enzyme was circulated on the external side of a lipophilic hollow-fiber membrane while the toxin-containing media (blood, plasma or aqueous solution) were circulated inside the fiber. Glutathione conjugation reactions were catalyzed by rat liver cytosol, with a specific glutathione transferase activity of 40 nmol/min/mg protein (acceptor: 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)propane). Clearance rates of 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)propane, phenylglycidether, styrene oxide, cis-9, 10-epoxystearic acid, cis-9, 10-epoxystearic acid methyl ester, 5a, 6a-cholesterol oxide, 16-, 17a-pregnenolone oxide, and p-nitrobenzylchloride were 10.44, 13.37, 32.25, 7.60, 7.31, 3.92, 4.20 and 29.24 nmol/mg protein/h/cm2 hollow-fiber surface respectively. This technique makes possible glutathione conjugation reactions with crude enzyme preparations over long periods without loss of activity from covalent immobilization and without loss of cofactor from (auto)oxidation. The lipophilic membrane ensures the absence of hemolysis, immunological hazards and hormone loss, while elimination of the toxin is not impaired.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11358528>CYP94A5, a new cytochrome P450 from Nicotiana tabacum is able to catalyze the oxidation of fatty acids to the omega-alcohol and to the corresponding diacid.</a></h2><p>A full length cDNA encoding a new cytochrome P450-dependent fatty acid hydroxylase (CYP94A5) was isolated from a tobacco cDNA library.

Comparison between these five P450s at constant P450 content over a range of concentrations for individual fatty acids indicates that binding of different fatty acids to CYP86A2 always results in a higher proportion of high spin state heme than binding titrations conducted with CYP86A1 or CYP86A4. In comparison to these three, CYP86A7 and CYP86A8 produce extremely low proportions of high spin state heme even with the most effectively bound fatty acids. In addition to their previously demonstrated lauric acid hydroxylase activities, all CYP86A proteins are capable of hydroxylating oleic acid but not oxygenated . Homology models have been built for these five enzymes that metabolize unsubstituted fatty acids and sometimes bind oxygenated fatty acids. Comparison of the substrate binding modes and predicted substrate access channels indicate that all use channel pw2a consistent with the crystal structures and models of other fatty acid-metabolizing P450s in bacteria and mammals. Among these P450s, those that bind internally oxygenated fatty acids contain polar residues in their substrate binding cavity that help stabilize these charged/polar groups within their largely hydrophobic catalytic site.2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10432296>Production in vitro by the cytochrome P450 CYP94A1 of major C18 cutin monomers and potential messengers in plant-pathogen interactions: enantioselectivity studies.</a></h2><p>The major C(18) cutin monomers are 18-hydroxy-9,10-epoxystearic and 9,10,18-trihydroxystearic acids. These compounds are also known messengers in plant-pathogen interactions. We have previously shown that their common precursor  was formed by the epoxidation of oleic acid in Vicia sativa microsomes (Pinot, Salaün, Bosch, Lesot, Mioskowski and Durst (1992) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 184, 183-193). Here we determine the chirality of the epoxide produced as (9R,10S) and (9S,10R) in the ratio 90:10 respectively. We further show that microsomes from yeast expressing the cytochrome P450 CYP94A1 are capable of hydroxylating the methyl terminus of 9,10-epoxystearic and 9,10-dihydroxystearic acids in the presence of NADPH to form the corresponding 18-hydroxy derivatives. The reactions were not catalysed by microsomes from yeast transformed with a void plasmid or in absence of NADPH. After incubation of a synthetic racemic mixture of  with microsomes of yeast expressing CYP94A1, the chirality of the residual epoxide was shifted to 66:34 in favour of the (9S,10R) enantiomer. Both enantiomers were incubated separately and V(max)/K(m) values of 16 and 3.42 ml/min per nmol of P450 for (9R, 10S) and (9S,10R) respectively were determined, demonstrating that CYP94A1 is enantioselective for the (9R,10S) enantiomer, which is preferentially formed in V. sativa microsomes. Compared with the epoxide, the diol 9,10-dihydroxystearic acid was a much poorer substrate for the omega-hydroxylase, with a measured V(max)/K(m) of 0.33 ml/min per nmol of P450. Our results indicate that the activity of CYP94A1 is strongly influenced by the stereochemistry of the 9, 10-epoxide and the nature of substituents on carbons 9 and 10, with V(max)/K(m) values for epoxide>>oleic acid>diol.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p></html>"><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8463229>Oxygenation of (3Z)-nonenal to (2E)-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal in the broad bean (Vicia faba L.).</a></h2><p>Incubation of (3Z)-nonenal (NON) with the 269,000-g particle fraction of seed homogenate of the broad bean (Vicia faba L.) afforded (2E)-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) as the principal product. One pathway of HNE formation consisted of initial oxygenation of NON into (2E)-4-hydroperoxy-2-nonenal (HPNE) by a novel (3Z)-alkenal oxygenase activity, followed by conversion of HPNE into HNE by a previously recognized hydroperoxide-dependent epoxygenase. The hydroperoxide intermediate was detected in coincubations of NON and oleic acid, in which experiments the HPNE generated from NON supported epoxygenase-catalyzed epoxidation of oleic acid into . Furthermore, by using an enzyme preparation in which the epoxygenase had been inactivated by pretreatment with hydrogen peroxide it was possible to isolate and characterize racemic (4R,4S) HPNE following incubation of NON. Although the (3Z)-alkenal oxygenase resembled a lipoxygenase in its action, it was not inhibited by the lipoxygenase inhibitors, 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid and nordihydroguaiaretic acid. In a second pathway, HNE was produced by rearrangement of 3,4-epoxynonenal, which was in turn formed from NON by a reaction catalyzed by hydroperoxide-dependent epoxygenase. Support for this pathway came from experiments in which 18O-labeled HNE was isolated following coincubation of NON and 13-18O-labeled linoleic acid 13-hydroperoxide. The existence of 3,4-epoxynonenal as a transient intermediate in HNE biosynthesis was further demonstrated by the isolation of 3,4-epoxynonenal (61% (4R)-configuration) as a trapping product in short time incubations interrupted by addition of sodium borohydride. The two  established for biosynthesis of HNE involved the hydroperoxide-reducing and the olefin-epoxidizing activities of hydroperoxide-dependent epoxygenase. In the absence of extraneous olefins and hydroperoxides the two  would be tightly coupled and follow the stoichiometry: 2NON + 1O2-->2HNE. It was also shown that the V. faba particle fraction catalyzed oxygenation of (3Z)-hexenal into (2E)-4-hydroxy-2-hexenal.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5782360>Gas--liquid chromatography--mass spectrophotometry of hydroxylated octadecanols derived from hydroxylated stearic acids.</a></h2><p>A gas-liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometric method of determining the position of oxygen atoms on polyfunctional fatty acids has been explored.
