[¹⁴C] and [³H]glycerol radiolabeling experiments established that PE synthesis and turnover are reduced in primary hepatocytes isolated from Pcyt2-deficient (Pcyt2+/⁻) mice relative to littermate controls. [³H]Glycerol radiolabeling revealed an increased formation of both DAG and triglyceride (TAG) and only increased turnover of DAG, consistent with elevated TAG accumulation. [³H]Acetate radiolabeling showed that de novo fatty acid (FA) synthesis also increased in Pcyt2-deficient hepatocytes. Overexpression of a Myc/His-tagged Pcyt2 complementary DNA into deficient hepatocytes increased Pcyt2 protein expression; normalized PE synthesis and turnover; and reduced FA, DAG, and TAG synthesis. Although increased Pcyt2-myc/His complementary DNA expression normalized lipid homeostasis, a Pcyt2 mutant with 60% catalytic activity (H244Y) was unable to normalize any of the parameters investigated. Only when PE synthesis was fully reestablished did the lipogenic gene expression and the formation of FA, DAG, and TAG revert to the levels of wild-type hepatocytes. These data unambiguously establish that the TAG accumulation present in Pcyt2-deficient hepatocytes is a direct consequence of Pcyt2 gene deficiency and reduced functioning of the de novo Kennedy pathway.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Although β2-adrenergic receptor agonists reduce adipose tissue mass in birds, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The aim of the current study was to examine the effects of a single intraperitoneal injection of the β2-adrenergic receptor agonist, clenbuterol, on the abdominal fat pad tissue development. Thirty-three chicks at 1-day-old were given a single intraperitoneal injection of clenbuterol (0.1mg/kg body weight) or phosphate-buffered saline. At 2 weeks post-dose, the weight of the abdominal fat tissue was decreased in the clenbuterol-injected chicks, and small adipocyte-like cells were observed in the abdominal fat pad tissue of the clenbuterol-injected chicks. Then, the expression of mRNAs encoding genes related to avian  was examined in the abdominal fat pat tissue. The expression of mRNAs encoding Krüppel-like zinc finger transcription factor 5 (KLF-5), KLF-15, and zinc finger protein 423 in the abdominal fat pad tissue of the clenbuterol-injected chicks was significantly lower (P<0.05) than that of the control chicks, while the expression of mRNA encoding peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma was not affected. In addition, both mRNA expression (P<0.05) and enzymatic activity (P<0.05) of fatty acid synthase (FAS) were decreased in the abdominal fat pad tissue of the clenbuterol-injected chicks, while clenbuterol injection did not affect FAS activity in liver. These results suggested that a single injection with clenbuterol into newly hatched chicks reduces their abdominal fat pad mass possibly via disrupting adipocyte development during later growth stages.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we examined the influence of Pctp expression on the function and structure of brown adipose tissue (BAT), a mitochondrial-rich, oxidative tissue that mediates nonshivering thermogenesis. Consistent with increased thermogenesis, Pctp(-/-) mice exhibited higher core body temperatures than wild-type controls at room temperature. During a 24 h cold challenge, Pctp(-/-) mice defended core body temperature efficiently enough that acute, full activation of BAT thermogenic genes did not occur. Brown adipocytes lacking Pctp harbored enlarged and elongated mitochondria. Consistent with increased fatty acid utilization, brown adipocytes cultured from Pctp(-/-) mice exhibited higher oxygen consumption rates in response to norepinephrine. The absence of Pctp expression during brown  in vitro altered the expression of key transcription factors, which could be corrected by adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Pctp early but not late during the differentiation.

Pigs fed ractopamine in a 170 g protein/kg diet had a greater plasma nonesterified fatty acid response to isoproterenol challenge than pigs fed the same dietary protein but without ractopamine. There was an attenuation of plasma glucose and lactate responses to isoproterenol by chronic ractopamine feeding at both protein concentrations. Ractopamine feeding had no effect on basal lipolysis and  in vitro. Lipolysis was elevated and  was depressed by isoproterenol.

Here we investigate both the in vitro and in vivo effects of corticosterone (Cort) on adipose tissue metabolism. Cort increased 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation in a concentration-dependent manner, but did not increase  in adipocytes. Cort increased lipolysis within adipocytes in a concentration-dependent manner (maximum effect at 1-10 μM). Surprisingly, removal of Cort further increased lipolytic rates (∼320% above control, P < 0.05), indicating a residual effect on basal lipolysis. mRNA and protein expression of adipose triglyceride lipase and phosphorylated status of hormone sensitive lipase (Ser563/Ser660) were increased with 48 h of Cort treatment. To test these responses in vivo, Sprague-Dawley rats were subcutaneously implanted with wax pellets with/without Cort (300 mg). After 10 days, adipose depots were removed and cultured ex vivo. Both free fatty acids and glycerol concentrations were elevated in fed and fasting conditions in Cort-treated rats. Despite increased lipolysis, Cort rats had more visceral adiposity than sham rats (10.2 vs. 6.9 g/kg body wt, P < 0.05). Visceral adipocytes from Cort rats were smaller and more numerous than those in sham rats, suggesting that  occurred through preadipocyte differentiation rather than adipocyte hypertrophy. Visceral, but not subcutaneous, adipocyte cultures from Cort-treated rats displayed a 1.5-fold increase in basal lipolytic rates compared with sham rats (P < 0.05).

Catecholamines stimulate adipocyte lipolysis through reversible phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase, and simultaneously inhibit LPL activity. However, LPL regulation is complex and previous studies have described translational regulation of LPL in response to catecholamines because of an RNA-binding protein that interacts with the 3'-untranslated region of LPL mRNA. In this study, we identified several protein components of an LPL RNA binding complex. Using an LPL RNA affinity column, we identified two of the RNA-binding proteins as the catalytic (C) subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), and A kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) 121/149, one of the PKA anchoring proteins, which has known RNA binding activity. To determine whether the C subunit was involved in LPL translation inhibition, the C subunit was depleted from the cytoplasmic extract of epinephrine-stimulated adipocytes by immunoprecipitation. This resulted in the loss of LPL translation inhibition activity of the extract, along with decreased RNA binding activity in a gel shift assay. To demonstrate the importance of the AKAPs, inhibition of PKA-AKAP binding with a peptide competitor (HT31) prevented epinephrine-mediated inhibition of LPL translation. C subunit kinase activity was necessary for LPL RNA binding and translation inhibition, suggesting that the phosphorylation of AKAP121/149 or other proteins was an important part of RNA binding complex formation. The hormonal activation of PKA results in the reversible phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase, which is the primary mediator of adipocyte lipolysis.

While much is known about the acute regulation of these processes during fasting and feeding, less is understood about the transcriptional basis by which adipocytes control lipid handling. Here, we show that interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) is a critical determinant of the transcriptional response to nutrient availability in adipocytes. Fasting induces IRF4 in an insulin- and FoxO1-dependent manner. IRF4 is required for lipolysis, at least in part due to direct effects on the expression of adipocyte triglyceride lipase and hormone-sensitive lipase. Conversely, reduction of IRF4 enhances lipid synthesis. Mice lacking adipocyte IRF4 exhibit increased adiposity and deficient lipolysis. These studies establish a link between IRF4 and the disposition of calories in adipose tissue, with consequences for systemic metabolic homeostasis.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

NAFLD is generally exhibited by non-progressive simple steatosis. However, a significant subset of patient's progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that is defined by the presence of steatosis, inflammation and hepatocyte injury with fibrosis. Unfortunately, there are no approved therapies for NAFLD or NASH and therefore therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Niclosamide is an U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anthelmintic drug that mediates its effect by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation. Niclosamide and its salt forms, Niclosamide  (NEN), and Niclosamide Piperazine (NPP) have shown efficacy in murine models of diet induced obesity characterized by attenuation of the prominent fatty liver disease phenotype and improved glucose metabolism. While the exact mechanism(s) underlying these changes remains unclear, the ability to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation leading to increased energy expenditure and lipid metabolism or attenuation of PKA mediated glucagon signaling in the liver have been proposed. Unfortunately, niclosamide has very poor water solubility, leading to low oral bioavailability. This, in addition to mitochondrial uncoupling activity and potential genotoxicity have reduced enthusiasm for its clinical use. More recently, salt forms of niclosamide, NEN and NPP, have demonstrated improved oral bioavailability while retaining activity. This suggests that development of safer more effective niclosamide derivatives for the treatment of NAFLD and Type 2 Diabetes may be possible. Herein we explored the ability of a series of N-substituted phenylbenzamide derivatives of the niclosamide salicylanilide chemotype to attenuate hepatic steatosis using a novel phenotypic in vitro model of fatty liver and the high fat diet-fed mouse model of diet induced obesity.

This lipogenic inhibition was also observed in isolated mammary acini, where it was accompanied by decreased glucose uptake. These inhibitions were completely reversed by incubation with insulin. Insulin had no effect on the rate of glucose transport into acini, nor on pyruvate dehydrogenase activity as estimated by the accumulation of pyruvate and lactate, suggesting that these are not the sites of lipogenic inhibition. Insulin stimulated the incorporation of [1-14C]acetate into lipid in acini from high-fat-fed rats.

Plasma glucose increased 3 min after the seizure onset and rose to a peak after 10 min.

In conclusion, it can be inferred from these results that (a) the increase in plasma glucose after stimulation might result from sequential interaction of autonomic activation at seizure onset; (b) excessive muscular activity was at least partially responsible for the steady rise in plasma lactate concentrations; (c) audiogenic seizures, which increase adrenergic activity, induce desensitization of the beta-adrenergic lipolytic pathway in epididymal adipose tissue; (d) genetic selection for audiogenic seizure susceptibility results in pronounced alterations at multiple levels of metabolic regulation.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22975064>Thermogenic characterization of ghrelin receptor null mice.</a></h2><p>Ghrelin is the only known circulating orexigenic hormone that increases food intake and promotes adiposity, and these physiological functions of ghrelin are mediated through its receptor growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R). Ghrelin/GHS-R signaling plays a crucial role in energy homeostasis. Old GHS-R null mice exhibit a healthy phenotype-lean and insulin sensitive. Interestingly, the GHS-R null mice have increased energy expenditure, yet exhibit no difference in food intake or locomotor activity compared to wild-type mice.

Indeed, the BAT of old GHS-R null mice reveals enhanced thermogenic capacity, which is consistent with the gene expression profile of increases in glucose/lipid uptake, , and lipolysis in BAT. The data collectively suggest that ghrelin/GHS-R signaling has important roles in thermogenesis. The recent discovery that BAT also regulates energy homeostasis in adult humans makes the BAT a new antiobesity target.

In adipocytes, an increased amount of cAMP is associated with increased lipolysis. In this work we evaluated the effects of PACAP38 on triglyceride metabolism in primary rat adipocytes. Stimulation of adipocytes with PACAP (0.1-100 nm) resulted in stimulation of lipolysis to the same extent as isoproterenol. Lipolysis was blocked by 25 microm of the protein kinase A inhibitor H-89 and potentiated in the presence of 10 microm OPC3911, a phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor. In addition, PACAP38 induced activation of protein kinase A. Insulin efficiently inhibited PACAP38-induced lipolysis in a phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase and phosphodiesterase 3-dependent manner.

Unlike other cells, e.g. 3T3-F442A fibroblast, in which GH is believed to initiate cell differentiation through activation of the Janus tyrosine kinase-2 (JAK2), the adipocytes are metabolically active and fully differentiated cells that do not proliferate. Thus, it cannot be assumed that the same molecular mechanisms relay the acute insulin-like effects of GH. In adipocytes responsive to these effects, we found that GH induced tyrosine phosphorylation of a 114-kilodalton membrane protein, identified as the GH receptor, and a 130-kilodalton cytosolic protein, identified as JAK2. In contrast, these phosphorylations were not seen in adipocytes refractory to these effects of GH. The GH concentration dependency (ED50,1-2 nM) of these phosphorylations coincided with the increase in  and the decrease in noradrenaline-induced lipolysis caused by the hormone. In analogy with the effects of insulin, the onset of phosphorylation was rapid (t1/2, < 1 min) and preceded the metabolic responses. The observations that a small fraction of the receptor pool became tyrosine phosphorylated and that the level of phosphorylation induced by GH decreased at higher GH concentrations agree with the concept that GH-induced dimerization of the receptor is necessary for signal transduction. We conclude that tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 and the GH receptor seems to be involved in the signal transduction mechanism leading to the insulin-like effects of GH in adipocytes. Importantly, the signal pathways for GH and insulin clearly differ at the receptor level, but seem to converge at or before the level of insulin receptor substrate 1 or 2 phosphorylation that has been shown to occur in response to both of these hormones.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10852455>Fuel homeostasis during physical inactivity induced by bed rest.</a></h2><p>The consequences of physical inactivity on fuel homeostasis were evaluated during 7 days of head-down bed rest (HDBR), a model mimicking weightlessness.

The glucose load was labeled with 13C and associated with D-[6,6-2H2] glucose infusion, indirect calorimetry, breath tests, and plasma measurements to determine the glucose turnover and biodisponibility, substrate oxidation, and endocrine responses. Body composition was assessed using H2(18)O dilution. In addition, hormones were measured in daily blood and 24-h urine samples. No change in body composition was noted. Daily fasting insulin increased during HDBR (men, 34%; women, 26%), as did the insulin to glucose ratio (men, 30%; women, 25%). The normetanephrine level dropped (men, 30%; women, 16%), but metanephrine was unchanged.

There is good support for the idea that activated PPARgamma promotes  also in brown adipose tissue. However, the issue is more complex concerning the full differentiation to the brown adipocyte phenotype, particularly the expression of the brown-fat-specific marker UCP1. The effect of norepinephrine on PPARgamma gene expression, at least in-vitro, is negative, PPARgamma-ablated brown adipose tissue can express UCP1, and PGC-1alpha coactivates other transcription factors (including PPARalpha); thus, the significance of PPARgamma for the physiological control of UCP1 gene expression is not settled. However, importantly, the effects of PPAR agonists demonstrate the existence of a pathway for brown adipose tissue recruitment that is not dependent on chronic adrenergic stimulation and may be active in recruitment conditions such as prenatal and prehibernation recruitment. The ability of chronic PPARgamma agonist treatment to promote the occurrence of brown-fat features in white adipose tissue-like depots implies a role in anti-obesity treatment, but this will only be effective if the extra thermogenic capacity is activated by adrenergic stimulation.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16840651>Effects of central or peripheral leptin administration on norepinephrine turnover in defined fat depots.</a></h2><p>Leptin preserves lean tissue but decreases adipose tissue by increasing lipolysis and/or inhibiting . The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is a primary regulator of lipolysis, but it is not known if leptin increases norepinephrine turnover (NETO) in white adipose tissue. In this study, we examined the effect of leptin administered either as a chronic physiological dose (40 microg/day for 4 days from ip miniosmotic pumps) or as an acute injection in the third ventricle (1.5 microg injected two times daily for 2 days) on NETO and the size of brown and white fat depots in male Sprague Dawley rats. NETO was determined from the decline in tissue norepinephrine (NE) during 4 h following administration of the NE synthesis inhibitor alpha-methyl-para-tryrosine. The centrally injected leptin-treated animals demonstrated more dramatic reductions in food intake, body weight, and fat pad size and an increase in NETO compared with the peripherally infused animals. Neither route of leptin administration caused a uniform increase in NETO across all fat pads tested, and in both treatment conditions leptin decreased the size of certain fat pads independent of an increase in NETO. Similar discrepancies in white fat NETO were found for rats pair fed to leptin-treated animals.

In this study, the different glucose metabolic pathways and their regulation by insulin and norepinephrine were examined in isolated rat brown adipocytes, using [6-14C]glucose as a tracer. Glucose utilization was stimulated for insulin concentrations in the range of 40-1000 microU/ml. Furthermore, the addition of adenosine deaminase (200 mU/ml) or adenosine (10 microM) did not alter insulin sensitivity of glucose metabolism. The major effect of insulin (1 mU/ml) was a respective 7-fold and 5-fold stimulation of  and lactate synthesis, whereas glucose oxidation remained very low. The 5-fold stimulation of total glucose metabolism by 1 mU/ml of insulin was accompanied by an 8-fold increase in glucose transport. In the presence of norepinephrine (8 microM), total glucose metabolism was increased 2-fold. This was linked to a 7-fold increase of glucose oxidation, whereas  was greatly inhibited (by 72%). In addition, norepinephrine alone did not modify glucose transport. The addition of insulin to adipocytes incubated with norepinephrine, induced a potentiation of glucose oxidation, while  remained very low. In conclusion, in the presence of insulin and norepinephrine glucose is a oxidative substrate for brown adipose tissue.

In adults, GH treatment reduces abdominal obesity and improves insulin sensitivity, as well as blood lipid profiles.

In this study, seven prepubertal severely obese boys aged 10-12 yr were treated with GH for 6 months and followed for an additional 6 months. No diet or exercise modifications were initiated. Body fat percentage decreased from 51.3% to 46.1% after treatment (P = 0.03). Frequently sampled iv glucose tolerance tests revealed an increased responsivity of the acute insulin secretion (P = 0.04) and a nonsignificant trend toward improved insulin sensitivity.

Lipid overload induces insulin resistance in muscle and alters the composition of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). To test the hypothesis that skeletal muscle phospholipid metabolism regulates systemic glucose metabolism, we perturbed choline/ phosphotransferase 1 (CEPT1), the terminal enzyme in the Kennedy pathway of phospholipid synthesis. In C2C12 cells, CEPT1 knockdown altered SR phospholipid composition and calcium flux. In mice, diet-induced obesity, which decreases insulin sensitivity, increased muscle CEPT1 expression. In high-fat diet-fed mice with skeletal muscle-specific knockout of CEPT1, systemic and muscle-based approaches demonstrated increased muscle insulin sensitivity. In CEPT1-deficient muscles, an altered SR phospholipid milieu decreased sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase-dependent calcium uptake, activating calcium-signaling pathways known to improve insulin sensitivity. Altered muscle SR calcium handling also rendered these mice exercise intolerant. In obese humans, surgery-induced weight loss increased insulin sensitivity and decreased skeletal muscle CEPT1 protein. In obese humans spanning a spectrum of metabolic health, muscle CEPT1 mRNA was inversely correlated with insulin sensitivity. These results suggest that high-fat feeding and obesity induce CEPT1, which remodels the SR to preserve contractile function at the expense of insulin sensitivity.© 2016 by the American Diabetes Association.

Cows responded to treatment by increasing daily milk yield by 10.9 kg, although net energy intake was not changed. Thus, net energy balance was changed from highly positive to slightly negative (+7.7 to -1.1 Mcal/d). Consistent with these changes in net energy balance,  rates were dramatically reduced (97%) in adipose tissue from bST-treated cows. Activities of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (initial and total) and fatty acid synthase were also dramatically decreased. Therefore, for cows in positive energy balance, reduced lipid synthesis in adipose tissue represents a major mechanism whereby bST alters nutrient partitioning to support greater milk synthesis. Treatment with bST had no effect on beta-adrenergic-stimulated lipolysis in adipose tissue explants incubated in vitro with adenosine deaminase. However, bST treatment reduced the ability of adenosine to inhibit lipolysis in adipose tissue, which involved changes in both sensitivity and responsiveness to adenosine. Therefore, the enhanced lipolytic response to catecholamine in vivo with bST treatment relates to relief in the adenosine inhibitory signaling cascade rather than to a direct effect on the stimulatory signaling pathway.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29026134>MCT1 and MCT4 Expression and Lactate Flux Activity Increase During White and Brown  and Impact Adipocyte Metabolism.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue takes up glucose and releases lactate, thereby contributing significantly to systemic glucose and lactate homeostasis. This implies the necessity of upregulation of net acid and lactate flux capacity during adipocyte differentiation and function. However, the regulation of lactate- and acid/base transporters in adipocytes is poorly understood. Here, we tested the hypothesis that adipocyte thermogenesis, browning and differentiation are associated with an upregulation of plasma membrane lactate and acid/base transport capacity that in turn is important for adipocyte metabolism. The mRNA and protein levels of the lactate-H transporter MCT1 and the Na,HCO cotransporter NBCe1 were upregulated in mouse interscapular brown and inguinal white adipose tissue upon cold induction of thermogenesis and browning. MCT1, MCT4, and NBCe1 were furthermore strongly upregulated at the mRNA and protein level upon differentiation of cultured pre-adipocytes. Adipocyte differentiation was accompanied by increased plasma membrane lactate flux capacity, which was reduced by MCT inhibition and by MCT1 knockdown. Finally, in differentiated brown adipocytes, glycolysis (assessed as ECAR), and after noradrenergic stimulation also oxidative metabolism (OCR), was decreased by MCT inhibition.

Results of the present study revealed that resveratrol reduced glucose conversion to lipids in adipocytes, probably due to disturbed mitochondrial metabolism of the sugar. Moreover, resveratrol increased epinephrine-induced lipolysis. This effect was found also in the presence of insulin and resulted from the synergistic action of resveratrol and epinephrine. The obtained results provided evidence that resveratrol affects  and lipolysis in adipocytes contributing to reduced lipid accumulation in these cells.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8853846>Endocrine regulation of fetal adipose tissue metabolism in the pig: ontogeny of thyroxine influence.</a></h2><p>Our previous studies indicated that thyroxine (T4) markedly enhanced adipose tissue development and metabolism when administered to hypophysectomized fetal pigs from days 70 to 90 of gestation. In this study, hypophysectomized (day 70) fetal pigs were implanted with T4 pellets, and blood and adipose tissue samples were obtained upon removal on days 73, 75, 80, or 85 of gestation to examine the time course of T4 response. T4 treatment in hypophysectomized fetuses resulted in an elevation in serum T4 levels by day 73 of gestation, with no further increase on day 80 or 85.

However, it was not clear whether this modulation of adipocyte metabolism by dietary calcium is a direct effect of inhibition of 1alpha,25-(OH)2-D3-induced [Ca2+]i. Accordingly, we have now evaluated the direct role of 1alpha,25-(OH)2-D3. Human adipocytes exhibited a 1alpha,25-(OH)2-D3 dose-responsive (1-50 nM) increase in [Ca2+]i (P<0.01). This action was mimicked by 1alpha,25-dihyroxylumisterol3 (1alpha,25-(OH)2-lumisterol3) (P<0.001), a specific agonist for a putative membrane vitamin D receptor (mVDR), and completely prevented by 1b,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1beta,25-(OH)2-D3), a specific antagonist for the mVDR. Similarly, 1alpha,25-(OH)2-D3 (5 nM) caused 50%-100% increases in adipocyte fatty acid synthase (FAS) expression and activity (P<0.02), a 61% increase in glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) activity (P<0.01), and an 80% inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis (P<0.001), whereas 1beta,25-(OH)2-D3 completely blocked all these effects. Notably, 1alpha,25-(OH)2-lumisterol3 exerted more potent effects in modulating adipocyte lipid metabolism, with 2.5- to 3.0-fold increases in FAS expression and activity (P<0.001) and a threefold increase in GPDH activity (P<0.001). Also 1alpha,25-(OH)2-lumisterol3 was approximately twice as potent in inhibiting basal lipolysis (P<0.025), whereas 1beta,25-(OH)2-D3 completely blocked all these effects. These data suggest that 1alpha,25-(OH)2-D3 modulates adipocyte Ca2+ signaling and, consequently, exerts a coordinated control over  and lipolysis. Thus, a direct inhibition of 1alpha,25-(OH)2-D3-induced [Ca2+]i may contribute to an anti-obesity effect of dietary calcium, and the mVDR may represent an important target for obesity.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17241878>Insulin resistance accelerates a dietary rat model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>The increasing prevalence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is due to the epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes, both of which are associated with insulin resistance.To clarify the causal relationship between insulin resistance and the development of NASH, steatohepatitis was induced in obese diabetic Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) and nondiabetic control Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats by feeding them a methionine and choline-deficient (MCD) diet. Insulin sensitivity of the rats was altered by adding a high-fat (HF) diet or the peroxisomal-proliferator activated receptor-gamma agonist pioglitazone to the MCD diet.The MCD diet-induced steatohepatitis was accelerated in OLETF rats after 8 weeks. Steatosis preceded inflammation, which led to fibrosis and the development of steatohepatitis. The hepatic gene expression for transforming growth factor-beta, alpha1 procollagen and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 was up-regulated in OLETF rats compared with LETO rats. The MCD + HF diet further enhanced insulin resistance and led to rapid development of pre-cirrhosis in OLETF rats by increasing the triglyceride pool, activating stellate cells, and up-regulating gene expression for sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c and fatty acid synthase in the liver. In contrast, pioglitazone attenuated the MCD diet-induced steatohepatitis in OLETF rats but not in LETO rats by reversing the underlying pathogenesis involved in this model through improvement of insulin resistance. These results confirm a link between insulin resistance and the development/progression of steatohepatitis, at least partly via up-regulation of genes for , inflammation, and fibrogenesis, in animal models.Insulin resistance and/or diabetes may accelerate the entire pathologic spectrum of NASH.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10195377>Carbohydrate-induced thermogenesis in obese women.

A number of factors have been postulated to mediate the obligatory and facultative component of thermogenesis. This study was designed to investigate some further factors mediating the carbohydrate-induced thermogenesis in obese women. In 13 obese women, thermogenic responses to glucose and fructose were compared and related to subsequent hormonal changes. The thermogenic effect after fructose ingestion was significantly (p<0.006) higher in comparison with glucose, despite lower values for both glucose and insulin concentrations. Carbohydrate oxidation was significantly higher after fructose (81+/-7 E% vs 62+/-10 E% p<0.01) while oxidation of fat was lower (10+/-9 E% vs 21+/-12 E% p<0.01). These effects may partly be due to the de novo  and/or to changes in cellular metabolism. No clear relationship could be found between thermogenesis and the activity of the sympathetic nervous system, as expressed by urinary catecholamine levels.

In both studies, all non-protein calories were administered as glucose, and subjects were divided into two groups, classified according to the amount of caloric supplementation after surgical stress, i.e., either overfed or appropriate (groups C1 and C2, respectively, in the clinical study, and groups E1 and E2, respectively, in the experimental study). In the clinical study, the postoperative energy expenditure in group C1 increased from the preoperative value, becoming significantly more elevated than that in group C2. The respiratory quotient (RQ) in group C1 exceeded 1.0, representing  from carbohydrate, and the plasma norepinephrine concentration was also higher in group C1, indicating that lipolysis was likely to have been enhanced in this milieu. These findings imply that  and lipolysis can occur simultaneously, constituting a futile cycle, and that this activated cycle could be a reason for the increased energy expenditure associated with overfeeding after surgical stress. To gather further evidence, we evaluated the rate of  and lipolytic activity in white and brown adipose tissue (WAT; BAT) in an experimental study of surgically stressed rats. In BAT, both  and lipolysis were activated in group E1.

In interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT), cold exposure increased proliferation of endothelial cells and interstitial cells expressing platelet-derived growth factor receptor, α polypeptide (PDGFRα) by 3- to 4-fold. Surprisingly, brown  and angiogenesis were largely restricted to the dorsal edge of iBAT. Although cold stress did not increase proliferation in inguinal white adipose tissue (ingWAT), the percentage of BAs, defined as multilocular adipocytes that express uncoupling protein 1, rose from undetectable to 30% of total adipocytes. To trace the origins of cold-induced BAs, we genetically tagged PDGFRα(+) cells and adipocytes prior to cold exposure, using Pdgfra-Cre recombinase estrogen receptor T2 fusion protein (CreER(T2)) and adiponectin-CreER(T2), respectively. In iBAT, cold stress triggered the proliferation and differentiation of PDGFRα(+) cells into BAs. In contrast, all newly observed BAs in ingWAT (5207 out of 5207) were derived from unilocular adipocytes tagged by adiponectin-CreER(T2)-mediated recombination. Surgical denervation of iBAT reduced cold-induced brown  by >85%, whereas infusion of norepinephrine (NE) mimicked the effects of cold in warm-adapted mice. NE-induced de novo brown  in iBAT was eliminated in mice lacking β1-adrenergic receptors. These observations identify a novel tissue niche for brown  in iBAT and further define depot-specific mechanisms of BA recruitment.© FASEB.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26433410>Effects of acute heat stress on lipid metabolism of bovine primary adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Heat stress (HS) affects numerous physiological processes including nutrient partitioning and lipid metabolism.

Adipocytes were incubated with increasing isoproterenol (ISO), and with increasing concentrations of insulin in the presence of ISO to evaluate changes in lipolysis. Incorporation of radioactive acetate into lipids was measured as an indicator of . Abundance and phosphorylation of several lipolytic and lipogenic proteins were also measured. Adipocytes exposed to HS had an elevated maximal response to ISO and were more sensitive to lipolytic stimulation by ISO compared with cells cultured at TN. Thermal treatment did not affect the antilipolytic effects of insulin in the presence of ISO.  measured as acetate incorporation was not altered by HS, but a temperature by insulin interaction was observed for the regulation of acetyl CoA carboxylase, such that the presence of insulin resulted in a reduction in phosphorylation of acetyl CoA carboxylase in adipocytes cultured at TN but not HS conditions.

We report a straightforward and efficient protocol to generate functional human beige adipocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Without overexpression of exogenous adipogenic genes, our method recapitulates an adipogenic developmental pathway through successive mesodermal and adipogenic progenitor stages. hiPSC-derived adipocytes are insulin sensitive and display beige-specific markers and functional properties, including upregulation of thermogenic genes, increased mitochondrial content, and increased oxygen consumption upon activation with cAMP analogs.

However, elucidation of the molecular mode of action of these phospho-inositolglycan (PIG) molecules has been hampered by 1) lack of knowledge of their exact structure; 2) variable action profiles; and 3) rather modest effects. In the present study, these problems were circumvented by preparation of PIG-peptides (PIG-P) in sufficient quantity by sequential proteolytic (V8 protease) and lipolytic (phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C) cleavage of the GPI-anchored plasma membrane protein, Gce1p, from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

It possesses lipogenic/lipolytic capacity and, although adiponutrin polymorphisms are related to obesity, its physiological role is not clear. To help clarify its role, we studied the effect of acute cold exposure on adiponutrin mRNA expression in different adipose tissues of lean/obese Zucker rats subjected to feeding/fasting/refeeding. The effect of cold on the expression of key lipogenic enzymes and on uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) was evaluated in selected adipose depots. Adiponutrin mRNA levels were also determined in the adipose tissue of isoprenaline-treated rats and in cultured adipocytes treated with noradrenaline, isoprenaline and a selective β3-adrenoceptor (AR) agonist. Adiponutrin expression was strongly down-regulated by cold in the different adipose depots in lean animals, while this down-regulation was impaired in obese rats. Adiponutrin pattern of expression in response to cold correlated positively with that of the lipogenic enzymes and negatively with UCP1 expression. Acute intraperitoneal administration of isoprenaline also produced a decrease in adiponutrin expression in adipose tissue. In vitro data suggest that adiponutrin's inhibitory effect could be mediated, at least in part, by the sympathetic system via β1/β2-AR.

On day 70 of gestation, pig fetuses were hypophysectomized (hypoxed) by microcauterization. Both hypoxed and intact fetuses were implanted subcutaneously with T4 pellets or received no hormone replacement. Fetuses were removed by laparotomy on day 90 of gestation. Additional fetuses were hypoxed on day 70, implanted with T4 pellets on day 90 and removed on day 105 of gestation. Serum T4 levels were similar in hypox + T4 and intact + T4 fetuses and increased in both groups relative to their respective controls. T4 supplementation restored the lipolytic response to isoproterenol and enhanced the response to dibutyryl cyclic AMP at 90 days in hypoxed animals but had no effect on basal or stimulated lipolysis in intact fetuses. T4 induced a dramatic increase in  in hypoxed fetuses when administered during either fetal period and produced a slight though significant increase in basal  in intact fetuses when administered from days 70 to 90 of gestation. However, T4 had no effect on basal or insulin-stimulated  in intact fetuses when administered from days 90 to 105 of gestation. These results indicate that T4 may have a primary influence on fetal adipose tissue metabolism only in the absence of inhibition from counterregulatory hormones of pituitary origin.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8170501>Tumor necrosis factor alpha decreases inositol phosphate formation and phosphatidylinositol-bisphosphate (PIP2) synthesis in rat cardiomyocytes.</a></h2><p>Treatment of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes for 72 h in the presence of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) (10 U/ml) lead to a decrease in basal and alpha 1-adrenoceptor-induced formation of the calcium-mobilizing second messenger inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and its metabolites, IP2 and IP1, by 35 and 26%, respectively. The synthesis of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2), the substrate of PI-specific phospholipase C, was decreased by 45% following the TNF alpha (10 U/ml) exposure. Time courses of TNF alpha (10 U/ml)-induced alterations in rat cardiomyocytes showed a parallel decline of basal inositol phosphate formation and PIP2 synthesis suggesting that the decrease in inositol phosphate formation was due to the reduction in PIP2 synthesis. As the TNF alpha-induced decrease of PIP2 synthesis was associated with a decreased synthesis of the phospholipid phosphatidylinositol (PI), the precursor of PIP2, by 33%, the decreased availability of PIP2 is apparently, at least in part, the result of the decreased synthesis of PI. As an apparent functional consequence of the decrease in IP3 formation following the TNF alpha exposure, the alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated induction of arrhythmias by 100 mumol/l noradrenaline + 10 mumol/l timolol was abolished in TNF alpha-pretreated rat cardiomyocytes. To investigate one of the possible mechanisms of the TNF alpha-induced decrease of PIP2 formation, the effect of TNF alpha pretreatment on glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GDH), a key enzyme of , was studied: Exposure of the rat cardiomyocytes for 72 h to TNF alpha induced a concentration-dependent decrease in GDH activity by maximally 55%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23376222>Dynamic changes in lipid droplet-associated proteins in the "browning" of white adipose tissues.</a></h2><p>The morphological and functional differences between lipid droplets (LDs) in brown (BAT) and white (WAT) adipose tissues will largely be determined by their associated proteins. Analysing mRNA expression in mice fat depots we have found that most LD protein genes are expressed at higher levels in BAT, with the greatest differences observed for Cidea and Plin5. Prolonged cold exposure, which induces the appearance of brown-like adipocytes in mice WAT depots, was accompanied with the potentiation of the lipolytic machinery, with changes in ATGL, CGI-58 and G0S2 gene expression. However the major change detected in WAT was the enhancement of Cidea mRNA. Together with the increase in Cidec, it indicates that LD enlargement through LD-LD transference of fat is an important process during WAT browning. To study the dynamics of this phenotypic change, we have applied 4D confocal microscopy in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells under sustained β-adrenergic stimulation. Under these conditions the cells experienced a LD remodelling cycle, with progressive reduction on the LD size by lipolysis, followed by the formation of new LDs, which were subjected to an enlargement process, likely to be CIDE-triggered, until the cell returned to the basal state. This transformation would be triggered by the activation of a thermogenic futile cycle of lipolysis/ and could facilitate the molecular mechanism for the unilocular to multilocular transformation during WAT browning.

Adenosine and insulin independently inhibited isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis. Adenosine, acting through the pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein Gi, was more effective than insulin and could completely inhibit lipolysis. Fatty acid synthesis from glucose was increased by both adenosine and insulin. Neutralization of endogenous adenosine with adenosine deaminase decreased basal rates of  and increased the insulin response from 30 to 60% above basal. Neutralization of Gi with pertussis toxin further decreased the basal rate and increased the insulin response to 160% above basal. These data indicate that Gi, and the ligands that signal through Gi, stimulate glucose incorporation into fatty acids and can attenuate the insulin response. It seems likely that an exaggerated rate of glucose metabolism in the absence of insulin contributes to the inconsistent insulin responses exhibited in pig adipose tissue in vitro. These data also demonstrate that insulin and adenosine have major roles in regulating pig adipose tissue metabolism.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12010762>Trans-10, cis-12, but not cis-9, trans-11 CLA isomer, inhibits brown adipocyte thermogenic capacity.</a></h2><p>Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is reported to have health benefits, including reduction of body fat. Previous studies have shown that brown adipose tissue (BAT) is particularly sensitive to CLA-supplemented diet feeding. Most of them use mixtures containing several CLA isomers, mainly cis-9, trans-11 and trans-10, cis-12 in equal concentration. Our aim was to characterize the separate effects of both CLA isomers on thermogenic capacity in cultured brown adipocytes. The CLA isomers showed opposite effects. Hence, on the one hand, trans-10, cis-12 inhibited uncoupling protein (UCP) 1 induction by norepinephrine (NE) and produced a decrease in leptin mRNA levels. These effects were associated with a blockage of CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein-alpha and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma(2) mRNA expression. On the other hand, cis-9, trans-11 enhanced the UCP1 elicited by NE, an effect reported earlier for polyunsaturated fatty acids and also observed here for linoleic acid.

Generally accepted biological effects of leptin are inhibition of food intake and stimulation of metabolic rate in ob/ob mice that are defective in the leptin gene. In contrast to these centrally mediated effects of leptin, we are reporting here on leptin effects on isolated rat adipocytes. Leptin impairs several metabolic actions of insulin, i.e. stimulation of glucose transport, glycogen synthase, , inhibition of isoproterenol-induced lipolysis, and protein kinase A activation, as well as stimulation of protein synthesis. Insulin effects were reduced by leptin (2 nM) with a half-life of about 8 h. At low leptin concentrations (<1 nM), the insulin sensitivity was reduced leading to a shift to the right in the dose-response curve. At higher concentrations the responsiveness was diminished, resulting in nearly complete inhibition of insulin effects at >30 nM leptin. The IC50 value of leptin was 3.1 +/- 1 nM after 15 h of preincubation of adipocytes in primary culture. The natural splice variant des-Gln49-leptin exhibited a significantly lower potency. Adipocytes regained full insulin sensitivity within a few hours after leptin removal. The stimulation of glucose transport by vanadate was not affected by leptin. These data show specific and potent impairment of insulin action by leptin in the physiological concentration range of both leptin and insulin, which may be related to the pathophysiology of insulin resistance in both non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and obesity.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22798227>Benzyl isothiocyanate disturbs lipid metabolism in rats in a way independent of its thyroid impact following in vivo long-term treatment and in vitro adipocytes studies.</a></h2><p>During recent decades, benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) was examined mainly in terms of its cancer chemopreventive action.

Therefore, this research project aimed at expanding our knowledge about how non-physiological doses of BITC (widely used in chemotherapy) influence some hormonal and metabolic (lipid) parameters in in vivo and in vitro experiments. The trial was focused on BITC action on thyroid tissue, liver, as well as white adipocyte tissue, at doses which were previously proved to exert a strong anticancer effect (10 mg/kg body weight in vivo and 1, 10 and 100 μmol/L in in vitro trials, respectively). Two-week oral administration of BITC in in vivo trial affected thyroid gland by decreasing total thyroxine and triiodothyronine. However, the obtained lipid profile was not specific for thyroid hormone deficiency because no lipid changes in the blood serum and liver steatosis were observed. BITC per se evoked elevation of basal lipolysis at 1 and 100 μmol/L and limitation of basal  at 100 μmol/L in adipocyte tissues in in vitro experiment.

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) regulate , and, here, we describe a role for BMP8B in the direct regulation of thermogenesis. BMP8B is induced by nutritional and thermogenic factors in mature BAT, increasing the response to noradrenaline through enhanced p38MAPK/CREB signaling and increased lipase activity. Bmp8b(-/-) mice exhibit impaired thermogenesis and reduced metabolic rate, causing weight gain despite hypophagia. BMP8B is also expressed in the hypothalamus, and Bmp8b(-/-) mice display altered neuropeptide levels and reduced phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), indicating an anorexigenic state. Central BMP8B treatment increased sympathetic activation of BAT, dependent on the status of AMPK in key hypothalamic nuclei. Our results indicate that BMP8B is a thermogenic protein that regulates energy balance in partnership with hypothalamic AMPK. BMP8B may offer a mechanism to specifically increase energy dissipation by BAT.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Basal metabolic rate (278 mumol of O2/h per g of lipid) was maximally stimulated with isoprenaline (20 nm) and Ro 16-8714 (20 microM) to 1633 and 1024 mumol of O2/h per g respectively, whereas insulin had no effect on O2 consumption. Total glucose uptake, derived from the sum of [U-14C]glucose incorporation into CO2 and total lipids and lactate release, was enhanced with insulin. Isoprenaline and Ro 16-8714 had no effect on insulin-induced glucose uptake, but promoted glucose oxidation while inhibiting insulin-dependent  and lactate production. A maximal value for glucose oxidation was obtained under the combined action of Ro 16-8714 and insulin, which corresponded to an equivalent of 165 mumol of O2/h per g of lipid.

The present study aimed to investigate the role of GPR103 in  and lipid metabolism using 3T3-L1 adipocyte cells. Our results show that differentiated 3T3-L1 cells expressed the GPR103b subtype mRNA and protein, as well as QRFP mRNA. QRFP-43 and -26 induced an increase in triglyceride accumulation of 50 and 41%, respectively, and elicited a dose-dependent increase in fatty acid uptake, by up to approximately 60% at the highest concentration, in 3T3-L1-differentiated cells. QRFP-43 and -26 inhibited isoproterenol (ISO)-induced lipolysis in a dose-dependent manner, with IC(50)s of 2.3 +/- 1.2 and 1.1 +/- 1.0 nm, respectively.

Lipolysis and  were assessed by protein expression studies of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) (84 kDa) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) (56 kDa), respectively. In addition, lipolytic rate was assessed by glycerol release assay and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha release measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (n = 12). In subcutaneous adipocytes, increasing insulin doses stimulated LPL expression, with maximal stimulation at 100 nmol/l insulin (control, 1.0 +/- 0.0 [mean +/- SE, protein expression relative to control]; 1 nmol/l insulin, 0.87 +/- 0.13; 100 nmol/l insulin, 1.68 +/- 0.19; P < 0.001). In contrast, insulin at the 100 nmol/l dose reduced the expression of HSL (100 nmol/l insulin, 0.49 +/- 0.05; P < 0.05), while no significant reduction was observed at other doses. Higher doses of insulin stimulated both HSL (1,000 nmol/l insulin, 1.4 +/- 0.07; P < 0.01) and LPL (control 1.00 +/- 0.0; 1,000 nmol/l insulin, 2.66 +/- 0.27; P < 0.01) protein expression. Cotreatment with RSG induced an increased dose response to insulin for LPL and HSL (P < 0.05); RSG alone also increased LPL and HSL expression (P < 0.05). Insulin stimulated TNF-alpha secretion in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.01); the addition of RSG (10(-8) mol/l) reduced TNF-alpha secretion (P < 0.05). In summary, chronic treatment of human adipocytes with insulin stimulates lipolysis and LPL protein expression. The addition of RSG reduced the lipolytic rate and TNF-alpha secretion. The increase in lipolysis is not explained by changes in HSL expression. These data, therefore, may explain in part why hyperinsulinemia coexists with increased circulating nonesterified free fatty acids and increased adiposity in obese and/or type 2 diabetic patients.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24200503>Fatty acid synthase plays a role in cancer metabolism beyond providing fatty acids for phospholipid synthesis or sustaining elevations in glycolytic activity.</a></h2><p>Fatty acid synthase is over-expressed in many cancers and its activity is required for cancer cell survival, but the role of endogenously synthesized fatty acids in cancer is unknown. It has been suggested that endogenous fatty acid synthesis is either needed to support the growth of rapidly dividing cells, or to maintain elevated glycolysis (the Warburg effect) that is characteristic of cancer cells. Here, we investigate both hypotheses. First, we compared utilization of fatty acids synthesized endogenously from (14)C-labeled acetate to those supplied exogenously as (14)C-labeled palmitate in the culture medium in human breast cancer (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and untransformed breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A). We found that cancer cells do not produce fatty acids that are different from those derived from exogenous palmitate, that these fatty acids are esterified to the same lipid and phospholipid classes in the same proportions, and that their distribution within neutral lipids is not different from untransformed cells. These results suggest that endogenously synthesized fatty acids do not fulfill a specific function in cancer cells. Furthermore, we observed that cancer cells excrete endogenously synthesized fatty acids, suggesting that they are produced in excess of requirements. We next investigated whether lipogenic activity is involved in the maintenance of high glycolytic activity by culturing both cancer and non-transformed cells under anoxic conditions. Although anoxia increased glycolysis 2-3 fold, we observed no concomitant increase in . Our results indicate that breast cancer cells do not have a specific qualitative or quantitative requirement for endogenously synthesized fatty acids and that increased de novo  is not required to sustain elevations in glycolytic activity induced by anoxia in these cells.© 2013 The Authors.

In the obese state, caloric surplus is accommodated in the adipocytes as triglycerides. As the storage capacity of adipocytes is exceeded or malfunctioning, lipids begin to infiltrate and accumulate in non-adipose tissues, including the myocardium of the heart, leading to organ dysfunction. While the disruption of caloric homeostasis has been widely viewed as a principal mechanism in contributing to peripheral tissue steatosis and lipotoxicity, our recent studies in Drosophila have led to the novel finding that deregulation of phospholipid homeostasis may also significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of lipotoxic cardiomyopathy. Fly mutants that bear perturbations in phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) biosynthesis, such as the easily-shocked (eas) mutants defective in  kinase, incurred aberrant activation of the sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) pathway, thereby causing chronic  and cardiac steatosis that culminates in the development of lipotoxic cardiomyopathy.

Dose-response studies indicated that isoprenaline (0.05-0.15 mg/kg) produced a dose-dependent activation of HSL in both BAT and WAT, whereas SR 58611A produced no change in HSL in WAT over a dose range (1-5 mg/kg) which, at the same time, dose-dependently increased HSL activity in BAT. The other beta 3-adrenoceptor agonists, ZD 7114 (10 mg/kg) and BRL 35135 A (5 mg/kg) also selectively increased HSL activity in BAT, these doses having previously been shown to stimulate  in vivo. Higher doses of ZD 7114 and BRL 35135 produced no further increase in HSL activity and, in the case of BRL 35135, provoked symptoms of non-selective beta-adrenoceptor activation.

Effects of insulin and noradrenaline, contributions from glucose and lactate as precursors and comparisons with white adipocytes.</a></h2><p>1. Brown adipocytes were isolated from the interscapular depot of male rats maintained at approx. 21 degrees C. In some experiments parallel studies were made with white adipocytes from the epididymal depot. 2. Insulin increased and noradrenaline decreased [U-14C]glucose incorporation into fatty acids by brown adipocytes. Brown adipocytes differed from white adipocytes in that exogenous fatty acid (palmitate) substantially decreased fatty acid synthesis from glucose. Both noradrenaline and insulin increased lactate + pyruvate formation by brown adipocytes. Brown adipocytes converted a greater proportion of metabolized glucose into lactate + pyruvate and a smaller proportion into fatty acids than did white adipocytes. 3. In brown adipocytes, when fatty acid synthesis from [U-14C]glucose was decreased by noradrenaline or palmitate, incorporation of 3H2O into fatty acids was also decreased to an extent which would not support proposals for extensive recycling into fatty acid synthesis of acetyl-CoA derived from fatty acid oxidation. 4. In the absence of glucose, [U-14C]lactate was a poor substrate for  in brown adipocytes, but its use was facilitated by glucose. When brown adipocytes were incubated with 1 mM-lactate + 5 mM-glucose, lactate-derived carbon generally provided at least 50% of the precursor for fatty acid synthesis. 5. Both insulin and noradrenaline increased [U-14C]glucose conversion into CO2 by brown adipocytes (incubated in the presence of lactate) and, in combination, stimulation of glucose oxidation by these two agents showed synergism. Rates of 14CO2 formation from glucose by brown adipocytes were relatively small compared with maximum rates of oxygen consumption by these cells, suggesting that glucose is unlikely to be a major substrate for thermogenesis. 6. Brown adipocytes from 6-week-old rats had considerably lower maximum rates of fatty acid synthesis, relative to cell DNA content, than white adipocytes. By contrast, rates of fatty acid synthesis from 3H2O in vivo were similar in the interscapular and epididymal fat depots. Expressed relative to activities of fatty acid synthase or ATP citrate lyase, however, brown adipocytes synthesized fatty acids as effectively as did white adipocytes. It is suggested that the cells most active in fatty acid synthesis in the brown adipose tissue are not recovered fully in the adipocyte fraction during cell isolation.

DPCPX had a very weak effect on  and did not significantly affect glucose uptake. In adipocytes incubated with 1 microM DPCPX, lipolysis increased. This effect was blunted by insulin and by a direct inhibitor of protein kinase A. Moreover, 0.1 microM DPCPX substantially enhanced the lipolytic response to epinephrine and increased cAMP in adipocytes. However, DPCPX was ineffective when lipolysis was stimulated by direct activation of protein kinase A. Adipocyte exposure to epinephrine and insulin with or without 0.1 microM DPCPX demonstrated that this antagonist increased the release of glycerol. However, despite the presence of DPCPX, insulin was able to reduce lipolysis. It is concluded that DPCPX had a weak effect on , whereas lipolysis was significantly affected.

Feed intake of both NR and SR was maximal in August, but declined thereafter, reaching minimum values in January (NR) and March (SR), 55 and 69% below the August value, respectively. NR and SR adipocyte volume changed in parallel and were reduced to the same extent (69%) from their maximum in August to their minimum in May. Adipocyte lipogenic capacity, measured as acetate incorporation into cellular lipid at saturated acetate concentrations, was lowest in January (NR adipocytes) and March (SR adipocytes), 92 and 90%, respectively, below the maximum values, which were obtained in August. Lipolytic capacity, measured as maximum adrenaline-stimulated glycerol release, was high in SR adipocytes from March through to October and in NR adipocytes from July through to January.

We generated mice with a point mutation in the thyroid hormone receptor alpha (TRalpha) gene producing a dominant-negative TRalpha mutant receptor with a proline to histidine substitution (P398H). The heterozygous P398H mutant mice had a 3.4-fold (p < 0.02) increase in serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels. Serum triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) concentrations were slightly elevated compared with wild-type mice. The P398H mice had a 4.4-fold increase in body fat (as a fraction of total body weight) (p < 0.001) and a 5-fold increase in serum leptin levels (p < 0.005) compared with wild-type mice. A 3-fold increase in serum fasting insulin levels (p < 0.002) and a 55% increase in fasting glucose levels (p < 0.01) were observed in P398H compared with wild-type mice. There was a marked reduction in norepinephrine-induced lipolysis, as reflected in reduced glycerol release from white adipose tissue isolated from P398H mice. Heart rate and cold-induced adaptive thermogenesis, mediated by thyroid hormone-catecholamine interaction, were also reduced in P398H mice. In conclusion, the TRalpha P398H mutation is associated with visceral adiposity and insulin resistance primarily due to a marked reduction in catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis. The observed phenotype in the TRalpha P398H mouse is likely due to interference with TRalpha action as well as influence on other metabolic signaling pathways. The physiologic significance of these findings will ultimately depend on understanding the full range of actions of this mutation.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23489684>Obestatin inhibits  and glucose uptake in isolated primary rat adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Ghrelin and obestatin are encoded by the preproghrelin gene and originate from post-translational processing of the preproghrelin peptide. Obestatin is mainly present in the stomach, but its action is focused on appetite inhibition in opposition to ghrelin function. Recently, it has been presented that obestatin may regulate adipocyte metabolism and influence fat content. However, obestatin action is still poorly understood. Therefore, we aimed to investigate obestatin function on adipocyte metabolism in the rat. We studied changes in the mRNA expression of active and inactive isoforms of obestatin receptors. In addition, we analyzed influence of obestatin on , lipolysis and glucose transport in isolated adipocytes. Moreover, we also performed analysis of obestatin action on lipolysis in differentiated rat preadipocytes with silenced obestatin receptor. We found significantly higher expression of the obestatin receptor Gpr39-1a active form at an mRNA level following adipocytes incubation with obestatin. We did not observe expression changes in the inactive form of obestatin receptor Gpr39-1b. Additionally, we found significant changes in Gpr39-1a expression following obestatin receptor silencing in cells incubated with obestatin in comparison to control. Obestatin inhibited both, basal and insulin-stimulated  and glucose transport in adipocytes. Furthermore, obestatin potentiated adrenalin-stimulated lipolysis. We also found reduced glycerol release following obestatin incubation in adipocytes with silenced Gpr39 gene.

These findings suggest the involvement of CB(1)R in the control of liver regeneration. Here we report that mice lacking CB(1)R globally or in hepatocytes only and wild-type mice treated with a CB(1)R antagonist have a delayed proliferative response to two-thirds partial hepatectomy (PHX). In wild-type mice, PHX leads to increased hepatic expression of CB(1)R and hyperactivation of the biosynthesis of the endocannabinoid anandamide in the liver via an in vivo pathway involving conjugation of arachidonic acid and  by fatty-acid amide hydrolase. In wild-type but not CB(1)R(-/-) mice, PHX induces robust up-regulation of key cell-cycle proteins involved in mitotic progression, including cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1), cyclin B2, and their transcriptional regulator forkhead box protein M1 (FoxM1), as revealed by ultrahigh-throughput RNA sequencing and pathway analysis and confirmed by real-time PCR and Western blot analyses. Treatment of wild-type mice with anandamide induces similar changes mediated via activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway.

Norepinephrine exerts its effects by selectively stimulating the proliferation of brown fat cells. Results with receptor-specific agonists and antagonists indicate that norepinephrine interacts with the beta 1-adrenergic receptor to stimulate cell proliferation. The capacity of these brown fat cells to respond to norepinephrine by proliferating seems to be a manifestation of a normal physiological response of brown fat cells, because exposing an animal to the cold increases cell proliferation. Thus, this system indicates that two independent pathways for cell proliferation coexist in parallel, one based on transformation of the cell by the simian virus-40 T-antigen and the other on the normal response of the cell to stimulation by norepinephrine. Several clonal lines have been isolated that have similar levels of marker gene expression for  and mitochondriogenesis, but differ in the level of Ucp expression.

ADFP expression is strongly induced in cells with increased lipid load. We have inactivated the Adfp gene in mice to better understand its role in lipid accumulation. The Adfp-deficient mice have unaltered adipose differentiation or lipolysis in vitro or in vivo. Importantly, they display a 60% reduction in hepatic triglyceride (TG) and are resistant to diet-induced fatty liver.

The finding of similar VLDL output in the presence of a reduction in total TG in the Adfp-deficient liver is explained by the retention of TG in the microsomes where VLDL is assembled. Given that lipid droplets are thought to form from the outer leaflet of the microsomal membrane, the reduction of TG in the cytosol with concomitant accumulation of TG in the microsome of Adfp-/- cells suggests that ADFP may facilitate the formation of new LDs.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on adipocyte biology. 3T3-L1 cells were used to evaluate proliferation by sulforhodamine B (SRB) staining and methyl-(3)H-thymidine incorporation after 48 or 72 h of treatment with THC (1-500 nmol/l). Cells were differentiated in the presence or absence of the cannabinoid, and  was determined by measuring lipid accumulation and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) transcription through reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR). Lipolysis was quantified under basal conditions or after isoproterenol (IP, 100 nmol/l) or insulin (INS, 100 nmol/l) treatment. Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ), diacylglycerol lipase α, and N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine-specific phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD) transcriptions were determined by RT-PCR in preadipocytes and adipocytes and adiponectin only in adipocytes. THC treatment increased culture protein content and reduced methyl-(3)H-thymidine incorporation. Cells treated with THC underwent  shown by the expression of PPARγ and had increased lipid accumulation. Basal and IP-stimulated lipolyses were inhibited by THC and there was no effect on lipolysis of INS-treated adipocytes. The effects on methyl-(3)H-thymidine incorporation and lipolysis seem to be mediated through CB1- and CB2-dependent pathways. THC decreased NAPE-PLD in preadipocytes and increased adiponectin and TGFβ transcription in adipocytes. These results show that the ECS interferes with adipocyte biology and may contribute to adipose tissue (AT) remodeling. Although these observations point toward increased AT deposition, the stimulation of adiponectin production and inhibition of lipolysis may be in favor of improved INS sensitivity under cannabinoid influence.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26305383>Effects of supplementation of rumen-protected choline on growth performance, meat quality and gene expression in longissimus dorsi muscle of lambs.</a></h2><p>This study determined the effects of rumen-protected choline (RPC) on growth performance, blood lipids, meat quality and expression of genes involved in fatty-acid metabolism in young lambs. A total of 24 Dorper × Hu lambs (about 20 kg body weight) were kept in individual pens and fed diets with 0%, 0.25%, 0.50% and 0.75% RPC for 60 d. Supplementation of 0.25% RPC increased average daily gain of lambs, whereas treatments had no significant effect on feed intake. The pH values of meat were increased at 0.25% RPC and both, dripping loss and shear force of meat, were significantly decreased in RPC-supplemented lambs. No significant changes were observed for dressing percentage and intramuscular fat. RPC supplementations had no significant effect on the concentrations of triglycerides and cholesterols in serum, but the concentration of high-density lipoprotein was decreased at 0.50% RPC and that of low-density lipoprotein was increased at 0.75% RPC. In m. longissimus dorsi, the expressions of cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty-acid synthase (FASN) genes were increased at 0.25% RPC. Supplementation of 0.75% RPC increased the expressions of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and FASN genes, decreased the expression of ACC gene and had no effect on CD36 gene. The results of this study showed that supplementation of 0.25% RPC could promote growth performance of lambs and improve meat quality. This may be mediated by effects on blood lipid profiles and the metabolism of fatty acids in skeleton muscles. However, the beneficial effects of 0.25% RPC supplementation need to be validated with a larger number of animals. Higher doses, particularly 0.75% RPC, showed adverse effects on live weight gain and ACC expression.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8856398>Regulation of lipolysis in fat cells of obese women during long-term hypocaloric diet.</a></h2><p>To investigate the influence of four weeks treatment with a strictly defined very low calorie diet (VLCD) on the regulation of adipocyte matabolism in vitro in subcutaneous fat cells of obese subjects.Prospective study.Nine obese, but otherwise healthy and drug-free women aged 26-48 years with BMI 36.4-51.9 kg/m2 were investigated before and during the fourth week on a calorie restricted diet.A subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsy was obtained from the abdominal area. Isolated fat cells were prepared and incubated in vitro with different agents acting on lipolysis at defined steps in the lipolytic cascade. Glycerol (lipolytic index), hormone-sensitive lipase activity and incorporation of glucose into lipids were measured.VLCD caused a two-fold rise in basal lipolysis (p < 0.005).

No differences were found in the hormone-sensitive lipase activity before or during VLCD. The specific alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist UK 14304 was equally effective in inducing antilipolysis both before and during calorie restriction. However, during VLCD, the sensitivity and maximal antilipolytic effect of insulin were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) and the ability of insulin to stimulate  was almost completely blunted.Four weeks of VLCD induced elevated basal lipolysis, a resistance to the ability of insulin to induce antilipolysis and  in subcutaneous fat cells, but preserved lipolytic catecholamine action.

Here, we have used an isotopic fatty acid labeling strategy coupled with metabolomic profiling platforms to comprehensively map palmitic acid incorporation into complex lipids in cancer cells. We show that cancer cells and tumors robustly incorporate and remodel exogenous palmitate into structural and oncogenic glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and ether lipids. We also find that fatty acid incorporation into oxidative pathways is reduced in aggressive human cancer cells, and instead shunted into pathways for generating structural and signaling lipids.

Macrophages are innate immune cells that survey and respond to danger and damage signals. Although it is well-known that energy metabolism can dictate macrophage function, little is known as to the importance of choline homeostasis in macrophage biology. We hypothesized that the uptake and metabolism of choline are important for macrophage inflammation. Polarization of primary bone marrow macrophages with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulted in an increased rate of choline uptake and higher levels of PC synthesis. This was attributed to a substantial increase in the transcript and protein expression of the choline transporter-like protein-1 (CTL1) in polarized cells. We next sought to determine the importance of choline uptake and CTL1 for macrophage immune responsiveness. Chronic pharmacological or CTL1 antibody-mediated inhibition of choline uptake resulted in altered cytokine secretion in response to LPS, which was associated with increased levels of diacylglycerol and activation of protein kinase C. These experiments establish a previously unappreciated link between choline phospholipid metabolism and macrophage immune responsiveness, highlighting a critical and regulatory role for macrophage choline uptake via the CTL1 transporter.© 2018 Snider et al.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11541653>The effect of hypokinesia on lipid metabolism in adipose tissue.</a></h2><p>The increase of nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentration in plasma was observed in rats subjected to hypokinesia for 1-60 days.

They are found to respond to nutrient deprivation and profoundly regulate metabolic functions. We have previously reported that caloric restriction increases the expression of one of the seven mammalian sirtuins, SIRT2, in tissues such as white adipose tissue. Because adipose tissue is a key metabolic organ playing a critical role in whole body energy homeostasis, we went on to explore the function of SIRT2 in adipose tissue. We found short-term food deprivation for 24 h, already induces SIRT2 expression in white and brown adipose tissues. Additionally, cold exposure elevates SIRT2 expression in brown adipose tissue but not in white adipose tissue. Intraperitoneal injection of a beta-adrenergic agonist (isoproterenol) enhances SIRT2 expression in white adipose tissue. Retroviral expression of SIRT2 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes promotes lipolysis. SIRT2 inhibits 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation in low-glucose (1 g/l) or low-insulin (100 nM) condition. Mechanistically, SIRT2 suppresses  by deacetylating FOXO1 to promote FOXO1's binding to PPARgamma and subsequent repression on PPARgamma transcriptional activity.

Changes in interrelationships (coupling) between the parameters under different treatment regimes were assessed using bivariate regression analyses. 3. Administration of glucagon with noradrenaline increased lipolysis/fatty acid utilization coupling without concomitant increase of VO2 suggesting that glucagon may increase re-esterification through glycogenolytic generation of glycerol 3-phosphate, trapping intracellular fatty acid in excess of the capacity of disposal mechanisms, thus conserving respiratory substrate. 4. W cells were unresponsive to glucagon in terms of lipolysis and VO2, C cells responded to glucagon with parallel increases in lipolysis rate and VO2. Both cell types responded to noradrenaline alone and conjointly with glucagon; C cells were more sensitive to these agonists than W cells. 5. Lipolysis/VO2 coupling was reduced in C cells suggesting that in cold acclimation, noradrenaline-induced lipolysis rates are in excess of the capacity of cellular oxidation/re-esterification mechanisms. 6.

One class of hormones which activate pyruvate dehydrogenase are those that increase cytoplasmic Ca2+. A wide range of studies on isolated enzymes, separated mitochondria and intact cell preparations have shown that the activation is due to the stimulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase. Two other intramitochondrial dehydrogenases which regulate the citrate acid cycle are activated in parallel and this is an important means of balancing the supply of ATP to increasing cell demand. Insulin is also able to activate pyruvate dehydrogenase, but this is restricted to fat and other cells capable of .

Live weight gain was not affected by hormone treatment. Protein content of the 9-10-11th rib section was greatest in steers receiving GH irrespective of feeding level, whereas a reduction of lipid content due to GH was seen only with ad libitum feeding.

In vitro rates of adipose , esterification and lipolysis were greatest in tissue from ad libitum-fed steers. The only effect of GH on in vitro metabolism was a tendency for lower lipolytic rates with ad libitum feeding. GH did not affect adipocyte size.

However, the contribution of adipose tissue to MCD-induced steatosis, and inflammation as features of NASH are not fully understood. The goal of this study was to elucidate the role of adipose tissue fatty acid (FA) metabolism, , lipolysis, inflammation and subsequent changes in FA profiles in serum and liver in the pathogenesis of steatohepatitis. We therefore fed ob/ob mice with control or MCD diet for 5 weeks. MCD-feeding increased adipose triglyceride lipase and hormone sensitive lipase activities in all adipose depots which may be attributed to increased systemic FGF21 levels. The highest lipase enzyme activity was exhibited by visceral WAT. Non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA)-18:2n6 was the predominantly elevated FA species in serum and liver of MCD-fed ob/ob mice, while overall serum total fatty acid (TFA) composition was reduced. In contrast, an overall increase of all FA species from TFA pool was found in liver, reflecting the combined effects of increased FA flux to liver, decreased FA oxidation and decrease in lipase activity in liver. NAFLD activity score was increased in liver, while WAT showed no changes and BAT showed even reduced inflammation.This study demonstrates a key role for adipose tissue lipases in the pathogenesis of NASH and provides a comprehensive lipidomic profiling of NEFA and TFA homeostasis in serum and liver. Our findings provide novel mechanistic insights for the role of WAT in progression of MCD-induced liver injury.Copyright © 2014.

Moreover, NRF1 protein, which belongs to the transcriptional activator family and is thought to be involved in mitochondrial biogenesis regulation, was present in higher proportions in nuclei isolated from epididymal cells than in those from inguinal cells.

Therefore, white adipose tissue appears as a heterogeneous organ with marked variation in mitochondrial content depending on its anatomical location.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1932101>Comparison of effects of platelet-activating factor and tumour necrosis factor-alpha on lipid metabolism in adrenalectomized rats in vivo.</a></h2><p>The acute metabolic effects of platelet-activating factor (PAF) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were compared in sham-operated and adrenalectomized rats. PAF caused hyperglycaemia in sham-operated rats, whereas with TNF-alpha there was a slight decrease in blood glucose. Both PAF and TNF-alpha resulted in marked hypoglycaemia in the adrenalectomized rats. Plasma insulin was depressed (about 50%) by PAF and TNF-alpha in sham-operated rats, whereas in the adrenalectomized rats the already low plasma insulin concentration was not significantly altered. Liver glycogen content was the same in control and treated sham-operated rats, but was considerably decreased (about 50%) in the adrenalectomized rats. In sham-operated rats, PAF and TNF-alpha increased plasma non-esterified fatty acids and triacylglycerols, suggesting increased lipolysis, whereas in adrenalectomized rats there was no significant increase in non-esterified fatty acids with PAF, although it still occurred with TNF-alpha. This suggests that the lipolytic effect of TNF-alpha may be direct, whereas that of PAF is indirect, possibly via increased catecholamines in the sham-operated rats. The stimulation (about 3-fold) of hepatic fatty acid synthesis in vivo by PAF and TNF-alpha in sham-operated rats was still evident in the adrenalectomized rats, although the absolute increase was smaller. PAF, but not TNF-alpha increased (100%) sterol synthesis in adrenalectomized rats.

In GH-deficient children, the degree of this change in relative lipid content per adipocyte appears to be correlated with decreases in sensitivity of abdominal subcutaneous fat to the antilipolytic action of insulin. We studied abdominal and gluteal sc adipose tissue from 10 children with short stature (height less than 5% ile, growth velocity less than 5 cm/yr, bone age delayed at least 2 yr), who were not GH deficient based upon provocative testing (non-GH-deficient short stature) 1) before beginning and 2) after 3 months of therapy with exogenous GH (Humatrope, 0.1 mg/kg sc 3 times/week). In abdominal and gluteal adipocytes, we measured lipid content, rates of reesterification of fatty acids released by ongoing lipolysis and rates of in vitro lipolysis and  in response to insulin, adenosine, and various adrenoreceptor agonists. These biochemical measures were correlated with measures of statural growth and adipose tissue distribution in each subject. We found that GH therapy was associated with a significant reduction in abdominal adipocyte size (0.48 microgram +/- 0.08 lipid per cell prior to therapy vs. 0.43 microgram +/- 0.08 lipid per cell after therapy, P less than 0.05) and a significant increase in responsiveness of gluteal sc adipose tissue to the lipogenic actions of insulin. The significant correlations of changes in abdominal adipocyte volume with changes in regional adipose tissue insulin sensitivity that were noted in GH-deficient children were not noted in this subject population, perhaps due to effects of endogenous GH on pretreatment insulin responsiveness of adipose tissue. These data reaffirm that GH has site-specific effects on regional adipose tissue depots.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21164562>A low-protein, high-carbohydrate diet increases the adipose lipid content without increasing the glycerol-3-phosphate or fatty acid content in growing rats.</a></h2><p>The amount of triacylglycerol (TAG) that accumulates in adipose tissue depends on 2 opposing processes:  and lipolysis. We have previously shown that the weight and lipid content of epididymal (EPI) adipose tissue increases in growing rats fed a low-protein, high-carbohydrate (LPHC) diet for 15 days. The aim of this work was to study the pathways involved in  and lipolysis, which ultimately regulate lipid accumulation in the tissue. De novo fatty acid synthesis was evaluated in vivo and was similar for rats fed an LPHC diet or a control diet; however, the LPHC-fed rats had decreased lipoprotein lipase activity in the EPI adipose tissue, which suggests that there was a decreased uptake of fatty acids from the circulating lipoproteins. The LPHC diet did not affect synthesis of glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) via glycolysis or glyceroneogenesis. Glycerokinase activity - i.e., the phosphorylation of glycerol from the hydrolysis of endogenous TAG to form G3P - was also not affected in LPHC-fed rats. In contrast, adipocytes from LPHC animals had a reduced lipolytic response when stimulated by norepinephrine, even though the basal adipocyte lipolytic rate was similar for both of the groups. Thus, the results suggest that the reduction of lipolytic activity stimulated by norepinephrine seems essential for the TAG increase observed in the EPI adipose tissue of LPHC animals, probably by impairment of the process of activation of lipolysis by norepinephrine.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827564>Fetuin-A modulates lipid mobilization in bovine adipose tissue by enhancing lipogenic activity of adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Fetuin-A (FetA) is an adipokine and free fatty acid (FFA) carrier linked to adipose tissue (AT) function in monogastrics and ruminants. In dairy cows, plasma and AT FetA decrease after parturition, coinciding with reduced  and increased lipolysis. In monogastrics, FetA enhances , but its role on lipid mobilization of ruminants is unclear. We hypothesized that FetA modulates lipid mobilization in bovine AT by enhancing the lipogenic activity of adipocytes. Our objective was to determine the effects of FetA on  and lipolysis in cultured primary adipocytes from dairy cows. Preadipocytes from the tailhead subcutaneous AT depot were induced to differentiate in a 7-d coculture in vitro model. The effects of FetA on lipolytic responses of adipocytes were evaluated after a 2-h β-adrenergic stimulation with 1 µM isoproterenol (ISO) alone or combined with 0.1 mg/mL of FetA (FetA+ISO), and in cells treated with medium alone (CON) or with 0.1 mg/mL of FetA (FetA). Lipogenic responses of adipocytes treated with CON or FetA from d 5 to 7 of differentiation were assessed by fatty acid (FA) uptake quantification and triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation, and the gene and protein expression of lipogenic markers. Bovine adipocytes abundantly expressed FetA gene and protein and secreted 48 ± 3.5 ng/DNA relative fluorescence units (RFU). Adrenergic stimulation with ISO increased lipolysis compared with CON, as reflected in the release of glycerol (0.12 ± 0.04 vs. 0.04 ± 0.02 nM/DNA RFU) and FFA (15 ± 13 vs. 6.2 ± 2.4 nM/DNA RFU). Lipolysis induced by ISO was attenuated by the addition of FetA (FetA+ISO) as reflected by lower glycerol (0.06 ± 0.04 nM/DNA RFU) and FFA (5.7 ± 2.7 nM/DNA RFU) release compared with ISO alone. Compared with CON, FetA enhanced lipogenic responses as demonstrated by higher FA uptake and increased accumulation of TAG. Exposure to FetA upregulated 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase-2 (AGPAT2) gene expression and protein content, as well as its activity. Adipocytes exposed to FetA increased the secretion of the metabolite of AGPAT2, phosphatidic acid. In conclusion, FetA attenuates lipolytic responses and enhances  in bovine adipocytes. The upregulation of the rate-limiting lipogenic enzyme AGPAT2 by FetA suggests a potential pathway by which this adipokine promotes TAG synthesis in adipocytes. These findings suggest that FetA is a potential target for lipid mobilization modulation in AT of dairy cows.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Thin-layer chromatography, in the upper phase of the n-butanol--ethyl acetate--water (4:1:5, by volume) system on plastic sheets coated with silica gel 60 F254, revealed the presence of a single spot after spraying with 10% sulfuric acid.

The saponin acted as a noncompetitive inhibitor of corticotropin, glucagon, and epinephrine in lipolysis in isolated rat adipocytes, and it also antagonized dibutyryl cAMP induced lipolysis. The antilipolytic activity was resistant to heat, trypsin, chymotrypsin, pronase, and glutathione, in keeping with the chemical nature of saponin. Incorporation of [3-3H]glucose into lipid was inhibited.

The roles of the sympathetic nerves in regulating lipid synthesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT) were studied by measuring incorporation of 3H from 3H2O into glyceride glycerol and glyceride fatty acids in the interscapular BAT in anaesthetized rats. 2. When noradrenaline was infused intravenously at a total dose of 1-8 micrograms/100 g body weight over 30 min, 3H incorporation into glyceride glycerol increased whereas 3H incorporation into fatty acids did not change. Similar responses were found when the sympathetic nerves entering the interscapular BAT were stimulated continuously at 10 Hz. However, when electrical stimuli consisting of a much shorter train (2 s) were applied to the nerves at 3 min intervals at 10 Hz (stimulation in bursts). 3H incorporation into both glyceride glycerol and fatty acids was enhanced. Stimulation in bursts elicited more pronounced lipogenic responses than other patterns that were employed, and involved the delivery of precisely the same number of impulses over the whole period of stimulation. The lipogenic responses to nerve stimulation in bursts were increased by increasing the stimulus frequency over the range 4-40 Hz. 3. Simultaneous administration of propranolol and phenoxybenzamine had little effect on either the fatty acid or the glyceride glycerol response to nerve stimulation. In contrast, these blocking agents almost completely eliminated the responses to noradrenaline infusion. 4. Pre-treatment with guanethidine effectively abolished the lipogenic response to nerve stimulation but potentiated the response to noradrenaline infusion. 5. It is concluded that lipid synthesis in BAT is enhanced by direct electrical stimulation of the sympathetic nerves only when they are stimulated in bursts. Sympathetic activation of  in BAT is not solely attributable to the action of noradrenaline but involves some non-adrenergic mechanism.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3343237>The active synthesis of phosphatidylcholine is required for very low density lipoprotein secretion from rat hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Hepatocytes obtained from rats fed a choline-deficient diet for 3 days were cultured in a medium +/- choline (100 microM) or methionine (200 microM). We investigated how choline deficiency affected hepatic , apolipoprotein synthesis, and lipoprotein secretion. The mass of triacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine secreted was increased about 3-fold and 2-fold, respectively, by the addition of either choline or methionine to the cultured cells. Similarly, a 3-fold stimulation in the secretion of [3H]triacylglycerol and [3H]phosphatidylcholine derived from [3H]oleate was observed after the addition of choline or methionine. Fractionation of secreted lipoproteins by ultracentrifugation revealed that the reduced secretion of triacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine from choline-deficient cells was mainly due to impaired secretion of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) (but not high density lipoproteins (HDL)). Fluorography of L-[4,5-3H]leucine-labeled lipoproteins showed a remarkable inhibition of VLDL secretion by choline deficiency. The addition of choline or methionine stimulated the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine and increased the cellular phosphatidylcholine levels to that in normal cells. While there was little effect of choline on the synthesis and amount of cellular phosphatidylethanolamine, the addition of methionine diminished cellular phosphatidylethanolamine levels. Choline deficiency did not change the rate of incorporation of L-[4,5-3H]leucine into cellular VLDL apolipoproteins, nor the rate of disappearance of radioactivity from L-[4,5-3H]leucine-labeled cellular apoB, apoE, and apoC. These results suggest that hepatic secretion of VLDL, but not HDL, requires active phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. Secondly, the inhibitory effect of choline deficiency on VLDL secretion can be compensated by the methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3027721>Studies on a protein kinase inhibitor-insensitive, phospholipase C-sensitive pathway of lipolysis in rat adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Endogenous lipid droplets were prepared by subjecting fat cells to hypotonic shock and Triton X-100 treatment.

The aim of the present study was to identify metabolic causes for the outstanding leanness of Lou/C rat. To this end, the metabolic profiles (food intake, energy expenditure, and physical activity) and the cellular characteristics of white adipose tissue (, lipolysis, cellularity, and lipid composition) in 30-wk-old Lou/C rats were compared with age-matched Wistar rats. Lou/C rats exhibited a lower body weight (-45%), reduced adiposity (-80%), increased locomotor activity (+95%), and higher energy expenditure (+11%) than Wistar rats. Epididymal adipose tissue of Lou/C rat was twice lower than that of Wistar rat due to both a reduction in both adipocyte size (-25%) and number (three times). Basal lipolysis and sensitivity to noradrenaline were similar; however, the responsiveness to noradrenaline was lower in adipocytes from Lou/C compared with that from Wistar rats. Lipidomic analysis of plasma, adipose tissue, and liver revealed profound differences in lipid composition between the two strains. Of note, the desaturation indexes (ratio C16:1/C16:0 and C18:1/C18:0) were lower in Lou/C, indicating a blunted activity of delta-9-desaturase such as stearoyl-coenzyme A-desaturase-1.

However, this elevated rate was abolished by in vitro cimaterol. Insulin had no stimulatory effect on  in cimaterol-fed sheep. Lipolysis was depressed by cimaterol feeding. However, 10(-4) M cimaterol stimulated lipolysis in the adipose tissue from both control and cimaterol-fed sheep. Insulin inhibited stimulated lipolysis in adipose tissue from control sheep but had no effect on the stimulated lipolysis in cimaterol-fed sheep. Mean adipocyte diameter was smaller (from 74 to 70 microns) and adipocyte size distribution also was changed in the cimaterol-fed sheep. Adipocyte number per gram of tissue was not affected by cimaterol. There was a significant increase in percentage of unsaturated fatty acids in adipose tissue from cimaterol-fed sheep. These results indicate that lipogenic and lipolytic responses to insulin and cimaterol in sheep adipose tissue were altered by cimaterol feeding.

These insulin-like effects are dependent on amine oxidation by semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase or by monoamine oxidase. The present study aimed to investigate whether amine oxidase substrates also exhibit another insulin-like property, the inhibition of lipolysis. We therefore tested the influence of tyramine and benzylamine on lipolytic activity in rat adipocytes. These amines did not modify basal lipolysis but dose-dependently counteracted the stimulation induced by lipolytic agents. The response to 10 nM isoprenaline was totally inhibited by tyramine 1 mM. The blockade produced by inhibition of amine oxidase activity or by 1 mM glutathione suggested that the generation of oxidative species, which occurs during amine oxidation, was involved in tyramine antilipolytic effect. Among the products resulting from amine oxidation, only hydrogen peroxide was antilipolytic in a manner that was potentiated by vanadate, as for tyramine or benzylamine. Antilipolytic responses to tyramine and to insulin were sensitive to wortmannin. These data suggest that inhibition of lipolysis is a novel insulin-like effect of amine oxidase substrates which is mediated by hydrogen peroxide generated during amine oxidation.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20448152>Cyclooxygenase-2 controls energy homeostasis in mice by de novo recruitment of brown adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Obesity results from chronic energy surplus and excess lipid storage in white adipose tissue (WAT). In contrast, brown adipose tissue (BAT) efficiently burns lipids through adaptive thermogenesis. Studying mouse models, we show that cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, a rate-limiting enzyme in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis, is a downstream effector of beta-adrenergic signaling in WAT and is required for the induction of BAT in WAT depots. PG shifted the differentiation of defined mesenchymal progenitors toward a brown adipocyte phenotype.

Supplementation of high-fat sucrose diet with AP prevented adiposity increase by inhibition of adipocyte hypertrophy. Rats supplemented with AP exhibited improved glucose tolerance while adipocytes isolated from these rats showed an enhanced lipolytic response to isoproterenol. AP intake led to reduced Lep, Plin, and sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (Srebf1) mRNA levels and increased aquaporin 7 (Aqp7), adipocyte enhancer binding protein 1 (Aebp1), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1 alpha (Ppargc1a) mRNA levels in epididymal adipocytes. In addition, we found different methylation patterns of Aqp7, Lep, Ppargc1a, and Srebf1 promoters in adipocytes from apple-supplemented rats compared to high-fat sucrose fed rats. The administration of AP protects against body weight gain and fat deposition and improves glucose tolerance in rats. We propose that AP exerts the antiobesity effects through the regulation of genes involved in , lipolysis, and fatty acid oxidation, in a process that could be mediated in part by epigenetic mechanisms.© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The adipocyte differentiation was promoted by AEA whereas inhibited by NADA. No change was observed by the treatment of non-cytotoxic concentrations of 2-AG. The difference between AEA and NADA in the regulation of  is associated with their effects on PPARγ transactivation. AEA can directly activate PPARγ. The effect of AEA on PPARγ in hBM-MSCs may prevail over that on the CB1 receptor mediated signal transduction, giving rise to the AEA-induced promotion of . In contrast, NADA had no effect on the PPARγ activity in the PPARγ transactivation assay. The inhibitory effect of NADA on  in hBM-MSCs was reversed not by capsazepine, a TRPV1 antagonist, but by rimonabant, a CB1 antagonist/inverse agonist. Rimonabant by itself promoted  in hBM-MSCs, which may be interpreted as the result of the inverse agonism of the CB1 receptor. This result suggests that the constantly active CB1 receptor may contribute to suppress the adipocyte differentiation of hBM-MSCs.

Twelve normal body weight (NBW) and twelve intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) newborn piglets were collected and distributed into 4 treatments (Normal: N, Normal+Choline: N+C, IUGR: I, and IUGR+Choline: I+C) with 6 piglets in each treatment. At 23 d of age, NBW and IUGR pigs were fed basal or choline supplemented diets. The results showed that the IUGR pigs had significantly lower (P<0.05) BW as compared with the NBW pigs at 23 d, 73 d, and 120 d of age, however, there was a slight decreased (P>0.05) in BW of IUGR pigs than the NBW pigs at 200 d. Compared with the NBW pigs, pH of meat longissimus dorsi muscle was significantly lower (P<0.05), and the meat color was improved in IUGR pigs. The malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were significantly decreased (P<0.05), while triglyceride (TG) and IMF contents were significantly higher (P<0.05) in the IUGR pigs than the NBW pigs. IUGR up-regulated the mRNA gene expression of fatty acid synthetase (FAS) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). Dietary choline significantly increased (P<0.05) the BW at 120d of age, however, significantly decreased (P<0.05) the TG and IMF contents in both IUGR and NBW pigs.

Recognized as a cancer chemoprevention agent, an anti-inflammatory factor and an antioxidant molecule, resveratrol has been proposed as a potential anti-obesity compound and to be beneficial in diabetes. Most of the studies demonstrating the anti-adipogenic action of resveratrol were performed as long-term treatments on cultured preadipocytes. The aim of this study was to analyse the acute effects of resveratrol on glucose uptake and lipolysis in human mature adipocytes. Samples of subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue were obtained from overweight humans and immediately digested by liberase. Fat cells were incubated (from 45 min to 4 h) with resveratrol 1 μM-1 mM. Then, glycerol release or hexose uptake was determined. Regarding lipolysis, the significant effects of resveratrol were found at 100 μM, consisting in a facilitation of isoprenaline stimulation and an impairment of insulin antilipolytic action. At 1 and 10 μM, resveratrol only tended to limit glucose uptake. Resveratrol 100 μM did not change basal glucose uptake but impaired its activation by insulin or by benzylamine. This inhibition was not found with other antioxidants. Such impairment of glucose uptake activation in fat cells may led to a reduced availability of glycerol phosphate and then to a decreased triacylglycerol assembly. Therefore, resveratrol increased triacylglycerol breakdown triggered by β-adrenergic activation and impaired . Consequently, our data indicate that resveratrol can be considered as limiting fat accumulation in human fat cells and further support its use for the mitigation of obesity.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17704823>Role and regulation of acylethanolamides in energy balance: focus on adipocytes and beta-cells.</a></h2><p>The endocannabinoid, arachidonoylethanolamide (AEA), and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha ligand, oleylethanolamide (OEA) produce opposite effects on . The regulation of OEA and its anti-inflammatory congener, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), in adipocytes and pancreatic beta-cells has not been investigated. We report here the results of studies on acylethanolamide regulation in these cells during obesity and hyperglycaemia, and provide an overview of acylethanolamide role in metabolic control. We analysed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry OEA and PEA levels in: 1) mouse 3T3F442A adipocytes during insulin-induced differentiation, 2) rat insulinoma RIN m5F beta-cells kept in 'low' or 'high' glucose, 3) adipose tissue and pancreas of mice with high fat diet-induced obesity (DIO), and 4) in visceral fat or blood of obese or type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. In adipocytes, OEA levels remain unchanged during differentiation, whereas those of PEA decrease significantly, and are under the negative control of both leptin and PPAR-gamma. PEA is significantly downregulated in subcutaneous adipose tissue of DIO mice. In RIN m5F insulinoma beta-cells, OEA and PEA levels are inhibited by 'very high' glucose, this effect being enhanced by insulin, whereas in cells kept for 24 h in 'high' glucose, they are stimulated by both glucose and insulin. Elevated OEA and PEA levels are found in the blood of T2D patients. Reduced PEA levels in hypertrophic adipocytes might play a role in obesity-related pro-inflammatory states.

In this experiment, the impact of genistein on  and lipolysis was studied in isolated rat adipocytes. Incubation of the cells (10(6) cells/ml in plastic tubes at 37 degrees C with Krebs-Ringer buffer, 90 min) with genistein (0.01, 0.3, 0.6 and 1 mM) clearly restricted (1 nM) [U-14C]glucose conversion to total lipids in the absence and presence of insulin. When [14C]acetate was used as the substrate for , genistein (0.01, 0.1 and 1 mM) exerted a similar effect. Thus, the anti-lipogenetic action of genistein may be an effect not only of alteration in glucose transport and metabolism, but this phytoestrogen can also restrict the fatty acids synthesis and/or their esterification. Incubation of adipocytes with estradiol at the same concentrations also resulted in restriction of , but the effect was less marked. Genistein (0.1 and 1 mM) augmented basal lipolysis in adipocytes. This process was strongly restricted by insulin (1 microM) and H-89 (an inhibitor of protein kinase A; 50 microM) and seems to be primarily due to the inhibitory action of the phytoestrogen on cAMP phosphodiesterase in adipocytes. Genistein at the smallest concentration (0.01 mM) augmented epinephrine-stimulated (1 microM) lipolysis but failed to potentiate lipolysis induced by forskolin (1 microM) or dibutyryl-cAMP (1 mM). These results suggest genistein action on the lipolytic pathways before activation of adenylate cyclase. The restriction of lipolysis stimulated by several lipolytic agents--epinephrine, forskolin and dibutyryl-cAMP were observed when adipocytes were incubated with genistein at highest concentrations (0.1 and 1 mM). These results prove the inhibitory action of this phytoestrogen on the final steps of the lipolytic cascade, i.e. on protein kinase A or hormone sensitive lipase. Estradiol, added to the incubation medium, did not affect lipolysis.

The heifers were slaughtered in two groups, based on initial weight. Adipose tissue from several anatomical sites and longissimus muscle (depending on slaughter group) were obtained fresh at slaughter. Changes in carcass characteristics elicited by clenbuterol were similar to those reported by others for steers and sheep. Subcutaneous (sc) and intramuscular (im), but not perirenal, adipocytes were smaller and there were more cells per g tissue in the adipose tissue depots of the clenbuterol-fed heifers. Clenbuterol decreased lipogenic enzyme activities, fatty acid-binding protein activity, basal lipolysis and acetate incorporation into glyceride-fatty acids (P less than .05) in sc adipose tissue, but had no effect (P greater than .05) on  or lipolysis in im adipose tissue.

The present studies evaluated the progressive changes in ovarian cytoarchitecture, endocrine expression, and reproductive tract cytolipidemic parameters that promote reproductive failure and ovarian involution during the pre-onset, initial, progressive, and chronic expression stages of the DOS. Paired littermate control (normal: +/?) and diabetic (mutant: db/db) C57BL/KsJ females were selected for analysis of ovarian parameters at 2 weeks (pre-onset expression of DOS), 4 weeks (initial DOS expression), 8 weeks (progressive DOS: hyper-glycemic/lipidemic), and 16 weeks (overt/chronic DOS expression) of age. All 4- to 16-week-old (db/db) groups were obese, hyperglycemic, and hyperinsulinemic as compared with age-matched (+/?) controls. Prior to phenotypic expression of the DOS (2 week groups), ovarian interstitial cytolipidemia characterized the perifollicular and cortical regions of db/db tissue samples relative to +/? indices, while comparable body weight, blood glucose, as well as serum insulin and ovarian steroid hormone concentrations characterized both the +/? and db/db groups. Overt DOS expression in the 4-week-old db/db groups was characterized by body obesity, systemic hyperglycemia-hyperinsulinemia, and extensive hypercytolipidemia of ovarian folliculothecal compartments, as well as enhanced tissue lipase activities. By 8 weeks of age, progressive hypercytolipidemia characterized interstitial, thecal, and follicular granulosa cell layers of db/db tissue samples concurrent with suppressed ovarian steroid hormone production, enhanced lipid sequestration, and exacerbation of systemic hyper-glycemia/insulinemia. By 16 weeks of age, the chronic-DOS was characterized by extensive ovarian follicular involution, cortical perivascular hyperlipidemic infiltration, thecal cell atrophy, and follicular granulosa lipid imbibition. These data indicate that db/db mutation-induced ovarian structural and functional involution is a direct reflection of the cellular metabolic shift towards , indicated by the progressive cytoarchitectural transformation into adipocyte-like entities. The cytological indications of cellular metabolic compromise, which precede the phenotypic expression of the DOS indices, suggests that correction of these abnormal shifts in ovarian endocrine and cellular metabolism may restore, delay, or prevent the further compromise of ovarian function by db/db mutation expression.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16432541>Fat-specific transgenic expression of resistin in the spontaneously hypertensive rat impairs fatty acid re-esterification.</a></h2><p>To investigate the mechanism by which fat-specific transgenic expression of resistin affects fatty acid metabolism in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR).Basal- and adrenaline-stimulated lipolysis, basal- and insulin-stimulated  as well as the site (glycerol versus acyl moiety) of glucose incorporated into triglycerides were determined in adipose tissue isolated from SHR-Resistin transgenic and SHR control rats.A moderate expression of transgenic resistin in adipose tissue was associated with significant increase in the FFA/glycerol ratio during adrenaline-stimulated lipolysis in the SHR-Resistin transgenic rats (3.27+/-0.26) compared to SHR controls (2.11+/-0.10, P=0.0005).

Current protocols for  induction in stromal vascular fraction-derived preadipocytes require extended culturing periods and have low adipogenic rates. We compared the adipogenic efficiency of a 7-d co-culture model of visceral (VIS) and subcutaneous (SC) stromal vascular fraction-derived preadipocytes with mature adipocytes with a 14-d standard adipocyte differentiation protocol. We obtained preadipocytes and mature adipocytes from SC and VIS adipose tissue of nonlactating, nongestating Holstein cows (n = 6).  induction was performed using a standard protocol for 7 (SD7; control) or 14 d (SD14), and a co-culture model for 7 d (CC7). Culture conditions, including medium composition, were the same for all treatments. For CC7, 900 primary adipocytes/cm were placed in 0.4-μm transwell inserts and co-cultured with preadipocytes for  induction. Both CC7 and SD14 similarly stimulated gene expression of adipogenic genes such as ADIPOQ, CEBPA, and CEBPB in VIS and SC. The CC7 increased triacylglycerol accumulation compared with SD14 and SD7. CC7 augmented triacylglycerol accumulation by 40- and 16-fold in SC and VIS compared with 22- and 4-fold increment in SD14, respectively. Lipolytic responses to 2-h β-adrenergic stimulation with 1 µM isoproterenol were higher in CC7 and SD14 than SD7 in SC; CC7 increased glycerol release compared with SD7 in VIS but SD7 and SD14 had similar responses. Overall, CC7 was more efficient in inducing  in preadipocytes from VIS and SC than SD14. Furthermore, CC7 stimulated similar lipolysis and lipogenic responses than SD14 but in a shorter time.

Overfed obese rats produce a blood-borne factor that inhibits adipose fatty acid synthesis in their partners, resulting in loss of body fat without significant inhibition of food intake. An in vitro bioassay was developed to test small serum samples for antilipogenic activity. Epididymal adipocytes from ad libitum-fed rats were preincubated for 12 h with 2% serum. Basal adipocyte fatty acid synthesis, measured in a subsequent serum-free incubation, was inhibited by obese serum. Insulin response was not changed. Characterization studies indicated that the factor was probably a protein, larger than 30 kDa, but not a protease or a low-density lipoprotein and was not associated with serum albumin. Physiological experiments demonstrated that the agent was produced when body weight was raised substantially above "set-point." Inhibitory activity was neither species specific nor pituitary dependent.

Because cAMP is known to promote  and because an association exists between body fat mass, hypertension, and increased sympathetic stimulation, we examined the influence of cAMP on angiotensinogen (ATG) expression and secretion in rat adipose tissue. Exposure of primary cultured differentiated preadipocytes to the cAMP analog 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-BrcAMP) or cAMP-stimulating agents (forskolin and IBMX) results in a significant increase in ATG mRNA levels. In adipose tissue fragments, 8-BrcAMP also increases ATG mRNA levels and protein secretion, but not in the presence of the protein kinase A inhibitor H89. The addition of isoproterenol, known to stimulate the synthesis of intracellular cAMP via beta-adrenoreceptors, had the same stimulatory effect on ATG expression and secretion. These results indicate that cAMP in vitro upregulates ATG expression and secretion in rat adipose tissue via the protein kinase A-dependent pathway.

The analysis of extracellular -choline uptake revealed a deficit in the amount of -choline found inside NECL4-deficient Schwann cells, suggestive of either reduced transport capabilities or increased metabolization of transported choline. An extensive lipidomic screen of choline derivatives showed that total phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol (but not diacylglycerol or sphingomyelin) are significantly elevated in NECL4-deficient Schwann cells, particularly specific subspecies of phosphatidylcholine carrying very long polyunsaturated fatty acid chains.

CART deficient mice exhibit islet dysfunction, impaired insulin secretion and increased body weight. A mutation in the CART gene in humans is associated with reduced metabolic rate, obesity and diabetes. Furthermore, CART is upregulated in islets of type-2 diabetic rats and regulates islet hormone secretion in vitro. While the function of CART in the nervous system has been extensively studied, there is no information on its expression or function in white adipose tissue. CART mRNA and protein were found to be expressed in both subcutaneous and visceral white adipose tissue from rat and man. Stimulating rat primary adipocytes with CART significantly potentiated isoprenaline-induced lipolysis, and hormone sensitive lipase activation (phosphorylation of Ser 563). On the other hand, CART significantly potentiated the inhibitory effect of insulin on isoprenaline-induced lipolysis. CART inhibited insulin-induced glucose uptake and , which was associated with inhibition of PKB phosphorylation.

The recruitment of BRITE adipocytes, referred to as the browning of WAT, is hallmarked by the expression of UCP1 and exerts beneficial metabolic effects. Here we address whether beyond systemic cues depot- and strain-specific variation in BRITE recruitment is determined by a cellular program intrinsic to progenitors. Therefore we compared the browning capacity of serum and investigated brown and BRITE  in primary cultures of stromal-vascular cells isolated from interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT), inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) and epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) in two inbred mouse strains C57BL/6J (B6, a strain with low browning propensity) and 129/S6SvEv (129, a strain with high browning propensity). Paradoxically, serum collected from B6 mice was more potent in the promotion of browning than serum collected from 129 mice. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that depot- and strain-specific differences observed in vivo are pheno-copied in primary cultures in vitro, as judged by UCP1 expression and by functional analysis. Notably, primary adipocytes from 129 mice had a higher capacity for isoproterenol-induced uncoupled respiration than B6. We conclude that cues intrinsic to the progenitor cells contribute to differential BRITE . Further analyses demonstrate that these cues are independent of autocrine/paracrine mechanisms, BRITE progenitor abundance and genetic variation in the gene regulatory region of Ucp1 but rather depend on trans-acting factors.

The CAF-SED group presented higher leptin and free fatty acid and lower adiponectin serum levels compared with other groups. Lipolytic activity (in mmol/10(6) adipose cells) stimulated by isoproterenol increased in CHOW-TR (16347±3005), CAF-SED (18110±3788) and CAF-TR (15837±2845) compared with CHOW-SED (8377±2284). The CAF-SED group reduced FAS activity compared with CHOW-SED and CHOW-TR, reduced citrate synthase activity and increased DGAT2 content compared with other groups. Both trained groups reduced G6PDH activity and increased the expression of p-AMPK (Thr172) compared with sedentary groups. CAF-SED group had lower levels of AMPK, p-AMPK (Thr172), ACC and p-ACC (Ser79) compared with other groups.The prevention of IR by PT is mediated by adaptations in WAT metabolism by improving lipolysis, preventing an increase in enzymes responsible for fatty acid esterification and by activating enzymes that improve fat oxidation instead of fat storage.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We studied abdominal and gluteal sc adipose tissue from seven GH-deficient children 1) before beginning and 2) after 3 months of therapy with exogenous GH (0.1 mg/kg, sc, three times per week). In abdominal and gluteal adipocytes, we measured lipid content and rates of in vitro lipolysis and  in response to insulin and various adrenoreceptor agonists. These results were correlated with measures of statural growth and adipose tissue distribution in each subject. We found that GH therapy was associated with a significant reduction in abdominal adipocyte size (0.68 +/- 0.09 micrograms lipid/cell before therapy vs. 0.49 +/- 0.07 after therapy; P less than 0.05), a significant reduction in overall basal rates of  (0.43 +/- 0.06 mumol [14C]acylglyceride synthesized/10(6) cells.2 h before therapy vs. 0.27 +/- 0.09 after therapy), and with variable desensitization of abdominal sc adipose tissue to the antilipolytic effect of insulin. The extent of this decrease in insulin action was significantly correlated with changes in abdominal adipocyte lipid content (r = 0.77; P less than 0.05), and with the changes in the anatomical distribution of fat during the study period (r = 0.97; P less than 0.001), as measured by the relative lipid content per adipocyte at each site. We conclude that the site-specific changes in adipose distribution during GH administration are due in part to anatomical site-specific GH-mediated changes in insulin responsiveness of adipose tissue and that exogenous GH therapy is associated with a decrease in de novo triglyceride synthesis in GH-deficient children.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12384823>Effects of the G-protein beta3 subunit 825T allele on  and lipolysis in cultured human preadipocytes and adipocytes.</a></h2><p>The recently discovered C825T polymorphism of the G-protein beta 3 subunit has been reported to be associated with the development of hypertension and obesity. The aim of our study was to investigate the relationship between the C825T polymorphism and functional aspects of human adipose cells, particularly with regard to adipose differentiation and lipolysis. Adipose tissue samples were collected from 65 women with a BMI ranging from 19.7 to 39.7 kg/m 2 undergoing surgical mammary reduction. The stromal cells were allowed to undergo differentiation in primary culture using adipogenic media of defined composition. No significant difference was observed between the CC carriers and the carriers of the T allele under all adipogenic conditions with differentiation capacity related to the genotype. In a subgroup of patients (n = 20), lipolysis in isolated fat cells was determined by measurement of glycerol in the culture medium upon catecholamine exposure. Glycerol release after 10(-7) mmol/l isoproterenol was significantly higher in fat cells from the 10 CC carriers than in adipocytes from the T allele carriers when expressed as percentage of basal glycerol release (increase above baseline: CC: 809 +/- 174 %, T allele carriers: 247 +/- 88 %, p = 0.01), while basal glycerol concentrations were no different according to genotype after controlling for either age or BMI.

To clarify expression and regulation of this adipocytokine, visfatin mRNA was measured by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in 3T3-L1 adipocytes during  and after treatment with various hormones known to alter insulin sensitivity. Visfatin expression was about 6-fold higher in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in vitro as compared with epididymal fat in vivo and increased during adipogenic conversion more than 3-fold. Interestingly, 100 nM dexamethasone significantly increased visfatin mRNA by almost 1.5-fold. In contrast, 500 ng/ml growth hormone (GH), 10 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, and 10 microM isoproterenol downregulated visfatin expression by 45%, 36%, and 43% respectively. Insulin did not influence synthesis of this adipocytokine. The effects of dexamethasone, GH, TNFalpha and isoproterenol were time- and dose-dependent. Furthermore, activation of G(s)-protein-coupled pathways by forskolin and cholera toxin was sufficient to significantly downregulate visfatin mRNA. Taken together, our results show a differential regulation of visfatin mRNA by insulin resistance-inducing hormones, supporting the view that this adipo-cytokine might be an interesting novel candidate linking core components of the metabolic syndrome such as obesity and insulin resistance.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10422727>Chronic administration of BRL 26830A for 9 weeks improves insulin sensitivity but does not prevent weight gain in gold-thioglucose obese mice.</a></h2><p>BRL 26830A, a beta adrenoceptor agonist, has been shown to have antiobesity and antidiabetic properties in rodents.

BRL 26830A slowed the rate of weight gain in GTG such that mice weighed significantly less between 2 w and 7 w of treatment. However, at the time of sacrifice (9 w), there was no difference in body weight between treated and untreated GTG.

However, weight and fatty acid (FA) content of BAT were reduced, suggesting increased lipid turnover and thermogenesis. , FA content and fat pad weight were unchanged in white adipose tissue (WAT) and decreased in liver of GTG. Glucose tolerance was improved in both CON and GTG. Hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and changes in cardiac and hepatic glucose oxidation as indicated by PDHC activity were normalized.

Neither adrenergic agonists nor cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase inhibitors alone caused a change of more than 2-fold in the basal cyclic AMP content of acini. Together, however, these agents provoked increases of around 20-fold in acini cyclic AMP content. Forskolin caused similar effects.

NAFLD includes a spectrum of pathological hepatic changes, such as steatosis, steatohepatitis, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Bisdemethoxycurcumin (BDMC) is polyphenolic compounds with a diarylheptanoid skeleton, curcumin close analogues, which is derived from the Curcumae Longae Rhizoma. While the rich bioavailability research of curcumin, BDMC is the poor studies. We investigated whether BDMC has the hepatoprotective effect and combinatory preventive effect with silymarin on methionine choline deficient (MCD)-diet-induced NAFLD in C57BL/6J mice. C57BL/6J mice were divided into five groups of normal (normal diet without any treatment), MCD diet (MCD diet only), MCD + silymarin (SIL) 100 mg/kg group, MCD + BDMC 100 mg/kg group, MCD + SIL 50 mg/kg + BDMC 50 mg/kg group. Body weight, liver weight, liver function tests, histological changes were assessed and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses were conducted after 4 weeks. Mice lost body weight on the MCD-diet, but BDMC did not lose less than the MCD-diet group. Liver weights decreased from BDMC, but they increased significantly in the MCD-diet groups. All liver function test values decreased from the MCD-diet, whereas those from the BDMC increased significantly. The MCD- diet induced severe hepatic fatty accumulation, but the fatty change was reduced in the BDMC. The BDMC showed an inhibitory effect on liver  by reducing associated gene expression caused by the MCD-diet. In all experiments, the combinations of BDMC with SIL had a synergistic effect against MCD-diet models. In conclusion, our findings indicate that BDMC has a potential suppressive effect on NAFLD. Therefore, our data suggest that BDMC may act as a novel and potent therapeutic agent against NAFLD.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17654485>Lipolysis is stimulated by PEGylated conjugated linoleic acid through the cyclic adenosine monophosphate-independent signaling pathway in 3T3-L1 cells: activation of MEK/ERK MAPK signaling pathway and hyper-secretion of adipo-cytokines.</a></h2><p>We previously reported that PEGylated conjugated linoleic acid (PCLA) as a pro-drug treatment of cultures of 3T3-L1 cells containing differentiated adipocytes caused de-differentiation by downregulation of PPARgamma2-induced , and cell apoptosis induced by PCLA was lower than that induced by conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) owing to the biocompatible and hydrophilic properties of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). To further investigate our previous observations, the present study is designed to evaluate the lipolytic action of PCLA and its role in biochemical signaling pathways of 3T3-L1 cells when compared to the CLA itself. Although both CLA and PCLA stimulated lipolysis, our results indicated a sensitivity difference between CLA and PCLA treatment: a time-dependent effect on lipolysis and p-extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK) expression was observed for PCLA-treated, but not for CLA-treated cultures. Also, the induction by PCLA of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation was linked to secretion of adipo-cytokines, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-8 (IL-8), in time-dependent manners. Interestingly, adenylyl cyclase inhibitor, 2', 5'-dideoxyadenosine (DDA), pre-treatment did not prevent PCLA-stimulated lipolysis. In fact, isoproterenol, but not PCLA, caused a significant increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, suggesting that the PCLA-induced lipolysis was not mediated in the conventional cAMP-dependent pathway and the cAMP was the intracellular mediator for isoproterenol-induced lipolysis.

Glycerol concentration in culture supernatants was used as a marker of adipocyte lipolysis. Isoproterenol, a β-adrenergic agonist and a known lipolytic agent, was used as a positive control in our assays. Lipolysis was stimulated by all extracts, although statistical significance was noted for fermented (oxidised) C. maculata only. A concentration of 80μg/ml of C. maculata extract induced maximal lipolysis (1.8-fold, p<0.001). The increased lipolysis was accompanied by an increase in the expression of hormone sensitive lipase (1.6-fold, p<0.05) and perilipin (1.6-fold, p<0.05).

All pitfalls were ensured by follow-up, imaging and/or histology. We also performed whole body F-choline PET/CT in 5 female patients.169/1000 (16.9%) patients showed pitfalls not owing to prostate cancer. These findings were due to inflammation, benign tumors while, in 1% of examined patients, a concomitant neoplasm was found. In the female body, the breast showed low physiological uptake.The accurate knowledge of F-choline PET/CT bio-distribution and diagnostic pitfalls is essential. Correlative imaging and histological exam are often necessary to depict pitfalls. In women, the uptake in the breast is due to the physiological gradient of F-choline uptake in the exocrine glands.Our results confirm the possibility of F-choline uptake in several diseases other than prostate cancer. However, our experience was acquired on a large population and shows that a conspicuous amount of F-choline diagnostic pitfalls are easily recognizable and attributable to inflammation.

These effects are apparently not mediated at the insulin receptor level since insulin binding is not altered in arachidonate-enriched fat cells. In addition, effects on antilipolytic and lipogenic are not specific for arachidonic acid. Oleic or palmitic acid can mimic these effects in both insulin-stimulated and PGE2-stimulated cells. Adipocyte enrichment with 20:4, however, specifically inhibits the insulin-stimulated turnover of phosphoinositides. The latter can be specifically prevented by preincubation with ibuprofen.

Two groups of 12 Dorset and Dorset-Finn cross ram lambs weighing 36 or 33 kg live weight were assigned to 3- or 6-week treatment intervals, respectively, to achieve similar slaughter weights. Six lambs within each treatment interval were fed ad libitum a complete mixed high-concentrate diet containing either 0 or 10 ppm cimaterol. During the first 12 hr of cimaterol administration plasma somatotropin (ST), thyroxine (T4), and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations were not altered by treatment, but plasma insulin, glucose, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and glycerol concentrations were elevated 2 hr after ingestion. These acute responses suggest direct stimulation of glycogenolysis and lipolysis by cimaterol, which is characteristic of beta-adrenergic alteration of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Chronic administration of cimaterol significantly decreased insulin concentrations by 36% and 52% at 3 and 6 weeks, respectively, while glucose concentrations remained unchanged. Serum IGF-I concentrations were not significantly altered by cimaterol. T4 levels were reduced 22.1% after 3 weeks of cimaterol treatment.

Lipid analysis and metabolic gene expression and signaling pathways were compared between untreated Pcyt2 mice, treated Pcyt2 mice, and Pcyt2 mice. The major positive effect of choline supplementation on IR muscle was the reduction of glucose utilization for FA and triglyceride (TAG) synthesis and increased muscle glucose storage as glycogen. Choline reduced the expression of genes for FA and TAG formation (Scd1, Fas, Srebp1c, Dgat1/2), upregulated the genes for FA oxidation (Cpt1, Pparα, Pgc1α), and had minor effects on phospholipid and lipolysis genes.

Perirenal (p.r.) adipocytes were smaller (P less than .05) in treated animals after 50 d, but this effect disappeared by the end of the experiment. There was no indication of a bimodal distribution of smaller s.c. or p.r. adipocytes in either of the treatment groups. Apparent hyperplasia of s.c. adipocytes occurred in the area of the 9-10-11th rib in both treated (P less than .10) and control animals (P less than .05) from 0 to 50 d on trial. Within treated animals there was a significant increase (P less than .05) in total adipocytes in this depot during the withdrawal period.

Adipocytes prepared from the epididymal fat pads of treated and untreated mice were used to examine the influence of CB on lipid metabolism. Using cells from untreated mice, CB stimulated lipolysis to an equivalent maximum rate as epinephrine (EPI), but CB was far less potent (EC50 (microM); CB = 5, EPI = 0.2). Both CB and EPI inhibited insulin-stimulated  over the physiological range of insulin concentrations. This inhibition was expressed as a dose-dependent decrease in tissue sensitivity to insulin and a decrease in maximal lipogenic capacity. Inhibition of maximal rate, but not of insulin sensitivity, could be stimulated by the addition of palmitate without EPI or CB. Adipocytes isolated from CB-treated mice did not differ from controls in sensitivity to insulin or in activity of fatty acid synthetase. Increased lipolysis and reduced  as observed in vitro with CB are consistent with reduced fat accretion in CB-treated mice. However, the absence of detectable changes in adipocyte  from CB-fed mice leaves open the question of the relevance of altered lipid metabolism to the observed changes in body composition.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25248563>Propranolol attenuates calorie restriction- and high calorie diet-induced bone marrow adiposity.</a></h2><p>We investigated the effects of β-adrenergic activation on bone marrow adiposity and on adipogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a control (CON), high calorie (HIGH) or low calorie (LOW) diet for 12 weeks. In each group, mice were treated with vehicle (VEH) or propranolol. The number of adipocytes per area bone marrow was increased in LOWVEH and HIGHVEH mice compared with CONVEH mice, which was attenuated by propranolol. Isoproterenol increased lipid droplet accumulation and adipogenic marker gene expression in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and mouse BMSCs, which were blocked by propranolol. Conditioned medium obtained from MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts suppressed adipogenic differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, which was significantly attenuated by treatment of MC3T3-E1 cells with isoproterenol.

We investigated the mechanisms underlying the metabolic and vascular effects of glucose or fructose intake and determined whether these effects are exclusively related to increased calorie consumption. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were supplemented with 20% wt/vol glucose or fructose for 2 mo, and plasma analytes and aortic response to vasodilator and vasoconstrictor agents were determined. Expression of molecules associated with lipid metabolism, insulin signaling, and vascular response were evaluated in hepatic and/or aortic tissues. Caloric intake was increased in both sugar-supplemented groups vs. control and in glucose- vs. fructose-supplemented rats. Hepatic  was induced in both groups. Plasma triglycerides were increased only in the fructose group, together with decreased expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A and increased microsomal triglyceride transfer protein expression in the liver. Plasma adiponectin and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α expression was increased only by glucose supplementation. Insulin signaling in liver and aorta was impaired in both sugar-supplemented groups, but the effect was more pronounced in the fructose group. Fructose supplementation attenuated aortic relaxation response to a nitric oxide (NO) donor, whereas glucose potentiated it. Phenylephrine-induced maximal contractions were reduced in the glucose group, which could be related to increased endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation and subsequent elevated basal NO in the glucose group. In conclusion, despite higher caloric intake in glucose-supplemented rats, fructose caused worse metabolic and vascular responses. This may be because of the elevated adiponectin level and the subsequent enhancement of PPARα and eNOS phosphorylation in glucose-supplemented rats.This is the first study comparing the effects of glucose and fructose consumption on metabolic factors and aortic function in female rats. Our results show that, although total caloric consumption was higher in glucose-supplemented rats, fructose ingestion had a greater impact in inducing metabolic and aortic dysfunction.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9389517>3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response sequences of the uncoupling protein gene are sequentially recruited during darglitazone-induced brown adipocyte differentiation.</a></h2><p>Uncoupling protein-1 (UCP) is uniquely expressed in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and is essential to the thermogenic function of this tissue. The UCP gene is under the control of norepinephrine (NE) via cAMP. However, the precise delineation of the cAMP response sequences and mechanisms whereby cAMP stimulate the gene have remained elusive. A BAT tumor cell line, HIB-1B, can be differentiated into UCP-expressing brown adipocytes. We report here that when these cells are differentiated with a standard differentiation protocol including insulin, T3, hydrocortisone, IBMX, and indomethacin (standard differentiation, StD), cAMP stimulation of the rat UCP gene is largely mediated by an upstream 90-bp sequence -2,399/-2,490 (R90) with a lesser contribution of a downstream sequence -57/+114 (dnCRS). This latter is functional also in non-BAT cells, whereas the cAMP response sequence contained in R90 (upCRS) is BAT-specific. Thiazolidinediones (TZD) are a new group of drugs known to increase sensitivity to insulin and, more recently, to induce adipocyte differentiation () via PPARgamma. A TZD, darglitazone (darg), can rapidly induce differentiation of HIB-1B cells, as judged by the expression of the adipocyte lipid binding protein (aP2), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), uncoupling protein (UCP) and beta3-adrenergic receptors. UCP messenger RNA (mRNA) responsive to NE is evidenced as early as one day after exposure to darg. While UCP-CAT vectors (+114/-3673 bp of rat UCP gene) are barely responsive to NE in HIB-1B preadipocytes, both darg and StD markedly enhance NE responsiveness of such constructs. However, by 3 days of exposure to darg, the responses were less vigorous than in StD cells (4- to 10-fold vs. 20- to 50-fold), and the deletion of R90 did not affect the response to NE in darg-differentiated cells, whereas this deletion caused a 75% reduction in StD cells. Prolongation of darg exposure to 5-7 days resulted in greater response of UCP mRNA to NE and 50-80% inhibition of the response of UCP-CAT vectors by the deletion of R90. Thus, darg-induced differentiation of HIB-1B cells suggests that the NE-dependent expression of the UCP gene takes place in a step-wise manner: first, the gene is "enabled," as no UCP mRNA is detected in HIB-1B preadipocytes; thereafter and transiently, the response of the gene to NE is sustained by dnCRS; finally, as differentiation progresses, a cell-specific and more powerful cis-acting sequence, upCRS, is recruited, accounting in the fully differentiated cell for most of the response to NE. These results also suggest that TZDs might increase energy expenditure by inducing terminal differentiation of BAT, and that these drugs may be useful in the differential cloning of the factors involved in the recruitment of the BAT specific cAMP response sequence.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9250510>Effects of prenatal androgenization and lactation on adipose tissue metabolism in finishing single-calf heifers.</a></h2><p>Twelve control (C) and 12 prenatally androgenized (PA) lactating (L) first-calf heifers and five (two C and three PA) similar, nonlactating (NL) heifers were used to assess the effects of PA and L on the metabolic activity of s.c. adipose tissue (AT). Heifers were fed an 85% concentrate diet, and their calves were weaned at 112 +/- 1 d of age. Adipose tissue was biopsied at approximately 77 d (period 1, during lactation for L heifers) and 126 d (period 2, after L heifers had calves weaned) postpartum. The NL heifers gained .22 kg/d faster (P = .20) and had greater fat deposition than L heifers during period 1. The PA heifers were fatter and gained 14.6% faster than C heifers during lactation. Epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE) increased in vitro fatty acid (FA) release 25 (P < .01) and 15% (P < .06), respectively, above basal rates. Near-maximal release of FA, as estimated by stimulation with E plus theophylline plus adenosine deaminase (ETAD), was 73% (4,110 vs 2,379 +/- 161 nEq/[2 h.100 mg of tissue]; P < .01) above basal rates.

Stimulation of FA release by E (P = .22) or NE (P = .31) did not differ between C and PA.

The aim of this work was to verify whether prolonged treatment with a beta3-adrenergic agonist known to stimulate lipid mobilisation, could promote desensitization of beta-adrenergic responses. Wistar rats and guinea pigs were treated during one week with CL 316243 (CL, 1 mg/kg/d) by implanted osmotic minipumps. In control animals, beta3-adrenergic agonists were lipolytic in rat but not in guinea pig adipocytes. CL-treatment did not alter body weight gain in both species, but reduced fat stores in rats. Lipolysis stimulation by forskolin was unmodified but responses to beta1-, beta2- and beta3-agonists were reduced in visceral or subcutaneous white adipose tissues of CL-treated rats. Similarly, the beta3-adrenergic-dependent impairment of insulin action on glucose transport and  in rat adipocytes was diminished after CL-treatment. In rat adipocytes, [125I]ICYP binding and beta3-adrenoceptor mRNA levels were reduced after sustained CL administration. These findings show that CL 316243 exerts (beta3-adrenergic lipolytic and antilipogenic effects in rat adipocytes. These actions, which are likely involved in the fat depletion observed in rat, also lead to the desensitization of all beta-adrenergic responses. Therefore this desensitization, together with the lack of slimming action in guinea pig, seriously attenuates the usefulness of beta3-agonists as antiobesity agents, and may explain why such agonists have not been conducted to a widespread clinical use.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12120815>Daidzein, coumestrol and zearalenone affect  and lipolysis in rat adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Daidzein, coumestrol and zearalenone - compounds called phytoestrogens, considered as active biological factors affecting many important physiological and biochemical processes appeared to be also significant regulators of adipocyte metabolism.

All tested compounds significantly attenuated glucose conversion to lipids. In the case of daidzein and coumestrol, this effect was probably due to inhibition of glycolysis. Daidzein (0.01, 0.1 and 1 mM), coumestrol (0.01 and 0.1 mM) and zearalenone (0.01, 0.1 and 1 mM) affected also basal and epinephrine-stimulated (1 microM) lipolysis. Daidzein (0.01 and 1 mM) augmented basal glycerides breakdown in adipocytes. The epinephrine-induced lipolysis was dependent on daidzein concentration and its stimulatory (0.1 mM) or inhibitory (1 mM) influence was observed. Zearalenone changed lipolysis only at the concentration of 1 mM and its effect was contradictory in the absence or presence of epinephrine (the stimulatory or inhibitory effect, respectively). Results obtained in experiments with inhibitors (insulin, 1 nM and H-89, 50 microM) and activators (dibutyryl-cAMP, 1 mM and forskolin, 1 microM) of lipolysis allowed us to assume that daidzein augmented basal lipolysis acting on PKA activity. The inhibitory effect of daidzein and zearalenone on epinephrine-induced lipolysis is probably due to restriction of HSL action. The influence of coumestrol on glycerides breakdown was less marked.

After 2 and 3 months on the diet, LSD rats showed increased amounts of lipid in carcass and retroperitoneal tissue. In both LSD and NSD, extending the feeding period from 2 to 3 months resulted in a marked reduction in the in vivo rates of adipose tissue fatty acid synthesis that was accompanied by increases in liver  and in the activity of adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase (LPL). However, these increases were more marked in LSD rats. Thus, in vivo rates of liver fatty synthesis and LPL activity in LSD rats, which were already higher (by about 35% and 20%, respectively) than in controls after 2 months, attained levels 50% higher than those in NSD animals after another month on the diet. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenic capacity, estimated after 2 and 3 months by the tissue temperature response to norepinephrine (NE) injection and by guanosine diphosphate (GDP) binding to BAT mitochondria, did not change in controls, but was significantly reduced in LSD rats. This raises the possibility that a decrease in overall energy expenditure, together with an LPL-induced increased uptake of preformed fatty acids from the circulation, may account for the excessive lipid accumulation in LSD rats. Taken together, the data indicate that prolonged dietary sodium restriction exacerbates normal, age-related changes in white and BAT metabolism.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2895488>[Beta adrenergic agonists.

The first chapter summarizes major data concerning the effects of beta-agonists on growth and carcass composition in cattle, sheep and pigs. The effect of clenbuterol and cimaterol on carcass quality is to increase the deposition of protein while reducing fat accretion. Then, we briefly consider the physiology and pharmacology of the sympathoadrenal system with a special attention to the distribution and properties of beta-adrenoceptors of various tissues which are putative targets for the beta-adrenergic agonists. Several mechanisms liable to be responsible for the anabolic action of these compounds are also discussed. This chapter includes the evaluation of the effects of beta-agonist on central nervous system and pancreas. A special attention is devoted to their metabolic impact on adipose tissue and muscle. In isolated fat cells, beta-agonists promote stimulation of lipolysis associated with reduction of  and of insulin action. The in vitro effects on adipocytes are consistent with the in vivo effects of the compounds. Beta-agonist impact on protein synthesis and muscle accretion is also discussed with reference: 1) to the vascular effects of the compounds that should modify the nutrient flow into the muscle, 2) to a reduction of proteolysis mainly observed for the moment in in vitro studies, 3) to the possible beta-adrenergic-dependent enhancement of insulin action on the muscle. However, more direct experimental evidence is still needed to clearly assess the nature of the action(s) of such anabolic agents on muscle.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25504041>The production of coagulation factor VII by adipocytes is enhanced by tumor necrosis factor-α or isoproterenol.</a></h2><p>A relationship has been reported between blood concentrations of coagulation factor VII (FVII) and obesity.

However, the production of FVII by adipocytes remains unclear.We herein investigated the production and secretion of FVII by adipocytes, especially in relation to obesity-related conditions including adipose inflammation and sympathetic nerve activation.C57Bl/6J mice were fed a low- or high-fat diet and the expression of FVII messenger RNA (mRNA) was then examined in adipose tissue. 3T3-L1 cells were used as an adipocyte model for in vitro experiments in which these cells were treated with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) or isoproterenol. The expression and secretion of FVII were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR, Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.The expression of FVII mRNA in the adipose tissue of mice fed with high-fat diet was significantly higher than that in mice fed with low-fat diet. Expression of the FVII gene and protein was induced during  and maintained in mature adipocytes. The expression and secretion of FVII mRNA were increased in the culture medium of 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with TNF-α, and these effects were blocked when these cells were exposed to inhibitors of mitogen-activated kinases or NF-κB activation. The β-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol stimulated the secretion of FVII from mature adipocytes via the cyclic AMP/protein kinase A pathway. Blockade of secreted FVII with the anti-FVII antibody did not affect the phosphorylation of Akt in the isoproterenol-stimulated adipocytes.Obese adipose tissue produced FVII. The production and secretion of FVII by adipocytes was enhanced by TNF-α or isoproterenol via different mechanisms.

In adipocytes, skeletal muscle, and pancreatic beta-cells, lipids are mobilized from acylglycerides by the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). Here, the consequences of a targeted disruption of the HSL gene for glucose homeostasis were examined. HSL null mice were slightly hyperglycemic in the fasted, but not fed state, which was accompanied by moderate hyperinsulinemia. During glucose challenges, however, disposal of the sugar was not affected in HSL null mice, presumably because of release of increased amounts of insulin. Impaired insulin sensitivity was further indicated by retarded glucose disposal during an insulin tolerance test. A euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp revealed that hepatic glucose production was insufficiently blocked by insulin in HSL null mice. In vitro, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into soleus muscle, and  in adipocytes were moderately reduced, suggesting additional sites of insulin resistance. Morphometric analysis of pancreatic islets revealed a doubling of beta-cell mass in HSL null mice, which is consistent with an adaptation to insulin resistance. Insulin secretion in vitro, examined by perifusion of isolated islets, was not impacted by HSL deficiency. Thus, HSL deficiency results in a moderate impairment of insulin sensitivity in multiple target tissues of the hormone but is compensated by hyperinsulinemia.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3076052>Effects of gastric inhibitory polypeptide on glucose and lipid metabolism of isolated rat adipocytes.</a></h2><p>The effects of gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) on glucose and lipid metabolism of isolated rat adipocytes were investigated.

Insulin binds to a specific receptor on the cell membrane initiating a protein phosphorylation cascade that controls glucose uptake and metabolism and long-term effects such as mitogenesis. This process also initiates insulin uptake and ultimate cellular metabolism in all insulin sensitive cells. The effects of insulin on other cellular metabolic properties have not been clearly related to this mechanism. Here we show that intracellular metabolism of insulin may be related to some aspects of insulin actions, specifically control of fat metabolism. A normal intracellular degradation product of insulin has been synthesized and tested for actions on fat turnover in cultured adipocytes. This 7-peptide, B-chain fragment (HLVEALY) inhibits both basal and stimulated lipolysis as measured by glycerol release, but does not inhibit FFA release because of a lack of effect on FFA reesterification in the adipocyte. HLVEALY also enhances insulin's effects on .

We have examined the role of adenosine and its interactions with insulin in adipose tissue by using A1R knock out (-/-) mice. Removal of endogenous adenosine with adenosine deaminase caused lipolysis in A1R (+/+), but not A1R (-/-) adipocytes. The adenosine analogue, 2-chloroadenosine, inhibited noradrenaline-stimulated lipolysis and cAMP accumulation in A1R (+/+), but not in A1R (-/-) adipocytes. Insulin reduces lipolysis and cAMP via another mechanism than adenosine and acted additively, but not synergistically, with adenosine. Plasma levels of free fatty acids, glycerol and triglycerides were significantly lower in A1R (+/+) than in A1R (-/-) mice after administration of an adenosine analogue. 2-chloroadenosine induced  in presence of insulin in A1R (+/+), but not in A1R (-/-) adipocytes. There were no changes in mRNA levels for several genes involved in fat synthesis in adipose tissue between genotypes. Body weight was similar in young A1R (+/+) and A1R (-/-) mice, but old male A1R (-/-) mice were heavier than wild type controls. In conclusion, adenosine inhibits lipolysis via the adenosine A1 receptor and other adenosine receptors play no significant role. Adenosine and insulin mediate additive but not synergistic antilipolytic effects and 2-chloroadenosine stimulates  via adenosine A1 receptors. Thus deletion of adenosine A1 receptors should increase lipolysis and decrease , but in fact an increased fat mass was observed, indicating that other actions of adenosine A1 receptors, possibly outside adipose tissue, are also important.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19779479>Mice deficient in phosphofructokinase-M have greatly decreased fat stores.</a></h2><p>Synthesis of triacylglycerol requires the glucose-derived glycerol component, and glucose uptake has been viewed as the rate-limiting step in glucose metabolism in adipocytes.

These results indicate an important role for PFK-M in adipose metabolism.

The rate of conversion of [3-3H]-glucose into lipid in fat cells was stimulated by elastase, trypsin, and insulin. When fat pads were incubated with elastase, trypsin, or insulin in the presence of glucose, pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in the homogenate of the incubated fat pads was markedly increased. In the absence of glucose, elastase did not increase pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, though trypsin and insulin showed a slight but significant increase. Further, the increasing effect of elastase in the presence of glucose was inhibited by the addition of 3-O-methylglucose or phlorizin to the incubation mixture of the fat pads. Trypsin and insulin still showed a significant increase under similar conditions. When the homogenate of intact fat pads was incubated with elastase, the pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was progressively decreased with increase in the concentration of elastase. Concanavalin A showed an additive effect on the pyruvate dehydrogenase activity increase caused by elastase, whereas such an effect was not observed with insulin or H2O2. The stimulation of lipolysis by epinephrine in the fat cells was not suppressed by elastase, in contrast to trypsin and insulin. These results suggest that elastase reacts with the cell surface, facilitates glucose transport into the fat cells, and consequently affects glucose and lipid metabolism by somewhat different mechanisms from those of insulin and trypsin.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2545976>Effects of active compounds isolated from Angelica shikokiana on lipid metabolism in fat cells.</a></h2><p>It was found that the EtO Ac fraction of the roots of Angelica shikokiana inhibited adrenaline-induced lipolysis in rat fat cells, while having no effect on ACTH-induced lipolysis. On the other hand, the MeOH fraction was found to inhibit ACTH-induced lipolysis but not to inhibit adrenaline-induced lipolysis. The active substances isolated from this root were elucidated to be psoralen (I), bergapten (II), isopteryxin(3'-angeloyloxy-4'-acetoxy-3',4'-dihydroseseli n) (III) and 3'-epoxyangeloyloxy-4'-acetoxy-3',4'-dihydroseselin (IV), respectively. The two furocoumarins, psoralen and bergapten, were found to enhance ACTH- and adrenaline-induced lipolysis in fat cells respectively. In contrast, a coumarin derivative of khellactone type, isopteryxin (III), was found to inhibit the adrenaline-induced lipolysis but with no effect on ACTH-induced lipolysis and insulin-induced  from glucose. The other coumarin of khellactone type, 3'(R), 4'(R)-3'-epoxyangeloyloxy-4'-acetoxy-3',4'-dihydroseseline (IV), was found to inhibit the insulin-induced  from glucose but it had no effect on adrenaline- and ACTH-induced lipolysis.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p></html>
