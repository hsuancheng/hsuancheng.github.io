To investigate the possible role of  metabolites on Ra during E stimulation, we infused E in trained conscious dogs before and during administration of two inhibitors of  metabolism, indomethacin (INDO) and salicylate (S). On separate days, experimental animals were treated with both oral and IV INDO and oral acetylsalicylic  and IV sodium salicylate. Ra and glucose utilization (Rd), both in mg x kg-1 min-1, were calculated by isotope dilution using 3-3H-glucose. After achieving steady state specific activity, control (C) and experimental animals (n = 6 per group) received E (0.1 ug x kg-1 min-1) for 150 minutes, raising plasma levels to approximately 1500 pg/mL in each group. In C, plasma glucose (G; mg/dL) rose by 17 +/- 5 at 10 minutes and 19 +/- 3 at 20 minutes due to an initial spike in Ra (2.7 +/- 0.2 to 4.9 +/- 0.5; P less than 0.01) at 10 minutes. INDO and S treatment attenuated this initial (10-20 minutes) rise in G (P less than 0.05) due to a lower stimulated Ra at 10 minutes (3.3 +/- 0.1 with INDO; 3.0 +/- 0.5 with S; P less than 0.05). After 20 minutes Ra was not different in the 3 groups; no overall differences in Rd, glucose clearance, or plasma insulin levels occurred with INDO or S treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><p>Keyword: gluconeogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15543094>Possible pathomechanisms of sudden infant death syndrome: key role of chronic hypoxia, infection/inflammation states, cytokine irregularities, and metabolic trauma in genetically predisposed infants.</a></h2><p>Chronic hypoxia, viral infections/bacterial toxins, inflammation states, biochemical disorders, and genetic abnormalities are the most likely trigger of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Autopsy studies have shown increased pulmonary density of macrophages and markedly more eosinophils in the lungs accompanied by increased T and B lymphocytes. The elevated levels of immunoglobulins, about 20% more muscle in the pulmonary arteries, increased airway smooth muscle cells, and increased fetal hemoglobin and erythropoietin are evidence of chronic hypoxia before death. Other abnormal findings included mucosal immune stimulation of the tracheal wall, duodenal mucosa, and palatine tonsils, and circulating interferon. Low normal or higher blood levels of cortisol often with petechiae on intrathoracic organs, depleted maternal IgG antibodies to endotoxin core (EndoCAb) and early IgM EndoCAb triggered, partial deletions of the C4 gene, and frequent IL-10-592*A polymorphism in SIDS victims as well as possible hypoxia-induced decreased production of antiinflammatory, antiimmune, and antifibrotic cytokine IL-10, may be responsible for the excessive reactions to otherwise harmless infections. In SIDS infants, during chronic hypoxia and times of infection/inflammation, several proinflammatory cytokines are released in large quantities, sometimes also representing a potential source of tissue damage if their production is not sufficiently well controlled, eg, by pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). These proinflammatory cytokines down-regulate gene expression of major cytochrome P-450 and/or other enzymes with the specific effects on mRNA levels, protein expression, and enzyme activity, thus affecting metabolism of several endogenous lipophilic substances, such as steroids, lipid-soluble vitamins, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxanes, and exogenous substances. In SIDS victims, chronic hypoxia, TNF-alpha and other inflammatory cytokines, and  (AA) as well as n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (FA), stimulated and/or augmented superoxide generation by polymorphonuclear leukocytes, which contributed to tissue damage. Chronic hypoxia, increased amounts of nonheme iron in the liver and adrenals of these infants, enhanced activity of CYP2C9 regarded as the functional source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in some endothelial cells, and nicotine accumulation in tissues also intensified production of ROS. These increased quantities of proinflammatory cytokines, ROS, AA, and nitric oxide (NO) also resulted in suppression of many CYP450 and other enzymes, eg, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), an enzyme important in the metabolism of FA during  and glyceroneogenesis. PEPCK deficit found in SIDS infants (caused also by vitamin A deficiency) and eventually enhanced by PACAP lipolysis of adipocyte triglycerides resulted in an increased FA level in blood because of their impaired reesterification to triacylglycerol in adipocytes. In turn, the overproduction and release of FA into the blood of SIDS victims could lead to the metabolic syndrome and an early phase of type 2 diabetes. This is probably the reason for the secondary overexpression of the hepatic CYP2C8/9 content and activity reported in SIDS infants, which intensified AA metabolism. Pulmonary edema and petechial hemorrhages often present in SIDS victims may be the result of the vascular leak syndrome caused by IL-2 and IFN-alpha. Chronic hypoxia with the release of proinflammatory mediators IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6, and overloading of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems due to the narrowing airways and small pulmonary arteries of these children could also contribute to the development of these abnormalities. Moreover, chronic hypoxia of SIDS infants induced also production of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha), which stimulated synthesis and release of different growth factors by vascular endothelial cells and intensified subclinical inflammatory reactions in the central nervous system, perhaps potentiated also by PACAP and VIP gene mutations. These processes could lead to the development of brainstem gliosis and disorders in the release of neuromediators important for physiologic sleep regulation. All these changes as well as eventual PACAP abnormalities could result in disturbed homeostatic control of the cardiovascular and respiratory responses of SIDS victims, which, combined with the nicotine effects and metabolic trauma, finally lead to death in these often genetically predisposed children.</p><p>Keyword: gluconeogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554135>Hepatic transcriptome and proteome analyses provide new insights into the regulator mechanism of dietary avicularin in diabetic mice.</a></h2><p>Many dietary flavonoids existing as glycosides in fruits and vegetables are considered bioactive food components with various potential health benefits. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex and polygenic disease with increasing global prevalence and economic burden. In this study, the hypoglycemic effect of avicularin (quercetin-3-O-α-arabinofuranoside), a flavonoid glycoside commonly found in natural plants and fruits, was determined in a high fat diet/streptozotocin induced type 2 diabetes mouse model. Our results demonstrated that dietary avicularin treatment reduced levels of fasting blood glucose, serum TG and LDL-C, liver AST and ALT, and increased hepatic glycogen in T2DM mice. Furthermore, we used RNA-Seq and iTRAQ to compare the gene and protein expression in the livers of the normal control mice (NC), diabetic control mice (DC) and avicularin treated mice (DA100). The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were analyzed based on gene annotations and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment. Integrated analysis of the RNA-Seq and iTRAQ data indicated that the fifteen DEGs/DEPs showed the same trend in mRNA and protein expression levels in comparisons of both NC vs DC and DC vs DA100. KEGG analysis revealed that four DEGs/DEPs (PKM, PEPCK, PYG, and PLA2) in the , gluconeogenesis, and  pathway, and six DEPs (Ndufb4, Ndufa6, Cox5a, Cox5b, Cox6c, and ATPSβ) in the oxidative phosphorylation signaling pathway, play important roles in avicularin's hypoglycemic effect. We also found six other DEGs/DEPs related to T2DM (CA1, Serpinb6a, AK, Pcolce, Cand2, and Atp2a3), and five related to cancer (Phgdh, Tes, Papss1, Psat1, and Fam49b). We did further verify by qRT-PCR and explored the possible binding modes of avicularin with targeted proteins with molecular docking simulations. Taken together, our results demonstrated the protective effects of avicularin against diabetes and provided a global view about the system-level hypoglycemic mechanisms of avicularin by the comprehensive analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data in T2DM mice.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The formation of acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate and glucose was measured in the isolated perfused rat liver after addition of fatty acids. 2. The rates of ketone-body formation from ten fatty acids were approximately equal and independent of chain length (90-132mumol/h per g), with the exception of pentanoate, which reacted at one-third of this rate. The [beta-hydroxybutyrate]/[acetoacetate] ratio in the perfusion medium was increased by long-chain fatty acids. 3. Glucose was formed from all odd-numbered fatty acids tested. 4. The rate of ketone-body formation in the livers of rats kept on a high-fat diet was up to 50% higher than in the livers of rats starved for 48h. In the livers of fat-fed rats almost all the O(2) consumed was accounted for by the formation of ketone bodies. 5. The ketone-body concentration in the blood of fat-fed rats rose to 4-5mm and the [beta-hydroxybutyrate]/[acetoacetate] ratio rose to 11.5. 6. When the activity of the microsomal mixed-function oxidase system, which can bring about omega-oxidation of fatty acids, was induced by treatment of the rat with phenobarbitone, there was no change in the ketone-body production from fatty acids, nor was there a production of glucose from even-numbered fatty acids. The latter would be expected if omega-oxidation occurred. Thus omega-oxidation did not play a significant role in the metabolism of fatty acids. 7. Arachidonate was almost quantitatively converted into ketone bodies and yielded no glucose, demonstrating that  from poly-unsaturated fatty acids with an even number of carbon atoms does not occur. 8. The rates of ketogenesis from unsaturated fatty acids (sorbate, undecylenate, crotonate, vinylacetate) were similar to those from the corresponding saturated fatty acids. 9. Addition of oleate together with shorter-chain fatty acids gave only a slightly higher rate of ketone-body formation than oleate alone. 10. Glucose, lactate, fructose, glycerol and other known antiketogenic substances strongly inhibited endogenous ketogenesis but had no effects on the rate of ketone-body formation in the presence of 2mm-oleate. Thus the concentrations of free fatty acids and of other oxidizable substances in the liver are key factors determining the rate of ketogenesis.</p><p>Keyword: gluconeogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12617750>Dietary effects of arachidonate-rich fungal oil and fish oil on murine hepatic and hippocampal gene expression.</a></h2><p>The functions, actions, and regulation of tissue metabolism affected by the consumption of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) from fish oil and other sources remain poorly understood; particularly how LC-PUFAs affect transcription of genes involved in regulating metabolism. In the present work, mice were fed diets containing fish oil rich in eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic , fungal oil rich in , or the combination of both. Liver and hippocampus tissue were then analyzed through a combined gene expression- and lipid- profiling strategy in order to annotate the molecular functions and targets of dietary LC-PUFA.Using microarray technology, 329 and 356 dietary regulated transcripts were identified in the liver and hippocampus, respectively. All genes selected as differentially expressed were grouped by expression patterns through a combined k-means/hierarchical clustering approach, and annotated using gene ontology classifications. In the liver, groups of genes were linked to the transcription factors PPARalpha, HNFalpha, and SREBP-1; transcription factors known to control lipid metabolism. The pattern of differentially regulated genes, further supported with quantitative lipid profiling, suggested that the experimental diets increased hepatic beta-oxidation and  while decreasing fatty  synthesis. Lastly, novel hippocampal gene changes were identified.Examining the broad transcriptional effects of LC-PUFAs confirmed previously identified PUFA-mediated gene expression changes and identified novel gene targets. Gene expression profiling displayed a complex and diverse gene pattern underlying the biological response to dietary LC-PUFAs. The results of the studied dietary changes highlighted broad-spectrum effects on the major eukaryotic lipid metabolism transcription factors. Further focused studies, stemming from such transcriptomic data, will need to dissect the transcription factor signaling pathways to fully explain how fish oils and  achieve their specific effects on health.</p><p>Keyword: gluconeogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30823619>Feed Restriction Reveals Distinct Serum Metabolome Profiles in Chickens Divergent in Feed Efficiency Traits.</a></h2><p>Restrictive feeding influences systemic metabolism of nutrients; however, this impact has not been evaluated in chickens of diverging feed efficiency. This study investigated the effect of ad libitum versus restrictive feeding (85% of ad libitum) on the serum metabolome and white blood cell composition in chickens of diverging residual feed intake (RFI; metric for feed efficiency). Blood samples were collected between days 33 and 37 post-hatch. While serum glucose was similar, serum uric  and cholesterol were indicative of the nutritional status and chicken's RFI, respectively. Feed restriction and RFI rank caused distinct serum metabolome profiles, whereby restrictive feeding also increased the blood lymphocyte proportion. Most importantly, 10 amino acids were associated with RFI rank in birds, whereas restrictive feeding affected almost all detected lysophosphatidylcholines, with 3 being higher and 6 being lower in restrictively compared to ad libitum fed chickens. As indicated by relevance networking, isoleucine, lysine, valine, histidine, and ornithine were the most discriminant for high RFI, whereas 3 biogenic amines (carnosine, putrescine, and spermidine) and 3 diacyl-glycerophospholipids (38:4, 38:5, and 40:5) positively correlated with feed intake and body weight gain, respectively. Only for taurine, feed intake mostly explained the RFI-associated variation, whereas for most metabolites, other host physiological factors played a greater role for the RFI-associated differences, and was potentially related to insulin-signaling, phospholipase A2, and  metabolism. Alterations in the hepatic synthesis of long-chain fatty acids and the need for precursors for  due to varying energy demand may explain the marked differences in serum metabolite profiles in ad libitum and restrictively fed birds.</p><p>Keyword: gluconeogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12583601>Lipid metabolism in pregnancy and its consequences in the fetus and newborn.</a></h2><p>During early pregnancy there is an increase in body fat accumulation, associated with both hyperphagia and increased lipogenesis. During late pregnancy there is an accelerated breakdown of fat depots, which plays a key role in fetal development. Besides using placental transferred fatty acids, the fetus benefits from two other products: glycerol and ketone bodies. Although glycerol crosses the placenta in small proportions, it is a preferential substrate for maternal , and maternal glucose is quantitatively the main substrate crossing the placenta. Enhanced ketogenesis under fasting conditions and the easy transfer of ketones to the fetus allow maternal ketone bodies to reach the fetus, where they can be used as fuels for oxidative metabolism as well as lipogenic substrates. Although maternal cholesterol is an important source of cholesterol for the fetus during early gestation, its importance becomes minimal during late pregnancy, owing to the high capacity of fetal tissues to synthesize cholesterol. Maternal hypertriglyceridemia is a characteristic feature during pregnancy and corresponds to an accumulation of triglycerides not only in very low-density lipoprotein but also in low- and high-density lipoprotein. Although triglycerides do not cross the placental barrier, the presence of lipoprotein receptors in the placenta, together with lipoprotein lipase, phospholipase A2, and intracellular lipase activities, allows the release to the fetus of polyunsaturated fatty acids transported as triglycerides in maternal plasma lipoproteins. Normal fetal development needs the availability of both essential fatty acids and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, and the nutritional status of the mother during gestation has been related to fetal growth. However, excessive intake of certain long chain fatty acids may cause both declines in  and enhanced lipid peroxidation, reducing antioxidant capacity.</p><p>Keyword: gluconeogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1516268>Regulation of proximal tubule function by angiotensin.</a></h2><p>1. Independent of its effects on renal haemodynamics and glomerular filtration, angiotensin II (AII) has direct actions on the proximal tubule involving transepithelial Na+, H+, HCO3-, and water reabsorption, ammoniagenesis,  and renal growth. 2. The effects of AII on water and electrolyte transport are biphasic and dose-dependent, such that low concentrations (10(-12)-10(-9) mol/L) stimulate reabsorption whereas high concentrations (10(-7)-10(-6) mol/L) inhibit reabsorption. Similar dose-response relations have been obtained for luminal and peritubular addition of AII. 3. The cellular responses to AII are mediated via an AT-1 receptor coupled via G-regulatory proteins to several parallel signal transduction pathways. Low doses inhibit the basolateral adenylate cyclase, lower intracellular cAMP and withdraw the inhibitory effect of protein kinase A on the luminal Na/H exchanger. Stimulation of this exchanger may also occur due to AII-receptor activation of phospholipase C to release diacyl glycerol, or by local transduction in the brush-border membrane involving phospholipase A2. 4. Inhibition of proximal fluid reabsorption is associated with increased intracellular Ca2+ released from intracellular stores, or entering via voltage-sensitive channels in response to the release of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate, or following Ca2+ channel opening induced by the  metabolite 5,6-epoxy-eicosatrienoic . 5. The stimulatory actions of peritubular AII on proximal transport are inhibited by physiological concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and by parathyroid hormone (PTH). 6. It is concluded that intrarenal AII acts to maintain optimal matching of fluid reabsorption and filtered load in response to changes in sodium balance, as well as to promote acidification of the urine during acidosis and perhaps to potentiate tubular growth following renal injury.</p><p>Keyword: gluconeogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15649984>Inhibition of cellular responses to insulin in a rat liver cell line. A role for PKC in insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>The initial response of liver cells to insulin is mediated through exocytosis of Cl- channel-containing vesicles and a subsequent opening of plasma membrane Cl- channels. Intracellular accumulation of fatty acids leads to profound defects in metabolism, and is closely associated with insulin resistance. It is not known whether the activity of Cl- channels is altered in insulin resistance and by which mechanisms. We studied the effects of fatty  accumulation on Cl- channel opening in a model liver cell line. Overnight treatment with amiodarone increased the fat content by approximately 2-fold, and the rates of  by approximately 5-fold. The ability of insulin to suppress  was markedly reduced indicating that amiodarone treatment induces insulin resistance. Western blot analysis showed that these cells express the same number of insulin receptors as control cells. However, insulin failed to activate exocytosis and Cl- channel opening. These inhibitory effects were mimicked in control cells by exposures to  (15 microm). Further studies demonstrated that fatty acids stimulate the PKC activity, and inhibition of PKC partially restored exocytosis and Cl- channel opening in insulin-resistant cells. Accordingly, activation of PKC with PMA in control cells potently inhibited the insulin responses. These results suggest that stimulation of PKC activity in insulin resistance contributes to the inhibition of cellular responses to insulin in liver cells.</p><p>Keyword: gluconeogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18842827>Linoleic  stimulates  via Ca2+/PLC, cPLA2, and PPAR pathways through GPR40 in primary cultured chicken hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Fatty acids serve vital functions as sources of energy, building materials for cellular structures, and modulators of physiological responses. Therefore, this study examined the effect of linoleic  on glucose production and its related signal pathways in primary cultured chicken hepatocytes. Linoleic  (double-unsaturated, long chain) increased glucose production in a dose (> or =10(-4) M)- and time (> or =8 h)-dependent manner. Both oleic  (monounsaturated, long chain) and palmitic  (saturated, long chain) also increased glucose production, whereas caproic  (saturated, short chain) failed to increase glucose production. Linoleic  increased G protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40; also known as free fatty  receptor-1) protein expression and glucose production that was blocked by GPR40-specific small interfering RNA. Linoleic  increased intracellular calcium concentration, which was blocked by EGTA (extracellular calcium chelator)/BAPTA-AM (intracellular calcium chelator), U-73122 (phospholipase C inhibitor), nifedipine, or methoxyverapamil (L-type calcium channel blockers). Linoleic  increased cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) phosphorylation and the release of [(3)H]-labeled . Moreover, linoleic  increased the level of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein expression, which stimulated the synthesis of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)). The increase in PGE(2) production subsequently stimulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) expression, and MK-886 (PPAR-alpha antagonist) and GW-9662 (PPAR-delta antagonist) inhibited glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. In addition, linoleic -induced glucose production was blocked by inhibition of extracellular and intracellular calcium, cPLA(2), COX-2, or PPAR pathways.

Recent findings indicate that natural history of nonalcoholic fatty liver is regulated, in part, by endogenous cannabinoids. Metformin is an oral hypoglycemic medication which inhibits gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in hepatocytes and limits lipid storage in the liver through the inhibition of free fatty  formation via induction of activated protein kinase activity (AMPK). Both endocannabinoids and metformin may modulate hepatosteatosis; therefore, it was interesting to examine whether metformin may affect lipid accumulation in hepatocytes by acting on cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, in in vitro study. Hep3B cells were incubated with or without metformin (Met), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and oleic  (OA). Cells without any of the examined substances served as negative control. Cells treated only with OA served as positive control. The quantity of intracellular lipids was assessed using Oil-Red-O staining. Selective CB1R agonist, arachidonyl-2-chloromethylamide (ACEA), and CB2R agonist, AM1241 (2-iodo-5-nitrophenyl)-[1-(methylpiperidin-2-ylmethyl)-1 H-indol-3-yl]methanone, were also used to treat Hep3B cells. In some experiments, antagonist for CB1R, AM6545, or SR144528 as selective antagonist of CB2R were used. In the study, Met decreased lipid accumulation in cells treated with OA and inhibited CB1R agonist-induced lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. The CB2R agonist-induced hepatic lipid accumulation was not inhibited by metformin.

The model resulting from the comparison between Group 1 and Group 3 was the most significant. Discriminant metabolites were identified, and the most altered pathways were as follows: pentose phosphate pathway (PPP),  metabolism, , and gluconeogenesis, suggesting the presence of an energetic shift toward the PPP and the presence of oxidative stress in β-thalassemia chorionic villi samples.The metabolomics approach identified a specific metabolic fingerprint in chorionic villi of fetuses affected by β-thalassemia.</p><p>Keyword: gluconeogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616913>Analysis of the Uterine Lumen in Fertility-Classified Heifers: I.

Previously, serial embryo transfer was used to classify heifers as high fertile (HF), subfertile (SF), or infertile (IF). Here, we investigated specific histotroph components (glucose, prostaglandins (PGs) and lipids) in the uterine lumen of day 17 pregnant and open fertility-classified heifers. Concentrations of glucose in the uterine lumen were increased by pregnancy, but did not differ among fertility-classified heifers. Differences in expression of genes encoding glucose transporters and involved with  and gluconeogenesis were observed between conceptuses collected from HF and SF heifers. In the uterine lumen, PGE2 and PGF2α were increased by pregnancy, and HF heifers had higher concentrations of PGE2, PGF2α and 6-keto-PFG1α than SF heifers. Differences were found in expression of genes regulating PG signaling,  metabolism, and PPAR signaling among conceptuses and endometrium from fertility-classified heifers. Lipidomics was conducted exclusively in samples from HF heifers, and phosphatidylcholine was the main lipid class that increased in the uterine lumen by pregnancy. Expression of several lipid metabolism genes differed between HF and SF conceptuses, and a number of fatty acids were differentially abundant in the uterine lumen of pregnant HF and SF heifers. These results support the ideas that uterine luminal histotroph impacts conceptus survival and programs its development and is a facet of dysregulated conceptus-endometrial interactions that result in loss of the conceptus in SF cattle during the implantation period of pregnancy establishment.© The Author(s) 2019.

Wistar rats were treated with CCl4 for 9 weeks. Histopathological changes, hydroxyproline (Hyp) contents, serum ALT and AST in the CCl4-treated group were significantly higher than that of CCl4-untreated group. CCl4-treated and -untreated liver tissues were examined by microarray and iTRAQ. The results showed that 3535 genes (fold change ≥ 1.5, P < 0.05) and 1412 proteins (fold change ≥ 1.2, P < 0.05) were differentially expressed. Moreover, the integrative analysis of transcriptomics and proteomics data showed 523 overlapped proteins, enriched in 182 GO terms including oxidation reduction, response to oxidative stress, inflammatory response, extracellular matrix organization, etc. Furthermore, KEGG pathway analysis showed that 36 pathways including retinol metabolism, PPAR signaling pathway, /gluconeogenesis,  metabolism, metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450 and drug metabolism. Network of protein-protein interaction (PPI) and key function with their related targets were performed and the degree of network was calculated with Cytoscape.

Our study demonstrates that flavonoids are bioactive components of fenugreek with potent antidiabetic activity, which exert their therapeutic effects by multiple mechanisms, including reducing insulin resistance, improving , and protecting islet cells and kidneys from damage.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The potential of SBL as a phospholipid source in gilthead seabream microdiets as compared to ML was evaluated. Two stocking densities were tested in order to exacerbate possible dietary effects: 5 and 20 larvae L(-1). Larvae reflected dietary fatty  profiles: linoleic  was higher, whereas eicosapentaenoic and  acids were lower in SBL fed groups than in ML fed larvae. Highest stocking density decreased survival, and led to elevated saturates and lower docosahexaenoic  levels in polar lipid. Muscle histology observations showed hindered growth potential in SBL fed larvae. Despite similar cortisol levels between treatments, higher glucocorticoid receptor (GR), as well as hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) mRNA levels in SBL fed groups revealed a role for fatty acids in gene regulation. Further analysed genes suggested these effects were independent from the hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal axis control and the endocannabinoid system. Cyclooxygenase-2 and  seemed unaffected. For the first time in fish, a link between dietary lecithin nature and HSL gene transcription, perhaps regulated through GR fatty -induced activation, is suggested. Enhanced lipolytic activity could partly explain lower growth in marine fish larvae when dietary ML is not provided.</p><p>Keyword: gluconeogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28639078>A Genome-wide Expression Association Analysis Identifies Genes and Pathways Associated with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.</a></h2><p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease with strong genetic components. To identity novel risk variants for ALS, utilizing the latest genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and eQTL study data, we conducted a genome-wide expression association analysis by summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) method. Summary data were derived from a large-scale GWAS of ALS, involving 12577 cases and 23475 controls. The eQTL annotation dataset included 923,021 cis-eQTL for 14,329 genes and 4732 trans-eQTL for 2612 genes. Genome-wide single gene expression association analysis was conducted by SMR software. To identify ALS-associated biological pathways, the SMR analysis results were further subjected to gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). SMR single gene analysis identified one significant and four suggestive genes associated with ALS, including C9ORF72 (P value = 7.08 × 10), NT5C3L (P value = 1.33 × 10), GGNBP2 (P value = 1.81 × 10), ZNHIT3(P value = 2.94 × 10), and KIAA1600(P value = 9.97 × 10). GSEA identified 7 significant biological pathways, such as PEROXISOME (empirical P value = 0.006), _GLUCONEOGENESIS (empirical P value = 0.043), and __ METABOLISM (empirical P value = 0.040).

We aim to examine the central effect of n-6 PUFA,  (ARA) on leptin sensitivity and leptin-regulated hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism. We found that intracerebroventricular injection of ARA (25 nmol/day) for 2.5 days reversed the effect of central leptin on hypothalamic JAK2, pSTAT3, pAkt, and pFOXO1 protein levels, which was concomitant with a pro-inflammatory response in the hypothalamus. ARA also attenuated the effect of central leptin on hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism by reversing the mRNA expression of the genes involved in  (G6Pase, PEPCK), glucose transportation (GLUT2), lipogenesis (FAS, SCD1), and cholesterol synthesis (HMG-CoA reductase). These results indicate that an increased exposure to central n-6 PUFA induces central cellular leptin resistance with concomitant defective JAK2-STAT3 and PI3K-Akt signaling.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Ra and Rd (mg X kg-1 X min-1) were calculated by isotope dilution using [3-3H]glucose. Animals were treated with either oral Indo or acetylsalicylic  for 1 day before the respective studies. On the study day, experimental animals were given a continuous infusion of either saline (control), Indo (5 mg/kg bolus followed by 0.05 mg X kg-1 X min-1), or sodium salicylate (0.45 mg X kg-1 X min-1) for 330 min on separate days; each animal participated in all three protocols. After establishing steady-state specific activity, control (C) and experimental animals (n = 6/group) received insulin, 0.275 mU X kg-1 X min-1 for 150 min, raising serum insulin levels two- to threefold above basal. During insulin infusion in C, plasma glucose (G) fell from 99 +/- 2 to 82 +/- 6 ml/dl (P less than 0.01), associated with a transient fall in Ra from 2.5 +/- 0.3 to 1.9 +/- 0.2 (P less than 0.01) at 30 min, returning to base line at 45 min; Rd did not change. In the Indo and S groups, G also fell by a similar extent. In contrast to C, however, the fall in G was associated with a rise in Rd, commencing at 30 min in the Indo group (P less than 0.05) and at 45 min in the S group (P less than 0.01); Ra did not fall and actually rose above basal (P less than 0.05), although it did not match the rise in Rd.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><p>Keyword: gluconeogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9491639>[Molecular endocrinology of hereditary obesity].</a></h2><p>The hypothalamic disorders of obesity include hyperphagia, a low central orthosympathetic tone (with reduced thermogenesis), vagal hyperinsulinism, low serotonin efficacy, a hyperactive hypothalamo-hypophyseal-adrenal axis, a hypoactive GHRH-GH-IGF axis and hypogonadism of central origin.

Seventeen metabolically healthy patients, suffering from mechanical ileus, have been evaluated. Besides the nonspecific metabolic changes characteristic of the postaggressive metabolism (abnormalities in peripheral glucose utilization, , lipolysis, proteolysis) we were able to demonstrate elevated serum levels of albumin, lactate and  preoperatively in these patients. The plasma histamine levels lay within normal limits. In the immediate postoperative phase (i.e. from 1.-3. postoperative day) we found a marked reduction in the serum levels of glucoplastic amino acids (about 30%), albumin (40%), pre-albumin (80%) and cholesterol (50%). We therefore suggest that, apart from electrolyte solutions, patients with an ileus should receive fructose (1600 kcal/day) preoperatively and from the first postoperative day amino acids (1 g/kg of body weight) and human albumin (as required) should be administered in addition.</p><p>Keyword: gluconeogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826550>Dietary  decreases the expression of transcripts related to adipocyte development and chronic inflammation in the adipose tissue of juvenile grass carp, Ctenopharyngodon idella.</a></h2><p>Overdevelopment of adipose tissue in cultured fish is one of the biggest issues plaguing current aquaculture industry, leading to unhealthy status of fishes and production losses. Diet supplemented with 0.30%  (ARA) has been found to reduce adipogenesis and inflammation in grass carp, but the potential mechanism is not comprehensively understood. To fully reveal the effects of dietary ARA on the mRNA profiles of adipose tissue, transcriptome techniques were applied in this study. A 10-weeks feeding experiment was performed using two isonitrogenous and isoenergetic purified diets, namely ARA-free (control) and 0.30% ARA (ARA group). Results showed increased ARA content and decreased intraperitoneal fat index and adipocyte size in the adipose tissue of fish fed ARA (P < 0.05). A total of 611 and 973 genes of the adipose tissue were significantly up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, in fish fed ARA (P < 0.05). Dietary ARA upregulated LOX pathway but downregulated CYP450 pathway annotated genes expression. A total of 65 cell development annotated genes including 30 adipocyte proliferation, 21 adipocyte differentiation, and 14 cell apoptosis annotated genes were down-regulated in the ARA group. In addition, 19 lipid catabolism annotated genes were increased. The mRNA expression levels of 5 chemokines, 10 cytokines, 26 cytokine and chemokine receptors, 15 cell adhesion, 6 oxidative stress, and 6 angiogenesis annotated genes were all down-regulated in fish fed ARA. Finally, dietary ARA also decreased the expression of transcripts annotated with glucose transportation,  and gluconeogenesis. Overall, our results demonstrate that dietary ARA has a fat reducing role, and tends to retard adipocyte development and attenuate chronic inflammation based on these adipose transcript expression results in grass carp.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The role of  (AA) and its downstream enzymatic cascades, such as cyclooxygenase, in adipogenesis is well established. The exact contribution of the P450 epoxygenase pathway, however, remains to be established. Enzymes belonging to this pathway are mainly encoded by the CYP2J locus which shows extensive allelic expansion in mice. Here we aimed to establish the role of endogenous epoxygenase during adipogenesis under homeostatic and metabolic stress conditions.We took advantage of the simpler genetic architecture of the Cyp2j locus in the rat and used a Cyp2j4 (orthologue of human CYP2J2) knockout rat in two models of metabolic dysfunction: physiological aging and cafeteria diet (CAF). The phenotyping of Cyp2j4 rats under CAF was integrated with proteomics (LC-MS/MS) and lipidomics (LC-MS) analyses in the liver and the adipose tissue.We report that Cyp2j4 deletion causes adipocyte dysfunction under metabolic challenges. This is characterized by (i) down-regulation of white adipose tissue (WAT) PPARγ and C/EBPα, (ii) adipocyte hypertrophy, (iii) extracellular matrix remodeling, and (iv) alternative usage of AA pathway. Specifically, in Cyp2j4 rats treated with a cafeteria diet, the dysfunctional adipogenesis is accompanied by exacerbated weight gain, hepatic lipid accumulation, and dysregulated .These results suggest that AA epoxygenases are essential regulators of healthy adipogenesis. Our results uncover their synergistic role in fine-tuning AA pathway in obesity-mediated hepatic steatosis.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..
