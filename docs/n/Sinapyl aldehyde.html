Previously studies have proved that dominating alkaloids in P. harmala show significant inhibitory activities on the cholinesterase.The aim of the present study is to isolate trace ingredients from seeds of P. harmala and evaluate its inhibitory activities on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE).For sake of screening effective cholinesterase inhibitors, trace compounds were isolated from seeds of P. harmala through a bioassay-guided fractionation and their structures were determined via detailed spectral analysis. The inhibitory activities on AChE and BChE were assessed using an improved Ellman method by UPLC-ESI-MS/MS to determine the common final product choline.The activity-guided fractionation led to the isolation of two new alkaloids 2--tetrahydroharmine (10), 2-carboxyl-3,4-dihydroquinazoline (19), one syringin structure analog 1-O-β-D-xylopyranose  alcohol (22), and along with 19 known compounds. Compounds acetylnorharmine (6), harmic acid methy ester (7), harmine N-oxide (13), 6-methoxyindoline (14), syringin (21) were first found from genus Peganum and compounds 3-hydroxylated harmine (4), 1-hydroxy-7-methoxy-β-carboline (5) were new natural products. The results showed that the 2--tetrahydroharmine (10) has a potential inbibitive effect on both AChE and BChE with IC50 values of 12.35 ± 0.24 and 5.51 ± 0.33 µM, respectively. Deoxyvasicine (15) and vasicine (16) showed the strongest BChE inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 0.04 ± 0.01 and 0.1 ± 0.01 µM. The analysis of the structure-activity relationship indicated that the saturation of pyridine ring and the presence of substitution at indole ring, C-1, C-3, C-7 and N-2, for β-carbolines, were essential for effective inhibition of both AChE and BChE and the five-membered ring between C-2 and N-3 as well as the substituent groups sited at C-4 and C-9, for quinazolines, were important to both the AChE/BChE-inhibitory activity.Bioassay-guided fractionation has led to the isolation of AChE and BChE inhibitors from the seeds of P. harmala. These results are in agreement with the traditional uses of the seeds of P. harmala.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Degradation and polymerization of monolignols were simultaneously induced by A. biennis. Whole cells of A. biennis degraded coniferyl alcohol to vanillin and coniferyl , and degraded  alcohol to 2,6-dimethoxybenzene- 1,4-diol, with the production of dimers. The molecular weight of monolignols treated with A. biennis increased drastically. The activities of lignin degrading enzymes were monitored for 24 h to determine whether there was any correlation between monolignol biomodification and ligninolytic enzymes. We concluded that complex enzyme systems were involved in the degradation and polymerization of monolignols. To degrade monolignols, ascorbic acid was added to the culture medium as a reducing agent. In the presence of ascorbic acid, the molecular weight was less increased in the case of coniferyl alcohol, while that of  alcohol was similar to that of the control. Furthermore, the addition of ascorbic acid led to the production of various degraded compounds: syringaldehyde and acid compounds. Accordingly, these results demonstrated that ascorbic acid prevented the rapid polymerization of monolignols, thus stabilizing radicals generated by enzymes of A. biennis. Thereafter, A. biennis catalyzed the oxidation of stable monolignols. As a result, ascorbic acid facilitated predominantly monolignols degradation by A. biennis through the stabilization of radicals. These findings showed outstanding ability of A. biennis to modify the lignin compounds rapidly and usefully.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30638509>Laccase activity measurement by FTIR spectral fingerprinting.</a></h2><p>Laccases (EC 1.10.3.2) are enzymes known for their ability to catalyze the oxidation of phenolic compounds using molecular oxygen as the final electron acceptor. Laccase activity is commonly determined by monitoring spectrophotometric changes (absorbance) of the product or substrate during the enzymatic reaction. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) is a fast and versatile technique where spectral evolution profiling, i.e. assessment of the spectral changes of both substrate and products during enzymatic conversion in real time, can be used to assess enzymatic activity when combined with multivariate data analysis. We employed FTIR to monitor enzymatic oxidation of monolignols (, coniferyl and p-coumaryl alcohol), sinapic acid, and sinapic  by four different laccases: three fungal laccases from Trametes versicolor, Trametes villosa and Ganoderma lucidum, respectively, and one bacterial laccase from Meiothermus ruber. By coupling the FTIR measurements with Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) we established a quantitative assay for assessing laccase activity. By combining PARAFAC modelling with Principal Component Analysis we show the usefulness of this technology as a multivariate tool able to compare and distinguish different laccase reaction patterns. We also demonstrate how the FTIR approach can be used to create a reference system for laccase activity comparison based on a relatively low number of measurements. Such a reference system has potential to function as a high-throughput method for comparing reaction pattern similarities and differences between laccases and hereby identify new and interesting enzyme candidates in large sampling pools.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
