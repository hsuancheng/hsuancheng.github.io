In the last decades, there have been great advances in the understanding of BA physiology, and new insights have emerged regarding the role of BAs in determining cell damage and death in several liver diseases. This new knowledge has helped to better delineate the pathophysiology of cholestasis and the adaptive responses of hepatocytes to cholestatic liver injury as well as of the mechanisms of injury of biliary epithelia. In this context, therapeutic approaches for liver diseases using hydrophilic BA (i.e., ursodeoxycholic acid, tauroursodeoxycholic, and, more recently, norursodeoxycholic acid), have been revamped. In the present review, we summarize current experimental and clinical data regarding these BAs and its role in the treatment of certain liver diseases.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29475944>Hepatic loss of  () induces fatty liver and accelerates liver tumorigenesis in mice.</a></h2><p>The liver is a major organ in lipid metabolism, and its malfunction leads to various diseases. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, the most common chronic liver disorder in developed countries, is characterized by the abnormal retention of excess lipid within hepatocytes and predisposes individuals to liver cancer. We previously reported that the levels of Lissencephaly 1 (LIS1, also known as PAFAH1B1) are down-regulated in human hepatocellular carcinoma. Following up on this observation, we found that genetic deletion of  in the mouse liver increases lipid accumulation and  in this organ. Further analysis revealed that loss of  triggers endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and reduces triglyceride secretion. Attenuation of ER stress by addition of  (TUDCA) diminished lipid accumulation in the -deficient hepatocytes. Moreover, the Golgi stacks were disorganized in -deficient liver cells. Of note, the  liver-knockout mice exhibited increased hepatocyte ploidy and accelerated development of liver cancer after exposure to the liver carcinogen diethylnitrosamine (DEN). Taken together, these findings suggest that reduced  levels can spur the development of liver diseases from steatosis to liver cancer and provide a useful model for delineating the molecular pathways that lead to these diseases.© 2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30765332>The Food Additive Maltodextrin Promotes Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Driven Mucus Depletion and Exacerbates Intestinal Inflammation.</a></h2><p>Food additives, such as emulsifiers, stabilizers, or bulking agents, are present in the Western diet and their consumption is increasing. However, little is known about their potential effects on intestinal homeostasis. In this study we examined the effect of some of these food additives on gut inflammation.Mice were given drinking water containing maltodextrin (MDX), propylene glycol, or animal gelatin, and then challenged with dextran sulfate sodium or indomethacin. In parallel, mice fed a MDX-enriched diet were given the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inhibitor  (TUDCA). Transcriptomic analysis, real-time polymerase chain reaction, mucin-2 expression, phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase quantification, and H&E staining was performed on colonic tissues. Mucosa-associated microbiota composition was characterized by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. For the in vitro experiments, murine intestinal crypts and the human mucus-secreting HT29-methotrexate treated cell line were stimulated with MDX in the presence or absence of TUDCA or a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor.Diets enriched in MDX, but not propylene glycol or animal gelatin, exacerbated intestinal inflammation in both models. Analysis of the mechanisms underlying the detrimental effect of MDX showed up-regulation of inositol requiring protein 1β, a sensor of ER stress, in goblet cells, and a reduction of mucin-2 expression with no significant change in mucosa-associated microbiota. Stimulation of murine intestinal crypts and HT29-methotrexate treated cell line cells with MDX induced inositol requiring protein 1β via a p38 MAP kinase-dependent mechanism. Treatment of mice with TUDCA prevented mucin-2 depletion and attenuated colitis in MDX-fed mice.MDX increases ER stress in gut epithelial cells with the downstream effect of reducing mucus production and enhancing colitis susceptibility.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Abnormal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress participates in many heart diseases, but its role in viral myocarditis remains unsolved.We investigated the influence of ER stress in coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced viral myocarditis by dynamically detecting its activation in CVB3-infected hearts, analyzing its association with myocarditis severity, and exploring its impact on disease development by modulating the strength of ER stress with the chemical activator tunicamycin (Tm) or the inhibitor  (TUDCA). The underlying signal pathway of ER stress in CVB3-induced myocarditis was also deciphered.We found that myocardial expression of Grp78 and Grp94, 2 ER stress markers, was significantly increased after CVB3 infection and positively correlated with myocarditis severity. Consistently, Tm-augmented ER stress obviously aggravated myocarditis, as shown by more severe myocardial , reduced cardiac function, and a lower survival rate, whereas TUDCA decreased ER stress and obviously alleviated myocarditis. This pathologic effect of ER stress could be attributed to increased levels of proinflammatory cytokine (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) production through the IRE1-associated nuclear factor-κB (NF-kB) pathway.ER stress accentuated CVB3-induced myocardial  through the IRE1-associated NF-κB pathway.

Whether CBAs exert their beneficial effects on allergic airway responses via 1 arm or several arms of the UPR, or alternatively through the signaling pathways for conserved bile acid receptor, remains largely unknown. We used a house dust mite-induced (HDM-induced) murine model of asthma to evaluate and compare the effects of 5 CBAs and 1 unconjugated bile acid in attenuating allergen-induced UPR and airway responses. Expression of UPR-associated transcripts was assessed in airway brushings from human patients with asthma and healthy subjects. Here we show that CBAs, such as alanyl β-muricholic acid (AβM) and TUDCA, significantly decreased inflammatory, immune, and cytokine responses; mucus metaplasia; and airway hyperresponsiveness, as compared with other CBAs in a model of allergic airway disease. CBAs predominantly bind to activating transcription factor 6α (ATF6α) compared with the other canonical transducers of the UPR, subsequently decreasing allergen-induced UPR activation and resolving allergic airway disease, without significant activation of the bile acid receptors. TUDCA and AβM also attenuated other HDM-induced ER stress markers in the lungs of allergic mice. Quantitative mRNA analysis of airway epithelial brushings from human subjects demonstrated that several ATF6α-related transcripts were significantly upregulated in patients with asthma compared with healthy subjects. Collectively, these results demonstrate that CBA-based therapy potently inhibits the allergen-induced UPR and allergic airway disease in mice via preferential binding of the canonical transducer of the UPR, ATF6α. These results potentially suggest a novel avenue to treat allergic asthma using select CBAs.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27007849>NOD1 and NOD2 signalling links ER stress with .</a></h2><p>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a major contributor to inflammatory diseases, such as Crohn disease and type 2 diabetes.

The ER stress inducers thapsigargin and dithiothreitol trigger production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in a NOD1/2-dependent fashion.  and IL-6 production triggered by infection with Brucella abortus, which induces ER stress by injecting the type IV secretion system effector protein VceC into host cells, is TRAF2, NOD1/2 and RIP2-dependent and can be reduced by treatment with the ER stress inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholate or an IRE1α kinase inhibitor.

The aim of the present study was to determine the role of the serum BA spectrum in the diagnosis and progression of liver cirrhosis. This was a prospective observational study involving patients with chronic hepatitis (n=23), liver cirrhosis (n=101), and cirrhosis complicated with hepatocellular carcinoma (CC-HCC; n=56). The 6-month survival of cirrhotic patients was recorded after blood collection. Comparisons of serum total BAs and individual BAs between different groups were performed using the Mann-Whitney U or Kruskal-Wallis tests. Correlation analysis was conducted by Spearman's correlation. Diagnosis and prediction analyses were performed using receiver operating characteristic curves. Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariable Cox regression analysis. The concentrations of total BAs, glycocholic acid (GCA), glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA), taurocholic acid (TCA), taurochenoxycholic acid and  (TUDCA) were increased significantly in patients with early cirrhosis compared to patients with chronic hepatitis (P<0.05) and were associated with the diagnosis of cirrhosis (P=0.049, 0.004, 0.002, 0.003, 0.010 and 0.009, respectively). The levels of total BAs, primary conjugated BAs, and TUDCA increased as liver cirrhosis progressed (P<0.05). Serum total BAs, GCA, GCDCA, and TCA predicted the 6-month survival of patients with liver cirrhosis (P=0.0003, 0.005, 0.002, and 0.010 respectively). Based on multivariate Cox regression analysis, the level of total BAs was an independent predictor of mortality in cirrhotic patients (hazard ratios, 4.046; 95% CI, 1.620-10.108; P=0.003). In the early-stage cirrhosis group, the concentrations of total BAs and primary conjugated BAs were significantly elevated in patients with CC-HCC compared with patients with cirrhosis alone. In conclusion, total and individual BAs, especially primary conjugated BAs, are effective non-invasive markers in the diagnosis and prognosis of liver cirrhosis, and may be potential indicators in the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with early cirrhosis.Copyright: © Liu et al.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26581663>Undernourishment in utero Primes Hepatic Steatosis in Adult Mice Offspring on an Obesogenic Diet; Involvement of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress.</a></h2><p>In order to investigate the possible involvement of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the developmental origins of hepatic steatosis associated with undernourishment in utero, we herein employed a fetal undernourishment mouse model by maternal caloric restriction in three cohorts; cohort 1) assessment of hepatic steatosis and the ER stress response at 9 weeks of age (wks) before a high fat diet (HFD), cohort 2) assessment of hepatic steatosis and the ER stress response on a HFD at 17 wks, cohort 3) assessment of hepatic steatosis and the ER stress response at 22 wks on a HFD after the alleviation of ER stress with a chemical chaperone,  (TUDCA), from 17 wks to 22 wks. Undernourishment in utero significantly deteriorated hepatic steatosis and led to the significant integration of the ER stress response on a HFD at 17 wks. The alleviation of ER stress by the TUDCA treatment significantly improved the parameters of hepatic steatosis in pups with undernourishment in utero, but not in those with normal nourishment in utero at 22 wks.

The mechanism for the onset of depression remains largely unknown. Recently, more and more attention is being given to the role of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in depression.  (TUDCA), a clinically available agent used to treat cholesterol gallstone and protect neurons against neurodegeneration, has been reported to prevent neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. In this study, we investigated the effect of TUDCA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depression-like behavior, neuroinflammation, and oxido-nitrosative stress in mice. Results showed that TUDCA pretreatment (once daily for 7 consecutive days) at the dosage of 200 and 400 mg/kg, but not 100 mg/kg, markedly attenuated LPS (0.83 mg/kg)-induced behavioral abnormalities in the tail suspension test, forced swim test, and sucrose preference test. Further analysis showed that the TUDCA pretreatment (200, 400 mg/kg) not only inhibited the production of proinflammatory cytokines induced by LPS stimulation, such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, but attenuated LPS-triggered oxido-nitrosative stress in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Taken together, our results provide evidence to show that the TUDCA could be a potential antidepressant, and its antidepressive mechanism may be associated with the inhibition of the neuroinflammatory response and oxido-nitrosative stress in the brain.© 2018 S.

To study the effects of TUDCA on brain injury, we subjected mice to TBI with a controlled cortical impact (CCI) device. Using western blotting, we first examined TBI-induced changes in the expression levels of GRP78, an ER stress marker, p-PERK, PERK, p-eIF2a, eIF2a, ATF4, p-Akt, Akt, Pten, Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-12 and CHOP, as well as changes in the mRNA levels of Akt, GRP78, Caspase-12 and CHOP using RT-PCR. Neuronal cell death was assessed by a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay, and CHOP expression in neuronal cells was detected by double-immunofluorescence staining. Neurological and motor deficits were assessed by modified neurological severity scores (mNSS) and beam balance and beam walking tests, and brain water content was also assessed. Our results indicated that ER stress peaked at 72 h after TBI and that TUDCA abolished ER stress and inhibited p-PERK, p-eIF2a, ATF4, Pten, Caspase-12 and CHOP expression levels.

The interplay between hyperglycemia and endothelial activation in inducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways and visual deficits in DR is not fully understood. To address this, we used a mouse model of chronic vascular activation using endothelial-specific tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-expressing (tie2-TNF) mice to induce  with streptozotocin. At 4 weeks post streptozotocin, a significant 2-fold to 10-fold increase in retinal neurovascular inflammatory gene transcript response in tie2-TNF mice was further increased in diabetic tie2-TNF mice. A decrease in visual acuity and scotopic b-wave amplitude in tie2-TNF mice was further accentuated in diabetic tie2-TNF mice and these changes correlated with a multi-fold increase in retinal ER stress markers and a reduction in adherens junctions. Cultured retinal endothelial cells showed a significant decrease in trans-endothelial resistance as well as VE-cadherin expression under TNF-α and high glucose stress. These changes were partly rescued by , a potent ER stress inhibitor. Taken together, constant endothelial activation induced by TNF-α further exacerbated by hyperglycemia results in activation of ER stress and chronic proinflammation in a feed forward loop ultimately resulting in endothelial junction protein alterations leading to visual deficits in the retina.

To determine the role of ER stress in AKI-CKD transition, we tested the effects of two chemical chaperones:  (TUDCA) and 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA).uIR led to the induction of ER stress in kidneys, as indicated by increased expression of UPR molecules CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein) and BiP(binding immunoglobulin protein; also called GRP78-78 kDa glucose-regulated protein). Given at 3 days after uIR, both TUDCA and 4-PBA blocked ER stress in post-ischemic kidneys.

(TUDCA) is neuroprotective in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD; however, its effect in PD motor symptoms has never been addressed. In the present work, an extensive behavior analysis was performed to better characterize the MPTP model of PD and to evaluate the effects of TUDCA in the prevention/improvement of mice phenotype. MPTP induced significant alterations in general motor performance paradigms, including increased latency in the motor swimming, adhesive removal and pole tests, as well as altered gait, foot dragging, and tremors. TUDCA administration, either before or after MPTP, significantly reduced the swimming latency, improved gait quality, and decreased foot dragging. Importantly, TUDCA was also effective in the prevention of typical parkinsonian symptoms such as spontaneous activity, ability to initiate movement and tremors. Accordingly, TUDCA prevented MPTP-induced decrease of dopaminergic fibers and ATP levels, mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation. Overall, MPTP-injected mice presented motor symptoms that are aggravated throughout time, resembling human parkinsonism, whereas PD motor symptoms were absent or mild in TUDCA-treated animals, and no aggravation was observed in any parameter.

However, the role of ER stress in tumor initiation and progression is controversial. To determine the impact of ER stress, we applied  (TUDCA), a bile acid with chaperone properties. The effects of TUDCA were assessed using a diethylnitrosamine-induced mouse HCC model in preventive and therapeutic settings. Cell metabolic activity, proliferation and invasion were investigated in vitro. Tumor progression was assessed in the HepG2 xenograft model. Administration of TUDCA in the preventive setting reduced carcinogen-induced elevation of alanine and aspartate aminotransferase levels, apoptosis of hepatocytes and tumor burden. TUDCA also reduced eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIf2α) phosphorylation, C/EBP homologous protein expression and caspase-12 processing. Thus, TUDCA suppresses carcinogen-induced pro-apoptotic UPR. TUDCA alleviated hepatic  by increasing NF-κB inhibitor IκBα. Furthermore, TUDCA altered the invasive phenotype and enhanced metabolic activity but not proliferation in HCC cells.

Currently, other than supportive care and antibiotics, there are no treatments for this condition. We developed an in vitro assay to understand the role of the ER-stress-mediated apoptosis process in lymphocyte death during polymicrobial sepsis, which was reproducible in in vivo mouse models. Modulating ER stress using chemical chaperones significantly reduced the induction of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim both in vitro and in mice. Furthermore, in a 'two-hit' pneumonia model in mice, we have been able to demonstrate that administration of the chemical chaperone TUDCA helped to maintain lymphocyte homeostasis by significantly reducing lymphocyte apoptosis and this correlated with four-fold improvement in survival.

In transplantation process, warm ischemia (WI) in the donor, cold ischemia and reperfusion injury in the recipient altogether inducing ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is strongly associated with ITBL. This is a cascading injury process, involving in a complex series of inter-connecting events causing variety of cells activation and damage associated with the massive release of inflammatory cytokines and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These damaged cells such as sinusoidal endothelial cells (SECs), Kupffer cells (KCs), hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells (BECs), coupled with immunological injury and bile salt toxicity altogether contribute to ITBL in NHBD LT. Developed therapeutic strategies to attenuate IRI are essential to improve outcome after LT. Among them, single pharmaceutical interventions blocking a specific pathway of IRI in rodent models play an absolutely dominant role, and show a beneficial effect in some given controlled experiments. But this will likely prove ineffective in complex clinical setting in which more risk parameters are involved. Therefore, we intend to design a multidrug cocktail approach to block different pathways on more than one stage (WI, cold ischemia and reperfusion) of the process of IRI-induced ITBL simultaneously. This multidrug cocktail will include six drugs containing streptokinase, epoprostenol, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), hemin and  (TUDC). These drugs show protective effects by targeting the different key events of IRI, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrosis, anti-oxidation, anti-apoptosis and reduced bile salt toxicity. Ideally, the compounds, dosage, and method of application of drugs included in cocktail should not be definitive. We can consider removing or adding some drugs to the proposed cocktail based on further research. But given the multitude of different combinations, it is extremely difficult to determent which combination is the optimization design. Nevertheless, regardless of the difficulty, our multidrug cocktail approach designed to block different mechanisms on more than one stage of IRI simultaneously may represent a future preventive and therapeutic avenue for ITBL.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Compared with the BLM+Saline mice, the mice with BLM+HSV1 showed significantly higher acute lung injury (ALI) score (P < 0.0001), lower survival rate (100% vs 21.4%, P < 0.0001), poorer lung function and higher inflammatory response representing by increased total inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (P = 0.0323), increased proportion of Th17 cells in peripheral blood (P = 0.0004) and higher inflammatory factors in BALF. In addition, HSV1 infection increased the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-related proteins in mice with BLM-induced fibrosis. The inhibition of ERS by  (TUDCA, an ERS inhibitor) significantly reduced the IL-17A levels in BALF (P = 0.0140) and TH17 cells in the peripheral blood (P = 0.0084) of mice with BLM+HSV1, suggesting that suppression of ERS may reduce TH17 response in mice with AE-IPF.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of ilexgenin A on endothelial homeostasis and its mechanisms. Palmitate (PA) stimulation induced endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and subsequent thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP)/NLRP3 inflammasome activation in endothelial cells, leading to endothelial dysfunction. Ilexgenin A enhanced LKB1-dependent AMPK activity and improved ER stress by suppression of ROS-associated TXNIP induction. However, these effects were blocked by knockdown of AMPKα, indicating AMPK is essential for its action in suppression of ER stress. Meanwhile, ilexgenin A inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation by down-regulation of NLRP3 and cleaved caspase-1 induction, and thereby reduced IL-1β secretion. It also inhibited  and apoptosis exposed to PA insult. Consistent with these results in endothelial cells, ilexgenin A attenuated ER stress and restored the loss of eNOS activity in vascular endothelium, and thereby improved endothelium-dependent vasodilation in rat aorta. A further analysis in high-fat fed mice showed that oral administration of ilexgenin A blocked ER stress/NLRP3 activation with reduced ROS generation and increased NO production in vascular endothelium, well confirming the beneficial effect of ilexgenin A on endothelial homeostasis in vivo. Taken together, these results show ER stress-associated TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome activation was responsible for endothelial dysfunction and ilexgenin A ameliorated endothelial dysfunction by suppressing ER-stress and TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome activation with a regulation of AMPK. This finding suggests that the application of ilexgenin A is useful in the management of cardiovascular diseases in obesity.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, relationships between these processes are unclear. We hypothesized that Nox isoforms localize in a subcellular compartment-specific manner, contributing to oxidative and ER stress, which influence the oxidative proteome and vascular function in hypertension. Nox compartmentalization (cell fractionation), O (lucigenin), HO (amplex red), reversible protein oxidation (sulfenylation), irreversible protein oxidation (protein tyrosine phosphatase, peroxiredoxin oxidation), and ER stress (PERK [protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase], IRE1α [inositol-requiring enzyme 1], and phosphorylation/oxidation) were studied in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). VSMC proliferation was measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and vascular reactivity assessed in stroke-prone SHR arteries by myography. Noxs were downregulated by short interfering RNA and pharmacologically. In SHR, Noxs were localized in specific subcellular regions: Nox1 in plasma membrane and Nox4 in ER. In SHR, oxidative stress was associated with increased protein sulfenylation and hyperoxidation of protein tyrosine phosphatases and peroxiredoxins. Inhibition of Nox1 (NoxA1ds), Nox1/4 (GKT137831), and ER stress (4-phenylbutyric acid/) normalized SHR vascular reactive oxygen species generation. GKT137831 reduced IRE1α sulfenylation and XBP1 (X-box binding protein 1) splicing in SHR. Increased VSMC proliferation in SHR was normalized by GKT137831, 4-phenylbutyric acid, and STF083010 (IRE1-XBP1 disruptor). Hypercontractility in the stroke-prone SHR was attenuated by 4-phenylbutyric acid. We demonstrate that protein hyperoxidation in hypertension is associated with oxidative and ER stress through upregulation of plasmalemmal-Nox1 and ER-Nox4. The IRE1-XBP1 pathway of the ER stress response is regulated by Nox4/reactive oxygen species and plays a role in the hyperproliferative VSMC phenotype in SHR. Our study highlights the importance of Nox subcellular compartmentalization and interplay between cytoplasmic reactive oxygen species and ER stress response, which contribute to the VSMC oxidative proteome and vascular dysfunction in hypertension.© 2018 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28029143>Troxerutin Attenuates Enhancement of Hepatic Gluconeogenesis by Inhibiting NOD Activation-Mediated Inflammation in High-Fat Diet-Treated Mice.</a></h2><p>Recent evidence suggests that troxerutin, a trihydroxyethylated derivative of natural bioflavonoid rutin, exhibits beneficial effects on diabetes-related symptoms. Here we investigated the effects of troxerutin on the enhancement of hepatic gluconeogenesis in high-fat diet (HFD)-treated mice and the mechanisms underlying these effects. Mice were divided into four groups: Control group, HFD group, HFD + Troxerutin group, and Troxerutin group. Troxerutin was treated by daily oral administration at doses of 150 mg/kg/day for 20 weeks.  (TUDCA) was used to inhibit endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress). Our results showed that troxerutin effectively improved obesity and related metabolic parameters, and liver injuries in HFD-treated mouse. Furthermore, troxerutin significantly attenuated enhancement of hepatic gluconeogenesis in HFD-fed mouse. Moreover, troxerutin notably suppressed nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 transcriptional activation and release of inflammatory cytokines in HFD-treated mouse livers. Mechanismly, troxerutin dramatically decreased Nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD) expression, as well as interaction between NOD1/2 with interacting protein-2 (RIP2), by abating oxidative stress-induced ER stress in HFD-treated mouse livers, which was confirmed by TUDCA treatment. These improvement effects of troxerutin on hepatic glucose disorders might be mediated by its anti-obesity effect. In conclusion, troxerutin markedly diminished HFD-induced enhancement of hepatic gluconeogenesis via its inhibitory effects on ER stress-mediated NOD activation and consequent inflammation, which might be mediated by its anti-obesity effect.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26902174>Endoplasmic reticulum stress regulates inflammation and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle from pregnant women.</a></h2><p>Sterile inflammation and infection are key mediators of inflammation and peripheral insulin resistance associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).

ER stress proteins IRE1α, GRP78 and XBP-1s were upregulated in skeletal muscle of obese pregnant women, whereas IRE1α was increased in GDM women. Suppression of ER stress, using ER stress inhibitor  (TUDCA) or siRNA knockdown of IRE1α and GRP78, significantly downregulated LPS-, poly(I:C)- or IL-1β-induced production of IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β and MCP-1.

Specifically, we surveyed preclinical studies describing the neuroprotective and systemic effects of TUDCA, and the potential therapeutic application of TUDCA. Preclinical studies have provided promising data supporting its use in neurological disease characterized by apoptosis-induced neuronal loss. TUDCA inhibits multiple proteins involved in apoptosis and upregulates cell survival pathways.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a local factor that affects various cellular events during a broad spectrum of physiological and pathological conditions.

In the present study, we showed that ER stress was activated in granulosa cells of PCOS patients as well as in a well-established PCOS mouse model. Pharmacological inducers of ER stress, tunicamycin and thapsigargin, were found to increase the expression of pro-fibrotic growth factors, including transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, in human granulosa cells, and their expression also increased in granulosa cells of PCOS patients. By contrast, treatment of PCOS mice with an ER stress inhibitor,  or BGP-15, decreased interstitial fibrosis and collagen deposition in ovaries, accompanied by a reduction in TGF-β1 expression in granulosa cells.

Male Balb/c mice were intraperitoneally injected with  (400 mg/kg) or saline solution, once per day for 3 days before surgery, and then the model of hepatic I/R injury was established. Blood and liver samples were collected from each group at 3, 6, and 24 h after surgery. Liver pathological changes, liver function, hepatocyte apoptosis and proinflammatory factors were detected. KCs were extracted, cultured and treated with TUDCA or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 24 h, and then viability and phagocytosis were examined. Additionally, IRE1α/TRAF2/NF-κB pathway activity and AML cell apoptosis were detected. The results showed that TUDCA alleviated hepatic I/R injury, the level of liver function markers, and hepatocyte apoptosis in vivo. Furthermore, the proinflammatory effects of KCs were suppressed by down-regulating IRE1α/TRAF2/NF-κB pathway activity in vivo. TUDCA dose-dependently suppressed the expression of inflammatory factors and IRE1α/TRAF2/NF-κB pathway activity in vitro, consistent with the in vivo results.

Recently, serum levels of the α cytoplasmic isoform of heat-shock protein 90 (hsp90) were shown to be elevated in individuals with new-onset T1D. We therefore hypothesized that hsp90α could be released from beta cells in response to cellular stress and  associated with the earliest stages of T1D. Here, human beta cell lines and cadaveric islets released hsp90α in response to stress induced by treatment with a combination of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1β, tumour necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ. Mechanistically, hsp90α release was found to be driven by cytokine-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress mediated by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), a pathway that can eventually lead to beta cell apoptosis. Cytokine-induced beta cell hsp90α release and JNK activation were significantly reduced by pre-treating cells with the endoplasmic reticulum stress-mitigating chemical chaperone .

The bile acid conjugate  (TUDCA) is neuroprotective in different animal models of stroke and neurological diseases. We have previously shown that TUDCA has anti-inflammatory effects on glial cell cultures and in a mouse model of acute neuroinflammation. We show now that microglial cells (central nervous system resident macrophages) express the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) in vivo and in vitro. TUDCA binding to GPBAR1/TGR5 caused an increase in intracellular cAMP levels in microglia that induced anti-inflammatory markers, while reducing pro-inflammatory ones. This anti-inflammatory effect of TUDCA was inhibited by small interference RNA for GPBAR1/TGR5 receptor, as well as by treatment with a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor.

We have previously shown the anti-inflammatory properties of TUDCA in an animal model of acute neuroinflammation. Here, we present a new anti-inflammatory mechanism of TUDCA through the regulation of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) pathway. The bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was injected intravenously (iv) on TGFβ reporter mice (Smad-binding element (SBE)/Tk-Luc) to study in their brains the real-time activation profile of the TGFβ pathway in a non-invasive way. The activation of the TGFβ pathway in the brain of SBE/Tk-Luc mice increased 24 h after LPS injection, compared to control animals. This activation peak increased further in mice treated with both LPS and TUDCA than in mice treated with LPS only. The enhanced TGFβ activation in mice treated with LPS and TUDCA correlated with both an increase in TGFβ3 transcript in mouse brain and an increase in TGFβ3 immunoreactivity in microglia/macrophages, endothelial cells, and neurons. Inhibition of the TGFβ receptor with SB431542 drug reverted the effect of TUDCA on microglia/macrophages activation and on TGFβ3 immunoreactivity. Under inflammatory conditions, treatment with TUDCA enhanced further the activation of TGFβ pathway in mouse brain and increased the expression of TGFβ3. Therefore, the induction of TGFβ3 by TUDCA might act as a positive feedback, increasing the initial activation of the TGFβ pathway by the inflammatory stimulus. Our findings provide proof-of-concept that TGFβ contributes to the anti-inflammatory effect of TUDCA under neuroinflammatory conditions.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30268667>Ursodeoxycholic acid ameliorates diabetic retinopathy via reducing retinal inflammation and reversing the breakdown of blood-retinal barrier.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the hydrolysis of , which is the main ingredient from bear gall that has functions including clearing heat and detoxification, and improving eyesight.

Histological and biochemical markers of kidney injury, renal cell death and renal  were assessed.In ET -deficient rats, high salt diet significantly increased glomerular and proximal tubular histological injury, proteinuria, albuminuria, excretion of tubular injury markers KIM-1 and NGAL, renal cortical cell death and renal CD4 T cell numbers. TUDCA treatment increased proximal tubule megalin expression as well as prevented high salt diet-induced glomerular and tubular damage in ET -deficient rats, as indicated by reduced kidney injury markers, decreased glomerular permeability and proximal tubule brush border restoration, as well as reduced renal . However, TUDCA had no significant effect on blood pressure.TUDCA protects against the development of glomerular and proximal tubular damage, decreases renal cell death and  in the renal cortex in rats with ET receptor dysfunction on a chronic high salt diet. These results highlight the potential use of TUDCA as a preventive tool against chronic high salt induced renal damage.© 2018 Scandinavian Physiological Society.

Targeting the gut-liver axis and bile acid-based pharmaceuticals are potential therapies for NAFLD. The effect of  (TUDCA), a candidate drug for NAFLD, on intestinal barrier function, intestinal inflammation, gut lipid transport and microbiota composition was analysed in a murine model of NAFLD.The NAFLD mouse model was established by feeding mice a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. TUDCA was administered p.o. during the last 4 weeks. The expression levels of intestinal tight junction genes, lipid metabolic and inflammatory genes were determined by quantitative PCR. Tissue inflammation was evaluated by haematoxylin and eosin staining. The gut microbiota was analysed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.TUDCA administration attenuated HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, inflammatory responses,  and insulin resistance in mice. Moreover, TUDCA attenuated gut inflammatory responses as manifested by decreased intestinal histopathology scores and inflammatory cytokine levels. In addition, TUDCA improved intestinal barrier function by increasing levels of tight junction molecules and the solid chemical barrier. The components involved in ileum lipid transport were also reduced by TUDCA administration in HFD-fed mice. Finally, the TUDCA-treated mice showed a different gut microbiota composition compared with that in HFD-fed mice but similar to that in normal chow diet-fed mice.TUDCA attenuates the progression of HFD-induced NAFLD in mice by ameliorating gut inflammation, improving intestinal barrier function, decreasing intestinal fat transport and modulating intestinal microbiota composition.© 2017 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26499839>Administration of  enhances osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and bone regeneration.</a></h2><p>It is known that osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be promoted by suppression of adipogenesis of MSCs. We have recently found that the chemical chaperone  (TUDCA) significantly reduces adipogenesis of MSCs. In the present study, we examined whether TUDCA can promote osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) by regulating Integrin 5 (ITGA5) associated with activation of ERK1/2 signal pathway and thereby enhance bone tissue regeneration by reducing apoptosis and the inflammatory response. TUDCA treatment promoted in vitro osteogenic differentiation of BMMSCs and in vivo bone tissue regeneration in a calvarial defect model, as confirmed by micro-computed tomography, histological staining, and immunohistochemistry for osteocalcin. In addition, TUDCA treatment significantly decreased apoptosis and the inflammatory response in vivo and in vitro, which is important to enhance bone tissue regeneration. These results indicate that TUDCA plays a critical role in enhancing osteogenesis of BMMSCs, and is therefore a potential alternative drug for bone tissue regeneration.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, we determined the in vivo contribution of EGFRtk and ER stress in acute myocardial infarction induced by acute ischemia (40 min)-reperfusion (24 h) (I/R) injury in T2D (db/db) mice. We treated db/db mice with EGFRtk inhibitor (AG1478, 10 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks. Mice were then subjected to myocardial I/R injury. The db/db mice developed a significant infarct after I/R injury. The inhibition of EGFRtk significantly reduced the infarct size and ER stress induction. We also determined that the inhibition of ER stress (, TUDCA, 150 mg/kg per day) in db/db significantly decrease the infarct size indicating that ER stress is a downstream mechanism to EGFRtk. Moreover, AG1478 and TUDCA reduced myocardium p38 and ERK1/2 MAP-kinases activity, and increased the activity of the pro-survival signaling cascade Akt. Additionally, the inhibition of EGFRtk and ER stress reduced cell apoptosis and the  as indicated by the reduction in macrophages and neutrophil infiltration. We determined for the first time that the inhibition of EGFRtk protects T2D heart against I/R injury through ER stress-dependent mechanism. The cardioprotective effect of EGFRtk and ER stress inhibition involves the activation of survival pathway, and inhibition of apoptosis, and . Thus, targeting EGFRtk and ER stress has the potential for therapy to overcome myocardial infarction in T2D.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25443293>Amyloid-β pathology is attenuated by  treatment in APP/PS1 mice after disease onset.</a></h2><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder hallmarked by the accumulation of extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide and intraneuronal hyperphosphorylated tau, as well as chronic neuroinflammation.  (TUDCA) is an endogenous anti-apoptotic bile acid with potent neuroprotective properties in several experimental models of AD. We have previously reported the therapeutic efficacy of TUDCA treatment before amyloid plaque deposition in APP/PS1 double-transgenic mice. In the present study, we evaluated the protective effects of TUDCA when administrated after the onset of amyloid pathology. APP/PS1 transgenic mice with 7 months of age were injected intraperitoneally with TUDCA (500 mg/kg) every 3 days for 3 months. TUDCA treatment significantly attenuated Aβ deposition in the brain, with a concomitant decrease in Aβ₁₋₄₀ and Aβ₁₋₄₂ levels. The amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein was also reduced, indicating that TUDCA interferes with Aβ production. In addition, TUDCA abrogated GSK3β hyperactivity, which is highly implicated in tau hyperphosphorylation and glial activation. This effect was likely dependent on the specific activation of the upstream kinase, Akt. Finally, TUDCA treatment decreased glial activation and reduced proinflammatory cytokine messenger RNA expression, while partially rescuing synaptic loss. Overall, our results suggest that TUDCA is a promising therapeutic strategy not only for prevention but also for treatment of AD after disease onset.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Accumulating evidence suggests that signaling through these receptors is impaired in inflammatory bowel disease. We investigated whether  (TUDCA), a secondary bile acid with cytoprotective properties, regulates ileal nuclear receptor and bile acid transporter expression and assessed its therapeutic potential in an experimental model of Crohn's disease (CD). Gene expression of the nuclear receptors farnesoid X receptor, pregnane X receptor and vitamin D receptor and the bile acid transporters apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter and organic solute transporter α and β was analyzed in Caco-2 cell monolayers exposed to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, in ileal tissue of TNF mice and in inflamed ileal biopsies from CD patients by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. TNF mice and wild-type littermates were treated with TUDCA or placebo for 11 weeks and ileal histopathology and expression of the aforementioned genes were determined. Exposing Caco-2 cell monolayers to TNFα impaired the mRNA expression of nuclear receptors and bile acid transporters, whereas co-incubation with TUDCA antagonized their downregulation. TNF mice displayed altered ileal bile acid homeostasis that mimicked the situation in human CD ileitis. Administration of TUDCA attenuated ileitis and alleviated the downregulation of nuclear receptors and bile acid transporters in these mice. These results show that TUDCA protects bile acid homeostasis under inflammatory conditions and suppresses CD-like ileitis. Together with previous observations showing similar efficacy in experimental colitis, we conclude that TUDCA could be a promising therapeutic agent for inflammatory bowel disease, warranting a clinical trial.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25310532> inhibits experimental colitis by preventing early intestinal epithelial cell death.</a></h2><p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is characterized by increased epithelial cell death and subsequent breakdown of the intestinal epithelial , which perpetuates chronic intestinal inflammation. Since fecal bile acid dysmetabolism is associated with UC and  (TUDCA) has been shown to improve murine colitis, we evaluated the effect of TUDCA on intestinal epithelial cell death in a mouse model of UC-like  dysfunction elicited by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). We identified the prevention of colonic caspase-3 induction, a key proapoptotic marker which was also over-activated in UC, as the earliest event resulting in a clear clinical benefit. Whereas vehicle-treated mice showed a cumulative mortality of 40%, all TUDCA-treated mice survived the DSS experiment during a 14-day follow-up period. In line with a  protective effect, TUDCA decreased bacterial translocation to the spleen and stimulated mucin production. Similarly, TUDCA inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced intestinal permeability and associated enterocyte apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic effect was confirmed in vitro by a dose-dependent inhibition of both receptor-dependent (using tumor necrosis factor and Fas ligand) and receptor-independent (staurosporine) caspase-3 induction in HT29 colonic epithelial cells. These data imply that caspase-3 activation is an early marker of colitis that is prevented by TUDCA treatment. These data, together with the previously reported beneficial effect in colitis, suggest that TUDCA could be an add-on strategy to current immunosuppressive treatment of UC patients.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31150794>Amelioration of dry eye syndrome in db/db mice with diabetes mellitus by treatment with Tibetan Medicine Formula Jikan Mingmu Drops.</a></h2><p>Jikan Mingmu Drops (JMD), a traditional Tibetan medicine containing six herbs, has been used to treat dry eye syndrome (DES) in individuals with diabetes mellitus.However, the activity of JMD ameliorates DES with diabetes mellitus has not been previously examined.

However, the benefits of inhibiting ER stress in the treatment of allergic airway disease are not well known. Herein, we tested the therapeutic potential of a chemical chaperone,  (TUDCA), in combating allergic asthma, using a mouse model of house dust mite (HDM)-induced allergic airway disease. TUDCA was administered during the HDM-challenge phase (preventive regimen), after the HDM-challenge phase (therapeutic regimen), or therapeutically during a subsequent HDM rechallenge (rechallenge regimen). In the preventive regimen, TUDCA significantly decreased HDM-induced , markers of ER stress, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), and fibrosis. Similarly, in the therapeutic regimen, TUDCA administration efficiently decreased HDM-induced airway , mucus metaplasia, ER stress markers, and AHR, but not airway remodeling.

(TUDCA) is a recognized endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) inhibitor which can inhibit cell apoptosis. Recently, intestinal cell apoptosis has been demonstrated to be vital for the pathogenesis of NEC. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the potential of TUDCA in the treatment of NEC and the possible mechanisms in vivo and in vitro. Our results showed that TUDCA reduced mortality rates, prolonged survival times, significantly diminished intestinal damage, and inhibited intestinal inflammation in the mouse model of NEC. The protective effect of TUDCA on the NEC mouse model was realized through inhibiting the expression levels of ERS markers and inhibiting the apoptosis of intestinal cells. In addition, TUDCA increased the expression of phospho-Akt (p-Akt). Furthermore, we confirmed that TUDCA inhibited the apoptosis of intestinal cells by modulating the PERK-eIF2α ERS pathway and the Akt pathway in vitro studies. Besides, TUDCA effects were impaired by AKT specific inhibitor MK2206 in vitro studies.

However, the ontogeny of dysfunctional neutrophil during septic colitis remain poorly understood. We report that the dysfunctional neutrophil may be derived by the suppression of Toll-interacting-protein (Tollip). We observed that Tollip deficient neutrophils had compromised migratory capacity toward bacterial product fMLF due to reduced activity of AKT and reduction of FPR2, reduced potential to generate bacterial-killing neutrophil extra-cellular trap (NET), and compromised bacterial killing activity. On the other hand, Tollip deficient neutrophils had elevated levels of CCR5, responsible for their homing to sterile inflamed tissues. The inflamed and incompetent neutrophil phenotype was also observed in vivo in Tollip deficient mice subjected to DSS-induced colitis. We observed that TUDCA, a compound capable of restoring Tollip cellular function, can potently alleviate the severity of DSS-induced colitis. In humans, we observed significantly reduced Tollip levels in peripheral blood collected from human colitis patients as compared to blood samples from healthy donors.

RPGR plays a critical role as a scaffold protein in the regulation of protein trafficking from the basal body to the axoneme, where the cargoes are transported to the outer segments (OSs) of photoreceptors.

We hypothesized that the hypothalamic opioid system might also control energy metabolism in peripheral tissues. Mice lacking the kappa opioid receptor (κOR) and adenoviral vectors overexpressing or silencing κOR were stereotaxically delivered in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) of rats. Vagal denervation was performed to assess its effect on liver metabolism. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was inhibited by pharmacological () and genetic (overexpression of the chaperone glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa) approaches. The peripheral effects on lipid metabolism were assessed by histological techniques and western blot. We show that in the LHA κOR directly controls hepatic lipid metabolism through the parasympathetic nervous system, independent of changes in food intake and body weight. κOR colocalizes with melanin concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCH-R1) in the LHA, and genetic disruption of κOR reduced melanin concentrating hormone-induced liver steatosis. The functional relevance of these findings was given by the fact that silencing of κOR in the LHA attenuated both methionine choline-deficient, diet-induced and choline-deficient, high-fat diet-induced ER stress, , steatohepatitis, and fibrosis, whereas overexpression of κOR in this area promoted liver steatosis. Overexpression of glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa in the liver abolished hypothalamic κOR-induced steatosis by reducing hepatic ER stress.This study reveals a novel hypothalamic-parasympathetic circuit modulating hepatic function through  and ER stress independent of changes in food intake or body weight; these findings might have implications for the clinical use of opioid receptor antagonists.

Myristic acid (MA), a free fatty acid highly abundant in copra/palmist oils, is a predictor of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and stimulates ceramide synthesis. Here we investigated the synergism between MA and PA in ceramide synthesis, ER stress, lipotoxicity and NASH. Unlike PA, MA is not lipotoxic but potentiated PA-mediated lipoapoptosis, ER stress, caspase-3 activation and cytochrome c release in primary mouse hepatocytes (PMH). Moreover, MA kinetically sustained PA-induced total ceramide content by stimulating dehydroceramide desaturase and switched the ceramide profile from decreased to increased ceramide 14:0/ceramide16:0, without changing medium and long-chain ceramide species. PMH were more sensitive to equimolar ceramide14:0/ceramide16:0 exposure, which mimics the outcome of PA plus MA treatment on ceramide homeostasis, than to either ceramide alone. Treatment with myriocin to inhibit ceramide synthesis and  to prevent ER stress ameliorated PA plus MA induced apoptosis, similar to the protection afforded by the antioxidant BHA, the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-Fmk and JNK inhibition. Moreover, ruthenium red protected PMH against PA and MA-induced cell death. Recapitulating in vitro findings, mice fed a diet enriched in PA plus MA exhibited lipodystrophy, hepatosplenomegaly, increased liver ceramide content and cholesterol levels, ER stress, liver damage,  and fibrosis compared to mice fed diets enriched in PA or MA alone. The deleterious effects of PA plus MA-enriched diet were largely prevented by in vivo myriocin treatment. These findings indicate a causal link between ceramide synthesis and ER stress in lipotoxicity, and imply that the consumption of diets enriched in MA and PA can cause NASH associated with lipodystrophy.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30223017>RNF186 impairs insulin sensitivity by inducing ER stress in mouse primary hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>RING finger 186 (RNF186) is involved in the process of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress-mediated apoptosis and inflammation of different cell types, such as HeLa cells and colon epithelial cells. However, the physiological and functional roles of RNF186 in peripheral tissues remain largely unknown. In the current study, we investigate the physiological function of RNF186 in the regulation of ER stress with respect to its biological roles in regulating insulin sensitivity in mouse primary hepatocytes. RNF186 expression is induced in the livers of diabetic, obese and diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Mouse primary hepatocytes were isolated and treated with Ad-RNF186 or Ad-GFP. The results suggest that overexpression of RNF186 increases the protein levels of the ER stress sensors inositol requiring kinase 1 (IRE1) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) protein, as well as the phosphorylation level of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), in mouse primary hepatocytes. This effect impedes the action of insulin through c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1). Furthermore, overexpression of RNF186 also significantly increases the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNFα, IL-6 and MCP1. In addition,  (TUDCA), an ER stress inhibitor, alleviates the expression of ER stress markers induced by RNF186 overexpression.
