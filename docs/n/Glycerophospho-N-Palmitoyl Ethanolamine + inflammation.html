We hypothesized that RCTs in septic shock show significant differences between treatment groups in organ support despite no mortality differences.RCTs of epinephrine vs. norepinephrine plus dobutamine, norepinephrine vs. dopamine and vasopressin vs. norepinephrine reported days alive and free ("DAF") of vasopressors, ventilation and RRT, by subtracting days with support from the lesser of 28 or days to death. We also assigned zero DAF to non-survivors ("DAF and Mortality") and calculated the composite "DAF vasopressors, ventilation and RRT".Using "DAF", norepinephrine was better than dopamine for vasopressors. In contrast, using "DAF and Mortality", norepinephrine was better than dopamine for vasopressors, ventilation and RRT; norepinephrine + dobutamine was better than epinephrine for ventilation. Using the novel composite "DAF vasopressors, ventilation and RRT", norepinephrine + dobutamine was better than epinephrine (p = 0.033), norepinephrine better than dopamine (p = 0.03), and vasopressin better than norepinephrine in less severe shock (p = 0.03).Differences between treatment groups in organ dysfunction in RCTs in septic shock occur despite lack of mortality differences depending on calculation method. If standardized and validated further, DAF could become the primary endpoint of RCTs in septic shock.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Significant effort is invested in understanding how pollutants encountered by the lung might induce effects in distant organs. The role of circulating mediators has been predicted; however, their origin and identity have not been confirmed. New evidence has emerged which implicates the role of neuroendocrine sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress axes in mediating a wide array of systemic and pulmonary effects. Our recent studies using ozone exposure as a prototypical air pollutant demonstrate that increases in circulating adrenal-derived stress hormones (epinephrine and cortisol/corticosterone) contribute to lung injury/ and metabolic effects in the liver, pancreas, adipose, and muscle tissues. When stress hormones are depleted by adrenalectomy in rats, most ozone effects including lung injury/ are diminished. Animals treated with antagonists for adrenergic and glucocorticoid receptors show inhibition of the pulmonary and systemic effects of ozone, whereas treatment with agonists restore and exacerbate the ozone-induced injury/ phenotype, implying the role of neuroendocrine activation. The neuroendocrine system is critical for normal homeostasis and allostatic activation; however, chronic exposure to stressors may lead to increases in allostatic load. The emerging mechanisms by which circulating mediators are released and are responsible for producing multiorgan effects of air pollutants insists upon a paradigm shift in the field of air pollution and health. Moreover, since these neuroendocrine responses are linked to both chemical and nonchemical stressors, the interactive influence of air pollutants, lifestyle, and environmental factors requires further study.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30371952>Heliox for croup in children.</a></h2><p>Croup is an acute viral respiratory infection with upper airway mucosal  that may cause respiratory distress. Most cases are mild. Moderate to severe croup may require treatment with corticosteroids (from which benefits are often delayed) and nebulised epinephrine (adrenaline) (which may be short-lived and can cause dose-related adverse effects including tachycardia, arrhythmias, and hypertension). Rarely, croup results in respiratory failure necessitating emergency intubation and ventilation.A mixture of helium and oxygen (heliox) may prevent morbidity and mortality in ventilated neonates by reducing the viscosity of the inhaled air. It is currently used during emergency transport of children with severe croup. Anecdotal evidence suggests that it relieves respiratory distress.This review updates versions published in 2010 and 2013.To examine the effect of heliox compared to oxygen or other active interventions, placebo, or no treatment, on relieving signs and symptoms in children with croup as determined by a croup score and rates of admission and intubation.We searched CENTRAL, which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; and LILACS in January and February 2018. We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (apps.who.int/trialsearch/) and ClinicalTrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov) on 8 February 2018. We contacted British Oxygen Company, a leading supplier of heliox (BOC Australia 2017).Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing the effect of heliox in comparison with placebo or any active intervention(s) in children with croup.We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We reported data that could not be pooled for statistical analysis descriptively.We included 3 RCTs with 91 children aged between 6 months and 4 years. Study duration was from 7 to 16 months; all studies were conducted in emergency departments in the USA (two studies) and Spain. Heliox was administered as a mixture of 70% heliox and 30% oxygen. Risk of bias was low in two studies and high in one study due to an open-label design. We added no new trials for this update.One study of 15 children with mild croup compared heliox with 30% humidified oxygen administered for 20 minutes. There may be no difference in croup score changes between groups at 20 minutes (mean difference (MD) -0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.36 to 0.70). The mean croup score at 20 minutes postintervention may not differ between groups (MD -0.57, 95% CI -1.46 to 0.32). There may be no difference between groups in mean respiratory rate (MD 6.40, 95% CI -1.38 to 14.18) and mean heart rate (MD 14.50, 95% CI -8.49 to 37.49) at 20 minutes. The evidence for all outcomes in this comparison was of low quality, downgraded for serious imprecision. All children were discharged, but information on hospitalisation, intubation, or re-presenting to emergency departments was not reported.In another study, 47 children with moderate croup received one dose of oral dexamethasone (0.3 mg/kg) with either heliox for 60 minutes or no treatment. Heliox may slightly improve croup scores at 60 minutes postintervention (MD -1.10, 95% CI -1.96 to -0.24), but there may be no difference between groups at 120 minutes (MD -0.70, 95% CI -4.86 to 3.46). Children treated with heliox may have lower mean Taussig croup scores at 60 minutes (MD -1.11, 95% CI -2.05 to -0.17) but not at 120 minutes (MD -0.71, 95% CI -1.72 to 0.30). Children treated with heliox may have lower mean respiratory rates at 60 minutes (MD -4.94, 95% CI -9.66 to -0.22), but there may be no difference at 120 minutes (MD -3.17, 95% CI -7.83 to 1.49). There may be no difference in hospitalisation rates between groups (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.04 to 5.41). We assessed the evidence for all outcomes in this comparison as of low quality, downgraded due to imprecision and high risk of bias related to open-label design. Information on heart rate and intubation was not reported.In the third study, 29 children with moderate to severe croup received intramuscular dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg) and either heliox with one to two doses of nebulised saline, or 100% oxygen with one to two doses of adrenaline for three hours. Heliox may slightly improve croup scores at 90 minutes postintervention, but may have little or no difference overall using repeated measures analysis. We assessed the evidence for all outcomes in this comparison as of low quality, downgraded due to high risk of bias related to inadequate reporting. Information on hospitalisation or re-presenting to the emergency department was not reported.The included studies did not report on adverse events, intensive care admissions, or parental anxiety.We could not pool the available data because each comparison included data from only one study.Due to very limited evidence, uncertainty remains about the effectiveness and safety of heliox. Heliox may not be more effective than 30% humidified oxygen for children with mild croup, but may be beneficial in the short term for children with moderate to severe croup treated with dexamethasone. The effect may be similar to 100% oxygen given with one or two doses of adrenaline. Adverse events were not reported, and it is unclear if these were monitored in the included studies. Adequately powered RCTs comparing heliox with standard treatments are needed to further assess the role of heliox in the treatment of children with moderate to severe croup.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30373638>Early therapeutic plasma exchange in septic shock: a prospective open-label nonrandomized pilot study focusing on safety, hemodynamics, vascular barrier function, and biologic markers.</a></h2><p>Given the pathophysiological key role of the host response to an infection rather than the infection per se, an ideal therapeutic strategy would also target this response. This study was designed to demonstrate safety and feasibility of early therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) in severely ill individuals with septic shock.This was a prospective single center, open-label, nonrandomized pilot study enrolling 20 patients with early septic shock (onset < 12 h) requiring high doses of norepinephrine (NE; > 0.4 μg/kg/min) out of 231 screened septic patients. Clinical and biochemical data were obtained before and after TPE. Plasma samples were taken for ex-vivo stimulation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to analyze barrier function (immunocytochemistry and transendothelial electrical resistance (TER)). Cytokines were measured by cytometric bead array (CBA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). An immediate response was defined as > 20% NE reduction from baseline to the end of TPE.TPE was well tolerated without the occurrence of any adverse events and was associated with a rapid reduction in NE (0.82 (0.61-1.17) vs. 0.56 (0.41-0.78) μg/kg/min, p = 0.002) to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg. The observed 28-day mortality was 65%. Key proinflammatory cytokines and permeability factors (e.g., interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1b, and angiopoietin-2) were significantly reduced after TPE, while the protective antipermeability factor angiopoietin-1 was not changed. Ex-vivo stimulation of HUVECs with plasma obtained before TPE induced substantial cellular hyperpermeability, which was completely abolished with plasma obtained after TPE.Inclusion of early septic shock patients with high doses of vasopressors was feasible and TPE was safe. Rapid hemodynamic improvement and favorable changes in the cytokine profile in patients with septic shock were observed. It has yet to be determined whether early TPE also improves outcomes in this patient cohort. An appropriately powered multicenter randomized controlled trial is desirable.Clinicaltrials.gov,  .

It is characterised by chronic  in the lungs that leads to progressive, chronic, largely irreversible airflow obstruction. The use of long-acting β agonists remain today the frontline treatment for COPD with the aim of minimizing side effects and enhancing therapeutic usefulness. To this purpose, in this paper, mucoadhesive solid lipid microparticles (SLMs) containing a long-acting β-2 agonist, Salmeterol Xinafoate (SX) were prepared, characterised (size, z-potential, aerodynamic diameter, turbidimetric evaluations, drug loading and entrapping efficiency) and tested in a model of bronchial epithelial cells. It was demonstrated that the incorporation of SX into SLMs led to the production of particles suitable for inhalation and more efficient than the free molecule at increasing the cAMP expression in bronchial epithelial cells. In conclusion, the prepared systems, due to their aerodynamic behaviour and mucoadhesive properties, could improve the retention time of SX in the lung epithelium and its therapeutic effect, thus representing a good strategy for the treatment of COPD patients.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Clinical manifestations of non-motor and motor symptoms in PD stem from decades of progressive neurodegeneration selectively afflicting discrete neuronal populations along a caudo-rostral axis. However, recapitulating this spatiotemporal neurodegenerative pattern in rodents has been unsuccessful. The purpose of this study was to generate such animal PD models and delineate mechanism underlying the ascending neurodegeneration. Neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal death in mice brains were measured at different times following a single systemic injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We demonstrate that LPS produced an ascending neurodegeneration that temporally afflicted neurons initially in the locus coeruleus (LC), followed by substantia nigra, and lastly the primary motor cortex and hippocampus. To test the hypothesis that LPS-elicited early loss of noradrenergic LC neurons may underlie this ascending pattern, we used a neurotoxin N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4) to deplete brain norepinephrine. DSP-4 injection resulted in a time-dependent ascending degenerative pattern similar to that generated by the LPS model. Mechanistic studies revealed that increase in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase-2 (NOX2)-dependent superoxide/reactive oxygen species (ROS) production plays a key role in both LPS- and DSP-4-elicited neurotoxicity. We found that toxin-elicited chronic neuroinflammation, oxidative neuronal injuries, and neurodegeneration were greatly suppressed in mice deficient in NOX2 gene or treated with NOX2-specific inhibitor. Our studies document the first rodent PD model recapturing the ascending neurodegenerative pattern of PD patients and provide convincing evidence that the loss of brain norepinephrine is critical in initiating and maintaining chronic neuroinflammation and the discrete neurodegeneration in PD.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29775687>Effects of bronchodilation on biomarkers of peripheral airway  in COPD.</a></h2><p>Peripheral airway  and dysfunction are key elements in the pathogenesis of COPD. The exhaled alveolar fraction of nitric oxide (CANO) is an indirect biomarker of lung peripheral . We tested whether inhaled long-acting bronchodilators (LABA) can affect CANO and we evaluated correlations with lung mechanics in patients with COPD. Two-centre, randomised, double blind, crossover study including COPD patients with moderate-to-severe airflow obstruction. Following a pharmacological washout, multi-flow exhaled fraction of NO (FENO), plethysmography, lung diffusion (DLCO), single breath nitrogen washout test and dyspnoea were measured in a crossover manner at baseline and 30, 60 and 180 min following administration of salmeterol (Sal) or formoterol fumarate (FF). (ClinicalTrials.gov, number ). Fort-five patients were enrolled (median age: 71.8 years; 84.4% males). At baseline, CANO correlated with airway resistances (r = 0.422), residual volume/total lung capacity (RV/TLC; r = 0.375), transfer factor (r= -0.463) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1; r= -0.375, all P < 0.01). After LABA administration, we found a significant reduction of FENO that reached statistical significance at 180'; no difference was found between FF and S. Consistently, a significant reduction of CANO was documented at 60' and 180' compared to baseline for both FF and S (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). Changes in CANO were correlated with changes in vital capacity (r=-44; P < 0.001) and RV/TLC (r = 0.56; P < 0.001), but not FEV1. In COPD, direct correlations were found between the levels of CANO and the magnitude of peripheral airway dysfunction. LABA reduced CANO levels. The reduction was associated with improvement in functional parameters reflecting air trapping.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aimed to investigate the potential neuroprotective effect of defatted walnut meal protein hydrolysates (DWMPH) on neurotoxicity induced by d-galactose (d-gal) and aluminum chloride (AlCl₃) in mice. The animal models were established by combining treatments with d-gal (200 mg/kg/day, subcutaneously) and AlCl₃ (100 mg/kg in drinking water) for 90 days. During the 90 days, 1 g/kg of DWMPH was administrated orally every day. The results indicated that DWMPH treatment alleviated oxidative stress, reversed cholinergic dysfunction, and suppressed the release of proinflammatory cytokines in the brains of d-gal + AlCl₃-treated mice, and thus improving the learning and memory functions of these mice, which was closely correlated with the strong antioxidant activity of DWMPH.

Catecholamines are the most commonly used vasoactive agents in the intensive care unit, and among them norepinephrine is the first-line therapy in most clinical conditions. Inotropes are indicated when myocardial function is depressed and dobutamine remains the first-line therapy. Vasoactive drugs have a narrow therapeutic spectrum and expose the patients to potentially lethal complications. Thus, these agents require precise therapeutic targets, close monitoring with titration to the minimal efficacious dose and should be weaned as promptly as possible.

To determine whether increased choline concentrations (3.2, 8.2, 13.2 μM) in cell culture alter the function of bovine innate and adaptive immune cells, we isolated cells from dairy cows in early and mid-lactation as models of immuno-compromised and competent cells, respectively. Phagocytic and killing capacity of isolated neutrophils were linearly diminished with increasing doses of choline. In contrast, lymphocyte proliferation was linearly enhanced with increasing doses of choline. Furthermore, increasing doses of choline increased the mRNA abundance of genes involved in the synthesis of choline products (betaine, phosphatidylcholine, and acetylcholine) as well as muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in a quadratic and linear fashion for neutrophils and monocytes, respectively. Phagocytic and killing capacity of neutrophils and proliferation of lymphocytes were not affected by stage of lactation or its interaction with choline or LPS. In neutrophils from early lactation cows, choline linearly increased the mRNA abundance of muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic receptors, whereas choline-supplemented monocytes from mid-lactation cows linearly increased the mRNA abundance of several genes coding for choline metabolism enzymes. These data demonstrate that choline regulates the inflammatory response of immune cells and suggest that the mechanism may involve one or more of its metabolic products.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29782959>Targeting central β2 receptors ameliorates streptozotocin-induced neuroinflammation via inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase3 pathway in mice.</a></h2><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is portrayed by progressive cognitive decline and pathological deposition of amyloid plaques as well as neurofibrillary tangles. Most of AD cases are sporadic, resulting from overlap of various environmental and genetic factors. Intra-cerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (STZ) leads to insulin resistance brain state accompanied by memory decline, oxidative stress, and neuro-degeneration which mimic the pathologies associated with sporadic Alzheimer's disease (SAD). In the current study, protective effects of formoterol in STZ-induced SAD were studied. Formoterol-induced improvement in cognition was confirmed using Morris water maze and Y maze together with histopathological evidences. Moreover, prominent declines in oxidative stress, neuro-, and apoptotic parameters were recorded upon its injection in STZ-induced SAD mouse model. This was manifested by the decrement of malondialdehyde, hydrogen peroxide, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and caspase-3levels contrary to reduced glutathione and interleukin-10 increments. Formoterol also reversed STZ-induced alteration in acetylcholine and glutamate levels.

A recently proposed therapy to control vascular injury through inflammatory processes involves inhibition of the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP4). The present study investigates whether the inhibition of DPP4 prevents the increase in inflammatory markers induced by isoproterenol and restores endothelial function in vivo and in vitro. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: vehicle (VHC), an isoproterenol-treated group (ISO), a sitagliptin-treated group (SITA), and an isoproterenol and sitagliptin-treated group (ISO + SITA). The ISO group exhibited significantly increased contractile responses to phenylephrine associated with reduced endothelial participation, which was totally prevented by DPP4 inhibition. In vitro incubation with isoproterenol had no effect on vascular smooth muscle cells, however isoproterenol increased the activity of DPP4 and the expression of inflammatory cytokines in endothelial cells, while sitagliptin reduced the level of cytokines to basal level. In conclusion, we have shown that beta-adrenergic receptor activation can increase DPP4 activity, which was associated with vascular dysfunction and cytokine expression in endothelial cells. The important role of DPP4 was further supported by sitagliptin, which reversed vascular changes induced by isoproterenol in vivo and in vitro.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Its biological actions are primarily mediated by PPAR-α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors α) and the orphan receptor GPR55. Palmitoylethanolamide exerts potent anti-inflammatory actions but its physiological role and promise as a therapeutic agent in chronic arterial , such as atherosclerosis remain unexplored. Approach and Results- First, the polarization of mouse primary macrophages towards a proinflammatory phenotype was found to reduce N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D expression and palmitoylethanolamide bioavailability. N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D expression was progressively downregulated in the aorta of apolipoprotein E deficient (ApoE) mice during atherogenesis. N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D mRNA levels were also downregulated in unstable human plaques and they positively associated with smooth muscle cell markers and negatively with macrophage markers. Second, ApoE mice were fed a high-fat diet for 4 or 16 weeks and treated with either vehicle or palmitoylethanolamide (3 mg/kg per day, 4 weeks) to study the effects of palmitoylethanolamide on early established and pre-established atherosclerosis. Palmitoylethanolamide treatment reduced plaque size in early atherosclerosis, whereas in pre-established atherosclerosis, palmitoylethanolamide promoted signs of plaque stability as evidenced by reduced macrophage accumulation and necrotic core size, increased collagen deposition and downregulation of M1-type macrophage markers. Mechanistically, we found that palmitoylethanolamide, by activating GPR55, increases the expression of the phagocytosis receptor MerTK (proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase MER) and enhances macrophage efferocytosis, indicative of proresolving properties. Conclusions- The present study demonstrates that palmitoylethanolamide protects against atherosclerosis by promoting an anti-inflammatory and proresolving phenotype of lesional macrophages, representing a new therapeutic approach to resolve arterial .</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30037606>Asprosin: Possible target in connection with ghrelin and cytokine network expression in the post-burn treatment.</a></h2><p>Burn injury is a severe form of trauma associated with pain, metabolic abnormalities, susceptibility to infections, muscle loss, mental and emotional distress. Conventional therapies as well as some recent approaches for the treatment of burned patients are currently in use. Nutritional therapy is also suggested as a supplementary option in major burns. Within this context, hormones involved in the regulation of appetite will have a paramount importance. The aim is to evaluate the interactions among ghrelin, some inflammatory parameters and the burn injury. Asprosin is also involved into this discussion due to its ghrelin-like actions. Aside from the consideration of insulin as well as stress hormones (cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine), an orexigenic, anti-inflammatory hormone, ghrelin affecting both metabolic and inflammatory systems is also involved in the protocols designed for burn treatment. Ghrelin's actions exerted by way of growth-hormone secretagogue receptor, neuropeptide Y, agouti-related protein, proopiomelanocortin and gamma amino butyric acid are being investigated. Asprosin, one of the remarkably few hormones identified as appetite stimulator, acts as another orexigenic hormone by using almost the same signalling pathways as those of ghrelin. Interleukin-6 should also be evaluated both as a reliable biomarker of  and also with its inhibitory effects on TNF-α within the scope of burn injury. In conclusion, treatment protocols during burn injury may be designed to raise decreased concentrations of ghrelin and to repress increased levels of inflammatory agents such as TNF-α. IL-6 may be evaluated from an entirely different aspect. The potential therapeutic use of asprosin may be considered within an integrative approach with a focus on cachexia-anorexia developed in severe burn trauma.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Bis-retinoid N-retinyl-N-retinylidene  (A2E) is a major component of lipofuscin. A2E has been implicated in RPE atrophy and retinal ; however, mice with A2E accumulation display only a mild retinal phenotype. In the current study, human iPSC-RPE (hiPSC-RPE) cells were generated from healthy individuals to examine effects of A2E in human RPE cells. hiPSC-RPE cells displayed RPE-specific features, which include expression of RPE-specific genes, tight junction formation and ability to carry out phagocytosis. hiPSC-RPE cells demonstrated cell death and increased VEGF-A production in a time-dependent manner when they were cocultured with 10μM of A2E. PCR array analyses revealed upregulation of 26 and 12 pro-inflammatory cytokines upon A2E and HO exposure respectively, indicating that A2E and HO can cause  in human retinas. Notably, identified gene profiles were different between A2E- and HO- treated hiPSC-RPE cells. A2E caused inflammatory changes observed in retinal degenerative diseases more closely as compared to HO.

The contribution of other factors to the dedifferentiation process is not completely understood. Recent studies suggested a dose-dependent role for the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) in OA chondrocyte metabolism. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the contribution of NE (10 M, 10 M) to human articular OA chondrocyte dedifferentiation in the absence or presence of IL-1β (0.5 ng/mL). Here, we demonstrate that OA chondrocytes express α2A-, α2C- and β2-adrenoceptors (AR) and show the characteristic shift towards a fibroblast-like shape at day 7 in physioxic monolayer culture. NE alone did not affect morphology but, in combination with IL-1β, markedly accelerated this shift. Moderate glycosaminoglycan (GAG) staining was observed in untreated and NE-treated cells, while IL-1β strongly decreased GAG deposition. IL-1β alone or in combination with NE decreased SOX9, type II collagen, COMP, and aggrecan, and induced MMP13 and ADAMTS4 gene expression, indicating an accelerated dedifferentiation. NE alone did not influence gene expression and did not modulate IL-1β-mediated effects. In conclusion, these results indicate that low-grade  exerts a dominant effect on chondrocyte dedifferentiation and should be targeted early in OA therapy.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30359371>N-substituted phenylbenzamides of the niclosamide chemotype attenuate obesity related changes in high fat diet fed mice.</a></h2><p>Obesity and insulin resistance are primary risk factors for Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD).

However, a significant subset of patient's progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that is defined by the presence of steatosis,  and hepatocyte injury with fibrosis. Unfortunately, there are no approved therapies for NAFLD or NASH and therefore therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Niclosamide is an U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anthelmintic drug that mediates its effect by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation. Niclosamide and its salt forms, Niclosamide  (NEN), and Niclosamide Piperazine (NPP) have shown efficacy in murine models of diet induced obesity characterized by attenuation of the prominent fatty liver disease phenotype and improved glucose metabolism. While the exact mechanism(s) underlying these changes remains unclear, the ability to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation leading to increased energy expenditure and lipid metabolism or attenuation of PKA mediated glucagon signaling in the liver have been proposed. Unfortunately, niclosamide has very poor water solubility, leading to low oral bioavailability. This, in addition to mitochondrial uncoupling activity and potential genotoxicity have reduced enthusiasm for its clinical use. More recently, salt forms of niclosamide, NEN and NPP, have demonstrated improved oral bioavailability while retaining activity. This suggests that development of safer more effective niclosamide derivatives for the treatment of NAFLD and Type 2 Diabetes may be possible. Herein we explored the ability of a series of N-substituted phenylbenzamide derivatives of the niclosamide salicylanilide chemotype to attenuate hepatic steatosis using a novel phenotypic in vitro model of fatty liver and the high fat diet-fed mouse model of diet induced obesity. These studies identified novel compounds with improved pre-clinical properties that attenuate hepatic steatosis in vitro and in vivo. These compounds with improved drug properties may be useful in alleviating symptoms and protection against disease progression in patients with metabolic syndrome and NAFLD.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30858867>Tetramethylpyrazine exerts a protective effect against injury from acute myocardial ischemia by regulating the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>We investigated the protective effect of tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) on injury related to acute myocardial ischemia (AMI) induced by isoproterenol (ISO).Rats were randomly assigned to five groups: control, ISO, ISO + propranolol (10 mg/kg), ISO + TMP (10 mg/kg) and ISO + TMP (20 mg/kg). The rats in the three ISO + groups were pretreated with propranolol or TMP, while the rats in the control and ISO groups were pretreated with an equal volume of saline. Afterwards, the rats in the four administration groups were subcutaneously injected with ISO for two consecutive days. The levels of creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-1β in the serum were measured using ELISA. The expressions of B-cell lymphoma-associated X-2 (Bax-2), B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (Akt), glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), MDA5 and SOD1 were determined using western blotting assay. The phosphorylation of PI3K, Akt and GSK-3β were also determined using western blotting assay. The left ventricles of the rats were extracted and stained using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The ST segment was recorded using electrocardiograms (ECGs).Administration of TMP (10, 20 mg/kg) reduced the levels of MDA and CK and the activities of SOD and LDH in the serum. Pretreatment with TMP significantly reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α. Treatment with TMP also improved the histopathological alteration and decreased the ST elevation. Furthermore, TMP ameliorated the expressions of Cu, SOD1, MDA5, Bax-2, Bcl-2, p-PI3K, p-Akt and p-GSK-3β in ISO-induced rats.Tetramethylpyrazine protected against injury due to AMI by regulating the PI3K/Akt /GSK-3β signaling pathway.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30362468>Anti-Depressant-Like Effect of Sinomenine on Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress-Induced Depression in a Mouse Model.</a></h2><p>BACKGROUND Sinomenine (SIN) is an extract of the Chinese medicinal herb Sinomenium acutum; it has various pharmacological properties, including immunosuppression and anti-. The present study aimed to investigate whether SIN has an anti-depressant-like effect in a mouse model of depression induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. MATERIAL AND METHODS A mouse model of depression was established and treated with different concentrations of SIN (30, 100, or 300 mg/kg). Then, behavioral tests, including sucrose preference test (SPT), forced swimming test (FST), and the tail suspension test (TST), were performed. The levels of norepinephrine (NE), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and proinﬂammatory cytokines (interleukin-1β [IL-1β] interleukin-6 [IL-6], and tumor necrosis factor-α [TNF-α]) in the hippocampus of mice were detected by ELISA assay. The levels of p-p38, p-p65, NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 were measured by Western blot or/and qRT-PCR. RESULTS The results showed that SIN significantly relieved CUMSinduced depressive-like behaviors. Compared with the model mice, SIN treatment significantly increased the sucrose preference of the mice, and the immobility time in the forced swimming and the tail suspension test were shortened. In addition, SIN decreased CUMS-induced reduction in the concentrations of NE and 5-HT in the hippocampus of mice. SIN reduced CUMS-induced increases in the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in the hippocampus of mice. Furthermore, activation of the p38MAPK-NF-κB pathway and the nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome induced by CUMS were inhibited by SIN treatment. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, our results indicate the antidepressantlike effects of SIN on chronic unpredictable mild stress-induced depression in a mouse model.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29382825>Ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide rescues learning and memory impairments in a triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease by exerting anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects.</a></h2><p>In an aging society, Alzheimer's disease (AD) exerts an increasingly serious health and economic burden. Current treatments provide inadequate symptomatic relief as several distinct pathological processes are thought to underlie the decline of cognitive and neural function seen in AD. This suggests that the efficacy of treatment requires a multitargeted approach. In this context, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) provides a novel potential adjunct therapy that can be incorporated into a multitargeted treatment strategy. We used young (6-month-old) and adult (12-month-old) 3×Tg-AD mice that received ultramicronized PEA (um-PEA) for 3 months via a subcutaneous delivery system. Mice were tested with a range of cognitive and noncognitive tasks, scanned with magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRI/MRS), and neurochemical release was assessed by microdialysis. Potential neuropathological mechanisms were assessed postmortem by western blot, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and immunofluorescence. Our data demonstrate that um-PEA improves learning and memory, and ameliorates both the depressive and anhedonia-like phenotype of 3×Tg-AD mice. Moreover, it reduces Aβ formation, the phosphorylation of tau proteins, and promotes neuronal survival in the CA1 subregion of the hippocampus. Finally, um-PEA normalizes astrocytic function, rebalances glutamatergic transmission, and restrains neuroinflammation. The efficacy of um-PEA is particularly potent in younger mice, suggesting its potential as an early treatment. These data demonstrate that um-PEA is a novel and effective promising treatment for AD with the potential to be integrated into a multitargeted treatment strategy in combination with other drugs. Um-PEA is already registered for human use. This, in combination with our data, suggests the potential to rapidly proceed to clinical use.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939862>Molecular Targets of Fatty Acid Ethanolamides in Asthma.</a></h2><p>Asthma is a common allergic pathology of the respiratory tract that requires the study of mechanisms underlying it, due to severe forms of the disease, which are refractory to therapy. The review is devoted to the search for molecular targets of fatty acid ethanolamides in asthma, in particular palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), which has been successfully used in the treatment of chronic inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases, in the pathogenesis of which the nervous and immune systems are involved. Recently, the potentially important role of neuro-immune interactions in the development of allergic reactions has been established. Many of the clinical symptoms accompanying allergic airway  are the result of the activation of neurons in the airways, so the attention of researchers is currently focused on neuro-immune interactions, which can play an important role in asthma pathophysiology. A growing number of scientific works confirm that the key molecule in the implementation of these inter-systemic interactions is nerve growth factor (NGF). In addition to its classic role in nervous system physiology, NGF is considered as an important factor associated with the pathogenesis of allergic diseases, particularly asthma, by regulating of mast cell differentiation. In this regard, NGF can be one of the targets of PEA in asthma therapy. PEA has a biological effect on the nervous system, and affects the activation and the degranulation of mast cells.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30759768>Maternal Choline Supplementation Modulates Placental Markers of , Angiogenesis, and Apoptosis in a Mouse Model of Placental Insufficiency.</a></h2><p> (distal-less homeobox 3) haploinsufficiency in mice has been shown to result in restricted fetal growth and placental defects. We previously showed that maternal choline supplementation (4X versus 1X choline) in the +/- mouse increased fetal and placental growth in mid-gestation. The current study sought to test the hypothesis that prenatal choline would modulate indicators of placenta function and development. Pregnant +/- mice consuming 1X (control), 2X, or 4X choline from conception were sacrificed at embryonic (E) days E10.5, E12.5, E15.5, and E18.5, and placentas and embryos were harvested. Data were analyzed separately for each gestational day controlling for litter size, fetal genotype (except for models including only +/- pups), and fetal sex (except when data were stratified by this variable). 4X choline tended to increase ( < 0.1) placental labyrinth size at E10.5 and decrease ( < 0.05) placental apoptosis at E12.5. Choline supplementation decreased ( < 0.05) expression of pro-angiogenic genes  (E10.5, E12.5, and E15.5), and  (E12.5, E15.5); and pro-inflammatory genes  (at E15.5 and 18.5),  (at E12.5) and  (at E15.5) in a fetal sex-dependent manner.

The search was limited to entries published in English before August 2016. Only studies conducted in humans were considered.Publications were included on the basis of relevance.COPD is a common preventable and treatable disease, characterized by persistent and progressive airflow limitation. With improved understanding of COPD pathophysiology, small airways (internal diameter <2 mm), a well-known major site of COPD-associated  and remodeling, have emerged as a potential target for COPD pharmacologic therapies. The ability of extrafine formulations of ICS in combination with LABAs to achieve central and peripheral lung deposition, and the implications of the enhanced efficacy that this may bring, are discussed by examining findings from the development trials plan of the extrafine formulation of beclometasone dipropionate/formoterol fumarate (Foster, Chiesi Farmaceutici, Italy) in patients with COPD.There is an urgent need for improved and reliable techniques for small airways assessment in order to detect early damage, disease progression and response to treatment.

Several studies have shown that wheatgrass extract Triticum aestivum (TA) improves lipid metabolism. In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of GM-T (an ethanolic TA extract) in a murine NAFLD model. Mice were separated into 12 groups (n = 10): two groups of normal diet, choline-deficient diet (CDD) or high-fat diet (HFD) with vehicle, CCD or HFD with silymarin (400 mg kg day ), and CCD or HFD with GM-T (100, 200 or 400 mg kg day ). The study was performed for 8 weeks for the CDD groups and 12 weeks for the HFD groups.In the CDD-fed mice, GM-T improved serum liver enzyme activities and liver  score compared to vehicle. In the HFD-fed mice, GM-T improved blood lipid profiles, liver  score, steatosis score and obesity compared to vehicle.The present study demonstrated that GM-T effectively improved NAFLD in mice via a mechanism that improved insulin resistance and lipid metabolism, suggesting the possibility of a functional dietary supplement to improve liver health, overall metabolic syndrome and obesity. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30996064>Suicide after inhaling a pyrethrins containing insecticide spray.</a></h2><p>Pesticide self-poisoning is rare in developed countries.

Tolerance and dependence lay a heavy burden in clinical pain management settings. An added weight to this dilemma is that effective, safe, and tolerable solution to this problem is still beyond reach. Antidepressants were reported as possible alleviators of opioid tolerance and dependence. One of the increasingly used antidepressant in clinical practice is bupropion given its high safety and tolerability profile.The study was performed on male Balb-c mice weighing 20-30g. Hot plate test was used for assessment of bupropion (5mg/kg, ip) possible analgesic activity and enhancement of morphine acute analgesia (1 and 5mg/kg, sc). Repeated morphine (5mg/kg, sc) administration for 9days developed tolerance and dependence, bupropion (5mg/kg, ip) was concurrently administered to evaluate its potential to modulate these processes. We also biochemically analyzed bupropion effect on these phenomena through modulation of neurotransmitters (glutamate and norepinephrine), inflammatory status (nitric oxide), and pro-antioxidant balance (malondialdehyde and reduced glutathione).Bupropion was devoid of intrinsic analgesic activity and did not enhance morphine acute analgesia. However, bupropion significantly attenuated morphine tolerance and dependence development and abstinence syndrome with corresponding suppression of morphine induced changes in glutamate, norepinephrine, inflammatory status, and prooxidant-antioxidant balance.Bupropion efficacy in attenuation of morphine tolerance and dependence with its high safety and tolerability profile provide an alternative option to conventional agents e.g., ketamine and clonidine to modulate these phenomena.Copyright © 2018 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

The chemoattractant hepoxilin A3, an eicosanoid secreted from intestinal epithelial cells by the apically restricted efflux pump multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2), mediates this neutrophil influx. Information about a possible counterbalance pathway that could signal the lack of or resolution of an apical inflammatory signal, however, has yet to be described. We now report a system with such hallmarks. Specifically, we identify endocannabinoids as the first known endogenous substrates of the apically restricted multidrug resistance transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and reveal a mechanism, which we believe is novel, for endocannabinoid secretion into the intestinal lumen. Knockdown or inhibition of P-gp reduced luminal secretion levels of N-acyl -type endocannabinoids, which correlated with increased neutrophil transmigration in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, loss of CB2, the peripheral cannabinoid receptor, led to increased pathology and neutrophil influx in models of acute intestinal .

We previously reported the expression of angiopoietin Tie2 receptor on human neutrophils and the capacity of both angiopoietins (Ang1 and Ang2) to induce proinflammatory activities, such as synthesis and release of platelet-activating factor, upregulation of β integrin complex (CD11/CD18), and neutrophil chemotaxis. In contrast, only Ang1 but not Ang2 is capable of promoting translational and transcriptional activities in neutrophils. In this article, we addressed whether Ang1 and/or Ang2 could modulate the release of NETs and if they contribute to angiopoietin-mediated proinflammatory activities. We observed that Ang1 and Ang2, alone or combined (10 nM, 3 h), increase NET synthesis and release by ≈2.5-fold as compared with PBS-treated neutrophils. The release of NETs is Tie2 dependent and requires downstream intracellular participation of PI3K, p38, and p42/44 MAPK pathways; reactive oxygen species production; intracellular calcium store depletion; and protein arginine deiminase 4 activation. These isolated NETs induced neutrophil and endothelial cell activation, leading to neutrophil adhesion onto human extracellular matrix and HUVEC and in vitro formation of capillary-like tubes by endothelial cells.

Finally, NE tapering was significantly associated with hypotension during the study period (hazard ratio, 2.221; 95% confidence interval, 1.106-4.460; p = 0.025). The serum copeptin level was lower in patients in whom hypotension developed during tapering of AVP than it was in those without hypotension.Tapering NE rather than AVP may be associated with a higher incidence of hypotension in patients recovering from septic shock who are on concomitant NE and AVP. However, further studies with larger sample sizes are required to better determine the appropriate strategy for vasopressor tapering.ClinicalTrials.gov,  .

However, how exercising in air pollution affects these indices is poorly understood. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of low-intensity and high-intensity cycling with diesel exhaust (DE) exposure on pulmonary function, heart rate variability (HRV), fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), norepinephrine and symptoms.Eighteen males performed 30-min trials of low-intensity or high-intensity cycling (30 and 60% of power at VO) or a resting control condition. For each subject, each trial was performed once breathing filtered air (FA) and once breathing DE (300μg/m of PM, six trials in total). Pulmonary function, FeNO, HRV, norepinephrine and symptoms were measured prior to, immediately post, 1 h and 2 h post-exposure. Data were analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA.Throat and chest symptoms were significantly greater immediately following DE exposure than following FA (p < 0.05). FeNO significantly increased 1 h following high-intensity exercise in DE (21.9 (2.4) vs. 19.3 (2.2) ppb) and FA (22.7 (1.7) vs. 19.9 (1.4)); however, there were no differences between the exposure conditions. All HRV indices significantly decreased following high-intensity exercise (p < 0.05) in DE and FA. The exception to this pattern was LF (nu) and LF/HF ratio, which significantly increased following high-intensity exercise (p < 0.05). Plasma norepinephrine (NE) significantly increased following high-intensity exercise in DE and FA, and this increase was greater than following rest and low-intensity exercise (p < 0.05). DE exposure did not modify any effects of exercise intensity on HRV or norepinephrine.Healthy individuals may not experience greater acute pulmonary and autonomic effects from exercising in DE compared to FA; therefore, it is unclear if such individuals will benefit from reducing vigorous activity on days with high concentrations on particulate matter.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31455615>Novel COX-2 products of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid--conjugates identified in RAW 264.7 macrophages.</a></h2><p>Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) plays a key role in the regulation of  by catalysing the oxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to prostaglandins and hydroperoxides. Next to this, COX-2 can metabolise neutral lipids, including endocannabinoid-like esters and amides. We developed an LC-HRMS based hCOX-2 screening assay to examine its ability to also convert n-3 PUFA-derived N-acylethanolamines. Our assay yields known hCOX-2 derived products from established PUFAs and anandamide. Subsequently, we proved that eicosapentaenoylethanolamide (EPEA), the N-acyl  derivative of eicosapentaenoic acid, is converted into prostaglandin-3 ethanolamide PGE3-EA, and into 11-, 14-, and 18-hydroxy-eicosapentaenoylethanolamide (11-, 14-, and 18-HEPE-EA, respectively). Interestingly, we demonstrated that docosahexaenoylethanolamide (DHEA) is converted by hCOX-2 into the previously unknown metabolites 13- and 16-hydroxy-docosahexaenoyl ethanolamide (13- and 16-HDHEA, respectively). These products were also produced by LPS-stimulated RAW267.4 macrophages incubated with DHEA. No oxygenated DHEA metabolites were detected when the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib was added to the cells, further underlining the role of COX-2 in the formation of the novel hydroxylated products. This work demonstrates for the first time that DHEA and EPEA are converted by COX-2 into previously unknown hydroxylated metabolites and invites future studies towards the biological effects of these metabolites.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30058012>Palmitoylethanolamide prevents neuroinflammation, reduces astrogliosis and preserves recognition and spatial memory following induction of neonatal anoxia-ischemia.</a></h2><p>Neonatal anoxia-ischemia (AI) particularly affects the central nervous system. Despite the many treatments that have been tested, none of them has proven to be completely successful. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and oleoylethanolamide (OEA) are acylethanolamides that do not bind to CB1 or CB2 receptors and thus they do not present cannabinoid activity. These molecules are agonist compounds of peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor alpha (PPARα), which modulates the expression of different genes that are related to glucose and lipid metabolism, , differentiation and proliferation.In the present study, we analyzed the effects that the administration of PEA or OEA, after a neonatal AI event, has over different areas of the hippocampus.To this end, 7-day-old rats were subjected to AI and then treated with vehicle, OEA (2 or 10 mg/kg) or PEA (2 or 10 mg/kg). At 30 days of age, animals were subjected to behavioral tests followed by immunohistochemical studies.Results showed that neonatal AI was associated with decreased locomotion, as well as recognition and spatial memory impairments. Furthermore, these deficits were accompanied with enhanced neuroinflammation and astrogliosis, as well as a decreased PPARα expression. PEA treatment was able to prevent neuroinflammation, reduce astrogliosis and preserve cognitive functions.These results indicate that the acylethanolamide PEA may play an important role in the mechanisms underlying neonatal AI, and it could be a good candidate for further studies regarding neonatal AI treatments.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29683274>Drug Repositioning to Alleviate Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome Caused by Gram-Negative Bacterial Outer Membrane Vesicles.</a></h2><p>Sepsis is characterized by systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) accompanied with infection. Gram-negative bacteria can evoke sepsis by activating the host immune system, such as the release of IL-6 and TNF-α, through their virulence factors. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), nanosized bilayered proteolipids derived from Gram-negative bacteria, harbor various virulence factors and are shown to induce SIRS. Here, drugs are repositioned to alleviate SIRS caused by Gram-negative bacterial OMVs. Using novel OMV-based drug screening systems, a total of 178 commercially available drugs are primarily screened, and a total of 18 repositioned drug candidates are found to effectively block IL-6 and TNF-α production from OMV-stimulated macrophages. After excluding the compounds which are previously known to intervene sepsis or which show cytotoxicity to macrophages, the compounds which show dose-dependency in inhibiting the release of IL-6 and TNF-α by the OMV-stimulated macrophages in vitro and which reduce OMV-induced SIRS in vivo are selected. Salbutamol, a β2 adrenergic receptor agonist, is selected as a novel candidate to alleviate OMV-induced SIRS.

Seventeen wheelchair athletes with a cervical SCI (CSCI, N = 7) and without CSCI (NON-CSCI, N = 10) participated in a wheelchair half-marathon. Blood was taken prior, post and 1 h post-race to determine the concentrations of adrenaline, noradrenaline, extracellular heat shock protein 72 (eHsp72) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). A sit-up tilt test was performed to assess autonomic function at rest. CSCI showed a lower supine ratio of the low and high frequency power of the variability in RR intervals (LF/HF RRI,  = 0.038), total and low frequency power of the systolic blood pressure variability (TP SBP,  < 0.001; LF SBP,  = 0.005) compared to NON-CSCI. Following the race, catecholamine concentrations increased only in NON-CSCI ( < 0.036). The increase in IL-6 post-race was larger in NON-CSCI ( = 0.040). Post-race catecholamine levels explained 60% of the variance in the IL-6 response ( = 0.77,  = 0.040), which was further increased when the resting autonomic function indices were added to the regression model (R > 81%,  < 0.012).

Prejunctional α-adrenergic receptors (αARs) provide negative feedback to norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerves through inhibition of N-type Ca channels. Increased neuronal norepinephrine release in DOCA-salt and obesity-related hypertension occurs through impaired αAR signaling; however, the mechanisms involved are unclear. Mesenteric arteries are resistance arteries that receive sympathetic innervation from the superior mesenteric and celiac ganglia (SMCG). We tested the hypothesis that macrophages impair αAR-mediated inhibition of Ca channels in SMCG neurons from DOCA-salt and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hypertensive rats. Whole cell patch-clamp methods were used to record Ca currents from SMCG neurons maintained in primary culture. We found that DOCA-salt, but not HFD-induced, hypertension caused macrophage accumulation in mesenteric arteries, increased SMCG mRNA levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α, and impaired αAR-mediated inhibition of Ca currents in SMCG neurons. αAR dysfunction did not involve changes in αAR expression, desensitization, or downstream signaling factors. Oxidative stress impaired αAR-mediated inhibition of Ca currents in SMCG neurons and resulted in receptor internalization in human embryonic kidney-293T cells. Systemic clodronate-induced macrophage depletion preserved αAR function and lowered blood pressure in DOCA-salt rats. HFD caused hypertension without obesity in Sprague-Dawley rats and hypertension with obesity in Dahl salt-sensitive rats. HFD-induced hypertension was not associated with  in SMCG and mesenteric arteries or αAR dysfunction in SMCG neurons. These results suggest that macrophage-mediated αAR dysfunction in the mesenteric circulation may only be relevant to mineralocorticoid-salt excess. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Here, we identify a contribution of macrophages to hypertension development through impaired α-adrenergic receptor (αAR)-mediated inhibition of sympathetic nerve terminal Ca channels in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. Impaired αAR function may involve oxidative stress-induced receptor internalization. αAR dysfunction may be unique to mineralocorticoid-salt excess, as it does not occur in obesity-related hypertension.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30172410>Methionine and choline supply during the peripartal period alter polymorphonuclear leukocyte immune response and immunometabolic gene expression in Holstein cows.</a></h2><p>Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) are the first responders upon pathogen invasion and hence play an important role in inflammatory and immune responses. Rumen-protected methionine (MET) and choline (CHOL) during the peripartal period affect the immune response and inflammatory status in dairy cows to different extents. We aimed to examine the effect of MET and CHOL supply on expression of genes regulating key PMNL functions and associations with whole-blood immune challenge. Thirty multiparous Holstein cows from a larger cohort randomly assigned from -21 to 30 d relative to parturition to a basal control (CON) diet, CON plus MET at a rate of 0.08% of dry matter, or CON plus CHOL at 60 g/d were used. Blood was sampled at -10, 7, and 30 d relative to parturition for inflammatory biomarker analyses and PMNL isolation. Neutrophil and monocyte phagocytosis and oxidative burst in vitro were assessed in whole blood at 1, 7, and 28 d. Although neutrophil and monocyte phagocytosis did not differ, oxidative burst in neutrophils and monocytes was greater in MET-supplemented cows relative to CON cows. Compared with CON, PMNL adhesion and migration-related genes (ITGAM, ITGB2, ITGA4) were downregulated in response to MET and CHOL. Expression of CADM1 and SELL was also lower in MET-supplemented cows compared with CON cows but not in CHOL cows. In contrast, compared with CON cows, the expression of ICAM1 was lower in CHOL but not MET cows. Similar to adhesion and migration-related genes, cows receiving MET- or CHOL-supplemented diets had lower expression of -related genes (IL1β, IL10RA, NFKB1, STAT3, TLR2). However, expression of IRAK1 and TLR4 was lower in MET- but not CHOL-supplemented cows. Plasma taurine concentration was greater in MET cows compared with CHOL and CON cows, suggesting a better redox status in plasma. In agreement with plasma taurine, oxidative stress-related genes (CBS, CTH, GPX1, GSS, SOD2) in PMNL were lower in response to MET and to CHOL supply. Overall, immunometabolic gene expression profile and blood biomarker analyses suggest an overall better redox status in PMNL during the transition period in response to MET and CHOL supply. These adaptations in PMNL might be beneficial for mounting a better bactericidal response upon challenge.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

IL-6 plays a crucial role in therapies for neuronal  and cognitive dysfunction. Remifentanil, an ultra-short-acting opioid, controls inflammatory reactions in the periphery, but not in the brain. Therefore, the anti-inflammatory effects of remifentanil in neuronal tissue and the involvement of cAMP in these effects were investigated in the present study.Mice were divided into 4 groups: control, remifentanil, LPS, and LPS + remifentanil. Brain levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA, and serum levels of corticosterone, catecholamine and IL-6 were measured in the 4 groups. The co-localization of IL-6 and astrocytes in the mouse brain after the LPS injection was validated by immunostaining. LPS and/or remifentanil-induced changes in intracellular cAMP levels in cultured glial cells were measured, and the effects of cAMP on LPS-induced IL-6 mRNA expression levels were evaluated.Remifentanil suppressed increase in IL-6 mRNA levels in the mouse brain, and also inhibited the responses of plasma IL-6, corticosterone, and noradrenaline in an inflammatory state. In the hypothalamus, IL-6 was localized in the median eminence, at which GFAP immunoreactivity was specifically detected.

In the isoprenaline group (G4), the rats were injected with isoprenaline (200 mg/kg body weight) and the control group (G5) received a standard diet (Without isoprenaline). Then, isoproterenol solution was used for induction of myocardial infarction. At the end, the expression of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein was detected using immunohistochemical analysis and kidney tissues were assessed via histopathological analysis. In addition, serum level of TNF-α and creatinine level were measured via ELISA test and colorimetric methods, respectively.The results of our study indicate that isoproterenol-induced renal histopathological injury without changing creatinine level. Betaine has protective effects against renal injuries induced by isoprenaline and the expression of nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) protein showed no significant difference in all groups.

The purpose of this study was to elucidate whether administration of a β2 adrenergic agonist, formoterol, was able to prevent the acute effects of sepsis induced by liposaccharide (LPS) injection on rat gastrocnemius muscle and to evaluate the possible roles of corticosterone, IGF-I, miR-23a, and miR-29b. For this purpose, male Wistar rats were injected with LPS and/or formoterol. Formoterol treatment decreased LPS-induced increase in serum corticosterone, TNFα upregulation, and NF-κB(p65) and Forkhead box protein O1 activation in the gastrocnemius. Atrogin-1, muscle RING-finger protein-1, microtubule-associated protein-1 light chain 3b (LC3b), and the lipidation of LC3b-I to LC3b-II were increased by LPS, and formoterol blocked these effects. Serum IGF-I and its mRNA levels in the gastrocnemius were decreased, whereas mecano growth factor and IGF binding protein 3 mRNA levels were increased in the rats injected with LPS but not in the rats that received LPS and formoterol. Similarly, LPS decreased Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin phosphorylation, and formoterol blocked these decreases. Finally, miR-29b expression in the gastrocnemius was upregulated by endotoxin injection, whereas miR-23a was not significantly different. Formoterol treatment did not significantly modify LPS-induced increase in muscle miR-29b. Furthermore, in control rats formoterol increased the expression of this miRNA. We conclude that formoterol decreases endotoxin-induced  and proteolysis in rat skeletal muscle.

By improving ischemiareperfusion, ranolazine is also observed to have protective effects on myocardial ischemic injury in animal models. It is noteworthy to find interventions that can decrease adverse effects of this drug and thereby increase its clinical application.In this report, we used a rat model of chronic ischemic heart failure (CHF) to examine if vagal stimulation can strengthen the effects of ranolazine on worsened cardiac function in CHF. Plasma norepinephrine (NE) and brain natriuretic peptide [BNP, termed B-type natriuretic peptide-45 (BNP-45) in rats] are regulated by sympathetic nerve activity. Because NE and BNP are considered as neurohormones indicating heart failure progression, we also determined the levels of plasma NE and BNP-45 besides cardiac function. Moreover, we examined the role of sympathetic pro-inflammatory cytokines in engagement of vagal activation.Our data show that ranolazine intraperitoneally improved the impaired left ventricular function, and attenuated the exaggerated NE/BNP-45 and cytokines (such as IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) after development of CHF. Particularly, our results show that vagal activation largely amplified the effects of ranolazine on cardiac function in CHF.Our data indicate that: 1) ranolazine alleviates sympathetic nerve activity thereby leading to improvement of the worsened cardiac function in CHF; and 2) vagal stimulation augments the effect of ranolazine. Accordingly, results of this study have implications for the role played by a combination of vagal stimulation and ranolazine in improving cardiac function in CHF.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30572792>Supplemental feeding of phospholipid-enriched alkyl phospholipid from krill relieves spontaneous atopic dermatitis and strengthens skin intercellular lipid barriers in NC/Nga mice.</a></h2><p>Plasmalogen (Pls) is a glycerophospholipid derived from alkyl phospholipid (Alk) with antioxidant functions in vivo.

The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of Amaranthus tricolor on isoproterenol-induced oxidative stress, fibrosis, and myocardial damage in ovariectomized rats. Ovariectomy surgery was conducted to remove both ovaries from the rats. After recovery, rats were administered with ISO subcutaneously (50 mg/kg) twice a week and were treated with ethanolic extracts of A. tricolor. This investigation showed that the level of oxidative stress markers was significantly increased while the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity decreased in ISO administered ovariectomized rats. A. tricolor extract and atenolol treatment prevented the rise of malondialdehyde, nitric oxide and advanced protein oxidation product. Moreover, elevated activities of AST, ALT, and CK-MB enzymes were also lowered by both atenolol and A. tricolor treatment. Increased uric acid and creatinine levels were also normalized by atenolol, and A. Tricolor treatment in ISO administered ovariectomized rats. ISO-induced ovariectomized rats also showed massive inflammatory cell infiltration, fibrosis and iron deposition in heart compared to sham rats. Atenolol and A. tricolor treatment prevented the inflammatory cells infiltration, fibrosis, and iron deposition. These results suggest that A. tricolor treatment may protect against ISO administered myocardial infarction in ovariectomized rats probably by preventing , oxidative stress, and fibrosis.

The dietary supplement palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) exerts anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. Here, we investigated the effect of prophylactic PEA on the early immune response, clinical course, and survival of old mice after intracerebral  K1 infection. Nineteen-month-old wild type mice were treated intraperitoneally with two doses of either 0.1 mg PEA/kg in 250 μl vehicle solution ( = 19) or with 250 μl vehicle solution only as controls ( = 19), 12 h and 30 min prior to intracerebral  K1 infection. The intraperitoneal route was chosen to reduce distress in mice and to ensure exact dosing. Survival time, bacterial loads in cerebellum, blood, spleen, liver, and microglia counts and activation scores in the brain were evaluated. We measured the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, MIP-1α, and CXCL1 in cerebellum and spleen, as well as of bioactive lipids in serum in PEA- and vehicle-treated animals 24 h after infection. In the absence of antibiotic therapy, the median survival time of PEA-pre-treated infected mice was prolonged by 18 h compared to mice of the vehicle-pre-treated infected group ( = 0.031). PEA prophylaxis delayed the onset of clinical symptoms ( = 0.037). This protective effect was associated with lower bacterial loads in the spleen, liver, and blood compared to those of vehicle-injected animals ( ≤ 0.037). PEA-pre-treated animals showed diminished levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in spleen 24 h after infection, as well as reduced serum concentrations of arachidonic acid and of one of its metabolites, 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. In the brain, prophylactic PEA tended to reduce bacterial titers and attenuated microglial activation in aged infected animals ( = 0.042). Our findings suggest that prophylactic PEA can counteract infection associated detrimental responses in old animals. Accordingly, PEA treatment slowed the onset of infection symptoms and prolonged the survival of old infected mice. In a clinical setting, prophylactic administration of PEA might extend the potential therapeutic window where antibiotic therapy can be initiated to rescue elderly patients.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29407194>Alpha 1 adrenergic receptor-mediated inflammatory responses in human testicular peritubular cells.</a></h2><p>Stress activates the sympathetic nervous system and is linked to impaired fertility in man. We hypothesized that catecholamines by acting on testicular cells have a role in these events, possibly by fostering an inflammatory environment. The cells of the wall of seminiferous tubules, human testicular peritubular cells (HTPCs), express adrenergic receptors (ADRs) α1B, α1D, β1 and β2. A selective α1-ADR agonist, phenylephrine, increased intracellular Ca-levels in cultured HTPCs and induced COX-2, IL-6 and MCP-1 mRNA expression without affecting IL-1β mRNA. These changes were paralleled by a significant increase in the secretion of IL-6 and MCP-1. Epinephrine was also effective, but salbutamol, a selective β2-ADR agonist was not. Our results suggest that stress-associated elevation of catecholamines may be able to promote inflammatory events by targeting peritubular cells in the human testis. Blockage of α1-ADRs may therefore be a novel way to interfere with stress-related impairment of male reproductive functions.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this study was to assess the contribution of the anti-inflammatory effects of R1 to the amelioration of isoproterenol (ISO)-induced hypertrophied hearts of atherosclerosis-prone mice. As a model of in vivo atherosclerosis, ApoE C57BL/6 J mice were fed a high-cholesterol diet for 12 weeks. Intraperitoneal injection of R1 (1-50 mg/kg/day) or saline for 7 days was followed by continuous infusion with ISO (25 mg/kg/day) for 14 days to experimentally induce heart hypertrophy. We assessed fibrosis, myocardial function, and protein or mRNA levels of several inflammatory mediators. ISO infusion induced cardiac ventricular contractile and diastolic dysfunction, which was consistent with massive replacement fibrosis and apoptosis in hypertrophied hearts. However, R1 attenuated ISO-induced hypertrophy. R1 suppressed the expression of CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) and prevented Ly6C proinflammatory monocytes and the subsequent myocardial inflammatory responses and expression of various cell-derived factors around the cardiac wound. R1-supressed cardiac dysfunction, atherosclerotic lesions, and inflammatory cytokine accumulation in the myocardium can be partially inhibited by CCR2 translation in bone marrow cells. R1 is a novel cardioprotective agent that can attenuate adverse cardiac dysfunction, hypertrophy, and associated disorders, such as fibrosis. The mechanisms are closely correlated with CCR2, which plays a crucial role in the recruitment of proinflammatory monocytes to sites of inflamed hypertrophic heart tissues.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The present study explored and compared the effects of first-line vs. second-line infusion of TP or sole norepinephrine regarding organ function, fluid and norepinephrine requirements and survival in fulminant ovine septic shock. Peritoneal sepsis was induced in 23 ewes after laparotomy and faecal withdrawal from the caecum.

The experimental group was treated with atomization inhalation of terbutaline, after 5 minutes interval, nebulized inhalation of budesonide was performed. The control group was treated with atomized inhalation of mixed liquid as terbutaline and budesonide. After treatment, the cough scores of the two groups decreased, and the dyspnea score improved significantly compared with that before treatment (P<0.05).After treatment, the levels of IL-6, BNP and CRP were decreased in the two groups.

However, it is not known whether the nervous system can regulate the production of inflammatory myeloid cells from hematopoietic progenitor cells in disease conditions. Myeloid cell numbers in diabetic patients were strongly correlated with plasma concentrations of norepinephrine, suggesting the role of sympathetic neuronal activation in myeloid cell production. The spleens of diabetic patients and mice contained higher numbers of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-expressing leukocytes that produced catecholamines. Granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMPs) expressed the β adrenergic receptor, a target of catecholamines. Ablation of splenic sympathetic neuronal signaling using surgical, chemical, and genetic approaches diminished GMP proliferation and myeloid cell development. Finally, mice lacking TH-producing leukocytes had reduced GMP proliferation, resulting in diminished myelopoiesis. Taken together, our study demonstrates that catecholamines produced by leukocytes and sympathetic nerve termini promote GMP proliferation and myeloid cell development.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa) calyces are enriched with natural polyphenols known for antioxidant and anti-hypertensive effects, yet its effects on early cardiac remodelling in post myocardial infarction (MI) setting are still unclear. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the actions of roselle extract on cardiac remodelling in rat model of MI. Male Wistar rats (200-300 g) were randomly allotted into three groups: Control, MI, and MI + Roselle. MI was induced with isoprenaline (ISO) (85 mg/kg, s.c) for two consecutive days followed by roselle treatment (100 mg/kg, orally) for 7 days. Isoprenaline administration showed changes in heart weight to body weight (HW/BW) ratio. MI was especially evident by the elevated cardiac injury marker, troponin-T, and histological observation. Upregulation of plasma levels and cardiac gene expression levels of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 was seen in MI rats. A relatively high percentage of fibrosis was observed in rat heart tissues with over-expression of collagen (Col)-1 and Col-3 genes following isoprenaline-induced MI. On top of that, cardiomyocyte areas were larger in heart tissues of MI rats with upregulation of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) gene expression, indicating cardiac hypertrophy. Interestingly, roselle supplementation attenuated elevation of plasma troponin-T, IL-6, IL10, and gene expression level of IL-10. Furthermore, reduction of cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy were observed. In conclusion, roselle treatment was able to limit early cardiac remodelling in MI rat model by alleviating , fibrosis, and hypertrophy; hence, the potential application of roselle in early adjunctive treatment to prevent heart failure.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29940509>Noradrenaline induces peripheral antinociception by endogenous opioid release.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate this involvement in not inflammatory model of pain and which opioid receptor subtype mediates noradrenaline-induced peripheral antinociception.

However,  can induce various plastic changes in the central and peripheral noradrenergic system that, upon interaction with the immune system, may contribute, in part, to peripheral antinociception.Hyperalgesia was induced by intraplantar injection of prostaglandin E (PGE, 2μg) into the plantar surface of the right hind paw and the paw pressure test to evaluated the hyperalgesia was used. Noradrenaline (NA) was administered locally into right hind paw of Wistar rat (160-200g) alone and after either agents, α-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine, α-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin, β-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol, μ-opioid antagonist clocinnamox, δ-opioid antagonist naltrindole and κ-opioid antagonist nor-binaltorfimina. In addition, the enkephalinase inhibitor bestatin was administered prior to NA low dose.Intraplantar injection of NA induced peripheral antinociception against hyperalgesia induced by PGE. This effect was reversed, in dose dependent manner, by intraplantar injection of yohimbine, prazosin, propranolol, clocinnamox and naltrindole. However, injection of nor-binaltorfimina did not alter antinociception of NA after PGE hyperalgesia.

We, therefore, aimed to profile the distribution of several lipids (e.g., phosphatidyl-choline/, PC/PE), including n-3-PUFA-carrying lipids (esterified in phospholipids), in the OVLT during systemic lipopolysaccharide(LPS)-induced . We injected wild type and endogenously n-3-PUFA producing fat-1 transgenic mice with LPS (i.p., 2.5 mg/kg) or PBS. Brain samples were analyzed using immunohistochemistry and high-resolution atmospheric-pressure scanning microprobe matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization orbital trapping mass spectrometry imaging (AP-SMALDI-MSI) for spatial resolution of lipids. Depending on genotype and treatment, several distinct distribution patterns were observed for lipids [e.g., lyso(L)PC (16:0)/(18:0)] proposed to be involved in . The distribution patterns ranged from being homogeneously disseminated [LPC (18:1)], absent/reduced signaling within the OVLT relative to adjacent preoptic tissue [PE (38:6)], either treatment- and genotype-dependent or independent low signal intensities [LPC (18:0)], treatment- and genotype-dependent [PC 38:6)] or independent accumulation in the OVLT [PC (38:7)], and accumulation in commissures, e.g., nerve fibers like the optic nerve [LPE (18:1)]. Overall, screening of lipid distribution patterns revealed distinct -induced changes in the OVLT, highlighting the prominent role of lipid metabolism in brain . Moreover, known and novel candidates for brain  and immune-to-brain communication were detected specifically within this pivotal brain structure, a window between the periphery and the brain.

For this purpose, the study was carried out on Wistar rats and three doses of adrenaline were used: 0.75 mg/kg, 1.5 mg/kg, and 3 mg/kg body weight. To achieve these aims, we investigated the effects of adrenaline on catalase (CAT), Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), nitrite (NO-), carbonyl groups (PCC), and nitrotyrosine (3-NT). Total activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), its relative distribution (LDH-LDH) activity, level of acute phase proteins (APPs), and genotoxic effect were also evaluated. The obtained results revealed that all doses of adrenaline induced a significant rise in CAT activity, MDA level, PCC, NO , and 3-NT and a significant decrease in SOD activity compared to control. Adrenaline exerted an increase in total activity of LDH, LDH, and LDH isoenzymes. Further study showed that adrenaline significantly decreased serum albumin level and albumin-globulin ratio, while the level of APPs ( -acid glycoprotein and haptoglobulin) is increased. The micronucleus test revealed a genotoxic effect of adrenaline at higher concentrations (1.5 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg body weight) compared to untreated rats. It can be concluded that adrenaline exerts oxidative and nitrative stress in rats, increased damage to lipids and proteins, and damage of cardiomyocytes and cytogenetic damage. Obtained results may contribute to better understanding of the toxicity of adrenaline with aims to preventing its harmful effects.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30266645>Lycium barbarum polysaccharides improve hepatic injury through NFkappa-B and NLRP3/6 pathways in a methionine choline deficient diet steatohepatitis mouse model.</a></h2><p>Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBP) are major bioactive constituents of wolfberry which possess several pharmacological effects such as antioxidant and immunomodulatory activities. We aimed to evaluate how LBP attenuated the hepatic injury in a non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) methionine-choline deficient (MCD) mouse model. NASH was induced in C57BL/6N mice by feeding with MCD diet for 6 weeks. During the experiments, 1 mg/kg LBP was intragastrically fed on a daily basis with or without MCD diet lasting from the 4th to 6th week. Control and vehicle-control (LBP + PBS) were fed with a regular animal chow. LBP significantly ameliorated NASH-induced injuries, including the increase of serum ALT and AST levels, hepatic oxidative stress, fibrosis, , and apoptosis. The hepatoprotective effects of LBP were accompanied by the attenuation of thioredoxin interacting protein, nod-like receptor protein 3/6 (NLRP3/6) and reduced NF-κB (nuclear factor-kappa B) activity. Vehicle LBP fed mice showed no adverse effect on the liver. In conclusion, the suppression of the NLRP3/6 inflammasome pathway and NF-κB activation may partly contribute to the reduction of the hepatic injury during the progression of NASH by therapeutic LBP treatment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Its signaling activity is terminated through degradation by -acylethanolamine acid amidase (NAAA), a cysteine hydrolase expressed at high levels in immune cells. Pharmacological inhibitors of NAAA activity exert profound analgesic and antiinflammatory effects in rodent models, pointing to this protein as a potential target for therapeutic drug discovery. To facilitate these efforts and to better understand the molecular mechanism of action of NAAA, we determined crystal structures of this enzyme in various activation states and in complex with several ligands, including both a covalent and a reversible inhibitor. Self-proteolysis exposes the otherwise buried active site of NAAA to allow catalysis. Formation of a stable substrate- or inhibitor-binding site appears to be conformationally coupled to the interaction of a pair of hydrophobic helices in the enzyme with lipid membranes, resulting in the creation of a linear hydrophobic cavity near the active site that accommodates the ligand's acyl chain.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30217533>Platelets mediate protective neuroinflammation and promote neuronal plasticity at the site of neuronal injury.</a></h2><p>It is generally accepted that  within the CNS contributes to neurodegeneration after traumatic brain injury (TBI), but it is not clear how  is initiated in the absence of infection and whether this neuroinflammation is predominantly beneficial or detrimental.

The interaction of platelets with NLR stimulated neurite growth, increased the number of PSD95-positive dendritic spines, and intensified neuronal activity.

Increased levels of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a metabolite derived from choline and L-carnitine, correlates with CVD and T2DM. However, the precise role of TMAO and its precursors in MetS remains unclear. We tested the hypothesis that choline, L-carnitine and TMAO in MetS patients without CVD or T2DM would be altered and correlate with inflammatory markers. Materials and methods This was an exploratory study of 30 patients with nascent MetS (without CVD or T2DM) and 20 matched controls. MetS was defined by the Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. TMAO and its precursors were evaluated from each patient's frozen early morning urine samples and quantified using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS). These amines were correlated with a detailed repertoire of biomarkers of  and adipokines. Results L-carnitine was significantly increased (p = 0.0002) compared to controls. There was a trend for a significant increase in TMAO levels (p = 0.08). Choline was not significantly altered in MetS. L-carnitine correlated significantly with soluble tumor necrosis factor 1 (sTNFR1) and leptin, and inversely to adiponectin. TMAO correlated with IL-6, endotoxin and chemerin. Neither choline, nor L-carnitine significantly correlated with TMAO. Conclusion L-carnitine is directly correlated with markers of  in nascent MetS.

The role of ALIAmides in the control of inflammatory processes has recently gained much attention and prompted the use of these molecules or their analogs, and the pharmacologic manipulation of their endogenous levels, as plausible therapeutic strategies in the treatment of several chronic inflammatory conditions. Since chronic  is mainly driven by cells of adaptive immunity, particularly T lymphocytes, we aimed at investigating whether such bioactive lipids could directly modulate T-cell responses. We found that OEA, PEA, and eicosatrienoyl ethanolamide (ETEA) could directly inhibit both T-cell responses by reducing their production of TNF-α and IFN-γ from CD8 T cells and TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-17 from CD4 T cells. Furthermore, neither SEA nor docosatrienoyl ethanolamide (DTEA) could affect cytokine production from both T cell subsets. Interestingly, unlike OEA and ETEA, PEA was also able to enhance de novo generation of forkhead box P3 (FoxP3)-expressing regulatory T cells from CD4-naive T cells.

It is well known that the sympathetic nervous system is activated in patients with heart failure, and this change is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Sympathetic activation increases the levels of various catecholamines, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, but the contribution of these catecholamines to cellular senescence associated with heart failure remains to be determined.

The main objective of this study was to identify and characterize dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) in the heart associated with cardiotoxicity. Wistar rats were dosed once with either isoproterenol (1.5 mg/kg, i.p), allylamine (100 mg/kg, p.o.) or the respective vehicle controls. Heart tissue was collected at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h post-drug administration and used for histopathological assessment, miRNA profiling, immunohistochemical analysis and in situ hybridization. Multiplex analysis of 68 miRNAs in the heart revealed a significant upregulation of several miRNAs (miR-19a-3p, miR-142-3p, miR-155-5p, miR-208b-3p, miR-21-5p) after isoproterenol and one miRNA (miR-21-5p) after allylamine administration. Localization of miR-21-5p was specific to inflammatory cell infiltrates in the heart after both treatments. Immunohistochemical analysis of Stat3, a known miR-21-5p regulator, also confirmed its upregulation in cardiomyocytes and inflammatory cell infiltrates.

Moreover, augmentation in pro-inflammatory markers was also found. The same group also displayed marked changes in histopathology and erythrocyte (RBCs) morphology. SYD treated groups showed diminished levels of serum markers enzymes, lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl (PC) with increment in antioxidant defense in cardiac tissues of ISO administered rats. Our findings also revealed the modulatory effect of SYD on membrane bound ATPases, showing that SYD significantly improved the ISO induced changes in membrane fluidity. Furthermore, decline in infarct size, alleviation of structural RBC damage and improved myocardial histopathological outcome were observed in treated groups.

Rats that received an amyloid-β(25-35) infusion into the CA1 region of the hippocampus were fed dextrin (AD-CON), 0.1% luteolin (AD-Lut), 0.2% l-theanine (AD-Thea), or both 0.05% luteolin and 0.1% l-theanine (AD-LuTh) in conjunction with a high-fat diet over 8 weeks. AD-LuTh improved memory function, as determined by water maze and passive avoidance tests, by potentiating the hippocampal insulin signaling and reducing : Luteolin mainly potentiated insulin signaling via the pAkt➔pGSK➔pTau pathway, and l-theanine primarily reduced tumor necrosis factor-α. In the metabolomics analysis of the hippocampus lysates, the concentration of proline, phenylpyruvic acid, and normetanephrine decreased in the AD-LuTh compared to AD-CON. Norepinephrine contents were lower in the AD-CON than non-AD rats with a high fat diet with 0.2% dextrin, whereas AD-Thea and AD-LuTh inhibited the decrease. Both the AD-Lut and AD-LuTh increased glucose infusion rates and decreased hepatic glucose output under basal and hyperinsulinemic conditions, indicating improved whole-body and hepatic insulin sensitivity. Disturbances in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion during hyperglycemic clamp were most effectively corrected by the AD-Lut and AD-LuTh treatments. In conclusion, the hypothesis of the study was accepted. The combination of luteolin and l-theanine prevented Alzheimer disease-like symptom, possibly by improving hippocampal insulin signaling, norepinephrine metabolisms, and decreasing neuroinflammation.

In this study, we established inflammatory model in primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) from C57BL/6J mice and β-arrestin2 knockout (β-arrestin2) mice in vitro. In vivo study by LPS intraperitoneally (i.p.) in C57BL/6J mice was carried out to ascertain its roles in systemic . We found that Salmeterol (10 M-10 M) prevented the cleavage of caspase-1 and the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, reduced the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in vitro. Blockade of adenosine3',5'cyclic monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway with cAMP or PKA inhibitors inhibited anti-inflammatory effects of Salmeterol only at 10 M. Depletion of β-arrestin2 compromised the inhibitory effects of Salmeterol at both 10 M and 10 M. Salmeterol increased the interaction of β-arrestin2 and NLRP3. In vivo study showed that Salmeterol decreased the serum concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α, blocked cleavage of caspase-1 and release of IL-1β in BMDM. These findings imply that Salmeterol at low concentrations (10 M-10 M) shows anti-inflammatory effect via inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome. The underlying mechanisms is dosage-dependent: Salmeterol at 10 M shows anti-inflammatory effects through β-arrestin2 pathway, and 10 M Salmeterol inhibits  via both classical G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)/cAMP pathway and β-arrestin2 pathway. These results provide new ideas for the future treatment of systemic  and other inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

There is however only limited information of the regional localization of drug retention following inhalation. The aim of this study was to investigate the regional and histological localization of salmeterol retention in the lungs after inhalation and to compare it to systemic administration. Lung distribution of salmeterol delivered to rats via nebulization or intravenous (IV) injection was analyzed with high-resolution mass spectrometry imaging (MSI). Salmeterol was widely distributed in the entire section at 5 min after inhalation, by 15 min it was preferentially retained in bronchial tissue. Via a novel dual-isotope study, where salmeterol was delivered via inhalation and d-salmeterol via IV to the same rat, could the effective gain in drug concentration associated with inhaled delivery relative to IV, expressed as a site-specific lung targeting factor, was 5-, 31-, and 45-fold for the alveolar region, bronchial sub-epithelium and epithelium, respectively. We anticipate that this MSI-based framework for quantifying regional and histological lung targeting by inhalation will accelerate discovery and development of local and more precise treatments of respiratory disease.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30200739>[Effects of sleep deprivation induced blood stasis syndrome on platelet activation in rats].</a></h2><p>Blood stasis syndrome is the pre-state of thrombotic disease. The model of blood stasis syndrome in rats was induced by sleep deprivation to study on effects of blood stasis syndrome on platelet activation. The weight, the color of tongue and hemorheology for the blood stasis syndrome of Chinese medicine were measured after modeling. The release of platelet granules and platelet activation factors in plasma were detected by ELISA kit related indicators to provide experimental basis for platelet function evaluation and related drug effects in syndrome research. The results showed that the weight of the model group rats was significantly lower than that of the normal group (<0.01). The tongue showed a dark purple blood stasis pattern, and the R, G and B values of the tongue surface in model group were significantly lower than those of the normal group (<0.01). The hemorheological parameters including high shear, middle shear and low shear viscosity in whole blood were significantly higher than those in the normal group (<0.01). But plasma viscosity did not change significantly. The release levels of platelet α particles (GMP-140, -TG, PF4) and dense particles (ADP, 5-HT) were significantly higher than those in the normal group (<0.01). The levels of TXB₂ and 6-keto-PGF₁α in plasma were significantly higher than those in the normal group (<0.01). The ratios of TXB₂ and 6-keto-PGF₂α were also significantly higher than those in the normal group (<0.01). The levels of PAF in plasma in model group were significantly higher than those in the normal group (<0.01).

Periostin stimulates mature cardiomyocytes to reenter the cell cycle. The molecular mechanism behind such stimulation remains to be explored. A DNA microarray technology constituting 30,429 gene-level probe sets was utilized to investigate effects of recombinant murine periostin peptide on the gene expression pattern in a rat model of isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial injury. The experiment was performed on 84 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats in four groups ( n = 21): (1) control group, (2) only periostin applied group, (3) ISO cardiotoxicity group, and (4) ISO + periostin group. The experiment was continued for 28 days, and rats were killed on days 1, 7, and 28 ( n = 7). Microarray analyses revealed that periostin significantly altered the expression of at least ±2-fold of 2474 genes in the ISO + periostin group compared to the ISO cardiotoxicity group of which 521 genes altered out of 30,429 gene-level probe sets. Ingenuity pathway analysis indicated that multiple pathway networks were affected by periostin, with predominant changes occurring in the expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, oxidative stress, fatty acid metabolism, and TNF-α NF-κB signaling pathways.

Knowledge of its biodistribution pattern is essential to recognise physiological variants. The aim of this study was to describe the physiologic distribution of F-choline and pitfalls in patients with breast cancer. Methods Twenty-one consecutive patients with breast cancer (10 premenopausal and 11 postmenopausal women; mean age, 52.82 ± 10.71 years) underwent F-choline positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) for staging. Whole-body PET/CT was acquired after 40 minutes of F-choline uptake. Acquired PET images were measured semiquantitatively. Results All patients showed pitfalls unrelated to breast cancer. These findings were predominantly caused by physiological glandular uptake in the liver, spleen, pancreas, bowels, axial skeleton (85%-100%),  and benign changes (4.76%), appendicular skeleton (4.76%-19.049%), and site contamination (61.9%). In <1%, a concomitant metastatic neoplasm was found. The breast showed higher physiological uptake in premenopausal compared with postmenopausal woman (F-choline maximum standardised uptake values [g/dL] of the right breast = 2.04 ± 0.404 vs 1.59 ± 0.97 and left breast = 2.00 ± 0.56 vs 1.93 ± 1.28, respectively).

It has received great interest due to its protective role in many disorders such as heart diseases and neurological disorders.We hypothesized that blueberry leaf extract might have a protective effect against cardiac hypertrophy via suppressing oxidative stress,  and fibrosis.Blueberry leaf nutraceutical extract was administered orally to male albino rats at three different doses (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg/day of the extract, equivalent to 3.4, 6.8 and 13.6 mg of chlorogenic acid, respectively) once daily for 28 consecutive days against a dose of isoprenaline (ISO) (5 mg/kg) for 14 days.The results indicated that isoprenaline induced significant myocardial damage, characterized by conduction abnormalities, increased heart-to-body weight ratio, increased serum CKMB, AST, c-TnI and LDH. Pretreatment with blueberry extract at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 6.8 mg chlorogenic acid) protected against ISO-induced ECG changes, leakage of cardiac enzymes and histopathological changes. Also, ISO caused significant glutathione depletion, lipid peroxidation and reduction in activities of antioxidant catalase enzyme. These effects were prevented by pretreatment with blueberry extract. Additionally, ISO elicited inflammatory effects by increasing the expression of NF-κB, COX-2, TNF-α and IL-6 while pretreatment with blueberry extract significantly inhibited these inflammatory responses. Furthermore, ISO induced fibrosis by increasing the level of TGF-β while pretreatment with blueberry extract significantly reduced it.These findings indicate that blueberry leaf extract possessed a potent protective effect against ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy via suppressing oxidative stress,  and fibrosis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

Interestingly, decreased serum concentrations of  plasmalogens (PlsEtn) have been reported in PD patients.  plasmalogens play a role in vesicular fusion and release during neurotransmission, and store neuroprotective polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and are strong anti-oxidants, highlighting areas of potential therapeutic interest. Docosahexaenoic acid is known to play important roles in both the central nervous and peripheral systems, in addition to acting as a precursor of several molecules that regulate the resolution of . The present study investigated the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties of the DHA-containing PlsEtn precursor, PPI-1011, in the intestine of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated mice. Treatment with PPI-1011 prevented the MPTP-induced decrease in PlsEtn levels. In addition it prevented the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression and reduced the infiltration of macrophages in the myenteric plexus of MPTP-treated mice. The protective effects of PPI-1011 were observed regardless of whether it was administered pre- or post- MPTP treatment.

It has the ability to hydrolyze various oxidized low density lipoproteins (LDL) and generates potent pro-inflammatory signaling molecules. Both physiological and non-physiological oxidants have been reported to inhibit Lp-PLA activity. The mechanism of the enzyme inhibition due to oxidation of surface exposed Met117 at the structural level is not clearly understood. In the present work, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and Essential dynamics (ED) has been used in tandem with molecular docking approach to understand the structural alteration in Lp-PLA upon Met117 oxidation. Further, the binding of substrate, Platelet-activating factor (PAF) with the wild type and oxidized form have also been investigated. Our results showed that Met117 oxidation caused enhanced flexibility and decreased compactness in oxidized state.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate whether experimental infection by Brucella ovis alters the cholinergic activity in pro- or anti-inflammatory responses to the disease. For the study 48 mice were used, 24 infected by B. ovis and 24 non-infected. We collected samples of whole blood on days 7, 15, 30 and 60 post-infection (PI) by B. ovis. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the blood increased on days 15 and 60 PI (P < 0.05). Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity in serum increased on days 7 and 60 PI (P < 0.05). An increase in serum free radical levels occurred on days 7, 15 and 60 PI (P < 0.05), and consequently superoxide dismutase activity increased on day 15 PI (P < 0.05). A reduction in catalase activity occurred when the infection became chronic (60 PI). The increase in AChE and BChE characterized a pro-inflammatory response, since these enzymes regulate levels of acetylcholine (ACh) and butyrylcholine (BuSCh), molecules with anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, with the increase of cholinesterase activity, there was an extracellular reduction of ACh, an inhibitor of several inflammatory mediators.

Secondary lymphoid organs are highly innervated by sympathetic neurons that secrete norepinephrine (NE) as the primary neurotransmitter. Immune cells express adrenergic receptors, enabling the sympathetic nervous system to directly control immune function. NE is a potent immunosuppressive factor and markedly inhibits TNF-α secretion from innate cells in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In this study, we demonstrate that NE blocks the secretion of a variety of proinflammatory cytokines by rapidly inducing IL-10 secretion from innate cells in response to multiple Toll-like receptor (TLR) signals. NE mediated these effects exclusively through the β2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2). Consequently, Adrb2 animals were more susceptible to L. monocytogenes infection and to intestinal  in a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model of colitis. Further, Adrb2 animals rapidly succumbed to endotoxemia in response to a sub-lethal LPS challenge and exhibited elevated serum levels of TNF-α and reduced IL-10. LPS-mediated lethality in WT animals was rescued by administering a β 2-specific agonist and in Adrb2 animals by exogenous IL-10. These findings reveal a critical role for ADRB2 signaling in controlling  through the rapid induction of IL-10. Our findings provide a fundamental insight into how the sympathetic nervous system controls a critical facet of immune function through ADRB2 signaling.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Blood was sampled from 18 rabbits, of which six underwent laparoscopic TOH, six conventional open TOH and six conventional open TOH with pre-incisional local anaesthesia, 30 min before induction of anaesthesia (T0), immediately after skin incision (T1), 90 min postoperatively (T2), and 24 h postoperatively (T3). Cortisol and C-reactive protein serum, and adrenocorticothrophic hormone, tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), adrenaline, noradrenaline and IL-6 plasma concentrations were evaluated. Laparoscopic TOH in rabbits has advantages over the open surgical technique because it causes less surgical stress response in terms of serum cortisol concentrations immediately after skin incision (p = .04), as well as plasma adrenaline (p = .035) and TNF-a (p = .047) concentrations 24 h postoperatively. Impact statement What is already known on this subject? Hysterectomy is the second most common surgery performed on women after caesarean section. Research has focussed on methods to modify the stress response associated with surgery. Various studies both in humans and animals, have demonstrated the less systemic, immunological and neurohormonal response of the laparoscopic technique, which is expressed by less elevated serum enzymes' and proteins' concentrations. However, other studies have documented that the systemic stress response after open hysterectomy is similar to that following laparoscopic surgery. What do the results of this study add? Laparoscopic total ovariohysterectomy in rabbits has advantages over the open surgical technique because it causes less surgical stress response in terms of serum cortisol concentrations, as well as plasma adrenaline and TNF-a concentrations during the first 24 h postoperatively. What are the implications are of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? There were no significant differences between the groups in number of surgical stress markers (p > .05) perioperatively. We cannot exclude the possibility that a later increase of surgical stress response might take place after the first 24 h postoperatively.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30375380>Adrenal hormones mediate disease tolerance in malaria.</a></h2><p>Malaria reduces host fitness and survival by pathogen-mediated damage and .

Uveitis can lead to impaired vision and is responsible for 10% of all cases of blindness globally. Using an endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) rodent model, our previous data implicated the endogenous cannabinoid system (ECS) in the amelioration of many of the components of the inflammatory response. Here, we test the hypothesis that the reduction in inflammatory mediators in the EIU model by the CB agonist, HU308, is associated with changes in ECS endogenous ligands as well as related lipids, prostaglandins (PGs), 2-acyl glycerols, and lipoamines. Analysis of leukocytes and neutrophils, CB mRNA, and 26 lipids in the eye of WT mice after EIU induction and HU308 treatment were compared to the same analyses in the CB knock-out (CB KO) mouse. Endothelial leukocyte adhesion and neutrophil migration were significantly increased in both WT and CB KO after EIU. HU308 significantly reduced the leukocyte adhesion and neutrophil recruitment in the WT animals. HU308 also significantly reduced leukocyte adhesion in the CB KO mouse, yet, had no effect on neutrophil infiltration suggesting an important off-target effect of HU308. Lipidomics profiles revealed significant increases in 6 non-ECS lipids after EIU in the WT and that HU308 effectively reduced these back to control levels; in addition, HU308 increased levels of 2-acyl glycerols and decreased all N-acyl glycines. CB KOs with saline-injection compared to WT had significantly elevated levels of 2-acyl glycerols, whereas levels of N-oleoyl  (OEA), N-stearoyl  (SEA), and PGE were reduced. CB KOs with EIU had 13 lipids that were significantly lower than WT with EIU including 4 N-acyl glycines. HU308 had no effect on lipid concentrations in the CB KOs with EIU, however, it did cause further reductions on 3 additional lipids compared to saline controls. HU308 appears to be acting at a non-CB target for the reduction of leukocyte infiltration in the EIU model; however, our data suggest that HU308 is working through CB to reduce neutrophil migration and for the regulation of multiple lipid signaling pathways including PGs, lipoamines, and 2-acyl glycerols.

Macrophages are innate immune cells that survey and respond to danger and damage signals. Although it is well-known that energy metabolism can dictate macrophage function, little is known as to the importance of choline homeostasis in macrophage biology. We hypothesized that the uptake and metabolism of choline are important for macrophage . Polarization of primary bone marrow macrophages with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulted in an increased rate of choline uptake and higher levels of PC synthesis. This was attributed to a substantial increase in the transcript and protein expression of the choline transporter-like protein-1 (CTL1) in polarized cells. We next sought to determine the importance of choline uptake and CTL1 for macrophage immune responsiveness. Chronic pharmacological or CTL1 antibody-mediated inhibition of choline uptake resulted in altered cytokine secretion in response to LPS, which was associated with increased levels of diacylglycerol and activation of protein kinase C. These experiments establish a previously unappreciated link between choline phospholipid metabolism and macrophage immune responsiveness, highlighting a critical and regulatory role for macrophage choline uptake via the CTL1 transporter.© 2018 Snider et al.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30911771>Inter-kingdom signaling between gut microbiota and their host.</a></h2><p>The crosstalk between prokaryotic bacteria and eukaryotic gut epithelial cells has opened a new field for research. Quorum sensing system (QS) molecules employed by gut microbiota may play an essential role in host-microbial symbioses of the gut. Recent studies on the gut microbiome will unveil evolved mechanisms of the host to affect bacterial QS and shape bacterial composition. Bacterial autoinducers (AIs) could talk to the host's gut by eliciting proinflammatory effects and modulating the activities of T lymphocyte, macrophage, dendritic cells, and neutrophils. In addition, the gut mucosa could interfere with bacterial AIs by degrading them or secreting AI mimics. Moreover, bacterial AIs and gut hormones epinephrine and noradrenaline may be interchangeable in the crosstalk between the microbiota and human gut. Therefore, inter-kingdom signaling between gut microbiota and host may provide a novel target in the management of gut microbiota-related conditions or diseases in the future.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30849452>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease alters microcystin-LR toxicokinetics and acute toxicity.</a></h2><p>Microcystin-LR (MCLR) is a cyanotoxin produced by blue-green algae that causes liver and kidney toxicities. MCLR toxicity is dependent on cellular uptake through the organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) transporters. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) progresses through multiple stages, alters expression of hepatic OATPs, and is associated with chronic kidney disease. The purpose of this study was to determine whether NAFLD increases systemic exposure to MCLR and influences acute liver and kidney toxicities. Rats were fed a control diet or two dietary models of NAFLD; methionine and choline deficient (MCD) or high fat/high cholesterol (HFHC). Two studies were performed in these groups: 1) a single dose intravenous toxicokinetic study (20 μg/kg), and 2) a single dose intraperitoneal toxicity study (60 μg/kg). Compared to control rats, plasma MCLR area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) in MCD rats doubled, whereas biliary clearance (Cl) was unchanged; in contrast, plasma AUC in HFHC rats was unchanged, whereas Cl approximately doubled. Less MCLR bound to PP2A was observed in the liver of MCD rats. This shift in exposure decreased the severity of liver pathology only in the MCD rats after a single toxic dose of MCLR (60 μg/kg). In contrast, the single toxic dose of MCLR increased hepatic , plasma cholesterol, proteinuria, and urinary KIM1 in HFHC rats more than MCLR exposed control rats. In conclusion, rodent models of NAFLD alter MCLR toxicokinetics and acute toxicity and may have implications for liver and kidney pathologies in NAFLD patients.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In humans, immune activation is associated with lethargy and social withdrawal, irritability and aggression; changes in social motivation could, in theory, lead to less functional interactions. This might also be the case for animals housed in close confinement. Tail biting in pigs is an example of damaging social behavior, and sickness is thought to be a risk factor for tail biting outbreaks. One possible mechanism whereby sickness may influence behavior is through cytokines. To identify possible mediators between immune activation and behavioral change, we injected 16 gilts with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; O111:B4; 1.5 μg kg IV through a permanent catheter). In LPS-treated pigs, a significant increase in cortisol, TNF-α, IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-6, and IL-8 was observed alongside decreased activity within the first 6 h after the injection. CRP was elevated at 12 and 24 h after injection, and food intake was reduced for the first 24 h after injection. Three days post-injection, LPS pigs had lower levels of noradrenaline in their hypothalamus, hippocampus and frontal cortex compared to saline-injected pigs. Pigs injected with LPS also had higher levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ in their frontal cortex compared to saline-injected pigs. Thus, a low dose of LPS can induce changes in brain cytokine levels and neurotransmitter levels that persist after inflammatory and stress markers in the periphery have returned to baseline levels.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Here we show that testosterone regulates the cytokine BAFF, an essential survival factor for B cells. Male mice lacking the androgen receptor have increased splenic B cell numbers, serum BAFF levels and splenic Baff mRNA. Testosterone deficiency by castration causes expansion of BAFF-producing fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) in spleen, which may be coupled to lower splenic noradrenaline levels in castrated males, as an α-adrenergic agonist decreases splenic FRC number in vitro. Antibody-mediated blockade of the BAFF receptor or treatment with the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine revert the increased splenic B cell numbers induced by castration.

Levosimendan has vasorelaxant and anti-aggregatory properties. The present study evaluated the anti-aggregatory and cardioprotective effects of levosimendan versus cilostazol in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed rats subjected to isoproterenol-induced MI. Rats were assigned to normal, HFD, HFD + isoproterenol, HFD + isoproterenol + cilostazol, and HFD + isoproterenol + levosimendan. The present study investigated the anti-aggregatory effect of both levosimendan and cilostazol and revealed that both drugs attenuated the severity of platelet aggregation. Moreover, both levosimendan and cilostazol revealed effectiveness in attenuating the severity of HFD/isoproterenol-induced myocardial injury as revealed by electrocardiogram signs, apoptotic markers, and histopathological score via counteracting the oxidative stress burden, increments in the expression of inflammatory mediators, and modulating nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/ mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway.

Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome wherein  induction and incomplete resolution can potentially contribute to HF development and progression. However, the role of MDSCs in HF remains unclear.The percentage of MDSCs in patients with HF and in mice with pressure overload-induced HF using isoproterenol infusion or transverse aortic constriction (TAC) was detected by flow cytometry. The effects of MDSCs on isoproterenol- or TAC-induced HF were observed on depleting MDSCs with 5-fluorouracil (50 mg/kg) or gemcitabine (120 mg/kg), transferring purified MDSCs, or enhancing endogenous MDSCs with rapamycin (2 mg·kg·d). Hypertrophic markers and inflammatory factors were detected by ELISA, real-time polymerase chain reaction, or Western blot. Cardiac functions were determined by echocardiography and hemodynamic analysis.The percentage of human leukocyte antigen-D-related (HLA-DR)CD33CD11b MDSCs in the blood of patients with HF was significantly increased and positively correlated with disease severity and increased plasma levels of cytokines, including interleukin-6, interleukin-10, and transforming growth factor-β. Furthermore, MDSCs derived from patients with HF inhibited T-cell proliferation and interferon-γ secretion. Similar results were observed in TAC- and isoproterenol-induced HF in mice. Pharmaceutical depletion of MDSCs significantly exacerbated isoproterenol- and TAC-induced pathological cardiac remodeling and , whereas adoptive transfer of MDSCs prominently rescued isoproterenol- and TAC-induced HF. Consistently, administration of rapamycin significantly increased endogenous MDSCs by suppressing their differentiation and improved isoproterenol- and TAC-induced HF, but MDSC depletion mostly blocked beneficial rapamycin-mediated effects. Mechanistically, MDSC-secreted molecules suppressed isoproterenol-induced hypertrophy and proinflammatory gene expression in cardiomyocytes in a coculture system. Neutralization of interleukin-10 blunted both monocytic MDSC- and granulocytic MDSC-mediated anti-inflammatory and antihypertrophic effects, but treatment with a nitric oxide inhibitor only partially blocked the antihypertrophic effect of monocytic MDSCs.Our findings revealed a cardioprotective role of MDSCs in HF by their antihypertrophic effects on cardiomyocytes and anti-inflammatory effects through interleukin-10 and nitric oxide.

In the present study, we examined the hypothesis that vascular reactivity induced by septic shock similarly displays organ-specific differences and is regulated by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and endothelin-1 (ET-1).Endotoxic shock was induced in rabbits by administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1 mg/kg), and organ specificity of vascular reactivity of superior mesenteric artery (SMA), celiac artery (CA), and left renal artery (LRA) as well as the potential involvement of iNOS and ET-1 examined.Vascular reactivity of SMA, CA, and LRA was increased at the early stages and decreased at the late stages after LPS administration. Superior mesenteric artery showed the greatest decrease in vascular reactivity in response to norepinephrine (NE) (34.9%) and acetylcholine (Ach; 32.3%), followed by LRA (NE, 33.7%; Ach, 30.5%) and CA (NE, 16.2%), whereas the relaxation reactivity of CA in response to Ach was increased to 159%. The mRNA and protein levels of iNOS and ET-1 in SMA, CA, and LRA were not affected at the early stages of endotoxic shock after LPS administration but significantly increased at the late stages. Expression levels were higher in SMA than CA and LRA and negatively correlated with the decrease in vascular reactivity. The iNOS and ET-1 inhibitors, aminoguanidine (20 mg/kg) and PD-142893 (0.02 mg/kg), respectively, induced significant improvements in vascular reactivity and organ perfusion and stabilized the hemodynamic parameters in rabbits subjected to endotoxic shock.Changes in vascular reactivity during endotoxic shock are organ-specific. Differential expression patterns of iNOS and ET-1 in different blood vessels contribute to the organ specificity of vascular reactivity.Therapeutic study, level II.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30778122>Metabolic adaptation of adherent-invasive Escherichia coli to exposure to bile salts.</a></h2><p>The adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC), which colonize the ileal mucosa of Crohn's disease patients, adhere to intestinal epithelial cells, invade them and exacerbate intestinal .

Isoproterenol also significantly reduced apoptosis and ROS generation. No effect of IκBα was observed on Tyr-42 phosphorylation.

Importantly, their complex metabolism represents a highly controlled cellular signaling network that is essential for mounting an effective innate immune response. Phospholipids in innate cells are subject to dynamic regulation by enzymes, whose activities are highly responsive to activation status. Along with their metabolic products, they regulate multiple aspects of innate immune cell biology, including shape change, aggregation, blood clotting, and degranulation. Phospholipid hydrolysis provides substrates for cell-cell communication, enables regulation of hemostasis, immunity, thrombosis, and vascular , and is centrally important in cardiovascular disease and associated comorbidities. Phospholipids themselves are also recognized by innate-like T cells, which are considered essential for recognition of infection or cancer, as well as self-antigens.

However, compared with norepinephrine, secondary outcomes of vasopressin were increased due to the high rate of atrial fibrillation (11.83% vs. 20.12%, P = 0.038) and ventricular arrhythmias (14.20% vs. 24.85%, P = 0.014).Compared with norepinephrine, vasopressin could not improve the postoperative outcomes in patients with pLVD after cardiac surgery. Vasopressin should be cautious to be used as a first-line vasopressor agent in postcardiac vasoplegic shock.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30257319>Cycloastragenol ameliorates experimental heart damage in rats by promoting myocardial autophagy via inhibition of AKT1-RPS6KB1 signaling.</a></h2><p>Cycloastragenol, a naturally occurring compound in Astragali Radix, has been demonstrated to possess various pharmacological actions including anti-aging, anti-, anti-fibrosis, antibacterial, liver and endothelium protection. However, whether cycloastragenol ameliorates heart failure remains unclear. Isoproterenol administration to rats triggered classic cardiac damage, as demonstrated by objective parameters of cardiac dysfunction. The treatment of cycloastragenol improved deranged cardiac parameters in the isoproterenol-induced heart damage model in a dose-dependent manner. At the same time, cycloastragenol markedly ameliorated cardiac histological changes and down-regulated serum levels of various neuroendocrine factors including norepinephrine, aldosterone, brain natriuretic peptide, endothelin 1, angiotensin II and so on. Moreover, the expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 in rat heart were also inhibited by cycloastragenol. Mechanistically, augmenting autophagy of myocardial cells via the inhibition of AKT1-RPS6KB1 signaling contributed to the improvement of isoproterenol-induced rat heart failure by cycloastragenol. These results suggest that cycloastragenol ameliorates cardiac dysfunction and remodeling through promoting autophagy in myocardial cells and suppressing MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions, indicating that it could be a drug candidate for patients with congestive heart failure.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We recently discovered EE's anti-inflammatory protection of brain microglia against soluble oligomers of human amyloid β-protein (oAβ). Mechanistically, we report that the key factor in microglial protection by EE is chronically enhanced β-adrenergic signaling. Quantifying microglial morphology and inflammatory RNA profiles revealed that mice in standard housing (SH) fed the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol experienced similar protection of microglia against oAβ-induced  as did mice in EE Conversely, mice in EE fed the β-adrenergic antagonist propranolol lost microglial protection against oAβ. Mice lacking β1/β2-adrenergic receptors showed no protection of microglia by EE In SH mice, quantification of norepinephrine in hippocampus and interstitial fluid showed that oAβ disrupted norepinephrine homeostasis, and microglial-specific analysis of β2-adrenergic receptors indicated a decreased receptor level. Both features were rescued by EE Thus, enhanced β-adrenergic signaling at the ligand and receptor levels mediates potent benefits of EE on microglial  induced by human Aβ oligomers .© 2018 The Authors.

A prospective observational study was conducted in a medical intensive care unit of a tertiary, teaching university hospital. Thirty-two, mechanical-ventilated septic shock patients were included in this study. We simultaneously measured CFI and GEF with LVEF. The correlation of CFI, GEF along with LVEF and ability of CFI and GEF to predict LVEF ≥ 40, 50 and 60% were evaluated. There were 192 pairs of CFI, GEF and LVEF. CFI was significantly correlated with GEF (r = 0.82, P < 0.0001). A significant correlation was observed between CFI and LVEF (r = 0.56, P < 0.0001) and GEF and LVEF (r = 0.71, P < 0.0001). The CFI and GEF had a good predictive ability for estimating LVEF ≥ 40, 50 and 60%, with an area under receiving operating characteristic (AUC) 0.875-0.934. The CFI ≥ 3/min predicted LVEF ≥ 40% with sensitivity 95.1% and specificity 48.3%. The GEF ≥ 15%, estimated LVEF ≥ 40% with sensitivity 92.6% and specificity 69%. There were 40 thermodilution and LVEF measurements obtained before and after norepinephrine adjustment. Blood pressure as well as the cardiac index were significantly increased, whereas there were no changes in CFI, GEF and LVEF values.

Protein array analysis confirmed the presence of various growth factors, including transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, in the supernatants of high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI)-activated HLMCs which, when applied to ASM cells, impaired albuterol-induced cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production, an effect that was prevented following neutralization of TGF-β1. This blunted β -AR response was reproduced by treating ASM cells with TGF-β1 or fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2, which induced β -AR phosphorylation at tyrosine residues Tyr and Tyr , and significantly reduced the maximal bronchorelaxant responses to isoproterenol in human precision cut lung slices (PCLS). Finally, ASM cells isolated from severe asthmatics displayed constitutive elevated β -AR phosphorylation at both Tyr and Tyr and a reduced relaxant response to albuterol.

The search for new drugs remains ongoing, and natural products are a source for potential new compounds. Mangiferin, a natural xanthone C-glucoside, has demonstrated biological activity, including anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, but it's mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of local administration of mangiferin. We employed an electronic von Frey apparatus to evaluate mechanical hyperalgesia induced by carrageenan in rats. Mangiferin (150-1200 µg/paw), administered locally into the hindpaw, prevented hyperalgesia in a dose-dependent - 150 µg (- 9%), 300 µg (- 27%, P < 0.01), 600 µg (- 77%, P < 0.001) and 1000 µg (- 93%, P < 0.001) - and local manner. Mangiferin showed decreased levels of TNF-α (P < 0.001) and CINC-1 (P < 0.001), but not IL-1β; it also prevented neutrophil migration (P < 0.01), but not the increased COX-2 expression in peripheral tissue challenged with carrageenan. To further explore the mechanisms of mangiferin actions, rats were injected with modulators of  and nociception; mangiferin prevented hyperalgesia induced by IL-1β (P < 0.01), CINC-1 (P < 0.01), epinephrine (P < 0.01), 8-Br-cAMP (P < 0.01) or capsaicin (P < 0.01), but not that induced by PGE or α,β-MeATP. Our study shows that mangiferin has anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties when locally administrated. The control of the inflammatory response and mechanical hyperalgesia by mangiferin depends on the inhibition of TNF-α production/release and the CINC1/epinephrine/PKA pathway, supporting its marked inhibition of inflammatory mechanical hyperalgesia.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Animal studies have shown that maternal undernutrition leads to behavioral impairment, which is linked to alterations in monoaminergic systems and  in the brain. In this study, we focused on the  plasmalogen of the brain as a possible contributor to behavioral disturbances observed in offspring exposed to maternal undernutrition. Maternal food or protein restriction between gestational day (GD) 5.5 and GD 10.5 resulted in hyperactivity of rat male adult offspring. Genes related to the phospholipid biosynthesis were found to be activated in the PFC, but not in the NAcc or striatum, in the offspring exposed to prenatal undernutrition. Corresponding to these gene activations, increased  plasmalogen (18:0p-22:6) was observed in the PFC using mass spectrometry imaging. A high number of crossings and the long time spent in the center area were observed in the offspring exposed to prenatal undernutrition and were mimicked in adult rats via the intravenous injection of  plasmalogen (18:0p-22:6) incorporated into the liposome. Additionally, plasmalogen (18:0p-22:6) increased only in the PFC, and not in the NAcc or striatum. These results suggest that brain plasmalogen is one of the key molecules to control behavior, and its injection using liposome is a potential therapeutic approach for cognitive impairment. Maternal undernutrition correlates to developmental and psychiatric disorders. Here, we found that maternal undernutrition in early pregnancy led to hyperactivity in rat male offspring and induced gene activation of phospholipid-synthesizing enzyme and elevation of  plasmalogen (18:0p-22:6) level in the PFC. Intravenous injection of  plasmalogen (18:0p-22:6) incorporated into the liposome maintained crossing activity and the activity was circumscribed to the center area for a long time period, as in prenatally undernourished offspring with aberrant behavior. Furthermore, the amount of  plasmalogen (18:0p-22:6) increased in the PFC of the rat after injection. Our result suggests that brain plasmalogen is one of the key molecules to control behavior and that its injection using liposome is a potential therapeutic approach for cognitive impairment.Copyright © 2019 the authors.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30006892>Terlipressin or norepinephrine, or both in septic shock?</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29478028>Diabetes adversely affects phospholipid profiles in human carotid artery endarterectomy plaques.</a></h2><p>Patients with diabetes are at higher risk of developing carotid artery stenosis and resultant stroke.

We performed a comprehensive paired analysis of phospholipids in extracranial carotid endarterectomy (CEA) plaques of matched diabetic and nondiabetic patients and analyzed mass spectrometry-derived profiles of three phospholipids, plasmenyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (pPE), phosphatidylserine (PS), and phosphatidylinositol (PI), in maximally (MAX) and minimally (MIN) diseased CEA segments. We also measured levels of arachidonic acid (AA), produced by pPE hydrolysis, and choline- phosphotransferase 1 (CEPT1), responsible for most pPE de novo biosynthesis. In paired analysis, MIN CEA segments had higher levels than MAX segments of pPE ( < 0.001), PS ( < 0.001), and PI ( < 0.03). MIN diabetic plaques contained higher levels than MAX diabetic plaques of arachidonoyl pPE38:4 and pPE38:5 and CEPT1 was upregulated in diabetic versus nondiabetic plaques. AA levels were relatively greater in MIN versus MAX segments of all CEA segments, and were higher in diabetic than nondiabetic plaques.

On the 29th day, rats were anaesthetized and right carotid artery was cannulated to record hemodynamic parameters. Subsequently, blood sample was collected and heart was removed to evaluate various parameters.Fisetin at doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg reversed ISO induced detrimental alterations in blood pressure and left ventricular pressures and reduced the myocardial injury markers CK-MB and LDH in the serum. These findings were supported by amelioration of ISO induced histological and ultrastructural damage by fisetin. The disequilibrium in the levels of pro and anti oxidants in the myocardial tissue caused by ISO was also normalized Furthermore, apoptosis was evident from enhanced DNA fragmentation and raised pro-apoptotic proteins (bax, caspase-3, cytochrome-c) as well as suppressed anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2) in case of ISO treatment which again was reversed by fisetin. A molecular mechanism for this protection was elucidated as downregulation of RAGE and NF-κB However fisetin at 40 mg/kg revealed a deteriorating effect which was similar to ISO group of rats.Hence, through our study, the role of fisetin in cardioprotection has been uncovered via a molecular pathway.Copyright © 2018.

Thus, treatments suppressing microglial activation may have therapeutic benefits to prevent neuronal loss in neurodegenerative diseases. Our previous findings show that Salmeterol, a long-acting β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) agonist, is neuroprotective in two distinct animal models of PD, including where lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from E. coli was used to initiate chronic neurodegeneration. Salmeterol was found to be a potent inhibitor of dopaminergic neurodegeneration by regulating the production of pro-inflammatory mediators from activated microglial cells. In the present study, we investigated the molecular basis of the anti-inflammatory effects of Salmeterol on LPS-activated murine microglial BV2 cells. BV2 cells were pretreated with Salmeterol and followed by stimulation with LPS. Salmeterol inhibited LPS-induced release of the pro-inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and nitric oxide from BV2 cells. Additionally, Salmeterol suppressed nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) p65 by inhibiting the IκB-α degradation and TAK1 (transforming growth factor-beta-activated kinase1) phosphorylation. We have also found that Salmeterol increases the expression of β-arrestin2 and enhances the interaction between β-arrestin2 and TAB1 (TAK1-binding protein), reduced TAK1/TAB1 mediated activation of NFκB and expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Furthermore, silencing of β-arrestin2 abrogates the anti-inflammatory effects of Salmeterol in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells. Our findings suggest that the anti-inflammatory properties of Salmeterol is β-arrestin2 dependent and also offers novel therapeutics targeting inflammatory pathways to prevent microglial cell activation and neuronal loss in neuroinflammatory diseases like PD.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The present randomized, parallel group, double-blind placebo-controlled trial is the first study depicted to probe the efficacy of co-treatment with risperidone and PEA over 10 weeks in children with autism. Seventy children (aged 4-12 years) with autism and moderate to severe symptoms of irritability were randomly assigned to two treatment regimens. The study outcomes were measured using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Edition (ABC-C). At trial endpoint (week 10), combination of PEA and risperidone had superior efficacy in ameliorating the ABC-irritability and hyperactivity/noncompliance symptoms (Cohen's d, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.94, 0.41 to 1.46, p = 0.001) compared with a risperidone plus placebo regimen. Interestingly, effect of combination treatment on hyperactivity symptoms was also observed at trial midpoint (week 5) but with a smaller effect size (d = 0.53, p = 0.04) than that at the endpoint (d = 0.94, p = 0.001). Meanwhile, there was a trend toward significance for superior effect of risperidone plus PEA over risperidone plus placebo on inappropriate speech at trial endpoint (d = 0.51, p = 0.051). No significant differences existed between the two treatment groups for the other two ABC-C subscales (lethargy/social withdrawal and stereotypic behavior).

The complex nature of this process clouds a comprehensive understanding of CR, but greater insight into the processes and mechanisms has potential to identify new therapeutic targets. To provide a deeper understanding of this important cardiac process, we applied a new proteomic technique, PALM (Pulse Azidohomoalanine in Mammals), to quantitate the newly-synthesized protein (NSP) changes during the progression of isoproterenol (ISO)-induced CR in the mouse left ventricle. This analysis revealed a complex combination of adaptive and maladaptive alterations at acute and prolonged time points including the identification of proteins not previously associated with CR. We also combined the PALM dataset with our published protein turnover rate dataset to identify putative biochemical mechanisms underlying CR. The novel integration of analyzing NSPs together with their protein turnover rates demonstrated that alterations in specific biological pathways (e.g.,  and oxidative stress) are produced by differential regulation of protein synthesis and degradation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was conducted to assess the cardioprotective action of RK against isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiotoxicity. Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups (six rats/group). Rats were orally administered with RK (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg, respectively) and fenofibrate (standard, 80 mg/kg) for 28 days and ISO was administered (85 mg/kg, subcutaneously) on 27th and 28th day. Administration of ISO in rats significantly altered hemodynamic and electrocardiogram patterns, total antioxidant capacity, PPAR-α, and apolipoprotein C-III levels. These myocardial aberrations were further confirmed during infarct size, heart weight to body weight ratio and immunohistochemical assessments (caspase-3 and nuclear factor-κB). RK pretreatment (100 and 200 mg/kg) significantly protected rats against oxidative stress, , and dyslipidemia caused by ISO as demonstrated by change in hemodynamic, biochemical and histological parameters. The results so obtained were quite comparable with fenofibrate. Moreover, RK was found to have binding affinity with PPAR-α, as confirmed by docking analysis. PPAR-α expression and concentration was also found increased in presence of RK which gave impression that RK probably showed cardioprotection via PPAR-α activation, however direct binding study of RK with PPAR-α is needed to confirm this assumption.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we combine DNA stable isotope probing with high throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and C-choline enriched metagenomes, followed by metagenome data assembly, to identify the key microbes responsible for methanogenesis from choline. Microcosm incubation with C-choline leads to the formation of trimethylamine and subsequent methane production, suggesting that choline-dependent methanogenesis is a two-step process involving trimethylamine as the key intermediate. Amplicon sequencing analysis identifies Deltaproteobacteria of the genera Pelobacter as the major choline utilizers. Methanogenic Archaea of the genera Methanococcoides become enriched in choline-amended microcosms, indicating their role in methane formation from trimethylamine. The binning of metagenomic DNA results in the identification of bins classified as Pelobacter and Methanococcoides. Analyses of these bins reveal that Pelobacter have the genetic potential to degrade choline to trimethylamine using the choline-trimethylamine lyase pathway, whereas Methanococcoides are capable of methanogenesis using the pyrrolysine-containing trimethylamine methyltransferase pathway. Together, our data provide a new insight on the diversity of choline utilizing organisms in coastal sediments and support a syntrophic relationship between Bacteria and Archaea as the dominant route for methanogenesis from choline in this environment.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31399738>Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids impinge on CD4+ T cell motility and adipose tissue distribution via direct and lipid mediator-dependent effects.</a></h2><p>Adaptive immunity contributes to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular metabolic disorders (CVMD). The omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3PUFA) are beneficial for cardiovascular health, with potential to improve the dysregulated adaptive immune responses associated with metabolic imbalance. We aimed to explore the mechanisms through which n-3PUFA may alter T cell motility and tissue distribution to promote a less inflammatory environment and improve lymphocyte function in CVMD.Using mass spectrometry lipidomics, cellular, biochemical, and in vivo and ex vivo analyses, we investigated how eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the main n-3PUFA, modify the trafficking patterns of activated CD4+ T cells. In mice subjected to allogeneic immunization, a 3-week n-3PUFA-enriched diet reduced the number of effector memory CD4+ T cells found in adipose tissue, and changed the profiles of eicosanoids, octadecanoids, docosanoids, endocannabinoids, 2-monoacylglycerols, N-acyl  and ceramides, in plasma, lymphoid organs and fat tissues. These bioactive lipids exhibited differing chemotactic properties when tested in chemotaxis assays with activated CD4+ T cells in vitro. Furthermore, CD4+ T cells treated with EPA and DHA showed a significant reduction in chemokinesis, as assessed by trans-endothelial migration assays, and, when implanted in recipient mice, demonstrated less efficient migration to the inflamed peritoneum. Finally, EPA and DHA treatments reduced the number of polarised CD4+ T cells in vitro, altered the phospholipid composition of membrane microdomains and decreased the activity of small Rho GTPases, Rhoα and Rac1 instrumental in cytoskeletal dynamics.Our findings suggest that EPA and DHA affect the motility of CD4+ T cells and modify their ability to reach target tissues by interfering with the cytoskeletal rearrangements required for cell migration. This can explain, at least in part, the anti-inflammatory effects of n-3PUFA supporting their potential use in interventions aiming to address adipocyte low grade  associated with cardiovascular metabolic disease.© The Author(s) 2019.

These roles are conveyed via two cognate receptors, natriuretic peptide receptor B (NPR-B) and natriuretic peptide receptor C (NPR-C), which activate different signalling pathways that mediate complementary yet distinct cellular responses. Traditionally, CNP has been deemed the endothelial component of the natriuretic peptide system, while its sibling peptides, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), are considered the endocrine guardians of cardiac function and blood volume. However, accumulating evidence indicates that CNP not only modulates vascular tone and blood pressure, but also governs a wide range of cardiovascular effects including the control of , angiogenesis, smooth muscle and endothelial cell proliferation, atherosclerosis, cardiomyocyte contractility, hypertrophy, fibrosis, and cardiac electrophysiology. This review will focus on the novel physiological functions ascribed to CNP, the receptors/signalling mechanisms involved in mediating its cardioprotective effects, and the development of therapeutics targeting CNP signalling pathways in different disease pathologies.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29675711>β-adrenoceptor signaling reduction is involved in the inflammatory response of fibroblast-like synoviocytes from adjuvant-induced arthritic rats.</a></h2><p>To investigate the effects of β-AR signaling on fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) from adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA) rats and the partial mechanisms focused on β-AR desensitization mediated by GRK2 and β-arrestin2.Animals were divided into a control group and an AA model group, and FLSs were cultured. Arthritis index, histopathology of joints, epinephrine (Epi) and norepinephrine (NE) were detected in vivo. The effect of the β-AR agonist isoprenaline (ISO) and the β-AR agonist salbutamol on FLS cell viability were detected by CCK8. Cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, OPG and RANKL were examined by ELISA. The expression of β-AR was detected by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. The cytomembrane expression and desensitization of β2-AR, GRK2, and β-arrestin2 were measured by flow cytometry and western blot.The concentration of NE increased to a peak on day 21, which was consistent with the arthritis index. The levels of Epi and NE in synovial tissues were decreased. ISO inhibited FLS cell viability and TNF-α, IL-1β, and RANKL secretion, and promoted OPG secretion. β-AR mediated the effects of ISO on FLS cell viability. β-AR signaling was weaker in AA rats compared to the controls. Elevated GRK2 and β-arrestin2 in cytomembranes promoted β-AR desensitization and may decrease the anti-inflammatory effect of β-AR signaling.The activation of β-AR signaling exerts its anti-inflammatory activities on FLS. β-AR signaling decreased in the AA model, which might be related to the increased membrane expression of GRK2 and β-arrestin2, and promoted the excessive desensitization of β-AR.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 160 patients with moderate persistent asthma were randomly divided into 4 groups (n=40): the 3 control groups were given fluticasone propionate aerosol (group A), salmeterol-fluticasone propionate inhalant (group B), and tiotropium bromide inhalation powder combined with salmeterol-fluticasone propionate inhalant (group C), respectively, and the experimental group received tiotropium bromide inhalation powder combined with fluticasone propionate aerosol (group D) and salbutamol was used to relieve symptoms when necessary. RESULTS After 8 weeks of treatment, the pulmonary function of group D, which was significantly better than those of group A (P<0.05), was similar to those of groups B and C (P>0.05). Group D had significantly better asthma control test scores and nighttime symptom scores than in group A (P<0.05), without significant differences from those of group B or group C (P>0.05). The number of times salbutamol was used to alleviate symptoms was significantly different (P<0.05) between group D and group A (P<0.05), as well as between group C and group D (P<0.05). Groups D and B had similar results (P>0.05). IL-13 levels in induced sputum had significant differences (P<0.05). The levels in group D, which were higher than those of groups A and B (P<0.05), were similar to those of group C (P>0.05).

Our objective was to determine whether there is a dose-dependent effect of THS exposure on biological markers of harm (BMH) using an in vivo exposure system that mimics exposure of humans to THS. THS exposure generated from as low as the 10 cigarettes-smoking regimen, resulted in increased circulating inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1 alpha, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor. We also found that there was an increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone and superoxide dismutase and a decrease in ATP levels in liver tissue. Many of the altered BMH that are related to oxidative stress and decrease in ATP levels, suggest mitochondrial dysfunction. THS exposure generated from the 20 and 40 cigarettes-smoking regimen resulted in further damage. Our studies are important because virtually nothing is known about the physiological damage caused by different levels of THS exposure. These studies can also serve to educate the public on the dangers of THS and the BMH we identified can potentially be used in the clinic, once verified in exposed humans.Copyright © 2018.

Seretide® and Fluticort plus® are two available generic and brand name products of salmeterol/fluticasone. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of these two drugs.In this randomized comparative, clinical trial, 80 asthmatic patients were allocated to Fluticort plus® (n=40) or Seretide® (n=40) for a period of 4 weeks. Patients with mild asthma were instructed to inhale one puff each 12 hours and those with moderate asthma two puffs every 12 hours. Respiratory volumes (assessed using spirometry), quality of life (assessed using St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire [SGRQ]) and control of asthmatic symptoms (assessed using asthma control test [ACT]) were evaluated at baseline and at the end of the study.ACT score improved only in the Fluticort plus® group (p=0.012) while it was not significantly changed in the Seretide® group (p=0.178).

In this study, we demonstrated that inflamed dysfunctional adipose tissue plays a crucial role in cholesterol-induced NMS. Control (C), high cholesterol (HC) and HC with 10% fructose in drinking water (HCF) diets were fed to Sprague-Dawley rats for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, the body weights of the C- and HC-fed rats were comparable, but the weights of the HCF-fed rats were relatively low. Cholesterol caused metabolic problems such as high blood pressure, hypercholesterolemia and hypoinsulinemia. The HCF-fed rats exhibited whole-body insulin resistance with low circulating high-density lipoprotein levels. Increases in the tumor necrosis factor α level in the plasma, the number of CD68+ macrophages and the free nuclear factor-κB level in gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT) resulted in local , which appeared as inflamed dysfunctional gWAT. Reduced superoxide dismutases (SODs) deteriorate natural antioxidant defense systems and induce reactive oxygen species in gWAT. Dysregulation of plasma levels of catecholamine, adipokines (leptin and adiponectin), hormone-sensitive lipase and perilipin in cholesterol-induced inflamed adipose tissue contributed to increased lipolysis and increased circulating nonesterified fatty acids. Cholesterol activated , lipolysis and cell death in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Moreover, Chol-3T3-CM reduced the population of M2-type Raw264.7 macrophages, indicating that the macrophage polarization is mediated by cholesterol.

Recently, a new advantageous crystal form of puerarin, puerarin-V, has been developed. However, the cardioprotective effects of puerarin-V on myocardial infarction (MI) heart failure are still unclear. In this research, we aim to evaluate the cardioprotective effects of puerarin-V on the isoproterenol (ISO)-induced MI mice and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. To induce MI in C57BL/6 mice, ISO was administered at 40 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 h for three times in total. The mice were randomly divided into nine groups: (1) control; (2) ISO; (3) ISO + puerarin injection; (4⁻9) ISO + puerarin-V at different doses and timings. After treatment, cardiac function was evaluated by electrocardiogram (ECG), biochemical and histochemical analysis. In vitro inflammatory responses and apoptosis were evaluated in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) challenged by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS-induced PPAR-Υ/NF-κB and subsequently activation of cytokines were assessed by the western blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Administration of puerarin-V significantly inhibits the typical ST segment depression compared with that in MI mice. Further, puerarin-V treatment significantly improves ventricular wall infarction, decreases the incidence of mortality, and inhibits the levels of myocardial injury markers. Moreover, puerarin-V treatment reduces the inflammatory milieu in the heart of MI mice, thereby blocking the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines (,  and ). The beneficial effects of puerarin-V might be associated with the normalization in gene expression of PPAR-Υ and PPAR-Υ/NF-κB  phosphorylation. In the in vitro experiment, treatment with puerarin-V (0.3, 1 and 3 μM) significantly reduces cell death and suppresses the  cytokines expression. Likewise, puerarin-V exhibits similar mechanisms. The cardioprotective effects of puerarin-V treatment on MI mice in the pre + post-ISO group seem to be more prominent compared to those in the post-ISO group. Puerarin-V exerts cardioprotective effects against ISO-induced MI in mice, which may be related to the activation of PPAR-γ and the inhibition of NF-κB signaling in vivo and in vitro.

However, the role of EETs in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis has not been fully understood. In this study, we investigated the protective role of EETs in methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in mice and the potential mechanisms. We used 1-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1-propionylpiperidin-4-yl)urea(TPPU), a soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor, to increase the endogenous EET level in mice. Upon TPPU treatment, the liver steatosis and inflammatory damage were significantly ameliorated in mice with steatohepatitis, paralleled by the downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) as well as chemokines (CXCL1, MCP-1). Compared with untreated NASH mice, mRNA levels of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) and  relevant adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1) were downregulated, whereas mRNA level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α(PPAR-α) was elevated in TPPU-treated mice.

Hence, it has been shown that microbiota depletion can ameliorate high-fat diet or western-diet induced experimental Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, its functional implications in the methionine-choline dietary model, remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigated the physiological relevance of gut microbiota in methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet induced NASH. Experimental liver disease was induced by 8 weeks of MCD feeding in wild-type (WT) mice, either with or without commensal microbiota depletion, by continuous broad-spectrum antibiotic (AB) treatment. MCD diet induced steatohepatitis was accompanied by a reduced gut microbiota diversity, indicating intestinal dysbiosis. MCD treatment prompted macroscopic shortening of the intestine, as well as intestinal villi in histology. However, gut microbiota composition of MCD-treated mice, neither resembled human NASH, nor did it augment the intestinal barrier integrity or intestinal . In the MCD model, AB treatment resulted in increased steatohepatitis activity, compared to microbiota proficient control mice. This phenotype was driven by pronounced neutrophil infiltration, while AB treatment only slightly increased monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMF) abundance. Our data demonstrated the differential role of gut microbiota, during steatohepatitis development. In the context of MCD induced steatohepatitis, commensal microbiota was found to be hepatoprotective.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29409488>The topical study of inhaled drug (salbutamol) delivery in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.</a></h2><p>Our aim was to investigate total and regional lung delivery of salbutamol in subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).The TOPICAL study was a 4-period, partially-randomised, controlled, crossover study to investigate four aerosolised approaches in IPF subjects. Nine subjects were randomised to receive Technetium-labelled monodisperse salbutamol (1.5 μm or 6 μm; periods 1 and 2). Subjects also received radio-labelled salbutamol using a polydisperse nebuliser (period 3) and unlabelled salbutamol (400 μg) using a polydisperse pressurized metered dose inhaler with volumatic spacer (pMDI; period 4).Small monodisperse particles (1.5 μm) achieved significantly better total lung deposition (TLD, mean % ± SD) than larger particles (6 μm), where polydisperse nebulisation was poor; (TLD, 64.93 ± 10.72; 50.46 ± 17.04; 8.19 ± 7.72, respectively). Small monodisperse particles (1.5 μm) achieved significantly better lung penetration (mean % ± SD) than larger particles (6 μm), and polydisperse nebulisation showed lung penetration similar to the small particles; PI (mean ± SD) 0.8 ± 0.16, 0.49 ± 0.21, and 0.73 ± 0.19, respectively. Higher dose-normalised plasma salbutamol levels were observed following monodisperse 1.5 μm and 6 μm particles, compared to polydisperse pMDI inhalation, while lowest plasma levels were observed following polydisperse nebulisation.Our data is the first systematic investigation of inhaled drug delivery in fibrotic lung disease.

Inconsistencies in the association of plasma N-acylethanolamines with human obesity and cardiometabolic risk have emerged among previous studies, possibly caused by heterogeneous cohorts and designs, and by unstandardized N-acylethanolamine measurements. We aimed to characterize changes in the plasma profile, including N-acylethanolamine levels and ratios associated with obesity, menopause in women, and ageing in men, and to define the significance of such a profile as a biomarker for metabolic imbalance.Adult, drug-free women (n = 103 premenopausal and n = 81 menopausal) and men (n = 144) were stratified according to the body mass index (BMI) into normal weight (NW; BMI: 18.5-24.9 kg/m), overweight (OW; BMI: 25.0-29.9 kg/m), and obese (OB; BMI ≥30.0 kg/m). Anthropometric and metabolic parameters were determined. Validated blood processing and analytical procedures for N-acylethanolamine measurements were used. We investigated the effect of BMI and menopause in women, and BMI and age in men, as well as the BMI-independent influence of metabolic parameters on the N-acylethanolamine profile.BMI and waist circumference directly associated with AEA in women and men, and with PEA in premenopausal women and in men, while BMI directly associated with OEA in premenopausal women and in men. BMI, in both genders, and waist circumference, in women only, inversely associated with PEA/AEA and OEA/AEA. Menopause increased N-acylethanolamine levels, whereas ageing resulted in increasing OEA relative abundance in men. AEA and OEA abundances in premenopausal, and PEA and OEA abundances in lean menopausal women, were directly associated with hypertension. Conversely, PEA and OEA abundances lowered with hypertension in elderly men. Insulin resistance was associated with changes in N-acylethanolamine ratios specific for premenopausal (reduced PEA/AEA and OEA/AEA), menopausal (reduced OEA/AEA) women and men (reduced OEA/AEA and OEA/PEA). PEA and OEA levels increased with total cholesterol, and OEA abundance specifically increased with HDL-cholesterol. Elevated triglyceride levels were associated with increased N-acylethanolamine levels only in menopausal women.Obesity-related N-acylethanolamine hypertone is characterized by imbalanced N-acylethanolamine ratios. The profile given by a combination of N-acylethanolamine absolute levels and ratios enables imbalances to be identified in relationship with different metabolic parameters, with specific relevance according to gender, menopause and age, representing a useful means for monitoring metabolic health. Finally, N-acylethanolamine system appears a promising target for intervention strategies.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

Our recent in vitro studies in primary human airway smooth (ASM) cells have confirmed the essential anti-inflammatory role played by TTP as a critical partner in a cytokine regulatory network. However, several unanswered questions remain. While prior in vitro studies have suggested that TTP is regulated in a cAMP-mediated manner, raising the possibility that this may be one of the ways in which β-agonists achieve beneficial effects beyond bronchodilation, the impact of β-agonists on ASM cells is unknown. Furthermore, the effect of prostaglandin E (PGE) on TTP expression in ASM cells has not been reported. We address this herein and reveal, for the first time, that TTP is not regulated by cAMP-activating agents nor following treatment with long-acting β-agonists. However, PGE does induce TTP mRNA expression and protein upregulation in ASM cells. Although the underlying mechanism of action remains undefined, we can confirm that PGE-induced TTP upregulation is not mediated via cAMP, or EP/EP receptor activation, and occurred in a manner independent of the p38 MAPK-mediated pathway. Taken together, these data confirm that β-agonists do not upregulate TTP in human ASM cells and indicate that another way in which PGE may achieve beneficial effects in asthma and COPD may be via upregulation of the master controller of -TTP.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30725132>Preliminary results of synergy between norepinephrine and terlipressin during septic shock.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30142319>Mediterranean diet and platelet-activating factor; a systematic review.</a></h2><p>Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a glycerylether lipid and one of the most potent endogenous mediators of . Through its binding to a well-characterized receptor it initiates a plethora of cellular pro-inflammatory actions participating by this way to the pathology of most chronic diseases, including cardiovascular and renal diseases, CNS decline and cancer. Among the variety of prudent dietary patterns, Mediterranean Diet (MD) is the dietary pattern with the strongest evidence for its ability to prevent the same chronic diseases. In addition, micronutrients and extracts from several components and characteristic food of the MD can favorably modulate PAF's actions and metabolism either directly or indirectly. However, the role of this traditional diet on PAF metabolism and actions has rarely been studied before. This systematic review summarizes, presents and discusses the outcomes of epidemiologic and intervention studies in humans, investigating the relationships between PAF status and MD. Seventeen full-text articles trying to interlink the components of MD and PAF are found and presented. The results are inconsistent due to the variability of the measured indices and methodology followed. However, preliminary results indicate that the characteristic "healthy" components of the MD, especially, cereals, legumes, vegetables, fish and wine can favorably modulate the pro-inflammatory actions of PAF and regulate its metabolism. Larger, well-controlled studies are necessary to elucidate whether the attenuation of PAF actions can mediate the preventive properties of MD against chronic diseases.Copyright © 2018 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

Here, using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we explored the therapeutic effect of α-adrenergic receptor (AR) blockade on septic cardiomyopathy. CLP-induced septic rats were treated with BRL44408 (α-AR antagonist), prazosin (α-AR antagonist) and/or reserpine. CLP-induced cardiomyopathy, indicated by reduced dP/dt and increased cardiac troponin I phosphorylation, was attenuated by BRL44408, this was associated with reduced cardiac TNF-α and endothelial VCAM-1 expression, cardiomyocyte apoptosis and related signal molecule phosphorylation. BRL44408 increased cardiac norepinephrine (NE) concentration in CLP rats. Pretreatment with reserpine that exhausts cardiac NE without affecting the circulating NE concentration or with prazosin partially abolished the cardioprotection of BRL44408 and reversed its inhibitory effects on myocardial TNF-α, apoptosis and related signal molecule phosphorylation, but not on VCAM-1 expression in septic rats. These effects of BRL44408 were confirmed by α-AR gene deletion in septic mice. Furthermore, α-AR agonist not only enhanced LPS-induced TNF-α and VCAM-1 expression in cardiac endothelial cells that express α-AR, but also enhanced LPS-induced cardiac dysfunction in isolated rat hearts.

Its pathophysiology is complex, involving various mechanisms in vascular smooth muscle cells such as G protein-coupled receptor desensitization (adrenoceptors, vasopressin 1 receptors, angiotensin type 1 receptors), alteration of second messenger pathways, critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency, and increased production of nitric oxide. This review, based on a critical appraisal of the literature, discusses the main current treatments and future approaches. Our improved understanding of these mechanisms is progressively changing our therapeutic approach to vasoplegia from a standardized to a personalized multimodal treatment with the prescription of several vasopressors. While norepinephrine is confirmed as first line therapy for the treatment of vasoplegia, the latest Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines also consider that the best therapeutic management of vascular hyporesponsiveness to vasopressors could be a combination of multiple vasopressors, including norepinephrine and early prescription of vasopressin. This new approach is seemingly justified by the need to limit adrenoceptor desensitization as well as sympathetic overactivation given its subsequent deleterious impacts on hemodynamics and .

Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) has been investigated extensively in the context of cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the role of mTORC1 in NASH remains largely unknown.mTORC1 activity in macrophages in human mild and severe NASH liver was compared. Mice with macrophage-specific deletion of the regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (Raptor) subunit and littermate controls were fed a high-fructose, palmitate, and cholesterol diet for 24 weeks or a methionine- and choline-deficient diet for 4 weeks to develop NASH.We report that in human beings bearing NASH, macrophage mTORC1 activity was lower in livers experiencing severe vs mild NASH liver. Moreover, macrophage mTORC1 disruption exacerbated the inflammatory response in 2 diet-induced NASH mouse models. Mechanistically, in response to apoptotic hepatocytes (AHs), macrophage polarization toward a M2 anti-inflammatory phenotype was inhibited in Raptor-deficient macrophages. During the digestion of AHs, macrophage mTORC1 was activated and coupled with dynamin-related protein 1 to facilitate the latter's phosphorylation, leading to mitochondrial fission-mediated calcium release. Ionomycin or A23187, calcium ionophores, prevented Raptor deficiency-mediated failure of lysosome acidification and subsequent lipolysis. Blocking dynamin-related protein 1-dependent mitochondria fission impaired lysosome function, resulting in reduced production of anti-inflammatory factors such as interleukins 10 and 13.Persistent mTORC1 deficiency in macrophages contributes to the progression of NASH by causing lysosome dysfunction and subsequently attenuating anti-inflammatory M2-like response in macrophages during clearance of AHs.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Initial norepinephrine monotherapy was initiated between November 2015 and February 2016. Between March and June 2016, vasopressin was initiated within 4 hours of norepinephrine. The primary outcome was time to achieving and maintaining MAP of 65 mm Hg for at least 4 hours that was compared between groups using the Student t test and examined using the Kaplan-Meier curve (Clinical Trials registration: ).Eighty-two patients were included (41 in each group). Patients treated with early concomitant vasopressin and norepinephrine more frequently had a positive culture (59% vs 37%, p=0.05) and grew nonlactose fermenting gram-negative bacilli (34% vs 10%, p=0.01) compared with patients treated with norepinephrine monotherapy, respectively. The median time to achieve and maintain MAP occurred faster in the early concomitant vasopressin and norepinephrine group, at 5.7 hours (interquartile range [IQR] 1.7-10.3 hrs), compared with 7.6 hours (IQR 3.6-16.7 hrs, p=0.058) in the norepinephrine group. Durations of therapy for norepinephrine or vasopressin, amount of norepinephrine received in the first 24 hours, norepinephrine dosage when MAP was achieved and maintained, maximum norepinephrine dosage, and mortality were similar between groups.Patients treated with early concomitant vasopressin and norepinephrine achieved and maintained MAP of 65 mm Hg faster than those receiving initial norepinephrine monotherapy, suggesting that overcoming vasopressin deficiency sooner may reduce the time patients spend in the early phase of septic shock.© 2018 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30152906>Preventive effect of apigenin against isoproterenol-induced apoptosis in cardiomyoblasts.</a></h2><p>We investigated the effect of apigenin, a dietary flavonoid, on isoproterenol hydrochloride (ISO)-induced apoptotic signaling in cardiomyoblast H9C2 cells.

AA distributes differentially across membrane phospholipids, which is largely due to the action of coenzyme A-independent transacylase (CoA-IT), an enzyme that moves the fatty acid primarily from diacyl phospholipid species to ether-containing species, particularly the  plasmalogens. In this work, we examined the dependence of AA remodeling on plasmalogen content using the murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 and its plasmalogen-deficient variants RAW.12 and RAW.108. All three strains remodeled AA between phospholipids with similar magnitude and kinetics, thus demonstrating that cellular plasmalogen content does not influence the process. Cell stimulation with yeast-derived zymosan also had no effect on AA remodeling, but incubating the cells in AA-rich media markedly slowed down the process. Further, knockdown of cytosolic-group IVC phospholipase Aγ (cPLAγ) by RNA silencing significantly reduced AA remodeling, while inhibition of other major phospholipase A forms such as cytosolic phospholipase Aα, calcium-independent phospholipase Aβ, or secreted phospholipase A had no effect.

However, models that are useful for clinical practice must overcome the massive complexity of human physiology and the diversity of patients' environmental conditions. With the aim of modeling a complex disease, we choose sepsis, which is highly complex, life-threatening systemic disease with high mortality. In particular, we focused on septic shock, a subset of sepsis in which underlying circulatory and cellular/metabolic abnormalities are profound enough to substantially increase mortality. Our model includes cardiovascular, immune, nervous system models and a pharmacological model as submodels and integrates them to create a sepsis model based on pathological facts.Model validation was done in two steps. First, we established a model for a standard patient in order to confirm the validity of our approach in general aspects. For this, we checked the correspondence between the severity of infection defined in terms of pathogen growth rate and the ease of recovery defined in terms of the intensity of treatment required for recovery. The simulations for a standard patient showed good correspondence. We then applied the same simulations to a patient with heart failure as an underlying disease. The model showed that spontaneous recovery would not occur without treatment, even for a very mild infection. This is consistent with clinical experience. We next validated the model using clinical data of three sepsis patients. The model parameters were tuned for these patients based on the model for the standard patient used in the first part of the validation. In these cases, the simulations agreed well with clinical data. In fact, only a handful parameters need to be tuned for the simulations to match with the data.We have constructed a model of septic shock and have shown that it can reproduce well the time courses of treatment and disease progression. Tuning of model parameters for each patient could be easily done. This study demonstrates the feasibility of disease models, suggesting the possibility of clinical use in the prediction of disease progression, decisions on the timing of drug dosages, and the estimation of time of infection.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30851709>The therapeutic potential of ginkgolide K in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis via peripheral immunomodulation.</a></h2><p>Multiple sclerosis is a T cell-mediated inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, accompanied by neuronal degeneration.

The results showed that GK effectively ameliorated the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. The intervention of GK inhibited the infiltration of inflammatory cells and demyelination in the spinal cord.

In mouse spleen lymphocytes, GK increased the proportion of regulatory T cells (Treg) and reduced the proportion of T helper 17 cells (Th17), modifying the imbalance between Th17/Treg cells. Additionally, GK shifted macrophage/microglia polarization from M1 to M2 cell type. Importantly, GK inhibited the expression of chemotactic molecules CCL-2, CCL-3 and CCL-5, thereby limiting the migration of inflammatory cells to the spinal cord.

Additionally, we performed cremaster intravital microscopy to examine neutrophil-endothelial cell interactions following NA superfusion in vivo. In a separate group of animals, mice were subjected to an experimental model of stroke and at 4 and 24 h neutrophils were isolated for assessment on their ability to migrate toward various chemokines. Treatment of neutrophils with NA for 4 h significantly impaired neutrophil chemotaxis and induced an N2 neutrophil phenotype with reduced expression of the genes critical for cytoskeleton remodeling and . Prolonged NA administration promoted neutrophils to release myeloperoxidase and IL-6, but suppressed the production of interferon-γ and IL-10, reduced neutrophil activation and phagocytosis. Superfusion of NA over the cremaster muscle almost completely inhibited fMLP-induced neutrophil adhesion/arrest and transmigration. Furthermore, using a mouse model of stroke, a pathological condition in which SNS activation is evident, neutrophils isolated from poststroke mice showed markedly reduced chemotaxis toward all of the chemokines tested.

Fifteen-month male BN rats received 0, 0.5 or 1.5 μg/kg/day rilmenidine intraperitoneally for 90 days to lower sympathetic tone. Untreated young and age-matched rats controlled for effects of age. We found that elevated SNA in the aging BN rat spleen does not contribute significantly to sympathetic neuropathy or the aging-induced impairment of canonical β-AR signal transduction. Despite the rilmenidine-induced increase in β-AR expression, splenocyte c-AMP production was comparable with age-matched controls, thus dampening nerve activity had no effect on receptor coupling to adenylate cyclase. Understanding how aging affects neuroimmune regulation in healthy aging rodent models may eventually lead to strategies that improve health in aging populations vulnerable to immunosenescence and low-grade systemic .Copyright © 2018.

High-resolution, relational, resonance-based, electroencephalic mirroring (HIRREM®) is a noninvasive, closed-loop, allostatic, acoustic stimulation neurotechnology that produces real-time translation of dominant brain frequencies into audible tones of variable pitch and timing to support the auto-calibration of neural oscillations. We report clinical, autonomic, and functional effects after the use of HIRREM® for symptoms of military-related PTS.Eighteen service members or recent veterans (15 active-duty, 3 veterans, most from special operations, 1 female), with a mean age of 40.9 (SD = 6.9) years and symptoms of PTS lasting from 1 to 25 years, undertook 19.5 (SD = 1.1) sessions over 12 days. Inventories for symptoms of PTS (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist - Military version, PCL-M), insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index, ISI), depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, CES-D), and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale, GAD-7) were collected before (Visit 1, V1), immediately after (Visit 2, V2), and at 1 month (Visit 3, V3), 3 (Visit 4, V4), and 6 (Visit 5, V5) months after intervention completion. Other measures only taken at V1 and V2 included blood pressure and heart rate recordings to analyze heart rate variability (HRV) and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), functional performance (reaction and grip strength) testing, blood and saliva for biomarkers of stress and , and blood for epigenetic testing. Paired t-tests, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, and a repeated-measures ANOVA were performed.Clinically relevant, significant reductions in all symptom scores were observed at V2, with durability through V5. There were significant improvements in multiple measures of HRV and BRS [Standard deviation of the normal beat to normal beat interval (SDNN), root mean square of the successive differences (rMSSD), high frequency (HF), low frequency (LF), and total power, HF alpha, sequence all, and systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure] as well as reaction testing. Trends were seen for improved grip strength and a reduction in C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Angiotensin II to Angiotensin 1-7 ratio and Interleukin-10, with no change in DNA n-methylation. There were no dropouts or adverse events reported.Service members or veterans showed reductions in symptomatology of PTS, insomnia, depressive mood, and anxiety that were durable through 6 months after the use of a closed-loop allostatic neurotechnology for the auto-calibration of neural oscillations. This study is the first to report increased HRV or BRS after the use of an intervention for service members or veterans with PTS. Ongoing investigations are strongly warranted. , retrospectively registered July 25, 2017.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30690957>Huge Intramural Duodenal Hematoma Complicated with Obstructive Jaundice following Endoscopic Hemostasis.</a></h2><p>Intramural hematoma of the duodenum is a relatively unusual complication associated with the endoscopic treatment of bleeding peptic ulcers. Intramural hematomas are typically resolved spontaneously with conservative treatment alone. We report a case of an intramural duodenal hematoma following endoscopic hemostasis with epinephrine injection therapy, which was associated with transient obstructive jaundice in a patient undergoing hemodialysis. The patient developed biliary sepsis due to obstruction of the common bile duct secondary to the huge hematoma. He was treated with fluoroscopy-guided drainage catheter insertion, which spontaneously resolved the biliary sepsis through conservative treatment in 6 weeks. Fluoroscopy-guided drainage may impact the treatment of intramural hematomas that involve life-threatening complications.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29940406>Predictive value of serum albumin levels on noradrenaline and fluid requirements in the first 24 h after admission to the Intensive Care Unit - A prospective observational study.</a></h2><p>To determine the predictive value of serum albumin (SA) at admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) on the cumulative dose of noradrenaline, the fluids administered, the lactate level, and mortality during the first 24 h of ICU admission.A total of 100 ICU patients were included.

Epinephrine or dopamine was initiated at 0.2 or 10 μg/kg/min, respectively. If shock persisted after 15 min, epinephrine or dopamine was increased to 0.3 or 15 μg/kg/min, respectively (16-30 min), and thereafter to 0.4 or 20 μg/kg/min (31-45 min). Proportion of neonates achieving 'reversal of shock' (defined as systolic and diastolic BP > fifth centile and capillary filling time < 3 s and left ventricular output ≥ 150 mL/kg/min) by 45 min [5 (25%) vs 6 (30%), RR 0.83 (95% CI 0.30, 2.29)]; haemodynamic stability (shock reversal for ≥ 120 min without escalation of vasoactive drugs) anytime during therapy [10 (50%) vs 6 (30%), RR 1.67 (95% CI 0.75, 3.71)]; and all-cause mortality by 28 days [14 (70%) vs 16 (80%), RR 0.87 (95% CI 0.61, 1.26)] were comparable in the epinephrine and dopamine groups, respectively. On stratified analysis, we observed an interaction of gestational age strata with the group of allocation favouring epinephrine in neonates ≤ 30 weeks.Conclusion: Epinephrine (0.2-0.4 μg/kg/min) and dopamine (10-20 μg/kg/min) had comparable efficacy and safety in neonatal septic shock.Clinical Trial registry name and registration number: The study was registered with Clinical Trial Registry of India CTRI/2015/10/006285. What is Known: • The choice of vasoactive drugs in neonatal septic shock is empirical and dopamine is the conventional first-line vasoactive drug. • There are no randomized controlled trials comparing dopamine and epinephrine in neonatal septic shock. What is New: • In this study, epinephrine and dopamine had comparable efficacy and safety as a first-line vasoactive drug in management of neonatal septic shock. • On stratified analysis in a limited sample, epinephrine was associated with better outcomes in neonates ≤ 30 weeks.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29397598>[The clinical significance of microcirculation and oxygen metabolism evaluation in acute kidney injury assessment in patients with septic shock after resuscitation].</a></h2><p> To evaluate the value of microcirculation and oxygen metabolism evaluation (MicrOME) in acute kidney injury(AKI) evaluation in patients with septic shock after resuscitation.  Consecutive patients with septic shock after resuscitation and mechanical ventilation were enrolled from October 2016 to February 2017 in ICU at Peking Union Medical College Hospital.Patients were divided into 3 groups based on 10 min transcutaneous oxygen challenge test transcutaneous partial pressure of oxygen(PtcO(2))and venoarterial pressure of carbon dioxide difference (Pv-aCO(2)) /arteriovenous O(2) content difference (Ca-vO(2)) by blood gas analysis, i.e. group A [ΔPtcO(2)>66 mmHg(1 mmHg=0.133 kPa) and Pv-aCO(2)/Ca-vO(2)≤1.23], group B (ΔPtcO(2)≤66 mmHg), group C (ΔPtcO(2)>66 mmHg and Pv-aCO(2)/Ca-vO(2)>1.23). Heart rate,mean arterial pressure,central venous pressure,noradrenaline dose,lactate,Pv-aCO(2),Ca-vO(2), lactate clearance, central venous oxygen saturation(ScvO(2)) and liquid equilibrium were assessed after resuscitation.AKI staging based on Kidney Disease Global Improving Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guideline was analyzed. The predictive value of lactate, ScvO(2), Pv-aCO(2)/Ca-vO(2) to progression of AKI after resuscitation was determined using receiver operating characteristic(ROC)curve analysis.  A total of 49 septic shock patients were enrolled including 30 males and 19 females with mean age of (61.10±17.10)years old.There were 19 patients in group A,21 patients in group B, and 9 patients in group C. Acute physiology and chronic health evaluation Ⅱ score was 20.92±7.19 and sequential organ failure assessment score 12.02±3.28. There were 4 patients with AKI and 1 progressed in group A, 11 patients with AKI and 2 progressed in group B, 6 patients with AKI and 4 progressed in group C. The cutoff value of Pv-aCO(2)/Ca-vO(2) was equal or more than 2.20 for predicting progression of AKI, resulting in a sensitivity of 85.7% and a specificity of 73.8%.

Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) is closely related to mitochondrial function and oxidative stress. We found that NaHS increased SIRT3 expression in the preventive effect on isoproterenol- (ISO-) induced myocardial hypertrophy. We further investigated whether exogenous HS supplement improved ISO-induced myocardial hypertrophy in a SIRT3-dependent manner. 10-week-old male 129S1/SvImJ (WT) mice and SIRT3 knockout (KO) mice were intraperitoneally injected with NaHS (50 mol/kg/d) for two weeks and then intraperitoneally injected with ISO (60 mg/kg/d) for another two weeks. In WT mice, NaHS significantly reduced the cardiac index of ISO-induced mice, decreased the cross-sectional area of cardiomyocytes, and inhibited the expressions of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) mRNA. The activity of total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the myocardium was increased, but the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) was decreased. The fluorescence intensity of dihydroethidium staining for superoxide anion was attenuated. Optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) expression was upregulated, while dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) expression was downregulated. ERK, but not P38 and JNK, phosphorylation was downregulated. However, all above protective effects were unavailable in ISO-induced SIRT3 KO mice. Our present study suggested that exogenous HS supplement inhibited ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy depending on SIRT3, which might be associated with antioxidant stress.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30704272>Early May Be Better: Early Low-Dose Norepinephrine in Septic Shock.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29851906>Acute hyperglycemia exacerbates trauma-induced endothelial and glycocalyx injury: An in vitro model.</a></h2><p>Early hyperglycemia is associated with higher mortality in trauma and predicts multiple organ failure. Endothelial cell (EC) injury and glycocalyx (GC) degradation occur following traumatic shock and are key factors in the development of trauma-induced coagulopathy and result in impaired microvascular perfusion and accompanying organ failure. Acute hyperglycemia has been shown to result in the loss of the GC layer, EC , and activation of coagulation in vivo. We postulated that acute hyperglycemia would exacerbate trauma-induced EC injury and GC shedding and integrity. This was studied using a microfluidic device in a biomimetic in vitro model.Human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers established in the microfluidic channels of a microfluidic device well plate were perfused at constant shear overnight. Human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers were then exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation and epinephrine followed by the addition of varying concentrations of glucose.Glycocalyx shedding and loss of dimension, as well as EC injury/activation, were noted after exposure to the biomimetic conditions of trauma/shock in our study. Similar but less dramatic findings were noted after acute hyperglycemia. Exposure to hyperglycemia exacerbated the adverse effects on the GC and EC following hypoxia/reoxygenation plus epinephrine exposure and may be related to enhanced production of reactive oxygen species.Microfluidic device study may allow the preclinical assessment and development of therapeutic strategies of the vascular barrier under stress conditions.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31518521>Dynamics of the human skin mediator lipidome in response to dietary ω-3 fatty acid supplementation.</a></h2><p>Nutritional supplementation with fish oil or ω-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) has potential benefits for skin . Although the differential metabolism of the main n-3PUFA eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) could lead to distinct activities, there are no clinical studies comparing their relative efficacy in human skin. Following a 10-wk oral supplementation of healthy volunteers and using mass spectrometry-based lipidomics, we found that n-3PUFA mainly affected the epidermal mediator lipidome. EPA was more efficient than DHA in reducing production of arachidonic acid-derived lipids, and both n-3PUFA lowered -acyl . In UV radiation-challenged skin (3 times the minimum erythemal dose), EPA attenuated the production of proinflammatory lipids, whereas DHA abrogated the migration of Langerhans cells, as assessed by immunohistochemistry. Interestingly, n-3PUFA increased the infiltration of CD4 and CD8 T cells but did not alter the erythemal response, either the sunburn threshold or the resolution of erythema, as assessed by spectrophotometric hemoglobin index readings. As EPA and DHA differentially impact cutaneous  through changes in the network of epidermal lipids and dendritic and infiltrating immune cells, they should be considered separately when designing interventions for cutaneous disease.-Kendall, A.
