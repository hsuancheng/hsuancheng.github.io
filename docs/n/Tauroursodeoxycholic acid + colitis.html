However, little is known about their potential effects on intestinal homeostasis. In this study we examined the effect of some of these food additives on gut inflammation.Mice were given drinking water containing maltodextrin (MDX), propylene glycol, or animal gelatin, and then challenged with dextran sulfate sodium or indomethacin. In parallel, mice fed a MDX-enriched diet were given the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inhibitor  (TUDCA). Transcriptomic analysis, real-time polymerase chain reaction, mucin-2 expression, phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase quantification, and H&E staining was performed on colonic tissues. Mucosa-associated microbiota composition was characterized by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. For the in vitro experiments, murine intestinal crypts and the human mucus-secreting HT29-methotrexate treated cell line were stimulated with MDX in the presence or absence of TUDCA or a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor.Diets enriched in MDX, but not propylene glycol or animal gelatin, exacerbated intestinal inflammation in both models. Analysis of the mechanisms underlying the detrimental effect of MDX showed up-regulation of inositol requiring protein 1β, a sensor of ER stress, in goblet cells, and a reduction of mucin-2 expression with no significant change in mucosa-associated microbiota. Stimulation of murine intestinal crypts and HT29-methotrexate treated cell line cells with MDX induced inositol requiring protein 1β via a p38 MAP kinase-dependent mechanism. Treatment of mice with TUDCA prevented mucin-2 depletion and attenuated  in MDX-fed mice.MDX increases ER stress in gut epithelial cells with the downstream effect of reducing mucus production and enhancing  susceptibility.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

However, the exact mechanism by which bile acid therapy confers protection from colitogenesis is currently unknown. Since the gut microbiota plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of IBD, and exogenous bile acid administration may affect the community structure of the microbiota, we examined the impact of the secondary bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and its taurine or glycine conjugates on the fecal microbial community structure during experimental . Daily oral administration of UDCA,  (TUDCA), or glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) equally lowered the severity of dextran sodium sulfate-induced  in mice, as evidenced by reduced body weight loss, colonic shortening, and expression of inflammatory cytokines. Illumina sequencing demonstrated that bile acid therapy during  did not restore fecal bacterial richness and diversity. However, bile acid therapy normalized the -associated increased ratio of  to  Interestingly, administration of bile acids prevented the loss of  cluster XIVa and increased the abundance of , bacterial species known to be particularly decreased in IBD patients. We conclude that UDCA, which is an FDA-approved drug for cholestatic liver disorders, could be an attractive treatment option to reduce dysbiosis and ameliorate inflammation in human IBD. Secondary bile acids are emerging as attractive candidates for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Although bile acids may affect the intestinal microbial community structure, which significantly contributes to the course of these inflammatory disorders, the impact of bile acid therapy on the fecal microbiota during  has not yet been considered. Here, we studied the alterations in the fecal microbial abundance in colitic mice following the administration of secondary bile acids. Our results show that secondary bile acids reduce the severity of  and ameliorate -associated fecal dysbiosis at the phylum level. This study indicates that secondary bile acids might act as a safe and effective drug for inflammatory bowel disease.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19575493>Serum bile acid profiling reflects enterohepatic detoxification state and intestinal barrier function in inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>To determine free and conjugated serum bile acid (BA) levels in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) subgroups with defined clinical manifestations.Comprehensive serum BA profiling was performed in 358 IBD patients and 310 healthy controls by liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry.Serum levels of hyodeoxycholic acid, the CYP3A4-mediated detoxification product of the secondary BA lithocholic acid (LCA), was increased significantly in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative  (UC), while most other serum BA species were decreased significantly. Total BA, total BA conjugate, and total BA glycoconjugate levels were decreased only in CD, whereas total unconjugated BA levels were decreased only in UC. In UC patients with hepatobiliary manifestations, the conjugated primary BAs glycocholic acid, taurocholic acid, and glycochenodeoxycholic acid were as significantly increased as the secondary BAs LCA, ursodeoxycholic acid, and  compared to UC patients without hepatobiliary manifestations. Finally, we found that in ileocecal resected CD patients, the unconjugated primary BAs, cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, were increased significantly compared to controls and patients without surgical interventions.Serum BA profiling in IBD patients that indicates impaired intestinal barrier function and increased detoxification is suitable for advanced diagnostic characterization and differentiation of IBD subgroups with defined clinical manifestations.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29084077>Accumulation of HLA-DR4 in Colonic Epithelial Cells Causes Severe  in Homozygous HLA-DR4 Transgenic Mice.</a></h2><p>Homozygous HLA-DR4/I-E transgenic mice (tgm) spontaneously developed  similar to human ulcerative . We explored whether endoplasmic reticulum stress in colonic epithelial cells due to overexpression of HLA-DR4/I-E was involved in the pathogenesis of .Major histocompatibility complex class II transactivator-knockout (CIITAKO) background tgm were established to test the involvement of HLA-DR4/I-E expression in the pathogenesis of . Histological and cellular analyses were performed and the effect of oral administration of the molecular chaperone  (TUDCA) and antibiotics were investigated. IgA content of feces and serum and presence of IgA-coated fecal bacteria were also investigated.Aberrantly accumulated HLA-DR4/I-E molecules in colonic epithelial cells were observed only in the colitic homozygous tgm, which was accompanied by upregulation of the endoplasmic reticulum stress marker Binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) and reduced mucus. Homozygous tgm with CIITAKO, and thus absent of HLA-DR4/I-E expression, did not develop . Oral administration of TUDCA to homozygotes reduced HLA-DR4/I-E and BiP expression in colonic epithelial cells and restored the barrier function of the intestinal tract. The IgA content of feces and serum, and numbers of IgA-coated fecal bacteria were higher in the colitic tgm, and antibiotic administration suppressed the expression of HLA-DR4/I-E and .The pathogenesis of the  observed in the homozygous tgm was likely due to endoplasmic reticulum stress, resulting in goblet cell damage and compromised mucus production in the colonic epithelial cells in which HLA-DR4/I-E molecules were heavily accumulated.

Although numerous studies have analyzed the migration of absorptive epithelial cells during wound healing, it remains unclear how goblet cells restitute and how MUC2 mucin production affects this process. In this study, we examined the role of high MUC2 production in goblet cell migration during wound healing and demonstrated that during high MUC2 output, goblet cells migrated slower because of impaired production of wound healing factors and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Two goblet cell lines, HT29-H and HT29-L, that produced high and low MUC2 mucin, respectively, were used. HT29-L healed wounds faster than HT29-H cells by producing significantly higher amounts of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 1, FGF2, vascular endothelial growth factor-C, and matrix metallopeptidase 1. Predictably, treatment of HT29-H cells with recombinant FGF2 significantly enhanced migration and wound healing. High MUC2 biosynthesis in HT29-H cells induced ER stress and delayed migration that was abrogated by inhibiting ER stress with  and IL-22. FGF2- and IL-22-induced wound repair was dependent on STAT1 and STAT3 signaling. During wound healing after dextran sulfate sodium-induced , restitution of Math1 goblet cells occurred earlier in the proximal colon, followed by the middle and then distal colon, where ulceration was severe. We conclude that high MUC2 output during  impairs goblet cell migration and wound healing by reducing production of growth factors critical in wound repair.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

Accumulating evidence suggests that signaling through these receptors is impaired in inflammatory bowel disease. We investigated whether  (TUDCA), a secondary bile acid with cytoprotective properties, regulates ileal nuclear receptor and bile acid transporter expression and assessed its therapeutic potential in an experimental model of Crohn's disease (CD). Gene expression of the nuclear receptors farnesoid X receptor, pregnane X receptor and vitamin D receptor and the bile acid transporters apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter and organic solute transporter α and β was analyzed in Caco-2 cell monolayers exposed to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, in ileal tissue of TNF mice and in inflamed ileal biopsies from CD patients by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. TNF mice and wild-type littermates were treated with TUDCA or placebo for 11 weeks and ileal histopathology and expression of the aforementioned genes were determined. Exposing Caco-2 cell monolayers to TNFα impaired the mRNA expression of nuclear receptors and bile acid transporters, whereas co-incubation with TUDCA antagonized their downregulation. TNF mice displayed altered ileal bile acid homeostasis that mimicked the situation in human CD ileitis. Administration of TUDCA attenuated ileitis and alleviated the downregulation of nuclear receptors and bile acid transporters in these mice. These results show that TUDCA protects bile acid homeostasis under inflammatory conditions and suppresses CD-like ileitis. Together with previous observations showing similar efficacy in experimental , we conclude that TUDCA could be a promising therapeutic agent for inflammatory bowel disease, warranting a clinical trial.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25310532> inhibits experimental  by preventing early intestinal epithelial cell death.</a></h2><p>Ulcerative  (UC) is characterized by increased epithelial cell death and subsequent breakdown of the intestinal epithelial barrier, which perpetuates chronic intestinal inflammation. Since fecal bile acid dysmetabolism is associated with UC and  (TUDCA) has been shown to improve murine , we evaluated the effect of TUDCA on intestinal epithelial cell death in a mouse model of UC-like barrier dysfunction elicited by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). We identified the prevention of colonic caspase-3 induction, a key proapoptotic marker which was also over-activated in UC, as the earliest event resulting in a clear clinical benefit. Whereas vehicle-treated mice showed a cumulative mortality of 40%, all TUDCA-treated mice survived the DSS experiment during a 14-day follow-up period. In line with a barrier protective effect, TUDCA decreased bacterial translocation to the spleen and stimulated mucin production. Similarly, TUDCA inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced intestinal permeability and associated enterocyte apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic effect was confirmed in vitro by a dose-dependent inhibition of both receptor-dependent (using tumor necrosis factor and Fas ligand) and receptor-independent (staurosporine) caspase-3 induction in HT29 colonic epithelial cells. These data imply that caspase-3 activation is an early marker of  that is prevented by TUDCA treatment. These data, together with the previously reported beneficial effect in , suggest that TUDCA could be an add-on strategy to current immunosuppressive treatment of UC patients.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30378164> attenuates -associated colon cancer by inhibiting nuclear factor kappaB signaling.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases is associated with an increased risk for the development of colorectal cancer.

We report that the dysfunctional neutrophil may be derived by the suppression of Toll-interacting-protein (Tollip).
