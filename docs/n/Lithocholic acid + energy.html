To study the relationship between the molecular structures of those amphiphilic molecules, particularly the extended hydrophobic appendant (anchor) at the 3-hydroxyl group, and transfection efficiency, we synthesized several  and isolithocholic  derivatives, and examined their transfection efficiency. We also compared the physico-chemical properties of cationic liposomes prepared from these derivatives. We found that isolithocholic  derivatives exhibit higher transfection efficiency than the corresponding  derivatives. This result indicates that the orientation and extension of hydrophobic regions influence the gene transfection process. Isolithocholic  derivatives showed a high ability to encapsulate DNA in a compact liposome-DNA complex and to protect it from enzymatic degradation. Isolithocholic  derivatives also facilitated the release of DNA from the liposome-DNA complex, which is a crucial step for DNA entry into the nucleus. Our results show that the transfection efficiency is directly influenced by the ability of the liposome complex to release DNA, rather than by the DNA-encapsulating ability. Molecular modeling revealed that isolithocholic  derivatives take relatively extended conformations, while the  derivatives take folded structures. Thus, the efficiency of release of DNA from cationic liposomes in the cytoplasm, which contributes to high transfection efficiency, appears to be dependent upon the molecular shape of the cationic amphiphiles.</p><p>Keyword: energy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24296272>Tandem mass spectrometric characterization of bile acids and steroid conjugates based on low- collision-induced dissociation.</a></h2><p>We examined the characteristics of several bile acids and some steroid conjugates under low--collision-induced dissociation conditions using a triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer. According to conjugation types, we observed characteristic product ions and/or neutral losses in the product ion spectra. Amino  conjugates afforded specific product ions. For example, glycine-conjugated metabolites routinely produced a product ion at m/z 74, and taurine-conjugated metabolites produced product ions at m/z 124, 107, and 80. When a strong peak appeared at m/z 97, the molecule contained a sulfate group. In contrast to amino  conjugates, carbohydrate conjugates required a combination of product ions and neutral losses for identification. We could discriminate a glucoside from an acyl galactoside according to the presence or absence of a product ion at m/z 161 and a neutral loss of 180 Da. Discrimination among esters, aliphatic ethers, and phenolic ether types of glucuronides was based upon differences in the intensities of a product ion at m/z 175 and a neutral loss of 176 Da. Furthermore, N-acetylglucosamine conjugates showed a characteristic product ion at m/z 202 and a neutral loss of 203 Da, and the appearance of a product ion at m/z 202 revealed the existence of N-acetylglucosamine conjugated to an aliphatic hydroxyl group without a double bond in the immediate vicinity. Together, the data presented here will help to enable the identification of unknown conjugated cholesterol metabolites by using low- collision-induced dissociation.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Recent data suggest that faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) using faeces from postbariatric surgery diet-induced obese mice in germ-free mice improves glucose metabolism and intestinal homeostasis. We here investigated whether allogenic FMT using faeces from post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass donors (RYGB-D) compared with using faeces from  donors (METS-D) has short-term effects on glucose metabolism, intestinal transit time and adipose tissue inflammation in treatment-naïve, obese, insulin-resistant male subjects.Subjects with  (n=22) received allogenic FMT either from RYGB-D or METS-D. Hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity as well as lipolysis were measured at baseline and 2 weeks after FMT by hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic stable isotope (H-glucose and H-glycerol) clamp. Secondary outcome parameters were changes in resting energy expenditure, intestinal transit time, faecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and bile acids, and inflammatory markers in subcutaneous adipose tissue related to intestinal microbiota composition. Faecal SCFA, bile acids, glycaemic control and inflammatory parameters were also evaluated at 8 weeks.We observed a significant decrease in insulin sensitivity 2 weeks after allogenic METS-D FMT (median rate of glucose disappearance: from 40.6 to 34.0 µmol/kg/min; p<0.01). Moreover, a trend (p=0.052) towards faster intestinal transit time following RYGB-D FMT was seen. Finally, we observed changes in faecal bile acids (increased , deoxycholic and (iso) after METS-D FMT), inflammatory markers (decreased adipose tissue chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) gene expression and plasma CCL2 after RYGB-D FMT) and changes in several intestinal microbiota taxa.Allogenic FMT using METS-D decreases insulin sensitivity in  recipients when compared with using post-RYGB-D. Further research is needed to delineate the role of donor characteristics in FMT efficacy in human insulin-resistant subjects.NTR4327.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Besides their well-known function as detergents in lipid digestion, bile acids are important signaling molecules mediating effects on the host's metabolism.Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) are supplemented with 50 μmol L LCA either for 30 days or throughout their lifetime. LCA supplementation results in a significant induction of the mean (+12 days), median (+10 days), and maximum lifespan (+ 11 days) in comparison to untreated control flies. This lifespan extension is accompanied by an induction of spargel (srl), the fly homolog of mammalian PPAR-γ co-activator 1α (PGC1α). In wild-type flies, the administration of antibiotics abrogates both the LCA-mediated lifespan induction as well as the upregulation of srl.It is shown that the secondary bile  LCA significantly induces the mean, the median, and the maximum survival in D. melanogaster. Our data suggest that besides an upregulation of the PGC1α-homolog srl, unidentified alterations in the structure or metabolism of the gut microbiota contribute to the longevity effect mediated by LCA.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We therefore examined the effect of LPD on  (LCA)-induced intrahepatic cholestasis. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were fed LPD (8% casein) soon after weaning for 4 or 12 wk, and then were injected intravenously with a single dose of LCA (4 mumol/100 g body wt). Bile was collected for 30-min periods, and bile flow as well as biliary lipid secretory rates were measured. Bile  metabolism was also studied and the results were compared with those obtained in rats fed an adequate protein diet (26% casein). The LPD produced significantly lower bile flow and bile  secretion, which were attributed to a reduced bile  pool and a reduction in synthesis. They also enhanced the LCA-induced decline in bile flow, and rate of biliary output of total bile acids, phospholipids and cholesterol. The LPD were also associated with impaired LCA secretion in bile and increased retention in plasma and liver. Studies of LCA metabolism in rats fed a LPD indicated lower hepatic LCA hydroxylation, a greater percent contribution of glyco conjugates and lower levels of tauro conjugates. The present findings suggest that the reduced bile  pool size, diminished LCA excretion and biotransformation to less toxic bile acids may explain the greater cholestasis in LPD-fed rats.</p><p>Keyword: energy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28005388>Metadynamics for Perspective Drug Design: Computationally Driven Synthesis of New Protein-Protein Interaction Inhibitors Targeting the EphA2 Receptor.</a></h2><p>Metadynamics (META-D) is emerging as a powerful method for the computation of the multidimensional free-energy surface (FES) describing the protein-ligand binding process. Herein, the FES of unbinding of the antagonist N-(3α-hydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oyl)-l-β-homotryptophan (UniPR129) from its EphA2 receptor was reconstructed by META-D simulations. The characterization of the free-energy minima identified on this FES proposes a binding mode fully consistent with previously reported and new structure-activity relationship data. To validate this binding mode, new N-(3α-hydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oyl)-l-β-homotryptophan derivatives were designed, synthesized, and tested for their ability to displace ephrin-A1 from the EphA2 receptor. Among them, two antagonists, namely compounds 21 and 22, displayed high affinity versus the EphA2 receptor and resulted endowed with better physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties than the parent compound. These findings highlight the importance of free-energy calculations in drug design, confirming that META-D simulations can be used to successfully design novel bioactive compounds.</p><p>Keyword: energy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23022524>Activation of transmembrane bile  receptor TGR5 stimulates insulin secretion in pancreatic β cells.</a></h2><p>Bile acids act as signaling molecules and stimulate the G protein coupled receptor, TGR5, in addition to nuclear farnesoid X receptor to regulate lipid, glucose and  metabolism. Bile  induced activation of TGR5 in the enteroendocrine cells promotes glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) release, which has insulinotropic effect in the pancreatic β cells. In the present study, we have identified the expression of TGR5 in pancreatic β cell line MIN6 and also in mouse and human pancreatic islets. TGR5 selective ligands, oleanolic  (OA) and INT-777 selectively activated Gα(s) and caused an increase in intracellular cAMP and Ca(2+). OA and INT-777 also increased phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis and the increase was blocked by NF449 (a selective Gα(s) inhibitor) or U73122 (PI hydrolysis inhibitor). OA, INT-777 and  increased insulin release in MIN6 and human islets and the increase was inhibited by treatment with NF449, U73122 or BAPTA-AM (chelator of calcium), but not with myristoylated PKI (PKA inhibitor), suggesting that the release is dependent on G(s)/cAMP/Ca(2+) pathway. 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP, a cAMP analog, which activates Epac, but not PKA also stimulated PI hydrolysis. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the TGR5 expressed in the pancreatic β cells regulates insulin secretion and highlights the importance of ongoing therapeutic strategies targeting TGR5 in the control of glucose homeostasis.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><p>Keyword: energy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7253540>[Different effect of taurolithocholate and chenodeoxycholate on structure and function of isolated hepatocytes (author's transl)].</a></h2><p>Alterations of cellular membranes under the influence of bile acids seem to be of pathophysiological importance in cholestasis. The effect of taurolithocholic  (TLCA) and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) on membrane structure and release of cellular enzymes was studied on isolated rat hepatocytes. The response of urea synthesis to glucagon was used as a parameter of membrane function. The threshold dose of TLCA, marked by rapidly increasing enzyme release, was about 100 micrometers, whereas that of CDCA was between 500 and 1,000 micrometers. Addition of albumin (1 g-%) increased the threshold dose of CDCA; this occurred for TLCA only 8 g-%. Electron-microscopical alterations of the endoplasmic reticulum and submembranous areas were found with concentrations below these threshold doses even in the presence of albumin. These alterations are interpreted as disturbance of cellular transport and  metabolism. TLCA inhibited glucagon response of cells in concentrations below 100 micrometers. These results demonstrate an influence of the bile acids studied on structure and function of liver cell membranes, which may be of importance in the pathogenesis of cholestasis.

Thus, it is an attractive drug target for treating human metabolic disease. However, TGR5 is also highly expressed in gallbladder, where its functions are less well characterized. Here, we demonstrate that TGR5 stimulates the filling of the gallbladder with bile. Gallbladder volume was increased in wild-type but not Tgr5(-/-) mice by administration of either the naturally occurring TGR5 agonist, , or the synthetic TGR5 agonist, INT-777. These effects were independent of fibroblast growth factor 15, an enteric hormone previously shown to stimulate gallbladder filling. Ex vivo analyses using gallbladder tissue showed that TGR5 activation increased cAMP concentrations and caused smooth muscle relaxation in a TGR5-dependent manner. These data reveal a novel, gallbladder-intrinsic mechanism for regulating gallbladder contractility. They further suggest that TGR5 agonists should be assessed for effects on human gallbladder as they are developed for treating metabolic disease.</p><p>Keyword: energy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29751815>Changes in the faecal bile  profile in dogs fed dry food vs high content of beef: a pilot study.</a></h2><p>Dogs are fed various diets, which also include components of animal origin. In humans, a high-fat/low-fibre diet is associated with higher faecal levels of bile acids, which can influence intestinal health. It is unknown how an animal-based diet high in fat and low in fibre influences the faecal bile  levels and intestinal health in dogs. This study investigated the effects of high intake of minced beef on the faecal bile  profile in healthy, adult, client-owned dogs (n = 8) in a 7-week trial. Dogs were initially adapted to the same commercial dry food. Thereafter, incremental substitution of the dry food by boiled minced beef over 3 weeks resulted in a diet in which 75% of each dog's total  requirement was provided as minced beef during week 5. Dogs were subsequently reintroduced to the dry food for the last 2 weeks of the study. The total taurine and glycine-conjugated bile acids, the primary bile acids chenodeoxycholic  and cholic , and the secondary bile acids , deoxycholic  (DCA) and ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) were analysed, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.The faecal quantities of DCA were significantly higher in dogs fed the high minced beef diet. These levels reversed when dogs were reintroduced to the dry food diet. The faecal levels of UDCA and taurine-conjugated bile acids had also increased in response to the beef diet, but this was only significant when compared to the last dry food period.These results suggest that an animal-based diet with high-fat/low-fibre content can influence the faecal bile acids levels. The consequences of this for canine colonic health will require further investigation.</p><p>Keyword: energy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26004574>Impact of confinement on proteins concentrated in  based organic nanotubes.</a></h2><p>Organic nanotubes form in aqueous solution near physiological pH by self-assembly of  (LCA) with inner diameters of 20-40nm. The encapsulation of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) and resultant confinement effect for eGFP within these nanotubes is studied via confocal microscopy. Timed release rate studies of eGFP encapsulated in LCA nanotubes and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) indicate that the diffusive transport of eGFP out of and/or within the nanotubes is very slow, in contrast to the rapid introduction of eGFP into the nanotubes. By encapsulating two fluorescent proteins in LCA nanotubes, eGFP and mCherry, as a fluorescence resonance  transfer (FRET) pair, the FRET efficiencies are determined using FRET imaging microscopy at three different protein concentrations with a fixed donor-to-acceptor ratio of 1:1. Förster theory reveals that the proteins are spatially separated by 4.8-7.2nm in distance inside these nanotubes. The biomimetic nanochannels of LCA nanotubes not only afford a confining effect on eGFP that results in enhanced chemical and thermal stability under conditions of high denaturant concentration and temperature, but also function as protein concentrators for enriching protein in the nanochannels from a diluted protein solution by up to two orders of magnitude.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><p>Keyword: energy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29997324>Theoretical Model of EphA2-Ephrin A1 Inhibition.</a></h2><p>This work aims at the theoretical description of EphA2-ephrin A1 inhibition by small molecules.

Secondary bile acids are formed by the 7α-dehydroxylation of primary bile acids carried out by intestinal anaerobic bacteria. We have previously described a multistep biochemical pathway in Clostridium scindens that is responsible for bile  7α-dehydroxylation. We have identified a large (12 kb) bile  inducible (bai) operon in this bacterium that encodes eight genes involved in bile  7α-dehydroxylation. However, the function of the baiF gene product in this operon has not been elucidated. In the current study, we cloned and expressed the baiF gene in E. coli and discovered it has bile  CoA transferase activity. In addition, we discovered a second bai operon encoding three genes. The baiK gene in this operon was expressed in E. coli and found to encode a second bile  CoA transferase. Both bile  CoA transferases were determined to be members of the type III family by amino  sequence comparisons. Both bile  CoA transferases had broad substrate specificity, except the baiK gene product, which failed to use lithocholyl-CoA as a CoA donor. Primary bile acids are ligated to CoA via an ATP-dependent mechanism during the initial steps of 7α-dehydroxylation. The bile  CoA transferases conserve the thioester bond , saving the cell ATP molecules during bile  7α-dehydroxylation.

At the end of intervention, serum and hepatic cholesterol, triglyceride levels, hepatic gene expression of key regulators of cholesterol and lipid metabolism as well as fecal cholesterol and bile  excretion were determined.Dietary supplementation of the HF/HS diet with PomX and inulin decreased hepatic and serum total cholesterol. Supplementation with PomX and inulin together resulted in lower hepatic and serum total cholesterol compared to individual treatments. Compared to HF/HS control, PomX increased gene expression of Cyp7a1 and Cyp7b1, key regulators of bile  synthesis pathways. Inulin decreased gene expression of key regulators of cholesterol de novo synthesis Srebf2 and Hmgcr and significantly increased fecal elimination of total bile acids and neutral sterols. Only PomX in combination with inulin reduced liver and lipid weight significantly compared to the HF/HS control group. PomX showed a trend to decrease liver triglyceride (TG) levels, while inulin or PomX-inulin combination had no effect on either serum or liver TG levels.Dietary PomX and inulin supplementation decreased hepatic and serum total cholesterol by different mechanisms and the combination leading to a significant enhancement of the cholesterol-lowering effect.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TLCS induced a rapid serine phosphorylation of the regulatory subunit p47phox, which was sensitive to inhibition of sphingomyelinase and protein kinase Czeta (PKCzeta). Inhibitors of p47phox phosphorylation and p47phox protein knockdown abolished the TLCS-induced oxidative stress response and blunted subsequent CD95 activation. Consequences of TLCS-induced oxidative stress were c-Jun-N-terminal kinase activation and Yes-dependent activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), followed by EGFR-catalyzed CD95 tyrosine phosphorylation, formation of the death-inducing signaling complex, and execution of apoptosis. As shown by fluorescence resonance  transfer experiments in Huh7 cells, TLCS induced a c-Jun-N-terminal kinase-dependent EGFR/CD95 association in the cytosol and trafficking of this protein complex to the plasma membrane. Inhibition of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity by AG1478 allowed for cytosolic EGFR/CD95 association, but prevented targeting of the EGFR/CD95 complex to the plasma membrane. Both processes, and TLCS-induced Yes and EGFR activation, were sensitive to inhibition of sphingomyelinase, PKCzeta, or NADPH oxidases.The data suggest that hydrophobic bile salts activate NADPH oxidase isoforms with the resulting oxidative stress response triggering activation of the CD95 system and apoptosis.</p><p>Keyword: energy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11018682>Gene transfection activities of amphiphilic steroid-polyamine conjugates.</a></h2><p>The design and evaluation of a novel potent class of DNA delivery agents based on steroid-polyamine conjugates bearing a flexible linker are reported.

Although transcriptional regulation by VDR has been investigated intensively, an understanding of ligand-selective dynamic VDR conformations remains elusive. Here, we examined ligand-dependent dynamic interactions of VDR with retinoid X receptor (RXR), steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1), and silencing mediator of retinoic  and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT) in cells using fluorescence resonance  transfer (FRET) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays.

In the absence of ligand, VDR homodimers were preferred to RXR heterodimers and were associated with SMRT. 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) induced heterodimerization with RXR, dissociation of SMRT, and association of SRC-1. LCA and ADTT induced those effects to a lesser extent at concentrations that did not induce expression of the VDR target gene CYP24A1 in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. Unlike in HEK293 cells, ADTT increased CYP24A1 expression in HCT116 cells and increased the association of VDR and SMRT on the CYP24A1 promoter. The results indicate that ligand-selective conformation may lead to unique cofactor complex formation in a cell context-dependent manner.

Thus, cholic  (CA), with three hydroxyls, starts forming aggregates at 15 mM, while deoxycholic, chenodeoxycholic or ursodeoxycholic acids, with two hydroxyls, start aggregating at 5-10 mM; for , with only one hydroxyl group, aggregation is observed at lower concentration (2-3 mM). Here, the singular self-assembling properties of dansyl and naproxen derivatives of CA (3β-Dns-CA and 3β-NPX-CA, respectively) have been demonstrated on the basis of their photoactive properties. Thus, the emission spectra of 3β-Dns-CA registered at increasing concentrations (25-140 μM) showed a remarkable non-linear enhancement in the emission intensity accompanied by a hypsochromic shift of the maximum and up to a three-fold increase in the singlet lifetime. The inflection point at around 50-70 μM pointed to the formation of unprecedented assemblies at such low concentrations. In the case of 3β-NPX-CA, when the NPX relative triplet lifetime was plotted against concentration, a marked increase (up to two-fold) was observed at 40-70 μM, indicating the formation of new 3β-NPX-CA assemblies at ca. 50 μM. Additional evidence supporting the formation of new 3β-Dns-CA or 3β-NPX-CA assemblies at 40-70 μM was obtained from singlet excited state quenching experiments using iodide. Moreover, to address the potential formation of hybrid assemblies, 1 : 1 mixtures of 3β-Dns-CA and 3β-NPX-CA (2-60 μM, total concentration) were subjected to steady-state fluorescence experiments, and their behavior was compared to that of the pure photoactive derivatives. A lower increase in the emission was observed for 3β-NPX-CA in the mixture, while a huge increase was experienced by 3β-Dns-CA in the same concentration range (up to 60 μM total). A partial intermolecular  transfer from NPX to Dns, consistent with their reported singlet energies, was revealed, pointing to the formation of extremely fluorescent hybrid assemblies at 5-10 μM (total concentration). The morphology of the entities was investigated by means of confocal microscopy. At 90 μM, 3β-Dns-CA showed disperse assemblies in the μm range.</p><p>Keyword: energy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29233934>Chronic infusion of taurolithocholate into the brain increases fat oxidation in mice.</a></h2><p>Bile acids can function in the postprandial state as circulating signaling molecules in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism via the transmembrane receptor TGR5 and nuclear receptor FXR. Both receptors are present in the central nervous system, but their function in the brain is unclear. Therefore, we investigated the effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of taurolithocholate (tLCA), a strong TGR5 agonist, and GW4064, a synthetic FXR agonist, on  metabolism. We determined the effects of chronic i.c.v. infusion of tLCA, GW4064, or vehicle on  expenditure, body weight and composition as well as tissue specific fatty  uptake in mice equipped with osmotic minipumps. We found that i.c.v. administration of tLCA (final concentration in cerebrospinal fluid: 1 μM) increased fat oxidation (tLCA group: 0.083 ± 0.006 vs control group: 0.036 ± 0.023 kcal/h,  = 5.46,  = 0.04) and decreased fat mass (after 9 days of tLCA infusion: 1.35 ± 0.13 vs controls: 1.96 ± 0.23 g,  = 0.03). These changes were associated with enhanced uptake of triglyceride-derived fatty acids by brown adipose tissue and with browning of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. I.c.v. administration of GW4064 (final concentration in cerebrospinal fluid: 10 μM) did not affect  metabolism, body composition nor bile  levels, negating a role of FXR in the central nervous system in metabolic control.

Approximately one-third of the world's population is overweight or obese, and in the United States alone, obesity affects one in six children. Meta-analysis studies suggest that obesity increases the likelihood of developing several types of cancer, and with poorer outcomes, especially in children. The contribution of obesity to cancer risk requires a better understanding of the association between obesity-induced metabolic changes and its impact on genomic instability, which is a major driving force of tumorigenesis. In this review, we discuss how molecular changes during adipose tissue dysregulation can result in oxidative stress and subsequent DNA damage. This represents one of the many critical steps connecting obesity and cancer since oxidative DNA lesions can result in cancer-associated genetic instability. In addition, the by-products of the oxidative degradation of lipids (e.g., malondialdehyde, 4-hydroxynonenal, and acrolein), and gut microbiota-mediated secondary bile  metabolites (e.g., deoxycholic  and ), can function as genotoxic agents and tumor promoters. We also discuss how obesity can impact DNA repair efficiency, potentially contributing to cancer initiation and progression. Finally, we outline obesity-related epigenetic changes and identify the gaps in knowledge to be addressed for the development of better therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of obesity-related cancers.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: energy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29262229>Physiology, Bile Secretion.</a></h2><p>Bile, an aqueous solution produced and secreted by the liver, consists mainly of bile salts, phospholipids, cholesterol, conjugated bilirubin, electrolytes, and water. Bile travels through the liver in a series of ducts, eventually exiting through the common hepatic duct. Bile flows through this duct into the gallbladder where it is concentrated and stored. When stimulated by the hormone cholecystokinin (CCK), the gallbladder contracts, pushing bile through the cystic duct and into the common bile duct.  Simultaneously, the sphincter of Oddi relaxes, permitting bile to enter the duodenal lumen. The hormone secretin also plays an important role in the flow of bile into the small intestine. By stimulating biliary and pancreatic ductular cells to secrete bicarbonate and water in response to the presence of  in the duodenum, secretin effectively expands the volume of bile entering the duodenum. In the small intestine, bile acids facilitate lipid digestion and absorption. Only approximately 5% of these bile acids are eventually excreted. The majority of bile acids are efficiently reabsorbed from the ileum, secreted into the portal venous system, and returned to the liver in a process known as enterohepatic recirculation.[1][2][3]   Bile is produced by hepatocytes, which is then modified by the cholangiocytes lining the bile ducts. The production and secretion of bile require active transport systems within hepatocytes and cholangiocytes in addition to a structurally and functionally intact biliary tree. Initially, hepatocytes produce bile by secreting conjugated bilirubin, bile salts, cholesterol, phospholipids, proteins, ions, and water into their canaliculi (thin tubules between adjacent hepatocytes that eventually join to form bile ducts). The canalicular membrane of the hepatocyte is the main bile secretory apparatus which contains the intracellular organelles, the cytoskeleton of the hepatocyte and carrier proteins. The carrier proteins in the canalicular membrane transport bile  and ions. Transporter proteins found within the canalicular membrane use  to secrete molecules into bile against concentration gradients. Through this active transport, osmotic and electrochemical gradients are formed. When conjugated bile salts enter the canaliculus, water follows by osmosis. The electrochemical gradient allows for the passive diffusion of inorganic ions such as sodium. The most significant promoter of bile formation is the passage of conjugated bile salts into the biliary canaliculus. The total bile flow in a day is approximately 600 ml, of which 75% is derived from the hepatocyte, and 25% is from the cholangiocytes. Approximately half of the hepatocyte component of bile flow (about 225 ml per day) is bile salt-dependent and the remaining half bile salt independent. Osmotically active solutes such as glutathione and bicarbonate promote bile salt independent bile flow.[4][5] Canaliculi empty bile into ductules or cholangioles or canals of Hering. The ductules connect with interlobular bile ducts, which are accompanied by branches of the portal vein and hepatic artery forming portal triads. Bile is subsequently modified by ductular epithelial cells as it passes through the biliary tree. These cells, known as cholangiocytes, dilute and alkalinize the bile through hormone-regulated absorptive and secretory processes. The cholangiocytes have receptors which modulate the bicarbonate-rich ductular bile flow, which is regulated by hormones. These receptors include receptors for secretin, somatostatin, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) and chloride-bicarbonate exchanger.  For example, when secretin stimulates receptors in the cholangiocyte, a cascade is initiated which activates the CFTR chloride channel and allows the exchange of bicarbonate for chloride. In contrast, somatostatin inhibits the cAMP synthesis within the cholangiocytes causing the opposite effect. While bombesin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, acetylcholine, and secretin enhances bile flow, somatostatin, gastrin, insulin, and endothelin inhibit the flow.[6]  Cholesterol catabolism by hepatocytes results in the synthesis of the 2 major primary bile acids, cholic , and chenodeoxycholic . This process involves multiple steps, with cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase acting as the rate-limiting enzyme. Primary bile acids undergo dehydroxylation by bacteria in the small intestine, forming the secondary bile acids deoxycholic  and , respectively.  Both primary and secondary bile acids are conjugated by the liver with an amino , either glycine or taurine. Conjugated bile acids are known as bile salts. Bile salts inhibit cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase, decreasing the synthesis of bile acids. Despite the increased water solubility of bile salts, they are amphipathic molecules overall. This critical property allows them to effectively emulsify lipids and form micelles with the products of lipid digestion. The bile  pool is maintained via mainly the enterohepatic circulation and to a small extent (about 5%) by hepatic synthesis of bile acids, as long as the daily fecal loss of bile acids do not exceed 20% of the pool.Copyright © 2019, StatPearls Publishing LLC.</p><p>Keyword: energy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21797258>Dansyl labeling to modulate the relative affinity of bile acids for the binding sites of human serum albumin.</a></h2><p>Binding of natural bile acids to human serum albumin (HSA) is an important step in enterohepatic circulation and provides a measure of liver function. In this article, we report on the use of four dansyl (Dns) derivatives of cholic  (ChA) to demonstrate a regiodifferentiation in their relative affinity for the two binding sites of HSA. Using both steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence, formation of Dns-ChA@HSA complexes was confirmed; the corresponding binding constants were determined, and their distribution between bulk solution and HSA microenvironment was estimated. By means of  transfer from Trp to the Dns moiety, donor-acceptor distances were estimated (21-25 Å) and found to be compatible with both site 1 and site 2 occupancies. Nevertheless, titration using warfarin and ibuprofen as specific displacement probes clearly indicated that 3α- and 3β-Dns-ChA bind to HSA at site 2, whereas their C-7 regioisomers bind to HSA at site 1. Furthermore, the C-3-labeled compounds are displaced by , whereas they are insensitive to ChA, confirming the assumption that the former binds to HSA at site 2. Thus, Dns labeling provides a useful tool to modulate the relative affinity of ChA to the major binding sites of HSA and, in combination with other fluorescent ChA analogs, to mimic the binding behavior of natural bile acids.</p><p>Keyword: energy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3593707>The passive permeability properties of in vivo perfused rat jejunum.</a></h2><p>The polarity of the microvillus membrane of rat and rabbit jejunum, determined in vitro by the incremental free  changes associated with the addition of -CH2 groups to fatty acids or -OH groups to bile acids, has been found to be more polar than other biological membranes. The reason for the difference in polarity is unexplained but could be due to artifacts caused by the in vitro conditions. In the current studies the apparent permeability coefficients were determined for a homologous series of fatty acids and bile acids in in vivo perfused rat jejunum. The true permeability coefficients were derived by correction for diffusion barrier resistance. The incremental free  changes associated with the addition of a -CH2 group to a fatty  and a -OH group to a bile  were -619 and +2069 cal/mol, respectively. These values correspond to values determined in other biological membranes such as erythrocytes and adipocytes. Thus, the rat microvillus membrane is more nonpolar than previously observed in vitro. The reason for the discrepancy between the in vivo and in vitro results is most likely due to an underestimation of the permeability coefficients in the in vitro studies.</p><p>Keyword: energy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31179489>Comparison of diets enriched in stearic, oleic, and palmitic acids on , immune response, cardiometabolic risk factors, and fecal bile  concentrations in mildly hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women-randomized crossover trial.</a></h2><p>Direct comparisons between SFAs varying in chain length, specifically palmitic  (16:0) and stearic  (18:0), relative to the latter's metabolic product, oleic  (18:1), on cardiometabolic risk factors are limited.The aim of this study was to determine the relative comparability of diets enriched in palmitic , stearic , and oleic  on  and coagulation markers, T lymphocyte proliferation/ex-vivo cytokine secretion, plasma cardiometabolic risk factors, and fecal bile  concentrations.Hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women (n = 20, mean ± SD age 64 ± 7 y, BMI 26.4 ± 3.4 kg/m2, LDL cholesterol ≥ 2.8 mmol/L) were provided with each of 3 diets [55% energy (%E) carbohydrate, 15%E protein, 30%E fat, with ∼50% fat contributed by palmitic , stearic , or oleic  in each diet; 5 wk/diet phase] using a randomized crossover design with 2-wk washouts between phases.

Immediately on institution of caloric restriction there appeared to be an influx of tissue cholesterol into plasma and a reduction in endogenous synthesis of cholesterol.
