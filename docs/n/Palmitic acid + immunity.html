Its biological actions are primarily mediated by PPAR-α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors α) and the orphan receptor GPR55. Palmitoylethanolamide exerts potent anti-inflammatory actions but its physiological role and promise as a therapeutic agent in chronic arterial inflammation, such as atherosclerosis remain unexplored. Approach and Results- First, the polarization of mouse primary macrophages towards a proinflammatory phenotype was found to reduce N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D expression and palmitoylethanolamide bioavailability. N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D expression was progressively downregulated in the aorta of apolipoprotein E deficient (ApoE) mice during atherogenesis. N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D mRNA levels were also downregulated in unstable human plaques and they positively associated with smooth muscle cell markers and negatively with macrophage markers. Second, ApoE mice were fed a high-fat diet for 4 or 16 weeks and treated with either vehicle or palmitoylethanolamide (3 mg/kg per day, 4 weeks) to study the effects of palmitoylethanolamide on early established and pre-established atherosclerosis. Palmitoylethanolamide treatment reduced plaque size in early atherosclerosis, whereas in pre-established atherosclerosis, palmitoylethanolamide promoted signs of plaque stability as evidenced by reduced macrophage accumulation and necrotic core size, increased collagen deposition and downregulation of M1-type macrophage markers. Mechanistically, we found that palmitoylethanolamide, by activating GPR55, increases the expression of the phagocytosis receptor MerTK (proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase MER) and enhances macrophage efferocytosis, indicative of proresolving properties. Conclusions- The present study demonstrates that palmitoylethanolamide protects against atherosclerosis by promoting an anti-inflammatory and proresolving phenotype of lesional macrophages, representing a new therapeutic approach to resolve arterial inflammation.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29728958>Comparative compositional analysis of transgenic potato resistant to potato tuber moth (PTM) and its non-transformed counterpart.</a></h2><p>In this study, the compositions of transgenic potatoes (TPs) resistant to potato tuber moth (Phthorimaea operculella) were compared with those of its non-transgenic (NTP) counterparts. The light inducible promoter, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase led to the expression of Cry1Ab only in the leaves and light-treated tubers of the TPs. No significant differences were found in the moisture, ash, dry weight, total soluble protein, carbohydrate, starch, fiber, ascorbate, cations, anions, fatty acids, and glycoalkaloids contents of TP and NTP. Moreover, light treatment significantly affected the contents of ascorbate, acetate and nitrite anions, , stearic and linolenic fatty acids, α-haconine and α-solanine glycoalkaloids in TP and NTP tubers. While, significant differences were observed in the amino  contents in light-treated tubers of TPs than the NTP ones. Although, light treatment in potato tubers resulted in marked metabolic changes, all the variations observed in the metabolites compositions were found to be within the desired reference ranges for potato plants. In conclusion, the results indicated that the TPs were substantially and nutritionally equivalent to the NTP counterparts.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28045026>Saturated  induces myocardial inflammatory injuries through direct binding to TLR4 accessory protein MD2.</a></h2><p>Obesity increases the risk for a number of diseases including cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. Excess saturated fatty acids (SFAs) in obesity play a significant role in cardiovascular diseases by activating innate  responses. However, the mechanisms by which SFAs activate the innate immune system are not fully known. Here we report that  (PA), the most abundant circulating SFA, induces myocardial inflammatory injury through the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) accessory protein MD2 in mouse and cell culture experimental models. Md2 knockout mice are protected against PA- and high-fat diet-induced myocardial injury. Studies of cell surface binding, cell-free protein-protein interactions and molecular docking simulations indicate that PA directly binds to MD2, supporting a mechanism by which PA activates TLR4 and downstream inflammatory responses. We conclude that PA is a crucial contributor to obesity-associated myocardial injury, which is likely regulated via its direct binding to MD2.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840369>[The individual fatty acids of blood plasma: biological role of substrates, parameters of quantity and quality, diagnostic of atherosclerosis and atheromotosis.]</a></h2><p>The atherosclerosis and atheromotosis are supposed to be, according to phylogenetic theory of general pathology, two etiologically different aphysiological processes, unified by community of pathogenesis.

The interference of symbiotic bacteria with insect host immune responses is fairly well documented. However, knowledge of mechanisms regulating parasite–host interactions still remains fragmentary. In this study, we used nematode (Steinernema carpocapsae and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora) cuticles and Galleria mellonella larvae as parasite–host model, focused on the changes of innate immune parameters of the host in the early phase of nematode cuticle infection and investigated the role of eicosanoid biosynthesis pathway in the process. The results showed that injection of either S. carpocapsae or H. bacteriophora cuticles into the larval hemocoel both resulted in significant decreases in the key innate immune parameters (e.g., hemocyte density, microaggregation, phagocytosis and encapsulation abilities of hemocyte, and phenoloxidase and antibacterial activities of the cell-free hemolymph). Our study indicated that the parasite cuticles could actively suppress the innate immune response of the G. mellonella host. We also found that treating G. mellonella larvae with dexamethasone and indomethacin induced similar depression in the key innate immune parameters to the nematode cuticles. However, these effects were reversed when dexamethasone, indomethacin, or nematode cuticles were injected together with arachidonic . Additionally, we found that  did not reverse the influence of the dexamethasone, indomethacin, or nematode cuticles on the innate immune responses. Therefore, we inferred from our results that both S. carpocapsae and H. bacteriophora cuticles inhibited eicosanoid biosynthesis to induce host immunodepression.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31120334>Fatty  metabolism in the host and commensal bacteria for the control of intestinal immune responses and diseases.</a></h2><p>Intestinal tissue has a specialized immune system that exhibits an exquisite balance between active and suppressive responses important for the maintenance of health. Intestinal  is functionally affected by both diet and gut commensal bacteria. Here, we review the effects of fatty acids on the regulation of intestinal  and immunological diseases, revealing that dietary fatty acids and their metabolites play an important role in the regulation of allergy, inflammation, and immunosurveillance in the intestine. Several lines of evidence have revealed that some dietary fatty acids are converted to biologically active metabolites by enzymes not only in the host but also in the commensal bacteria.

We tested whether PAHSAs protect against colitis, which is a chronic inflammatory disease driven predominantly by defects in the innate mucosal barrier and adaptive immune system. There is an unmet clinical need for safe and well tolerated oral therapeutics with direct anti-inflammatory effects. Wild-type mice were pretreated orally with vehicle or 5-PAHSA (10 mg/kg) and 9-PAHSA (5 mg/kg) once daily for 3 days, followed by 10 days of either 0% or 2% dextran sulfate sodium water with continued vehicle or PAHSA treatment. The colon was collected for histopathology, gene expression, and flow cytometry. Intestinal crypt fractions were prepared for ex vivo bactericidal assays. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells pretreated with vehicle or PAHSA and splenic CD4 T cells from syngeneic mice were co-cultured to assess antigen presentation and T cell activation in response to LPS. PAHSA treatment prevented weight loss, improved colitis scores (stool consistency, hematochezia, and mouse appearance), and augmented intestinal crypt Paneth cell bactericidal potency via a mechanism that may involve GPR120. In vitro, PAHSAs attenuated dendritic cell activation and subsequent T cell proliferation and Th1 polarization. The anti-inflammatory effects of PAHSAs in vivo resulted in reduced colonic T cell activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression. These anti-inflammatory effects appear to be partially GPR120-dependent. We conclude that PAHSA treatment regulates innate and adaptive immune responses to prevent mucosal damage and protect against colitis. Thus, PAHSAs may be a novel treatment for colitis and related inflammation-driven diseases.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29601102>Frontline Science: Specialized proresolving lipid mediators inhibit the priming and activation of the macrophage NLRP3 inflammasome.</a></h2><p>The prototypic proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β plays a central role in innate immunity and inflammatory disorders. The formation of mature IL-1β from an inactive pro-IL-1β precursor is produced via nonconventional multiprotein complexes called the inflammasomes, of which the most common is the nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome composed by NLRP3, (ASC) apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD), and caspase-1. Specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs) promote resolution of , which is an essential process to maintain host health. SPMs prevent excessive  by terminating the inflammatory response and returning to tissue homeostasis without immunosupression. This study tested the hypothesis that modulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages is one mechanism involved in the SPM-regulated processes during resolution. Our findings demonstrate that the SPM resolvin D2 (RvD2) suppressed the expression of pro-IL-1β and reduced the secretion of mature IL-1β in bone marrow-derived macrophages challenged with LPS+ATP (classical NLRP3 inflammasome model) or LPS+palmitate (lipotoxic model). Similar findings were observed in thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages, in which RvD2 remarkably reduced ASC oligomerization, inflammasome assembly, and caspase-1 activity. In vivo, in a self-resolving zymosan A-induced peritonitis model, RvD2 blocked the NLRP3 inflammasome leading to reduced release of IL-1β into the exudates, repression of osteopontin, and MCP-1 expression and induction of M2 markers of resolution (i.e., CD206 and arginase-1) in peritoneal macrophages. RvD2 inhibitory actions were receptor mediated and were abrogated by a selective GPR18 antagonist. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that SPMs have the ability to inhibit the priming and to expedite the deactivation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages during the resolution process.©2018 Society for Leukocyte Biology.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29463677>An unexpected link between fatty  synthase and cholesterol synthesis in proinflammatory macrophage activation.</a></h2><p>Different immune activation states require distinct metabolic features and activities in immune cells. For instance, inhibition of fatty  synthase (FASN), which catalyzes the synthesis of long-chain fatty acids, prevents the proinflammatory response in macrophages; however, the precise role of this enzyme in this response remains poorly defined. Consistent with previous studies, we found here that FASN is essential for lipopolysaccharide-induced, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated macrophage activation. Interestingly, only agents that block FASN upstream of acetoacetyl-CoA synthesis, including the well-characterized FASN inhibitor C75, inhibited TLR4 signaling, while those acting downstream had no effect. We found that acetoacetyl-CoA could overcome C75's inhibitory effect, whereas other FASN metabolites, including palmitate, did not prevent C75-mediated inhibition. This suggested an unexpected role for acetoacetyl-CoA in  that is independent of its role in palmitate synthesis. Our evidence further suggested that acetoacetyl-CoA arising from FASN activity promotes cholesterol production, indicating a surprising link between fatty  synthesis and cholesterol synthesis. We further demonstrate that this process is required for TLR4 to enter lipid rafts and facilitate TLR4 signaling. In conclusion, we have uncovered an unexpected link between FASN and cholesterol synthesis that appears to be required for TLR signal transduction and proinflammatory macrophage activation.© 2018 Carroll et al.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27693020>Novel lipopeptides of ESAT-6 induce strong protective  against Mycobacterium tuberculosis: Routes of immunization and TLR agonists critically impact vaccine's efficacy.</a></h2><p>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the bacterial cause of tuberculosis, is a leading infectious agent worldwide. The development of a new vaccine against Mtb is essential to control global spread of tuberculosis, since the current vaccine BCG is not very effective and antibiotic resistance is a serious, burgeoning problem. ESAT-6 is a secreted protein of Mtb, which is absent in BCG but has been implicated in inducing protective  against Mtb. Peptide based subunit vaccines are attractive due to their safety and high specificity in eliciting immune responses, but small synthetic peptides are usually not very immunogenic. We have designed a novel subunit vaccine for Mtb by using simple lipid () modified derivatives of peptides from ESAT-6 protein corresponding to dominant human T cell epitopes and examined their ability to stimulate protective  against Mtb by intranasal and subcutaneous immunization in mice. We also investigated how individual TLR agonists as adjuvants (PolyI:C, MPL and GDQ) contribute to enhancing the induced immune responses and resulting protective efficacy of our vaccine. We observed that single C-terminal palmitoyl-lysine modified lipopeptides derived from ESAT-6 induce significant cellular immune responses on their own upon mucosal and subcutaneous immunizations. Intriguingly, a combination of immunogenic lipopeptides of ESAT-6 antigen exhibited local (pulmonary) and systemic immune responses along with efficient protective efficacy when administered intranasally or subcutaneously. Surprisingly, combination of ESAT-6 derived lipopeptides with a TLR-4 agonist (MPL) enhanced protection, whereas TLR-3 (Poly I:C) and TLR-7/8 agonists (gardiquimod, GDQ) led to reduced protection associated with specific local and systemic immune modulation. Our studies demonstrate the potential of ESAT-6 derived lipopeptides as a promising vaccine candidate against Mtb, and emphasize that selection of adjuvant is critical for the success of vaccines. These findings demonstrate the promise of synthetic lipopeptides as the basis of a subunit vaccine for TB.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Emerging evidence implicates long noncoding RNAs in , but their role in macrophage dysfunction associated with inflammatory diabetic complications is unclear and was therefore investigated in this study. Approach and Results- RNA-sequencing and real-time quantitative PCR demonstrated that a long noncoding RNA Dnm3os (dynamin 3 opposite strand) is upregulated in bone marrow-derived macrophages from type 2 diabetic db/db mice, diet-induced insulin-resistant mice, and diabetic ApoE mice, as well as in monocytes from type 2 diabetic patients relative to controls. Diabetic conditions (high glucose and ) induced Dnm3os in mouse and human macrophages. Promoter reporter analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that diabetic conditions induce Dnm3os via NF-κB activation. RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization and real-time quantitative PCRs of subcellular fractions demonstrated nuclear localization and chromatin enrichment of Dnm3os in macrophages. Stable overexpression of Dnm3os in macrophages altered global histone modifications and upregulated  and immune response genes and phagocytosis. Conversely, RNAi-mediated knockdown of Dnm3os attenuated these responses. RNA pull-down assays with macrophage nuclear lysates identified nucleolin and ILF-2 (interleukin enhancer-binding factor 2) as protein binding partners of Dnm3os, which was further confirmed by RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization immunofluorescence. Furthermore, nucleolin levels were decreased in diabetic conditions, and its knockdown enhanced Dnm3os-induced inflammatory gene expression and histone H3K9-acetylation at their promoters. Conclusions- These results demonstrate novel mechanisms involving upregulation of long noncoding RNA Dnm3os, disruption of its interaction with nucleolin, and epigenetic modifications at target genes that promote macrophage inflammatory phenotype in diabetes mellitus.

G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) is involved in the development of IR and obesity in vivo. However, its possible contribution to NAFLD and/or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) independently of its role on IR or fat mass accretion has not been explored. Here, we used wild-type (WT) or GRK2 hemizygous (GRK2±) mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or a methionine and choline-deficient diet (MCD) as a model of NASH independent of adiposity and IR. GRK2± mice were protected from HFD-induced NAFLD. Moreover, MCD feeding caused an increased in triglyceride content and liver-to-body weight ratio in WT mice, features that were attenuated in GRK2± mice. According to their NAFLD activity score, MCD-fed GRK2± mice were diagnosed with simple steatosis and not overt NASH. They also showed reduced expression of lipogenic and lipid-uptake markers and less signs of inflammation in the liver. GRK2± mice preserved hepatic protective mechanisms as enhanced autophagy and mitochondrial fusion and biogenesis, together with reduced endoplasmic reticulum stress. GRK2 protein was increased in MCD-fed WT but not in GRK2± mice, and enhanced GRK2 expression potentiated -triggered lipid accumulation in human hepatocytes directly relating GRK2 levels to steatosis.

Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) plays an important role in innate  and inflammation although its role in high fat diet-induced obesity cardiac dysfunction remains elusive. This study was designed to examine the effect of TLR4 ablation on high fat diet intake-induced cardiac anomalies, if any, and underlying mechanism(s) involved. Wild-type (WT) and TLR4 knockout mice were fed normal or high fat (60% calorie from fat) diet for 12weeks prior to assessment of mechanical and intracellular Ca properties. The inflammatory signaling proteins (TLR4, NF-κB, and JNK) and autophagic markers (Atg5, Atg12, LC3B and p62) were evaluated. Our results revealed that high fat diet intake promoted obesity, marked decrease in fractional shortening, and cardiomyocyte contractile capacity with dampened intracellular Ca release and clearance, elevated ROS generation and oxidative stress as measured by aconitase activity, the effects of which were significantly attenuated by TLR4 knockout. In addition, high fat intake downregulated levels of Atg5, Atg12 and LC3B, while increasing p62 accumulation. TLR4 knockout itself did not affect Atg5, Atg12, LC3B and p62 levels while it reconciled high fat diet intake-induced changes in autophagy. In addition, TLR4 knockout alleviated high fat diet-induced phosphorylation of IKKβ, JNK and mTOR. In vitro study revealed that  suppressed cardiomyocyte contractile function, the effect of which was inhibited the TLR4 inhibitor CLI-095, the JNK inhibitor AS601245 or the NF-κB inhibitor Celastrol. Taken together, these data showed that TLR4 knockout ameliorated high fat diet-induced cardiac contractile and intracellular Ca anomalies through inhibition of inflammation and ROS, possibly through a NF-κB/JNK-dependent activation of autophagy.

Some mice develop diet-induced obesity (DIO), but others remain diet resistant (DR) despite intake of the same high-saturated-fat diet, a phenomenon that mimics characteristics of the human obese phenotype. Microbiota-colon-brain axis regulation is important for energy metabolism and cognition. Using DIO and DR mouse models, this study aimed to examine gut microbiota, colonic inflammation and cognitive function to elucidate the role of microbiota-gut-brain regulation in DIO. C57Bl6/J mice fed a chronic saturated- diet for 22 weeks showed significant body weight gain differences, with the top one third gaining 48% heavier body weight than the lower one third. There was significant reduction in gut microbiota richness and diversity in DIO mice but not in DR mice. At the phylum level, DIO mice had increased abundance of Firmicutes and Antinobacteria, and decreased abundance of Bacterioides and Proteobacteria in gut microbiota. DIO mice exhibited reduced tight junction proteins, increased plasma endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and increased inflammation in the colon and liver.

Further examination showed that hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor was significantly decreased in DIO mice (vs. DR). Conversely, DR mice showed no changes in the above parameters measured.

Interestingly, it is an accumulation of M2 macrophages that is observed in the adipose, liver and lung tissues, as well as in the circulation, of patients who have had major traumas such as a burn injury or sepsis; however, the trigger for the M2 polarization observed in these patients has not yet been identified. In the current study, we explored the effects of chronic palmitate and high glucose treatment on macrophage differentiation and function in murine bone-marrow-derived macrophages. We found that chronic treatment with palmitate decreased phagocytosis and HLA-DR expression in addition to inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Chronic palmitate treatment of bone marrows also led to M2 polarization, which correlated with the activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ signalling pathway. Furthermore, we found that chronic palmitate treatment increased the expression of multiple endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers, including binding immunoglobulin protein. Preconditioning with the universal ER stress inhibitor 4-phenylbutyrate attenuated ER stress signalling and neutralized the effect of palmitate, inducing a pro-inflammatory phenotype. We confirmed these results in differentiating human macrophages, showing an anti-inflammatory response to chronic palmitate exposure. Though alone it did not promote M2 polarization, hyperglycaemia exacerbated the effects of palmitate. These findings suggest that the dominant accumulation of M2 in adipose tissue and liver in patients with critical illness may be a result of hyperlipidaemia and hyperglycaemia, both components of the hypermetabolism observed in critically ill patients.© 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28094778>Adipocyte Fatty  Binding Protein Potentiates Toxic Lipids-Induced Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Macrophages via Inhibition of Janus Kinase 2-dependent Autophagy.</a></h2><p>Lipotoxicity is implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity-related inflammatory complications by promoting macrophage infiltration and activation. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and adipocyte fatty  binding protein (A-FABP) play key roles in obesity and mediate inflammatory activity through similar signaling pathways. However, little is known about their interplay in lipid-induced inflammatory responses. Here, we showed that prolonged treatment of  (PA) increased ER stress and expression of A-FABP, which was accompanied by reduced autophagic flux in macrophages. Over-expression of A-FABP impaired PA-induced autophagy associating with enhanced ER stress and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, while genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of A-FABP reversed the conditions. PA-induced expression of autophagy-related protein (Atg)7 was attenuated in A-FABP over-expressed macrophages, but was elevated in A-FABP-deficient macrophages. Mechanistically, A-FABP potentiated the effects of PA by inhibition of Janus Kinase (JAK)2 activity, thus diminished PA-induced Atg7 expression contributing to impaired autophagy and further augmentation of ER stress. These findings suggest that A-FABP acts as autophagy inhibitor to instigate toxic lipids-induced ER stress through inhibition of JAK2-dependent autophagy, which in turn triggers inflammatory responses in macrophages. A-FABP-JAK2 axis may represent an important pathological pathway contributing to obesity-related inflammatory diseases.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28726347>MD2 Blockage Protects Obesity-Induced Vascular Remodeling via Activating AMPK/Nrf2.</a></h2><p>Obesity and increased free fatty  (FFA) levels are tightly linked with vascular oxidative stress and remodeling.

However, it is not clear whether MD2 plays a role in noninflammatory systems such as obesity- and FFA-related oxidative stress involved in vascular remodeling and injury. The aim of this study is to examine whether MD2 participates in reactive oxygen species increase and vascular remodeling.Male MD2 mice and wild-type littermates with a C57BL/6 background were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) to establish obesity-induced vascular remodeling. Rat aortic endothelial cells (RAECs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were treated with PA to induce oxidative stress and injury.In vivo, MD2 deficiency significantly reduced HFD-induced vascular oxidative stress, fibrosis, and remodeling, accompanied with AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) activation and nuclear factor erythroid (Nrf2) upregulation. In VSMCs and RAECs, inhibition of MD2 by neutralizing monoclonal antibody to MD2 or small interfering RNA knockdown significantly activated the AMPK/Nrf2-signaling pathway and reduced PA-induced oxidative stress and cell injury.It was demonstrated that the deletion or inhibition of MD2 protects against HFD/FFA-induced vascular oxidative stress and remodeling by activating the AMPK/Nrf2-signaling pathway.© 2017 The Obesity Society.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25916503>Long-term persistence of  induced by OVA-coupled gas-filled microbubble vaccination partially protects mice against infection by OVA-expressing Listeria.</a></h2><p>Vaccination aims at generating memory immune responses able to protect individuals against pathogenic challenges over long periods of time.

Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, which is critical for innate , is generally believed to aggravate disease progression by inducing inflammation. Unexpectedly, we found that deficiency in TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-β (TRIF), a cytosolic adaptor that transduces some TLR signals, worsened hepatic steatosis induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) and that such exacerbation was independent of myeloid cells. The aggravated steatosis in  mice was due to the increased hepatocyte transcription of the gene encoding stearoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) desaturase 1 (SCD1), the rate-limiting enzyme for lipogenesis. Activation of the TRIF pathway by polyinosinic:polycytidylic  [poly(I:C)] suppressed the increase in SCD1 abundance induced by  or an HFD and subsequently prevented lipid accumulation in hepatocytes.

Resistance to FHB is highly complex and quantitative in nature, and is most often classified as resistance to spikelet infection and resistance to spread of pathogen through the rachis. In the present study, a resistant (CI9831) and a susceptible (H106-371) two-row barley genotypes, with contrasting levels of spikelet resistance to FHB, pathogen or mock-inoculated, were profiled for metabolites based on liquid chromatography and high resolution mass spectrometry. The key resistance-related (RR) metabolites belonging to fatty acids, phenylpropanoids, flavonoids and terpenoid biosynthetic pathways were identified. The free fatty acids (FFAs) linoleic and  acids were among the highest fold change RR induced (RRI) metabolites. These FFAs are deposited as cutin monomers and oligomers to reinforce the cuticle, which acts as a barrier to pathogen entry. Quantitative real-time PCR studies revealed higher expressions of KAS2, CYP86A2, CYP89A2, LACS2 and WAX INDUCER1 (HvWIN1) transcription factor in the pathogen-inoculated resistant genotype than in the susceptible genotype. Knockdown of HvWIN1 by virus-induced genes silencing (VIGS) in resistant genotype upon pathogen inoculation increased the disease severity and fungal biomass, and decreased the abundance of FFAs like linoleic and  acids. Notably, the expression of CYP86A2, CYP89A2 and LAC2 genes was also suppressed, proving the link of HvWIN1 in regulating these genes in cuticle biosynthesis as a defense response.© The Author 2016.

One of the typically recognised bacterial components are lipids in conjugation with peptides, proteins and saccharides. Lipidic compounds are readily recognised by the immune system, and thus are ideal candidates for peptide-based vaccine delivery. Thus, bacterial or synthetic lipids mixed with, or conjugated to, antigens have shown adjuvanting properties. These systems have many advantages over traditional adjuvants, including low toxicity and good efficacy for stimulating mucosal and systemic immune responses.The most recent literature on the role of lipids in stimulation of immune responses was selected for this review. The vast majority of reviewed papers were published in the last decade. Older but significant findings are also cited.This review focuses on development of lipopeptide vaccine systems including application of , bacterial lipopeptides, glycolipids and the lipid core peptide and their routes of administration.

Biochemical approaches revealed that the Siglec ligands are fungal alkanes and triacylglycerols, an unexpected finding that prompted us to search for endogenous lipid ligands of Siglecs. Siglec5 weakly recognized several endogenous lipids, but the mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin and the anti-inflammatory lipid 5--hydroxy stearic  exhibited potent ligand activity on Siglec5. Further, the hydrophobic stretch in the Siglec5 N-terminus region was found to be required for efficient recognition of these lipids.

Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) have recently been identified as important regulators of immunity and . In nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), HIF-1α is upregulated in hepatocytes, where it induces steatosis; however, the role of HIF-1α in macrophages under metabolic stress has not been explored. In this study, we found increased HIF-1α levels in hepatic macrophages in methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet-fed mice and in macrophages of patients with NASH compared with controls. The HIF-1α increase was concomitant with elevated levels of autophagy markers BNIP3, Beclin-1, LC3-II, and p62 in both mouse and human macrophages. LysM HIF fl/fl mice, which have HIF-1α levels stabilized in macrophages, showed higher steatosis and liver  compared with HIF fl/fl mice on MCD diet. In vitro and ex vivo experiments reveal that saturated fatty ,  (PA), both induces HIF-1α and impairs autophagic flux in macrophages. Using small interfering RNA-mediated knock-down and overexpression of HIF-1α in macrophages, we demonstrated that PA impairs autophagy via HIF-1α. We found that HIF-1α mediates NF-κB activation and MCP-1 production and that HIF-1α-mediated impairment of macrophage autophagy increases IL-1β production, contributing to MCD diet-induced NASH. Conclusion:  impairs autophagy via HIF-1α activation in macrophages. HIF-1α and impaired autophagy are present in NASH in vivo in mouse macrophages and in human blood monocytes.

Released sphingosine is absorbed, phosphorylated to S1P, and converted to  via S1P-lyase in the gut mucosa. Hypothetically, S1P also may be released from absorptive cells and exert important paracrine actions favoring epithelial integrity and renewal, as well as immune function, including secretory IgA production and migration of T lymphocyte subpopulations. Gluco-, galacto-, and lactosylceramide are hydrolyzed to ceramide by lactase-phlorizin hydrolase, which also hydrolyzes lactose. Gangliosides may adhere to the brush border and is internalized, modified, and possibly transported into blood, and may exert protective functions by their interactions with bacteria, bacterial toxins, and the brush border.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Immunohistochemistry was used to analyse the macrophage subsets. Human peripheral blood monocytes were differentiated in the presence of either supernatant from human SZ95 sebocytes or major sebum lipid components and activated with Propionibacterium acnes. Macrophage surface markers and their capacity to uptake fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated P. acnes were detected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting measurements. Cytokine protein levels were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analysis.Sebaceous gland-rich skin had an increased dermal lipid content vs. sebaceous gland-poor skin to which all the tested sebum component lipids could contribute by penetrating the dermoepidermal barrier. Of the lipids, oleic  and linoleic  promoted monocyte differentiation into alternatively activated macrophages. Moreover, linoleic  also had an anti-inflammatory effect in P. acnes-activated macrophages, inhibiting the secretion of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Squalene, , stearic  and oleic  augmented the secretion of IL-1β, even in the absence of P. acnes, whereas oleic  had a selective effect of inducing IL-1β but downregulating IL-6 and TNF-α secretion.Our results suggest a role for sebaceous glands in modulating innate immune responses via their secreted lipids that are of possible pathological and therapeutic relevance.© 2017 British Association of Dermatologists.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26975571>Isoliquiritigenin Attenuates Adipose Tissue Inflammation in vitro and Adipose Tissue Fibrosis through Inhibition of Innate Immune Responses in Mice.</a></h2><p>Isoliquiritigenin (ILG) is a flavonoid derived from Glycyrrhiza uralensis and potently suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome activation resulting in the improvement of diet-induced adipose tissue inflammation. However, whether ILG affects other pathways besides the inflammasome in adipose tissue inflammation is unknown. We here show that ILG suppresses adipose tissue inflammation by affecting the paracrine loop containing saturated fatty acids and TNF-α by using a co-culture composed of adipocytes and macrophages. ILG suppressed inflammatory changes induced by the co-culture through inhibition of NF-κB activation. This effect was independent of either inhibition of inflammasome activation or activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ. Moreover, ILG suppressed TNF-α-induced activation of adipocytes, coincident with inhibition of IκBα phosphorylation. Additionally, TNF-α-mediated inhibition of Akt phosphorylation under insulin signaling was alleviated by ILG in adipocytes. ILG suppressed -induced activation of macrophages, with decreasing the level of phosphorylated Jnk expression. Intriguingly, ILG improved high fat diet-induced fibrosis in adipose tissue in vivo. Finally, ILG inhibited TLR4- or Mincle-stimulated expression of fibrosis-related genes in stromal vascular fraction from obese adipose tissue and macrophages in vitro. Thus, ILG can suppress adipose tissue inflammation by both inflammasome-dependent and -independent manners and attenuate adipose tissue fibrosis by targeting innate immune sensors.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29030820>Investigating Cellular Quiescence of T Lymphocytes and Antigen-Induced Exit from Quiescence.</a></h2><p>Naïve T cells are in a quiescent state under homeostasis but respond to antigen stimulation by exiting from quiescence and entering the cell cycle. Appropriate regulation of quiescence is crucial for maintaining T cell homeostasis at steady state and initiating proper T cell responses to antigen stimulation. Emerging evidence indicates that signaling by mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays a central role in the control of T cell quiescence and antigen-induced exit from quiescence through coordinating immune signals, cellular metabolic programs, and cell cycle machinery. The mTOR-dependent regulation of quiescence has also been implicated in the differentiation and function of memory T cells. In this chapter, we describe techniques to assess quiescent state of naïve T cells under steady state and exit from quiescence upon TCR stimulation.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31247319>Elevated biosynthesis of  is required for zebrafish against Edwardsiella tarda infection.</a></h2><p>Mechanisms by which vaccines enhance  to combat bacterial pathogens are not fully understood. Recently, we have found that live Edwardsiella tarda vaccine enhances ability against the bacterial challenge by metabolic modulation in zebrafish. Here we first explored the metabolic modulation promoted by inactivated E. tarda to eliminate the pathogen. Inactivated E. tarda vaccine modulated a similar metabolome to combat with the pathogen in zebrafish as live E. tarda vaccine did. Specifically, both vaccines promoted biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and the TCA cycle. However, due to relatively higher activated TCA cycle in inactivated vaccine than live vaccine, live vaccine promoted higher abundance of palmitate than inactivated vaccine. Consistently, the protection against E. tarda challenge was palmitate dose-dependent. Live vaccine activated higher expression of IL-1β, IL-8,Cox-2 genes and lower expression of IL-15, IL-21 genes than inactivated vaccine, which is similar to the results stimulated by high and low doses of palmitate, respectively. These findings indicate live and inactivated E. tarda vaccines stimulate differential abundances of palmitate that contribute to differential innate immunities against bacterial infection. Thus, metabolic environment contributes to immune response.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, the influence of an elevated growth temperature and heat shock on the phospholipid and fatty  (FA) compositions of the fractionated Yersinia pseudotuberculosis envelope was investigated. The shift of the growth temperature from 8 °C to 37 °C to mimic the switch from saprophytic to parasitic growth of this bacteria and the exposure of the cells to heat shock, which was induced by a sharp increase in the temperature from 8 °C to 45 °C, increased the lysophosphatidylethanolamine content from zero and 1% to 6% and 10% in the IM and OM, respectively. These changes were accompanied by a decrease in the phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) content and a drastic increase (up to 3-fold higher) in the phosphatidylglycerol (PG) level in the OM of the bacteria, which increases the net negative charge of the cell envelope. The levels of the predominant saturated  (16:0) and cyclopropane FAs were approximately 1.5- and 7.5-fold higher, respectively, but the content of the predominant unsaturated palmitoleic (16:1n-7) and cis-vaccenic (18:1n-7) FAs was approximately 10-30-fold lower in both membranes that were isolated from the cells grown at elevated temperatures. Due to these changes, reflecting the process of "homeoviscous adaptation", the ratio between the unsaturated and saturated FAs decreased but remained higher in the IM than that in the OM. Simultaneously, no significant changes were observed in the FA composition of cells subjected to heat shock, demonstrating a difference between the responses of the heat-shocked and heat-adapted Y. pseudotuberculosis. The unique ability of Y. pseudotuberculosis to reciprocally regulate the ratio of anionic PG and net neutral PE and therefore adjust the negative charge of the OM may be a common strategy used by pathogenic bacteria to promote the barrier function of the OM.Copyright © 2016.

Our hypothesis was that fatty  status during infancy is related to type 1 diabetes-associated autoimmunity and that long-chain n-3 fatty acids, in particular, are associated with decreased risk.We performed a nested case-control analysis within the Finnish Type 1 Diabetes Prediction and Prevention Study birth cohort, carrying HLA-conferred susceptibility to type 1 diabetes (n = 7782). Serum total fatty  composition was analysed by gas chromatography in 240 infants with islet autoimmunity and 480 control infants at the age of 3 and 6 months. Islet autoimmunity was defined as repeated positivity for islet cell autoantibodies in combination with at least one of three selected autoantibodies. In addition, a subset of 43 infants with primary insulin autoimmunity (i.e. those with insulin autoantibodies as the first autoantibody with no concomitant other autoantibodies) and a control group (n = 86) were analysed. A third endpoint was primary GAD autoimmunity defined as GAD autoantibody appearing as the first antibody without other concomitant autoantibodies (22 infants with GAD autoimmunity; 42 infants in control group). Conditional logistic regression was applied, considering multiple comparisons by false discovery rate <0.05.Serum fatty  composition differed between breastfed and non-breastfed infants, reflecting differences in the fatty  composition of the milk. Fatty acids were associated with islet autoimmunity (higher serum pentadecanoic, , palmitoleic and docosahexaenoic acids decreased risk; higher arachidonic:docosahexaenoic and n-6:n-3  ratios increased risk). Furthermore, fatty acids were associated with primary insulin autoimmunity, these associations being stronger (higher palmitoleic , cis-vaccenic, arachidonic, docosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids decreased risk; higher α-linoleic  and arachidonic:docosahexaenoic and n-6:n-3  ratios increased risk). Moreover, the quantity of breast milk consumed per day was inversely associated with primary insulin autoimmunity, while the quantity of cow's milk consumed per day was directly associated.Fatty  status may play a role in the development of type 1 diabetes-associated autoimmunity. Fish-derived fatty acids may be protective, particularly during infancy. Furthermore, fatty acids consumed during breastfeeding may provide protection against type 1 diabetes-associated autoimmunity. Further studies are warranted to clarify the independent role of fatty acids in the development of type 1 diabetes.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25418321>Direct interaction, instrumental for signaling processes, between LacCer and Lyn in the lipid rafts of neutrophil-like cells.</a></h2><p>Lactosylceramide [LacCer; β-Gal-(1-4)-β-Glc-(1-1)-Cer] has been shown to contain very long fatty acids that specifically modulate neutrophil properties. The interactions between LacCer and proteins and their role in cell signaling processes were assessed by synthesizing two molecular species of azide-photoactivable tritium-labeled LacCer having acyl chains of different lengths. The lengths of the two acyl chains corresponded to those of a short/medium and very long fatty , comparable to the lengths of stearic and lignoceric acids, respectively. These derivatives, designated C18-[(3)H]LacCer-(N3) and C24-[(3)H]LacCer-(N3), were incorporated into the lipid rafts of plasma membranes of neutrophilic differentiated HL-60 (D-HL-60) cells. C24-[(3)H]LacCer-(N3), but not C18-[(3)H]LacCer-(N3), induced the phosphorylation of Lyn and promoted phagocytosis. Incorporation of C24-[(3)H]LacCer-(N3) into plasma membranes, followed by illumination, resulted in the formation of several tritium-labeled LacCer-protein complexes, including the LacCer-Lyn complex, into plasma membrane lipid rafts. Administration of C18-[(3)H]LacCer-(N3) to cells, however, did not result in the formation of the LacCer-Lyn complex. These results suggest that LacCer derivatives mimic the biological properties of natural LacCer species and can be utilized as tools to study LacCer-protein interactions, and confirm a specific direct interaction between LacCer species containing very long fatty acids, and Lyn protein, associated with the cytoplasmic layer via myristic/ chains.Copyright © 2015 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28767204>Blockade of myeloid differentiation protein 2 prevents obesity-induced inflammation and nephropathy.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a major and independent risk factor of kidney diseases. The pathogenic mechanisms of obesity-associated renal injury are recognized to at least involve a lipid-rich and pro-inflammatory state of the renal tissues, but specific mechanisms establishing causal relation remain unknown. Saturated fatty acids are elevated in obesity, and known to induce chronic inflammation in kidneys. Myeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD2) is an important protein in lipopolysaccharide-induced innate  response and inflammation. We suggested that obesity-associated renal injury is regulated by MD2 thereby driving an inflammatory renal injury. The used three mouse models for in vivo study: MD2 knockout mice (KO) maintained on high fat diet (HFD), wild-type mice on HFD plus L6H21, a specific MD2 inhibitor and KO mice given  (PA) by IV injection. The in vitro studies were carried out in cultured renal tubular epithelial cells, mouse mesangial cells and primary macrophages, respectively. The HFD mice presented with increased hyperlipidemia, serum creatinine and proteinuria. Renal tissue from HFD mice had increased fibrosis, inflammatory cytokines, macrophage infiltration, and activation of NF-κB and MAPKs. This HFD-induced renal injury profile was not observed in KO mice or L6H21-treated mice. Mice given PA mimmicked the HFD-induced renal injury profiles, which were prevented by MD2 knockout. The in vitro data further confirmed MD2 mediates PA-induced inflammation. MD2 is causally related with obesity-associated renal inflammatory injury. We believe that MD2 is an attractive target for future therapeutic strategies in obesity-associated kidney diseases.© 2017 The Authors.

The most appropriate formulations were assessed for mannosylation using FTIR, XPS, SEM coupled with EDX analysis, and wettability assay, in comparison with the respective non-functionalized SLNas. Besides, cytotoxicity and cell internalization ability were established on J774 murine macrophage cell line. Mannosylated SLNas exhibited physical properties suitable for alveolar macrophage passive targeting, adequate rifampicin payloads (10-15%), and feasible drug maintenance within SLNas along the respiratory tract before macrophage internalization. Despite respirability impaired by powder cohesiveness, surface mannosylation provided quicker macrophage phagocytosis, giving evidence of an active targeting promotion.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The [1-(13)C]PA and [13-(13)C]PA tracers were administered with food in random order with each diet, and we assessed PA oxidation (PA OX) and serum AC concentration to determine whether a higher PA intake promoted incomplete PA OX. Dietary PA was completely oxidized during the HOA diet, but only about 40% was oxidized during the HPA diet. The [13-(13)C]PA/[1-(13)C]PA ratio of PA OX had an approximate value of 1.0 for either diet, but the ratio of the serum concentrations of MCACs to long-chain ACs (LCACs) was significantly higher during the HPA diet. Thus, direct measurement of PA OX did not confirm that the HPA diet caused incomplete PA OX, despite the modest, but statistically significant, increase in the ratio of MCACs to LCACs in blood.Copyright © 2015 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29054595>The N-Acylethanolamine  Amidase Inhibitor ARN077 Suppresses  and Pruritus in a Mouse Model of Allergic Dermatitis.</a></h2><p>N-acylethanolamine  amidase (NAAA), a cysteine hydrolase highly expressed in macrophages and B lymphocytes, catalyzes the degradation of palmitoylethanolamide. Palmitoylethanolamide is an agonist of PPAR-α and an important regulator of pain and innate immunity. In this study, we investigated the properties of the NAAA inhibitor, ARN077, in a mouse model of allergic contact dermatitis. Acute topical applications of ARN077 attenuated key signs of DNFB-induced dermatitis in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, ARN077 increased tissue palmitoylethanolamide content and normalized circulating levels of cytokines and immunoglobulin E. No such effect was seen in PPAR-α-deficient mice. Moreover, mice lacking NAAA failed to develop edema or scratching behavior after challenge with DNFB, confirming that this enzyme plays an important role in dermatitis. Consistent with this conclusion, subchronic applications of ARN077 suppressed DNFB-induced  when administered either before or after the DNFB challenge. The effects of subchronic ARN077 were dose dependent and comparable in size to those produced by the steroids clobetasol and dexamethasone. Unlike the latter, however, ARN077 did not cause skin atrophy. The results identify NAAA as a promising target for the development of effective and safe treatments for atopic dermatitis and other inflammatory disorders of the skin.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.
