We hypothesized that unsaturated FA could alleviate saturated FA-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress occurring in intestinal secretory goblet cells, and consequently the reduced synthesis and secretion of mucins that form the protective mucus . To investigate this hypothesis, we treated well-differentiated human colonic LS174T goblet cells with  (PAL)-the most commonly used inducer of lipotoxicity in in vitro systems-or -9, -6, or -3 unsaturated fatty acids alone or in co-treatment with PAL, and measured the impact of such treatments on ER stress and Muc2 production. Our results showed that only eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids protect goblet cells against ER stress-mediated altered Muc2 secretion induced by PAL, whereas neither linolenic  nor -9 and -6 FA are able to provide such protection. We conclude that EPA and DHA could represent potential therapeutic nutrients against the detrimental lipotoxicity of saturated fatty acids, associated with type 2 diabetes and obesity or inflammatory bowel disease. These in vitro data remain to be explored in vivo in a context of dietary obesity.</p><p>Keyword: barrier intergrity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23526996>Fatty  ethyl esters induce intestinal epithelial  dysfunction via a reactive oxygen species-dependent mechanism in a three-dimensional cell culture model.</a></h2><p>Evidence is accumulating that ethanol and its oxidative metabolite, acetaldehyde, can disrupt intestinal epithelial integrity, an important factor contributing to ethanol-induced liver injury. However, ethanol can also be metabolized non-oxidatively generating phosphatidylethanol and fatty  ethyl esters (FAEEs). This study aims to investigate the effects of FAEEs on  , and to explore the role of oxidative stress as possible mechanism.Epithelial permeability was assessed by paracellular flux of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated dextran using live cell imaging. Cell integrity was evaluated by lactate dehydrogenase release. Localization and protein levels of ZO-1 and occludin were analyzed by immunofluorescence and cell-based ELISA, respectively. Intracellular oxidative stress and cellular ATP levels were measured by dichlorofluorescein and luciferase driven bioluminescence, respectively.In vitro, ethyl oleate and ethyl palmitate dose dependently increased permeability associated with disruption and decreased ZO-1 and occludin protein levels, respectively, and increased intracellular oxidative stress without compromising cell viability. These effects could partially be attenuated by pretreatment with the antioxidant, resveratrol, pointing to the role of oxidative stress in the FAEEs-induced intestinal  dysfunction.These findings show that FAEEs can induce intestinal  dysfunction by disrupting the tight junctions, most likely via reactive oxygen species-dependent mechanism.</p><p>Keyword: barrier intergrity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8320562>Selective disruption of endothelial  function in culture by pure fatty acids and fatty acids derived from animal and plant fats.</a></h2><p>Endothelial cell  has been suggested to play a role in the development of atherosclerosis. The effects of fatty acids on endothelial  function were tested by measuring albumin transport across endothelial monolayers cultured on polycarbonate filters. Compared with control cultures, a 24-h exposure to 90 mumol/L lauric (12:0) and linoleic  (18:2) but not to butyric (4:0), hexanoic (6:0), octanoic (8:0), decanoic (10:0), myristic (14:0),  (16:0) or stearic  (18:0) caused an increase in albumin transfer across endothelial monolayers. Selective enrichment of a "physiological" serum fatty  mixture (FA-Mix; 90 mumol/L) with 90 mumol/L of 12:0 or 18:2 significantly increased albumin transfer, whereas enrichment with 90 mumol/L of 4:0, 16:0 or 18:0 significantly decreased albumin transfer relative to 180 mumol/L FA-Mix. Only 12:0- or 18:2-treated cultures showed increased Ca(++)-ATPase activity and the presence of lipid droplets. Fatty acids (60 mumol/L) extracted from butter fat and beef tallow had no effect on albumin transfer, whereas fatty acids extracted from chicken fat and corn oil consistently disrupted endothelial  function. This fat-induced disruption of endothelial  function seems to be related to the amount of 18:2 present in each fat source. These data indicate that unsaturated fats cause cellular perturbations that result in a decrease in endothelial  function in this model system, and that high dietary levels of unsaturated fats may be detrimental to cell .</p><p>Keyword: barrier intergrity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31460824>Single Triglyceride-Rich Meal Destabilizes  Functions and Initiates Inflammatory Processes of Endothelial Cells.</a></h2><p>Postprandial hypertriglyceridemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of a single fat-rich meal on  functions and inflammatory status on human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs), furthermore we assess the effects of mixture of  and 25-hydroxycholesterol (PA +25OHCH) on  of endothelial cells and their inflammatory properties. HUVECs were induced with serum of healthy volunteers taken before, and 3 h after, the consumption of a meal with a standardized daily required dose of fats. In addition, endothelial cells were induced with PA +25OHCH (800 μM/L+10 μg/mL). Total cholesterol, triglycerides (TGs), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high sensitivity c-reactive protein, and glucose were measured at fasting and postprandially. HUVEC  was measured in the RTCA-DP xCELLigence system. mRNA expression of interleukin (IL)-33, IL-32, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), CX3C-chemokine, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) occludin, and VE-cadherin was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Viability and apoptosis were assessed in flow cytometry. The level of VEGF and IL-33 in fasting and postprandial serum was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Three hours after consumption of a fatty meal, all patients displayed increased levels of TGs and Toll-like receptors (110 ± 37 mg/dL versus 182 ± 64 mg/dL  < 0.05) (24 ± 11 mg/dL versus 42 ± 14 mg/dL  < 0.05). Postprandial serum and PA +25OHCH caused >20% decrease of HUVEC  than fasting serum ( < 0.001). HUVEC disintegration was accompanied by a decrease of occludin mRNA expression as compared with fasting serum ( < 0.05). The fatty meal affected neither VE-cadherin mRNA expression nor its apoptosis ( > 0.05). Mixture of PA +25OHCH caused decrease of VE-cadherin mRNA expression as compared with fasting serum ( < 0.01). PA +25OHCH did not affect HUVEC apoptosis ( > 0.05). Postprandial serum and PA +25OHCH caused increase of IL-33, MCP-1, ICAM-1, IL-32, VEGF, and CX3C-chemokine mRNA expression as compared with fasting serum ( < 0.05). Moreover, level of VEGF in fatty serum was significantly higher ( < 0.001). Postprandial lipemia after a single fatty meal may destabilize the endothelial  and initiate inflammatory processes.</p><p>Keyword: barrier intergrity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11442748>Generation of free fatty acids from phospholipids regulates stratum corneum acidification and .</a></h2><p>There is evidence that the " mantle" of the stratum corneum is important for both permeability  formation and cutaneous antimicrobial defense. The origin of the acidic pH of the stratum corneum remains conjectural, however. Both passive (e.g., eccrine/sebaceous secretions, proteolytic) and active (e.g., proton pumps) mechanisms have been proposed. We assessed here whether the free fatty  pool, which is derived from phospholipase-mediated hydrolysis of phospholipids during cornification, contributes to stratum corneum acidification and function. Topical applications of two chemically unrelated secretory phospholipase sPLA2 inhibitors, bromphenacylbromide and 1-hexadecyl-3-trifluoroethylglycero-sn-2-phosphomethanol, for 3 d produced an increase in the pH of murine skin surface that was paralleled not only by a permeability  abnormality but also altered stratum corneum  (number of strippings required to break the ) and decreased stratum corneum cohesion (protein weight removed per stripping). Not only stratum corneum pH but also all of the functional abnormalities normalized when either , stearic, or linoleic acids were coapplied with the inhibitors. Moreover, exposure of intact murine stratum corneum to a neutral pH for as little as 3 h produced comparable abnormalities in stratum corneum  and cohesion, and further amplified the inhibitor-induced functional alterations. Furthermore, short-term applications of an acidic pH buffer to inhibitor-treated skin also reversed the abnormalities in stratum corneum  and cohesion, despite the ongoing decrease in free fatty  levels. Finally, the secretory-phospholipase-inhibitor-induced alterations in /cohesion were in accordance with premature dissolution of desmosomes, demonstrated both by electron microscopy and by reduced desmoglein 1 levels in the stratum corneum (shown by immunofluorescence staining and visualized by confocal microscopy). Together, these results demonstrate: (i) the importance of phospholipid-to-free-fatty- processing for normal stratum corneum acidification; and (ii) the potentially important role of this pathway not only for  homeostasis but also for the dual functions of stratum corneum  and cohesion.</p><p>Keyword: barrier intergrity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7584598>Palmitoylation of brain capillary proteins.</a></h2><p>Palmitoylation is a reversible posttranslational modification which is involved in the regulation of several membrane proteins such as beta 2-adrenergic receptor, p21ras and trimeric G-protein alpha-subunits. This covalent modification could be involved in the regulation of the numerous membrane proteins present in the blood-brain  capillaries. The palmitoylation activity present in brain capillaries was characterized using [3H]palmitate labeling followed by chloroform methanol precipitation. Palmitate solubilizing agents such as detergents and bovine serum albumin (BSA), were used for optimizing activity. Some palmitoylated substrates were identified using [3H]palmitate labeling followed by immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies. Two optimal palmitate solubilization conditions were found, one involves cell permeabilization (Triton X-100) and the other represents a more physiological condition where membrane  is conserved (BSA). Sensitivity to the cysteine modifier N-ethylmaleimide and to hydrolysis, using hydroxylamine or alkaline methanolysis, indicated that  was bound to the proteins by a thioester bond. Maximal palmitate incorporation was reached after 30 or 60 min of incubation in the presence of Triton or BSA, respectively. Depalmitoylation was observed in the presence of BSA, but not with detergents. The palmitoylation reaction was optimal at pH 8 or 9 in the presence of Triton or BSA, respectively, but palmitoylated substrates were detectable over a wide range of pH values. In the presence of Triton X-100, the addition of ATP, CoA and Mg2+ to the incubation medium increased palmitoylation by up to 80-fold. Two palmitoylated substrates were identified, a 42 kDa G-protein alpha subunit and p21ras. The study shows that the utilization of palmitate solubilizing agents is essential to measure in vitro palmitoylation in brain capillaries. Several palmitoylated proteins are present in the blood-brain  including five major substrates of 12, 21, 35, 42 and 55 kDa. It is suggested that palmitoylation could play a crucial role in the regulation of brain capillary function, since the two substrates identified in this study are known to be involved in signal transduction, vesicular transport and cell differentiation.</p><p>Keyword: barrier intergrity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647994> damages gut epithelium  and initiates inflammatory cytokine production.</a></h2><p>The mechanisms leading to the low-grade inflammation observed during obesity are not fully understood. Seeking the initiating events, we tested the hypothesis that the intestine could be damaged by repeated lipid supply and therefore participate in inflammation. In mice, 1-5 palm oil gavages increased intestinal permeability via decreased expression and mislocalization of junctional proteins at the cell-cell contacts; altered the intestinal bacterial species by decreasing the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, segmented filamentous bacteria, and Clostridium leptum; and increased inflammatory cytokine expression. This was further studied in human intestinal epithelial Caco-2/TC7 cells using the two main components of palm oil, i.e.,  and oleic . Saturated  impaired paracellular permeability and junctional protein localization, and induced inflammatory cytokine expression in the cells, but unsaturated oleic  did not. Inhibiting de novo ceramide synthesis prevented part of these effects. Altogether, our data show that short exposure to palm oil or  induces intestinal dysfunctions targeting   and inflammation. Excessive palm oil consumption could be an early player in the gut alterations observed in metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2019.

Type 2 diabetes is often accompanied by dyslipidemia with elevated levels of free fatty acids (FFAs). Podocytes, as an important component of the filtration , are susceptible to lipid disorders. The loss of podocytes causes proteinuria, which is involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. In the present study, we demonstrated that  (PA) promoted autophagy in podocytes. We further found that PA increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in podocytes and that NAC (N-acetyl-cysteine), a potent antioxidant, significantly eliminated the excessive ROS and suppressed autophagy, indicating that the increased generation of ROS was associated with the -induced autophagy in podocytes. Moreover, we also found that PA stimulation decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential in podocytes and induced podocyte apoptosis, while the inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine (CQ) enhanced -induced apoptosis accompanied by increased ROS generation, and the stimulation of autophagy by rapamycin (Rap) remarkably suppressed -induced ROS generation and apoptosis. Taken together, these in vitro findings suggest that PA-induced autophagy in podocytes is mediated by ROS production and that autophagy plays a protective role against PA-induced podocyte apoptosis.</p><p>Keyword: barrier intergrity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16471828>Kinetics of membrane raft formation: fatty  domains in stratum corneum lipid models.</a></h2><p>The major  to permeability in skin resides in the outermost layer of the epidermis, the stratum corneum (SC). The major SC lipid components are ceramides, free fatty acids, and cholesterol. Ternary mixtures containing these constituents are widely used for physicochemical characterization of the . Prior X-ray diffraction and IR spectroscopy studies have revealed the existence of ordered lipid chains packed in orthorhombic subcells. To monitor the kinetics of formation of regions rich in fatty acids, the current study utilizes a modification of the method (J. Phys. Chem. 1992, 96, 10008) developed to monitor component demixing in n-alkane mixtures. The approach is based on changes in the scissoring or rocking mode contours in the IR spectra of (orthorhombically packed) ordered chains. In the current study, equimolar mixtures of ceramides (either non-hydroxy fatty  sphingosine ceramide or alpha-hydroxy fatty  sphingosine ceramide) with chain perdeuterated fatty acids (either  or stearic ) and cholesterol reveal a time evolution of the scissoring contour of the deuterated fatty  chains following quenching from relatively high temperatures where random mixing occurs. Segregation of domains enriched in the fatty  component is observed. The kinetics of segregation are sensitive to the quenching temperature and to the chemical composition of the mixture. The kinetic regimes are conveniently catalogued with a power law of the form P=Ktalpha where P is a (measured) property related to domain composition. The time scales for demixing in these experiments are similar to times observed in several studies that have tracked the restoration of the in vivo permeability  following nonthermal challenges to SC . Further evidence for the physiological importance of the current measurements is the detection of these phases in native SC. The current work constitutes the first direct, structure-based determination of the kinetics of  formation in relevant skin lipid  models.</p><p>Keyword: barrier intergrity</p></html>
