<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15145985>Human CYP4F3s are the main catalysts in the oxidation of fatty acid epoxides.</a></h2><p>CYP4F isoforms are involved in the oxidation of important cellular mediators such as leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and prostaglandins. The proinflammatory agent LTB4 and cytotoxic leukotoxins have been associated with several inflammatory diseases. We present evidence that the hydroxylation of Z 9(10)-epoxyoctadecanoic, Z 9(10)-epoxyoctadec-Z 12-enoic, and Z 12(13)-epoxyoctadec-Z 9-enoic acids and that of monoepoxides from arachidonic acid [epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET)] is important in the regulation of leukotoxin and EET activity. These three epoxidized derivatives from the C18 family (C18-epoxides) were converted to 18-hydroxy-C18-epoxides by human hepatic microsomes with apparent Km values of between 27.6 and 175 microM. Among recombinant P450 enzymes, CYP4F2 and CYP4F3B catalyzed mainly the omega-hydroxylation of C18-epoxides with an apparent Vmax of between 0.84 and 15.0 min(-1), whereas the apparent Vmax displayed by CYP4F3A, the isoform found in leukocytes, ranged from 3.0 to 21.2 min(-1). The rate of omega-hydroxylation by CYP4A11 was experimentally found to be between 0.3 and 2.7 min(-1). CYP4F2 and CYP4F3 exhibited preferences for omega-hydroxylation of Z 8(9)-EET, whereas human liver microsomes preferred Z 11(12)-EET and, to a lesser extent, Z 8(9)-EET. Moreover, vicinal diol from both C18-epoxides and EETs were omega-hydroxylated by liver microsomes and by CYP4F2 and CYP4F3. These data support the hypothesis that the human CYP4F subfamily is involved in the omega-hydroxylation of fatty acid epoxides. These findings demonstrate that another pathway besides conversion to vicinal diol or chain shortening by beta-oxidation exists for fatty acid epoxide inactivation.Copyright 2004 American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9269574>Hypochlorite-induced peroxidation of egg yolk phosphatidylcholine is mediated by hydroperoxides.</a></h2><p>Using a chemiluminescent method, the consumption of HOCl/OCl- was investigated during interaction with liposomes prepared from dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) or egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (EYPC). The concentration of HOCl/OCl-decreased with time in the suspension of EYPC that contain unsaturated lipids and did not change in DMPC liposome suspensions. HOCl/OCl- was consumed more rapidly in peroxidized EYPC. The amount of double bonds was lowered by 40% in peroxidized liposomes and decreased by approximately one-third under the action of HOCl/OCl- in both native and peroxidized EYPC samples. Second-order rate constants for the interaction between HOCl and phospholipid double bonds of 0.50 M-1 s-1 were calculated for native EYPC on basis of the consumption of HOCl/OCl- or from the decrease in concentration of double bonds. In peroxidized EYPC this reaction constant was similar as determined following changes in double bonds. It is concluded that the consumption of HOCl/OCl- increased in peroxidized liposomes due to additional reactions with  peroxidation products. tert-Butyl hydroperoxide and cumene hydroperoxide, or organic peroxides or epoxides (; cholesterol-5 alpha,6 alpha-epoxide; trans-2,3-epoxy-butane; cis-2,3-epoxy-butane) were incorporated into liposomes and investigated in respect to their ability (1) to increase the consumption of HOCl/OCl- in DMPC liposomes, (2) to generate a non-enhanced chemiluminescence with HOCl/OCl- and (3) to evoke an accumulation of  peroxidation products (TBARS) in EYPC liposomes in the absence and presence of NaOCl. None of peroxides or epoxides tested showed any effect on the consumption of HOCl/OCl- or the generation of chemiluminescence. Nor increase of TBARS both in the absence or presence of HOCl/OCl-. In contrast, tert-butyl hydroperoxide and cumene hydroperoxide increased the consumption of HOCl/OCl- in DMPC liposomes and mediated a higher accumulation of TBARS in EYPC liposomes in the presence of HOCl/OCL- over the control. These data suggest that  peroxidation in EYPC can be initiated by the reaction of HOCl/OCL- with organic hydroperoxides.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22798687>EH3 (ABHD9): the first member of a new epoxide hydrolase family with high activity for fatty acid epoxides.</a></h2><p>Epoxide hydrolases are a small superfamily of enzymes important for the detoxification of chemically reactive xenobiotic epoxides and for the processing of endogenous epoxides that act as signaling molecules. Here, we report the identification of two human epoxide hydrolases: EH3 and EH4. They share 45% sequence identity, thus representing a new family of mammalian epoxide hydrolases. Quantitative RT-PCR from mouse tissue indicates strongest EH3 expression in lung, skin, and upper gastrointestinal tract. The recombinant enzyme shows a high turnover number with 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET), as well as 9,10-epoxyoctadec-11-enoic acid (leukotoxin). It is inhibited by a subclass of N,N'-disubstituted urea derivatives, including 12-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido)-dodecanoic acid, 1-cyclohexyl-3-dodecylurea, and 1-(1-acetylpiperidin-4-yl)-3-(4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl)urea, compounds so far believed to be selective inhibitors of mammalian soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). Its sensitivity to this subset of sEH inhibitors may have implications on the pharmacologic profile of these compounds. This is particularly relevant because sEH is a potential drug target, and clinical trials are under way exploring the value of sEH inhibitors in the treatment of hypertension and diabetes type II.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1941901>Glutathione S-transferase-catalyzed conjugation of  with glutathione.</a></h2><p>The possible role of glutathione S-transferases (GST) in detoxification of fatty acid epoxides generated during  peroxidation has been evaluated. Present studies showed that cytosolic human glutathione S-transferases belonging to alpha, mu, and pi classes isolated from human liver and lung catalyzed the conjugation of glutathione and . The product of enzymatic reaction, i.e., conjugate of GSH and epoxystearic acid, was isolated and characterized. The Michaelis constant (Km) values of the alpha, mu, and pi classes of GSTs for  were found to be 0.47, 0.32 and 0.80 mM, respectively, whereas the maximal velocity (V max) values for the alpha, mu, and pi classes of GSTs were found to be 142, 256, and 52 mol/min/mol, respectively. These results indicate that even though  is a substrate for all the three classes of GSTs, the mu class isozymes have maximum activity toward this substrate and may preferentially metabolize fatty acid epoxides more effectively as compared to the other classes of GSTs.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9792072> of Pneumocystis: toward the definition of new molecular targets.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9457427>The lipids of Pneumocystis carinii.</a></h2><p>Information about a number of Pneumocystis carinii lipids obtained by the analyses of organisms isolated and purified from infected lungs of corticosteroid-immunosuppressed rats has been reported in recent years. Of the common opportunistic protists associated with AIDS (Cryptosporidium, Toxoplasma, and the microsporidia), more is currently known about the lipids of P. carinii than the others. Lipids that are synthesized by the organism but not by humans are attractive targets for drug development. Thus, the elucidation of delta 7C-24-alykylated sterol and  biosyntheses in P. carinii is currently being examined in detail, since these have been identified as P. carinii-specific lipids. The development of low-toxicity drugs that prevent sterol C-24 alkylation and the specific inhibition of the lipoxygenase that forms  might prove fruitful. Although humans can synthesize coenzyme Q10, the anti-P. carinii activity and low toxicity of ubiquinone analogs such as atovaquone suggest that the electron transport chain in the pathogen may differ importantly from that in the host. Although resistance to atovaquone has been observed, development of other naphthoquinone drugs would provide a broader armamentarium of drugs to treat patients with P. carinii pneumonia. Studies of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and of infected lungs have demonstrated that the infection causes a number of chemical abnormalities. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained after the removal of lung cellular material and the organisms has been shown to contain larger amounts of surfactant proteins and smaller amounts of phospholipids than do comparable samples from P. carinii-free lungs. Increased phospholipase activity, inhibition of surfactant secretion by type II cells, and uptake and catabolism of lipids by the pathogen may explain this phenomenon related to P. carinii pneumonia. Although not yet thoroughly examined, initial studies on the uptake and  of lipids by P. carinii suggest that the organism relies heavily on exogenous  nutrients.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p></html>
