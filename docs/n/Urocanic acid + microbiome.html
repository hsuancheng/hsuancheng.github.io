Probiotics have been shown to exert beneficial health-promoting effects through modulation of intestinal microflora biodiversity, thus the effects of probiotics administration on D-galactose (D-gal) senescence-induced rat were evaluated based on the changes in gut  and metabolomic profiles. Upon senescence induction, the ratio of Firmicutes/ Bacteroidetes was significantly lowered, while treatment with Lactobacillus helveticus OFS 1515 and L. fermentum DR9 increased the ratio at the phylum level (P < 0.05). Study on the genus level showed that L. paracasei OFS 0291 and L. helveticus OFS 1515 administration reduced Bacteroides, which are prominently opportunistic pathogens while L. fermentum DR9 treated rats promoted the proliferation of Lactobacillus compared to the aged rats (P < 0.05). Probiotics treatment did not alter fecal short-chain fatty  (SCFA) profile, but an increase in acetate was observed in the D-gal rats. The analysis of fecal water-soluble metabolites showed that D-gal induced senescence caused great impact on amino acids metabolism such as , citrulline, cystamine and 5-oxoproline, which could serve as potential aging biomarkers. Treatment with probiotics ameliorated these metabolites in a strain-specific manner, whereby L. fermentum DR9 promoted antioxidative effect through upregulation of oxoproline, whereas both L. paracasei OFS 0291 and L. helveticus OFS 1515 restored the levels of reducing sugars, arabinose and ribose similar to the young rats. D-gal induced senescence did cause significant immunological alteration in the colon of aged rats however, all probiotic strains demonstrated immunomodulatory properties as L. paracasei OFS 0291, L. helveticus OFS 1515 and L. fermentum DR9 alleviated proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-1β as well as IL-4 compared to the aged control (P < 0.05). Our study highlights the potential of probiotics as an anti-aging therapy through healthy gut modulation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Bahia Differently Affects Gut  Profiling as Unveiled by an Integrated Meta-Omics Approach.</a></h2><p>We have investigated the effect of intake of two different orange juices from Citrus sinensis cv. "Cara Cara" and cv. "Bahia" on faecal  and metabolome using an integrated meta-omics approach. Following a randomized crossover design, healthy subjects daily consumed 500 mL of orange juice from Cara Cara or Bahia juices or an isocaloric control drink. Stools were collected at baseline (T0) and after a week (T7) of intervention. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were pyrosequenced targeting 16S rRNA, and faecal metabolites were analyzed by an untargeted metabolomics approach based on H NMR spectroscopy. The major shift observed in  composition after orange juice intake was the increased abundance of a network of Clostridia OTUs from Mogibacteriaceae, Tissierellaceae, Veillonellaceae, Odoribacteraceae, and Ruminococcaceae families, whose members were differently affected by Cara Cara or Bahia juice consumption. A core of six metabolites such as inositol, choline, lysine, arginine, , and formate significantly increased in Cara Cara compared to the Bahia group.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p></html>
