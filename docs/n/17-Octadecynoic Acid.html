We have recently defined the role of nitric oxide and PGI(2) in the dilation of submucosal intestinal arterioles from patients with normal bowel function. However, significant endothelium-dependent dilator capacity to ACh remained after inhibiting both these mediators. The current study was designed to examine the potential role of EDHF in human intestinal submucosal arterioles. ACh elicited endothelium-dependent relaxation in the presence of inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase (23 +/- 10%, n = 6). This ACh-induced relaxation was inhibited and converted to constriction by catalase (-53 +/- 10%, n = 6) or KCl (-30 +/- 3%, n = 7), whereas  and 6-(2-propargylloxyphenyl) hexanoic acid, two inhibitors of cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, had no significant effect (3 +/- 1% and 20 +/- 8%, n = 5, respectively). Exogenous H(2)O(2) elicited dose-dependent relaxation of intact microvessels (52 +/- 10%, n = 7) but caused frank vasoconstriction in arterioles denuded of endothelium (-73 +/- 8%, n = 7). ACh markedly increased the dichlorofluorescein fluorescence in intact arterioles in the presence of nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase inhibitors compared with control and compared with catalase-treated microvessels (363.6 +/- 49, 218.8 +/- 10.6, 221.9 +/- 27.9, respectively, P < 0.05 ANOVA, n = 5 arbitrary units). No changes in the dichlorofluorescein fluorescence were recorded in vessels treated with ACh alone. These results indicate that endothelial production of H(2)O(2) occurs in response to ACh in human gut mucosal arterioles but that H(2)O(2) is not an EDHF in this tissue. Rather, we speculate that it stimulates the release of a chemically distinct EDHF.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21524915>Bioorthogonal proteomics of 15-hexadecynyloxyacetic acid chemical reporter reveals preferential targeting of  acid modified proteins and biosynthetic enzymes.</a></h2><p>Chemical reporters are powerful tools for the detection and discovery of protein modifications following cellular labeling. The metabolism of alkyne- or azide-functionalized chemical reporters in cells can influence the efficiency and specificity of protein targeting. To evaluate the effect of degradation of chemical reporters of protein  acylation, we synthesized 15-hexadecynyloxyacetic acid (HDYOA), a reporter that was designed to be resistant to β-oxidation, and compared its ability to label palmitoylated proteins with an established reporter,  (ODYA). HDYOA was able to label known candidate S-palmitoylated proteins similarly to ODYA. Accordingly, bioorthogonal proteomic analysis demonstrated that 70% of proteins labeled with ODYA were also labeled with HDYOA. However, the proteins observed differentially in our proteomic studies suggested that a portion of ODYA protein labeling is a result of β-oxidation. In contrast, downstream enzymes involved in β-oxidation of   were not targeted by HDYOA. Since HDYOA can label S-palmitoylated proteins and is not utilized by downstream β-oxidation pathways, this  acid chemical reporter may be particularly useful for bioorthogonal proteomic studies in cell types metabolically skewed toward  acid breakdown.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The cellular mechanisms underlying the increased contribution of EDCF were explored in 16 and 30-week-old male TH and age-matched male C57BL/6J mice (n=4-9). Blood glucose and serum lipid profiles were markedly increased in the TH mice. Superoxide generation, assessed with a lucigenin chemiluminescence assay, was markedly increased in the aortae of TH mice. Endothelium-dependent vascular relaxations and contractions to acetylcholine (ACh), but not endothelium-independent relaxations to sodium nitroprusside, were impaired and vascular contractions to phenylephrine were significantly enhanced in aortae from TH mice. Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester markedly increased the ACh-induced contractions in TH mice, whereas SQ29548, a thromboxane receptor antagonist, and cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibitors  and sulfaphenazole, the latter being specific for CYP2C6 and 2C9, decreased and (or) normalized the contractile response to ACh in TH mice.

Our previous studies have demonstrated that endothelial dysfunction in the small mesenteric arteries from 12-16 week old type II diabetic mice was associated with decreased bio-availability of nitric oxide whereas endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF)-mediated relaxation was preserved. The objective of the present study was to characterize EDHF-mediated relaxations of small mesenteric arteries from db/db mice. A depolarizing concentration of KCl or tetraethylammonium (TEA, 10 mM) significantly inhibited the EDHF-mediated relaxation to acetylcholine and bradykinin in small mesenteric arteries from both db/+ and db/db mice. Charybdotoxin or iberiotoxin alone and a combination of ouabain and barium significantly reduced the maximal relaxation to acetylcholine in small mesenteric arteries from db/db mice and charybdotoxin or iberiotoxin either alone or in combination with apamin reduced the sensitivity to the EDHF-mediated component of the relaxation response to bradykinin. , but not catalase, significantly reduced the sensitivity to EDHF-mediated responses to bradykinin in db/db mice;  had no effect on acetylcholine-mediated relaxations. No differences were, however, detected for mRNA expression levels of calcium-activated potassium channels or connexins 37, 40, 43 and 45. Collectively, these data suggest that bradykinin-induced, EDHF-dependent relaxation in small mesenteric arteries from db/db mice is mediated via cytochrome P450 product that activates the large conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK(Ca) or Slo) channel, whereas the acetylcholine-induced, EDHF-mediated relaxation involves neither cytochrome P450 product nor hydrogen peroxide.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h"<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22081607>DHHC5 protein palmitoylates flotillin-2 and is rapidly degraded on induction of neuronal differentiation in cultured cells.</a></h2><p>Post-translational palmitoylation of intracellular proteins is mediated by protein palmitoyltransferases belonging to the DHHC family, which share a common catalytic Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC) motif. Several members have been implicated in neuronal development, neurotransmission, and synaptic plasticity. We previously observed that mice homozygous for a hypomorphic allele of the ZDHHC5 gene are impaired in context-dependent learning and memory. To identify potentially relevant protein substrates of DHHC5, we performed a quantitative proteomic analysis of stable isotope-labeled neuronal stem cell cultures from forebrains of normal and DHHC5-GT (gene-trapped) mice using the bioorthogonal palmitate analog . We identified ∼300 -modified and hydroxylamine-sensitive proteins, of which a subset was decreased in abundance in DHHC5-GT cells. Palmitoylation and oligomerization of one of these proteins (flotillin-2) was abolished in DHHC5-GT neuronal stem cells. In COS-1 cells, overexpression of DHHC5 markedly stimulated the palmitoylation of flotillin-2, strongly suggesting a direct enzyme-substrate relationship. Serendipitously, we found that down-regulation of DHHC5 was triggered within minutes following growth factor withdrawal from normal neural stem cells, a maneuver that is used to induce neural differentiation in culture. The effect was reversible for up to 4 h, and degradation was partially prevented by inhibitors of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. These findings suggest that protein palmitoylation can be regulated through changes in DHHC PAT levels in response to differentiation signals.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21839852> improves contractile response to angiotensin II by releasing vasocontrictor prostaglandins.</a></h2><p>The present study investigated the role of CYP-enzymes in the modulation of vasoconstrictor responses to angiotensin II in rabbit aortae. In arteries with the endothelium-intact (E+) the CYP-inhibitor,  (17 ODYA), increased the efficacy to angiotensin II (17-ODYA-effect) as well as simultaneous incubation with miconazole (epoxygenase-inhibitor) and CAY 10434 (ω-hydroxylase-inhibitor). The removal of endothelium (E-) caused potentiation of the 17 ODYA-effect. Therefore, endothelium-dependent and -independent mechanisms would be involved. 17-ODYA and miconazole reduced Ach-relaxation. Indomethacin blocked the 17-ODYA-effect in E+ and E- arteries but blunted the response to angiotensin II only in E+ arteries. NS 398 (cyclooxygenase-2-inhibitor) blocked the 17-ODYA-effect and reduced angiotensin II affinity as well as SQ 29548 (thromboxane-prostanoid (TP) receptor-inhibitor). In E- arteries, CAY 10434 enhanced angiotensin II response as well as 17-ODYA. SC 560 (cyclooxygenase-1-inhibitor) and NS 398 partially blocked the 17-ODYA-effect. In conclusion, 17-ODYA induced endothelial dysfunction by inhibiting CYP-epoxygenase and thus improves vasoconstrictor cyclooxygenase-2 metabolites release acting through TP receptors. The endothelium-independent mechanism of 17-ODYA-effect may involve increase of vasoconstrictor cyclooxygenase-metabolites induced by prostaglandin-ω-hydroxylase-inhibition.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Since its implication in inflammatory diseases is well recognized, many tools to regulate its biosynthesis have been developed and showed promising results in vitro and in vivo, but mixed results in clinical trials. Recently, the mTOR pathway component p70S6 kinase 1 (p70S6K1) has been linked to LTC4 synthase and the biosynthesis of cysteinyl-leukotrienes. In this respect, we investigated if p70S6K1 could also play a role in LTB4 biosynthesis. We thus evaluated the impact of the p70S6K1 inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 on LTB4 biosynthesis in human neutrophils. At a concentration of 10 μM, both compounds inhibited S6 phosphorylation, although neither one inhibited the thapsigargin-induced LTB4 biosynthesis, as assessed by the sum of LTB4, 20-OH-LTB4, and 20-COOH-LTB4. However, PF-4708671, but not LY2584702, inhibited the ω-oxidation of LTB4 into 20-OH-LTB4 by intact neutrophils and by recombinant CYP4F3A, leading to increased LTB4 levels. This was true for both endogenously biosynthesized and exogenously added LTB4. In contrast to that of , the inhibitory effect of PF-4708671 was easily removed by washing the neutrophils, indicating that PF-4708671 was a reversible CYP4F3A inhibitor. At optimal concentration, PF-4708671 increased the half-life of LTB4 in our neutrophil suspensions by 7.5 fold, compared to 5 fold for . Finally, Michaelis-Menten and Lineweaver-Burk plots indicate that PF-4708671 is a mixed inhibitor of CYP4F3A. In conclusion, we show that PF-4708671 inhibits CYP4F3A and prevents the ω-oxidation of LTB4 in cellulo, which might result in increased LTB4 levels in vivo.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29733200>Temporal Profiling Establishes a Dynamic S-Palmitoylation Cycle.</a></h2><p>S-palmitoylation is required for membrane anchoring, proper trafficking, and the normal function of hundreds of integral and peripheral membrane proteins. Previous bioorthogonal pulse-chase proteomics analyses identified Ras family GTPases, polarity proteins, and G proteins as rapidly cycling S-palmitoylated proteins sensitive to depalmitoylase inhibition, yet the breadth of enzyme regulated dynamic S-palmitoylation largely remains a mystery. Here, we present a pulsed bioorthogonal S-palmitoylation assay for temporal analysis of S-palmitoylation dynamics. Low concentration hexadecylfluorophosphonate (HDFP) inactivates the APT and ABHD17 families of depalmitoylases, which dramatically increases alkynyl-fatty acid labeling and stratifies S-palmitoylated proteins into kinetically distinct subgroups. Most surprisingly, HDFP treatment does not affect steady-state S-palmitoylation levels, despite inhibiting all validated depalmitoylating enzymes. S-palmitoylation profiling of APT1/APT2 mouse brains similarly show no change in S-palmitoylation levels. In comparison with hydroxylamine-switch methods, bioorthogonal alkynyl fatty acids are only incorporated into a small fraction of dynamic S-palmitoylated proteins, raising the possibility that S-palmitoylation is more stable than generally characterized. Overall, disrupting depalmitoylase activity enhances alkynyl fatty acid incorporation, but does not greatly affect steady state S-palmitoylation across the proteome.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21361680>-cell interactions in human monocytes investigated by doubly-resonant coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopy.</a></h2><p>We demonstrate that doubly-resonant coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering can provide enhanced and highly specific contrast for molecules containing unique Raman-active small molecular groups. This combination provides contrast for molecules that can otherwise be difficult to discriminate by Raman spectroscopy. Here, human monocytes were incubated with either deuterated oleic acid or  (a fatty acid with an end terminal acetylene group). The carbon-deuterium stretching vibration of the deuterated fatty acid, as well as the unique alkyne stretching vibration of the alkyne-containing fatty acid, were used to provide contrast for these exogenous free fatty acids. The combination of these unique modes with the common aliphatic carbon-hydrogen stretching vibration inherent to all fatty acid allowed for doubly-resonant detection of these unique molecules and enabled us to detect the presence of these lipids in areas within a cell where each molecular resonance by itself did not generate sufficient signal.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22615937>Proteomic analysis of S-acylated proteins in human B cells reveals palmitoylation of the immune regulators CD20 and CD23.</a></h2><p>S-palmitoylation is a reversible post-translational modification important for controlling the membrane targeting and function of numerous membrane proteins with diverse roles in signalling, scaffolding, and trafficking. We sought to identify novel palmitoylated proteins in B lymphocytes using acyl-biotin exchange chemistry, coupled with differential analysis by liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. In total, we identified 57 novel palmitoylated protein candidates from human EBV-transformed lymphoid cells. Two of them, namely CD20 and CD23 (low affinity immunoglobulin epsilon Fc receptor), are immune regulators that are effective/potential therapeutic targets for haematological malignancies, autoimmune diseases and allergic disorders. Palmitoylation of CD20 and CD23 was confirmed by heterologous expression of alanine mutants coupled with bioorthogonal metabolic labeling.

In this protein, a post-translational modification by fatty acids covalently attached to cysteine, termed S-palmitoylation, plays a crucial role for the antiviral activity. IFITM3 possesses three cysteine residues for the S-palmitoylation in the first transmembrane (TM1) domain and in the cytoplasmic (CP) loop. Because these cysteines are well conserved in the mammalian IFITM family proteins, the S-palmitoylation on these cysteines is significant for their functions. IFITM5 is another IFITM family protein and interacts with the FK506-binding protein 11 (FKBP11) to form a higher-order complex in osteoblast cells, which induces the expression of immunologically relevant genes. In this study, we investigated the role played by S-palmitoylation of IFITM5 in its interaction with FKBP11 in the cells, because this interaction is a key process for the gene expression. Our investigations using an established reporter,  (17-ODYA), and an inhibitor for the S-palmitoylation, 2-bromopalmitic acid (2BP), revealed that IFITM5 was S-palmitoylated in addition to IFITM3. Specifically, we found that cysteine residues in the TM1 domain and in the CP loop were S-palmitoylated in IFITM5. Then, we revealed by immunoprecipitation and western blot analyses that the interaction of IFITM5 with FKBP11 was inhibited in the presence of 2BP. The mutant lacking the S-palmitoylation site in the TM1 domain lost the interaction with FKBP11. These results indicate that the S-palmitoylation on IFITM5 promotes the interaction with FKBP11. Finally, we investigated bone nodule formation in osteoblast cells in the presence of 2BP, because IFITM5 was originally identified as a bone formation factor. The experiment resulted in a morphological aberration of the bone nodule. This also indicated that the S-palmitoylation contributes to bone formation.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22056678>Global profiling of dynamic protein palmitoylation.</a></h2><p>The reversible thioester linkage of palmitic acid on cysteines, known as protein S-palmitoylation, facilitates the membrane association and proper subcellular localization of proteins.

C22:0 and 22-hydroxy-docosanoic acid (omega-hydroxy-C22:0) were used as substrates, and the reaction products were analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. In the presence of NADPH, omega-oxidation of C22:0 produced not only the hydroxylated product, omega-hydroxy-C22:0, but also the dicarboxylic acid of C22:0, docosanedioic acid (C22:0-DCA). When rat liver microsomes were incubated with omega-hydroxy-C22:0 in the presence of either NAD+ or NADPH, C22:0-DCA was formed readily. Formation of C22:0-DCA from either C22:0 or omega-hydroxy-C22:0 with NADPH as cofactor was inhibited strongly by miconazole and disulfiram, whereas no inhibition was found with NAD+ as cofactor. Furthermore, omega-oxidation of C22:0 was reduced significantly when molecular oxygen was depleted. The high sensitivity toward the more specific cytochrome P450 inhibitors ketoconazole and  suggests that hydroxylation of C22:0 and omega-hydroxy-C22:0 may be catalyzed by one or more cytochrome P450 hydroxylases belonging to the CYP4A and/or CYP4F subfamily.

In response to angiotensin II (Ang II) P450-derived HETEs (16-, 17-, 18-, 19- and 20-) are released from the isolated Kreb's perfused rabbit kidney. Ang II produced a several-fold increase in the levels of P450-HETEs above basal levels in both urinary (such as for 20-HETE from 0.93 +/- 0.7 to 2.31 +/- 0.9 ng/min) and venous (from 0.1 +/- 0.05 to 0.3 +/- 0.05 ng/min) effluents. However, inhibition of P450, which reduced basal release, did not prevent Ang II-induced release of P450-AA products from the rabbit kidney; for example, urinary 20-HETE in the presence of 17-ODYA (1 microM) was undetectable and increased to 0.93 +/- 0.4 ng/min with Ang II and venous 20-HETE increased from 0.06 +/- 0.03 to 0.24 +/- 0.07 ng/min. Similar results were obtained with clotrimazole (1 microM). As 16-, 18-, 19- and 20-HETEs are vasodilators in the rabbit kidney and 16- and 17-HETEs inhibit proximal tubular ATPase activity, we investigated their possible sites of esterification. Cortical and medullary lipids were extracted, separated by HPLC and P450-HETEs quantitated following alkaline hydrolysis. The P450-HETEs were incorporated into both neutral lipids (NL) and phospholipids [phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylcholine (PC)]. However, the assignment of a HETE to a specific phospholipid pool must be regarded as tentative as the appropriate standards containing P450-HETEs in the Sn-2 position (such as 20-HETE-PF., 20-HETE-PC, etc.) were not available. Esterified HETEs were found in larger quantities in the cortex as compared to the medulla (34.40 +/- 1.12 versus 22.76 +/- 0.53 ng/g). The PI fraction in the cortex yielded the largest quantity of HETEs and the PC fraction the lowest. In the medulla, the largest quantities of esterified HETEs were found in neutral lipids and only slightly lesser amounts in PE and PI. Esterified 18-HETE was localized only to the NI fraction. This fraction also contained the other HETEs, 19- and 20-HETE being the most abundant. Notably only 16- and 17-HETE were present in PF, whereas, 19- and 20-HETE were also present in PI, PS and PC.

The renal  of arachidonic acid in control and in 1-K,1C hypertensive rats was assessed by incubating microsomes with [14C]-arachidonic acid, the metabolites formed being measured using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The antihypertensive effects of these P-450 metabolites of arachidonic acid were compared with those of medullipin I after intravenous administration in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).Cortical and papillary blood flow increased significantly and arterial pressure fell after unclipping the renal artery in the 1-K,1C hypertensive rats. 17-ODYA prevented the fall in blood pressure after unclipping. The production of epoxy- and dihydroxy-eicosatrienoic acids was elevated in microsomes prepared from the renal cortex of the 1-K,1C hypertensive rats. However, intravenous administration of these metabolites did not mimic the effect of medullipin I to lower arterial pressure in SHR.Elevations in renal cortical or papillary blood flow, or both, may stimulate the release of a P-450-derived antihypertensive  from the kidney after unclipping of the renal artery in 1-K,1C hypertensive rats.

To date, our knowledge of the post-translational modification of PMP22 is limited. Using the CSS-Palm 2.0 software we predicted that C85 (cysteine 85), a highly conserved amino acid located between the second and third transmembrane domains, is a potential site for palmitoylation. To test this, we mutated C85S (C85 to serine) and established stable cells lines expressing the WT (wild-type) or the C85S-PMP22. In Schwann and MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cells mutating C85 blocked the palmitoylation of PMP22, which we monitored using 17-ODYA (). While palmitoylation was not necessary for processing the newly synthesized PMP22 through the secretory pathway, overexpression of C85S-PMP22 led to pronounced cell spreading and uneven monolayer thinning. To further investigate the functional significance of palmitoylated PMP22, we evaluated MDCK cell migration in a wound-healing assay. While WT-PMP22 expressing cells were resistant to migration, C85S cells displayed lamellipodial protrusions and migrated at a similar rate to vector control. These findings indicate that palmitoylation of PMP22 at C85 is critical for the role of the protein in modulating epithelial cell shape and motility.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16980726>Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids released through the cytochrome P-450 pathway regulate 3T6 fibroblast growth.</a></h2><p>Eicosanoids participate in the regulation of cellular proliferation. Thus, we observed that prostaglandin E(2) interaction with membrane receptors is involved in the control of 3T6 fibroblast growth induced by serum. However, our results suggested that another arachidonic acid pathway might be implicated in these events. Our results show that 3T6 fibroblasts synthesized hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) such as 12-HETE through the cytochrome P-450 (CYP450) pathway. However, 3T6 fibroblasts did not produce leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)), and lipoxygenase inhibitors and LT antagonists failed to inhibit 3T6 fibroblast growth induced by FBS. In contrast, we observed that CYP450 inhibitors such as SKF-525A, , 1-aminobenzotriazole, and 6-(2-propargyloxyphenyl)hexanoic acid reduced 12(S)-HETE levels, 3T6 fibroblast growth, and DNA synthesis induced by FBS. The impairment of DNA synthesis and 3T6 fibroblast growth induced by SKF-525A were reversed by exogenous addition of HETEs. Moreover, we report that 5-HETE, 12(S)-HETE, and 15(S)-HETE are mitogenic on 3T6 fibroblast in the absence of another growth factor, and this effect was dependent on the activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase pathway. In conclusion, our results show that HETEs, probably produced by CYP450, are involved in the control of 3T6 fibroblast growth.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p></html>"><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28068410>Leukotriene B₄  and p70S6 Kinase 1 Inhibitors: PF-4708671 but Not LY2584702 Inhibits CYP4F3A and the ω-Oxidation of Leukotriene B₄ In Vitro and In Cellulo.</a></h2><p>LTB4 is an inflammatory lipid mediator mainly biosynthesized by leukocytes. Since its implication in inflammatory diseases is well recognized, many tools to regulate its biosynthesis have been developed and showed promising results in vitro and in vivo, but mixed results in clinical trials. Recently, the mTOR pathway component p70S6 kinase 1 (p70S6K1) has been linked to LTC4 synthase and the biosynthesis of cysteinyl-leukotrienes. In this respect, we investigated if p70S6K1 could also play a role in LTB4 biosynthesis. We thus evaluated the impact of the p70S6K1 inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 on LTB4 biosynthesis in human neutrophils. At a concentration of 10 μM, both compounds inhibited S6 phosphorylation, although neither one inhibited the thapsigargin-induced LTB4 biosynthesis, as assessed by the sum of LTB4, 20-OH-LTB4, and 20-COOH-LTB4. However, PF-4708671, but not LY2584702, inhibited the ω-oxidation of LTB4 into 20-OH-LTB4 by intact neutrophils and by recombinant CYP4F3A, leading to increased LTB4 levels. This was true for both endogenously biosynthesized and exogenously added LTB4. In contrast to that of , the inhibitory effect of PF-4708671 was easily removed by washing the neutrophils, indicating that PF-4708671 was a reversible CYP4F3A inhibitor. At optimal concentration, PF-4708671 increased the half-life of LTB4 in our neutrophil suspensions by 7.5 fold, compared to 5 fold for . Finally, Michaelis-Menten and Lineweaver-Burk plots indicate that PF-4708671 is a mixed inhibitor of CYP4F3A. In conclusion, we show that PF-4708671 inhibits CYP4F3A and prevents the ω-oxidation of LTB4 in cellulo, which might result in increased LTB4 levels in vivo.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29733200>Temporal Profiling Establishes a Dynamic S-Palmitoylation Cycle.</a></h2><p>S-palmitoylation is required for membrane anchoring, proper trafficking, and the normal function of hundreds of integral and peripheral membrane proteins. Previous bioorthogonal pulse-chase proteomics analyses identified Ras family GTPases, polarity proteins, and G proteins as rapidly cycling S-palmitoylated proteins sensitive to depalmitoylase inhibition, yet the breadth of enzyme regulated dynamic S-palmitoylation largely remains a mystery. Here, we present a pulsed bioorthogonal S-palmitoylation assay for temporal analysis of S-palmitoylation dynamics. Low concentration hexadecylfluorophosphonate (HDFP) inactivates the APT and ABHD17 families of depalmitoylases, which dramatically increases alkynyl-fatty acid labeling and stratifies S-palmitoylated proteins into kinetically distinct subgroups. Most surprisingly, HDFP treatment does not affect steady-state S-palmitoylation levels, despite inhibiting all validated depalmitoylating enzymes. S-palmitoylation profiling of APT1/APT2 mouse brains similarly show no change in S-palmitoylation levels. In comparison with hydroxylamine-switch methods, bioorthogonal alkynyl fatty acids are only incorporated into a small fraction of dynamic S-palmitoylated proteins, raising the possibility that S-palmitoylation is more stable than generally characterized. Overall, disrupting depalmitoylase activity enhances alkynyl fatty acid incorporation, but does not greatly affect steady state S-palmitoylation across the proteome.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28698302>Heme Modification Contributes to the Mechanism-Based Inactivation of Human Cytochrome P450 2J2 by Two Terminal Acetylenic Compounds.</a></h2><p>The mechanism-based inactivation of human CYP2J2 by three terminal acetylenic compounds: -(methylsulfonyl)-6-(2-propargyloxyphenyl)hexanamide (MS),  (OD), and danazol (DZ) was investigated. The loss of hydroxyebastine (OHEB) carboxylation activity in a reconstituted system was time- and concentration-dependent and required NADPH for MS and OD, but not DZ. The kinetic constants for the mechanism-based inactivation of OHEB carboxylation activity were:  of 6.1 μM and  of 0.22 min for MS and  of 2.5 μM and  of 0.05 min for OD. The partition ratios for MS and OD were ∼10 and ∼20, respectively. Inactivation of CYP2J2 by MS or OD resulted in a loss of the native heme spectrum and a similar decrease in the reduced CO difference spectrum. A heme adduct was observed in the MS-inactivated CYP2J2. The possible reactive metabolite which covalently modified the prosthetic heme was characterized by analysis of the glutathione conjugates formed by MS or OD following oxygenation of the ethynyl moiety. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry showed that inactivation by MS or OD did not lead to modification of apoprotein. Interaction of CYP2J2 with DZ produced a type II binding spectrum with a  of 2.8 μM and the IC for loss of OHEB carboxylation activity was 0.18 μM. In conclusion, heme modification by MS and OD was responsible for the mechanism-based inactivation of CYP2J2. The results suggest that the ethynyl moiety of MS and OD faces the heme iron, whereas the isoxazole ring of DZ is preferentially oriented toward the heme iron of CYP2J2.Copyright © 2017 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28565971>Monodora myristica (African nutmeg) modulates redox homeostasis and alters functional chemistry in sickled erythrocytes.</a></h2><p>The antioxidative effect of Monodora myristica seed acetone extract and its effect on chemical functional groups were investigated in sickled erythrocytes as well as molecular modeling of the antisickling potentials of its secondary metabolites. The extract was subjected to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify the compounds present, which were then docked into the allosteric-binding site of deoxy-hemoglobin. The extract was incubated with sickled erythrocytes at 37°C for 6, 12, and 24 h and were subjected to antioxidative analysis for reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and lipid peroxidation (LPO). Chemical functional group of the treated cells was analyzed via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The predominant compounds identified were ; oleic acid, androstan-3-one, 17-hydroxy-2-methyl- (2.beta.,5.beta.,17.beta.)-; estran-3-one, 17-(acetyloxy)-2-methyl-, (2.alpha., 5.alpha., 17.beta.), and (+)-3-carene, 10-(acetylmethyl)-. They all fitted well within the active site of Hb with good binding affinity, as evidenced by the negative CDocker interaction energies of their complexes ranging between -54.4 and -26.7 kcal/mol. Treatment with the extract exacerbated SOD and catalase activities as well as GSH level, while LPO was suppressed. This antioxidative activity was time and/or dose dependent, with 6 and 12 h incubation showing the optimum activity. FTIR analysis of the treated cells showed the presence of hydrophobic functional groups. The synergetic molecular interaction of the major compounds of the extract with the α-dimer of Hb depicts an antisickling effect of M. myristica acetone extract. This is accompanied by exacerbation of endogenous antioxidant enzymes activity and modification of the functional chemistry of the cells.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29976573>A Specific Probe Substrate for Evaluation of CYP4A11 Activity in Human Tissue Microsomes and a Highly Selective CYP4A11 Inhibitor: Luciferin-4A and Epalrestat.</a></h2><p>The specificity of cytochrome P450 4A11 (CYP4A11) against luciferin-4A -demethylation in human liver microsomes (HLMs) and human renal microsomes (HRMs) and selectivity of CYP4A11 inhibition by epalrestat were investigated. Kinetic analysis of luciferin-4A -demethylation yielded  and  values of 39.7 pmol/min per milligram protein and 43.2 M for HLMs (Hill coefficient 1.24) and 39.4 pmol/min per milligram protein and 33.8 M for HRMs (Hill coefficient 1.34), respectively. Among the selective CYP inhibitors tested, HET0016 (CYP4 inhibitor) exclusively inhibited luciferin-4A -demethylation by HLMs and HRMs. Furthermore, anti-CYP4A11 antibody nearly abolished the activity of both tissue microsomes. Luciferin-4A -demethylase activity of HLMs was significantly correlated with lauric acid -hydroxylase activity, a marker of CYP4A11 activity ( = 0.904,  < 0.0001). Next, effects of epalrestat on CYP-mediated drug oxidations were examined. Epalrestat showed the most potent inhibition against CYP4A11 (IC = 1.82 M) among the 17 recombinant enzymes tested. The inhibitory effect of epalrestat on CYP4A11 was at least 10-fold stronger than those on CYP4F2, CYP4F3B, and CYP4F12. For known CYP4 inhibitors, in contrast, HET0016 inhibited the activities of CYP4A11 and CYP4F2 (IC = 0.0137-0.0182 M);  reduced activities of CYP4A11, CYP4F2, CYP4F3B, and CYP4F12 to a similar extent (IC = 5.70-17.7 M). Epalrestat selectively and effectively inhibited the CYP4A11 activity of HLMs (IC = 0.913 M) and HRMs (IC = 0.659 M). These results indicated that luciferin-4A -demethylase activity is a good CYP4A11 marker of HLMs and HRMs, and that epalrestat is a more selective CYP4A11 inhibitor compared with known CYP4 inhibitors.Copyright © 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9701713>Characterization of endothelium- dependent relaxation in guinea pig basilar artery - effect of hypoxia and role of cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenase.</a></h2><p>In the guinea pig basilar artery, acetylcholine and the calcium ionophore A23187 induced endothelium-dependent relaxations, which were not significantly affected by the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor Nomega-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG; 0.3 mM) or the guanylate cyclase inhibitor ODQ (1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxaline-1-one; 1-10 microM), or by these inhibitors combined. However, acetylcholine (10 microM) and A23187 (3 microM) each significantly increased the tissue level of cGMP in the absence but not in the presence of L-NOARG, suggesting that NO is released from the vascular endothelium in this blood vessel. Treatment with the potassium (K) channel inhibitors charybdotoxin (0.1 microM) plus apamin (0.1 microM), a toxin mixture previously shown to inhibit relaxations mediated by endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) in this artery, had no effect on the A23187-induced relaxation but slightly inhibited the response to acetylcholine (Emax was reduced by 24%). When the action of EDHF was prevented by these K channel inhibitors, the remaining relaxation was abolished by either ODQ (1 microM) or L-NOARG (0.3 mM), indicating that NO, apart from EDHF, contributes to the endothelium-dependent relaxations. Furthermore, ODQ (10 microM) abolished the relaxation induced by the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine. Thus, activation of soluble guanylate cyclase seems to be the only mechanism through which NO causes relaxation in this artery. When vessels were exposed to grave hypoxia (pO2 = 6 mm Hg), the NO-mediated relaxation (induced by acetylcholine in the presence of charybdotoxin plus apamin) disappeared. In contrast, EDHF-mediated responses (elicited by acetylcholine in the presence of L-NOARG) were only marginally affected by hypoxia (Emax was reduced by 16%).  (50 microM) and 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (10 microM), inhibitors of cytochrome P450-dependent oxidation of arachidonic acid, failed to inhibit the acetylcholine-induced relaxation in the presence of L-NOARG. The cytochrome P450-dependent arachidonic acid metabolite 11,12-epoxyecosatrienoic acid (0.3-3.0 microM) had no relaxant effect per se. In conclusion, EDHF and NO are both mediators of endothelium-dependent relaxations in the guinea pig basilar artery. However, during grave hypoxia, EDHF alone mediates acetylcholine-induced relaxation. The results further suggest that EDHF is not a metabolite of arachidonic acid formed by cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenase or generated by another oxygen-dependent enzyme in this artery.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10493105>20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and renal function in Lyon hypertensive rats.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the contribution of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) metabolites of arachidonic acid in the increased renal vascular resistance and blunted pressure-natriuresis response exhibited by Lyon hypertensive (LH) rats, the effects of an intrarenal infusion of  (3 microM), an inhibitor of the formation of epoxyeicosatrienoic and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, were compared in 8-week-old LH and low blood pressure (LL) control rats.  failed to affect renal function in LL rats.

Arteries from OZR exhibited increased myogenic activation versus LZR; this increase was impaired by endothelium denudation or nitric oxde synthase inhibition. Treatment of vessels with  impaired responses in both strains by comparable amounts. Dihydroethidine microfluorography indicated elevated vascular superoxide levels in OZR versus LZR; immunohistochemistry demonstrated elevated vascular nitrotyrosine levels in OZR, indicating increased peroxynitrite presence. Vessel treatment with oxidative radical scavengers (polythylene glycol-superoxide dismutase/catalase) or inhibition of Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (K(Ca)) channels (iberiotoxin) did not alter myogenic activation in LZR but normalized activation in OZR. Application of peroxynitrite to vessels of OZR caused a greater vasoconstriction versus LZR; the response was impaired in OZR by elevated intraluminal pressure and was abolished in both strains by iberiotoxin. These results suggest that enhanced myogenic activation of gracilis arteries of OZR versus LZR 1) is not due to alterations in cytochrome P-450 contribution, and 2) may be due to elevated peroxynitrite levels inhibiting K(Ca) channels following increased intraluminal pressure.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p></html>
