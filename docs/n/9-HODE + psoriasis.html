Extracted phospholipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography. The isolated fractions of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (PE) were treated with phospholipase A2 to release fatty acids in the sn-2 position. Released MHFAs were separated by reversed-phase and straight-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and identified as the linoleic acid derivatives 9-hydroxy-octadecadienoic acid () and 13-hydroxy-octadecadienoic acid (13-HODE) and as the arachidonic acid derivative 15-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE). These findings are consistent with the presence of unesterified , 13-HODE and 15-HETE. In contrast, 12-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), although found to be present in high amounts as unesterified 12-HETE, was not detectable in the phospholipids. When compared with non-lesional psoriatic skin, the levels of , 13-HODE and 15-HETE esterified to the sn-2 position of PC, PI and PE in lesional psoriatic skin were significantly decreased (to 28-78% of those in non-lesional skin). This depletion of MHFAs in specific phospholipids may be due to an imbalance between phospholipase and acyltransferase activities. Because the levels of esterified MHFAs may influence signal transduction and eicosanoid metabolism the described changes may be relevant for the inflammatory processes occurring in .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3113487>Conversion of linoleic acid and arachidonic acid by skin epidermal lipoxygenases.</a></h2><p>Two different lipoxygenases have been identified in human and rat epidermis. One lipoxygenase has a (n-9)-specificity, converts arachidonic acid into 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), and has been described by several investigators. Linoleic acid is not a substrate for this enzyme. The other lipoxygenase, with (n-6)-specificity, converts arachidonic acid into 15-HETE and linoleic acid into 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HOD). Especially the latter lipoxygenase is thought to be involved in the regulation of the differentiation of the skin cells into a proper water-barrier layer. Linoleate is supposed to be the physiological substrate; this fatty acid is especially present in characteristic sphingolipids with unique structures.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2994785>Inhibition of ionophore-stimulated leukotriene B4 production in human leucocytes by monohydroxy fatty acids.</a></h2><p>Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) release by calcium ionophore-stimulated human leucocytes was measured by use of selective solvent partition of reaction mixtures and an agarose microdroplet chemokinesis assay, and the inhibitory effects of four monohydroxy fatty acids were determined. 15-Hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) was the most effective inhibitor of LTB4 production with an approximate IC50 value of 6 microM and 99% inhibition at 50 microM, whereas 13-hydroxy-octadecadienoic acid (13-HODD) and 12-HETE were weaker inhibitors with approximate IC50 values of 32 microM and 23 microM, and 59% and 68% inhibition at 50 microM, respectively. We suggest that 13-HODD and 12-HETE, which are present in large amounts in the lesions of the skin disease , may act as endogenous modulators of 5-lipoxygenase activity in skin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15833297>Improved enantioselective analysis of polyunsaturated hydroxy fatty acids in psoriatic skin scales using high-performance liquid chromatography.</a></h2><p>Enantioselective analysis is used as a valuable tool for determining the biological origin of chiral derivatives of arachidonic, 11,14-eicosadienoic and linoleic acid in psoriatic skin scales and for clarifying their role in pathogenesis. This paper reports on a simple and rapid enantioselective determination (without any derivatization) of the fatty acid derivatives 13(R,S)-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid [13(R,S)-HODE], 9(R,S)-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid [9(R,S)-HODE] and 12(R,S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid [12(R,S)-HETE], using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with Chiralpak AD as the chiral selector and electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The enantiomeric distribution of 12-HETE,  and 13-HODE in psoriatic skin scales of untreated patients (untreated during the last 4 weeks before sampling) was evaluated in comparison to psoriatic skin scales of patients underlying systemic treatment. The enantiomeric distribution of 12-HETE and  showed no remarkable differences, whilst samples of patients under systemic treatment exhibited a lower predominance of 13(S)-HODE than samples of untreated patients. Furthermore, the effect of UVB phototherapy on the enantiomeric distribution of 12-HETE,  and 13-HODE was studied and a semiquantitation of these compounds in psoriatic skin scales performed. The detected amounts of  in samples of untreated patients were remarkably lower than those in samples of patients underlying systemic treatment. In the case of UVB phototherapy, no influence on the enantiomeric distribution could be observed.</p></html>
