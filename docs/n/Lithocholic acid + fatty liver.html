Dyslipidemia and its related disorders, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD),  and other metabolic diseases, are of increasing public health concern due to their increasing prevalence in the population. Besides their well-characterized functions in cholesterol homoeostasis and nutrient absorption, bile acids are also important metabolic regulators and function as signaling hormones by activating specific nuclear receptors, G-protein coupled receptors, and multiple signaling pathways. Recent studies identified a new signaling pathway by which conjugated bile acids (CBA) activate the extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK1/2) and protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway via sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2). CBA-induced activation of S1PR2 is a key regulator of sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2) and hepatic gene expression. This review focuses on recent findings related to the role of bile acids/S1PR2-mediated signaling pathways in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12479568>The effect of charge reversal mutations in the alpha-helical region of    binding protein on the binding of -acyl CoAs, lysophospholipids and bile acids.</a></h2><p>   binding protein (LFABP) is unique among the various types of FABPs in that it can bind a variety of ligands in addition to  acids. LFABP is able to bind long chain  acids with a 2:1 stoichiometry and the crystal structure has identified two   binding sites in the binding cavity. The presumed primary site (site 1) involves the   binding with the carboxylate group buried in the cavity whereas the   at site 2 has the carboxylate group solvent-exposed within the ligand portal region and in the vicinity of alpha-helix II. The alpha-helical region contains three cationic residues, K20, K31, K33 and modelling studies suggest that K31 on alpha-helix II could make an electrostatic contribution to anionic ligands binding to site 2. The preparation of three charge reversal mutants of LFABP, K20E, K31E and K33E has allowed an investigation of the role of site 2 in ligand binding, particularly those ligands with a bulky anionic head group. The binding of oleoyl CoA, lysophosphatidic , lysophosphatidylcholine,  and taurolithocholate 3-sulphate to LFABP has been studied using the alpha-helical mutants. The results support the concept that such ligands bind at site 2 of LFABP where solvent exposure allows the accommodation of their bulky anionic group.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5858718>Lipogenesis and cholesterol turnover in the chick as influenced by dietary .</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/443203>Serum glycine-conjugated bile acids in pediatric hepatobiliary disorders.</a></h2><p>Measurements of serum bile acids (glycine conjugates of cholic, chenodeoxycholic, deoxycholic, and  acids) by radioimmunoassay in a variety of pediatric hepatobiliary disorders showed elevations in neonatal hepatitis syndromes, cholestasis, and hepatitis of extrahepatic or intrahepatic origin. Measurements of individual serum bile acids failed to differentiate between the various neonatal hepatitis syndromes. In one patient with cholestasis, the increased levels of bile acids observed returned to normal following therapy with cholestyramine and phenobarbital. In chronic active hepatitis the serum bile  values correlated well with the bilirubin and SGOT in response to therapy with corticosteroids. These data confirm suggestions that serum cholylglycine and chenodeoxycholylglycine levels are a sensitive indicator of disturbed hepatic function and can be used in monitoring the course, activity, and therapeutic response in various hepatitis syndromes. In Reye's syndrome and protracted diarrhea of infancy, elevations in serum bile acids were detected without associated hyperbilirubinemia and provided additional evidence of disturbed hepatic function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30647436>A pilot study of the effect of phospholipid curcumin on serum metabolomic profile in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.</a></h2><p>Curcumin, a natural polyphenol compound in the spice turmeric, has been found to have potent anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activity. Curcumin may treat non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) through its beneficial effects on biomarkers of oxidative stress (OS) and inflammation, which are considered as two feature of this disease. However, the effects of curcumin on NAFLD have been remained poorly understood. This investigation evaluated the effects of administrating curcumin on metabolic status in NAFLD patients.Fifty-eight NAFLD patients participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel design of study. The subjects were allocated randomly into two groups, which either received 250 mg phospholipid curcumin or placebo, one capsule per day for a period of 8 weeks. Fasting blood samples were taken from each subject at the start and end of the study period. Subsequently, metabolomics analysis was performed for serum samples using NMR.Compared with the placebo, supplementing phospholipid curcumin resulted in significant decreases in serum including 3- methyl-2-oxovaleric , 3-hydroxyisobutyrate, kynurenine, succinate, citrate, α-ketoglutarate, methylamine, trimethylamine, hippurate, indoxyl sulfate, chenodeoxycholic , taurocholic , and . This profile of metabolic biomarkers could distinguish effectively NAFLD subjects who were treated with curcumin and placebo groups, achieving value of 0.99 for an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).Characterizing the serum metabolic profile of the patients with NAFLD at the end of the intervention using NMR-based metabolomics method indicated that the targets of curcumin treatment included some amino acids, TCA cycle, bile acids, and gut microbiota.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819989>Bile acids are nutrient signaling hormones.</a></h2><p>Bile salts play crucial roles in allowing the gastrointestinal system to digest, transport and metabolize nutrients. They function as nutrient signaling hormones by activating specific nuclear receptors (FXR, PXR, Vitamin D) and G-protein coupled receptors [TGR5, sphingosine-1 phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2), muscarinic receptors]. Bile acids and insulin appear to collaborate in regulating the metabolism of nutrients in the liver. They both activate the AKT and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Bile  induction of the FXR-α target gene, small heterodimer partner (SHP), is highly dependent on the activation PKCζ, a branch of the insulin signaling pathway. SHP is an important regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism in the liver. One might hypothesize that chronic low grade inflammation which is associated with insulin resistance, may inhibit bile  signaling and disrupt lipid metabolism. The disruption of these signaling pathways may increase the risk of fatty liver and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Finally, conjugated bile acids appear to promote cholangiocarcinoma growth via the activation of S1PR2.Copyright © 2014.

The characteristics of hepatic and extrahepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activities toward these bile acids were compared with respect to kinetic parameters and other catalytic properties.

Primary bile acids such as cholic  and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) are produced in the liver, and converted into secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic  (DCA) and  by gut microbiota. Here we investigated the possible roles of bile acids in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis and the impact of the gut microbiome on bile  signalling in NAFLD.Serum bile  levels and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), liver gene expression profiles and gut microbiome compositions were determined in patients with NAFLD, high-fat diet-fed rats and their controls.Serum concentrations of primary and secondary bile acids were increased in patients with NAFLD. In per cent, the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) antagonistic DCA was increased, while the agonistic CDCA was decreased in NAFLD. Increased mRNA expression for cytochrome P450 7A1, Na-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide and paraoxonase 1, no change in mRNA expression for small heterodimer partner and bile salt export pump, and reduced serum FGF19 were evidence of impaired FXR and fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4)-mediated signalling in NAFLD. Taurine and glycine metabolising bacteria were increased in the gut of patients with NAFLD, reflecting increased secondary bile  production. Similar changes in liver gene expression and the gut microbiome were observed in high-fat diet-fed rats.The serum bile  profile, the hepatic gene expression pattern and the gut microbiome composition consistently support an elevated bile  production in NAFLD. The increased proportion of FXR antagonistic bile  explains, at least in part, the suppression of hepatic FXR-mediated and FGFR4-mediated signalling. Our study suggests that future NAFLD intervention may target the components of FXR signalling, including the bile  converting gut microbiome.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

Excessive alcohol consumption causes alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD). Ginger has been reported to exhibit antioxidant potential and hepatoprotective activity. In the present study, a mouse model for AFLD was developed by employing male C57BL/6 mice that were fed an alcohol-containing liquid diet (Lieber-DeCarli diet) ad libitum. In the treatment groups, ginger essential oil (GEO) and citral were orally administered every day for 4 weeks. Serum biochemical analysis, antioxidant enzyme activity analysis, and histopathological evaluation revealed that GEO and citral exhibited hepatoprotective activity against AFLD. Metabolites in serum samples were profiled by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-QTOF-MS). Metabolomic data indicated the amounts of metabolites such as d-glucurono-6,3-lactone, glycerol-3-phosphate, pyruvic , , 2-pyrocatechuic , and prostaglandin E1 were increased after alcohol administration, but the levels were recovered in treatment groups.

However, the implication of these mechanisms is unclear because of the low bioavailability of BBR. Because the main action site of BBR is the gut and intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of lipid metabolism, we hypothesized that the effects of BBR on intestinal FXR signaling pathway might account for its pharmacological effectiveness. Using wild type (WT) and intestine-specific FXR knockout (FXR) mice, we found that BBR prevented the development of high-fat-diet-induced  and ameliorated triglyceride accumulation in livers of WT, but not FXR mice. BBR increased conjugated bile acids in serum and their excretion in feces. Furthermore, BBR inhibited bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity in gut microbiota, and significantly increased the levels of tauro-conjugated bile acids, especially tauro-cholic (TCA), in the intestine. Both BBR and TCA treatment activated the intestinal FXR pathway and reduced the expression of fatty- translocase Cd36 in the liver. These results indicate that BBR may exert its lipid-lowering effect primarily in the gut by modulating the turnover of bile acids and subsequently the ileal FXR signaling pathway. In summary, we provide the first evidence to suggest a new mechanism of BBR action in the intestine that involves, sequentially, inhibiting BSH, elevating TCA, and activating FXR, which lead to the suppression of hepatic expression of Cd36 that results in reduced uptake of long-chain fatty acids in the liver.Copyright © 2016 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28585279>Serum bile  level and   composition in Chinese children with non-alcoholic  disease.</a></h2><p>To determine serum bile  (BA) and   (FA) profiles in Chinese children with non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD).A total 76 children aged 4-17 years were categorized into three groups according to the presence and absence of as well as the severity of NAFLD, that is, non-NAFLD (control), mild and moderate to severe NAFLD groups, respectively, based on their  ultrasonography findings.

Western blot analysis of positive colonies, using anti-rat  UGT antibodies, revealed the presence of an immunoreactive polypeptide of the expected molecular mass of 52 kDa. The substrate specificity of the recombinant enzyme toward > 100 compounds was determined. Phenolic and alcoholic substrates included 4-methylumbelliferone, 4-hydroxybiphenyl, chloramphenicol, and testosterone, but a range of carboxylic acids of both endogenous (medium-chain saturated  acids, long-chain polyunsaturated  acids, and bile acids) and exogenous (profen nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, fibrate hypolipidemic agents, and sodium valproate) origin were also accepted, indicating that the enzyme was capable of forming both ether- and ester-type glucuronides from various structurally unrelated compounds. Determination of apparent kinetic constants for the glucuronidation by UGT2B1 of selected aglycones revealed a high maximal velocity toward the 3-position of morphine (49.3 +/- 2.2 nmol/min/mg of protein), compared with other known substrates such as 4-methylumbelliferone (2.67 +/- 0.11 nmol/min/mg of protein) or clofibric  (0.06 +/- 0.02 nmol/min/mg of protein). To gain a better insight into the mechanisms underlying the apparently wide substrate specificity of UGT2B1, series of structurally related compounds were tested as potential substrates. The rate of glucuronidation of unbranched saturated  acids and omega,omega,omega-triphenylalkanoic acids increased progressively with increasing alkyl chain length and then declined, with the best substrates in these two homologous series being decanoic  and 4,4,4-triphenylbutanoic , respectively. Glucuronidation of para-substituted phenols always proceeded at a higher rate than that of the corresponding para-substituted benzoic acids. This could mean that the aglycon hydroxyl group was better positioned in the enzyme active site in the case of phenols. Alternatively, if the initial interaction with the enzyme required the aglycon to be in the protonated uncharged form, then the observation could be explained by the difference in ionization between phenols and benzoic acids at the incubation pH used. The introduction of a bulky alkyl group into the para-position led to increases of up to 300-fold in the rate of glucuronidation, probably as a result of the increased aglycon lipophilicity. Finally, the enzyme showed a degree of stereo- and regiospecificity, preferring (S)-ibuprofen to the R-enantiomer (Vmax/Km, 3.06 and 1.10 microliters/min/mg of protein, respectively) and glucuronidating  but not hyodeoxycholic , which differs by only a single hydroxyl group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9862274>Studies of cholesterol and bile  metabolism, and early atherogenesis in hamsters fed GT16-239, a novel bile  sequestrant (BAS).</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of GT16-239, an alkylated, cross-linked poly(allylamine) bile  sequestrant with cholestyramine on cholesterol and bile  metabolism, and early aortic atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic male F1B Golden Syrian hamsters.

We tested the novel hypothesis that naturally occurring bile acids interfere with protein-mediated hepatic long chain free   (LCFA) uptake. To this end, stable cell lines expressing   transporters as well as primary hepatocytes from mouse and human livers were incubated with primary and secondary bile acids to determine their effects on LCFA uptake rates. We identified ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) and deoxycholic  (DCA) as the two most potent inhibitors of the -specific   transport protein 5 (FATP5). Both UDCA and DCA were able to inhibit LCFA uptake by primary hepatocytes in a FATP5-dependent manner. Subsequently, mice were treated with these secondary bile acids in vivo to assess their ability to inhibit diet-induced hepatic triglyceride accumulation. Administration of DCA in vivo via injection or as part of a high-fat diet significantly inhibited hepatic   uptake and reduced  triglycerides by more than 50%.The data demonstrate a novel role for specific bile acids, and the secondary bile  DCA in particular, in the regulation of hepatic LCFA uptake. The results illuminate a previously unappreciated means by which specific bile acids, such as UDCA and DCA, can impact hepatic triglyceride metabolism and may lead to novel approaches to combat obesity-associated  disease.Copyright © 2012 American Association for the Study of  Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1148165>Interactions of bilirubin and other ligands with ligandin.</a></h2><p>Circular dichroism methods were used to study the structure of rat ligandin and the binding of organic anions to the protein. Ligandin has a highly ordered secondary structure with about 40%alpha helix, 15% beta structure, and 45% random coil. Bilirubin binding occurred primarily at a single high affinity site on the protein. The binding constant for bilirubin (5 X 10-7 Mminus 1) was the highest among the ligands studied. The bilirubin-ligandin complex exhibited a well-defined circular dichroic spectrum with two major overlapping ellipticity bands of opposite sign in the bilirubin absorption region. This spectrum was virtually a mirror image of that of human or rat serum albumin-bilirubin complexes. Studies on the direct transfer of bilirubin from ligandin to rat serum albumin showed that sasociation constants of bilirubin-ligandin complexes were approximately tenfold less than those of the bilirubin-albumin system. Ligandin exhibited a broad specificity with respect to the typeof ligand bond. A series of organic anions inclucing dyes used clinically for  function tests,  acids, hormones, heme derivatives, bile acids, and other ligands that were considered likely to interact with ligandin, were examined. Most induced ellipticity changes consistent with competitive displacement of bilirubin from ligandin and relative affinities of these compounds for ligandin were determined based on their effectiveness in desplacing the bilirubin. Some substances such as glutathione, conjugated sulfobromophthaleins and  bound to ligandin but induced anomalous spectral shifts, when added to ligandin-bilirubin complexes.

Photoaffinity labeling of isolated hepatocytes with [3H]-7,7-ASLCT on the one hand and with [3H]-7,7-ACT and [3H]-7,7-ALCT on the other resulted in a different labeling pattern of cytosolic polypeptides, without a relevant incorporation of radioactivity into subunits of glutathione transferases. This suggests that glutathione transferases play no role in the transport of dianionic or of monoanionic bile salts. With [3H]-7,7-ACT and [3H]-7,7-ALCT a moderate incorporation of radioactivity was found in polypeptides with apparent M(r)s of 33,000, 38,000, and 54,000, whereas with [3H]-7,7-ASLCT, a polypeptide with an apparent M(r) of 14,000, identified as H-FABP, was markedly and almost exclusively labeled. Photoaffinity labeling of specimens of intact  tissue resulted in a labeling pattern of cytosolic polypeptides comparable to that obtained from photolabeled isolated hepatocytes. All results suggest that transcellular transport of dianionic sulfated as well as taurine-conjugated bile salts and of monoanionic taurine-conjugated bile salts follows different pathways. In intracellular transport of taurine-conjugated bile salts, several cytosolic polypeptides may have a function, whereas, in transport of taurine-conjugated 3 alpha-sulfato bile salts, only H-FABP appears to be involved.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6744824>Distribution and some properties of bile salt-binding proteins in rainbow trout, Salmo gairdneri.</a></h2><p>Trout  cytosol has proteins that bind bile salts and 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulphonate and that co-elute from Sephadex G-75.

The bile--activated nuclear receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), plays a pivotal role in regulating bile , lipid and glucose homeostasis as well as in regulating the inflammatory responses, barrier function and prevention of bacterial translocation in the intestinal tract. As expected, FXR is involved in the pathophysiology of a wide range of diseases of gastrointestinal tract, including inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer and type 2 diabetes. In this review, we discuss current knowledge of the roles of FXR in physiology of the digestive system and the related diseases. Better understanding of the roles of FXR in digestive system will accelerate the development of FXR ligands/modulators for the treatment of digestive system diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31384531>Ablation of gut microbiota alleviates -induced hepatic steatosis and glucose intolerance by modulating bile  metabolism in hamsters.</a></h2><p>Since metabolic process differs between humans and mice, studies were performed in hamsters, which are generally considered to be a more appropriate animal model for studies of -related metabolic disorders. The modulation of gut microbiota, bile acids and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) axis is correlated with -induced insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in mice. However, the interactions among the gut microbiota, bile acids and FXR in metabolic disorders remained largely unexplored in hamsters. In the current study, hamsters fed a 60% high-fat diet (HFD) were administered vehicle or an antibiotic cocktail by gavage twice a week for four weeks. Antibiotic treatment alleviated HFD-induced glucose intolerance, hepatic steatosis and inflammation accompanied with decreased hepatic lipogenesis and elevated thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT). In the livers of antibiotic-treated hamsters, cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily B member 1 (CYP7B1) in the alternative bile  synthesis pathway was upregulated, contributing to a more hydrophilic bile  profile with increased tauro--muricholic  (TMCA). The intestinal FXR signaling was suppressed but remained unchanged in the liver. This study is of potential translational significance in determining the role of gut microbiota-mediated bile  metabolism in modulating diet-induced glucose intolerance and hepatic steatosis in the hamster.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3940210>Effects of dietary saturated and unsaturated  acids on fecal bile acids and colon carcinogenesis induced by azoxymethane in rats.</a></h2><p>To determine whether the kind of dietary fat affects colon carcinogenesis, male Donryu rats were fed a 5% fat diet containing linoleate, an unsaturated fat, or stearate, a saturated fat, in semipurified fat-free chow. The rats were given azoxymethane (7.4 mg/kg body weight) s.c. once a week for 11 weeks and killed 15 weeks after the last injection of the carcinogen. The rats on the unsaturated fat diet had a significantly higher incidence of colon tumors.   analysis of cholesterol esters in the  and examination of the amount of fecal bile acids showed that the unsaturated fat diet increased the level of cholesterol linoleate and arachidonate in the  and also increased the fecal excretion of bile acids, especially that of . The colon tumors in rats on the unsaturated fat diet, compared with those in rats on the saturated fat diet, contained a higher level of lysophosphatidylcholine. These results suggest that increased fecal excretion of bile acids due to increased polyunsaturated cholesterol esters in the  stimulates phospholipase A2 activity of colon initiated cells and enhances colon carcinogenesis in rats on the unsaturated fat diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4745517>Hypercholesterolemic effect in the female rat of egg yolk versus crystalline cholesterol dissolved in lard.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27203081>Bile Acids and Dysbiosis in Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by dysbiosis. The bidirectional effects between intestinal microbiota (IM) and bile acids (BA) suggest that dysbiosis may be accompanied by an altered bile  (BA) homeostasis, which in turn can contribute to the metabolic dysregulation seen in NAFLD. This study sought to examine BA homeostasis in patients with NAFLD and to relate that with IM data.This was a prospective, cross-sectional study of adults with biopsy-confirmed NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver: NAFL or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: NASH) and healthy controls (HC). Clinical and laboratory data, stool samples and 7-day food records were collected. Fecal BA profiles, serum markers of BA synthesis 7-alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4) and intestinal BA signalling, as well as IM composition were assessed.53 subjects were included: 25 HC, 12 NAFL and 16 NASH. Levels of total fecal BA, cholic  (CA), chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) and BA synthesis were higher in patients with NASH compared to HC (p<0.05 for all comparisons). The primary to secondary BA ratio was higher in NASH compared to HC (p = 0.004), but ratio of conjugated to unconjugated BAs was not different between the groups. Bacteroidetes and Clostridium leptum counts were decreased in in a subset of 16 patients with NASH compared to 25 HC, after adjusting for body mass index and weight-adjusted calorie intake (p = 0.028 and p = 0.030, respectively). C. leptum was positively correlated with fecal unconjugated  (LCA) (r = 0.526, p = 0.003) and inversely with unconjugated CA (r = -0.669, p<0.0001) and unconjugated CDCA (r = - 0.630, p<0.0001). FGF19 levels were not different between the groups (p = 0.114).In adults with NAFLD, dysbiosis is associated with altered BA homeostasis, which renders them at increased risk of hepatic injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23370405>Different diets cause alterations in the enteric environment and trigger changes in the expression of hepatic cytochrome P450 3A, a drug-metabolizing enzyme.</a></h2><p>Changes in the expression level and activity of cytochrome P450 (CYP) in the liver are caused by various factors and affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the expression of CYP3A is affected by a high-fat diet. In addition, we examined whether the type of diet given to mice could produce changes in the expression level and activity of CYP3A. Mice were fed a purified diet containing 10 kcal% lard (control group) or 60 kcal% lard (HF group) or regular mouse chow containing 13 kcal% of fat (MF group) for 4 weeks. No significant differences were observed in the hepatic CYP3A protein expression level between the HF group and the control group. The CYP3A protein expression in the MF group was significantly higher than that observed in the control group. In the MF group, the area under the curve (AUC) of intraperitoneally administered triazolam was lower. Because  (LCA) is known to increase hepatic CYP3A expression, the levels of Clostridium sordellii and LCA in the feces were measured. In the MF group, the levels of Clostridium sordellii and LCA were higher. It has been demonstrated that a high-fat diet does not cause any changes in hepatic CYP3A expression. In addition, the different diets caused alterations in the enteric environment, which triggered changes in CYP3A expression. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully consider the type of feed while performing animal experiments to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of drugs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7367826>Urinary bile  excretion in correlation to  histopathology in cystic fibrosis.</a></h2><p>Urinary bile  excretion and  morphology were compared in 25 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). None showed clinical signs of  disease. Most of the patients had normal  function tests. Bile acids were determined in 24-h samples by a modification of the method of Almé. All patients had increased urinary excretion of trihydroxy bile acids, mainly cholic, 3 beta, 7 beta, 12 alpha- and 3 alpha, 7 beta, 12 alpha-trihydroxy-5 beta-cholanoic acids.  excretion was lower in CF than in normal children. The urinary excretion of 3 beta-hydroxy-5-cholenoic  was not increased in CF. In three patients with cirrhosis the urinary excretion of chenodeoxycholic  was increased. The ratio of cholic to 3 beta-hydroxy-5-cholenoic acids was increased in all but three patients, and the ratio of chenodeoxycholic to 3 beta-hydroxy-5-cholenoic acids was increased in those with cirrhosis.

We hypothesized that the complex interrelated impairments in cardiac structure and function secondary to progression of  diseases involve alterations in signaling pathways engaged in cardiac energy metabolism and hypertrophy, augmented by direct effects of high circulating levels of bile acids. Biliary fibrosis was induced in male C57BL/6J mice by feeding a 0.1% 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydroxychollidine (DDC) supplemented diet. After 3 weeks, mice underwent live imaging (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry [DEXA] scanning, two-dimensional echocardiography [2DE], electrocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging), exercise treadmill testing, and histological and biochemical analyses of livers and hearts. Compared with chow-fed mice, DDC-fed mice fatigued earlier on the treadmill, with reduced VO(2). Marked changes were identified electrophysiologically (bradycardia and prolonged QT interval) and functionally (hyperdynamic left ventricular [LV] contractility along with increased LV thickness). Hearts of DDC-fed mice showed hypertrophic signaling (activation of v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene/protein kinase B [AKT], inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta [GSK3beta], a 20-fold up-regulation of beta myosin heavy chain RNA and elevated G(s)alpha/G(i)alpha ratio. Genes regulating cardiac   oxidation pathways were suppressed, along with a threefold increase in myocardial glycogen content. Treatment of mouse cardiomyocytes (which express the membrane bile  receptor TGR5) with potent natural TGR5 agonists, taurochenodeoxycholic  and , activated AKT and inhibited GSK3beta, similar to the changes seen in DDC-fed mouse hearts. This provides support for a novel mechanism whereby circulating natural bile acids can induce signaling pathways in heart associated with hypertrophy.Three weeks of DDC feeding-induced biliary fibrosis leads to multiple functional, metabolic, electrophysiological, and hypertrophic adaptations in the mouse heart, recapitulating some of the features of human cirrhotic cardiomyopathy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27273788>Dysregulated hepatic bile acids collaboratively promote liver carcinogenesis.</a></h2><p>Dysregulated bile acids (BAs) are closely associated with liver diseases and attributed to altered gut microbiota. Here, we show that the intrahepatic retention of hydrophobic BAs including deoxycholate (DCA), taurocholate (TCA), taurochenodeoxycholate (TCDCA), and taurolithocholate (TLCA) were substantially increased in a streptozotocin and high fat diet (HFD) induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-hepatocellular carcinoma (NASH-HCC) mouse model. Additionally chronic HFD-fed mice spontaneously developed liver tumors with significantly increased hepatic BA levels. Enhancing intestinal excretion of hydrophobic BAs in the NASH-HCC model mice by a 2% cholestyramine feeding significantly prevented HCC development. The gut microbiota alterations were closely correlated with altered BA levels in liver and feces. HFD-induced inflammation inhibited key BA transporters, resulting in sustained increases in intrahepatic BA concentrations. Our study also showed a significantly increased cell proliferation in BA treated normal human hepatic cell lines and a down-regulated expression of tumor suppressor gene CEBPα in TCDCA treated HepG2 cell line, suggesting that several hydrophobic BAs may collaboratively promote liver carcinogenesis.© 2016 UICC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/962892>The metabolism of steroids in the  induced by orotic  feeding.</a></h2><p>1.

However, how hepatocyte VDR is involved in setting up steatosis remains unclear. The authors transduced human hepatocyte-derived cells with an adenoviral vector encoding human VDR and found that angiopoietin-like protein 8 (ANGPTL8) expression was increased upon VDR activation by vitamin D or . The mRNA levels of hepatic VDR- and vitamin D-related genes [cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2R1, CYP27A1, and CYP3A4] were higher in NAFL patients compared with normal liver subjects. Noteworthy, hepatic ANGPTL8 mRNA and protein levels were elevated in NAFL patients, and its mRNA correlated with VDR mRNA and with the steatosis grade. Moreover, increases in serum conjugated bile acids, including the VDR agonist glycine-, were observed in NAFL patients. Additionally, free fatty acids and insulin were able to up-regulate both VDR and ANGPTL8 mRNA in human hepatocytes, whereas ANGPTL8 gene knockdown attenuated free fatty acids-induced triglyceride accumulation in these cells. In conclusion, activated VDR up-regulates ANGPTL8 expression, contributing to triglyceride accumulation in human hepatocytes. Moreover, hepatic ANGPTL8 mRNA positively correlates with VDR mRNA content and the grade of steatosis in NAFL patients, suggesting that this novel pathway may play a key role in the pathogenesis of hepatosteatosis.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

Although pregnenolone-16 alpha-carbonitrile (PCN)-mediated protection against LCA-induced hepatocyte injury may be explained by induction of drug metabolizing enzymes, the protection from the delayed cholestasis remains incompletely understood. Thus, the PCN-mediated protective mechanism has been studied from the point of modification of lipid metabolism. At an early stage of LCA feeding, an imbalance of biliary bile  and phospholipid excretion was observed. Co-treatment with PCN reversed the increase in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) as well as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities and hepatic hydrophobic bile  levels. LCA feeding decreased hepatic mRNA levels of several  - and phospholipid-related genes before elevation of serum ALT and ALP activities. On the other hand, PCN co-treatment reversed the decrease in the mRNA levels and hepatic levels of phospholipids, triglycerides and free  acids. PCN co-treatment also reversed the decrease in biliary phospholipid output in LCA-fed mice. Treatment with PCN alone increased hepatic phospholipid, triglyceride and free   concentrations. Hepatic   and phosphatidylcholine synthetic activities increased in mice treated with PCN alone or PCN and LCA, compared to control mice, whereas these activities decreased in LCA-fed mice. These results suggest the possibility that PCN-mediated stimulation of lipogenesis contributes to the protection from -induced hepatotoxicity.(c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The identification of novel and potent GPBAR1 agonists is highly relevant, as these diseases are on the rise and pharmacological unmet therapeutic needs are pervasive. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a proficient workflow for the  prediction of GPBAR1 activating compounds, primarily from natural sources. A protocol was set up, starting with a comprehensive collection of structural information of known ligands. This information was used to generate ligand-based pharmacophore models in LigandScout 4.08 Advanced. After theoretical validation, the two most promising models, namely BAMS22 and TTM8, were employed as queries for the virtual screening of natural product and synthetic small molecule databases. Virtual hits were progressed to shape matching experiments and physicochemical clustering. Out of 33 diverse virtual hits subjected to experimental testing using a reporter gene-based assay, two natural products, farnesiferol B () and microlobidene (), were confirmed as GPBAR1 activators reaching more than 50% receptor activation at 20 μM with ECs of 13.53 μM and 13.88 μM, respectively. This activity is comparable to that of the endogenous ligand  (). Seven further virtual hits showed activity reaching at least 15% receptor activation either at 5 or 20 μM, including new scaffolds from natural and synthetic origin.</p></html>
