To examine this possibility, total bile  concentrations (sulphated and non-sulphated) were measured by gas-liquid chromatography in inferior mesentric vein serum of 19 patients undergoing colectomy for severe  (IBD). Similar determinations were obtained on a control group of eight patients requiring colectomy for other non- conditions. Mean values for mesenteric vein serum bile  concentrations (muM/1) were 19.6+/-1.8 in controls and 16.3+/-2.0 in IBD. The mean sulphated bile  fraction did not exceed 10% of total, although there was considerable variability (up to 40% of total).  levels (entirely sulphated in all patients) were low. Although the IBD group showed a more than two-fold increase in mean lithocholate concentration (0.54+/-0.15 muM/1) over controls (0.21 +/- muM/1), this difference was not statistically significant. No significant intra-group difference was noted in the non-sulphated and sulphated fractions for cholic, chenodeoxycholic, and deoxycholic  species, respectively. No unidentified or unusual bile acids were observed. There was no correlation between bile  measurements and liver histology. These findings fail to support the hypothesis that liver  often found in association with severe  represents a form of bile  toxicity. The invariable finding of total sulphation of the  fraction even in the presence of severe mucosal  was unexpected.</p><p>Keyword: inflammatory bowel disease</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31472697>Diet-induced remission in chronic enteropathy is associated with altered microbial community structure and synthesis of secondary bile acids.</a></h2><p>The microbiome has been implicated in the initiation and persistence of inflammatory bowel disease. Despite the fact that diet is one of the most potent modulators of microbiome composition and function and that dietary intervention is the first-line therapy for treating pediatric Crohn's disease, the relationships between diet-induced remission, enteropathy, and microbiome are poorly understood. Here, we leverage a naturally-occurring canine model of chronic inflammatory enteropathy that exhibits robust remission following nutritional therapy, to perform a longitudinal study that integrates clinical monitoring, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, metagenomic sequencing, metabolomic profiling, and whole genome sequencing to investigate the relationship between therapeutic diet, microbiome, and disease.We show that remission induced by a hydrolyzed protein diet is accompanied by alterations in microbial community structure marked by decreased abundance of pathobionts (e.g., Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens), reduced severity of dysbiosis, and increased levels of the secondary bile acids,  and deoxycholic . Physiologic levels of these bile acids inhibited the growth of E. coli and C. perfringens isolates, in vitro. Metagenomic analysis and whole genome sequencing identified the bile  producer Clostridium hiranonis as elevated after dietary therapy and a likely source of secondary bile acids during remission. When C. hiranonis was administered to mice, levels of deoxycholic  were preserved and pathology associated with DSS  was ameliorated. Finally, a closely related bile  producer, Clostridium scindens, was associated with diet-induced remission in human pediatric Crohn's disease.These data highlight that remission induced by a hydrolyzed protein diet is associated with improved microbiota structure, an expansion of bile -producing clostridia, and increased levels of secondary bile acids. Our observations from clinical studies of exclusive enteral nutrition in human Crohn's disease, along with our in vitro inhibition assays and in vivo studies in mice, suggest that this may be a conserved response to diet therapy with the potential to ameliorate disease. These findings provide insight into diet-induced remission of gastrointestinal disease and could help guide the rational design of more effective therapeutic diets.</p><p>Keyword: inflammatory bowel disease</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3749801>Bile  metabolism in patients with Crohn's  in terminal ileum.</a></h2><p>Bile  metabolism was studied by means of the fractional turnover rate or orally ingested 14C-labeled taurocholic  and by gas chromatographic determination of fecal excretion of the bile acids cholic  (CA), chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), deoxycholic  (DCA), and  (LCA).

The unoperated group of CD patients did not show significant increase in bile  excretion in the stools in contrast to the CD patients with ileal resection. The fecal excretion consisted mostly of primary bile acids, and a significant correlation between length of resection and bile  excretion was found (rs = 0.81, p less than 0.01). The fractional turnover rate of CA + DCA was significantly increased in both unoperated (0.21 l/day) and operated (0.44 l/day) patients compared with normal controls (0.06 l/day). The bile  pool of CA + DCA, however, was normal in patients with ileal resections, indicating a compensatory increase in bile  synthesis. In unoperated patients the bile  pool of CA + DCA was slightly decreased (3.1 mmol) compared with operated patients (6.2 mmol) and normal controls (4.8 mmol). The pool size was not significantly correlated to mean transit time of dietary residue, feces excretion, loss of weight, or amount of fat in feces.

The vitamin D receptor (VDR), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is a receptor for the active form of vitamin D, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], and mediates vitamin D regulation of specific target gene expression. The secondary bile  , which is produced by intestinal bacteria, is another natural VDR ligand. VDR signaling has been suggested to be involved in reciprocal communication between intestinal cells, including immune and epithelial cells, and intestinal microflora. In addition to epidemiological studies on vitamin D status, genome-wide analyses and cellular and animal experiments have shown that VDR is involved in the prevention of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). VDR deletion in mice exaggerates colitis and colon tumorigenesis in experimental models, and treatment of mice with synthetic vitamin D analogues ameliorates pathological changes in these diseases. Several VDR ligands are less active in increasing serum calcium levels, showing higher therapeutic efficiency than the natural hormone 1,25(OH)2D3. VDR plays a role in intestinal homeostasis and in protection against IBD and CRC. The development of VDR ligands with reduced or no calcemic activity will be necessary to expand clinical application of VDRtargeting therapy.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><p>Keyword: inflammatory bowel disease</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20460897>New insights into autoimmune cholangitis through animal models.</a></h2><p>Improving our understanding of the pathogenesis of chronic immune-mediated cholangiopathies such as primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), as well as the development of novel diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic tools for these disorders critically depends on easily reproducible animal models. Recently, several spontaneous mouse models for PBC (not requiring previous manipulations for breakdown of immunotolerance) have been reported, including NOD.c3c4 and NOD.c3c4-derived mice, IL-2Ralpha(-/-) mice, dominant negative TGF-beta receptor II mice and Ae2(a,b)(-/-) mice. To date, no animal model exhibits all of the attributes of PSC. Rodent models induced by bacterial cell components or colitis may help to explain the strong association between PSC and . Other models include direct injury to biliary epithelia, peribiliary vascular endothelia or portal venous endothelia. Mice with targeted disruption of the Mdr2 (Abcb4) gene encoding a canalicular phospholipid flippase (Mdr2(-/-) mice) spontaneously develop sclerosing cholangitis with macroscopic and microscopic features of human PSC. Another example for a transporter involved in the pathogenesis of sclerosing cholangitis is the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR/ABCC7). Xenobiotics and drugs may also lead to bile duct injury and biliary fibrosis via direct toxic and indirect immune-mediated injury. Hydrophobic bile acids, such as , cause bile duct injury and destructive cholangitis with periductal fibrosis resembling sclerosing cholangitis. These models have enhanced our understanding of the pathogenesis of PBC and PSC and will hopefully result in improved treatment of these disorders.Copyright 2010 S.

Accordingly, we have examined the hypothesis that lithocholate is of etiologic importance in causing this association by measuring serum and biliary lithocholates in  patients with and without liver . Serum and biliary lithocholates and isolithocholates were normal in all patients. Because defective sulfation in the nonhuman primate which allows lithocholate to accumulate in the enterohepatic circulation is thought to be responsible for inducing liver damage and because secondary bile acids are reduced after colectomy and in established liver , we examined thae capacity of all patients to sulfate labeled lithocholate. Effective sulfation of lithocholate was demstrated in all groups.

We examined TGR5 expression in human peripheral blood monocytes, several types of in vitro differentiated macrophages (Mϕs) and dendritic cells.

First published March 30, 2017; doi:10.1152/ajpgi.00256.2016.-Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) comprise a group of common and debilitating chronic intestinal disorders for which currently available therapies are often unsatisfactory. The naturally occurring secondary bile , ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), has well-established anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective actions and may therefore be effective in treating IBD. We aimed to investigate regulation of colonic inflammatory responses by UDCA and to determine the potential impact of bacterial metabolism on its therapeutic actions. The anti-inflammatory efficacy of UDCA, a nonmetabolizable analog, 6α-methyl-UDCA (6-MUDCA), and its primary colonic metabolite  (LCA) was assessed in the murine dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model of mucosal injury. The effects of bile acids on cytokine (TNF-α, IL-6, Il-1β, and IFN-γ) release from cultured colonic epithelial cells and mouse colonic tissue in vivo were investigated. Luminal bile acids were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. UDCA attenuated release of proinflammatory cytokines from colonic epithelial cells in vitro and was protective against the development of colonic inflammation in vivo. In contrast, although 6-MUDCA mimicked the effects of UDCA on epithelial cytokine release in vitro, it was ineffective in preventing inflammation in the DSS model. In UDCA-treated mice, LCA became the most common colonic bile . Finally, LCA treatment more potently inhibited epithelial cytokine release and protected against DSS-induced mucosal inflammation than did UDCA. These studies identify a new role for the primary metabolite of UDCA, LCA, in preventing colonic inflammation and suggest that microbial metabolism of UDCA is necessary for the full expression of its protective actions. On the basis of its cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory actions, the secondary bile  ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) has well-established uses in both traditional and Western medicine. We identify a new role for the primary metabolite of UDCA, , as a potent inhibitor of intestinal inflammatory responses, and we present data to suggest that microbial metabolism of UDCA is necessary for the full expression of its protective effects against colonic inflammation.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: inflammatory bowel disease</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2871479>Bile -induced liver toxicity: relation to the hydrophobic-hydrophilic balance of bile acids.</a></h2><p>Hypertransaminasemia is a frequent side effect during chenodeoxycholic administration for gallstone dissolution. Evidence suggests that this effect is not mediated by , the intestinal metabolite of chenodeoxycholic , but that toxicity is due to the chenodeoxycholic  itself. In vitro cytotoxicity of bile salts is positively proportional to their detergent effect, which is, on the other hand, related to their hydrophobic-hydrophilic balance. We hypothesize that in vivo also liver injury can occur when the liver is perfused by an high proportion of strongly detergent bile salts. The more detergent bile salts are unconjugated or glycine conjugated, while the lesser are taurine conjugated and sulfated. Within each class the following order of decreasing detergent power can be indicated:  greater than deoxycholic greater than chenodeoxycholic greater than cholic greater than ursodeoxycholic . Besides chronic exogenous administration of chenodeoxycholic or deoxycholic acids, conditions in which the liver is perfused by an high mass of highly detergent bile salts are those characterized by an enhanced intestinal biodegradation of bile salts. These conditions, which are common features of some chronic , are frequently associated with liver damage. On the other hand, a normally detergent bile salt pool can become hepatotoxic for liver cells which have already been injured. In this respect, as already reported for increased sulfation, the increased proportion of taurine conjugates and the reduced formation of deoxycholic  in liver cirrhosis can be regarded as protective mechanisms. Liver toxicity induced by bile salts' detergent action can be prevented by favouring tauroconjugation or reducing the intestinal degradation of bile salts or by administering poorly detergent bile salts.</p><p>Keyword: inflammatory bowel disease</p></html>
