Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the alterations in gene expression of drug and  metabolizing cytochrome p450s (cyp450s) in the livers of controlled (CDM) and uncontrolled (UDM) insulin-dependent diabetic mice.Balb/c mice were treated with single dose of streptozocin (240 mg/kg) to induce  and compared with control group, which was treated with citric buffer (pH =4.5). After 3 days, the blood glucose level was measured to confirm the induction of . Normalization of blood glucose level in diabetic mice was achieved after 0.1 mL/kg Mixtard® insulin therapy for more 5 days. Then, the mice livers were isolated to extract RNA and convert it to cDNA. The gene expression of 14 genes, which play a major role in drug and  metabolism, were measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction technique.It was found that the gene expression was downregulated (ANOVA test, -value <0.05) in the livers of UDM mice. The most downregulated genes were , , and  with more than 10-fold reduction. The livers of CDM mice showed significantly (-value <0.05) higher levels of mRNA than UDM mice, but still lower than the non-diabetic mice.This study concluded that hepatic gene expression of drug metabolizing and -  enzymes is reduced in insulin-dependent diabetic mice, which can explain, at least in part, the variation in drug and fatty  metabolism between normal and diabetic patients.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30034871>A review on algae and plants as potential source of .</a></h2><p>Some of the essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) as ARA (, n-6), EPA (eicosapentaenoic , n-3) and DHA (Docosahexaenoic , n-3) cannot be synthesized by mammals and it must be provided as food supplement. ARA and DHA are the major PUFAs that constitute the brain membrane phospholipid. n-3 PUFAs are contained in fish oil and animal sources, while the n-6 PUFAs are mostly provided by vegetable oils. Inappropriate fatty acids consumption from the n-6 and n-3 families is the major cause of chronic diseases as cancer, cardiovascular diseases and . The n-6: n-3 ratio (lower than 10) recommended by the WHO can be achieved by consuming certain edible sources rich in n-3 and n-6 in daily food meal. Many researches have been screened for alternative sources of n-3 and n-6 PUFAs of plant origin, microbes, algae, lower and higher plants, which biosynthesize these valuable PUFAs needed for our body health. Biosynthesis of C PUFAs, in entire plant kingdom, takes place through certain pathways using elongases and desaturases to synthesize their needs of ARA (C-PUFAs). This review is an attempt to highlight the importance and function of PUFAs mainly ARA, its occurrence throughout the plant kingdom (and others), its biosynthetic pathways and the enzymes involved. The methods used to enhance ARA productions through environmental factors and metabolic engineering are also presented. It also deals with advising people that healthy life is affected by their dietary intake of both n-3 and n-6 FAs.

Dietary factors can influence the expression of key genes connected to insulin resistance, lipid metabolism, and adipose tissue composition. In this study, our objective was to determine gene expression and fatty  (FA) profiles in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) from lean and morbidly obese individuals. We also aimed to study the agonist effect of dietary factors on glucose metabolism.Lean and low and high insulin resistance morbidly obese subjects (LIR-MO and HIR-MO) were included in this study. The gene expression of liver X receptor type alpha (LXR-α) and glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) and the FA profiles in VAT were determined. Additionally, the in vivo and in vitro agonist effects of oleic  (OA), linoleic  (LA), and  (AA) by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor type gamma 2 (PPAR-γ2) on the activity of GLUT4 were studied.Our results showed a dysregulation of GLUT4 and LXR-α in VAT of morbidly obese subjects. In addition, a specific FA profile for morbidly obese individuals was found. Finally, AA was an PPAR-γ2 agonist that activates the expression of GLUT4.Our study suggests a dysregulation of LXR-α and GLUT4 expression in VAT of morbidly obese individuals. FA profiles in VAT could elucidate their possible role in lipolysis and adipogenesis. Finally, AA binds to PPAR-γ2 to activate the expression of GLUT4 in the HepG2 cell line, showing an alternative insulin-independent activation of GLUT4.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30403782>Fat-1 Transgene Is Associated With Improved Reproductive Outcomes.</a></h2><p>High intake of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) has been associated with a variety of health benefits. However, the role of ω-3 PUFAs in female reproductive function is unclear, with studies showing both positive and negative effects. The type of diet that ω-3 fatty acids are consumed with, for example, a balanced diet vs a high-fat diet (HFD), may influence how ω-3 fatty acids affect female reproductive function. To address the role of ω-3 PUFAs in female reproduction, we used the fat-1 mouse both with and without HFD exposure. Fat-1 mice constitutively express the fat-1 transgene, allowing the conversion of ω-6 to ω-3 fatty acids to yield an optimal tissue ratio of ω-6 to ω-3 fatty acids (∼1:1). In our study, at 15 weeks of age, fat-1 mice had elevated primordial follicles compared with wild-type controls with both standard chow and HFD feeding. Higher serum levels of the ω-3 docosahexaenoic  (DHA), docosapentaenoic  (DPA), and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) were positively associated with primordial follicle numbers, whereas the ratio of the ω-6  to EPA + DPA + DHA had the opposite effect. Furthermore, fat-1 mice had increased pregnancy rates and shorter time to pregnancy when fed an HFD compared with wild-type mice. In conclusion, our novel preclinical model suggests that high tissue levels of long-chain ω-3 PUFAs are associated with an improved ovarian reserve and improved reproductive outcomes. Further studies are needed to evaluate ω-3 PUFAs as a potential intervention strategy in women with diminished ovarian reserve.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29309791>Amelioration of streptozotocin-induced type 2  in Wistar rats by .</a></h2><p>Traditionally  (AA, 20:4 n-6) is considered as a pro-inflammatory molecule since it forms precursor to prostaglandins (PGs), leukotrienes (LTs) and thromboxanes (TXs) that have pro-inflammatory actions. Type 2  (type 2 DM) is considered as a low-grade systemic inflammatory condition in which circulating PGs and LTs are increased. Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 2 DM is used as a model of human type 2 DM in which peripheral insulin resistance, increased plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and hyperglycemia occurs. In the present study, we observed that oral supplementation of AA prevented STZ-induced type 2 DM in Wistar rats by restoring hyperglycemia, plasma levels of TNF-α and IL-6; adipose tissue NF-kB and lipocalin 2 (LPCLN2) and pancreatic tissue NF-kB and 5- and 12- lipoxygenase enzymes to normal. AA treatment enhanced insulin sensitivity and plasma lipoxin A4 (LXA4) levels, a potent anti-inflammatory molecule derived from AA. These results are supported by our previous studies wherein it was noted that plasma phospholipid content of AA and circulating LXA4 levels are low in those with type 2 DM. In a preliminary study, we also noted that high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced type 2 DM in Wistar rats can be prevented by oral supplementation of AA. These results suggest AA has anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic actions by enhancing the production of its anti-inflammatory metabolite LXA4.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we investigated the effects of human dental pulp stem cell (DPSC) transplantation in Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced neuropathic rats. Six weeks after STZ injection, DPSCs were transplanted through two routes, intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM), in single or two repeat doses. Two weeks after transplantation, a significant improvement in hyperalgesia, grip-strength, motor coordination and nerve conduction velocity was observed in comparison with controls. A rapid improvement in neuropathic symptoms was observed for a single dose of DPSC IV; however, repeat dose of DPSC IV did not bring about added improvement. A single dose of DPSC IM showed steady improvement, and further recovery continued upon repeat IM administration. DPSC single dose IV showed greater improvement than DPSC single dose IM, but IM transplantation brought about better improvement in body weight. A marked reduction in tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels was observed in the blood plasma for all treated groups, as compared with controls. With respect to inflammatory cytokines, repeat dose of DPSC IM showed further improvement, suggesting that a repeat dose is required to maintain the improved inflammatory state. Gene expression of inflammatory markers in liver confirmed amelioration in inflammation.  level was unaffected by IV DPSC transplantation but showed noticeable increase through IM administration of a repeat dose. These results suggest that DPSC transplantation through both routes and dosage was beneficial for the retrieval of neuropathic parameters of DN; transplantation via the IM route with repeat dose was the most effective.Copyright © 2017 International Society for Cellular Therapy.

PGs signal through G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and are important modulators of an array of physiological functions, including systemic inflammation and insulin secretion from pancreatic islets. The role of PGs in β-cell function has been an active area of interest, beginning in the 1970s. Early studies demonstrated that PGE inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), although more recent studies have questioned this inhibitory action of PGE. The PGE receptor EP3 and one of the G-proteins that couples to EP3, Gα, have been identified as negative regulators of β-cell proliferation and survival. Conversely, PGI and its receptor, IP, play a positive role in the β-cell by enhancing GSIS and preserving β-cell mass in response to the β-cell toxin streptozotocin (STZ). In comparison to PGE and PGI, little is known about the function of the remaining PGs within islets. In this review, we discuss the roles of PGs, particularly PGE and PGI, PG receptors, and downstream signaling events that alter β-cell function and regulation of β-cell mass.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31292513>Fatty  desaturase 2 is up-regulated by the treatment with statin through geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate-dependent Rho kinase pathway in HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>Statins have been reported to increase the plasma concentration of  (AA), an omega-6 long chain polyunsaturated fatty  (LCPUFA) in several clinical studies indicating that statins affect the endogenous synthesis of LCUFAs. In the present study, we investigated the roles of the intrinsic mevalonate cascade and Rho-dependent pathway in LCPUFA synthesis, especially focusing on fatty  desaturases (Fads) 2, using the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2. Cell number and the activity of caspase-3 and 7 (caspase-3/7) was measured using a commercial kit. Gene expression was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Protein expression was detected by Western blot analysis. Atorvastatin decreased cell viability and increased caspase-3/7 activity in a dose-dependent manner. At lower concentrations, atorvastatin stimulated both mRNA and protein expression of Fads2, and increased mRNA expression of FADS1 and ELVOL5. Both mevalonate and geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate (GGPP), but not cholesterol, fully reversed atorvastatin-induced upregulation of Fads2, and mevalonate-effected reversal was inhibited by treatment with the Rho-associated protein kinase inhibitor Y-27632. These data clearly demonstrated that in human HepG2 cells, statins affect the endogenous synthesis of LCPUFAs by regulation of not only Fads2, but also Fads1 and Elovl5, through the GGPP-dependent Rho kinase pathway.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554135>Hepatic transcriptome and proteome analyses provide new insights into the regulator mechanism of dietary avicularin in diabetic mice.</a></h2><p>Many dietary flavonoids existing as glycosides in fruits and vegetables are considered bioactive food components with various potential health benefits. Type 2  (T2DM) is a complex and polygenic disease with increasing global prevalence and economic burden. In this study, the hypoglycemic effect of avicularin (quercetin-3-O-α-arabinofuranoside), a flavonoid glycoside commonly found in natural plants and fruits, was determined in a high fat diet/streptozotocin induced type 2  mouse model. Our results demonstrated that dietary avicularin treatment reduced levels of fasting blood glucose, serum TG and LDL-C, liver AST and ALT, and increased hepatic glycogen in T2DM mice. Furthermore, we used RNA-Seq and iTRAQ to compare the gene and protein expression in the livers of the normal control mice (NC), diabetic control mice (DC) and avicularin treated mice (DA100). The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were analyzed based on gene annotations and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment. Integrated analysis of the RNA-Seq and iTRAQ data indicated that the fifteen DEGs/DEPs showed the same trend in mRNA and protein expression levels in comparisons of both NC vs DC and DC vs DA100. KEGG analysis revealed that four DEGs/DEPs (PKM, PEPCK, PYG, and PLA2) in the glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and  pathway, and six DEPs (Ndufb4, Ndufa6, Cox5a, Cox5b, Cox6c, and ATPSβ) in the oxidative phosphorylation signaling pathway, play important roles in avicularin's hypoglycemic effect.

However, the specific defects that precipitate these abnormalities are yet to be fully elucidated. After binding to insulin, the plasma membrane-embedded insulin receptor transmembrane protein initiates a cascade of phosphorylation that leads to the activation of protein kinase B (AKT) and subsequently to the initiation of some metabolic actions of insulin. The activities of this receptor, insulin binding, and tyrosine kinase activation is dependent on its plasma lipid environment. Published data on the influence of omega-3 and -6 polyunsaturated fatty acids on insulin response are scarce. Moreover, the findings of the published investigations, most of which used omega-3 and -6, polyunsaturated fatty- blends, have been inconclusive. Hence, further, well thought out research is needed. The aim of the current study was to elucidate the effect of treatments with linoleic  (LNA),  (ARA), alpha-linolenic  (ALA), docoshexaenoic  (DHA), and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) on cell membrane composition and consequently on the insulin-signaling pathway and specifically AKT phosphorylation.Human colon adenocarcinoma (HT29) and liver hepatocellular (HepG2) cells were treated with or without 40 µM of LNA, ARA, ALA, EPA, or DHA for 48 h, the fatty- composition of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) from the treated cells by capillary gas liquid chromatograph. Cells were incubated for 30 min with or without human insulin (50 ng/mL), and the phosphorylation of AKT was assessed with the use of Western blotting.The fatty acids were incorporated in the PtdCho and PtdEtn of both cell lines, but the level of incorporation was higher in HT29. Phosphorylation of AKT increased when HT29 was treated with LNA (P < 0.05) and ARA (P < 0.01) but not with ALA, EPA, or DHA. A similar but non-significant increase in AKT phosphorylation was observed in LNA- and ARA- treated HepG2 cells.The finding of this investigation demonstrates that plasma membrane lipid bilayer enrichment with LNA or ARA treatment enhances insulin action by AKT activation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated whether platelet inhibition by simvastatin correlates with the statin effects on lipid lowering, inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial and platelet activation.In hypercholesterolemic patients allocated to diet (n=20) or a 2-month treatment with diet plus 40 mg simvastatin (n=25), we evaluated platelet aggregating responses to ADP, collagen, and  (AA), the effect of aspirin on AA-induced aggregation, pro- and anti-inflammatory and atherogenic mediators (IL-1, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9, -10, -12, and -13, IFN-, IP-10, Eotaxin, and sRAGE), markers of endothelium (sE-selectin, VEGF, and MCP-1) and platelet activation (sP-selectin, sCD-40L, RANTES, and PDGF-bb), and oxidative stress (8-OH-2'-deoxyguanosine).After treatment, beside the improvement of lipid profile, we observed the following: a reduction of platelet aggregation to ADP (p=0.0001), collagen (p=0.0001), AA (p=0.003); an increased antiaggregating effect of aspirin in the presence of AA (p=0.0001); a reduction of circulating levels of IL-6 (p=0.0034), IL-13 (p<0.0001), IFN- (p<0.0001), VEGF (p<0.0001), sE-selectin (p<0.0001), sCD-40L (p<0.0001), sP-selectin (p=0.003), and 8-OH-2'-deoxyguanosine (p<0.0001); an increase of IL-10 and sRAGEs (p=0.0001 for both). LDL-cholesterol levels (i) positively correlated with IL-6, IFN-, E-selectin, sCD-40L, 8-OH-2'-deoxyguanosine, platelet aggregation to ADP, collagen, AA, and aspirin IC-50 and (ii) negatively correlated with IL-10 and sRAGE. In multiple regression analyses, LDL-cholesterol was the strongest predictor for most parameters of platelet reactivity.In primary hypercholesterolemia, simvastatin treatment reduced platelet activation and subclinical inflammation and improved endothelial dysfunction.

We characterized the changes in lipids upon pravastatin treatment and defined the relationship with risk reduction for future cardiovascular events.METHODSPlasma lipids (n = 342) were measured in baseline and 1-year follow-up samples from a Long-Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease (LIPID) study subcohort (n = 4991). The associations of changes in lipids with treatment and cardiovascular outcomes were investigated using linear and Cox regression. The effect of treatment on future cardiovascular outcomes was examined by the relative risk reduction (RRR).RESULTSPravastatin treatment was associated with changes in 206 lipids. Species containing  were positively associated while phosphatidylinositol species were negatively associated with pravastatin treatment. The RRR from pravastatin treatment for cardiovascular events decreased from 23.5% to 16.6% after adjustment for clinical risk factors and change in LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and to 3.0% after further adjustment for the change in the lipid ratio PI(36:2)/PC(38:4). Change in PI(36:2)/PC(38:4) mediated 58% of the treatment effect. Stratification of patients into quartiles of change in PI(36:2)/PC(38:4) indicated no benefit of pravastatin in the fourth quartile.CONCLUSIONThe change in PI(36:2)/PC(38:4) predicted benefit from pravastatin, independent of change in LDL-C, demonstrating its potential as a biomarker for monitoring the clinical benefit of statin treatment in secondary prevention.TRIAL REGISTRATIONAustralian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry identifier ACTRN12616000535471.FUNDINGBristol-Myers Squibb; NHMRC grants 211086, 358395, and 1029754; NHMRC program grant 1149987; NHMRC fellowship 108026; and the Operational Infrastructure Support Program of the Victorian government of Australia.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28319086>Cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenases as potential targets in the management of impaired diabetic wound healing.</a></h2><p>Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are the epoxidation products of  catalyzed by cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenases, which possess multiple biological activities.

The physiopathology explaining this association remains complex. Thus, research for new therapies to prevent cardiovascular events in chronic kidney disease is a major issue. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, products of the  metabolism, are endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors with vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory, thrombolytic, pro-angiogenic and anti-apoptotic properties.

Moreover, human studies of genetic polymorphisms of soluble epoxide hydrolase, the enzyme degrading epoxyeicoatrienoic acids, have shown that allelic variants related to an increase in its activity is associated with higher risk of cardiovascular events. Modulation of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids by soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors in some cardiovascular diseases induces structural improvements in the heart, vessels and kidneys, including decrease in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, reduction in cardiac and renal interstitial fibrosis, improvement in renal hemodynamics, and prevention of endothelial dysfunction.

Furthermore, polyphenols exhibit anti-inflammatory activity on many levels via NF-κB inhibition, and MAPK, iNOS, and growth factors regulation. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge concerning the potential of various dietary polyphenols to inhibit the effects of COX-2 in colon cancer, by examining the available evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of these compounds obtained from in vitro and animal studies.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27876761>Early infant adipose deposition is positively associated with the n-6 to n-3 fatty  ratio in human milk independent of maternal BMI.</a></h2><p>Excessive infant weight gain in the first 6-month of life is a powerful predictor of childhood obesity and related health risks. In mice, omega-6 fatty acids (FAs) serve as potent ligands driving adipogenesis during early development. The ratio of omega-6 relative to omega-3 (n-6/n-3) FA in human milk (HM) has increased threefold over the last 30 years, but the impact of this shift on infant adipose development remains undetermined. This study investigated how maternal obesity and maternal dietary FA (as reflected in maternal red blood cells (RBCs) composition) influenced HM n-6 and n-3 FAs, and whether the HM n-6/n-3 ratio was associated with changes in infant adipose deposition between 2 weeks and 4 months postpartum.Forty-eight infants from normal weight (NW), overweight (OW) and obese (OB) mothers were exclusively or predominantly breastfed over the first 4 months of lactation. Mid-feed HM and maternal RBC were collected at either transitional (2 weeks) or established (4 months) lactation, along with infant body composition assessed using air-displacement plethysmography. The FA composition of HM and maternal RBC was measured quantitatively by lipid mass spectrometry.In transitional and established HM, docosahexaenoic  (DHA) was lower (P=0.008; 0.005) and the  (AA)/DHA+eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) ratio was higher (P=0.05; 0.02) in the OB relative to the NW group. Maternal prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and AA/DHA+EPA ratios in transitional and established HM were moderately correlated (P=0.018; 0.001). Total infant fat mass was increased in the upper AA/DHA+EPA tertile of established HM relative to the lower tertile (P=0.019). The amount of changes in infant fat mass and percentage of body fat were predicted by AA/EPA+DHA ratios in established HM (P=0.038; 0.010).Perinatal infant exposures to a high AA/EPA+DHA ratio during the first 4 months of life, which is primarily reflective of maternal dietary FA, may significantly contribute to the way infants accumulate adipose.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30704490>Eicosapentaenoic / ratio and weight loss during hospitalization for glycemic control among overweight Japanese patients with type 2 : a retrospective observational study.</a></h2><p>The study aimed to examine the relationship between levels of serum eicosapentaenoic  (EPA),  (AA), as well as EPA/AA ratio and weight loss during hospitalization in participants considered to be overweight, with type 2 .The study participants included 142 patients who were hospitalized for treatment of type 2 .

Moreover, we assessed serum fatty acids of the phospholipid fraction by gas chromatography both at baseline and at the end of the study.Majority of patients were treated with optimal medical therapy and achieved recommended treatment targets. Despite higher serum levels of eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) (by 204%; p < 0.001) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) (by 62%; p < 0.0001) in n-3 PUFA group at the end of treatment no changes in platelet aggregation, thrombin generation, fibrin clot properties or markers of systemic inflammation were observed. No intergroup differences in the insulin, HbA1c and lipid levels were found at the end of the study. There was no change in adiponectin and leptin in interventional group, however leptin increased in control group (p = 0.01), therefore after study period leptin levels were lower in the interventional group (p = 0.01).

More selective drugs are available today, but this therapeutic concept has not changed. Because the acute inflammatory response is host protective to contain foreign invaders, much of today's pharmacopeia can cause serious unwanted side effects, such as immune suppression. Uncontrolled inflammation is now considered pathophysiologic and is associated with many widely occurring diseases such as cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases, , obesity, and asthma, as well as classic inflammatory diseases (, arthritis and periodontal diseases). The inflammatory response, when self-limited, produces a superfamily of chemical mediators that stimulate resolution of the response. Specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs), identified in recent years, are endogenous mediators that include the n-3-derived families resolvins, protectins, and maresins, as well as -derived (n-6) lipoxins, which promote resolution of inflammation, clearance of microbes, reduction of pain, and promotion of tissue regeneration  novel mechanisms. Aspirin and statins have a positive impact on these resolution pathways, producing epimeric forms of specific SPMs, whereas other drugs can disrupt timely resolution. In this article, evidence from recent human and preclinical animal studies is reviewed, indicating that SPMs are physiologic mediators and pharmacologic agonists that stimulate resolution of inflammation and infection. The findings suggest that it is time to challenge current treatment practices-namely, using inhibitors and antagonists alone-and to develop immunoresolvents as agonists to test resolution pharmacology and their role in catabasis for their therapeutic potential.-Serhan, C.

The aim of present study was to evaluate the associations of clopidogrel resistance (CR) with END, and stratified analyze the effectiveness of clopidogrel alone and clopidogrel plus aspirin for the prevention of END.A total of 375 patients, 144 patients were received clopidogrel alone, 231 patients took clopidogrel plus aspirin. CR occurred in 153 patients (40.8%). 95 (25.3%) patients developed END within the first 10 days. Platelet aggregation was higher on admission, and inhibition of platelet aggregation was significantly lower in patients with END than patients without END. , CR, and clopidogrel plus aspirin were independently associated with END. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel can inhibit both  (AA)-induced and ADP-induced platelet aggregation.This was a prospective, two-center study. A total of 375 IS patients taking clopidogrel alone or clopidogrel plus aspirin were enrolled. Platelet aggregation was measured before and after the 7-10 day treatment. CR was assessed by adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation. The primary endpoint was END within the 10 days after admission. The secondary endpoint was a composite of recurrent ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and death during the 10 days after admission.CR and END are fairly common after acute IS. CR is associated with higher risk of END.

Prasugrel and ticagrelor reduce thrombotic complications to a greater extent than clopidogrel. Subgroup analyses of pivotal clinical trials testing prasugrel and ticagrelor versus clopidogrel showed DM patients to have benefits that were consistent with the overall trial populations, although the magnitude of the ischemic risk reduction appeared to be enhanced with prasugrel. Whether these findings may be attributed to differences in the pharmacodynamic profiles of these drugs in DM patients remains poorly explored and represented the aim of this study.In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, crossover pharmacodynamic study, aspirin-treated DM patients (n=50) with coronary artery disease were randomly assigned to receive prasugrel (60 mg loading dose [LD]/10 mg maintenance dose once daily) or ticagrelor (180 mg LD/90 mg maintenance dose twice daily) for 1 week. Pharmacodynamic assessments were conducted using 4 different assays, including VerifyNow P2Y12, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, light transmittance aggregometry, and Multiplate, which allowed us to explore ADP- and non-ADP-induced (-, collagen-, thrombin receptor-activating, peptide-induced) platelet signaling pathways. The acute (baseline, 30 minutes, and 2 hours post-LD) and maintenance (1 week) effects of therapy were assessed. The primary end point of the study was the comparison of P2Y12 reaction units determined by VerifyNow P2Y12 at 1 week between prasugrel and ticagrelor.ADP- and non-ADP-induced measures of platelet reactivity reduced significantly with both prasugrel and ticagrelor LD and maintenance dose. P2Y12 reaction units defined by VerifyNow were similar between prasugrel and ticagrelor at 30 minutes and 2 hours post-LD. At 1 week, P2Y12 reaction units were significantly lower with ticagrelor than with prasugrel (52 [32-72] versus 83 [63-103]; least-square means difference: -31; 95% confidence interval, -57 to -4; P=0.022; primary end point). Pharmacodynamic assessments measured by vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, light transmittance aggregometry, and Multiplate were similar between prasugrel and ticagrelor at each time point, including at 1 week. Rates of high on-treatment platelet reactivity were similar between groups with all assays at all time points.In DM patients with coronary artery disease, ticagrelor exerts similar or greater inhibition of ADP-induced platelet reactivity in comparison with prasugrel in the acute and chronic phases of treatment, whereas the inhibition of measures of non-ADP-induced platelet reactivity was not significantly different between the 2 agents.URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

However, impairment in systolic function, often reported as declining ejection fraction, may not consistently occur in a given time frame which could be contributable to a variety of factors within the experimental design. One major factor may be the amounts of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (FAs) that are present in the diet. To determine whether the FA content and composition were critical determinants in the development of cardiac dysfunction in response to high-fat feeding, we fed adult, male mice Western diet (45% fat, 60% saturated), Surwit diet (60% fat, 90% saturated), milk-fat-based diet (60% fat, 60% saturated) or high-fat Western diet (HFWD, 60% fat, 32% saturated) for 12 weeks. We report that neither the amount of total fat nor the ratio of saturated to unsaturated FAs in the diets differentially affects body weight and adiposity in mice. In addition, no evidence of systolic dysfunction is present after 12 weeks. Interestingly, the HFWD, with equal parts saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated FAs, induces mild cardiac hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction after 12 weeks, which coincides with elevated serum levels of . Our results suggest that the dietary FA content and composition may be a primary determinant of diastolic, but not systolic, dysfunction in animal models of diet-induced obesity.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, effects on the adult brain are not clear. Little is known about the impact of dietary intervention on the fatty  profile in adult brain, the modulation in the expression of enzymes involved in fatty  biosynthesis and metabolism as well as changes in resulting oxylipins. These questions were addressed in the present study in two independent n3-PUFA feeding experiments in mice. Supplementation of eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA, 1% each in the diet) for 30days to adult NMRI and C57BL/6 mice led to a distinct shift in the brain PUFA pattern. While n3-PUFAs EPA, n3 docosapentaenoic  and DHA were elevated, many n6-PUFAs were significantly decreased (except, e.g. C20:3 n6 which was increased). This shift in PUFAs was accompanied by immense differences in concentrations of oxidative metabolites derived from enzymatic conversion of PUFAs, esp.  whose products were uniformly decreased, and a modulation in the activity and expression pattern of delta-5 and delta-6 desaturases. In both mouse strains a remarkable increase in the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) activity (decreased epoxy-FA concentrations and epoxy-FA to dihydroxy-FA-ratios) as well as sEH expression was observed. Taking the high biological activity of epoxy-FA, e.g. on blood flow and nociceptive signaling into account, this finding might be of relevance for the effects of n3-PUFAs in neurodegenerative diseases.

A review.</a></h2><p>Ageing is inevitable. Recent studies suggest that it could be delayed. Low-grade systemic inflammation is seen in type 2 , hypertension and endothelial dysfunction that are common with increasing age. In all these conditions, an alteration in  (AA) metabolism is seen in the form of increased formation of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids and decreased production of anti-inflammatory lipoxins, resolvins, protectins and maresins and decreased activity of desaturases. Calorie restriction, exercise and parabiosis delay age-related changes that could be related to enhanced proliferation of stem cells, decrease in inflammation and transfer of GDF-11 (growth differentiation factor-11) and other related molecules from the young to the old, increase in the formation of lipoxin A4, resolvins, protectins and maresins, hydrogen sulfide (HS) and nitric oxide (NO); inhibition of ageing-related hypothalamic or brain IKK-β and NF-kB activation, decreased gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release resulting in increased neurogenesis and consequent decelerated ageing. This suggests that hypothalamus participates in ageing process. N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) and lipid-derived signalling molecules can be tuned favorably under dietary restriction to extend lifespan and/or prevent advanced age associated diseases in an mTOR dependent pathway manner. Sulfur amino  (SAA) restriction increased hydrogen sulfide (HS) production and protected tissues from hypoxia and tissue damage. Anti-inflammatory metabolites formed from AA such as LXA4, resolvins, protectins and maresins enhance production of NO, CO, HS; suppress NF-kB expression and alter mTOR expression and thus, may aid in delaying ageing process. Dietary restriction and exercise enhance AA metabolism to form LXA4, resolvins, protectins and maresins that have anti-inflammatory actions. AA and their metabolites also influence stem cell biology, enhance neurogenesis to improve memory and augment autophagy to prolong life span. Thus, AA and other PUFAs and their anti-inflammatory metabolites inhibit inflammation, augment stem cell proliferation, restore to normal lipid-derived signaling molecules and NO and HS production, enhance autophagy and prolong life span.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31595424>Untargeted metabolomics reveals alterations in metabolites of lipid metabolism and immune pathways in the serum of rats after long-term oral administration of Amalaki rasayana.</a></h2><p>Amalaki rasayana, a traditional preparation, is widely used by Ayurvedic physicians for the treatment of inflammatory conditions, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Metabolic alterations induced by Amalaki rasayana intervention are unknown. We investigated the modulations in serum metabolomic profiles in Wistar rats following long-term oral administration of Amalaki rasayana. Global metabolic profiling was performed of the serum of rats administered with either Amalaki rasayana (AR) or ghee + honey (GH) for 18 months and control animals which were left untreated. Amalaki rasayana components were confirmed from AR extract using HR-LCMS analysis. Significant reductions in prostaglandin J2, 11-dehydrothromboxane B2, and higher levels of reduced glutathione and glycitein metabolites were observed in the serum of AR administered rats compared to the control groups. Eleven different metabolites classified as phospholipids, glycerophospholipids, glucoside derivatives, organic acids, and glycosphingolipid were exclusively observed in the AR administered rats. Pathway analysis suggests that altered metabolites in AR administered rats are those associated with different biochemical pathways of  metabolism, fatty  metabolism, leukotriene metabolism, G-protein mediated events, phospholipid metabolism, and the immune system. Targeted metabolomics confirmed the presence of gallic , ellagic , and  components in the AR extract. The known activities of these components can be correlated with the altered metabolic profile following long-term AR administration.

We have shown that, despite similar incorporation, treatment of CC myotubes (CM) with EPA but not DHA improves glucose uptake and protein accretion. We hypothesized that these differential effects of EPA and DHA may be due to divergent shifts in lipidomic profiles leading to altered proteomic profiles. We therefore carried out an assessment of the impact of treating CM with EPA and DHA on lipidomic and proteomic profiles. Fatty  methyl esters (FAME) analysis revealed that both EPA and DHA led to similar but substantials changes in fatty  profiles with the exception of , which was decreased only by DHA, and docosapentanoic  (DPA), which was increased only by EPA treatment. Global lipidomic analysis showed that EPA and DHA induced large alterations in the cellular lipid profiles and in particular, the phospholipid classes. Subsequent targeted analysis confirmed that the most differentially regulated species were phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines containing long-chain fatty acids with five (EPA treatment) or six (DHA treatment) double bonds. As these are typically membrane-associated lipid species we hypothesized that these treatments differentially altered the membrane-associated proteome. Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based proteomics of the membrane fraction revealed significant divergence in the effects of EPA and DHA on the membrane-associated proteome.

Glucose-induced insulin secretion is accompanied by the release of free  (AA) mainly by cytosolic- and calcium independent phospholipases A2 (cPLA2 and iPLA2). Insulinoma cell line (INS-1E) was infected with E. coli isolated from the blood culture of a patient with sepsis. Invasion assay, Scanning Electron Microscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy demonstrated the capacity of E. coli to enter cells, which was reduced by PLA2 inhibitors. Glucose-induced insulin secretion was significantly increased after acute infection (8h) but significantly decreased after chronic infection (72h). PLA2 activities, cPLA2, iPLA2, phospho-cPLA2, and COX-2 expressions were increased after acute and, even more, after chronic E. coli infection. The silencing of the two isoforms of PLA2s, with specific cPLA2- or iPLA2-siRNAs, reduced insulin secretion after acute infection and determined a rise in insulin release after chronic infection. Prostaglandins E2 (PGE2) production was significantly elevated in INS-1E after long-term E. coli infection and the restored insulin secretion in presence of L798106, a specific EP3 antagonist, and NS-398, a COX-2 inhibitor, and the reduction of insulin secretion in presence of sulprostone, a specific EP3 agonist, revealed their involvement in the effects triggered by bacterial infection. The results obtained demonstrated that cPLA2 and iPLA2 play a key role in insulin secretion process after E. coli infection.

Systemic atherosclerosis increases the risk of VCID by inducing cerebral infarction, or through systemic or local inflammatory factors that underlie both atherosclerosis and cognition. Omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are involved in inflammatory processes, but with opposite roles. Specifically, omega-3 PUFAs exert anti-inflammatory properties by competing with omega-6 PUFAs and displacing  in membrane phospholipids, decreasing the production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. Experimental studies and some clinical trials have demonstrated that omega-3 PUFA supplementation may reduce the risk of different phenotypes of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.

However,  did not affect MMP-9 and TIMP-4.Aspirin-HPR did not affect the translocation and release of MMPs and TIMP-4 from platelets. TIMP-4 may serve as a marker of TXA2-mediated platelet aggregation. Chronically elevated plasma glucose increases plasma MMP-2, and HPR potentiates this phenomenon.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30012669>The Cytochrome P450 Slow Metabolizers CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 Directly Regulate Tumorigenesis via Reduced Epoxyeicosatrienoic  Production.</a></h2><p>Increased expression of cytochrome P450 CYP2C9, together with elevated levels of its products epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EET), is associated with aggressiveness in cancer. Cytochrome P450 variants  and  encode proteins with reduced enzymatic activity, and individuals carrying these variants metabolize drugs more slowly than individuals with wild-type , potentially affecting their response to drugs and altering their risk of disease. Although genetic differences in CYP2C9-dependent oxidation of  (AA) have been reported, the roles of CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 in EET biosynthesis and their relevance to disease are unknown. Here, we report that CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 metabolize AA less efficiently than CYP2C9*1 and that they play a role in the progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) via impaired EET biosynthesis. When injected into mice, NSCLC cells expressing CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 produced lower levels of EETs and developed fewer, smaller, and less vascularized tumors than cells expressing CYP2C9*1. Moreover, endothelial cells expressing these two variants proliferated and migrated less than cells expressing CYP2C*1. Purified CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 exhibited attenuated catalytic efficiency in producing EETs, primarily due to impaired reduction of these two variants by NADPH-P450 reductase. Loss-of-function SNPs within  and  were associated with improved survival in female cases of NSCLC. Thus, decreased EET biosynthesis represents a novel mechanism whereby CYPC29*2 and CYP2C9*3 exert a direct protective role in NSCLC development. These findings report single nucleotide polymorphisms in the human CYP2C9 genes,  and , exert a direct protective role in tumorigenesis by impairing EET biosynthesis. .©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28012379>The LC-MS-based metabolomics of hydroxytyrosol administration in rats reveals amelioration of the metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p>Hydroxytyrosol (HT), an important component of olive fruit and olive oil, improves the signs of metabolic syndrome in rats following chronic treatment. At a dose of 20mg/kg/day, HT decreased adiposity and improved cardiovascular and liver structure and function in rats fed with a high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet. An untargeted metabolomics approach has been employed using both UPLC-Orbitrap and -QqTOF methods to identify the changes induced by chronic HT administration on the plasma metabolome. 31 metabolites have been found to be differentially expressed between the examined groups. HT was shown to decrease biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, fatty  biosynthesis, and the metabolism of linoleic , retinol, sphingolipids and , whereas glycerolipid metabolism is up-regulated. These are plausible mechanisms for the attenuation by HT of cardiovascular, liver and metabolic changes in high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet fed rats.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Among them, cadmium (Cd) acts as a risk factor inducing the occurrence of DN. The present study focused on investigating the protective role of caffeic  phenethyl ester (CAPE), an active component of propolis from honeybee hives, against Cd-induced DN in mice based on ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS)and pattern recognition. Serum and urine biochemical indexes were detected and histopathological observation has been done to evaluate the damage of Cd on animals. Moreover, the global serum profiles of different groups were distinguished by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS and principal component analysis (PCA) were applied for group differentiation and marker selection. Moreover, the influence of Cd on the oxidative status in DN mice were also evaluated by assessing the parameters of oxidative stress, proinflammatory cytokines and antioxidant competence. As shown in the scores plots, the distinct clustering among controls, DN and CAPE groups were observed, significant changes in serum levels of LysoPC(18:1(11Z)), 2,3-dinor-8-iso-PGF2a, PS(18:1(9Z)/18:1(9Z)), DG(17:0/22:4 (7Z,10Z, 13Z, 16Z)/0:0) and (AA) were noted and identified as potential biomarkers, the effect of CAPE reverted them back to near normalcy. Further, It was observed a significant improvement in lipid peroxides (LPO) and protein carbonyls (PCO) levels in Cd-induced DN kidneys along with a significant decline in superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels, however, CAPE relieved these changes. In conclusion, the study suggested that the pathogenesis of DN caused by Cd probably owes to the perturbations of lipid metabolism and AA metabolism; CAPE seems to be effective agent and may be related to its potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory properties and action as an Nrf2 activator.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

But the exact mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenase-derived metabolites of , protecting against  and DN. Herein, we hypothesized that activation of VDR attenuated high glucose-induced cellular injury in renal tubular epithelial cells partially through up-regulating CYP2J5 expression.Streptozotocin (STZ) was injected to induce diabetic in wild type and Vdr mice. The effects of VDR knockout and an activator of VDR, paricalcitol, on the renal injury were detected. In vitro, a murine kidney proximal tubule epithelial cell line BU.MPT induced by high glucose were treated with or without paricalcitol (30 mM) for 12 h or 24 h.The expression of CYP2J5 was significantly decreased both in wild type and Vdr diabetic mice induced by STZ. The STZ-induced kidney architecture damage and apoptosis rate in Vdr mice were more severe. In vitro, high glucose treatment strongly reduced the CYP2J5 expression and the synthesis of 14,15-EET in BU.MPT cells. Supplement of 14,15-EET significantly reduced the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release induced by high glucose in BU.MPT cells. Furthermore, treatment with paricalcitol attenuated cellular injury and restored the expression of CYP2J5 reduced by high glucose in BU.MPT cells.We conclude that activation of VDR attenuates high glucose-induced cellular injury partially dependent on CYP2J5 in murine renal tubule epithelial cells and paricalcitol may represent a potential therapy for DN.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The study included 185 patients with CHD, including 58 diabetics, aged 62.3 ± 8.2 years. Patients were treated long-term with ASA, plus clopidogrel, both 75 mg/d. Platelet aggregation was measured with  (ASPI test; ASA-response assessment) or ADP (ADP test; clopidogrel-response assessment). Thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and fibrinogen concentrations were measured and ITGB3 PIA1>A2 variants identified. Increases in PLT, glucose and SBP were demonstrated with dual resistance or to clopidogrel. Regardless of response, diabetics (versus non-diabetics) had elevated platelet aggregation with the ADP test (P = 0.0198), higher TXB2 (P = 0.0501), BMI (P = 0.0003) and SBP (P = 0.0627). ITGB3 PIA1/A1 homozygotes had higher platelet aggregation with the ASPI test (P = 0.0513), and fibrinogen concentrations (P = 0.0133), relative to A2 allele carriers. Significant associations of  with clopidogrel resistance (P = 0.0011) and PIA1/A1 homozygotes with ASA resistance (P = 0.0518) were found. Higher concentrations of TXB2 (P = 0.0223) and higher SBP (P = 0.0063) were found with  (versus non-diabetic) in PIA1/A1 homozygotes. We concluded that  with CHD weakens response to antiplatelet drugs, especially to clopidogrel; and hyperglycaemia, hypertension and obesity might also play an important role. Diabetics' resistance to ASA is associated with increased platelet reactivity, perhaps related to the more frequent ITGB3 PIA1 allele and increased TXB2 generation.

In this study we established the "Focus" mode of biomarkers to characterize the dose-effect relationship of Gegen Qinlian Decoction (GQD), a TCM formula for treating type 2  (2-DM). A rat model of 2-DM was established through high fat diet feeding combined with low-dose STZ injection. Rats with 2-DM were administered high, middle or low doses (6.785, 4.071, 1.357 mg·kg·d, respectively) of GQD extract for 60 d. Metformin (300 mg·kg·d) was taken as the positive control. Blood samples were collected to assess serum biochemical indexes and metabolic profiling. After "Focus" analysis, the biochemical index triglycerides (TG) and insulin sensitivity (ISI) were identified as focused integrated biomarkers (FIBs), while  and docosatetraenoic  were the metabolic FIBs. Dose-effect relationship curves of GQD were built based on these types of FIBs. Furthermore, the two dose-effect relationship curves showed similar trends with the middle dosage displaying the greatest efficacy, suggesting that insulin function and  metabolism played important roles in 2-DM and the responses to GQD. The metabolic FIB docosatetraenoic should be further explored for understanding its involvement in the process of 2-DM occurrence and the treatment.

CYP3A4 was unexpectedly associated with breast cancer mitochondria and synthesized  (AA)-derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which promoted the electron transport chain/respiration and inhibited AMPKα. CYP3A4 knockdown activated AMPKα, promoted autophagy, and prevented mammary tumor formation. The  drug metformin inhibited CYP3A4-mediated EET biosynthesis and depleted cancer cell-intrinsic EETs. Metformin bound to the active-site heme of CYP3A4 in a co-crystal structure, establishing CYP3A4 as a biguanide target. Structure-based design led to discovery of N1-hexyl-N5-benzyl-biguanide (HBB), which bound to the CYP3A4 heme with higher affinity than metformin. HBB potently and specifically inhibited CYP3A4 AA epoxygenase activity. HBB also inhibited growth of established ER mammary tumors and suppressed intratumoral mTOR. CYP3A4 AA epoxygenase inhibition by biguanides thus demonstrates convergence between eicosanoid activity in mitochondria and biguanide action in cancer, opening a new avenue for cancer drug discovery.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study aimed to identify key genes and pathways associated with EAC using bioinformatics analysis. The gene expression profiles of GSE92396, which includes 12 EAC samples and 9 normal esophageal samples, were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the EAC and normal samples were identified using the limma package in R language. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses of the identified DEGs were conducted using the online analysis tool, the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the DEGs was constructed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) database and Cytoscape software. Finally, module analysis was conducted for the PPI network using the MCODE plug-in in Cytoscape. Of the 386 DEGs identified, the 150 upregulated genes were mainly enriched in the KEGG pathways of complement and coagulation cascades, maturity onset  of the young and protein digestion and absorption; and the 236 downregulated genes were mainly enriched in amoebiasis, retinol metabolism and drug metabolism-cytochrome P450. Based on information from the STRING database, a PPI network comprising of 369 nodes and 534 edges was constructed in Cytoscape. The top 10 hub nodes with the highest degrees were determined as interleukin-8, involucrin, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1, fibronectin 1, serpin family E member 1, serpin family A member 1, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, secreted phosphoprotein 1, collagen type I alpha 1 chain and angiotensinogen. A total of 6 modules were detected from the PPI network that satisfied the criteria of MCODE score >4 and number of nodes >4. KEGG pathways enriched for the module DEGs were mainly within  metabolism, complement and coagulation cascades and rheumatoid arthritis. In conclusion, identification of these key genes and pathways may improve understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of EAC, and may be used as diagnostic and therapeutic targets in EAC.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27769511>Antiplatelet Effect Durability of a Novel, 24-Hour, Extended-Release Prescription Formulation of Acetylsalicylic  in Patients With Type 2 .</a></h2><p>High platelet reactivity and high platelet turnover have been implicated in incomplete platelet inhibition during immediate-release acetylsalicylic  therapy in patients with type 2  (DM). An extended-release acetylsalicylic  (ER-ASA; Durlaza) formulation was developed to provide 24-hour antithrombotic effects with once-daily dosing. The objective of the study was to evaluate the antiplatelet effects of ER-ASA in patients with DM. In this open-label, single-center study, patients with DM (n = 40) and multiple cardiovascular risk factors received ER-ASA 162.5 mg/day for 14 ± 4 days. Multiple platelet function tests, serum and urinary thromboxane B metabolites, prostacyclin metabolite, and high-sensitive C-reactive protein levels were assessed at 1, 12, 16, and 24 hours post-dose. Patients with high platelet turnover and/or high platelet reactivity were treated with ER-ASA 325 mg/day for 14 ± 4 days, and laboratory analyses were repeated. All patients responded to ER-ASA 162.5 mg/day as measured by -induced aggregation, and there was no loss of the platelet inhibitory effect of ER-ASA 162.5 mg/day over 24 hours post-dose (p = not significant). The antiplatelet effect was sustained over 24 hours for all platelet function measurements. Mean 1- to 24-hour serum thromboxane B levels were low with both doses and were lower with ER-ASA 325 mg/day compared with 162.5 mg/day therapy (p = 0.002). In conclusion, ER-ASA 162.5 mg daily dose provided sustained antiplatelet effects over 24 hours in patients with type 2 DM and multiple cardiovascular risk factors and had a favorable tolerability profile.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

These changes may decrease the systemic availability of bioactive PUFAs after RYGB. To study the impact of RYGB on the dietary ingestion and plasma concentration of PUFAs and on the intestinal expression of genes involved in their endogenous biosynthesis in severely obese women with type 2 .Before, and 3 and 12 months after RYGB, obese women (n = 20) self-reported a seven-day dietary record, answered a food frequency query and provided plasma samples for alpha-linolenic (ALA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA), docosahexaenoic (DHA) and  (ARA)  assessment by gas chromatography. Intestinal biopsies (duodenum, jejunum and ileum) were collected through double-balloon endoscopy before and 3 months after RYGB for gene expression analysis by microarray (Human GeneChip 1.0 ST array) and RT-qPCR validation.Compared to the preoperative period, patients had decreased intakes of PUFAs, fish and soybean oil (p < 0.05) and lower plasma concentrations of ALA and EPA (p < 0.001) 3 and 12 months after RYGB. FADS1 gene expression was lower in duodenum (RT-qPCR fold change = -1.620, p < 0.05) and jejunum (RT-qPCR fold change = -1.549, p < 0.05) 3 months following RYGB, compared to before surgery.RYGB decreased PUFA ingestion, plasma ALA and EPA levels, and intestinal expression of FADS1 gene. The latter encodes a key enzyme involved in endogenous biosynthesis of PUFAs. These data suggest that supplementation of omega-3 PUFAs may be required for obese patients undergoing RYGB.

Low omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) have been implicated as risk factors for cardiovascular outcomes in AMI patients, but it is not clear whether young women have similar or different post-AMI omega-3 FA profiles compared with young men.We assessed the sex differences in post-AMI omega-3 FAs and the associations of these biomarkers with patient-reported outcomes (symptom, functioning status, and quality of life) at 12-month follow-up, using data from 2985 US adults with AMI aged 18 to 55 years enrolled in the VIRGO (Variation in Recovery: Role of Gender on Outcomes of Young Acute Myocardial Infarction Patients) study. Biomarkers including eicosapentaenoic , docosahexaenoic ,  (AA), eicosapentaenoic /AA ratio, omega-3/omega-6 ratio, and omega-3 index were measured 1 month after AMI. Overall, the omega-3 FAs and AA were similar in young men and women with AMI. In both unadjusted and adjusted analysis (controlling for age, sex, race, smoking, hypertension, , body mass index, and health status score at 1 month), omega-3 FAs and AA were not significantly associated with 12-month health status scores using the Bonferroni corrected statistical threshold.We found no evidence of sex differences in omega-3 FAs and AA in young men and women 1 month after AMI.

NAFLD is the most common cause of liver disease in the United States, affecting up to a third of the general population. It is commonly associated with features of metabolic syndrome, particularly insulin resistance. NAFLD shares the basic pathogenic mechanisms with obesity and insulin resistance, such as mitochondrial, oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress.

They mediate significant effects in the fine-tune adjustment of body homeostasis. Phyto- and synthetic cannabinoids also rule the daily life of billions worldwide, as they are involved in obesity, depression and drug addiction. Consequently, there is growing interest to reveal novel active compounds in this field. Cloning of cannabinoid receptors in the 90s and the identification of the endogenous mediators arachidonylethanolamide (anandamide, AEA) and 2-arachidonyglycerol (2-AG), led to the characterization of the endocannabinoid system (ECS), together with their metabolizing enzymes and membrane transporters. Today, the ECS is known to be involved in diverse functions such as appetite control, food intake, energy balance, neuroprotection, neurodegenerative diseases, stroke, mood disorders, emesis, modulation of pain, inflammatory responses, as well as in cancer therapy. Western diet as well as restriction of micronutrients and fatty acids, such as DHA, could be related to altered production of pro-inflammatory mediators (e.g. eicosanoids) and ECs, contributing to the progression of cardiovascular diseases, , obesity, depression or impairing conditions, such as Alzheimer' s disease.

An elevated intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) has also been associated with a reduced cardiovascular risk. However, until now only little is known about the effect of apheresis treatment on the levels of omega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-6 PUFA and n-3 PUFA) in patients. Using gas chromatography (GC) the present study analyzed the content of n-6 and n-3 PUFA as well as saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids in the plasma of 20 patients with hyperlipidemia undergoing regular lipoprotein apheresis procedures in direct pre- and post-therapy measurements. Lipoprotein apheresis uniformly reduced the concentrations of  (AA), EPA and DHA fatty acids analyzed in the plasma. However, the three different apheresis methods analyzed (heparin precipitation, membrane filtration and direct absorption) had different effects on the fatty  profile in the plasma. We found that heparin precipitation and direct absorption apheresis procedures led to a significant decrease of plasma n-3 and n-6 PUFA by 40-50%. In contrast, patients undergoing membrane filtration apheresis, levels pre- and post-apheresis did not change significantly, with AA and EPA being only reduced by approximately 10% while levels of DHA were maintained pre- and post-apheresis. In contrast, total triglyceride levels were lowered most potently by membrane filtration apheresis. In summary, heparin precipitation and direct absorption apheresis approaches significantly lowered polyunsaturated fatty acids in plasma, while membrane filtration did not. This might have implications for cardiovascular and inflammatory risk/benefit profiles associated with n-6 and n-3 PUFA levels in the body.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Sodium orthovanadate at the given concentrations did not affect the amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) such as linoleic , , eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosapentaenoic  (DPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA). In conclusion, sodium orthovanadate changed SFA and MUFA composition in THP-1 macrophages and increased expression of SCD. Sodium orthovanadate did not affect the amount of any PUFA.

AA is metabolized by cyclo-oxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX) and cytochrome P450 enzymes to form several metabolites that have important biological actions. Of all the actions, role of AA in the regulation of blood pressure and its ability to prevent both type 1 and type 2  seems to be interesting. Studies showed that AA and its metabolites especially, lipoxin A4 (LXA4) and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), potent anti-inflammatory metabolites, have a crucial role in the pathobiology of hypertension and .

Cytochrome P450-derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), produced by selective epoxidation of , display anti-inflammatory activity in numerous disease models, in part through inhibition of NFκB activity. No studies have directly assessed their roles in cellular models of pancreatic beta cell death and therefore we aimed to investigate the cytoprotective effects of the EET isomers 8(9)-, 11(12)- and 14(15)-EET and their corresponding vicinal diols (dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids, DHETs) in a model of pro-inflammatory cytokine-toxicity using the rat pancreatic beta cell line BRIN-BD11. Co-treatment of cells with a cocktail of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IFNγ and TNFα) caused a marked increase in caspase activation and a reduction in cell viability, effects attenuated by inclusion of each EET; this was also associated with a reduction in cytokine-induced NFκB activation and nitrite accumulation. Surprisingly, of the DHET derivatives of EETs, 8(9)-DHET conferred similar protective effects against cytokine-induced caspase activation. This data therefore highlights a novel role of EETs and a surprising activity of 8(9)-DHET in attenuating cytokine-toxicity in pancreatic beta cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Regulation of lipid metabolism is crucial in the improvement of type 2  and obesity associated symptoms. The role of CaMKII in membrane associated lipid metabolism was the focus of this study. Five to six weeks old male Wistar rats were used in this study. GC×GC-TOFMS technique was used to determine the levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (linoleic ,  and 11,14-eicosadienoic ). Carnitine palmitoyltransferase (Cpt-1) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc-1) genes expression were assessed using quantitative real time PCR (qPCR). From the results, CaMKII activation by exercise increased the levels of  and 11,14-eicosadienoic  while a decrease in the level of linolenic  was observed in the skeletal muscle. The results indicated that exercise-induced CaMKII activation increased CPT-1 expression and decreased ACC-1 expression in rat skeletal muscle. All the observed increases with activation of CaMKII by exercise were aborted when KN93, an inhibitor of CaMKII was injected in exercising rats. This study demonstrated that CaMKII activation by exercise regulated lipid metabolism.

We analysed data from 20 prospective cohort studies from ten countries (Iceland, the Netherlands, the USA, Taiwan, the UK, Germany, Finland, Australia, Sweden, and France), with biomarkers sampled between 1970 and 2010. Participants included in the analyses were aged 18 years or older and had data available for linoleic  and  biomarkers at baseline. We excluded participants with type 2  at baseline. The main outcome was the association between omega-6 PUFA biomarkers and incident type 2 . We assessed the relative risk of type 2  prospectively for each cohort and lipid compartment separately using a prespecified analytic plan for exposures, covariates, effect modifiers, and analysis, and the findings were then pooled using inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis.Participants were 39 740 adults, aged (range of cohort means) 49-76 years with a BMI (range of cohort means) of 23·3-28·4 kg/m, who did not have type 2  at baseline. During a follow-up of 366 073 person-years, we identified 4347 cases of incident type 2 . In multivariable-adjusted pooled analyses, higher proportions of linoleic  biomarkers as percentages of total fatty  were associated with a lower risk of type 2  overall (risk ratio [RR] per interquintile range 0·65, 95% CI 0·60-0·72, p<0·0001; I=53·9%, p=0·002). The associations between linoleic  biomarkers and type 2  were generally similar in different lipid compartments, including phospholipids, plasma, cholesterol esters, and adipose tissue. Levels of  biomarker were not significantly associated with type 2  risk overall (RR per interquintile range 0·96, 95% CI 0·88-1·05; p=0·38; I=63·0%, p<0·0001).

Cardiac EETs reduce infarct size after ischemia-reperfusion injury and decrease fibrosis and inflammation in heart failure. In , EETs improve insulin sensitivity, increase glucose tolerance, and reduce the renal injury. These actions of EETs emphasize their therapeutic potential. To minimize metabolic inactivation, 14,15-EET agonist analogs with stable epoxide bioisosteres and carboxyl surrogates were developed. In preclinical rat models, a subset of agonist analogs, termed EET-A, EET-B, and EET-C22, are orally active with good pharmacokinetic properties. These orally active EET agonists lower blood pressure and reduce cardiac and renal injury in spontaneous and angiotensin hypertension. Other beneficial cardiovascular actions include improved endothelial function and cardiac antiremodeling actions. In rats, EET analogs effectively combat acute and chronic kidney disease including drug- and radiation-induced kidney damage, hypertension and cardiorenal syndrome kidney damage, and metabolic syndrome and  nephropathy.

Multivariable-adjusted associations of circulating and adipose tissue LA and AA biomarkers with incident total CVD and subtypes (coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, cardiovascular mortality) were investigated according to a prespecified analytic plan. Levels of LA and AA, measured as the percentage of total fatty acids, were evaluated linearly according to their interquintile range (ie, the range between the midpoint of the first and fifth quintiles), and categorically by quintiles. Study-specific results were pooled using inverse-variance-weighted meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was explored by age, sex, race, , statin use, aspirin use, omega-3 levels, and fatty  desaturase 1 genotype (when available).In 30 prospective studies with medians of follow-up ranging 2.5 to 31.9 years, 15 198 incident cardiovascular events occurred among 68 659 participants. Higher levels of LA were significantly associated with lower risks of total CVD, cardiovascular mortality, and ischemic stroke, with hazard ratios per interquintile range of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.88-0.99), 0.78 (0.70-0.85), and 0.88 (0.79-0.98), respectively, and nonsignificantly with lower coronary heart disease risk (0.94; 0.88-1.00). Relationships were similar for LA evaluated across quintiles. AA levels were not associated with higher risk of cardiovascular outcomes; in a comparison of extreme quintiles, higher levels were associated with lower risk of total CVD (0.92; 0.86-0.99). No consistent heterogeneity by population subgroups was identified in the observed relationships.In pooled global analyses, higher in vivo circulating and tissue levels of LA and possibly AA were associated with lower risk of major cardiovascular events.

In contrast, phospholipid FA content did not change between cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblast except for OA, which decreased by -62% (p < 0.05). Decreasing PHT TG and NEFA lipid content at 90h in culture is likely due to processes related to differentiation such as alterations in lipase activity that occur as cytotrophoblast cells differentiate.

Platelet activation plays a major role in CVDs. Thus, disrupting platelet activation represents an attractive therapeutic target. We examined the effect of esculetin in human platelet activation and experimental mouse models. At 10-80 μM, esculetin inhibited collagen- and -induced platelet aggregation in washed human platelets. However, it had no effects on other agonists such as thrombin and U46619. Esculetin inhibited adenosine triphosphate release, P-selectin expression, hydroxyl radical (OH) formation, Akt activation, and phospholipase C (PLC)γ2/protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation, but did not diminish mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation in collagen-activated human platelets. Platelet function analysis indicated that esculetin substantially prolonged the closure time of whole blood. In experimental mice, esculetin significantly increased the occlusion time in thrombotic platelet plug formation and reduced mortality associated with acute pulmonary thromboembolism. However, it did not prolong the bleeding time. This study demonstrates that esculetin inhibits human platelet activation via hindering the PLCγ2-PKC cascade, hydroxyl radical formation, Akt activation, and ultimately suppressing platelet activation.

In control or pregnant women with GDM at term, the maternal concentration of individual fatty acids does not correlate with neonatal body weight or fat mass, but cord blood fatty  levels correlate with birth weight and neonatal adiposity-positively in controls, but negatively in GDM. The proportion of AA and DHA in umbilical artery plasma in GDM is lower than in controls but not in umbilical vein plasma. Therefore, an increased utilization of those two fatty acids by fetal tissues, rather than impaired placental transfer, is responsible for their smaller proportion in plasma of GDM newborns. In control pregnant women, maternal glycemia controls neonatal body weight and fat mass, whereas in mothers with GDM-even with good glycemic control-maternal lipids and their greater utilization by the fetus play a critical role in neonatal body weight and fat mass. We propose that altered lipid metabolism rather than hyperglycemia constitutes a risk for macrosomia in GDM.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28978222>The Eicosanoids, Redox-Regulated Lipid Mediators in Immunometabolic Disorders.</a></h2><p>The oxidation of  via cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) activity to produce eicosanoids during inflammation is a well-known biosynthetic pathway. These lipid mediators are involved in fever, pain, and thrombosis and are produced from multiple cells as well as cell/cell interactions, for example, immune cells and epithelial/endothelial cells. Metabolic disorders, including hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and , are linked with chronic low-grade inflammation, impacting the immune system and promoting a variety of chronic diseases. Recent Advances: Multiple studies have corroborated the important function of eicosanoids and their receptors in (non)-inflammatory cells in immunometabolic disorders (e.g., insulin resistance, obesity, and cardiovascular and nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases). In this context, LOX and COX products are involved in both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. In addition, recent work has elucidated the potent function of specialized proresolving mediators (i.e., lipoxins and resolvins) in resolving inflammation, protecting organs, and stimulating tissue repair and remodeling.Inhibiting/stimulating selected eicosanoid pathways may result in anti-inflammatory and proresolution responses leading to multiple beneficial effects, including the abrogation of reactive oxygen species production, increased speed of resolution, and overall improvement of diseases related to immunometabolic perturbations.Despite many achievements, it is crucial to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying immunological/metabolic cross talk to offer substantial therapeutic promise.

This study aimed to assess the associations between PUFAs levels and the risk factors in PMI patients.We enrolled 1733 patients with known PUFA levels who were treated in five divisions of cardiology in a metropolitan area of Japan, including 303 patients with PMI. EPA/AA and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) to AA level ratio (DHA/AA) in patients with and without PMI were analyzed according to presence of coronary risk factors. patients with PMI had significantly lower EPA/AA and DHA/AA than  patients without PMI (EPA/AA: P <0.01; DHA/AA: P =0.003), with no such differences in dyslipidemia and hypertension patients. In DM patients with high high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels (>0.1 mg/dL), EPA/AA was low in individuals who also had PMI, whereas DHA/AA was not (EPA/AA, with PMI: 0.43 ± 0.24; without PMI: 0.53 ± 0.30, P < 0.05). Moreover, patients on statins had significantly lower DHA/AA ratios, whereas the EPA/AA ratio did not depend on statin use. Multiple regression analysis revealed that statin use in DM patients was associated with low DHA/AA but not EPA/AA.PMI patients with DM have low EPA/AA and DHA/AA. EPA/AA and DHA/AA are differently related to hs-CRP level in DM patients with PMI. Statin use can potentially affect DHA/AA but not EPA/AA, and therefore EPA/AA ratio is a better marker of assessment for cardiovascular events.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27836680>Associations between long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and cardiovascular lipid risk factors in youth with type 1 : SEARCH Nutrition Ancillary Study.</a></h2><p>In this longitudinal study we explored the relationships between plasma n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and Δ5 and Δ6 desaturase activities (D5D and D6D, respectively) and fasting lipids in youth with type 1  (T1D).Incident cases of T1D in youth <20years of age who were seen for a baseline study visit (N=914) and a 1-year follow-up visit (N=416) were included.

Uncertainty exists regarding which patient populations and/or tumor subtypes will benefit from metformin treatment, and most preclinical  studies have given little attention to the cellular pharmacology of intratumoral metformin uptake. Epidemiologic reports consistently link western-style high fat diets (HFD), which drive overweight and obesity, with increased risk of breast cancer. We used a rat model of HFD-induced overweight and mammary carcinogenesis to define intratumoral factors that confer metformin sensitivity. Mammary tumors were initiated with 1-methyl-1-nitrosourea, and rats were randomized into metformin-treated (2 mg/mL drinking water) or control groups (water only) for 8 weeks. Two-thirds of existing mammary tumors responded to metformin treatment with decreased tumor volumes ( < 0.05), reduced proliferative index ( < 0.01), and activated AMPK ( < 0.05). Highly responsive tumors accumulated 3-fold greater metformin amounts ( < 0.05) that were positively correlated with organic cation transporter-2 (OCT2) protein expression ( = 0.57;  = 0.038). Importantly, intratumoral metformin concentration negatively associated with tumor volume ( = 0.03), and each 10 pmol increase in intratumoral metformin predicted >0.11 cm reduction in tumor volume. Metformin treatment also decreased proinflammatory  >1.5-fold in responsive tumors ( = 0.023). Collectively, these preclinical data provide evidence for a direct effect of metformin  and suggest that OCT2 expression may predict metformin uptake and tumor response. .©2017 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29566193>Serum n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and risk of death: the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study.</a></h2><p>The cardioprotective properties of linoleic  (LA), a major n-6 (ω-6) polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA), have been recognized, but less is known about its associations with other causes of death. Relatively little is also known about how the minor n-6 PUFAs-γ-linolenic  (GLA), dihomo-γ-linolenic  (DGLA), and  (AA)-relate to mortality risk.We investigated the associations of serum n-6 PUFAs, an objective biomarker of exposure, with risk of death in middle-aged and older men and whether disease history modifies the associations.We included 2480 men from the prospective Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study, aged 42-60 y at baseline in 1984-1989. The stratified analyses by baseline disease status included 1019 men with a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, or  and 1461 men without a history of disease.During the mean follow-up of 22.4 y, 1143 deaths due to disease occurred. Of these, 575 were CVD deaths, 317 were cancer deaths, and 251 were other-cause deaths. A higher serum LA concentration was associated with a lower risk of death from any cause (multivariable-adjusted HR for the highest compared with the lowest quintile: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.71; P-trend < 0.001) and with deaths due to CVD (extreme-quintile HR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.40, 0.74; P-trend < 0.001) and non-CVD or noncancer causes (HR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.30, 0.76; P-trend = 0.001). Serum AA had similar, although weaker, inverse associations. Serum GLA and DGLA were not associated with risk of death, and none of the fatty acids were associated with cancer mortality. The results were generally similar among those with or without a history of major chronic disease (P-interaction > 0.13).Our findings showed an inverse association of a higher biomarker of LA intake with total and CVD mortality and little concern for risk, thus supporting the current dietary recommendations to increase LA intake for CVD prevention.

Since then, extensive research has been conducted in vitro using conductance vessels and materials derived from them. However, the microcirculation controls blood flow to vital organs and has been the focus of in vivo studies of endothelium-dependent dilation beginning immediately after the first in vitro report. Initial in vivo studies employed a light/dye technique for selectively damaging the endothelium to unequivocally prove, in vivo, the existence of endothelium-dependent dilation and in the microvasculature. Endothelium-dependent constriction was similarly proven. Endothelium-dependent agonists include acetylcholine (ACh), bradykinin, , calcium ionophore A-23187, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), serotonin, histamine and endothelin-1. Normal and disease states have been studied. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase and cytochrome P450 have been shown to generate the mediators of the responses. Some of the key enzyme systems generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) like superoxide which may prevent EDR. However, one ROS, namely H O , is one of a number of hyperpolarizing factors that cause dilation initiated by endothelium. Depending upon microvascular bed, a single agonist may use different pathways to elicit an endothelium-dependent response. Interpretation of studies using inhibitors of eNOS is complicated by the fact that these inhibitors may also inhibit ATP-sensitive potassium channels. Other in vivo observations of brain arterioles failed to establish nitric oxide as the mediator of responses elicited by CGRP or by ACh and suggest that a nitrosothiol may be a better fit for the latter.© 2018 Scandinavian Physiological Society.

GPCRs are attractive therapeutic targets for the treatment of human diseases, as they finely regulate a wide array of cellular functions. In this minireview, we summarized what is currently known about the G protein-coupled receptor GPR31/12-HETER. We highlighted, in particular, its structural similarity with human homologs, the biological functions of its recognized ligand 12()-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (HETE), an  metabolite, and the role that GPR31/12-HETER-mediated signals play in cancer cell growth, invasion and metastasis, and in liver ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury.

The full spectrum of GPR31/12-HETER-mediated biological functions has yet to be characterized. Further studies are needed to identify other potential ligands, i.e. other than 12()-HETE.

Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a poor trigger of AA mobilization in macrophages but does have the capacity to prime these cells for greatly increased AA release upon subsequent stimulation. In this work, we have studied molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. By using mass spectrometry-based lipidomic analyses, we show in this work that LPS-primed zymosan-stimulated macrophages exhibit an elevated consumption of a particular phospholipid species, i.e., the ethanolamine plasmalogens, which results from reduced remodeling of phospholipids  coenzyme A-independent transacylation reactions. Importantly however, LPS-primed macrophages show no changes in their capacity to directly incorporate AA into phospholipids  CoA-dependent acylation reactions. The essential role for ethanolamine plasmalogen hydrolysis in LPS priming is further demonstrated by the use of plasmalogen-deficient cells. These cells, while responding normally to zymosan by releasing quantities of AA similar to those released by cells expressing normal plasmalogen levels under the same conditions, fail to show an LPS-primed response to the same stimulus, thus unambiguously demonstrating a cause-effect relationship between LPS priming and plasmalogen hydrolysis. Collectively, these results suggest a hitherto unrecognized role for ethanolamine plasmalogen hydrolysis and CoA-independent transacylation reactions in modulating the eicosanoid biosynthetic response.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728086>Seafood intake and the development of obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 .</a></h2><p>We provide an overview of studies on seafood intake in relation to obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 . Overweight and obesity development is for most individuals the result of years of positive energy balance. Evidence from intervention trials and animal studies suggests that frequent intake of lean seafood, as compared with intake of terrestrial meats, reduces energy intake by 4-9 %, sufficient to prevent a positive energy balance and obesity. At equal energy intake, lean seafood reduces fasting and postprandial risk markers of insulin resistance, and improves insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant adults. Energy restriction combined with intake of lean and fatty seafood seems to increase weight loss. Marine n-3 PUFA are probably of importance through n-3 PUFA-derived lipid mediators such as endocannabinoids and oxylipins, but other constituents of seafood such as the fish protein per se, trace elements or vitamins also seem to play a largely neglected role. A high intake of fatty seafood increases circulating levels of the insulin-sensitising hormone adiponectin. As compared with a high meat intake, high intake of seafood has been reported to reduce plasma levels of the hepatic acute-phase protein C-reactive protein level in some, but not all studies. More studies are needed to confirm the dietary effects on energy intake, obesity and insulin resistance. Future studies should be designed to elucidate the potential contribution of trace elements, vitamins and undesirables present in seafood, and we argue that stratification into responders and non-responders in randomised controlled trials may improve the understanding of health effects from intake of seafood.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31428465>Netrin-1 Alters Adipose Tissue Macrophage Fate and Function in Obesity.</a></h2><p>Macrophages accumulate prominently in the visceral adipose tissue (VAT) of obese humans and high fat diet (HFD) fed mice, and this is linked to insulin resistance and type II . While the mechanisms regulating macrophage recruitment in obesity have been delineated, the signals directing macrophage persistence in VAT are poorly understood. We previously showed that the neuroimmune guidance cue netrin-1 is expressed in the VAT of obese mice and humans, where it promotes macrophage accumulation. To better understand the source of netrin-1 and its effects on adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) fate and function in obesity, we generated mice with myeloid-specific deletion of netrin-1 (   ; Ntn1). Interestingly, Ntn1 mice showed a modest decrease in HFD-induced adiposity and adipocyte size, in the absence of changes in food intake or leptin, that was accompanied by an increase in markers of adipocyte beiging (, UCP-1). Using single cell RNA-seq, combined with conventional histological and flow cytometry techniques, we show that myeloid-specific deletion of netrin-1 caused a 50% attrition of ATMs in HFD-fed mice, particularly of the resident macrophage subset, and altered the phenotype of residual ATMs to enhance lipid handling. Pseudotime analysis of single cell transcriptomes showed that in the absence of netrin-1, macrophages in the obese VAT underwent a phenotypic switch with the majority of ATMs activating a program of genes specialized in lipid handling, including fatty  uptake and intracellular transport, lipid droplet formation and lipolysis, and regulation of lipid localization. Furthermore, Ntn1 macrophages had reduced expression of genes involved in  metabolism, and targeted LCMS/MS metabololipidomics analysis revealed decreases in proinflammatory eicosanoids (5-HETE, 6- LTB, TXB, PGD) in the obese VAT. Collectively, our data show that targeted deletion of netrin-1 in macrophages reprograms the ATM phenotype in obesity, leading to reduced adipose inflammation, and improved lipid handling and metabolic function.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30621707>Plasma lipidomic signatures of spontaneous obese rhesus monkeys.</a></h2><p>Obesity plays crucial roles in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases such as hyperlipidemia, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and type 2  (T2D).

The EPA group also exhibited significant decreases in the incremental TG peak, area under the curve (AUC) for postprandial TG, incremental glucose peak, AUC for postprandial glucose, and improvements in glycometabolism categorization. No significant changes were observed for hemoglobin A1c and fasting plasma glucose levels.

The protective effects of thiamine against diabetic vascular complications have been well documented. However, slower absorption and reduced bioavailability is a major limiting factor for its clinical use. To overcome this issue, lipid-soluble derivatives of thiamine (allithiamines) was developed. Among the many synthetic lipophilic derivatives of thiamine, benfotiamine (BFT) is regarded as the first choice based on its safety and clinical efficacy data. BFT facilitates the action of thiamine diphosphate, a cofactor for the enzyme transketolase. The activation of transketolase enzyme accelerates the precursors of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) towards the pentose phosphate pathway thereby reducing the production of AGEs.

Fatty  translocase (FAT/CD36), whose expression is inducible in obesity, is known for its function in fatty  uptake. Previous work by us and others suggested that CD36 plays an important role in hepatic lipid homeostasis, but the results have been conflicting and the mechanisms were not well understood. In this study, by using CD36-overexpressing transgenic (CD36Tg) mice, we uncovered a surprising function of CD36 in regulating glycogen homeostasis. Overexpression of CD36 promoted glycogen synthesis, and as a result, CD36Tg mice were protected from fasting hypoglycemia. When challenged with a high-fat diet (HFD), CD36Tg mice showed unexpected attenuation of hepatic steatosis, increased very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion, and improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. The HFD-fed CD36Tg mice also showed decreased levels of proinflammatory hepatic prostaglandins and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (20-HETE), a potent vasoconstrictive and proinflammatory  metabolite. We propose that CD36 functions as a protective metabolic sensor in the liver under lipid overload and metabolic stress. CD36 may be explored as a valuable therapeutic target for the management of metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

Recent studies have implicated lipidomic changes across numerous psychiatric disorders. In particular, there is growing evidence that the concentrations of several classes of lipids are altered in those diagnosed with MDD. However, for lipidomic abnormalities to be considered potential treatment targets for MDD (rather than secondary manifestations of the disease), a shared etiology between lipid concentrations and MDD should be demonstrated.In a sample of 567 individuals from 37 extended pedigrees (average size 13.57 people, range=3-80), we used mass spectrometry lipidomic measures to evaluate the genetic overlap between twenty-three biologically distinct lipid classes and a dimensional scale of MDD.We found that the lipid class with the largest endophenotype ranking value (ERV, a standardized parametric measure of pleiotropy) were ether-phosphodatidylcholines (alkylphosphatidylcholine, PC(O) and alkenylphosphatidylcholine, PC(P) subclasses). Furthermore, we examined the cluster structure of the twenty-five species within the top-ranked lipid class, and the relationship of those clusters with MDD. This analysis revealed that species containing  generally exhibited the greatest degree of genetic overlap with MDD.This study is the first to demonstrate a shared genetic etiology between MDD and ether-phosphatidylcholine species containing , an omega-6 fatty  that is a precursor to inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandins.

We quantitatively determined 11 FFAs, seven cytokine/adipokine, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and C-peptide levels from the fasting blood samples that were collected at 16 weeks of gestation. Multivariate analyses were performed along with separate analyses for each individual FFA.High HOMA-IR (p<0.001) and C-peptide (p<0.0001) levels were positively associated with a twofold to fourfold increased risk for developing gestational  (GDM). Negative relationships were found with specific FFAs (molecular percentage, palmitoleic, oleic, linolenic, myristic acids) and HOMA-IR and C-peptide levels (p<0.01 to p<0.0001). In contrast, palmitic, stearic, , dihomo-γ-linolenic (DGLA) and docosahexaenoic acids were positively associated with HOMA-IR and C-peptide (p<0.01 to p<0.0001). The individual FFAs also predicted cytokine/adipokine levels. For example, women who had elevated DGLA (highest quartile) were twice as (adjusted OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.98) likely to have higher interleukin (IL)-8 (p<0.0001) levels. Conversely, women with high palmitoleic, oleic, and linolenic  levels had reduced odds (≥2-fold, p<0.01 to p<0.001) for having higher IL-8, IL-6 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels.Our results suggest that maternal individual FFAs uniquely affect insulin resistance and secretion.

These findings indicate that statins may affect the endogenous synthesis of LCPUFAs, which is regulated by fatty  desaturases (FADSs) and elongation of very long‑chain fatty acids proteins (ELOVLs). The present study aimed to investigate the roles of the intrinsic mevalonate cascade and Rho‑dependent pathway in statin‑induced regulation of these desaturases and elongases, as well as cell viability using mouse 3T3‑L1 cells. mRNA expression was analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Treatment with atorvastatin decreased cell viability and increased the mRNA expression levels of Fads1, Fads2 and ELOVL fatty  elongase 5 (Elovl5) in a dose‑dependent manner. Mevalonate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), but not cholesterol, fully reversed the atorvastatin‑induced downregulation of cell viability and upregulation of gene expression; however, mevalonate itself did not affect cell viability and gene expression. The Rho‑associated protein kinase inhibitor Y‑27632 inhibited the mevalonate‑ and GGPP‑mediated reversal of atorvastatin‑induced upregulation of Fads1, Fads2 and Elovl5.

However, the mechanism of these "pleiotropic" benefits of statins is poorly understood. Vitamin D has been suggested as a potential mediator of the anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic and vascular protecting effects of statins. Aim of present study was to assess the impact of a high-intensity statin therapy on vitamin D levels and platelet function in patients with coronary artery disease.Patients discharged on dual antiplatelet therapy and high-intensity statins after an ACS or elective PCI were scheduled for main chemistry and vitamin D levels assessment at 30-90days post-discharge. Vitamin D (25-OHD) dosing was performed by chemiluminescence method through the LIAISON® Vitamin D assay (Diasorin Inc). Platelet function was assessed by Multiplate® (multiple platelet function analyser; Roche Diagnostics AG).Among 246 patients included, 142 were discharged on a new statin therapy or with an increase in previous dose (Inc-S), while 104 were already receiving a high-dose statin at admission, that remained unchanged (Eq-S). Median follow-up was 75.5days. Patients in the Inc-S group were younger (p=0.01), smokers (p<0.001), with a less frequent history of hypercholesterolemia (p=0.05),  (p=0.03), hypertension (p=0.02), or previous cardiovascular events (p<0.001). They were more often admitted for an acute coronary syndrome (p<0.001) and used less anti-hypertensive drugs or nitrates. Higher total circulating calcium was observed in the Inc-S group (p=0.004), while baseline vitamin D levels were similar in the 2 groups (p=0.30). A significant reduction in the circulating low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was observed in the Inc-S group. Vitamin D levels increased in the Inc-S patients but not in the Eq-S group (delta-25OHD: 23.2±20.5% vs 3.1±4.7%, p=0.003), with a linear relationship between the magnitude of vitamin D elevation and the reduction of LDL cholesterol (r=-0.17, p=0.01).

The locations and distribution were ICA (125, 55.6%), PcomA (47, 20.9%), VA (38, 16.8%), and BA (15, 6.7%). Two hundred and eighteen aneurysms were treated with the stent-assisted coiling and seven patients with LVIS stents alone. Angiographic follow-up was available for 115 (51.1%) aneurysms, 8 (7.0%) of which had recurrences including 7 (6.5%) unruptured aneurysms and 1(14.3%) ruptured aneurysm. The procedural complication rate was 2.75% in total, including distal hemorrhage (1, 0.45%; SAH), ischemic events (5, 2.3%). Conclusions Our single-center retrospective experience is one of the larger studies to date assessing the LVIS device. Compared with many laser-cut stent studies, the LVIS device had a higher aneurysm complete occlusion rate at follow-up coupled with low complication rates. However, this study was our initial experience with LVIS, larger patient numbers, and longer follow-up will be needed to fully assess the long-term efficacy of LVIS in treating intracranial aneurysms.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30293595>Genetic variant in the 3'-untranslated region of the COX2 gene is associated with type 2 : A hospital-based case-control study.</a></h2><p>Type 2  (T2DM) is caused by the decreased β-cell mass and insulin deficiency, and disease is characterized by hypoglycemia. The insulin resistance also plays an important role in T2DM pathogenesis. Insulin resistance is the reduced biological response to insulin at the normal concentration in the circulation and develops with the influence of environmental factors with genetic abnormalities. In recent years, it has been reported that inflammatory pathway causes activation of the insulin resistance. Chronic inflammation inhibits the insulin sensitivity through activation of signaling pathways which are directly associated with the key components of insulin signaling pathway. Cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes are key enzymes that catalysis prostaglandin synthesis from . COX2 is an inducible COX isoform and that plays an important role in inflammatory process by leading the synthesis of pro- and anti- inflammatory prostaglandins. In our study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between variants of COX-2 gene which is one of the key components of the inflammatory pathway, and T2DM risks. In this study, we evaluated rs5275 and rs689466 variants located on the COX-2 gene by PCR-RFLP in 100 T2DM patients and 100 control subjects. The interaction among COX2 variants and T2DM was analyzed using appropriate methods. The both variants were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in patients and controls (p > 0.05). A significant association was observed for genotype distribution of COX2 rs5275 site between control and T2DM cases (p = 0.042). In a dominant model, the cases who had at least one copy of allele C, were at increased risk of T2DM (p = 0.016). We found no significant association for the COX2 rs689466 domain by evaluating homozygous, heterozygous, dominant, and recessive models (p > 0.05). According to our data, the rs5275 variant of the COX2 in the 3'-UTR may contribute to the etiology or modulate the risk of T2DM, whereas the rs689466 variant of the COX2 gene is not associated with T2DM risk.Copyright © 2018.

Decades after the seminal discoveries involving its cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase branches, studies of this cascade remain an active area of research. The third and less widely known branch, the cytochrome P450 pathway leads to highly active oxygenated lipid mediators, epoxy fatty acids (EpFAs) and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), which are of similar potency to prostanoids and leukotrienes. Unlike the COX and LOX branches, no pharmaceuticals currently are marketed targeting the P450 branch. However, data support therapeutic benefits from modulating these regulatory lipid mediators. This is being approached by stabilizing or mimicking the EpFAs or even by altering the diet. These approaches lead to predominantly beneficial effects on a wide range of apparently unrelated states resulting in an enigma of how this small group of natural chemical mediators can have such diverse effects. EpFAs are degraded by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) and stabilized by inhibiting this enzyme. In this review, we focus on interconnected aspects of reported mechanisms of action of EpFAs and inhibitors of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEHI). The sEHI and EpFAs are commonly reported to maintain homeostasis under pathological conditions while remaining neutral under normal physiological conditions. Here we provide a conceptual framework for the unique and broad range of biological activities ascribed to epoxy fatty acids. We argue that their mechanism of action pivots on their ability to prevent mitochondrial dysfunction, to reduce subsequent ROS formation and to block resulting cellular signaling cascades, primarily the endoplasmic reticulum stress. By stabilizing the mitochondrial - ROS - ER stress axis, the range of activity of EpFAs and sEHI display an overlap with the disease conditions including , fibrosis, chronic pain, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, for which the above outlined mechanisms play key roles.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Hepatic ACSL4 is coregulated with the phospholipid (PL)-remodeling enzyme lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) acyltransferase 3 by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ to modulate the plasma triglyceride (TG) metabolism. In this study, we investigated the acute effects of hepatic ACSL4 deficiency on lipid metabolism in adult mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Adenovirus-mediated expression of a mouse ACSL4 shRNA (Ad-shAcsl4) in the liver of HFD-fed mice led to a 43% reduction of hepatic arachidonoyl-CoA synthetase activity and a 53% decrease in ACSL4 protein levels compared with mice receiving control adenovirus (Ad-shLacZ). Attenuated ACSL4 expression resulted in a substantial decrease in circulating VLDL-TG levels without affecting plasma cholesterol. Lipidomics profiling revealed that knocking down ACSL4 altered liver PL compositions, with the greatest impact on accumulation of abundant LPC species (LPC 16:0 and LPC 18:0) and lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) species (LPE 16:0 and LPE 18:0). In addition, fasting glucose and insulin levels were higher in Ad-shAcsl4-transduced mice versus control (Ad-shLacZ). Glucose tolerance testing further indicated an insulin-resistant phenotype upon knockdown of ACSL4. These results provide the first in vivo evidence that ACSL4 plays a role in plasma TG and glucose metabolism and hepatic PL synthesis of hyperlipidemic mice.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30677774>Roles of 12-Lipoxygenase and Its Interaction with Angiotensin II on p21 and p27 Expression in Diabetic Nephropathy.</a></h2><p>12-Lipoxygenase (12-LO) and angiotensin II (Ang II) are involved in the development of diabetic renal hypertrophy, in which cyclin-kinase inhibitors, p21 and p27 play pivotal roles. Here, we study the effects of 12-LO and its interaction with Ang II on glomerular p21 and p27 expression in diabetic conditions.Models used in the current study include glomerular mesangial cells (MCs); and glomeruli from (1) type 2 diabetic db/db mice; (2) type 2 diabetic rats induced by high-fat diet feeding followed by streptozotocin injection; (3) 12-LO knockout (12-LOKO) mice; and (4) normal rats infused with Ang II or 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (12[S]-HETE,  metabolite of 12-LO).The protein expression levels of p21 and p27 were increased in high glucose-stimulated MCs and in glomeruli isolated from db/db mice. In type 2 diabetic rats, cinnamyl-3,4-dihydroxy-α-cynanocinnamate (inhibitor of 12-LO) attenuated the increases in glomerular p21 and p27 protein expression, while in normal rats, 12(S)-HETE injection increased glomerular p21 and p27 expression. 12(S)-HETE and Ang II were mutually stimulated in glomeruli. Glomerular p21 and p27 expression were decreased in 12-LOKO mice compared to levels in control mice, and Ang II stimulation increased the protein expression of p27 in control but not 12-LOKO mice.

Type 1  (type 1 DM) is due to autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β cells because of enhanced production of IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and other pro-inflammatory cytokines released by immunocytes infiltrating the pancreas in response to unknown exogenous and endogenous toxin(s). On the other hand, type 2 DM is due to increased peripheral insulin resistance secondary to enhanced production of IL-6 and TNF-α in response to high-fat and/or calorie-rich diet (rich in saturated and trans fats). Type 2 DM is also associated with significant alterations in the production and action of hypothalamic neurotransmitters, eNO, BDNF, free radicals, gut hormones, and vagus nerve activity. Thus, type 1 DM is because of excess production of pro-inflammatory cytokines close to β cells, whereas type 2 DM is due to excess of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the systemic circulation. Hence, methods designed to suppress excess production of pro-inflammatory cytokines may form a new approach to prevent both type 1 and type 2 DM. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and similar surgeries ameliorate type 2 DM, partly by restoring to normal: gut hormones, hypothalamic neurotransmitters, eNO, vagal activity, gut microbiota, bioactive lipids, BDNF production in the gut and hypothalamus, concentrations of cytokines and free radicals that results in resetting glucose-stimulated insulin production by pancreatic β cells. Our recent studies suggested that bioactive lipids, such as , eicosapentaneoic , and docosahexaenoic  (which are unsaturated fatty acids) and their anti-inflammatory metabolites: lipoxin A4, resolvins, protectins, and maresins, may have antidiabetic actions. These bioactive lipids have anti-inflammatory actions, enhance eNO, BDNF production, restore hypothalamic dysfunction, enhance vagal tone, modulate production and action of ghrelin, leptin and adiponectin, and influence gut microbiota that may explain their antidiabetic action. These pieces of evidence suggest that methods designed to selectively deliver bioactive lipids to pancreatic β cells, gut, liver, and muscle may prevent type 1 and type 2 DM.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149059>STREPTOZOTOCIN-INDUCED  - A PARADOX OF HIGH INTRINSIC PLATELET REACTIVITY AND LOW  PLATELET AGGREGATION.</a></h2><p>Studies of platelet function in diabetics are inconsistent, some studies reporting higher platelet reactivity, while others showed no change.We aimed to evaluate platelet indices and  platelet aggregation in rats with long-lasting (28 weeks) .Twelve controls and 14 diabetic rats were investigated.  was induced in 11-week-old rats using streptozotocin (60 mg/kg,i.p.).

In such cases, the immune system fails to recognize between foreign agents and its own body cells. Different factors, such as genetic factors (CD25, STAT4), epigenetic factors (DNA methylation, histone modifications) and environmental factors (xenobiotics, drugs, hormones) trigger autoimmunity. Glucocorticoids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), immunosuppressive and biological agents are currently used to manage autoimmune diseases of different origins. However, complete cure remains elusive. Many dietary and natural products including polyphenols have been widely studied as possible alternative treatment strategies for the management of autoimmune disorders. Polyphenols possess a wide-range of pharmacological and therapeutic properties, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. As immunomodulatory agents, polyphenols are emerging pharmaceutical tools for management of various autoimmune disorders including vitiligo, ulcerative colitis and multiple sclerosis (MS). Polyphenols activate intracellular pathways such as  dependent pathway, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathway, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) signaling pathway and epigenetic modulation, which regulate the host's immune response.

The results demonstrated that there was a clear separation among the three groups in the PCA model. Fourteen potential biomarkers were identified by OPLS-DA, and they were determined to be produced in response to the therapeutic effects of F-GAL. These biomarkers were involved in histidine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, energy metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and  metabolism. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that a metabonomics approach is a powerful, novel tool that can be used to evaluate the underlying therapeutic mechanisms of herb extracts.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We aimed to investigate the determinants of serum glycerophospholipids' FAs in CF with regard to the highest number of FAs and in the largest cohort to date. The study comprised 172 CF patients and 30 healthy subjects (HS). We assessed Fas' profile (gas chromatography/mass spectrometry), CF transmembrane conductance regulator () genotype, spirometry, fecal elastase-1, body height and weight , liver disease,  and colonization by . The amounts of saturated FAs (C14:0, C16:0) and monounsaturated FAs (C16:1n-7, C18:1n-9, C20:1n-9, C20:3n-9) were significantly higher in CF patients than in HS. C18:3n-6, C20:3n-6 and C22:4n-6 levels were also higher in CF, but C18:2n-6, C20:2n-6 and C20:4n-6, as well as C22:6n-3, were lower. In a multiple regression analysis, levels of seven FAs were predicted by various sets of factors that included age, genotype, forced expiratory volume in one second, pancreatic status and . FA composition abnormalities are highly prevalent in CF patients. They seem to be caused by both metabolic disturbances and independent clinical risk factors. Further research into the influence of  mutations on fat metabolism and desaturases' activity is warranted.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27656405>Sexually dimorphic brain fatty  composition in low and high fat diet-fed mice.</a></h2><p>In this study, we analyzed the fatty  profile of brains and plasma from male and female mice fed chow or a western-style high fat diet (WD) for 16 weeks to determine if males and females process fatty acids differently. Based on the differences in fatty acids observed in vivo, we performed in vitro experiments on N43 hypothalamic neuronal cells to begin to elucidate how the fatty  milieu may impact brain inflammation.Using a comprehensive mass spectrometry fatty  analysis, which includes a profile for 52 different fatty  isomers, we assayed the plasma and brain fatty  composition of age-matched male and female mice maintained on chow or a WD. Additionally, using the same techniques, we determined the fatty  composition of N43 hypothalamic cells following exposure to palmitic and linoleic , alone or in combination.Our data demonstrate there is a sexual dimorphism in brain fatty  content both following the consumption of the chow diet, as well as the WD, with males having an increased percentage of saturated fatty acids and reductions in ω6-polyunsaturated fatty acids when compared to females. Interestingly, we did not observe a sexual dimorphism in fatty  content in the plasma of the same mice. Furthermore, exposure of N43 cells to the ω6-PUFA linoleic , which is higher in female brains when compared to males, reduces palmitic -induced inflammation.Our data suggest male and female brains, and not plasma, differ in their fatty  profile.

Therefore, an untargeted metabolomics approach was firstly applied to study the serum  differences in mice. Metabolomics analysis was performed using ultra performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS) together with multivariate statistical data analysis. The results showed that Plantaginis semen can mainly improve blood lipids, some degree in blood glucose and insulin levels in high-fat mice, in addition, the phenotype of liver and fat stained sections demonstrated remarkable results. A total of 22 metabolites involved in , glycerophospholipid, glycosphingolipid, linoleate, Omega-3 fatty , phosphatidylinositol phosphate and tyrosine metabolisms were identified. In further, it was found that the possible mechanisms of Plantaginis semen on hyperlipidemic mice lied in the biosynthesis of thyroxine, biological effects of enzymes of phospholipase A2 activity, glucosylceramide synthase and inositol essential enzyme 1α, genes expressions of fatty  metabolism and inflammation. Serum metabolomics revealed that Plantaginis semen could cure the organism disease via regulating multiple  pathways which will be helpful for understanding the mechanism of this herb and providing references for better applications of it in clinic, even researches on other TCMs.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Given the asymmetric distribution of fatty acids within phospholipids, where saturated fatty acids tend to be present at the sn-1 position, and polyunsaturated fatty acids such as those of the omega-3 and omega-6 series overwhelmingly localize in the sn-2 position, the phospholipase A reaction is of utmost importance as a regulatory checkpoint for the mobilization of these fatty acids and the subsequent synthesis of proinflammatory omega-6-derived eicosanoids on one hand, and omega-3-derived specialized pro-resolving mediators on the other. The great variety of phospholipase As, their differential substrate selectivity under a variety of pathophysiological conditions, as well as the different compartmentalization of each enzyme and accessibility to substrate, render this class of enzymes also key to membrane phospholipid remodeling reactions, and the generation of specific lipid mediators not related with canonical metabolites of omega-6 or omega-3 fatty acids. This review highlights novel findings regarding the selective hydrolysis of phospholipids by phospholipase As and the influence this may have on the ability of these enzymes to generate distinct lipid mediators with essential functions in biological processes.

We determined wall mechanics and vascular reactivity in ex vivo middle cerebral arteries (MCA) from male Goto-Kakizaki rats (GK; ~17 wk old) versus control Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) to test the hypothesis that the diabetic environment in GK, in the absence of obesity and other comorbidities, leads to endothelial dysfunction and impaired vascular tone regulation. Dilation of MCA following challenge with acetylcholine and hypoxia was blunted in MCA from GK versus WKY, due to lower nitric oxide bioavailability and altered  metabolism, whereas myogenic activation and constrictor responses to serotonin were unchanged. MCA wall distensibility and cross-sectional area were not different between GK and WKY, suggesting that wall mechanics were unchanged at this age, supported by the determination that MCA dilation to sodium nitroprusside was also intact. With the use of ex vivo aortic rings as a bioassay, altered vascular reactivity determined in MCA was paralleled by relaxation responses in artery segments from GK, whereas measurements of vasoactive metabolite production indicated a loss of nitric oxide and prostacyclin bioavailability and an increased thromboxane A production with both methacholine challenge and hypoxia. These results suggest that endothelium-dependent dilator reactivity of MCA in GK is impaired with T2DM, and that this impairment is associated with the genesis of a prooxidant/pro-inflammatory condition with .

Middle-aged women are at a greater risk of MetS, type 2 , and cardiovascular disease than men because they have more subcutaneous fat and larger waist circumferences compared with men with equal visceral fat levels. In this study, we investigated the effects of calorie restriction (CR) and fish oil supplementation (CRF) on middle-aged Taiwanese women with MetS. An open-label, parallel-arm, controlled trial was conducted for 12 weeks. A total of 75 eligible participants were randomly assigned to the CR or CRF group. Both the dietary intervention groups were further divided into two age groups: ≤45 and >45 years. Changes in MetS severity, inflammatory status, iron status, and red blood cell fatty  profile were evaluated. A total of 71 participants completed the trial. Both dietary interventions significantly ameliorated MetS and improved the participants' inflammatory status. CR significantly increased the total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) whereas CRF increased hepcidin levels in women aged >45 years. Furthermore, CRF significantly increased the n-6/n-3 and /docosahexaenoic  ratios. Both interventions improved the anthropometric and MetS characteristics, including body weight, blood glucose and triglyceride levels, and the score of the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index. In conclusion, the 12-week dietary interventions improved the abnormal metabolic status of middle-aged obese women.

In this study, the antidiabetic effect of fenugreek flavonoids was investigated by metabonomics based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). Fenugreek flavonoids were purified using polyamide resin and D101 macroporous adsorption resin, characterized by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS, and administered to streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats for 28 days. Pharmacological study results indicated that fenugreek flavonoids exerted a strong antidiabetic effect characterized by significant reduction of fasting blood glucose (P < 0.01), increase in serum insulin level (P < 0.01) and liver glycogen content (P < 0.01), attenuation of weight loss, and improvement of pancreatic islet and kidney conditions. The antidiabetic effect of fenugreek flavonoids was further analyzed by metabonomics. Serum samples of health and diabetic rats treated or not with fenugreek flavonoids were evaluated by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS, followed by principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projection to latent structures squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). The PCA model revealed significant differences among the animal groups, and OPLS-DA identified fenugreek flavonoids-induced changes of 11 potential biomarkers involved in lipid metabolism (docosahexaenoic , , sphinganine, sphingosine‑1‑phosphate, and lysophosphatidylcholines 20:4, 18:2, 16:0, and 20:2), amino  metabolism (hippuric  and tryptophan), and kidney function-related metabolism (2‑phenylethanol glucuronide).

In addition, the primary prostaglandins D and E have been mainly reported as inhibitors of platelet function. The platelet 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX) product, i.e. the hydroperoxide 12-HpETE, appears to stimulate platelet ArA metabolism at the level of its release from membrane phospholipids through phospholipase A (cPLA) and cyclooxygenase (COX-1) activities, the first enzymes in prostanoid production cascade. Also, 12-HpETE may regulate the oxygenation of other polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) by platelets, especially that of eicosapentaenoic  (EPA). On the other hand, the reduced product of 12-HpETE, 12-HETE, is able to antagonize TxA action. This is even more obvious for the 12-LOX end-products from docosahexaenoic  (DHA), 11- and 14-HDoHE. In addition, 12-HpETE plays a key role in platelet oxidative stress as observed in pathophysiological conditions, but may be regulated by DHA with a bimodal way according to its concentration.

We tested the hypothesis that an obesogenic diet prepared with medium chain SFA (MCSFA), mostly as lauric -derived from coconut oil, reduces obesity-induced outcomes compared to obesogenic diets prepared with increasing amounts long chain SFA (LCSFA), primarily palmitic . Mice were fed (16 weeks) a control, low fat diet or obesogenic diets prepared with differing content of MCSFA or LCSFA in which polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (PUFA; MUFA) were kept constant. Inclusion of MCSFA in an obesogenic diet prevented hepatic lipid accumulation and lowered indices of insulin resistance. Obesogenic diets reduced hepatic levels of de novo lipogenesis proteins (SCD1 and FASN) but elevated the adipose levels of mRNA for the pro-inflammatory markers Mcp-1 and Tnfα. Lipidomic analysis of plasma indicated that MCSFA intake resulted in a different lipidomic signature than LCSFA intake, prevented elevation of pro-inflammatory ceramides, but elevated concentrations of some lipids associated with elevated cardiovascular disease risk. Intake of the obesogenic diets in an SFA-type dependent manner elevated plasma concentrations of several phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipids having the long chain PUFA (LCPUFA)  (ARA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), altered phospholipid ethers, and changed the triacylglyceryl environments of these LCPUFA.

Plants represent a source of bioactive compounds whose antioxidant activity may be useful in protecting against pro-oxidative reactions.The study determines the in vitro biological activity of the ethanolic extracts from the shoots and roots of Scutellaria species (S. altissima and S. alpina) in selected blood cells (blood platelets and lymphocytes).Platelet activity, both resting and after thrombin stimulation, was used to indicate the ability of the plant extracts to inhibit the production of superoxide anion radicals (O2 •-) and platelet lipid peroxidation. The generation of superoxide anion radicals was measured by cytochrome c reduction. Lipid peroxidation in blood platelets was measured by the level of thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS). The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetric assay was used to determine the protective effect of Scutellaria extracts on lymphocyte cells against oxidative damage induced by hydroxyl radicals.Extracts (5-50 μg/mL) containing phenolic compounds from both Scutellaria species distinctly reduced nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation and  metabolism by blood platelets in vitro. When given at the tested concentration, the extracts reduced the generation of O2 •- in resting blood platelets and platelets activated by thrombin in vitro.

An overactivity of the endocannabinoid system plays a pathophysiological role in the development of visceral obesity and insulin resistance. Moreover, elevated circulating endocannabinoid levels are also prevalent in atherosclerosis. The pathophysiological increase of endocannabinoid levels is due to an altered expression of endocannabinoid synthesizing and degrading enzymes induced by inflammatory mediators such as cytokines or lipids. Emerging experimental evidence suggests that enhanced endocannabinoid signalling affects atherosclerosis via multiple effects, including a modulation of vascular inflammation, leukocyte recruitment, macrophage cholesterol metabolism and consequently atherosclerotic plaque stability. In addition, recent findings in various metabolic disease models highlight the relevance of peripheral CB1 cannabinoid receptors in adipose tissue, liver and pancreas, which crucially regulate lipid and glucose metabolism as well as macrophage properties in these organs. This suggests that targeting the endocannabinoid system in the vasculature and peripheral organs might have a therapeutic potential for atherosclerosis by inhibiting vascular inflammation and improving metabolic risk factors. This review will provide a brief update on the effects of endocannabinoid signalling in atherosclerosis and related metabolic complications.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28109294>Probing the intermolecular interactions of PPARγ-LBD with polyunsaturated fatty acids and their anti-inflammatory metabolites to infer most potential binding moieties.</a></h2><p>PPARγ is an isoform of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) belonging to a super family of nuclear receptors.

Activation of group VIA phospholipase A (iPLAβ) causes accumulation of , lysophospholipids, and eicosanoids that can promote inflammation and pathologic states. We examined the role of iPLAβ in peritoneal macrophage immune function by comparing wild type (WT) and iPLAβ mouse macrophages. Compared with WT, iPLAβ macrophages exhibited reduced proinflammatory M1 markers when classically activated. In contrast, anti-inflammatory M2 markers were elevated under naïve conditions and induced to higher levels by alternative activation in iPLAβ macrophages compared with WT. Induction of eicosanoid (12-lipoxygenase (12-LO) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2))- and reactive oxygen species (NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4))-generating enzymes by classical activation pathways was also blunted in iPLAβ macrophages compared with WT. The effects of inhibitors of iPLAβ, COX2, or 12-LO to reduce M1 polarization were greater than those to enhance M2 polarization. Certain lipids (lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidic , and prostaglandin E) recapitulated M1 phenotype in iPLAβ macrophages, but none tested promoted M2 phenotype. These findings suggest that (a) lipids generated by iPLAβ and subsequently oxidized by cyclooxygenase and 12-LO favor macrophage inflammatory M1 polarization, and (b) the absence of iPLAβ promotes macrophage M2 polarization.

Mean GFR among participants with CKD was 37.3 compared with 89.3 ml/min per 1.73 m2 among controls. Fasted-state differences between CKD and controls included abnormalities in tryptophan metabolism, ubiquinone biosynthesis, and the TCA cycle. Insulin infusion markedly decreased metabolite levels, predominantly amino acids and their metabolites. CKD was associated with attenuated insulin-induced changes in nicotinamide, , and glutamine/glutamate metabolic pathways. Metabolomics profiling suggests disruption in amino  metabolism and mitochondrial function as putative manifestations or mechanisms of the impaired anabolic effects of insulin in CKD.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001352>In Vitro Antiatherothrombotic Effects of Extracts from  L.,  L., and  Benth.</a></h2><p>Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. The pathogenesis is mainly due to atherosclerosis, plaque rupture, and platelet thrombus formation. The main risk factors for coronary artery disease include obesity, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, , and high blood pressure. As a part of disease management, treatment options using anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs can be applied with addition to lipid-lowering medication. However, medicinal plants comprising antiatherothrombotic effects can be used as options to combat the disease rather than drug therapies with lesser adverse effects. Therefore, the haematological effect of  L. L., and  Benth extracts was studied using in vitro model to prevent and to treat coronary atherothrombotic disease. The aqueous, methanol, and polysaccharide extracts of  and  respectively, were studied for their anticoagulant and antiplatelet effect on human whole blood. Extracts were subjected to the prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) test for anticoagulant activity. The antiplatelet activity was investigated using an electrical impedance method.  aqueous extract (BVAE),  polysaccharide extract (BVPE),  aqueous extract (TPAE), and  polysaccharide extract (TPPE) significantly prolonged the coagulation time in a concentration-dependent manner (<0.05). The administration of BVAE demonstrated the most effective antiplatelet activity against platelet aggregation caused by  (AA) and collagen. These antiplatelet activities may correspond to the presence of higher total phenolic compound, which thus inhibit the platelet aggregation activity. In conclusion, these findings provide strong evidence on the antiatherothrombotic effect of BVAE and TPAE.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30311825>Effects of α-Lipoic , Carnosine, and Thiamine Supplementation in Obese Patients with Type 2 : A Randomized, Double-Blind Study.</a></h2><p>Type 2  (T2DM) is evolving to an epidemic of the modern world. T2DM is associated with a number of pathological complications, including cardiovascular disease that is mostly promoted by the increased oxidative stress in type 2 diabetic patients. We performed a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to investigate the effectiveness of an individualized oral supplementation with α-lipoic  (ALA), carnosine, and thiamine. For that purpose, 82 obese type 2 diabetic patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups, and were either supplemented daily with 7 mg ALA/kg body weight, 6 mg carnosine/kg body weight, and 1 mg thiamine/kg body weight or placebo for 8 weeks. An array of biochemical tests including the estimation of oxidative stress and platelet aggregation were performed at baseline and at follow-up. Moreover, the antiplatelet activity of each of the supplement's components was determined ex vivo at human and washed rabbit platelets. Glucose and HbA levels were significantly reduced after supplementation (135.7 ± 19.5 mg/dL vs. 126.5 ± 16.8 mg/dL and 8.3% ± 0.3% vs. 6.03% ± 0.58%, respectively, P < .05); however, insulin was significantly increased (3.6 ± 0.7 μIU/mL vs. 6.8 ± 0.2 μIU/mL, P < .05). The patients treated with the supplement recorded higher follow-up values for HOMA-IR and HOMA-β, and a significant drop in serum hydroperoxide level. Only ALA inhibited platelets aggregation ex vivo through ADP, platelet activating factor, , epinephrine, collagen, and thrombin pathways. Daily supplementation with an individualized ALA, carnosine, and thiamine supplement effectively reduced glucose concentration in type 2 diabetic patients, probably by increasing insulin production from the pancreas. In addition to that, the reduction of oxidative stress and inhibition of platelet aggregation could potentially provide greater cardiovascular protection. Further studies are needed to fine-tune the supplementation dose-response effects in T2DM patients.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28405672>Glucagon-like peptide 1-related peptides increase nitric oxide effects to reduce platelet activation.</a></h2><p>Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is object of intensive investigation for not only its metabolic effects but also the protective vascular actions. Since platelets exert a primary role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, inflammation and vascular complications, we investigated whether GLP-1 directly influences platelet reactivity. For this purpose, in platelets from 72 healthy volunteers we evaluated GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) expression and the effects of a 15-minute incubation with the native form GLP-1(7-36), the N-terminally truncated form GLP-1(9-36) and the GLP-1 analogue Liraglutide (100 nmol/l) on: i) aggregation induced by collagen or  (AA); ii) platelet function under shear stress; iii) cGMP and cAMP synthesis and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG)-induced Vasodilator-Stimulated-Phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation; iv) activation of the signalling molecules Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase (PI3-K)/Akt and Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK)/ERK-1/2; and v) oxidative stress. Experiments were repeated in the presence of the nitric oxide donor Na-nitroprusside. We found that platelets constitutively express GLP-1R and that, independently of GLP-1R, GLP-1(7-36), GLP-1(9-36) and Liraglutide exert platelet inhibitory effects as shown by: a) increased NO-antiaggregating effects, b) increased the activation of the cGMP/PKG/VASP pathway, c) reduced the activation of PI3-K/Akt and MAPK/ERK-2 pathways, d) reduced the AA-induced oxidative stress. When the experiments were repeated in the presence of the antagonist of GLP-1R Exendin(9-39), the platelet inhibitory effects were maintained, thus indicating a mechanism independent of GLP-1R. In conclusion, GLP-1(7-36), its degradation product GLP-1(9-36) and Liraglutide exert similar inhibitory effects on platelet activation, suggesting a potential protective effect on the cardiovascular system.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29986998>Differential composition of DHA and very-long-chain PUFAs in rod and cone photoreceptors.</a></h2><p>Long-chain PUFAs (LC-PUFAs; C20-C22; e.g., DHA and ) are highly enriched in vertebrate retina, where they are elongated to very-long-chain PUFAs (VLC-PUFAs; C 28) by the elongation of very-long-chain fatty acids-4 (ELOVL4) enzyme.

The relevance of different lipid requirements in rods and cones to disease processes, such as age-related macular degeneration, however, remains unclear. To better understand the role of LC-PUFAs and VLC-PUFAs in the retina, we investigated the lipid compositions of whole retinas or photoreceptor outer segment (OS) membranes in rodents with rod- or cone-dominant retinas. We analyzed fatty  methyl esters and the molecular species of glycerophospholipids (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine) by GC-MS/GC-flame ionization detection and ESI-MS/MS, respectively. We found that whole retinas and OS membranes in rod-dominant animals compared with cone-dominant animals had higher amounts of LC-PUFAs and VLC-PUFAs. Compared with those of rod-dominant animals, retinas and OS membranes from cone-dominant animals also had about 2-fold lower levels of di-DHA (22:6/22:6) molecular species of glycerophospholipids. Because PUFAs are necessary for optimal G protein-coupled receptor signaling in rods, these findings suggest that cones may not have the same lipid requirements as rods.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28352940>Cytochrome P450 epoxygenase-derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids contribute to insulin sensitivity in mice and in humans.</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance is frequently associated with hypertension and type 2 .

Insulin secretory function was assessed using hyperglycaemic clamps and isolated islets. Vascular function was tested in isolated perfused mesenteric vessels. Insulin sensitivity and secretion were assessed in humans using frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance tests and plasma EETs were measured by mass spectrometry.Cyp2c44  mice showed decreased glucose tolerance (639 ± 39.5 vs 808 ± 37.7 mmol/l × min for glucose tolerance tests, p = 0.004) and insulin sensitivity compared with WT controls (hyperinsulinaemic clamp glucose infusion rate average during terminal 30 min 0.22 ± 0.02 vs 0.33 ± 0.01 mmol kg min in WT and Cyp2c44  mice respectively, p = 0.003).

Capillary density was similar but vascular K-induced relaxation was impaired in isolated Cyp2c44  vessels (maximal response 39.3 ± 6.5% of control, p < 0.001), suggesting that impaired vascular reactivity produces impaired insulin sensitivity in vivo.

Epidemiological and experimental data suggest that acetylsalicylic  (ASA) helps prevent colorectal cancer (CRC), possibly through cyclooxygenase (COX)-mediated suppression of eicosanoid, particularly PGE, formation. Recent studies suggest that statins prevent CRC and improve survival after diagnosis. We identified patients on ASA and/or statin treatment undergoing routine colonoscopy and measured eicosanoid levels in colonic mucosa with targeted metabolomics technology (LC-MS/MS). ASA-treated individuals (n = 27) had significantly lower tissue eicosanoid levels of most COX-derived metabolites than untreated individuals (n = 31). In contrast, COX-derived lipid metabolites tended to be higher in patients with statin treatment (n = 7) as compared with those not receiving statins (n = 24). This effect was not discernible in subjects treated with ASA and statins (n = 11): Individuals treated with both drugs showed a pronounced suppression of COX-derived eicosanoids in colon tissue, even compared with subjects treated with ASA alone. Our data from a routine clinical setting support the hypothesis that ASA and statins could inhibit CRC development via lipid mediator modification.

We used Cox regression analysis and combined results using meta-analysis. Independent of classical CVD risk factors, ten metabolites were associated with risk of MI in both cohorts, including sphingomyelins, diacyl-phosphatidylcholines and acyl-alkyl-phosphatidylcholines with pooled relative risks in the range of 1.21-1.40 per one standard deviation increase in metabolite concentrations. The metabolites showed positive correlations with total- and LDL-cholesterol (r ranged from 0.13 to 0.57). When additionally adjusting for total-, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and C-reactive protein, acyl-alkyl-phosphatidylcholine C36:3 and diacyl-phosphatidylcholines C38:3 and C40:4 remained associated with risk of MI. When added to classical CVD risk models these metabolites further improved CVD prediction (c-statistics increased from 0.8365 to 0.8384 in EPIC-Potsdam and from 0.8344 to 0.8378 in EPIC-Heidelberg). None of the metabolites was consistently associated with stroke risk.

Many of today's pharmacopeia that block pro-inflammatory chemical mediators can cause serious unwanted side effects such as immune suppression. Uncontrolled inflammation is now considered a pathophysiologic basis associated with many widely occurring diseases such as cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases, , obesity and asthma, as well as the classic inflammatory diseases, e.g. arthritis, periodontal diseases. The inflammatory response is designated to be a self-limited process that produces a superfamily of chemical mediators that stimulate resolution of inflammatory responses. Specialized proresolving mediators (SPM) uncovered in recent years are endogenous mediators that include omega-3-derived families resolvins, protectins and maresins, as well as -derived (n-6) lipoxins that stimulate and promote resolution of inflammation, clearance of microbes, reduce pain and promote tissue regeneration via novel mechanisms.

Using a mouse model of type 2  with microvascular complications, we examined lipid levels in plasma and in renal, neural, and retinal tissues to identify shared and distinct lipid abnormalities. We used correlation analysis to construct interaction networks in each tissue, to associate changes in lipids with changes in enzymes of lipid metabolism, and to identify overlap of coregulated lipid subclasses between plasma and each tissue to define subclasses of plasma lipids to use as surrogates of tissue lipid metabolism. Lipid metabolism alterations were mostly tissue specific in the kidney, nerve, and retina; no lipid changes correlated between the plasma and all three tissue types. However, alterations in diacylglycerol and in lipids containing , an inflammatory mediator, were shared among the tissue types, and the highly saturated cholesterol esters were similarly coregulated between plasma and each tissue type in the diabetic mouse.

Therefore, we aimed to verify whether: (1) human healthy- or diabetic-platelets are cardioprotective, (2) sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors and downstream kinases play a role in platelet-induced cardioprotection, and (3) a correlation between platelet redox status and myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury exists. Isolated rat hearts were subjected to 30-min ischemia and 1-h reperfusion. Infarct size was studied in hearts pretreated with healthy- or diabetic-platelets. Healthy-platelets were co-infused with sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor blocker, ERK-1/2 inhibitor, PI3K antagonist or PKC inhibitor to ascertain the cardioprotective mechanisms. In platelets we assessed (i) aggregation response to ADP, collagen, and , (ii) cyclooxygenase-1 levels, and (iii) AKT and ERK-phosphorylation. Platelet sphingosine-1-phosphate production and platelet levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were quantified and correlated to infarct size. Infarct size was reduced by about 22% in healthy-platelets pretreated hearts only. This cardioprotective effect was abrogated by either sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors or ERK/PI3K/PKC pathway blockade. Cyclooxygenase-1 levels and aggregation indices were higher in diabetic-platelets than healthy-platelets. Diabetic-platelets released less sphingosine-1-phosphate than healthy-platelets when mechanical or chemically stimulated . Yet, ROS levels were higher in diabetic-platelets and correlated with infarct size. Cardioprotective effects of healthy-platelet depend on the platelet's capacity to activate cardiac sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors and ERK/PI3K/PKC pathways. However, diabetic-platelets release less S1P and lose cardioprotective effects. Platelet ROS levels correlate with infarct size.

This class of drugs acts by binding to cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) receptors and blocking their activation and the subsequent inflammatory cascade which cause the symptoms commonly associated with asthma and allergic rhinitis. The cysteinyl leukotrienes (C4, D4 and E4) are products of  metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. These eicosanoids bind to CysLT receptors. The CysLT type-1 receptor is found in the human airway smooth muscle cells and airway macrophages and on other proinflammatory cells. In asthmatic patients, leukotriene mediated effects include airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process. In allergic rhinitis, CysLTs are released from the nasal mucosa after allergen exposure and precipitate the symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Two leukotriene receptor antagonists are available in the United States, zafirlukast (1996) and montelukast (1998). Both are oral agents used in management of asthma and allergic rhinitis.

The present article focuses on the role of TxA signaling in endothelium-dependent contractions of arteries.  (AA) is metabolized by cyclooxygenase (COX) to form the unstable prostaglandin H which is further converted into TxA. After being produced by thromboxane synthase (TxAS), TxA ultimately stimulates TxA/prostanoid (TP) receptor to induce vasoconstriction. The calcium ionophore A23187, the prostanoid precursor AA, or the muscarinic receptor agonist acetylcholine (ACh) can evoke endothelium-dependent contractions associated with TxA. The endothelium-dependent contractions shown in hypertension, , atherogenesis, and other cardiovascular diseases have been significantly reduced by antagonism of COX, TxAS, or TP receptor. So inhibition of the bioavailability and/or effect of TxA may be promising therapeutic targets to prevent these diseases.

Mast cells are known to participate in three phases of wound healing: the inflammatory reaction, angiogenesis and extracellular-matrix reabsorption.

To test the hypothesis that the fatty  (FA) compositions differ between Sri Lankan and Japanese populations and that high concentrations of n-3 polyunsaturated FAs and linoleic  are associated with a low level of arteriosclerosis, the authors compared the circulating FA compositions between Sri Lankan and Japanese populations and examined the association of the circulating FA composition with arterial stiffness in each population. The study participants were patients with , dyslipidemia, or hypertension in Sri Lanka (n = 100) or Japan (n = 236). Serum FA compositions were measured by gas chromatography. Arterial stiffness was measured using the cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI). Analysis of covariance was used to compare the FA compositions between the populations. Multiple regression was used to assess the association between each FA and CAVI levels. The concentrations of myristic, γ-linolenic, dihomo-γ-linolenic, and  acids were higher in the Sri Lankan patients than in the Japanese patients. In contrast, the concentrations of linoleic, α-linolenic, and eicosapentaenoic acids were higher in the Japanese patients than in the Sri Lankan patients. Although no associations of n-3 polyunsaturated FAs and linoleic  with CAVI were observed in both patient populations, odd-chain saturated FAs (pentadecanoic and heptadecanoic acids) were significantly inversely associated with CAVI levels in the Sri Lankan (P for trend = .03) but not the Japanese patients. The odd-chain saturated FAs might be inversely associated with atherosclerosis in this Sri Lankan population.Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Phagocytosis involves membrane reorganization and remodeling events on the cell surface, which play an essential role in innate immunity and tissue homeostasis and the control of inflammation. In this work, we report that cells deficient in membrane ethanolamine plasmalogen demonstrate a reduced capacity to phagocytize opsonized zymosan particles. Amelioration of plasmalogen deficiency in these cells by incubation with lysoplasmalogen results in a significant augmentation of the phagocytic capacity of the cells. In parallel with these increases, restoration of plasmalogen levels in the cells also increases the number and size of lipid rafts in the membrane, reduces membrane fluidity down to levels found in cells containing normal plasmalogen levels, and improves receptor-mediated signaling. Collectively, these results suggest that membrane plasmalogen level determines characteristics of the plasma membrane such as fluidity and the formation of microdomains that are necessary for efficient signal transduction leading to optimal phagocytosis by macrophages.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28107816>The time course of erythrocyte membrane fatty  concentrations during and after treatment of non-human primates with increasing doses of an omega-3 rich phospholipid preparation derived from krill-oil.</a></h2><p>A commonly used measure to reflect the intake of the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA is the omega-3 index, defined as the sum of EPA + DHA as % of total fatty acids in erythrocyte membrane. When the omega-3 index changes it follows that the relative fractions of other fatty acids in the membrane are also changed. In the present study, increasing doses of a preparation of omega-3 rich phospholipids extracted from krill oil were administered orally to non-human primates for 12 weeks and the time course of EPA, DHA and 22 other fatty acids in erythrocytes was determined bi-weekly during treatment and for 8 weeks after cessation of treatment. Plasma concentrations of six endocannabinoid-type mediators being downstream metabolites of some fatty acids analyzed in erythrocytes were also determined.Six diabetic, dyslipidemic non-human primates were included, three in a vehicle control group and three being treated with the omega-3 rich phospholipid preparation. The vehicle control and test items were given daily by gavage and the test item doses were 50, 150 and 450 mg phospholipids/kg/day. Each dose level was given for four weeks. Blood was sampled at baseline and thereafter bi-weekly. Fatty acids were determined in erythrocytes by methylation followed by gas-chromatography. Endocannabinoids and endocannabinoid-like mediators were analyzed in plasma by liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-mass spectrometry.The treatment resulted in a dose-related increase in the fraction of EPA and DHA in erythrocyte membranes and a dose-related decrease of other poly-unsaturated fatty acids, in particular omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Erythrocyte concentrations of saturated fatty acids remained unchanged throughout the experiment. Plasma concentrations of endocannabinoids and endocannabinoid-like mediators changed accordingly as those being downstream  decreased, downstream of the saturated palmitic and oleic acids remained unchanged while a downstream EPA metabolite increased.Increasing the omega-3 index by administering an omega-3 rich phospholipid extracted from krill oil did not alter the ratio of unsaturated vs. saturated fatty acids in the erythrocyte membranes but only the relative concentrations of unsaturated fatty acids, in particular unsaturated omega-6 fatty acids.

Prior studies indicate that the FADS genes have been subjected to strong positive selection in Africa, South Asia, Greenland, and Europe. By comparing FADS sequencing data from present-day and Bronze Age (5-3k years ago) Europeans, we identify possible targets of selection in the European population, which suggest that selection has targeted different alleles in the FADS genes in Europe than it has in South Asia or Greenland. The alleles showing the strongest changes in allele frequency since the Bronze Age show associations with expression changes and multiple lipid-related phenotypes. Furthermore, the selected alleles are associated with a decrease in linoleic  and an increase in  and eicosapentaenoic acids among Europeans; this is an opposite effect of that observed for selected alleles in Inuit from Greenland. We show that multiple SNPs in the region affect expression levels and PUFA synthesis. Additionally, we find evidence for a gene-environment interaction influencing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels between alleles affecting PUFA synthesis and PUFA dietary intake: carriers of the derived allele display lower LDL cholesterol levels with a higher intake of PUFAs. We hypothesize that the selective patterns observed in Europeans were driven by a change in dietary composition of fatty acids following the transition to agriculture, resulting in a lower intake of  and eicosapentaenoic , but a higher intake of linoleic  and α-linolenic .© The Author 2017.

Recently, PEAR1 (platelet endothelial aggregation receptor-1) rs12041331 polymorphism has been shown to influence the platelet reactivity, but its impact on cardiovascular outcomes remains unclear in patients treated with antiplatelet agents.In this prospective cohort study, 2439 Chinese patients with acute coronary syndrome or stable coronary artery disease undergoing coronary stent implantation and receiving clopidogrel and aspirin were consecutively recruited.

Genotyping for PEAR1 showed 768 (38.3%) GG homozygotes, 941 (46.9%) GA heterozygotes, and 298 (14.8%) AA homozygotes. The 30-day incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events, the composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke were significantly higher in AA homozygotes than in non-AA homozygotes (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.78; 95% CI, 1.13-6.82; P=0.026), irrespective of CYP2C19*2 loss-of-function polymorphism and known outcome predictors including age, sex, smoking, and .

Individuals with T2DM have a significantly increased risk of developing chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its associated complications, therefore, it is of great importance to establish strategies for combatting T2DM and its associated chronic conditions. Current literature has identified several biomarkers that are known to play a key role in the pathogenesis of CVD. Many of these biomarkers affecting CVD are influenced by an increase in oxidative stress as seen in T2DM. The purpose of this review is to analyse and correlate the oxidative stress-related biomarkers that have been identified in the literature to provide an updated summary of their significance in CVD risk factors.This review has analysed current research on T2DM, CVD, and oxidative stress. Four key cardiovascular risk factors: thrombosis, inflammation, vascular homeostasis and cellular proliferation were searched to identify potential biomarkers for this review. These biomarkers stem from seven major cellular pathways; NF-κB, Keap1-Nrf2, protein kinase-C, macrophage activation,  mobilisation, endothelial dysfunction and advanced glycation end products.The pathways and biomarkers were analysed to show their role as contributing factors to CVD development and a summary is made regarding the assessment of cardiovascular risk in T2DM individuals.Copyright © 2017.

Serum total fatty  composition was analysed by gas chromatography in 240 infants with islet autoimmunity and 480 control infants at the age of 3 and 6 months. Islet autoimmunity was defined as repeated positivity for islet cell autoantibodies in combination with at least one of three selected autoantibodies. In addition, a subset of 43 infants with primary insulin autoimmunity (i.e. those with insulin autoantibodies as the first autoantibody with no concomitant other autoantibodies) and a control group (n = 86) were analysed. A third endpoint was primary GAD autoimmunity defined as GAD autoantibody appearing as the first antibody without other concomitant autoantibodies (22 infants with GAD autoimmunity; 42 infants in control group). Conditional logistic regression was applied, considering multiple comparisons by false discovery rate <0.05.Serum fatty  composition differed between breastfed and non-breastfed infants, reflecting differences in the fatty  composition of the milk. Fatty acids were associated with islet autoimmunity (higher serum pentadecanoic, palmitic, palmitoleic and docosahexaenoic acids decreased risk; higher :docosahexaenoic and n-6:n-3  ratios increased risk). Furthermore, fatty acids were associated with primary insulin autoimmunity, these associations being stronger (higher palmitoleic , cis-vaccenic, , docosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids decreased risk; higher α-linoleic  and :docosahexaenoic and n-6:n-3  ratios increased risk). Moreover, the quantity of breast milk consumed per day was inversely associated with primary insulin autoimmunity, while the quantity of cow's milk consumed per day was directly associated.Fatty  status may play a role in the development of type 1 -associated autoimmunity. Fish-derived fatty acids may be protective, particularly during infancy. Furthermore, fatty acids consumed during breastfeeding may provide protection against type 1 -associated autoimmunity.

The objective of the present study was to determine whether there is a difference in inflammatory markers, blood  and lipid panels and lymphocyte gene expression in response to a high-fat dairy food challenge with or without milk fat globule membrane (MFGM). Participants consumed a dairy product-based meal containing whipping cream (WC) high in saturated fat with or without the addition of MFGM, following a 12 h fasting blood draw. Inflammatory markers including IL-6 and C-reactive protein, lipid and  panels and lymphocyte gene expression fold changes were measured using multiplex assays, clinical laboratory services and TaqMan real-time RT-PCR, respectively. Fold changes in gene expression were determined using the Pfaffl method. Response variables were converted into incremental AUC, tested for differences, and corrected for multiple comparisons. The postprandial insulin response was significantly lower following the meal containing MFGM ( < 0·01). The gene encoding soluble epoxide hydrolase () was shown to be more up-regulated in the absence of MFGM ( = 0·009).

Platelets activated by AGEs agonize endothelial responses promoting cardiovascular disease (CVD) development. While it has been established that AGEs can alter platelet functions, little is known about the specific platelet pathways that AGEs modify. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of AGEs on specific salient platelet pathways related to CVDs and whether the effects that AGEs elicit are dependent on glycation extent. To accomplish our objective, platelets were incubated with reversibly or irreversibly glycated albumin. A time course for adhesion and aggregation agonist receptor expression was assessed. Optical platelet aggregometry was used to confirm the functional activity of platelets after AGE exposure. In general, platelets subjected to glycated albumin had a significantly enhanced adhesion and aggregation potential. Furthermore, we observed an enhancement in dense body secretion and intracellular calcium concentration. This was especially prevalent for platelets exposed to irreversibly glycated albumin. Additionally, functional aggregation correlated well with receptor expression, suggesting that AGE-induced altered receptor sensitivity translated to altered platelet functions. Our findings indicate that under diabetic vascular conditions platelets become more susceptible to activation and aggregation due to an overall enhanced receptor expression, which may act to promote CVD development.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31371090>M2-like cells from the macrophage lineage might play a central role in closure of the embryonic neural tube.</a></h2><p>Herein it is hypothesized that M2-like macrophages or pre-macrophages of fetal origin might play a central role in development and closure of the neural tube. Early in embryonic development, pre-macrophages arise from the fetal yolk sac and track through the bloodstream to reach diverse embryonic tissues, where they mature. Most of these macrophages exhibit an M2-like phenotype. The critical period for neural tube closure is contained within the period of yolk sac-derived pre-macrophage tracking and distribution, which poses a question: might these pre-macrophages or macrophages exert an influence on the closing neural tube? Evidence suggests that perturbations in macrophage polarization or M2 macrophage function might contribute to the failure of neural tube closure associated with , one carbon metabolism (including folic  deficit), inositol, , and sphingosine-1-phosphate, as well as in the teratogenicity of nitric , valproic , and fumonisin. The influence of each of these factors is interpreted in light of potential interactions with M2-like macrophages or macrophage progenitors on the developing neural tube. By placing these anti inflammatory macrophages at the center of various epigenetic, neurochemical, and signaling processes suspected to be involved in neural tube closure, potential associations are revealed between macrophages and embryonic structural developmental processes such as collagen and actin dynamics. The choice of this model is also an attempt to explain why some etiologies for failure of neural tube closure are rescued by folic , whereas other etiologies are rescued only by formate, inositol, or not at all.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Glucose-stimulated insulin release was inhibited ∼50% with ACSL4 and ACSL3 knockdown and unaffected in cell lines with knockdown of ACSL5, ACLS6 and ACSL1. Lentivirus shRNA-mediated gene silencing of ACSL4 and ACSL3 in human pancreatic islets inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin release. ACSL4 and ACSL3 knockdown cells showed inhibition of ACSL enzyme activity more with arachidonate than with palmitate as a substrate, consistent with their preference for unsaturated fatty acids as substrates. ACSL4 knockdown changed the patterns of fatty acids in phosphatidylserines and phosphatidylethanolamines. The results show the involvement of ACLS4 and ACLS3 in insulin secretion.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AA distributes differentially across membrane phospholipids, which is largely due to the action of coenzyme A-independent transacylase (CoA-IT), an enzyme that moves the fatty  primarily from diacyl phospholipid species to ether-containing species, particularly the ethanolamine plasmalogens. In this work, we examined the dependence of AA remodeling on plasmalogen content using the murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 and its plasmalogen-deficient variants RAW.12 and RAW.108. All three strains remodeled AA between phospholipids with similar magnitude and kinetics, thus demonstrating that cellular plasmalogen content does not influence the process. Cell stimulation with yeast-derived zymosan also had no effect on AA remodeling, but incubating the cells in AA-rich media markedly slowed down the process. Further, knockdown of cytosolic-group IVC phospholipase Aγ (cPLAγ) by RNA silencing significantly reduced AA remodeling, while inhibition of other major phospholipase A forms such as cytosolic phospholipase Aα, calcium-independent phospholipase Aβ, or secreted phospholipase A had no effect. These results uncover new regulatory features of CoA-IT-mediated transacylation reactions in cellular AA homeostasis and suggest a hitherto unrecognized role for cPLAγ in maintaining membrane phospholipid composition via regulation of AA remodeling.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28825176>The dual role of group V secretory phospholipase A in pancreatic β-cells.</a></h2><p>Group X (GX) and group V (GV) secretory phospholipase A (sPLA) potently release  (AA) from the plasma membrane of intact cells. We previously demonstrated that GX sPLA negatively regulates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) by a prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-dependent mechanism. In this study we investigated whether GV sPLA similarly regulates GSIS.GSIS and pancreatic islet-size were assessed in wild-type (WT) and GV sPLA-knock out (GV KO) mice. GSIS was also assessed ex vivo in isolated islets and in vitro using MIN6 pancreatic beta cell lines with or without GV sPLA overexpression or silencing.GSIS was significantly decreased in islets isolated from GV KO mice compared to WT mice and in MIN6 cells with siRNA-mediated GV sPLA suppression. MIN6 cells overexpressing GV sPLA (MIN6-GV) showed a significant increase in GSIS compared to control cells. Though the amount of AA released into the media by MIN6-GV cells was significantly higher, PGE2 production was not enhanced or cAMP content decreased compared to control MIN6 cells. Surprisingly, GV KO mice exhibited a significant increase in plasma insulin levels following i.p. injection of glucose compared to WT mice. This increase in GSIS in GV KO mice was associated with a significant increase in pancreatic islet size and number of proliferating cells in β-islets compared to WT mice.Deficiency of GV sPLA results in diminished GSIS in isolated pancreatic beta-cells. However, the reduced GSIS in islets lacking GV sPLA appears to be compensated by increased islet mass in GV KO mice.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30251333>12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  impairs vascular endothelial permeability by altering adherens junction phosphorylation levels and affecting the binding and dissociation of its components in high glucose-induced vascular injury.</a></h2><p> is an important risk factor for atherosclerotic disease. The initiating factor of atherosclerosis is local endothelial cell injury. The  metabolite, 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (12[S]-HETE), might be involved in this process. In recent years, some studies have discussed the effect of 12(S)-HETE on vascular endothelial cell function. In the present study, we investigated the effect of 12(S)-HETE on vascular endothelial cell function in high-glucose conditions and the mechanisms involved.Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured in conventional M199 medium and high-glucose M199 medium. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were stimulated with 12(S)-HETE and cinnamyl-3,4-dihydroxy-α-cyanocinnamate (a 12/15-lipoxygenases inhibitor). A type 1  model was established in C57BL/6 or 12/15-lipoxygenases knockout mice with streptozotocin. Aortic tissue was harvested for subsequent testing. The transmembrane transport of dextran and human acute monocytic leukaemia cell line (THP-1) cells was measured. The adherens junction protein, IkBα, nuclear factor kappa Bp65 (P65), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and vascular cell adhesion protein 1 expression and phosphorylation, and the binding/dissociation of endothelial cell components were observed.Transendothelial migration of dextran and THP-1 cells was significantly increased by stimulation of human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers with high glucose and 12(S)-HETE (P < 0.05). High glucose and 12(S)-HETE altered the vascular endothelial cadherin and β-catenin phosphorylation level, and promoted the dissociation of β-catenin and vascular endothelial cadherin. Expression levels of P-Ikbα, P-P65, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and vascular cell adhesion protein 1 were elevated in high glucose and 12(S)-HETE treated cells and diabetic mice compared with controls (P < 0.05).The lipoxygenases metabolite, 12(S)-HETE, can impair vascular endothelial permeability by altering adherens junction phosphorylation levels, and affecting the binding and dissociation of its components in high-glucose conditions.© 2018 The Authors.

It provides a clear understanding of the molecular mechanisms of action of phenolic compounds. Polyphenols regulate immunity by interfering with immune cell regulation, proinflammatory cytokines' synthesis, and gene expression. They inactivate NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) and modulate mitogen-activated protein Kinase (MAPk) and  acids pathways. Polyphenolic compounds inhibit phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases/protein kinase B (PI3K/AkT), inhibitor of kappa kinase/c-Jun amino-terminal kinases (IKK/JNK), mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) which is a protein complex that controls protein synthesis, and JAK/STAT. They can suppress toll-like receptor (TLR) and pro-inflammatory genes' expression. Their antioxidant activity and ability to inhibit enzymes involved in the production of eicosanoids contribute as well to their anti-inflammation properties. They inhibit certain enzymes involved in reactive oxygen species ROS production like xanthine oxidase and NADPH oxidase (NOX) while they upregulate other endogenous antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione (GSH) peroxidase (Px). Furthermore, they inhibit phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) leading to a reduction in the production of prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes (LTs) and inflammation antagonism. The effects of these biologically active compounds on the immune system are associated with extended health benefits for different chronic inflammatory diseases. Studies of plant extracts and compounds show that polyphenols can play a beneficial role in the prevention and the progress of chronic diseases related to inflammation such as , obesity, neurodegeneration, cancers, and cardiovascular diseases, among other conditions.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27935899>[Algorithm for selection of individual therapy with clopidogrel in vascular surgical practice].</a></h2><p>For treatment of patients with diseases of lower limb arteries and prevention of cardiovascular complications in high-risk patients (those with , arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity) permanent antiplatelet therapy is indicated. A problem is variable individual sensitivity to therapeutic agents. For antiplatelet therapy in patients with atherosclerosis of lower limb arteries there has been obtained an evidence-supported base concerning efficacy of long-term administration of clopidogrel preparations, unlike patients with acute coronary syndrome, for whom there has been accumulated an evidence-confirmed base of administering clopidogrel preparations, as well as ticagrelor and prasugrel in various clinical situations. Clopidogrel is currently the best known representative from the group of thienopyridines. It is a pro-drug and has complicated metabolism: two-stage oxidation under the effect of isoforms of cytochrome 2C19. Its active form irreversibly inhibits binding of ADP with P2Y12 receptors of thrombocytes. This is followed by inhibition of binding of fibrinogen with the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor and a decrease of aggregation. Determining blood platelet aggregation with ADP, collagen and  forms the basis of clinical assessment of the functional state of thrombocytic activity and may be a marker of efficacy of treatment with antiaggregants. A complicated mechanism of action of clopidogrel implies individual policy of the attending physician in making a decision concerning the duration of therapy and selection of the dose. These prerequisites resulted in working out a recommended algorithm of individual dosing of clopidogrel (based on the analysis of case histories of patients with atherosclerosis of lower limb arteries by the level of platelet aggregation to a series of inducers) and correction of the dose of the drug based on the results of molecular-genetic testing of the cytochrome CYPC19 gene. The algorithm makes it possible to achieve a maximum level of efficacy and safety of treatment with antiaggregants.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29464270> modifies the role of prostanoids and potassium channels which regulate the hypereactivity of the rabbit renal artery to BNP.</a></h2><p>Diabetic nephropathy is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

The serum levels of n-6 PUFAs [dihomo-γ-linolenic  (DGLA) and  (AA)] and n-3 PUFAs (eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic ) were measured, and the estimated Δ-5 desaturase (D5D) activity was calculated based on the AA to DGLA ratio. The associations between the composition of PUFAs and obesity-related parameters, including the body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, alanine amino transferase (ALT) level, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and body fat percentage, as measured by a bioelectrical impedance analysis, were analyzed. Results Among the PUFAs, the DGLA level had the strongest correlations with BMI (p<0.001), waist circumference (p<0.001), ALT level (p<0.001), HOMA-IR (p<0.001), and body fat percentage (p<0.01).

We investigated whether obesity induced by an excess calorie, high fat diet containing hydrogenated fats, fructose, and coconut oil (HFD) altered glucose homeostasis, peripheral immunity, and urogenital microbial dynamics. We hypothesized that HFD would cause hyperglycemia, increase peripheral inflammation, and alter urogenital microbiota to favor bacterial taxonomy associated with inflammation. We utilized female Ossabaw mini-pigs to model a 'thrifty' metabolic phenotype associated with increased white adipose tissue mass. Pigs were fed HFD (~4570 kcal/pig/day) or lean (~2000 kcal/pig/day) diet for a total of 9 estrous cycles (~6 months). To determine the effect of cycle stage on cytokines and the microbiome, animals had samples collected during cycles 7 and 9 on certain days of the cycle: D1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 18. Vaginal swabs or cervical flushes assessed urogenital microbiota. Systemic fatty acids, insulin, glucose, and cytokines were analyzed. Pig weights and morphometric measurements were taken weekly. Obese pigs had increased body weight, length, heart and belly girth but similar glucose concentrations. Obese pigs had decreased cytokine levels (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-4, IL-10),  and plasma insulin, but increased levels of vaccenic . Obese pigs had greater urogenital bacterial diversity, including several taxa known for anti-inflammatory properties. Overall, induction of obesity did not induce inflammation but shifted the microbial communities within the urogenital tract to an anti-inflammatory phenotype. We postulate that the coconut oil in the HFD oil may have supported normal glucose homeostasis and modulated the immune response, possibly through regulation of microbial community dynamics and fatty  metabolism.

In order to characterize metabolic factors that affect offspring development, we profiled the metabolome of second trimester amniotic fluid (AF) from women who were subsequently diagnosed with gestational  (GDM) using a targeted metabolomics approach, profiling 459 known biochemicals through gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) assays. Using a nested case-control study design, we identified 69 total biochemicals altered by GDM exposure, while sex-specific analysis identified 44 and 58 metabolites in male and female offspring, respectively. The most significant changes were in glucose, amino , glutathione, fatty , sphingolipid, and bile  metabolism with specific changes identified based on the offspring sex. Targeted isotope dilution LC/MS confirmatory assays measured significant changes in docosahexaenoic  and . We conclude that the sex-specific alterations in GDM maternal⁻fetal metabolism may begin to explain the sex-specific metabolic outcomes seen in offspring exposed to GDM in utero.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30066055>Targeting cytochrome P450-dependent cancer cell mitochondria: cancer associated CYPs and where to find them.</a></h2><p>While cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated biosynthesis of  (AA) epoxides promotes tumor growth by driving angiogenesis, cancer cell intrinsic functions of CYPs are less understood. CYP-derived AA epoxides, called epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), also promote the growth of tumor epithelia. In cancer cells, CYP AA epoxygenase enzymes are associated with STAT3 and mTOR signaling, but also localize in mitochondria, where they promote the electron transport chain (ETC). Recently, the  drug metformin was found to inhibit CYP AA epoxygenase activity, allowing the design of more potent biguanides to target tumor growth. Biguanide inhibition of EET synthesis suppresses STAT3 and mTOR pathways, as well as the ETC. Convergence of biguanide activity and eicosanoid biology in cancer has shown a new pathway to attack cancer metabolism and provides hope for improved treatments that target this vulnerability. Inhibition of EET-mediated cancer metabolism and angiogenesis therefore provides a dual approach for targeted cancer therapeutics.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035042>Dry leaf extracts of Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) Miers attenuate oxidative stress and inflammatory condition in human monocytic (THP-1) cells.</a></h2><p>Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) Miers is known for its therapeutic value in Indian traditional medicine for treating , rheumatoid arthritis, jaundice and cardiac diseases. However, information regarding its protective role against inflammatory diseases at the molecular level is limited.The objective of the present work is to study the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect of alcoholic and water extracts of T. cordifolia (Willd.) Miers leaves in activated human monocytic THP-1 cells.Phytochemical analyses of the dry leaf extracts of T. cordifolia (Willd.) Miers prepared using the solvents alcohol (TCAE) or water (TCWE) are performed employing spectrophotometric methods for estimating total phenolic and flavonoid content, and the plant material was authenticated by detecting T. cordifolia (Willd.) Miers metabolite biomarkers using LC-MS/MS.  (AA)- and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated human monocytic (THP-1) cells were used as experimental models to investigate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of the plant extracts.  (AA)-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) in THP-1 cells were monitored by confocal microscopy/spectrofluorimetry and transcript of antioxidant enzyme catalase (CAT), by quantitative real time PCR. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced proinflammatory marker like TNF-α at transcription and protein levels in THP-1 cells were measured by quantitative real-time PCR or ELISA respectively. Further, the effect of T. cordifolia (Willd.) Miers extracts on LPS-induced NF-κB translocation, and IκB and P-IκB protein levels, were studied by immunoblotting and confocal microscopy.T. cordifolia (Willd.) Miers extracts exhibited significant amounts of total phenolic and flavonoid content, and LC-MS/MS analyses detected tinosponone, a TC-specific clerodane-derived diterpene. Both types of extracts attenuated AA-induced ROS generation via enhancing catalase enzyme activity in THP-1 cells. Real time PCR and ELISA experiments revealed that the elevated levels of LPS-induced TNF-α was remarkably attenuated in THP-1 cells pretreated with T. cordifolia (Willd.) Miers extracts. Western blot and confocal microscopy showed that the alcoholic extract's anti-inflammatory activity by attenuating NF-κB translocation into the nucleus in LPS-activated THP-1 cells via the inhibition of IκB degradation in the cytosol.Our findings suggest that T. cordifolia (Willd.) Miers dry leaf extracts possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties via upregulation of antioxidant enzymes and attenuation of NF- κB nuclear translocation in activated human monocytic (THP-1) cells, therefore the present study supports our proposed molecular basis for the traditional use of T. cordifolia (Willd.)

Recruitment of foamy monocytes to the inflamed endothelium contributes to the development of atherosclerotic lesions. In this work, we investigated the potential role of AA stored in the neutral lipids of foamy monocytes to be cleaved by lipases and contribute to lipid mediator signaling. To this end, we used mass spectrometry-based lipidomic approaches combined with strategies to generate monocytes with different concentrations of AA. Results from our experiments indicate that the phospholipid AA pool in monocytes is stable and does not change upon exposure of the cells to the external AA. On the contrary, the AA pool in triacylglycerol is expandable and can accommodate relatively large amounts of fatty . Stimulation of the cells with opsonized zymosan results in the expected decreases of cellular AA. Under all conditions examined, all of the AA decreases observed in stimulated cells were accounted for by decreases in the phospholipid pool; we failed to detect any contribution of the triacylglycerol pool to the response. Experiments utilizing selective inhibitors of phospholipid or triacylglyerol hydrolysis confirmed that the phospholipid pool is the sole contributor of the AA liberated by stimulated cells. Thus, the AA in the triacylglycerol is not a source of free AA for the lipid mediator signaling during stimulation of human foamy monocytes and may be used for other cellular functions.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27860326>Docosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic  are positively associated with insulin sensitivity in rats fed high-fat and high-fructose diets.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study was to compare insulin resistance and metabolic changes using a global lipidomic approach.Rats were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or a high-fructose diet (HFrD) for 12 weeks to induce insulin resistance (IR) syndrome. After 12 weeks feeding, physiological and biochemical parameters were examined. Insulin sensitivity and plasma metabolites were evaluated using a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp and mass spectrometry, respectively. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to investigate the strength of correlations.Rats on both diets developed IR syndrome, characterized by hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hyperinsulinemia, impaired fasting glucose, and IR. Compared with HFrD-fed rats, non-esterified fatty acids were lower and body weight and plasma insulin levels were markedly higher in HFD-fed rats. Adiposity and plasma leptin levels were increased in both groups. However, the size of adipocytes was greater in HFD- than HFrD-fed rats. Notably, the lipidomic heat map revealed metabolites exhibiting greater differences in HFD- and HFrD-fed rats compared with controls. Plasma adrenic  levels were higher in HFD- than HFrD-fed rats. Nevertheless, linoleic and  levels decreased in HFrD-fed rats compared with controls. Plasma concentrations of docosapentaenoic  (DPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) were significantly reduced after feeding of both diets, particularly the HFrD. There was a strong positive correlation between these two fatty acids and the insulin sensitivity index.The systemic lipidomic analysis indicated that a reduction in DHA and DPA was strongly correlated with IR in rats under long-term overnutrition. These results provide a potential therapeutic target for IR and metabolic syndrome.© 2016 Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29080699>Therapeutic potential of omega-3 fatty -derived epoxyeicosanoids in cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases.</a></h2><p>Numerous benefits have been attributed to dietary long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LC-PUFAs), including protection against cardiac arrhythmia, triglyceride-lowering, amelioration of inflammatory, and neurodegenerative disorders. This review covers recent findings indicating that a variety of these beneficial effects are mediated by "omega-3 epoxyeicosanoids", a class of novel n-3 LC-PUFA-derived lipid mediators, which are generated via the cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenase pathway. CYP enzymes, previously identified as  (20:4n-6; AA) epoxygenases, accept eicosapentaenoic  (20:5n-3; EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (22:6n-3; DHA), the major fish oil n-3 LC-PUFAs, as efficient alternative substrates. In humans and rodents, dietary EPA/DHA supplementation causes a profound shift of the endogenous CYP-eicosanoid profile from AA- to EPA- and DHA-derived metabolites, increasing, in particular, the plasma and tissue levels of 17,18-epoxyeicosatetraenoic  (17,18-EEQ) and 19,20-epoxydocosapentaenoic  (19,20-EDP). Based on preclinical studies, these omega-3 epoxyeicosanoids display cardioprotective, vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory, and anti-allergic properties that contribute to the beneficial effects of n-3 LC-PUFAs in diverse disease conditions ranging from cardiac disease, bronchial disorders, and intraocular neovascularization, to allergic intestinal inflammation and inflammatory pain. Increasing evidence also suggests that background nutrition as well as genetic and disease state-related factors could limit the response to EPA/DHA-supplementation by reducing the formation and/or enhancing the degradation of omega-3 epoxyeicosanoids. Recently, metabolically robust synthetic analogs mimicking the biological activities of 17,18-EEQ have been developed. These drug candidates may overcome limitations of dietary EPA/DHA supplementation and provide novel options for the treatment of cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Mounting evidence has shown that 12-LOX plays a critical role in the modulation of inflammation at multiple checkpoints during  development.

The essence of the microinflammatory state is the innate immune response, which is central to the occurrence and development of DN. Members of the inflammasome family, including both "receptors" and "regulators", are key to the inflammatory immune response. Nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) and other inflammasome components are able to detect endogenous danger signals, resulting in activation of caspase-1 as well as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-18 and other cytokines; these events stimulate the inflammatory cascade reaction, which is crucial for DN. Hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia and hyperuricaemia can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, which then mediates the occurrence and development of DN through the K channel model, the lysosomal damage model and the active oxygen cluster model. In this review, we survey the involvement of the NLRP3 inflammasome in various signalling pathways and highlight different aspects of their influence on DN. We also explore the important effects of the NLRP3 inflammasome on kidney function and structural changes that occur during DN development and progression. It is becoming more evident that NLRP3 inflammasome targeting has therapeutic potential for the treatment of DN.Copyright © 2016. Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p></html>
