We hypothesized that unsaturated FA could alleviate saturated FA-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress occurring in intestinal secretory goblet cells, and consequently the reduced synthesis and secretion of mucins that form the protective mucus barrier. To investigate this hypothesis, we treated well-differentiated human colonic LS174T goblet cells with  (PAL)-the most commonly used inducer of lipotoxicity in in vitro systems-or -9, -6, or -3 unsaturated fatty acids alone or in co-treatment with PAL, and measured the impact of such treatments on ER stress and Muc2 production. Our results showed that only eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids protect goblet cells against ER stress-mediated altered Muc2 secretion induced by PAL, whereas neither linolenic  nor -9 and -6 FA are able to provide such protection. We conclude that EPA and DHA could represent potential therapeutic nutrients against the detrimental lipotoxicity of saturated fatty acids, associated with type 2 diabetes and  or inflammatory bowel disease.

Rose hips have long been used to treat kidney stones, gastroenteric ailments, hypertension and respiratory problems such as bronchitis, cough and cold.This review is focused on the ethnopharmacological uses of rose hip as well as phytochemical and pharmacological aspects.Ethno-medical uses of rose hip have been recorded in many countries since a long time. Approximately, 129 chemical compounds have been isolated and identified from rose hip. This fruit contains some major active components such as flavonoids, tannins, anthocyanin, phenolic compounds, fatty oil, organic acids and inorganic compounds. Scientific studies have suggested a wide range of pharmacological activities for rose hip including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-, anti-cancer, hepatoprotective, nephroprotective, cardioprotective, antiaging, anti H. pylori, neuroprotective and antinociceptive activities. In particular, the rose hip powder and extract have been reported to exert therapeutic effects on arthritis.Some of the ethnomedical indications of rose hip, such as nephroprotective and gastroproetctive actions, have been confirmed by preclinical pharmacological studies. Additional investigations on the pharmacological effects of rose hip as well as evidence from randomized controlled trials are essential to assess the therapeutic value of this natural product.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29270130>Polymorphism  in the  Gene Is Associated to Changes in Fatty  Metabolism and Circulating Endocannabinoid Levels Distinctively in Normal Weight and Obese Subjects.</a></h2><p>The multifunctional CD36 scavenger receptor facilitates fatty  (FA) uptake and oxidation and it has been involved in the pathophysiology related to dysfunctional FA metabolism. The common variant in the  gene,  (A/G), whose allele A is characterized by a reduced protein expression, has been associated with taste sensitivity to and preference for fat. We therefore aimed at evaluating whether the  polymorphism may influence fatty  metabolism and endocannabinoid biosynthesis in normal weight (NW) and obese (OB) subjects. Red blood cell (RBC) fatty  composition, and plasma endocannabinoid levels were determined. In NW subjects with AA genotype was found a marked reduction of RBC saturated fatty acids and /linoleic ratio (PA/LA), considered as  lipogenesis (DNL) biomarkers. Remarkably, to the reduction of DNL biomarkers corresponded an increase of omega-6 index, an indirect marker of the impact on fatty  metabolism of dietary omega-6 fatty acids, endocannabinoid levels and a higher waist/hip ratio. The presence of the G allele was instead associated with increased endocannabinoid plasma levels and a trend for increased waist/hip ratio in obese subjects, even though exhibited decreased BMI with respect to those with AA genotype. These data indicate that the  polymorphism, , leads to a distinct metabolic pattern in NW and in OB subjects. Therefore, their determination may be crucial in developing personalized therapeutic strategies for ameliorating dyslipidemia and other metabolic disorders.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31472681>Curcumin protects against -induced apoptosis via the inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress in testicular Leydig cells.</a></h2><p> (PA) is a common saturated fatty  that induces apoptosis in various types of cells, including testicular Leydig cells. There is evidence suggesting that PA is increased in patients with  and that PA-induced cell apoptosis may play an important role in -related male infertility. Curcumin, a natural polyphenol, has been reported to exert cytoprotective effects in various cell types. However, the cytoprotective effect of curcumin against PA-induced apoptosis in Leydig cells remains unknown. Therefore, the current study was performed to investigate the protective effects of curcumin in response to PA-induced toxicity and apoptosis in murine Leydig tumor cell line 1 (MLTC-1) cells and explore the mechanism underlying its anti-apoptotic action.MLTC-1 cells were cultured in Roswell Park Institute-1640 medium and divided into five groups. First four groups were treated with 50-400 μM PA, 400 μM PA + 5-40 μM curcumin, 400 μM PA + 500 nM 4-phenylbutyric  (4-PBA, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inhibitor), and 500 nM thapsigargin (TG, an ER stress inducer) + 20 μM curcumin, respectively, followed by incubation for 24 h. Effects of PA and/or curcumin on viability, apoptosis, and ER stress in MLTC-1 cells were then determined by cell proliferation assay, flow cytometry, and western blot analysis. The fifth group of MLTC-1 cells was exposed to 400 μM of PA and 5 IU/mL of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) for 24 h in the absence and presence of curcumin, followed by measurement of testosterone levels in cell-culture supernatants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD) were treated with or without curcumin for 4 weeks, and the testosterone levels were detected by ELISA.Exposure to 100-400 μM PA reduced cell viability, activated caspase 3, and enhanced the expression levels of the apoptosis-related protein BCL-2-associated X protein (BAX) and ER stress markers glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) in MLTC-1 cells. Treating cells with 500 nM 4-PBA significantly attenuated PA-induced cytotoxicity through inhibition of ER stress. Curcumin (20 μM) significantly suppressed PA- or TG-induced decrease in cell viability, caspase 3 activity, and the expression levels of BAX, CHOP, and GRP78. In addition, treating MLTC-1 cells with 20 μM curcumin effectively restored testosterone levels, which were reduced in response to PA exposure. Similarly, curcumin treatment ameliorated the HFD-induced decrease in serum testosterone level in vivo.The present study suggests that PA induces apoptosis via ER stress and curcumin ameliorates PA-induced apoptosis by inhibiting ER stress in MLTC-1 cells. This study suggests the application of curcumin as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of -related male infertility.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31485221>Compound C Protects Mice from HFD-Induced  and Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of compound C on an in vivo mouse model of high-fat diet- (HFD-) induced  and hepatosteatosis.C57BL/6 mice were fed with a standard diet ( = 5) for 16 weeks and then injected saline once a day for 4 weeks as the normal chow group. Mice ( = 10) were fed with HFD for 16 weeks to induce  and hepatosteatosis and then divided into two groups: HFD + vehicle group injected with the vehicle solution (saline) and HFD + compound C group injected with compound C in saline (5 mg/kg i.p., once a day) for 4 weeks. Liver histology was observed. The expression levels of genes related to lipid metabolism and proinflammation in liver tissue were examined. NLRP3 inflammasome expression in liver tissue was detected by the western blot assay. HepG2 cells were pretreated with compound C and/or AICAR for 1 h and then treated with  (PA) for 3 h. The cells were collected, and mRNA levels were determined.There was a significant reduction in body-weight gain and daily food intake in the HFD + compound C group compared with the HFD + vehicle group ( < 0.05). The glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT) showed that compound C alleviated insulin resistance. Histology analysis showed a significant reduction of hepatic steatosis by compound C. Compound C also significantly decreased fatty  synthesis genes, while increased fatty  oxidation genes. Furthermore, compound C significantly reduced the expression of proinflammatory markers and NLRP3 inflammasome ( < 0.05). Compound C enhanced mRNA levels of SOD1, SOD2, catalase, GPx1, and GPx4 and reduced the p-AMPK/AMPK ratio, which were stimulated by  (PA). The effect was enhanced by AICAR.Our data suggest that compound C is a potent NAFLD suppressor and an attractive therapeutic target for hepatic steatosis and related metabolic disorders.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29158770>Does the enterolactone (ENL) affect fatty  transporters and lipid metabolism in liver?</a></h2><p>NAFLD as a result of inappropriate diet and , may progress to sever conditions such as: type 2 diabetes mellitus or steatohepatitis, and has recently become a prevalent topic of numerous investigations. Due to its dangerous aftermaths, finding new substances, such as polyphenols and their derivatives, which might reduce liver steatosis is the main target of research into NAFLD treatment. Hence, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect(s) of enterolactone (ENL), a metabolite of secoisolariciresinol (SECO), on lipid metabolism together with changes in the expression of fatty  transporters in fatty liver.The experiments were conducted on HepG2 cells incubated with either ENL and/or  during 16 h exposure. The expression of selected fatty  transport proteins: FATP2, FATP5, CD36, FABPpm, ABCA1, MTP, ACBP and L-FABP, as well as the proteins directly involved in lipogenesis (FAS), oxidation pathway (CPT 1), and lipid metabolism (PPARα, LXR, SREBP1c, pAMPK) was estimated by Western Blot. Intra and extracellular lipid contents were assessed by Gas-Liquid Chromatography. The data was analyzed with two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and results were considered to be statistically significant at  ≤ 0.05.ENL stimulated extracellular efflux of free fatty acids (FFA) and triacylglicerols (TAG) to the medium, while, it had no influence on FATP-family mediated intracellular fatty  uptake. Moreover, ENL decreased the expression of CPT 1, pAMPK, PPARα, increased SREBP1c and had no effect on LXR, and FAS content.The findings of our study demonstrate that ENL had opposite effect on liver steatosis in comparison with other polyphenols what suggests that it may be an inactive metabolite. ENL did not affect significantly the intracellular accumulation of FFA, DAG and TAG, yet it promoted their extracellular efflux. Furthermore, it inhibited ß-oxydation and intracellular lipid metabolism what may contribute to the progression of NAFLD.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31405384>Preliminary evidence for reduced adipose tissue inflammation in vegetarians compared with omnivores.</a></h2><p>There are links between  and inflammation that may relate activation of pro-inflammatory pathways by dietary factors. Because dietary fat intake of vegetarians is thought to be more beneficial than that of omnivores, we hypothesized that obese vegetarians would have less adipose tissue inflammation and lower intramyocellular ceramide concentrations than equally obese omnivores.Eight obese vegetarian (1 male) and 8 obese omnivore volunteers (1 male) completed a Food Frequency Questionnaire, underwent body composition measures, subcutaneous adipose tissue and muscle biopsies. We used immunohistochemistry to measure adipose macrophage (ATM) and senescent cells. Plasma free fatty  (FFA), adipose FA and muscle ceramide profiles were measured using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Student t tests were used for the comparison of primary outcomes; univariate regression analysis was used to test for associations between dietary patterns and ATMs (secondary analysis).There were no differences in age (38 ± 8 vs. 39 ± 8 years), BMI (32.2 ± 2.6 vs. 33.3 ± 1.9 kg/m) or percent body fat (44 ± 8 vs. 45 ± 4) between the vegetarians and omnivores. Vegetarians consumed 42% (P = 0.02) less saturated fat and 50% (P = 0.04) less cholesterol than the omnivores. Plasma FFA of vegetarians had lesser proportions of  (24 ± 3 vs. 29 ± 4%, P = 0.02) and vegetarians had fewer femoral pro-inflammatory ATMs than omnivores (3.6 ± 2.8 vs. 7.9 ± 4.4 per 100 adipocytes, respectively; P = 0.02). Omnivores had 50% greater (P = 0.01) expression of TNF mRNA in abdominal fat. We found no significant between group differences in muscle ceramide concentrations.Although the sample size is small, these results may indicate that dietary patterns play a role in adipose tissue inflammation, as reflected by reduced number of femoral ATMs in obese vegetarians than obese omnivores.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913535> causes insulin resistance in granulosa cells via activation of JNK.</a></h2><p> is a worldwide health problem with rising incidence and results in reproductive difficulties. Elevated saturated free fatty acids (FFAs) in  can cause insulin resistance (IR) in peripheral tissues. The high intra-follicular saturated FFAs may also account for IR in ovarian granulosa cells (GCs). In the present study, we investigated the relationship between saturated FFAs and IR in GCs by the use of  (PA). We demonstrated that the glucose uptake in cultured GCs and lactate accumulation in the culture medium were stimulated by insulin, but the effects of insulin were attenuated by PA treatment. Besides, insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt was reduced by PA in a dose and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, PA increased phosphorylation of JNK and JNK blockage rescued the phosphorylation of Akt which was down-regulated by PA.

Impairment in the functions of ER occurs in a variety of nutritive disorders including  and type 2 diabetes. Here, we hypothesize that (scopoletin) SPL, a coumarin, has the potential to alleviate ER stress induced in vitro and in vivo models by lipotoxicity. To test this hypothesis, the ability of SPL to restore the levels of proteins of ER stress was analyzed. Rat insulinoma 5f (RIN5f) cells and Sprague Dawley rats were the models used for this study. Groups of control and high-fat, high-fructose diet (HFFD)-fed rats were treated with either SPL or 4-phenylbutyric . Status of ER stress was enumerated by quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot, electron microscopic, and immunohistochemical studies. Proximal proteins of ER stress inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), protein kinase like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) were reduced in the β-cells by SPL. The subsequent signaling proteins X-box binding protein 1, eukaryotic initiation factor2α, activating transcription factor 4, and C/EBP homologous protein were also suppressed in their expression levels when treated with SPL. IRE1, PERK signaling leads to c-Jun-N-terminal kinases phosphorylation, a kinase that interrupts insulin signaling, which was also reverted upon scopoletin treatment. Finally, we confirm that SPL has the ability to suppress the stress proteins and limit pancreatic ER stress which might help in delaying the progression of insulin resistance.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30816667>The Mitochondria-Targeted Antioxidant MitoQ Modulates Mitochondrial Function and Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Pancreatic β Cells Exposed to Hyperglycaemia.</a></h2><p>Mitochondria-targeted antioxidants such as mitoquinone (MitoQ) have demonstrated protective effects against oxidative damage in several diseases. The increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production during glucose metabolism in β cells can be exacerbated under hyperglycaemic conditions such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), thus contributing to β cell function impairment. In the present work, we aimed to evaluate the effect of MitoQ on insulin secretion, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) signalling in a pancreatic β cell line under normoglycaemic (NG, 11.1 mM glucose), hyperglycaemic (HG, 25 mM glucose) and lipidic ( (PA), 0.5mM) conditions.We incubated the pancreatic β cell line INS-1E with or without MitoQ (0.5µM) under NG, HG and PA conditions. We then assessed the following parameters: glucose-induced insulin secretion, O₂ consumption (with a Clark-type electrode); mitochondrial function, oxidative stress parameters and calcium levels (by fluorescence microscopy); ER stress markers and NFκB-p65 protein levels (by western blotting).MitoQ increased insulin secretion and prevented the enhancement of ROS production and O₂ consumption and decrease in GSH levels that are characteristic under HG conditions. MitoQ also reduced protein levels of ER stress markers (GRP78 and P-eIF2α) and the proinflammatory nuclear transcription factor NFκB-p65, both of which increased under HG. MitoQ did not significantly alter ER stress markers under lipidic conditions.Our findings suggest that treatment with MitoQ modulates mitochondrial function, which in turn ameliorates endoplasmic reticulum stress and NFκB activation, thereby representing potential benefits for pancreatic β cell function.© Copyright by the Author(s).

Fasting blood glucose and insulin and the expression of podocin, nephrin, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), glucose transporter type (Glut4), and microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) were assayed. Glomerular morphology and podocyte foot structure were evaluated by periodic -Schiff staining and electron microscopy. Podocytes were treated with 150 nM GLP-1 and incubated with 400 μM  (PA) for 12 h. The effect on autophagy was assessed by podocyte-specific Glut4 siRNA. Insulin resistance and autophagy were assayed by immunofluorescence and Western blotting. The high-fat diet resulted in weight gain, ectopic glomerular lipid accumulation, increased insulin resistance, and fusion of podophyte foot processes. The decreased translocation of Glut4 to the plasma membrane and excess autophagy seen in mice fed a high-fat diet and in PA-treated cultured podocytes were attenuated by GLP-1. Podocyte-specific Glut4 siRNA promoted autophagy, and rapamycin-enhanced autophagy worsened the podocyte injury caused by PA. Excess autophagy in podocytes was induced by inhibition of Glut4 translocation to the plasma membrane and was involved in the pathology of ORG. GLP-1 restored insulin sensitivity and ameliorated renal injury by decreasing the level of autophagy.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30006154>GCN2 deficiency protects against high fat diet induced hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in mice.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by hepatic lipid deposition and oxidative stress. It has been demonstrated that general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) is required to maintain hepatic fatty  homeostasis under conditions of amino  deprivation. However, the impact of GCN2 on the development of NAFLD has not been investigated. In this study, we used Gcn2 mice to investigate the effect of GCN2 on high fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis. After HFD feeding for 12 weeks, Gcn2 mice were less obese than wild-type (WT) mice, and Gcn2 significantly attenuated HFD-induced liver dysfunction, hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. In the livers of the HFD-fed mice, GCN2 deficiency resulted in higher levels of lipolysis genes, lower expression of genes related to FA synthesis, transport and lipogenesis, and less induction of oxidative stress. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of GCN2 attenuated, whereas overexpression of GCN2 exacerbated, -induced steatosis, oxidative & ER stress, and changes of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), fatty  synthase (FAS) and metallothionein (MT) expression in HepG2 cells. Collectively, our data provide evidences that GCN2 deficiency protects against HFD-induced hepatic steatosis by inhibiting lipogenesis and reducing oxidative stress.

Breast milk samples from 30 lean (BMI=19-23) and 23 obese (BMI>30) women were collected 72h postpartum. Adipose tissue and milk samples were harvested from C57BL/6J mice. FAHFA lipid profiles were measured using reverse phase and chiral liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method. PAHSA regioisomers as well as other FAHFAs were present in both human and murine milk. Unexpectedly, the levels of 5-PAHSA were higher relative to other regioisomers. The separation of both regioisomers and enantiomers of PAHSAs revealed that both R- and S-enantiomers were present in the biological samples, and that the majority of the 5-PAHSA signal is of R configuration. Total PAHSA levels were positively associated with weight gain during pregnancy, and 5-PAHSA as well as total PAHSA levels were significantly lower in the milk of the obese compared to the lean mothers. Our results document for the first time the presence of lipid mediators from the FAHFA family in breast milk, while giving an insight into the stereochemistry of PAHSAs.

The current study aimed to investigate the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 5 (MKP-5) in islet cells under glucolipotoxic conditions. Using gene overexpression and knockdown approaches, we demonstrated that MKP-5 could alleviate glucolipotoxicity-induced apoptosis via the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial apoptosis pathways owing to the altered regulation of caspase family members and ER stress-related molecules in MIN6 and primary islet cells. Overexpression of MKP-5 reversed the glucose and  (GP)-induced impairment of insulin secretion as well as the abnormal decreases in the expression of islet functional genes, thereby maintaining the normal insulin secretory functionality, whereas the absence of MKP-5 aggravated islet cell dysfunction. In parallel, the production of ROS and increased inflammation-associated genes in response to GP were also reduced upon MKP-5 overexpression. Further, inhibition of JNK or P38 MAPK pathways resisted to glucolipotoxicity observed in MKP-5 knockdown MIN6 cells. These findings indicate that MKP-5 is an important mediator for glucolipotoxicity-induced islet cell dysfunction and apoptosis, with JNK and P38 as the critical downstream pathways.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Emerging evidence highlights the importance of directly elucidating T-cell activation under the -induced metabolic stress condition, as T cells primed under such conditions were found to acquire a unique phenotype and function. Herein, we found a significant upregulation of signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family member 3 (SLAMF3) expression on T cells from T2D patients compared to those of healthy controls. Importantly, SLAMF3 upregulation was associated with an increased ability to produce proinflammatory cytokines. Significantly increased SLAMF3 expression was seen in T2D patient T cells that produce IFN-γ or IL-17 upon short (4-h) stimulation, compared to non-cytokine-producing T cells. In line with this finding, SLAMF3 T cells were significantly more sensitive than SLAMF3 T cells to TCR stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies. Furthermore, treatment with  (PA) led to significant upregulation of SLAMF3 on human T cells primed by anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies and on Jurkat cells, a human T-cell line. RNA sequencing revealed strong activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in T cells that were primed with PA. Further mechanistic studies showed that inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling, or its upstream mediator STAT5 can prevent PA-induced SLAMF3 upregulation on T cells. These results indicate that SLAMF3 upregulation is associated with T-cell activation and cytokine production in T2D patients, and suggest that elevated saturated fatty acids in T2D patients may induce SLAMF3 upregulation on T cells via activation of the STAT5-PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29631603>Heat shock protein 70 promotes lipogenesis in HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>The increasing prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has followed the international rise in  rates.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of NR on inflammation and mitochondrial biogenesis in AML12 mouse hepatocytes.A subset of hepatocytes was treated with  (PA; 250 µM) for 48 h to induce hepatocyte steatosis. The hepatocytes were treated with NR (10 µM and 10 mM) for 24 h with and without PA. The cell viability and the levels of sirtuins, inflammatory markers, and mitochondrial markers were analyzed.Cytotoxicity of NR was examined by PrestoBlue assay. Exposure to NR had no effect on cell viability or morphology. Gene expression of sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) and Sirt3 was significantly upregulated by NR in PA-treated hepatocytes. However, Sirt1 activities were increased in hepatocytes treated with low-dose NR.

Oocyte maturation under these lipotoxic conditions results in increased oxidative stress levels, mitochondrial dysfunction, reduced developmental competence and disappointing IVF results.A well-described bovine oocyte IVM model was used, where a pathophysiologically relevant elevated FF concentrations of  (PA; 150 μM or 300 μM) were added to induce oxidative stress. After fertilization (Day 0, D0), zygotes were in vitro cultured (IVC, from D1 to D8) in standard fatty -free media in the presence or absence of Mitoquinone or its carrier triphenyl-phosphonium.Embryo cleavage and fragmentation (D2) and blastocyst rates (D8) were recorded. Mitochondrial activity and oxidative stress in cleaved embryos at D2 were determined using specific fluorogenic probes and confocal microscopy. D8 blastocysts were used to (i) examine the expression of marker genes related to mitochondrial unfolded protein responses (UPRmt; HSPD1 and HSPE1), mitochondrial biogenesis (TFAM), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) UPR (ATF4, ATF6 and BiP) and oxidative stress (CAT, GPX1 and SOD2) using real time RT-PCR; (ii) determine cell differentiation and apoptosis using CDX-2 and cleaved caspase-3 immunostaining; and (iii) measure mtDNA copy numbers. This was tested in a series of experiments with at least three independent replicates for each, using a total of 2525 oocytes. Differences were considered significant if a P value was <0.05 after Bonferroni correction.Exposure to PA during IVM followed by culture under control conditions resulted in a significant increase in oxidative stress in embryos at D2. This was associated with a significant reduction in mitochondrial inner membrane potential (uncoupling) compared with solvent control (P < 0.05). The magnitude of these effects was PA-concentration dependent. Consequently, development to the blastocysts stage was significantly hampered. Surviving blastocysts exhibited high apoptotic cell indices and upregulated mRNA expression indicating persistent oxidative stress, mitochondrial and ER UPRs. In contrast, supplementation of PA-derived zygotes with Mitoquinone during IVC (i) prevented mitochondrial uncoupling and alleviated oxidative stress at D2; and (ii) rescued blastocyst quality; normalized oxidative stress and UPR related genes and apoptotic cell indices (P > 0.01 compared with solvent control). Mitoquinone also improved blastocyst rate in PA-exposed groups, an effect that was dependent on PA concentration.N/A.This is a fundamental study performed using a bovine in vitro model using PA-induced lipotoxicity during oocyte maturation. PA is the most predominant FFA in the FF that is known to induce lipotoxicity; however, in vivo maturation in patients suffering from maternal metabolic disorders involve more factors that cannot be represented in one model. Nevertheless, focusing on the carryover oxidative stress as a known key factor affecting developmental competence, and considering the novel beneficial rescuing effects of Mitoquinone shown here, we believe this model is of high biological relevance.Human oocytes collected for IVF treatments from patients with maternal metabolic disorders are vulnerable to lipotoxicity and oxidative stress during in vivo maturation. The results shown here suggest that mitochondrial targeted therapy, such as using Mitoquinone, during IVC may rescue the developmental competence and quality of these compromised oocytes. After further clinical trials, this may be a valuable approach to increase IVF success rates for infertile patients experiencing metabolic disorders.This study was financially supported by a BOF/KP grant number 34399, from the University of Antwerp, Belgium.

Our aim was to determine concomitant changes in thrombin generation in the blood compartment and at the surface of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and its interplay with adipokines, free fatty acids (FFA), and metalloproteinases (MMPs) in obese Zucker rats that share features of the human MetS.  Obese and age-matched lean Zucker rats were compared at 25 and 80 weeks of age. Thrombin generation was assessed by calibrated automated thrombography (CAT).  Endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) was increased in obese rats independent of platelets and age. Clot half-lysis time was delayed with  and age. Interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-13 were increased with  and age respectively. Addition of exogenous fibrinogen, leptin, linoleic, or  increased thrombin generation in plasma whereas adiponectin had an opposite effect. ETP was increased at the surface of VSMCs from obese rats and addition of exogenous  further enhanced ETP values. Gelatinase activity was increased in aorta at both ages in obese rats and MMP-2 activity was increased in VSMCs from obese rats.  Our study demonstrated in MetS an early prothrombotic phenotype of the blood compartment reinforced by procoagulant properties of dedifferentiated and inflammatory VSMCs. Mechanisms involved (1) increased fibrinogen and impaired fibrinolysis and (2) increased saturated fatty acids responsible for additive procoagulant effects. Whether specifically targeting this hypercoagulability using direct thrombin inhibitors would improve outcome in MetS is worth investigating.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31462902>Early and reversible changes to the hippocampal proteome in mice on a high-fat diet.</a></h2><p>The rise in global  makes it crucial to understand how diet drives -related health conditions, such as premature cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD hippocampal-dependent episodic memory is one of the first types of memory to be impaired. Previous studies have shown that in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) episodic memory is rapidly but reversibly impaired.In this study we use hippocampal proteomics to investigate the effects of HFD in the hippocampus. Mice were fed either a low-fat diet (LFD) or HFD containing either 10% or 60% (Kcal) from fat for 3 days, 1 week or 2 weeks. One group of mice were fed the HFD for 1 week and then returned to the LFD for a further week. Primary hippocampal cultures were challenged with  (PA), the most common long-chain saturated FA in the Western diet, and with the anti-inflammatory, n-3 polyunsaturated FA, docosahexaenoic  (DHA), or a combination of the two to ascertain effects of these fatty acids on dendritic structure.HFD-induced changes occur in hippocampal proteins involved in metabolism, inflammation, cell stress, cell signalling, and the cytoskeleton after 3 days, 1 week and 2 weeks of HFD. Replacement of the HFD after 1 week by a low-fat diet (LFD) for a further week resulted in partial recovery of the hippocampal proteome. Microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), one of the earliest proteins changed, was used to investigate the impact of fatty acids (FAs) on hippocampal neuronal morphology. PA challenge resulted in shorter and less arborised dendrites while DHA had no effect when applied alone but counteracted the effects of PA when FAs were used in combination. Dendritic morphology recovered when PA was removed from the cell culture media.This study provides evidence for the rapid and reversible effects of diet on the hippocampal proteome and the impact of PA and DHA on dendritic structure.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30263011>MiR27a Promotes the Development of Macrophage-like Characteristics in 3T3-L1 Preadipocytes.</a></h2><p>Recruitment and polarization of classically activated (M1) macrophages within adipose tissue contribute to chronic low-grade inflammation in . Adipose tissue precursor cells exhibit the capacity to develop macrophage-like characteristics and adipocyte-derived miR27a is known to promote reprogramming of somatic cells. It was unknown whether exogenous addition of miR27a promote the development of macrophage-like characteristics of adipose precursor cells. We examined macrophage surface antigen, phagocytosis and migration ability in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes transfected with miR27a mimics. Transfection of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with miR27a mimics increased phagocytosis and migration and increased the number of cells expressing the macrophage makers F4/80 and MHC compared to controls. M2 and CD206 macrophage markers were unaltered. In addition, transfection of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with miR27a mimics reduced PPARγ expression, activated NF-κB and promoted secretion of the inflammatory cytokines MCP-1, TNF-α and IL-1β compared to controls. The level of anti-inflammatory factors Arg-1, IL-10, Ym1 and Fizz1 were unaltered. Secretion of miR27a was increased in conditioned medium prepared from -treated differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes compared to controls. Incubation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with this conditioned medium increased phagocytosis and migration compared to controls. Finally, conditioned medium prepared from differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes transfection with miR27a inhibitors reduced phagocytosis and migration in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes compared to controls. The data indicate that PPARγ agonists may reverse the activation of NF-κB pathway mediated by miR27a overexpression and reduce phagocytosis and migration of adipose precursor cells.

Preclinical studies on recently discovered classes of lipids - fatty  esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFA) have revealed their anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing potential. The FAHFA levels are significantly decreased in insulin-resistant individuals, their application exhibited anti-inflammatory effects and restoring the glucose-insulin homeostasis. The aim of our research was to analyze the overall FAHFA composition in a common diet, as only a partial FAHFA composition has been revealed so far (only the PAHSA subclass was analyzed in a few foods). A new approach to the FAHFAs analysis includes nano-LC and post-column modifier followed by negative ion mass spectrometry, in order to obtain maximum sensitivity. Analysis of different foods - oat (whole grain, coarse flakes and fine flakes), apple, clementine, lemon, strawberry, blueberry, mango, kiwi, avocado, pineapple, banana, onion, garlic, cherry tomato, carrot, parsley root, pepper and radish - exhibited wide inter-food variation in the FAHFA profiles. Sixteen analyzed FAHFAs (, oleic, palmitoleic and stearic hydroxy-esters) showed microgram to low nanogram levels (0.165 ng/g - 32 μg/g FW), with the highest abundancy in oat, clementine, garlic and pineapple. Stearic  hydroxy stearic  (SAHSA) was the most abundant FAHFA, especially in the food with antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and beneficial metabolic effects. In contrary, the PAHSA - previously proven to have the strongest antihyperglycemic and insulin-sensitizing effects, was not present in some foods (radish, avocado, mango, lemon, cherry tomato, kiwi). Our study proves the importance of overall FAHFA analysis in food (especially in a functional food), because of their potential metabolic benefits and possible future incorporation in special diets.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29798686>Effects of saturated  and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on Sertoli cell apoptosis.</a></h2><p> is believed to negatively affect male semen quality and is accompanied by dysregulation of free fatty  (FFA) metabolism in plasma. However, the implication of dysregulated FFA on semen quality and the involvement of Sertoli cells remain unclear. In the present study, we report  decreased Sertoli cell viability through dysregulated FFAs. We observed an increased rate of apoptosis in Sertoli cells, accompanied with elevated FFA levels, in the testes of obese mice that were provided a high-fat diet (HFD). Moreover, the levels of reactive oxygen species were elevated. Furthermore, we demonstrated by in vitro assays that saturated  (PA), which is the most common saturated FFA in plasma, led to decreased cell viability of TM4 Sertoli cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. A similar finding was noted in primary mouse Sertoli cells. In contrast to saturated FFA, omega-3 (ω-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) protected Sertoli cells from PA-induced lipotoxicity at the physiologically relevant levels. These results indicated that the lipotoxicity of saturated fatty acids might be the cause of -induced Sertoli cell apoptosis, which leads to decreased semen quality.

Parkin-related mitophagy sustains mitochondrial homeostasis and hepatocyte viability. However, the contribution and regulatory mechanisms of Parkin-related mitophagy in NAFLD are incompletely understood. Macrophage stimulating 1 (Mst1) is a novel mitophagy upstream regulator which excerbates heart and cancer apoptosisn via repressing mitophagy activity. The aim of our study is to explore whether Mst1 contributes to NAFLD via disrupting Parkin-related mitophagy. A NAFLD model was generated in wild-type (WT) mice and Mst1 knockout (Mst1-KO) mice using high-fat diet (HFD). Cell experiments were conducted via  (PA) treatment in the primary hepatocytes. The results in our study demonstrated that Mst1 was significantly upregulated in HFD-treated livers. Genetic ablation of Mst1 attenuated HFD-mediated hepatic injury and sustained hepatocyte viability. Functional studies illustrated that Mst1 knockdown reversed Parkin-related mitophagy and the latter protected mitochondria and hepatocytes against HFD challenge. Besides, we further figured out that Mst1 modulated Parkin expression via the AMPK pathway; blockade of AMPK repressed Parkin-related mitophagy and recalled hepatocytes mitochondrial apoptosis. Altogether, our data identified that NAFLD was closely associated with the defective Parkin-related mitophagy due to Mst1 upregulation.

Actually, inadequate dietary habits together with physical inactivity are primary determinants of  and cancer risk. Changes in lipid metabolism play a crucial role in different types of cancer and key enzymes involved in lipid-metabolic pathways, such as stearoyl-coA-desaturase 1 (SCD-1), are differentially expressed in normal and cancer tissues.Food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) were analyzed by Winfood software. FA were assessed by gas-liquid chromatography in visceral AT samples. Estimated desaturase activities were calculated as precursor FA/product FA ratio. Desaturase gene expressions were evaluated by RT-qPCR.Lean and obese CRC subjects showed inadequate dietary habits. In particular, lean CRC subjects showed increase in the intake of saturated FA, specifically  (p = 0.0042) and stearic  (p = 0.0091), and a corresponding reduction of monounsaturated FA consumption, in particular oleic  (p = 0.002) with respect to lean without CRC. Estimated SCD-1 activity in AT was increased in all the groups vs lean without CRC (pANOVA = 0.029).Unhealthy eating habits, characterizing obese and CRC subjects, may influence the visceral AT profile and contribute to the alteration of the metabolic pathways.

The effects of 9-PAHSA on brown fat markers in 3T3-L1 cells were decreased when GPR120 gene was silenced. To investigate the molecular mechanism of 9-PAHSA on adipocyte browning, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory model was conducted. 9-PAHSA treatment abolished LPS-induced NF-kappa B (NF-κB) activation and inflammatory cytokine secretion.

Evidence indicates that this increased risk is linked to an altered cardiac substrate preference of the insulin resistant heart, which shifts from a balanced utilization of glucose and long-chain fatty acids (FAs) towards an almost complete reliance on FAs as main fuel source. This shift leads to a loss of endosomal proton pump activity and increased cardiac fat accumulation, which eventually triggers cardiac dysfunction. In this review, we describe the advantages and disadvantages of currently used in vitro models to study the underlying mechanism of IR-induced HF and provide insight into a human in vitro model: human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs). Using functional metabolic assays we demonstrate that, similar to rodent studies, hESC-CMs subjected to 16h of high palmitate (HP) treatment develop the main features of IR, i.e., decreased insulin-stimulated glucose and FA uptake, as well as loss of endosomal acidification and insulin signaling. Taken together, these data propose that HP-treated hESC-CMs are a promising in vitro model of lipid overload-induced IR for further research into the underlying mechanism of cardiac IR and for identifying new pharmacological agents and therapeutic strategies.

Mitochondrial activities of the colon enterocytes were compared among three groups of mice (lean, DIO, and DIO + BBR) at the end of treatment. Gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were examined to understand the mitochondrial responses. A cellular model treated with  (PA) was used in the mechanism study.A reduction in GLP-1 expression was observed in DIO mice with mitochondrial stress responses in the colon enterocytes. The mitochondria exhibited cristae loss, membrane rupture, and mitochondrial swelling, which was observed with an increase in ATP abundance, complex I activity, and deficiency in the activities of complexes II and IV. Those changes were associated with dysbiosis and a reduction in SCFAs in the colon of DIO mice.

It has also been reported to improve insulin sensitivity in animal models of  and diabetic patients by targeting to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ. High glucose/high lipid (HG/HL)-induced apoptosis of pancreatic β-cells impairs its function of insulin secretion and is generally believed to be the key factor in the development of diabetes. In this study, we investigated whether telmisartan exerted a protective effect against HG/HL-induced apoptosis and insulin secretion in vitro as well as in vivo; 10-μM telmisartan treatment significantly reduced HG (25 mM) or/and HL (0.4 mM ) induced-cell apoptosis and greatly improved insulin secretion in INS-1 pancreatic β-cells, which is consistent in an  rat model induced by HG/HL diets. Furthermore, telmisartan treatment markedly reduced the protein level of GRP78, CHOP, and caspase 12, while increasing anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression. Moreover, telmisartan treatment significantly reduced intracellular ROS levels. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that PPARγ signaling pathway may be involved in the telmisartan protective effects, which were blocked by a PPARγ blocker, GW9662.

Long-term high glucose in the blood has been proposed to induce pancreatic β-cell loss and is generally believed to be the key factor in the development of diabetes. In the present study, we demonstrated that telmisartan, a common drug used for hypertension treatment, has a protective effect against high glucose/high lipid-induced cell apoptosis and greatly improves the insulin secretion function by inhibiting the oxidative stress and ER stress. Furthermore, this protective effect of telmisartan is mediated by the PPAR-γ signal pathway, which may provide a potential strategy against T2DM.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29572383>CTRP3 attenuates high-fat diet-induced male reproductive dysfunction in mice.</a></h2><p>Recent studies have suggested a role for abdominal  in male infertility.

Development of the biological function of locomotion and kinetic parameters of the body.]</a></h2><p>Phylogenetic theory of general pathology draws researchers' attention to the following aspects of the biological effects of insulin. 1. Phylogenetically, in vivo insulin is primarily involved in the metabolism of fatty acids (FA) and only in the second turn in glucose metabolism; regulation of FA metabolism in cells started millions of years earlier than that of glucose metabolism. Phylogenetically late insulin blocks lipolysis only in phylogenetically late insulin-dependent subcutaneous adipocytes but not in phylogenetically early visceral fat cells of the omentum. 2. Biological role of insulin consists in the formation of the biological function of locomotion, i.e., movement arising from contraction of striated myocytes provided with substrates (FA and glucose) for energy production as macroergic ATP. 3. Biological destiny of phylogenetically late insulin is transformation of carnivorous (fish-eating) animals living in the ocean into herbivores living on the dry land. 4. Insulin has formed in vivo highly efficient oleic variant of FA metabolism instead of phylogenetically early less efficient  variant. 5. Biologically, insulin is destined for providing cells with energy and perfection of physical activity and kinetic parameters of the organism. According to phylogenetic theory of general pathology and basic principles of endocrinology, clinical cases should be regarded as: 1. rare structurally-related insulindeficient type I diabetes mellitus, 2. rare structurally-related (receptor pathology) hyperinsulinemic type II diabetes mellitus, and 3. a great number of patients with functional disorders in the hormone activity, insulin resistance syndrome, metabolic syndrome and .

Through dual luciferase assay, we demonstrate that miR-194 directly binds to FXR/Nr1h4 3'-UTR, and inhibits gene expression of FXR/Nr1h4. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-194 downregulates FXR/Nr1h4 in cultured hepatocytes, but miR-194 inhibitor reversely increases FXR/Nr1h4 expression in obese mouse liver tissues. On the contrast, silence of FXR/Nr1h4 abolishes the hepatic benefits in obese mice treated with miR-194 inhibitor. Present study provides a novel finding that suppression of miR-194 attenuates dietary-induced NAFLD via upregulation of FXR/Nr1h4. The findings suggest miR-194/FXR are potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for NAFLD.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

SFAs can induce lipotoxic damage to cardiomyocytes, but the mechanism is unclear. The long noncoding RNA metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) acts as a key regulator in  (PA)-induced hepatic steatosis, but its role in PA-induced myocardial lipotoxic injury is still unknown. The aim of this study was to explore the role and underlying mechanism of MALAT1 in PA-induced myocardial lipotoxic injury.  MALAT1 expression in PA-treated human cardiomyocytes (AC16 cells) was detected by RT-qPCR. The effect of MALAT1 on PA-induced myocardial injury was measured by Cell Counting Kit-8, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) assays. Apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. The activities of cytokines and nuclear factor (NF)-κB were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The interaction between MALAT1 and miR-26a was evaluated by a luciferase reporter assay and RT-qPCR. The regulatory effects of MALAT1 on high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) expression were evaluated by RT-qPCR and western blotting.  MALAT1 was significantly upregulated in cardiomyocytes after PA treatment. Knockdown of MALAT1 increased the viability of PA-treated cardiomyocytes, decreased apoptosis, and reduced the levels of LDH, CK-MB, TNF-α, and IL-1β. Moreover, we found that MALAT1 specifically binds to miR-26a and observed a reciprocal negative regulatory relationship between these factors. We further found that the downregulation of MALAT1 represses HMGB1 expression, thereby inhibiting the activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response. These repressive effects were rescued by an miR-26a inhibitor.  We demonstrate that MALAT1 is induced by SFAs and its downregulation alleviates SFA-induced myocardial inflammatory injury via the miR-26a/HMGB1/TLR4/NF-κB axis.

In heart, the accumulation of saturated fatty acids has been determined to play a role in the development of heart failure and diabetic cardiomyopathy. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) has been reported to possess key atheroprotective biological properties, including cellular cholesterol efflux capacity, anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activities. However, the underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to test whether HDL could protect  (PA)-induced cardiomyocyte injury and explore the possible mechanisms.H9c2 cells were pretreated with HDL (50-100 μg/ml) for 2 h followed by PA (0.5 mM) for indicated time period. Our results showed that HDL inhibited PA-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, HDL rescued PA-induced ROS generation and the phosphorylation of JNK which in turn activated NF-κB-mediated inflammatory proteins expressions. We also found that PA impaired the balance of BCL family proteins, destabilized mitochondrial membrane potential, and triggered subsequent cytochrome c release into the cytosol and activation of caspase 3.

Here, we aimed to examine the regulatory pathways whereby FGF21 mediates islet lipid metabolism in lipotoxicity-treated cells and animal models. Rat β-cell line (INS-1E cells) and islets isolated from C57/BL6J mice were exposed to  (PA) with/without FGF21, mimicking lipotoxic conditions. Resultant insulin secretion and intracellular signaling were analyzed with Western blotting and RNA-seq. C57/BL6J and global FGF21 knockout (KO) mice were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) to induce lipotoxicity and given with a long-acting mimetic of FGF21. Insulin resistance and β-cell function were then assessed using homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and insulinogenic index. FGF21 ameliorated PA-induced lipid accumulation, reversed cell apoptosis, and enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) as impaired by lipotoxicity in islet β-cells. Mechanistically, FGF21 exerted its beneficial effects through activation of AMPK-ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) pathway and peroxisome proliferation-activated receptors (PPARs) δ/γ signaling, thus increasing the levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A (CPT1A) and leading to increased fatty  (FA) oxidation and reduced lipid deposition in β-cells. Interestingly, FGF21 reduced PA-induced cell death via restoration of the expression of apoptosis inhibitor Birc3. In vivo studies further showed that FGF21 is critical for islet insulinogenic capacity and normal function in the context of HFD-treated animals. FGF21 down-regulates islet cell lipid accumulation, probably via activation of AMPK-ACC and PPARδ/γ signaling, and reduces cell death under lipotoxicity, indicating that FGF21 is protective against lipotoxicity-induced β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis.© 2019 The Author(s).

PVAT dysfunction has a crucial role in regulating vascular remodeling, but the exact mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we investigated whether and how -induced PVAT dysfunction affected adventitia remodeling in early vascular injury stages. Mini pigs were fed a high sugar and fat diet for 6 months to induce metabolic syndrome and . In the mini pigs, left carotid vascular injury was then generated using balloon dilation. Compared with normal mini pigs, obese mini pigs displayed significantly enhanced vascular injury-induced adventitial responses, evidenced by adventitia fibroblast (AF) proliferation and differentiation, and adventitia fibrosis, as well as exacerbated PVAT dysfunction characterized by increased accumulation of resident macrophages, particularly the M1 pro-inflammatory phenotype, increased expression of leptin and decreased expression of adiponectin, and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18. Primary AFs cultured in PVAT-conditioned medium from obese mini pigs also showed significantly increased proliferation and differentiation. We further revealed that activated nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and its downstream products, i.e., IL-1 family members such as IL-1β and IL-18 were upregulated in the PVAT of obese mini pigs; PVAT dysfunction was also demonstrated in preadipocytes treated with .

Nutrient excess, through overconsumption of a Western or high-fat diet, exposes the hypothalamus to high levels of free fatty acids, which induces neuroinflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and dysregulation of neuropeptide synthesis. Furthermore, exposure to a high-fat diet also disrupts normal circadian rhythms, and conversely, clock gene knockout models have symptoms of metabolic disorders. While whole brain/animal studies have provided phenotypic end points and important clues to the genes involved, there are still major gaps in our understanding of the intracellular pathways and neuron-specific components that ultimately control circadian rhythms and energy homeostasis. Because of its complexity and heterogeneous nature, containing a diverse mix cell types, it is difficult to dissect the critical hypothalamic components involved in these processes. Of significance, we have the capacity to study these individual components using an extensive collection of both embryonic- and adult-derived, immortalized hypothalamic neuronal cell lines from rodents. These defined neuronal cell lines have been used to examine the impact of nutrient excess, such as palmitate, on circadian rhythms and neuroendocrine signaling pathways, as well as changes in vital neuropeptides, leading to the development of neuronal inflammation; the role of proinflammatory molecules in this process; and ultimately, restoration of normal signaling, clock gene expression, and neuropeptide synthesis in disrupted states by beneficial anti-inflammatory compounds in defined hypothalamic neurons.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155812>Anthocyanins ameliorate palmitate-induced inflammation and insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Increased adiposity has been associated with adipose tissue low-grade inflammation leading to insulin resistance. Adipocyte differentiation inhibitors are expected to be effective in preventing  and related diseases. Anthocyanins (ACNs) are associated to enhanced adipocyte function and protection from metabolic stress. Herein, we evaluated the in vitro protective effects of an ACN rich extract against  (PA)-induced hypertrophy, inflammation, and insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. ACN extract pretreatment reduces lipid accumulation and peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-γ protein levels induced by PA. In addition, PA induces inflammation with activation of NF-κB pathway, whereas ACN extract pretreatment dose-dependently inhibited this pathway. Furthermore, adipocyte dysfunction associated with hypertrophy induces insulin resistance by affecting phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-protein kinase B/Akt axis, GLUT-1, and adiponectin mRNA levels. ACN extract pretreatment reverts these effects induced by PA and moreover was able to induce insulin pathway with levels higher than insulin control cells, supporting an insulin sensitizer role for ACNs. This study demonstrates a prevention potential of ACNs against  comorbidities, due to their protective effects against inflammation/insulin resistance in adipocytes.

The active form of vitamin D, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)D], regulates adipocyte differentiation and inflammation, highlighting the multifaceted role that vitamin D plays in adipose tissue physiology. However, there is limited evidence regarding vitamin D regulation of mature adipocyte lipid metabolism. We hypothesize that 1,25(OH)D alters lipid and glucose metabolism in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes to reduce triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation. In this study, 1,25(OH)D (10 nmol/L) stimulated a 21% reduction in TAG accumulation in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes after 4 days (P = .01) despite a significant increase in fatty  uptake (P < .01). Additionally, 1,25(OH)D stimulated a 2.5-fold increase in CO production from [1-C]  (P < .01), indicative of an elevated rate of fatty  β-oxidation, while stimulating a 9% reduction in de novo fatty  synthesis (P = .03). Interestingly, d-[U-C]glucose incorporation into fatty acids was reduced by 30% in response to 1,25(OH)D (P < .01), indicating a reduced contribution of glucose as a substrate for de novo lipogenesis. Consistent with these findings, mRNA expression of the anaplerotic enzyme pyruvate carboxylase was reduced by 41% (P < .01). In summary, 1,25(OH)D stimulated fatty  oxidation and reduced TAG accumulation in differentiated adipocytes. Furthermore, 1,25(OH)D reduced glucose utilization as a substrate for fatty  synthesis potentially by downregulating pyruvate carboxylase and stimulating glucose disposal as glycerol. Collectively, these 1,25(OH)D-induced changes in lipid metabolism and glucose utilization may contribute to the reduction in TAG accumulation and be protective against excessive fat mass accumulation and associated metabolic disorders.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Obese and/or diabetic patients have elevated levels of free fatty acids, increased susceptibility to gastrointestinal symptoms and are suggested to have altered vitamin D balance. The enteric nervous system is pivotal in regulating gastrointestinal activity and high fat diet (HFD) has been shown to cause loss of enteric neurons in ileum and colon. This study investigates the effect of vitamin D on HFD- and -induced enteric neuronal loss in vivo and in vitro.Mice were fed either a normal diet (ND) or HFD supplemented with varying levels of vitamin D (from 0x to 20x normal vitamin D level) for 19 weeks. Ileum and colon were analyzed for neuronal numbers and remodeling. Primary cultures of myenteric neurons from mouse small intestine were treated with  (4x10M) and/or 1α,25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 (VD, 10- 10M) with or without modulators of lipid metabolism and VD pathways. Cultures were analyzed by immunocyto- and histochemical methods.Vitamin D supplementation had no effect on enteric neuronal survival in the ND group. HFD caused substantial loss of myenteric neurons in ileum and colon. Vitamin D supplementation between 0-2x normal had no effect on HFD-induced neuronal loss. Supplementation with 20x normal, prevented the HFD-induced neuronal loss. In vitro supplementation of VD prevented the -induced neuronal loss. The VD receptor (VDR) was not identified in enteric neurons. Enteric glia expressed the alternative VD receptor, protein disulphide isomerase family A member 3 (PDIA3), but PDIA3 was not found to mediate the VD response in vitro. Inhibition of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and immune neutralization of isocitrate lyase prevented the VD mediated neuroprotection to  exposure.Results show that VD protect enteric neurons against HFD and  induced neuronal loss. The mechanism behind is suggested to be through activation of PPARγ leading to improved neuronal peroxisome function and metabolism of neuronal lipid intermediates.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30048968>High Fat Diet Upregulates Fatty  Oxidation and Ketogenesis via Intervention of PPAR-γ.</a></h2><p>Systemic hyperlipidemia and intracellular lipid accumulation induced by chronic high fat diet (HFD) leads to enhanced fatty  oxidation (FAO) and ketogenesis.

Treatment course was followed by echocardiographic measurements, glycemic and lipid profiling, immunoblot, qPCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of PPAR-γ and following mitochondrial metabolic enzymes 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGCS2), mitochondrial β- hydroxy butyrate dehydrogenase (BDH1) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 4 (PDK4). In vivo model was translated in vitro, with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCM) treated with PPAR-γ agonist/antagonist and PPAR-γ overexpression adenovirus in presence of  (PA). Apoptosis was determined in vivo from left ventricular heart by TUNEL assay and immunoblot analysis.We found exaggerated circulating ketone bodies production and expressions of the related mitochondrial enzymes HMGCS2, BDH1 and PDK4 in HFD-induced diabetic hearts and in PA-treated NRCM. As a mechanistic approach we found HFD mediated activation of PPAR-γ is associated with the above-mentioned mitochondrial enzymes. HFD-fed PPAR-γ-/-mice display decreased hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia associated with increased insulin responsiveness as compared to HFD-fed WT mice PPAR-γ-/-HFD mice demonstrated a more robust functional recovery after diabetes induction, as well as significantly reduced myocyte apoptosis and improved cardiac function.PPAR-γ has been described previously to regulate lipid metabolism and adipogenesis. The present study suggests for the first time that increased PPAR-γ expression by HFD is responsible for cardiac dysfunction via upregulation of mitochondrial enzymes HMGCS2, BDH1 and PDK4. Targeting PPAR-γ and its downstream mitochondrial enzymes will provide novel strategies in preventing metabolic and myocardial dysfunction in diabetes mellitus.© 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.

Information was also collected from classic books of Chinese herbal medicine, Ph.D. and M.Sc. dissertations, unpublished materials, and local conference papers on toxicology. Plant taxonomy was confirmed to the database "The Plant List" (www.theplantlist.org).More than 79 chemical compounds have been isolated from A. macrocephala, including sesquiterpenoids, triterpenoids, polyacetylenes, coumarins, phenylpropanoids, flavonoids and flavonoid glycosides, steroids, benzoquinones, and polysaccharides. Crude extracts and pure compounds of A. macrocephala are used to treat gastrointestinal hypofunction, cancer, arthritis, osteoporosis, splenic asthenia, abnormal fetal movement, Alzheimer disease, and . These extracts have various pharmacological effects, including anti-tumor activity, anti-inflammatory activity, anti-aging activity, anti-oxidative activity, anti-osteoporotic activity, neuroprotective activity, and immunomodulatory activity, as well as improving gastrointestinal function and gonadal hormone regulation.A. macrocephala is a valuable traditional Chinese medicinal herb with multiple pharmacological activities. Pharmacological investigations support the traditional use of A. macrocephala, and may validate the folk medicinal use of A. macrocephala to treat many chronic diseases. The available literature shows that much of the activity of A. macrocephala can be attributed to sesquiterpenoids, polysaccharides and polyacetylenes. However, there is a need to further understand the molecular mechanisms and the structure-function relationship of these constituents, as well as their potential synergistic and antagonistic effects.

Previous studies have suggested that hepatocyte nuclear factor 1b (HNF1b) ameliorates insulin resistance. However, the role of HNF1b in the regulation of lipid metabolism and hepatic steatosis remains poorly understood. We found that HNF1b expression was decreased in steatotic livers. We injected mice with lentivirus (LV) expressing HNF1b shRNA to generate mice with hepatic knockdown of HNF1b. We also injected high fat (HF) diet-induced obese and db/db diabetic mice with LV expressing HNF1b to overexpress HNF1b. Knockdown of HNF1b increased hepatic lipid contents and induced insulin resistance in mice and in hepatocytes. Knockdown of HNF1b worsened HF diet-induced increases in hepatic lipid contents, liver injury and insulin resistance in mice and PA-induced lipid accumulation and impaired insulin signaling in hepatocytes. Moreover, overexpression of HNF1b alleviated HF diet-induced increases in hepatic lipid content and insulin resistance in mice. Knockdown of HNF1b increased expression of genes associated with lipogenensis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. DPP4 and NOX1 expression was increased by knockdown of HNF1b and HNF1b directly bound with the promoters of DPP4 and NOX1. Overexpression of DPP4 or NOX1 was associated with an increase in lipid droplets in hepatocytes and decreased expression of DPP4 or NOX1 suppressed the effects of knockdown of HNF1b knockdown on triglyceride (TG) formation and insulin signaling. Knockdown of HNF1b increased superoxide level and decreased glutathione content, which was inhibited by downregulation of DPP4 and NOX1. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) suppressed HNF1b knockdown-induced ER stress, TG formation and insulin resistance.  (PA) decreased HNF1b expression which was inhibited by NAC. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that HNF1b plays an essential role in controlling hepatic TG homeostasis and insulin sensitivity by regulating DPP4/NOX1mediated generation of superoxide.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This study was designed to examine the impact of ET-1 receptor A (ET) ablation on -induced changes in cardiac geometry and contractile function, as well as the mechanisms involved with a focus on autophagy. Cardiomyocyte-specific ET receptor knockout (ETAKO) and WT mice were fed either low-fat (10% calorie from fat) or high-fat (45% calorie from fat) diet for 24 weeks. Glucose tolerance test was examined to confirm insulin resistance. High-fat diet intake compromised myocardial geometry (enlarged left ventricular diameters in systole and diastole), morphology (cardiac hypertrophy, increased wall thickness and interstitial fibrosis), contractile function (reduced fractional shortening, ejection fraction and cardiomyocyte shortening) and intracellular Ca handling, the effect of which was significantly attenuated by ETAKO. TUNEL staining revealed overt apoptosis in high-fat-fed group, the effect was reverted by ETAKO. Western blot analysis noted that high-fat intake downregulated leptin receptor and PPARγ, insulin signaling (elevated basal/dampened insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and IRS1), phosphorylation of AMPK, ACC, upregulated GATA-4, ANP, NFATc3, PPARα, m-TOR/p70s6k signaling, which were attenuated by ETAKO with the exception of AMPK/ACC. Furthermore, high-fat intake suppressed cardiac autophagy, which was abrogated by ETAKO. In cultured murine cardiomyocytes,  challenged mimicked high-fat diet-induced hypertrophic and autophagic responses, the effect of which were abolished by the ET receptor antagonist BQ123 or mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. These results suggest that inhibition of ET rescues high-fat intake-induced cardiac anomalies possibly through autophagy regulation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Acne vulgaris is primarily a disease of wealthy countries and exhibits higher prevalence rates in developed compared with developing countries. No acne has been found in non-Westernized populations still living under Paleolithic dietary conditions constraining hyperglycemic carbohydrates, milk, and dairy products. The high prevalence rates of adolescent acne cannot be explained by the predominance of genetic factors but by the influence of a Western diet that overstimulates the key conductor of metabolism, the nutrient- and growth factor-sensitive kinase mTORC1. Increased mTORC1 activity has been detected in lesional skin and sebaceous glands of acne patients compared with acne-free controls. Increased mTORC1 signaling is a characteristic feature of insulin resistance, , type 2 diabetes mellitus, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. Acne vulgaris is a family member of mTORC1-driven diseases of civilization and represents the MetS of the sebaceous follicle.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, MCD feeding caused an increased in triglyceride content and liver-to-body weight ratio in WT mice, features that were attenuated in GRK2± mice. According to their NAFLD activity score, MCD-fed GRK2± mice were diagnosed with simple steatosis and not overt NASH. They also showed reduced expression of lipogenic and lipid-uptake markers and less signs of inflammation in the liver. GRK2± mice preserved hepatic protective mechanisms as enhanced autophagy and mitochondrial fusion and biogenesis, together with reduced endoplasmic reticulum stress. GRK2 protein was increased in MCD-fed WT but not in GRK2± mice, and enhanced GRK2 expression potentiated -triggered lipid accumulation in human hepatocytes directly relating GRK2 levels to steatosis.

However, the mechanism by which long-chain saturated fatty acids trigger inflammation is still contentious. To elucidate this mechanism, the effect of fatty acids on the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNFα was investigated in the mHypoE-N42 hypothalamic cell line (N42). N42 cells were treated with lauric  (LA) and  (PA). PA challenge was carried out in the presence of either a TLR4 inhibitor, a ceramide synthesis inhibitor (L-cycloserine), oleic  (OA) or eicosapentaenoic  (EPA). Intracellular ceramide accumulation was quantified using LC-ESI-MS/MS. PA but not LA upregulated IL-6 and TNFα. L-cycloserine, OA and EPA all counteracted PA-induced intracellular ceramide accumulation leading to a downregulation of IL-6 and TNFα. However, a TLR4 inhibitor failed to inhibit PA-induced upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, PA induced the expression of IL-6 and TNFα in N42 neuronal cells independently of TLR4 but, partially, via ceramide synthesis with OA and EPA being anti-inflammatory by decreasing PA-induced intracellular ceramide build-up. Thus, ceramide accumulation represents one on the mechanisms by which PA induces inflammation in neurons.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200402>[Insulin resistance is an alimentary deficiency of energy substrates (glucose) in the biological reaction of exotrophy and aphysiology compensation by fatty acids via the biological reaction of endothrophy.]</a></h2><p>The deficiency of energy substrates in the biological function of trophology and biological reaction of exotrophy is formed by two factors. Excess of meat in the diet leads to high content of  fatty  (FA) in hepatocytes and formation of  triglycerides (TG). Post heparin lipoprotein lipase slowly hydrolyzes  TG in blood plasma lipoproteins and releases small amounts of FA. If dietary carbohydrate content is low, the biological function of exotrophy does not provide the substrate from which hepatocytes can rapidly produce oleic nonesterified FA de novo. Energy substrate deficiency activates the biological function of adaptation and the biological reaction of compensation. Under the effect of epinephrin NEFA deficiency is compensated via the biological reaction of endotrophy and lipolysis in omental visceral fat cells. In insulin resistance (IR) syndrome, the biological function of feeding is realized nonphysiologically while the biological reaction of adaptation is realized physiologically. An increase in NEFA blood content physiologically blocks glucose uptake in cells. Biological role of insulin consists in conversion of distant ocean-living carnivorous (fish-eating) ancestors of Homo sapiens with  type of FA metabolism into herbivorous dry land-living species with oleic type metabolism of FA.

CD36, a class B scavenger receptor, is highly expressed in the renal proximal tubules and mediates FFA uptake. It is not clear whether FFA- and proteinuria-mediated CD36 activation coordinates NLRP3 inflammasomes to induce renal tubular injury and inflammation. In this study, we investigated the roles of CD36 and NLRP3 inflammasomes in FFA-induced renal injury in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced . HFD-fed C57BL/6 mice and palmitate-treated HK2 renal tubular cells were used as in vivo and in vitro models. Immunohistochemical staining showed that CD36, IL-1β, and IL-18 levels increased progressively in the kidneys of HFD-fed mice. Sulfo- N-succinimidyl oleate (SSO), a CD36 inhibitor, attenuated the HFD-induced upregulation of NLRP3, IL-1β, and IL-18 and suppressed the colocalization of NLRP3 and ASC in renal tubular cells. In vitro, SSO abolished the palmitate-induced activation of IL-1β, IL-18, and caspase-1 in HK2 proximal tubular cells. Furthermore, treatment with SSO and the knockdown of caspase-1 expression by siRNA both inhibited palmitate-induced cell death and apoptosis in HK2 cells. Collectively, palmitate causes renal tubular inflammation, cell death, and apoptosis via the CD36/NLRP3/caspase-1 axis, which may explain, at least in part, the mechanism underlying FFA-related renal tubular injury.

The correlation of miR-320 with genes involved in ERs and inflammation was analyzed. The effects of miR-320 on ERs and inflammation were explored using mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which were pretreated with  (PA).ERs markers and inflammatory cytokines were all upregulated in obese patients. Adipose tissue miR-320 expression was also increased in obese patients, and had positive correlations with the levels of ERs markers and inflammatory cytokines. After PA treatment, the levels of ERs markers and inflammatory cytokines were elevated significantly in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Moreover, miR-320 expression was increased in the cells under ERs status. The upregulation of miR-320 could enhance the expression of ERs markers and inflammatory cytokines, but the downregulation of miR-320 resulted in the opposite results.The data of this study indicate that miR-320 expression is upregulated in ERs status, and the downregulation of miR-320 ameliorates ERs and the inflammatory response in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

L6 myotubes were incubated with BSA-adsorbed palmitate or palmitoleate in the presence of myriocin, fenretinide, or fumonisin B1. Lipid species were determined by lipidomic analysis. Insulin sensitivity was scored by Akt phosphorylation and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation, while pro-inflammatory indices were estimated by IκBα degradation and cytokine expression. Palmitate, but not palmitoleate, had mild effects on Akt phosphorylation but significantly inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation and increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines  and  Ceramides, hexosylceramides, and sphingosine-1-phosphate significantly heightened by palmitate correlated negatively with insulin sensitivity and positively with pro-inflammatory indices. Inhibition of sphingolipid pathways led to marked changes in cellular lipids, but did not prevent palmitate-induced impairment of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, suggesting that palmitate-induced accumulation of deleterious lipids and insulin resistance are correlated but independent events in myotubes. We propose that muscle cell-endogenous ceramide production does not evoke insulin resistance and that deleterious effects of ceramides in vivo may arise through ancillary cell communication.Copyright © 2018 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29425478>Postprandial Lipid Response to High-Saturated and High-Monounsaturated Fat Meals in Normal-Weight or Overweight Women.</a></h2><p>We evaluated postprandial response of the lipid metabolism markers after the intake of a high-saturated fat (HSM) or high-monounsaturated fat meal (HMM).A randomized, controlled and acute intervention study included 63 women (age 26.9 ± 6.1 years): 35 normal weight (NW) and 28 overweight (OW) (total body fat [TBF] 24.7 ± 3.9% and 36.6 ± 3.9%, respectively).

Yet, its mechanisms remain poorly understood. The Activator Protein 1 (AP-1) member JunD was recently identified as a key modulator of hepatic lipid metabolism in obese mice. The present study investigates the role of JunD in -induced MC.JunD transcriptional activity was increased in hearts from diet-induced obese (DIO) mice and was associated with myocardial TG accumulation and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Obese mice lacking JunD were protected against MC. In DIO hearts, JunD directly binds PPARγ promoter thus enabling transcription of genes involved in TG synthesis, uptake, hydrolysis, and storage (i.e. Fas, Cd36, Lpl, Plin5). Cardiac-specific overexpression of JunD in lean mice led to PPARγ activation, cardiac steatosis, and dysfunction, thereby mimicking the MC phenotype. In DIO hearts as well as in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes exposed to , Ago2 immunoprecipitation, and luciferase assays revealed JunD as a direct target of miR-494-3p. Indeed, miR-494-3p was down-regulated in hearts from obese mice, while its overexpression prevented lipotoxic damage by suppressing JunD/PPARγ signalling. JunD and miR-494-3p were also dysregulated in myocardial specimens from obese patients as compared with non-obese controls, and correlated with myocardial TG content, expression of PPARγ-dependent genes, and echocardiographic indices of LV dysfunction.miR-494-3p/JunD is a novel molecular axis involved in -related MC.

The biological role of the late in the phylogeny of insulin is the formation of new biological functions in vivo. The action of insulin has transformed the carnivorous (fish-eating) ocean into herbivorous (Herbivores) species on land. There was it by synthesis in vivo from exogenous glucose of fatty acids (FA). Regulatory action of insulin was the directed conversion of exogenous glucose into ω-6 C18: 1 cis-oleic FA. Insulin late in phylogeny expressed the synthesis of new, conjugated enzymes: it is palmitoyl-CoA-elongase and stearyl-CoAdesaturase. Two enzymes synthesized FAs along the way: synthesized in situ de novo, from exogenous glucose, C16: 0  → C18: 0 stearic  → ω-6 C18: 1 cis-oleic  without accumulation of stearic FA. Insulin is not converted into an oleic FA exogenous  from carnivorous food. On land, the action of insulin transformed the species Homo sapiens, into a herbivore, but with carnivorous, fish-eating, past.

The results showed that COS pretreatment for 12 h significantly ameliorated lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells exposed to PA for 24 h, accompanied by a reversing of the upregulated mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, MCP-1, TNF-α) and glucolipid metabolism-related regulators (SCD-1, ACC1, PCK1-α). In addition, COS treatment alleviated glucolipid metabolism disorder in mice fed with HFD for five months, including reduction in body weight and fasting glucose, restoration of intraperitoneal glucose tolerance, and suppression of overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines and glucolipid metabolism-related regulators. Furthermore, our study found that COS pretreatment significantly reversed the downregulation of PPARγ at transcriptional and translational levels in both PA-induced HepG2 cells and liver tissues of HFD-fed mice.

Monolayer cultures of early diabetic MDSCs were incubated 4 days in DMEM/10% fetal calf serum + or - aged OZ or lean Zucker serum from non-diabetic lean Zucker rats (0.5-5%) or with soluble  (PA) (0.5-2 mM), cholesterol (CHOL) (50-400 mg/dL), or glucose (10-25 mM).Fat infiltration was estimated by Oil red O, apoptosis by TUNEL, protein expression by Western blots, and gene-GTS and microRNA (miR)-GTS were determined in these stem cells' RNA.Aged OZ serum caused fat infiltration, apoptosis, myostatin overexpression, and impaired differentiation. Some of these changes, and also a proliferation decrease occurred with PA and CHOL. The gene-GTS changes by OZ serum did not resemble the in vivo changes, but some occurred with PA and CHOL. The miR-GTS changes by OZ serum, PA, and CHOL resembled most of the in vivo changes. Hyperglycemia did not replicate most alterations.MDSCs may be damaged in long-term UC-T2D/obese patients and be ineffective in autologous human stem cell therapy, which may be prevented by excluding the damaged MDSCs.The in vitro test of MDSCs is innovative and fast to define dyslipidemic factors inducing stem cell damage, its mechanism, prevention, and counteraction. Confirmation is required in other T2D/ rat models and stem cells (including human), as well as miR-GTS biomarker validation as a stem cell damage biomarker.Serum from long-term UC-T2D/obese rats or dyslipidemic factors induces a noxious phenotype and miR-GTS on normal MDSCs, which may lead in vivo to the repair inefficacy of late diabetic MDSCs. This suggests that autograft therapy with MDSCs in long-term UT-T2D obese patients may be ineffective, albeit this may be predictable by prior stem cell miR-GTS tests.

Vagotomy further prevented overproduction of VLDL-triglyceride induced by an acute fat load and a high-fat diet-induced , hyperlipidemia, hepatic steatosis, and glucose intolerance. Mechanistic studies revealed that plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 was significantly raised in the vagotomized mice, which was associated with significant reductions in mRNA and protein expression of SREBP-1c (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c), SCD-1 (stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1), and FASN (fatty  synthase), as well as enhanced hepatic insulin sensitivity. In vitro, treating mouse primary hepatocytes with a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, exendin-4, for 48 hours inhibited free fatty ,  treatment induced de novo lipid synthesis, and VLDL secretion from hepatocytes.Elevation of glucagon-like peptide-1 in vagotomized mice may prevent VLDL overproduction and insulin resistance induced by high-fat diet.

Oleuropein, a major phenolic compound in olives, is known to reduce the blood glucose levels in alloxan-induced diabetic rats and rabbits, however, its effect on type 2 diabetes caused by  is not clear. The purpose of this study is clarifying the effect of oleuropein on the glucose tolerance in skeletal muscle under the condition of lipotoxicity caused by type 2 diabetes. Oleuropein enhanced glucose uptake in C2C12 cells without insulin. Translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) into the cell membrane was promoted by activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) but not protein kinase B (Akt). Physiological concentration of oleuropein (10 µM) was sufficient to express beneficial effects on C2C12 cells. Oleuropein prevented -induced myocellular insulin resistance. Furthermore, in gastrocnemius muscles of mice fed a high fat diet, oleuropein also induced the GLUT4 localization into cell membrane. These results suggest the possibility of oleuropein to be effective for type 2 diabetes by reducing insulin resistance in skeletal muscles.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30096651>Rational design of dimeric lipidated Xenopus glucagon-like peptide 1 analogues as long-acting antihyperglycaemic agents.</a></h2><p>Dimerization is viewed as an effective means to enhance the binding affinity and therapeutic potency of peptides. Both dimerization and lipidation effectively prolong the half-life of peptides in vivo by increasing hydrodynamic size and facilitating physical interactions with serum albumin. Here, we report a novel method to discover long-acting glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogues by rational design based on Xenopus GLP-1 through a combined dimerization and lipidization strategy. On the basis of our previous structure analysis of Xenopus GLP-1,  and a C-terminal Cys were firstly introduced into two Xenopus GLP-1 analogues (1 and 2), and the afforded 3 and 4 were further reacted with bis-maleimide amine to afford two dimeric lipidated Xenopus GLP-1 analogues (5 and 6). The in vitro and in vivo biological activities of 5 and 6 were significantly improved as compared with their monomers. Moreover, the selected compound 6 showed greater hypoglycemic and insulinotropic activities than liraglutide even when the dose of 6 was reduced to half in db/db mice. Pharmacokinetic test revealed that 6 had a ∼ 3-fold longer half-life than liraglutide in Kunming mice and SD rats, and the longer half-life of 6 led to excellent long-acting hypoglycemic effects as confirmed by two different pharmacological methods conducted on db/db mice. Finally, a 7 weeks chronic study conducted on db/db mice demonstrated the better therapeutic efficacies of 6 on glucose tolerance normalization, HbA1c reduction and pancreas islets protection than liraglutide. The present research showed that combined dimerization and lipidization is effective when applied to Xenopus GLP-1 analogue to develop novel GLP-1 analogue for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In addition, the promising preclinical data of 6 suggested the therapeutic potential of 6 as a novel anti-diabetic agent.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Diet-induced  models (DIO) show that changes in hypothalamic mitochondria fusion and fission dynamics modulate metabolic dysfunction. Using three selective diet formula including a High fat diet (HFD), Cafeteria (CAF) and High Sugar Diet (HSD), we hypothesized that maternal diets exposure program leads to selective changes in hypothalamic mitochondria fusion and fission dynamics in male offspring leading to metabolic dysfunction which is exacerbated by a second exposure after weaning.We exposed female Wistar rats to nutritional programming including Chow, HFD, CAF, or HSD for 9 weeks (pre-mating, mating, pregnancy and lactation) or to the same diets to offspring after weaning. We determined body weight, food intake and metabolic parameters in the offspring from 21 to 60 days old. Hypothalamus was dissected at 60 days old to determine mitochondria-ER interaction markers by mRNA expression and western blot and morphology by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Mitochondrial-ER function was analyzed by confocal microscopy using hypothalamic cell line mHypoA-CLU192.Maternal programming by HFD and CAF leads to failure in glucose, leptin and insulin sensitivity and fat accumulation. Additionally, HFD and CAF programming promote mitochondrial fusion by increasing the expression of MFN2 and decreasing DRP1, respectively. Further, TEM analysis confirms that CAF exposure after programing leads to an increase in mitochondria fusion and enhanced mitochondrial-ER interaction, which partially correlates with metabolic dysfunction and fat accumulation in the HFD and CAF groups. Finally, we identified that lipotoxic  stimulus in hypothalamic cells increases Ca overload into mitochondria matrix leading to mitochondrial dysfunction.We concluded that maternal programming by HFD induces hypothalamic mitochondria fusion, metabolic dysfunction and fat accumulation in male offspring, which is exacerbated by HFD or CAF exposure after weaning, potentially due to mitochondria calcium overflux.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30384366>Shengmai San Alleviates Diabetic Cardiomyopathy Through Improvement of Mitochondrial Lipid Metabolic Disorder.</a></h2><p>Shengmai San (SMS), prepared from Panax ginseng, Ophiopogon japonicus, and Schisandra chinensisin, has been widely used to treat ischemic disease. In this study, we investigated whether SMS may exert a beneficial effect in diabetic cardiomyopathy through improvement of mitochondrial lipid metabolism.A leptin receptor-deficient db/db mouse model was utilized, and lean age-matched C57BLKS mice served as non-diabetic controls. Glucose and lipid profiles, myocardial structure, dimension, and function, and heart weight to tibial length ratio were determined. Myocardial ultrastructural morphology was observed with transmission electron microscopy. Protein expression and activity of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex were assessed using western blotting and microplate assay kits. We also observed cellular viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, OXPHOS complex activity, and cellular ATP level in -stimulated H9C2 cardiomyocytes. Changes in the sirtuin (SIRT1)/AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) pathway and mitochondrial uncoupling signaling were assessed using western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR.Leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice exhibit , hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia, accompanied by distinct myocardial hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction. SMS at a dose of 3 g/kg body weight contributed to a recovery of diabetes-induced myocardial hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction. SMS administration led to an effective restoration of mitochondrial structure and function both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, SMS markedly enhanced SIRT1 and p-AMPKα protein levels and decreased the expression of acetylated-PGC-1α and uncoupling protein 2 protein. SMS also restored the depletion of NRF1 and TFAM levels in diabetic hearts and H9C2 cardiomyocytes.The results indicate that SMS may alleviate diabetes-induced myocardial hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction by improving mitochondrial lipid metabolism.© 2018 The Author(s).

Some mice develop diet-induced  (DIO), but others remain diet resistant (DR) despite intake of the same high-saturated-fat diet, a phenomenon that mimics characteristics of the human obese phenotype. Microbiota-colon-brain axis regulation is important for energy metabolism and cognition. Using DIO and DR mouse models, this study aimed to examine gut microbiota, colonic inflammation and cognitive function to elucidate the role of microbiota-gut-brain regulation in DIO. C57Bl6/J mice fed a chronic saturated- diet for 22 weeks showed significant body weight gain differences, with the top one third gaining 48% heavier body weight than the lower one third. There was significant reduction in gut microbiota richness and diversity in DIO mice but not in DR mice. At the phylum level, DIO mice had increased abundance of Firmicutes and Antinobacteria, and decreased abundance of Bacterioides and Proteobacteria in gut microbiota. DIO mice exhibited reduced tight junction proteins, increased plasma endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and increased inflammation in the colon and liver. Recognition memory and spatial memory were impaired in DIO mice, associated with decreased Bacteroidetes. Further examination showed that hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor was significantly decreased in DIO mice (vs. DR). Conversely, DR mice showed no changes in the above parameters measured. Therefore, gut microbiota, colon inflammation and circulating LPS may play a major role in the development of the obese phenotype and cognitive decline associated with a chronic high-saturated- diet.Copyright © 2018.

Mitochondrial homeostasis is proved to be important for maintaining the function of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), the first rate-limiting enzyme in testosterone synthesis.

In this study, we sought to elucidate the role of CypD in the expression of StAR affected by HFD.To analyse the influence of CypD on StAR in vivo and in vitro, mouse models of HFD, CypD overexpression and CypD knockout (Ppif ) as well as Leydig cells treated with  (PA) and CypD overexpression plasmids were examined with an array of metabolic, mitochondrial function and molecular assays.Compared with the normal diet mice, consistent with reduced testosterone in testes, the expressions of StAR in both mRNA and protein levels in HFD mice were down-regulated, while expressions of CypD were up-regulated. High-fat intake impaired mitochondrial function with the decrease in StAR in Leydig cells. Overexpression of CypD inhibited StAR expressions in vivo and in vitro.

However, the related molecular mechanisms are still unclear. In this research, we investigated the protective effects of theaflavins against insulin resistance in HepG2 cells induced by . Theaflavins significantly increased glucose uptake of insulin-resistant cells at noncytotoxic doses. This activity was mediated by upregulating the total and membrane bound glucose transporter 4 protein expressions, increasing the phosphor-Akt (Ser473) level, and decreasing the phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser307. Moreover, theaflavins were found to enhance the mitochondrial DNA copy number, down-regulate the PGC-1β mRNA level and increase the PRC mRNA expression. Mdivi-1, a selective mitochondrial division inhibitor, could attenuate TFs-induced promotion of glucose uptake in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells. Taken together, these results suggested that theaflavins could improve hepatocellular insulin resistance induced by free fatty acids, at least partly through promoting mitochondrial biogenesis.

Little is known about the impact of the obese microenvironment on cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) of macrophages. In this study, the CEC of obese-derived primary adipose-tissue macrophages (ATM) is evaluated and the in vivo microenvironment is modeled in vitro to determine mechanisms underlying modulated CEC.F4/80 ATM are labeled with  H-cholesterol ex vivo, and CEC and ABCA1/ABCG1 protein levels are determined. Total, ABCA1-dependent, and ABCA1-independent CECs are determined in J774 macrophages polarized to M1 (LPS&IFNγ), M2 (IL-4&IL-13), or metabolic phenotypes (glucose, insulin, and ).Obese ATM exhibit enhanced CEC and ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression compared to lean ATM. In contrast, ABCA1-CEC is suppressed from M1 polarized macrophages compared to untreated in vitro, by activation of the JAK/STAT pathway.

However, low level of vitamin D is observed in those conditions. The aim of this study is to investigate effects of 1α,25(OH) D on PA-treated THP-1 cells. Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, we measure mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines: TNF-α, Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and chemokine IL-8 under PA and 1α,25(OH) D influence. PA, at all concentrations (25-100 μM), enhanced LPS stimulatory effect on those mRNA expression compared to LPS-treated and -untreated cells. Combination with 1α,25(OH) D increased cytokine expression at high (10 M) and high-normal (10 M) concentrations compared to PA + LPS and LPS alone, both for 2 and 24 h. However, low-normal (10 M) and low (10 M) levels of 1α,25(OH) D could not enhance PA effect, but mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine was higher than LPS-treated cells. Upstream pathway of 1α,25(OH) D , which is cholecalciferol, also gave the similar result. Further, inhibition of calcium pathway does not play a role in this mechanism.

Levels of lipotoxicity-induced ISC activation and islet function were assessed via intraperitoneal glucose and insulin tolerance tests, and immunohistochemistry. The expression of lipid metabolism- and ISC activation-related markers was evaluated in cultured ISCs treated with  (PA) using quantitative PCR and western blotting. We also overexpressed sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c in ISCs by lentiviral transduction, and assessed the effects on insulin release in co-cultures with isolated rat islets.HFD increased body weight and ectopic fat accumulation in pancreatic islets. Lipotoxicity caused progressive glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, upregulated α-smooth muscle actin, and stimulated the secretion of extracellular matrix. Lipotoxicity reduced the expression of lipid metabolism-related molecules in ISCs treated with PA, especially SREBP-1c. Overexpression of SREBP-1c in ISCs improved islet viability and insulin secretion in co-cultures.These results indicate that lipotoxicity-induced ISC activation alters islet function via regulation of lipid metabolism, suggesting that therapeutic strategies targeting activated ISC may be an effective treatment for prevention of ISC activation-associated islet dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The PA-induced ROS production and lipid peroxidation was at greater extent in T98G as compared to that in SH-SY5Y.In conclusion, PA induces apoptosis by increasing oxidative stress in neurons and astrocytes.

However, even 3 days of HFD consumption has been linked to inflammation within the key homeostatic brain region, the hypothalamus.Mice were fed either a low-fat diet (LFD) or HFD containing 10% or 60% (Kcal) respectively from fat for 3 days. Mice were weighed, food intake measured and glucose tolerance calculated using intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IPGTT). Proteomic analysis was carried out to determine if hypothalamic proteins were changed by a HFD. The direct effects of dietary fatty acids on mitochondrial morphology and on one of the proteins most changed by a HFD, dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2 (DRP-2) a microtubule-associated protein which regulates microtubule dynamics, were also tested in mHypoE-N42 (N42) neuronal cells challenged with  (PA) and oleic  (OA).Mice on the HFD, as expected, showed increased adiposity and glucose intolerance. Hypothalamic proteomic analysis revealed changes in 104 spots after 3 days on HFD, which, when identified by LC/MS/MS, were found to represent 78 proteins mainly associated with cytoskeleton and synaptic plasticity, stress response, glucose metabolism and mitochondrial function. Over half of the changed proteins have also been reported to be changed in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Also,in N42 neurons mitochondrial morphology and DRP-2 levels were altered by PA but not by OA.These results demonstrate that within 3 days, there is a relatively large effect of HFD on the hypothalamic proteome indicative of cellular stress, altered synaptic plasticity and mitochondrial function, but not inflammation. Changes in N42 cells show an effect of PA but not OA on DRP-2 and on mitochondrial morphology indicating that long-chain saturated fatty acids damage neuronal function.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31443411>Augmentation of Glucotoxicity, Oxidative Stress, Apoptosis and Mitochondrial Dysfunction in HepG2 Cells by .</a></h2><p>Hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia are the hallmarks of diabetes and . Experimental and epidemiological studies have suggested that dietary management and caloric restriction are beneficial in reducing the complications of diabesity. Studies have suggested that increased availability of energy metabolites like glucose and saturated fatty acids induces metabolic, oxidative, and mitochondrial stress, accompanied by inflammation that may lead to chronic complications in diabetes. In the present study, we used human hepatoma HepG2 cells to investigate the effects of high glucose (25 mM) and high  (up to 0.3 mM) on metabolic-, inflammatory-, and redox-stress-associated alterations in these cells. Our results showed increased lipid, protein, and DNA damage, leading to caspase-dependent apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction. Glucolipotoxicity increased ROS production and redox stress appeared to alter mitochondrial membrane potential and bioenergetics. Our results also demonstrate the enhanced ability of cytochrome P450s-dependent drug metabolism and antioxidant adaptation in HepG2 cells treated with , which was further augmented with high glucose. Altered NF-kB/AMPK/mTOR-dependent cell signaling and inflammatory (IL6/TNF-α) responses were also observed.

Hypothalamic inflammation has also been related to oxidative stress.  (PA) is the most abundant free fatty  found in food, and in vitro studies indicate that it triggers a pro-inflammatory response in the brain. Melanocortins are neuropeptides with proven anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective action mediated by melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R), but little is known about the effect of melanocortins on oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to investigate whether melanocortins could alleviate oxidative stress induced by a high fat diet (HFD) model. We found that NDP-MSH treatment decreased PA-induced reactive oxygen species production in astrocytes, an effect blocked by the MC4R inhibitor JKC363. NDP-MSH abolished nuclear translocation of Nrf2 induced by PA and blocked the inhibitory effect of PA on superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and glutathione levels while it also per se increased activity of SOD and γ-glutamate cysteine ligase (γ-GCL) antioxidant enzymes. However, HFD reduced hypothalamic MC4R and brain derived neurotrophic factor mRNA levels, thereby preventing the neuroprotective mechanism induced by melanocortins.© 2019 British Society for Neuroendocrinology.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31488013>The inhibition of Nrf2 accelerates renal lipid deposition through suppressing the ACSL1 expression in -related nephropathy.</a></h2><p>  has become a worldwide epidemic, and the incidence of  is increasing year by year. -related nephropathy (ORN) is a common kidney complication of .

In this study, we focus on the renoprotective role of ACSL1 in ORN.  Electron microscopy, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, Western blot, and real-time PCR were used to detect the expression of ACSL1and Nrf2 in ORN patients, ob/ob mice and  (PA)-treated HK-2 cells. Oil red staining and Elisa Kit were used to detect the intracellular FFA and TG contents in ob/ob mice and PA-treated HK-2 cells. Dihydroethidium (DHE) staining and the MDA/SOD measurement were used to detect the ROS production. In order to demonstrate the role of ACSL1 and the interaction between ACSL1 and Nrf2 in ORN, related siRNA and plasmid were transfected into HK-2 cells.  More ROS production and renal lipid deposition have been found in ORN patients, ob/ob mice and PA-treated HK-2 cells. Compared with control, all the expression of ACSL1and Nrf2 were down-regulated in ORN patients, ob/ob mice and PA-treated HK-2 cells. The Nrf2 could regulate the expression of ACSL1 and the ACSL1 played the direct role in renal lipid deposition.  The Nrf2 is inhibited in ORN, resulting more ROS production and oxidative stress.

AMPK, the mediator of macroautophage, has been reported to be inactivated in HFD-caused renal injury. However, PAX2, the mediator for CMA, has not been reported in HFD-caused renal injury. Here we report that HFD-caused renal injury involved the inactivation of Pax2 and Ampk, and the activation of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), in a murine model. Specifically, mice fed on an HFD for 2, 4, and 8 wk showed time-dependent renal injury, the significant decrease in renal Pax2 and Ampk at both mRNA and protein levels, and a significant increase in renal sEH at mRNA, protein, and molecular levels. Also, administration of an sEH inhibitor, 1-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1-propionylpiperidin-4-yl)urea, significantly attenuated the HFD-caused renal injury, decreased renal sEH consistently at mRNA and protein levels, modified the renal levels of sEH-mediated epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs) as expected, and increased renal Pax2 and Ampk at mRNA and/or protein levels. Furthermore,  (PA) treatment caused significant increase in , and decrease in both Pax2 and Ampk in murine renal mesangial cells (mRMCs) time- and dose-dependently.

Adult rat cardiomyocytes were pretreated with resveratrol (Resv) and then treated with PA. For the reversal study, cardiomyocytes were incubated with PA prior to treatment with Resv. Cardiomyocyte contractility, ratio of rod- to round-shaped cardiomyocytes, and Hoechst staining were used to measure functional and morphological changes in cardiomyocytes. Protein expression of sarco-endoplasmic reticulum ATPase 2a (SERCA2a), native phospholamban (PLB) and phosphorylated PLB (pPLB ser16 and pPLB thr17), and troponin I (TnI) and phosphorylated TnI (pTnI) were measured. SERCA2a activity was also measured. Our results show that PA (200 μM) decreased the rate of cardiomyocyte relaxation, reduced the number of rod-shaped cardiomyocytes, and increased the number of cells with condensed nuclei; pre-treating cardiomyocytes with Resv significantly prevented these changes. Post-treatment with Resv did not reverse morphological changes induced by PA. Protein expression levels of SERCA2a, PLB, pPLBs, TnI, and pTnI were unchanged by PA or Resv.

Previous studies indicate that PA accumulates in the hypothalamus following consumption of HFDs; in addition, HFDs consumption inhibits autophagy and reduces insulin sensitivity. Whether malfunction of autophagy specifically in hypothalamic neurons decreases insulin sensitivity remains unknown. PA does activate the Free Fatty  Receptor 1 (FFAR1), also known as G protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40); however, whether FFAR1 mediates the effects of PA on hypothalamic autophagy and insulin sensitivity has not been shown. Here, we demonstrate that exposure to PA inhibits the autophagic flux and reduces insulin sensitivity in a cellular model of hypothalamic neurons (N43/5 cells). Furthermore, we show that inhibition of autophagy and the autophagic flux reduces insulin sensitivity in hypothalamic neuronal cells. Interestingly, the inhibition of the autophagic flux, and the reduction in insulin sensitivity are prevented by pharmacological inhibition of FFAR1. Our findings show that dysregulation of autophagy reduces insulin sensitivity in hypothalamic neuronal cells. In addition, our data suggest FFAR1 mediates the ability of PA to inhibit autophagic flux and reduce insulin sensitivity in hypothalamic neuronal cells.

Although we have previously shown that  (PA), a saturated fatty  (SFA) elevated in plasma of type 2 diabetes mellitus and morbid , induces apoptosis in cardiomyocytes via p38α MAPK-dependent signaling, the downstream cascade events that cause cell death remain unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate mechanisms involved in -induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Human adult ventricular cardiomyocyte line (AC16 cells) exposed to high physiological levels of PA for 16 h showed enhanced transcription and phosphorylation of c-fos and c-jun subunits of AP-1 and transcription of caspase 8. When AC16 cells were transfected with small interfering RNA specific against p38α MAPK (si-p38α) for 24 or 48 h, the amplified phosphorylation of c-fos was dose-dependently attenuated, and procaspase 8 was dose-dependently reduced. With translational knockdown of c-fos, PA-induced apoptosis was diminished. Inhibition of caspase 8 for 24 h reduced apoptosis in PA-treated cardiomyocytes. These findings provide evidence for induction of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes exposed to high SFA by a novel pathway requiring activation of c-fos/AP-1 and caspase 8.

OPN gene and protein expression was examined in the kidney of Zucker diabetic (ZD) rats and cultured proximal tubular cells exposed to either bovine serum albumin (BSA) or BSA conjugated with  (PA), the most abundant saturated plasma FA. Real-time PCR analysis confirmed an upregulation of renal cortical OPN gene correlated with albuminuria and nephropathy progression in ZD rats at the age of 7-20 weeks. Immunofluorescence staining of kidney sections revealed a massive induction of OPN protein in albumin-overloaded proximal tubules of ZD rats.

After we confirmed that there is an interesting difference between regular-chow-fed mice and HFD-induced obese mice in the expression of PINK1 and Parkin in vivo, we further tested the expression of PINK1 and Parkin in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes in vitro by treating cells with  (PA) to induce metabolic stress. To better understand the role of PINK1 and Parkin in metabolic stress, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) of PINK1 and Parkin followed by PA treatment. Our results showed that under lower concentrations of PA, PINK1 and Parkin can be activated and play a protective role in resisting the harmful effects of PA, including protecting the mitochondrial function and resisting cellular death, while under higher concentrations of PA, the expression of PINK1 and Parkin can be inhibited. These results suggest that PINK1-Parkin can protect mitochondrial function against metabolic stress induced by  or PA to a certain degree.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) is a mitochondrial enzyme with some promises in a number of cardiovascular diseases. This study was designed to evaluate the impact of ALDH2 on cardiac remodeling and contractile property in high fat diet-induced .Wild-type (WT) and ALDH2 transgenic mice were fed low (10% calorie from fat) or high (45% calorie from fat) fat diet for 5 months prior to the assessment of cardiac geometry and function using echocardiography, IonOptix system, Lectin, and Masson Trichrome staining. Western blot analysis was employed to evaluate autophagy, CaM kinase II, PGC-1α, histone H3K9 methyltransferase SUV39H, and Sirt-1.Our data revealed that high fat diet intake promoted weight gain, cardiac remodeling (hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis, p < 0.0001) and contractile dysfunction (reduced fractional shortening (p < 0.0001), cardiomyocyte function (p < 0.0001), and intracellular Ca handling (p = 0.0346)), mitochondrial injury (elevated O levels, suppressed PGC-1α, and enhanced PGC-1α acetylation, p < 0.0001), elevated SUV39H, suppressed Sirt1, autophagy and phosphorylation of AMPK and CaM kinase II, the effects of which were negated by ALDH2 (p ≤ 0.0162). In vitro incubation of the ALDH2 activator Alda-1 rescued against -induced changes in cardiomyocyte function, the effect of which was nullified by the Sirt-1 inhibitor nicotinamide and the CaM kinase II inhibitor KN-93 (p < 0.0001). The SUV39H inhibitor chaetocin mimicked Alda-1-induced protection again  (p < 0.0001). Examination in overweight human revealed an inverse correlation between diastolic cardiac function and ALDH2 gene mutation (p < 0.05).Taken together, these data suggest that ALDH2 serves as an indispensable factor against cardiac anomalies in diet-induced  through a mechanism related to autophagy regulation and facilitation of the SUV39H-Sirt1-dependent PGC-1α deacetylation.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28971573>Apigenin Ameliorates the -Induced Skeletal Muscle Atrophy by Attenuating Mitochondrial Dysfunction in the Muscle of Obese Mice.</a></h2><p>It was investigated whether apigenin (AP) protected against skeletal muscle atrophy induced by .Mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 9 weeks to induce , and then were assigned to two groups; the HFD group received a high-fat diet, and the HFD+AP group received a 0.1% AP-containing HFD. After additional feeding of the experimental diet for 8 weeks, mice in the HFD group were highly obese compared with the mice in the standard diet fed mice group. The mice in the AP-treated group showed less fat pad accumulation and less inflammatory cytokines without body weight reduction. The weight of skeletal muscle in the AP group tended to increase as compared with that of the HFD group. Furthermore, AP reduced the expression of atrophic genes, including MuRF1 and Atrogin-1, but increased the exercise capacity. The mitochondrial function and mitochondrial biogenesis were enhanced by AP. In cultured C2C12 cells, AP also suppressed -induced muscle atrophy and mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, AP activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the C2C12 and the muscle of HFD-induced obese mice.The results suggested that AP ameliorated the -induced skeletal muscle atrophy by attenuating mitochondrial dysfunction.© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Our work demonstrated that different fatty acids differentially modulate metabolic-inflammation, initially focusing on Nod-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing three protein (NLRP3) inflammasome mediated IL-1β biology and insulin signalling.

To investigate its antihyperlipidemic effect, a crude lipophilic extract and the composing compounds were isolated and fractioned from the petroleum ether extract of aerial parts of  using column chromatography on silica gel. The anti-hyperlipidemia effect was studied in a rat model of acute hyperlipidemia, which was induced by triton WR-1339. A new compound, integrinol (), together with nine known compounds, namely chamazulene (), acetylenes (E)-2 (), acetylenes (E)-3 (), eugenol (),  (), oleic  (), linoleic  (), linolenic  () and 12,13-epoxylinolenic  were isolated from the crude lipophilic extract of A. integrifolia. The LD50 value of the crude extract was more than 4g/kg. In Triton WR-1339-induced acute hyperlipidemia model, the crude lipophilic extract (200 mg/kg) significantly reduced total cholesterol (TC) by 70% ( ≤ 0.01) and triglycerides (TGs) by 94% ( ≤ 0.001). The fractioned compounds, such as chamazulene (1), acetylene-2 (2), and linolenic  (9), used at 4 mg/kg dose, also significantly decreased the concentrations of TC (32%, 33% and 64%, respectively) and TGs (48%, 33% and 93%, respectively). These compounds (i.e., chamazulene, acetylenes (E)-2, and linolenic ) were considered to be responsible for the bioactive antihyperlipidemic effect. In conclusion, the crude lipid extract of Artemisia integrifolia L could be used as a potential treatment to avert hyperlipidemia.

Our results revealed hepatic steatosis was apparently induced by HFD and it was significantly reversed by pioglitazone. The serum insulin and hepatic triglyceride content was significantly decreased by co-administered pioglitazone with HFD. Hepatic expression of cytosolic-lipolysis related proteins (ATGL, HSL), β-oxidation (CPT-1A) and autophagy-related proteins (ATG7, LC3, LAL) was significantly enhanced by pioglitazone. Knockdown PPARα/PPARγ in AML12 cells significantly and proportionally reduced the expressions of ATGL, CPT-1A and LC3II, which was induced by pioglitazone. Furthermore, facilitation of the autophagic flux by pioglitazone was obviously blocked by lysosomal inhibitor, leupeptin, to demonstrate accumulation of the LC3II and intracellular lipid in AML12 cells.

Clinically, the IDD group showed increased age, BMI and serum triglyceride. Triglyceride was a significant risk factor for IDD even after correction for BMI and age (P = 0.007).

HFD rats had significantly higher serum levels of lipids, including triglyceride and non-esterified fatty , and showed significantly decreased markers of anabolism, increased catabolism and apoptosis in disk. Finally, rat nucleus pulposus (NP) cells were stimulated  with a fatty  (, PA) to gauge its effects on cell metabolism and apoptosis.

Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a pleiotropic cytokine frequently featured in stem cell therapy with distinct renotropic benefits. This study aims to define the potential link between human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived mesenchymal stem cells (iPS-MSCs)/bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) and ER stress in lipotoxic kidney injury induced by  (PA) in renal tubular cells and by high-fat diet (HFD) in mice. iPS-MSCs or BM-MSCs alleviated ER stress (by preventing induction of Bip, chop, and unfolded protein response), inflammation (Il6, Cxcl1, and Cxcl2), and apoptosis (Bax/Bcl2 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling-positive cells) in renal cortex of animals exposed to HFD thus mitigating histologic damage and albuminuria, via activating HGF/c-Met paracrine signaling that resulted in enhanced HGF secretion in the glomerular compartment and c-Met expression in the tubules. Coculture experiments identified glomerular endothelial cells (GECs) to be the exclusive source of glomerular HGF when incubated with either iPS-MSCs or BM-MSCs in the presence of PA. Furthermore, both GEC-derived HGF and exogenous recombinant HGF attenuated PA-induced ER stress in cultured tubular cells, and this effect was abrogated by a neutralizing anti-HGF antibody. Taken together, this study is the first to demonstrate that MSCs ameliorate lipotoxic kidney injury via a novel microenvironment-dependent paracrine HGF/c-Met signaling mechanism to suppress ER stress and its downstream pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic consequences.

Low molecular weight fucoidan (LMWF), a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from brown seaweeds, has shown strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, which has not been explored in diabetes-induced NAFLD. Therefore, the present study sought to determine whether LMWF protects obese diabetic db/db mice against NAFLD. Results showed LMWF administration decreased plasma level of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total cholesterol, and triglyceride, as well as alleviated hepatic accumulation of triglyceride and total cholesterol in db/db mice. LMWF also ameliorated hepatic oxidative stress by suppressing superoxide production and lipid peroxidation, and increasing catalase and superoxide dismutase activity in the liver of db/db mice. Furthermore, LMWF down-regulated several pro-inflammatory cytokines and transcription factor, and up-regulated the anti-inflammatory adiponectin. These changes were accompanied by the activation of hepatic SIRT1/AMPK/PGC1α signaling with LMWF treatment. In addition, blocking SIRT1 or AMPK by inhibitor notably abolished LMWF-elicited protection against -induced oxidative stress and inflammation in hepatocytes. These results suggest LMWF prevents NAFLD in db/db mice by activation of SIRT1/AMPK/PGC1α signaling pathway, which prevents lipotoxicity-related oxidative stress and inflammation. Therefore, LMWF provides a potential supplementary treatment for /diabetes-induced NAFLD.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Intra- and extracellular sphingolipid concentrations were assessed by high performance liquid chromatography. The expression of sphingolipid pathway enzymes, apoptosis and insulin signaling pathway proteins and glucose metabolism regulators were evaluated by Western Blot.In HepG2 cells, a considerable augmentation of intracellular ceramide and sphingosine concentration in ENL with PA group were indicated with simultaneous increase in extracellular ceramide concentration. The ENL treatment increased expression of selected enzymes from de novo ceramide synthesis pathway with lower expression of ceramide transfer protein. We also observed a decreased expression of insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of AKT and AMPK after exposure to ENL with PA. Our research demonstrated that ENL with PA resulted in an increased expression of caspase-3.Enterolactone, in a higher fatty acids availability, led to the development of hepatic IR in HepG2 cells.

Some studies demonstrated that saturated fatty acids (SFA) are considered detrimental for treating these disorders. A high fat diet rich in , a SFA, is associated with lower insulin sensitivity and it may also increase atherosclerosis parameters.

Previous studies have shown that PA exerts proinflammatory actions and reduces cell viability in astrocyte cultures. In this study, we have assessed whether an alteration in autophagy is involved in the effects of PA on astrocytes. Primary astrocytes were obtained from the cerebral cortex of male and female CD1 mouse pups and were incubated for 4.5 or 24 h with 250-500 μM PA. PA increased the levels of LC3-II, an autophagosome marker, and reduced LC3-II flux in astrocytes, suggesting a blockade of autophagy. This effect was observed both after 4.5 and 24 h of treatment with PA. PA had additional effects after treatment for 24 h, increasing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, decreasing cell viability, and increasing the levels of an endoplasmic reticulum stress marker. In addition, PA decreased the expression of estrogen receptors, but only in female astrocytes. However, the treatment with estradiol, estrogen receptor agonists, or inhibitor of estradiol synthesis did not counteract the action of PA on cell viability. Rapamycin, an autophagy inducer, was unable to prevent the effect of PA on cell viability. In addition, hydroxychloroquine, an autophagy blocker, did not cause per se astrocyte death. These findings suggest that the effect of PA on autophagy is not sufficient to induce astrocyte loss, which is only observed when prolonged PA treatment causes other alterations in astrocytes, such as increased inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30183308>Palmitate-Induced Insulin Hypersecretion and Later Secretory Decline Associated with Changes in Protein Expression Patterns in Human Pancreatic Islets.</a></h2><p>In obese children with high circulating concentrations of free fatty  palmitate, we have observed that insulin levels at fasting and in response to a glucose challenge were several times higher than in obese children with low concentrations of the fatty  as well as in lean controls.

Notably, expression of nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (NR4A1) was increased in the retina of mice fed a HFD and NR4A1 expression was sufficient to promote GFAT2 mRNA expression and O-GlcNAcylation in retinal cells in culture. Whereas palmitate or Cer6 addition to culture medium enhanced NR4A1 and GFAT2 expression, chemical inhibition of NR4A1 transactivation repressed Cer6-induced GFAT2 mRNA expression. Overall, the results support a model wherein HFD increases retinal protein O-GlcNAcylation by promoting NR4A1-dependent GFAT2 expression.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

GPRC5B tightly associates with caveolin-1 (Cav1); however, the role of this interaction remains elusive. Here, we report that Cav1 reduces GPRC5B-mediated NF-κB signaling by blocking GPRC5B-phosphorylation. We demonstrate highly abundant tyrosine phosphorylation of GPRC5B is observed in Neuro2a cells lacking endogenous Cav1 expression. Reversely, exogenous expression of Cav1 in these cells inhibits GPRC5B-phosphorylation. Although GPRC5B lacks conventional caveolin-binding motif, cytoplasmic tail of GPRC5B directly interacts with the C-terminal domain of Cav1. The vacant scaffolding domain of Cav1 in the protein complex suggests a potential mechanism for blocking GPRC5B-phosphorylation by Cav1, because Fyn loses the activity by binding with Cav1-scaffolding domain. Enhanced GPRC5B-mediated NF-κB signaling in Cav1-deficient cells were observed under palmitate-induced metabolic stress. These results support Cav1 functions as a negative modulator for GPRC5B action.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Transmembrane protein 126B (TMEM126B), as a complex I assembly factor, plays a key role in regulating mitochondrial function. In the present study, the effects of TMEM126B on mitochondrial function were investigated using genetic knockout approach in HFD-induced mouse models with . We found that TMEM126B was significantly increased in HFD-treated cardiac samples. Genetic ablation of TMEM126B alleviated HFD-mediated metabolic disorder and heart injury. TEM results suggested that cardiac mitochondrial integrity was improved in TMEM126B knockout mice compared with the wild type (WT) mice after HFD challenge. Additionally, the mitochondrial dysfunction induced by HFD was alleviated in mice with TMEM126B knockout, as evidenced by the decreased protein expression levels of dynamic-related protein-1 (DRP1) and fission-1 (FIS1) and increased expression of mitofusin-1 (MFN1). The mitochondrial impairments were further confirmed in  (PA)-incubated cardiomyocytes, as evidenced by the down-regulated membrane potential and ATP levels, and by the up-regulated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and DNA damage, which were significantly reversed by TMEM126B knockdown in vitro. Finally, TMEM126B ablation suppressed mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic death in the hearts of HFD mice. Therefore, TMEM126B led to mitochondrial impairments, contributing to the pathogenesis of HFD-induced cardiac injury, and blockage of TMEM126B could inhibit mitochondrial dysfunction, paving the road to new therapeutic modalities for the prevention of -associated heart injury.Copyright © 2019.

Thus, longevity of model organisms is increased by extra supply of the most abundant natural cis-unsaturated fatty , oleic , but not by that of the most abundant saturated fatty , . Here, we systematically compared the capacity of different saturated, cis-unsaturated and alien (industrial or ruminant) trans-unsaturated fatty acids to provoke cellular stress in vitro, on cultured human cells expressing a battery of distinct biosensors that detect signs of autophagy, Golgi stress and the unfolded protein response. In contrast to cis-unsaturated fatty acids, trans-unsaturated fatty acids failed to stimulate signs of autophagy including the formation of GFP-LC3B-positive puncta, production of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate, and activation of the transcription factor TFEB. When combined effects were assessed, several trans-unsaturated fatty acids including elaidic  (the trans-isomer of oleate), linoelaidic , trans-vaccenic  and palmitelaidic , were highly efficient in suppressing autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by , but not by oleic . Elaidic  also inhibited autophagy induction by  in vivo, in mouse livers and hearts. We conclude that the well-established, though mechanistically enigmatic toxicity of trans-unsaturated fatty acids may reside in their capacity to abolish cytoprotective stress responses induced by saturated fatty acids.Copyright © 2018 German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE).

Metformin, an antidiabetes drug, has antiproliferative effects being proposed for cancer treatment. However, under intense proliferative stimulation conditions such as those found in , its efficacy is still uncertain. Thus, we analyzed the effects of saturated fatty  and/or insulin under high concentrations, with or without metformin, on the proliferation and migration of prostate cells.Human prostate epithelial cell lines non-tumor (PNT1A) and tumor (PC3) were treated with control media (DMEM, C), palmitate (100 µM, HF), and/or insulin (50 µU, HI) with or without metformin (100 µM) for 24 or 48 h.Both PNT1A and PC3 cells had greater proliferation when treated with HF, while HI treatment stimulated only PNT1A. Metformin inhibited cell proliferation caused by HF in both cell lines, but it did not block the proliferative action of HI in PNT1A cells. PNT1A increased cell migration after all treatments, while only HF influenced PC3; metformin inhibited the migration stimulated by all obese microenvironments. Both HF and HI treatments in PNT1A and HF treatment in PC3 augmented vimentin expression, resulting in a higher epithelial-mesenchymal transition (which, in turn, could influence cell migration). Metformin inhibited vimentin expression in both normal and tumor cells. Although HF treatment had increased AMPK activation, it also increased the levels of activated ERK1/2, which could be responsible for high cell proliferation in both cell lines. In contrast, HI decreased AMPK activation in both cell lines, whereas it increased ERK1/2 levels in PNT1A and decreased them in PC3 (reflecting greater cell proliferation only in non-tumor cells). Metformin maintained high activation of AMPK and decreased ERK1/2 levels after HF in both cell lines and only after HI in PNT1A, which was able to decrease the cell proliferation triggered by these treatments.Higher concentrations of palmitate on PC3 cells and palmitate and insulin on PNT1A cells stimulate cellular activities that could favor cancer progression. Metformin inhibited most of these stimuli, showing the efficacy of this drug for cancer adjuvant therapy in obese patients (a group at increased risk for the development of prostrate cancer).© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31384536>Regulation of microbiota-GLP1 axis by sennoside A in diet-induced obese mice.</a></h2><p>Sennoside A (SA) is a bioactive component of Chinese herbal medicines with an activity of irritant laxative, which is often used in the treatment of constipation and .

In this study, the impact of SA on insulin sensitivity was tested in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice through dietary supplementation. At a dosage of 30 mg/kg/day, SA improved insulin sensitivity in the mice after 8-week treatment as indicated by HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance) and glucose tolerance test (GTT). SA restored plasma level of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) by 90% and mRNA expression of  by 80% in the large intestine of HFD mice. In the mechanism, SA restored the gut microbiota profile, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and mucosal structure in the colon.

The mitochondrial response was induced in enterocytes by the dietary fat as the same responses were induced by  in the cell culture.

We utilized  (PA) challenging in mouse peritoneal macrophages and apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE) mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) to study whether L6H21 mitigates the inflammatory response. Our studies show that L6H21 significantly reduced PA-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines in macrophages by inhibiting mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) signaling pathways. L6H21 also reduced fibrosis in the kidney and heart tissues, and indices of inflammatory response in the ApoE mice fed a HFD. These effects in vivo were also associated with inhibition of MAPK and NFκB signaling by L6H21.

Phthalate has been considered an obesogen and contributing to overweight and  in children. The purpose of this study is to evaluate changes in urine metabolites in response to the environmental phthalate exposure among overweight or obese children, and to investigate the metabolic mechanisms involved in the obesogenic effect of phthalate on children at puberty.Within the national Puberty Timing and Health Effects in Chinese Children (PTHEC) study, 69 overweight/obese children and 80 normal weight children were selected into the current study according to their puberty timing and WGOC (The Working Group for  in China) references. Urinary concentrations of six phthalate monoesters (MMP, MEP, MnBP, MEHP, MEOHP and MEHHP) were measured using API 2000 electrospray triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (ESIMS/MS). Metabolomic profiling of spot urine was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Differentially expressed urinary metabolites associated with phthalate monoesters exposure were examined using orthogonal partial least square-discriminant analysis and multiple linear regression models.

Mice were fed (16 weeks) a control, low fat diet or obesogenic diets prepared with differing content of MCSFA or LCSFA in which polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (PUFA; MUFA) were kept constant. Inclusion of MCSFA in an obesogenic diet prevented hepatic lipid accumulation and lowered indices of insulin resistance. Obesogenic diets reduced hepatic levels of de novo lipogenesis proteins (SCD1 and FASN) but elevated the adipose levels of mRNA for the pro-inflammatory markers Mcp-1 and Tnfα. Lipidomic analysis of plasma indicated that MCSFA intake resulted in a different lipidomic signature than LCSFA intake, prevented elevation of pro-inflammatory ceramides, but elevated concentrations of some lipids associated with elevated cardiovascular disease risk.

In a careful review of the scientific literature, we focused on nutritional characteristics and health effects of the use of palm oil with regards to children, seeking to determine whether there is evidence that justifies fears about the health effects of palm oil. Our review showed that palm oil represents a significant source of saturated fatty acids, to which scientific evidence attributes negative health effects when used in excess, especially with regards to cardiovascular diseases. However, to date, there is no evidence about the harmful effects of palm oil on the health of children. Nevertheless, palm oil has possible ill health effects linked to its composition of fatty acids: its consumption is not correlated to risk factors for cardiovascular diseases in young people with a normal weight and cholesterol level; the elderly and patients with dyslipidaemia or previous cardiovascular events or hypertension are at a greater risk. Therefore, the matter is not palm oil itself but the fatty--rich food group to which it belongs. The most important thing is to consume no more than 10% of saturated fatty acids, regardless of their origin and regardless of one's age.

Cells were cultured in a control media or the same media containing 150 or 300 µmol/L of albumin-bound palmitate for 24 h. BO concentrations used were 0, 0.1, 0.2, or 0.5%. Palmitate induced lipid accumulation and mRNA expression of lipogenic genes such as SREBP1c and SCD1. However, BO prevented these changes. Furthermore, palmitate stimulated caspase-3 activity and decreased cell viability in the absence of BO. BO reduced palmitate-induced activation of caspase-3 and cell death in a dose-dependent manner. AMP-activated protein kinase inhibitors abolished the effects of BO. Furthermore, BO suppressed palmitate-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation through the 5&apos; adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent pathway. In conclusion, BO attenuated palmitate-induced hepatic steatosis and apoptosis through AMPK-mediated suppression of JNK signaling.

The administration of different tracer FA with similar behaviour to the mother at different time points allows the collection of kinetic information on materno-fetal transfer of FA despite only one sample of placenta and cord can be collected per subject. Computational modelling showed a good fit to the data when considering all maternal plasma lipid classes but not when based only on non-esterified FA. The novel approach using multiple tracer FA administration combined with computational modelling shows a consistent time course of placental tracer FA and predicted total FA accumulation.We analyse for the first time the in vivo materno-fetal kinetic transfer of fatty acids (FA) labelled with stable isotopes in control and obese (OB) pregnant women. Labelled FA with a similar metabolism (stearic :  C-SA; :  C-PA; oleic :  C-OA) were orally administered at -4 h, -8 h and -12 h, respectively prior to elective caesarean section to 10 pregnant women with a body mass index >30 (OB) and 10 with a body mass index in the range 20-25 (NW). Placenta, venous and arterial cord blood were collected obtaining a wide range of FA enrichments. A combined experimental and computational modelling analysis was applied. FA fractional synthesis rate (FSR) in placenta was 11-12% h . No differences were observed between NW and normo-lipidemic OB. It was not possible to estimate FA FSR in cord blood with this oral bolus dose approach. Computational modelling demonstrated a good fit to the data when all maternal plasma lipid classes were included but not with modelling based only on the non-esterified FA fraction. The estimated materno-fetal  C-FA transfer was ∼1%. In conclusion, our approach using multiple  C-FA tracers allowed us to estimated FSR in placental/maternal plasma but not in fetal/maternal compartments. Computational modelling showed a consistent time course of placental  C-FA transfer and predicted total fetal FA accumulation during the experiment. We conclude that, in addition to non-esterified FA fraction in the maternal circulation, maternal plasma very low-density lipoprotein and other lipoproteins are important contributors to placental FA transfer to the fetus.© 2019 The Authors.

We recently isolated and identified (7E)-9-oxohexadec-7-enoic  (1) and (10E)-9-oxohexadec-10-enoic  (2) from the marine algae Chaetoceros karianus. Herein we report the total synthesis, pharmacological characterization, and biological evaluations of these naturally occurring oxo-fatty acids (oFAs). The syntheses of 1 and 2 afforded sufficient material for extensive biological evaluations. Both oFAs show an appreciable dose-dependent activation of PPARα and -γ, with EC values in the micromolar range, and an ability to regulate important PPAR target genes in hepatocytes and adipocytes. Moreover, both 1 and 2 are able to drive adipogenesis when evaluated in the Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) pre-adipocyte cell model, but with lowered expression of adipocyte markers and reduced lipid accumulation compared to the drug rosiglitazone. This seems to be caused by a transient upregulation of PPARγ and C/EBPα expression.

The liver, a primary organ for folate metabolism and storage, plays an important role in folate homeostasis. Proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT) and reduced folate carrier (RFC) are the major folate transporters responsible for folate uptake at basolateral membrane of hepatocytes. Low serum folate levels are frequently associated with . We investigated the mechanism that regulated folate status in a mouse model with diet-induced . Mice (C57BL/6J) were fed a high-fat diet (60% kcal fat) for 8 weeks. Mice displayed increased hepatic lipid accumulation and decreased folate levels in the liver and serum compared to mice fed a normal chow diet (10% kcal fat). High-fat diet-fed mice had low expression of PCFT and RFC and decreased nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1)/DNA-binding activity. Treatment with NRF-1 siRNA or  reduced folate transporter expression in hepatocytes. Inhibition of NRF-1 mediated folate transporter expression significantly reduced intracellular folate levels. These results suggest that chronic consumption of high-fat diets impairs folate transporter expression via NRF-1-dependent mechanism, leading to reduced hepatic folate storage. Understanding the regulation of folate homeostasis in  may have an important implication in current guideline of folate intake. KEY MESSAGES: Serum and liver folate levels are decreased in diet-induced obese mice. Chronic high-fat diet consumption impairs expression of hepatic PCFT and RFC. NRF-1 regulates hepatic folate transporters expression and folate levels.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30105962>7-Hydroxymatairesinol improves body weight, fat and sugar metabolism in C57BJ/6 mice on a high-fat diet.</a></h2><p>7-Hydroxymatairesinol (7-HMR) is a plant lignan abundant in various concentrations in plant foods. The objective of this study was to test HMRLignan™, a purified form of 7-HMR, and the corresponding Picea abies extract (total extract P. abies; TEP) as dietary supplements on a background of a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic syndrome in mice and in the 3T3-L1 adipogenesis model. Mice, 3 weeks old, were fed a HFD for 60 d. Subgroups were treated with 3 mg/kg body weight 7-HMR (HMRLignan™) or 10 mg/kg body weight TEP by oral administration. 7-HMR and TEP limited the increase in body weight (-11 and -13 %) and fat mass (-11 and -18 %) in the HFD-fed mice. Epididymal adipocytes were 19 and -12 % smaller and the liver was less steatotic (-62 and -65 %). Serum lipids decreased in TEP-treated mice (-11 % cholesterol, -23 % LDL and -15 % TAG) and sugar metabolism was ameliorated by both lignan preparations, as shown by a more than 70 % decrease in insulin secretion and insulin resistance. The expression of several metabolic genes was modulated by the HFD with an effect that was reversed by lignan. In 3T3-L1 cells, the 7-HMR metabolites enterolactone (ENL) and enterodiol (END) showed a 40 % inhibition of cell differentiation accompanied by the inhibited expression of the adipogenic genes PPARγ, C/EBPα and aP2. Furthermore, END and ENL caused a 10 % reduction in TAG uptake in HEPA 1-6 hepatoma cells. In conclusion, 7-HMR and TEP reduce metabolic imbalances typical of the metabolic syndrome and  in male mice, whereas their metabolites inhibit adipogenesis and lipid uptake in vitro.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31363792>The effect of  on inflammatory response in macrophages: an overview of molecular mechanisms.</a></h2><p> is a saturated fatty  whose blood concentration is elevated in obese patients. This causes inflammatory responses, where toll-like receptors (TLR), TLR2 and TLR4, play an important role. Nevertheless,  is not only a TLR agonist. In the cell, this fatty  is converted into phospholipids, diacylglycerol and ceramides. They trigger the activation of various signaling pathways that are common for LPS-mediated TLR4 activation.

In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of inflammatory response induced by . In particular, we focus on describing its effect on ER stress and IRE1α, and the mechanisms of NF-κB activation. We also present the mechanisms of inflammasome NLRP3 activation and the effect of  on enhanced inflammatory response by increasing the expression of FABP4/aP2. Finally, we focus on the consequences of inflammatory responses, in particular, the effect of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 on insulin resistance.

Serine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) is linked to insulin resistance and a number of serine/threonine kinases including JNK, mTOR and p70 S6K have been implicated in this process. Activation of the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) increases muscle glucose uptake, and in recent years AMPK has been viewed as an important target to counteract insulin resistance. We reported recently that rosemary extract (RE) increased muscle cell glucose uptake and activated AMPK. However, the effect of RE on FFA-induced muscle insulin resistance has never been examined. In the current study, we investigated the effect of RE in palmitate-induced insulin resistant L6 myotubes. Exposure of myotubes to palmitate reduced the insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, increased serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, and decreased the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt. Importantly, exposure to RE abolished these effects and the insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was restored. Treatment with palmitate increased the phosphorylation/activation of JNK, mTOR and p70 S6K whereas RE completely abolished these effects. RE increased the phosphorylation of AMPK even in the presence of palmitate. Our data indicate that rosemary extract has the potential to counteract the palmitate-induced muscle cell insulin resistance and further studies are required to explore its antidiabetic properties.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30460699>Unsaturated Fatty Acids Increase the Expression of Hepassocin through a Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3-Dependent Pathway in HepG2 Cells.</a></h2><p>Hepassocin (HPS) is a hepatokine that regulates hepatocyte proliferation. It is known that HPS plays an important role in the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD). Fatty acids, such as oleic  (OLA), exhibit the ability to activate the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3), and the binding site of STAT3 is found in the promoter region of HPS. However, the regulation of HPS by fatty acids is still obscure. To clarify the regulation of HPS, we detected the expression of HPS by western blots. In addition, a hepatic steatosis cell culture model was established by treatment of different fatty acids, including linoleic  (LNA), oleic , , and stearic . The intracellular lipid accumulation was confirmed by oil red O staining. Blocking of STAT3 activity was achieved by the pretreatment of the STAT3 inhibitor, stattic. We found that activation of STAT3 by interleukin-6 (IL-6) was mediated in the regulation of HPS expression. Treatment of unsaturated fatty acids significantly induced intracellular lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. Moreover, the expressions of HPS were increased in unsaturated fatty -treated HepG2 cells, as compared with saturated fatty -treated groups. Also, the expression of HPS induced by OLA was blocked by the inhibition of STAT3 activity. Furthermore, we found that deletion of HPS by small interfering ribonucleic  transfection decreased the protective effect of OLA on cell viability. Taken together, we provided evidence that STAT3 plays an important role in the regulation of OLA-induced HPS expression and the increased HPS may further participate in the development of NAFLD. In addition, the increase of HPS might be involved in the protective effect of OLA on cell viability.© 2018 AOCS.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28759573>Alternation of plasma fatty acids composition and desaturase activities in children with liver steatosis.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate changes in plasma fatty acids proportions and estimated desaturase activities for variable grading of liver steatosis in children.In total, 111 schoolchildren (aged 8-18 years) were included in the analysis from March 2015 to August 2016. Anthropometric evaluation, liver ultrasound examination and scoring for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD score = 0-6), and biochemical and plasma fatty acids analysis were performed. We compared the composition ratio of fatty acids between children with high-grade liver steatosis (NAFLD score = 4-6), low-grade liver steatosis (NAFLD score = 1-3), and healthy controls (NAFLD score = 0). In addition, correlation coefficients (r) between NAFLD score, metabolic variables, and estimated activity of desaturase indices (stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase-1 (SCD1), delta-5 and delta-6 desaturase) were calculated.Compared with healthy controls, children with liver steatosis showed a higher proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids (21.16 ± 2.81% vs. 19.68 ± 2.71%, p = 0.024). In addition, children with high- grade liver steatosis exhibited higher proportions of  (C16:0), palmitoleic  (C16:1n-7), dihomo-γ-linolenic  (C20:3n-6), adrenic  (C22:4n-6), and docosapentaenoic  (C22:5n-6); and lower proportions of eicosapentaenoic  (C20:5n-3) (P< 0.05). In all subjects, the NAFLD score was positively correlated with body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) (r = 0.696), homeostasis model of assessment ratio-index (HOMA-IR) (r = 0.510), SCD1(16) (r = 0.273), and the delta-6 index (r = 0.494); and inversely associated with the delta-5 index (r = -0.443).Our current data suggested that children with liver steatosis was highly associated with , and insulin resistance.

As a consequence, genetic deletion of SRSF3 in hepatocytes caused progressive liver disease and ultimately led to hepatocellular carcinoma. Here we show that SRSF3 is decreased in human liver samples with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), or cirrhosis that was associated with alterations in RNA splicing of known SRSF3 target genes. Hepatic SRSF3 expression was similarly decreased and RNA splicing dysregulated in mouse models of NAFLD and NASH. We showed that -induced oxidative stress caused conjugation of the ubiquitin like NEDD8 protein to SRSF3 and proteasome mediated degradation. SRSF3 was selectively neddylated at lysine11 and mutation of this residue (SRSF3-K11R) was sufficient to prevent both SRSF3 degradation and alterations in RNA splicing. Finally prevention of SRSF3 degradation in vivo partially protected mice from hepatic steatosis, fibrosis and inflammation. These results highlight a neddylation-dependent mechanism regulating gene expression in the liver that is disrupted in early metabolic liver disease and may contribute to the progression to NASH, cirrhosis and ultimately hepatocellular carcinoma.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29471812>Effect of weight loss on circulating fatty  profiles in overweight subjects with high visceral fat area: a 12-week randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>Significant associations between visceral fat and alterations in plasma fatty acids have been identified in overweight individuals. However, there are scant data regarding the relationships of the visceral fat area (VFA) with the plasma fatty  profiles and desaturase activities following weight loss. We investigated the effect of weight loss with mild calorie restriction on the circulating fatty  profiles and desaturase activities in nondiabetic overweight subjects with high VFA.Eighty overweight subjects with high VFA (L4 VFA ≥100 cm) were randomized into the 12-week mild-calorie-restriction (300 kcal/day) or control groups.Comparison of the percent of body weight changes between groups revealed that the weight-loss group had greater reductions in body weight. The VFA decreased by 17.7 cm from baseline in the weight-loss group (P < 0.001). At follow-up, the weight-loss group showed greater reductions in serum triglycerides, insulin, and HOMA-IR than the control group. Significantly greater reductions in total saturated fatty acids, , stearic , total monounsaturated fatty acids, palmitoleic , oleic , eicosadienoic , and dihomo-γ-linolenic  levels were detected in the weight-loss group compared with the control group after adjusting for baseline values. Following weight loss, C16 Δ9-desaturase activity was significantly decreased and Δ5-desaturase activity was significantly increased, and the changes were greater in the weight-loss group than in the control group.The results suggest that mild weight loss improves abdominal , overall fatty  profiles, and desaturase activities; therefore, mild calorie restriction has potential health benefits related to -related diseases in overweight subjects with high VFA..

Studies have demonstrated that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a crucial molecule in the pathogenesis of renal inflammation, including regulating the expression of inflammatory factors. The purpose of the present study was to further elucidate the role of mTOR in ‑associated tubulointerstitial inflammation. In the clinical study, obese and healthy subjects were recruited for physical examination, as well as the collection of blood and urine samples. Further study was performed on a high fat diet (HFD)‑induced obese rat model and a cultured human renal tubular epithelial cell line (HK‑2). The clinical study demonstrated that the participants with  had increased serum lipids, creatinine (Cr), urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) and urinary neutrophil gelatinase‑associated lipocalin (u‑NGAL). Moreover, the level of urinary monocyte chemoattractant protein‑1 (u‑MCP‑1) was increased in the participants with , and it was positively correlated with free fatty  (FFA), UACR and u‑NGAL. In the in vivo study, the results indicated that the levels of serum lipids, Cr and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), as well as 24 h urine protein and u‑NGAL, were signiﬁcantly increased in the HFD‑fed obese rats. In addition, the infiltration of CD68+ cells into the renal interstitial area and the release of interleukin‑1β (IL‑1β) was observed in the kidneys of obese rats. Meanwhile, the supernatant from HK‑2 cells treated with  stimulated THP‑1 monocyte migration. The upregulation of MCP‑1, phosphorylated forkhead boxO1 (p‑FOXO1), and phosphorylated mTOR (p‑mTOR) was observed in vivo and in vitro. However, inhibition of mTOR was able to alleviate the above effects. Overall, these results demonstrated that activated mTOR induced FOXO1 phosphorylation, which mediates renal MCP‑1 release, causes tubulointerstitial inflammation and ultimately leads to pathological renal changes and dysfunction. However, inhibition of mTOR may play a renoprotective role during the progression of ‑associated tubulointerstitial inflammation.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31140723>Myeloid differentiation protein 1 protected myocardial function against high-fat stimulation induced pathological remodelling.</a></h2><p>Myeloid differentiation 1 (MD-1) is a secreted protein that regulates the immune response of B cell through interacting with radioprotective 105 (RP105). Disrupted immune response may contribute to the development of cardiac diseases, while the roles of MD-1 remain elusive. Our studies aimed to explore the functions and molecular mechanisms of MD-1 in -induced cardiomyopathy. H9C2 myocardial cells were treated with free fatty  (FFA) containing  and oleic  to challenge high-fat stimulation and adenoviruses harbouring human MD-1 coding sequences or shRNA for MD-1 overexpression or knockdown in vitro. MD-1 overexpression or knockdown transgenic mice were generated to assess the effects of MD-1 on high-fat diet (HD) induced cardiomyopathy in vivo. Our results showed that MD-1 was down-regulated in H9C2 cells exposed to FFA stimulation for 48 hours and in  mice induced by HD for 20 weeks. Both in vivo and in vitro, silencing of MD-1 accelerated myocardial function injury induced by HD stimulation through increased cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, while overexpression of MD-1 alleviated the effects of HD by inhibiting the process of cardiac remodelling. Moreover, the MAPK and NF-κB pathways were overactivated in MD-1 deficient mice and H9C2 cells after high-fat treatment. Inhibition of MAPK and NF-κB pathways played a cardioprotective role against the adverse effects of MD-1 silencing on high-fat stimulation induced pathological remodelling. In conclusion, MD-1 protected myocardial function against high-fat stimulation induced cardiac pathological remodelling through negative regulation for MAPK/NF-κB signalling pathways, providing feasible strategies for  cardiomyopathy.© 2019 The Authors.

In our previous study,  attached to the N-terminus of PrRP enabled its central anorexigenic effects after peripheral administration. In this study, two linkers, γ-glutamic  at Lys11 and a short, modified polyethylene glycol at the N-terminal Ser and/or Lys11, were applied for the palmitoylation of PrRP31 to improve its bioavailability. These analogs had a high affinity and activation ability to the PrRP receptor GPR10 and the neuropeptide FF2 receptor, as well as short-term anorexigenic effect similar to PrRP palmitoylated at the N-terminus. Two-week treatment with analogs that were palmitoylated through linkers to Lys11 (analogs 1 and 2), but not with analog modified both at the N-terminus and Lys11 (analog 3) decreased body and liver weights, insulin, leptin, triglyceride, cholesterol and free fatty  plasma levels in a mouse model of diet-induced .

These ceramides were analysed in a population-based risk factor study (FINRISK 2002, n = 8045), in a cohort of participants undergoing elective coronary angiography for suspected stable angina pectoris (Western Norway Coronary Angiography Cohort [WECAC], n = 3344) and in an intervention trial investigating improved methods of lifestyle modification for individuals at high risk of the metabolic syndrome (Prevent Metabolic Syndrome [PrevMetSyn], n = 371). Diabetes risk score models were developed to estimate the 10 year risk of incident diabetes.Analysis in FINRISK 2002 showed that the Cer(d18:1/18:0)/Cer(d18:1/16:0) ceramide ratio was predictive of incident diabetes (HR per SD 2.23, 95% CI 2.05, 2.42), and remained significant after adjustment for several risk factors, including BMI, fasting glucose and HbA (HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.14, 1.57).

Despite considerable studies on the mechanisms of hepatic insulin resistance, the link between epigenetic regulation and the development of insulin resistance remains elusive. Here, we reported that G9a/EHMT2, a histone methyltransferase, was markedly decreased in the liver of db/db mice and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. In cultured hepatic cells, G9a knockdown resulted in downregulation of insulin receptor, p-AKT and p-GSK3β; while upon upregulation, G9a prevented the - or glucosamine-induced insulin resistance by preserving the normal level of insulin receptor and integrity of insulin signaling. Further mechanistic study suggested that G9a regulated the expression level of high mobility group AT-hook 1 (HMGA1), a key regulator responsible for the transcription of insulin receptor (INSR) gene. Overexpression of HMGA1 normalized the impaired insulin signaling in G9a knockdown hepatic cells. Importantly, in db/db mice, restoring the expression level of G9a not only upregulated HMGA1 level and improved the impaired hepatic insulin signaling, but also alleviated hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia.

Recently, autophagy has been reported to play a major role in lipid metabolism in various cell types, but its role in pancreatic β-cell's lipid metabolism is rarely reported. Here, we investigated the role of kaempferol-induced autophagy in inhibition of lipid stores, ER stress and β-cell dysfunction in -challenged RIN-5F cells and isolated pancreatic islets. The lipid-lowering effect of kaempferol was determined by Oil Red O staining, triglyceride assay, BODIPY labeling, RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis of PLIN2 (the lipid droplet coat protein) expression. Further, the involvement of AMPK/mTOR-mediated lipophagy was established by pharmacological and genetic inhibitors of autophagy and AMPK. The co-localization studies of lipid droplets with autophagosomes/lysosomes by BODIPY-MDC-LysoTracker co-staining, LC3/BODIPY labeling and LC3/PLIN2 double immunolabeling further strengthened the findings. Kaempferol treatment exhibited decreased lipid stores and increased co-localization of lipid droplets with autophagosomes and lysosomes in -challenged β-cells. Moreover, inhibition of autophagy led to decreased co-localization and increased lipid droplets accumulation. Kaempferol-induced alleviation of ER stress and β-cell dysfunctions was established by immunoblot analysis of CHOP-10 (a key mediator of cell death in response to ER stress) and insulin content/secretion analysis respectively. Together, these findings suggest that kaempferol prevents ectopic lipid accumulation and ER stress, thus restoring β-cell function through AMPK-mediated lipophagy.

Herein, early and persistently elevated, proinflammatory cytokine HMGB1 expression was detected in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD model in C57BL/6 mice. The expression and extracellular release of HMGB1 was rapidly and dramatically induced by saturated  in vitro. HFD-induced inflammatory response and liver function impairment were both mitigated after the inhibition of endogenous HMGB1 by neutralizing antibody in vivo. The up-regulation of HMGB1 was thought to be modified by dual channels: in the transcriptional level, it was regulated by JNK1/JNK2-ATF2 axis; post-transcriptionally, it was regulated by the microRNA (miR)-200 family, especially miR-429. miR-429 liver conditional knockout mice (miR-429), fed either a normal diet or an HFD, showed severe liver inflammation and dysfunction, accompanied by greater expression of HMGB1. Intriguingly, the up-regulation and release of HMGB1 could in turn self-activate TLR4-JNK1/JNK2-ATF2 signaling, thus forming a positive feedback.

The present study determined that bone marrow‑derived mesenchymal stem cells from mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) had reduced pro‑angiogenic capacity, as evident from the reduced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF); therefore, a reduced number of branches was induced in the angiogenesis assay. Additionally, the present study determined that miR‑15a, a putative microRNA targeting both VEGFA and bFGF, may simultaneously downregulate bFGF and VEGFA expression levels through the 3'‑untranslated region. Inhibition of miR‑15a using an antagonist restored the expression of VEGFA and bFGF under fatty  treatment and thus the angiogenic capacity. Furthermore, the HFD and fatty acids treatments transcriptionally activated the expression of miR‑15a via nuclear factor‑κB.

The underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Recent studies have shown that dysregulated lipid homeostasis caused by increased lipolysis in white adipose tissue (WAT) in the obese state is a trigger of inflammatory responses. We investigated the role of M2 macrophages in lipotoxicity-induced inflammation.We used microarray experiments to profile macrophage gene expression regulated by two M2 inducers, interleukin-4 (Il-4), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta/gamma (Pparδ/Pparγ) agonists. Functional validation studies were performed in bone marrow-derived macrophages and mice deprived of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 gene (Stat6; downstream effector of Il-4) or Pparδ/Pparγ genes (downstream effectors of Stat6).  (PA) and β-adrenergic agonist were employed to induce macrophage lipid loading in vitro and in vivo, respectively.Profiling of genes regulated by Il-4 or Pparδ/Pparγ agonists reveals that alternative activation promotes the cell survival program, while inhibiting that of inflammation-related cell death. Deletion of Stat6 or Pparδ/Pparγ increases the susceptibility of macrophages to PA-induced cell death. NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (Nlrp3) inflammasome activation by PA in the presence of lipopolysaccharide is also increased in Stat6 macrophages and to a lesser extent, in Pparδ/γ macrophages. In concert, β-adrenergic agonist-induced lipolysis results in higher levels of cell death and inflammatory markers in ATMs derived from myeloid-specific Pparδ/γ or Stat6 mice.Our data suggest that ATM cell death is closely linked to metabolic inflammation. Within WAT where concentrations of free fatty acids fluctuate, M2 polarization regulated by the Stat6-Ppar axis enhances ATM's tolerance to lipid-mediated stress, thereby maintaining the homeostatic state.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Nutritional priming of central inflammation and its role in ghrelin sensitivity during fed and fasted states have not been analyzed. The current study aims to identify the effect of maternal programming on microglia activation and ghrelin-induced activation of hypothalamic neurons leading to food intake response. We employed a nutritional programming model exposing female Wistar rats to a cafeteria diet (CAF) from pre-pregnancy to weaning. Food intake in male offspring was determined daily after fasting and subcutaneous injection of ghrelin. Hypothalamic ghrelin sensitivity and microglia activation was evaluated using immunodetection for Iba-1 and c-Fos markers, and Western blot for TBK1 signaling. Release of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1β after stimulation with , oleic, linoleic , or C6 ceramide in primary microglia culture were quantified using ELISA. We found that programmed offspring by CAF diet exhibits overfeeding after fasting and peripheral ghrelin administration, which correlates with an increase in the hypothalamic Iba-1 microglia marker and c-Fos cell activation. Additionally, in contrast to oleic, linoleic, or C6 ceramide stimulation in primary microglia culture, stimulation with  for 24 h promotes TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1β release and TBK1 activation. Notably, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.)  or LPS inoculation for five days promotes daily increase in food intake and food consumption after ghrelin administration. Finally, we found that i.c.v.  substantially activates hypothalamic Iba-1 microglia marker and c-Fos.

A common tool to assess metabolic differences between such cells is the Seahorse Extracellular Flux (XF) Analyzer, which measures oxygen consumption and media acidification in the presence of different substrates and perturbagens. Here, we integrate the Analyzer's metabolic profile from human white and brown adipocytes with a genome-scale metabolic model to predict flux differences across the metabolic map. Predictions matched experimental data for the metabolite 4-aminobutyrate, the protein ABAT, and the fluxes for glucose, glutamine, and palmitate. We also uncovered a difference in how adipocytes dispose of nitrogenous waste, with brown adipocytes secreting less ammonia and more urea than white adipocytes. Thus, the method and software we developed allow for broader metabolic phenotyping and provide a distinct approach to uncovering metabolic differences.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

However, the role of HPS in the development of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle under  remains unclear. The effect of hyperlipidemia on hepatic HPS expression was evaluated in primary hepatocytes and liver of mice. HPS-mediated signal pathways were explored using small interfering (si) RNAs of specific genes or inhibitors. We found that treatment of primary hepatocytes with palmitate could induce HPS expression through C/EBPβ-mediated transcriptional activation. Furthermore, increased HPS expression was observed in the liver of high fat diet (HFD)-fed or tunicamycin-treated mice. Pretreatment with 4-phenylbutyrate (4-BPA) (an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inhibitor) and suppression of p38 by siRNA abrogated the effect of palmitate on HPS expression in primary hepatocytes. Treatment of differentiated C2C12 cells with recombinant HPS caused c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation and impairment of insulin sensitivity in a dose-dependent manner. siRNA-mediated suppression of JNK reduced the effect of HPS on insulin signaling. Furthermore, the suppression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by siRNA mitigated both HPS-induced JNK phosphorylation and insulin resistance. In addition, HPS did not affect inflammation and ER stress in differentiated C2C12 cells. In conclusion, we elucidated that ER stress induced by palmitate could increase the expression of HPS in hepatocytes and further contribute to the development of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle via EGFR/JNK-mediated pathway. Taken together, we suggest that HPS could be a therapeutic target for -linked insulin resistance.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Previously, we have shown that the free fatty  palmitate induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and induces apoptosis in meniscus cells. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in these effects are not clearly understood. In our current study, we found that palmitate inhibits autophagy by modulating the protein levels of autophagy-related genes-5 (ATG5) that is associated with decreased lipidation of LC3 and increased activation of cleaved caspase 3. Pretreatment of meniscus cells with 4-phenyl butyric , a small molecule chemical chaperone that alleviates ER stress, or with MG-132, a proteasome inhibitor, restored normal levels of ATG5 and autophagosome formation, and decreased expression of cleaved caspase 3. Thus, our data suggest that palmitate downregulates autophagy in meniscus cells by degrading ATG5 protein via ER-associated protein degradation, and thus promotes apoptosis. This is the first study to demonstrate that palmitate-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress negatively regulates autophagy.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, little is known about the role of SFN in -related male reproductive defects. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of SFN on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced male spermatogenic impairment and further clarify the possible underlying mechanisms. In this study, 8-week-old mice were randomly divided into four groups. Mice were fed a normal diet or an HFD with or without SFN supplementation. Sulforaphane was subcutaneously injected at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg 5 days/week for 4 weeks beginning 8 weeks after initiation of the HFD. The results demonstrated that SFN could protect against HFD-induced reproductive dysfunction in male mice. Moreover, SFN also improved reproductive ability, as demonstrated by an increased pregnancy rate and decreased embryo resorption rate in comparison to the corresponding HFD group. We also observed a decrease in apoptosis and an attenuation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress after SFN treatment. In vitro studies of mouse and human sperm samples also revealed that SFN protects against the -induced reduction in sperm viability and motility by inhibiting ER stress in an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent manner. AMPK-dependent ER stress attenuation by SFN was further confirmed using AMPK knockout mice. Taken together, these data show that SFN protects against HFD-induced male reproductive dysfunction by inhibiting ER stress and apoptosis. These findings may be helpful for identifying new therapeutic methods to treat male infertility.© The Author(s) 2019.

Although the exact molecular pathway leading to impaired insulin signaling has not been definitively established, ceramides are suspected mediators of lipid induced hepatic insulin resistance. Therefore, the aim of the study was to evaluate the serum ceramides concentration in obese children with NAFLD.The prospective study included 80 obese children (aged 7-17 years, median 12 years) admitted to our Department to diagnose initially suspected liver disease. Patients with viral hepatitis (HCV, HBV, CMV), autoimmune (AIH), toxic and metabolic (Wilson's disease, alfa-1-antitrypsin deficiency) liver diseases and celiac disease were excluded. NAFLD was diagnosed based on pediatric diagnostic criteria in obese children with liver steatosis in ultrasound (US) as well as elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) serum activity after exclusion of other major liver diseases listed before. Ultrasonography was used as a screening method and for qualitative assessment of the steatosis degree (graded according to Saverymuttu scale). Advanced steatosis was defined as a score > 1. The total intrahepatic lipid content (TILC) was assessed by magnetic resonance proton spectroscopy (HMRS) which is the most accurate technique for assessment of ectopic fat accumulation. Fasting serum concentration of ceramides was measured in 62 children.NAFLD was diagnosed in 31 children. Significant, positive correlation was found between total serum concentration of ceramides and insulin (r = 0.3, p = 0.02) and HOMA-IR (r = 0.28, p = 0.03). Total ceramide concentration as well as specific fatty -ceramides (FA-ceramides) concentrations, namely: myristic, , palmitoleic, stearic, oleic, behenic and lignoceric were significantly higher (p = 0.004, p = 0.003, p = 0.007, p < 0.001, p = 0.035, p = 0.008, p = 0.003, p = 0.006, respectively) in children with NAFLD compared to controls (n = 14). Moreover, children with NAFLD had significantly higher activity of ALT (p < 0.001) and GGT (p < 0.001), HOMA-IR (p = 0.04), BMI (p = 0.046), waist circumference (p = 0.01) steatosis grade in ultrasound (p < 0.001) and TILC in HMRS (p < 0.001) compared to children without NAFLD. We did not find significant differences in total and FA-ceramide species concentrations between children with mild (grade 1) and advanced liver steatosis in ultrasonography (grade 2-3).Elevated ceramide concentrations in obese patients together with their significant correlation with insulin resistance parameters suggest their association with molecular pathways involved in insulin signaling impairment known to be strongly linked to pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30320914>Protein translation associated to PERK arm is a new target for regulation of metainflammation: A connection with hepatocyte cholesterol.</a></h2><p>Endoplasmic reticulum stress is a cellular phenomenon that has been associated with metabolic disorders, contributing to the development of , fatty liver disease, and dyslipidemias. Under metabolic overload conditions, in cells with a high protein-secretory activity, such as hepatocytes and Langerhans β cells, the unfolded protein response (UPR) is critical in to maintain protein homeostasis (proteostasis). UPR integrated by a tripartite signaling system, through activating transcription factor 6, protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), and inositol-requiring enzyme 1, regulates gene transcription and translation to resolve stress and conserve proteostasis. In the current study, we demonstrated in hepatocytes under metabolic overload by saturated  and stearic fatty acids, through activation of PERK signaling and CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) transcription factor, an association with the expression of cyclooxygenase 2. More important, isolated exosomes from supernatants of macrophages exposed to lipopolysaccharides can also induce a metainflammation phenomenon, and when treated on hepatocytes, induced a rearrangement in cholesterol metabolism through sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2), low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), apolipoprotein A-I, and ABCA1. Moreover, we demonstrate the cellular effect of terpene-derived molecules, such as cryptotanshinone, isolated of plant Salvia brandegeei, regulating metainflammatory conditions through PERK pathway in both hepatocytes and β cells. Our data suggest the presence of a modulatory mechanism on specific protein translation process. This effect could be mediated by eukaryotic initiation factor-4A, evaluating salubrinal as a control molecule. Likewise, the protective mechanisms of unsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic and palmitoleic  were confirmed. Therefore, modulation of metainflammation suggests a new target through PERK signaling in cells with a high secretory activity, and possibly the regulation of cholesterol in hepatocytes is promoted via exosomes.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639268>Chronic intake of moderate fat-enriched diet induces fatty liver and low-grade inflammation without  in rabbits.</a></h2><p>Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is the cause of chronic liver disease.

Rabbits fed with a moderate Fatty-- Enriched Diet 3%  (FAED), were evaluated for body weight, biochemical parameters, and liver function. Liver samples were analyzed by histology and RT-qPCR to measure lipid accumulation, the expression of inflammation-related genes IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, IL-18, COX-2, TNF-α, and TLR-4. Chronic consumption by 6-months of FAED did not generate metabolic changes, but it induced fatty liver. We also observed the development of low-grade inflammation characterized by the up regulation of TNF-α, IL-13 and IL-18. The consumption by 12-months of FAED caused the overexpression of IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, COX-2, and TLR-4. We show that hepatic steatosis is an early consequence of fat-enriched diets, and that it is accompanied by an immune response that exerts protective effects that prevent the development of metabolic disorders, such as overweight/ and metabolic syndrome. However, the excessive intake of fatty acids renders these mechanisms less efficient for delaying the start of metabolic alterations.

After 10 weeks of HFD feeding, significant increase in the body weight/fat mass, augmented circulating lipids, glucose, insulin and inflammatory cytokines along with impaired acetylcholine induced aortic vasorelaxation and enhanced iNOS expression was observed in the aortic tissue of WT mice. In the aminoguanidine (AG, 20 mg/kg for 4 weeks) treated WT mice and also in iNOS KO mice, acetylcholine induced vasorelaxation was significantly preserved.

This study examined how high PA concentration reduced mitochondrial quality in oocytes and investigated a possible countermeasure against mitochondrial dysfunction. Cumulus cell-oocyte complexes were obtained from the ovaries of gilts, and incubated in medium containing PA (0.5 mM) or vehicle (BSA) for 44 h. Culturing oocytes at high PA concentration induced mitochondrial dysfunction determined by high reactive oxygen species and low ATP content in oocytes. Furthermore, high PA levels increased mitochondrial acetylation levels determined by a high degree of co-localization of TOMM20 and acetylated-lysine. In addition, high PA levels reduced the expression of Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) and phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), while the AMPK activator, AICAR, restored mitochondrial function as well as oocyte ability and reduced the acetylation of mitochondrial protein. Supplementation of culture medium with dorsomorphin dihydrochloride (an AMPK inhibitor) reduced mitochondrial function and increased mitochondrial protein acetylation. Treatment of oocytes with LB100 (an inhibitor of AMPK dephosphorylation) reduced mitochondrial acetylation levels and restored mitochondrial function. Furthermore, high PA levels increased ceramide accumulation in oocytes, and addition of ceramide to the culture medium also induced mitochondrial dysfunction and increased mitochondrial acetylation. This detrimental effect of ceramide was diminished by AICAR treatment of oocytes.

The in vitro studies were carried out in cultured renal tubular epithelial cells, mouse mesangial cells and primary macrophages, respectively. The HFD mice presented with increased hyperlipidemia, serum creatinine and proteinuria. Renal tissue from HFD mice had increased fibrosis, inflammatory cytokines, macrophage infiltration, and activation of NF-κB and MAPKs. This HFD-induced renal injury profile was not observed in KO mice or L6H21-treated mice. Mice given PA mimmicked the HFD-induced renal injury profiles, which were prevented by MD2 knockout. The in vitro data further confirmed MD2 mediates PA-induced inflammation. MD2 is causally related with -associated renal inflammatory injury.

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether  is a causative factor for the development of depression and what is the molecular pathway(s) that link these two disorders. Using lipidomic and transcriptomic methods, we identified a mechanism that links exposure to a high-fat diet (HFD) in mice with alterations in hypothalamic function that lead to depression. Consumption of an HFD selectively induced accumulation of  in the hypothalamus, suppressed the 3', 5'-cyclic AMP (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway, and increased the concentration of free fatty  receptor 1 (FFAR1). Deficiency of phosphodiesterase 4A (PDE4A), an enzyme that degrades cAMP and modulates stimulatory regulative G protein (Gs)-coupled G protein-coupled receptor signaling, protected animals either from genetic- or dietary-induced depression phenotype. These findings suggest that dietary intake of saturated fats disrupts hypothalamic functions by suppressing cAMP/PKA signaling through activation of PDE4A. FFAR1 inhibition and/or an increase of cAMP signaling in the hypothalamus could offer potential therapeutic targets to counteract the effects of dietary or genetically induced  on depression.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30816669>MIP-1α Induction by Palmitate in the Human Monocytic Cells Implicates TLR4 Signaling Mechanism.</a></h2><p>MIP-1α (macrophage inflammatory protein 1α)/CCL3 chemokine is associated with the adipose tissue inflammation in . Both MIP-1α and free fatty acids are elevated in /T2D. We asked if free fatty  palmitate could modulate MIP1α expression in the human monocytic cells.Human monocytic THP-1 cells and macrophages were stimulated with palmitate and TNF-α (positive control). MIP-1α expression was measured with real time RT-PCR, Flow Cytometry and ELISA. Signaling pathways were identified by using THP-1-XBlue™ cells, THP-1-XBlue™-defMyD cells, anti-TLR4 mAb and TLR4 siRNA.Our data show that palmitate induced significant increase in MIP1α production in monocytic THP-1 cells/macrophages. MIP-1α induction was significantly suppressed when cells were treated with anti-TLR4 antibody prior stimulation with palmitate. Using TLR4 siRNA, we further demonstrate that palmitate-induced MIP-1α expression in monocytic cells requires TLR4. Moreover, THP1 cells defective in MyD88, a major adaptor protein involved in TLR4 signaling, were unable to induce MIP-1α production in response to palmitate. Palmitate-induced MIP-1α expression was suppressed by inhibition of MAPK, NFkB and PI3K signaling pathways. In addition, palmitate-induced NF-κB/AP-1 activation was observed while production of MIP-1α. However, this activation of NF-κB/AP-1 was abrogated in MyD88 deficient cells.Overall, these results show that palmitate induces TLR4dependent MIP-1α expression requiring the MyD88 recruitment and activation of MAPK, NF-κB/AP-1 and PI3K signaling. It implies that the increased systemic levels of free fatty  palmitate in /T2D may contribute to metabolic inflammation through excessive production of MIP-1a.© Copyright by the Author(s).

PCa progression can be associated with . Signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) plays a crucial role in PCa growth. However, whether STAT3 plays a role in high-fat diet (HFD)-associated PCa growth is unknown. Our data show that HFD feeding increases tumor size, STAT3 phosphorylation, and  (PA) level in the xenograft tissues of the PCa-bearing xenograft mouse model. In vitro studies show that PA increases STAT3 expression and phosphorylation (STAT3-Y705) in PCa. Computational modeling suggests strong and stable binding between PA and unphosphorylated STAT3 at R593 and N538. The binding changes STAT3 structure and activity. Functional studies show that both STAT3 mutants (R583A and N538A) and STAT3 dominant negative significantly reduce PA-enhanced STAT3 phosphorylation, PA-increased PCa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In the xenograft mouse models, the HFD-increased tumor growth and STAT3 phosphorylation in tumors are reversed by STAT3 inhibition. Our study not only demonstrates the regulatory role of PA/STAT3 axis in HFD-associated PCa growth but also suggests a novel mechanism of how STAT3 is activated by PA. Our data suggest STAT3 as a therapeutic target for the treatment of HFD-associated PCa.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31073968>-Induced NAD Depletion is Associated with the Reduced Function of SIRT1 and Increased Expression of BACE1 in Hippocampal Neurons.</a></h2><p>Increased levels of circulating fatty acids, such as  (PA), are associated with the development of , insulin resistance, type-2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, these diseases are linked to an increased risk of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, mild cognitive impairment and even Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the precise actions of elevated PA levels on neurons and their association with neuronal metabolic disruption that leads to the expression of pathological markers of AD, such as the overproduction and accumulation of the amyloid-β peptide, represent an area of intense investigation. A possible molecular mechanism involved in the effects of PA may be through dysfunction of the NAD sensor enzyme, SIRT1. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to analyze the relationship between the effects of PA metabolism on the function of SIRT1 and the upregulation of BACE1 in cultured hippocampal neurons. PA reduced the total amount of NAD in neurons that caused an increase in p65 K310 acetylation due to inhibition of SIRT1 activity and low protein content. Furthermore, BACE1 protein and its activity were increased, and BACE1 was relocated in neurites after PA exposure.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31241988>Sphingosine-1-phosphate analog FTY720 reverses  but not age-induced anabolic resistance to muscle contraction.</a></h2><p>Sarcopenia, the age-associated loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, is coupled with declines in physical functioning leading to subsequent higher rates of disability, frailty, morbidity, and mortality. Aging and  independently contribute to muscle atrophy that is assumed to be a result of the activation of mutual physiological pathways. Understanding mechanisms contributing to the induction of skeletal muscle atrophy with aging and  is important for determining targets that may have pivotal roles in muscle loss in these conditions. We find that aging and  equally induce an anabolic resistance to acute skeletal muscle contraction as observed with decreases in anabolic signaling activation after contraction. Furthermore, treatment with the sphingosine-1-phosphate analog FTY720 for 4 wk increased lean mass and strength, and the anabolic signaling response to contraction was improved in obese but not older animals. To determine the role of chronic inflammation and different fatty acids on anabolic resistance in skeletal muscle cells, we overexpressed IKKβ with and without exposure to saturated fatty  (SFA; ), polyunsaturated fatty  (eicosapentaenoic ), and monounsaturated fatty  (oleic ). We found that IKKβ overexpression increased inflammation markers in muscle cells, and this chronic inflammation exacerbated anabolic resistance in response to SFA. Pretreatment with FTY720 reversed the inflammatory effects of  in the muscle cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate chronic inflammation can induce anabolic resistance, SFA aggravates these effects, and FTY720 can reverse this by decreasing ceramide accumulation in skeletal muscle.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29031723>Inhibition of cholinergic potentiation of insulin secretion from pancreatic islets by chronic elevation of glucose and fatty acids: Protection by casein kinase 2 inhibitor.</a></h2><p>Chronic hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia are characteristic features of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) that are thought to cause or contribute to β-cell dysfunction by "glucolipotoxicity." Previously we have shown that acute treatment of pancreatic islets with fatty acids (FA) decreases acetylcholine-potentiated insulin secretion. This acetylcholine response is mediated by M3 muscarinic receptors, which play a key role in regulating β-cell function. Here we examine whether chronic FA exposure also inhibits acetylcholine-potentiated insulin secretion using mouse and human islets.Islets were cultured for 3 or 4 days at different glucose concentration with 0.5 mM  (PA) or a 2:1 mixture of PA and oleic  (OA) at 1% albumin (PA/BSA molar ratio 3.3). Afterwards, the response to glucose and acetylcholine were studied in perifusion experiments.FA-induced impairment of insulin secretion and Ca signaling depended strongly on the glucose concentrations of the culture medium. PA and OA in combination reduced acetylcholine potentiation of insulin secretion more than PA alone, both in mouse and human islets, with no evidence of a protective role of OA. In contrast, lipotoxicity was not observed with islets cultured for 3 days in medium containing less than 1 mM glucose and a mixture of glutamine and leucine (7 mM each). High glucose and FAs reduced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca storage capacity; however, preserving ER Ca by blocking the IP3 receptor with xestospongin C did not protect islets from glucolipotoxic effects on insulin secretion. In contrast, an inhibitor of casein kinase 2 (CK2) protected the glucose dependent acetylcholine potentiation of insulin secretion in mouse and human islets against glucolipotoxicity.These results show that chronic FA treatment decreases acetylcholine potentiation of insulin secretion and that this effect is strictly glucose dependent and might involve CK2 phosphorylation of β-cell M3 muscarinic receptors.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate cardiac insulin signaling are not fully understood. The regulatory role of tafazzin in the hearts of HF-diet-fed mice is investigated.Mice are fed a HF diet or low fat (LF) diet for up to 24 weeks. After 24 weeks, it is found that HF-diet-induced cardiac dysfunction is linked to overexpression of the mitochondrial protein tafazzin. Increased tafazzin promotes mitochondrial fission and impairs insulin signaling, which is mediated by dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp-1) translocation from the cytosol to the mitochondria. Furthermore, knockdown of tafazzin with siRNA inhibits -induced mitochondrial fission and restores insulin sensitivity. Moreover, miR-125b-5p as an upstream regulator targeting tafazzin is identified and palmitate-induced insulin resistance further rescued.In HF-diet-fed mouse hearts, increased tafazzin contributes to insulin resistance via mediating Drp-1 translocation to the mitochondria, and a small non-coding RNA, miR-125b-5p, at least partially regulates this signaling pathway and alleviates insulin resistance.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, cell culture media typically contain supraphysiological levels of glucose to stimulate cellular growth, which also desensitizes cells to elevated glucose levels. Moreover, creating hyperlipidemic conditions in vitro requires specialized carriers because unbound lipids form micelles when introduced to liquid media. This study sought to develop a novel method for simulating DM conditions in vitro.We acclimated the CC mouse myoblasts to culture medium with 5.6 mM glucose, which mimics physiological levels, and created a bovine serum albumin- conjugate for lipid transport to explore the effects of hyperlipidemia. We simulated diabetic conditions in vitro by using both hyper-glycemic and -lipidemic conditions and compared the results to that of only hyperglycemic or hyperlipidemic conditions.Acclimated cells exposed to these hyper-glycemic (15 mM glucose) and/or -lipidemic (0.25 mM palmitate) conditions for 2 h showed increased mitochondrial fragmentation and membrane potential as well as elevated reactive oxygen species production compared to control cells. These findings suggest altered mitochondrial morphology and function, which have been confirmed using isolated rat flexor digitorum brevis myofibers. Hyper-glycemic and/or -lipidemic stimulations for 24 h significantly increased mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase MEK 1/2 protein expression, upregulated the early pro-apoptotic transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), and induced apoptosis.Our results further support and confirm the utility of this method which will allow for subsequent investigations studying the effects of hyper-glycemia and/or -lipidemia in vitro.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Intracellular lipid contents were measured by Oil Red O staining and a Nile Red assay. The body weight, relative liver weight, hepatic lipids, triglycerides (TGs), and total cholesterol (TC) were measured in the mice. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), TG, TC, glucose, insulin, leptin, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels were determined by biochemical or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Histologic analysis was performed in the liver. Western blotting and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to analyze the expression of key enzymes of hepatic lipid metabolism.LLE significantly decreased the intracellular lipid accumulation in FFA-treated HepG2 cells. LLE not only remarkably decreased the expression of lipogenesis genes but also increased β-oxidation in FFA-induced HepG2 cells. In the in vivo study, LLE treatment significantly decreased the body weight, relative liver weight, serum ALT, TC, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, as well as the serum glucose, insulin, leptin, and TNF-α levels in HFD-fed mice. The hepatic TG and TC contents were significantly reduced in the LLE-treated groups. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 1 decreased, while that of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α increased in the LLE-treated mice.These results suggest that LLE may exert protective effects against NAFLD-related  and metabolic disease.Copyright © 2018.

However, the mechanisms underlying the association between increased psoriasis severity and concomitant metabolic syndrome have not been fully clarified. Herein, we show that imiquimod-induced psoriasiform inflammation was exacerbated and prolonged in diabetic obese mice compared to that in control mice, accompanied by remarkably increased lesional expressions of Cxcl5 and Il-1b. Notably, a large number of CXCL5 Ly6G cells infiltrated the dermis and subcutaneous fat tissue of the diabetic obese mice.

Depletion of Ly6G cells and macrophages diminished the imiquimod-induced psoriasiform inflammation. Further, CXCL5 potentiated the secretion of IL-1β from macrophages and , a fatty  released from subcutaneous adipocytes, further enhanced IL-1β secretion via endoplasmic reticulum stress induction.

The increase of intracellular Ca triggers insulin granule release, therefore several mechanisms regulate Ca efflux within the β-cells, among others, the plasma membrane Ca-ATPase (PMCA). In this work, we describe that lipotoxicity mediated mainly by the saturated  (PA) (16C) is associated with loss of protein homeostasis (proteostasis) and potentially cell viability, a phenomenon that was induced to a lesser extent by stearic (18C), myristic (14C) and lauric (12C) acids. PA was localized on endoplasmic reticulum, activating arms of the unfolded protein response (UPR), as also promoted by lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-endotoxins. In particular, our findings demonstrate an alteration in PMCA1/4 expression caused by PA and LPS which trigger the UPR, affecting not only insulin release and contributing to β-cell mass reduction, but also increasing reactive nitrogen species. Nonetheless, stearic  (SA) did not show these effects. Remarkably, the proteolytic degradation of PMCA1/4 prompted by PA and LPS was avoided by the action of monounsaturated fatty acids such as oleic and palmitoleic . Oleic  recovered cell viability after treatment with PA/LPS and, more interestingly, relieved endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. While palmitoleic  improved the insulin release, this fatty  seems to have more relevant effects upon the expression of regulatory pumps of intracellular Ca.

Emerging evidence indicates that the crosstalk between adipose tissue and skeletal muscle is critical in maintaining insulin sensitivity and lipid homeostasis. The current study was designed to investigate whether myricanol improves insulin sensitivity and alleviates adiposity through modulating skeletal muscle-adipose tissue crosstalk.The therapeutic effect of myricanol was evaluated on  (PA)-treated C2C12 myotubes and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. The crosstalk between myotubes and adipocytes was evaluated using Transwell assay. The cellular lipid content was examined by Nile red staining.

Expression of mitochondria-related and insulin signalling pathway proteins was analysed by Western blot, and the irisin level was determined by elisa kit.Myricanol increased mitochondrial quantity and function through activating AMP-activated protein kinase, resulting in reduced lipid accumulation and enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, in PA-treated C2C12 myotubes. Furthermore, myricanol stimulated irisin production and secretion from myotubes to reduce lipid content in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In HFD-fed mice, myricanol treatment alleviated adiposity and insulin resistance through enhancing lipid utilization and irisin production in skeletal muscle and inducing browning of inguinal fat.Myricanol modulates skeletal muscle-adipose tissue crosstalk, to stimulate browning of adipose tissue and improve insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle. Myricanol might be a potential candidate for treating insulin resistance and .© 2019 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30604460>Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 inhibits endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated pathway to preserve nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Previous works indicated that the stress on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) affected nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, there is no clear evident on the effect of the regulation of ER stress by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the prevention of NAFLD.HepG2 cells were treated with thapsigargin (Tg) or  (PA). We analysed ACE2 expression using Western-blotting analyses. ER stress-related proteins were detected in ACE2 knockout mice and Ad-ACE2-treated db/db mice by immunofluorescence or Western-blotting analyses. In ACE2-overexpression HepG2 cells, the triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and glycogen content were detected by assay kits. Meanwhile, the expression of hepatic lipogenic proteins (ACCα, SREBP-1c, FAS, and LXRα), enzymes for gluconeogenesis (PEPCK, G6Pase, and IRS2), and IKKβ/NFκB/IRS1/Akt pathway were analysed by Western-blotting analyses.ACE2 was significantly increased in Tg/PA-induced cultured hepatocytes. Additionally, ACE2 knockout mice displayed elevated levels of ER stress, while Ad-ACE2-treated db/db mice showed reduced ER stress in liver. Furthermore, activation of ACE2 can ameliorate ER stress, accompanied by decreased TG content, increased intracellular glycogen, and downregulated expression of hepatic lipogenic proteins and enzymes for gluconeogenesis in Tg/PA-induced hepatocytes. As a consequence of anti-ER stress, the activation of ACE2 led to improved glucose and lipid metabolism through the IKKβ/NFκB/IRS1/Akt pathway.This is the first time documented that ACE2 had a notable alleviating role in ER stress-induced hepatic steatosis and glucose metabolism via the IKKβ/NFκB/IRS1/Akt-mediated pathway. This study may further provide insight into a novel underlying mechanism and a strategy for treating NAFLD.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29290354>Palmitate and oleate co-treatment increases myocellular protein content via impaired protein degradation.</a></h2><p>Protein balance is a crucial determinant of myocellular size and function. The effects of fatty acids on myocellular protein balance remain controversial. The aim of this study was to determine the direct effects of a mixed-species fatty  environment on myocellular protein synthesis and degradation.C2C12 myotubes were cultured in media containing equimolar (250 μM)  and oleate (PO) or bovine serum albumin control for ≤72 h. Myocellular protein balance was determined via incorporation (synthesis) or release (degradation) of H-tyrosine after 24, 48, and 72 h of treatment. Expression of major proteolytic genes was measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.PO significantly increased myocellular protein content at 24, 48, and 72 h. Basal myocellular protein synthesis was unchanged by PO. However, PO significantly decreased basal rate of protein degradation at 24 h and this effect persisted throughout 72 h of treatment. Expression of the proteolytic genes Atrogin-1 (MAFbx), MuRF-1, LC3, and ATG4 B, was reduced during the 72 h PO.A mixed-species fatty  environment increases myocellular protein content by decreasing the rate of protein degradation, which may be regulated at the level of gene transcription.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have multiple beneficial effects on -associated disorders, and therefore may alleviate these alterations. This study aimed to determine the effects of body condition, fat depot, troglitazone, and different fatty acids on secretion of adiponectin, IL6 and TNFα from adipose tissue of healthy cats. Subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue samples were collected from 18 healthy intact female cats, and body condition score (Range 3-7/9) was determined. Concentrations of adiponectin were measured in mature adipocytes cultures and concentrations of IL6 and TNFα were measured in stromovascular cells cultures following treatment with control medium, troglitazone at 10 μM, eicosapentaenoic , arachidonic , or , at 25, 50, or 100 μM.Stromovascular cells of visceral origin secreted higher concentrations of IL6 than corresponding cells of subcutaneous origin (P = 0.003). Arachidonic  treatment at 25, 50, and 100 μM increased IL6 secretion in subcutaneous (P = 0.045, P = 0.002, and P < 0.001, respectively) and visceral (P = 0.034, P = 0.001, and P < 0.001, respectively) stromovascular cells. Eicosapentaenoic  treatment increased TNFα secretion in subcutaneous stromovascular cells at 25, 50, and 100 μM (P = 0.002, P = 0.001, and P = 0.015, respectively) and in visceral stromovascular cells at 50 μM (P < 0.001). No significant effect on medium adiponectin concentration was observed following troglitazone treatment (P = 0.4) or fatty acids treatments at 25 (P = 0.2), 50 (P = 0.8), or 100 (P = 0.7) μM. Body condition score did not have significant effects on medium concentrations of adiponectin (P = 0.4), IL6 (P = 0.1), or TNFα (P = 0.8).This study demonstrated higher basal secretion of IL6 from visceral compared to subcutaneous adipose tissue, a stimulatory effect of arachidonic  on secretion of IL6 and a stimulatory effect of eicosapentaenoic  on TNFα from feline adipose tissue.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29713651>Novel Mechanisms Modulating Palmitate-Induced Inflammatory Factors in Hypertrophied 3T3-L1 Adipocytes by AMPK.</a></h2><p>A growing body of evidence indicates that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) contributes to not only energy metabolic homeostasis but also the inhibition of inflammatory responses. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To elucidate the role of AMPK, in this study, we observed the effects of AMPK activation on monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) release in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes.We observed signal transduction pathways regulating MCP-1, which increased in obese adipocytes, in an  model of hypertrophied 3T3-L1 adipocytes preloaded with palmitate.Palmitate-preloaded cells exhibited significant increase in MCP-1 release and triglyceride (TG) deposition. Increased MCP-1 release and TG deposition were significantly decreased by an AMPK activator. In addition, the AMPK activator not only markedly diminished MCP-1 secretion but also augmented phosphorylation of nuclear factor-B (NF-B) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2. In contrast, MCP-1 release suppression was abolished by the AMPK inhibitor compound C and the MEK inhibitor U0126.MCP-1 release from hypertrophied adipocytes is suppressed by AMPK activation through the NF-B and ERK pathways. These findings provide evidence that AMPK plays a crucial role in ameliorating -induced inflammation.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30648905>Dietary Fatty Acids Amplify Inflammatory Responses to Infection through p38 MAPK Signaling.</a></h2><p> is an important risk factor for severe asthma exacerbations, which are mainly caused by respiratory infections. Dietary fatty acids, which are increased systemically in obese patients and are further increased after high-fat meals, affect the innate immune system and may contribute to dysfunctional immune responses to respiratory infection. In this study we investigated the effects of dietary fatty acids on immune responses to respiratory infection in pulmonary fibroblasts and a bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B). Cells were challenged with BSA-conjugated fatty acids (ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids [PUFAs], ω-3 PUFAs, or saturated fatty acids [SFAs]) +/- the viral mimic polyinosinic:polycytidylic  (poly[I:C]) or bacterial compound lipoteichoic  (LTA), and release of proinflammatory cytokines was measured. In both cell types, challenge with arachidonic  (AA) (ω-6 PUFA) and poly(I:C) or LTA led to substantially greater IL-6 and CXCL8 release than either challenge alone, demonstrating synergy. In epithelial cells,  (SFA) combined with poly(I:C) also led to greater IL-6 release. The underlying signaling pathways of AA and poly(I:C)- or LTA-induced cytokine release were examined using specific signaling inhibitors and IB. Cytokine production in pulmonary fibroblasts was prostaglandin dependent, and synergistic upregulation occurred via p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, whereas cytokine production in bronchial epithelial cell lines was mainly mediated through JNK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. We confirmed these findings using rhinovirus infection, demonstrating that AA enhances rhinovirus-induced cytokine release. This study suggests that during respiratory infection, increased levels of dietary ω-6 PUFAs and SFAs may lead to more severe airway inflammation and may contribute to and/or increase the severity of asthma exacerbations.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p></html>
