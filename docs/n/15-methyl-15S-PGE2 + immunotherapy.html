They are also one of the types of tumor with the highest cure rate, due to their high sensitivity to cisplatin based chemotherapy. Nonetheless, around 15-20% of metastatic patients will not have curative options after a relapse on the first and second line. This proves that new therapeutic options for these refractory GCTs patients need to be developed. This article offers a bibliographic review of all studies using targeted treatment or  for refractory GCTs patients.Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632619>Degradation of tumour stromal hyaluronan by small extracellular vesicle-PH20 stimulates CD103 dendritic cells and in combination with PD-L1 blockade boosts anti-tumour immunity.</a></h2><p>Highly accumulated hyaluronan (HA) not only provides a physiological barrier but also supports an immune-suppressive tumour microenvironment. High-molecular-weight (HMW)-HA inhibits the activation of immune cells and their access into tumour tissues, whereas, low-molecular-weight oligo-HA is known to potentially activate dendritic cells (DCs). In this paper, we investigated whether small extracellular vesicle (EVs)-PH20 hyaluronidase induces tumour HA degradation, which, in turn, activates DCs to promote anti-cancer immune responses. Informed by our previous work, we used a small EV carrying GPI-anchored PH20 hyaluronidase (Exo-PH20) that could deeply penetrate into tumour foci via HA degradation. We found that Exo-PH20-treatment successfully activates the maturation and migration of DCs , particularly CD103 DCs leading to the activation of tumour-specific CD8 T cells, which work together to inhibit tumour growth. Moreover, combination with anti-PD-L1 antibody provided potent tumour-specific CD8 T cell immune responses as well as elicited prominent tumour growth inhibition both in syngenic and spontaneous breast cancer models, and this anti-tumour immunity was durable. Together, these results present new insights for HA degradation by Exo-PH20, providing a better understanding of oligo HA-triggered immune responses to cancer.© 2019 The Author(s).

Patient outcomes remain especially grim for those with recurrent or metastatic disease, and current therapeutic strategies have not significantly improved outcomes over the past few decades. This has led to a number of studies assessing novel therapies. Cancer testis antigens (CTAs) are tumor-associated antigens with physiologic expression in the testis and various malignancies, including sarcomas. Genes encoding CTAs include MAGE, NY-ESO-1, PRAME, TRAG-3/CSAGE, and SSX. The importance and function of CTAs in tumorigenesis have gained recognition in recent years. They are also proving as robust diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Therapeutically, antigens derived from CTAs are highly recognizable by T lymphocytes and therefore capable of generating a potent antitumor immune response. CTAs are, therefore, promising targets for novel immunotherapies. Here we review the emerging works on expression, function, and immunotherapeutic application of CTAs in sarcoma therapy.Copyright © 2019.

Therefore, new therapeutic interventions are needed to increase the immunogenicity of tumors and overcome the resistance to these immunotherapies. Oncolytic properties of common viruses can be exploited for the priming of antitumor immunity, and such oncolytic viruses are currently in active clinical development in combination with immune checkpoint-targeted therapies. However, the routine implementation of these therapies is limited by their manufacturing constraints, the risk of exposure of clinical staff, and the ongoing regulations on genetically modified organisms. We sought to determine whether anti-infectious disease vaccines could be used as a commercially available source of immunostimulatory agents for cancer . We found that rotavirus vaccines have both immunostimulatory and oncolytic properties. In vitro, they can directly kill cancer cells with features of immunogenic cell death. In vivo, intratumoral rotavirus therapy has antitumor effects that are dependent on the immune system. In several immunocompetent murine tumor models, intratumoral rotavirus overcomes resistance to and synergizes with immune checkpoint-targeted therapy. Heat- and UV-inactivated rotavirus lost their oncolytic activity but kept their synergy with immune checkpoint-targeted antibodies through the up-regulation of the double-stranded RNA receptor retinoic acid-induced gene 1 (RIG-I). Rotavirus vaccines are clinical-grade products used in pediatric and adult populations. Therefore, in situ immunization strategies with intratumoral-attenuated rotavirus could be implemented quickly in the clinic.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

While the TME is now considered to be a prognostic tool and a therapeutic target for many cancers, little is known about its composition in pituitary tumors. This review summarizes our current knowledge of the TME within pituitary tumors and the strong interest in TME as a therapeutic target. While we cover the importance of angiogenesis and immune infiltrating cells, we also address the role of the elusive folliculostellate cells, the emerging literature on pituitary tumor-associated fibroblasts, and the contribution of extracellular matrix components in these tumors. The cases of human pituitary tumors treated with TME-targeting therapies are reviewed and emerging concepts of vascular normalization and combined therapies are presented. Together, this snapshot overview of the current literature pinpoints not only the underestimated role of TME components in pituitary tumor biology, but also the major promise it may offer for both prognosis and targeted therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636245>Virotherapy as a Potential Therapeutic Approach for the Treatment of Aggressive Thyroid Cancer.</a></h2><p>Virotherapy is a novel cancer treatment based on oncolytic viruses (OVs), which selectively infect and lyse cancer cells, without harming normal cells or tissues. Several viruses, either naturally occurring or developed through genetic engineering, are currently under investigation in clinical studies. Emerging reports suggesting the immune-stimulatory property of OVs against tumor cells further support the clinical use of OVs for the treatment of lesions lacking effective therapies. Poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC) and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), have a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Therefore, several groups investigated the therapeutic potential of OVs in PDTC/ATC models producing experimental data sustaining the potential clinical efficacy of OVs in these cancer models. Moreover, the presence of an immunosuppressive microenvironment further supports the potential use of OVs in ATC. In this review, we present the results of the studies evaluating the efficacy of OVs alone or in combination with other treatment options. In particular, their potential therapeutic combination with multiple kinases inhibitors (MKIs) or immune checkpoint inhibitors are discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648957>Recent Advances in CAR-T Cell Therapy for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.</a></h2><p>Adoptive cellular  with anti CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell has changed the treatment landscape in relapsed/refractory B cell lymphomas. They have emerged as effective therapy in patients with multiple relapsed/refractory disease, capable of sustaining durable remissions. Two CAR-T cell products (axicabtagene ciloleucel and tisagenlecleucel) are currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration. A third anti CD19 CAR-T cell, lisocabtagene ciloleucel is currently being evaluated in large clinical trials and may also be United States Food and Drug Administration-approved soon. CAR-T cell-related toxicities, including infections, cytokine release syndrome, and neurotoxicity are potential complications of therapy. With increasing use of CAR-T cells, the mechanism of toxicities and mitigation strategies needs to be developed. Additionally, reasons for CAR-T cell failure and progression following this therapy needs to be further studied. We describe the recent developments in this field, with emphasis on the complications of therapy and factors contributing to toxicities, efficacy, and resistance.

This was followed by major advances in passive  75 years ago (production of pooled human IgG for subcutaneous injection) and 50 years ago (widespread technology for producing immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous administration). More than 200 tons of pooled human IgG are produced per year worldwide. The preparation is used primarily for IgG substitution in patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiencies, as well as for an immunomodulating treatment of a growing number of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. These preparations contain the pooled IgG antibody repertoire of a large population of healthy plasma donors. This repertoire includes antibodies that neutralize pathogens and their factors of virulence, anti-idiotypic antibodies, and antibodies to other foreign and own proteins, as well as to carbohydrate antigens. Naturally polyspecific antibodies that are present in all healthy individuals play an important role as a first-line defense against bacteria and viruses. After exposure to protein-modifying agents, some IgG molecules can acquire the ability to bind novel structurally unrelated antigens. This phenomenon is referred to as induced polyspecificity. The list of these protein-modifying molecules was shown to include low-pH buffers, free heme, pro-oxidative ferrous ions, reactive oxygen species, etc. Such modified antibody preparations may have a therapeutic potential, since their administration to animals with experimental sepsis or aseptic systemic response syndromes significantly improved survival rates, while the same dose of the native preparation had no effect. We also hypothesize that the aggressive protein-modifying molecules released in sites of inflammation and tissue damage could also modify the antigen-binding behavior of surface immunoglobulin B cell receptors and the structurally related T cell receptors. This "specificity editing" of both types of receptors may play a major role in the body's defense mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633881>Cell transfer-based immunotherapies in cancer: A review.</a></h2><p>In cell transfer therapy (CTT), immune cells such as innate immune-derived natural killer cells and dendritic cells as well as acquired immune-related T lymphocytes such as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and cytokine-activated or genetically modified peripheral blood T cells are used in the management of cancer. These therapies are increasingly becoming the most used treatment modality in cancer after tumor resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. In adoptive cell transfer, the lymphocytes isolated from either a donor or the patient are modified ex vivo and reinfused to target malignant cells. Transferring in vitro-manipulated immune cells produces a continuous antitumor immune response.

Systemic treatments for metastatic renal cell carcinoma have improved recently. Vascular endothelial growth factor targeting therapies were the previous standard of care. However, immune checkpoint inhibitors used in second line therapy have now been shown to improve patient survival. We report a case of metastatic renal cell carcinoma with nivolumab as a second-line therapy after progression with tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Unusual adverse events in metastatic renal cell carcinoma, such as vitiligo, were observed in this patient who developed a remarkable documented pathological complete response to his renal tumor.  A 60-year-old caucasian male was diagnosed with a pulmonary metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Sunitinib was used as first line treatment without success. He received nivolumab in second-line treatment. He developed several immune-related adverse events, most notably vitiligo. The patient had a radiological complete response on metastatic sites, with a significant decrease of renal tumor volume and underwent cytoreductive nephrectomy after 2 years of treatment, confirming the pathological complete response. The patient remains disease-free for 10 months without further systemic therapy after nivolumab discontinuation.  Pathological complete response with nivolumab in metastatic renal cell carcinoma is rare. This case further highlights the potentially predictive role of immune-related adverse events during nivolumab therapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma and raises questions concerning the role of nephrectomy after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Further studies are needed to better identify predictive factors for treatment response to  in metastatic renal cell carcinoma, and to better understand the role of nephrectomy after nivolumab treatment.Copyright © 2019 Billon, Walz, Brunelle, Thomassin, Salem, Guerin, Vicier, Dermeche, Albiges, Tantot, Nenan, Pignot and Gravis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659324>The impact of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay on genetic disease, gene editing and cancer .</a></h2><p>Premature termination codons (PTCs) can result in the production of truncated proteins or the degradation of messenger RNAs by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Which of these outcomes occurs can alter the effect of a mutation, with the engagement of NMD being dependent on a series of rules. Here, by applying these rules genome-wide to obtain a resource called NMDetective, we explore the impact of NMD on genetic disease and approaches to therapy. First, human genetic diseases differ in whether NMD typically aggravates or alleviates the effects of PTCs. Second, failure to trigger NMD is a cause of ineffective gene inactivation by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. Finally, NMD is a determinant of the efficacy of cancer , with only frameshifted transcripts that escape NMD predicting a response. These results demonstrate the importance of incorporating the rules of NMD into clinical decision-making. Moreover, they suggest that inhibiting NMD may be effective in enhancing cancer .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658576>Management of Glioblastoma, Present and Future.</a></h2><p>Glioblastomas are the most common malignant brain tumor and despite extensive research have a dismal prognosis.

We performed capture-based targeted sequencing on tissue samples collected from 27 patients with sufficient samples using a panel consisting of 520 cancer-related genes, spanning 1.64 Mb of the human genome. We identified 184 somatic mutations in 109 genes from 26 patients. One patient had no mutations detected by this panel. Copy number variations were detected in 52% (14/27) of the patients, with a majority having advanced-stage disease (10/14). Except for the detection of ERBB2 amplification and KRAS mutation in two patients, no other classic lung cancer driver mutations were detected. Interestingly, 78% (21/27) of the patients had mutations in epigenetic regulators. Of the 184 mutations identified, 51 occurred in 29 epigenetics-related genes. Furthermore, we performed PD-L1 immunohistochemistry staining using the Dako 22C3 assay and demonstrated that 69% (20/29) of the cohort had positive PD-L1 expression, of which three patients received and benefited from a PD-1 inhibitor. In conclusion, we elucidated a distinct genomic landscape associated with pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma with no classic lung cancer driver mutation but an enrichment of mutations in epigenetic regulators.

Relevant animal models are therefore needed to enhance the efficacy of cancer . As loss of β‑2 microglobulin expression results in irreversible downregulation of surface MHC‑I molecules in various human tumors, the β‑2 microglobulin gene (B2m) was deactivated in a mouse oncogenic TC‑1 cell line and a TC‑1/dB2m cell line that was negative for surface MHC‑I expression was derived. Following stimulation with interferon γ, MHC‑I heavy chains, particularly the H‑2Db molecules, were found to be expressed at low levels on the cell surface, but without β‑2 microglobulin. B2m deactivation in TC‑1/dB2m cells led to reduced proliferation and tumor growth.

Until 2006, non-specific  with high dose interleukin-2 (HD IL-2) was considered as standard therapy of mccRCC. The transition from cytokine to targeted therapy, and now to novel immunotherapeutic agents, significantly increased the overall survival (OS) of patients with mccRCC. Currently, 7 targeted agents and the combination of nivolumab/ipilimumab (immune checkpoint inhibitors, ICIs) have been approved as first-line therapy for mccRCC. Based on evidence from randomized phase III clinical trials, sunitinib and pazopanib (Tyrosine kinase inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGF-TKIs) are the most effective first-line options, especially in favorable and indermediate risk patients. Nivolumab/ipilimumab (dual checkpoint inhibitors) seem to be the preferred first-line therapy in poor-risk patients, although cabozantinib, temsirolimus, sunitinib and pazopanib are also recommended. HD IL-2 remains a reasonable first-line treatment option in selected, favorable-risk younger patients with good performance status. Based on data of previous phase I and II studies, several phase III trials investigating the efficacy and safety of the combination of ICI/VEGF-TKI versus sunitinib in untreated mccRCC are currently underway. These emerging therapies include the combinations of pembrolizumab/lenvatinib, pembrolizumab/axitinib, avelumab/axitinib and atezolizumab/ bevacizu-mab and seem to introduce the mccRCC therapy in a new auspicious era.

Inspired by the capability of fever-like heat in inducing an immune-favorable tumor microenvironment, mild photothermal therapy (PTT) is proposed to sensitize tumors to immune checkpoint inhibition and turn "cold" tumors "hot." Here we present a combined all-in-one and all-in-control strategy to realize a local symbiotic mild photothermal-assisted  (SMPAI). We load both a near-infrared (NIR) photothermal agent IR820 and a programmed death-ligand 1 antibody (aPD-L1) into a lipid gel depot with a favorable property of thermally reversible gel-to-sol phase transition. Manually controlled NIR irradiation regulates the release of aPD-L1 and, more importantly, increases the recruitment of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and boosts T-cell activity against tumors.

Donor-specific antibodies (DSA) are putatively associated with a worse prognosis for recipient and graft after liver transplantation.To assess the immune regulation in subTCMR grafts, gene expression of 93 transcripts for graft injury, tolerance and immune regulation was analyzed in 77 biopsies with "no histological rejection" (NHR; n=25), "clinical TCMR" (cTMCR; n=16) and subTCMR (n=36). In addition, all available subTCMR biopsies (n=71) were tested for DSA with bead assays.SubTCMR showed heterogeneous and intermediate expression profiles of transcripts that were upregulated in cTCMR. Graft gene expression suggested a lower activation of effector lymphocytes and a higher activation of regulatory T cells in grafts with subTCMR compared to cTCMR.DSA positivity in subTCMR was associated with histological evidence of more severe graft inflammation and fibrosis. This more severe DSA+ associated graft injury in subTCMR was converged with an upregulation of cTCMR associated transcripts. In nonsupervised analysis DSA positive subTCMR mostly clustered together with cTCMR, while DSA negative subTCMR clustered together with NHR.T cell-mediated rejection seem to form a continuum of alloimmune activation. Although subTCMR exhibited less expression of TCMR associated transcript, DSA positivity in subTCMR was associated with an upregulation of rejection associated transcripts.

With a better understanding of the biology and genetics of tumours, the emergence of a paradigm shift towards the further development of non-surgical treatments may result in less morbidity and better outcomes than are seen currently. SCC of the head and neck is known to be a complex disease that has a sophisticated interaction with the human immune system. At the forefront of emerging treatments is , which has already been established in many other areas of oncology. The rapidly evolving nature of immunotherapeutic agents and, sometimes, their complex mechanisms can make the understanding of these concepts challenging, and could discourage clinicians from engaging in clinical trials.

Here, we investigated the suppressive effects of Tregs on NKT cells and the underlying mechanisms with the aim to improve the antitumor activities of NKT cells.Peripheral blood samples were obtained from healthy donors, patients with benign tumors, and patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). NKT cells, induced with α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer), and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) were co-cultured with naïve CD4 T cell-derived Tregs to investigate the mechanism of the Treg suppressive effect on NKT cell cytotoxic function. The functions and phenotypes of NKT cells were evaluated with flow cytometry and cytometric bead array.Treg suppression on NKT cell function required cell-to-cell contact and was mediated via impaired DC maturation. NKT cells cultured under Treg-enriched conditions showed a decrease in CD4 NKT cell frequency, which exert strong tumoricidal responsiveness upon α-GalCer stimulation. The same results were observed in HNSCC patients with significantly increased effector Tregs.Tregs exert suppressive effects on NKT cell tumoricidal function by inducing more CD4 NKT cell anergy and less CD4 NKT cell anergy.

A variety of factors such as maturation state of DCs, co-stimulatory signals, T-cell microenvironment, antigen internalization routes and adjuvants regulate the process of DC-mediated antigen cross-presentation. Recently, the development of successful cancer immunotherapies may be attributed to the ability of DCs to cross-present tumor antigens. In this review article, we focus on the underlying mechanism of antigen cross-presentation and ways to improve antigen cross-presentation in different DC subsets. We have critically summarized the recent developments in the generation of novel nanovaccines for robust CD8+ T-cell response in cancer. In this context, we have reviewed nanocarriers that have been used for cancer immunotherapeutics based on antigen cross-presentation mechanism. Additionally, we have also expressed our views on the future applications of this mechanism in curing cancer.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640925>Extensive-Stage Small-Cell Lung Cancer With Sustained Complete Response to Single-Agent Nivolumab and Immune-Related Dermatitis.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653781>IL-15Rα membrane-anchorage either in  or in  is required for stabilization of IL-15 and optimal signaling.</a></h2><p>Interleukin(IL)-15 plays an important role in the communication between immune cells. IL-15 delivers its signal through different modes involving three receptor chains: IL-15Rα, IL-2Rβ and γc. The combination of the different chains result in the formation of IL-15Rα/IL-2Rβ/γc trimeric or IL-2Rβ/γc dimeric receptors. In this study, we aimed at investigating the role of IL-15Rα chain in stabilizing the cytokine in the IL-2Rβ/γc dimeric receptor. By analyzing the key residues of IL-15 facing IL-2Rβ, we provided evidence of differential interfaces in the presence or in the absence of membrane-anchored IL-15Rα. Moreover, we found that the anchorage of IL-15Rα to the cell surface regardless its mode of presentation, in  or in , is crucial for complete signaling. These observations show how the cells can finely modulate the intensity of cytokine signaling through the quality and the level of expression of the receptor chains.© 2019.

Four cancer types exhibited a significant and positive correlation of immune response with patient age. Significant but inconsistent correlation of immune response was observed with gender, surgical stage, and TNM stage in a small number of cancer types. In contrast, the histological grade appears to have much stronger and more consistent association with immune response as compared to the other clinicopathologic factors. Specifically, patients with high grade had significantly higher immune responses than those with low grade in 5 out of 12 analyzed cancer types. In addition, both histological and molecular classifications had a significant and strong association with tumor immune response.t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding was used to assess similarity of immune gene profiling in human cancers. The Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis test was, respectively, used to compare the tumor immune response in two or more groups that were stratified by patient clinicopathological characteristics, such as gender, grade, stage (including surgical and TNM stage), histology, and molecular subtypes.

About 90% of all renal cancers are Renal Cell Carcinoma. Most cases are diagnosed incidentally. 17% of cases are advanced at the time of diagnosis. PDL1 being a trans-membrane cell surface protein is expressed on the tumor cells and is found to have a chief role to inhibit the T cell immune response. It is essential to improve the host immunity by targeting the PD1/PDL1 pathway, thereby destroying the tumor progression.The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of PDL1 in tumor cells and adjacent normal tissue among the renal cell carcinoma patients and assess the relation between the PDL1 expression and the tumor characters.This is a retrospective study. Ethical clearance was obtained from the institution. 150 histopathologically proven RCC cases were chosen. Immunohistochemistry using a PD-L1 rabbit monoclonal antibody was performed on paraffin embedded formalin fixed tissue blocks. Q scoring was done to calculate the expression of PDL1.Chi square test was done to assess the comparison between the PDL1 expression in tumor cells and their characteristic features like histology, grade and stage. SPSS (version 20.0) was used for analysis. P value <0.05 was considered significant. It also explains the heterogenous nature of PDL1 as it expressed more in the aggressive pathologic characters like high grade.Positive PD-L1 expression was seen in 44% of tumors. Significant association was observed between high WWHO ISUP grading and positive PDL1 expression (p=0.028). It was expressed in 75% of the sarcomatous type of RCC and 46.8% of clear cell RCCs.Our study suggests that blocking PD1/PDL1 pathway may become an effective mode of treatment in cancer  especially for Renal Cell Carcinomas.

A case report and a call for an update of current treatment algorithms.</a></h2><p>Epidural disease closer than 3 mm from the spinal cord is sometimes regarded as a contraindication to spine radiosurgery (SRS) or stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). Current guidelines on the management of high-grade epidural disease recommend surgical decompression followed by conventionally fractionated external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or post-operative SBRT [1, 2]. For patients with high-grade epidural disease who are medically inoperable, conventional EBRT is typically recommended, even though clinical response rates are lower and durability is limited[3]. A few expert centers use decompressive SRS in a single fraction for high-grade epidural disease[4, 5], but this technique has not been incorporated into treatment algorithms such as the neurologic, oncologic, mechanical, and systemic (NOMS) decision framework [1, 2].

Upon TCR gene transfer, presence of endogenous TCRαβ reduces expression of tgTCR due to TCR mixed-dimer formation and competition for binding CD3. Knockout (KO) of endogenous TCRαβ was recently achieved using CRISPR/Cas9 editing of the TRAC or TRBC loci, resulting in increased expression and function of tgTCR. Here, we adopt this approach into current protocols for generating T cell populations expressing tgTCR to validate this strategy in the context of four clinically relevant TCRs. First, simultaneous editing of TRAC and TRBC loci was reproducible and resulted in high double KO efficiencies in bulk CD8 T cells. Next, tgTCR expression was significantly higher in double TRAC/BC KO conditions for all TCRs tested, including those that contained structural modifications to encourage preferential pairing. Finally, increased expression of tgTCR in edited T cell populations allowed for increased recognition of antigen expressing tumor targets and prolonged control of tumor outgrowth in a preclinical model of multiple myeloma. In conclusion, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated KO of both endogenous TCRαβ chains can be incorporated in current T cell production protocols and is preferential to ensure an improved and safe clinical therapeutic.Copyright © 2019 The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy.

Functional TCR subunit genes are formed by somatic rearrangement, and some of the resulting TCRs recognize autoantigens, the body's own molecules. The autoreactive T cells that carry such TCRs pose a threat of inducing immune reactions against their own organism. In the course of the immune system's development, some autoreactive T lymphocytes are eliminated by apoptosis, some differentiate into immunosuppressive regulatory T cells, which support immunological tolerance to autoantigens, and the rest fall into a non-functional state of anergy. Suppression of effector T cells by regulatory T cells is mediated by immunosuppressive cytokines and costimulatory molecules, depletion of stimulating IL-2, removal of autoreactive peptides together with MHC molecules, and in other ways. Impairment of self-tolerance leads to autoimmune diseases. However, the loss of immunological tolerance can be employed in tumor treatment, allowing  and the use of the potential of autoreactive effector T cells.

Since these highly selective 47 nm-sized particles target exactly the site responsible for adhesion, they were more potent than commercially available therapeutic antibodies, for inhibiting cell-cell adhesion in cell aggregation assays, and for completely disrupting three-dimensional tumor spheroids as well as inhibiting invasion of human cervical adenocarcinoma (HeLa) cells.

Increasing antibiotic resistance has severely limited treatment options. A mechanism that Neisseria gonorrhoeae uses to evade complement attack is binding of the complement inhibitor C4b-binding protein (C4BP). We screened 107 PorB1a and 83 PorB1b clinical isolates randomly selected from a Swedish strain collection over the last 10 years and noted that 96/107 (89.7%) PorB1a and 16/83 (19.3%) PorB1b bound C4BP; C4BP binding significantly correlated with the ability to evade complement-dependent killing (r = 0.78; p<0.0001). We designed two chimeric proteins that fused C4BP domains to the backbone of immunoglobulins IgG or IgM (C4BP-IgG; C4BP-IgM) with the aim of enhancing complement activation and killing of gonococci. Both proteins bound gonococci (Kd C4BP-IgM = 2.4 nM; Kd C4BP-IgG 981 nM), but only hexameric C4BP-IgM efficiently out-competed heptameric C4BP from bacterial surface resulting in enhanced complement deposition and bacterial killing. Furthermore, C4BP-IgM significantly attenuated the duration and burden of colonization of two C4BP-binding gonococcal isolates, but not a C4BP non-binding strain in the mouse vaginal colonization model using human factor H/C4BP transgenic mice.

Both diseases are associated with the presence of specific IgE (sIgE) against aeroallergens. This review aims to examine the importance of molecular allergy diagnostics in the assessment and management of these disorders.The "U-shaped" approach, proposed by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, combines conventional allergy diagnostics with the benefits of component-resolved diagnosis (CRD) and offers important additional information regarding the patient's sensitization pattern, especially in complex clinical cases such as polysensitization or idiopathic reactions, thus avoiding overuse of in vitro and in vivo IgE diagnostics. CRD may help the clinician to identify the cause of an allergy and, in the case of complex polysensitization, uncover possible cross-reactivity. Polysensitization, especially to inhalant allergens, is associated with the clinical appearance of asthma and allergic rhinitis; important risk factors for the latter are the major allergens Fel d 1 and Can f 1. Importantly, information on molecular sensitization patterns significantly influences the choice of specific  and reduces its overprescription.At present, allergy diagnostics largely rely on clinical history, physical examination, and in vivo IgE testing.

However, immune checkpoint blockade is still suboptimal in HCC treatment and more immune modifications are needed to achieve an efficient therapeutic goal. Here, we investigated the combined administration of a Listeria-based HCC vaccine, Lmdd-MPFG, and the anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade antibody. We found that Lmdd-MPFG promoted the expression of PD-L1 in HCC cells but resensitized the tumor local T cell to respond to the anti-PD-1 . Mechanistically, the Lmdd-MPFG vaccine activates the NF-κB pathway in the tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) through the TLR2 and MyD88 pathway, and recruits p62 to activate the autophagy pathway. The overall effect is skewing the TAMs from M2-polarized TAMs into the M1-polarized TAMs. Most importantly, it skewed the cytokine profiles into antitumor one in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This change restores the T-cell reactivity to the anti-PD-1 blockade.

With >50% of patients now reaching a second line of treatment and a significant improvement in the survival rate, an assessment of quality of life (QoL) during the whole course of the disease becomes necessary. The objective of this study was to describe the QoL of patients with MM in France, from their diagnosis of advanced disease to their death, in real life.QoL data were collected through MelBase, a prospective, French, multicentric cohort dedicated to the follow-up of adults with MM. QoL was assessed using the EuroQoL-5D questionnaire and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment (FACT)-Melanoma questionnaire at the time of study inclusion, every 3 months, and at the time of each treatment change until death. To assess longitudinal changes from baseline to death, mixed-effect models for repeated-measures analyses were used to control for baseline covariates.QoL was assessed in 1435 patients who were included in the study between 2013 and 2018. The median follow-up was 9.4 months, and 47% of patients died during follow-up. During first-line treatment, the model-based, mean utility score was 0.830 (95% CI, 0.818-0.843), the mean FACT-General score was 77.22 (95% CI, 76.23-78.22), and the mean FACT-Melanoma score was 129.46 (95% CI, 128.02-130.90). At the time of a change in treatment line, there was a decrease of -0.027 (95% CI, -0.03, -0.02) in the utility score, -1.82 (95% CI, -1.88, -1.76) in the FACT-General score, and -2.98 (95% CI, -3.05, -2.91) in the FACT-Melanoma score compared with first-line treatment.In the MelBase cohort, the QoL among patients with MM seems to be fairly stable over the whole disease course, although a small but significant decrease at time therapy is changed is observed.© 2019 American Cancer Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651542>Identification of Different Form Tim-3 Proteins by a Unique Set of Tim-3 Monoclonal Antibodies.</a></h2><p>T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-3 (Tim-3) has been suggested to be a critical immune checkpoint target for cancer . However, limited progress with Tim-3  has been achieved over the last decade due to the lack of specific Tim-3 monoclonal antibodies. In this study, we have successfully developed a unique set of Tim-3 antibodies that are able to detect different molecular weights (by Western blot mobility) of Tim-3 proteins ectopically expressed in the same CHO cells. Some of the antibody clones detect only 33 or 55 kDa bands, the rest can recognize both 33 and 55 kDa bands on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. Antibody clones with 55 kDa specificity uniquely bind to the membrane form of Tim-3 on macrophage, which colocalizes with the CD68, and could be used as a specific marker for tumor-associated macrophage, whereas other clones showed cytoplasmic staining in tumor cells. The membrane form of Tim-3 on tumor-associated macrophages may bear significant roles for clinical application of Tim-3, but less likely for cytoplasmic one. The availability of this unique set of antibodies will be critical for an ultimate understanding of Tim-3 function in tumor microenvironment and potential clinical applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649669>Dendritic Cell Vaccination in Metastatic Melanoma Turns "Non-T Cell Inflamed" Into "T-Cell Inflamed" Tumors.</a></h2><p>Dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccination effectively induces anti-tumor immunity, although in the majority of cases this does not translate into a durable clinical response. However, DC vaccination is characterized by a robust safety profile, making this treatment a potential candidate for effective combination cancer . To explore this possibility, understanding changes occurring in the tumor microenvironment (TME) upon DC vaccination is required. In this line, quantitative and qualitative changes in tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs) induced by vaccination with autologous tumor lysate/homogenate loaded DCs were investigated in a series of 16 patients with metastatic melanoma. Immunohistochemistry for CD4, CD8, Foxp3, Granzyme B (GZMB), PDL1, and HLA class I was performed in tumor biopsies collected before and after DC vaccination. The density of each marker was quantified by automated digital pathology analysis on whole slide images. Co-expression of markers defining functional phenotypes, i.e., Foxp3 regulatory CD4 T cells (Treg) and GZMB cytotoxic CD8 T cells, was assessed with sequential immunohistochemistry. A significant increase of CD8 TILs was found in post-vaccine biopsies of patients who were not previously treated with immune-modulating cytokines or Ipilimumab. Interestingly, along with a maintained tumoral HLA class I expression, after DC vaccination we observed a significant increase of PDL1 tumor cells, which significantly correlated with intratumoral CD8 T cell density. This observation might explain the lack of a significant concurrent cytotoxic reactivation of CD8 T cell, as measured by the numbers of GZMB T cells. Altogether these findings indicate that DC vaccination exerts an important role in sustaining or  inducing a T cell inflamed TME. However, the strength of the intratumoral T cell activation detected in post-DC therapy lesions is lessened by an occurring phenomenon of adaptive immune resistance, yet the concomitant PDL1 up-regulation. Overall, this study sheds light on DC -induced TME changes, lending the rationale for the design of smarter immune-combination therapies.Copyright © 2019 Bulgarelli, Tazzari, Granato, Ridolfi, Maiocchi, de Rosa, Petrini, Pancisi, Gentili, Vergani, Piccinini, Carbonaro, Leone, Foschi, Ancarani, Framarini and Guidoboni.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646201>CMTM6, the newly identified PD-L1 regulator, correlates with PD-L1 expression in lung cancers.</a></h2><p>Modulation of Immune check point regulators, especially the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, plays a critical role in successful management of a small proportion of lung cancer patients, but not so effective in the rest of lung cancer patients. A better understanding of  non-responsive or resistant patients therefore warranted for future development of novel therapeutics. The newly identified regulator CMTM6 (CKLF-like MARVEL transmembrane domain containing 6) has been reported to serves as the stabilizer of PD-L1 and enhances the inhibitory effect of PD-L1 on immune system in both cell line and animal models, but its clinical relevance associated with PD-L1 is unknown and the current study is designed to address this question. The study using immunohistochemistry demonstrated that CMTM6 positivity from 15 out of 19 types of cancers with our in-house tissue microarray, and PD-L1 expression is always found only in CMTM6 positive cancers. CMTM6 and PD-L1 expression were analyzed in 81 lung cancer patient sample, and we observed that CMTM6 expression correlated with cancer histotypes and inversely correlated with cancer metastases, but not with patients' age and gender. No PD-L1 expression was observed in negative CMTM6 samples. Higher expression PD-L1 is also associated with higher CMTM6 expression. In summary, CMTM6 expression is associated with PD-L1 expression, as well as lung cancer histotypes and metastasis. The results thus for the first time confirmed earlier reports on CMTM6/PD-L1 connection, from a clinical aspect of analysis.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641208>A 16q22.1 variant confers susceptibility to colorectal cancer as a distal regulator of ZFP90.</a></h2><p>Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) implicate 16q22.1 locus in risk for colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the underlying oncogenic mechanisms remain unknown. Here, through comprehensive filtration, we prioritized rs7198799, a common SNP in the second intron of the CDH1, as the putative causal variant. In addition, we found an association of CRC-risk allele C of rs7198799 with elevated transcript level of biological plausible candidate gene ZFP90 via expression quantitative trait loci analysis. Mechanistically, causal variant rs7198799 resides in an enhancer element and remotely regulate ZFP90 expression by targeting the transcription factor NFATC2. Remarkably, CRISPR/Cas9-guided single-nucleotide editing demonstrated the direct effect of rs7198799 on ZFP90 expression and CRC cellular malignant phenotype. Furthermore, ZFP90 affects several oncogenic pathways, including BMP4, and promotes carcinogenesis in patients and in animal models with ZFP90 specific genetic manipulation. Taken together, these findings reveal a risk SNP-mediated long-range regulation on the NFATC2-ZFP90-BMP4 pathway underlying the initiation of CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653618>Pembrolizumab-associated autoimmune haemolytic anaemia.</a></h2><p>Treatment paradigms have recently changed with the introduction of ; autoimmune toxicities that can arise are frequently very different from the more familiar chemotherapy toxicities.

Treatment was immediately stopped and he was treated with high dose steroids to which he responded both clinically and biochemically. There have been prior reports of -associated AIHA with the use of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 inhibitors, such as ipilimumab, but very few reports of programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL-1) inhibitor associated AIHA. We highlight a rare case of AIHA as an adverse effect of pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor.

Furthermore, we analyzed six pulmonary colloid adenocarcinomas (CAD), including one primary tumor, one metastasis, and two sample pairs consisting of the primary colloid lung tumor and a matching metastasis and an acinar component, respectively. All samples were characterized using immunohistochemistry (TTF-1, CK7, CK20, CDX2, Ki-67, ALK and PD-L1) and a next generation sequencing panel covering 404 cancer-related genes (FoundationOne® gene panel).While Ki-67 expression was comparably low in IMA (range: 8-15%) and in primary CAD (range: 5-8%), we observed considerably higher proliferation rates in the non-colloid tumor compartment (16%) and metastases (72%) from CAD, as well as in the PEAD-group (36-71%). The overall tumor mutational burden was lowest in IMA (2.5 mutations per megabase), intermediate in CAD (5.8 mutations per megabase) and highest in PEAD (16.8 mutations per megabase). KRAS mutations were frequent in all three tumor subtypes, but TP53 mutations were mostly limited to PEAD. While chromosomal alterations were rare in IMA, we discovered MYC amplifications in three of four CAD. Comparing primary and metastatic CAD, we observed the acquisition of multiple mutations and chromosomal alterations. PEAD had a variety of chromosomal alterations, including two cases with RICTOR amplification. PD-L1 expression (20%, 50% and 80% of tumor cells) was limited to three PEAD samples, only. In conclusion, we provide a detailed insight into the molecular alterations across and within the different subtypes of pulmonary adenocarcinomas with intestinal differentiation.

However, little is known regarding the regulatory mechanisms of NgR in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). In this study, we propose a novel mechanism that regulates the maturation process of NgR through an interaction with vimentin. The inhibition of TGFβ1 activity by LY2109761 attenuated the migration/invasion of GBM cells by upregulating cell-surface NgR. Conversely, the treatment of GBM cells with TGFβ1 suppressed NgR maturation. We showed that NgR and vimentin interact, which could be a possible mechanism for the suppression of NgR maturation. The knockdown of vimentin suppressed the migration/invasion of GBM cells through the increased maturation of NgR. Finally, TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) analysis also supported the association of NgR and vimentin. The maturation of NgR is regulated by the interaction of vimentin and NgR, which attenuates the invasive activity of GBM, and might be a potential therapeutic target for brain cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641340>Human Papillomavirus and the use of nanoparticles for  in HPV-related cancer: A review.</a></h2><p>Human Papillomavirus (HPV) remains one of the most commonly contracted sexually transmitted diseases around the world.

The principle of action can be explained as "brake theory". After releasing the brakes by ICIs, unprecedented systemic toxicities, even some refractory and fatal immune-related adverse effects (irAEs) may develop.

We also performed a systemic review of case reports and reviews of irAEs up to May 20, 2019 in PubMed and Chinese journals. Successful applications of specific immunosuppressive drugs and stimulating factors beyond the above guidelines and consensus were supplemented and highlighted, including agents blocking interleukin 6 (IL-6), rituximab, anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) monoclonal antibody (mAb), anti-integrin 4 mAb, Janus kinase inhibitors, thrombopoietin receptor agonists and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) etc. We put some concerns of using high-dose steroids for long-term, and emphasize the secondary infections, tumor progression, and unavailability of ICI re-challenge during steroid treatment. We propose the "De-escalation Therapy" principle for severe and refractory irAEs, and suggest that immunosuppressive drugs specifically targeting cytokines should be used as early as possible.

However, these drugs are highly expensive, and most people in the world cannot access the treatment. The development of recombinant protein production platforms that are cost-effective, scalable, and safe is needed. Plant platforms are attractive because of their low production cost, speed, scalability, lack of human and animal pathogens, and post-translational modifications that enable them to produce effective monoclonal antibodies. In this study, an anti-PD1 IgG4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) was transiently produced in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. The plant-produced anti-PD1 mAb was compared to the commercial nivolumab produced in CHO cells. Our results showed that both antibodies have similar protein structures, and the N-glycans on the plant-produced antibody lacks plant-specific structures. The PD1 binding affinity of the plant-produced and commercial nivolumab, determined by two different techniques, that is, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), are also comparable.

One objective is assessing antigen-induced T cell activation because only functionally active T cells are capable of killing the desired targets. Autofluorescence imaging can distinguish T cell activity states in a non-destructive manner by detecting endogenous changes in metabolic co-enzymes such as NAD(P)H. However, recognizing robust activity patterns is computationally challenging in the absence of exogenous labels. We demonstrate machine learning methods that can accurately classify T cell activity across human donors from NAD(P)H intensity images. Using 8,260 cropped single-cell images from six donors, we evaluate classifiers ranging from traditional models that use previously-extracted image features to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) pre-trained on general non-biological images. Adapting pre-trained CNNs for the T cell activity classification task provides substantially better performance than traditional models or a simple CNN trained with the autofluorescence images alone.

Tumor heterogeneity that often leads to distinct functional phenotypes contributes to glioblastoma (GB) indispensable growth and aggressiveness. The complex interaction of neoplastic cells with tumor microenvironment (TME) along with the presence of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) largely confers to extrinsic and intrinsic GB heterogeneity. Recent data indicate that glioma cells secrete a variety of soluble immunoregulatory factors to attract different cell types to TME including astrocytes, endothelial cells, circulating stem cells, and a range of immune cells. These further induce a local production of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors which upon crosstalk with extracellular matrix (ECM) components reprogram immune cells to inflammatory or anti-inflammatory phenotypes and manipulate host's immune response in favor of cancer growth and metastasis. Herein, we provide an overview of the immunobiologic factors that orchestrate the complex network of glioma cells and TME interactions in an effort to identify potential therapeutic targets for GB malignancy. Current therapeutic schemes and advances in targeting GB-TME crosstalk are further discussed. KEY MESSAGES: • Intrinsic and extrinsic tumor heterogeneity affects GB growth and aggressiveness. • GB cells secrete growth factors and chemoattractants to recruit immune cells to TME. • GAMs are a critical cell type in promoting GB growth. • GAMs change from pro-inflammatory, anti-tumor M1 phenotype to pro-tumorigenic M2. • Novel therapeutic agents target the crosstalk of neoplastic cells with TME.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657787>Beclin-1 as a neutrophil-specific immune checkpoint.</a></h2><p>Neutrophils are early wound healing and inflammation regulators that, due to functional plasticity, can adopt either pro- or antitumor functions. Until recently, beclin-1 was a protein known mainly for its role as a critical regulator of autophagy. In this issue of the JCI, Tan et al. describe the effects of the beclin-1 conditional myeloid cell-specific deletion in mice, in which immunostimulation resulted in hypersensitive neutrophils. The chronic proinflammatory effect of these neutrophils triggered spontaneous B cell malignancies to develop. Such tumorigenic effects were mediated primarily by IL-21 and CD40 signaling, leading to the upregulation of tolerogenic molecules, such as IL-10 and PD-L1. The authors went on to examine samples derived from patient lymphoid malignancies and showed that beclin-1 expression in neutrophils positively correlated with pre-B cell leukemia/lymphoma. Overall, the study provides an elegant model for neutrophil-driven carcinogenesis and identifies potential targets for  of B cell malignancies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650942>[The Use of Glucocorticoid in the Management of Adverse Effects Related to Immunocheckpoint Inhibitors].</a></h2><p>Immunocheckpoint inhibitors (ICIs) activated the patients' tumor immunity to kill the tumor cell, and brought new hope to patients with tumor. However, a series of immunocheckpoint inhibitors related adverse effects (irAEs) may also occur based on immune injury. Glucocorticoids are the basis for the treatment of such irAEs. However, the usage, dosage and course of treatment of glucocorticoid in irAEs are different from those in classic autoimmune diseases. Meanwhile, long-term use of large doses of glucocorticoids may cause serious adverse effects too. In this paper, the mechanism, dosage forms, adverse effects and management of glucocorticoids are described in detail, providing references and suggestions for oncologists to apply glucocorticoids in clinical practice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645426>Creation of a Y-shaped ileal orthotopic neobladder after an anterior pelvic exenteration in 10 logical steps.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645354>Cooperative Immune-mediated Mechanisms of the HDAC Inhibitor Entinostat, an IL-15 Superagonist, and a Cancer Vaccine Effectively Synergize as a Novel Cancer Therapy.</a></h2><p> has demonstrated clinical efficacy in subsets of patients with solid carcinomas. Multimodal therapies employing agents that can affect different arms of the immune system and/or tumor microenvironment might increase clinical responses.We demonstrate that entinostat, a class I histone deacetylase inhibitor, enhances the anti-tumor efficacy of the IL-15 superagonist, N-803 plus vaccine in 4T1 triple-negative breast and MC38-CEA colon murine carcinoma models. A comprehensive immune and gene expression analysis was performed in the periphery and/or tumor microenvironment (TME) of MC38-CEA tumor-bearing mice.Although N-803 plus vaccine induced peripheral CD8 T cell activation and cytokine production, there was no reduction in tumor burden and poor tumor infiltration of CD8 T cells with minimal levels of granzyme B. For the first time, we demonstrate that the addition of entinostat to N-803 plus vaccine promoted significant tumor control, correlating with increased expression of genes associated with tumor inflammation, enhanced infiltration of activated CD8 T cells with maximal granzyme B, T-cell responses to multiple tumor-associated antigens, increased serum IFNg, reduction of regulatory T cells in the TME, and decreased expression of the checkpoint V-domain Ig Suppressor of T cell Activation (VISTA) on multiple immune subsets.Collectively, these data demonstrate that the synergistic combination of entinostat, N-803, and vaccine elicits potent anti-tumor activity by generating a more inflamed TME.

We evaluated the expression of PD-L1 in carcinoma cells (Ca) and immune cells (ICs) across histopathologic and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) molecular subgroups of endometrial carcinoma (EC). Our study included 842 patients with EC. Direct sequencing of polymerase epsilon (POLE) exonuclease domain hot spots and conventional immunohistochemistry (MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6, p53) were conducted to identify TCGA classification-based molecular subgroups of EC: POLE-mutated, mismatch repair deficient, no specific molecular profile, and p53 aberrant. Multiplex immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate PD-L1 expression in Ca and tumor-infiltrating ICs. PD-L1 expression in Ca and in ICs was detected in 8.6% and 27.7% of the cases, respectively. A combined positive score (CPS) was ≥1% in 19.4% of the samples. PD-L1 positivity in Ca and ICs, and CPS correlated with tumor T-cell density (P<0.001). POLE-mutated and mismatch repair-deficient tumors were more likely to present PD-L1-expressing ICs, CPS positivity, and abundant tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes compared with other TCGA subgroups (P<0.001). No differences existed in Ca-PD-L1 expression (P=0.366). Within various histotypes, non-endometrioid carcinomas displayed the highest Ca-PD-L1, ICs, and CPS (P<0.03). Advanced cancers showed more frequent Ca-PD-L1 positivity (P=0.016), and CPS (P=0.029) and IC≥1% (P=0.037) positivity compared with early disease. In conclusion, PD-L1 expression profiles differ between molecular subclasses, histologic subtypes, and disease stage of EC. Prospective studies are needed to explore the predictive value of various PD-L1 scoring systems within the subgroups of EC.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have a crucial role in the regulation of anticancer immune responses, but the association of miRNA expression patterns and TMB is not clear in LUAD. : Differentially expressed miRNAs in samples with high TMB and low TMB samples were screened in the LUAD dataset in The Cancer Genome Atlas. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was applied to develop a miRNA-based signature classifier for predicting TMB levels in the training set. An test set was used to validate this classifier. The correlation between the miRNA-based classifier index and the expression of three immune checkpoints (PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4) were explored. Functional enrichment analysis was carried out of the miRNAs included in the miRNA-based signature classifier. : Twenty-five differentially expressed miRNAs were used to establish a miRNA-based signature classifier for predicting TMB level. The accuracy of the 25-miRNA-based signature classifier was 0.850 in the training set, 0.810 in the test set and 0.840 in the total set. This miRNA-based signature classifier index showed a low correlation with PD-1 and PD-L1, and no correlation with CTLA-4. Enrichment analysis for these 25 miRNA revealed they are involved in many immune-related biological processes and cancer-related pathways. : MiRNA expression patterns are associated with tumor mutational burden and a miRNA-based signature classifier may serve as a biomarker for prediction of TMB levels in LUAD.© 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659379>[Studies on radiotherapy of head and neck cancer : Highlights of the 2019 ASCO Annual Meeting].</a></h2><p>Radiotherapy is an important treatment option in patients with head and neck.

However, many novel "non-canonical" functions, alternative substrates, and regulatory mechanisms have been described and are being continuously elucidated. The activity of LOXs, therefore, appears to be integrated into a complex network of signals regulating many cell functions, including survival/proliferation/differentiation. Among these signaling pathways, TGF-β and PI3K/Akt/mTOR, in particular, cross-talk extensively with each other and with LOXs also initiating complex feedback loops which modulate the activity of LOXs and direct the remodeling of the ECM. A growing body of evidence indicates that LOXs are not only important in the homeostasis of the normal structure of the ECM, but are also implicated in the establishment and maturation of the tumor microenvironment. LOXs' association with advanced and metastatic cancer is well established; however, there is enough evidence to support a significant role of LOXs in the transformation of normal epithelial cells, in the accelerated tumor development and the induction of invasion of the premalignant epithelium. A better understanding of LOXs and their interactions with the different elements of the tumor immune microenvironment will prove invaluable in the design of novel anti-tumor strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649751>Recombinant baculovirus expressing the FrC-OVA protein induces protective antitumor immunity in an EG7-OVA mouse model.</a></h2><p>The baculovirus (BV)  multiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus has been used in numerous protein expression systems because of its ability to infect insect cells and serves as a useful vaccination vector with several benefits, such as its low clinical risks and posttranslational modification ability. We recently reported that dendritic cells (DCs) infected with BV stimulated antitumor immunity. The recombinant BV (rBV) also strongly stimulated peptide-specific T-cells and antitumor immunity. In this study, the stimulation of an immune response against EG7-OVA tumors in mice by a recombinant baculovirus-based combination vaccine expressing fragment C-ovalbumin (FrC-OVA-BV; rBV) was evaluated.We constructed an rBV expressing fragment C (FrC) of tetanus toxin containing a promiscuous MHC II-binding sequence and a p30-ovalbumin (OVA) peptide that functions in the MHC I pathway. The results showed that rBV activated the CD8 T-cell-mediated response much more efficiently than the wild-type BV (wtBV). Experiments with EG7-OVA tumor mouse models showed that rBV significantly decreased tumor volume and increased survival compared with those in the wild-type BV or FrC-OVA DNA vaccine groups. In addition, a significant antitumor effect of classic prophylactic or therapeutic vaccinations was observed for rBV against EG7-OVA-induced tumors compared with that in the controls.Our findings showed that FrC-OVA-BV (rBV) induced antitumor immunity, paving the way for its use in BV  against malignancies.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647026>Tumor immune microenvironment and genomic evolution in a patient with metastatic triple negative breast cancer and a complete response to atezolizumab.</a></h2><p>Metastatic TNBC (mTNBC) has a poor prognosis and few treatment options. The anti-PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab demonstrated clinical activity in mTNBC patients with PD-L1-positive tumor-infiltrating immune cells. The current study describes the tumor immune microenvironment (TiME) and genomic evolution across sequential therapies in a patient with a 31-year history of TNBC and a complete response (CR) to atezolizumab monotherapy.In 1986, the patient had surgery and radiotherapy (XRT) for newly diagnosed TNBC, followed by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy for two locoregional recurrences. She developed mTNBC in 2009 and was sequentially treated with capecitabine, gemcitabine-carboplatin-iniparib (GCI), XRT and an experimental vaccine. She experienced disease progression (PD) to all these therapies. In 2013, she had a PD-L1 positive tumor and enrolled in a phase 1 atezolizumab monotherapy study (PCD4989g; ). She received atezolizumab for 1 year with initial pseudo-progression followed by a partial response. After 1 year without treatment she experienced PD, reinitiated atezolizumab and subsequently achieved CR. Tumor specimens were collected at numerous times between 2008 and 2015 and assessed by immunohistochemistry, RNA-seq and DNA-seq.TiME biomarkers, including CD8, ICs and PD-L1 on IC, increased after capecitabine and remained high after GCI, XRT and through pseudo-progression on atezolizumab. At PD post-atezolizumab exposure, TiME biomarkers decreased but PD-L1 status remained positive. Immune-related RNA signatures confirmed these findings. TNBC subtyping revealed evolution from luminal androgen receptor (LAR) to basal-like immune activated (BLIA). Genomic profiling showed truncal alterations in RB1 and TP53, while the presence of other genomic alterations varied over time. Tumor mutational burden peaked after XRT and declined after atezolizumab exposure.This case report describes the evolution of TiME and TNBC molecular subtypes/genomics over time with sequential therapies in a TNBC patient with a CR to atezolizumab monotherapy.

Recently, immunotherapeutic approaches targeting tau have been demonstrated to be beneficial in decreasing tauopathy in animal models. We previously found that passive  with anti-tau antibody to human tau or expression of an anti-tau secreted single-chain variable fragment (scFv) in the central nervous system of a mouse model of tauopathy decreased but did not remove all tau-associated pathology. Although these and other studies demonstrate that conventional immunotherapeutic approaches targeting tau can influence tau pathogenesis, the majority of pathological tau remains in the cytosol of cells, not typically accessible to an extracellular antibody. Therefore, we reasoned targeting intracellular tau might be more efficacious in preventing or decreasing tauopathy.By utilizing our anti-tau scFv, we generated anti-tau intrabodies for the expression in the cytosol of neurons. To enhance the degradation capacity of conventional intrabodies, we engineered chimeric anti-tau intrabodies fused to ubiquitin harboring distinct mutations that shuttle intracellular tau for either the proteasome or lysosomal mediated degradation. To evaluate the efficacy in delaying or eliminating tauopathy, we expressed our tau degrading intrabodies or controls in human tau transgenic mice by adeno-associated virus prior to overt tau pathology and after tau deposition.Our results demonstrate, the expression of chimeric anti-tau intrabodies significantly reduce tau protein levels in primary neuronal cultures expression human tau relative to a non-modified anti-tau intrabody. We found the expression of engineered tau-degrading intrabodies destined for proteasomal-mediated degradation are more effective in delaying or eliminating tauopathy than a conventional intrabody in aged human tau transgenic mice.This study, harnesses the strength of intrabodies that are amendable for targeting specific domains or modifications with the cell-intrinsic mechanisms that regulate protein degradation providing a new immunotherapeutic approach with potentially improved efficacy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638423>Screening and Identification of Key Biomarkers in Pancreatic Cancer: Evidence from Bioinformatic Analysis.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646089>Dexamethasone differentially depletes tumour and peripheral blood lymphocytes and can impact the efficacy of chemotherapy/checkpoint blockade combination treatment.</a></h2><p>Dexamethasone is a synthetic glucocorticoid commonly used for the prevention and management of side effects in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. While it is effective as an anti-emetic and in preventing hypersensitivity reactions, dexamethasone depletes peripheral blood lymphocytes and impacts immune responses. The effect of dexamethasone on the number and quality of tumour-infiltrating leukocytes has not been reported. To address this, we calibrated the dose in two different strains of mice to achieve the same extent of peripheral blood lymphocyte depletion observed in patients with cancer. Doses that caused analogous depletion of T and B lymphocytes and NK cells from the peripheral blood, elicited no change in these populations within the tumour. The expression of immune checkpoint molecules PD-1, OX40, GITR and TIM3 on tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes was not altered. We found that dexamethasone had a small but significant deleterious impact on weakly efficacious chemoimmunotherapy but had no effect when the protocol was highly efficacious. Based on these results, we predict that dexamethasone will have a modest negative influence on the overall effectiveness of chemoimmunotherapy treatment.© 2019 The Author(s).

Combination anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 blockade therapy has enhanced efficacy, but it remains unclear through what mechanisms such effects are mediated. A critical question is whether combination therapy targets and modulates the same T cell populations as monotherapies. Using a mass cytometry-based systems approach, we comprehensively profiled the response of T cell populations to monotherapy and combination anti-CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-1 therapy in syngeneic murine tumors and clinical samples. Most effects of monotherapies were additive in the context of combination therapy; however, multiple combination therapy-specific effects were observed. Highly phenotypically exhausted cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) T cells expand in frequency following anti-PD-1 monotherapy but not combination therapy, while activated terminally differentiated effector CD8 T cells expand only following combination therapy. Combination therapy also led to further increased frequency of T helper type 1 (Th1)-like CD4 effector T cells even though anti-PD-1 monotherapy is not sufficient to do so. Mass cytometry analyses of peripheral blood from melanoma patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade therapies similarly revealed mostly additive effects on the frequencies of T cell subsets along with unique modulation of terminally differentiated effector CD8 T cells by combination ipilimumab plus nivolumab therapy. Together, these findings indicate that dual blockade of CTLA-4 and PD-1 therapy is sufficient to induce unique cellular responses compared with either monotherapy.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

Poor DC development can limit the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade and  vaccination approaches. Interference in intracellular signaling cascades downstream from the receptors of major tumor-associated suppressive cytokines like IL-10 and IL-6, might improve DC development and activation, and thus enhance  efficacy. We performed exploratory functional screens on arrays consisting of >1000 human kinase peptide substrates to identify pathways involved in DC development and its inhibition by IL-10 or IL-6. The resulting alterations in phosphorylation of the kinome substrate profile pointed to glycogen-synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) as a pivotal kinase in both DC development and suppression. GSK3β inhibition blocked human DC differentiation , which was accompanied by decreased levels of IL-12p70 secretion, and a reduced capacity for T cell priming. More importantly, adenoviral transduction of monocytes with a constitutively active form of GSK3β induced resistance to the suppressive effects of IL-10 and melanoma-derived supernatants alike, resulting in improved DC development, accompanied by up-regulation of co-stimulatory markers, an increase in CD83 expression levels in mature DC, and diminished release of IL-10. Moreover, adenovirus-mediated intratumoral manipulation of this pathway in an  melanoma model resulted in DC activation and recruitment, and in improved immune surveillance and tumor control. We propose the induction of constitutive GSK3β activity as a novel therapeutic means to bolster DC functionality in the tumor microenvironment.© 2019 The Author(s).

However, there are two main challenges in successfully utilizing macrophages for . First, macrophage colony stimulating factor (MCSF) secreted by cancer cells binds to colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1-R) on macrophages and in turn activates the downstream signaling pathway responsible for polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to immunosuppressive M2 phenotype. Second, ligation of signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα) expressed on myeloid cells to CD47, a transmembrane protein overexpressed on cancer cells, activates the Src homology region 2 (SH2) domain -phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 in macrophages. This results in activation of "eat-me-not" signaling pathway and inhibition of phagocytosis. Here, it is reported that self-assembled dual-inhibitor-loaded nanoparticles (DNTs) target M2 macrophages and simultaneously inhibit CSF1R and SHP2 pathways.

Furthermore, suboptimal dose administration of DNTs in highly aggressive breast cancer and melanoma mouse models show enhanced anti-tumor efficacy without any toxicity.

In this review, we summarized guidelines of management of -related toxicities and case reports, and proposed treatment recommendation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647023>The role of exosomal PD-L1 in tumor progression and .</a></h2><p>Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), a type I transmembrane protein, binds to its receptor PD-1 to suppress the activation of T cells, thereby maintaining immunological homeostasis. In contrast, tumor cells highly express PD-L1, which binds to receptor PD-1 expressed on activated T cells, leading to immune escape. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint therapy blocks the binding of PD-1/PD-L1 to reinvigorate the exhausted T cells, thereby inhibiting tumor growth. Exosomes are biologically active lipid-bilayer nanovesicles secreted by various cell types that mediate intercellular signal communication. Numerous studies have shown that tumor cells are able to promote tumor epithelial-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, and immune escape by releasing exosomes. Recent studies imply that tumor-derived exosomes could carry PD-L1 in the same membrane topology as the cell surface, thereby resisting immune checkpoint therapy. In this review, we mainly discuss the role of exosomes in the regulation of tumor progression and the potential resistance mechanism to  via exosomal PD-L1. In addition, we propose that exosomal PD-L1 may have the potential to be a target to overcome resistance to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647786>Global Routine Vaccination Coverage, 2018.</a></h2><p>Endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 2012, the Global Vaccine Action Plan 2011-2020 (GVAP) (1) calls on all countries to reach ≥90% national coverage with all vaccines in the country's national immunization schedule by 2020. Building on previous analyses (2) and using the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) global vaccination coverage estimates as of 2018, this report presents global, regional, and national vaccination coverage estimates and trends, including vaccination dropout rates. According to these estimates, global coverage with the first dose of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis-containing vaccine (DTP1) remained relatively unchanged from 2010 (89%) to 2018 (90%). Global coverage with the third DTP dose (DTP3) followed a similar global trend to that of DTP1, remaining relatively consistent from 2010 (84%) to 2018 (86%) (3). Globally, 19.4 million children (14%) were not fully vaccinated in 2018, and among them, 13.5 million (70%) did not receive any DTP doses. Overall, dropout rates from DTP1 to DTP3 decreased globally from 6% in 2010 to 4% in 2018. Global coverage with the first dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) remained between 84% and 86% during 2010-2018. Among countries that offer a second MCV dose (MCV2) during the second year of life, coverage increased from 19% in 2007 to 54% in 2018; among countries offering MCV2 to older age groups (children aged 3-14 years), coverage also increased, from 36% in 2007 to 69% in 2018 (3). Globally, the estimated difference in coverage with MCV1 and MCV2 in 2018 was 17%. However, among new and underused vaccines, global coverage increased from 2007 to 2018 for completed series of rotavirus vaccine, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), rubella vaccine, Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (Hib), and hepatitis B vaccine (HepB). To reach global vaccination coverage goals for vaccines recommended during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, tailored strategies that address local determinants for incomplete vaccination are needed, including targeting hard-to-reach and hard-to-vaccinate populations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659584>Clinical characteristics and long-term follow-up of seven cases of anti-GABABR encephalitis in patients of Han Chinese descent.</a></h2><p>To improve the diagnosis and treatment of anti-GABAB receptor (anti-GABABR) encephalitis and prevent misdiagnosis or non-diagnosis.We retrospectively examined the chief clinical manifestations, auxiliary examination results, treatment strategies, treatment efficacy, and long-term follow-up results of seven consecutive patients with anti-GABABR encephalitis.Epileptic seizures were the first symptom in 100% of the patients; 85.7% had memory deficit in the hospital, 42.8% had residual symptoms of cognitive impairment at discharge, and 28.6% had cognitive impairment at the end of follow-up; 71.4% of the patients had psychosis in the hospital, 57.1% had residual symptoms of psychosis at discharge, and 14.3% still had psychosis at the end of follow-up. However, the clinical symptoms (psychiatric disorders, cognitive decline) and signs (consciousness disturbance) at onset and after follow-up were not significantly different (P > 0.05). In 71.4% of the patients, anti-GABABR antibody serum levels were higher than those in the cerebrospinal fluid (especially in patients with lung cancer). Magnetic resonance imaging in 71.4% of patients indicated that the marginal lobe demonstrated encephalitis lesions. The average modified Rankin Scale score (2.0 ± 2.31) at follow-up was significantly better than that (3.86 ± 0.90) at the time of admission (P < 0.05).The clinical characteristics of anti-GABABR encephalitis were refractory epilepsy, psychiatric disorders, and cognitive impairment. Multiple antiepileptic drugs are crucial for the treatment of intractable epilepsy. Clinicians should eliminate the possibility of small-cell lung cancer in patients with high anti-GABABR antibody levels.

Scientometric analysis is effective and widely used to summarize the most influential studies within a certain field. We present the first scientometric analysis of recurrent glioma.We conducted a generalized search for articles on recurrent glioma in the Web of Science database and evaluated the top 100 most cited articles among a total of 4,651 articles.The number of citations from the top 100 cited articles on recurrent glioma ranged from 149 to 1,471; the majority of these articles were published in oncology-specific journals (66) and were submitted by institutions in the United States of America (67). The top-cited articles consisted of 98 articles and 2 literature reviews. Articles were classified into 4 major categories based on subject matter: 82 pertained to treatment, 6 pertained to genetic mechanisms, 7 pertained to diagnosis, and 5 pertained to prognosis. Treatment-related articles were subdivided into the following 7 categories: targeted therapy (21), chemotherapy (20),  (12), combination therapy (12), radiotherapy (9), surgical resection (6), a new therapy (physiotherapy) (1), and treatment summary (1).The results of the analysis indicated that the core problem is the treatment of recurrent glioma. Although the number of citations on targeted therapy and combination therapy has increased in recent years, the proportion of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), basic medical research, literature reviews and meta-analyses is relatively low; thus, there is an urgent need to conduct these types of studies on recurrent glioma.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Although undeniable success has been observed in clinical trials, not all patients respond to treatment. Different concurrent conditions can attenuate or completely abrogate the usefulness of  due to the activation of several escape mechanisms. Indeed, the tumor microenvironment has an almost full immunosuppressive profile, creating an obstacle to therapeutic treatment. Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) governs a plethora of cellular processes, including maintenance of genomic stability, cell survival/apoptosis, migration, and metabolism. The repertoire of PTEN functions has recently been expanded to include regulation of the tumor microenvironment and immune system, leading to a drastic reevaluation of the canonical paradigm of PTEN action with new potential implications for -based approaches. Understanding the implication of PTEN in cancer immunoediting and immune evasion is crucial to develop new cancer intervention strategies. Recent evidence has shown a double context-dependent role of PTEN in anticancer immunity. Here we summarize the current knowledge of PTEN's role at a crossroads between tumor and immune compartments, highlighting the most recent findings that are likely to change future clinical practice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657540>Task-Specific Design of Immune-Augmented Nanoplatform to Enable High-Efficiency Tumor .</a></h2><p>Potentiating systemic immunity against breast cancer is in the most urgent demand as breast cancer is low sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Although phototherapy and some chemotherapy can trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD) for T cell-mediated antitumor immune response, their  efficacy is severely restricted by insufficient phototherapeutic capability and severe multidrug resistance (MDR). Inspired by both the hypersensitivity to phototherapy and the key role in MDR for mitochondria, a rationally engineered immunity amplifier via mitochondria-targeted photo-chemotherapeutic nanoparticles was, for the first time, achieved to fight against low-immunogenic breast cancer without additional immune agent. The newly synthesized task-specific mitochondria-targeted IR780 derivative (T780) was integrated with chemotherapeutic doxorubicin (DOX) to form multifunctional nanoparticles via assembling strategy along with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as biomimetic corona (BSA@T780/DOX NPs). The in situ enhancement in both phototherapy and MDR reversal by targeting mitochondria with BSA@T780/DOX NPs boosted high-efficient ICD toward excellent antitumor immune response. The newly developed strategy not only eradicated the primary tumor, but also eliminated the bilateral tumors efficiently, as well as preventing metastasis and postsurgical recurrence, demonstrating great interest for fighting against low-immunogenic breast cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650944>[Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment Recommendations for Cardiac Adverse Reactions Related to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor].</a></h2><p> of malignant tumors has become a hot spot in the field of cancer research and treatment, bringing new hope to patients with advanced cancer. Activation of molecular programmer death protein-1 and T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4-related signaling pathways at the immunological checkpoint can inhibit T lymphocyte activation and thereby block the inflammatory response. Tumor cells achieve immune escape by activating the molecular pathways associated with immune checkpoints. The immune checkpoint inhibitor can wake up T lymphocytes and enhance the body's clearance of tumor cells. However, the role of immune checkpoint inhibitors is not specific to tumor cells, and it can cause side effects of multiple systems including the cardiovascular system while killing tumor cells.

The activation of programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA)-4 relevant signaling pathway can inhibit the activation of T lymphocytes. Tumor cells can achieve immune escape by activating this signaling pathway. By inhibiting this signaling pathway, immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) activate T lymphocytes to clear the tumor cells. Therefore, the adverse effects of ICIs are mainly immune-related adverse events (irAEs). The digestive system, including gastrointestinal tract and liver are vital organs of digestion and absorption, metabolism and detoxification, as well as important immune related organs, which are the commonly affected system of irAEs.

However, even when pathologic disease-free margins can be achieved, locoregional and/or distant disease relapse remains high. Perioperative  may improve outcomes, but mechanistic data supporting the use of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment clinically is sparse.Two syngeneic models of oral cavity carcinoma with defined T cell antigens were treated with PD-1 mAb before or after surgical resection of primary tumors, and antigen-specific T cell responses were explored with functional and challenge assays.We demonstrated that functional immunodominance developed among T cells targeting multiple independent tumor antigens. T cells specific for subdominant antigens expressed greater levels of PD-1. Neoadjuvant, but not adjuvant, PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade broke immunodominance and induced T cell responses to dominant and subdominant antigens. Using tumors lacking the immunodominant antigen as a model of antigen escape, neoadjuvant PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade induced effector T cell immunity against tumor cells lacking immunodominant but retaining subdominant antigen. When combined with complete surgical excision, neoadjuvant PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade led to formation of immunologic memory capable of preventing engraftment of tumors lacking the immunodominant but retaining subdominant antigen.Together, these results implicate PD-1 expression by T cells in the mechanism of functional immunodominance among independent T cell clones within a progressing tumor, and support the use of neoadjuvant PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade in patients with surgically resectable carcinomas.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649385>Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in malignant melanoma - allies or foes?</a></h2><p>This is an overview of current problematics regarding the role of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in malignant melanomas. Various and often conflicting data have been published, correlating tumor type, stage, prognosis, as well as sex and age of patients. This is partly due to heterogeneity in scaling systems and unstandardized TILs grading but also due to changes of tumor-host interactions. Melanomas are an immunologically heterogeneous group with variability of TILs, where distinct gene expression patterns were found in tumors with absent, and/or non- brisk TIL grade versus brisk TIL grade.

The ineffectiveness of treatment is partly because of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which comprises tumor-supportive pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs). Therefore, new therapeutic strategies are needed to tackle both the immunosuppressive PSC and pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs). Recently, physical cold atmospheric plasma consisting of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species has emerged as a novel treatment option for cancer. In this study, we investigated the cytotoxicity of plasma-treated phosphate-buffered saline (pPBS) using three PSC lines and four PCC lines and examined the immunogenicity of the induced cell death. We observed a decrease in the viability of PSC and PCC after pPBS treatment, with a higher efficacy in the latter. Two PCC lines expressed and released damage-associated molecular patterns characteristic of the induction of immunogenic cell death (ICD). In addition, pPBS-treated PCC were highly phagocytosed by dendritic cells (DCs), resulting in the maturation of DC. This indicates the high potential of pPBS to trigger ICD. In contrast, pPBS induced no ICD in PSC. In general, pPBS treatment of PCCs and PSCs created a more immunostimulatory secretion profile (higher TNF-α and IFN-γ, lower TGF-β) in coculture with DC. Altogether, these data show that plasma treatment via pPBS has the potential to induce ICD in PCCs and to reduce the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment created by PSCs. Therefore, these data provide a strong experimental basis for further in vivo validation, which might potentially open the way for more successful combination strategies with  for PDAC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656500>Polysaccharides obtained from  of  attenuated doxorubicin-induced cytotoxic effects in chemotherapy.</a></h2><p> militaris has been used as a herbal tonic in traditional Chinese medicine, which could be surface liquid-cultured for  production.

Recently, however, advances in lung cancer treatment have improved the chance of long-term survival of patients with unresectable distant metastases. We describe the occurrence and management of metastatic spread of a pulmonary carcinoma to the rectum.The patient was a 79-year-old woman who had undergone thoracoscopic left lobectomy for pulmonary adenocarcinoma and then, over the next 11 years, various drugs (carboplatin + paclitaxel (as adjuvant therapy), gefitinib, gemcitabine + vinorelbine, S1 (an oral 5-fluorouracil-based drug), carboplatin + pemetrexed + bevacizumab, erlotinib, nivolumab, afatinib, and carboplatin+ S1) were administered, especially for hilar and mediastinal lymph node recurrences. During the eleventh postoperative year, left and right iliac bone metastases were detected, and radiation therapy was undertaken for local control of these lesions. When F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography was performed for evaluation of the disease, tracer accumulation in the upper rectum was seen. Colonoscopic examination of the rectum revealed an intramural mass with central ulceration, and the mass was diagnosed histologically as an adenocarcinoma. The bone metastases appeared to be controlled, and the patient's performance status was good, but she had suffered constipation for about a year and desired treatment. Thus, laparoscopic low anterior resection was performed. Histopathologic analysis revealed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma existing mainly between the submucosa and serosa, and immunohistochemical analysis showed the tumor to be positive for cytokeratin (CK) 7, negative for CK20, positive for thyroid transcription factor-1, and negative for special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2 and caudal type homeobox 2, confirming the diagnosis of rectal metastasis from the primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma. The patient recovered well without any change in her functional status. Systemic chemotherapy was resumed, and she continues to do well, now 6 months after surgery.Surgery may be a good option for the management of an isolated rectal metastasis from pulmonary cancer in patients whose functional status is good.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642039>Overview of Staphylococcus epidermidis cell wall-anchored proteins: potential targets to inhibit biofilm formation.</a></h2><p>Currently, the treatment of infections by Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) represents a challenge because some strains have multidrug-resistance to antimicrobial products (antibiotic and biocides) and can produce biofilms.

Five monoclonal antibodies that antagonized PD-1/PD-L1 interaction have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and marketed as  for cancer treatment. However, some weaknesses of antibodies, such as high cost, low stability, poor amenability for oral administration, and immunogenicity, should not be overlooked. To overcome these disadvantages, small-molecule inhibitors targeting PD-L1 were developed. In the present work, we applied in silico and in vitro approaches to develop short peptides targeting PD-1 as chemical probes for the inhibition of PD-1-PD-L1 interaction. We first predicted the potential binding pocket on PD-1/PD-L1 protein-protein interface (PPI). Sequentially, we carried out virtual screening against our in-house peptide library to identify potential ligands. WANG-003, WANG-004, and WANG-005, three of our in-house peptides, were predicted to bind to PD-1 with promising docking scores. Next, we conducted molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for the further analysis of interactions between our peptides and PD-1. Finally, we evaluated the affinity between peptides and PD-1 by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding technology. The present study provides a new perspective for the development of PD-1 inhibitors that disrupt PD-1-PD-L1 interactions. These promising peptides have the potential to be utilized as a novel chemical probe for further studies, as well as providing a foundation for further designs of potent small-molecule inhibitors targeting PD-1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646100>Human Mesenchymal glioblastomas are characterized by an increased immune cell presence compared to Proneural and Classical tumors.</a></h2><p>Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive malignant primary brain tumor in adults, with a median survival of 14.6 months. Recent efforts have focused on identifying clinically relevant subgroups to improve our understanding of pathogenetic mechanisms and patient stratification. Concurrently, the role of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment has received increasing attention, especially T cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). The latter are a mixed population of activated brain-resident microglia and infiltrating monocytes/monocyte-derived macrophages, both of which express ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (IBA1). This study investigated differences in immune cell subpopulations among distinct transcriptional subtypes of GBM. Human GBM samples were molecularly characterized and assigned to Proneural, Mesenchymal or Classical subtypes as defined by NanoString nCounter Technology. Subsequently, we performed and analyzed automated immunohistochemical stainings for TAM as well as specific T cell populations. The Mesenchymal subtype of GBM showed the highest presence of TAM, CD8, CD3 and FOXP3 T cells, as compared to Proneural and Classical subtypes. High expression levels of the TAM-related gene , which encodes the TAM-specific protein IBA1, correlated with a worse prognosis in Proneural GBM, but conferred a survival benefit in Mesenchymal tumors. We used our data to construct a mathematical model that could reliably identify Mesenchymal GBM with high sensitivity using a combination of the aforementioned cell-specific IHC markers. In conclusion, we demonstrated that molecularly distinct GBM subtypes are characterized by profound differences in the composition of their immune microenvironment, which could potentially help to identify tumors amenable to .© 2019 The Author(s).

Amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau proteins drive pathology by forming toxic oligomers that eventually deposit as insoluble amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Recent clinical studies suggest that effective drugs must specifically target oligomers, not native monomers or insoluble fibrils. Passive  is one promising pharmaceutical strategy used to specifically target these oligomers in situ. Using the specificity of antibodies coupled with the natural power of the body's immune response, this treatment provides an opportunity for safe clearance of pathogenic protein species from the brain. Passive immunotherapies against Aβ and tau oligomers have progressed to clinical trials, with many currently in progress. Biochemical studies of antibody-oligomer complexes have helped identify previously unknown toxic epitopes, thus providing knowledge to the AD field as a whole.

Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L) is detectable during homeostasis and increases in hypoplasia due to genetic defects or treatment with cytoreductive agents. Conversely, Flt3+ AML is associated with depletion of Flt3L to undetectable levels. After induction chemotherapy, Flt3L is restored in patients entering complete remission (CR) but remains depressed in those with refractory disease. Weekly sampling reveals marked differences in the kinetics of Flt3L response during the first 6 weeks of treatment, proportionate to the clearance of blasts and cellularity of the bone marrow. In the UK NCRI AML17 trial, Flt3L was measured at day 26 in a subgroup of 140 patients with Flt3 mutation randomized to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lestaurtinib or placebo. In these patients, attainment of CR was associated with higher Flt3L at day 26 (Mann-Whitney UP < .0001). Day 26 Flt3L was also associated with survival; Flt3L ≤291 pg/mL was associated with inferior event-free survival (EFS), and Flt3L >1185 pg/mL was associated with higher overall survival (OS; P = .0119). The separation of EFS and OS curves increased when minimal residual disease (MRD) status was combined with Flt3L measurement, and Flt3L retained a near-significant association with survival after adjusting for MRD in a proportional hazards model. Serial measurement of Flt3L in patients who had received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant for AML illustrates the potential value of monitoring Flt3L to identify relapse. Measurement of Flt3L is a noninvasive test with the potential to inform clinical decisions in patients with AML.© 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640756>MAGE-A1 in lung adenocarcinoma as a promising target of chimeric antigen receptor T cells.</a></h2><p>Cancer/testis antigens (CTAs) are a special type of tumor antigen and are believed to act as potential targets for cancer .In this study, we first screened a rational CTA MAGE-A1 for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and explored the detailed characteristics of MAGE-A1 in LUAD development through a series of phenotypic experiments.

Yet, the underlying association between KRAS mutations and immune responses remains unclear. We performed an integrated analysis of the data from publicly available repositories and from clinical center cohorts to explore the association between KRAS mutation status and tumor immunity-associated features, including PD-L1 expression, CD8 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and tumor mutational burden (TMB). Our results revealed that KRAS mutations are correlated with an inflammatory tumor microenvironment and tumor immunogenicity, resulting in superior patient response to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Meanwhile, three-pool analysis further confirmed that KRAS-mutant NSCLC patients show remarkable clinical benefit from anti-PD-1/PD-L1 . In addition, a KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma mouse model was established to estimate the relative efficacy of anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody monotherapy or combination treatment with docetaxel versus docetaxel alone. Most surprisingly, we found that PD-L1 blockade combined with docetaxel did not promote an anti-tumor response. These findings uncover that PD-1/PD-L1 blockade monotherapy may be the optimal therapeutic schedule in NSCLC patients harboring KRAS mutations.Copyright © 2019.

Epigenetic therapies such as BET Bromodomain inhibition can change the transcriptome of tumor cells, possibly making them more immunogenic and thus susceptible to immune targeting.We characterized the effects of BET bromodomain inhibition using JQ1 on PD-L1 and HLA-ABC expression in two human prostate cell lines, DU145 and PC3. RNA-Seq was performed to assess changes on a genome-wide level. A cytotoxic T cell killing assay was performed in MC38-OVA cells treated with JQ1 to demonstrate increased immunogenicity. In vivo experiments in the Myc-Cap model were conducted to show the effects of JQ1 administration in concert with anti-CTLA-4 checkpoint blockade.Here, we show that targeting BET bromodomains using the small molecule inhibitor JQ1 decreased PD-L1 expression and mitigated tumor progression in prostate cancer models. Mechanistically, BET bromodomain inhibition increased MHC I expression and increased the immunogenicity of tumor cells. Transcriptional profiling showed that BET bromodomain inhibition regulates distinct networks of antigen processing and immune checkpoint molecules. In murine models, treatment with JQ1 was additive with anti-CTLA-4 , resulting in an increased CD8/Treg ratio.BET Bromodomain inhibition can mediate changes in expression at a genome wide level in prostate cancer cells, resulting in an increased susceptibility to CD8 T cell targeting. These data suggest that combining BET bromodomain inhibition with immune checkpoint blockade may have clinical activity in prostate cancer patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646092>Immune checkpoint inhibitors in mCRPC - rationales, challenges and perspectives.</a></h2><p>The advancement of immune-therapeutics in cancer treatment has proven to be promising in various malignant diseases.

AIT is usually delivered by sublingual, subcutaneous route. Both sublingual  (SLIT) and subcutaneous  (SCIT) are given at increasing doses in the build-up phase and then at maintenance dose. The allergen dose is regularly administered throughout the year or pre/co-seasonally, depending on the causal allergen and the type of allergen extract. AIT with one or multiple allergens currently represents the only causal treatment able to change the natural history of allergic airways diseases (1). Significant progresses have been made in terms of AIT efficacy and safety since the first report of the treatment of hay-fever by SCIT using pollen extracts, described by Noon and Freeman in 1911 (2; 3). The first randomized study on SLIT dates back to 1986 (4). Several placebo-controlled studies on AIT in the subsequent years have allowed systematic reviews suggesting evidence for improvement of symptoms and reduction of medication use for both allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma (5). However, AIT remains underused since interpretation of evidence remains challenging for heterogeneity among studied populations, selection of potential responders, outcomes, regimens and products for AIT. Moreover, the use of AIT is hampered by fluctuating availability of AIT products, different educational level of physicians and lack of consciousness of AIT in the general population (6).Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633196>To PARP or not to PARP?-Toward sensitizing acute myeloid leukemia stem cells to .</a></h2><p>A new study reveals that leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in acute myeloid leukemia downregulate natural killer cell-activating receptor ligands to evade immune surveillance via the transcriptional co-factor PARP1.

Targeting interleukin-2 (IL2) receptors on activated T-cells using positron emission tomography (PET) with N-(4-[F]fluorobenzoyl)-interleukin-2 ([F]FB-IL2) could be such a strategy. This paper describes the challenging translation of the partly manual labeling of [F]FB-IL2 for preclinical studies into an automated procedure following Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), resulting in a radiopharmaceutical suitable for clinical use.The preclinical synthesis of [F]FB-IL2 was the starting point for translation to a clinical production method.

However, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) also shows favorable outcomes. Although the immunological environment of RC has been thoroughly discussed, the effect of NAC on it is less clear. Here, we investigated the immunological microenvironment, including T-cell infiltration, activation, and topological distribution, of resected RC tissue after neoadjuvant therapies and evaluated the correlation between T-cell subsets and patient prognosis. RC patients (n = 188) were enrolled and categorized into three groups, namely CRT (n = 41), NAC (n = 46), and control (surgery alone; n = 101) groups. Characterization of residual carcinoma cells and T-cell subsets in resected tissues was performed using multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemistry. The densities of total and activated (Ki67 ) T-cells in tissues after NAC, but not CRT, were higher than in control. In both CRT and NAC groups, patients presenting with higher treatment effects showed aggressive infiltration of T-cell subsets into carcinomas. Multivariate analyses of pathological and immunological features and prognosis revealed that carcinoma Ki67 CD4 T-cells after CRT and stromal Ki67 CD8 T-cells after NAC are important prognostic factors, respectively.

The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multi-protein complex of the innate immune system that is responsible for the production of the potent inflammatory cytokine IL-1β. Tumor- associated macrophages (TAM) are an expanded population of immune cells found in the tumor microenvironment that can promote the initiation and metastasis of tumor cells. Their presence has been correlated with disease burden, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting this population. However, to date clinically relevant pharmacologic strategies to target TAM remain elusive. Here, we show that  generated TAM harbor NLRP3 inflammasome components and produce IL-1β. Ibrutinib, an irreversible inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), is in clinical use for the treatment of B- cell malignancies. We report that BTK is expressed by human  generated TAM and murine macrophages and that it physically associates with the NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, ibrutinib is able to inhibit BTK phosphorylation in TAM generated . Treatment of TAM with ibrutinib significantly impaired the ability of these cells to produce IL-1β. The present study provides evidence that BTK physically associates with the NLRP3 inflammasome and that inhibition of BTK with ibrutinib can impair the production of IL-1β by  generated TAM. Thus, ibrutinib could potentially be of clinical use in abrogating inflammation-associated cancer progression and the immune-suppressive effects of myeloid cells within the tumor microenvironment.© 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646091>Clinical impact of T cells, B cells and the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in muscle invasive bladder cancer: a comparative study of transurethral resection and cystectomy specimens.</a></h2><p>In patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) prior to radical cystectomy has improved survival but there is an urgent unmet need to identify prognostic and predictive biomarkers to stratify patients who will benefit from treatment. This study aimed to examine the composition of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in MIBC, with particular reference to the clinical outcome and the potential modifying effect of NAC. To this end, the expression of CD8 and FoxP3 T cells, CD20 B cells, PD-1 and PD-L1 immune cells and PD-L1 tumor cells was evaluated by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays with paired transurethral resection (TURB) specimens, cystectomy specimens and lymph node metastases from 145 patients, 65 of whom had received NAC. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were applied to assess the impact of investigated cell subsets on time to recurrence (TTR). In cystectomy specimens, high infiltration of the investigated immune cell populations, but not PD-L1 tumor cells, were independently associated with a prolonged TTR, whereas in TURB specimens, this association was only seen for CD8 lymphocytes. An additive beneficial prognostic effect of NAC was seen for the majority of the cell subsets but there was no significant interaction between any immune marker and NAC in relation to TTR. Furthermore, no differences in cell densities prior to NAC treatment were observed between complete and non-complete responders, or pre- and posttreatment in non-complete responders.

Due to the lack of direct control mechanisms, therapy-related adverse reactions including cytokine release- and tumor lysis syndrome can even become life-threatening. In case of target antigen expression on non-malignant cells, CAR T cells can also attack healthy tissues. To overcome such side effects, we have established a modular CAR platform termed UniCAR: UniCAR T cells per se are inert as they recognize a peptide epitope (UniCAR epitope) that is not accessible on the surface of living cells. Bifunctional adapter molecules termed target modules (TM) can cross-link UniCAR T cells with target cells. In the absence of TMs, UniCAR T cells automatically turn off. Until now, all UniCAR TMs were constructed by fusion of the UniCAR epitope to an antibody domain. To open up the wide field of low-molecular-weight compounds for retargeting of UniCAR T cells to tumor cells, and to follow in parallel the progress of UniCAR T cell therapy by PET imaging we challenged the idea to convert a PET tracer into a UniCAR-TM. For proof of concept, we selected the clinically used PET tracer PSMA-11, which binds to the prostate-specific membrane antigen overexpressed in prostate carcinoma. Here we show that fusion of the UniCAR epitope to PSMA-11 results in a low-molecular-weight theranostic compound that can be used for both retargeting of UniCAR T cells to tumor cells, and for non-invasive PET imaging and thus represents a member of a novel class of theranostics.© 2019 The Author(s).

The fusion of V and V domains can distort their relative orientation, thereby compromising specificity and association constant of scFv, and reducing the lytic efficacy of CAR-T cells. Here, we circumvent the complications of domains' fusion by designing scFv mutants that stabilize interaction between scFv and its target, thereby rescuing scFv efficacy. We employ an iterative approach, based on structural modeling and mutagenesis driven by computational protein design. To demonstrate the power of this approach, we use the scFv derived from an antibody specific to a human leukocyte antigen A2 (HLA-A2)-HER2-derived peptide complex. Whereas the parental antibody is highly specific to its target, the scFv showed reduced specificity.

After 4 months, he was admitted to the hospital due to increased fecal blood volume.Highly differentiated adenocarcinoma was diagnosed based on rectal biopsy, and abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed multiple metastatic tumors in the liver.The patient underwent 1 cycle of chemotherapy, which was terminated owing to severe gastrointestinal reactions. Several days later, he was administered cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cell therapy plus adjuvant radiotherapy.Dynamic changes in the patient's tumor markers returned to normal levels, and abdominal CT and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no metastatic liver tumors.Sequent therapy provided a curative effect for liver metastasis in a rectal cancer patient. Radiation may have activated the body to produce distant effects, eliminating the live metastasis. CIK cell- and radiotherapy may have synergistic therapeutic effects and could be combined for successful treatment of liver metastasis from rectal cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661003>Recent advances in nanotheranostics for triple negative breast cancer treatment.</a></h2><p>Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most complex and aggressive type of breast cancer encountered world widely in women. Absence of hormonal receptors on breast cancer cells necessitates the chemotherapy as the only treatment regime. High propensity to metastasize and relapse in addition to poor prognosis and survival motivated the oncologist, nano-medical scientist to develop novel and efficient nanotherapies to solve such a big TNBC challenge. Recently, the focus for enhanced availability, targeted cellular uptake with minimal toxicity is achieved by nano-carriers. These smart nano-carriers carrying all the necessary arsenals (drugs, tracking probe, and ligand) designed in such a way that specifically targets the TNBC cells at site. Articulating the targeted delivery system with multifunctional molecules for high specificity, tracking, diagnosis, and treatment emerged as theranostic approach. In this review, in addition to classical treatment modalities, recent advances in nanotheranostics for early and effective diagnostic and treatment is discussed. This review highlighted the recently FDA approved  and all the ongoing clinical trials for TNBC, in addition to nanoparticle assisted . Futuristic but realistic advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning not only improve early diagnosis but also assist clinicians for their workup in TNBC. The novel concept of Nanoparticles induced endothelial leakiness (NanoEL) as a way of tumor invasion is also discussed in addition to classical EPR effect. This review intends to provide basic insight and understanding of the novel nano-therapeutic modalities in TNBC diagnosis and treatment and to sensitize the readers for continue designing the novel nanomedicine. This is the first time that designing nanoparticles with stoichiometric definable number of antibodies per nanoparticle now represents the next level of precision by design in nanomedicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648485>[Anti-CD22 CAR-T combined with anti-CD19 CAR-T cells in the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute B lymphocytic leukemia with severe cytokine release syndrome: two cases report and literature review].</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638600>Hedgehog signaling promotes tumor-associated macrophage polarization to suppress intratumoral CD8+ T cell recruitment.</a></h2><p>Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) usually display an antiinflammatory M2-like phenotype to facilitate tumor growth. However, what drives M2 polarization of TAMs and how TAMs suppress antitumor immunity within the tumor microenvironment (TME) remain largely undefined. Using several murine tumor models, we showed that hedgehog (Hh) signaling in myeloid cells is critical for TAM M2 polarization and tumor growth. We also found that tumor cells secrete sonic hedgehog (SHH), an Hh ligand, and that tumor-derived SHH drives TAM M2 polarization. Furthermore, Hh-induced functional polarization in TAMs suppresses CD8+ T cell recruitment to the TME through the inhibition of CXCL9 and CXCL10 production by TAMs. Last, we demonstrated that Krüppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) mediates Hh-dependent TAM M2 polarization and the immunosuppressive function. Collectively, these findings highlight a critical role for tumor-derived SHH in promoting TAM M2 polarization, a mechanism for TAM-mediated immunosuppression, and may provide insights into the design of new cancer immunotherapeutic strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633027>Nuclear receptors regulate alternative lengthening of telomeres through a novel noncanonical FANCD2 pathway.</a></h2><p>Alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) is known to use homologous recombination (HR) to replicate telomeric DNA in a telomerase-independent manner. However, the detailed process remains largely undefined. It was reported that nuclear receptors COUP-TFII and TR4 are recruited to the enriched GGGTCA variant repeats embedded within ALT telomeres, implicating nuclear receptors in regulating ALT activity. Here, we identified a function of nuclear receptors in ALT telomere maintenance that involves a direct interaction between COUP-TFII/TR4 and FANCD2, the key protein in the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway. The COUP-TFII/TR4-FANCD2 complex actively induces the DNA damage response by recruiting endonuclease MUS81 and promoting the loading of the PCNA-POLD3 replication complex in ALT telomeres. Furthermore, the COUP-TFII/TR4-mediated ALT telomere pathway does not require the FA core complex or the monoubiquitylation of FANCD2, key steps in the canonical FA pathway. Thus, our findings reveal that COUP-TFII/TR4 regulates ALT telomere maintenance through a novel noncanonical FANCD2 pathway.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Despite encouraging and sometimes durable responses in a subset of patients, most patients do not respond. Tumors have adopted the PD-1/PD-L1 axis for immune escape to facilitate tumor growth, which can be leveraged as a potential target for immune checkpoint inhibitors. On this basis, PD-L1 protein expression on tumor or immune cells emerged as the first potential predictive biomarker for sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade. The goal of our study was to evaluate PD-L1 as a predictive biomarker based on all US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug approvals of immune checkpoint inhibitors. We evaluated the primary studies associated with 45 FDA drug approvals from 2011 until April 2019. In total, there were approvals across 15 tumor types. Across all approvals, PD-L1 was predictive in only 28.9% of cases, and was either not predictive (53.3%) or not tested (17.8%) in the remaining cases. There were 9 FDA approvals linked to a specific PD-L1 threshold and companion diagnostic: bladder cancer (N = 3), non-small cell lung cancer (N = 3), triple-negative breast cancer (N = 1), cervical cancer (N = 1), and gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer (N = 1) with 8 of 9 (88.9%) with immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy. The PD-L1 thresholds were variable both within and across tumor types using several different assays, including approvals at the following PD-L1 thresholds: 1, 5, and 50%. PD-L1 expression was also measured in a variable fashion either on tumor cells, tumor-infiltrating immune cells, or both. In conclusion, our findings indicate that PD-L1 expression as a predictive biomarker has limitations and that the decision to pursue testing must be carefully implemented for clinical decision-making.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645760>MHC-II neoantigens shape tumour immunity and response to .</a></h2><p>The ability of the immune system to eliminate and shape the immunogenicity of tumours defines the process of cancer immunoediting. Immunotherapies such as those that target immune checkpoint molecules can be used to augment immune-mediated elimination of tumours and have resulted in durable responses in patients with cancer that did not respond to previous treatments. However, only a subset of patients benefit from  and more knowledge about what is required for successful treatment is needed. Although the role of tumour neoantigen-specific CD8 T cells in tumour rejection is well established, the roles of other subsets of T cells have received less attention. Here we show that spontaneous and -induced anti-tumour responses require the activity of both tumour-antigen-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells, even in tumours that do not express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. In addition, the expression of MHC class II-restricted antigens by tumour cells is required at the site of successful rejection, indicating that activation of CD4 T cells must also occur in the tumour microenvironment. These findings suggest that MHC class II-restricted neoantigens have a key function in the anti-tumour response that is nonoverlapping with that of MHC class I-restricted neoantigens and therefore needs to be considered when identifying patients who will most benefit from .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640816>Inflammatory signatures for quick diagnosis of life-threatening infection during the CAR T-cell therapy.</a></h2><p>Chimeric antigen receptor-modified (CAR) T-cell  is a novel promising therapy for treatment of B-cell malignancy. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and infection are the most common adverse events during CAR T-cell therapy. Similar clinical presentation of concurrent CRS and infection makes it difficult to differentially diagnose and timely treat the condition.We analyzed the features of infection events during the first 30 days after CAR T-cell infusion (CTI) in 109 patients from three clinical trials (ChiCTR-OPN-16008526, ChiCTR-OPC-16009113, ChiCTR-OPN-16009847). Based on the dynamic changes of interleukin (IL)-6 and ferritin, we proposed the "double peaks of IL-6" pattern as a feature of life-threatening infection during the first 30 days after CTI. Meanwhile, we screened candidate biomarkers from 70-biomarker panel to establish a prediction model for life-threatening infection.In this study, 19 patients (17.4%) experienced a total of 19 infection events during the first 30 days after CAR T-cell infusion. Eleven patients (10.1%) had grade 4-5 infection, which were all bacterial infection and predominantly sepsis (N = 9). "Double peaks of IL-6" appeared in 9 out of 11 patients with life-threatening infection. The prediction model of three-cytokines (IL-8, IL-1β and interferon-γ) could predict life-threatening infection with high sensitivity (training: 100.0%; validation: 100.0%) and specificity (training: 97.6%; validation: 82.8%). On base of the aforementioned methods, we proposed a workflow for quick identification of life-threatening infection during CAR T-cell therapy.In this study, we worked out two diagnostic methods for life-threatening infection during CAR T-cell therapy by analyzing inflammatory signatures, which contributed to reducing risks of infection-induced death.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634167>Global PD-L1 Signals and Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes: Markers of Immunogenicity in Different Subsets of Merkel Cell Carcinoma and Potential Therapeutic Implications.</a></h2><p>We previously studied the genetic and immunohistochemical profiles of subsets of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) stratified by morphology and Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) status. Recent advances in the  of this disease prompted us to examine markers of immunogenicity [PD-L1 expression and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILS) in these subsets]. The observed clinical responses to checkpoint inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway have not correlated with PD-L1 expression by MCC cells, and recent evidence suggests that functions of this pathway within the immune tumor microenvironment may be relevant. We conducted a semiquantitative (high, moderate, and minimal) immunohistochemical evaluation of the global PD-L1 signal in 52 cases of MCC, segregated in 3 subsets [pure MCPyV-positive (n = 28), pure MCPyV-negative (n = 9), and combined MCPyV-negative (n = 15)]. TILS were categorized as brisk, nonbrisk, or absent. Intersubset comparisons revealed that high global PD-L1 signals were exclusively associated with pure MCPyV-positive MCCs contrasted with virus-negative cases (P = 0.0003). Moderate signals were seen across all 3 groups. Brisk TILS were significantly associated with MCPyV-positive MCCs compared with MCPyV-negative cases (P = 0.029). Neither parameter (PD-L1 or TILS) was significantly different between the MCPyV-negative groups. Of potential clinical relevance, MCPyV seems to convey greater immunogenicity to MCCs than the high mutational burden/greater neoantigen load of MCPyV-negative cases. Interesting too is the fact that subset-related profiles of these markers mirrored those noted at genetic and immunohistochemical levels, separating pure MCPyV-positive MCCs from the virus-negative subsets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642783>Current Progresses of Functional Nanomaterials for Imaging Diagnosis and Treatment of Melanoma.</a></h2><p>Melanoma is a malignant skin tumor that results in poor disease prognosis due to unsuccessful treatment options. During the early stages of tumor progression, surgery is the primary approach that assures a good outcome. However, in the presence of metastasis, melanoma becomes almost immedicable, since the tumors can not be removed and the disease recurs easily in a short period of time. However, in recent years the combination of nanomedicine and chemotherapeutic drugs has offered promising solutions to the treatment of late-stage melanoma. Extensive studies have demonstrated that nanomaterials and their advanced applications can improve the efficacy of traditional chemotherapeutic drugs in order to overcome disadvantages, such as drug resistance, low drug delivery rate and reduced targeting to the tumor tissue. In the present review, we summarized the latest progress in imaging diagnosis and treatment of melanoma using functional nanomaterials, including polymers, liposomes, metal nanoparticles, magnetic nanoparticles and carbon-based nanoparticles.

As the only recognized aetiological treatment, the efficacy of allergen  (AIT) has been proved by many studies. However, treatment success depends on compliance and persistence greatly, which can be impaired by the lengthy duration of AIT and socioeconomic status of patients.

Currently, surgical resection combined with adjuvant chemotherapy has been standardized for OS treatment. Despite great advances in chemotherapy for OS, its clinical prognosis remains far from satisfactory; this is due to chemoresistance, which has become a major obstacle to improving OS treatment. Autophagy, a catabolic process through which cells eliminate and recycle their own damaged proteins and organelles to provide energy, can be activated by chemotherapeutic drugs. Accumulating evidence has indicated that autophagy plays the dual role in the regulation of OS chemoresistance by either promoting drug resistance or increasing drug sensitivity. The aim of the present review was to demonstrate thatautophagy has both a cytoprotective and an autophagic cell death function in OS chemoresistance. In addition, methods to detect autophagy, autophagy inducers and inhibitors, as well as autophagy‑mediated metastasis,  and clinical prognosis are also discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656319>Update Breast Cancer 2019 Part 5 - Diagnostic and Therapeutic Challenges of New, Personalised Therapies in Patients with Advanced Breast Cancer.</a></h2><p>Significant advancements have been made in recent years in advanced breast cancer and nearly all of them have been in the field of targeted therapy. Pertuzumab and trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1) have been able to be introduced in HER2-positive breast cancer. Now other anti-HER2 therapies are being developed (e.g. margetuximab, DS-8201a, pyrotinib) which can overcome other resistance mechanisms in the HER2 signalling pathway. In the field of hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer, an mTOR inhibitor and CDK4/6 inhibitors were introduced in the past. Now the introduction of the first PI3K inhibitor is forthcoming and this inhibitor will involve genetic testing of the tumour for a mutation in the PIK3CA gene. There are also significant advancements in triple-negative breast cancer: By combining chemotherapy and , an advantage for overall survival was able to be demonstrated in a subgroup (immune cells PD-L1-positive).

However, the currently adopted methods of modification of T cells pose a risk of insertional oncogenesis because lentiviral and retroviral vectors integrate the CAR transgene in a semi-random fashion. In addition, this therapy is only available using autologous cells, which create problems in production and limit the access for patients who had their T cells depleted. One modification method that shows the ability to overcome both drawbacks is the knock-in of the CAR simultaneously knocking-out genes that prevent allogeneic therapy, such as the endogenous T cell receptor. In this mini-review, we present recent efforts to develop safer universal CAR-T cells. More specifically, we focus on the combined application of target-directed nucleases, which create a double-strand break at a specific genome locus, and the delivery of CAR DNA via adeno-associated viral vectors for subsequent integration via homologous recombination and silencing of the targeted gene.

Diagnosis of EOC is frequently made at advanced stages and, despite aggressive treatments combining surgery and chemotherapy, fatal relapse rapidly occurs and is accompanied by a peritoneal carcinosis. In this context, novel therapeutical advances are urgently required. Adoptive transfer(s) of immune effector cells, including allogeneic human Vγ9Vδ2 T lymphocytes, represent attractive targets for efficiently and safely tracking tissue-invading tumor cells and controlling tumor dissemination in the organism. Our study describes the establishment of robust and physiological orthotopic model of human EOC in mouse, that includes surgical resection (ovariectomy) and chemotherapy, which are ineluctably accompanied by a fatal peritoneal carcinosis recurrence. Through a complementary set of  and  experiments, we provide here a preclinical proof of interest of the antitumor efficiency of adoptive transfers of allogeneic human Vγ9Vδ2 T lymphocytes against EOC, in association with surgical debulking and standard chemotherapies (i.e., taxanes and platinum salts). Moreover, our results indicate that chemo- and immunotherapies can be combined to improve the antitumor efficiency of immunotherapeutic lines. Altogether, these results further pave the way for next-generation antitumor immunotherapies, based on local administrations of human allogeneic human Vγ9Vδ2 T lymphocytes, in association with standard treatments.© 2019 The Author(s).

Such metrics have value in measuring the outcomes of conventional therapies, but may not be the most appropriate for new therapies. Immuno-oncology therapies offer a new approach to treating cancer by stimulating patients' immune systems to fight cancer. The value of these novel therapies has so far been assessed with traditional metrics, but the different ways in which immuno-oncology therapies work can mean the full value is not captured. Immuno-oncology therapies can produce longer survival times but this effect can be delayed or even preceded by an apparent phase of progression, which median survival or response rates may not reflect.

Although the association of type 2 diabetes with CVD has been well described, the mechanisms, risk stratification and screening strategies of CVD in type 1 diabetes (T1D) are less understood. This review aims to evaluate recent literature and guidelines regarding CVD in T1D. At the cellular level, the early stage of CVD is characterized by endothelial dysfunction. Recent studies have shown that endothelial function is unaffected in younger T1D patients but there is a significant degree of endothelial dysfunction in the older T1D population compared with healthy age-matched controls, highlighting the importance of the endothelial dysfunction in T1D as a major age-dependent cardiovascular risk factor. T1D risk assessment tools have been developed similar to those seen in type 2 diabetes. Foremost among these are the Danish Steno Type 1 risk engine, the Swedish T1D risk score, the Scottish T1D risk score and the QRISK risk calculator. The latter risk prediction tool is used for all patients but contains T1D as an independent risk variable and has the advantage of being derived from, and validated in, a large and diverse population. The latest version (QRISK3) is likely to be recommended for routine use in T1D patients in upcoming guidelines by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence. Mortality in adults with T1D is increasingly due to CVD. This is driven by hyperglycaemia-mediated oxidative stress and vascular inflammation, resulting in atherosclerosis and cardiac autonomic neuropathy. Coronary artery disease is the most significant contributor to CVD and in T1D, has a propensity towards a more silent and severe form. Routine screening of coronary artery disease does not alter outcomes and is therefore not recommended; however, risk prediction tools are being developed to aid identification of high-risk individuals for aggressive risk factor modification strategies.Copyright © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

However, most of these inhibitors are monoclonal antibodies, and their large size may limit their tumor penetration, leading to suboptimal efficacy. As a result, there has been a growing interest in developing low-molecular-weight checkpoint inhibitors.We developed a novel biopanning strategy to discover small peptide-based anti-PD-L1 inhibitors. The affinity and specificity of the peptides to PD-L1 were examined using various assays. Three-dimensional (3D) spheroid penetration study was performed to determine the tumor penetration capability of the peptides. Anti-tumor activity of the peptides was evaluated in mice bearing CT26 tumor cells.We discover several anti-PD-L1 peptide inhibitors to block PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. The peptides exhibit high affinity and specificity to human PD-L1 protein as well as PD-L1-overexpressing human cancer cells MDA-MB-231 and DU-145. Molecular docking studies indicate that the peptide CLP002 specifically binds to PD-L1 at the residues where PD-L1 interacts with PD-1. The peptide also blocks the CD80/PD-L1 interaction, which may further enhance the immune response of tumor-infiltrating T cells. Compared to antibody, the peptide CLP002 exhibits better tumor penetration in a 3D tumor spheroid model. The peptide CLP002 restores proliferation and prevents apoptosis of T cells that are co-cultured with cancer cells. The peptide CLP002 also inhibits tumor growth and increases survival of CT26 tumor-bearing mice.This study demonstrated the feasibility of using phage display to discover small peptide-based checkpoint inhibitors.

Vaccination against neoepitopes derived from patient tumor material can generate tumor-specific T cell immunity, which could reinforce the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitor therapies such as anti-PD-1 treatment. DNA vaccination is a versatile platform that allows the inclusion of multiple neoantigen-coding sequences in a single formulation and therefore represents an ideal platform for neoantigen vaccination. We developed an anti-tumor vaccine based on a synthetic DNA vector designed to contain multiple cancer-specific epitopes in tandem. The DNA vector encoded a fusion gene consisting of three neoepitopes derived from the mouse colorectal tumor MC38 and their natural flanking sequences as 40 amino acid stretches. In addition, we incorporated as reporter epitopes the helper and CTL epitope sequences of ovalbumin. The poly-neoantigen DNA vaccine elicited T cell responses to all three neoantigens and induced functional CD8 and CD4 T cell responses to the reporter antigen ovalbumin after intradermal injection in mice. The DNA vaccine was effective in preventing outgrowth of B16 melanoma expressing ovalbumin in a prophylactic setting. Moreover, the combination of therapeutic DNA vaccination and anti-PD-1 treatment was synergistic in controlling MC38 tumor growth whereas individual treatments did not succeed. These data demonstrate the potential of DNA vaccination to target multiple neoepitopes in a single formulation and highlight the cooperation between vaccine-based and checkpoint blockade immunotherapies for the successful eradication of established tumors.© 2019 The Author(s).

Notably, high DOK1 positivity in stroma cells conferred poor prognosis in patients and correlated with high levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase in CD68+ tumor-associated macrophages. In macrophages derived from human monocytic leukemia cell lines, DOK1 (i) was inducible by agonists of the anti-diabetic transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ), (ii) increased polarization towards an inflammatory phenotype, (iii) augmented nuclear factor-κB-dependent transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines and (iv) reduced PD-L1 expression. These properties empowered DOK1+ macrophages to decrease the viability of human gastric cancer cells in contact-dependent co-cultures. DOK1 also reduced PD-L1 expression in human primary blood monocytes. Our data propose that the drugability of DOK1 may be exploited to reprogram myeloid cells and enforce the innate immune response against EBV+ human gastric cancer.© 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642347>Role of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of colorectal cancer: focus on nivolumab.</a></h2><p>: Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is a challenging disease, whose systemic therapy has traditionally been based on a generalized population of patients, with unsatisfactory clinical outcomes.  has been shown to be efficacious in hypermutated tumors, such as those with microsatellite-instability (MSI-H). Nivolumab, and other immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), have recently been evaluated in MSI-H mCRC, with remarkable results. : Focused on nivolumab, we aim to present the rationale for the applicability of ICI in MSI-H CRC, and the results of completed phase I/II studies.

Herein, we utilized bioactive polysaccharides extracted from a natural herb Astragalus membranaceus and developed polysaccharide nanoparticles (ANP) that can reverse TEM and accordingly, enhance the radiation-induced abscopal effect. ANP showed ability to prolong the survival rate of tumor-bearing mice. In addition, ANP dramatically inhibited the growth of the primary tumor subjected to radiation, as well as the secondary tumor distant from the primary lesion. Mechanistic study demonstrated that ANP-induced immune response was mainly reflected by DC activation, represented by phenotypic maturation and enhanced antigen presentation through TLR4 signaling pathway. Mature DC induced by ANP migrated to tumor-draining lymph node and initiated T cell expansion. Specifically, DC activation was successfully translated into an increase of CD4+ T/Treg and CD8+ T/Treg ratio within both primary (irradiated) and secondary (unirradiated) tumors. Our results also indicated that the systemic anti-tumor immune response and immune memory were enhanced with the increase of IFN-γ production and effector memory T cell population.

Here, we show that Cxxc finger protein 1 (Cxxc1) promoted the generation of T17 cells as an epigenetic regulator and prevented their differentiation into T cells. Mice with a T cell-specific deletion of Cxxc1 were protected from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and were more susceptible to  infection. Cxxc1 deficiency decreased IL-6Rα expression and impeded IL-6/STAT3 signaling, whereas the overexpression of IL-6Rα could partially reverse the defects in -deficient T17 cells in vitro and in vivo. Genome-wide occupancy analysis revealed that Cxxc1 bound to α gene loci by maintaining the appropriate H3K4me3 modification of its promoter. Therefore, these data highlight that Cxxc1 as a key regulator governs the balance between T17 and T cells by controlling the expression of IL-6Rα, which affects IL-6/STAT3 signaling and has an impact on T17-related autoimmune diseases.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Autosomal-dominant inheritance of a R94Q mutation in MFN2 causes the axonal subtype 2A2A which is characterized by early onset and progressive atrophy of distal muscles caused by motoneuronal degeneration. Here, we studied mitochondrial shape, respiration, cytosolic, and mitochondrial ATP content as well as mitochondrial quality control in MFN2-deficient fibroblasts stably expressing wildtype or R94Q MFN2. Under normal culture conditions, R94Q cells had slightly more fragmented mitochondria but a similar mitochondrial oxygen consumption, membrane potential, and ATP production as wildtype cells. However, when inducing mild oxidative stress 24 h before analysis using 100 µM hydrogen peroxide, R94Q cells exhibited significantly increased respiration but decreased mitochondrial ATP production. This was accompanied by increased glucose uptake and an up-regulation of hexokinase 1 and pyruvate kinase M2, suggesting increased pyruvate shuttling into mitochondria. Interestingly, these changes coincided with decreased levels of PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy in R94Q cells. We conclude that mitochondria harboring the disease-causing R94Q mutation in MFN2 are more susceptible to oxidative stress, which causes uncoupling of respiration and ATP production possibly by a less efficient mitochondrial quality control.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635553>NGS-analysis to the rescue: dual checkpoint inhibition in metastatic osteosarcoma - a case report and review of the literature.</a></h2><p>: The prognosis and treatment of metastatic osteosarcoma have not changed in the last decades and the responses to chemotherapy in this setting are disappointing. In the past years,  has found its place in the treatment of different tumor types. Its role in the treatment of sarcomas, and in particular osteosarcoma, is less clear. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) can help identify patients who could benefit from .  Single case study and review of the literature : We discuss a case of a 26-year-old man with a metastatic osteosarcoma not responsive to several lines of standard chemotherapy. NGS-analysis of resected tumor tissue revealed amplification of PD-L1 and PD-L2, which is associated in literature with response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in other tumor types and in osteosarcoma mouse models. Treatment of our patient with the combination of an anti-PD-1 antibody (Nivolumab) and an anti-CTLA4 antibody (Ipilimumab) showed a stabilization of life-threatening retrocardiac tumoral masses that had previous significantly progressed despite radiotherapy, while one bone lesion in the right os ilium was growing and needed treatment with concomitant radiotherapy.  To our knowledge, this is the first case report of a metastasized osteosarcoma patient with no further standard treatment options being treated with dual checkpoint inhibition. A complete stabilization of life-threatening retrocardiac lesions could be achieved and with the addition of radiotherapy to a growing bone lesion, the patient is still doing well. NGS-analysis can help identify druggable targets in patients with rare tumors with limited treatment options.

Since MSI is associated with a poor response to 5-fluorouracile based chemotherapy and is a positive predictive marker of , it is routine practice to evaluate the MSI status of resected tumors in CRC patients. MSIsensor is a novel computational tool for determining MSI status using Next Generation Sequencing. However, it is not widely used in the clinic and has not been independently validated in exome data from CRC. To facilitate clinical implementation of computational determination of MSI status, we compared MSIsensor to current gold standard methods for MSI testing.MSI status was determined for 130 CRC patients (UICC stage I-IV) using immunohistochemistry, PCR based microsatellite stability testing and by applying MSIsensor to exome sequenced tumors and paired germline DNA. Furthermore, we investigated correlation between MSI status, mutational load and mutational signatures.Eighteen out of 130 (13.8%) patients were microsatellite instable. We found a 100% agreement between MSIsensor and gold standard methods for MSI testing. All MSI tumors were hypermutated. In addition, two microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors were hypermutated, which was explained by a dominant POLE signature and pathogenic POLE mutations (p.Pro286Arg and p.Ser459Phe).MSIsensor is a robust tool, which can be used to determine MSI status of tumor samples from exome sequenced CRC patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636098>Macrophage derived CXCL9 and CXCL10 are required for anti-tumor immune responses following immune checkpoint blockade.</a></h2><p>Response rates to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB; anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4) correlate with the extent of tumor immune infiltrate but the mechanisms underlying the recruitment of T cells following therapy are poorly characterized. A greater understanding of these processes may see the development of therapeutic interventions that enhance T cell recruitment and, consequently, improved patient outcomes. We therefore investigated the chemokines essential for immune cell recruitment and subsequent therapeutic efficacy of these immunotherapies.The chemokines upregulated by dual PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade were assessed using nanosting-based analysis with results confirmed at the protein level by flow cytometry and cytometric bead array. Blocking/neutralizing antibodies confirmed the requirement for key chemokines/cytokines and immune effector cells. Results were confirmed in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors using single-cell RNAseq and paired survival analyses.The CXCR3 ligands, CXCL9 and CXCL10, were significantly upregulated following dual PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade and both CD8 T cell infiltration and therapeutic efficacy were CXCR3 dependent. In both murine models and patients undergoing , macrophages were the predominant source of CXCL9 and their depletion abrogated CD8 T cell infiltration and the therapeutic efficacy of dual immune checkpoint blockade. Single cell RNA-seq analysis of patient TILs revealed that CXCL9/10/11 was predominantly expressed by macrophages following ICB and we identified a distinct macrophage signature that was associated with positive responses to immune checkpoint blockade.These data underline the fundamental importance of macrophage-derived CXCR3 ligands for the therapeutic efficacy of ICB and highlight the potential of manipulating this axis to enhance patient responses.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647675>Massively-Parallelized, Deterministic Mechanoporation for Intracellular Delivery.</a></h2><p>Microfluidic intracellular delivery approaches based on plasma membrane poration have shown promise for addressing the limitations of conventional cellular engineering techniques in a wide range of applications in biology and medicine. However, the inherent stochasticity of the poration process in many of these approaches often results in a trade-off between delivery efficiency and cellular viability, thus potentially limiting their utility. Herein, we present a novel microfluidic device concept that mitigates this trade-off by providing opportunity for deterministic mechanoporation (DMP) of cells en masse. This is achieved by the impingement of each cell upon a single needle-like penetrator during aspiration-based capture, followed by diffusive influx of exogenous cargo through the resulting membrane pore, once the cells are released by reversal of flow. Massive parallelization enables high throughput operation, while single-site poration allows for delivery of small and large-molecule cargos in difficult-to-transfect cells with efficiencies and viabilities that exceed both conventional and emerging transfection techniques. As such, DMP shows promise for advancing cellular engineering practice in general and engineered cell product manufacturing in particular.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640697>MAP4K3/GLK in autoimmune disease, cancer and aging.</a></h2><p>MAP4K3 (also named GLK) is a serine/threonine kinase, which belongs to the mammalian Ste20-like kinase family. At 22 years of age, GLK was initially cloned and identified as an upstream activator of the MAPK JNK under an environmental stress and proinflammatory cytokines. The data derived from GLK-overexpressing or shRNA-knockdown cell lines suggest that GLK may be involved in cell proliferation through mTOR signaling. GLK phosphorylates the transcription factor TFEB and retains TFEB in the cytoplasm, leading to inhibition of cell autophagy. After generating and characterizing GLK-deficient mice, the important in vivo roles of GLK in T-cell activation were revealed. In T cells, GLK directly interacts with and activates PKCθ through phosphorylating PKCθ at Ser-538 residue, leading to activation of IKK/NF-κB. Thus, GLK-deficient mice display impaired T-cell-mediated immune responses and decreased inflammatory phenotypes in autoimmune disease models. Consistently, the percentage of GLK-overexpressing T cells is increased in the peripheral blood from autoimmune disease patients; the GLK-overexpressing T cell population is correlated with disease severity of patients. The pathogenic mechanism of autoimmune disease by GLK overexpression was unraveled by characterizing T-cell-specific GLK transgenic mice and using biochemical analyses. GLK overexpression selectively promotes IL-17A transcription by inducing the AhR-RORγt complex in T cells. In addition, GLK overexpression in cancer tissues is correlated with cancer recurrence of human lung cancer and liver cancer; the predictive power of GLK overexpression for cancer recurrence is higher than that of pathologic stage. GLK directly phosphorylates and activates IQGAP1, resulting in induction of Cdc42-mediated cell migration and cancer metastasis. Furthermore, treatment of GLK inhibitor reduces disease severity of mouse autoimmune disease models and decreases IL-17A production of human autoimmune T cells. Due to the inhibitory function of HPK1/MAP4K1 in T-cell activation and the promoting effects of GLK on tumorigenesis, HPK1 and GLK dual inhibitors could be useful therapeutic drugs for cancer . In addition, GLK deficiency results in extension of lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans and mice. Taken together, targeting MAP4K3 (GLK) may be useful for treating/preventing autoimmune disease, cancer metastasis/recurrence, and aging.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636701>De Novo Isolation & Affinity Maturation of yeast-displayed Virion-binding human fibronectin domains by flow cytometric screening against Virions.</a></h2><p>The promise of biopharmaceuticals comprising one or more binding domains motivates the development of novel methods for de novo isolation and affinity maturation of virion-binding domains. Identifying avenues for overcoming the challenges associated with using virions as screening reagents is paramount given the difficulties associated with obtaining high-purity virus-associated proteins that retain the conformation exhibited on the virion surface.Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) of 1.5 × 10 clones taken from a naïve yeast surface-displayed human fibronectin domain (Fn3) against whole virions yielded two unique binders to Zika virions. Construction and FACS of site-directed binding loop mutant libraries based on one of these binders yielded multiple progeny clones with enhanced Zika-binding affinities. These affinity-matured clones bound Zika virions with low double- or single-digit nanomolar affinity in ELISA assays, and expressed well as soluble proteins in  shake flask culture, with post-purification yields exceeding 10 mg/L.FACS of a yeast-displayed binding domain library is an efficient method for de novo isolation of virion-binding domains. Affinities of isolated virion-binding clones are readily enhanced via FACS screening of mutant progeny libraries. Given that most binding domains are compatible with yeast display, the approach taken in this work may be broadly utilized for generating virion-binding domains against many different viruses for use in passive  and the prevention of viral infection.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637423>Differential localization of PD-L1 and Akt-1 involvement in radioresistant and radiosensitive cell lines of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.</a></h2><p> by blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint demonstrated amazing tumor response in advanced cancer patients including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However, the majority of HNSCC patients still show little improvement or even hyperprogression. Irradiation is currently investigated as synergistic treatment modality to  as it increases the number of Tcells thereby enhancing efficacy of . Apart from this immunogenic context a growing amount of data indicates that PD-L1 also plays an intrinsic role in cancer cells by regulating different cellular functions like cell proliferation or migration. Here, we demonstrate opposing membrane localization of PD-L1 in vital and apoptotic cell populations of radioresistant (RR) and radiosensitive (RS) HNSCC cell lines up to 72 h after irradiation using flow cytometry. Moreover, strong PD-L1 expression was found in nuclear and cytoplasmic cell fractions of RR. After irradiation PD-L1 decreased in nuclear fractions and increased in cytoplasmic fractions of RR cells. In contrast, RS cell lines did not express PD-L1, neither in the nucleus nor in cytoplasmic fractions. Additionally, overexpression of PD-L1 in RS cells led to a proportional increase of vital PD-L1 positive cells after irradiation. Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed an interaction between Akt-1 and PD-L1, mostly in irradiated RR cells compared to RS cells suggesting a differential influence of PD-L1 on cell signaling. In summary, our data imply the need for different therapeutic strategies dependent on the molecular context in which PD-L1 is embedded.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press.

Surgery, chemo, and radiation therapy have been the only options available until today to combat this major problem. Chemotherapeutic drugs have been used for treatment for more than 50 years. Unfortunately, these drugs have inherent cytotoxicities and tumor cells have started inducing resistance against these drugs. Other common techniques such as surgery and radiotherapy have their own drawbacks. Therefore, such techniques are incompetent tools to alleviate the disease efficiently without any adverse effects. This scenario has inspired researchers to develop alternative techniques with enhanced therapeutic effects and minimal side effects. Such techniques include targeted therapy, liposomal therapy, hormonal therapy, and , etc. However, these therapies are expensive and not effective enough. Furthermore, researchers have conjugated therapeutic agents or drugs with different molecules, delivery vectors, and/or imaging modalities to combat such problems and enhance the therapeutic effect. This conjugation technique has led to the development of bioconjugation therapy, in which at least one molecule is of biological origin. These bioconjugates are the new therapeutic strategies, having prospective synergistic antitumor effects and have potency to overcome the complications being produced by chemo drugs. Herein, we provide an overview of various bioconjugates developed so far, as well as their classification, characteristics, and targeting approach for cancer. Additionally, the most popular nanostructures based on their organic or inorganic origin (metallic, magnetic, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, and silica nanoparticles) characterized as nanocarriers are also discussed.

However, in the case of advanced cSCC (acSCC), a multimodality approach also involving systemic therapies needs to be considered.One hundred and ninety-five patients diagnosed with acSCC (stages III and IV) treated in our centre between 2011 and 2018 were included. Patient and tumour characteristics along with treatment patterns were documented and analyzed. Descriptive analysis was performed and survival rates were estimated according to Kaplan-Meier and compared with the Log-rank test. Follow-up was defined as the time between diagnosis of advanced disease and last contact or death. All causes of death were considered as events.The median follow-up was 21 months [IQR = (10.0; 21.0)]. The median age at time of advanced disease diagnosis was 78 years [IQR = (72; 84)], with 40.5% of the patients in stage III and 59.5% in stage IV. One hundred and forty-five patients had resectable tumours. In this group the median overall survival (mOS) was 59 months (95% CI: 28.2-89.8), significantly higher than the mOS in patients with inoperable tumour [n = 50; mOS: 19 months (96% CI: 7-31, P <0.0001)].

A critical challenge in using the ICD inducers in cancer  is the immunotoxicity accompanying their antiproliferative effects. To alleviate this, a nanocapsule formulation of carfilzomib (CFZ), an ICD-inducing proteasome inhibitor, was developed using interfacial supramolecular assembly of tannic acid (TA) and iron, supplemented with albumin coating. The albumin-coated CFZ nanocapsules (CFZ-pTA-alb) attenuated CFZ release, reducing toxicity to immune cells. Moreover, due to the adhesive nature of TA assembly, CFZ-pTA-alb served as a reservoir of damage-associated molecular patterns released from dying tumor cells to activate dendritic cells. Upon intratumoral administration, CFZ-pTA-alb prolonged tumor retention of CFZ and showed consistently greater antitumor effects than cyclodextrin-solubilized CFZ (CFZ-CD) in B16F10 and CT26 tumor models. Unlike CFZ-CD, the locally injected CFZ-pTA-alb protected or enhanced CD8+ T cell population in tumors, helped develop splenocytes with tumor-specific interferon- response, and delayed tumor development on the contralateral side in immunocompetent mice (but not in athymic nude mice), which support that CFZ-pTA-alb contributed to activating antitumor immunity. This study demonstrates that sustained delivery of ICD inducers by TA-based nanocapsules is an effective way of translating local ICD induction to systemic antitumor immunity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632820>Emphysema assessment for personalized  response prediction in lung cancer patients.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651363>Systemic and local immunity following adoptive transfer of NY-ESO-1 SPEAR T cells in synovial sarcoma.</a></h2><p>Gene-modified autologous T cells expressing NY-ESO-1, an affinity-enhanced T-cell receptor (TCR) reactive against the NY-ESO-1-specific HLA-A*02-restricted peptide SLLMWITQC (NY-ESO-1 SPEAR T-cells; GSK 794), have demonstrated clinical activity in patients with advanced synovial sarcoma (SS). The factors contributing to gene-modified T-cell expansion and the changes within the tumor microenvironment (TME) following T-cell infusion remain unclear. These studies address the immunological mechanisms of response and resistance in patients with SS treated with NY-ESO-1 SPEAR T-cells.Four cohorts were included to evaluate antigen expression and preconditioning on efficacy. Clinical responses were assessed by RECIST v1.1. Engineered T-cell persistence was determined by qPCR. Serum cytokines were evaluated by immunoassay. Transcriptomic analyses and immunohistochemistry were performed on tumor biopsies from patients before and after T-cell infusion. Gene-modified T-cells were detected within the TME via an RNAish assay.Responses across cohorts were affected by preconditioning and intra-tumoral NY-ESO-1 expression. Of the 42 patients reported (data cut-off 4June2018), 1 patient had a complete response, 14 patients had partial responses, 24 patients had stable disease, and 3 patients had progressive disease. The magnitude of gene-modified T-cell expansion shortly after infusion was associated with response in patients with high intra-tumoral NY-ESO-1 expression. Patients receiving a fludarabine-containing conditioning regimen experienced increases in serum IL-7 and IL-15. Prior to infusion, the TME exhibited minimal leukocyte infiltration; CD163 tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) were the dominant population. Modest increases in intra-tumoral leukocytes (≤5%) were observed in a subset of subjects at approximately 8 weeks. Beyond 8 weeks post infusion, the TME was minimally infiltrated with a TAM-dominant leukocyte infiltrate. Tumor-associated antigens and antigen presentation did not significantly change within the tumor post-T-cell infusion. Finally, NY-ESO-1 SPEAR T cells trafficked to the TME and maintained cytotoxicity in a subset of patients.Our studies elucidate some factors that underpin response and resistance to NY-ESO-1 SPEAR T-cell therapy. From these data, we conclude that a lymphodepletion regimen containing high doses of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide is necessary for SPEAR T-cell persistence and efficacy.

However, such clinical benefit is limited because of the insufficient reinvigoration of antitumor immunity with the drug alone; therefore, rational therapeutic combinations are required to improve its efficacy. In our preclinical study, we evaluated the antitumor effect of U3-1402, a human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3)-targeting antibody-drug conjugate, and its potential synergism with PD-1 inhibition. Using a syngeneic mouse tumor model that is refractory to anti-PD-1 therapy, treatment with U3-1402 exhibited an obvious antitumor effect via direct lysis of tumor cells. Disruption of tumor cells by U3-1402 enhanced the infiltration of innate and adaptive immune cells. Chemotherapy with exatecan derivative (Dxd: the drug payload of U3-1402) revealed that the enhanced antitumor immunity produced by U3-1402 was associated with the induction of alarmins including HMGB-1 via tumor-specific cytotoxicity. Notably, U3-1402 significantly sensitized the tumor to PD-1 blockade, as a combination of U3-1402 and the PD-1 inhibitor significantly enhanced antitumor immunity. Further, clinical analyses indicated that tumor-specific HER3 expression was frequently observed in patients with PD-1 inhibitor-resistant solid tumors. Overall, U3-1402 is a promising candidate as a partner of  for such patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632773>Hyperprogressive disease with : new directions.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659111>The Activity of Immune Checkpoint Inhibition in KRAS Mutated Non-small Cell Lung Cancer: A Single Centre Experience.</a></h2><p>KRAS mutation is the most frequent molecular alteration found in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It is associated with a poor prognosis without available targeted therapy. Treatment options for NSCLC have been recently enriched by the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), and data about their efficacy in patients with KRAS-mutant NSCLC are discordant. This study assessed the routine efficacy of ICIs in advanced KRAS-mutant NSCLC.All stage IV NSCLC patients treated in our institution from January 2016 to December 2017 with  were included in our analysis. We collected the status of KRAS and other mutations, as well as the type of ICI administered. We assessed four clinical outcomes: i) disease control rate (DCR), ii) partial response (PR), iii) progression-free survival (PFS) and iv) overall survival (OS).A total of 45 patients were initially identified but 7 were excluded due to insufficient clinical data, so 38 were included in the end. In the KRAS wild-type cohort, the DCR was 59% with 49% PR, while the PFS was 8.4 months and OS 16.8 months. Among KRAS mutated patients, results were more favourable, the DCR was 81%, with 62% PR. PFS was 13.6 months and OS was 18.5 months. The median follow-up was 24 months (17 to 34 months) and 7 patients were still on treatment at the time of analysis.Our data suggest that KRAS mutation is predictive of a superior response to .

Studies show, however, that DC vaccine priming of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) requires the activity of endogenous DC, suggesting that exogenous DC stimulate anti-tumor immunity by transferring antigen (Ag) to endogenous DC. Such Ag transfer functions are most commonly ascribed to monocytes, implying that undifferentiated monocytes would function equally well as a vaccine modality and need not be differentiated to DC to be effective. Here, we used several murine cancer models to test the anti-tumor efficacy of undifferentiated monocytes loaded with protein or peptide Ag. Intravenously injected monocytes displayed anti-tumor activity superior to DC vaccines in several cancer models, including aggressive intracranial glioblastoma. Ag-loaded monocytes induced robust CTL responses via Ag transfer to splenic CD8+ DC in a manner independent of monocyte APC activity. Ag transfer required cell-cell contact and the formation of connexin 43-containing gap junctions between monocytes and DC. These findings demonstrate the existence of an efficient gap junction-mediated Ag transfer pathway between monocytes and CD8+ DC and suggest that administration of tumor Ag-loaded undifferentiated monocytes may serve as a simple and efficacious  for the treatment of human cancers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642134>Intradermal reactivity to two concentrations of pollen extracts in atopic dogs.</a></h2><p>Intradermal test (IDT) is used widely for determination of allergens to include in allergen-specific  (AIT).

In addition to the hospital's standard IDT concentration of 1,000 PNU/mL for pollen allergens, five pollen allergens of higher concentration (3,000-8,000 PNU/mL) had been added at the beginning of that period. The IDT scores for the standard test concentration of each of the five allergens were compared to the scores for the higher concentration.Positive reactions occurred much more commonly to the higher test concentration for each of the paired allergens (P < 0.05, chi-square). The AIT formulation was different in 58% of the dogs from what it would have been without the higher concentration allergens.The current standard IDT concentration of 1,000 PNU/mL for pollen allergens is likely too low, possibly resulting in inaccurate AIT formulations.

PD-1/PD-L1 interactions cause functional exhaustion of effector T cells and impair antitumor immunity, allowing tumors to escape immune surveillance. In addition to such extrinsic interactions, tumors proliferate by transmitting intrinsic PD-L1 signals via mTOR pathway. Here, we simultaneously silenced PD-1 and PD-L1 expression on CTLs and colon tumors using PD-1 siRNA/PD-L1 siRNA-loaded PLGA nanoparticles and investigated functional activation of tumor-specific CTLs. When compared to a single PD-1 silencing on CTLs or a single PD-L1 silencing on tumors, co-silencing of PD-1/PD-L1 on CTLs and tumors more efficiently promoted effector functions of tumor-specific CTLs. Moreover, PD-L1-silenced tumors inhibited mTOR signaling and showed an antiproliferative response independently of adaptive immune response. Ultimately, systemic administration of PD-1 and PD-L1 siRNA via PLGA nanoparticles restored the effector functions of tumor-specific CTLs in MC38 tumor-bearing mice. Compared with antitumor effects of PD-1 or PD-L1 single silencing alone, co-silencing of PD-1 and PD-L1 showed more significant tumor growth suppression and long-term tumor inhibition in colon cancer.

Like many infectious agents, EBV has evolved strategies to block host cell death, including through expression of viral homologues of cellular BCL-2 pro-survival proteins (vBCL-2s), such as BHRF1. Small molecule inhibitors of the cellular pro-survival BCL-2 family proteins, termed 'BH3-mimetics', have entered clinical trials for blood cancers with the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax already approved for treatment of therapy refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and acute myeloid leukaemia in the elderly. The generation of BH3-mimetics that could specifically target vBCL-2 proteins may be an attractive therapeutic option for virus-associated cancers, since these drugs would be expected to only kill virally infected cells with only minimal side effects on normal healthy tissues. To achieve this, a better understanding of the contribution of vBCL-2 proteins to tumorigenesis and insights into their biochemical functions is needed. In the context of Burkitt lymphoma (BL), BHRF1 expression conferred strong resistance to diverse apoptotic stimuli. Furthermore, BHRF1 expression in mouse haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells accelerated MYC-induced lymphoma development in a model of BL. BHRF1 interacts with the cellular pro-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins, BIM, BID, PUMA and BAK, but its capability to inhibit apoptosis could not be mapped solely to one of these interactions, suggesting plasticity is a key feature of BHRF1. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed a site in BHRF1 that was critical for its interaction with PUMA and blocking DNA-damage-induced apoptosis, identifying a potentially therapeutically targetable vulnerability in BHRF1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652082>Bempegaldesleukin (NKTR-214): a CD-122-biased IL-2 receptor agonist for cancer .</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657111>Combinatorial prediction of marker panels from single-cell transcriptomic data.</a></h2><p>Single-cell transcriptomic studies are identifying novel cell populations with exciting functional roles in various in vivo contexts, but identification of succinct gene marker panels for such populations remains a challenge.

During this procedure, autologous tissue is excised, relocated, and reattached using vascular anastomoses at the site of the extirpated breast. The period during which the tissue is ex vivo may allow genetic modification without any systemic exposure to the vector. Could such access be used to deliver therapeutic agents using the tissue flap as a vehicle? Such delivery may be more efficient than systemic treatment, in terms of oncological outcomes. The cytokine interferon gamma (IFNγ) has antitumor effects, but systemic toxicity that could be circumvented if its effect can be localized by delivery of the IFNγ gene via gene therapy to autologous tissue used for breast reconstruction, which then releases IFNγ and exerts anti-tumor effects. In a rat model of loco-regional recurrence (LRR) using both MADB-106-Luc and MAD-MB-231-Luc breast cancer cells, autologous tissue was transduced ex vivo with an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) encoding IFNγ. The therapeutic reconstruction released IFNγ at the LRR site and eliminated cancer cells, significantly decreased tumor burden (P<0.05), and increased survival by 33% (P<0.05) compared to sham reconstruction. Mechanistically, localized IFNγ  stimulated M1 macrophages to target cancer cells within the regional confines of the modified tumor environment.

IL-33 is released from stressed or necrotic cells. Initially, IL-33 was described as an inducer of the humoral immune response, which activated Th2 cells and mast cells involved in modulating inflammation and allergic reactions. In addition, IL-33 acts as a stimulator of the Th1, NK, and CD8T cells, which induce a cytotoxic immune response against intracellular pathogens. It was recently discovered that this cytokine is involved in the development of cancer by performing both pro- and antitumor functions. IL-33 can directly affect tumor cells and provokes their proliferation, survival, and metastasis. Moreover, IL-33 stimulates carcinogenesis by remodeling the tumor microenvironment and inducing angiogenesis, thus contributing to the generation of immunosuppressive conditions. At the same time, IL-33 causes tumor infiltration with cytotoxic CD8 T lymphocytes and natural killers, which leads to cytolysis-mediated cancer cell death. This review describes the versatile role of the IL-33/ST2 cascade in the development of experimental and clinical tumors. In addition, we discuss the prospects for the application of IL-33 and ST2 as diagnostic biomarkers and targets for cancer .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635973>Immune checkpoint inhibitors: For how long do we need to release the brakes to achieve the optimum acceleration of immune-mediated anti-tumor response?</a></h2><p>In recent years, cancer  has emerged as the fourth pillar of cancer therapy alongside surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

To study FOXC2's influence on melanoma progression, we generated a FOXC2-deficient murine melanoma cell line and evaluated The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patient datasets.We compared tumor growth kinetics and RNA-seq/qRT-PCR gene expression profiles from wild-type versus FOXC2-deficient murine melanomas. We also performed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of TCGA data to assess the influence of FOXC2 gene expression on melanoma patients' response to chemotherapy and .FOXC2 promotes melanoma progression and regulates the expression of genes associated with multiple oncogenic pathways, including the oxidative stress response, xenobiotic metabolism, and interferon responsiveness. FOXC2 expression in melanoma correlates negatively with patient response to chemotherapy and .FOXC2 drives a tumor-promoting gene expression program in melanoma and is a prognostic indicator of patient response to multiple cancer therapies.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

Mucin1 (MUC1), an epithelial glycoprotein, is hypo-glycosylated and overexpressed on epithelial cancers. This renders it a promising target for potential immunotherapeutic approaches. However, MUC1 has also been identified on T cells, which might complicate its potential as a target for immunotherapies.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, lack of effect in some patients made it imperative to identify other pathways that are exploited by cancer cells to circumvent immune surveillance, and possibly synergize immune checkpoint treatment in those cases. It has been recently recognized that adenosine levels increase significantly in the tumor microenvironment and that adenosine/adenosine receptors play a powerful role as immunosuppressive and attenuating several effector T cell functions. The two main enzymes responsible for generating adenosine in the microenvironment are the ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73, the former utilizes both ATP and ADP and produces AMP while the latter utilizes AMP and generates adenosine. Thus, these two enzymes combined are the major source for the bulk of adenosine produced in the microenvironment. They were shown to be validated targets in oncology leading to several clinical trials that include small molecules as well as antibodies, showing positive and encouraging results in the preclinical arena. Towards the development of novel drugs to target these enzymes, we have developed a platform that can be utilized to monitor the activities of both enzymes in vitro (biochemical) as well as in cells (cell based) assays. We have developed very sensitive and homogenous assays that enabled us to monitor the activity of both enzymes and demonstrate selectivity of known inhibitors as well as monoclonal antibodies. This should speed up screening for novel inhibitors that might lead to more effective cancer therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659314>Teamwork by different T-cell types boosts tumour destruction by .</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658426>CD103 T and Dendritic Cells Indicate a Favorable Prognosis in Oral Cancer.</a></h2><p>T cells and dendritic cells (DCs) that are positive for the tissue-resident marker CD103 play a vital role in antitumor immunity. In this study, multiplexed immunohistochemistry was applied to stain CD103 and the T-cell marker CD8 as well as the DC marker CD11c on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) tissues. Then, the density of CD103CD8 and CD103CD11c tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the intratumoral and stromal regions was calculated, and the correlation of CD103CD8 TIL and CD103CD11c TIL density with OSCC patient prognosis was analyzed. The results revealed that CD103CD8 TILs and CD103CD11c TILs were abundant in the stromal region and that increased stromal CD103CD8 TIL and intratumoral CD103CD11c TIL density indicated a favorable prognosis. Moreover, we freshly isolated TILs from OSCC samples and performed flow cytometry to verify that CD103CD8 TILs display a tissue-resident memory T-cell (Trm) phenotype, and we discriminated CD103CD11c TILs from tumor-associated macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652645>Epigenetic Reprogramming for Targeting -Mutant Malignant Gliomas.</a></h2><p>Targeting the epigenome has been considered a compelling treatment modality for several cancers, including gliomas. Nearly 80% of the lower-grade gliomas and secondary glioblastomas harbor recurrent mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (). Mutant IDH generates high levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) that inhibit various components of the epigenetic machinery, including histone and DNA demethylases. The encouraging results from current epigenetic therapies in hematological malignancies have reinvigorated the interest in solid tumors and gliomas, both preclinically and clinically. Here, we summarize the recent advancements in epigenetic therapy for lower-grade gliomas and discuss the challenges associated with current treatment options. A particular focus is placed on therapeutic mechanisms underlying favorable outcome with epigenetic-based drugs in basic and translational research of gliomas. This review also highlights emerging bridges to combination treatment with respect to epigenetic drugs. Given that epigenetic therapies, particularly DNA methylation inhibitors, increase tumor immunogenicity and antitumor immune responses, appropriate drug combinations with immune checkpoint inhibitors may lead to improvement of treatment effectiveness of , ultimately leading to tumor cell eradication.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648806>Host-Pathogen Interactions in Coccidioidomycosis: Prognostic Clues and Opportunities for Novel Therapies.</a></h2><p>Coccidioidomycosis (CM) is a systemic fungal disease caused by the dimorphic fungi Coccidioides immitis and Coccidioides posadasii. In its endemic areas of the United States, CM is growing as a public health challenge with a marked increase in incidence in the last 15 years. Although Coccidioides infection is asymptomatic in most cases, symptomatic pulmonary disease occurs in ~40% and disseminated coccidioidomycosis (DCM) occurs in ~1% of previously healthy children and adults. DCM is markedly more common in immunocompromised people, who often experience life-threatening disease despite use of antifungal medications. Although options for antifungal therapy have improved, lifelong therapy is needed for those who develop coccidioidal meningitis. The purpose of this article was to review the state of antifungal therapy and recent studies of host-pathogen interactions in CM in light of advances in immunomodulatory therapy.The study included a review of PubMed and abstracts of the Coccidioidomycosis Study Group (years 2000-2019).Current therapy for CM relies upon azole and polyene antifungal agents. Murine models and studies of DCM in patients with monogenic primary immunodeficiency states and acquired immunodeficiency have revealed the importance of both innate and adaptive immune responses in the control of infections with Coccidioides species. In particular, defects in sensing of fungi and induction of cellular immune responses have been frequently reported. More recently, polymorphisms in key signaling pathways and in the generation of Th17 and Th1 immune responses have been linked with DCM.Antifungal therapy is sufficient to control disease in most cases of CM, but treatment failure occurs in cases of severe pulmonary disease and nonmeningeal disseminated disease. Lifelong therapy is recommended for meningitis in view of the very high risk of recurrence. Corticosteroid therapy is advised by some experts for severe pulmonary disease and for some neurologic complications of DCM. DCM is only rarely the result of a severe monogenic immunodeficiency. Case studies suggest that reorienting cellular immune responses or augmenting effector immune responses may help resolve DCM. Systematic investigation of  for coccidioidomycosis is advisable and may help to address the recent marked increase in reports of the disease in endemic areas.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In the current study, the authors explored the association between types of fat and survival in patients treated with .A retrospective analysis of 90 patients who were treated with  on phase 1 clinical trials at the Winship Cancer Institute in Atlanta, Georgia, from 2009 through 2017 was performed. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were used to measure clinical outcomes. Baseline BMI and radiographic images at the middle of the third lumbar vertebrae were obtained. Fat densities were calculated and converted to indices (subcutaneous fat index [SFI], intermuscular fat index [IFI], and visceral fat index [VFI]) after dividing by height in meters squared. Risk groups were created using recursive partitioning and the regression trees method for SFI and IFI, which were selected by stepwise variable selection among all fat-related variables. The Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier method were used for the association with OS and PFS.The majority of patients (59%) were male and diagnosed with melanoma (33%) or gastrointestinal cancers (22%). The median BMI was 27.4 kg/m , the median SFI was 62.78, the median IFI was 4.06, and the median VFI was 40.53. Low-risk patients (those with an SFI ≥73) had a significantly longer OS (hazard ratio, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.09-0.46 [P < .001]) and PFS (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20-0.72 [P = .003]) compared with patients at intermediate risk (those with an SFI <73 and IFI <3.4) and poor risk (those with an SFI <73 and IFI ≥3.4). The Uno concordance statistics were found to be higher for fat risk groups than BMI in predicting OS (0.603 vs 0.574; P = .581) and PFS (0.602 vs 0.586; P = .71).Increased BMI, increased SFI, and decreased IFI may be associated with prolonged survival in patients with cancer who are treated with .

We aimed to study the efficacy, and safety of an immunomodulatory therapeutic agent, diphenylcyclopropenone, while manifesting the association with histopathological features, prognostic factors and side effects. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, 98 patients (60 men, 38 women) with alopecia who were referred to the ?Hair Disease Polyclinic? at Department of Dermatology between 2011 and 2015 were included. Together with medical histories and dermatological examinations, all patients were taken a skin biopsy for histopathological examination prior to the therapy. Therapeutic success was evaluated on the basis of hair re-growth percentage. Results Regarding the overall treatment success, 33 (34%) patients had complete response, 16 (16%) patients had partial response (between 50-99%), 27 (28%) patients had minimal response (between 1-49%), and 22 (22%) patients were non-responders. Both genders were equally represented in the outcome. Conclusions There was a significant relation between the severity of alopecia and treatment outcome. (p=0.038) Patients with alopecia areata had significantly better response when compared to alopecia totalis and universalis. There was no statistically significant relation with other parameters such as disease duration, age, gender, atopy history, age of onset, and histopathological features.</p></html>
