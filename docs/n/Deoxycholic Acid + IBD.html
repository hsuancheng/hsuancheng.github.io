However, the exact mechanism by which bile  therapy confers protection from colitogenesis is currently unknown. Since the gut microbiota plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of , and exogenous bile  administration may affect the community structure of the microbiota, we examined the impact of the secondary bile  ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) and its taurine or glycine conjugates on the fecal microbial community structure during experimental colitis. Daily oral administration of UDCA, tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), or glycoursodeoxycholic  (GUDCA) equally lowered the severity of dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis in mice, as evidenced by reduced body weight loss, colonic shortening, and expression of inflammatory cytokines. Illumina sequencing demonstrated that bile  therapy during colitis did not restore fecal bacterial richness and diversity. However, bile  therapy normalized the colitis-associated increased ratio of  to  Interestingly, administration of bile acids prevented the loss of  cluster XIVa and increased the abundance of , bacterial species known to be particularly decreased in  patients. We conclude that UDCA, which is an FDA-approved drug for cholestatic liver disorders, could be an attractive treatment option to reduce dysbiosis and ameliorate inflammation in human . Secondary bile acids are emerging as attractive candidates for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Although bile acids may affect the intestinal microbial community structure, which significantly contributes to the course of these inflammatory disorders, the impact of bile  therapy on the fecal microbiota during colitis has not yet been considered. Here, we studied the alterations in the fecal microbial abundance in colitic mice following the administration of secondary bile acids. Our results show that secondary bile acids reduce the severity of colitis and ameliorate colitis-associated fecal dysbiosis at the phylum level. This study indicates that secondary bile acids might act as a safe and effective drug for inflammatory bowel disease.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.</p><p>Keyword: IBD</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29889418>METABOLIC DYSBIOSIS OF THE GUT MICROBIOTA AND ITS BIOMARKERS.</a></h2><p>Existing methods of clustering of gut microbiota (enterotypes, clusters, gradients), as well as the term 'phylogenetic core' do not reflect its functional activity. The authors propose to describe the key microbiora using term 'phylometabolic core of intestinal microbioca which more accurately reflects the functional importance of metabolically active microbiota. Phylometabolic core includes functional groups of microorganisms that perform similar metabolic functions: butyrate-producing bacteria, propionate-producing bacteria, acetate-produc- ing bacteria (acerogens), hydrogenosrophic microorganisms (reductive acetogens, sulfate-reducing bacteria, methanogens), lactate-producing and lactate-utilizing bacteria, bacteria involved in bile acids metabolism, bacteria that metabolize proteins and amino acids, vitamin-producing microorganisms, oxalate-degrading bacteria and others. The hypothesis that disturbance of microbial metabolism is the root of many human diseases is discussed. The microbial dysmexabo- lism leads to the metabolic dysbiosis (a particular form of dysbiosis) that is primarily characterized by metabolic abnormalities (e.g. serum, urinary, fetal or exhaled air). Metabolic dysbiosis is not necessarily accompanied by appreciable quantitative and/or qualitative changes in microbiora composition that called taxonomic dysbiosis. Since in the metabolic dysbiosis metabolic pathways can be switched only, it means the need for completely different approaches to its assessment using metabolomics (metabolic fingerprinting, metabolic profiling, meta-metabolomics). Metabolites concentrations in colon (feces, biopsy samples), blood (serum, plasma), urine or exhaled air, as well as metabolic profiles of examined substrates can serve as biomarkers. The main clinical variants of metabolic dysbiosis are due to the disturbances in microbial synthesis of short-chain fatty acids (primarily butyrate and propionate) and due to increasing bacterial production of hydrogen sulfide, ammonia and secondary bile acids (particularly ). These kinds of metabolic dysbiosis can eventually lead to inflammatory bowel disease () or colorectal cancer (CRC). The metabolic dysbiosis due to bacterial choline dysmetabolism followed by overproduction of trimethylamine (TMA), arherogenic precursor of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), is associated with atherogenesis and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Dysmetabolism of aromatic amino acids leads to changes in the microbial production of phenylalanine and tyrosine derivatives (phenyl carboxylic , p-cresol) and tryptophan indole derivatives (indole carboxylic , indole) and contributes to pathogenesis in lBS. , CRC, chronic liver and kidney diseases, cardiovascular diseases, autism and schizophrenia. Metabiotics, a new class of therapeutic agents, e.g. based on microbial metabolites, can correct metabolic dysbiosis, prevent diet- and microbiota-relared diseases and increase the effectiveness of treatment.</p><p>Keyword: IBD</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25827146>[A child with primary sclerosing cholangitis].</a></h2><p>Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a rare liver disease which is mainly diagnosed in adults. This chronic progressive disease, characterised by inflammation, fibrosis and strictures of the intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts, leads to cirrhosis. There is a strong association between primary sclerosing cholangitis and inflammatory bowel disease ().A 10-year-old boy presented at the accident and emergency department with fever, episodes of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fatigue and hepatomegaly. Blood tests, pathology investigations, liver biopsy and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) led to the diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis. The patient was treated with ursodeoxycholic  and later, because of unbearable itching, sequentially with lidocaine 3% ointment, rifampicin, an endoprosthesis in the common bile duct and glucocorticoids. One year later he returned to the paediatrician with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhoea. Endoscopy revealed features of indeterminate colitis.

Given that liver transplantation (LT) is the only treatment that offers a survival benefit in PSC patients with hepatic dysfunction, management decisions in  patients' post-LT for PSC are frequently encountered. One such consideration is the risk of CRC in this immunosuppressed cohort. With most studies showing an increased risk of CRC post-LT in these  patients, a closer look at the associated risk factors of CRC and the adopted surveillance strategies in this subset of patients is warranted. Low-dose ursodeoxycholic  has shown a potential chemopreventive effect in PSC- patients pre-LT; however, a favorable effect remains to be seen in post-LT group. Also, further studies are necessary to assess the benefit of 5 aminosalicylate therapy. Annual surveillance colonoscopy in the post-LT period is recommended for PSC- patients subset given their high risk for CRC.© 2018 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America.

Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), a naturally occurring bile  with anti-inflammatory actions, has been proposed as a potential new therapy for . However, its effects on monocyte function are not yet known. Primary monocytes from healthy volunteers or cultured U937 monocytes were treated with either the proinflammatory cytokine, TNFα (5 ng/ml) or the bacterial endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1 μg/ml) for 24 h, in the absence or presence of UDCA (25-100 μM). IL-8 release into the supernatant was measured by ELISA. mRNA levels were quantified by qPCR and changes in cell signaling proteins were determined by Western blotting. Toxicity was assessed by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. UDCA treatment significantly attenuated TNFα-, but not LPS-driven, release of IL-8 from both primary and cultured monocytes. UDCA inhibition of TNFα-driven responses was associated with reduced IL-8 mRNA expression. Both TNFα and LPS stimulated NFκB activation in monocytes, while IL-8 release in response to both cytokines was attenuated by an NFκB inhibitor, BMS-345541. Interestingly, UDCA inhibited TNFα-, but not LPS-stimulated, NFκB activation. Finally, TNFα, but not LPS, induced phosphorylation of TNF receptor associated factor (TRAF2), while UDCA cotreatment attenuated this response. We conclude that UDCA specifically inhibits TNFα-induced IL-8 release from monocytes by inhibiting TRAF2 activation.

Moreover, the effect of DCA on inflammasome activation is mainly mediated through bile  receptor sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2); however, the intermediate process remains unclear. Here, we sought to explore the detailed molecular mechanism involved and examine the effect of S1PR2 blockage in a colitis mouse model. In this study, we found that DCA could dose dependently upregulate S1PR2 expression. Meanwhile, DCA-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation is at least partially achieved through stimulating extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) signaling pathway downstream of S1PR2 followed by promoting of lysosomal cathepsin B release. DCA enema significantly aggravated DSS-induced colitis in mice and S1PR2 inhibitor as well as inflammasome inhibition by cathepsin B antagonist substantially reducing the mature IL-1 production and alleviated colonic inflammation superimposed by DCA. Therefore, our findings suggest that S1PR2/ERK1/2/cathepsin B signaling plays a critical role in triggering inflammasome activation by DCA and S1PR2 may represent a new potential therapeutic target for the management of intestinal inflammation in individuals on a high-fat diet.</p><p>Keyword: IBD</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26579439>Bile  nuclear receptor FXR and digestive system diseases.</a></h2><p>Bile acids (BAs) are not only digestive surfactants but also important cell signaling molecules, which stimulate several signaling pathways to regulate some important biological processes. The bile--activated nuclear receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), plays a pivotal role in regulating bile , lipid and glucose homeostasis as well as in regulating the inflammatory responses, barrier function and prevention of bacterial translocation in the intestinal tract. As expected, FXR is involved in the pathophysiology of a wide range of diseases of gastrointestinal tract, including inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer and type 2 diabetes. In this review, we discuss current knowledge of the roles of FXR in physiology of the digestive system and the related diseases.

Changes in mucosal 5-HT (serotonin) signalling occur in animal models of colitis and in humans suffering from . Melatonin is co-released with 5-HT from the mucosa and has a wide variety of actions in the GI tract. Here, we examined how melatonin signalling is affected by colitis and determined how this relates to 5-HT signalling.Using electroanalytical approaches, we investigated how 5-HT release, reuptake and availability as well as melatonin availability are altered in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. Studies were conducted to explore if melatonin treatment during active colitis could reduce the severity of colitis.We observed an increase in 5-HT and a decrease in melatonin availability in DSS-induced colitis. A significant reduction in 5-HT reuptake was observed in DSS-induced colitis animals. A reduction in the content of 5-HT was observed, but no difference in tryptophan levels were observed. A reduction in -stimulated 5-HT availability and a significant reduction in mechanically-stimulated 5-HT and melatonin availability were observed in DSS-induced colitis. Orally or rectally administered melatonin once colitis was established did not significantly suppress inflammation.Our data suggest that DSS-induced colitis results in a reduction in melatonin availability and an increase in 5-HT availability, due to a reduction/loss of tryptophan hydroxylase 1 enzyme, 5-HT content and 5-HT transporters. Mechanosensory release was more susceptible to inflammation when compared with chemosensory release.© 2018 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><p>Keyword: IBD</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29351391>The bile acids,  and ursodeoxycholic , regulate colonic epithelial wound healing.</a></h2><p>The intestinal epithelium constitutes an innate barrier which, upon injury, undergoes self-repair processes known as restitution. Although bile acids are known as important regulators of epithelial function in health and disease, their effects on wound healing processes are not yet clear. Here we set out to investigate the effects of the colonic bile acids,  (DCA) and ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), on epithelial restitution. Wound healing in T cell monolayers grown on transparent, permeable supports was assessed over 48 h with or without bile acids. Cell migration was measured in Boyden chambers. mRNA and protein expression were measured by RT-PCR and Western blotting. DCA (50-150 µM) significantly inhibited wound closure in cultured epithelial monolayers and attenuated cell migration in Boyden chamber assays. DCA also induced nuclear accumulation of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), whereas an FXR agonist, GW4064 (10 µM), inhibited wound closure. Both DCA and GW4064 attenuated the expression of CFTR Cl channels, whereas inhibition of CFTR activity with either CFTR--172 (10 µM) or GlyH-101 (25 µM) also prevented wound healing. Promoter/reporter assays revealed that FXR-induced downregulation of CFTR is mediated at the transcriptional level. In contrast, UDCA (50-150 µM) enhanced wound healing in vitro and prevented the effects of DCA. Finally, DCA inhibited and UDCA promoted mucosal healing in an in vivo mouse model. In conclusion, these studies suggest bile acids are important regulators of epithelial wound healing and are therefore good targets for development of new drugs to modulate intestinal barrier function in disease treatment. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The secondary bile , , inhibits colonic epithelial wound healing, an effect which appears to be mediated by activation of the nuclear bile  receptor, FXR, with subsequent downregulation of CFTR expression and activity.

First published March 30, 2017; doi:10.1152/ajpgi.00256.2016.-Inflammatory bowel diseases () comprise a group of common and debilitating chronic intestinal disorders for which currently available therapies are often unsatisfactory. The naturally occurring secondary bile , ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), has well-established anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective actions and may therefore be effective in treating . We aimed to investigate regulation of colonic inflammatory responses by UDCA and to determine the potential impact of bacterial metabolism on its therapeutic actions. The anti-inflammatory efficacy of UDCA, a nonmetabolizable analog, 6α-methyl-UDCA (6-MUDCA), and its primary colonic metabolite lithocholic  (LCA) was assessed in the murine dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model of mucosal injury. The effects of bile acids on cytokine (TNF-α, IL-6, Il-1β, and IFN-γ) release from cultured colonic epithelial cells and mouse colonic tissue in vivo were investigated. Luminal bile acids were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. UDCA attenuated release of proinflammatory cytokines from colonic epithelial cells in vitro and was protective against the development of colonic inflammation in vivo. In contrast, although 6-MUDCA mimicked the effects of UDCA on epithelial cytokine release in vitro, it was ineffective in preventing inflammation in the DSS model. In UDCA-treated mice, LCA became the most common colonic bile . Finally, LCA treatment more potently inhibited epithelial cytokine release and protected against DSS-induced mucosal inflammation than did UDCA. These studies identify a new role for the primary metabolite of UDCA, LCA, in preventing colonic inflammation and suggest that microbial metabolism of UDCA is necessary for the full expression of its protective actions. On the basis of its cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory actions, the secondary bile  ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) has well-established uses in both traditional and Western medicine. We identify a new role for the primary metabolite of UDCA, lithocholic , as a potent inhibitor of intestinal inflammatory responses, and we present data to suggest that microbial metabolism of UDCA is necessary for the full expression of its protective effects against colonic inflammation.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: IBD</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666146>A pilot study of fecal bile  and microbiota profiles in inflammatory bowel disease and primary sclerosing cholangitis.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease () is thought to arise from an abnormal immune response to the gut microbiota.  is associated with altered intestinal microbial community structure and functionality, which may contribute to inflammation and complications such as colon cancer and liver disease.

An independent validation cohort of 14 PSC and 14 matched controls was recruited. 16S rDNA sequencing of faecal DNA was performed (Illumina MiSeq).The microbiota of patients with PSC was characterised by decreased microbiota diversity, and a significant overrepresentation of Enterococcus (p=3.76e-05), Fusobacterium (p=3.76e-05) and Lactobacillus (p=0.0002) genera.
