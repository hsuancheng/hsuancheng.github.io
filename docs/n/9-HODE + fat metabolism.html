Adequate glutathione peroxidase activity could be important for the maintenance of prostacyclin synthesis by blood vessels, since hydroperoxides can inhibit the formation of this substance. We have investigated the effects of dietary selenium deficiency on glutathione peroxidase activity and the synthesis of 6-oxoprostaglandin F1 alpha and monohydroxy and trihydroxy metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids by aorta. The latter products can be formed either by the actions of cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase or by  peroxidation. Aortic glutathione peroxidase activity was reduced by over 80% by feeding rats a selenium-deficient diet for 4 weeks, and to undetectable levels after 6 weeks. There were no appreciable differences in the levels of free and esterified oxygenated metabolites of linoleic acid or arachidonic acid between the control and treated groups after 4 weeks. However, after 6 weeks, there were modest, but statistically significant reductions in the formation of 6-oxoprostaglandin F1 alpha and monohydroxy products formed by cyclooxygenase. On the other hand, the amounts of esterified 18:2 metabolites appeared to be higher in aortae from animals on the selenium-deficient diet, although only the increase in esterified  was statistically significant. These results suggest that selenium deficiency can affect the formation of prostacyclin and other oxygenated metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids by aorta, possibly by increasing  peroxidation. However, the differences between control and selenium-deficient rats after 6 weeks were not very dramatic, in spite of the fact that glutathione peroxidase activity was undetectable. It would therefore appear that additional mechanisms are also involved in controlling the levels of  hydroperoxides in aorta.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1606159>Toxoplasma gondii stimulates the release of 13- and 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids by human platelets.</a></h2><p>We have recently demonstrated a novel cytotoxic effect of human platelets against Toxoplasma gondii and a role for thromboxane (TX) in this process (Yong et al., 1991). We now report on the spectrum of  mediators released by human platelets after interaction with T. gondii. In addition to TXB2, human platelets after incubation with T. gondii for 90 min released 12-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid (12-HHT), 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), and an unidentified peak (UVmax 234 nm) as determined by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Thermospray-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis and straight-phase HPLC identified the unknown peak as a mixture of 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE) and . Radiolabeling studies with [14C]linoleic acid indicated that the platelets were the cellular source of the octadecanoids with 13-HODE (87.7%) greater than  (12.3%). Inhibitor studies with indomethacin indicated that 13-HODE was a lipoxygenase product and  was a cyclooxygenase product of linoleic acid. Thus, Toxoplasma-stimulated platelets release oxygenated products of both arachidonic acid and linoleic acid which may be important in the host response to T. gondii infection.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12654483>Activation of NAD(P)H oxidase by  hydroperoxides: mechanism of oxidant-mediated smooth muscle cytotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Oxidized lipids, such as 13-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HPODE), have been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. 13-HPODE, a constituent of oxidized low-density lipoproteins, can induce cytotoxicity of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC), which may facilitate plaque destabilization and/or rupture. 13-HPODE-induced cytotoxicity has been linked to oxidative stress, although the mechanisms by which this occurs are unknown. In the present study, we show that 13-HPODE and 9-HPODE (10-30 microM) increased superoxide (O2*-) production and induced cytotoxicity in SMC. The 13-HPODE-induced increase in O2*- was blocked by transfecting the cells with antisense oligonucleotides against p22phox, suggesting that the O2*- was produced by NAD(P)H oxidase. Similar concentrations of the corresponding HPODE reduction products, 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE) and , neither increased O2*- production nor induced cytotoxicity, while 4-hydroxy nonenal (4-HNE), an unsaturated aldehyde  peroxidation product, induced cytotoxicity without increasing O2*- production. Treatment with superoxide dismutase or Tiron to scavenge O2*-, or transfection with p22phox antisense oligonucleotides to inhibit O2*- production, attenuated 13-HPODE-induced cytotoxicity, but not that induced by 4-HNE. These findings suggest that activation of NAD(P)H oxidase, and production of O2*-, play an important role in  hydroperoxide-induced smooth muscle cytotoxicity.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9511901>Retinoic acid-dependent stimulation of 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane)-initiated autoxidation of linoleic acid in sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles: a novel prooxidant effect of retinoic acid.</a></h2><p>(E)-Retinoic acid (RA) was shown to stimulate the rate of 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) (AAPH)-initiated autoxidation of linoleic acid (18:2) in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles. RA-dependent stimulation of 18:2 autoxidation was characterized by enhanced rates of dioxygen uptake which were linear with retinoid concentration. In contrast, 5,6-epoxy-RA, a major oxidation product of RA, failed to affect the rate of dioxygen consumption at all concentrations tested. RA was also shown to stimulate peroxyl radical-dependent oxidation of styrene to the corresponding oxirane when styrene was included in the micellar system as a molecular probe. Furthermore, unequivocal evidence of RA-dependent stimulation of 18:2 autoxidation was obtained by relative quantitation of 13-hydroxy-(9Z, 11E)-octadecadienoic acid (13-HODE) plus 9-hydroxy-(10E,12Z)-octadecadienoic acid () production. In addition, enhanced carbon-centered radical formation was demonstrated in the presence of RA by EPR spectroscopy using alpha-(4-pyridyl 1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone (4-POBN) as a spin trap. Analysis and quantitation of RA oxidation products indicated that RA was oxidized to one primary product, 5,6-epoxy-RA, which was identified on the basis of cochromatography with synthetic standard (in a reverse-phase HPLC system), electronic absorption spectroscopy, and positive chemical ionization mass spectrometry of the corresponding methyl ester. Other minor oxidation products were also detected but not characterized. In contrast, reaction mixtures devoid of 18:2 failed to demonstrate significant retinoid oxidation. Mechanisms are proposed to account for the prooxidant effects of RA in this system.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18842110>Rapid sample preparation and simultaneous quantitation of prostaglandins and lipoxygenase derived fatty acid metabolites by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry from small sample volumes.</a></h2><p>Fatty acid metabolites play a key role in numerous physiological and pathological processes. A rapid liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry assay for the simultaneous determination of prostanoids, isoprostane and lipoxygenase (LOX) derived fatty acid metabolites in a small biological sample of only 20 microL was developed.Human plasma samples were applied to a filter spot, extracted without prior derivatization and analyzed within 13 min. Detection of metabolites was performed on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer in negative multiple-reaction monitoring detection mode. Application of this assay to various biological matrices was performed.The validated assay was linear over the concentration range of 5-500 nmol/L for prostanoids and isoprostane, 50-5000 nmol/L for LOX-derived metabolites and 400-40,000 nmol/L for fatty acids. Limits of quantitation were 0.4-233 nmol/L, depending on the metabolite. Plasma samples from diabetic patients and controls showed significant increases in (+/-) and 15(S)-HETE with p-values of 0.019 and 0.024, respectively.The small amount of 20 microL sample volume used in this assay and the demonstrated application to various sample types makes it an ideal routine analysis method for fatty acid metabolites. The resulting values for LOX-derived metabolites in diabetes mellitus type 2 samples support earlier findings about the role of lipid oxidation products in diabetes.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22959954>Lowering dietary linoleic acid reduces bioactive oxidized linoleic acid metabolites in humans.</a></h2><p>Linoleic acid (LA) is the most abundant polyunsaturated fatty acid in human diets, a major component of human tissues, and the direct precursor to the bioactive oxidized LA metabolites (OXLAMs), 9- and 13 hydroxy-octadecadienoic acid (9- and 13-HODE) and 9- and 13-oxo-octadecadienoic acid (9- and 13-oxoODE). These four OXLAMs have been mechanistically linked to pathological conditions ranging from cardiovascular disease to chronic pain. Plasma OXLAMs, which are elevated in Alzheimer's dementia and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, have been proposed as biomarkers useful for indicating the presence and severity of both conditions. Because mammals lack the enzymatic machinery needed for de novo LA synthesis, the abundance of LA and OXLAMs in mammalian tissues may be modifiable via diet. To examine this issue in humans, we measured circulating LA and OXLAMs before and after a 12-week LA lowering dietary intervention in chronic headache patients. Lowering dietary LA significantly reduced the abundance of plasma OXLAMs, and reduced the LA content of multiple circulating  fractions that may serve as precursor pools for endogenous OXLAM synthesis. These results show that lowering dietary LA can reduce the synthesis and/or accumulation of oxidized LA derivatives that have been implicated in a variety of pathological conditions. Future studies evaluating the clinical implications of diet-induced OXLAM reductions are warranted.Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19172745>Structural basis for the activation of PPARgamma by oxidized fatty acids.</a></h2><p>The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) has important roles in  and immune response as well as roles in both lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Although synthetic agonists for PPARgamma are widely used as insulin sensitizers, the identity of the natural ligand(s) for PPARgamma is still not clear. Suggested natural ligands include 15-deoxy-delta12,14-prostaglandin J2 and oxidized fatty acids such as  and 13-HODE. Crystal structures of PPARgamma have revealed the mode of recognition for synthetic compounds. Here we report structures of PPARgamma bound to oxidized fatty acids that are likely to be natural ligands for this receptor. These structures reveal that the receptor can (i) simultaneously bind two fatty acids and (ii) couple covalently with conjugated oxo fatty acids. Thermal stability and gene expression analyses suggest that such covalent ligands are particularly effective activators of PPARgamma and thus may serve as potent and biologically relevant ligands.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23537656>HDL inhibits endoplasmic reticulum stress by stimulating apoE and CETP secretion from -loaded macrophages.</a></h2><p>The role of HDL in the modulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in macrophage-derived foam cells is not completely understood. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether HDL may inhibit ER stress in correlation with the secretion of apoE and CETP from -loaded macrophages. To this purpose, THP-1 macrophages were loaded with lipids by incubation with human oxidized LDL (oxLDL) and then exposed to human HDL3. ER stress signaling markers, protein kinase/Jun-amino-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK p54/p46) and eukaryotic initiation factor-2α (eIF2α), as well as the secreted apoE and CETP, were evaluated by immunoblot analysis. Out of the many different bioactive lipids of oxLDL, we tested the effect of 9-hydroxy-octadecadienoic acid () and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) on ER stress. Tunicamycin was used as positive control for ER stress induction. Results showed that oxLDL,  and 4-HNE induce ER stress in human macrophages by activation of eIF-2α and SAPK/JNK (p54/p46) signaling pathways. OxLDL stimulated apoE and CETP secretion, while tunicamycin determined a reduction of the secreted apoE and CETP, both in control and -loaded macrophages. The addition of HDL3 to the culture medium of tunicamycin-treated cells induced: (i) the reduction of ER stress, expressed as decreased levels of eIF-2α and SAPK/JNK, and (ii) a partial recovery of the secreted apoE and CETP levels in -loaded macrophages. These data suggest a new mechanism by which HDL3 diminish ER stress and stimulate cholesterol efflux from -loaded macrophages.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

However, there is no approved pharmacological treatment for CIPN available. Among other substances, oxaliplatin causes CIPN in up to 80% of treated patients. Here, we report the involvement of the G-protein coupled receptor G2A (GPR132) in oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic pain in mice. We found that mice deficient in the G2A-receptor show decreased mechanical hypersensitivity after oxaliplatin treatment.  ligands of G2A were found in increased concentrations in the sciatic nerve and dorsal root ganglia of oxaliplatin treated mice. Calcium imaging and patch-clamp experiments show that G2A activation sensitizes the ligand-gated ion channel TRPV1 in sensory neurons via activation of PKC. Based on these findings, we conclude that targeting G2A may be a promising approach to reduce oxaliplatin-induced TRPV1-sensitization and the hyperexcitability of sensory neurons and thereby to reduce pain in patients treated with this chemotherapeutic agent.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10558912>Regulation of ferritin light chain gene expression by oxidized low-density lipoproteins in human monocytic THP-1 cells.</a></h2><p>Genes induced or suppressed by oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL) in human monocytic THP-1 cells were searched using differential display reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions (DDRT-PCR). Among the many differentially expressed cDNA fragments, one was dramatically stimulated by the oxLDL in a steady state level, which was later found to contain sequences corresponding to ferritin light chain (L-ferritin) in a sequence homology search. The stimulatory effect of the oxLDL on the level of L-ferritin mRNA in the THP-1 cells was both time- and dose-dependent. When the cells were allowed to differentiate in the presence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), the differentiated cells were generally less responsive to the oxLDL than the undifferentiated ones. An increase of L-ferritin mRNA was observed when the cells were treated with the  components in the oxLDL such as , 13-HODE, and 25-hydroxycholesterol. In addition, a stimulation of the L-ferritin gene expression was also observed when the cells were treated with an endogenous peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) ligand, 15d-PGJ2, in a time- and dose-dependent manner.

The oxidized lipids were also analyzed under conditions allowing preservation of their oxidation state. Using reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of native and saponified  extracts of oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL), we found that the major fatty acid oxidation product was esterified hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid (HPODE), the oxidized product of the most abundant polyunsaturated fatty acid in human LDL, linoleic acid. Although some esterified hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE) was also detected, the reduction of HPODE to HODE did not appear to be monocyte-dependent. Essentially all of the HPODE was found to be esterified with the majority being esterified to cholesterol followed by phospholipids and generally following the abundance of esterified linoleic acid within the  classes. The percent of cholesteryl linoleate converted to cholesteryl HPODE and cholesteryl HODE at the end of the 24-h incubation was determined to be approximately 13.5%. The formation of oxidized esterified linoleic acid in the LDL was shown to require immunological activation of the human monocytes, a previously observed requirement for general LDL oxidation in this culture system. The oxidized esterified linoleic acid was present in the supernatant with the LDL and was not cell-associated. HPODE formation on LDL was prevented by including superoxide dismutase (SOD) or eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA) during the 24-h coincubation of activated monocytes with LDL whereas indomethacin was without effect. The analysis of the  oxidation products in oxidized LDL can provide insight into the mechanisms involved in oxidation of LDL by activated human monocytes.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23483888>Metabolic signatures of extreme longevity in northern Italian centenarians reveal a complex remodeling of lipids, amino acids, and gut microbiota .</a></h2><p>The aging phenotype in humans has been thoroughly studied but a detailed metabolic profiling capable of shading light on the underpinning biological processes of longevity is still missing. Here using a combined metabonomics approach compromising holistic (1)H-NMR profiling and targeted MS approaches, we report for the first time the metabolic phenotype of longevity in a well characterized human aging cohort compromising mostly female centenarians, elderly, and young individuals. With increasing age, targeted MS profiling of blood serum displayed a marked decrease in tryptophan concentration, while an unique alteration of specific glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids are seen in the longevity phenotype. We hypothesized that the overall lipidome changes specific to longevity putatively reflect centenarians' unique capacity to adapt/respond to the accumulating oxidative and chronic inflammatory conditions characteristic of their extreme aging phenotype. Our data in centenarians support promotion of cellular detoxification mechanisms through specific modulation of the arachidonic acid metabolic cascade as we underpinned increased concentration of 8,9-EpETrE, suggesting enhanced cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme activity. Such effective mechanism might result in the activation of an anti-oxidative response, as displayed by decreased circulating levels of  and 9-oxoODE, markers of  peroxidation and oxidative products of linoleic acid. Lastly, we also revealed that the longevity process deeply affects the structure and composition of the human gut microbiota as shown by the increased extrection of phenylacetylglutamine (PAG) and p-cresol sulfate (PCS) in urine of centenarians. Together, our novel approach in this representative Italian longevity cohort support the hypothesis that a complex remodeling of , amino acid , and of gut microbiota functionality are key regulatory processes marking exceptional longevity in humans.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19265508>Hydrogen sulfide destroys  hydroperoxides in oxidized LDL.</a></h2><p>LOOHs ( hydroperoxides) in oxLDL [oxidized LDL (low-density lipoprotein)] are potentially atherogenic compounds. Recently, H2S was identified as the third endogenous gasotransmitter in the vasculature. H2O2 is known to be destroyed by H2S. Assuming that H2S may also react with LOOHs, the results show that H2S can destroy LOOHs in oxLDL. The ability of LOOH-enriched LDL to induce HO-1 (haem oxygenase 1) in endothelial cells was abolished by H2S pretreatment. HPLC analysis showed that 9-HPODE [(9S)-hydroperoxy-(10E,12Z)-octadecadienoic acid], a compound found in oxLDL, was reduced to  [(9S)-hydroxy-(10E,12Z)-octadecadienoic acid] in the presence of H2S. Thus H2S may act as an antiatherogenic agent by reducing LOOHs to the less reactive LOHs and could abrogate the pathobiological activity of oxLDL.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12417276>The adipocyte  binding protein (ALBP/aP2) gene facilitates foam cell formation in human THP-1 macrophages.</a></h2><p>The critical initiating event in atherogenesis involves the invasion of monocytes through the endothelial wall of arteries, and their transformation from macrophages into foam cells. Human THP-1 monocytic cells can be induced to differentiate into macrophages by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) treatment, and can then be converted into foam cells by exposure to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL). To define genes that are specifically expressed during the transformation of macrophages into foam cells, we have performed a subtractive library screening utilizing mRNA isolated from THP-1 macrophages and foam cells. From this analysis, we have identified adipocyte  binding protein (ALBP/aP2) as a gene that is highly upregulated in foam cells in response to oxLDL. Furthermore, overexpression the ALBP gene using an adenovirus construct enhanced the accumulation of cholesterol ester in macrophage foam cells, probably due to an increase in transcription since oxLDL enhanced ALBP promoter activity in experiments using a promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct. The induction of ALBP by oxLDL probably involved activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) transcription factors, since four different endogenous PPARgamma ligands, including 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid () and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE), two oxidized  components of oxLDL, as well as 15-deoxy-delta12,14 prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) and retinoic acid (RA), all induced ALBP expression in macrophage/foam cells. Finally, ALBP was found to be highly expressed in vivo in macrophage/foam cells of human atherosclerotic plaques. These observations suggest that oxLDL-mediated increase in ALBP gene expression accelerate cholesterol ester accumulation, and that this is an important component of the genetic program regulating conversion of macrophages to foam cells. The observation that ALBP is readily detected in foam cells in active atherosclerotic lesions implicates a role for ALBP in human vascular disease. The induction of ALPB expression by oxLDL likely involves activation of PPARgamma by components of oxLDL ( and 13-HODE) that also function as PPARgamma ligands. Our results add to the concern that the clinical use of insulin-sensitizing PPARgamma agonists (i.e. thiazolidinediones) to treat Type 2 Diabetes could exacerbate atherosclerosis, and highlight the need for clinical trials that address this issue.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202307>Changes of hydroxyl-linoleic acids during Chinese-style sausage processing and their relationships with lipids oxidation.</a></h2><p>A Chinese-style sausage was processed using pork as the raw material.

Sub/low micromolar concentrations of 12- and 15-HETE were toxic to monocytes, whereas HODE isomers were ineffective. Low micromolar concentrations of HETE isomers were estimated to be similarly present in monocytes after phagocytosis of trophozoites or hemozoin.

The close physical relationship between adipocyte progenitors and tissue macrophages suggested that the macrophages that clear dying adipocytes might generate proadipogenic factors.

Lipidomic analysis of fluorescence-activated cell sorting-isolated macrophages demonstrated that CD44+ macrophages contained four- to five-fold higher levels of the endogenous peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) ligands 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE), and 13-HODE compared with CD44- macrophages. Gene expression profiling and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that ADRB3 agonist treatment upregulated expression of ALOX15, the lipoxygenase responsible for generating  and 13-HODE.

The cytosolic enzymes were separated by anion-exchange chromatography into two fractions E1 and E2, having molecular masses of 66 and 54 kDa, respectively. The enzyme fraction E1 only produced 9-keto-10,12-octadecadienoic acid, whereas E2 formed other products. The enzyme E1 showed higher reactivity with 13- and 9-hydroperoxide of alpha-linolenic acid than 9-HPODE, but no reaction with hydroxy fatty acids.

Combining mass spectrometry-based ionomics and targeted lipidomics on fatty acid metabolites, we identified significant alterations in redox status and fatty acid  in saliva in response to chronic inflammation and oxidative stress in periodontal disease in a cohort of nonsmoker subjects with chronic periodontitis. For the first time, ionomic profiling of around 30 ions in saliva revealed significantly decreased levels of redox-active metal ions including Mn, Cu, and Zn in the periodontal group, which is consistent with decreased levels of superoxide dismutases in saliva and serum. A targeted lipidomic approach was employed to monitor the major metabolites of arachidonic acid and linoleic acid in saliva. We observed increased levels of cyclooxygenase products including PGE2, PGD2, and PGF2α and TXB2, but decreased level of PGI2 in the periodontal group. A unique pattern of the lipoxygenase products of arachidonic acid and linoleic acid was observed with increased level of 5-HETE but decreased levels of 13-HODE and . Levels of salivary F2-isoprostanes, free radical lipid peroxidation products, and a gold standard for oxidative stress in vivo were also significantly elevated. Taking these data together, our study using multiple powerful omics techniques demonstrates that local redox alteration contributes significantly to periodontitis through the modulation of fatty acid  in response to inflammation and oxidative stress. This study highlights the importance of redox status in periodontitis and provides a rationale for preventing periodontal disease by dietary interventions aiming to restore redox balance.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The HODE content in destructed bones exceeded that of non destructed ones of the same patient for a factor of about 3.

In recent studies, we have shown that lipoproteins can modulate CCR2 expression and have identified native LDL as a positive regulator. In contrast, oxidized LDL (OxLDL), which is mainly formed in the aortic intima, reduces CCR2 expression, promotes monocyte retention, and may cause pathological accumulation of monocytes in the vessel wall. We now provide evidence that OxLDL reduces monocyte CCR2 expression by activating intracellular signaling pathways that may involve peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). Receptor-mediated uptake of the lipoprotein particle was required and allows for delivery of the exogenous ligand to the nuclear receptor. The suppression of CCR2 expression by OxLDL was mediated by  components of OxLDL, such as the oxidized linoleic acid metabolites  and 13-HODE, known activators of PPARgamma. Modified apoB had no such effect. Consistent with a participation of the PPARgamma signaling pathway, BRL49653 reduced CCR2 expression in freshly isolated human monocytes ex vivo and in circulating mouse monocytes in vivo. These results implicate PPARgamma in the inhibition of CCR2 gene expression by oxidized lipids, which may help retain monocytes at sites of inflammation, such as the atherosclerotic lesion.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23561936>Mouse mammary gland is refractory to the effects of ethanol after natural lactation.</a></h2><p>Ethanol is a dietary factor that dose-dependently increases breast cancer risk in women. We previously have shown that ethanol increases mammary epithelial density through increased branching after dietary exposure during puberty in CD2/F1 mice. To extend these studies to parous mice in a breast cancer model, we used a transgenic mouse model of human parity-associated breast cancer, the FVB-MMTV-Her2/Neu mouse, which overexpresses wildtype EGFR2, resulting in constitutive activation of growth signaling in the mammary epithelium. Here we describe the short-term effects of ethanol feeding on progression through involution. Mice were fed diets supplemented with 0%, 0.5%, 1%, or 2% ethanol for 4, 9, or 14 d starting on day 21 of lactation (that is, at the start of natural postlactational involution). Unlike peripubertal mice exposed to ethanol, postlactational dams showed no changes in body weight; liver, spleen, and kidney weights; and pathology. Ethanol exposure had no effect on mammary gland lobular density and adipocyte size throughout involution. Likewise, the infiltration of inflammatory cells and serum oxidized  species were unchanged by diet, suggesting that ethanol feeding had no effect on local inflammation (leukocyte infiltration) or systemic inflammation (oxidized lipids). In conclusion, ethanol exposure of parous dams had no effect on mammary gland structure or the regression of the lactating mammary gland to a resting state. The period of involution that follows natural lactation appears to be refractory to developmental effects of ethanol on mammary epithelium.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8001259>Phospholipid peroxidation in tumor promoter-exposed mouse skin.</a></h2><p>We have investigated  peroxidation in the skin of CD1 mice following single or repeated topical applications of the tumor promoter, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). A substantial accumulation of hydroxyphospholipids, to levels 3-5 times control values, followed exposure to two or more TPA treatments (24-72 h intervals), whereas single applications were ineffective. Sodium borohydride reduction increased the yield of product by approximately 50%, suggesting the additional presence of phospholipid hydroperoxides in the oxidized lipids. Straight phase HPLC analysis of the constituent hydroxy fatty acids, followed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, revealed that oxidized derivatives of linoleic acid, including 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (9- and 13-HODE), were the primary products. Stereochemical analysis showed ratios of S to R stereoisomers of 1.3 for 13-HODE and 1.27 for , which implied that TPA-induced peroxidation was primarily due to free radical oxidation, although a partial contribution of enzyme (lipoxygenase) activity is possible. The TPA-induced peroxidation was greater in the epidermis than in the dermis. Pre-exposure of mouse skin to the anti-inflammatory agent fluocinolone acetonide, antioxidants and enzyme (phospholipase A2 and lipoxygenase) inhibitors lowered the peroxidation response to subsequent exposure to TPA. Phospholipid peroxidation products may be useful markers of oxygen radical production in TPA-exposed mouse skin with possible relevance to tumor promotion.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19063986>G2A as a receptor for oxidized free fatty acids.</a></h2><p>G2A was identified as a G protein-coupled receptor that can be induced by different classes of DNA-damaging agents and block cell cycle progression in lymphocytes. We recently reported that G2A functions as a receptor for oxidized free fatty acids derived from linoleic and arachidonic acids. When ectopically expressed in CHO cells, G2A mediates intracellular signaling events such as intracellular calcium mobilization and JNK activation in response to oxidized free fatty acids. In human epidermal keratinocytes, G2A mediates the secretion of cytokines including interleukin-6 and -8, and blocks cell cycle progression at the G1 phase in response to ligands. G2A might function as a sensor that monitors the oxidative states and mediates appropriate cellular responses such as secretion of paracrine signals and attenuation of proliferation.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1906087>Evidence for a dominant role of lipoxygenase(s) in the oxidation of LDL by mouse peritoneal macrophages.</a></h2><p>It has been suggested that the oxidative modification of low density lipoprotein (LDL) is a key event in atherogenesis. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how different types of cells modify LDL. In this study we examine the relative contributions of superoxide anions and cellular lipoxygenase (LO) in the modification of LDL by macrophages. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) inhibited LDL oxidation by macrophages but only by 25%. Under the same conditions, several LO inhibitors (eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA), piriprost, and A-64077) almost completely inhibited the modification of LDL by macrophages. SOD had a greater inhibitory effect on the modification of LDL by U937 cells and fibroblasts (32% and 64%, respectively) but again LO inhibitors had a much greater effect (79 to 100% inhibition). Incubation of [1-14C]linoleic acid with mouse peritoneal macrophages resulted in its conversion to a single more polar product coeluting with 13- and  by reverse phase HPLC. When the cells were preincubated with LO inhibitors, formation of this product was significantly inhibited. It is concluded that the modification of LDL by macrophages is mediated in large part by lipoxygenase-type activity.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11861298>Defects in leukocyte-mediated initiation of  peroxidation in plasma as studied in myeloperoxidase-deficient subjects: systematic identification of multiple endogenous diffusible substrates for myeloperoxidase in plasma.</a></h2><p>More than a decade ago it was demonstrated that neutrophil activation in plasma results in the time-dependent formation of  hydroperoxides through an unknown, ascorbate-sensitive pathway. It is now shown that the mechanism involves myeloperoxidase (MPO)-dependent use of multiple low-molecular-weight substrates in plasma, generating diffusible oxidant species. Addition of activated human neutrophils (from healthy subjects) to plasma (50%, vol/vol) resulted in the peroxidation of endogenous plasma lipids by catalase-, heme poison-, and ascorbate-sensitive pathways, as assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with on-line electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometric analysis of free and -bound 9-HETE and . In marked contrast, neutrophils isolated from multiple subjects with MPO deficiency failed to initiate peroxidation of plasma lipids, but they did so after supplementation with isolated human MPO. MPO-dependent use of a low-molecular-weight substrate(s) in plasma for initiating  peroxidation was illustrated by demonstrating that the filtrate of plasma (10-kd MWt cutoff) could supply components required for low-density lipoprotein  peroxidation in the presence of MPO and H(2)O(2). Subsequent HPLC fractionation of plasma filtrate (10-kd MWt cutoff) by sequential column chromatography identified nitrite, tyrosine, and thiocyanate as major endogenous substrates and 17 beta-estradiol as a novel minor endogenous substrate in plasma for MPO in promoting peroxidation of plasma lipids. These results strongly suggest that the MPO-H(2)O(2) system of human leukocytes serves as a physiological mechanism for initiating  peroxidation in vivo.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10988277>Troglitazone reduces reactive oxygen species generation by leukocytes and  peroxidation and improves flow-mediated vasodilatation in obese subjects.</a></h2><p>Because troglitazone has been shown to have antioxidant properties, we investigated whether troglitazone administration to obese subjects causes a reduction in (1) reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) and mononuclear cells (MNCs) and (2)  peroxidation as reflected in the plasma concentrations of 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid () and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE). Seven obese subjects were given 400 mg/d troglitazone for 4 weeks. Blood samples were obtained before troglitazone administration and at weekly intervals thereafter. Insulin concentrations fell significantly at week 1 and remained low at weeks 2 and 4 (P:<0.001). ROS generation by PMNLs fell to 77.6+/-25.1% of the basal at week 1 and 47.9+/-41.1% at week 4 (P:<0.001).

We conclude that troglitazone has a potent and rapid biological inhibitory effect on ROS generation by PMNLs and MNCs and that it inhibits  peroxidation significantly.

Through this pathway (9Z,11E,13S)-13-hydroperoxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid (13-HPOD) is reduced to corresponding 13-hydroxy acid (13-HOD), which is in turn dehydrogenated into ketodiene (9Z,11E,13S)-13-oxo-9,11-octadecadienoic acid (13-KOD). Dehydrogenation of 13-HOD into 13-KOD was not dependent on the presence of either NAD or NADP, but was strongly dependent on the presence of oxygen. Under anoxic conditions, 13-HOD dehydrogenation was blocked, but addition of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol restored it. Sulfite addition fully suppressed the aerobic dehydrogenation of 13-HOD. Hydrogen peroxide is a by-product formed by the enzyme along with 13-KOD. These data suggest that the ketodiene biosynthesis in H. tuberosus tubers is catalyzed by flavin dehydrogenase. (9S,10E,12Z)- (9-HOD) is dehydrogenated by this enzyme as effectively as 13-HOD, while alpha-ketol, (9Z)-12-oxo-13-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid, and ricinoleic acid did not act as substrates for dehydrogenase. The enzyme was soluble and possessed a pH optimum at pH 7.0-9.0. The only 13-HOD dehydrogenase known so far was detected in rat colon.

Metabolic complications in malaria are recognized contributors to severe and fatal malaria, but the impact of malaria infection on the production of small  derived signalling molecules is unknown. Knowledge of immunoregulatory patterns of these molecules in malaria is of great value for better understanding of the disease and improvement of treatment regimes, since the action of these classes of molecules is directly connected to the inflammatory response of the organism.Detection of oxylipins and endocannabinoids from plasma samples from forty children with uncomplicated and severe malaria as well as twenty controls was done after solid phase extraction followed by chromatography mass spectrometry analysis. The stable isotope dilution method was used for compound quantification. Data analysis was done with multivariate (principal component analysis (PCA), orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and univariate approaches (receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, t tests, correlation analysis).Forty different oxylipin and thirteen endocannabinoid metabolites were detected in the studied samples, with one oxylipin (thromboxane B2, TXB) in significantly lower levels and four endocannabinoids (OEA, PEA, DEA and EPEA) at significantly higher levels in infected individuals as compared to controls according to t test analysis with Bonferroni correction. Three oxylipins (13-HODE,  and 13-oxo-ODE) were higher in severe compared to uncomplicated malaria cases according to the results from multivariate analysis. Observed changes in oxylipin levels can be connected to activation of cytochrome P450 (CYP) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) metabolic pathways in malaria infected individuals compared to controls, and related to increased levels of all linoleic acid oxylipins in severe patients compared to uncomplicated ones. The endocannabinoids were extremely responsive to malaria infection with majority of this class of molecules found at higher levels in infected individuals compared to controls.It was possible to detect oxylipin and endocannabinoid molecules that can be potential biomarkers for differentiation between malaria infected individuals and controls and between different classes of malaria. Metabolic pathways that could be targeted towards an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of malaria were also pinpointed.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28446191>Longitudinal analysis of serum oxylipin profile as a novel descriptor of the inflammatory response to surgery.</a></h2><p>Oxylipins are potent  mediators demonstrated to initiate and regulate inflammation yet little is known regarding their involvement in the response to surgical trauma. As key modulators of the inflammatory response, oxylipins have the potential to provide novel insights into the physiological response to surgery and the pathophysiology of post-operative complications. We aimed to investigate the effects of major surgery on longitudinal oxylipin profile.Adults patients undergoing elective laparoscopic or open colorectal resections were included. Primary outcomes were serum oxylipin profile quantified by ultra high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, serum white cell count and C-reactive protein concentration. Serum samples were taken at three time-points: pre-operative (day zero), early post-operative (day one) and late post-operative (day four/five).Some 55 patients were included, of which 33 (60%) underwent surgery that was completed laparoscopically. Pre-operative oxylipin profiles were characterised by marked heterogeneity but surgery induced a common shift resulting in more homogeneity at the early post-operative time-point. By the late post-operative phase, oxylipin profiles were again highly variable. This evolution was driven by time-dependent changes in specific oxylipins. Notably, the levels of several oxylipins with anti-inflammatory properties (15-HETE and four regioisomers of DHET) were reduced at the early post-operative point before returning to baseline by the late post-operative period. In addition, levels of the pro-inflammatory 11-HETE rose in the early post-operative phase while levels of anti-thrombotic mediators ( and 13-HODE) fell; concentrations of all three oxylipins then remained fairly static from early to late post-operative phases. Compared to those undergoing laparoscopic surgery, patients undergoing open surgery had lower levels of some anti-inflammatory oxylipins (8,9-DHET and 17-HDoHE) in addition to reduced concentrations of anti-thrombotic mediators ( and 13-HODE) with increased concentration of their pro-thrombotic counterpart (TxB2).Serum oxylipin profile is modified by surgical intervention and may even be sensitive to the degree of surgical trauma and therefore represents a novel descriptor of the surgical systemic inflammatory response.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9488997>Strong increase in hydroxy fatty acids derived from linoleic acid in human low density lipoproteins of atherosclerotic patients.</a></h2><p>Linoleic acid is the most abundant fatty acid in human low density lipoproteins (LDL).

In this study the  content in the LDL of 19 obviously healthy volunteers and 17 atherosclerotic patients was investigated. The level of  obtained from LDL of young atherosclerotic patients (aged 36-47 years) was increased by a factor of 20 when compared with samples from healthy volunteers of the same age group. The content of  in the LDL of atherosclerotic patients aged between 69 and 94 years increased 30-100 fold when compared with young healthy individuals, but when compared with 'healthy' individuals of the same age group it was only 2-3 fold increased. Obviously, as individuals grow older LDL becomes more and more oxidized. Consequently, assuming that LDL oxidation is a precondition for atherosclerosis--older individuals will suffer from atherosclerosis, even if no easy detectable visible signs of this disease are recognizable.

This study determined the temporal course of oxidation of brain fatty acyl groups in a clinically relevant canine model of cardiac arrest and resuscitation and tested the hypothesis that postischemic ventilation with 21% inspired O2, rather than 100% O2, results in reduced levels of oxidized brain lipids and decreased neurological impairment.Neurological deficit scoring and high performance liquid chromatography measurement of fatty acyl  oxidation were used in an established canine model using 10 minutes of cardiac arrest followed by resuscitation with different ventilatory oxygenation protocols and restoration of spontaneous circulation for 30 minutes to 24 hours.Significant increases in frontal cortex  oxidation occurred after 10 minutes of cardiac arrest alone with no reperfusion and after reperfusion for 30 minutes, 2 hours, and 24 hours (relative total 235-nm absorbing peak areas=7.1+/-0.7 SE, 17.3+/-2.7, 14.2+/-3.2, 16.1+/-1.0, and 14.0+/-0.8, respectively; n=4, P<0.05).

To probe the mechanism of this lipolysis-induced event, we evaluated the pro-inflammatory potential of lipid classes derived from human postprandial TGRL by lipoprotein lipase (LpL). Incubation of TGRL with LpL for 30 min increased the saturated and unsaturated FFA content of the incubation solutions significantly. Furthermore, concentrations of the hydroxylated linoleates 9-hydroxy ocatadecadienoic acid () and 13-HODE were elevated by LpL lipolysis, more than other measured oxylipids. The FFA fractions elicited pro-inflammatory responses inducing TNFalpha and intracellular adhesion molecule expression and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). The FFA-mediated increase in ROS was blocked by both the cytochrome P450 2C9 inhibitor sulfaphenazole and NADPH oxidase inhibitors. Compared with linoleate, 13-HODE was found to be a more potent inducer of ROS production in HAECs, an activity that was insensitive to both NADPH oxidase and cytochrome P450 inhibitors.

The major products are erythro-11-hydroxy-12,13-epoxy-9-octadecenoic acid, threo-11-hydroxy-12,13-epoxy-9-octadecenoic acid, 9,12,13-trihydroxy-10-octadecenoic acid, 13-keto-9,11-octadecadienoic acid, and 13-hydroxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid. Several minor products have also been identified, including 9-hydroxy-12,13-epoxyoctadecenoic acid, 11-hydroxy-9,10-epoxy-12-octadecenoic acid, , and 9-keto-10,12-octadecadienoic acid. Oxygen labeling studies indicate that the observed products arise by at least two pathways. In the major pathway, hematin reduces 13-hydroperoxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid by one electron to an alkoxyl radical that cyclizes to an adjacent double bond to form an epoxy allylic radical. The allylic radical either couples to the hydroxyl radical coordinated to hematin or diffuses from the solvent cage and couples to O2, forming a peroxyl radical. In the minor pathway, the hydroperoxide is oxidized by one electron to a 13-peroxyl radical that undergoes beta-scission to a pentadienyl radical and O2. Exchange of hydroperoxide-derived O2 for dissolved O2 occurs at this stage followed by coupling of O2 to either terminus of the pentadienyl radical. Both pathways of hydroperoxide  generate significant quantities of peroxyl radicals that epoxidize the isolated double bonds of dihydroaromatic molecules. The products of hydroperoxide reaction with hematin and the oxygen labeling patterns are very similar to the products of unsaturated fatty acid hydroperoxide  by platelets, aorta, and lung. Our results not only provide a mechanism for the formation of a series of mammalian metabolites of linoleic and arachidonic acids but also offer an estimate of the yield of peroxyl radicals generated during the process.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15381085>Oxidized low-density lipoproteins may induce expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-3 in atherosclerotic plaques.</a></h2><p>Genes induced or suppressed by oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL) in human monocytic THP-1 cells were searched using the differential display reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate oxidative stress in SCH patients, as measured according to concentrations of hydroxy-octadecadienoic acids (HODEs) and hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) in both plasma and low density lipoproteins (LDL).The concentrations of HODEs and HETEs in both LDL and plasma were examined in euthyroid (n = 10), mild SCH (4.5 ≤ TSH < 10 mU/L, n = 10), and significant SCH (TSH ≥ 10 mU/L, n = 10) subjects, using a liquid chromatograph-electrospray ionization- mass spectrometer. Then, we explored the relationship among LDL oxidation, TSH levels, and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), a biomarker of subclinical atherosclerosis.Serum LDL-C levels and mean-IMT in the significant SCH group were higher than in the euthyroid group (p < 0.05).

A link has been established between respiratory exposure to vehicular emissions and the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), but the mechanisms driving this interaction remain unknown. Chronic inhalation exposure to mixed vehicle emissions has been linked to CVD in animal models. This study evaluated the temporal effects of acute exposure to mixed vehicle emissions (MVE; mixed gasoline and diesel emissions) on potentially active metabolites in the serum of exposed mice. C57Bl/6 mice were exposed to a single 6-hour exposure to filtered air (FA) or MVE (100 or 300 μg/m(3)) by whole body inhalation. Immediately after and 18 hours after the end of the exposure period, animals were sacrificed for serum and tissue collection. Serum was analyzed for metabolites that were differentially present between treatment groups and time points. Changes in metabolite levels suggestive of increased oxidative stress (oxidized glutathione, cysteine disulfide, taurine),  peroxidation (13-HODE, ), energy  (lactate, glycerate, branched chain amino acid catabolites, butrylcarnitine, fatty acids), and inflammation (DiHOME, palmitoyl ethanolamide) were observed immediately after the end of exposure in the serum of animals exposed to MVE relative to those exposed to FA. By 18 hours post exposure, serum metabolite differences between animals exposed to MVE versus those exposed to FA were less pronounced. These findings highlight complex metabolomics alterations in the circulation following inhalation exposure to a common source of combustion emissions.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8274477>Oxidized LDL induces monocytic cell expression of interleukin-8, a chemokine with T-lymphocyte chemotactic activity.</a></h2><p>T lymphocytes, macrophages, and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) are collocalized in early atherosclerotic lesions. Using a low-endotoxin in vitro system, we observed that Ox-LDL but not native LDL induced the production, by both freshly adherent human peripheral blood monocytes and human monocytic THP-1 cells, of the alpha chemokine interleukin (IL)-8, a potent chemoattractant for T lymphocytes. Marked IL-8 induction by Ox-LDL did not require IL-1 beta generation in THP-1 cells. Ox-LDL-induced chemokine production was selective, as Ox-LDL did not stimulate the production by THP-1 cells of the T-lymphocyte chemotactic beta chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha. IL-8 induction increased in proportion to the extent of oxidation of LDL as measured by the content of  oxidation end products. To identify potentially active components of Ox-LDL, we tested malondialdehyde, an arachidonate-derived  oxidation product, and 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, an oxidation product of linoleate, the major polyunsaturated fatty acid in LDL, and observed that they induced IL-8 generation in the absence of Ox-LDL. Furthermore, when most free  oxidation products were removed from Ox-LDL by dialysis, some IL-8-inducing activity was released into the dialysate. However, the major IL-8-inducing activity was not dialyzable. To address the nature of the LDL particle modification required to induce IL-8, acetylated or malondialdehyde-treated native LDL particles were monitored for activity. Neither procedure rendered LDL capable of inducing IL-8.

Here we report that human lesions contain isoprostanes as peroxidation products of arachidonic acid at a level of 27.1 +/- 21.2 pg/mg wet weight (n = 10), which corresponds to 75.9 +/- 59.3 pg/mg dry weight, n contrast, human umbilical veins (n = 10), which were used as nonatherosclerotic control vessels, contain much smaller amounts of isoprostanes (1.4 +/- 0.7 pg/mg wet weight, which corresponds to 11.7 +/- 6.2 pg/mg dry weight), and there are significant differences between the two types of vessels. As major products of linoleic acid oxidation, racemic hydroxy linoleate isomers were detected in the lesional ester lipids. In human lesions, the hydroxy linoleic acid/linoleic acid ratio was about 0.5%, a result indicating that 5 out of 1000 linoleate residues are present as hydroxylated derivatives. In umbilical veins, no hydroxy linoleic acid could be detected. These data show that human atherosclerotic lesions contain increased amounts of hydroxy linoleic acid isomers and isoprostanes when compared with nonatherosclerotic vessel wall and suggest a link between local  peroxidation and progression of atherosclerosis.

Here, further physiological functions of LOXs within whole cotyledons of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) were analyzed by measuring the endogenous amounts of LOX-derived products. The -body LOX-derived esterified (13 S)-hydroperoxy linoleic acid was the dominant metabolite of the LOX pathway in this tissue. It accumulated to about 14 micromol/g fresh weight, which represented about 6% of the total amount of linoleic acid in cotyledons. This LOX product was not only reduced to its hydroxy derivative, leading to degradation by beta-oxidation, but alternatively it was metabolized by fatty acid hydroperoxide lyase leading to formation of hexanal as well. Furthermore, the activities of LOX forms metabolizing linolenic acid were detected by measuring the accumulation of volatile aldehydes and the allene oxide synthase-derived metabolite jasmonic acid.

In a recent study, we provided evidence that infestation of Arabidopsis thaliana foliage by the green peach aphid (GPA; Myzus persicae), a phloem sap-consuming insect, was promoted by plant LOX5-derived oxylipins. In comparison to the wild-type (WT) plant, GPA population was smaller on the Arabidopsis lox5 mutant. The insect spent less time feeding from the sieve element and xylem of the lox5 mutant compared with the WT plant. In addition, compared with insects feeding on the WT plant, when on the lox5 mutant, the GPA was unable to suppress an antibiotic activity that is present in Arabidopsis vascular sap. Roots are the critical source of a LOX5-derived oxylipin(s) that promotes colonization of the foliage by GPA. Here we show that the 9-hydoxy-10E, 12Z-octadecadienoic acid (9-HOD), a LOX5-derived oxylipin, accumulated in GPA that were reared on the WT, but not the lox5 mutant plant. However, 9-HOD accumulated in insects reared on lox5 mutant plants that were irrigated with 9-HOD, thus indicating that the insect ingests oxylipins from the host plant. We further demonstrate that the host plant requires LOX5 function to promote expression of the defense regulatory gene PHYTOALEXIN-DEFICIENT4 in the foliage. Taken together, our previous observations and results presented here indicate that while the host plant utilizes LOX5-dependent factors for promoting defense mechanisms, GPA has evolved to utilize plant 9-LOX-derived oxylipins as cues to facilitate infestation, thus suggesting a complex involvement of oxylipins in Arabidopsis interaction with GPA.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17164225>Inducible expression of 15-lipoxygenase-2 and 8-lipoxygenase inhibits cell growth via common signaling pathways.</a></h2><p>Human 15-lipoxygenase (LOX)-2 and mouse 8-LOX represent orthologous members of the LOX family but display different positional specificities and tissue distribution. To study the functional role of 15-LOX-2 and 8-LOX in keratinocytes, an inducible Tet-On gene expression system was established in the premalignant mouse keratinocyte cell line 308. Doxycycline (dox)-induced expression of enzymatically active 15-LOX-2 and 8-LOX led to an inhibition of cell growth that was associated with an inhibition of DNA synthesis, as shown by a 15-46% reduction of 5-bromo-2-deoxy-uridine (BrdU) incorporation. The inhibitory effects were increased in the presence of exogenous arachidonic acid. In contrast, addition of linoleic acid or the LOX inhibitor baicalein reversed the growth-inhibitory effects. Treatment of the cells with 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) or 8-HETE resulted in a similar inhibition of BrdU incorporation, whereas 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE) and , in contrast, had no effects.

The antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine and a specific inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, but not of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 or c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated kinases, completely abolished the LOX-induced growth inhibition, indicating a critical role of ROS and p38.

Oxidative stress may be a hallmark of X-ALD. In the plasma of X-ALD patients with different forms of the disease, characterized by high levels of C24:0 and C26:0, we observed the presence of oxidative stress revealed by decreased levels of GSH, α-tocopherol, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). We showed that oxidative stress caused the oxidation of cholesterol and linoleic acid, leading to the formation of cholesterol oxide derivatives oxidized at C7 (7-ketocholesterol (7KC), 7β-hydroxycholesterol (7β-OHC), and 7α-hydroxycholesrol (7α-OHC)) and of 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (, 13-HODE), respectively. High levels of 7KC, 7β-OHC, 7α-OHC,  and 13-HODE were found. As 7KC induces oxidative stress, inflammation and cell death, which could play key roles in the development of X-ALD, the impact of 7KC on the peroxisomal status was determined in microglial BV-2 cells. Indeed, environmental stress factors such as 7KC could exacerbate peroxisomal dysfunctions in microglial cells and thus determine the progression of the disease. 7KC induces oxiapoptophagy in BV-2 cells: overproduction of HO and O, presence of cleaved caspase-3 and PARP, nuclear condensation and/or fragmentation; elevated [LC3-II/LC3-I] ratio, increased p62 levels. 7KC also induces several peroxisomal modifications: decreased Abcd1, Abcd2, Abcd3, Acox1 and/or Mfp2 mRNA and protein levels, increased catalase activity and decreased Acox1-activity. However, the Pex14 level was unchanged. It is suggested that high levels of 7KC in X-ALD patients could foster generalized peroxisomal dysfunction in microglial cells, which could in turn intensify brain damage.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is the source of this , owing to the uptake of oxidised LDL by scavenger receptors. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) released by leukocytes during inflammation produces oxidants that are implicated in atherosclerosis. Modification of LDL by the MPO oxidant hypochlorous acid (HOCl), results in extensive  accumulation by macrophages. However, the reactivity of the other major MPO oxidant, hypothiocyanous acid (HOSCN) with LDL is poorly characterised, which is significant given that thiocyanate is the favoured substrate for MPO. In this study, we comprehensively compare the reactivity of HOCl and HOSCN with LDL, and show key differences in the profile of oxidative damage observed. HOSCN selectively modifies Cys residues on apolipoprotein B100, and oxidises cholesteryl esters resulting in formation of  hydroperoxides,  () and F2-isoprostanes. The modification of LDL by HOSCN results macrophage  accumulation, though generally to a lesser extent than HOCl-modified LDL. This suggests that a change in the ratio of HOSCN:HOCl formation by MPO from variations in plasma thiocyanate levels, will influence the nature of LDL oxidation in vivo, and has implications for the progression of atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Dietary  plays an important role in alcoholic liver disease pathogenesis. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that a combination of ethanol and a diet rich in linoleic acid (LA) leads to the increased production of oxidized LA metabolites (OXLAMs), specifically 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (HODEs), which contribute to a hepatic proinflammatory response exacerbating liver injury. Mice were fed unsaturated (with a high LA content) or saturated  diets (USF and SF, respectively) with or without ethanol for 10 days, followed by a single binge of ethanol. Compared to SF+ethanol, mice fed USF+ethanol had elevated plasma alanine transaminase levels, enhanced hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Plasma and liver levels of 9- and 13-HODEs were increased in response to USF+ethanol feeding. We demonstrated that primarily , but not 13-HODE, induced the expression of several proinflammatory cytokines in vitro in RAW264.7 macrophages. Finally, deficiency of arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase, a major enzyme involved in LA oxidation and OXLAM production, attenuated liver injury and inflammation caused by USF+ethanol feeding but had no effect on hepatic steatosis.

Levels of selected proteins were measured by Western blot and metabolic intermediates were analyzed by mass spectrometry.MR increased  in inguinal adipose tissue and quadriceps muscle while it decreased  synthesis in liver. In inguinal adipose tissue, MR not only caused the transcriptional upregulation of genes associated with fatty acid synthesis but also of Lpin1, Pc, Pck1 and Pdk1, genes that are associated with glyceroneogenesis. MR also upregulated lipolysis-associated genes in inguinal  and led to increased oxidation in this tissue, as suggested by higher levels of methionine sulfoxide and 13-HODE +  compared to control-fed (CF) rats. Moreover, MR caused a trend toward the downregulation of inflammation-associated genes in inguinal adipose tissue. MRC reversed most gene and metabolite changes induced by MR in inguinal adipose tissue, but drove the expression of Elovl6, Lpin1, Pc, and Pdk1 below CF levels. In liver, MR decreased levels of a number of long-chain fatty acids, glycerol and glycerol-3-phosphate corresponding with the gene expression data. Although MR increased the expression of genes associated with carbohydrate , levels of glycolytic intermediates were below CF levels. MR, however, stimulated gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis in liver tissue. As previously reported, sulfur amino acids derived from methionine were decreased in liver by MR, but homocysteine levels were elevated. Increased liver homocysteine levels by MR were associated with decreased cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) protein levels and lowered vitamin B6 and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5MeTHF) content. Finally, MR upregulated fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) gene and protein levels in both liver and adipose tissues. MRC reversed some of MR's effects in liver and upregulated the transcription of genes associated with inflammation and carcinogenesis such as Cxcl16, Cdh17, Mmp12, Mybl1, and Cav1 among others.

Mn-induced PC12 cell death is both time and concentration dependent with approximately 50% cell survival at 48 hr in the presence of 0.3 mM Mn.

The selective inhibitor of caspase-3, DEVD-CHO, and the nonselective caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK, however, fail to prevent Mn-induced PC12 cell death. Studies were performed to determine the role of mitochondria in initiating or supporting Mn cytotoxicity, because Mn has been reported to cause changes in membrane permeability. Mn caused a decrease in ATP levels in PC12 cells in both a time and concentration dependent manner.

In analyses by subtype, heterogeneity was suggested for 8-HETE [serous OR (95% CI): 2.53 (1.18-5.39) vs. nonserous OR (95% CI): 1.15 (0.56-2.36),   0.1] and 12,13-EpOME [1.95 (0.90-4.22) vs. 0.82 (0.39-1.73), 0.05].Women with increased levels of five fatty acid metabolites (8-HETE, 12,13-DHOME, 13-HODE, , and 9,12,13-THOME) were at increased risk of developing ovarian cancer in the ensuing decade. All five metabolites are derived from either arachidonic acid (8-HETE) or linoleic acid (12,13-DHOME, 13-HODE, , 9,12,13-THOME) via  through the LOX/cytochrome P450 pathway.The identification of these risk-related fatty acid metabolites provides mechanistic insights into the etiology of ovarian cancer and indicates the direction for future research.©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11232024>The suppressive effect of dietary restriction and weight loss in the obese on the generation of reactive oxygen species by leukocytes,  peroxidation, and protein carbonylation.</a></h2><p>Increased reactive oxygen species generation by the leukocytes of the obese may be responsible for increased oxidative injury to lipids and proteins and, hence, atherosclerosis. We have investigated whether reactive oxygen species generation by leukocytes and other indexes of oxidative damage in the body fall with short-term dietary restriction and weight loss. Nine nondiabetic obese subjects (body mass index, 32.5-64.4 kg/m(2)), not taking any antioxidants, were put on a 1000-Cal diet. Fasting blood samples were taken at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks and at 12 weeks after the cessation of dietary restriction. Blood samples were also obtained at 1 and 2 h after administration of 75 g oral glucose at 0 and 4 weeks. Mononuclear cells (MNC) and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) were isolated, and reactive oxygen species generation was measured. Plasma concentrations of thiobarbituric acid-reactive species (TBARS), 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE), 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (), carbonylated proteins, o-tyrosine, and m-tyrosine as indexes of oxidative damage to lipids, proteins and amino acids, respectively, were measured. Antioxidant vitamins were measured as indexes of antioxidant reserves. Plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentrations were also measured. Mean weight loss was 2.4 +/- 0.6 kg at week 1, 2.5 +/- 1.7 kg at week 2, 3.9 +/- 0.8 kg at week 3, and 4.5 +/- 2.8 kg at week 4 (P < 0.05). Reactive oxygen species generation by PMN fell from 236.4 +/- 95.8 to 150.9 +/- 69.0, 125.9 +/- 24.3, 96.0 +/- 39.9, and 103.1 +/- 35.7 mV at weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively (P < 0.001). It increased 3 months after the cessation of dietary restriction to 270.0 +/- 274.3 mV. Reactive oxygen species generation by MNC fell from 187.8 +/- 75.0 to 101.7 +/- 64.5, 86.9 +/- 42.8, 63.8 +/- 14.3, and 75.1 +/- 32.2 mV and increased thereafter to 302.0 +/- 175.5 mV at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 16 weeks, respectively (P < 0.005). Reactive oxygen species generation by PMN and MNC increased in response to glucose; the relative increase was greater at 4 weeks than that at week 0 due to a fall in the basal levels of reactive oxygen species generation. Consistent with the fall in reactive oxygen species generation, there was a reduction in plasma TBARS from 1.68 +/- 0.17 micromol/L at week 0 to 1.47 micromol/L at 4 weeks (P < 0.05). The 13-HODE to linoleic acid ratio fell from a baseline of 100% to 56.4 +/- 36.1% at 4 weeks (P < 0.05), and the  to linoleic acid ratio fell from a baseline of 100% to 60.5 +/- 37.7% at 4 weeks (P < 0.05). Carbonylated proteins fell from 1.39 +/- 0.27 microgram/mg protein at week 0 to 1.17 +/- 0.12 microgram/mg protein at week 4 (P < 0.05); o-tyrosine fell from 0.42 +/- 0.03 mmol/mol phenylalanine at week 0 to 0.36 +/- 0.02 mmol/mol phenylalanine at 4 weeks (P < 0.005), and m-tyrosine fell from 0.45 +/- 0.04 mmol/mol phenylalanine at week 0 to 0.40 +/- 0.03 mmol/mol phenylalanine at 4 weeks (P < 0.05). The basal concentrations of TBARS, , 13-HODE, carbonylated proteins, o-tyrosine, and m-tyrosine in the obese were significantly greater than those in normal subjects. On the other hand, tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentrations did not change during this 4-week period, nor was there any change in antioxidant vitamins. This is the first demonstration of 1) an increase in reactive oxygen species-induced damage in lipids, proteins, and amino acids in the obese compared with normal subjects; and 2) a decrease in reactive oxygen species generation by leukocytes and oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and amino acids after dietary restriction and weight loss in the obese over a short period.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8178971>13-HODE increases intracellular calcium in vascular smooth muscle cells.</a></h2><p>13-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE) (2 microM) consistently increased porcine aortic and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i), whereas  and linoleic acid had no significant effect in the aortic cells and a much lesser effect in the pulmonary artery cells. A transient increase in [Ca2+]i occurred with as little as 50 nM 13-HODE.

Internal standards consisting of 18O2-labeled analogs of 9- and 13-HODE are added to pulverized frozen tissue prior to extraction with ethanol. Nonlipid materials are removed in a chloroform/methanol/water step. The remaining  material is methylated with ethereal diazomethane, and much of the nonoxygenated fatty acid methyl esters are removed via silica solid-phase extraction. Samples are either further derivatized with bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide to form the trimethylsilyl ethers for quantitative analysis by GC-MS or are analyzed as the methyl esters by chiral high-performance liquid chromatography to determine the enantiomeric distribution of the 9- and 13-HODE. The extraction and quantitation protocol was applied to the analysis of mammary glands for free 9- and 13-HODE from mice fed isocaloric diets containing 20% corn oil, 5% corn oil, or 20% beef tallow. Chiral analysis of the products showed higher production of 13(S)-HODE relative to 13(R)-HODE; the enantiomeric excess is most likely due to enzymatic production of 13-HODE superimposed on a background of autoxidative production of 13(R)- plus 9(S)- and 9(R)-HODE. In addition, the effect of sample handling and storage conditions on the formation of 9- and 13-HODE in the samples was assessed by exposing aliquots of a common pool of rat mammary gland tissue to specified conditions prior to analysis.

While 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid () is a constituent of oxidized LDL and can by itself induce IL-1 beta release, its potency relative to oxidized LDL suggested that other components of modified LDL may also contribute to this phenomenon. In this study, LDL of varying oxidation states were prepared by altering the Cu2+ to LDL ratio and/or the length of oxidation. The oxidation status of LDL was measured as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), electrophoretic mobility in agarose gels, and the content of 9- and 13-HODE. High Cu2+ to LDL ratios promoted extensive TBARS formation and these LDL were the most potent activators of IL-1 beta release, although LDL with TBARS greater than 50 nmol/mg protein were cytotoxic and IL-1 beta release was diminished. An inverse correlation between HODE content and TBARS was found indicating -derived aldehydes also contribute to IL-1 beta release by oxidized LDL. Accordingly, dialysis of oxidized LDL removed nearly all aldehydes and rendered the LDL unable to induce IL-1 beta release. The alkenals 2,4-decadienal and 2-octenal were tested and shown to induce IL-1 beta release while their saturated homologues had no effect. The predominant aldehyde in Cu(2+)-oxidized LDL was hexanal, with the unsaturated aldehydes 2,4-heptadienal, 2-octenal, and 2,4-decadienal also being present.

The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that the acute inhibitory effects of CLA isomers and trans FAs on FA transport in tumors and white adipose tissue are mediated via an inhibitory G-protein coupled (GPC), FFA receptor (FFAR). Experiments were performed in hepatoma 7288CTC and inguinal  pads in Buffalo rats during perfusion in situ. CLA isomers and trans FAs (0.03-0.4 mmol/L, in plasma) were added to the arterial blood, and FA uptake or release was measured by arterial minus venous difference. In hepatoma 7288CTC, the CLA isomers, t10,c12-CLA > (+/-)- [13-(S)-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid] > t9,t11-CLA, and the trans FAs, linolelaidic = vaccenic > elaidic, decreased cAMP content and inhibited FA uptake, 13(S)-HODE release, extracellular signal-regulated kinase p44/p42 phosphorylation, and [(3)H]thymidine incorporation. Other CLA isomers, c9,t11-CLA, 13-(S)-HODE, c9,c11-CLA, and c11,t13-CLA, had no effect. In inguinal  pads, FA transport was inhibited by t10,c12-CLA = linolelaidic acid > trans vaccenic acid, whereas c9,t11-CLA had no effect. In both hepatoma 7288CTC and inguinal  pad, addition of either pertussis toxin or 8-Br-cAMP to the arterial blood reversed the inhibitions of FA transport. These results support the idea that an inhibitory GPC FFAR reduces cAMP and controls FA transport by CLA isomers and trans FAs.

However, the postprandial responsiveness of these compounds is largely unknown; therefore, changes in the circulating oxylipin and endocannabinoid metabolome in response to a challenge meal were investigated at six occasions in a subject who freely modified her usual diet. The dietary change, and especially the challenge meal itself, represented a modification of precursor fatty acid status, with expectedly subtle effects on bioactive  levels. To detect even the slightest alteration, highly sensitive ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to electrospray ionization (ESI) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) methods for bioactive  profiling was employed. A previously validated UPLC-ESI-MS/MS method for profiling the endocannabinoid metabolome was used, while validation of an UPLC-ESI-MS/MS method for oxylipin analysis was performed with acceptable outcomes for a majority of the parameters according to the US Food and Drug Administration guidelines for linearity (0.9938 < R2 < 0.9996), limit of detection (0.0005-2.1 pg on column), limit of quantification (0.0005-4.2 pg on column), inter- and intraday accuracy (85-115%) and precision (< 5%), recovery (40-109%) and stability (40-105%). Forty-seven of fifty-two bioactive lipids were detected in plasma samples at fasting and in the postprandial state (0.5, 1, and 3 hours after the meal). Multivariate analysis showed a significant shift of bioactive  profiles in the postprandial state due to inclusion of dairy products in the diet, which was in line with univariate analysis revealing seven compounds (NAGly, , 13-oxo-ODE, 9(10)-EpOME, 12(13)-EpOME, 20-HETE, and 11,12-DHET) that were significantly different between background diets in the postprandial state (but not at fasting). The only change in baseline levels at fasting was displayed by TXB2. Furthermore, postprandial responsiveness was detected for seven compounds (POEA, SEA, 9(10)-DiHOME, 12(13)-DiHOME, 13-oxo-ODE, , and 13-HODE). Hence, the data confirm that the UPLC-ESI-MS/MS method performance was sufficient to detect i) a shift, in the current case most notably in the postprandial bioactive  metabolome, caused by changes in diet and ii) responsiveness to a challenge meal for a subset of the oxylipin and endocannabinoid metabolome.

However, the underlying mechanism responsible for the beneficial effects of PTX in NASH remains unidentified. A key role of  oxidation in the pathogenesis and progression of NASH has been established. PTX is known to decrease free-radical-mediated oxidative stress and inhibit  oxidation. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of PTX on levels of  oxidation products in patients with NASH. Levels of multiple structurally specific oxidized fatty acids including hydroxy-octadecadienoic acids (HODEs), oxo-octadecadienoic acids (oxoODEs), and hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) were quantified by mass spectrometry in plasma obtained at baseline and at study completion in patients who completed 1 year of therapy with PTX or placebo in a randomized controlled trial. Therapy with PTX resulted in significant decreases in  and 13-oxoODE, oxidized  products of linoleic acid (LA) linked to histological severity in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Similarly, PTX therapy was associated with significant decreases in 8-HETE, 9-HETE, and 11-HETE compared to placebo. Statistically significant correlations were demonstrated between the decrease in HODEs and oxoODEs and improved histological scores of fibrosis and between the decrease in HETEs and improved lobular inflammation.Therapy with PTX compared to placebo was associated with a significant reduction of oxidized fatty acids. This novel evidence supports that the beneficial effects of PTX in patients with NASH are likely partly mediated through decreasing  oxidation, largely free-radical-mediated  oxidation. Additionally, this is the first report on the link between decreased oxidized  products and improved histological disease in the setting of a therapeutic trial in NASH.Copyright © 2012 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8228632>Synthesis of monohydroxylated fatty acids from linoleic acid by rat aortic smooth muscle cells and tissues: influence on prostacyclin production.</a></h2><p>We have investigated whether cellular  of linoleic acid (18:2) can influence prostacyclin (PGI2) production by cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells (SMC) and tissues. Incubation of rat SMC homogenates with [1-14C]18:2 results in the enzymatic synthesis of [14C]13-HODE (hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid) and to a lesser extent [14C] as defined by gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (GLC-MS). The observed changes, in percent enzymatically synthesized 13-HODE in the presence of indomethacin, aspirin, metyrapone, 15-HPETE (hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid), and NDGA, suggest that it is formed from the PGH (prostaglandin endoperoxide) synthase pathway. Incubation of intact adherent SMC with [14C]linoleic acid demonstrates that the monohydroxylated compounds are predominantly esterified within the membrane phospholipids and not released into the incubation medium. The simultaneous incubation or a short-term preincubation of 18:2 and arachidonic acid (20:4) do not modify the enzymatic profile of 20:4 transformation. By contrast, long-term preincubation of cells with 18:2 or 13-HODE stimulates the transformation of exogenously added [14C]20:4 to [14C]6-keto PGF1 alpha. However, exogenous 13-HODE does not enhance [14C]6-keto PGF1 alpha recovery from [14C]20:4 prelabeled SMCs. Our results demonstrate that 18:2 is a substrate for PGH-synthase in rat aortic SMC and tissues.

This can be exemplified by the production of anti-inflammatory oxidized fatty acids and proinflammatory lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) during LDL oxidation. We have shown previously that oxidized LDL (oxLDL) plays an active role at the interface between innate and adaptive immunity by delivering instructive molecules such as LPC, which promotes mature dendritic cell (DC) generation from differentiating monocytes. It is shown in this study that LPC affects the signaling pathway of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). LPC-induced DC maturation is associated with complete inhibition of PPARgamma activity and up-regulation of the activity of an uncharacterized nuclear receptor that bind peroxisome proliferator response element. Oxidized fatty acids generated during LDL oxidation are natural ligands for PPARgamma and inhibit oxLDL- and LPC-induced maturation. Inhibition experiments with synthetic PPARgamma ligands suggested a PPARgamma-dependent and independent effect of LPC on DC maturation. Therefore, the relative amount of oxidized fatty acids and LPC influences the immunological functions of oxLDL on DC, in part by regulating the PPAR pathway. By sensing the biochemical composition of lipoprotein particles, the innate immune system may thus identify various endogenous signals that influence the immune response during the acute-phase reaction. The therapeutic emulsion intralipid also blocks LPC action on PPAR activity and DC maturation. Intralipid may thus be an alternative therapeutic strategy for some chronic inflammatory diseases.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10342328>Oxysterols in cap and core of human advanced atherosclerotic lesions.</a></h2><p>Different parts of the advanced atherosclerotic lesion have characteristic differences in  content, but the distribution of  oxidation products has not been reported.

The oxidation products, cholest-5-en-3beta,26-diol (26-OH-CHOL) and cholest-5-en-3beta,7beta-diol (7beta-OH-CHOL) were detected in all the samples. 26-OH-CHOL was more abundant in the core than in the cap when related both to wet weight and to cholesterol. 7Beta-OH-CHOL levels were significantly higher in the core than in the cap when related to wet weight but not when related to cholesterol. Because the processing included a sodium borohydride reduction step, the 7beta-OH-CHOL detected could partly originate from 7-ketocholesterol or 7-hydroperoxycholesterol. Several isomeric hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids were detected in both core and cap, more in the cap when related to cholesterol content. Most of the components of the cap showed a high degree of cross-correlation on linear regression analysis, but cross-correlations were weaker for the core. The core samples contained a larger proportion of linoleate relative to oleate than the fibrous cap.The findings suggest that the different  and oxidised  contents of cap and core may be due to variations in oxidative activity in different parts of the lesion.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10320803>Formation of 9-hydroxy linoleic acid as a product of phospholipid peroxidation in diabetic erythrocyte membranes.</a></h2><p>The increased production of oxygen-derived free radicals (OFR) and  peroxidation may contribute to vascular complications in diabetes.

We have identified 9-hydroxy linoleic acid (9-OH-C18:2) in the red cell membrane phospholipid of diabetic subjects. We hypothesized that 9-OH-C18:2 would be formed in hydroxyl radical reactions to linoleic acid (C18:2) during glucose-induced oxidative stress, and confirmed that the formation of 9-OH-C18:2 was induced by ultraviolet (UV)-C irradiation to the synthetic C18:2. UV-C light generates highly reactive hydroxy radicals. C18:2 is confirmed to be the precursor of 9-OH-C18:2. To estimate the degree of oxidative damage to red cell membrane phospholipids, we developed a selective ion monitoring gas chromatography-mass spectrometric measurement for C18:2 and 9-OH-C18:2, following methanolysis of red cell membrane phospholipids. The relative peak height ratio of C18:2 to 9-OH-C18:2 (9-OH-C18:2/C18:2) was measured in phospholipid extracts of red cell membranes from healthy (n=29, 3.1+/-1.9%) and diabetic (n=27, 20. 9+/-16.1%) subjects.

Peroxidation of RBC membranes caused a profound decrease in the amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids and concomitantly hydroperoxides, as primary products of peroxidation, appeared in the phospholipids. Hydroperoxides were predominantly generated in choline glycerophospholipid (CGP), while the extent of formation of ethanolamine glycerophospholipid (EGP) hydroperoxides was low and their presence was transient. Hydroxy and hydroperoxy moieties in CGP were identified as 9-hydroxy and 13-hydroxy octadecanoic acid, derived from linoleic acid, by gas chromatography-mass spectrometric analysis. No consistent generation of hydroperoxide from arachidonic acid was evident in CGP. The CGP-hydroperoxide accounted for approximately 76% of linoleic acid consumed during peroxidation of RBC membranes. The prominent generation of phospholipid hydroperoxides was observed in the linoleic acid-rich membranes from rabbit RBC, indicating that the level of linoleic acid in phospholipids determines, in part, the extent of formation of phospholipid hydroperoxides. Aldehydic phospholipids, as secondary products of peroxidation, were detected in oxidized membranes. EGP was the most prominent aldehydic phospholipid, while negligible amounts of aldehydic CGP were formed.

A direct effect of DE exposure on hepatocytes was demonstrated by treatment of HepG2 cells with a methanol extract of DE particles followed by loading with oleic acid. As observed in vivo, this led to increased triglyceride content and significant downregulation of ACAD9 mRNA expression. Treatment of HepG2 cells with DE particles and oleic acid did not alter de novo lipogenesis but inhibited total, mitochondrial, and ATP-linked oxygen consumption rate, indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction. Treatment of isolated mitochondria, prepared from mouse liver, with DE particles and oleic acid also inhibited mitochondrial complex activity and β-oxidation.DE exposure leads to dyslipidemia and liver steatosis in ApoE knockout mice, likely due to mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased  catabolism.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23973531>Development of a high-throughput ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry assay to profile 18 eicosanoids as exploratory biomarkers for atherosclerotic diseases.</a></h2><p>Abundant evidence suggests a prominent role for eicosanoids and metabolites in the pathogenesis and prognosis of inflammatory diseases. A sensitive and high-throughput SPE UPLC-MS/MS method was developed to quantitatively interrogate the levels of 18 eicosanoids in human and monkey plasma samples. A limit of quantitation of 0.25ng/mL was achieved for all 18 investigated compounds with linear ranges spanning four orders of magnitude. Bioanalytical performance of this assay was fully characterized including SPE extraction efficiency, matrix effect, autosampler stability, benchtop stability and freeze-thaw cycle variability. Endogenous levels of the eicosanoids and analogs within a set of monkey plasma samples challenged with lipopolysaccharide and human plasma samples were quantified by this ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) assay. Quantitative eicosanoid profiles of the human samples were further analyzed by a non-supervised cluster analysis, which revealed a set of potential positive and negative  biomarkers to distinguish the following three groups: healthy individuals, hypertensive patients and severe atherosclerosis patients. The components of the negative biomarker cluster (8-HETE, LTB4,  and 13-HODE) are putative ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), a family of master genes controlling the resolution of inflammatory signaling.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We hypothesized that inflammation is an upstream event in the pathogenesis of ADPKD and may be a contributing factor in the disease severity and progression. Serum samples from 61 HALT study A group patients were compared with samples from 49 patients from HALT study B group with moderately advanced disease. Targeted MS analysis of bioactive lipid mediators as markers of inflammation was performed and correlated with eGFR and total kidney volume (TKV) normalized to the body surface area (BSAR) to assess if these markers are predictive of ADPKD severity. ADPKD patients with eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) showed higher levels of 5- and 12/15-lipoxygenase (LOX) and cyclooxygenase, and generated higher levels of hydroxy-octadecadienoic acids  and 13-HODE and HETEs 8-HETE, 11-HETE, 12-HETE, and 15-HETE as compared with healthy subjects. Linear regression of  and 13-HODE revealed a significant relationship with eGFR and TKV, while 15-HETE significantly correlated with TKV/BSAR. Production of 20-HETE, a P450-produced metabolite of arachidonic acid, was higher in ADPKD patients as compared with healthy subjects and significantly correlated with eGFR and TKV/BSAR. Perturbation in fatty acid  is evident early in ADPKD patients, even in those with preserved kidney function. The identified LOX  may be potential therapeutic targets for slowing down ADPKD progression.Copyright © 2014 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1629217>Induction of interleukin 1 beta expression from human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages by 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid.</a></h2><p>Oxidatively modified low density lipoproteins (LDL) have recently been proposed to play a role in atherogenesis by promoting foam cell formation and endothelial cell toxicity. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether modified LDL could also induce macrophage release of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), a cytokine which enhances vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, another feature of the atherosclerotic process. LDL were oxidatively modified by incubation with either Cu2+ (Cu(2+)-LDL) or human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages (M-LDL). Incubation of these modified LDL with macrophages (6 x 10(6) cells/culture) resulted in a dose-dependent induction of IL-1 beta release. At 300 micrograms protein/ml, Cu(2+)-LDL and M-LDL induced 422 and 333 pg of IL-1 beta/culture, respectively. Saponified Cu(2+)-LDL and M-LDL were shown to contain 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE),  oxidation products of linoleate. When tested for activity in macrophage culture (3 x 10(6) cells/culture), it was found that  and 13-HODE (final concentration 33 microM) induced the release of 122 and 43 pg of IL-1 beta/culture, respectively, whereas untreated cells released only 4 pg of IL-1 beta/culture. Incubation of macrophages with cholesteryl- also induced IL-1 beta release; however, the degree of induction of IL-1 beta release by  or its cholesteryl ester relative to modified LDL suggests that other components in oxidized LDL may also contribute to IL-1 beta induction.  was rapidly taken up by macrophages, and the kinetics were similar to IL-1 beta release. A 1.5- to 6-fold increase in the level of IL-1 beta mRNA was detected as little as 3-h post- treatment. The induction of IL-1 beta release from human monocyte-derived macrophages by  and cholesteryl- suggests a role for modified LDL, and its associated linoleate oxidation products, in vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11884452>Dualism of oxidized lipoproteins in provoking and attenuating the oxidative burst in macrophages: role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma.</a></h2><p>Activation and deactivation of macrophages are of considerable importance during the development of various disease states, atherosclerosis among others. Macrophage activation is achieved by oxidized lipoproteins (oxLDL) and is determined by oxygen radical (ROS) formation. The oxidative burst was measured by flow cytometry and quantitated by oxidation of the redox-sensitive dye dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate. Short-time stimulation dose-dependently elicited ROS formation. Diphenylene iodonium prevented ROS formation, thus pointing to the involvement of a NAD(P)H oxidase in producing reduced oxygen species. In contrast, preincubation of macrophages with oxLDL for 16 h showed an attenuated oxidative burst upon a second contact with oxLDL. Taking into account that oxLDL is an established peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) agonist and considering the anti-inflammatory properties of PPARgamma, we went on and showed that a PPARgamma agonist such as ciglitazone attenuated ROS formation. Along that line, major  peroxidation products of oxLDL, such as 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, shared that performance. Supporting evidence that PPARgamma activation accounted for reduced ROS generation came from studies in which proliferator-activated receptor response element decoy oligonucleotides, but not a mutated oligonucleotide, supplied in front of oxLDL delivery regained a complete oxidative burst upon cell activation. We conclude that oxLDL not only elicits an oxidative burst upon first contact, but also promotes desensitization of macrophages via activation of PPARgamma. Desensitization of macrophages may have important consequences for the behavior of macrophages/foam cells in atherosclerotic lesions.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23006841>The cytochrome P450 inhibitor, ketoconazole, inhibits oxidized linoleic acid metabolite-mediated peripheral inflammatory pain.</a></h2><p>Oxidized linoleic acid metabolites (OLAMs) are a class of endogenous agonists to the transient receptor potential V1 (TRPV1) receptor. Although TRPV1 mediates inflammatory heat hyperalgesia, it is not known if the OLAMs contribute to the peripheral activation of this receptor during tissue inflammation. In the present study, we evaluated whether the OLAM system is activated during inflammation and whether cytochrome P450 enzymes mediate OLAM contributions to heat hyperalgesia using the complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) model of inflammation.Our results demonstrate that the intraplantar (ipl) injection of anti-OLAM antibodies significantly reversed CFA-induced heat hyperalgesia. Moreover, application of  extracts from inflamed rat skin to cultured sensory neurons triggered a significant release of iCGRP that is blocked by co-treatment with I-RTX, a TRPV1 antagonist. To determine the role of CYP enzymes in mediating OLAM effects, we used a broad spectrum CYP inhibitor, ketoconazole. Pretreatment with ketoconazole inhibited the release of TRPV1 agonists in  extracts from inflamed skin and significantly reversed CFA-induced heat hyperalgesia by a peripheral mechanism of action. Moreover, the ipl injection of linoleic acid to rats 24 hr after CFA evoked spontaneous nocifensive behaviors that were significantly reduced by capsazepine, by knockout of the TRPV1 gene, or by pretreatment with either anti-OLAM antibodies or ketoconazole.Taken together, our data suggests that OLAMs contribute to inflammatory nociception in the periphery and that cytochrome P450 enzymes play a crucial role in mediating OLAM contributions to inflammatory heat hyperalgesia.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30551591>Influence of Liver Condition and Copper on Selective Parameters of Post-Mortem Dog Tissue Samples.</a></h2><p>One of the liver functions is copper storage, which can be toxic when in excess. The objective of this retrospective study was to determine the relationship between hepatic copper and pathology conditions in stored samples from 55 post-mortem dogs (37 Beagles, 12 Labrador Retrievers, and 6 Labrador Mixes). The analyses evaluated data from blood chemistry and complete blood count (CBC) that were measured immediately before euthanasia, and liver biopsies which were harvested at necropsy and frozen at -80 °C. Slides for microscopic evaluation were prepared, and liver copper and plasma metabolites were measured. Hepatic copper was correlated ( ≤ 0.001) with monoacylglycerols, 13-HODE +  (13-hydroxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid + ), and stearoyl-arachidonoyl-glycerophosphocholine. This indicates  modification and cell membrane oxidation. However, hepatic copper was not related to liver histopathology severity or altered liver biomarkers. The severity of liver pathology was positively correlated ( ≤ 0.05) with liver enzymes, bile salts, and glycerophosphocholines, suggesting cholestasis and altered  and amino acid . Liver neoplasia had increased ( ≤ 0.05) metabolites derived from nucleotides, along with an increase ( ≤ 0.05) in α-ketoglutarate from the energy and amino acid  ( ≤ 0.05), suggesting rapid cell division.
