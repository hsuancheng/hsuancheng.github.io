<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15345486>Role of hydrogen peroxide in ACh-induced dilation of human submucosal intestinal microvessels.</a></h2><p>The endothelium plays an important role in maintaining vascular homeostasis by synthesizing and releasing several mediators of vasodilation, which include prostacyclin (PGI(2)), nitric oxide, and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF). We have recently defined the role of nitric oxide and PGI(2) in the dilation of submucosal intestinal arterioles from patients with normal bowel function. However, significant endothelium-dependent dilator capacity to ACh remained after inhibiting both these mediators. The current study was designed to examine the potential role of EDHF in human intestinal submucosal arterioles. ACh elicited endothelium-dependent relaxation in the presence of inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase (23 +/- 10%, n = 6). This ACh-induced relaxation was inhibited and converted to constriction by catalase (-53 +/- 10%, n = 6) or KCl (-30 +/- 3%, n = 7), whereas  and 6-(2-propargylloxyphenyl) hexanoic acid, two inhibitors of cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, had no significant effect (3 +/- 1% and 20 +/- 8%, n = 5, respectively). Exogenous H(2)O(2) elicited dose-dependent relaxation of intact microvessels (52 +/- 10%, n = 7) but caused frank vasoconstriction in arterioles denuded of endothelium (-73 +/- 8%, n = 7). ACh markedly increased the dichlorofluorescein fluorescence in intact arterioles in the presence of nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase inhibitors compared with control and compared with catalase-treated microvessels (363.6 +/- 49, 218.8 +/- 10.6, 221.9 +/- 27.9, respectively, P < 0.05 ANOVA, n = 5 arbitrary units). No changes in the dichlorofluorescein fluorescence were recorded in vessels treated with ACh alone. These results indicate that endothelial production of H(2)O(2) occurs in response to ACh in human gut mucosal arterioles but that H(2)O(2) is not an EDHF in this tissue. Rather, we speculate that it stimulates the release of a chemically distinct EDHF.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21524915>Bioorthogonal proteomics of 15-hexadecynyloxyacetic acid chemical reporter reveals preferential targeting of  acid modified proteins and biosynthetic enzymes.</a></h2><p>Chemical reporters are powerful tools for the detection and discovery of protein modifications following cellular labeling. The metabolism of alkyne- or azide-functionalized chemical reporters in cells can influence the efficiency and specificity of protein targeting. To evaluate the effect of degradation of chemical reporters of protein  acylation, we synthesized 15-hexadecynyloxyacetic acid (HDYOA), a reporter that was designed to be resistant to β-oxidation, and compared its ability to label palmitoylated proteins with an established reporter,  (ODYA). HDYOA was able to label known candidate S-palmitoylated proteins similarly to ODYA. Accordingly, bioorthogonal proteomic analysis demonstrated that 70% of proteins labeled with ODYA were also labeled with HDYOA. However, the proteins observed differentially in our proteomic studies suggested that a portion of ODYA protein labeling is a result of β-oxidation. In contrast, downstream enzymes involved in β-oxidation of   were not targeted by HDYOA. Since HDYOA can label S-palmitoylated proteins and is not utilized by downstream β-oxidation pathways, this  acid chemical reporter may be particularly useful for bioorthogonal proteomic studies in cell types metabolically skewed toward  acid breakdown.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
