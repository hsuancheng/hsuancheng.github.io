Strain H4420N was cultured for 6 h in Luria-Bertani broth amended with individual fatty acids at 20 mmol/L, with pH adjusted to 7.0, 4.3, or 2.5. None of the fatty acids exhibited bactericidal activity at pH 7.0 (p >0.05). At pH 4.3, only capric, lauric, and linoleic acids reduced viability of H4420N (p < 0.05). At pH 2.5, oleic (C18:1) and linolenic (C18:3) acids had modest effects on H4420N viability, whereas capric (C10:0), lauric (C12:0), and linoleic (C18:2) acids resulted in a reduction > or =5 log10 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL (p < 0.05). Capric and lauric acids were examined further at pH 2.5 over a range of concentrations (0.15-20 mmol/L). After 10 min of exposure, 5 log10 CFU/mL reductions (p < 0.05) were achieved by lauric  at 2.5 mmol/L and by capric  at 0.31 mmol/L.  stress increased the sensitivity of -tolerant E. coli O157:H7 strain H4420N to fatty acids. Including sources of these fatty acids in diets for cattle might impair the ability of this zoonotic pathogen to survive passage through the stomach, possibly reducing the potential for its  in the lower gut.</p><p>Keyword: colonization</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17706732>Metabolite profiling of mycorrhizal roots of Medicago truncatula.</a></h2><p>Metabolite profiling of soluble primary and secondary metabolites, as well as cell wall-bound phenolic compounds from roots of barrel medic (Medicago truncatula) was carried out by GC-MS, HPLC and LC-MS. These analyses revealed a number of metabolic characteristics over 56 days of symbiotic interaction with the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Glomus intraradices, when compared to the controls, i.e. nonmycorrhizal roots supplied with low and high amounts of phosphate. During the most active stages of overall root mycorrhization, elevated levels of certain amino acids (Glu, Asp, Asn) were observed accompanied by increases in amounts of some fatty acids ( and oleic acids), indicating a mycorrhiza-specific activation of plastidial metabolism. In addition, some accumulating fungus-specific fatty acids (palmitvaccenic and vaccenic acids) were assigned that may be used as markers of fungal root . Stimulation of the biosynthesis of some constitutive isoflavonoids (daidzein, ononin and malonylononin) occurred, however, only at late stages of root mycorrhization. Increase of the levels of saponins correlated AM-independently with plant growth. Only in AM roots was the accumulation of apocarotenoids (cyclohexenone and mycorradicin derivatives) observed. The structures of the unknown cyclohexenone derivatives were identified by spectroscopic methods as glucosides of blumenol C and 13-hydroxyblumenol C and their corresponding malonyl conjugates. During mycorrhization, the levels of typical cell wall-bound phenolics (e.g. 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillin, ferulic ) did not change; however, high amounts of cell wall-bound tyrosol were exclusively detected in AM roots. Principal component analyses of nonpolar primary and secondary metabolites clearly separated AM roots from those of the controls, which was confirmed by an hierarchical cluster analysis. Circular networks of primary nonpolar metabolites showed stronger and more frequent correlations between metabolites in the mycorrhizal roots. The same trend, but to a lesser extent, was observed in nonmycorrhizal roots supplied with high amounts of phosphate. These results indicate a tighter control of primary metabolism in AM roots compared to control plants. Network correlation analyses revealed distinct clusters of amino acids and sugars/aliphatic acids with strong metabolic correlations among one another in all plants analyzed; however, mycorrhizal symbiosis reduced the cluster separation and enlarged the sugar cluster size. The amino  clusters represent groups of metabolites with strong correlations among one another (cliques) that are differently composed in mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal roots. In conclusion, the present work shows for the first time that there are clear differences in development- and symbiosis-dependent primary and secondary metabolism of M. truncatula roots.</p><p>Keyword: colonization</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16205069>Deficient production of hexadecenoic  in the skin is associated in part with the vulnerability of atopic dermatitis patients to  by Staphylococcus aureus.</a></h2><p>As one of the major skin fatty acids, cis-6-hexadecenoic  (C16:1Delta6) exhibits a specific antibacterial activity and might play a specific role in the defense mechanism against Staphylococcus aureus, in healthy subjects whereas S. aureus frequently colonizes the skin of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD).Fatty  composition of sebum at the recovery level was analyzed by gas chromatography and S. aureus colonizing the skin was assessed by the 'cup-scrub' method (9 patients and 10 healthy controls). To evaluate in vivo effect of C16:1Delta6 on , C16:1Delta6 was applied for 2 weeks on the upper arm skin of another group of AD patients (11 patients).Analysis of sebum lipids revealed that there is a significant lower free C16:1Delta6 content in nonlesional skin from AD patients compared with healthy controls. This lower content is also accompanied by a significantly lower level of C16:1Delta6 in the total fatty  composition of sebum (analyzed following hydrolysis). The lower level of free C16:1Delta6 correlated significantly (R(2) = 0.41, p < 0.01) with the numbers of S. aureus colonizing nonlesional skin. Topical application of free C16:1Delta6 on the skin of AD patients for 2 weeks abolished the markedly increased bacterial count in 6 out of the 8 AD patients tested.Free C16:1Delta6 may be involved in the defense mechanism against S. aureus in healthy skin and this deficit triggers the susceptibility of the skin to  by S. aureus in AD.Copyright 2005 S.

Outer membrane protein (OMP) G1a is an approximately 29-kDa surface lipoprotein and is a potential vaccine candidate. The gene that encodes OMP G1a was expressed and purified using a novel plasmid vector. [(3)H] labeling demonstrated that both native and recombinant OMP G1a contain covalently bound . To assess the expression of OMP G1a during human infection, paired sera and sputum supernatants from adults with COPD followed prospectively were studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays with recombinant lipidated OMP G1a to detect antibodies made specifically during carriage of M. catarrhalis. Overall, 23% of patients developed either a serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) response (9%) or sputum IgA response (21%) to OMP G1a, following 100 episodes of acquisition and clearance of M. catarrhalis. Patients developed antibody responses at similar rates following episodes of clinical exacerbation compared to asymptomatic . Serum IgG antibodies following natural infection were directed predominantly at OMP G1a epitopes that are not exposed on the bacterial surface. These data show that OMP G1a is expressed during infection of the human respiratory tract and is a target of systemic and mucosal antibodies. These observations indicate that OMP G1a, a highly conserved surface protein, should be evaluated further as a vaccine candidate.</p><p>Keyword: colonization</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28887169>In vitro and in vivo exploration of  from Synechococcus elongatus as an antibiofilm agent on the survival of Artemia franciscana against virulent vibrios.</a></h2><p>Biofilm formation of Vibrio spp. has been demonstrated as a potentially important mechanism contributing antibiotic treatment failure in aquaculture. In the present study, the effect of  (PA) identified from Synechococcus elongatus was assessed for the inhibition of quorum sensing (QS) regulated biofilm formation in aquatic bacterial pathogens. The biofilm inhibitory concentration (BIC) of PA against Vibrio spp. was found to be 100µgml. In this concentration, PA exhibited a significant inhibition in biofilm biomass of Vibrio harveyi MTCC 3438, V. parahaemolyticus ATCC 17802, V. vulnificus MTCC 1145 and V. alginolyticus ATCC 17749 without hindering their planktonic growth. Also, PA displayed gradual decrease in bioluminescence production of V. harveyi. The results of extracellular polymeric substances quantification, microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic (FT-IR) analyses suggested that PA positively interferes with the initial adhesion stages of biofilm formation. In addition, confocal and scanning electron microscopic analysis substantiates the antibiofilm efficacy of the PA. The transcriptomic analysis revealed the down-regulation of QS mediated response regulator genes expression in V. harveyi. Concomitantly, PA reduced the intestinal  of vibrios in brine shrimp larvae and thereby attenuates the biofilm assemblage and its associated virulence. In vivo studies using brine shrimp larvae manifested the reduction in adherence and virulence, which prompts further investigation about the potential of PA for the treatment of vibriosis.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, their consistency in heterogeneous soil and diverse ecological settings is unclear. The current study presents in vitro and field evaluation of pre-characterized PGPR strain Enterobacter sp. Fs-11 (GenBank accession # GQ179978) in terms of its potential to enhance sunflower yield and oil contents under diverse environmental conditions. Under in vitro conditions, strain Fs-11 showed optimal growth at a range of temperature (15 to 40 °C) and pH values (6.5 to 8.5). Extracellular and intracellular localizations of the strain Fs-11 in sunflower root cortical cells through transmission electron microscopy confirmed its epiphytic and endophytic  patterns, respectively. In field experiments, conducted at three different agro-climatic locations, inoculation of strain Fs-11 at 50% reduced NP fertilizer resulted in a significant increase in growth, achene yield, nutrient uptake, and oil contents. Inoculation also responded significantly in terms of increase in mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids (oleic and linoleic acids, respectively) without rising saturated fatty  ( and stearic acids) contents. We concluded that Enterobacter sp. Fs-11 is a potential candidate for biofertilizer formulations to supplement chemical fertilizer requirements of sunflower crop under diverse climatic conditions.</p><p>Keyword: colonization</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6328866>Hydrophobicity of cultured mammalian cells and some effects of bacterial phospholipases C.</a></h2><p>Eucaryotic cell surface hydrophobicity was measured as a partition of  between the cell surface and the surrounding buffer.

The effects of Ca and Mg ions on cell hydrophobicity and stability of mouse myeloma (SP2/O) cells and of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were determined. This system permits measurement of changes in cell hydrophobicity caused by various additives, e.g. ions, purified bacterial products, antibiotics or cytostatics. Studies were made on these eucaryotic cells treated with purified bacterial phospholipases C from S. aureus and C. perfringens. These enzymes were found to increase the eucaryotic cell membrane hydrophobicity. This finding might indicate that bacterial phospholipases C facilitate bacterial  at the start of an infection.</p><p>Keyword: colonization</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24709265>Bactericidal activity of the human skin fatty  cis-6-hexadecanoic  on Staphylococcus aureus.</a></h2><p>Human skin fatty acids are a potent aspect of our innate defenses, giving surface protection against potentially invasive organisms. They provide an important parameter in determining the ecology of the skin microflora, and alterations can lead to increased  by pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus. Harnessing skin fatty acids may also give a new avenue of exploration in the generation of control measures against drug-resistant organisms. Despite their importance, the mechanism(s) whereby skin fatty acids kill bacteria has remained largely elusive. Here, we describe an analysis of the bactericidal effects of the major human skin fatty  cis-6-hexadecenoic  (C6H) on the human commensal and pathogen S. aureus. Several C6H concentration-dependent mechanisms were found. At high concentrations, C6H swiftly kills cells associated with a general loss of membrane integrity. However, C6H still kills at lower concentrations, acting through disruption of the proton motive force, an increase in membrane fluidity, and its effects on electron transfer. The design of analogues with altered bactericidal effects has begun to determine the structural constraints on activity and paves the way for the rational design of new antistaphylococcal agents.Copyright © 2014 Cartron et al.</p><p>Keyword: colonization</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15797604>Lipid metabolism in arbuscular mycorrhizal roots of Medicago truncatula.</a></h2><p>The peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, common to all eukaryotes, is mostly catalyzed by members of the lipoxygenase enzyme family of non-heme iron containing dioxygenases. Lipoxygenase products can be metabolized further in the oxylipin pathway by several groups of CYP74 enzymes. One prominent oxylipin is jasmonic  (JA), a product of the 13-allene oxide synthase branch of the pathway and known as signaling substance that plays a role in vegetative and propagative plant development as well as in plant responses to wounding and pathogen attack. In barley roots, JA level increases upon  by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Apart from this first result regarding JA, no information is available on the relevance of lipidperoxide metabolism in arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. Thus we analyzed fatty  and lipidperoxide patterns in roots of Medicago truncatula during mycorrhizal . Levels of fungus-specific fatty acids as well as  (16:0) and oleic  (18:1 n - 9) were increased in mycorrhizal roots. Thus the degree of arbuscular mycorrhizal  of roots can be estimated via analysis of fungal specific esterified fatty acids. Otherwise, no significant changes were found in the profiles of esterified and free fatty acids. The 9- and 13-LOX products of linoleic and alpha-linolenic  were present in all root samples, but did not show significant differences between mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal roots, except JA which showed elevated levels in mycorrhizal roots. In both types of roots levels of 13-LOX products were higher than those of 9-LOX products. In addition, three cDNAs encoding CYP74 enzymes, two 9/13-hydroperoxide lyases and a 13-allene oxide synthase, were isolated and characterized. The transcript accumulation of these three genes, however, was not increased in mycorrhizal roots of M. truncatula.</p><p>Keyword: colonization</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30373090>Phytoremediation assisted by mycorrhizal fungi of a Mexican defunct lead- battery recycling site.</a></h2><p>A field experiment was conducted during 15 months to study the effects of four arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on the growth of Ricinus communis accession SF7. Plants were established on amended soil (vermicompost:sawdust:soil 1:1:1) severely polluted by lead- batteries (LAB) located at Mexico State, Mexico. Plants inoculated with Acaulospora sp., Funneliformis mosseae and Gigaspora gigantea had 100% survival in comparison to non-inoculated plants (57%). These same AMF enhanced  and linoleic acids content in seeds of R. communis. Acaulospora sp. modified rhizosphere soil pH and decreased 3.5 folds Pb foliar concentrations while F. mosseae BEG25 decreased three times Pb soil availability in comparison to non-inoculated plants. Spatial changes in Pb soil availability were observed at the end of this research. No fungal effect on P, Ca, Cu foliar concentrations, soluble sugars, proline, chlorophyll or on the activity of two oxidative stress enzymes was observed. Mycorrhizal  from the inoculated fungi was between 40% and 60%, while  by native fungi was between 16% and 22%. A similar percentage of foliar total phenolic compounds was observed in non-mycorrhizal plants and those inoculated with G. gigantea and Acaulospora sp. This is the first research reporting effects of AMF on R. communis (castor bean) shrubs when grown on a LAB recycling site suggesting the use of Acaulospora sp. and F. mosseae BEG25 in phytostabilization to ameliorate Pb pollution and decreasing its ecological risk.Copyright © 2018.

The aim of this study was to develop new anti-infective coatings of surgical sutures and to compare the anti-microbial effectiveness and biocompatibility to the well-established Vicryl Plus. Synthetic absorbable PGA surgical sutures were coated with three different chlorhexidine concentrations and two different octenidine concentrations in combination with  and lauric . Drug-release kinetics lasting 96 h were studied in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 degrees C. Anti-infective characteristics were determined by measuring the change in optical density of Staphylococcus aureus suspensions charged with coated sutures over time. Microorganisms adsorbed at the surface of coated sutures were assessed on blood agar plates and coated sutures eluted for 24 h were placed on bacterial lawns cultured on Mueller-Hinton plates to prove retained anti-microbial potency. A cell proliferation assay was performed to assess the degree of cytotoxicity. Anti-infective characteristics and biocompatibility were compared to Vicryl Plus. A coating technology for slow-release drug-delivery systems on surgical sutures could be developed. All coatings showed a continuous drug release within 96 h. Individual chlorhexidine and octenidine coated sutures showed superior anti-infective characteristics but inferior biocompatibility in comparison to Vicryl Plus. We conclude that the developed anti-infective suture coatings consisting of lipid-based drug-delivery systems in combination with antiseptics are highly effective against bacterial  in vitro; however, drug doses have to be adjusted to improve biocompatibility.</p><p>Keyword: colonization</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2000374>ToxR regulates the production of lipoproteins and the expression of serum resistance in Vibrio cholerae.</a></h2><p>The genes encoding three lipoproteins of Vibrio cholerae were identified by a combination of DNA sequence analysis and [3H]palmitate labeling of hybrid proteins encoded by TnphoA gene fusions. The expression of these three lipoproteins, TagA, AcfD, and TcpC, was controlled by ToxR, the cholera toxin transcriptional activator. The involvement of other bacterial lipoproteins in conferring resistance to the bactericidal effects of complement prompted us to examine this possibility in V. cholerae. Remarkably, mutations in toxR and tcp genes (including tcpC), involved in the biogenesis of the toxin coregulated pili, rendered V. cholerae about 10(4)-10(6) times more sensitive to the vibriocidal activity of antibody and complement. Since V. cholerae is a noninvasive organism and toxR and tcp mutants are highly defective in intestinal  in animals and humans, these results raise the possibility that resistance to a gut-associated, "complement-like" bactericidal activity may be a major virulence determinant of V. cholerae and other enterobacterial species.</p><p>Keyword: colonization</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/236356>Cell membrane-binding properties of group A streptococcal lipoteichoic .</a></h2><p>Lipoteichoic  (LTA) was extracted from group A streptococci, previously treated with hot HCl, by the phenol method. The extracted LTA was loaded on an isoelectric (IE) focusing column and two fractions were collected; one at pH 4.65 and the other at pH 2.95. Chemical analysis demonstrated that the unfractionated LTA contained alanine and glycerolphosphate at molar ratio of 1:10, and ester-linked lipids, but no detectable sugars or amino-sugars. The two IE fractions contained lipids but lacked alanine. The LTA and its IE fractions spontaneously adsorbed to human erythrocytes (sensitization) causing them to agglutinate in the presence of rabbit anti-LTA. The RBC-sensitizing and antigenic activities of IE fractions were equal to, or greater (for IE fraction at pH 4.65) than the unfractionated LTA, indicating that alanine is not involved in the sensitizing activity of LTA. Mild ammonia-hydrolysis abolished the RBC-sensitizing activity of LTA and its IE fractions. Chloroform-methanol-soluble material of the ammonia-hydrolysate lacked antigenic activity but blocked sensitization of erythrocytes by LTA. The water-soluble material of the hydrolyzed LTA retained antigenic activity, was not able to block sensitization by LTA, and its sensitizing activity was restored after esterification with fatty acids. These experiments indicate that ester-linked fatty acids ( being the major one) are involved in the spontaneous adsorption of LTA to erythrocytes. The LTA, its lipid moiety, and anti-LTA blocked adherence of group A streptococci to human epithelial cells, suggesting that small amounts of LTA may reside on the streptococcal surface to mediate attachment and  of these organisms on mucosal surfaces in vivo.</p><p>Keyword: colonization</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1339408>Adherence, coaggregation, and hydrophobicity of Streptococcus gordonii associated with expression of cell surface lipoproteins.</a></h2><p>Streptococcus gordonii Challis incorporated exogenous [3H]palmitate into 13 polypeptides extractable from intact cells with sodium dodecyl sulfate.

Pseudofactin II is a novel compound identified as cyclic lipopeptide with a  connected to the terminal amino group of eighth amino  in peptide moiety. The C-terminal carboxylic group of the last amino  forms a lactone with the hydroxyl of Thr3. Adhesion is the first stage of biofilm formation and the best moment for the action of antiadhesive and anti-biofilm compounds. Adsorption of biosurfactants to a surface e.g. glass, polystyrene, silicone modifies its hydrophobicity, interfering with the microbial adhesion and desorption processes. In this study the role and applications of pseudofactin II as a antiadhesive compound has been investigated from medicinal and therapeutic perspectives.Pseudofactin II lowered the adhesion to three types of surfaces (glass, polystyrene and silicone) of bacterial strains of five species: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus hirae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis and two Candida albicans strains. Pretreatment of a polystyrene surface with 0.5 mg/ml pseudofactin II inhibited bacterial adhesion by 36-90% and that of C. albicans by 92-99%. The same concentration of pseudofactin II dislodged 26-70% of preexisting biofilms grown on previously untreated surfaces. Pseudofactin II also caused a marked inhibition of the initial adhesion of E. faecalis, E. coli, E. hirae and C. albicans strains to silicone urethral catheters. The highest concentration tested (0.5 mg/ml) caused a total growth inhibition of S. epidermidis, partial (18-37%) inhibition of other bacteria and 8-9% inhibition of C. albicans growth.Pseudofactin II showed antiadhesive activity against several pathogenic microorganisms which are potential biofilm formers on catheters, implants and internal prostheses. Up to 99% prevention could be achieved by 0.5 mg/ml pseudofactin II. In addition, pseudofactin II dispersed preformed biofilms.
