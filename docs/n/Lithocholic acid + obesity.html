Dyslipidemia and its related disorders, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD),  and other metabolic diseases, are of increasing public health concern due to their increasing prevalence in the population. Besides their well-characterized functions in cholesterol homoeostasis and nutrient absorption, bile acids are also important metabolic regulators and function as signaling hormones by activating specific nuclear receptors, G-protein coupled receptors, and multiple signaling pathways. Recent studies identified a new signaling pathway by which conjugated bile acids (CBA) activate the extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK1/2) and protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway via sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2). CBA-induced activation of S1PR2 is a key regulator of sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2) and hepatic gene expression. This review focuses on recent findings related to the role of bile acids/S1PR2-mediated signaling pathways in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28978875>Agaro-Oligosaccharides Regulate Gut Microbiota and Adipose Tissue Accumulation in Mice.</a></h2><p>Gut microbiota are deeply associated with the prevalence of . Agarose is hydrolyzed easily to yield oligosaccharides, designated as agaro-oligosaccharides (AGO). This study evaluated the effects of AGO on obese phenotype and gut microbial composition in mice. Mice were administered AGO in drinking water (AGO-receiving mice). 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyses revealed their fecal microbiota profiles. Serum bile acids were ascertained using a LC-MS/MS system. Compared to the control group, AGO administration significantly reduced epididymal adipose tissue weights and serum non-esterified fatty  concentrations, but the cecal content weights were increased. Data from the serum bile  profile show that concentrations of primary bile acids (cholic  and chenodeoxycholic ), but not those of secondary bile acids (deoxycholic , , and ursodeoxycholic ), tended to increase in AGO-receiving mice. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyses showed that the relative abundances of 15 taxa differed significantly in AGO-receiving mice. Of these, the relative abundances of Rikenellaceae and Lachnospiraceae were found to be positively correlated with epididymal adipose tissue weight. The relative abundances of Bacteroides and Ruminococcus were correlated negatively with epididymal adipose tissue weight. Although the definitive role of gut microbes of AGO-received mice is still unknown, our data demonstrate the possibility that AGO administration affects the gut microbial composition and inhibits  in mice.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/947599>Lipid composition of bile in morbid  before and after jejunoileal bypass surgery.</a></h2><p>Bile cholesterol, phospholipids, total bile acids, individual bile acids, and fatty  compositions of bile neutral lipids and phospholipids were analyzed before, at one month and at six months following jejunoileal bypass surgery in a series of morbidly obese patients. Preoperative mole percentages of cholesterol and lithogenic indices were high, indicating that biles were supersaturated with cholesterol and outside the micellar solubility zone when plotted on triangular coordinates.

However, an increase in the production of secondary BA modulates the intestinal microbiota due to the bactericidal effects and promotes cancer risk in the liver and colon. The ingestion of Bacillus coagulans improves constipation via the activation of bowel movement to promote defaecation in humans, which may alter BA metabolism in the intestinal contents. BA secretion is promoted with high-fat diet consumption, and the ratio of cholic  (CA):chenodeoxycholic  in primary BA increases with ageing. The dietary supplementation of CA mimics the BA environment in diet-induced  and ageing. We investigated whether B. coagulans lilac-01 and soya pulp influence both BA metabolism and the maintenance of host health in CA-supplemented diet-fed rats. In CA-fed rats, soya pulp significantly increased the production of secondary BA such as deoxycholic  and ω-muricholic acids, and soya pulp ingestion alleviated problems related to plasma adiponectin and gut permeability in rats fed the CA diet. The combination of B. coagulans and soya pulp successfully suppressed the increased production of secondary BA in CA-fed rats compared with soya pulp itself, without impairing the beneficial effects of soya pulp ingestion. In conclusion, it is possible that a combination of prebiotics and probiotics can be used to avoid an unnecessary increase in the production of secondary BA in the large intestine without impairing the beneficial functions of prebiotics.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069691>Serum Bile  Levels Before and After Sleeve Gastrectomy and Their Correlation with -Related Comorbidities.</a></h2><p>The rising prevalence of morbid  is increasing the demand for bariatric surgery. The benefits observed after bariatric surgery seems to be not fully explained by surgery-induced weight loss or traditional cardiovascular risk factors regression or improvement. Some evidences suggest that bile  (BA) levels change after bariatric surgery, thus suggesting that BA concentrations could influence some of the metabolic improvement induced by bariatric surgery. In this report, we have characterized circulating BA patterns and compared them to metabolic and vascular parameters before and after sleeve gastrectomy (SG).Seventy-nine subjects (27 males, 52 females, aged 45 ± 12 years, mean BMI 45 ± 7 kg/m) SG candidates were included in the study. Before and about 12 months after SG, all subjects underwent a clinical examination, blood tests (including lipid profile, plasma glucose and insulin, both used for calculating HOMA-IR, and glycated hemoglobin), ultrasound visceral fat area estimation, ultrasound flow-mediated dilation evaluation, and determination of plasma BA concentrations.Before SG, both primary and secondary BA levels were higher in insulin-resistant obese subjects than in non-insulin resistant obese, and BA were positively associated with the markers of insulin-resistance. After SG, total (conjugated and unconjugated) cholic acids significantly decreased (p 0.007), and total  acids significantly increased (p 0.017). SG-induced total cholic and chenodeoxycholic  changes were directly associated with surgery-induced glycemia (p 0.011 and 0.033 respectively) and HOMA-IR (p 0.016 and 0.012 respectively) changes.Serum BA are associated with glucose metabolism and particularly with markers of insulin-resistance. SG modifies circulating BA pool size and composition. SG-induced BA changes are associated with insulin-resistance amelioration. In conclusion, an interplay between glucose metabolism and circulating BA exists but further studies are needed.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/831436>Fecal fat, bile , and sterol excretion abd biliary lipid changes in jejunoileostomy patients.</a></h2><p>Fecal fat, bile , and neutral sterol excretion and biliary bile , phospholipid, and cholesterol were studied in 36 patients 6 to 12 months after jejunoileostomy for .

At the end of intervention, serum and hepatic cholesterol, triglyceride levels, hepatic gene expression of key regulators of cholesterol and lipid metabolism as well as fecal cholesterol and bile  excretion were determined.Dietary supplementation of the HF/HS diet with PomX and inulin decreased hepatic and serum total cholesterol. Supplementation with PomX and inulin together resulted in lower hepatic and serum total cholesterol compared to individual treatments. Compared to HF/HS control, PomX increased gene expression of Cyp7a1 and Cyp7b1, key regulators of bile  synthesis pathways. Inulin decreased gene expression of key regulators of cholesterol de novo synthesis Srebf2 and Hmgcr and significantly increased fecal elimination of total bile acids and neutral sterols. Only PomX in combination with inulin reduced liver and lipid weight significantly compared to the HF/HS control group. PomX showed a trend to decrease liver triglyceride (TG) levels, while inulin or PomX-inulin combination had no effect on either serum or liver TG levels.Dietary PomX and inulin supplementation decreased hepatic and serum total cholesterol by different mechanisms and the combination leading to a significant enhancement of the cholesterol-lowering effect.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The objective of the present study was to investigate whether the type and level of fiber had an effect on cecal BA composition when included in low- and high-fat diets. Groups of rats were fed two barley varieties, which resulted in three test diets containing three levels of β-glucans and two levels of dietary fiber. BAs were preconcentrated using hollow fiber liquid-phase microextraction and quantified by gas chromatography. The amount of the secondary BAs, -, deoxycholic- and hyodexycholic acids was generally higher in groups fed high-fat diets compared with corresponding acids in groups fed low-fat diets (P<.05). In contrast, most of the primary and the secondary BAs, ursodeoxycholic  and β- and ω-muricholic acids, were two to five times higher (P<.05) in groups fed low-fat diets than in groups fed high-fat diets. This was particularly true for groups fed the highest level of β-glucans and in some cases also the medium level. The BA profile in the gut was strongly dependent on the amount and type of dietary fiber in the diet, which may be useful in the prevention/treatment of diseases associated with changes in BA profiles.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

However, the implication of these mechanisms is unclear because of the low bioavailability of BBR. Because the main action site of BBR is the gut and intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of lipid metabolism, we hypothesized that the effects of BBR on intestinal FXR signaling pathway might account for its pharmacological effectiveness. Using wild type (WT) and intestine-specific FXR knockout (FXR) mice, we found that BBR prevented the development of high-fat-diet-induced  and ameliorated triglyceride accumulation in livers of WT, but not FXR mice. BBR increased conjugated bile acids in serum and their excretion in feces. Furthermore, BBR inhibited bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity in gut microbiota, and significantly increased the levels of tauro-conjugated bile acids, especially tauro-cholic (TCA), in the intestine. Both BBR and TCA treatment activated the intestinal FXR pathway and reduced the expression of fatty- translocase Cd36 in the liver. These results indicate that BBR may exert its lipid-lowering effect primarily in the gut by modulating the turnover of bile acids and subsequently the ileal FXR signaling pathway. In summary, we provide the first evidence to suggest a new mechanism of BBR action in the intestine that involves, sequentially, inhibiting BSH, elevating TCA, and activating FXR, which lead to the suppression of hepatic expression of Cd36 that results in reduced uptake of long-chain fatty acids in the liver.Copyright © 2016 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605678>Parabacteroides distasonis Alleviates  and Metabolic Dysfunctions via Production of Succinate and Secondary Bile Acids.</a></h2><p>We demonstrated the metabolic benefits of Parabacteroides distasonis (PD) on decreasing weight gain, hyperglycemia, and hepatic steatosis in ob/ob and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice.

We tested the novel hypothesis that naturally occurring bile acids interfere with protein-mediated hepatic long chain free fatty  (LCFA) uptake. To this end, stable cell lines expressing fatty  transporters as well as primary hepatocytes from mouse and human livers were incubated with primary and secondary bile acids to determine their effects on LCFA uptake rates. We identified ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) and deoxycholic  (DCA) as the two most potent inhibitors of the liver-specific fatty  transport protein 5 (FATP5). Both UDCA and DCA were able to inhibit LCFA uptake by primary hepatocytes in a FATP5-dependent manner. Subsequently, mice were treated with these secondary bile acids in vivo to assess their ability to inhibit diet-induced hepatic triglyceride accumulation. Administration of DCA in vivo via injection or as part of a high-fat diet significantly inhibited hepatic fatty  uptake and reduced liver triglycerides by more than 50%.The data demonstrate a novel role for specific bile acids, and the secondary bile  DCA in particular, in the regulation of hepatic LCFA uptake. The results illuminate a previously unappreciated means by which specific bile acids, such as UDCA and DCA, can impact hepatic triglyceride metabolism and may lead to novel approaches to combat -associated fatty liver disease.Copyright © 2012 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30303767>Prevention of Cell Growth by Suppression of Villin Expression in -Stimulated HepG2 Cells.</a></h2><p>Cholestasis is a condition wherein bile flow is interrupted and  is known to play a key role in causing severe liver injury.

The cause of elevations of serum transaminase in 25% of humans ingesting CDC, however, is unknown, but also may be due to LC. Because efficient hepatic sulfation of LC may protect against hepatic injury, the aim of this study was to determine if sulfation of LC might modify CDC-induced elevations of transaminase. Pretreatment sulfation fraction (SF) was estimated in 63 randomly selected patients with gallstones in a double-blind randomized trial of CDC, 750 mg/d, 375 mg/d, or placebo; in 27 of these, SF was repeated at 1 or 2 yr. In four other patients, the SF was measured at 2 yr only. Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase were determined monthly for 3 mo and then every 3 or 4 mo; an elevation of transaminase was defined as > 150% of the normal upper limit in asymptomatic patients. 10 muCi of (3)H-glyco-LC (sp act 84 mCi/mol) was ingested 10-12 h before fasting duodenal biliary drainage. Bile acids in bile were separated by thin-layer chromatography. The SF was estimated as a percentage of total radioactivity (scintillation counting) in sulfated glyco-LC. The standard deviation for replicate SF determinations (n = 311) was 2.1% The pretreatment SF (mean 60.7+/-1.7 SEM) correlated inversely with age (r = 0.336, P < 0.005) and directly with the  index (r = 0.495, P > 0.001), but was independent of sex. The SF, remeasured at 1 or 2 yr, did not change significantly with time or CDC. Among CDC-treated patients, elevations of transaminase occurred in 75% of patients with a SF < 45% vs. 11% with a SF > 45% (P < 0.001). In conclusion, a SF < 45% occurred in patients with gallstones who had a high probability of developing elevated serum transaminase when treated with CDC.

Primary BAs play critical roles in cholesterol metabolism, lipid digestion, and host⁻microbe interaction. Although BAs are reabsorbed via enterohepatic circulation, primary BAs serve as substrates for bacterial biotransformation to secondary BAs in the colon. High-fat diets increase secondary BAs, such as deoxycholic  (DCA) and  (LCA), which are risk factors for colonic inflammation and cancer. In contrast, increased dietary fiber intake is associated with anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. These effects may be due to the increased production of the SCFAs acetate, propionate, and butyrate during dietary fiber fermentation in the colon. Elucidation of the molecular events by which secondary BAs and SCFAs regulate colonic cell proliferation and inflammation will lead to a better understanding of the anticancer potential of dietary fiber in the context of high-fat diet-related colon cancer.

These observations are in accord with our model relating cholesterol metabolism with the metabolism of plasma lipoproteins in man.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20023205>Bile alcohols function as the ligands of membrane-type bile -activated G protein-coupled receptor.</a></h2><p>TGR5 is a G protein-coupled receptor that is activated by bile acids, resulting in an increase in cAMP levels and the subsequent modulation of energy expenditure in brown adipose tissue and muscle. Therefore, the development of a TGR5-specific agonist could lead to the prevention and treatment of various metabolic disorders related to . In the present study, we evaluated the ability of bile alcohols, which are structurally and physiologically similar to bile acids and are produced as the end products of cholesterol catabolism in evolutionarily primitive vertebrates, to act as TGR5 agonists. In a cell-based reporter assay and a cAMP production assay performed in vitro, most bile alcohols with a side chain containing hydroxyl group(s) were highly efficacious agonists for TGR5 comparable to its most potent ligand in the naturally occurring bile , . However, the abilities of the bile alcohols to activate TGR5 varied with the position and number of the hydroxyl substituent in the side chain. Additionally, the conformation of the steroidal nucleus of bile alcohols is also important for its activity as a TGR5 agonist. Thus, we have provided new insights into the structure-activity relationships of bile alcohols as TGR5 agonists.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28594916>Identification of key amino  residues in the hTGR5-nomilin interaction and construction of its binding model.</a></h2><p>TGR5, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, is activated by bile acids. Because TGR5 promotes energy expenditure and improves glucose homeostasis, it is recognized as a key target in treating metabolic diseases. We previously showed that nomilin, a citrus limonoid, activates TGR5 and confers anti- and anti-hyperglycemic effects in mice. Information on the TGR5-nomilin interaction regarding molecular structure, however, has not been reported. In the present study, we found that human TGR5 (hTGR5) shows higher nomilin responsiveness than does mouse TGR5 (mTGR5). Using mouse-human chimeric TGR5, we also found that three amino  residues (Q77ECL1, R80ECL1, and Y893.29) are important in the hTGR5-nomilin interaction. Based on these results, an hTGR5-nomilin binding model was constructed using in silico docking simulation, demonstrating that four hydrophilic hydrogen-bonding interactions occur between nomilin and hTGR5. The binding mode of hTGR5-nomilin is vastly different from those of other TGR5 agonists previously reported, suggesting that TGR5 forms various binding patterns depending on the type of agonist. Our study promotes a better understanding of the structure of TGR5, and it may be useful in developing and screening new TGR5 agonists.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23291748>Burdock fermented by Aspergillus awamori elevates cecal Bifidobacterium, and reduces fecal deoxycholic  and adipose tissue weight in rats fed a high-fat diet.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the effects of dietary supplementation with burdock powder and Aspergillus awamori-fermented burdock powder at 5% on the intestinal luminal environment and body fat in rats fed a high-fat (HF) diet. Food intake and growth were unaffected by dietary manipulation. Consumption of the burdock and fermented burdock diets significantly elevated fecal IgA and mucins (indices of intestinal immune and barrier functions) and reduced fecal  (a risk factor for colon cancer) (p<0.05). The fermented burdock diet markedly elevated cecal Bifidobacterium and organic acids, including lactate, acetate, propionate, and butyrate, and reduced fecal deoxycholic  (a risk factor for colon cancer) and perirenal adipose tissue weight (p<0.05), but the burdock diet did not.

Bile  deconjugation was assessed with the bile  breath test and bile  absorption by analyzing the fecal excretion of both radioactively labeled and unlabeled bile acids. In addition, aerobic and anaerobic cultures of upper small intestinal aspirates, the Schilling vitamin B12 absorption test, and fecal fat analysis were performed. All patients developed marked diarrhea and steatorrhea after JIB. The bile  breath test was positive in all 11 patients after JIB. In 7 of the 11 patients, this test was already slightly positive before JIB. In every instance, however, the bile  breath test became significantly more abnormal after the bypass operation. The fecal excretion of labeled bile acids increased significantly. However, the increase in the quantitative excretion of the bile acids did not reach statistical significance. The concentrations of bile acids in fecal water were considerably below the levels required to induce diarrhea. This was mainly the result of a low fecal pH and consequent low aqueous solubility. Jejunoileal bypass effected a major shift in fecal bile acids from the secondary bile acids,  and deoxycholic , to the respective primary compounds, chenodeoxycholic  and cholic . There were no significant changes in the small bowel bacteriologic findings after JIB. In 5 out of the 9 patients in whom bacteriologic studies were performed, the cultures were positive before the operation. The Schilling vitamin B12 absorption test showed in all patients a significant drop in the 24-hour urinary 57Co excretion rate after JIB.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28769799>Allspice and Clove As Source of Triterpene Acids Activating the G Protein-Coupled Bile  Receptor TGR5.</a></h2><p>Worldwide, metabolic diseases such as  and type 2 diabetes have reached epidemic proportions. A major regulator of metabolic processes that gained interest in recent years is the bile  receptor TGR5 (Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5). This G protein-coupled membrane receptor can be found predominantly in the intestine, where it is mainly responsible for the secretion of the incretins glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY). The aim of this study was (i) to identify plant extracts with TGR5-activating potential, (ii) to narrow down their activity to the responsible constituents, and (iii) to assess whether the intestinal microbiota produces transformed metabolites with a different activity profile. Chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) served as positive control for both, the applied cell-based luciferase reporter gene assay for TGR5 activity and the biotransformation assay using mouse fecal slurry. The suitability of the workflow was demonstrated by the biotransformation of CDCA to  resulting in a distinct increase in TGR5 activity. Based on a traditional Tibetan formula, 19 plant extracts were selected and investigated for TGR5 activation. Extracts from the commonly used spices  (SaroE, clove),  (PdioE, allspice), and  (KgalE, aromatic ginger) significantly increased TGR5 activity. After biotransformation, only KgalE showed significant differences in its metabolite profile, which, however, did not alter its TGR5 activity compared to non-transformed KgalE. UHPLC-HRMS (high-resolution mass spectrometry) analysis revealed triterpene acids (TTAs) as the main constituents of the extracts SaroE and PdioE. Identification and quantification of TTAs in these two extracts as well as comparison of their TGR5 activity with reconstituted TTA mixtures allowed the attribution of the TGR5 activity to TTAs. ECs were determined for the main TTAs, i.e., oleanolic  (2.2 ± 1.6 μM), ursolic  (1.1 ± 0.2 μM), as well as for the hitherto unknown TGR5 activators corosolic  (0.5 ± 1.0 μM) and maslinic  (3.7 ± 0.7 μM). In conclusion, extracts of clove, allspice, and aromatic ginger activate TGR5, which might play a pivotal role in their therapeutic use for the treatment of metabolic diseases. Moreover, the TGR5 activation of SaroE and PdioE could be pinpointed solely to TTAs.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30013964> Workflow for the Discovery of Natural Products Activating the G Protein-Coupled Bile  Receptor 1.</a></h2><p>The G protein-coupled bile  receptor (GPBAR1) has been recognized as a promising new target for the treatment of diverse diseases, including , type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease and atherosclerosis. The identification of novel and potent GPBAR1 agonists is highly relevant, as these diseases are on the rise and pharmacological unmet therapeutic needs are pervasive. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a proficient workflow for the  prediction of GPBAR1 activating compounds, primarily from natural sources. A protocol was set up, starting with a comprehensive collection of structural information of known ligands. This information was used to generate ligand-based pharmacophore models in LigandScout 4.08 Advanced. After theoretical validation, the two most promising models, namely BAMS22 and TTM8, were employed as queries for the virtual screening of natural product and synthetic small molecule databases. Virtual hits were progressed to shape matching experiments and physicochemical clustering. Out of 33 diverse virtual hits subjected to experimental testing using a reporter gene-based assay, two natural products, farnesiferol B () and microlobidene (), were confirmed as GPBAR1 activators reaching more than 50% receptor activation at 20 μM with ECs of 13.53 μM and 13.88 μM, respectively. This activity is comparable to that of the endogenous ligand  (). Seven further virtual hits showed activity reaching at least 15% receptor activation either at 5 or 20 μM, including new scaffolds from natural and synthetic origin.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p></html>
