Our aim was to investigate the potential of α-ionone, a naturally occurring flavoring agent, in preventing muscle atrophy and to delineate the mechanisms involved. We found that α-ionone not only stimulated myogenesis but also attenuated -induced atrophy of cultured skeletal myotubes, as evidenced by an increased myotube diameter and length, fusion index, and cellular protein content. These beneficial actions of α-ionone were abrogated by cAMP inhibitor. The antiatrophic effects of α-ionone on cultured myotubes were confirmed in a corresponding mouse model. The skeletal muscle mass, muscle protein content, myofiber diameter, and muscle strength were greater in α-ionone-treated mice than in untreated animals fed high-fat diet. Furthermore, α-ionone increased cAMP concentration and enhanced its downstream PKA-CREB signaling in skeletal muscle of mice fed high-fat diet. Thus, α-ionone is a promising agent that may enhance skeletal muscle mass and strength.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30759408>Urinary metabolomics for discovering  biomarkers of laryngeal cancer using UPLC-QTOF/MS.</a></h2><p>The incidence of laryngeal cancer (LYC) is second only to lung cancer, which is also the second most common cancer in head and neck cancer. Risk assessment metabolomics biomarkers to diagnose LYC have not been found by now. To profile the metabolites in healthy controls (HCs) and LYC patients (LYCs), urine metabonomics study was performed based on reversed phase liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (RPLC-QTOF/MS). Six urine differentially expressed metabolites (Variable Importance in Projection >1, p <  0.05) were identified by searching reference library or comparing with standard based on OPLS-DA (orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis) model. d-pantothenic , , myristic , oleamide, sphinganine and phytosphingosine were identified as differential metabolites associated with the LYC and they might play roles in sphingolipid , fatty  biosynthesis, fatty  elongation in mitochondria, pantothenate and coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis, beta-Alanine  and fatty  . These six differential metabolites were combined to test the potentiality of diagnosis of LYC. Results revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) value, sensitivity and specificity of receiving operator characteristic (ROC) curve were 0.97, 95% and 97%, respectively, indicating that this diagnosis method could be used to distinguish LYCs from HCs with good sensitivity and specificity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study examines the in vitro effects of ZER on lipid peroxidation in biological systems (cholesterol and phospholipid membrane oxidation) and explores its antitumor action in terms of its ability to modulate cancer cell lipid profile. Evaluation of the antioxidant activity of ZER showed that this compound is unable to trap lipoperoxyl radicals per se. ZER significantly modulated the total lipid and fatty  profiles in cancer cells, inducing marked changes in the phospholipid/cholesterol ratio, with significant decreases in the levels of oleic and  acids and a marked increase of stearic . Cell-based fluorescent measurements of intracellular membranes and lipid droplets using the Nile Red staining technique showed that in cancer cells, ZER induced significant accumulation of cytosolic lipid droplets and altered cell membrane organization/protein dynamics, depolarizing the mitochondrial membranes and inducing apoptosis and alteration of nuclear morphology. The modulatory activity of ZER on the total lipid and fatty  profiles and lipid droplets may therefore represent another possible mechanism of its anticancer properties.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31284614>Overexpression of Acyl-ACP Thioesterases,  and , Induce Distinct Gene Expression Reprogramming in Developing Seeds of .</a></h2><p>We examined the substrate preference of  acyl-ACP thioesterases,  and , and gene expression changes associated with the modification of lipid composition in the seed, using  transgenic plants overexpressing  or  under the control of a seed-specific promoter.  seeds contained a higher level of total saturated fatty  (FA) content, with 4.3 times increase in 16:0 , whereas  seeds showed approximately 3% accumulation of 10:0 and 12:0 medium-chain FAs, and a small increase in other saturated FAs, resulting in higher levels of total saturated FAs.

Mice ( = 10) were fed with HFD for 16 weeks to induce obesity and hepatosteatosis and then divided into two groups: HFD + vehicle group injected with the vehicle solution (saline) and HFD + compound C group injected with compound C in saline (5 mg/kg i.p., once a day) for 4 weeks. Liver histology was observed. The expression levels of genes related to lipid  and proinflammation in liver tissue were examined. NLRP3 inflammasome expression in liver tissue was detected by the western blot assay. HepG2 cells were pretreated with compound C and/or AICAR for 1 h and then treated with  (PA) for 3 h. The cells were collected, and mRNA levels were determined.There was a significant reduction in body-weight gain and daily food intake in the HFD + compound C group compared with the HFD + vehicle group ( < 0.05). The glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT) showed that compound C alleviated insulin resistance. Histology analysis showed a significant reduction of hepatic steatosis by compound C. Compound C also significantly decreased fatty  synthesis genes, while increased fatty  oxidation genes. Furthermore, compound C significantly reduced the expression of proinflammatory markers and NLRP3 inflammasome ( < 0.05). Compound C enhanced mRNA levels of SOD1, SOD2, catalase, GPx1, and GPx4 and reduced the p-AMPK/AMPK ratio, which were stimulated by  (PA).

In the present study, we investigated the relationship between saturated FFAs and IR in GCs by the use of  (PA).

Antisteatotic effects of cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeONPs) have recently been shown in animal models of liver disease. However, it is unclear whether the activity of CeONPs is related solely to the decrease in oxidative stress or, in addition, they directly decrease liver fatty  accumulation.

Cell uptake of CeONPs and their effect on oxidative stress and viability of hepatic cells cultured with HO were also evaluated. Results show that CeONPs were uptaken by HepG2 cells and reduced oxidative stress and improved cell viability. Treatment with oleic and  increased lipogenesis and the content of different fatty acids. CeONPs reduced  and stearic  and most fatty acids consisting of more than 18 carbon atoms. These effects were associated with significant changes in elongase and desaturase activity.

The increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production during glucose  in β cells can be exacerbated under hyperglycaemic conditions such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), thus contributing to β cell function impairment. In the present work, we aimed to evaluate the effect of MitoQ on insulin secretion, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) signalling in a pancreatic β cell line under normoglycaemic (NG, 11.1 mM glucose), hyperglycaemic (HG, 25 mM glucose) and lipidic ( (PA), 0.5mM) conditions.We incubated the pancreatic β cell line INS-1E with or without MitoQ (0.5µM) under NG, HG and PA conditions. We then assessed the following parameters: glucose-induced insulin secretion, O₂ consumption (with a Clark-type electrode); mitochondrial function, oxidative stress parameters and calcium levels (by fluorescence microscopy); ER stress markers and NFκB-p65 protein levels (by western blotting).MitoQ increased insulin secretion and prevented the enhancement of ROS production and O₂ consumption and decrease in GSH levels that are characteristic under HG conditions. MitoQ also reduced protein levels of ER stress markers (GRP78 and P-eIF2α) and the proinflammatory nuclear transcription factor NFκB-p65, both of which increased under HG. MitoQ did not significantly alter ER stress markers under lipidic conditions.Our findings suggest that treatment with MitoQ modulates mitochondrial function, which in turn ameliorates endoplasmic reticulum stress and NFκB activation, thereby representing potential benefits for pancreatic β cell function.© Copyright by the Author(s).

Bacillus lipopeptides had been widely used as biocontrol agents for plant diseases. In this study, we isolated 11 lipopeptide compounds from B. amyloliquefaciens Pc3 culture broth via reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and used matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) to identify these as iturin A (C, C, C, C), fengycin B (C, C, C, C), and surfactin (C, C, C). We further found that the addition of exogenous alkanoic acids, including myristic , pentadecanoic , , heptadecanoic , octadecanoic , and nonadecanoic , to the bacterial growth media could promote lipopeptide production and enhance the antifungal activities of crude lipopeptide extracts from B. amyloliquefaciens Pc3. In addition, the transcriptional levels of three lipopeptide synthesis genes, ituD, fenA, and srfA-A, and two fatty  -related genes, FabI, which encodes enoyl-ACP reductase, and FadB, which encodes enoyl-CoA hydratase, were found to be upregulated in cells grown with exogenous alkanoic acids.

Measures of mitochondrial , as reflected by oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and cytochrome c reduction, calcium signaling, and ISR by rat islets were used to evaluate processes stimulated by acute exposure to  (PA). The contribution of mitochondrial oxidation of PA was determined in the presence and absence of a blocker of mitochondrial transport of fatty acids (etomoxir) at different glucose concentrations. Subsequent to increasing glucose from 3 to 20 mM, PA caused small increases in OCR and cytosolic calcium (about 20% of the effect of glucose). In contrast, the effect of PA on ISR was almost 3 times that by glucose, suggesting that the  of PA is not the dominant mechanism mediating PA's effect on ISR. This was further supported by lack of inhibition of PA-stimulated OCR and ISR when blocking entry of PA into mitochondria (with etomoxir), and PA's lack of stimulation of reduced cytochrome c in the presence of high glucose. Consistent with the lack of  stimulation by PA, an inhibitor of calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum, but not a blocker of L-type calcium channels, abolished the PA-induced elevation of cytosolic calcium. Notably, ISR was unaffected by thapsigargin showing the dissociation of endoplasmic reticulum calcium release and second phase insulin secretion. In conclusion, stimulation of ISR by PA was mediated by mechanisms largely independent of the oxidation of the fuel.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31012550>[Ozone oxidizes oleic fatty  with the highest rate constant and does not oxidize .

However, they largely stimulate adaptive functions of the organism, including the biological function of locomotion, cognitive function and the function of positioning in the environment.

Palmitate treatment increased saturated glycerolipids, accompanied by a transcriptional stress response, including upregulation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. A comprehensive genome-wide short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen identified >350 genes modulating lipotoxicity. Among previously unknown genetic modifiers of lipotoxicity, depletion of RNF213, a putative ubiquitin ligase mutated in Moyamoya vascular disease, protected cells from lipotoxicity. On a broader level, integration of our comprehensive datasets revealed that changes in di-saturated glycerolipids, but not other lipid classes, are central to lipotoxicity in this model.

Emerging evidence highlights the importance of directly elucidating T-cell activation under the obesity-induced  stress condition, as T cells primed under such conditions were found to acquire a unique phenotype and function. Herein, we found a significant upregulation of signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family member 3 (SLAMF3) expression on T cells from T2D patients compared to those of healthy controls. Importantly, SLAMF3 upregulation was associated with an increased ability to produce proinflammatory cytokines. Significantly increased SLAMF3 expression was seen in T2D patient T cells that produce IFN-γ or IL-17 upon short (4-h) stimulation, compared to non-cytokine-producing T cells. In line with this finding, SLAMF3 T cells were significantly more sensitive than SLAMF3 T cells to TCR stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies. Furthermore, treatment with  (PA) led to significant upregulation of SLAMF3 on human T cells primed by anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies and on Jurkat cells, a human T-cell line. RNA sequencing revealed strong activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in T cells that were primed with PA. Further mechanistic studies showed that inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling, or its upstream mediator STAT5 can prevent PA-induced SLAMF3 upregulation on T cells. These results indicate that SLAMF3 upregulation is associated with T-cell activation and cytokine production in T2D patients, and suggest that elevated saturated fatty acids in T2D patients may induce SLAMF3 upregulation on T cells via activation of the STAT5-PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30896878> dependence of cyclosporine A on cell proliferation of human non‑small cell lung cancer A549 cells and its implication in post‑transplant malignancy.</a></h2><p>Cyclosporine A (CsA), a widely used immunosuppressant to prevent organ transplant rejection, is associated with an increased cancer risk following transplantation, particularly in the lung.

CsA treatment increased the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and consequently the expression of Cyclin D1. Inhibiting Akt signaling with the phosphatidylinositol 3‑kinase inhibitor wortmannin prevented this effect.

Recently, the potentially important role of neuro-immune interactions in the development of allergic reactions has been established. Many of the clinical symptoms accompanying allergic airway inflammation are the result of the activation of neurons in the airways, so the attention of researchers is currently focused on neuro-immune interactions, which can play an important role in asthma pathophysiology. A growing number of scientific works confirm that the key molecule in the implementation of these inter-systemic interactions is nerve growth factor (NGF).

Chaperon-mediated autophagy (CMA) triggers lipid droplets (LDs) breakdown, to initiate lipolysis via either cytosolic lipases or macroautophagy. SIRT3, a mitochondrial NAD-dependent deacetylase, regulates the acetylation status and activity of many substrates involving in energy . However, the role of SIRT3 in regulating lipophagy is controversial. The current study showed that SIRT3 expression was decreased and the macroautophagy flux was blocked in the primary hepatocytes from high-fat diet fed mice and P/O ( and oleic  mixture) treated AML12 mouse hepatocytes, compared with the corresponding controls. SIRT3 overexpression promoted macroautophagy in LDs from P/O-treated hepatocytes through activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and unc-51-like kinase 1, to boost LDs digestion. Gain of SIRT3 expression stimulated the formation of lysosome-associated membrane protein 2A (LAMP-2A)-heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein (HSC70)-perilipin-2 (PLN2) complex, to promote CMA process and reduce the stability of LDs in hepatocytes. Moreover, SIRT3 reduced the expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, to suppress lipogenesis. In addition, SIRT3 overexpression promoted LDs dispersion on detyrosinated microtubules, and directly deacetylated long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase to enhance mitochondrial energetics.

Our previous studies found that mangiferin could decrease serum FFA levels in obese rats induced by a high-fat diet. Our research was to determine the effects and mechanism of mangiferin on improving IR by regulating FFA  in HepG2 and C2C12 cells. The model was used to quantify PA-induced lipid accumulation in the two cell lines treated with various concentrations of mangiferin simultaneously for 24 h. We found that mangiferin significantly increased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, via phosphorylation of protein kinase B (P-AKT), glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) protein expressions, and markedly decreased glucose content, respectively, in HepG2 and C2C12 cells induced by PA. Mangiferin significantly increased FFA uptake and decreased intracellular FFA and triglyceride (TG) accumulations. The activity of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR) protein and its downstream proteins involved in fatty  translocase (CD36) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) and the fatty  -oxidation rate corresponding to FFA  were also markedly increased by mangiferin in HepG2 and C2C12 cells. Furthermore, the effects were reversed by siRNA-mediated knockdown of PPAR. Mangiferin ameliorated IR by increasing the consumption of glucose and promoting the FFA oxidation via the PPAR pathway in HepG2 and C2C12 cells.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30866181>Single Cell Oil Production from Undetoxified  L. hydrolysate by .</a></h2><p>The use of low-cost substrates represents one key issue to make single cell oil production sustainable. Among low-input crops, . is a perennial herbaceous rhizomatous grass containing both C5 and C6 carbohydrates. The scope of the present work was to investigate and optimize the production of lipids by the oleaginous yeast  from undetoxified lignocellulosic hydrolysates of steam-pretreated .

Then the bioconversion of undetoxified hydrolysates was investigated. A fed-batch process for the fermentation of  hydrolysates was finally implemented in a 2-L bioreactor. Under optimized conditions, the total lipid content was 64% of the dry cell weight and the lipid yield was 63% of the theoretical. The fatty  profile of  triglycerides contained 27% , 33% oleic  and 32% linoleic .

Fatty acids (FA) of Penaeid shrimps have been largely explored in the literature, and although they are unable to discriminate shrimps geographical origin or species, they might provide an interesting tool to distinguish their production method (wild vs. farmed). The present study is based on a literature compilation of Penaeid shrimp FA profiles encompassing all continents and 28 species. It reveals that the ratio of FA 18:2ω6 + FA 18:3ω3 / FA 16:1ω7 can differentiate wild vs. farmed Penaeid shrimps with 100% accuracy within the 207 FA profiles of the dataset considered. Assuming a normal distribution of the dataset, 94.4% of the farmed shrimps population is expected to exhibit a ratio above 2.92, and 99.7% of the wild shrimps population is expected to fall below 2.92.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

PA in PO is esterified predominantly at the SN-1,3 position of triacylglycerol (TAG), and infant formulas are now available in which a greater proportion of PA is in the SN-2 position (typical configuration in human milk). As there are some concerns about the use of PO, we aimed to review literature on health effects of PO and SN-2-palmitate in infant formulas.PubMed and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were systematically searched for relevant studies on possible beneficial effects or harms of either PO or SN-2-palmitate in infant formula on various health outcomes.We identified 12 relevant studies using PO and 21 studies using SN-2-palmitate. Published studies have variable methodology, subject characteristics, and some are underpowered for the key outcomes. PO is associated with harder stools and SN-2-palmitate use may lead to softer stool consistency. Bone effects seem to be short-lasting. For some outcomes (infant colic, faecal microbiota, lipid ), the number of studies is very limited and summary evidence inconclusive. Growth of infants is not influenced. There are no studies published on the effect on markers of later diseases.There is insufficient evidence to suggest that PO should be avoided as a source of fat in infant formulas for health reasons. Inclusion of high SN-2-palmitate fat blend in infant formulas may have short-term effects on stool consistency but cannot be considered essential.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115809>Comparison of monoculture and mixed culture (Scenedesmus obliquus and wild algae) for C, N, and P removal and lipid production.</a></h2><p>This study compared the efficiency of nutrient removal and lipid accumulation by a monoculture of Scenedesmus obliquus and mixed cultures of microalgae.

In AD hippocampal-dependent episodic memory is one of the first types of memory to be impaired. Previous studies have shown that in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) episodic memory is rapidly but reversibly impaired.In this study we use hippocampal proteomics to investigate the effects of HFD in the hippocampus. Mice were fed either a low-fat diet (LFD) or HFD containing either 10% or 60% (Kcal) from fat for 3 days, 1 week or 2 weeks. One group of mice were fed the HFD for 1 week and then returned to the LFD for a further week. Primary hippocampal cultures were challenged with  (PA), the most common long-chain saturated FA in the Western diet, and with the anti-inflammatory, n-3 polyunsaturated FA, docosahexaenoic  (DHA), or a combination of the two to ascertain effects of these fatty acids on dendritic structure.HFD-induced changes occur in hippocampal proteins involved in , inflammation, cell stress, cell signalling, and the cytoskeleton after 3 days, 1 week and 2 weeks of HFD. Replacement of the HFD after 1 week by a low-fat diet (LFD) for a further week resulted in partial recovery of the hippocampal proteome. Microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), one of the earliest proteins changed, was used to investigate the impact of fatty acids (FAs) on hippocampal neuronal morphology. PA challenge resulted in shorter and less arborised dendrites while DHA had no effect when applied alone but counteracted the effects of PA when FAs were used in combination. Dendritic morphology recovered when PA was removed from the cell culture media.This study provides evidence for the rapid and reversible effects of diet on the hippocampal proteome and the impact of PA and DHA on dendritic structure.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31051454>Green preparation of seaweed-based silver nano-liquid for cotton pathogenic fungi management.</a></h2><p>Silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were synthesised using the crude ethyl acetate extracts of  and evaluated their bioefficacy against two crop-damaging pathogens.

Preclinical studies on recently discovered classes of lipids - fatty  esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFA) have revealed their anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing potential. The FAHFA levels are significantly decreased in insulin-resistant individuals, their application exhibited anti-inflammatory effects and restoring the glucose-insulin homeostasis. The aim of our research was to analyze the overall FAHFA composition in a common diet, as only a partial FAHFA composition has been revealed so far (only the PAHSA subclass was analyzed in a few foods). A new approach to the FAHFAs analysis includes nano-LC and post-column modifier followed by negative ion mass spectrometry, in order to obtain maximum sensitivity. Analysis of different foods - oat (whole grain, coarse flakes and fine flakes), apple, clementine, lemon, strawberry, blueberry, mango, kiwi, avocado, pineapple, banana, onion, garlic, cherry tomato, carrot, parsley root, pepper and radish - exhibited wide inter-food variation in the FAHFA profiles. Sixteen analyzed FAHFAs (, oleic, palmitoleic and stearic hydroxy-esters) showed microgram to low nanogram levels (0.165 ng/g - 32 μg/g FW), with the highest abundancy in oat, clementine, garlic and pineapple. Stearic  hydroxy stearic  (SAHSA) was the most abundant FAHFA, especially in the food with antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and beneficial  effects. In contrary, the PAHSA - previously proven to have the strongest antihyperglycemic and insulin-sensitizing effects, was not present in some foods (radish, avocado, mango, lemon, cherry tomato, kiwi).

Here, we studied the relative proportions of FA in a mammal with extreme changes in  rates. Common noctule bats (Nyctalus noctula) switch from energetically demanding long-distance migration at high  rates to regular torpor with extremely low  rates. We found that composition of FA categories differed between adipose tissue types (white adipose tissue (WAT) vs brown adipose tissue (BAT)) and muscle tissue types (skeletal vs heart), but not between sexes. We found oleic  to be the most abundant FA in all studied tissues. Concentrations of polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) were not always higher in muscular tissue compared with adipocyte tissue, even though high concentrations of PUFA are considered beneficial for low body temperatures in torpor. In all tissues, we observed a high content in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), possibly to compensate for a low PUFA content in the diet. Ratios of ω6/ω3 were lower in the heart than in skeletal muscles of common noctules. Three FA (, oleic, and linoleic ) accounted for about 70% of the FA in adipose tissue, which is similar to proportions observed in migrating birds, yet migrating birds generally have a higher PUFA content in muscle and adipose tissues than bats. Bats seem to contrast with other mammals in having a high MUFA content in all tissues. We conclude that FA profiles of bats differ largely from those of most cursorial mammals and instead are-with the exception of MUFA-similar to those of migrating birds.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30708325>Mst1 inhibition attenuates non-alcoholic fatty liver disease via reversing Parkin-related mitophagy.</a></h2><p>Obesity-related non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is connected with mitochondrial stress and hepatocyte apoptosis. Parkin-related mitophagy sustains mitochondrial homeostasis and hepatocyte viability. However, the contribution and regulatory mechanisms of Parkin-related mitophagy in NAFLD are incompletely understood. Macrophage stimulating 1 (Mst1) is a novel mitophagy upstream regulator which excerbates heart and cancer apoptosisn via repressing mitophagy activity. The aim of our study is to explore whether Mst1 contributes to NAFLD via disrupting Parkin-related mitophagy. A NAFLD model was generated in wild-type (WT) mice and Mst1 knockout (Mst1-KO) mice using high-fat diet (HFD). Cell experiments were conducted via  (PA) treatment in the primary hepatocytes. The results in our study demonstrated that Mst1 was significantly upregulated in HFD-treated livers. Genetic ablation of Mst1 attenuated HFD-mediated hepatic injury and sustained hepatocyte viability. Functional studies illustrated that Mst1 knockdown reversed Parkin-related mitophagy and the latter protected mitochondria and hepatocytes against HFD challenge. Besides, we further figured out that Mst1 modulated Parkin expression via the AMPK pathway; blockade of AMPK repressed Parkin-related mitophagy and recalled hepatocytes mitochondrial apoptosis. Altogether, our data identified that NAFLD was closely associated with the defective Parkin-related mitophagy due to Mst1 upregulation.

However, it is unknown if 5-PAHSA affects glucose and lipid  in db/db mice, which are characterized by extreme hyperglycemia. Here, we aim to determine the effect of continued 5-PAHSA administration on glucose and lipid  in db/db mice. We also used 3T3-L1 cells and HepG2 cells to investigate the mechanism behind this effect. HepG2 cells and 3T3-L1 cells were induced to become models of insulin resistance. The models were used to test the effect of 5-PAHSA on insulin signaling. 5-PAHSA was administered orally to db/db mice for 1 month to assess its effects on glucose and lipid . We also exposed HepG2 cells to high glucose concentrations to investigate the influence on 5-PAHSA's effects on hepatic lipid  and inflammation. 5-PAHSA improved glucose uptake and insulin signaling in HepG2 cells and 3T3-L1 cells. However, after 1 month of treatment, 5-PAHSA did not reduce blood glucose levels, but increased inflammation and promoted fatty liver in db/db mice. In HepG2 cells under normal glucose conditions, 5-PAHSA treatment reduced lipogenesis and increased lipid oxidation. Notably, a high glucose concentration in cell media abolished the positive effects of 5-PAHSA treatment. These changes were associated with: decreased phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC); upregulation of sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c), and fatty  synthase (FAS); and downregulation of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1). Besides, the anti-inflammatory effect of 5-PAHSA was also impaired by high glucose conditions. Thus, high glucose concentrations impaired 5-PAHSA action by inhibiting the AMPK signaling pathway and promoting nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-κB) mediated inflammation.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30717198>Aspalathin-Enriched Green Rooibos Extract Reduces Hepatic Insulin Resistance by Modulating PI3K/AKT and AMPK .</a></h2><p>We previously demonstrated that an aspalathin-enriched green rooibos extract (GRE) reversed palmitate-induced insulin resistance in C2C12 skeletal muscle and 3T3-L1 fat cells by modulating key effectors of insulin signalling such as phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).

It has also been reported to improve insulin sensitivity in animal models of obesity and diabetic patients by targeting to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ. High glucose/high lipid (HG/HL)-induced apoptosis of pancreatic β-cells impairs its function of insulin secretion and is generally believed to be the key factor in the development of diabetes. In this study, we investigated whether telmisartan exerted a protective effect against HG/HL-induced apoptosis and insulin secretion in vitro as well as in vivo; 10-μM telmisartan treatment significantly reduced HG (25 mM) or/and HL (0.4 mM ) induced-cell apoptosis and greatly improved insulin secretion in INS-1 pancreatic β-cells, which is consistent in an obesity rat model induced by HG/HL diets. Furthermore, telmisartan treatment markedly reduced the protein level of GRP78, CHOP, and caspase 12, while increasing anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression. Moreover, telmisartan treatment significantly reduced intracellular ROS levels. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that PPARγ signaling pathway may be involved in the telmisartan protective effects, which were blocked by a PPARγ blocker, GW9662. In conclusion, the protective effect of telmisartan was mediated by an anti-ER stress-induced apoptotic and anti-oxidative pathway. SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS STUDY: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic  disorder worldwide pathologically characterized by hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. Long-term high glucose in the blood has been proposed to induce pancreatic β-cell loss and is generally believed to be the key factor in the development of diabetes. In the present study, we demonstrated that telmisartan, a common drug used for hypertension treatment, has a protective effect against high glucose/high lipid-induced cell apoptosis and greatly improves the insulin secretion function by inhibiting the oxidative stress and ER stress. Furthermore, this protective effect of telmisartan is mediated by the PPAR-γ signal pathway, which may provide a potential strategy against T2DM.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673191>[Biological role of insulin: transformation of carnivores leaving in the ocean into herbivores living on the dry land.

Phylogenetically late insulin blocks lipolysis only in phylogenetically late insulin-dependent subcutaneous adipocytes but not in phylogenetically early visceral fat cells of the omentum. 2.

Biological destiny of phylogenetically late insulin is transformation of carnivorous (fish-eating) animals living in the ocean into herbivores living on the dry land. 4. Insulin has formed in vivo highly efficient oleic variant of FA  instead of phylogenetically early less efficient  variant. 5. Biologically, insulin is destined for providing cells with energy and perfection of physical activity and kinetic parameters of the organism.

In the model diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, fatty acids (FAs) are synthesized from acetyl-CoA in the stroma of the plastid, producing . FAs are elongated and desaturated to form very-long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLC-PUFAs) in domains of the endomembrane system that need to be identified. Synthesis of VLC-PUFAs is coupled with their import to the core of the plastid via the so-called "omega" pathway. The biosynthesis of sterols in diatoms is likely to be localized in the endoplasmic reticulum as well as using precursors deriving from the mevalonate pathway, using acetyl-CoA as initial substrate. These  modules can be characterized functionally by genetic analyzes or chemical treatments with appropriate inhibitors. Some ' modules' are characterized by a very low level of  intermediates. Since some chemical treatments or genetic perturbation of lipid  induce the accumulation of these intermediates, channeling processes are possibly involved, suggesting that protein-protein interactions might occur between enzymes within large size complexes or metabolons. At the junction of these modules,  intermediates might therefore play dramatic roles in directing carbon fluxes from one direction to another.

Here, we aimed to examine the regulatory  whereby FGF21 mediates islet lipid  in lipotoxicity-treated cells and animal models. Rat β-cell line (INS-1E cells) and islets isolated from C57/BL6J mice were exposed to  (PA) with/without FGF21, mimicking lipotoxic conditions. Resultant insulin secretion and intracellular signaling were analyzed with Western blotting and RNA-seq. C57/BL6J and global FGF21 knockout (KO) mice were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) to induce lipotoxicity and given with a long-acting mimetic of FGF21. Insulin resistance and β-cell function were then assessed using homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and insulinogenic index. FGF21 ameliorated PA-induced lipid accumulation, reversed cell apoptosis, and enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) as impaired by lipotoxicity in islet β-cells. Mechanistically, FGF21 exerted its beneficial effects through activation of AMPK-ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) pathway and peroxisome proliferation-activated receptors (PPARs) δ/γ signaling, thus increasing the levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A (CPT1A) and leading to increased fatty  (FA) oxidation and reduced lipid deposition in β-cells. Interestingly, FGF21 reduced PA-induced cell death via restoration of the expression of apoptosis inhibitor Birc3. In vivo studies further showed that FGF21 is critical for islet insulinogenic capacity and normal function in the context of HFD-treated animals. FGF21 down-regulates islet cell lipid accumulation, probably via activation of AMPK-ACC and PPARδ/γ signaling, and reduces cell death under lipotoxicity, indicating that FGF21 is protective against lipotoxicity-induced β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis.© 2019 The Author(s).

The objective of the present meta-analysis was to study the associations between milk fat content of de novo FA, with (1) diet composition, and (2) milk production and composition. Milk FA data from 96 peer-reviewed studies published between 1990 and 2016 that included 324 treatment means from 83 bovine experiments, 36 treatment means from 12 caprine experiments, and 40 treatment means from 12 ovine experiments were used in this analysis. Individual species models including the fixed effect of experiment were fitted using multiple regression to explain milk content of de novo FA as a function of diet composition and milk production and composition variables. We also evaluated replacing the effect of the experiment by the effect of the experiment nested in the laboratory at which the research had been conducted, and the effect of the laboratory. Butyric  content in milk fat was positively but weakly related to dietary ether extract in does and ewes. Lauric, myristic, and  contents in milk fat were negatively related to dietary ether extract in does and to a somewhat lesser extent in cows and ewes. The results confirm that the inclusion of lipids in the diet may not only affect the availability of preformed FA but also the profile of FA synthesized de novo in the mammary gland. Most of the variation in all prediction models was explained by the experiment or by the laboratory if the latter was included in the model. The ample variation in analytical methods reported by the different research groups suggests that differences in analytical protocols might explain a substantial proportion of the variation in de novo FA profile. A main conclusion of this study is the potential influence of differences in analytical procedures to explain the variation in de novo FA profile. Standardization of methods of FA analysis to improve reproducibility seems to be an aspect of importance to this area of research.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

However, HY attenuated the HFD-induced decreases in bone biomechanical properties, including maximum load, maximum fracture load, and ultimate tensile strength ( < 0.05). Trabecular bone markers such as trabecular volume bone mineral density (Tb. vBMD trabecular bone volume/total volume (Tb. BV/TV), trabecular number (Tb. N), trabecular thickness (Tb. Th) were decreased, trabecular separation (Tb. Sp) and the structure model index (SMI) were increased in the HFD group compared with the NC group, and all parameters were remarkably improved in the HY group compared to the HFD group (p < 0.05). However, cortical bone markers such as cortical volume bone mineral density (Ct. vBMD), cortical bone volume/total volume (Ct. BV/TV) and cortical bone thickness (Ct. Th) were not significantly different among all groups. Moreover, the serum bone formation markers ALP and P1NP were higher and the bone resorption marker CTX-1 was lower in the HY group compared with levels in the HFD group. Compared with the NC group, the NY group had no difference in the above indicators. In rat primary OBs, PA treatment significantly decreased ALP activity and osteogenic gene and protein (β-catenin, RUNX2, and osterix) expression, and ALA dose-dependently restored the inhibition induced by PA.FO might be a potential therapeutic agent for HFD-induced bone loss, most likely by promoting osteogenesis.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155812>Anthocyanins ameliorate palmitate-induced inflammation and insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Increased adiposity has been associated with adipose tissue low-grade inflammation leading to insulin resistance. Adipocyte differentiation inhibitors are expected to be effective in preventing obesity and related diseases. Anthocyanins (ACNs) are associated to enhanced adipocyte function and protection from  stress. Herein, we evaluated the in vitro protective effects of an ACN rich extract against  (PA)-induced hypertrophy, inflammation, and insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. ACN extract pretreatment reduces lipid accumulation and peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-γ protein levels induced by PA. In addition, PA induces inflammation with activation of NF-κB pathway, whereas ACN extract pretreatment dose-dependently inhibited this pathway. Furthermore, adipocyte dysfunction associated with hypertrophy induces insulin resistance by affecting phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-protein kinase B/Akt axis, GLUT-1, and adiponectin mRNA levels. ACN extract pretreatment reverts these effects induced by PA and moreover was able to induce insulin pathway with levels higher than insulin control cells, supporting an insulin sensitizer role for ACNs. This study demonstrates a prevention potential of ACNs against obesity comorbidities, due to their protective effects against inflammation/insulin resistance in adipocytes. In addition, these results contribute to the knowledge and strategies on the evaluation of the mechanism of action of ACNs from a food source under basal and insulin resistance conditions related to obesity.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31240928>Protocatechuic -Ameliorated Endothelial Oxidative Stress through Regulating Acetylation Level via CD36/AMPK Pathway.</a></h2><p>As one of the main metabolites of anthocyanin, protocatechuic  (PCA) possesses strong antioxidant activity.

This randomized double-blinded three-parallel groups trial investigated the changes in various anthropometric and clinical biomarkers, and in plasma phospholipids fatty acids (PPFA) in volunteers at cardiovascular risk after a four-week intervention with 100 mL/day of (1) chokeberry juice with a high-dose of polyphenols (1177.11 mg gallic  equivalents, GAE); (2) chokeberry juice with a low-dose of polyphenols (294.28 mg GAE) and; (3) a nutritionally matched polyphenol-free placebo drink.

This study was aimed to investigate whether  would stimulate EV release from renal proximal tubular epithelial cells. Human and rat proximal tubular epithelial cells, HK-2 and NRK-52E, were incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), BSA-conjugated  (PA), and BSA-conjugated oleic  (OA) for 24-48 h. The EVs released into conditioned media were isolated by ultracentrifugation and quantified by nanoparticle-tracking analysis (NTA). According to NTA, the size distribution of EVs was 30-150 nm with similar mode sizes in all experimental groups. Moreover, BSA-induced EV release was significantly enhanced in the presence of PA, whereas EV release was not altered by the addition of OA. In NRK-52E cells, PA-enhanced EV release was associated with an induction of cell apoptosis reflected by an increase in cleaved caspase-3 protein by Western blot and Annexin V positive cells analyzed by flow cytometry. Additionally, confocal microscopy confirmed the uptake of lipid-induced EVs by recipient renal proximal tubular cells.

Recent studies on the molecular/cellular anti-inflammatory mechanisms of dietary components have demonstrated that mitochondrial respiration plays a key role in macrophage functioning. Since dietary lipids are major substrates for mitochondrial respiration through β-oxidation, the current study examined whether RBO regulates inflammatory responses by modulating mitochondrial energy . Palm oil (PO), enriched with  which are known to be effectively taken up by cells and used for oxidative phosphorylation, served as a positive control. In the in vitro model of LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 murine cells, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α) in the culture supernatant were significantly reduced by RBO treatment. In contrast, secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was upregulated by RBO. Transcription of genes encoding inflammatory mediator molecules (COX-2 and iNOS) and expression of activation markers (CD80, CD86, and MHC-II) in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells were suppressed by RBO. Mitochondrial respiration (as assessed by an extracellular flux analyzer) increased upon RBO treatment, as the basal respiration, maximal respiration, ATP production, and spare respiratory capacity were upregulated. In an in vivo study, C57BL/6 mice were fed a negative control diet containing corn oil (CO), PO, or RBO for 4 weeks, and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) were isolated from their tibias and femurs. In pro-inflammatory M1-polarized BMDM (M1-BMDM), the RBO-induced suppression of IL-6 and TNF-α was recapitulated in vivo. Mitochondrial respiration in M1-BMDM also increased following the RBO intervention and the PO control treatment as compared to CO fed negative control. Overall, the current study for the first time demonstrates that RBO regulates inflammatory responses in murine macrophages by upregulating mitochondrial respiration. Further clinical studies are required to validate the animal study.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31301829>Invited review: Sphingolipid biology in the dairy cow: The emerging role of ceramide.</a></h2><p>The physiological control of lactation through coordinated adaptations is of fundamental importance for mammalian neonatal life. The putative actions of reduced insulin sensitivity and responsiveness and enhanced adipose tissue lipolysis spare glucose for the mammary synthesis of milk. However, severe insulin antagonism and body fat mobilization may jeopardize hepatic health and lactation in dairy cattle. Interestingly, lipolysis- and dietary-derived fatty acids may impair insulin sensitivity in cows. The mechanisms are undefined yet have major implications for the development of postpartum fatty liver disease. In nonruminants, the sphingolipid ceramide is a potent mediator of saturated fat-induced insulin resistance that defines in part the mechanisms of type 2 diabetes mellitus and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. In ruminants including the lactating dairy cow, the functions of ceramide had remained virtually undescribed. Through a series of hypothesis-centered studies, ceramide has emerged as a potential antagonist of insulin-stimulated glucose utilization by adipose and skeletal muscle tissues in dairy cattle. Importantly, bovine data suggest that the ability of ceramide to inhibit insulin action likely depends on the lipolysis-dependent hepatic synthesis and secretion of ceramide during early lactation. Although these mechanisms appear to fade as lactation advances beyond peak milk production, early evidence suggests that  feeding is a means to augment ceramide supply. Herein, we review a body of work that focuses on sphingolipid biology and the role of ceramide in the dairy cow within the framework of hepatic and fatty  , insulin function, and lactation. The potential involvement of ceramide within the endocrine control of lactation is also considered.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Significantly lower levels of fatty acids, including myristic, , and palmitoleic acids, were found in high-grade versus low-grade BC cells. Furthermore, significantly altered levels of some amino acids were observed between low- and high-grade BC, namely glycine, leucine, methionine, valine, and aspartic . This study successfully demonstrated the potential of metabolomic analysis to discriminate BC cells according to tumor aggressiveness.

The study involved 73 women, including 24 patients with chronic kidney disease treated with haemodialysis, 19 patients with  syndrome (MetS), and 30 healthy women in the control group. A total of 35 fatty acids and derivatives were identified and quantified by gas chromatography. Intensified elongation processes from  C10:0 to C16:0 were noted in both groups (more intense in MetS), as well as an increased synthesis of arachidonic  (C20:4n6), which was more intense in CKD. Significant correlations of oleic  (C18:1n9), gamma linoleic  (C18:3n6), and docosatetraenoate  (C22:4n6) with parameters of CKD patients were observed. In the MetS group, auxiliary   of oleic  were activated, which simultaneously inhibited the synthesis of eicosapentanoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) from alpha lipoic  (ALA). On the other hand, in the group of female patients with CKD, the synthesis of EPA and DHA was intensified. Activation of the synthesis of oleic  (C18: 1n9 ct) and trans-vaccinic  (C18:1) is a protective mechanism in kidney diseases and especially in MetS due to the increased concentration of saturated fatty  (SFA) in plasma. The cause of the increased amount of all FAs in plasma in the CKD group, especially in the case of  (C16:0) and derivatives stearic (C18:0) acids, may be the decomposition of adipose tissue and the progressing devastation of the organism, whereas, in the MetS group, dietary intake seems to be the main reason for the increase in SFA. Moreover, in MetS, auxiliary   are activated for oleic , which cause the simultaneous inhibition of EPA and DHA synthesis from ALA, whereas, in the CKD group, we observe an increased synthesis of EPA and DHA.

Estrous was synchronised using two injections of PG administered at 11-d intervals and following artificial insemination (AI = Day 0) 179 heifers exhibiting oestrus were inseminated and assigned to one of two dietary treatments: (i) remain on their pre-insemination high dietary plane of nutrition (High) or (ii) restricted to 0.6 × estimated maintenance energy requirements (Low) in a 2 × 2 factorial design. The heifers were then maintained on their assigned diets until slaughter and embryo recovery on Day 16 (n = 92) or pregnancy diagnosis by ultrasound scanning at Day 30 post-AI (n = 87). Plasma concentrations of fatty acids, metabolites, insulin, progesterone (P4) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) were measured at appropriate intervals. Hepatic expression of mRNA for aldo-keto reductase (AKR1C), cytochrome P450 2C (CYP 2C) and cytochrome P450 3A (CYP 3A) was examined. The n-3 PUFA supplementation increased plasma n-3 PUFA concentration (P < 0.05) and reduced n-6: n-3 PUFA ratio (P < 0.05). Plasma IGF-1 was higher for n-3 PUFA relative to the CON (P < 0.05) and for High compared with Low plane of nutrition post-AI (P < 0.05) groups. A low plane of nutrition post-AI increased plasma concentrations of progesterone from Days 7-16 after insemination (P < 0.001) but reduced embryo length (P < 0.001). Supplementation with n-3 PUFA reduced and tended to reduce hepatic expression of CYP2C (P = 0.01) and CYP3A (P = 0.08), respectively. However, while dietary n-3 PUFA supplementation and an abrupt reduction in nutrient status following insemination elevated plasma concentrations of n-3 PUFA and mid and late phase P4, respectively, there was no effect of either PUFA supplementation or post-insemination plane of nutrition on embryo survival.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of T. halophilus CGMCC 3792 on the physiological characterizations and transcription profiling of Z. rouxii CGMCC 3791. Salt tolerance analysis revealed that co-culture with T. halophilus enhanced the salt tolerance of Z. rouxii during salt stress. Analysis of the volatile compounds revealed that co-culture reduced the level of 1-butanol, improved the level of octanoic  which all were produced by T. halophilus and reduced the level of phenylethyl alcohol produced by Z. rouxii. The presence of Z. rouxii decreased the contents of 3,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde and acetic  produced by T. halophilus. In addition, co-culture improved the content of benzyl alcohol significantly. Analysis of membrane fatty  showed that co-culture improved the content of  (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) acids in cells of Z. rouxii, and reduced the contents of myristic (C14:0), palmitoleic  (C16:1) and oleic  (C18:1). In order to further explore the interactions between the two strains, RNA-seq technology was used to investigate the effect of co-culture with T. halophilus on the transcription profiling of Z. rouxii. By comparing cells incubated in co-culture group with cells incubated in single-culture group, a total of 967 genes were considered as differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Among the DEGs, 72 genes were up-regulated, while 895 genes were down-regulated. These DEGs took party in various activities in cells of Z. rouxii, and the result showed co-culture with T. halophilus had a positive effect on proteolysis, the attachment of a cell to another cell, extracellular protein accumulation, energy , and a negative effect on oxidative phosphorylation, small molecular substances , DNA replication and repair, and transcription in cells of Z. rouxii. Results presented in this study may contribute to further understand the interactions between Zygosaccharomyces rouxii and Tetragenococcus halophilus.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Excess of meat in the diet leads to high content of  fatty  (FA) in hepatocytes and formation of  triglycerides (TG). Post heparin lipoprotein lipase slowly hydrolyzes  TG in blood plasma lipoproteins and releases small amounts of FA. If dietary carbohydrate content is low, the biological function of exotrophy does not provide the substrate from which hepatocytes can rapidly produce oleic nonesterified FA de novo. Energy substrate deficiency activates the biological function of adaptation and the biological reaction of compensation. Under the effect of epinephrin NEFA deficiency is compensated via the biological reaction of endotrophy and lipolysis in omental visceral fat cells. In insulin resistance (IR) syndrome, the biological function of feeding is realized nonphysiologically while the biological reaction of adaptation is realized physiologically. An increase in NEFA blood content physiologically blocks glucose uptake in cells. Biological role of insulin consists in conversion of distant ocean-living carnivorous (fish-eating) ancestors of Homo sapiens with  type of FA  into herbivorous dry land-living species with oleic type  of FA. The IR syndrome can be normalized. To this end a) the patient's will to activate the cognitive biological function (intellect) and b) comprehension of the fact that phylogenetically dry land-living Homo sapiens has developed as a herbivorous but not carnivorous species. Concerning death rate, cardiovascular pathologies are dominating in populations of many countries, while feeding function disorders prevail in frequency. These disorders form the pathophysiological basis for all  pandemias: 1) atherosclerosis and atheromatosis, 2) essential arterial hypertension, 3)  syndrome, 4) obesity, 5) insulin resistance syndrome, 6) nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and 7) endogenous hyperuricemia. Persistent potential deficiency of energy for realization of all biological reactions and functions is the major  disorders in diabetes mellitus.

The oxidized products are multifunctional. In this study, we investigated how oxidized fatty acids inhibit cell proliferation in cultured cells. We used polyunsaturated and saturated fatty acids, docosahexaenoic  (DHA; 22:6), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA; 20:5), linoleic  (LA; 18:2), and  (16:0). Oxidized fatty acids were produced by autoxidation of fatty acids for 2 days in the presence of a gas mixture (20% O2 and 80% N2). We found that oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids (OxDHA, OxEPA and OxLA) inhibited cell proliferation much more effectively compared with un‑oxidized fatty acids (DHA, EPA and LA, respectively) in THP‑1 (a human monocytic leukemia cell line) and DLD‑1 (a human colorectal cancer cell line) cells. In particular, OxDHA markedly inhibited cell proliferation. DHA has the largest number of double bonds and is most susceptible to oxidation among the fatty acids. OxDHA has the largest number of highly active oxidized products. Therefore, the oxidative levels of fatty acids are associated with the anti‑proliferative activity. Moreover, caspase‑3/7 was activated in the cells treated with OxDHA, but not in those treated with DHA. A pan‑caspase inhibitor (zVAD‑fmk) reduced the cell death induced by OxDHA. These results indicated that oxidized products from polyunsaturated fatty acids induced apoptosis in cultured cells. Collectively, the switch between cell survival and cell death may be regulated by the activity and/or number of oxidized products from polyunsaturated fatty acids.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658210>Evidence for perturbed  patterns in bipolar disorder subjects associated with lithium responsiveness.</a></h2><p>Bipolar disorder (BD) is multifactorial mood disorder characterized by alternating episodes of hyperactive mania and severe depression.

Its clinical application is limited because of its low potency and short half-life. We previously reported that peptide HP23-E6-IDL, containing both N- and C-terminal anchor-tails, exhibited stronger potency and a better resistance profile than T20. Here we designed an analogous peptide, YIK, by introducing a mutation, T639I, and then a lipopeptide, YIK-C16, by adding  (C16) at the C-terminus of YIK. We found that YIK-C16 was 4.4- and 3.6-fold more potent than HP23-E6-IDL and YIK against HIV-1 infection and 13.3- and 10.5-fold more effective than HP23-E6-IDL and YIK against HIV-1 infection, respectively. Consistently, the ex vivo anti-HIV-1 activity, as determined by the highest dilution-fold of the serum causing 50% inhibition of HIV-1 infection, of YIK-C16 in the sera of pretreated mice was remarkably higher than that of YIK or HP23-E6-IDL.

It is widely accepted that apoptosis of the pancreatic beta cell is an important cause for the induction of hyperglycemia and high levels of free fatty acids (FFAs), also called lipotoxicity associated with pancreatic beta cell dysfunction. Lipotoxicity has been proven to be an important pathogenic factor of diabetes. However, until now, the mechanism of FFA-induced lipotoxicity in INS-1 cells has not been fully understood. Current anti-diabetic drugs that protect islet cells are often toxic to healthy cells, resulting in negative side effects. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify more effective and safer anti-diabetic agents to protect pancreatic islet cells. Rubusoside (RUB) is a major ingredient in the leaves of Rubus suavissimus S. Lee, which decreases blood glucose levels by protecting pancreatic islet cells. However, the exact mechanism of this effect is unknown.

According to the  pathway analysis, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, and glycerophospholipid  were recognized as the most influenced   associated with lipotoxicity.

NAFLD can progress to an inflammatory state called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which may result in the development of fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. To develop therapeutic strategies against NAFLD, a better understanding of the molecular mechanism is needed. Current in vitro NAFLD models fail to capture the essential interactions between liver cell types and often do not reflect the pathophysiological status of patients. To overcome limitations of commonly used in vitro and in vivo models, precision-cut liver slices (PCLSs) were used in this study. PCLSs, prepared from liver tissue obtained from male Wistar rats, were cultured in supraphysiological concentrations of glucose, fructose, insulin, and  to mimic  syndrome. Accumulation of lipid droplets was visible and measurable after 24 h in PCLSs incubated with glucose, fructose, and insulin, both in the presence and absence of . Upregulation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 and 2, and of sterol responsive element binding protein 1c, suggests increased de novo lipogenesis in PCLSs cultured under these conditions.

Results showed that among tested insecticides, permethrin and ivermectin significant interacted with  to potentiate (permethrin) or decrease (ivermectin) TG accumulation. Further study showed that permethrin significantly promoted fatty  synthesis, while suppressed lipid oxidation-related genes only under steatosis conditions. In comparison, ivermectin inhibited lipogenesis-related genes and promoted farnesoid X receptor, which upregulates fatty  oxidation. Results in this study suggested that hepatic lipid  may be more susceptible to insecticide exposure in the presence of excessive fatty acids, which can be associated with the development of NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Although these FAs have been satisfyingly investigated in cattle, other species such as camel have been neglected. For this reason, the current study was designed to scrutinize changing patterns of C16 and C18 FAs in 10 dromedary camels from the last 2 months of gestation to the first months of lactation. Camels were grazed on natural pasture and supplemented with a balanced ration. Liver biopsies were obtained through blind biopsy technique at about 60, 45, 30, and 15-day antepartum (AP), and at 3, 15, 30, 45, and 60 post-partum (PP). Data were analyzed by the ANOVA procedure of SPSS with repeated measurements. From 15-day AP, saturated FA content of the liver declined (P < 0.01) and 15-day PP reached its peak (P = 0.02). At 30-day PP it went down (P < 0.01), and re-elevated at 45-day PP (P < 0.01) but remained at a steady state for the duration of the study. Mono-unsaturated and polyunsaturated FA content of hepatic tissue were constant throughout AP, albeit observed to peak at 15-day AP compared with 45 (P = 0.04) and 30-day AP (P < 0.01) for mono-unsaturated FAs, and with 60-, 45-, and 30-day AP (P ≤ 0.01) for polyunsaturated FAs. The  content of the liver reached a nadir at 30-day AP (P < 0.01), increased sharply (P < 0.01) at the next sampling time-point, and had a trend to escalate until 3-day PP. Palmitoleic  levels were unchanged from 60- to 30-day AP, decreased at 15 AP and 3-day PP, increased at 15-day PP, then remained constant until the end of the study period (P ≤ 0.04). Stearic  content started to grow at 15-day AP and reached its peak at 15-day PP (P < 0.01). At 30-day PP, stearic level in liver dropped abruptly (P < 0.01), then intensified at 45-day PP and did not change after; hepatic content of stearic  was lower during AP compared with PP time-points. Other C18 FAs changed significantly during the study period. These results suggest that parturition could have a profound effect on FA composition and other metabolites in camel liver.

Here, we discovered that MDV activates the fatty  synthesis (FAS) pathway in primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs). In addition, MDV-infected cells contained high levels of fatty acids and showed increased numbers of lipid droplets (LDs). Chemical inhibitors of the FAS pathway (TOFA and C75) reduced MDV titers by approximately 30-fold. Addition of the downstream metabolites, including malonyl-coenzyme A and , completely restored the inhibitory effects of the FAS inhibitors. Furthermore, we could demonstrate that MDV infection activates the COX-2/prostaglandin E (PGE) pathway, as evident by increased levels of arachidonic , COX-2 expression, and PGE synthesis. Inhibition of the COX-2/PGE pathway by chemical inhibitors or knockdown of COX2 using short hairpin RNA reduced MDV titers, suggesting that COX-2 promotes virus replication. Exogenous PGE completely restored the inhibition of the COX-2/PGE pathway in MDV replication. Unexpectedly, exogenous PGE also partially rescued the inhibitory effects of FAS inhibitors on MDV replication, suggesting that there is a link between these two  in MDV infection.

Disturbances of the lipid  in chickens infected with MDV contribute to the pathogenesis of disease. However, the role of lipid  in MDV replication remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate that MDV infection activates FAS and induces LD formation. Moreover, our results demonstrate that MDV replication is highly dependent on the FAS pathway and the downstream metabolites.

Previously, we found that a 5/6th nephrectomy model of CKD leads to an upregulation of miR-21-5p in the left ventricle, targeting peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α and altering the expression of numerous transcripts involved with fatty  oxidation and glycolysis. In the present study, we evaluated the potential for knockdown or overexpression of miR-21-5p to regulate lipid content, lipid peroxidation, and mitochondrial respiration in H9C2 cells. Cells were transfected with anti-miR-21-5p (40 nM), pre-miR-21-5p (20 nM), or the appropriate scrambled oligonucleotide controls before lipid treatment in culture or as part of the Agilent Seahorse XF fatty  oxidation assay. Overexpression of miR-21-5p attenuated the lipid-induced increase in cellular lipid content, whereas suppression of miR-21-5p augmented it. The abundance of malondialdehyde, a product of lipid peroxidation, was significantly increased with lipid treatment in control cells but attenuated in pre-miR-21-5p-transfected cells. This suggests that miR-21-5p reduces oxidative stress. The cellular oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was increased in both pre-miR-21-5p- and anti-miR-21-5p-transfected cells. Levels of intracellular ATP were significantly higher in anti-mR-21-5p-transfected cells. Pre-miR-21-5p blocked additional increases in OCR in response to etomoxir and . Conversely, anti-miR-21-5p-transfected cells exhibited reduced OCR with both etomoxir and , and the glycolytic capacity was concomitantly reduced. Together, these results indicate that overexpression of miR-21-5p attenuates both lipid content and lipid peroxidation in H9C2 cells. This likely occurs by reducing cellular lipid uptake and utilization, shifting cellular  toward reliance on the glycolytic pathway. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Both overexpression and suppression of miR-21-5p augment basal and maximal mitochondrial respiration.

This study investigated the interaction between 4EBP1 with PPARγ as part of the underlying mechanism by which insulin-induced lipid synthesis and secretion are regulated by mTORC1 in primary bovine mammary epithelial cells (pBMECs). Rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTORC1, downregulated 4EBP1 phosphorylation and the expression of PPARγ and the following lipogenic genes: lipin 1, DGAT1, ACC, and FAS. Rapamycin also decreased the levels of intracellular triacylglycerol (TAG); 10 types of fatty ; and the accumulation of TAG,  (PA), and stearic  (SA) in the cell culture medium. Inactivation of mTORC1 by shRaptor or shRheb attenuated the synthesis and secretion of TAG and PA. In contrast, activation of mTORC1 by Rheb overexpression promoted 4EBP1 phosphorylation and PPARγ expression and upregulated the mRNA and protein levels of lipin 1, DGAT1, ACC, and FAS, whereas the levels of intracellular and extracellular TAG, PA, and SA also rose. Further, 4EBP1 interacted directly with PPARγ. Inactivation of mTORC1 by shRaptor prevented the nuclear location of PPARγ.

Due to the growing economic burden of NAFLD on public health, it has become an emergent target for clinical intervention. DUSP12 is a member of the dual specificity phosphatase (DUSP) family, which plays important roles in brown adipocyte differentiation, microbial infection, and cardiac hypertrophy. However, the role of DUSP12 in NAFLD has yet to be clarified. Here, we reveal that DUSP12 protects against hepatic steatosis and inflammation in L02 cells after /oleic  treatment.

Consistently, DUSP12 overexpression in hepatocyte could reduce HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and inflammation. At the molecular level, steatosis in the absence of DUSP12 was characterized by elevated apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), which mediates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and hepatic . DUSP12 physically binds to ASK1, promotes its dephosphorylation, and inhibits its action on ASK1-related proteins, JUN N-terminal kinase, and p38 MAPK in order to inhibit lipogenesis under high-fat conditions.

Bacillus megaterium INCQS 425 was cultivated and evaluated for the production of lipophilic compounds and the properties of these compounds were investigated. Cultivation of the bacteria in a medium with a C:N ratio of 0.60:1 favored the accumulation of lipids by (17.5%) comprising mainly  (13.08%), palmitoleic (39.48%), and especially oleic  (37.02%), which imparts good characteristics to biodiesel. Meanwhile, cultivation of the bacteria in a medium with a C:N ratio of 4:1 favored the accumulation of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) (3.31gL) mainly comprising medium and long chain PHA. Low crystallinity (<30%) and excellent thermal properties make them suitable for processes that demand high temperatures, such as extrusion. The lipids produced in the present study had satisfactory oxidative stability for the production of quality biodiesel. The polyhydroxyalkanoates produced in the study are of low cost and have promising thermal properties that justify its technological potential, thereby configuring highly competitive bioproducts.Copyright © 2019.

Growth and fermentation inhibitors generated during physicochemical and enzymatic hydrolysis decrease ethanol and biomaterial production during the subsequent biological processes. Here, estimates of growth and fermentation inhibition during bioethanol fermentation were made using component profiles of corn cobs and corn stover at different degrees of hydrolysis. The component profiles were acquired by non-targeted gas chromatography mass spectrometry and targeted high-performance liquid chromatography. Correlations between the comprehensive analysis results and yeast growth and ethanol production were modeled very accurately by partial-least-squares regression analysis. Acetate, apocynin, butyrovanillone, furfural, furyl hydroxymethyl ketone, m-methoxyacetophenone, , syringaldehyde, and xylose, were compounds with very variable importance in projection values and had negative correlation coefficients in the model. In fact, methoxyacetophenone, apocynin, and syringaldehyde inhibited fermentation more than furfural in equivalent concentration.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the mechanism remains unknown. Mitochondrial homeostasis is proved to be important for maintaining the function of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), the first rate-limiting enzyme in testosterone synthesis. As the key regulator of mitochondrial membrane permeability, cyclophilin D (CypD) plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial function. In this study, we sought to elucidate the role of CypD in the expression of StAR affected by HFD.To analyse the influence of CypD on StAR in vivo and in vitro, mouse models of HFD, CypD overexpression and CypD knockout (Ppif ) as well as Leydig cells treated with  (PA) and CypD overexpression plasmids were examined with an array of , mitochondrial function and molecular assays.Compared with the normal diet mice, consistent with reduced testosterone in testes, the expressions of StAR in both mRNA and protein levels in HFD mice were down-regulated, while expressions of CypD were up-regulated. High-fat intake impaired mitochondrial function with the decrease in StAR in Leydig cells. Overexpression of CypD inhibited StAR expressions in vivo and in vitro. Compared with C57BL/6 mice with HFD, expressions of StAR were improved in Ppif mice with HFD.Mitochondrial CypD involved in the inhibitory effect of HFD on StAR expression in testes.© 2019 The Authors.

Obese pregnant women have dyslipidemia; however, whether obesity impacts placental lipid transport and  remains to be fully established. Palmitoleic  (POA), an FA with anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing properties, is synthesized from  (PA) catalyzed by stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD) activity. We hypothesized that the uptake and incorporation of FAs and POA synthesis are reduced in primary human trophoblasts (PHTs) isolated from pregnancies complicated by maternal obesity. Villous cytotrophoblasts were isolated from 7 placentas of obese [body mass index (BMI) = 37.5 ± 1.9] and 12 normal (BMI = 23.6 ± 0.6) mothers. FA uptake and incorporation were assessed using uniformly labeled (U[C])-FA mixtures of PA, oleic  (OA), linoleic , and docosahexaenoic . Cellular [C] FAs were quantified both in total cellular lipids and in lipid classes by GC-MS. Uptake and incorporation of [C] FAs in total cellular lipids were not different in PHTs isolated from obese mothers compared with normal mothers. Only the concentration of OA was increased in the triglyceride fraction ( < 0.05) if the mother was obese. We found an isotopic enrichment of POA after U[C]-PA treatment, demonstrating SCD activity in PHT cells. Labeled POA content and the POA:PA ratio were significantly lower in PHTs isolated from placentas of obese mothers compared with normal, healthy controls. Decreased syncytiotrophoblast POA synthesis may contribute to insulin resistance and low-grade inflammation in the mother, placenta, or fetus (or a combination of the 3) in pregnancies complicated by obesity.-Ferchaud-Roucher, V., Barner, K., Jansson, T., Powell, T.

The present study aims to investigate the mechanisms of TSD on AUB based on serum metabolomics. In this study, serum  profile data was collected using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography with ion trap/time-of-flight mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. 23 potential biomarkers (urea, serine, L-proline, L-glutamic , , l-acetylcarnitine, LysoPC(16:0), LysoPC(20:4), l-proline, linoleic , stearic , l-isoleucine, phenylalanine, l-tyrosine, Oleic , et al) were eventually identified using multivariate statistical analysis (PCA and OPLS-DA) with VIP > 1, P < 0.05. Correlation analysis, fold-change (FC), area under receiver characteristic (ROC), false discovery rate (FDR) were used for data confirmation to ensure the authenticity of the data. The related- pathway mainly included amino   (Phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan ; Valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis; Arginine and proline ; Glycine, serine and threonine ) and lipid  (linoleic  , glycerophospholipid ).

In 3T3-L1 cells, the cytotoxicity of QWTX was tested by CKK-8, and glucose uptake and fat  oxidation were assessed by 2-deoxy-D-[H] glucose and [1-C] , respectively. The expression levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1), liver X receptor α (LXRα), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), ikappa B α (IκBα), and AKT were determined by PCR and western blot. NAFLD was established by the administration of fat emulsion and sucrose for 9 weeks. The effects of QWTX on lipid , liver function, and hepatic morphology were observed in NAFLD rats by HE and transmission electron microscope. Serum level of nitric oxide (NO) and fee fatty  (FFA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in the liver, as well as the expression levels of Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), NF-κB, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), CPT-1, LXRα, PPARα, PPARβ/δ, PPARγ, and iNOS were all detected.QWTX showed no cell cytotoxicity in 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells, and increased the CO production rate to 4.15, which indicated the reducing the fatty accumulation. In NAFLD, QWTX attenuated liver steatosis, fat vacuoles and inflammation from the HE staining and electron micrograph tests. For the oxidative stress biomarkers, serum FFA level was reduced and serum NO level was enhanced after QWTX treatment. In liver tissue, SOD was decreased and MDA was significantly increased in NAFLD, and both of them were restored by QWTX. NF-κB and CYP2E1 were also upregulated in NAFLD, while downregulated by QWTX. Downregulation of LXRα, PPARγ and iNOS by QWTX were both observed in the 3T3-L1 adipocytes and NAFLD model.QWTX protected the liver injury in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and NAFLD by regulating the LXRα, PPARγ, and NF-κB-iNOS-NO signal .Copyright © 2019.

The gut microbiota is involved in the host energy  through the regulation of body fat storage, and a link between diet, FFA and the intestinal microbiota seems to exist. Our aim was to explore the interaction among serum FFA levels, gut microbiota, diet and obesity through a model regression tree in 66 subjects (age 52.7 ± 11.2 y) classified according to Body Mass Index (BMI). Total and individual FFA were analyzed by colorimetric enzymatic assay and methyl-tert-butylether-based extraction protocol (MTBE), respectively. Microbiota was determined by qPCR and diet through a food frequency questionnaire. Statistical analyses were performed, and predictive factors for obesity were obtained via classification by decision trees using machine learning methods. An obese-linked FFA profile was characterized by decreased eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and increased linoleic, gamma-linolenic and  acids levels simultaneously. Serum EPA and gender were identified as the most significant variables with 100% and 80% of importance, respectively. , Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium explained >30%, followed by Bacteroides group with 20% and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) almost with 15% of importance. Also, the regression tree model obtained for predicting obesity, showed a non-obese-linked profile, independently of gender, with serum EPA > 0.235 μg/mL and Bacteroides > 9.055 log n° cells per g of feces. Moreover, Faecalibacterium and Bifidobacterium seemed to play an important role by complementing the levels of FFA in predicting obesity in males and females, respectively.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Human LO2 cells nonalcoholic fatty liver models were established by using ( PA). Then psoralen and isopsoralen were administered for intervention. Intracellular triglyceride( TG) and total cholesterol( TC) content,the cell supernatant alanine aminotransferase( ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase( AST) levels were determined by enzyme method. Cell supernatant proinflammatory cytokines( IL-6,TNF-α) and chemokines( IL-8,MCP-1) were determined by ELISA method. Western blot method was conducted to detect the protein expression of intracellular nuclear factor( NF-κB) p65 phosphorylation( p-p65),nonphosphorylated protein( p65),and transforming factor TGF-β1. Result showed that as compared with the model group,intracellular TG and TC levels,the cell supernatant ALT and AST levels,proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were decreased( P < 0. 01,P <0. 05); the p-p65/p65 ratio and TGF-β1 protein expression were also significantly decreased( P< 0. 01,P< 0. 05) in psoralen intervention group. As compared with the model cells,intracellular TG content had no significant changes,but all the other indexes were reduced( P<0. 01,P<0. 05) in the cells of isopsoralen intervention group. Psoralen exhibited better effect than isopsoralen( P< 0. 01,P<0. 05). It is concluded that psoralen could improve the adipogenesis of LO2 cells induced by PA; both psoralen and isopsoralen are effective in ameliorating LO2 cells injury induced by PA,reducing inflammation via inhibiting the activation of NF-κB and down-regulating the expression of TGF-β1.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30998947>Lipotoxicity reduces β cell survival through islet stellate cell activation regulated by lipid -related molecules.</a></h2><p>Islet stellate cells (ISCs) activation is mainly associated with islet fibrosis, which contributes to the progression of type 2 diabetes. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this process is not fully understood.In order to investigate this process the current study examined ectopic fat accumulation in rats with high-fat diet (HFD) induced obesity. Levels of lipotoxicity-induced ISC activation and islet function were assessed via intraperitoneal glucose and insulin tolerance tests, and immunohistochemistry. The expression of lipid - and ISC activation-related markers was evaluated in cultured ISCs treated with  (PA) using quantitative PCR and western blotting. We also overexpressed sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c in ISCs by lentiviral transduction, and assessed the effects on insulin release in co-cultures with isolated rat islets.HFD increased body weight and ectopic fat accumulation in pancreatic islets. Lipotoxicity caused progressive glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, upregulated α-smooth muscle actin, and stimulated the secretion of extracellular matrix. Lipotoxicity reduced the expression of lipid -related molecules in ISCs treated with PA, especially SREBP-1c. Overexpression of SREBP-1c in ISCs improved islet viability and insulin secretion in co-cultures.These results indicate that lipotoxicity-induced ISC activation alters islet function via regulation of lipid , suggesting that therapeutic strategies targeting activated ISC may be an effective treatment for prevention of ISC activation-associated islet dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In an alternative fat blend, the major fatty acids were lauric (27.94),  (26.93) and oleic (15.75 mol%) . The solid fat index was quite similar to that of HCO, especially at 28-44 °C. Nevertheless, an alternative fat blend had lower saturated fatty  content, by 18%, compared to HCO. The content of highly atherogenic myristic  was reduced by approximately 40%.

Although the NIR fluorescently labeled glucose analog glucosamine (cypate-glucosamine) has applications in preclinical imaging, the transport  and fate of this probe in tissues remain unaddressed. Here, we have synthesized and characterized cypate and cypate-glucosamine conjugate (cy-2-glu), and investigated the probable transport  of these probes in vitro and in vivo. We compared uptake of the probes in the presence and absence of excess d-glucose, "saturated cypate" and  in two normal-cancer cell line pairs: lung cancer (A549)-normal (MRC9) and prostate cancer (DU145)-normal (BPH). Breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) and liver cancer (HepG2) cell lines were also examined. Results support use of the glucose transport pathway by cy-2-glu and fatty  transport pathway by cypate. Mass spectrometry data on the in vitro extracts revealed deamidation of cy-2-glu in prostate and liver cells, suggesting release of glucosamine. In vivo biodistribution studies in mice engrafted with breast tumors showed a distinct accumulation of cy-2-glu in liver and tumors, and to a lesser extent in kidneys and spleen. A negligible accumulation of cypate alone in tumors was observed. Analysis of urine extracts revealed renal excretion of the cy-2-glu probe in the form of free cypate, indicating deamidation of cy-2-glu in tissues.

However, even 3 days of HFD consumption has been linked to inflammation within the key homeostatic brain region, the hypothalamus.Mice were fed either a low-fat diet (LFD) or HFD containing 10% or 60% (Kcal) respectively from fat for 3 days. Mice were weighed, food intake measured and glucose tolerance calculated using intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IPGTT). Proteomic analysis was carried out to determine if hypothalamic proteins were changed by a HFD. The direct effects of dietary fatty acids on mitochondrial morphology and on one of the proteins most changed by a HFD, dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2 (DRP-2) a microtubule-associated protein which regulates microtubule dynamics, were also tested in mHypoE-N42 (N42) neuronal cells challenged with  (PA) and oleic  (OA).Mice on the HFD, as expected, showed increased adiposity and glucose intolerance. Hypothalamic proteomic analysis revealed changes in 104 spots after 3 days on HFD, which, when identified by LC/MS/MS, were found to represent 78 proteins mainly associated with cytoskeleton and synaptic plasticity, stress response, glucose  and mitochondrial function. Over half of the changed proteins have also been reported to be changed in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Also,in N42 neurons mitochondrial morphology and DRP-2 levels were altered by PA but not by OA.These results demonstrate that within 3 days, there is a relatively large effect of HFD on the hypothalamic proteome indicative of cellular stress, altered synaptic plasticity and mitochondrial function, but not inflammation. Changes in N42 cells show an effect of PA but not OA on DRP-2 and on mitochondrial morphology indicating that long-chain saturated fatty acids damage neuronal function.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063536>Prepartum fatty  supplementation in sheep.

Lambs were slaughtered after 42 d and liver and adipose tissue collected for FA and gene expression analysis. Liver concentrations of EPA and DHA were greater (P < 0.01) with LS of EPA + DHA vs. PFAD during the finishing period. In adipose tissue, a lamb × dam interaction was observed for EPA (P = 0.02) and DHA (P = 0.04); LS of EPA + DHA increased EPA and DHA, but the increase was greatest in lambs born from ewes supplemented with PFAD. No lamb × dam treatment interactions were observed for gene expression in liver tissue (P > 0.10). Hepatic mRNA abundance of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL; P = 0.01) was greater in lambs born from EPA + DHA ewes vs. lambs from PFAD ewes. mRNA expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (P < 0.01), fatty  synthase (P = 0.01), Δ5-desaturase (P < 0.01), and Δ6-desaturase (P < 0.01) were decreased in liver of EPA + DHA lambs. A significant lamb × dam diet interaction was observed for elongation of very long chain fatty  2 in adipose tissue (P = 0.01); lambs supplemented with the same FA as their dams had lower expression. Expression of HSL tended (P = 0.08) to be decreased in adipose of EPA + DHA lambs born from EPA + DHA ewes. The changes in mRNA expression suggest that lipogenesis decreased, and lipolysis increased in lamb liver with EPA + DHA vs. PFAD supplementation during the finishing period. In adipose tissue, changes suggest that lipogenesis decreased in lambs born from EPA + DHA supplemented dams and supplemented with EPA + DHA during the finishing period. In addition, these results suggest an interaction between supplementation of FA to dams during late gestation on lamb response of adipose tissue, but not liver, to FA supplementation during the finishing period.© The Author(s) 2019.

The binding of substrates to some of the 57 human P450s and other mammalian P450s is more complex than a two-state system and has been proposed to involve mechanisms such as multiple ligand occupancy, induced-fit, and conformational-selection. Here, we used kinetic analysis of binding with multiple concentrations of substrates and computational modeling of these data to discern possible binding modes of several human P450s.

Simulation of the binding of the ligands midazolam, bromocriptine, testosterone, and ketoconazole to P450 3A4 was consistent with an induced-fit or a conformational-selection model, but the concentration dependence of binding rates for varying both P450 3A4 and midazolam concentrations revealed discordance in the parameters, indicative of conformational-selection.

Increasing cardiac PA levels, resulted in shortened atrial action potential duration, and increased I density. Inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) prevented increases in I due to PA. Acute (≥1hr) exposure of atrial myocytes to exogenous PA (1 mM) increased the density of the rapid delayed rectifier potassium current I, while it was decreased with the unsaturated oleic  (OA, 1 mM). Serine-threonine protein phosphatase-2 (PP2A) inhibition with cantharidin reversed the effect of OA on I.Our data provide evidence of a novel lipotoxic guinea pig model with signs of vulnerability to arrhythmias.

Here we report that HFD-caused renal injury involved the inactivation of Pax2 and Ampk, and the activation of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), in a murine model. Specifically, mice fed on an HFD for 2, 4, and 8 wk showed time-dependent renal injury, the significant decrease in renal Pax2 and Ampk at both mRNA and protein levels, and a significant increase in renal sEH at mRNA, protein, and molecular levels. Also, administration of an sEH inhibitor, 1-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1-propionylpiperidin-4-yl)urea, significantly attenuated the HFD-caused renal injury, decreased renal sEH consistently at mRNA and protein levels, modified the renal levels of sEH-mediated epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs) as expected, and increased renal Pax2 and Ampk at mRNA and/or protein levels. Furthermore,  (PA) treatment caused significant increase in , and decrease in both Pax2 and Ampk in murine renal mesangial cells (mRMCs) time- and dose-dependently. Also, 14(15)-EET (a major substrate of sEH), but not its sEH-mediated metabolite 14,15-DHET, significantly reversed PA-induced increase in , and PA-induced decrease in Pax2 and Ampk. In addition, plasmid construction revealed that Pax2 may positively regulate Ampk transcriptionally in mRMCs.

Lauric C12 LC is half the FA in coconut oil. Residents of southeast Asia with constant use of coconut oil, have a low level of diseases of the cardiovascular system in the population. With a regulatory intake with food C12:0 laurin FA formed moderate ketosis and neuroprotective effect. Unlike long-chain LC, medium-chain TG cells are not deposited either in visceral fat cells, or in insulin-dependent adipocytes. Medium-chain fatty acids rapidly oxidize mitochondria; the formation of acetyl-CoA cells is used to form ketone bodies, activating thermogenesis in orange and brown adipocytes. Experiments with animals and observations in the clinic showed that taking medium-chain TG with food is more physiological than long-chain oils. This significantly increases the level of cholesterol in high-density lipoproteins. Food enriched with medium chain TG is optimal for increasing the ketone content in blood plasma, cerebrospinal fluid without limiting the carbohydrate content in food. The formation of excess ketone bodies by cells can be achieved by activating the  transformations of medium-chain FAs, without fasting and preserving carbohydrates in food. Coconut oil has a positive effect on the cardiovascular system, preventing the formation of atherosclerosis and atheromatosis. Effective in the prevention of the pathology of the cardiovascular system is a decrease in food amounts of , an increase in oleic , polyene FA with a simultaneous increase in the proportion of medium-chain FA.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049862>Outdoor cultivation of the green microalga Chlorella vulgaris under stress conditions as a feedstock for biofuel.</a></h2><p>The present work investigated the potential of the green alga Chlorella vulgaris to produce high-quality biofuel under culture stress conditions. The cultivation was carried out in a 1000 l open plate tank system, which provides biomass yields comparable to open pond systems, but with less area needed. Algal biomass and lipid content were measured repeatedly. We compared the two solvent systems n-hexane and hexane/isopropanol (HIP) for extraction efficiency of lipids and applied three different extraction methods Soxhlet, soaking, and soaking followed by Soxhlet (soak-Sox). The combination of the HIP solvent and the soak-Sox provided the highest lipid yield (15.8 ± 0.174). Volumetric biomass and lipid productivity were 0.201 g l day and 31.71 mg l day, respectively, whereas areal biomass and lipid productivity were 25.73 g m day and 4.066 g m day, respectively. The fatty  profile by means of gas chromatography resulted in seven fatty acids from C to C. The most abundant fatty  methyl esters (FAMES) were  (C16:0), oleic (C18:1), and stearic (C18:0) acids. Lipid synthesis enhanced by optimizing the Kuhl growth medium with replacing nitrate by urea (50% N compared to the original recipe) increased salt content (10 g/l NaCl), ferrous sulfate (0.5 g/l), and sodium acetate addition (1 g/l). With regard to density, kinematic viscosity, gravity, pour point, flash point, and cetane number, the Chlorella-biodiesel comply with ASTM and EN standards thus pointing at the high potential of lipids synthesized by Chlorella as a feedstock for biodiesel production.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31226399>Berberine attenuates nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis through the AMPK-SREBP-1c-SCD1 pathway.</a></h2><p>Berberine (BBR), a natural compound extracted from Chinese herb, has been shown to effectively attenuate nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in clinic. However, the mechanism underlying the effect of BBR is not fully understood. Stearyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD1) mediates lipid  in liver. Therefore, we hypothesized that SCD1 mediated the beneficial effect of BBR on NAFLD.The expression of SCD1 was measured in the liver of NAFLD patients and ob/ob mice. The effect of BBR on NAFLD was evaluated in C57BL/6 J mice on high fat diet (HFD). The effect of BBR was also investigated in HepG2 and AML12 cells exposed to high glucose and . Oil red O staining was performed to detect triglyceride (TG) level. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot were used to detect the messenger ribonucleic  (mRNA) and protein expression of target genes. The activity of SCD1 promoter was measured by dual-luciferase reporter assay.The expression of SCD1 was increased in the liver of NAFLD patients and ob/ob mice. BBR reduced hepatic TG accumulation and decreased the expressions of hepatic SCD1 and other TG synthesis related genes both in vivo and in vitro. Knockdown of SCD1 expression mimicked the effect of BBR decreasing TG level in steatotic hepatocytes, whereas overexpression of SCD1 attenuated the effect of BBR. Mechanistically, BBR promoted the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) in HepG2 cells and the liver of HFD-fed mice. Activation of the AMPK-SREBP-1c pathway and sterol regulatory element (SRE) motif in SCD1 promoter (-920/-550) was responsible for the BBR-induced suppression of SCD1.BBR reduces liver TG synthesis and attenuates hepatic steatosis through the activation of AMPK-SREBP-1c-SCD1 pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Ovariectomy (OVX) was performed on 6‑month‑old female rats treated with or without E2. Subsequently, various serum biochemical markers were measured. Additionally, pathological alterations of the uterus, liver and skeletal muscle were analyzed, and the content of triglycerides (TG) in muscle was detected. Differentiated myotubes formed by C2C12 cells were treated with  (PA) or pretreated with E2, estrogen receptor (ESR) 1 agonist propylpyrazoletriol (PPT) and ESR2 agonist diarylpropionitrile (DPN). Subsequently, the mRNA or protein expression levels of ESR1/2, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα), CD36 molecule (CD36), fatty  synthase (FASN), perilipin 2 (PLIN2), phosphorylated acetyl‑CoA carboxylase α (p‑ACACA), p‑AKT serine/threonine kinase (p‑AKT) and p‑mitogen‑activated protein kinase 8 (p‑MAPK8) were analyzed in skeletal muscle or in C2C12 cells by reverse transcription‑semi‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. The present results suggested that treatment with E2 inhibited OVX‑induced body weight gain, TG accumulation and insulin resistance. The protein or mRNA expression levels of ESR1, CD36, PPARα, p‑ACACA and p‑AKT were decreased, whereas the protein or mRNA expression levels of ESR2, PLIN2, FASN and p‑MAPK8 were increased in the OVX group. Of note, treatment with E2 restored the expression levels of the aforementioned factors. In C2C12 cells, treatment with E2 or PPT reversed the alterations induced by treatment with PA. In contrast, pretreatment with DPN did not influence the effect of PA. Collectively, E2 was able to interact with ESR1, thus activating the CD36‑PPARα pathway, decreasing the level of TG in the muscles and improving insulin resistance in skeletal muscles and C2C12 cells.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31253289>Effect of clones, year of harvest and geographical origin of fruits on quality and chemical composition of Argan oil.</a></h2><p>Argan oil is precious oil with food and cosmetic uses. In recent years, this oil has been subject to an increasing national and international demand. The present work aims at studying the effect of clones and age, year of harvest and geographical origin on Argan oil quality and chemical composition. The results indicate that age does not affect Argan oil quality and fatty acids content. However, clones had a significant effect on fatty acids and tocopherol levels. Saturated and unsaturated fatty acids were highly influenced by the year of harvest and geographical origin, presumably due to climatic conditions. Unsaturated fatty acids varied from 78.28% to 81.77%. Depending on clones, total tocopherols varied from 687.40 mg/kg to 1068 mg/kg.

Previous studies indicate that PA accumulates in the hypothalamus following consumption of HFDs; in addition, HFDs consumption inhibits autophagy and reduces insulin sensitivity. Whether malfunction of autophagy specifically in hypothalamic neurons decreases insulin sensitivity remains unknown. PA does activate the Free Fatty  Receptor 1 (FFAR1), also known as G protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40); however, whether FFAR1 mediates the effects of PA on hypothalamic autophagy and insulin sensitivity has not been shown. Here, we demonstrate that exposure to PA inhibits the autophagic flux and reduces insulin sensitivity in a cellular model of hypothalamic neurons (N43/5 cells). Furthermore, we show that inhibition of autophagy and the autophagic flux reduces insulin sensitivity in hypothalamic neuronal cells. Interestingly, the inhibition of the autophagic flux, and the reduction in insulin sensitivity are prevented by pharmacological inhibition of FFAR1. Our findings show that dysregulation of autophagy reduces insulin sensitivity in hypothalamic neuronal cells. In addition, our data suggest FFAR1 mediates the ability of PA to inhibit autophagic flux and reduce insulin sensitivity in hypothalamic neuronal cells. These results reveal a novel cellular mechanism linking PA-rich diets to decreased insulin sensitivity in the hypothalamus and suggest that hypothalamic autophagy might represent a target for future T2DM therapies.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121855>Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 Stimulates Pancreatic Islet Autophagy via Inhibition of AMPK-mTOR Signaling.</a></h2><p>Islet autophagy plays a role in glucose/lipid  in type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Real-time PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry/transmission electron microscopy were performed for the expression of targeted genes/proteins.HFD-treated mice showed increases in fasting plasma glucose, body weight and impaired glucose tolerance; islet protein expression of FGF21 was induced after HFD treatment. Protein expression levels of FGF21 and LC3-II (autophagy marker) were induced in mouse islets treated with high concentrations of  and glucose, while phosphorylation of AMPK was reduced, compared with controls. In addition, induction of LC3-II protein expression was reduced in islets isolated from  KO mice.

We previously showed that linoleic  supplementation markedly affect aroma compound production of S. cerevisiae wine strains. However, very little is known about how other commonly found fatty acids in grape juice modulate the growth and  of S. cerevisiae. We aimed to determine the individual effect of five fatty acids on fermentation patterns and  of two wine yeast strains (S. cerevisiae EC1118 and X5). Microvinification was performed at 15 °C by supplementing a grape juice (individually) with three different concentrations of saturated (), unsaturated (oleic, linoleic and γ-linolenic acids) and short-chain (hexanoic ) fatty acids. Metabolite profiles of the resulting wines were determined using Gas-chromatography coupled to Mass-spectrometry (GC-MS). Our data show that the addition of γ-linolenic  to the juice caused the production of higher amounts of amino and organic acids (except isoleucine and 2-oxoglutaric ) in wines when fermented by EC1118, while  supplementation showed similar trends when fermented by X5. The effect of linoleic  was independent of yeast strains and we observed a global reduction of amino and organic acids (except pyruvic ) while increased production of most of the fatty acids other than the supplemented ones. Our data clearly suggest that pre-fermentative supplementation of different fatty acids indeed influenced the growth and  of wine yeasts in a different way. Thus, attention needs to be paid not only to the wine yeast strain used during the winemaking but also to the overall grape juice composition, including fatty acids, to obtain the desired wine characteristics.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Clinically, the IDD group showed increased age, BMI and serum triglyceride. Triglyceride was a significant risk factor for IDD even after correction for BMI and age (P = 0.007).

Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a pleiotropic cytokine frequently featured in stem cell therapy with distinct renotropic benefits.

Coculture experiments identified glomerular endothelial cells (GECs) to be the exclusive source of glomerular HGF when incubated with either iPS-MSCs or BM-MSCs in the presence of PA. Furthermore, both GEC-derived HGF and exogenous recombinant HGF attenuated PA-induced ER stress in cultured tubular cells, and this effect was abrogated by a neutralizing anti-HGF antibody. Taken together, this study is the first to demonstrate that MSCs ameliorate lipotoxic kidney injury via a novel microenvironment-dependent paracrine HGF/c-Met signaling mechanism to suppress ER stress and its downstream pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic consequences.

We used matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) to investigate the distribution and composition of SM species in pork chop consisting of longissimus thoracis et lumborum muscle (loin), intermuscular fat tissue, transparent tissue, and spinalis muscle. Four SM species were identified by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem MS (MS/MS) and MALDI-MS/MS and visualized using MALDI-IMS. SM species containing stearic  were predominantly distributed in the loin and spinalis muscle, whereas SM species containing , lignoceric, and nervonic acids were predominantly distributed in transparent tissue. These results indicated that the distribution of SM species differed among the pork tissues, depending on the tissue-specific fatty  composition. The total amount including all identified SM species was higher in the loin than in spinalis muscle. Pork is reportedly associated with increased risk for chronic diseases due to the high amount of heme iron. From the observation of color, the amount of heme iron was lower in loin than in spinalis muscle. Thus, the degree of risk for chronic diseases might be lower in the loin than in spinalis muscle. This is the first report on the tissue-specific distribution of SM species in meat at a microscopic resolution using IMS. MALDI-IMS analysis may be useful in assessing the association between SM species and quality parameters of pork meat. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Sphingomyelin (SM) species are major sphingolipids in pork meat. SM species affect quality parameters such as health benefits due to their protective properties against colon cancer and atherosclerosis. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-imaging mass spectrometry analysis combined with liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry is a suitable method to directly investigate the distribution and composition of SM species at microscopic level among different tissues of pork meat. Therefore, this method is useful to assess the SM species-induced health effect of different tissues of pork meat.© 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776912>Clinopodium chinense Attenuates -Induced Vascular Endothelial Inflammation and Insulin Resistance through TLR4-Mediated NF-  B and MAPK .</a></h2><p>Elevated  (PA) levels are associated with the development of inflammation, insulin resistance (IR) and endothelial dysfunction.

Moreover, CCE inhibited the phosphorylation of Ikappa B kinase  , nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-  B), c-Jun N-terminal kinase, extracellular regulated protein kinases, p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and subsequently suppressed the release of tumor necrosis factor-  , interleukin-1  (IL-1  ) and IL-6. CCE also inhibited IRS-1 serine phosphorylation and ameliorated insulin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Moreover, CCE restored serine/threonine kinase and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation and thus increased insulin-mediated nitric oxide (NO) production in PA-treated HUVECs. This led to reverse insulin mediated endothelium-dependent relaxation, eNOS phosphorylation and NO production in PA-treated rat thoracic aortas. These results suggest that CCE can significantly inhibit the inflammatory response and alleviate impaired insulin signaling in the vascular endothelium by suppressing TLR4-mediated NF-  B and MAPK . Therefore, CCE can be considered as a potential therapeutic candidate for endothelial dysfunction associated with IR and diabetes.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30820195>Tetrahydroxy stilbene glucoside alleviates -induced inflammation and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes by regulating miR-129-3p/Smad3 signaling.</a></h2><p>Tetrahydroxy stilbene glucoside (TSG) has been reported to exert a cytoprotective effect against various toxicants. However, the function and mechanism of TSG in  (PA)-induced inflammation and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes are still unknown. The present study was designed to investigate the post-transcriptional mechanism in TSG-treated cardiomyocytes' inflammation and apoptosis induced by PA.The mRNA and protein levels were assayed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blotting, respectively. The targeted genes were predicted by a bioinformatics algorithm and confirmed by a dual luciferase reporter assay. Cell proliferation was analyzed by CCK-8 assay. Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/polyimide (annexin V-FITC/PI) staining was used to evaluate apoptosis using flow cytometry.TSG restricted the detrimental effects, including the activated inflammatory response and apoptosis, of PA in cardiomyocytes, as well as the up-regulation of miR-129-3p and down-regulation of p-Smad3 expression. In addition, bioinformatics and experimental analysis suggested that Smad3 was a direct target of miR-129-3p, which could inhibit or enhance the expression of p-Smad by transfection with miR-129-3p mimics or inhibitors, respectively. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that overexpression of Smad3 reversed the inhibition of inflammation and apoptosis by overexpression of miR-129-3p in PA-stimulated cardiomyocytes.TSG targeted to miR-129-3p/Smad3 signaling inhibited PA-induced inflammation and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31214287>Free fatty -induced histone acetyltransferase activity accelerates lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common  disease triggered by epigenetic alterations, including lysine acetylation at histone or non-histone proteins, affecting the stability or transcription of lipogenic genes. Although various natural dietary compounds have anti-lipogenic effects, their effects on the acetylation status and lipid  in the liver have not been thoroughly investigated.Following oleic- (OPA)-induced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells, the acetylation status of histone and non-histone proteins, HAT activity, and mRNA expression of representative lipogenic genes, including γ, , , and , were evaluated.

OPA-induced increases in the mRNA expression of lipogenic genes were down-regulated by C-646, a p300/CBP-specific inhibitor. Finally, we detected a positive correlation between HAT activity and lipid accumulation (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.604) using 22 NExs.Our results suggest that NExs have novel applications as nutraceutical agents with HAT inhibitor activity for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31261803>Chronic Heat Stress Induces Acute Phase Responses and Serum Metabolome Changes in Finishing Pigs.</a></h2><p>Heat stress (HS) is a main environmental challenge affecting the animal welfare and production efficiency in pig industry. In recent years, numerous reports have studied the alterations in gene expressions and protein profiles in heat-stressed pigs. However, the use of metabolome to unravel adaptive mechanisms of finishing pig in response to chronic HS have not yet been elucidated. We aimed to investigate the effects of chronic HS on serum metabolome in finishing pigs, and to identify the biomarkers of heat stress. Pigs (n = 8 per treatment) were exposed to either thermal neutral (TN; 22 °C) or heat stress (HS, 30 °C) conditions for three weeks. Serum metabonomics of TN- and HS-treated pigs were compared using the GC-MS approach. Metabonomics analysis revealed that twenty-four metabolites had significantly different levels in TN compared to HS (variable importance in the projection values >1 and  < 0.05). These metabolites are involved in carbohydrate, amino , fatty , amines , and gut microbiome-derived . Three serum monoses (glucose, mannose 2, and galactose) and 6-phosphogluconic  were decreased, indicating insufficient source of fuel for energy supply, resulting in negative energy balance (NEB) in heat-stressed pigs. Increased levels of non-esterified fatty  (myristic , , and linoleic ) and short-chain fatty acids (3-hydroxybutanoic  and maleic ) suggested fat decomposition compensating for energy shortage, which was an adaptive response to NEB. Increased concentrations of fluorine, lyxose 1, and D-galacturonic  were significantly correlated with the levels of acute phase proteins (HP, LBP, α2-HSG, and Lysozyme), suggesting acute phase response in HS-stressed pigs. These metabolites are expected to be novel biomarkers of chronic HS in pigs, yet the use of which awaits further validation.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31402655>Novel Fluorescence-Based Method To Characterize the Antioxidative Effects of Food Metabolites on Lipid Droplets in Cultured Hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>A fluorescence microscopic method for characterizing size, quantity, and oxidation of lipid droplets (LDs) in HepG2 cells was developed.

LDs induced by LA without 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane)dihydrochloride (AAPH) showed the most significant oxidation degree over PA and OA, especially in large LDs (area ≥ 3 μm, oxLD/LD = 52.3 ± 21.7%). Under this condition, two food-derived antioxidants were evaluated, and both of them significantly improved the LD characteristics. Moreover, chlorogenic  reduced the quantity of large LDs by 74.0-87.6% in a dose-dependent manner.

Advanced multivariate statistical analyses were performed for the construction of diagnostic models and biomarker discovery. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to suggest the most sensitive and specific diagnostic panel.The NMR-based diagnostic model showed allantoic  and deoxyuridine as the most overrepresented and underrepresented biomarkers, respectively differentiating MGN from both control groups. The GC-MS/MS-based diagnostic model showed oxalic  as the most overrepresented biomarker and 2-hydroxyglutaric  lactone as the only underrepresented specific biomarker.

We aimed to explore fatty  (FA) processing in human villous placental explants from seven uncomplicated term singleton pregnancies delivered by elective cesarean section. Explants were treated with stable isotope-labeled  (13C-PA), oleic  (13C-OA), or docosahexaenoic  (13C-DHA) for 3, 24, or 48 hours. Stable isotope-labeled lipids synthesized by placental explants from labeled FA were quantified, alongside endogenous unlabeled placental lipids, by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Labeled phosphatidylcholines (PCs), triacylglycerols (TAGs), and phosphatidylethanolamines were detected in explants, whereas labeled lysophosphatidylcholines were found in both explants and conditioned media. 13C-PA was primarily directed into PC synthesis (74% of 13C-PA-labeled lipids), whereas 13C-OA was directed almost equally into PC and TAG synthesis (45% and 53%, respectively, of 13C-OA-labeled lipids). 13C-DHA was only detectable in TAGs. TAGs demonstrated the highest isotopic enrichment for all 13C-FAs with 13C-OA-TAGs comprising >50% of total OA-TAGs (unlabeled and labeled), consistent with TAGs being a labile and accessible reservoir for FA storage. Variations in lipid incorporation were correlated to maternal glycemia and body mass index, suggesting that this experimental model could be used to investigate the effect of maternal factors on placental lipid . We conclude that lipid  partitioning of freshly imported FAs into labile and less labile lipid reservoirs in placenta is FA dependent. This process may partly mediate the physiological preferential transplacental transfer of particular FAs to the fetus, but may also be implicated in the fetoplacental pathophysiology of maternal  dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30650453>Triterpenoids from Hibiscus sabdariffa L. with PPARδ/γ Dual Agonist Action: In Vivo, In Vitro and In Silico Studies.</a></h2><p> is a medicinal plant consumed as a diuretic and anti-obesity remedy.

Activation of NF-κB signaling pathway plays an important role in the formation of insulin resistance. FoxO1 plays a major role in regulating glucose and lipid , as well as insulin signaling pathway. Previous studies have shown that Progestin and AdipoQ Receptor 3 (PAQR3) suppresses the activity of PI3K/Akt, which is an upstream pathway of FoxO1, and additionally promotes the pathological process of diabetic renal inflammatory fibrosis via activating NF-κB pathway. On this basis, it has caused us great concern whether NF-κB is involved in PAQR3 regulation of FoxO1 under insulin resistance. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether PAQR3 regulates phosphorylation of FoxO1 via NF-κB pathway in  (PA)-induced insulin-resistant HepG2 cells, thereby causing glucose and lipid  disorders. We found that PA stimulation and PAQR3 overexpression decreased the phosphorylation of FoxO1 and the expressions of glucokinase (GCK) and low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), in addition, promoted the nuclear accumulation of NF-κB. Inhibition of NF-κB pathway increased the phosphorylation of FoxO1 and the expressions of GCK and LDLR which were downregulated by PA stimulation and PAQR3 overexpression. Taken together, in PA-induced insulin-resistant HepG2 cells, PAQR3 might regulate the phosphorylation of FoxO1 and the expressions of GCK and LDLR through NF-κB pathway, thereby regulating the glucose and lipid  disorders induced by insulin resistance.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, regenerated peripheral nerves often do not reach normal functionality. Here, we investigated cardiolipin in the process of neuro-differentiation, since cardiolipin is closely linked to the mitochondrial energy supply in cells. The NSC-34 hybrid cell line, produced by fusing neuroblastoma cells with primary spinal cord motor neurons, was used, since it shares several morphological and physiological characteristics with mature primary motor neurons. Their neuro-differentiation was supported by switching from normal to differentiation medium or by fatty  supplementation. Differentiation was evaluated by measuring neurite-sprouting parameters and PPARα expression. Cellular fatty  distribution was analyzed to indicate changes in lipid  during differentiation. Cardiolipin was characterized by acyl-chain composition and the distribution of molecular cardiolipin species. Both, the switch from normal to differentiation medium as well as the administration of  and oleic  promoted neuro-differentiation. Stimulated differentiation was accompanied by changes in cardiolipin content and composition. The positive correlation between neuro-differentiation and concentration of those molecular cardiolipin species containing  and oleic  implied a link between differentiation of NSC-34 cells and cardiolipin .

Once activated, it promotes glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). However, increased levels of FFAs lead to lipotoxicity, inducing loss of β-cell function. FFAR1 plays a key role in the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D), and previous studies have indicated the importance of developing anti-diabetic therapies against FFAR1, although its role in the regulation of β-cell function remains unclear. The present study investigated the role of FFAR1 under lipotoxic conditions using  (PA). The rat insulinoma 1 clone 832/13 (INS-1 832/13) cell line was used as a model as it physiologically resembles native pancreatic β-cells. Key players of the insulin signaling pathway, such as mTOR, Akt, IRS-1, and the insulin receptor (INSR1β), were selected as candidates to be analyzed under lipotoxic conditions.We revealed that PA-induced lipotoxicity affected GSIS in INS-1 cells and negatively modulated the activity of both IRS-1 and Akt. Reduced phosphorylation of both IRS-1 S636/639 and Akt S473 was observed, in addition to decreased expression of both INSR1β and FFAR1. Moreover, transient knockdown of FFAR1 led to a reduction in IRS-1 mRNA expression and an increase in INSR1β mRNA. Finally, PA affected localization of FFAR1 from the cytoplasm to the perinucleus.In conclusion, our study suggests a novel regulatory involvement of FFAR1 in crosstalk with mTOR-Akt and IRS-1 signaling in β-cells under lipotoxic conditions.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652079>Uncommon properties of lipid biosynthesis of isolated plastids in the unicellular red alga .</a></h2><p>Red algae are a large group of photosynthetic eukaryotes that diverged from green algae over one billion years ago, and have various traits distinct from those of both green algae and land plants.

Lipid  in red algae has previously been studied in intact cells. Here, we present the results of radiolabeling and stable isotope labeling experiments in intact plastids isolated from the unicellular red alga . We focused on two uncommon features: First, the galactose moiety of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol was efficiently labeled with bicarbonate, indicating that an unknown pathway for providing UDP-galactose exists within the plastid. Second, saturated fatty acids, namely,  and stearic acids, were the sole products of fatty  synthesis in the plastid, and they were efficiently exported. This finding suggests that the endoplasmic reticulum is the sole site of desaturation. We present a general principle of red algal lipid biosynthesis, namely, 'indigenous C18 fatty acids are neither desaturated nor directly utilized within the plastid'.

Fifteen Holstein cows (137 ± 49 d in milk) were randomly assigned to a treatment sequence in a 3 × 3 Latin square design. Treatments consisted of a control diet (CON; no added PA) or 1.5% FA added as either a FA supplement (PA-FA) or a triglyceride supplement (PA-TG). The PA supplements replaced soyhulls, and diets were balanced for glycerol content. Periods were 21 d in length with sample and data collection occurring during the final 5 d. Compared with CON, PA treatments increased dry matter (66.5 vs. 63.9%) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) apparent digestibility (42.0 vs. 38.2%). Although PA treatments tended to increase 18-carbon FA apparent digestibility (79.1 vs. 77.9%), PA treatments decreased 16-carbon (63.1 vs. 75.8%) and total FA (72.0 vs. 76.5%) apparent digestibilities compared with CON. The PA treatments increased milk fat content (3.60 vs. 3.41%), milk fat yield (1.70 vs. 1.60 kg/d), yield of 16-carbon milk FA (570 vs. 471 g/d), 3.5% fat-corrected milk (47.6 vs. 46.5 kg/d), and energy-corrected milk (47.4 vs. 46.6 kg/d) compared with CON. The PA treatments did not affect dry matter intake (28.5 vs. 29.2 kg/d), milk yield (47.0 vs. 47.4 kg/d), milk protein yield (1.42 vs. 1.45 kg/d), milk lactose yield (2.29 vs. 2.31 kg/d), yield of <16-carbon milk FA (360 vs. 370 g/d), yield of >16-carbon milk FA (642 vs. 630 g/d), body weight (720 vs. 723 kg), or body condition score (3.14 vs. 3.23). We did not observe differences in digestibilities of dry matter, NDF, and 18-carbon FA between PA-TG and PA-FA. In contrast, PA-FA increased 16-carbon (68.6 vs. 57.6%) and total FA apparent digestibility (73.8 vs. 70.1%) compared with PA-TG. This resulted in PA-FA supplementation increasing the apparent digestibility of the PA supplement by ∼10 percentage points compared with PA-TG. Compared with PA-TG, PA-FA increased 16-carbon FA intake by 60 g/d, absorbed 16-carbon FA by 86 g/d, and absorbed total FA by 85 g/d. Compared with PA-TG, PA-FA increased dry matter intake (29.1 vs. 27.8 kg/d), yield of 16-carbon milk FA (596 vs. 545 g/d), and tended to increase milk yield (47.6 vs. 46.4 kg/d), milk fat yield (1.70 vs. 1.66 kg/d), and 3.5% fat-corrected milk (48.1 vs. 47.2 kg/d). In conclusion, the production response of dairy cows to PA tended to be greater for a FA supplement compared with a triglyceride supplement. Overall, PA increased NDF digestibility, milk fat yield, energy-corrected milk, and feed efficiency in mid-lactation dairy cows.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Evidence suggests that BBR ameliorates palmitate-induced lipid deposition and apoptosis in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs), which tracks in tandem with the enhancement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-alpha). The study aim was to investigate the roles of BBR in renal lipotoxicity in vitro, and investigate whether PPAR-alpha was the underlying mechanism. MATERIAL AND METHODS Human TECs (HK-2 cells) were injured with  (PA), and then treated with BBR, BBR+PPAR-alpha inhibitor (GW6471), and PA+PPAR-alpha agonist (fenofibrate). Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was assessed by measuring the expression of prospective evaluation of radial keratotomy (PERK), C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP), and 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78). Lipid  was assessed by determining lipid anabolism-associated genes, including fatty  synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and lipoprotein lipase (LPL), as well as lipid catabolism-associated gene, including carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1). Inflammatory response of HK-2 cells was evaluated by measuring interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Cell apoptosis and protein levels of cleaved-caspase-3 were evaluated. RESULTS PA downregulated PPAR-alpha and induced server lipotoxicity in HK-2 cells by ER stress, increasing lipid deposition, and elevating inflammatory response of HK-2 cells accompanied with inducting cell apoptosis and cleaved-caspase-3, which were obviously reversed by additional treatment of BBR or PPAR-alpha agonist.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small non‑coding RNAs, have been investigated as significant regulators of EPC vascular functions. The present study investigated the molecular crosstalk between metformin and miRNA‑130a (miR‑130a) in the functions of EPCs exposed to  (PA). Isolated EPCs were treated with metformin, PA, and metformin + PA, respectively. Cell Counting Kit‑8, Transwell and Matrigel assays were performed to detect the proliferation, migration and tube formation ability of EPCs following different treatments. The expression of miR‑130a, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and phosphorylated‑AKT was analyzed by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. The specific mechanism underlying the function of metformin in EPCs was further elucidated by transfecting miR‑130a mimics and inhibitor to overexpress and inhibit the expression of miR‑130a in EPCs, respectively. EPCs exhibited impaired functions of proliferation (P<0.01 compared with the control), migration (P<0.01 compared with the control) and tube formation (P<0.01 compared with the control) following treatment with PA, and the expression levels of miR‑130a and PTEN were decreased and increased, respectively. However, the presence of metformin, or the overexpression of miR‑130a using miR‑130a mimic alleviated the impairment of angiogenesis and proliferation, decreased the expression of PTEN and activated the phosphoinositide‑3 kinase/AKT pathway in EPCs exposed to PA. By contrast, downregulating the expression of miR‑130a with a miR‑130a inhibitor reversed the metformin‑mediated protection. These results demonstrate the beneficial effect of miR‑130a/PTEN on EPC functions, which can be regulated by metformin. The effects of metformin on improving PA‑induced EPC dysfunction are mediated by miR‑130a and PTEN, which may assist in the prevention and/or treatment of diabetic vascular disease.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31421115>Acanthoic  modulates lipogenesis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease via FXR/LXRs-dependent manner.</a></h2><p>Acanthoic  (AA) is a pimaradiene diterpene isolated from Acanthopanax koreanum Nakai (Araliaceae), with anti-inflammatory and hepatic-protective effects.

C57BL/6 mice were received a modified Lieber-DeCarli diet with 71% high-fat (L-D) and treated with AA (20 and 40 mg/kg) or equal volume of saline for 12 weeks. The regulation of AA on lipid accumulation was also detected in pro-steatotic stimulated AML12 cells with  (PA). When L-D diet-fed mice were treated with AA, loss in body weight, liver index, and liver lipid droplet were observed along with reduced triglyceride (TG) and serum transaminase. Furthermore, AA decreased sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) and target genes expression, regulated PPARα and PPARγ expressions, ameliorated hepatic fibrosis markers, enhanced hepatic FXR and LXR, and regulated AMPK-LKB1 and SIRT1 signaling pathway. Moreover, AA attenuated lipid accumulation via FXR and LXR activation in steatotic AML-12 cells, which was confirmed by guggulsterones (FXR antagonist) or GW3965 (LXR agonist). Activation of FXR and LXR signaling caused by AA might increase AMPK-SIRT1 signaling and then contribute to modulating lipid accumulation and fatty  synthesis, which suggested that activated FXR-LXR axis by AA represented an effective strategy for relieving NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Expression of IGFBP-1 in the serum was estimated by Western blot analysis.HBOT decreased blood levels of total cholesterol (p<0.05), triglycerides (p<0.05) and low-density lipoprotein (p<0.05). HBOT increased plasma levels of individual FAs:  (p<0.05), palmitoleic  (p<0.05), docosapentaenoic  (p<0.05) and docosahexaenoic  (p<0.01), and decreased levels of stearic  (p<0.05), alpha linolenic  (p<0.05) and linoleic  (p<0.01). Expression of IGFBP-1 (p<0.01) was increased, whereas the level of insulin (p<0.001) was decreased in the serum after HBOT.Our results indicate that HBOT exerts beneficial effects in IDDM patients by improving the lipid profile and altering FA composition.Copyright © 2019 Canadian Diabetes Association.

PAHSAs reduce ambient glycemia and improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant aged chow- and high-fat diet-fed (HFD-fed) mice. Here, we aimed to determine the mechanisms by which PAHSAs improve insulin sensitivity. Both acute and chronic PAHSA treatment enhanced the action of insulin to suppress endogenous glucose production (EGP) in chow- and HFD-fed mice. Moreover, chronic PAHSA treatment augmented insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in glycolytic muscle and heart in HFD-fed mice. The mechanisms by which PAHSAs enhanced hepatic insulin sensitivity included direct and indirect actions involving intertissue communication between adipose tissue and liver. PAHSAs inhibited lipolysis directly in WAT explants and enhanced the action of insulin to suppress lipolysis during the clamp in vivo. Preventing the reduction of free fatty acids during the clamp with Intralipid infusion reduced PAHSAs' effects on EGP in HFD-fed mice but not in chow-fed mice. Direct hepatic actions of PAHSAs may also be important, as PAHSAs inhibited basal and glucagon-stimulated EGP directly in isolated hepatocytes through a cAMP-dependent pathway involving Gαi protein-coupled receptors. Thus, this study advances our understanding of PAHSA biology and the physiologic mechanisms by which PAHSAs exert beneficial  effects.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31287560>In vivo kinetic study of materno-fetal fatty  transfer in obese and normal weight pregnant women.</a></h2><p>Placental structure and function can be modified as a result of maternal obesity affecting materno-fetal fatty acids (FA) transport. We report for the first time, in humans and in vivo, the kinetics of placental FA transfer in normo-weight and in normolipemic obese pregnant women using stable isotopes. The administration of different tracer FA with similar behaviour to the mother at different time points allows the collection of kinetic information on materno-fetal transfer of FA despite only one sample of placenta and cord can be collected per subject. Computational modelling showed a good fit to the data when considering all maternal plasma lipid classes but not when based only on non-esterified FA. The novel approach using multiple tracer FA administration combined with computational modelling shows a consistent time course of placental tracer FA and predicted total FA accumulation.We analyse for the first time the in vivo materno-fetal kinetic transfer of fatty acids (FA) labelled with stable isotopes in control and obese (OB) pregnant women. Labelled FA with a similar  (stearic :  C-SA; :  C-PA; oleic :  C-OA) were orally administered at -4 h, -8 h and -12 h, respectively prior to elective caesarean section to 10 pregnant women with a body mass index >30 (OB) and 10 with a body mass index in the range 20-25 (NW). Placenta, venous and arterial cord blood were collected obtaining a wide range of FA enrichments. A combined experimental and computational modelling analysis was applied. FA fractional synthesis rate (FSR) in placenta was 11-12% h . No differences were observed between NW and normo-lipidemic OB. It was not possible to estimate FA FSR in cord blood with this oral bolus dose approach. Computational modelling demonstrated a good fit to the data when all maternal plasma lipid classes were included but not with modelling based only on the non-esterified FA fraction. The estimated materno-fetal  C-FA transfer was ∼1%. In conclusion, our approach using multiple  C-FA tracers allowed us to estimated FSR in placental/maternal plasma but not in fetal/maternal compartments. Computational modelling showed a consistent time course of placental  C-FA transfer and predicted total fetal FA accumulation during the experiment. We conclude that, in addition to non-esterified FA fraction in the maternal circulation, maternal plasma very low-density lipoprotein and other lipoproteins are important contributors to placental FA transfer to the fetus.© 2019 The Authors.

In the current study, we investigated the effects of PCW extract on hepatic steatosis under in vitro and in vivo conditions, and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. In this study, a mixture of HepG2 cells treated with free fatty  (FFA)- and oleic -and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed obese mice were used; in this background, the triglyceride (TG) levels in HepG2 cells and mice liver were measured, and the expression levels of genes associated with lipogenesis, fatty  oxidation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and autophagy were determined. Treatment of HepG2 cells with FFA enhanced intracellular TG levels in HepG2 cells, but co-treatment with PCW significantly attenuated the TG levels. Notably, PCW significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) in FFA-treated HepG2 cells. PCW downregulated the expression of lipogenesis-related genes, but upregulated the expression of genes associated with fatty  oxidation. Further, PCW inhibited FFA-induced expression of ER stress markers and induced autophagy proteins. However, inhibition of AMPK significantly attenuated the beneficial effects of PCW in HepG2 cells. Moreover, PCW efficiently decreased HFD-induced hepatic TG accumulation in vivo and increased the phosphorylation of hepatic AMPK. Three compounds present in PCW including poricoic , pachymic , and ergosterol, significantly decreased FFA-induced increase in intracellular TG levels, consistent with increased AMPK phosphorylation, suggesting that poricoic , pachymic , and ergosterol are responsible for PCW-mediated amelioration of hepatic steatosis. Taken together, these results demonstrated that PCW ameliorates hepatic steatosis through the regulation of lipid , inhibition of ER stress, and activation of autophagy in an AMPK-dependent manner. This suggested that PCW can be potentially used for the treatment of hepatic steatosis.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31380811>PAHSAs attenuate immune responses and promote β cell survival in autoimmune diabetic mice.</a></h2><p> esters of hydroxy stearic acids (PAHSAs) are endogenous antidiabetic and antiinflammatory lipids. Here, we show that PAHSAs protect against type 1 diabetes (T1D) and promote β cell survival and function. Daily oral PAHSA administration to nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice delayed the onset of T1D and markedly reduced the incidence of T1D, whether PAHSAs were started before or after insulitis was established. PAHSAs reduced T and B cell infiltration and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation, while increasing Treg activation in pancreata of NOD mice. PAHSAs promoted β cell proliferation in both NOD mice and MIN6 cells and increased the number of β cells in NOD mice. PAHSAs attenuated cytokine-induced apoptotic and necrotic β cell death and increased β cell viability. The mechanism appears to involve a reduction of ER stress and MAPK signaling, since PAHSAs lowered ER stress in NOD mice, suppressed thapsigargin-induced PARP cleavage in human islets, and attenuated ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 activation in MIN6 cells. This appeared to be mediated in part by glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) and not the G protein-coupled receptor GPR40. PAHSAs also prevented impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and improved glucose tolerance in NOD mice. Thus, PAHSAs delayed the onset of T1D and reduced its incidence by attenuating immune responses and exerting direct protective effects on β cell survival and function.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728499>Evidence for an alternative fatty  desaturation pathway increasing cancer plasticity.</a></h2><p>Most tumours have an aberrantly activated lipid  that enables them to synthesize, elongate and desaturate fatty acids to support proliferation. However, only particular subsets of cancer cells are sensitive to approaches that target fatty   and, in particular, fatty  desaturation. This suggests that many cancer cells contain an unexplored plasticity in their fatty  . Here we show that some cancer cells can exploit an alternative fatty  desaturation pathway. We identify various cancer cell lines, mouse hepatocellular carcinomas, and primary human liver and lung carcinomas that desaturate palmitate to the unusual fatty  sapienate to support membrane biosynthesis during proliferation. Accordingly, we found that sapienate biosynthesis enables cancer cells to bypass the known fatty  desaturation pathway that is dependent on stearoyl-CoA desaturase. Thus, only by targeting both desaturation  is the in vitro and in vivo proliferation of cancer cells that synthesize sapienate impaired. Our discovery explains  plasticity in fatty  desaturation and constitutes an unexplored  rewiring in cancers.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741598>Dynamics of Individual Fatty Acids in Muscle Fat Stores and Membranes of a Songbird and Its Functional and Ecological Importance.</a></h2><p>Although tissue fatty  (FA) composition has been linked to whole-animal performance (e.g., aerobic endurance,  rate, postexercise recovery) in a wide range of animal taxa, we do not adequately understand the pace of changes in FA composition and its implications for the ecology of animals. Therefore, we used a C to C diet shift experiment and compound-specific δC analysis to estimate the turnover rates of FAs in the polar and neutral fractions of flight muscle lipids (corresponding to membranes and lipid droplets) of exercised and sedentary zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Turnover was fastest for linoleic  (LA; 18:2n6) and  (PA; 16:0), with 95% replacement times of 10.8-17.7 d in the polar fraction and 17.2-32.8 d in the neutral fraction, but was unexpectedly slow for the long-chain polyunsaturated FAs (LC-PUFAs) arachidonic  (20:4n6) and docosahexaenoic  (22:6n3) in the polar fraction, with 95% replacement in 64.9-136.5 d. Polar fraction LA and PA turnover was significantly faster in exercised birds (95% replacement in 8.5-13.3 d). Our results suggest that FA turnover in intramuscular lipid droplets is related to FA tissue concentrations and that turnover does not change in response to exercise. In contrast, we found that muscle membrane FA turnover is likely driven by a combination of selective LC-PUFA retention and consumption of shorter-chain FAs in energy . The unexpectedly fast turnover of membrane-associated FAs in muscle suggests that songbirds during migration could substantially remodel their membranes within a single migration stopover, and this may have substantial implications for how the FA composition of diet affects energy  of birds during migration.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095863>Trimethylamine N-Oxide Aggravates Liver Steatosis through Modulation of Bile   and Inhibition of Farnesoid X Receptor Signaling in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), the metabolite of choline generated by gut microbiota, is associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and could influence bile  (BA) . However, whether TMAO aggravates liver steatosis by modulating BA  and the related mechanisms has not been investigated.A case-control study including biopsy-proven NAFLD patients (n = 34) and controls (n = 14) is conducted to determine the correlation between TMAO and BA . Serum levels of total BA and the percentage of farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-antagonistic BA species are markedly higher in NAFLD patients than in the controls. Serum levels of TMAO positively correlated with the serum levels of total BA and hepatic mRNA expression of cholesterol 7 alpha hydroxylase (CYP7A1). In a murine model, it is found that 18 weeks administration of TMAO impairs liver function and increases hepatic triglyceride accumulation and lipogenesis in mice fed with a high-fat diet. TMAO increases BA synthesis and shifted hepatic BA composition toward FXR-antagonistic activity. Knockdown of CYP7A1 via small interfering RNA or activation of FXR by GW4064 blocks the effect of TMAO-induced lipogenesis in -treated HepG2 cells.TMAO aggravates liver steatosis by suppressing BA-mediated hepatic FXR signaling.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The industrial production of lactic  bacteria requires a comprehensive understanding of their survival stress, especially regarding changes in  substances in a glucose-limited environment. In the present study, a metabolomic approach was applied to investigate Lactobacillus casei Zhang using cultures from a common ancestor that were permitted to evolve under conditions with normal or glucose-restricted media for up to 4,000 generations. Metabolomic analyses of intracellular and extracellular differential metabolites under De Man, Rogosa and Sharpe broth (2% vol/vol glucose; Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, UK) and glucose-restricted (0.02% vol/vol glucose in De Man, Rogosa and Sharpe broth) conditions were performed at generations 0, 2,000, and 4,000 and revealed 23 different metabolites. Myristic , ergothioneine, Lys-Thr, and palmitamide contents exhibited significant reductions between 0 and 4,000 generations, whereas nicotinate, histidine, , l-lysine, urocanate, thymine, and other substances increased.

SNI reduced discriminative memory and LTP. Um-PEA treatment started after the development of neuropathic pain had no effects in sham mice, whereas it restored cognitive behavior and LTP in SNI mice. 2-Methyl-6-(phenylethynyl) pyridine (MPEP), a selective mGluR5 antagonist, improved cognition in SNI mice and produced a chemical long term depression of the field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in sham and SNI mice. After theta burst stimulation (TBS) MPEP restored LTP in SNI mice. In combination with PEA, MPEP antagonized the PEA effect on discriminative memory and decreased LTP in SNI mice. The (RS)-4-(1-amino-1-carboxyethyl)phthalic  (MDCPG), a selective mGluR8 antagonist, did not affect discriminative memory, but it induced a chemical LTP and prevented the enhancement of fEPSPs after TBS in SNI mice which were treated or not treated with PEA. The effect of PEA on LTP and cognitive behavior was modulated by mGluR5 and mGluR8. In particular in the SNI conditions, the mGluR5 blockade facilitated memory and LTP, but prevented the beneficial effects of PEA on discriminative memory while the mGluR8 blockade, which was ineffective in itself, prevented the favorable action of the PEA on LTP. Thus, although their opposite roles (excitatory/inhibitory of the two receptor subtypes on the glutamatergic system), they appeared to be required for the neuroprotective effect of PEA in conditions of neuropathic pain.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30717785>CD36 mediates palmitate -induced metastasis of gastric cancer via AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin pathway.</a></h2><p>Gastric cancer (GC) has a clear predilection for metastasis toward the omentum which is primarily composed of adipose tissue, indicating that fatty acids may contribute to this phenomenon. However their function remains poorly understood in GC. In this study, we investigated the role of palmitate  (PA) and its cellular receptor CD36 in the progression of GC.Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed to detect CD36 expression in GC tissues and its clinical significance was determined statistically. CD36 over-expression and knock-down expression cell models were developed and tested in vitro. Wound-healing assays, migration assays, and invasion assays were performed and peritoneal implants into nude mice were done to assess the biological effects of PA and CD36. The underlying mechanisms were investigated using western blot, immunofluorescence (IF), quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and antibody blocking assays.PA promoted the metastasis of GC by phosphorylation of AKT, which facilitated the nuclear localization of β-catenin through inactivation of GSK-3β via phosphorylation. This tumor-promoting effect of PA was mediated by CD36, a cell surface receptor of fatty acids (FAs). The higher the CD36 expression levels in GC tissues correlated with the poorer the prognosis of patients according to the TCGA database, the GEO database and our own clinical data.Our experiments established CD36 as a key mediator of FA-induced metastasis of GC via the AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway.

Subjects with hyperlipidemia (n=22) and age-matched healthy controls (n=19) were included in this study. Results showed that plasma levels of Gla-Gas6 protein and VK were significantly lower in hyperlipidemic subjects compared to control. Moreover, Gla-Gas6 levels were significantly and positively correlated with VK (P=.034, r=0.452) and negatively with triglyceride (P=.022, r=-0.485) and total cholesterol (P=.043, r=-0.435) in hyperlipidemic subjects, which suggest that VK supplementation may have a positive effect in activating Gas6 protein and thereby reducing the aberrant plasma lipid levels. Further studies with high-fat diet (HFD)-fed animal model of hyperlipidemia demonstrated that VK supplementation (5 μg/kg body weight, 8 weeks) reduced the plasma lipid levels, stimulated both the plasma levels and the hepatic protein expression of Gla-Gas6 protein, and regulated the AMPK/SREBP1/PPARα signaling  of hepatic lipid  in HFD-fed mice.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of applying a novel method, using either 400 or 500 g fat/kg (treatments FL40 and FL50, respectively), which was enriched in PA and SA at different ratios (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75 and 0:100), on physical and chemical characteristics, ruminal degradability, solubility and in vitro intestinal protein digestibility (IVIPD) of the obtained products. Encapsulation of SBM in fat resulted in greater mean particle size and lower bulk density and protein solubility than unprotected SBM (USBM). Treatment FL50 resulted in increased (p < 0.01) rumen-undegraded protein (RUP) compared to USBM. There were no differences in RUP of SBM when different PA: SA ratios were used. The mean RUP content of treatments FL40 and FL50 (306 and 349 g/kg, respectively) was greater compared to USBM (262 g/kg, p < 0.05), but lower than that for a standard heat-treated SBM (431 g/kg). Values of IVIPD did not differ among SBM, heat-treated SBM and FL40 and FL50 samples, all being greater than 97.8%. In conclusion, encapsulation of SBM with fats enriched in PA and SA proved to be effective in reducing protein solubility and increasing RUP without depressing protein digestibility in the intestine.

In this study, we combined PET, desorption electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (DESI-MS), nonimaging MS, and transcriptomic analyses to interrogate changes in lipid  in a transgenic zebrafish model of oncogenic RAS-driven melanocyte neoplasia progression. Exogenous fatty  uptake was detected in melanoma tumor nodules by PET using the  surrogate tracer 14(R,S)-18F-fluoro-6-thia-heptadecanoic  ([18F]-FTHA), consistent with upregulation of genes associated with fatty  uptake found through microarray analysis. DESI-MS imaging revealed that FTHA uptake in tumors was heterogeneous. Transcriptome and lipidome analyses further highlighted dysregulation of glycerophospholipid  in melanoma tumor nodules, including increased abundance of phosphatidyl ethanolamine and phosphatidyl choline species, corroborated by DESI-MS, which again revealed heterogeneous phospholipid composition in tumors. Overexpression of the gene encoding lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which was upregulated in zebrafish melanocyte tumor nodules and expressed in the majority of human melanomas, accelerated progression of oncogenic RAS-driven melanocyte neoplasia in zebrafish. Depletion or antagonism of LPL suppressed human melanoma cell growth; this required simultaneous fatty  synthase (FASN) inhibition when FASN expression was also elevated. Collectively, our findings implicate fatty  acquisition as a possible therapeutic target in melanoma, and the methods we developed for monitoring fatty  uptake have potential for diagnosis, patient stratification, and monitoring pharmacologic response.

This study elucidated the mechanisms of brain and muscle Arnt-like protein-1 (Bmal1) in the protective effects of RES against liver lipid  disorders. The results indicated that RES ameliorated free fatty  (FFA)-induced (oleic  (OA):  (PA) = 2:1) glycolipid  disorders in hepatocytes. Simultaneously, RES partially reverted the relatively shallow daily oscillations of FFA-induced circadian clock gene transcription and protein expression in HepG2 cells. RES also attenuated FFA-triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS) secretion and restored mitochondrial membrane potential consumption, as well as the restoration of mitochondrial respiratory complex expression. This study provides compelling evidence that RES controls intracellular lipid  imbalance in a Bmal1-dependent manner. Overall, RES may serve as a promising natural nutraceutical for the regulation of lipid  disorders relevant to the circadian clock.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30677272>[Atherosclerosis and atheromatosis are consequtive  disordes. Pathology of the biological functions of trophology and endoecology is the basis for ischemic heart disease prevention.]</a></h2><p>Atherosclerosis and atheromatosis are different nonphysiological processes with different etiology and pathogenesis. They manifest alterations in different biological functions. According to our original phylogenetic theory of general pathology, atherosclerosis is associated with altered biological function of trophology, eating, biological reaction of exotrophy. Atherosclerosis is induced by eating of nonoptimal for phylogenetically herbivorous Homo sapiens meat diet with high content of  saturated fatty  (SFA), which leads to in vivo formation of phylogenetically early low-efficient  pathway of FA  instead of highly-efficient oleic pathway operating in herbivores. Accumulation of nonligand  very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and low density lipoproteins (LDL) in the bloodstream results from nonphysiological reaction of compensation upon transport of  SFA to cells. An increase in blood content of  triglycerides (TG) and nonligand  VLDLЛ→LDL coincides with the development of hypercholesterolemia: type IV→ type IIb → type V. Atheromatosis compensates changes in lipoproteins by activation of the biological function of endoecology (purity of the extracellular medium) in vivo, thus fulfilling the biological reaction of inflammation. This is physiological denaturation of apoВ-100 in nonligand VLDL→LDL by neutrophils via peroxidation, opsonization by the complement components, transcytosis across the endothelial monolayer and removal to the intima of elastic arteries that serves as a collection and utilization pool for phogogens from local intravascular pool of the intercellular medium. Endogenous phlogogens are utilized by phylogenetically early polyfunctional resident macrophages which are small in number and do not proliferate. Blood-borne monocytes-macrophages are also involved in this process, however, they do not express  hydrolase of polyenic cholesteryl esters. Atheromatous masses are partially catabolized polyenic FA esterified by the alcohol cholesterol which were not internalized by cells. Atheromatosis is a process of pathological compensation in the realization of the function of endoecology. Prevention of atherosclerosis and atheromatosis should be based on elimination of the effects produced by a nonphysiological meat diet.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31519174>Diosgenin ameliorates -induced lipid accumulation via AMPK/ACC/CPT-1A and SREBP-1c/FAS signaling  in LO2 cells.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease and is characterized by excessive hepatic lipid accumulation.

The effects of DSG on lipid , glucose uptake and mitochondrial function were evaluated. Furthermore, the mechanism of DSG on oxidative stress, lipid consumption and lipid synthesis in LO2 cells was investigated.The results indicated that  induced obvious lipid accumulation in LO2 cells and that DSG treatment significantly reduced the intracellular lipid content. DSG treatment upregulated expression of lipolysis proteins, including phospho-AMP activated protein kinase (p-AMPK), phospho-acetyl-coA carboxylase (p-ACC) and carnitine acyl transferase 1A (CPT-1A), and inhibited expression of lipid synthesis-related proteins, including sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) and fatty  synthase (FAS). Additionally, DSG-treated cells displayed a marked improvement in mitochondrial function, with less production of reactive oxygen species and a higher mitochondrial membrane potential compared with the model group.This study suggests that DSG can reduce intracellular lipid accumulation in LO2 cells and that the underlying mechanism may be related to the improving oxidative stress, increasing fatty  β-oxidation and decreasing lipid synthesis.

Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), is a well-known fatty  amide-signaling molecule that possess an important anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. PEA does not hold the ability to inhibit free radicals formation. Baicalein, a bioactive component isolated from a Chinese herbal medicine, has multiple pharmacological activities, such as a strong anti-oxidative effects.A combination of PEA and Baicalein could have beneficial effects on oxidative stress produced by inflammatory response.In the present study we explored the effects of composite containing PEA and Baicalein in a model of myocardial I/R injury.Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury was induced by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 30 min followed by 2 h of reperfusion. PEA-Baicalein (9:1), was administered (10 mg/kg) 5 min before the end of ischemia and 1 h after reperfusion.In this study, we clearly demonstrated that PEA-Baicalein treatment decreases myocardial tissue injury, neutrophils infiltration, markers for mast cell activation expression as chymase and tryptase and pro-inflammatory cytokines production (TNF-α, IL-1β). Moreover, PEA-Baicalein treatment reduces stress oxidative and modulates Nf-kB and apoptosis .These results support the idea that the association between PEA and Baicalein should be a potent candidate for the treatment of myocardial I/R injury.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

To investigate mechanisms linking dyslipidemia, oxidative stress and macrophage activation through modulation of immunemetabolism, and to explore therapeutic potential targeting specific  .  Using a combination of biochemical, immunological, and ex vivo cell  studies, we report that CD36 mediates a mitochondrial  switch from oxidative phosphorylation to superoxide production in response to its ligand, oxLDL. Mitochondrial-specific inhibition of superoxide inhibited oxLDL-induced NF-κB activation and inflammatory cytokine generation. RNAseq, flow cytometry, H-labeled  uptake, lipidomic analysis, confocal and EM imaging, and functional energetics revealed that oxLDL upregulated effectors of long-chain fatty  (FA) uptake and mitochondrial import, while downregulating FA oxidation and inhibiting ATP5A, an electron transport chain (ETC) component. The combined effect is long-chain FA accumulation, alteration of mitochondrial structure and function, repurposing of the ETC to superoxide production, and NF-κB activation. Apoe null mice challenged with high fat diet showed similar  changes in circulating Ly6C monocytes and peritoneal macrophages, along with increased CD36 expression. Moreover, mitochondrial ROS was positively correlated with CD36 expression in aortic lesional macrophages.  These findings reveal that oxLDL/CD36 signaling in macrophages links dys-regulated FA  to oxidative stress from the mitochondria, which drives chronic inflammation.

At least in the case of COX-2, the enzyme becomes folded into a stable Eallo/Ecat pair. Some COX inhibitors ( nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and coxibs) and common fatty acids (FAs) modulate Ecat activity by binding Eallo. However, the interactions and outcomes often differ between isoforms. For example, naproxen directly and completely inhibits COX-1 by binding Ecat but indirectly and incompletely inhibits COX-2 by binding Eallo. Additionally, COX-1 is allosterically inhibited up to 50% by common FAs like , whereas COX-2 is allosterically activated 2-fold by . FA binding to Eallo also affects responses to COX inhibitors. Thus, COXs are physiologically and pharmacologically regulated by the FA tone of the milieu in which each operates-COX-1 in the endoplasmic reticulum and COX-2 in the Golgi apparatus. Cross-talk between Eallo and Ecat involves a loop in Eallo immediately downstream of Arg-120. Mutational studies suggest that allosteric modulation requires a direct interaction between the carboxyl group of allosteric effectors and Arg-120 of Eallo; however, structural studies show some allosterically active FAs positioned in COX-2 in a conformation lacking an interaction with Arg-120. Thus, many details about the biological consequences of COX allosterism and how ligand binding to Eallo modulates Ecat remain to be resolved.© 2019 Smith and Malkowski.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480145>Metabolomics reveals potential biomarkers in the rumen fluid response to different milk production of dairy cows.</a></h2><p>In the present study, an LC/MS metabolomics approach was performed to investigate potential biomarkers of milk production in high- and low-milk-yield dairy cows and to establish correlations among rumen fluid metabolites; the results of this study provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the milk production-related characteristics of rumen fluid in dairy cows.

On day 21, rumen fluid metabolites were quantified applying LC/MS. The principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least-squares (OPLS-DA) showed significantly separated clusters of the ruminal metabolite profiles of HY and LY groups.

Even though NAFLD is strongly associated with obesity and  syndrome, there is a proportion of patients who develop this condition in the absence of obesity and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We investigated early events in the pathogenesis of non-obese NAFLD, analyzing the impact of the chronic intake of a moderate fat-enriched diet on hepatic lipid accumulation and their relationship with inflammation. Rabbits fed with a moderate Fatty-- Enriched Diet 3%  (FAED), were evaluated for body weight, biochemical parameters, and liver function. Liver samples were analyzed by histology and RT-qPCR to measure lipid accumulation, the expression of inflammation-related genes IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, IL-18, COX-2, TNF-α, and TLR-4. Chronic consumption by 6-months of FAED did not generate  changes, but it induced fatty liver. We also observed the development of low-grade inflammation characterized by the up regulation of TNF-α, IL-13 and IL-18. The consumption by 12-months of FAED caused the overexpression of IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, COX-2, and TLR-4. We show that hepatic steatosis is an early consequence of fat-enriched diets, and that it is accompanied by an immune response that exerts protective effects that prevent the development of  disorders, such as overweight/obesity and  syndrome. However, the excessive intake of fatty acids renders these mechanisms less efficient for delaying the start of  alterations. Rabbits fed with FAED can be used as a model of NAFLD in non-obese and obese groups, especially at early stages of the disease.Copyright © 2019.

MIP-1α induction was significantly suppressed when cells were treated with anti-TLR4 antibody prior stimulation with palmitate. Using TLR4 siRNA, we further demonstrate that palmitate-induced MIP-1α expression in monocytic cells requires TLR4. Moreover, THP1 cells defective in MyD88, a major adaptor protein involved in TLR4 signaling, were unable to induce MIP-1α production in response to palmitate. Palmitate-induced MIP-1α expression was suppressed by inhibition of MAPK, NFkB and PI3K signaling . In addition, palmitate-induced NF-κB/AP-1 activation was observed while production of MIP-1α. However, this activation of NF-κB/AP-1 was abrogated in MyD88 deficient cells.Overall, these results show that palmitate induces TLR4dependent MIP-1α expression requiring the MyD88 recruitment and activation of MAPK, NF-κB/AP-1 and PI3K signaling.

This indicates that the related two algae would have different enzyme systems or substrate composition. To carry out more in-depth discussions on the  pathway of eicosanoids between the two algae, we investigated the characteristics of glycerolipids, which are the substrates of eicosanoids production, of  and compared them to the reported values of . In , monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG), sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol (SQDG), and phosphatidylcholine (PC) were the major lipid classes and accounted for 44.4% of the total lipid extract. The predominant fatty acids were arachidonic  (20:4n-6), an eicosanoids precursor, and  (16:0). The 20:4n-6 content was extremely high in MGDG and PC (>70%), and the 16:0 content was extremely high in DGDG and SQDG (>40%). A chiral-phase HPLC analysis showed that fatty acids were esterified at the -1 and -2 positions of those lipids. The glycerolipid molecular species were determined by reversed-phase HPLC⁻ESI⁻MS analysis. The main glycerolipid molecular species were 20:4n-6/20:4n-6 (-1/-2) for MGDG (63.8%) and PC (48.2%), 20:4n-6/16:0 for DGDG (71.1%) and SQDG (29.4%). These lipid characteristics of  were almost the same as those of . Hence, the differences of the eicosanoids producing ability between the two algae would not be due to the difference of substrate composition but the difference of enzyme system.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31374067>Serum metabolome and targeted bile  profiling reveals potential novel biomarkers for drug-induced liver injury.</a></h2><p>This study aims to determine the non-invasive, reliable and sensitive biochemical parameters for the diagnosis of drug-induced liver injury (DILI).Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) and selected reaction monitoring (SRM) were used to profile the serum metabolome and quantify 15 targeted bile  metabolites, respectively, in samples obtained from 38 DILI patients and 30 healthy controls.A comparison of the resulting serum metabolome profiles of the study participants revealed significant differences between DILI patients and healthy controls. Specifically, serum , taurochenodeoxycholic , glycocholic  (GCA), and tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) levels were significantly higher, and serum lysophosphatidylethanolamine levels were significantly lower in DILI patients vs healthy controls (P < .001). Furthermore, the SRM assay of bile acids revealed that the increase in GCA, taurocholic  (TCA), TUDCA, glycochenodeoxycholic  (GCDCA), glycochenodeoxycholic sulfate (GCDCS), and taurodeoxycholic  (TDCA) corresponded to a higher degree of liver damage. These results also indicate that serum concentrations of chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), deoxycholic  (DCA) and lithocholic  (LCA) were significantly lower in patients with severe DILI, when compared to healthy controls, and that this decrease was closely correlated to the severity of liver damage.Taken together, these results demonstrate that bile acids could serve as potential biomarkers for the early diagnosis and severity of DILI.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31073968>-Induced NAD Depletion is Associated with the Reduced Function of SIRT1 and Increased Expression of BACE1 in Hippocampal Neurons.</a></h2><p>Increased levels of circulating fatty acids, such as  (PA), are associated with the development of obesity, insulin resistance, type-2 diabetes and  syndrome. Furthermore, these diseases are linked to an increased risk of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, mild cognitive impairment and even Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the precise actions of elevated PA levels on neurons and their association with neuronal  disruption that leads to the expression of pathological markers of AD, such as the overproduction and accumulation of the amyloid-β peptide, represent an area of intense investigation. A possible molecular mechanism involved in the effects of PA may be through dysfunction of the NAD sensor enzyme, SIRT1. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to analyze the relationship between the effects of PA  on the function of SIRT1 and the upregulation of BACE1 in cultured hippocampal neurons. PA reduced the total amount of NAD in neurons that caused an increase in p65 K310 acetylation due to inhibition of SIRT1 activity and low protein content. Furthermore, BACE1 protein and its activity were increased, and BACE1 was relocated in neurites after PA exposure.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31298959>Electric pulse stimulation inhibited lipid accumulation on C2C12 myotubes incubated with oleic  and .</a></h2><p> To investigate the effect of electrical pulse stimulation (EPS) on lipid accumulation and alteration of fatty -related enzymes in C2C12 myotubes incubated with fatty acids.

Oken leaves.</a></h2><p>Holigarna caustica (Dennst.) is commonly used in traditional medicine to treat a variety of painful conditions such as eye irritation, inflammation, arthritis, skin diseases, cuts and wounds.The present study was undertaken to investigate the anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities of the methanol extract of H. caustica leaves and to elucidate its possible mechanism(s) of action.Fresh leaves of H. caustica were collected, dried, and extracted with methanol (MEHC). MEHC was subjected to activity testing, using chemical-induced (acetic  and formalin test) and heat-induced (hot plate and tail immersion test) pain models. To determine the possible mechanism behind the anti-nociceptive activity of MEHC, the opioid antagonist naltrexone was used to evaluate the involvement of opioid receptors in the case of formalin, hot plate and tail immersion tests, while the involvement of the cGMP and ATP-sensitive K channel  were assessed using methylene blue and glibenclamide respectively, in the acetic -induced writhing test. In parallel, the carrageenan-induced paw oedema model was used to determine the anti-inflammatory potential of the extract. Exploratory and motor behaviours were evaluated by the open-field test. Various bioactive compounds potentially responsible for the anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities were ascertained using GC-MS analysis.MEHC showed strong, significant and dose-dependent anti-nociceptive activity in all chemical-induced and heat-induced pain models at all experimental doses. The association of opioid receptors with the observed anti-nociceptive effects was confirmed by using naltrexone. The cGMP and ATP-sensitive K channel pathway was also shown to be involved in the anti-nociceptive activity of MEHC. In addition, MEHC exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of inflammatory oedema induced by carrageenan. MEHC was not connected with changes in either the locomotor activity or motor responses of mice. In a GC-MS analysis, 40 compounds were identified, among which twelve are documented bioactive compounds with potent analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties.Our current study revealed that MEHC possesses strong central and peripheral anti-nociceptive as well as anti-inflammatory activity. It may also be concluded that both opioid receptors as well as the cGMP and ATP-sensitive K channel pathway are involved in the anti-nociceptive mechanism of MEHC. This study rationalizes the ethnomedicinal use of H. caustica leaves in various painful conditions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The methanol extracts from the mycelia and spores of C. cladosporioides and P. lilacinum exhibited the highest insecticidal activity against A. gossypii compared with other extracts, which LC values were recorded to be 57.60 and 94.18 ppm, respectively. The major constituents identified in both methanol extracts by GC-MS analysis were linoleic  and . The methanol extracts of C. cladosporioides and P. lilacinum caused a voluminous increase in the total carbohydrates content of A. gossypii adults, while the total protein content was significantly decreased by both extracts. The activity of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were significantly reduced by methanol extracts. The P. lilacinum extract caused a considerable reduction in the activity of glutathione-S-transferase (GST), α- and β-esterase by 28.9, 27.9 and 23.4%, respectively.

C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD; 60 kcal% fat) for 14 weeks to induce obesity and were treated with or without LLE (100 or 200  mg/kg daily by oral gavage).HepG2 cells were exposed to 1 mM FFA, with or without LLE (250 - 1000  mg/ml). Intracellular lipid contents were measured by Oil Red O staining and a Nile Red assay. The body weight, relative liver weight, hepatic lipids, triglycerides (TGs), and total cholesterol (TC) were measured in the mice. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), TG, TC, glucose, insulin, leptin, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels were determined by biochemical or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Histologic analysis was performed in the liver. Western blotting and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to analyze the expression of key enzymes of hepatic lipid .LLE significantly decreased the intracellular lipid accumulation in FFA-treated HepG2 cells. LLE not only remarkably decreased the expression of lipogenesis genes but also increased β-oxidation in FFA-induced HepG2 cells. In the in vivo study, LLE treatment significantly decreased the body weight, relative liver weight, serum ALT, TC, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, as well as the serum glucose, insulin, leptin, and TNF-α levels in HFD-fed mice. The hepatic TG and TC contents were significantly reduced in the LLE-treated groups. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 1 decreased, while that of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α increased in the LLE-treated mice.These results suggest that LLE may exert protective effects against NAFLD-related obesity and  disease.Copyright © 2018.

Previous studies have indicated that neurodevelopment may also be impaired through alternative , including reduction of cAMP catalyzed downstream events. The upstream initiating events that underlie non-cholinergic neurological actions of chlorpyrifos and other organophosphorus compounds remain unclear. To investigate the potential role of disruption of fatty  signaling as a mechanism of toxicity, lipid  and fatty  profiles were examined to identify alterations that may play a critical role in upstream signaling in the CNS. Juvenile rainbow trout were treated for 7 days with nominal chlorpyrifos concentrations previously reported to diminish olfactory responses (10, 20, and 40 μg/L). While lethality was noted higher doses, measured chlorpyrifos concentrations of 1.38 μg/L (nominal concentration 10 μg/L) significantly reduced the activity of AChE and two serine lipases, monoacylglycerol lipase and fatty  amide hydrolase in the brain. Reductions in lysophosphatidylethanolamines (16:0; 18:0, 18:1, and 22:6) derived from the phosphatidylethanolamines and free fatty acids ( acid16:0; Linolenic acid18:3; Eicosadienoic  20:2; Arachidonic  20:4; and Docosahexaenoic  22:6) were also noted, suggesting that chlorpyrifos inhibited the  of selected phospholipid signaling precursors at sublethal concentrations. These results indicate that in addition to AChE inhibition, environmentally relevant chlorpyrifos exposure alters serine lipase activity and lipid metabolites in the trout brain, which may compromise neuronal signaling and impact neurobehavioral responses in aquatic animals.© The Author(s) 2019.

Comparison with palmitoleic and  acids evidenced that lipid remodelling was influenced by the type of fatty  and positional isomer, with an increase of 8-18:1, -10 PUFA and a decrease of saturated fats in case of sapienic . Cholesteryl esters were formed only in cases with sapienic . Sapienic  was the less toxic among the tested fatty acids, showing the highest ECs and inducing death only in 75% of cells at the highest concentration tested. Two-photon fluorescent microscopy with Laurdan as a fluorescent dye provided information on membrane fluidity, highlighting that sapienic  increases the distribution of fluid regions, probably connected with the formation of 8-18:1 and the -10 PUFA in cell lipidome.

Fatty acids incorporate into membrane and storage glycerolipids through a series of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) enzymes, but how these enzymes are regulated is not well understood. Here, using a combination of CRISPR-based genetic screens and unbiased lipidomics, we identified calcineurin B homologous protein 1 (CHP1) as a major regulator of ER glycerolipid synthesis. Loss of CHP1 severely reduces fatty  incorporation and storage in mammalian cells and invertebrates. Mechanistically, CHP1 binds and activates GPAT4, which catalyzes the initial rate-limiting step in glycerolipid synthesis. GPAT4 activity requires CHP1 to be N-myristoylated, forming a key molecular interface between the two proteins. Interestingly, upon CHP1 loss, the peroxisomal enzyme, GNPAT, partially compensates for the loss of ER lipid synthesis, enabling cell proliferation. Thus, our work identifies a conserved regulator of glycerolipid  and reveals plasticity in lipid synthesis of proliferating cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The object of the current research was to explore the effects of adelmidrol + sodium hyaluronate, on bladder damage generated after SCI in mice. Spinal cord was exposed via laminectomy, and SCI was induced by extradural compression at T6 to T7 level, by an aneurysm clip with a closing force of 24 g. Mice were treated intravesically with adelmidrol + sodium hyaluronate daily for 48 h and 7 days after SCI. Adelmidrol + sodium hyaluronate reduced significantly mast cell degranulation and down-regulated the nuclear factor-κB pathway in the bladder after SCI both at 48 h and 7days. Moreover, adelmidrol + sodium hyaluronate reduced nerve growth factor expression, suggesting an association between neurotrophins and bladder pressure. At 7 days after SCI, the bladder was characterized by a marked bacterial infection and proteinuria; surprisingly, adelmidrol + sodium hyaluronate reduced significantly both parameters.

Saturated fatty acids such as  (PA) activate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a cellular stress response associated with the development of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We tested the hypothesis that PA increases susceptibility to lung epithelial cell death and experimental fibrosis by modulating ER stress. Total liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry were used to measure fatty  content in IPF lungs. Wild-type mice were fed a high fat diet (HFD) rich in PA or a standard diet (SD) and subjected to bleomycin-induced lung injury. Lung fibrosis was determined by hydroxyproline content. Mouse lung epithelial cells were treated with PA. ER stress and cell death were assessed by Western blotting, TUNEL staining and cell viability assays. IPF lungs had a higher level of PA compared to controls. Bleomycin-exposed mice fed a HFD had significantly increased pulmonary fibrosis associated with increased cell death and ER stress compared to those fed a SD. PA increased apoptosis and activation of the unfolded protein response in lung epithelial cells. This was attenuated by genetic deletion and chemical inhibition of CD36, a fatty  transporter. In conclusion, consumption of a HFD rich in saturated fat increases susceptibility to lung fibrosis and ER stress and PA mediates lung epithelial cell death and ER stress via CD36.

Oxidative stress intensity (malondialdehyde - MDA concentration) was measured using spectrophotometric method. Intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in macrophages was visualized by fluorescence microscopy and quantitatively measured by plate reader.Pb caused quantitative alterations in FAs profile in macrophages; the effect was Pb-concentration dependent and selective (i.e. concerned only selected FAs). In general, the effect of Pb was biphasic, with Pb levels of 1.25 μg/dL and 2.5 μg/dL being stimulatory, and 10 μg/dL being inhibitory on concentrations of selected FAs. The most potent Pb concentration, resulting in increase in levels of 9 FAs, was 2.5 μg/dL, the Pb-level corresponding to the mean blood Pb concentrations of people living in urban areas not contaminated by Pb. Pb was found to exert similar, biphasic effect on the expression of FADS1. However, Pb decreased, in a concentration-dependent manner, the expression of SCD and FADS2. Pb significantly increased MDA and ROS concentration in macrophages.Environmental Pb exposure might be a risk factor resulting in alterations in FAs levels, oxidative stress and increased MDA concentration in macrophages, which might lead to the formation of foam cells and to inflammatory reactions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Carbon monoxide releasing molecule-A1 (CORM-A1) has been reported to stimulate up-regulation and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in hepatocytes. However, the role of CORM-A1 in improving lipid , antioxidant signaling and mitochondrial functions in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is unknown. In this study, we report that CORM-A1 prevents hepatic steatosis in high fat high fructose (HFHF) diet fed C57BL/6J mice, used as model of NASH. The beneficial effects of CORM-A1 in HFHF fed mice was associated with improved lipid homeostasis, Nrf2 activation, upregulation of antioxidant responsive (ARE) genes and increased ATP production. As, mitochondria are intracellular source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and important sites of lipid , we further investigated the mechanisms of action of CORM-A1-mediated improvement in mitochondrial function in  (PA) treated HepG2 cells. Cellular oxidative stress and cell viability were found to be improved in PA + CORM-A1 treated cells via Nrf2 translocation and activation of cytoprotective genes. Furthermore, in PA treated cells, CORM-A1 improved mitochondrial oxidative stress, membrane potential and rescued mitochondrial biogenesis thru upregulation of Drp1, TFAM, PGC-1α and NRF-1 genes. CORM-A1 treatment improved cellular status by lowering glycolytic respiration and maximizing OCR. Improvement in mitochondrial respiration and increment in ATP production in PA + CORM-A1 treated cells further corroborate our findings. In summary, our data demonstrate for the first time that CORM-A1 ameliorates tissue damage in steatotic liver via Nrf2 activation and improved mitochondrial function, thus, suggesting the anti-NASH potential of CORM-A1.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In the present study, the parental and IDH1 (R132H/+) mutant HCT116 cells were treated with various concentrations of oleic  (OA) or  (PA) in the presence or absence of glucose. The results demonstrated that mutation of IDH1 exacerbated the effects of OA and PA on cell viability and apoptosis, and consistently elevated the production of reactive oxygen species in HCT116 cells, particularly in the absence of glucose. Furthermore, mutation of IDH1 inhibited the rate of fatty  oxidation (FAO), but elevated the glucose consumption in HCT116 cells. The results of immunoblotting and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) indicated that the expression of glucose transporter 1 was upregulated, whereas that of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 was downregulated in IDH1 mutant HCT116 cells. Although mitochondrial DNA quantification demonstrated that mutation of IDH1 had no effect on the quantity of mitochondria, immunoblotting and RT‑qPCR revealed that mutation of IDH1 in HCT116 cells significantly downregulated the expression of cytochrome c (CYCS) and CYCS oxidase IV, two important components in mitochondrial respiratory chain. These results indicated that mutation of IDH1 aggravated the fatty ‑induced oxidative stress in HCT116 cells, by suppressing FAO and disrupting the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The results of the present study may provide novel insight into therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cancer types with IDH mutation.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572539>Apigenin reduces the excessive accumulation of lipids induced by  via the AMPK signaling pathway in HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to diseases caused by excessive accumulation of lipids in the liver with therapeutic agents derived from natural products offering an alternative treatment to conventional therapies. Among these therapeutic agents, apigenin, a natural flavonoid, has been proven to exert various beneficial biological effects. In the present study, the antiadipogenic effects of apigenin in HepG2 cells was investigated. It was demonstrated that the treatment of cells with different concentrations of apigenin for 24 h significantly decreased the -induced increases in total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels as well as intracellular lipid accumulation. In addition, apigenin increased the phosphorylated-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) levels but decreased the expression levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1, fatty  synthase, and SREBP-2 in a concentration-dependent manner. The present findings suggested that apigenin might improve lipid  by activating the AMPK/SREBP pathway to reduce lipid accumulation in the liver.Copyright: © Lu et al.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p></html>
