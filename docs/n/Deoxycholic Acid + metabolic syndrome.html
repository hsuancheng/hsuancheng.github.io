The fundamental derangement in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is insulin resistance, a key component of the , which includes type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and obesity. The natural history of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is not always benign, and causality for chronic liver disease and cirrhosis is well known in clinical practice and sometimes it is accompanied by hepatocellular carcinoma. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is likely to be associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk, and it raises the possibility that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease may be not only a marker but also an early mediator of atherosclerosis.

While previous studies claimed that metformin decreases the chance of developing GD in PCOS patients, this phenomenon has not been investigated in animal models to date. Here we fed a high fat diet (HFD) containing 2% of cholesterol and 1% of cholic  to ten-week-old male C57Bl/6 mice for 105 days. The groups were as follows: Low fat diet; HFD; HFD + Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) (day 1-105); HFD + Metformin (day 1-105); HFD + Metformin (Met) (day 64-105). All drugs were administered by oral gavage (Met = 300 mg/kg & UDCA = 750 mg/kg). Serum lipid profile and gross organ examination were performed after euthanasia. A microscopic evaluation of the paraffin-embedded gallbladders was done after hematoxylin & eosin and Von Kossa staining. HFD successfully induces gallstone (4 out of 4 of the HFD members). While both UDCA and metformin (d 1-105) prevented gallstone formation and cholecystitis, Metformin (d 64-105) group had a few small stones. Additionally, metformin induces mucosal calcification in gallbladder (porcelain GB) of more than 80% of the HFD + Met (day 1-105) and HFD + Met (day 64-105) groups, collectively, which can be a potential problem by itself. While metformin shows a noticeable benefit towards GB health by reducing the chance for gallstone formation, if it induces porcelain gallbladder in humans as well, it might inflict patients with preventable medical charges.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

These organs have been shown to have increased susceptibility to cold ischemia/reperfusion (CIR) injury in comparison with otherwise comparable lean livers; the mechanisms governing this increased susceptibility to CIR injury are not fully understood. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is an important link between hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and . In this study, we investigated ER stress signaling and blockade in the mediation of CIR injury in severely steatotic rodent allografts. Steatotic allografts from genetically leptin-resistant rodents had increased ER stress responses and increased markers of hepatocellular injury after liver transplantation into strain-matched lean recipients. ER stress response components were reduced by the chemical chaperone taurine-conjugated ursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), and this resulted in an improvement in the allograft injury. TUDCA treatment decreased nuclear factor kappa B activation and the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 and interleukin-1β. However, the predominant response was decreased expression of the ER stress cell death mediator [CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP)]. Furthermore, activation of inflammation-associated caspase-11 was decreased, and this linked ER stress/CHOP to proinflammatory cytokine production after steatotic liver transplantation. These data confirm ER stress in steatotic allografts and implicate this as a mediating mechanism of inflammation and hepatocyte death in the steatotic liver allograft.Copyright © 2011 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25551852>Epstein Barr virus infection reactivation as a possible trigger of primary biliary cirrhosis-like  in a patient with multiple sclerosis in the course of fingolimod treatment.</a></h2><p>Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and multiple sclerosis (MS) are considered autoimmune diseases with a multifactorial aetiology which is thought to be due to a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental triggers.

Recent data suggest that faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) using faeces from postbariatric surgery diet-induced obese mice in germ-free mice improves glucose metabolism and intestinal homeostasis. We here investigated whether allogenic FMT using faeces from post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass donors (RYGB-D) compared with using faeces from  donors (METS-D) has short-term effects on glucose metabolism, intestinal transit time and adipose tissue inflammation in treatment-naïve, obese, insulin-resistant male subjects.Subjects with  (n=22) received allogenic FMT either from RYGB-D or METS-D. Hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity as well as lipolysis were measured at baseline and 2 weeks after FMT by hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic stable isotope (H-glucose and H-glycerol) clamp. Secondary outcome parameters were changes in resting energy expenditure, intestinal transit time, faecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and bile acids, and inflammatory markers in subcutaneous adipose tissue related to intestinal microbiota composition. Faecal SCFA, bile acids, glycaemic control and inflammatory parameters were also evaluated at 8 weeks.We observed a significant decrease in insulin sensitivity 2 weeks after allogenic METS-D FMT (median rate of glucose disappearance: from 40.6 to 34.0 µmol/kg/min; p<0.01). Moreover, a trend (p=0.052) towards faster intestinal transit time following RYGB-D FMT was seen. Finally, we observed changes in faecal bile acids (increased lithocholic,  and (iso)lithocholic  after METS-D FMT), inflammatory markers (decreased adipose tissue chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) gene expression and plasma CCL2 after RYGB-D FMT) and changes in several intestinal microbiota taxa.Allogenic FMT using METS-D decreases insulin sensitivity in  recipients when compared with using post-RYGB-D. Further research is needed to delineate the role of donor characteristics in FMT efficacy in human insulin-resistant subjects.NTR4327.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Clinical measures included weight gain and stool studies. Histologic features were assessed. Ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was used to determine bile  composition in end point bile and portal serum samples. Gene expression of key FXR targets was assessed in intestinal and hepatic tissues via quantitative polymerase chain reaction.OCA-treated SBS piglets showed decreased stool fat and altered liver histology when compared with nontreated SBS piglets. OCA prevented SBS-associated taurine depletion, however, further analysis of bile and portal serum samples indicated that OCA did not prevent SBS-associated alterations in bile  composition. The expression of FXR target genes involved in bile  transport and synthesis increased within the liver of SBS piglets after OCA administration whereas, paradoxically, intestinal expression of FXR target genes were decreased by OCA administration.Administration of OCA in SBS reduced fat malabsorption and altered bile  composition, but did not prevent the development of SBS-ALDs.

From the spectrum of NAFLD, only patients with biopsy-proven NASH (estimated prevalence in the US population is about 3-5%) have been convincingly shown to progress to cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. The clinical manifestation of NAFLD is usually absent or subtle, with abnormal aminotransferases or incidental radiographic findings of fatty liver. The pathogenesis of NAFLD is attributed to a multi-hit process involving insulin resistance, oxidative stress, apoptotic pathways, and adipocytokines.

Gut microbial communities contribute to human metabolism through fermentation of dietary fibre and the result of intestinal saccharolytic fermentation is production of SCFA. Acetate, propionate and butyrate positively influence satiety, endocrine system, glucose homeostasis, adipogenesis, lipid oxidation, thermoregulation, hepatic gluconeogenesis, endothelial function and gut barrier integrity, and these mechanisms have all been linked to protection from type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular health. The gut microbiota is also involved in bile  metabolism and regulating their cell signalling potential, which has also been shown to modify pathways involved in  health. Similarly, the gut microbiota renders recalcitrant plant polyphenols into biologically active small phenolic compounds which then act systemically to reduce  disease risk.

Our focus revolves around the interaction of the gut microbiota with liver diseases, especially cirrhosis. The bile  pool size has recently been shown to be a function of microbial metabolism of bile , and regulation of the microbiota by bile acids is important in the development and progression of several liver diseases. Humans produce a large, conjugated hydrophilic bile  pool, maintained through positive-feedback antagonism of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in the intestine and liver. Microbes use bile acids, and via FXR signaling this results in a smaller, unconjugated hydrophobic bile  pool. This equilibrium is critical to maintain health. The challenge is to examine the manifold functions of gut bile acids as modulators of antibiotic, probiotic, and disease progression in cirrhosis, , and alcohol use. Recent studies have shown potential mechanisms explaining how perturbations in the microbiome affect bile  pool size and composition. With advancing liver disease and cirrhosis, there is dysbiosis in the fecal, ileal, and colonic mucosa, in addition to a decrease in bile  concentration in the intestine due to the liver problems. This results in a dramatic shift toward the Firmicutes, particularly Clostridium cluster XIVa, and increasing production of . Alcohol intake speeds up these processes in the subjects with and without cirrhosis without significant FXR feedback. Taken together, these pathways can impact intestinal and systemic inflammation while worsening dysbiosis. The interaction between bile acids, alcohol, cirrhosis, and dysbiosis is an important relationship that influences intestinal and systemic inflammation, which in turn determines progression of the overall disease process. These interactions and the impact of commonly used therapies for liver disease can provide insight into the pathogenesis of inflammation in humans.2015 S.

The prevalence of NAFLD in Japan has nearly doubled in the last 10-15 years. Increasing evidence supports undernourishment in utero being causatively connected with the risk of NAFLD in later life. Low body mass index (BMI) has been common among Japanese women of childbearing age for several decades due to their strong desire to be thin. It is plausible that insufficient maternal energy intake by pregnant Japanese women may underlie the rapid increase in the prevalence of NAFLD in Japan. In order to clarify the mechanisms by which undernourishment in utero primes adult hepatic steatosis, we developed a mouse model of fetal undernourishment with a hepatic fat deposit-prone phenotype on an obesogenic high fat diet in later life. We found that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response parameters were activated concomitantly with the deterioration of hepatic steatosis and also that the alleviation of ER stress with the chemical chaperone, tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), significantly improved hepatic steatosis. Therefore, undernourishment in utero may program the future integration of ER stress in the liver on an obesogenic diet in later life and also induce the deterioration of hepatic steatosis. These results also provide an insight into interventions for the potential high-risk population of NAFLD, such as those born small or exposed to maternal undernourishment during the fetal period, with the alleviation of ER stress by dietary supplements and/or specific food including chaperones.© 2016 Japanese Teratology Society.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26595891>High-fat Diet-induced Intestinal Hyperpermeability is Associated with Increased Bile Acids in the Large Intestine of Mice.</a></h2><p> is characterized by low-grade chronic systemic inflammation, which is associated with intestinal hyperpermeability.

C57/BL6 mice were fed the control diet, HFD (soybean oil), HFD (lard), and HFD (mix; containing equal concentrations of soybean oil and lard) for 8 wk. Glucose tolerance, intestinal permeability, TJ protein expression, and cecal BA concentration were evaluated. Feeding with the 3 HDFs similarly increased body weight, liver weight, and fat pad weight, and induced glucose intolerance and intestinal hyperpermeability. The expression of TJ proteins, zonula occludens-2 and junctional adhesion molecule-A, were lower in the colons of the 3 HFD groups than in the control group (P < 0.05), and these changes appeared to be related to intestinal hyperpermeability. Feeding with HFDs increased total secondary BA (SBA) and total BA concentrations along with increases in some individual BAs in the cecum. Significant positive correlations between intestinal permeability and the concentrations of most SBAs, such as  and ω-muricholic acids, were detected (P < 0.05). These results suggest that the HFD-induced intestinal hyperpermeability is associated with increased BA secretion.

The effects were accentuated by uninephrectomy. In human renal biopsies, staining of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), glucose-regulated protein 78 (Grp78), and C/EBP-homologous protein, markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress, was more prominent in the proximal tubules of 15 obese patients compared with 16 non-obese patients. In mice treated with the FXR agonist obeticholic , renal injury, renal lipid accumulation, apoptosis, and changes in lipid peroxidation were attenuated. Moreover, disturbed mitochondrial function was ameliorated and the mitochondrial respiratory chain recovered following obeticholic  treatment.

A recently established rabbit model of high fat diet (HFD)-induced MetS showed hypogonadism and the presence of prostate gland alterations, including inflammation, hypoxia and fibrosis. The present study investigated whether HFD-induced MetS might also alter bladder structure and function. Testosterone and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist INT-747, were evaluated for possible effects on HFD bladder. MetS rabbits develop bladder alterations, including fibrosis (reduced muscle/fiber ratio), hypoxia [2-fold increase as compared to regular diet (RD) group], low-grade inflammation (increased leukocyte infiltration and inflammatory markers) and RhoA/ROCK hyperactivity. Bladder strips from HFD rabbits, pre-contracted with carbachol, showed an overactive response to the selective ROCK inhibitor Y-27632. All these HFD-induced bladder alterations were partially blunted by testosterone and almost completely reverted by INT-747. Both treatments prevented some MetS features (glucose intolerance and visceral fat increase), thus suggesting that their effects on bladder could be ascribed to an improvement of the  and/or hypogonadal state. However, a pathogenetic role for hypogonadism has been ruled out as GnRH analog-induced hypogonadal rabbits, fed a regular diet, did not show any detectable bladder alterations. In addition, INT-747 did not revert the MetS-induced hypogonadal state. FXR mRNA was highly expressed in rabbit bladder and positively associated with visceral fat increase. A direct effect of INT-747 on bladder smooth muscle was further suggested by inhibition of RhoA/ROCK-mediated activity by in vitro experiments on isolated cells. In conclusion, HFD-related MetS features are associated to bladder derangements, which are ameliorated by testosterone or INT-747 administration.

NAFLD has such an epidemic prevalence as to make it impossible to screen general population looking for NAFLD cases. Conversely, focusing on those cohorts of individuals exposed to the highest risk of NAFLD could be a more rational approach. NAFLD, which can be diagnosed with either non-invasive strategies or through liver biopsy, is a pathogenically complex and clinically heterogeneous disease. The existence of  as opposed to genetic-associated disease, notably including "lean NAFLD" has recently been recognized. Moreover, NAFLD is a systemic condition, featuring , cardiovascular and (hepatic/extra-hepatic) cancer risk. Among the clinico-laboratory features of NAFLD we discuss hyperuricemia, insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, gallstones, psoriasis and selected endocrine derangements. NAFLD is a precursor of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and  and progressive liver disease develops in T2D patients in whom the course of disease is worsened by NAFLD. Finally, lifestyle changes and drug treatment options to be implemented in the individual patient are also critically discussed. In conclusion, this review emphasizes the new concepts on clinical and pathogenic heterogeneity of NAFLD, a systemic disorder with a multifactorial pathogenesis and protean clinical manifestations. It is highly prevalent in certain cohorts of individuals who are thus potentially amenable to selective screening strategies, intensive follow-up schedules for early identification of liver-related and extrahepatic complications and in whom earlier and more aggressive treatment schedules should be carried out whenever possible.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24486698>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis as a novel player in -induced erectile dysfunction: an experimental study in the rabbit.</a></h2><p>A pathogenic link between erectile dysfunction (ED) and  (MetS) is now well established. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the hepatic hallmark of MetS, is regarded as an active player in the pathogenesis of MetS-associated cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study was aimed at evaluating the relationship between MetS-induced NASH and penile dysfunction. We used a non-genomic, high fat diet (HFD)-induced, rabbit model of MetS, and treated HFD rabbits with testosterone (T), with the selective farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist obeticholic  (OCA), or with the anti-TNFα mAb infliximab. Rabbits fed a regular diet were used as controls. Liver histomorphological and gene expression analysis demonstrated NASH in HFD rabbits. Several genes related to inflammation (including TNFα), activation of stellate cells, fibrosis, and lipid metabolism parameters were negatively associated to maximal acetylcholine (Ach)-induced relaxation in penis. When all these putative liver determinants of penile Ach responsiveness were tested as covariates in a multivariate model, only the association between hepatic TNFα expression and Ach response was confirmed. Accordingly, circulating levels of TNFα were increased 15-fold in HFD rabbits. T and OCA dosing in HFD rabbits both reduced TNFα liver expression and plasma levels, with a parallel increase of penile eNOS expression and responsiveness to Ach. Also neutralization of TNFα with infliximab treatment fully normalized HFD-induced hypo-responsiveness to Ach, as well as responsiveness to vardenafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor. Thus, MetS-induced NASH in HFD rabbits plays an active role in the pathogenesis of ED, likely through TNFα, as indicated by treatments reducing liver and circulating TNFα levels (T or OCA), or neutralizing TNFα action (infliximab), which significantly improve penile responsiveness to Ach in HFD rabbits.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Bile flowing from the liver is concentrated in the gallbladder and, in response to a meal, released into the upper intestine. In the intestines, bile acids act as detergents and help to emulsify fats, aiding in their digestion and absorption. After participating in digestion in the small bowel, bile acids are almost completely (95%) reabsorbed in the distal ileum and then retaken up from portal blood by the liver (enterohepatic circulation). The primary bile acids synthesized in the liver are cholic and chenodeoxycholic  which are typically conjugated to glycine or taurine before secretion. In the intestine, the primary bile acids are often converted by colonic bacteria to the secondary bile acids, predominantly  and lithocholic . The reabsorbed bile acids are transported to the liver in portal blood. Conjugated bile acids are then retaken up by hepatocytes via the sodium taurocholate cotransporter (NTCT), while unconjugated bile acids are taken up by organic anion transporters that also take up bilirubin and other anions. The total bile  pool in humans is tightly controlled by a coordinated regulation of expression of genes involved with synthesis, secretion, reabsorption and reuptake of bile acids by the liver. The major components of the bile  pool are cholic and chenodeoxycholic  with lesser amounts  and lithocholic  and minor amounts of ursodeoxycholic . Bile acids also act as signaling molecules and are important in regulation of their own synthesis, uptake and secretion as well as control of cholesterol synthesis and regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism. Bile  levels are increased in the serum and liver in patients with obstructive jaundice or cholestasis and, perhaps because of their inherent detergent activities, can cause hepatocyte injury. Thus, increased bile  levels in hepatocytes may account for some of the liver damage in cholestatic liver diseases. Bile acids can be used as therapeutic agents, particularly in patients with cholestatic liver diseases where administered bile acids (such as ursodeoxycholic ) replace the more lipophilic and toxic bile acids that accumulate during cholestasis. Bile acids are also useful for the medical treatment (dissolution) of gallstones by increasing bile  and decreasing cholesterol concentrations in bile (causing a less saturated bile). Bile acids can also be useful as replacement therapy in patients with bile  synthetic defects. Finally, the other  effects of bile acids can be useful in treating  diseases including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Four bile acids are currently approved for use in the United States and several others are under active investigation. Cholic  is used for treatment of inherited defects in bile  synthesis, chenodeoxycholic (chenodiol) and ursodeoxycholic (ursodiol)  for gallstone dissolution, and obeticholic and ursodiol for chronic cholestatic liver diseases, specifically primary biliary cirrhosis. Obeticholic  is under evaluation as therapy of other liver diseases including sclerosing cholangitis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Ursodiol is used off label to prevent, treat or ameliorate several uncommon forms of liver disease, including intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, sinusoidal obstruction , graft-vs-host disease, cystic fibrosis associated liver disease, parenteral nutrition related liver injury and even acute, drug induced liver injury. The long term efficacy in ameliorating the course of these diseases is, however, unproven. Separate documents are available in LiverTox for each of the currently available bile acids.

To further examine the mechanistic role of ER stress, changes in leptin receptor (ObR) signaling were also examined in wild-type mice treated with the ER chaperone tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), as well as in CHOP-/+ transgenic mice.Fragmented sleep in male mice induced increased food intake starting day 3 and thereafter, which was preceded by increases in ER stress and activation of all three UPR pathways in the hypothalamus. Although ObR expression was unchanged, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation was decreased, suggesting reduced ObR signaling. Unchanged suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) expression and increases in protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) expression and activity emerged with SF, along with reduced p-STAT3 responses to exogenous leptin. SF-induced effects were reversed following TUDCA treatment and were absent in CHOP -/+ mice.SF induces hyperphagic behaviors and reduced leptin signaling in hypothalamus that are mediated by activation of ER stress, and ultimately lead to increased PTP1B activity. ER stress pathways are therefore potentially implicated in SF-induced weight gain and  dysfunction, and may represent a viable therapeutic target.© 2014 Associated Professional Sleep Societies, LLC.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16393299>Review article: Drug therapy for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease represents a spectrum of liver diseases, characterized mainly by macrovesicular steatosis in the absence of significant alcohol ingestion. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease includes both non-alcoholic fatty liver and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis once considered a benign process is now known to lead to progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis. Histologically indistinguishable from alcoholic liver disease, the exact aetiology of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease remains unknown, but the fundamental pathophysiological process appears to be insulin resistance and oxidative stress related to the . Therapy has focused on risk factors, weight reduction and pharmacological intervention. Promising pharmacological treatments have been demonstrated with antioxidants, insulin sensitizers, hepatoprotectants and lipid-lowering agents. However, without larger randomized studies, no pharmacological treatments can be recommended at this time.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25202970>Ursodeoxycholic  ameliorates fructose-induced  in rats.</a></h2><p>The  (MS) is characterized by insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and hypertension. It is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and type-2 diabetes. Consumption of fructose is linked to increased prevalence of MS. Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is a steroid bile  with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory activities and has been shown to improve insulin resistance. The current study aims to investigate the effect of UDCA (150 mg/kg) on MS induced in rats by fructose administration (10%) in drinking water for 12 weeks. The effects of UDCA were compared to fenofibrate (100 mg/kg), an agonist of PPAR-α receptors. Treatment with UDCA or fenofibrate started from the 6th week after fructose administration once daily. Fructose administration resulted in significant increase in body weight, elevations of blood glucose, serum insulin, cholesterol, triglycerides, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), uric  levels, insulin resistance index and blood pressure compared to control rats. Moreover, fructose increased oxidative stress in aortic tissues indicated by significant increases of malondialdehyde (MDA), expression of iNOS and reduction of reduced glutathione (GSH) content. These disturbances were associated with decreased eNOS expression, increased infiltration of leukocytes and loss of aortic vascular elasticity. Treatment with UDCA successfully ameliorated the deleterious effects of fructose. The protective effect of UDCA could be attributed to its ability to decrease uric  level, improve insulin resistance and diminish oxidative stress in vascular tissues. These results might support possible clinical application of UDCA in MS patients especially those present with liver diseases, taking into account its tolerability and safety. However, further investigations on human subjects are needed before the clinical application of UDCA for this indication.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21560642>[Intrahepatic cholestasis in chronic liver diseases].</a></h2><p>The  of cholestasis is a common manifestation of chronic liver disease (CLD) of any etiology: alcoholic, viral, drug, , etc. The basis of the formation of cholestasis is a violation of the synthesis, secretion or bile outflow.

This study investigated the relationship between MetS and hypothalamic alterations in HFD-rabbits. Gonadotropin levels decreased as a function of MetS severity, hypothalamic gene expression of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). HFD determined a low-grade inflammation in the hypothalamus, significantly inducing microglial activation, expression and immunopositivity of IL-6, as well as GLUT4 and reduced immunopositivity for KISS1 receptor, whose mRNA expression was negatively correlated to glucose intolerance. Correcting glucose metabolism with obetcholic  improved hypothalamic alterations, reducing GLUT4 and IL-6 immunopositivity and significantly increasing GnRH mRNA, without, however, preventing HFD-related HH. No significant effects at the hypothalamic level were observed after systemic anti-inflammatory treatment (infliximab).

By degrading dietary substrates, the gut microbiota produces several metabolites that bind human pharmacological targets, impact subsequent signalling networks and in fine modulate host's metabolism. In this review, we revisit the pharmacological relevance of four classes of gut microbial metabolites in CMD: short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), bile acids, methylamines and indoles. Unravelling the signalling mechanisms of the microbial-mammalian  axis adds one more layer of complexity to the physiopathology of CMD and opens new avenues for the development of microbiota-based pharmacological therapies.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Classical symptoms include clinical or infraclinical xanthomas affecting the skin and tendons, early cataracts, neurological signs and diarrhea. Brain imaging reveals involvement of the dentate nuclei and periventricular white matter hyperintensities. The diagnosis is based on an increased cholestanol level in serum, confirmed by the presence of a mutation in the CYP27A1 gene. Treatment is based on chenodeoxycholic .We report a retrospective multicentric study of 15 cases of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis diagnosed in French adults. Clinical, molecular and MRI findings were recorded in all patients.The average age at diagnosis was 39years (range 27-65). Disease onset occurred in childhood in 73% of patients and in adulthood in 27%. All patients with a pediatric onset were diagnosed during adulthood (age range 28-65years). Clinical symptoms variably associated cerebellar , pyramidal , cognitive decline, epilepsy, neuropathy (sought in 10 of our patients, present in forms in 8), psychiatric disorders, cataract and xanthomas. One patient had an atypical presentation: monoparesis associated with xanthomas. Brain MRI was abnormal in all: findings consisted in T2-weighted hyperintensity of the dentate nuclei (47%), periventricular leuoencephalopathy (73%) which preferentially involved the posterior cerebral part (60%), leucoencephalopathy with a vascular pattern (7%), hyperintensity of the cortico-spinal tracts (53%), globi pallidi, corpus callosum and cerebral atrophy (33%).

Hence, accumulation of lipids in the liver is considered to be one of the risk factors for insulin resistance and . Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is widely used for the treatment of liver dysfunction. We investigated the therapeutic effects of UDCA on type 2 diabetes mellitus exacerbating hepatic steatosis and the underlying mechanisms of its action using KK-A(y) mice fed a high-fat diet. KK-A(y) mice were prefed a high-fat diet; and 50, 150, and 450 mg/kg of UDCA was orally administered for 2 or 3 weeks. Administration of UDCA decreased fasting hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp analyses showed that UDCA improved hepatic (but not peripheral) insulin resistance. Hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol contents were significantly reduced by treatment with UDCA, although the genes involved in the synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol, including fatty  synthase and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, were upregulated. Fecal levels of bile acids, neutral sterols, fatty acids, and phospholipids were significantly increased by UDCA treatment. The gene expression levels and protein phosphorylation levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress markers were not changed by UDCA treatment. These results indicate that UDCA ameliorates hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia by improving hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis in high-fat diet-fed KK-A(y) mice. Reduction of hepatic lipids might be due to their excretion in feces, followed by enhanced utilization of glucose for the synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol.

Because hamsters share many characteristic features of human lipid metabolism, we used a high-fructose-fed hamster model to study the impact of FXR activation with chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) on plasma lipoprotein metabolism. Male Syrian hamsters fed a diet containing 60% kcal from fructose for 2 wk developed hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia (+120 and +60%, P = 0.005 and 0.0004 vs. controls) due to increased hepatic lipoprotein production. This could be largely attributed to enhanced hepatic de novo lipogenesis, as indicated by increased expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1, fatty  synthase, and steaoryl-CoA desaturase-1. Lipoprotein analysis demonstrated that the increase in plasma triglycerides occurred in the VLDL density range, whereas increases in VLDL, IDL/LDL, and HDL cholesterol accounted for the elevated plasma cholesterol concentrations. Addition of 0.1% CDCA to the high-fructose diet decreased hepatic de novo lipogenesis and consequently triglyceride production and prevented the increases in plasma triglycerides and cholesterol (-40 and -18%, P = 0.03 and 0.03 vs. high fructose-fed animals). CDCA-treated animals had lower VLDL triglycerides and decreased VLDL and IDL/LDL cholesterol plasma concentrations.

Additionally, treatment with bile  receptor agonists has shown a decrease in the amount of atherosclerosis plaque formation and decreased portal vascular resistance and portal hypotension in animal models. Furthermore, rodent models have demonstrated antifibrotic activity using bile  receptor agonists. Early human data using a FXR agonist, obeticholic , have shown promising results with improvement of histological activity and even a reduction of fibrosis. Human studies are ongoing and will provide further information on bile  receptor agonist therapies. Thus, bile acids and their derivatives have the potential for management of liver diseases and potentially other disease states including diabetes and the .</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/942413>Synthesis of bile  monosulphates by the isolated perfused rat kidney.</a></h2><p>Perfusion of an isolated rat kidney with labelled bile acids, in a protein-free medium, resulted in the urinary excretion of the labelled bile , 3% being converted into polar metabolities in 1h. These metabolities were neither glycine nor taurine conjugates, nor bile  glucuronides, and on solovolysis yielded the free bile . On t.l.c. the metabolite of [24-14C]lithocholic  had the mobility of lithocholate 3-sulphate. The principal metabolite of [24-14C]chenodeoxycholic  had the mobility of chenodeoxycholate 7-sulphate; trace amounts appeared as chenodeoxycholate 3-sulphate. [35S]sulphate was incorporated in chenodeoxycholic  by the kidney, resulting in a similar pattern of sulphation. No disulphate salt of chenodeoxycholic  was detected. These findings lend support to the hypothesis that renal synthesis may account for some of the bile  sulphates present in urine in the cholestatic  in man.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28938442>Angiotensin II Causes β-Cell Dysfunction Through an ER Stress-Induced Proinflammatory Response.</a></h2><p>The  is associated with an increase in the activation of the renin angiotensin system, whose inhibition reduces the incidence of new-onset diabetes. Importantly, angiotensin II (AngII), independently of its vasoconstrictor action, causes β-cell inflammation and dysfunction, which may be an early step in the development of type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine how AngII causes β-cell dysfunction. Islets of Langerhans were isolated from C57BL/6J mice that had been infused with AngII in the presence or absence of taurine-conjugated ursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) and effects on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, inflammation, and β-cell function determined. The mechanism of action of AngII was further investigated using isolated murine islets and clonal β cells. We show that AngII triggers ER stress, an increase in the messenger RNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines, and promotes β-cell dysfunction in murine islets of Langerhans both in vivo and ex vivo. These effects were significantly attenuated by TUDCA, an inhibitor of ER stress. We also show that AngII-induced ER stress is required for the increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines and is caused by reactive oxygen species and IP3 receptor activation. These data reveal that the induction of ER stress is critical for AngII-induced β-cell dysfunction and indicates how therapies that promote ER homeostasis may be beneficial in the prevention of type 2 diabetes.Copyright © 2017 Endocrine Society.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28714405>Emerging Targets to Relieve Fat Stress-Induced Liver Diseases: UDCA, Tocotrienol, ω-3 PUFAs, and IgY Targeted NPC1L1 Cholesterol Transporter.</a></h2><p>Fat stress-induced liver disease is a hepatic manifestation of  initiated by excess fat accumulation and encompasses a wide spectrum of diseases from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, a precursor lesion progressing to more aggressive liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although the incidence of these fat stress-induced liver diseases is rapidly increasing worldwide in parallel with the growing epidemics of obesity and  diseases, its exact pathogenesis is not well defined. Although obesity, sedentary life-style, altered dietary pattern, insulin resistance, altered intestinal barrier function, inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress have been acknowledged as contributing factors because of the indefinite pathogenesis of  diseases, the only reliable treatment is lifestyle intervention composed of restrictive diet and exercise. Additionally, some existing medications such as pioglitazone and antioxidants such as vitamin E were reported to be effective; in this review, several novel agents especifically targeting nonalcoholic fatty liver disease pathogenesis under clinical trial will be introduced. These include an NPC1L1 blocker (ezetimibe), which significantly improved histological and symptomatic scores associated with steatohepatitis and fibrosis; clofibrate, phentoxyfylline, ursodeoxycholic , and tocopherol, all of which are prescribed to relieve fat stress; and additional IgY targeted NPC1L1, tocotrienol, ursodeoxycholic , and ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are actively under investigation to confirm the safety of long-term use.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28874313>New therapeutic perspectives in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Management of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is focused on restitution of  derangement, weight loss and drugs able to improve steatosis, ballooning and fibrosis.

Mutations in genes encoding for hepatobiliary transport systems can cause hereditary cholestatic syndromes and exposure to cholestatic agents (drugs, hormones, inflammatory cytokines) can lead to reduced expression and function of hepatic uptake and excretory systems in acquired forms of cholestasis. In addition to transporter changes which cause or maintain cholestasis, some alterations in transporter gene expression can be viewed as hepatoprotective mechanisms aimed at reducing intrahepatic accumulation of toxic biliary constituents such as bile acids and bilirubin. Alternative excretion of bile acids via the basolateral membrane into the systemic circulation facilitates the renal elimination of bile acids into urine. Moreover, increased bile  hydroxylation, sulfation and glucuronidation by phase I and II metabolizing enzymes renders bile acids more hydrophilic and less toxic. These molecular changes are mediated by specific nuclear receptors which are regulated by bile acids, proinflammatory cytokines, drugs, and hormones. In addition to transcriptional changes, reduced transporter protein insertion to or increased retrieval from the cell membrane as well as other mechanisms such as altered cell polarity, disruption of cell-to-cell junctions and cytoskeletal changes are involved in the pathogenesis of cholestasis. Understanding the detailed mechanisms regulating expression of transport systems and enzymes is essential for the development of novel therapeutic agents. Such future approaches could specifically target nuclear receptors thus restoring defective transporter expression and supporting hepatic defense mechanisms against toxic bile acids.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p></html>
