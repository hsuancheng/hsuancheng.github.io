Since its implication in inflammatory diseases is well recognized, many tools to regulate its biosynthesis have been developed and showed promising results in vitro and in vivo, but mixed results in clinical trials. Recently, the mTOR pathway component p70S6 kinase 1 (p70S6K1) has been linked to LTC4 synthase and the biosynthesis of cysteinyl-leukotrienes. In this respect, we investigated if p70S6K1 could also play a role in LTB4 biosynthesis. We thus evaluated the impact of the p70S6K1 inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 on LTB4 biosynthesis in human neutrophils. At a concentration of 10 μM, both compounds inhibited S6 phosphorylation, although neither one inhibited the thapsigargin-induced LTB4 biosynthesis, as assessed by the sum of LTB4, 20-OH-LTB4, and 20-COOH-LTB4. However, PF-4708671, but not LY2584702, inhibited the ω-oxidation of LTB4 into 20-OH-LTB4 by intact neutrophils and by recombinant CYP4F3A, leading to increased LTB4 levels. This was true for both endogenously biosynthesized and exogenously added LTB4. In contrast to that of , the inhibitory effect of PF-4708671 was easily removed by washing the neutrophils, indicating that PF-4708671 was a reversible CYP4F3A inhibitor. At optimal concentration, PF-4708671 increased the half-life of LTB4 in our neutrophil suspensions by 7.5 fold, compared to 5 fold for . Finally, Michaelis-Menten and Lineweaver-Burk plots indicate that PF-4708671 is a mixed inhibitor of CYP4F3A. In conclusion, we show that PF-4708671 inhibits CYP4F3A and prevents the ω-oxidation of LTB4 in cellulo, which might result in increased LTB4 levels in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29733200>Temporal Profiling Establishes a Dynamic S-Palmitoylation Cycle.</a></h2><p>S-palmitoylation is required for membrane anchoring, proper trafficking, and the normal function of hundreds of integral and peripheral membrane proteins. Previous bioorthogonal pulse-chase proteomics analyses identified Ras family GTPases, polarity proteins, and G proteins as rapidly cycling S-palmitoylated proteins sensitive to depalmitoylase inhibition, yet the breadth of enzyme regulated dynamic S-palmitoylation largely remains a mystery. Here, we present a pulsed bioorthogonal S-palmitoylation assay for temporal analysis of S-palmitoylation dynamics. Low concentration hexadecylfluorophosphonate (HDFP) inactivates the APT and ABHD17 families of depalmitoylases, which dramatically increases alkynyl-fatty acid labeling and stratifies S-palmitoylated proteins into kinetically distinct subgroups. Most surprisingly, HDFP treatment does not affect steady-state S-palmitoylation levels, despite inhibiting all validated depalmitoylating enzymes. S-palmitoylation profiling of APT1/APT2 mouse brains similarly show no change in S-palmitoylation levels. In comparison with hydroxylamine-switch methods, bioorthogonal alkynyl fatty acids are only incorporated into a small fraction of dynamic S-palmitoylated proteins, raising the possibility that S-palmitoylation is more stable than generally characterized. Overall, disrupting depalmitoylase activity enhances alkynyl fatty acid incorporation, but does not greatly affect steady state S-palmitoylation across the proteome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28698302>Heme Modification Contributes to the Mechanism-Based Inactivation of Human Cytochrome P450 2J2 by Two Terminal Acetylenic Compounds.</a></h2><p>The mechanism-based inactivation of human CYP2J2 by three terminal acetylenic compounds: -(methylsulfonyl)-6-(2-propargyloxyphenyl)hexanamide (MS),  (OD), and danazol (DZ) was investigated. The loss of hydroxyebastine (OHEB) carboxylation activity in a reconstituted system was time- and concentration-dependent and required NADPH for MS and OD, but not DZ. The kinetic constants for the mechanism-based inactivation of OHEB carboxylation activity were:  of 6.1 μM and  of 0.22 min for MS and  of 2.5 μM and  of 0.05 min for OD. The partition ratios for MS and OD were ∼10 and ∼20, respectively. Inactivation of CYP2J2 by MS or OD resulted in a loss of the native heme spectrum and a similar decrease in the reduced CO difference spectrum. A heme adduct was observed in the MS-inactivated CYP2J2. The possible reactive metabolite which covalently modified the prosthetic heme was characterized by analysis of the glutathione conjugates formed by MS or OD following oxygenation of the ethynyl moiety. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry showed that inactivation by MS or OD did not lead to modification of apoprotein. Interaction of CYP2J2 with DZ produced a type II binding spectrum with a  of 2.8 μM and the IC for loss of OHEB carboxylation activity was 0.18 μM. In conclusion, heme modification by MS and OD was responsible for the mechanism-based inactivation of CYP2J2. The results suggest that the ethynyl moiety of MS and OD faces the heme iron, whereas the isoxazole ring of DZ is preferentially oriented toward the heme iron of CYP2J2.Copyright © 2017 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28565971>Monodora myristica (African nutmeg) modulates redox homeostasis and alters functional chemistry in sickled erythrocytes.</a></h2><p>The antioxidative effect of Monodora myristica seed acetone extract and its effect on chemical functional groups were investigated in sickled erythrocytes as well as molecular modeling of the antisickling potentials of its secondary metabolites. The extract was subjected to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify the compounds present, which were then docked into the allosteric-binding site of deoxy-hemoglobin. The extract was incubated with sickled erythrocytes at 37°C for 6, 12, and 24 h and were subjected to antioxidative analysis for reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and lipid peroxidation (LPO). Chemical functional group of the treated cells was analyzed via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The predominant compounds identified were ; oleic acid, androstan-3-one, 17-hydroxy-2-methyl- (2.beta.,5.beta.,17.beta.)-; estran-3-one, 17-(acetyloxy)-2-methyl-, (2.alpha., 5.alpha., 17.beta.), and (+)-3-carene, 10-(acetylmethyl)-. They all fitted well within the active site of Hb with good binding affinity, as evidenced by the negative CDocker interaction energies of their complexes ranging between -54.4 and -26.7 kcal/mol. Treatment with the extract exacerbated SOD and catalase activities as well as GSH level, while LPO was suppressed. This antioxidative activity was time and/or dose dependent, with 6 and 12 h incubation showing the optimum activity. FTIR analysis of the treated cells showed the presence of hydrophobic functional groups. The synergetic molecular interaction of the major compounds of the extract with the α-dimer of Hb depicts an antisickling effect of M. myristica acetone extract. This is accompanied by exacerbation of endogenous antioxidant enzymes activity and modification of the functional chemistry of the cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29976573>A Specific Probe Substrate for Evaluation of CYP4A11 Activity in Human Tissue Microsomes and a Highly Selective CYP4A11 Inhibitor: Luciferin-4A and Epalrestat.</a></h2><p>The specificity of cytochrome P450 4A11 (CYP4A11) against luciferin-4A -demethylation in human liver microsomes (HLMs) and human renal microsomes (HRMs) and selectivity of CYP4A11 inhibition by epalrestat were investigated. Kinetic analysis of luciferin-4A -demethylation yielded  and  values of 39.7 pmol/min per milligram protein and 43.2 M for HLMs (Hill coefficient 1.24) and 39.4 pmol/min per milligram protein and 33.8 M for HRMs (Hill coefficient 1.34), respectively. Among the selective CYP inhibitors tested, HET0016 (CYP4 inhibitor) exclusively inhibited luciferin-4A -demethylation by HLMs and HRMs. Furthermore, anti-CYP4A11 antibody nearly abolished the activity of both tissue microsomes. Luciferin-4A -demethylase activity of HLMs was significantly correlated with lauric acid -hydroxylase activity, a marker of CYP4A11 activity ( = 0.904,  < 0.0001). Next, effects of epalrestat on CYP-mediated drug oxidations were examined. Epalrestat showed the most potent inhibition against CYP4A11 (IC = 1.82 M) among the 17 recombinant enzymes tested. The inhibitory effect of epalrestat on CYP4A11 was at least 10-fold stronger than those on CYP4F2, CYP4F3B, and CYP4F12. For known CYP4 inhibitors, in contrast, HET0016 inhibited the activities of CYP4A11 and CYP4F2 (IC = 0.0137-0.0182 M);  reduced activities of CYP4A11, CYP4F2, CYP4F3B, and CYP4F12 to a similar extent (IC = 5.70-17.7 M). Epalrestat selectively and effectively inhibited the CYP4A11 activity of HLMs (IC = 0.913 M) and HRMs (IC = 0.659 M). These results indicated that luciferin-4A -demethylase activity is a good CYP4A11 marker of HLMs and HRMs, and that epalrestat is a more selective CYP4A11 inhibitor compared with known CYP4 inhibitors.Copyright © 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p></html>
