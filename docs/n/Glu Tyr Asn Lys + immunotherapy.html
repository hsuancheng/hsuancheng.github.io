The search for peptides with GMDP-like adjuvant activity was performed using highly specific monoclonal antibodies against GMDP and combinatorial peptide libraries in the format of phage display. Various elution methods were used for the immunoaffinity enrichment of the libraries during the course of the preparation of highly active and specific peptides. A sole peptide (Arg-Val-Pro-Pro-Arg--His-Ala--Ile-Ser-Pro-Met-Val-, RN) was obtained by the elution of phage particles from the immunosorbent with a 1 -microM solution of the natural ligand (GMDP). Elution with a buffer with a low pH value (0.1 M glycine-HCl, pH 2.2) gave two other peptides: Ser-Gly-Arg-Val-Ala-Val-Ser-Pro-Asp-Ser-Pro-Leu-Phe--Pro (SP) and Arg--Gly-Gly-Ser-Val-Leu--Ile--Cys-Gln-Phe--Gly (RG). Affinity constants for the RN and SP peptides proved to be 3.6 x 10(8) and 3.5 x 10(8) M(-1), respectively. The specificity of the interaction with the monoclonal antibodies was checked by the competitive displacement of the peptides from the antigen-antibody complex by GMDP. The RN peptide exhibited adjuvant activity similar to that of GMDP, but had no pyrogenic effect characteristic of GMDP. The described method could be used for the search for mimetics of biologically active low-molecular compounds.</p><p>Keyword: immunotherapy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7768621>Construction of nontoxic derivatives of cholera toxin and characterization of the immunological response against the A subunit.</a></h2><p>Using computer modelling, we have identified some of the residues of the A subunit of cholera toxin (CT) and heat-labile toxin that are involved in NAD binding, catalysis, and toxicity. Here we describe the site-directed mutagenesis of the CT gene and the construction of CT mutants. Nine mutations of the A subunit gene were generated. Six of them encoded proteins that were fully assembled in the AB5 structure and were nontoxic; these proteins were CT-D53 (Val-53-->Asp), CT-K63 (Ser-63-->), CT-K97 (Val-97-->), CT-K104 (-104-->), CT-S106 (Pro-106-->Ser), and the double mutant CT-D53/K63 (Val-53-->Asp, Ser-63-->). Two of the mutations encoded proteins that were assembled into the AB5 structure but were still toxic; these proteins were CT-H54 (Arg-54-->His) and CT-N107 (His-107-->). Finally, one of the mutant proteins, CT-E114 (Ser-114-->), was unable to assemble the A and the B subunits and produced only the B oligomer. The six nontoxic mutants were purified from the culture supernatants of recombinant Vibrio cholerae strains and further characterized. The CT-K63 mutant, which was the most efficient in assembly of the AB5 structure, was used to immunize rabbits and was shown to be able to induce neutralizing antibodies against both the A and B subunits. This molecule may be useful for the construction of improved vaccines against cholera.</p><p>Keyword: immunotherapy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7840781>Short synthetic peptides exploited for reliable and specific targeting of antibodies to the C-termini of cytochrome P450 enzymes.</a></h2><p>An antibody was raised against a synthetic peptide (Ser-----Asp-) corresponding to residues 290-296 of the cytochrome P450 enzyme, CYP1A2, of both rat and mouse. A cysteine residue attached to the N-terminus of the peptide during synthesis allowed coupling in a specific orientation via the thiol group to the carrier protein, keyhole limpet haemocyanin. Antiserum raised in rabbits bound specifically to CYP1A2 in the rat and mouse. To determine those amino acid residues involved in binding of the antibody, related peptides of various lengths were synthesised and the binding of the antibody was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. These studies show that the minimum epitope is the C-terminal tripeptide sequence, -Asp-. Other than in rat and mouse CYP1A2, this tripeptide is found as an internal sequence in a large number of proteins including bovine fibronectin, chicken gizzard myosin heavy chain, and the P450 enzymes, rabbit CYP3A6 and human CYP3A4, but the antibody did not bind to any of these proteins. However, the antibody did bind to yeast glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in which the tripeptide sequence is the C-terminus. Antibodies raised against a truncated peptide (--Asp-), representing the C-terminal half of the peptide, also bound to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, but failed to bind to CYP1A2; thus although the C-terminal region of the peptide 290-296 is strongly immunogenic, it appears that it is not this population of antibodies that binds to CYP1A2. As antibodies were found to bind strongly to the C-terminus of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, the C-termini of proteins as targets for anti-peptide antibodies were investigated further by immunising rabbits with four 5-residue peptides which represent the C-termini of the P450 enzymes, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2E1 and CYP2A6. The peptides were coupled to keyhole limpet haemocyanin through their N-termini via cysteine residues added to the sequences. All four antisera bound specifically to their respective target proteins, as demonstrated by immunoblotting using hepatic microsomal fractions from rat, rabbit and human. It is suggested that this method of antibody production could be of general use for the reliable production of antisera against proteins where their sequence at the C-terminus is known, and such antibodies can be highly specific as they do not bind to internal sequences.</p><p>Keyword: immunotherapy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1975820>Regulatory function for murine intraepithelial lymphocytes. Two subsets of CD3+, T cell receptor-1+ intraepithelial lymphocyte T cells abrogate oral tolerance.</a></h2><p>The murine intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) population is enriched in T cells that express the gamma delta-TCR, however, the biologic function served by these T cells remains obscure. IEL are considered to be major effector cells in mucosal immunity, and we have investigated whether IEL subsets could reverse orally induced systemic unresponsiveness (oral tolerance; OT) and support secondary type responses when adoptively transferred to mice orally tolerized with SRBC. When purified CD3+ IEL from mice orally primed with SRBC were transferred to adoptive hosts and challenged with SRBC, splenic IgM, IgG1, IgG2b, and IgA anti-SRBC plaque-forming cell responses were observed. However, CD3+ IEL from HRBC orally primed mice did not abrogate SRBC induced OT. Further, HRBC-primed CD3+, IEL converted HRBC-specific OT but not SRBC-specific OT. CD3+ IEL could be separated into four subsets based on expression of CD4 and CD8. CD3+, CD4-, 8+ T cells were the major subset (74.5%), with smaller numbers of CD4- and CD8- (double negatives, DN) (7.8%), CD4+, 8- (7.6%) and CD4+, CD8+ (double positives) (10.1%) T cells. Interestingly, both the CD3+, CD8+, and the CD3+, DN IEL subsets abrogated OT, resulting in significant IgM, IgG1, IgG2b, and IgA anti-SRBC plaque-forming cell responses when adoptively transferred to mice with OT. However, neither CD3+, CD4+, CD8-, nor double positive T cells affected OT when studied in this system. The CD3+, CD8+ IEL subset could be further separated into Thy-1+ (16.6%) and Thy-1- (83.4%) cells; adoptive transfer of Thy-1- cells abrogated oral tolerance whereas the Thy-1+ subset was without effect. When the expression of TCR on IEL with this biologic function was determined by use of monoclonal anti-alpha beta TCR (H57.597), TCR2-, CD3+ IEL possessed immunoregulatory function whereas the alpha beta-TCR+ (TCR2+) fraction did not abrogate OT. Immunoprecipitation of membrane fractions obtained from purified CD3+, CD4-, CD8+, Thy-1- IEL with polyclonal anti-delta peptide (-Ala--Ser-Phe-----Leu) antibody revealed bands of 45 and 35 kDa, corresponding to the delta- and gamma-chains, respectively. These results suggest that gamma delta-TCR+ IEL possess a regulatory function, namely the restoration of immune responses in a state of oral tolerance. Further, both CD3+, CD4-, CD8+, Thy-1-, and CD3+, DN IEL T cells exhibit this effector contrasuppressor function.</p><p>Keyword: immunotherapy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2573632>Immunoregulatory function of CD3+, CD4-, and CD8- T cells. Gamma delta T cell receptor-positive T cells from nude mice abrogate oral tolerance.</a></h2><p>Previous work has shown that abrogation of oral tolerance is mediated by T cells which are found in the CD3+, L3T4- (CD4-), and Lyt-2- (CD8-) subset (termed double-negative; DN) in mice. Inasmuch as it is known that athymic, nude (nu/nu) mice possess Thy 1+, CD4-, and CD8- T cells which also exhibit a functionally rearranged TCR gamma-chain, we investigated whether this subset of nude T cells contained functional immunoregulatory cells. In this report, we examined the phenotype and distribution of CD3+ T cells in the spleen and in the mesenteric and peripheral lymph nodes of BALB/c nu/nu mice in comparison with normal mice (+/+). In the spleens of nude mice, the predominant CD3+ T cell subpopulation was DN. Further, in mesenteric and peripheral lymph nodes, approximately one-third and one-half of the CD3+ T cells were double negative, respectively. In contrast, CD3+, DN T cells represent a small subpopulation in normal (+/+) mice. We next showed that functional regulatory T cells which possess the ability to abrogate oral tolerance were induced in nu/nu mice by Ag priming. BALB/c nude mice were immunized with SRBC, and the splenic CD3+, Vicia villosa-adherent cells were obtained by panning. Adoptive transfer of CD3+, V. villosa-adherent T cells to orally tolerant BALB/c mice restored responsiveness to SRBC, whereas V. villosa nonadherent cells were without effect. In other experiments, CD3+ T cells from the spleens of SRBC-primed mice were further enriched for the CD5+, DN phenotype and adoptive transfer of this subset completely abrogated oral tolerance to SRBC. To characterize the nature of the TCR expressed on these CD3+, DN T cells, we developed a rabbit antibody to a synthetic peptide (residues 209-218: -Ala--Ser-Phe-----Leu) which was synthesized from a deduced sequence of the murine delta-gene. Immunoprecipitation of a cell membrane fraction from CD3+, DN T cells with anti-delta TCR antibody isolated a 45-kDa band. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation of these cells with anti-CD3 (145-2C11) revealed bands at 45 and 35 kDa (corresponding to delta- and gamma-chains, respectively). Taken together, these results are the first to show that gamma delta-TCR bearing CD3+, CD4-, and CD8- T cells are functional and reverse oral tolerance when adoptively transferred.</p><p>Keyword: immunotherapy</p></html>
