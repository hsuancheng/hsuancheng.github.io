Cardiolipin is a mitochondrial phospholipid necessary for maintaining physiological function of . Several studies have indicated that the cardiolipin acyl chain compositions affect the function of cardiolipin and . Here, we investigated the structural changes of cardiolipin after DHA and EPA supplementation and compared them to  (AA) treatment. H9c2 cardiac myoblast was used as a cell model, and cardiolipin species was monitored and identified via LC-MS and MS/MS. Our results showed distinct mass envelopes of cardiolipin with the same carbon number but different double bonds in mass spectrum. There were 116 cardiolipin species with 36 distinct mass in 6 mass envelopes identified by MS/MS. Three days of PUFA treatment resulted in decreases of low-molecular-weight cardiolipin and increases of high-molecular-weight cardiolipin, suggesting the incorporation of exogenous DHA, EPA and AA into mitochondrial cardiolipin. PUFA incorporation was further verified by MS/MS analysis. More importantly, we found that DHA supplementation elevated the percent content of less unsaturated cardiolipin species and highly unsaturated cardiolipin species, containing ω-3 fatty acyl chains, indicating a ω-3 fatty  incorporation mechanism with peroxidation protection. Our results indicate that PUFA supplementation differentially perturbed the fatty acyl chain compositions in the mitochondrial cardiolipin in the H9c2 cardiac myoblast, suggesting that mitochondrial membrane and the function of  are susceptible to exogenous lipid species.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Surprisingly enough, plasma levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in both study groups were below the clinical reference range with no significant difference between the groups. In vitro study performed on isolated placental  and placental cell line showed that suicidal self-oxidation of cytochrome P450scc may lead to structural disintegration of heme, potentially contributing to enhancement of oxidative stress phenomena in the course of preeclampsia. As placental cytochrome P450scc pleiotropic activity is implicated in the metabolism of free radical mediated  derivatives as well as multiple Vitamin D3 hydroxylations and progesterone synthesis, we propose that Vitamin D3 might act as a competitive inhibitor of placental cytochrome P450scc preventing the production of lipid peroxides or excess progesterone synthesis, both of which may contribute to the etiopathogenesis of preeclampsia. The proposed molecular mechanism is in accord with the preliminary clinical observations on the surprisingly high efficacy of high-dose Vitamin D3 supplementation in prevention and treatment of preeclampsia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28229635>Oral administration of fumonisin B and T-2 individually and in combination affects hepatic total and mitochondrial membrane lipid profile of rabbits.</a></h2><p>Weaned rabbits were fed diets contaminated with 2 mg/kg diet T-2 toxin alone, or 10 mg/kg diet fumonisin B (FB) alone, and both toxins in combination (2 + 10 mg/kg, respectively) compared to a toxin-free control diet. Samplings were performed after 4 weeks (blood and liver). Bodyweight of T-2-fed group was lower after 4 weeks; the liver weight was increased dramatically (threefold of control). Liver total phospholipids (PLs) provided slight alterations in the fatty  (FA) composition; all three toxin-treated groups showed a decrease in palmitoleic  (C16:1 n7) proportion. In the liver mitochondrial PL FA composition, margaric  (C17:0) proportion decreased in the separated toxin treatments compared to the combined setting. Oleic  (C18:1 n9) proportion was increased and  (C20:4 n6) was decreased in the FB-treated group, while docosapentaenoic  (C22:5 n3) was decreased in the separated treatments. The total monounsaturation was significantly higher in the FB group's mitochondrial PL FA profile. After 4 weeks, all toxin treatments decreased the blood plasma reduced glutathione and glutathione peroxidase activity, and FB increased the plasma sphinganine/sphingosine ratio. Both mycotoxins seem to cross the hepatocellular and the hepatic mitochondrial membrane, without drastic membrane disruption, as assessed from the PL FA composition, but inducing detectable lipid peroxidation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28566623>Moutan Cortex Protects Hepatocytes against Oxidative Injury through AMP-Activated Protein Kinase Pathway.</a></h2><p>Moutan Cortex, the root bark of Paeonia suffruticosa ANDREWS in Ranunculaceae, has widely demonstrated analgesic, anti-spasmodic, and anti-inflammatory effects in various cancer and immune cell lines. Oxidative stress is associated with development of several diseases, including liver disease. We prepared the water extract of Moutan Cortex (MCE) to investigate the cytoprotective activities and its mechanism. MCE protected hepatocytes from  (AA)+iron induced oxidative stress, as indicated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cell viability analysis. MCE also suppressed mitochondrial dysfunction in AA+iron-treated human hepatocyte-derived hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, HepG2 cells. In addition, MCE treatment induces AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and liver kinase B1 phosphorylation, which play a role in inhibition of oxidative stress induced cell death. Moreover, one of the MCE compounds, chlorogenic , exerted protective effects against oxidative stress and apoptosis. Taken together, MCE protected hepatocytes against AA+iron-induced oxidative stress through AMPK activation, and may be a candidate for the treatment of liver disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29385569>Dronedarone-Induced Cardiac Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Its Mitigation by Epoxyeicosatrienoic Acids.</a></h2><p>Dronedarone and amiodarone are structurally similar antiarrhythmic drugs. Dronedarone worsens cardiac adverse effects with unknown causes while amiodarone has no cardiac adversity. Dronedarone induces preclinical mitochondrial toxicity in rat liver and exhibits clinical hepatotoxicity. Here, we further investigated the relative potential of the antiarrhythmic drugs in causing mitochondrial injury in cardiomyocytes. Differentiated rat H9c2 cardiomyocytes were treated with dronedarone, amiodarone, and their respective metabolites namely N-desbutyldronedarone (NDBD) and N-desethylamiodarone (NDEA). Intracellular ATP content, mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), and inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) activity and  (AA) metabolism were measured in H9c2 cells. Inhibition of electron transport chain (ETC) activities and uncoupling of ETC were further studied in isolated rat heart . Dronedarone, amiodarone, NDBD and NDEA decreased intracellular ATP content significantly (IC50 = 0.49, 1.84, 1.07, and 0.63 µM, respectively) and dissipated Δψm potently (IC50 = 0.5, 2.94, 12.8, and 7.38 µM, respectively). Dronedarone, NDBD, and NDEA weakly inhibited CPT1 activity while amiodarone (IC50 > 100 µM) yielded negligible inhibition. Only dronedarone inhibited AA metabolism to its regioisomeric epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) consistently and potently. NADH-supplemented ETC activity was inhibited by dronedarone, amiodarone, NDBD and NDEA (IC50 = 3.07, 5.24, 11.94, and 16.16 µM, respectively). Cytotoxicity, ATP decrease and Δψm disruption were ameliorated via exogenous pre-treatment of H9c2 cells with 11, 12-EET and 14, 15-EET. Our study confirmed that dronedarone causes mitochondrial injury in cardiomyocytes by perturbing Δψm, inhibiting mitochondrial complex I, uncoupling ETC and dysregulating AA-EET metabolism. We postulate that cardiac mitochondrial injury is one potential contributing factor to dronedarone-induced cardiac failure exacerbation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26081696>Berberine induces apoptosis by suppressing the  metabolic pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Berberine (BBR) has been suggested as a potential candidate anticancer agent due to its high anticancer activity and multiple mechanisms. In the present study, the inhibitory effect of BBR on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via the suppression of the  (AA) metabolic pathway was investigated. BBR was demonstrated to reduce the viabilities of H22, HepG2 and Bel‑7404 cells, in a dose‑ and time‑dependent manner, and increase the number of apoptotic cells. BBR induced the translocation of apoptosis‑inducing factor between the  and the nucleus, and had no effects on the protein expression levels of caspase‑3 or ‑9. In addition, BBR significantly suppressed the protein expression levels of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and cyclooxygenase (COX)‑2 and elevated the content ratio of AA to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Furthermore, BBR reduced the volume and weight of tumors in a H22 transplanted tumor model in mice. The results of the present study demonstrated that elevation in the ratio of AA to PGE2 via suppression of the protein expression of cPLA2 and COX‑2 in the AA metabolic pathway is involved in the inhibitory effect of BBR in HCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26528354>Polyunsaturated fatty acids trigger apoptosis of colon cancer cells through a mitochondrial pathway.</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer is common in developed countries. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been reported to possess tumoricidal action, but the exact mechanism of their action is not clear.In the present study, we studied the effect of various n-6 and n-3 fatty acids on the survival of the colon cancer cells LoVo and RKO and evaluated the possible involvement of a mitochondrial pathway in their ability to induce apoptosis.It was observed that n-3 α-linolenic , eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic  (ALA, EPA and DHA respectively) and n-6 linoleic , gamma-linolenic  and  (LA, GLA and AA respectively) induced apoptosis of the colon cancer cells LoVo and RKO at concentrations above 120 μM (p < 0.01 compared to control). The semi-differentiated colon cancer cell line RKO was more sensitive to the cytotoxic action of PUFAs compared to the undifferentiated colon cancer cell line LoVo. PUFA-treated cells showed an increased number of lipid droplets in their cytoplasm. PUFA-induced apoptosis of LoVo and RKO cells is mediated through a -mediated pathway as evidenced by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, generation of ROS, accumulation of intracellular Ca(2+), activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, decreased ATP level and increase in the Bax/Bcl2 expression ratio.PUFAs induced apoptosis of colon cancer cells through a mitochondrial dependent pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28605665>The effects of fatty  composition on cardiac hypertrophy and function in mouse models of diet-induced obesity.</a></h2><p>High-fat diets (HFDs) are used frequently to study the development of cardiac dysfunction in animal models of obesity and diabetes. However, impairment in systolic function, often reported as declining ejection fraction, may not consistently occur in a given time frame which could be contributable to a variety of factors within the experimental design. One major factor may be the amounts of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (FAs) that are present in the diet. To determine whether the FA content and composition were critical determinants in the development of cardiac dysfunction in response to high-fat feeding, we fed adult, male mice Western diet (45% fat, 60% saturated), Surwit diet (60% fat, 90% saturated), milk-fat-based diet (60% fat, 60% saturated) or high-fat Western diet (HFWD, 60% fat, 32% saturated) for 12 weeks. We report that neither the amount of total fat nor the ratio of saturated to unsaturated FAs in the diets differentially affects body weight and adiposity in mice. In addition, no evidence of systolic dysfunction is present after 12 weeks. Interestingly, the HFWD, with equal parts saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated FAs, induces mild cardiac hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction after 12 weeks, which coincides with elevated serum levels of . Our results suggest that the dietary FA content and composition may be a primary determinant of diastolic, but not systolic, dysfunction in animal models of diet-induced obesity.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Specific for cellular organelles redistribution of IMM fatty acids was determined. It led to the reduction of total amount of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and increase of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) in cardiomyocytes and to the increase of SFAs and decrease of UFAs in hepatocytes. The decrease in the content of oleic  and increased content of  and docosahexaenoic acids in IMM were shown. This may be due to their role in the regulatory systems during hibernation, as well as following exit therefrom. It is assumed that artificial hibernation state is characterized by the stress reaction leading to optimal readjustment of fatty acids composition of membrane lipids, which supports functional activity of  in hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29525608>Beneficial effects of white wine polyphenols-enriched diet on Alzheimer's disease-like pathology.</a></h2><p>The development of effective medicines to break or delay the progressive brain degeneration underlying cognitive decline and dementia that characterize Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the greatest challenges of our time. In the present work, a selective pool of polyphenols, obtained from the white wine by adsorption to polyvinylpyrrolidone polymer (PVPP), was used to prepare a polyphenols-enriched diet, supplementing the drinking water with 100 mg/L (expressed as gallic  equivalent) of wine polyphenolic extract. The impact of the daily consumption of water supplemented with polyphenols for 2 months on brain of 10-month-old 3xTg-AD and NonTg mice was evaluated, considering effects on the redox state of cells, levels of amyloid-β peptides, mitochondrial bioenergetics and fatty  profile of whole membrane phospholipids. The polyphenols-enriched diet promotes brain accumulation of catechin and hydroxybenzoic  derivatives, and modulates the redox state of 3xTg-AD brain cells, increasing both glutathione/glutathione disulfide ratio and catalase activity and decreasing membrane lipids oxidation. Additionally, the functional diet decreases the 3xTg-AD brain levels of both amyloid-β peptides, Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42. However, the brain mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction of 3xTg-AD animals was not attenuated by the polyphenols-enriched diet. Lipidomic studies showed that this functional diet modulates membrane lipid composition of brain cells, increasing C22:6n-3 (docosahexanoic ) and decreasing C20:4n-6 () levels, which may have beneficial impact on the chronic inflammatory process associated with AD pathology. Altogether, these results indicate that the oral administration of this polyphenols-enriched diet promotes significant benefits in multiple aspects of the pathophysiological cascade associated with the neuropathology developed by 3xTg-AD mice.Copyright © 2017.

Autophagy is the basic cellular machinery involving the digestion of damaged cellular components. In the present study, we investigated the protection effects of eupatilin against  (AA) and iron-induced oxidative stress in HepG2 cells and tried to elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible. Eupatilin increased cell viability against AA + iron in a concentration-dependent manner and prevented mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In addition, AA + iron increased the levels of pro-apoptotic proteins and these changes were prevented by eupatilin. Eupatilin also induced autophagy, as evidenced by the accumulation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain3-II and the detection of autophagic vacuoles. Furthermore, the protective effects of eupatilin on mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production were significantly abolished by autophagy inhibitors. Eupatilin also increased the mRNA level of sestrin-2 and its promoter-driven reporter gene activity, which resulted in the up-regulation of sestrin-2 protein. Finally, gene silencing using sestrin-2 siRNA and the ectopic expression of recombinant adenoviral sestrin-2 indicated that sestrin-2 induction by eupatilin was required for autophagy-mediated cytoprotection against AA + iron. Our results suggest that eupatilin activates sestrin-2-dependent autophagy, thereby preventing oxidative stress induced by AA + iron.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29293497>Model-driven discovery of long-chain fatty  metabolic reprogramming in heterogeneous prostate cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Epithelial-mesenchymal-transition promotes intra-tumoral heterogeneity, by enhancing tumor cell invasiveness and promoting drug resistance. We integrated transcriptomic data for two clonal subpopulations from a prostate cancer cell line (PC-3) into a genome-scale metabolic network model to explore their metabolic differences and potential vulnerabilities. In this dual cell model, PC-3/S cells express Epithelial-mesenchymal-transition markers and display high invasiveness and low metastatic potential, while PC-3/M cells present the opposite phenotype and higher proliferative rate. Model-driven analysis and experimental validations unveiled a marked metabolic reprogramming in long-chain fatty acids metabolism. While PC-3/M cells showed an enhanced entry of long-chain fatty acids into the , PC-3/S cells used long-chain fatty acids as precursors of eicosanoid metabolism. We suggest that this metabolic reprogramming endows PC-3/M cells with augmented energy metabolism for fast proliferation and PC-3/S cells with increased eicosanoid production impacting angiogenesis, cell adhesion and invasion. PC-3/S metabolism also promotes the accumulation of docosahexaenoic , a long-chain fatty  with antiproliferative effects.

However, the enzyme(s) responsible for the cleavage of the vinyl ether linkage in plasmalogens has remained elusive. Herein, we report that cytochrome , in the presence of either cardiolipin (CL), O and HO, or oxidized CL and O, catalyzes the oxidation of the plasmalogen vinyl ether linkage, promoting its hydrolytic cleavage and resultant production of 2-AA-lysolipids and highly reactive α-hydroxy fatty aldehydes. Using stable isotope labeling in synergy with strategic chemical derivatizations and high-mass-accuracy MS, we deduced the chemical mechanism underlying this long sought-after reaction. Specifically, labeling with either O or HO, but not with HO, resulted in M + 2 isotopologues of the α-hydroxyaldehyde, whereas reactions with both O and HO identified the M + 4 isotopologue. Furthermore, incorporation of O from O was predominantly located at the α-carbon. In contrast, reactions with HO yielded O linked to the aldehyde carbon. Importantly, no significant labeling of 2-AA-lysolipids with O, HO, or HO was present. Intriguingly, phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIP and PIP) effectively substituted for cardiolipin.

CYP3A4 was unexpectedly associated with breast cancer  and synthesized  (AA)-derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which promoted the electron transport chain/respiration and inhibited AMPKα. CYP3A4 knockdown activated AMPKα, promoted autophagy, and prevented mammary tumor formation. The diabetes drug metformin inhibited CYP3A4-mediated EET biosynthesis and depleted cancer cell-intrinsic EETs. Metformin bound to the active-site heme of CYP3A4 in a co-crystal structure, establishing CYP3A4 as a biguanide target. Structure-based design led to discovery of N1-hexyl-N5-benzyl-biguanide (HBB), which bound to the CYP3A4 heme with higher affinity than metformin. HBB potently and specifically inhibited CYP3A4 AA epoxygenase activity. HBB also inhibited growth of established ER mammary tumors and suppressed intratumoral mTOR. CYP3A4 AA epoxygenase inhibition by biguanides thus demonstrates convergence between eicosanoid activity in  and biguanide action in cancer, opening a new avenue for cancer drug discovery.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Among the major active constituents responsible for the bioactivities of L. japonica, fucoxanthin (FX) has been considered as a potential antioxidant. This study was conducted to examine the effects of L. japonica extract (LJE) or FX against oxidative stress on hepatocytes and to elucidate the overall their cellular mechanisms of the effects.We constructed an in vitro model with the treatment of  (AA) + iron in HepG2 cells to stimulate the oxidative damage. The cells were pre-treated with LJE or FX for 1 h, and incubated with AA + iron. The effect on oxidative damage and cellular mechanisms of LJE or FX were assessed by cytological examination and several biochemical assays under conditions with or without kinase inhibitiors.LJE or FX pretreatment effectively blocked the pathological changes caused by AA + iron treatment, such as cell death, altered expression of apoptosis-related proteins such as procaspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, and  dysfunction. Moreover, FX induced AMPK activation and AMPK inhibitor, compound C, partially reduced the protective effect of FX on  dysfunction. Consistent with AMPK activation, FX increased the protein levels of autophagic markers (LC3II and beclin-1) and the number of acridine orange stained cells, and decreased the phosphorylation of mTOR and simultaneously increased the phosphorylation of ULK1. And the inhibition of autophagy by 3-methylanine or bafilomycin A1 partially inhibited the protective effect of FX on  dysfunction.These findings suggest that FX have the function of being a hepatic protectant against oxidative damages through the AMPK pathway for the control of autophagy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25628533>Neuroinflammation and J2 prostaglandins: linking impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and  to neurodegeneration.</a></h2><p>The immune response of the CNS is a defense mechanism activated upon injury to initiate repair mechanisms while chronic over-activation of the CNS immune system (termed neuroinflammation) may exacerbate injury. The latter is implicated in a variety of neurological and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, HIV dementia, and prion diseases. Cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2), which are key enzymes in the conversion of  into bioactive prostanoids, play a central role in the inflammatory cascade. J2 prostaglandins are endogenous toxic products of cyclooxygenases, and because their levels are significantly increased upon brain injury, they are actively involved in neuronal dysfunction induced by pro-inflammatory stimuli. In this review, we highlight the mechanisms by which J2 prostaglandins (1) exert their actions, (2) potentially contribute to the transition from acute to chronic inflammation and to the spreading of neuropathology, (3) disturb the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and mitochondrial function, and (4) contribute to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as well as stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and demyelination in Krabbe disease. We conclude by discussing the therapeutic potential of targeting the J2 prostaglandin pathway to prevent/delay neurodegeneration associated with neuroinflammation. In this context, we suggest a shift from the traditional view that cyclooxygenases are the most appropriate targets to treat neuroinflammation, to the notion that J2 prostaglandin pathways and other neurotoxic prostaglandins downstream from cyclooxygenases, would offer significant benefits as more effective therapeutic targets to treat chronic neurodegenerative diseases, while minimizing adverse side effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30258081>Mitochondrial uncoupling reveals a novel therapeutic opportunity for p53-defective cancers.</a></h2><p>There are considerable challenges in directly targeting the mutant p53 protein, given the large heterogeneity of p53 mutations in the clinic. An alternative approach is to exploit the altered fitness of cells imposed by loss-of-wild-type p53. Here we identify niclosamide through a HTS screen for compounds selectively killing p53-deficient cells. Niclosamide impairs the growth of p53-deficient cells and of p53 mutant patient-derived ovarian xenografts. Metabolome profiling reveals that niclosamide induces mitochondrial uncoupling, which renders mutant p53 cells susceptible to mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis through preferential accumulation of  (AA), and represents a first-in-class inhibitor of p53 mutant tumors. Wild-type p53 evades the cytotoxicity by promoting the transcriptional induction of two key  oxygenation genes, ALOX5 and ALOX12B, which catalyzes the dioxygenation and breakdown of AA. Therefore, we propose a new paradigm for targeting cancers defective in the p53 pathway, by exploiting their vulnerability to niclosamide-induced mitochondrial uncoupling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28508993>14,15-EET Suppresses Neuronal Apoptosis in Ischemia-Reperfusion Through the Mitochondrial Pathway.</a></h2><p>Neuronal apoptosis mediated by the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway is an important pathological process in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. 14,15-EET, an intermediate metabolite of , can promote cell survival during ischemia/reperfusion.

In this study, we observed that infarct size in ischemia-reperfusion injury was reduced in sEH gene knockout mice. In addition, Caspase 3 activation, cytochrome C release and AIF nuclear translocation were also inhibited. In this study, 14,15-EET pretreatment reduced neuronal apoptosis in the oxygen-glucose deprivation and re-oxygenation group in vitro. The mitochondrial apoptosis pathway was also inhibited, as evidenced by AIF translocation from the  to nucleus and the reduction in the expressions of cleaved-caspase 3 and cytochrome C in the cytoplasm. 14,15-EET could reduce neuronal apoptosis through upregulation of the ratio of Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic protein) to Bax (apoptosis protein) and inhibition of Bax aggregation onto . PI3K/AKT pathway is also probably involved in the reduction of neuronal apoptosis by EET.

Although mostly noncancerous, pituitary adenomas (PAs) can cause serious health problems such as headaches, visual field defects, double vision, and hypopituitarism by invasion of regional structures. Nonfunctioning PAs (NFPAs) approximately account for one-third of PAs manifested by no circulating hormone hypersecretion. Lipid reprogramming has been recognized as a hallmark of tumor cells and proven to play a crucial role in tumorigenesis. However, the lipid molecular pathogenesis of NFPAs has remained obscure to date. To uncover lipid alterations that may contribute to the development of NFPAs and define their molecular characteristics, we investigated tissue lipids of patients with NFPAs including eight null cell adenomas (NCAs) and eight oncocytomas (OCMs) and of five normal pituitary glands as the control (Ctrl) using nontargeted lipidomics based on ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-Orbitrap Q-Exactive HF mass spectrometry. The lipidomic results were further validated in another set of subjects consisting of 8 NCAs, 10 OCMs, and 6 Ctrls to define crucial lipids discriminating NFPAs from the normal pituitary tumors. Lipidomic analyses revealed that OCM showed more pronounced changes in lipid compositions than NCA and Ctrl. As expected,  abundant cardiolipins were remarkably increased in OCM, which was accordant with the biochemical evidence of  hyperplasia in OCM. Significantly increased levels of phospholipids (PLs), especially  (AA)-enriched PLs, were unique characteristics of lipid profiling in OCM vs Ctrl.

As rotenone acts as an inhibitor of mitochondrial respiratory complex I, we employed oxidative lipidomics to assess oxidative metabolism of a -specific phospholipid, cardiolipin (CL), in substantia nigra (SN) of exposed animals. We found a significant reduction in oxidizable polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA)-containing CL molecular species. We further revealed increased contents of mono-oxygenated CL species at late stages of the exposure. Notably, linoleic  in sn-1 position was the major oxidation substrate yielding its mono-hydroxy- and epoxy-derivatives whereas more readily "oxidizable" fatty  residues ( and docosahexaenoic acids) remained non-oxidized. Elevated levels of PUFA CLs were detected in plasma of rats exposed to rotenone.

The difference in manifested toxicity of MeHg and EtHg are likely the result of the differences in exposure, metabolism, and elimination from the body, rather than differences in mechanisms of action between the two.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28342966>Time courses of post-injury mitochondrial oxidative damage and respiratory dysfunction and neuronal cytoskeletal degradation in a rat model of focal traumatic brain injury.</a></h2><p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in rapid reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and oxidative damage to essential brain cellular components leading to neuronal dysfunction and cell death. It is increasingly appreciated that a major player in TBI-induced oxidative damage is the reactive nitrogen species (RNS) peroxynitrite (PN) which is produced in large part in injured brain . Once formed, PN decomposes into highly reactive free radicals that trigger membrane lipid peroxidation (LP) of polyunsaturated fatty acids (e.g. ) and protein nitration (3-nitrotyrosine, 3-NT) in  and other cellular membranes causing various functional impairments to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and calcium (Ca) buffering capacity. The LP also results in the formation of neurotoxic reactive aldehyde byproducts including 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and propenal (acrolein) which exacerbates ROS/RNS production and oxidative protein damage in the injured brain. Ultimately, this results in intracellular Ca overload that activates proteolytic degradation of α-spectrin, a neuronal cytoskeletal protein. Therefore, the aim of this study was to establish the temporal evolution of mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative damage and cytoskeletal degradation in the brain following a severe controlled cortical impact (CCI) TBI in young male adult rats. In  isolated from an 8 mm diameter cortical punch including the 5 mm wide impact site and their respiratory function studied ex vivo, we observed an initial decrease in complex I and II mitochondrial bioenergetics within 3 h (h). For complex I bioenergetics, this partially recovered by 12-16 h, whereas for complex II respiration the recovery was complete by 12 h. During the first 24 h, there was no evidence of an injury-induced increase in LP or protein nitration in mitochondrial or cellular homogenates. However, beginning at 24 h, there was a gradual secondary decline in complex I and II respiration that peaked at 72 h. post-TBI that coincided with progressive peroxidation of mitochondrial and cellular lipids, protein nitration and protein modification by 4-HNE and acrolein. The oxidative damage and respiratory failure paralleled an increase in Ca-induced proteolytic degradation of the neuronal cytoskeletal protein α-spectrin indicating a failure of intracellular Ca homeostasis. These findings of a surprisingly delayed peak in secondary injury, suggest that the therapeutic window and needed treatment duration for certain antioxidant treatment strategies following CCI-TBI in rodents may be longer than previously believed.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Decline of platelet function has been attributed to decreased mitochondrial function and increased oxidative stress. Resveratrol (Res) and cytochrome c (Cyt c), in combination with hypothermic storage, may extend platelet viability.Platelets from 20 donors were pooled into four independent sets and stored at 22°C or 4°C in the absence or presence of Res (50 μM) or Cyt c (100 μM) for up to 10 days. Sequential measurement of platelet counts, coagulation function (thromboelastography), oxygen consumption, lipid peroxidation, glucose-lactate levels, pH, TCO2, and soluble platelet activation markers (CD62P/PF-4) was performed.Platelet function diminished rapidly over time at 22°C versus 4°C (adenosine diphosphate, day 10 [0.6 ± 0.5] vs. [7.8 ± 3.5], : day 10 [0.5 ± 0.5] vs. [30.1 ± 27.72]). At 4°C, storage treatment with Res or Cyt c limited deterioration in platelet function up to day 10, an effect not observed at 22°C (day 10, 4°C, Con [7.8 ± 3.5] vs. Res [37.3 ± 24.19] vs. Cyt c [45.83 ± 43.06]). Mechanistic analysis revealed oxygen consumption increased in response to Cyt c at 22°C, whereas neither Cyt c or Res affected oxygen consumption at 4°C. Lipid peroxidation was only reduced at 22°C (day 7 and day 10), but remained unchanged at 4°C, or when Res or Cyt c was added. Cytosolic ROS was significantly reduced by pretreatment with Res at 4°C. Total platelet count and soluble activation markers were unchanged during storage and not affected by Res, Cyt c, or temperature. Glucose concentration, pH and TCO2 decreased while lactate levels increased during storage at 22°C but not 4°C.Platelet function is preserved by cold storage for up to 10 days. This function is enhanced by treatment with Res or Cyt c, which supports mitochondrial activity, thus potentially extending platelet shelf life.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27522709>[Influence of Fatty Acids on Oxygen Consumption in Isolated Cardiomyocytes of Rats with Ischemic or Diabetic Heart Disease].</a></h2><p>one of the reasons of violation of the functional viability of the myocardium is considered to be the oxygen deprivation and lack of energy. The reason is the inhibitory effect of fatty acids on glucose oxidation. Recently, however, new data have been published proving the need for fatty acids and their importance in the maintenance and regulation of the functional activity of the myocardium in chronic pathology.to investigate the influence of free polyunsaturated and saturated fatty acids (FA) on the oxygen uptake of isolated cardiomyocytes in intact rats and animals with ischemic or diabetic heart disease.the executed non-randomized controlled study. It includied 3 groups of male rats of Wistar line (weight 250-300g) with 10 animals in each group. Myocardial infarction ("heart attack" group) was caused by ligation of the left coronary artery, diabetes ("diabetes" group)--by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin, and "control" group (intact animals). Myocardial infarction caused by ligation of the left coronary artery, and diabetes by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. Isolated cardiac myocytes were obtained by the enzymatic method. Oxygen consumption was assessed polarographically at different saturation incubation medium with oxygen ([O₂] ≤ 8 mg/l and ([O₂] ≥ 16 mg/l).  and palmitic acids were applied as fatty acids.It is established that the introduction of the incubation medium 20 µm  or palmitic fatty  significantly increased the oxygen consumption of intact cardiomyocytes of rats. Both at the ischemic and at the diabetic injury to the heart the opposite result was obtained. The most pronounced decrease in oxygen consumption was indicated in the group with diabetes mellitus.The inhibitory effect of LCD on the rate of oxygen consumption may be associated with the influence of the ischemic or diabetic injury to the heart on the barrierfunction ofmitochondrial membranes of cardiomyocytes, the activity of membrane-associated enzymes and their associated processes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26599513> and Eicosapentaenoic  Metabolism in Juvenile Atlantic Salmon as Affected by Water Temperature.</a></h2><p>Salmons raised in aquaculture farms around the world are increasingly subjected to sub-optimal environmental conditions, such as high water temperatures during summer seasons. Aerobic scope increases and lipid metabolism changes are known plasticity responses of fish for a better acclimation to high water temperature. The present study aimed at investigating the effect of high water temperature on the regulation of fatty  metabolism in juvenile Atlantic salmon fed different dietary ARA/EPA ratios (, 20:4n-6/ eicosapentaenoic , 20:5n-3), with particular focus on apparent in vivo enzyme activities and gene expression of lipid metabolism pathways. Three experimental diets were formulated to be identical, except for the ratio EPA/ARA, and fed to triplicate groups of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) kept either at 10°C or 20°C. Results showed that fatty  metabolic utilisation, and likely also their dietary requirements for optimal performance, can be affected by changes in their relative levels and by environmental temperature in Atlantic salmon. Thus, the increase in temperature, independently from dietary treatment, had a significant effect on the β-oxidation of a fatty  including EPA, as observed by the apparent in vivo enzyme activity and mRNA expression of pparα -transcription factor in lipid metabolism, including β-oxidation genes- and cpt1 -key enzyme responsible for the movement of LC-PUFA from the cytosol into the  for β-oxidation-, were both increased at the higher water temperature. An interesting interaction was observed in the transcription and in vivo enzyme activity of Δ5fad-time-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis pathway of EPA and ARA. Such, at lower temperature, the highest mRNA expression and enzyme activity was recorded in fish with limited supply of dietary EPA, whereas at higher temperature these were recorded in fish with limited ARA supply. In consideration that fish at higher water temperature recorded a significantly increased feed intake, these results clearly suggested that at high, sub-optimal water temperature, fish metabolism attempted to increment its overall ARA status -the most bioactive LC-PUFA participating in the inflammatory response- by modulating the metabolic fate of dietary ARA (expressed as % of net intake), reducing its β-oxidation and favouring synthesis and deposition. This correlates also with results from other recent studies showing that both immune- and stress- responses in fish are up regulated in fish held at high temperatures. This is a novel and fundamental information that warrants industry and scientific attention, in consideration of the imminent increase in water temperatures, continuous expansion of aquaculture operations, resources utilisation in aquafeed and much needed seasonal/adaptive nutritional strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25446347>Cannabinoid receptor agonists reduce the short-term mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress linked to excitotoxicity in the rat brain.</a></h2><p>The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is involved in a considerable number of physiological processes in the Central Nervous System. Recently, a modulatory role of cannabinoid receptors (CBr) and CBr agonists on the reduction of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAr) activation has been demonstrated. Quinolinic  (QUIN), an endogenous analog of glutamate and excitotoxic metabolite produced in the kynurenine pathway (KP), selectively activates NMDAr and has been shown to participate in different neurodegenerative disorders. Since the early pattern of toxicity exerted by this metabolite is relevant to explain the extent of damage that it can produce in the brain, in this work we investigated the effects of the synthetic CBr agonist WIN 55,212-2 (WIN) and other agonists (anandamide or AEA, and CP 55,940 or CP) on early markers of QUIN-induced toxicity in rat striatal cultured cells and rat brain synaptosomes. WIN, AEA and CP exerted protective effects on the QUIN-induced loss of cell viability. WIN also preserved the immunofluorescent signals for neurons and CBr labeling that were decreased by QUIN. The QUIN-induced early mitochondrial dysfunction, lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation were also partially or completely prevented by WIN pretreatment, but not when this CBr agonist was added simultaneously with QUIN to brain synaptosomes. These findings support a neuroprotective and modulatory role of cannabinoids in the early toxic events elicited by agents inducing excitotoxic processes.Copyright © 2014 IBRO.

The recent discovery of thermogenic UCP1-expressing brite adipocytes within WAT raised the question whether n-3 and n-6 PUFAs exert differential effects on brite adipocyte formation and mitochondrial function.Primary human preadipocytes were treated with n-3 PUFAs (eicosapentaenoic , EPA; docosahexaenoic , DHA) or n-6 PUFA (, ARA) during differentiation, and adipogenesis, white and brite gene expression markers, mitochondrial content and function were analyzed at day 12 of differentiation. Adipogenesis was equally increased by n-3 and n-6 PUFAs. The n-6 PUFA ARA increased lipid droplet size and expression of the white-specific marker TCF21 while decreased mitochondrial protein expression and respiratory function. In contrast, EPA increased expression of the brown adipocyte-related genes UCP1 and CPT1B, and improved mitochondrial function of adipocytes. The opposing effects of EPA and ARA on gene expression and mitochondrial function were also observed in cells treated from day 8 to 12 of adipocyte differentiation.EPA promotes brite adipogenesis and improves parameters of mitochondrial function, such as increased expression of CPTB1, citrate synthase activity and higher maximal respiratory capacity, while ARA reduced mitochondrial spare respiratory capacity in vitro.© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Docosahexaenoic  (DHA), the major polyunsaturated fatty  in the retina, protects cultured retina photoreceptors from apoptosis induced by oxidative stress and promotes photoreceptor differentiation. Here, we investigated whether eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), a metabolic precursor to DHA, had similar effects and whether retinal neurons could metabolize EPA to DHA. Adding EPA to rat retina neuronal cultures increased opsin expression and protected photoreceptors from apoptosis induced by the oxidants paraquat and hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ). Palmitic, oleic, and  acids had no protective effect, showing the specificity for DHA. We found that EPA supplementation significantly increased DHA percentage in retinal neurons, but not EPA percentage. Photoreceptors and glial cells expressed Δ6 desaturase (FADS2), which introduces the last double bond in DHA biosynthetic pathway. Pre-treatment of neuronal cultures with CP-24879 hydrochloride, a Δ5/Δ6 desaturase inhibitor, prevented EPA-induced increase in DHA percentage and completely blocked EPA protection and its effect on photoreceptor differentiation. These results suggest that EPA promoted photoreceptor differentiation and rescued photoreceptors from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis through its elongation and desaturation to DHA. Our data show, for the first time, that isolated retinal neurons can synthesize DHA in culture. Docosahexaenoic  (DHA), the major polyunsaturated fatty  in retina photoreceptors, and its precursor, eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) have multiple beneficial effects. Here, we show that retina neurons in vitro express the desaturase FADS2 and can synthesize DHA from EPA. Moreover, addition of EPA to these cultures protects photoreceptors from oxidative stress and promotes their differentiation through its metabolization to DHA.© 2015 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24990103>Cytochrome P450 and myocardial ischemia: potential pharmacological implication for cardioprotection.</a></h2><p>Cytochromes P450 (CYP) are a large family of enzymes widely involved in hepatic drug metabolism. While most CYP are extensively expressed in the liver, some of them are also detected in the heart where they participate through  metabolism to a variety of eicosanoids synthesis with different cardiovascular effects. Studies performed in the last years reported that several isoenzymes of microsomal CYP (i.e. CYP 2J2, CYP 2C8, CYP 2C9, CYP 4F) can play a role in the pathogenesis of ischemia-reperfusion. Moreover, various data indicate that microsomal CYP could represent a relevant target to develop pharmacological therapies to attenuate ischemia-reperfusion injury in the heart. As  appear to play a central role during ischemia-reperfusion, mitochondrial CYP, mainly involved in steroid hormone biosynthesis, could also become potential therapeutic target for cardioprotective strategies. Indeed, CYP 11A1 and CYP 27A1 could contribute to the preservation of the mitochondrial integrity by limiting the formation and enhancing elimination of toxic oxysterols. Further studies are required to explore whether modulation of these mitochondrial CYP could really produce cardioprotection in the human heart.© 2014 Société Française de Pharmacologie et de Thérapeutique.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28888048>Involvement of nutrients and nutritional mediators in mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase gene expression.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) synthase (HMGCS2) catalyses the first step of ketogenesis and is critical in various metabolic conditions. Several nutrient molecules were able to differentially modulate HMGCS2 expression levels. Docosahexaenoic  (DHA, C22:6, n-3), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, C20:5, n-3),  (AA, C20:4, n-6), and glucose increased HMGCS2 mRNA and protein levels in HepG2 hepatoma cells, while fructose decreased them. The effect of n-6 AA resulted significantly higher than that of n-3 PUFA, but when combined all these molecules were far less efficient. Insulin reduced HMGCS2 mRNA and protein levels in HepG2 cells, even when treated with PUFA and monosaccharides. Several nuclear receptors and transcription factors are involved in HMGCS2 expression regulation. While peroxysome proliferator activated receptor α (PPAR-α) agonist WY14643 increased HMGCS2 expression, this treatment was unable to affect PUFA-mediated regulation of HMGCS2 expression. Forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) inhibitor AS1842856 reduced HMGCS2 expression and suppressed induction promoted by fatty acids. Cells treatment with liver X receptor alpha (LXRα) agonist T0901317 reduced HMGCS2 mRNA, indicating a role for this transcription factor as suppressor of HMGCS2 gene. Previous observations already indicated HMGCS2 expression as possible nutrition status reference: our results show that several nutrients as well as specific nutritional related hormonal conditions are able to affect significantly HMGCS2 gene expression, indicating a relevant role for PUFA, which are mostly derived from nutritional intake. These insights into mechanisms of its regulation, specifically through nutrients commonly associated with disease risk, indicate HMGCS2 expression as possible reference marker of metabolic and nutritional status.© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26943326>Nitro- Prevents Angiotensin II-Induced Mitochondrial Dysfunction in a Cell Line of Kidney Proximal Tubular Cells.</a></h2><p>Nitro- (NO2-AA) is a cell signaling nitroalkene that exerts anti-inflammatory activities during macrophage activation. While angiotensin II (ANG II) produces an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial dysfunction in renal tubular cells, little is known regarding the potential protective effects of NO2-AA in ANG II-mediated kidney injury. As such, this study examines the impact of NO2-AA on ANG II-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in an immortalized renal proximal tubule cell line (HK-2 cells). Treatment of HK-2 cells with ANG II increases the production of superoxide (O2●-), nitric oxide (●NO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) expression, peroxynitrite (ONOO-) and mitochondrial dysfunction. Using high-resolution respirometry, it was observed that the presence of NO2-AA prevented ANG II-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction. Attempting to address mechanism, we treated isolated rat kidney  with ONOO-, a key mediator of ANG II-induced mitochondrial damage, in the presence or absence of NO2-AA. Whereas the activity of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and ATP synthase (ATPase) were diminished upon exposure to ONOO-, they were restored by pre-incubating the  with NO2-AA. Moreover, NO2-AA prevents oxidation and nitration of mitochondrial proteins. Combined, these data demonstrate that ANG II-mediated oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction is abrogated by NO2-AA, identifying this compound as a promising pharmacological tool to prevent ANG II-induced renal disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25654504>Age-dependent biochemical dysfunction in skeletal muscle of triple-transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer`s disease.</a></h2><p>The emergence of Alzheimer`s disease as a systemic pathology shifted the research paradigm toward a better understanding of the molecular basis of the disease considering the pathophysiological changes in both brain and peripheral tissues. In the present study, we evaluated the impact of disease progression on physiological relevant features of skeletal muscle obtained from 3, 6 and 12 month-old 3xTg-AD mice, a model of Alzheimer`s disease, and respective agematched nonTg mice. Our results showed that skeletal muscle functionality is already affected in 3-month-old 3xTg-AD mice as evidenced by deficient acetylcholinesterase and catalase activities as well as by alterations in fatty  composition of mitochondrial membranes. Additionally, an age-dependent accumulation of amyloid-β1-40 peptide occurred in skeletal muscle of 3xTg-AD mice, an effect that preceded bioenergetics mitochondrial dysfunction, which was only detected at 12 months of age, characterized by decreased respiratory control ratio and ADP/O index and by an impairment of complex I activity. HPLC-MS/MS analyses revealed significant changes in phospholipid composition of skeletal muscle tissues from 3xTg-AD mice with 12 months of age when compared with age-matched nonTg mice. Increased levels of lyso-phosphatidylcholine associated with a decrease of phosphatidylcholine molecular species containing  were detected in 3xTg-AD mice, indicating an enhancement of phospholipase A2 activity and skeletal muscle inflammation. Additionally, a decrease of phosphatidylethanolamine plasmalogens content and an increase in phosphatidylinositol levels was observed in 3xTg-AD mice when compared with age-matched nonTg mice.

Decades after the seminal discoveries involving its cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase branches, studies of this cascade remain an active area of research. The third and less widely known branch, the cytochrome P450 pathway leads to highly active oxygenated lipid mediators, epoxy fatty acids (EpFAs) and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), which are of similar potency to prostanoids and leukotrienes. Unlike the COX and LOX branches, no pharmaceuticals currently are marketed targeting the P450 branch. However, data support therapeutic benefits from modulating these regulatory lipid mediators. This is being approached by stabilizing or mimicking the EpFAs or even by altering the diet. These approaches lead to predominantly beneficial effects on a wide range of apparently unrelated states resulting in an enigma of how this small group of natural chemical mediators can have such diverse effects. EpFAs are degraded by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) and stabilized by inhibiting this enzyme. In this review, we focus on interconnected aspects of reported mechanisms of action of EpFAs and inhibitors of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEHI). The sEHI and EpFAs are commonly reported to maintain homeostasis under pathological conditions while remaining neutral under normal physiological conditions. Here we provide a conceptual framework for the unique and broad range of biological activities ascribed to epoxy fatty acids. We argue that their mechanism of action pivots on their ability to prevent mitochondrial dysfunction, to reduce subsequent ROS formation and to block resulting cellular signaling cascades, primarily the endoplasmic reticulum stress. By stabilizing the mitochondrial - ROS - ER stress axis, the range of activity of EpFAs and sEHI display an overlap with the disease conditions including diabetes, fibrosis, chronic pain, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, for which the above outlined mechanisms play key roles.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we provide direct genetic evidence that the knockout of glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4) causes cell death in a pathologically relevant form of ferroptosis. Using inducible Gpx4(-/-) mice, we elucidate an essential role for the glutathione/Gpx4 axis in preventing lipid-oxidation-induced acute renal failure and associated death. We furthermore systematically evaluated a library of small molecules for possible ferroptosis inhibitors, leading to the discovery of a potent spiroquinoxalinamine derivative called Liproxstatin-1, which is able to suppress ferroptosis in cells, in Gpx4(-/-) mice, and in a pre-clinical model of ischaemia/reperfusion-induced hepatic damage.

Label-free proteomics and 2D-DIGE protein expression profiling revealed differential expression of BRIT1/MCPH1, FABP5, HMGB1, HBB2, and L-FABP, results confirmed by Western blotting. Gene ontology enrichment analysis identified enrichment for genes associated with mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and metabolic processes involving carboxylic . Measurements of mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial chelatable iron pool, intracellular lipid peroxidation, and peroxisome numbers in primary hepatocytes confirmed that LCN2 regulates mitochondrial and peroxisomal integrity.

However, the array of enzymatic mediators and the exact chemical mechanisms responsible for modulating myocardial mPTP opening remain unclear. Herein, we demonstrate that human heart failure activates specific myocardial mitochondrial phospholipases that increase Ca-dependent production of toxic hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) and attenuate the activity of phospholipases that promote the synthesis of protective epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs). Mechanistically, HETEs activated the Ca-induced opening of the mPTP in failing human myocardium, and the highly selective pharmacological blockade of either iPLAγ or lipoxygenases attenuated mPTP opening in failing hearts. In contrast, pharmacological inhibition of cytochrome P450 epoxygenases opened the myocardial mPTP in human heart . Remarkably, the major mitochondrial phospholipase responsible for Ca-activated release of  (AA) in  from non-failing hearts was calcium-dependent phospholipase Aζ (cPLAζ) identified by sequential column chromatographies and activity-based protein profiling. In contrast, iPLAγ predominated in failing human myocardium. Stable isotope kinetics revealed that in non-failing human hearts, cPLAζ metabolically channels  into EETs, whereas in failing hearts, increased iPLAγ activity channels AA into toxic HETEs. These results mechanistically identify the sequelae of pathological remodeling of human mitochondrial phospholipases in failing myocardium. This remodeling metabolically channels AA into toxic HETEs promoting mPTP opening, which induces necrosis/apoptosis leading to further progression of heart failure.© 2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30153842>Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty  differentially impact cardiolipin remodeling in activated macrophage.</a></h2><p>The macrophage plays an important role in innate immunity to induce immune responses.  replacement therapy has been shown to change the  compositions of mitochondria and potentially becomes an alternative to reduce the inflammatory response.We examined the effects of omega-6  (AA), omega-3 eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and omega-3 docosahexaenoic  (DHA) supplementation on the activated the macrophage cell line RAW264.7 via KdO- A (KLA).

Nevertheless, little is known about the changes that phospholipids undergo during normal adult aging. This study examined changes in phospholipid composition in the mitochondrial and microsomal membranes of human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex over the adult life span. The largest age-related changes were an increase in the abundance of both mitochondrial and microsomal phosphatidylserine 18:0_22:6 by approximately one-third from age 20 to 100 years and a 25% decrease in mitochondrial phosphatidylethanolamine 18:0_20:4. Generally, increases were seen with age in phospholipids containing docosahexaenoic  across both membrane fractions, whereas phospholipids containing either  or adrenic  decreased with age.

The catabolism of myelin lipids to generate ketone bodies can be viewed as a systems level adaptive response to address brain fuel and energy demand. Elucidation of the initiating factors and the mechanistic pathway leading to white matter catabolism in the aging female brain provides potential therapeutic targets to prevent and treat demyelinating diseases such as Alzheimer's and multiple sclerosis.

They occur in two of the three domains of terrestrial life (bacteria, eucarya) and the human genome involves six functional LOX genes, which encode for six different LOX isoforms. One of these isoforms is ALOX15, which has first been described in rabbits in 1974 as enzyme capable of oxidizing membrane phospholipids during the maturational breakdown of  in immature red blood cells. During the following decades ALOX15 has extensively been characterized and its biological functions have been studied in a number of cellular in vitro systems as well as in various whole animal disease models. This review is aimed at summarizing the current knowledge on the protein-chemical, molecular biological and enzymatic properties of ALOX15 in various species (human, mouse, rabbit, rat) as well as its implication in cellular physiology and in the pathogenesis of various diseases.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, the mode of injury and underlying signaling mechanisms remain unknown. Challenge of primary human brain endothelial cells (HBECs) with AA activated a stress response resulting in caspase-3 activation, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and disruption of monolayer integrity. AA also induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release consistent with activation of intrinsic apoptosis. HBEC stimulation with AA resulted in sustained p38-MAPK activation and subsequent phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase activated protein-2 (MAPKAP-2) kinase and heat shock protein-27 (Hsp27). Conversely, other unsaturated and saturated fatty acids had no effect. Pharmacological and RNA interference-mediated p38α or p38β suppression abrogated AA signaling to caspase-3 and Hsp27, suggesting involvement of both p38 isoforms in AA-induced HBEC apoptosis. Hsp27 silencing also blocked caspase-3 activation. AA stimulated intracellular calcium release, which was attenuated by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor antagonists. Blockade of intracellular calcium release decreased caspase-3 activation, but had no effect on AA-induced p38-MAPK activation. However, inhibition of p38-MAPK or blockade of intracellular calcium mobilization abrogated AA-induced cytochrome c release. AA-induced caspase-3 activation was abrogated by pharmacological inhibition of lipooxygenases. These findings support a previously unrecognized signaling cooperation between p38-MAPK/MAPKAP-2/Hsp27 and intracellular calcium release in AA-induced HBEC apoptosis and suggest its relevance to neurological disorders associated with vascular inflammation.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The bile  phospholipid conjugate Ursodeoxycholyl lysophosphatidylethanolamide (UDCA-LPE) is a novel anti-inflammatory agent with hepatoprotective effects in murine high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD. The aim of this work was to study changes in the hepatic lipidome due to UDCA-LPE.High fat diet mouse model, mass spectometry, RT-PCR.Hepatic lipid extracts of HFD mice were analysed by mass spectrometry. The results determined higher levels of total, saturated, mono- and diunsaturated fatty acids (FA) in HFD mice, which were decreased by UDCA-LPE predominantly by the reducing the most abundant FA species palmitic  and oleic . Unlike other FA species, levels of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA), which are composed of  (ARA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), were increased in HFD mice upon UDCA-LPE treatment, mainly due to elevated hepatic ARA pools. Analysis of hepatic phospholipids species showed a decrease in total phosphatidylcholine (PC), especially monounsaturated PC (PUFA-PC) levels in HFD mice. Loss of total PC was reversed due to UDCA-LPE by increasing hepatic PUFA-PC pools. Gene expression analysis showed that UDCA-LPE upregulated PPARα, a key transcriptional regulator of fatty  oxidation, as well as downstream target genes CPT1α and AOX, which are crucially involved in mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty  oxidation.UDCA-LPE modulates defective fatty  metabolism during experimental NAFLD thereby restoring altered lipid profiles in addition to its pronounced anti-inflammatory effects. Thus, UDCA-LPE may be a promising drug candidate for the management of NAFLD.© 2015 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal Foundation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30159798>Inhibitions of anandamide transport and FAAH synthesis decrease apoptosis and oxidative stress through inhibition of TRPV1 channel in an in vitro seizure model.</a></h2><p>The expression level of TRPV1 is high in hippocampus which is a main epileptic area in the brain. In addition to the actions of capsaicin (CAP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), the TRPV1 channel is activated in neurons by endogenous cannabinoid, anandamide (AEA). In the current study, we investigated the role of inhibitors of TRPV1 (capsazepine, CPZ), AEA transport (AM404), and FAAH (URB597) on the modulation of Ca entry, apoptosis, and oxidative stress in in vitro seizure-induced rat hippocampus and human glioblastoma (DBTRG) cell line. The seizure was induced in the hippocampal and DBTRG neurons using in vitro 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) to trigger a seizure-like activity model. CPZ and AM404 were fully effective in reversing 4-AP-induced intracellular free Ca concentration of the hippocampus and TRPV1 current density of DBTRG. However, AEA and CAP did not activate TRPV1 in the URB597-treated neurons. Hence, we observed TRPV1 blocker effects of URB597 in the DBTRG neurons. In addition, the AM404 and CPZ treatments decreased intracellular ROS production, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, apoptosis, caspases 3 and 9 values in the hippocampus. In conclusion, the results indicate that inhibition of AEA transport, FAAH synthesis, and TRPV1 activity can result in remarkable neuroprotective effects in the epileptic neurons. Possible molecular pathways of involvement of capsazepine (CPZ) and AM4040 in anandamide and capsaicin (CAP)-induced apoptosis, oxidative stress, and Ca accumulation through TRPV1 channel in the seizure-induced rat hippocampus and human glioblastoma neurons. The TRPV1 channel is activated by different stimuli including reactive oxygen species (ROS), anandamide (AEA), and CAP and it is blocked by capsazepine (CPZ). Cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) is also activated by AEA. The AEA levels in cytosol are decreased by fatty  amide hydrolase (FAAH) enzyme. Inhibition of FAAH through URB597 induces stimulation of CB1 receptor through accumulation AEA. URB597 acts antiepileptic effects through inhibition of TRPV1. Overloaded Ca concentration of mitochondria can induce an apoptotic program by stimulating the release of apoptosis-promoting factors such as caspases 3 and caspase 9 by generating ROS due to respiratory chain damage. AM404 and CPZ reduce TRPV1 channel activation and Ca entry in the in vitro 4-AP seizure model-induced hippocampal and glioblastoma neurons.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28634388>Mito-xenophagic killing of bacteria is coordinated by a metabolic switch in dendritic cells.</a></h2><p>Chlamydiae are bacterial pathogens that grow in vacuolar inclusions. Dendritic cells (DCs) disintegrate these compartments, thereby eliminating the microbes, through auto/xenophagy, which also promotes chlamydial antigen presentation via MHC I. Here, we show that TNF-α controls this pathway by driving cytosolic phospholipase (cPLA)2-mediated  (AA) production. AA then impairs mitochondrial function, which disturbs the development and integrity of these energy-dependent parasitic inclusions, while a simultaneous metabolic switch towards aerobic glycolysis promotes DC survival. Tubulin deacetylase/autophagy regulator HDAC6 associates with disintegrated inclusions, thereby further disrupting their subcellular localisation and stability. Bacterial remnants are decorated with defective , mito-aggresomal structures, and components of the ubiquitin/autophagy machinery before they are degraded via mito-xenophagy. The mechanism depends on cytoprotective HSP25/27, the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin and HDAC6 and promotes chlamydial antigen generation for presentation on MHC I. We propose that this novel mito-xenophagic pathway linking innate and adaptive immunity is critical for effective DC-mediated anti-bacterial resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27494529>Novel Roles of Epoxyeicosanoids in Regulating Cardiac .</a></h2><p>Maintenance of a healthy pool of  is important for the function and survival of terminally differentiated cells such as cardiomyocytes. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are epoxy lipids derived from metabolism of  by cytochrome P450 epoxygenases. We have previously shown that EETs trigger a protective response limiting mitochondrial dysfunction and reducing cellular death. The aim of this study was to investigate whether EET-mediated effects influence mitochondrial quality in HL-1 cardiac cells during starvation. HL-1 cells were subjected to serum- and amino  free conditions for 24h. We employed a dual-acting synthetic analog UA-8 (13-(3-propylureido)tridec-8-enoic ), possessing both EET-mimetic and soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitory properties, or 14,15-EET as model EET molecules. We demonstrated that EET-mediated events significantly improved mitochondrial function as assessed by preservation of the ADP/ATP ratio and oxidative respiratory capacity. Starvation induced mitochondrial hyperfusion observed in control cells was attenuated by UA-8. However, EET-mediated events did not affect the expression of mitochondrial dynamic proteins Fis1, DRP-1 or Mfn2. Rather we observed increased levels of OPA-1 oligomers and increased mitochondrial cristae density, which correlated with the preserved mitochondrial function. Increased DNA binding activity of pCREB and Nrf1/2 and increased SIRT1 activity together with elevated mitochondrial proteins suggest EET-mediated events led to preserved mitobiogenesis.

Using this in vitro system of oxidative stress, we found that there is a significant lag between the appearance of carbonylated proteins and GSH depletion, which seems to be due to the removal of oxidized species early on in the incubation by the mitochondrial Lon protease. Upon acute GSH depletion, protein carbonyls accumulated mostly in  and to a lesser degree in other subcellular fractions that also contain high levels of polyunsaturated lipids. This result is consistent with our previous findings suggesting that lipid hydroperoxides mediate the oxidation of proteins in this system. However, these lipid hydroperoxides are not produced by oxidation of free  or other polyunsaturated free fatty acids by lipooxygenases or cyclooxygenases. Finally, γ-glutamyl semialdehyde and 2-amino-adipic semialdehyde were identified by HPLC as the carbonyl-containing amino  residues, indicating that proteins are carbonylated by metal ion-catalyzed oxidation of lysine, arginine and proline residues. The present findings are important in the context of neurological disorders that exhibit increased lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27807900>Lipid composition of the canine sperm plasma membrane as markers of sperm motility.</a></h2><p>The fatty  composition of the sperm membrane is an important factor involved in the overall sperm quality, including motility. However, in the canine species, the exact composition of the plasma membrane is still unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the plasma membrane lipid composition of motile sperm cells and to compare it with asthenospermic samples, as an attempt to determine possible involvements of membrane lipids in dog sperm cell motility. The sperm-rich fraction of ten mature dogs was collected, and samples were subjected to density gradient centrifugation by Percoll , in order to separate motile and asthenospermic samples. Processed semen samples were evaluated for sperm motility, plasma and acrosome membrane integrity, mitochondrial activity and susceptibility to oxidative stress. Lipid plasma membrane composition was identified by mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). The motile sperm samples presented the following phospholipids in a high frequency in the plasma membrane: phosphatidylcholine 38:4 (composed of stearic and  fatty acids), phosphatidylcholine 36:1 (stearic and oleic fatty acids), phosphatidylethanolamine 34:4 (myristic and  fatty acids), glycerophosphatidic  36:4 (palmitic and  fatty acids), phosphatidylcholine 40:4 plasmanyl and phosphatidylcholine 40:5 plasmenyl. Furthermore, no lipid markers were found in the asthenospermic samples. Results also indicate that differences on plasma membrane composition between motile and asthenospermic samples are crucial factors for determining sperm motility, sperm functionality and susceptibility to oxidative stress. In conclusion, plasma membrane lipid composition varies considerable between motile and asthenospermic samples. Therefore, lipid markers of sperm motility can be considered, such as phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine plasmanyl, phosphatidylcholine plasmenyl and phosphatidic .© 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29551652>Edaravone, a free radical scavenger, protects neuronal cells'  from ischemia by inactivating another new critical factor of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway affecting the  metabolism.</a></h2><p>To investigate the neuroprotective effect of edaravone was dependent on 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) signalling pathway or not. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) were established in SD rats and PC12 cells to mimic ischemic injury. In vivo, edaravone can significantly reduce neurological deficit scores, infarct volume, ROS level and expression of 5-LOX. For in vitro experiment, reduced viability, cell death which occurred via necrosis and apoptosis were shown after OGD and even severer in OGD-reperfusion (OGD-R). Interestingly, edaravone (0.01, 0.1, 1 μmol/L) and caffeic  (5-LOX inhibitor) can dramatically attenuate OGD/OGD-R injuries. Profoundly, mitochondrial transmembrane potential was ameliorated and cristae membranes (detected by electron microscope) were swollen in OGD/OGD-R cells; however, edaravone preserved the normal ultrastructure of  and reduced ROS. Astonishingly, immunohistochemistry analyses showed that 5-LOX was first located in the cytosol, dendrites and nuclei of control cells and then translocated to the nuclear membrane after OGD/OGD-R, which indicated the activation of 5-LOX pathway. Edaravone and caffeic  can inhibit 5-LOX translocation to the nuclear membrane after OGD/OGD-R and reduce cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs), which are metabolites of 5-LOX. Our results are the first to indicate that the protective action of edaravone may function, at least in part, by inhibiting 5-LOX activation, maintaining the ultrastructure and integrated function of , thus protecting neuronal cells from ischemia.

Exposure to EPA and DHA induced apoptosis and increased sensitivity to bortezomib in MM cells. Importantly, they did not affect viability of normal human peripheral mononuclear cells. Messenger RNA expression arrays showed that EPA and DHA modulated genes involved in multiple signaling pathways including nuclear factor (NF) κB, Notch, Hedgehog, oxidative stress and Wnt.

Present study investigated the cytoprotective effects of tryptanthrin on  (AA) + iron-mediated oxidative stress and the molecular mechanisms responsible. In HepG2 cells, pretreatment with tryptanthrin inhibited the cytotoxic effect of AA + iron in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, tryptanthrin prevented the changes in the levels of apoptosis-related proteins, and attenuated reactive oxygen species production, glutathione depletion, and mitochondrial membrane impairment induced by AA + iron. Mechanistic investigations showed that tryptanthrin increased the phosphorylations of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38). Furthermore, inhibition of AMPK or p38 reduced the ability of tryptanthrin to prevent AA + iron-induced cell death and mitochondrial dysfunction. Transfection experiments using AMPK mutants indicated that p38 phosphorylation by tryptanthrin was dependent on AMPK activation. In a phenylhydrazine-induced acute liver injury model, tryptanthrin decreased serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and bilirubin in mice. Additionally, tryptanthrin reduced numbers of degenerating hepatocytes, infiltrating inflammatory cells, 4-hydroxynonenal-, and nitrotyrosine-positive cells in hepatic tissues.

In spermatoid cells and/or in the male reproductive system both enzymes are apparently expressed, and GPX4 serves as anti-oxidative enzyme but also as a structural protein. In this study we explored whether germ line inactivation of the Alox15 gene might rescue male subfertility induced by heterozygous expression of catalytically silent Gpx4. To address this question we employed Gpx4 knock-in mice expressing the Sec46Ala-Gpx4 mutant, in which the catalytic selenocysteine was replaced by a redox inactive alanine. Because homozygous Gpx4 knock-in mice (Sec46Ala-Gpx4) are not viable we created heterozygous animals (Sec46Ala-Gpx4) and crossed them with Alox15 knock-out mice (Alox15). Male Sec46Ala-Gpx4 mice, but not their female littermates, were subfertile. Sperm extracted from the epididymal cauda showed strongly impaired motility characteristics and severe structural midpiece alterations (swollen , intramitochondrial vacuoles, disordered mitochondrial capsule). Despite these structural alterations, they exhibited similar respiration characteristics than wild-type sperm. When Sec46Ala-Gpx4 mice were crossed with Alox15-deficient animals, the resulting males (Sec46Ala-Gpx4+Alox15) showed normalized fertility, and sperm motility was reimproved to wild-type levels. Taken together these data suggest that systemic inactivation of the Alox15 gene normalizes the reduced fertility of male Sec46Ala-Gpx4 mice by improving the motility of their sperm. If these data can be confirmed in humans, ALOX15 inhibitors might counteract male infertility related to GPX4 deficiency.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30135309>Chronic kidney disease attenuates the plasma metabolome response to insulin.</a></h2><p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) leads to decreased sensitivity to the metabolic effects of insulin, contributing to protein energy wasting and muscle atrophy. Targeted metabolomics profiling during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic insulin clamp testing may help identify aberrant metabolic pathways contributing to insulin resistance in CKD. Using targeted metabolomics profiling, we examined the plasma metabolome in 95 adults without diabetes in the fasted state (58 with CKD, 37 with normal glomerular filtration rate [GFR]) who underwent hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. We assessed heterogeneity in fasting metabolites and the response to insulin to identify potential metabolic pathways linking CKD with insulin resistance. Baseline differences and effect modification by CKD status on changes with insulin clamp testing were adjusted for confounders. Mean GFR among participants with CKD was 37.3 compared with 89.3 ml/min per 1.73 m2 among controls. Fasted-state differences between CKD and controls included abnormalities in tryptophan metabolism, ubiquinone biosynthesis, and the TCA cycle. Insulin infusion markedly decreased metabolite levels, predominantly amino acids and their metabolites.

The aim of this work was to characterize the mechanisms of membrane repair by studying lipid acylation and deacylation reactions and their role in oxidative injury in N27 dopaminergic neurons exposed to Fe-overload and Cu-supplementation. N27 dopaminergic neurons incubated with Fe (1 mM) for 24 hs displayed increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation and elevated plasma membrane permeability. Cu-supplemented neurons (10, 50 μM) showed no evidence of oxidative stress markers. A different lipid acylation profile was observed in N27 neurons pre-labeled with [3H]  (AA) or [3H] oleic  (OA). In Fe-exposed neurons, AA uptake was increased in triacylglycerols (TAG) whereas its incorporation into the phospholipid (PL) fraction was diminished. TAG content was 40% higher in Fe-exposed neurons than in controls. This increase was accompanied by the appearance of Nile red positive lipid bodies. Contrariwise, OA incorporation increased in the PL fractions and showed no changes in TAG. Lipid acylation profile in Cu-supplemented neurons showed AA accumulation into phosphatidylserine and no changes in TAG. The inhibition of deacylation/acylation reactions prompted an increase in oxidative stress markers and mitochondrial dysfunction in Fe-overloaded neurons. These findings provide evidence about the participation of lipid acylation mechanisms against Fe-induced oxidative injury and postulate that dopaminergic neurons cleverly preserve AA in TAG in response to oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26095213>Lipid droplets as a novel cargo of tunnelling nanotubes in endothelial cells.</a></h2><p>Intercellular communication is a fundamental process in the development and functioning of multicellular organisms. Recently, an essentially new type of intercellular communication, based on thin membrane channels between cells, has been reported. These structures, termed intercellular or tunnelling nanotubes (TNTs), permit the direct exchange of various components or signals (e.g., ions, proteins, or organelles) between non-adjacent cells at distances over 100 μm. Our studies revealed the presence of tunnelling nanotubes in microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1). The TNTs were studied with live cell imaging, environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering spectroscopy (CARS). Tunneling nanotubes showed marked persistence: the TNTs could connect cells over long distances (up to 150 μm) for several hours. Several cellular organelles were present in TNTs, such as lysosomes and . Moreover, we could identify lipid droplets as a novel type of cargo in the TNTs. Under angiogenic conditions (VEGF treatment) the number of lipid droplets increased significantly.  application not only increased the number of lipid droplets but also tripled the extent of TNT formation. Taken together, our results provide the first demonstration of lipid droplets as a cargo of TNTs and thereby open a new field in intercellular communication research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27491168>[CHANGES IN THE METABOLISM IN THE MYOCARDIUM OF RATS WITH ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION].</a></h2><p>In the myocardium of the rats with arterial hypertension marked increase in the amount of unsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids.

However, the specific contribution of each ATP-generating pathway i.e., oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) versus glycolysis and the biochemical mechanisms involved in the thrombin-induced activation of energy metabolism remain unclear. Here we report an integral analysis on the role of both energy pathways in human platelets activated by several agonists, and the signal transducing mechanisms associated with such activation. We found that thrombin, Trap-6, , collagen, A23187, epinephrine and ADP significantly increased glycolytic flux (3-38 times vs. non-activated platelets) whereas ristocetin was ineffective. OxPhos (33 times) and mitochondrial transmembrane potential (88%) were increased only by thrombin. OxPhos was the main source of ATP in thrombin-activated platelets, whereas in platelets activated by any of the other agonists, glycolysis was the principal ATP supplier. In order to establish the biochemical mechanisms involved in the thrombin-induced OxPhos activation in platelets, several signaling pathways associated with mitochondrial activation were analyzed. Wortmannin and LY294002 (PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitors), ristocetin and heparin (GPIb inhibitors) as well as resveratrol, ATP (calcium-release inhibitors) and PP1 (Tyr-phosphorylation inhibitor) prevented the thrombin-induced platelet activation. These results suggest that thrombin activates OxPhos and glycolysis through GPIb-dependent signaling involving PI3K and Akt activation, calcium mobilization and protein phosphorylation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27916511>Liqustri lucidi Fructus inhibits hepatic injury and functions as an antioxidant by activation of AMP-activated protein kinase in vivo and in vitro.</a></h2><p>Medicinal herbs are used to treat or prevent various diseases, and function to regulate protective mechanisms as nutraceuticals. Fructus Ligustri lucidi is the fruit of Ligustrum lucidum and has been used for its tonic effects on the liver. This study was designed to examine the effects of Fructus Ligustri lucidi water extract (FLL) against severe oxidative stress and mitochondrial impairment in vivo and in vitro and to elucidate its cellular mechanisms of action. Treatment of HepG2 cells with  (AA) + iron successfully induced oxidative stress and apoptosis, as indicated by depletion of glutathione, formation of ROS, decreses in mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), and altered expression of apoptosis-related proteins, such as procaspase-3 and Bcl-xL. FLL treatment significantly blocked these pathological changes and the mitochondrial dysfunction caused by AA + iron, which were similar with the effect of aminoimidazole-carboxamide-β-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR). Moreover, FLL induced the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which was mediated by its upstream kinase LKB1. Inhibition or activation of AMPK revealed the role of AMPK in cellular protection conferred by FLL in LKB1-deficient cells. In mice, oral administration of 100 mg/kg FLL activated AMPK in the liver, and protected against oxidative stress and liver injury induced by CCl injection. Among the components of FLL, chlorogenic  was found to be responsible for the protection of hepatocytes against AA + iron-induced cellular damage. Overall, our results confirmed that FLL has the ability to protect hepatocytes against oxidative injury through regulation of the AMPK signaling pathway.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Bioactive agents such as acetylsalicylic  (ASA) and vitamin E (vE) may affect enzyme activities and could be used in poultry production to control the magnitude of acute phase inflammation. Here, we characterized COX, LOX, and CYP450 mRNA expression levels in chicken immune tissues in response to Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge and investigated whether ASA and vE could alter gene expression. Additionally, for the first time in chickens, we evaluated oxygen consumption by platelet  as a biomarker of  function in response to ASA- and vE. LPS challenge compromised bird growth rates, but neither dietary ASA nor vE significantly ameliorated this effect; however, gradually increasing dietary vE levels were more effective than basal levels. ASA regulated  metabolism, providing an eicosanoid synthesis substrate, whereas gradually increasing vE levels evoked aspirin resistance during challenge. Gene expression in immune tissues was highly variable, indicating a complex regulatory network controlling inflammatory pathways. However, unlike COX-1, COX-2 and CYP450 exhibited increased mRNA expression in some cases, suggesting an initiation of novel anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving signals during challenge. Measuring oxygen consumption rate, we revealed that neither the ASA nor vE levels applied here exerted toxic effects on platelet .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27776414>Mechanism of  Accumulation during Aging in Mortierella alpina: A Large-Scale Label-Free Comparative Proteomics Study.</a></h2><p> (ARA) is an important polyunsaturated fatty  having various beneficial physiological effects on the human body. The aging of Mortierella alpina has long been known to significantly improve ARA yield, but the exact mechanism is still elusive. Herein, multiple approaches including large-scale label-free comparative proteomics were employed to systematically investigate the mechanism mentioned above. Upon ultrastructural observation, abnormal  were found to aggregate around shrunken lipid droplets. Proteomics analysis revealed a total of 171 proteins with significant alterations of expression during aging. Pathway analysis suggested that reactive oxygen species (ROS) were accumulated and stimulated the activation of the malate/pyruvate cycle and isocitrate dehydrogenase, which might provide additional NADPH for ARA synthesis. EC 4.2.1.17-hydratase might be a key player in ARA accumulation during aging. These findings provide a valuable resource for efforts to further improve the ARA content in the oil produced by aging M. alpina.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29589261>Skeletal muscle overexpression of short isoform Sirt3 altered mitochondrial cardiolipin content and fatty  composition.</a></h2><p>Cardiolipin (CL) is a phospholipid at the heart of mitochondrial metabolism, which plays a key role in mitochondrial function and bioenergetics. Among mitochondrial activity regulators, SIRT3 plays a crucial role in controlling the acetylation status of many enzymes participating in the energy metabolism in particular concerning lipid metabolism and fatty  oxidation. Data suggest that possible connection may exist between SIRT3 and CL status that has not been evaluated in skeletal muscle. In the present study, we have characterized skeletal muscle lipids as well as mitochondrial lipids composition in mice overexpressing long (SIRT3-M1) and short (SIRT3-M3) isoforms of SIRT3. Particular attention has been paid for CL. We reported no alteration in muscle lipids content and fatty acids composition between the two mice SIRT3 strains and the control mice. However, mitochondrial CL content was significantly decreased in SIRT3-M3 mice and associated to an upregulation of tafazzin gene expression. In addition, mitochondrial phospholipids and fatty acids composition was altered with an increase in the PC/PE ratio and  content and a reduction in the MUFA/SFA ratio. These modifications in mitochondrial membrane composition are associated with a reduction in the enzymatic activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I and IV. In spite of these mitochondrial enzymatic alterations, skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration remained similar in SIRT3-M3 and control mice. Surprisingly, none of those metabolic alterations were detected in  from SIRT3-M1 mice. In conclusion, our data indicate a specific action of the shorter SIRT3 isoform on lipid mitochondrial membrane biosynthesis and functioning.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27312950>PRKCE gene encoding protein kinase C-epsilon-Dual roles at sarcomeres and  in cardiomyocytes.</a></h2><p>Protein kinase C-epsilon (PKCε) is an isoform of a large PKC family of enzymes that has a variety of functions in different cell types.

In contrast to palmitic , unsaturated fatty acids produced significant increases in intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i) in both cell types. Increases were fatty  specific, dose-dependent and different for each cell type. The  effects on [Ca2+]i were higher in spermatids than in spermatocytes and persisted when residual extracellular Ca2+ was chelated by EGTA, indicating that the increase in [Ca2+]i originated from release of intracellular calcium stores. At the concentrations required for these increases, unsaturated fatty acids produced no significant changes in the plasma membrane potential of or non-specific permeability in spermatogenic cells. For the case of , the [Ca2+]i increases were not caused by its metabolic conversion to eicosanoids or anandamide; thus we attribute this effect to the fatty  itself. As estimated with fluorescent probes, unsaturated fatty acids did not affect the intracellular pH but were able to induce a progressive decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential. The association of this decrease with reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production strongly suggests that unsaturated fatty acids induced mitochondrial uncoupling. This effect was stronger in spermatids than in spermatocytes. As a late event,  induced caspase 3 activation in a dose-dependent manner both in the absence and presence of external Ca2+. The concurrent but differential effects of unsaturated fatty acids on [Ca2+]i and mitochondrial functions are additional manifestations of the metabolic changes that germ cells undergo during their differentiation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27620490>Off-target effect of the cPLA2α inhibitor pyrrophenone: Inhibition of calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum.</a></h2><p>Cytosolic phospholipase A2α (cPLA2α) mediates agonist-induced release of  from membrane phospholipid for production of eicosanoids. The activation of cPLA2α involves increases in intracellular calcium, which binds to the C2 domain and promotes cPLA2α translocation from the cytosol to membrane to access substrate. The cell permeable pyrrolidine-containing cPLA2α inhibitors including pyrrophenone have been useful to understand cPLA2α function. Although this serine hydrolase inhibitor does not inhibit other PLA2s or downstream enzymes that metabolize , we reported that it blocks increases in mitochondrial calcium and cell death in lung fibroblasts. In this study we used the calcium indicators G-CEPIA1er and CEPIA2mt to compare the effect of pyrrophenone in regulating calcium levels in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and  in response to A23187 and receptor stimulation. Pyrrophenone blocked calcium release from the ER and concomitant increases in mitochondrial calcium in response to stimulation by ATP, serum and A23187. In contrast, ER calcium release induced by the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin was not blocked by pyrrophenone suggesting specificity for the calcium release pathway. As a consequence of blocking calcium mobilization, pyrrophenone inhibited serum-stimulated translocation of the cPLA2α C2 domain to Golgi. The ability of pyrrophenone to block ER calcium release is an off-target effect since it occurs in fibroblasts lacking cPLA2α. The results implicate a serine hydrolase in regulating ER calcium release and highlight the importance of careful dose-response studies with pyrrophenone to study cPLA2α function.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Platelet microparticles have been analyzed and classified based on their ultrastructure. The structure and intracellular origin of microparticles depend on the cell-activating stimulus. Thrombin-treated platelets fall apart and form microparticles that contain cellular organelles.Background Platelet-derived microparticles comprise the major population of circulating blood microparticles that play an important role in hemostasis and thrombosis. Despite numerous studies on the (patho)physiological roles of platelet-derived microparticles, mechanisms of their formation and structural details remain largely unknown. Objectives Here we studied the formation, ultrastructure and composition of platelet-derived microparticles from isolated human platelets, either quiescent or stimulated with one of the following activators: , ADP, collagen, thrombin or calcium ionophore A23187. Methods Using flow cytometry, transmission and scanning electron microscopy, we analyzed the intracellular origin, structural diversity and size distributions of the subcellular particles released from platelets. Results The structure, dimensions and intracellular origin of microparticles depend on the cell-activating stimulus. The main structural groups include a vesicle surrounded by one thin membrane or multivesicular structures. Thrombin, unlike other stimuli, induced formation of microparticles not only from the platelet plasma membrane and cytoplasm but also from intracellular structures. A fraction of these vesicular particles having an intracellular origin contained organelles, such as , glycogen granules and vacuoles. The size of platelet-derived microparticles depended on the nature of the cell-activating stimulus. Conclusion The results obtained provide a structural basis for the qualitative differences of various platelet activators, for specific physiological and pathological effects of microparticles, and for development of advanced assays.© 2017 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524483> Alleviates Oxidative Stress-Mediated Liver Injury through Activation of the CaMKK2-AMPK Signaling Pathway.</a></h2><p> (SDT) is used frequently as a herbal prescription to treat deficiency syndromes in traditional Korean medicine. We investigated the hepatoprotective effects of SDT against oxidative stress and attempted to clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms. SDT pretreatment reduced  (AA) plus iron-mediated cytotoxicity in a concentration-dependent manner and prevented changes in apoptosis-related protein expression. In addition, SDT pretreatment significantly reduced glutathione depletion, hydrogen peroxide production, and mitochondrial dysfunction via treatment with AA plus iron. SDT increased the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in accordance with the phosphorylation of Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CaMKK2). Experiments using an AMPK chemical inhibitor (Compound C) or CaMKK2 chemical inhibitor (STO-609) suggested that the CaMKK2-AMPK signaling pathway contributes to SDT-mediated protection of  and cells. Moreover, administration of SDT for 4 consecutive days to mice significantly reduced the alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities induced by carbon tetrachloride, and the numbers of degenerated hepatocytes, infiltrated inflammatory cells, nitrotyrosine-positive cells, and 4-hydroxynonenal-positive cells in liver tissue.

We characterized the ACSL isoforms in a cell line of homogeneous rat beta cells (INS-1 832/13 cells) and human pancreatic islets. ACSL4 and ACSL3 proteins were present in the beta cells and human and rat pancreatic islets and concentrated in insulin secretory granules and less in  and negligible in other intracellular organelles. ACSL1 and ACSL6 proteins were not seen in INS-1 832/13 cells or pancreatic islets. ACSL5 protein was seen only in INS-1 832/13 cells. With shRNA-mediated gene silencing we developed stable ACSL knockdown cell lines from INS-1 832/13 cells. Glucose-stimulated insulin release was inhibited ∼50% with ACSL4 and ACSL3 knockdown and unaffected in cell lines with knockdown of ACSL5, ACLS6 and ACSL1. Lentivirus shRNA-mediated gene silencing of ACSL4 and ACSL3 in human pancreatic islets inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin release. ACSL4 and ACSL3 knockdown cells showed inhibition of ACSL enzyme activity more with arachidonate than with palmitate as a substrate, consistent with their preference for unsaturated fatty acids as substrates. ACSL4 knockdown changed the patterns of fatty acids in phosphatidylserines and phosphatidylethanolamines.

Mitochondrial dysfunction is considered a key factor in the pathogenesis of severe inflammation. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the impact of , omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids, and n-3-derived lipid mediators 18R-HEPE and resolvin (Rv) E1 on mitochondrial function in experimental inflammation. The results revealed that, in contrast to n-6 and n-3 fatty acids, both 18R-HEPE and RvE1 possess anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties. Both mediators are able to restore inflammation-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, which is characterized by a decrease in mitochondrial respiration and membrane potential, as well as an imbalance of mitochondrial fission and fusion. Furthermore, inhibition of mitochondrial fission by Mdivi-1 and Dynasore reduces levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8.

After 4 days of culture in differentiating medium, these cells ceased to proliferate, displayed downregulated ryanodine receptor expression, and responded to specific stimuli with enhanced NADPH-oxidase-derived superoxide formation or cytosolic phospholipase A-dependent  release. We found that the 4-day differentiation process is also associated with downregulated SVCT2 mRNA expression, in the absence of apparent changes in SVCT2 protein expression and transport rate of ascorbic  (AA). Interestingly, under the same conditions, these cells accumulated lower amounts of the vitamin in their , with an ensuing reduced response to external stimuli sensitive to the mitochondrial fraction of AA. Further analyses demonstrated an unexpected increase in mitochondrial SVCT2 protein expression, however, associated with reduced SVCT2-dependent AA uptake in isolated . A decrease in the transporter Vmax, with no change in affinity, was found to account for this response. Differentiation of promonocytic cells to monocytes is therefore characterized by decreased SVCT2 mRNA expression that, even prior to the onset of SVCT2 protein downregulation or apparent changes in plasma membrane transport activity, impacts on the mitochondrial accumulation of the vitamin through a decreased Vmax of the transporter.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27208688>Analysis of the functional aspects and seminal plasma proteomic profile of sperm from smokers.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the effect of smoking on sperm functional quality and seminal plasma proteomic profile.Sperm functional tests were performed in 20 non-smoking men with normal semen quality, according to the World Health Organization (2010) and in 20 smoking patients. These included: evaluation of DNA fragmentation by alkaline Comet assay; analysis of mitochondrial activity using DAB staining; and acrosomal integrity evaluation by PNA binding. The remaining semen was centrifuged and seminal plasma was used for proteomic analysis (liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry). The quantified proteins were used for Venn diagram construction in Cytoscape 3.2.1 software, using the PINA4MS plug-in. Then, differentially expressed proteins were used for functional enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology categories, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Reactome, using Cytoscape software and the ClueGO 2.2.0 plug-in.Smokers had a higher percentage of sperm DNA damage (Comet classes III and IV; P < 0.01), partially and fully inactive  (DAB classes III and IV; P = 0.001 and P = 0.006, respectively) and non-intact acrosomes (P < 0.01) when compared with the control group. With respect to proteomic analysis, 422 proteins were identified and quantified, of which one protein was absent, 27 proteins were under-represented and six proteins were over-represented in smokers. Functional enrichment analysis showed the enrichment of antigen processing and presentation, positive regulation of prostaglandin secretion involved in immune response, protein kinase A signalling and  secretion, complement activation, regulation of the cytokine-mediated signalling pathway and regulation of acute inflammatory response in the study group (smokers).In conclusion, cigarette smoking was associated with an inflammatory state in the accessory glands and in the testis, as shown by enriched proteomic pathways. This state causes an alteration in sperm functional quality, which is characterized by decreased acrosome integrity and mitochondrial activity, as well as by increased nuclear DNA fragmentation.© 2016 The Authors BJU International © 2016 BJU International Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28844762>2-Arachidonoylglycerol metabolism is differently modulated by oligomeric and fibrillar conformations of amyloid beta in synaptic terminals.</a></h2><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent disorder of senile dementia mainly characterized by amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ) deposits in the brain. Cannabinoids are relevant to AD as they exert several beneficial effects in many models of this disease. Still, whether the endocannabinoid system is either up- or down-regulated in AD has not yet been fully elucidated. Thus, the aim of the present paper was to analyze endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) metabolism in cerebral cortex synaptosomes incubated with Aβ oligomers or fibrils. These Aβ conformations were obtained by "aging" the 1-40 fragment of the peptide under different agitation and time conditions. A diminished availability of 2-AG resulting from a significant decrease in diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL) activity was observed in the presence of large Aβ oligomers along with synaptosomal membrane damage, as judged by transmission electron microscopy and LDH release. Conversely, a high availability of 2-AG resulting from an increase in DAGL and lysophosphatidic  phosphohydrolase activities occurred in the presence of Aβ fibrils although synaptosomal membrane disruption was also observed. Interestingly, neither synaptosomal mitochondrial viability assayed by MTT reduction nor membrane lipid peroxidation assayed by TBARS formation measurements were altered by Aβ oligomers or fibrils. These results show a differential effect of Aβ peptide on 2-AG metabolism depending on its conformation.Copyright © 2017 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

CYPs are characterized by carrying out the oxidation of organic compounds and they are mainly recognized as mediators of the biotransformation of xenobiotics to polar hydrophilic metabolites that can be eliminated from the organism. However, these enzymes play a key role in many other physiological processes, being involved in diverse indispensable metabolic pathways since they metabolize many endogenous substrates. Various CYP isoforms are expressed in the brain, and it is believed that this could be in part due to the particular function of brain CYPs. In the brain, CYPs are involved in the cholesterol turnover, the biosynthesis of dopamine, serotonin, morphine, hormones, and protective lipid mediators (epoxyeicosatrienoic acids), in addition to their already recognized role in xenobiotics detoxification and psychotropic drug metabolism. Increasing evidence suggests that this group of enzymes is fundamental for the normal functioning and maintenance of brain homeostasis. This review is focused on highlighting the importance of CYP-mediated endogenous metabolism in the central nervous system (CNS) and its relationship with recent findings regarding CYP involvement in neurodegenerative diseases.

Gamma linolenic  (GLA) is member of the ω-6 family of PUFAs and converts into the  via a series of elongation and desaturation reactions. The aim of the current investigation was to scrutinize the effect of GLA on mitochondrial mediated apoptosis and anti-inflammatory pathway against diethylnitrosamine (DEN) induced HCC.Chemical carcinogenesis in Wistar rats was introduced by an intra-peritoneal dose of DEN (200 mg/kg). The rats received the various doses of GLA for 22 weeks. The progressions of serum biomarkers and histopathology components of hepatic tissue were used to access the prophylactic effects. The antioxidant parameters, cancer preventive agent status, and apoptosis mechanism were reviewed to scrutinize the possible mechanism.Dose-dependent treatment of GLA significantly (<-0.001) modulated the hepatic nodules, hepatic, body weight, antioxidant, and non-hepatic parameters. Curiously, the Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunoblotting showed the GLA altered reduced the hypoxic microenvironment, mitochondrial mediated death apoptosis, and anti-inflammsatory pathways.On the basis of the above results, we can conclude that the GLA exhibited a chemo-protective effect against DEN induced HCC that might be due to the altered hypoxic microenvironment, mitochondrial mediated death apoptosis, and anti-inflammatory pathway, respectively.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27085073>Ultra-trace graphene oxide in a water environment triggers Parkinson's disease-like symptoms and metabolic disturbance in zebrafish larvae.</a></h2><p>Over the past decade, the safety of nanomaterials has attracted attention due to their rapid development.

Using metabolomics, we found that the upregulation of amino  and some fatty acids (e.g. dodecanoic , hexadecanoic , octadecenoic , nonanoic , , eicosanoic , propanoic  and benzenedicarboxylic ) metabolism and the downregulation of some other fatty acids (e.g. butanoic , phthalic  and docosenoic ) are linked to these Parkinson's disease-like symptoms. These findings broaden our understanding of nanomaterial safety at ultra-trace concentrations.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast, fungal cPLA-like proteins are much less characterized and their roles have remained elusive. AoPlaA is a cPLA-like protein in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae which, unlike mammalian cPLA, localizes to . In this study, we investigated the biochemical and physiological functions of AoPlaA. Recombinant AoPlaA produced in E. coli displayed Ca-independent lipolytic activity. Mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that AoPlaA displayed PLA activity to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), but not to other phospholipids, and generated 1-acylated lysoPE. Catalytic site mutants of AoPlaA displayed almost no or largely reduced activity to PE. Consistent with PE-specific activity of AoPlaA, AoplaA-overexpressing strain showed decreased PE content in the mitochondrial fraction. In contrast, AoplaA-disruption strain displayed increased content of cardiolipin. AoplaA-overexpressing strain, but not its counterparts overexpressing the catalytic site mutants, exhibited retarded growth at low temperature, possibly because of the impairment of the mitochondrial function caused by excess degradation of PE. These results suggest that AoPlaA is a novel PE-specific PLA that plays a regulatory role in the maintenance of mitochondrial phospholipid composition.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

CYP-derived AA epoxides, called epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), also promote the growth of tumor epithelia. In cancer cells, CYP AA epoxygenase enzymes are associated with STAT3 and mTOR signaling, but also localize in , where they promote the electron transport chain (ETC). Recently, the diabetes drug metformin was found to inhibit CYP AA epoxygenase activity, allowing the design of more potent biguanides to target tumor growth. Biguanide inhibition of EET synthesis suppresses STAT3 and mTOR pathways, as well as the ETC. Convergence of biguanide activity and eicosanoid biology in cancer has shown a new pathway to attack cancer metabolism and provides hope for improved treatments that target this vulnerability. Inhibition of EET-mediated cancer metabolism and angiogenesis therefore provides a dual approach for targeted cancer therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28442572>The phospholipase iPLAγ is a major mediator releasing oxidized aliphatic chains from cardiolipin, integrating mitochondrial bioenergetics and signaling.</a></h2><p>Cardiolipin (CL) is a dimeric phospholipid with critical roles in mitochondrial bioenergetics and signaling. Recently, inhibition of the release of oxidized fatty acyl chains from CL by the calcium-independent phospholipase Aγ (iPLAγ)-selective inhibitor (R)-BEL suggested that iPLAγ is responsible for the hydrolysis of oxidized CL and subsequent signaling mediated by the released oxidized fatty acids. However, chemical inhibition by BEL is subject to off-target pharmacologic effects. Accordingly, to unambiguously determine the role of iPLAγ in the hydrolysis of oxidized CL, we compared alterations in oxidized CLs and the release of oxidized aliphatic chains from CL in experiments with purified recombinant iPLAγ, germ-line iPLAγ mice, cardiac myocyte-specific iPLAγ transgenic mice, and wild-type mice. Using charge-switch high mass accuracy LC-MS/MS with selected reaction monitoring and product ion accurate masses, we demonstrated that iPLAγ is the major enzyme responsible for the release of oxidized aliphatic chains from CL. Our results also indicated that iPLAγ selectively hydrolyzes 9-hydroxy-octadecenoic  in comparison to 13-hydroxy-octadecenoic  from oxidized CLs. Moreover, oxidative stress (ADP, NADPH, and Fe) resulted in the robust production of oxidized CLs in intact  from iPLAγ mice. In sharp contrast, oxidized CLs were readily hydrolyzed in  from wild-type mice during oxidative stress. Finally, we demonstrated that CL activates the iPLAγ-mediated hydrolysis of  from phosphatidylcholine, thereby integrating the production of lipid messengers from different lipid classes in . Collectively, these results demonstrate the integrated roles of CL and iPLAγ in lipid second-messenger production and mitochondrial bioenergetics during oxidative stress.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30930257>Metabolomics profiling in a mouse model reveals protective effect of Sancao granule on Con A-Induced liver injury.</a></h2><p>Sancao granule (SCG) is a traditional Chinese herb formula, which has been used for autoimmune liver disease for decades. Previous study demonstrated that there was an exactly therapeutic effect of SCG on autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) by improving liver function and alleviating the clinical symptoms. However, studies of the mechanism by which SCG alleviates Con A-induced liver injury (CILI) should be complemented.An ultraperformance liquid chromatography with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF/MS)-based metabolomics approach combined with principle component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminate analysis (OPLS-DA) were integrated applied to obtain metabolites for clarifying mechanisms of disease.In accordance with previously study, the present study demonstrated that SCG could obviously improve the liver injury in mouse induced by Con A via downregulating serum biochemical indexes, alleviating the histological damage and inhibiting the neutrophil infiltration in liver tissues. Different expression of 9 metabolites related to 8 pathways, including fatty  biosynthesis,  metabolisms, linoleic  metabolisms, sphingolipid metabolisms, fatty  elongation in , glycerophospholipid metabolism, fatty  metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism were demonstrated responsible for the efficacy of SCG in treating CILI.In sum up, SCG has been indicated favorable therapeutic effect on Con A induced liver injury. And metabolomics could be a promising approach, which provide insights into mechanisms of SCG in treating CILI.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, we wondered whether salinomycin has another effect such as an anti-oxidant and hepatic protectant, because some chemical drugs treating human diseases were sometimes related with their toxic effects. Therefore, this study was conducted to examine the effects of salinomycin against oxidative stress and mitochondrial impairment in vivo and in vitro as well as the cellular mechanisms of action. In hepatocyte, salinomycin inhibited  (AA) + iron-induced apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production. As a molecular mechanism, salinomycin induced autophagy through AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, as assessed by the accumulation of acidic vesicle organelles, p62 and LC3-II. Moreover, these protective effects were blocked by AMPK inhibition, which indicates the importance of AMPK in the process of salinomycin's effects. In mice, oral administration of salinomycin protected against carbon tetrachloride (CCl)-induced oxidative stress and liver injury, and also activated AMPK as well as autophagy-related proteins in the liver. Collectively, salinomycin had the ability to protect hepatocytes against AA+iron-induced reactive oxygen species production and mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as CCl-induced liver injury. Although this beneficial effect was demonstrated under severe oxidative stress, this study showed that salinomycin protected the liver against the oxidative stress and liver damage through AMPK and autophagy, and suggest that salinomycin has a possibility to treat a broad range of diseases.Copyright © 2018.
