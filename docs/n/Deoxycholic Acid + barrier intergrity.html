Dietary habits are one of the main causative factors for metabolic syndrome, CVD and type 2 diabetes. The human gut microbiota is emerging as an important player in the interaction between diet and metabolic health. Gut microbial communities contribute to human metabolism through fermentation of dietary fibre and the result of intestinal saccharolytic fermentation is production of SCFA. Acetate, propionate and butyrate positively influence satiety, endocrine system, glucose homeostasis, adipogenesis, lipid oxidation, thermoregulation, hepatic gluconeogenesis, endothelial  and gut  integrity, and these mechanisms have all been linked to protection from type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular health. The gut microbiota is also involved in bile  metabolism and regulating their cell signalling potential, which has also been shown to modify pathways involved in metabolic health. Similarly, the gut microbiota renders recalcitrant plant polyphenols into biologically active small phenolic compounds which then act systemically to reduce metabolic disease risk. This review summarises how dietary patterns, specific foods and a healthy lifestyle may modulate metabolic health through the gut microbiota and their molecular cross-talk with the host.</p><p>Keyword: barrier intergrity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10576346>The effects of sodium deoxycholate, lactulose and glutamine on bacterial translocation in common bile duct ligated rats.</a></h2><p>Sepsis is a major cause of post-operative morbidity and mortality in obstructive jaundice as a result of bacterial translocation from the gut. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of glutamine, lactulose, and the bile salt Na deoxycholate in preventing bacterial translocation in an animal model where obstructive jaundice was developed by common bile duct ligation.Fifty Wistar albino rats were divided into 5 groups of 10 animals each. The animals in groups I-IV underwent common bile duct ligation and received, respectively, either saline, Na deoxycholate, lactulose or glutamine, orally. Group V had sham ligation and received saline orally. The animals were sacrificed at the end of the 7th day, and serum concentrations of bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (ALT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (AP) were measured. In addition, mesenteric lymph nodes were removed and cultured together with cecal content. Histopathologic examination of terminal ileum specimens was made.Na deoxycholate, lactulose and glutamine all reduced bacterial translocation rates to mesenteric lymph nodes (p<0.05), with glutamine causing the greatest effect. Na deoxycholate and lactulose prevented bacterial translocation by causing a decrease in cecal intraluminal bacterial content (p<0.001), while glutamine exerted its effect by preserving intestinal mucosal .The  of the intestinal mucosal  is of paramount importance in preventing bacterial translocation, and the measures taken to protect mucosal  reduce bacterial translocation to a greater extent than those taken to decrease the number of bacteria in the gut.</p><p>Keyword: barrier intergrity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17015171>Procyanidins protect Caco-2 cells from bile - and oxidant-induced damage.</a></h2><p>Procyanidins can exert cytoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic actions in the gastrointestinal tract. Previous evidence has shown that procyanidins can interact with synthetic membranes and protect them from oxidation and disruption. Thus, in this study we investigated the capacity of a hexameric procyanidin fraction (Hex) isolated from cocoa to protect Caco-2 cells from  (DOC)-induced cytotoxicity, cell oxidant increase, and loss of monolayer integrity. Hex interacted with the cell membranes without affecting their integrity, as evidenced by a Hex-mediated increase in the transepithelial electrical resistance, and inhibition of DOC-induced cytotoxicity. DOC induced an increase in cell oxidants, alterations in the paracellular transport, and redistribution of the protein ZO-1 from cell-cell contacts into the cytoplasm. Hex partially inhibited all these events at concentrations ranging from 2.5 to 20 microM. Similarly, Hex (5-10 microM) inhibited the increase in cell oxidants, and the loss of integrity of polarized Caco-2 cell monolayers induced by a lipophilic oxidant (2,2'-azobis (2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile). Results show that the assayed procyanidin fraction can interact with cell membranes and protect Caco-2 cells from DOC-induced cytotoxicity, oxidant generation, and loss of monolayer integrity. At the gastrointestinal tract, large procyanidins may exert beneficial effects in pathologies such us inflammatory diseases, alterations in intestinal barrier permeability, and cancer.</p><p>Keyword: barrier intergrity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2880969>The effect of sodium deoxycholate given by gavage with heparin on the histology of the intestinal mucosa of the rat.</a></h2><p>To gain direct insight into the mechanism of sodium deoxycholate (DOC)-induced enhancement of gastroenteral heparin absorption in rats, we performed light and electron microscopic examination of the mucosa of the small intestine of animals treated orally with DOC, heparin or DOC plus heparin. The sole morphological change observed after DOC and DOC plus heparin administration was a marked reduction in the length and distribution of glycocalyx filaments on the microvilli of epithelial cells. The morphological picture had reverted to normal after 24 h, when the promotion of enteral heparin absorption by DOC is greatly reduced.

Effect of bile salt perfusion on duct .</a></h2><p>The property of the pancreatic ductal system that restricts free ionic diffusion has been termed the "pancreatic duct mucosal ," damage to which may be important in the pathogenesis of acute gallstone pancreatitis. The bile-pancreatic duct of the rat (BPD) was perfused in situ with a standard ionic solution. The normal duct was permeable to both chloride and bicarbonate ions, and flux (JCl-, JHCO3-) appeared to occur by passive ionic diffusion. Measurement of absolute ionic flux and transductal potential difference (PD) gave control values of JCl-, +0.92 +/- 0.15 mumol/cm/hr; JHCO3-, -1.71 +/- 0.12 mumol/cm/hr; PD -2.3 +/- 0.20 mV. The preparation was stable over the experimental period, and the results obtained were reproducible between animals. Glycodeoxycholate compromised the  of the BPD with an increase in ionic flux and a reduction in PD with corresponding alterations in mucosal ultrastructure. Increasing concentrations of bile salt produced more severe damage to the BPD. The BPD of the rat is therefore analogous to the pancreatic duct of the cat in possessing a mucosal , and the  is damaged by bile salts. This preparation may be useful for studying pancreatic duct , a concept of importance in the pathogenesis of acute gallstone pancreatitis.</p><p>Keyword: barrier intergrity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18444159>Effect of colonic bacterial metabolites on Caco-2 cell paracellular permeability in vitro.</a></h2><p>One common effect of tumor promoters is increased tight junction (TJ) permeability. TJs are responsible for paracellular permeability and integrity of the barrier function. Occludin is one of the main proteins responsible for TJ structure. This study tested the effects of physiological levels of phenol, ammonia, primary bile acids (cholic , CA, and chenodeoxycholic , CDCA), and secondary bile acids (lithocholic , LCA, and , DCA) on paracellular permeability using a Caco-2 cell model. Paracellular permeability of Caco-2 monolayers was assessed by transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and the apical to basolateral flux of [14C]-mannitol. Secondary, but not primary, bile acids increased permeability as reflected by significantly decreased TER and increased mannitol flux. Both phenol and ammonia also increased permeability. The primary bile  CA significantly increased occludin expression (P < 0.05), whereas CDCA had no significant effect on occludin expression as compared to the negative control. The secondary bile acids DCA and LCA significantly increased occludin expression (P < 0.05), whereas phenol had no significant effect on the protein expression as compared to the negative control. This suggests that the increased permeability observed with LCA, DCA, phenol, and ammonia was not related to an effect on occludin expression. In conclusion, phenol, ammonia, and secondary bile acids were shown to increase paracellular permeability and reduce epithelial barrier function at doses typical of levels found in fecal samples. The results contribute to the evidence these  microflora-generated products have tumor-promoting activity.</p><p>Keyword: barrier intergrity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28554966>The Yin and Yang of bile  action on tight junctions in a model colonic epithelium.</a></h2><p>Gastrointestinal epithelial  loss due to tight junction (TJ) dysfunction and bile -induced diarrhea are common in patients with inflammatory diseases. Although excess colonic bile acids are known to alter mucosal permeability, few studies have compared the effects of specific bile acids on TJ . We report that the primary bile , chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), and its 7-dehydroxylated derivative, lithocholic  (LCA) have opposite effects on epithelial integrity in human colonic T84 cells. CDCA decreased transepithelial  resistance (pore) and increased paracellular 10 kDa dextran permeability (leak), effects that were enhanced by proinflammatory cytokines (PiC [ng/mL]: TNF[10] + IL-1[10] + IFN[30]). CDCA reversed the cation selectivity of the monolayer and decreased intercellular adhesion. In contrast, LCA alone did not alter any of these parameters, but attenuated the effects of CDCA ± PiC on paracellular permeability. CDCA, but not PiC, decreased occludin and not claudin-2 protein expression; CDCA also decreased occludin localization. LCA ± CDCA had no effects on occludin or claudin expression/localization. While PiC and CDCA increased IL-8 production, LCA reduced both basal and PiC ± CDCA-induced IL-8 production. TNF+ IL1ß increased IFN, which was enhanced by CDCA and attenuated by LCA CDCA±PiC increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that was attenuated by LCA Finally, scavenging ROS attenuated CDCA's leak, but not pore actions, and LCA enhanced this effect. Thus, in T84 cells, CDCA plays a role in the inflammatory response causing  dysfunction, while LCA restores  integrity. Understanding the interplay of LCA, CDCA, and PiC could lead to innovative therapeutic strategies for inflammatory and diarrheal diseases.© 2017 The Authors.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress may be involved in this process. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), a known ameliorator of ER stress, on pericyte loss in DR of streptozotocin- (STZ-) induced diabetic mice. To assess the extent of DR, the integrity of retinal vessels and density of retinal capillaries in STZ-induced diabetic mice were evaluated. Additionally, induction of ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) were assessed in diabetic mice and human retinal pericytes exposed to advanced glycation end products (AGE) or modified low-density lipoprotein (mLDL). Fluorescein dye leakage during angiography and retinal capillary density were improved in UDCA-treated diabetic mice, compared to the nontreated diabetic group. Among the UPR markers, those involved in the protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK) pathway were increased, while UDCA attenuated UPR in STZ-induced diabetic mice as well as AGE- or mLDL-exposed retinal pericytes in culture. Consequently, vascular integrity was improved and pericyte loss reduced in the retina of STZ-induced diabetic mice. Our findings suggest that UDCA might be effective in protecting against DR.</p><p>Keyword: barrier intergrity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30634696>Calcium Pyruvate Exerts Beneficial Effects in an Experimental Model of Irritable Bowel Disease Induced by DCA in Rats.</a></h2><p>Pyruvate is a normal constituent of the body that participates in carbohydrate metabolism and functions as a scavenger of free radicals. Calcium pyruvate monohydrate (CPM) is a more stable derivative that has proved its anti-inflammatory effect in experimental colitis, among other disorders, and that could also be considered a source of calcium. Thus, it would be useful for the treatment of diseases with an inflammatory component and a high prevalence of osteoporosis like the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effects of CPM in a rat model of chronic post-inflammatory visceral pain induced by  (DCA) that resembles IBS. Rats were administered DCA for three days intracolonically and then treated daily with CPM (40 and 100 mg/kg) or gabapentin (70 mg/kg) (positive control) by oral gavage for 17 days. The treatments reduced the visceral hypersensitivity measured by response to colorectal distension and referred pain. DCA induced changes in the colonic immune response characterized by increased expression of the cytokine  and the inducible enzyme , which was reduced by the treatments. DCA also decreased the gut expression of the mucins  and , which was normalized by CPM, whereas gabapentin only increased significantly . Moreover, DCA increased the expression of , which was decreased to basal levels by all the treatments. However, the serotonin receptor , which was also elevated, was not affected by any of the treatments, indicating no effect through this signalling pathway. In conclusion, CPM ameliorated the visceral hypersensitivity and the referred pain caused by DCA, being as effective as the control drug. Furthermore, it improved the immune status of the animals, which could contribute to the visceral analgesia and the regeneration of the intestinal epithelial  integrity.</p><p>Keyword: barrier intergrity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8174415>Pancreatic duct mucosa following bile salt injury in cats. Morphology,  function to pancreatic exocrine proteins and vulnerability by activated pancreatic juice.</a></h2><p>We studied pancreatic duct mucosal morphology and  function to both activated and nonactivated pancreatic exocrine proteins following bile salt injury in cats. Prograde pancreatic duct perfusion with 15 mM glycodeoxycholate caused epithelial disruption with focal epithelial loss in the majority of animals. In these cats, flow of preanalyzed nonactivated rat pancreatic juice along the duct resulted in a selective loss of zymogens from the duct lumen as determined by two-dimensional isoelectric focusing-sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Proteins lost had a low isoelectric point (< or = 5.7) and a molecular weight as large as 47,000 Da and included chymotrypsinogen 1, trypsinogens 1 and 2, and procarboxypeptidases B. Proteins with a high isoelectric point (> 5.7), a high molecular weight (> 47,000 Da), or both, were completely recovered from the duct lumen. Flow of activated rat pancreatic juice along a pancreatic duct with bile salt-induced epithelial disruptions caused additional morphologic alterations including an increase in epithelial destruction and occasional necrosis of the duct interstitial and vascular tissue. In some cats, in which the  of the ductal epithelium remained preserved following exposure to the bile salt, neither loss of rat pancreatic exocrine zymogens from the duct lumen nor degradation of the duct mucosa by activated rat pancreatic juice was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><p>Keyword: barrier intergrity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28060943>Farnesoid X Receptor Activation Attenuates Intestinal Ischemia Reperfusion Injury in Rats.</a></h2><p>The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is abundantly expressed in the ileum, where it exerts an enteroprotective role as a key regulator of intestinal innate immunity and homeostasis, as shown in pre-clinical models of inflammatory bowel disease. Since intestinal ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) is characterized by hyperpermeability, bacterial translocation and inflammation, we aimed to investigate, for the first time, if the FXR-agonist obeticholic  (OCA) could attenuate intestinal ischemia reperfusion injury.In a validated rat model of intestinal IRI (laparotomy + temporary mesenteric artery clamping), 3 conditions were tested (n = 16/group): laparotomy only (sham group); ischemia 60min+ reperfusion 60min + vehicle pretreatment (IR group); ischemia 60min + reperfusion 60min + OCA pretreatment (IR+OCA group). Vehicle or OCA (INT-747, 2*30mg/kg) was administered by gavage 24h and 4h prior to IRI. The following end-points were analyzed: 7-day survival; biomarkers of enterocyte viability (L-lactate, I-FABP); histology (morphologic injury to villi/crypts and villus length); intestinal permeability (Ussing chamber); endotoxin translocation (Lipopolysaccharide assay); cytokines (IL-6, IL-1-β, TNFα, IFN-γ IL-10, IL-13); apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3); and autophagy (LC3, p62).It was found that intestinal IRI was associated with high mortality (90%); loss of intestinal integrity (structurally and functionally); increased endotoxin translocation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production; and inhibition of autophagy. Conversely, OCA-pretreatment improved 7-day survival up to 50% which was associated with prevention of epithelial injury, preserved intestinal architecture and permeability. Additionally, FXR-agonism led to decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine release and alleviated autophagy inhibition.Pretreatment with OCA, an FXR-agonist, improves survival in a rodent model of intestinal IRI, preserves the gut   and suppresses inflammation. These results turn FXR into a promising target for various conditions associated with intestinal ischemia.</p><p>Keyword: barrier intergrity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29089630>The food-borne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni depends on the AddAB DNA repair system to defend against bile in the intestinal environment.</a></h2><p>Accurate repair of DNA damage is crucial to ensure genome stability and cell survival of all organisms. Bile functions as a defensive barrier against intestinal  by pathogenic microbes. Campylobacter jejuni, a leading bacterial cause of foodborne illness, possess strategies to mitigate the toxic components of bile. We recently found that growth of C. jejuni in medium with deoxycholate, a component of bile, caused DNA damage consistent with the exposure to reactive oxygen species. We hypothesized that C. jejuni must repair DNA damage caused by reactive oxygen species to restore chromosomal integrity. Our efforts focused on determining the importance of the putative AddAB DNA repair proteins. A C. jejuni addAB mutant demonstrated enhanced sensitivity to deoxycholate and was impaired in DNA double strand break repair. Complementation of the addAB mutant restored resistance to deoxycholate, as well as function of the DNA double strand break repair system. The importance of these findings translated to the natural host, where the AddAB system was found to be required for efficient C. jejuni  of the chicken intestine.

UDCA is also a long-established drug, largely used for the dissolution of cholesterol gallstones, the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis and other hepatobiliary disorders. The history of UDCA is briefly retraced here as well as its multifactorial mechanism of action, based on its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and cytoprotective activities. The present review is centred around the anticancer properties of UDCA and synthetic antitumor derivatives designed over the past 20 years. Paradoxically, depending on the conditions, UDCA exhibits both pro- and anti-apoptotic properties toward different cell types. In particular, the UDCA drug can protect epithelial cells from damages and apoptosis while inducing inhibition of proliferation and apoptotic and/or autophagic death of cancer cells. The effects of UDCA on cancer cell migration, cancer stem cells and drug-induced dysbiosis are also evoked. The drug has revealed modest activities against colon and gastric cancers but may be useful to improve treatments of hepatocellular carcinoma, notably in combination with other drugs such as sorafenib. UDCA can also protect from damages induced by cancer chemotherapeutic agents. The potential of UDCA in cancer, as a chemo-protecting or chemotherapeutic agent, is highlighted here as well as the design of tumour-active derivatives, including UDCA-drug conjugates. A repurposing of UDCA in oncology should be further considered.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The present study evaluated the effect of a PAF antagonist, lexipafant (an (S)-4-methyl-2[methyl-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridin-1-ylmethyl)-benzene sulphonyl]-amino]pentanoic  ethyl ester, BB-882; British Biotech Ltd.), on the potential prevention of  barrier dysfunction, by measuring  origin sepsis, bidirectional permeability of the intestinal barrier, and pancreatic capillary endothelial barrier integrity, in acute pancreatitis induced by intraductal infusion of 5% sodium taurodeoxycholate. Pancreatic endothelial permeability significantly increased in animals with acute pancreatitis, whereas pretreatment with lexipafant had a preventive effect (p < 0.05 vs. pancreatitis with saline). Similarly, alterations noted in hematocrit and plasma levels of lipase and calcium were counteracted by the PAF antagonist. It also prevented the increase in albumin leakage from blood to the mucosal interstitium and from blood to the intestinal lumen in acute pancreatitis. Albumin passage from the  lumen to blood in animals with pancreatitis pretreated with saline increased from 3 h and on, and lexipafant prevented alterations in mucosal epithelial permeability. Bacterial translocation was commonly seen in pancreatitis, whereas only a few positive cultures were observed in pancreatitis animals given lexipafant. Microthrombosis in intestinal villi seemed less frequent after lexipafant pretreatment. We conclude that (a) PAF may play a role in the pathogenesis of pancreatitis-associated intestinal dysfunction, (b) PAF may be involved in the development of distant organ dysfunction by triggering endothelial barrier dysfunction, and (c) PAF antagonists may provide potential agents for preventing pancreatitis-associated  barrier dysfunction.</p><p>Keyword: barrier intergrity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15749636>Effects of fermentation products of pro- and prebiotics on trans-epithelial electrical resistance in an in vitro model of the colon.</a></h2><p>Evidence from in vivo and in vitro studies suggests that the consumption of pro- and prebiotics may inhibit colon carcinogenesis; however, the mechanisms involved have, thus far, proved elusive.

Trans-epithelial electrical resistance measurements indicate Caco-2 monolayer , and we recorded changes to this  following exposure to the fermentation products of selected probiotics and prebiotics, in the form of nondigestible oligosaccharides (NDOs). Our results indicate that NDOs themselves exert varying, but generally minor, effects upon the strength of the tight junctions, whereas the fermentation products of probiotics and NDOs tend to raise tight junction  above that of the controls. This effect was bacterial species and oligosaccharide specific. Bifidobacterium Bb 12 was particularly effective, as were the fermentation products of Raftiline and Raftilose. We further investigated the ability of Raftilose fermentations to protect against the negative effects of  (DCA) upon tight junction . We found protection to be species dependent and dependent upon the presence of the fermentation products in the media at the same time as or after exposure to the DCA.

However, evidence relating to bile acids and intestinal tumorigenesis remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of DCA on the intestinal mucosal  and its impact on the development of CRC.

Apcmin/+ mice receiving DCA increased the number and size of intestinal adenomas and promoted the adenoma-adenocarcinoma sequence. Importantly, DCA induced the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, increased the production of inflammatory cytokines, and led to intestinal low grade inflammation. A reduction of tight junction protein zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) and the number of intestinal cells including goblet cells and Paneth cells was also observed after DCA treatment. Moreover, DCA significantly reduced the level of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), and promoted the polarization of M2 macrophages in the intestine of Apcmin/+ mice.

Bile reflux into the pancreatic duct could play a role but the experimental conditions often employed to induce pancreatitis rarely develop clinically. Here we examined whether low concentrations of bile affect ductal electrophysiology as an indirect measure of ductal epithelial integrity and function in vitro.The main duct was dissected out of freshly harvested bovine pancreata, cut into 1- x 2-cm sections, placed in tissue culture for 48-72 h, then placed in Ussing chambers. Changes in tissue resistance (Rt) and short-circuit current (Isc) were monitored. The responses to forskolin and bile (taurodeoxycholic , TDCA) were examined separately and together.Forskolin (10 microM) produced a decrease in the Isc without a significant change in Rt, suggesting a secretory response, followed by a return to baseline. TDCA caused a similarly reversible decrease in the Isc at low doses, but a persistent drop at higher concentrations. A concurrent drop in Rt was noted at all TDCA concentrations, the duration of which correlated with dosage and degree of histological damage. Prior exposure to low (0.5 mM) doses of TDCA significantly blunted the response to subsequent forskolin challenge.Acute exposure to TDCA in vitro causes epithelial damage at levels lower than those normally used to induce experimental pancreatitis. At the lower concentrations, Rt returns to baseline rapidly, suggesting recovery (restitution) from epithelial damage but with a persistent loss of the response to forskolin. Reflux of minute amounts of bile into the pancreatic duct could play a significant role in the pathogenesis of gallstone pancreatitis by uncoupling the normal stimulus-secretion apparatus of the ductal system and breaking down the epithelial barrier.</p><p>Keyword: barrier intergrity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23203158>A novel mechanism for  barrier dysfunction by dietary fat: epithelial disruption by hydrophobic bile acids.</a></h2><p>Impairment of  barrier is associated with a fat-rich diet, but mechanisms are unknown. We have earlier shown that dietary fat modifies fecal bile acids in mice, decreasing the proportion of ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) vs.  (DCA). To clarify the potential role of bile acids in fat-induced barrier dysfunction, we here investigated how physiological concentrations of DCA and UDCA affect barrier function in mouse intestinal tissue. Bile  experiments were conducted in vitro in Ussing chambers using 4- and 20-kDa FITC-labeled dextrans. Epithelial integrity and inflammation were assayed by histology and Western blot analysis for cyclooxygenase-2. LPS was studied in DCA-induced barrier dysfunction. Finally, we investigated in a 10-wk in vivo feeding trial in mice the barrier-disrupting effect of a diet containing 0.1% DCA. DCA disrupted epithelial integrity dose dependently at 1-3 mM, which correspond to physiological concentrations on a high-fat diet. Low-fat diet-related concentrations of DCA had no effect. In vivo, the DCA-containing diet increased intestinal permeability 1.5-fold compared with control (P = 0.016). Hematoxylin-eosin staining showed a clear disruption of the epithelial barrier by 3 mM DCA in vitro. A short-term treatment by DCA did not increase cyclooxygenase-2 content in colon preparations. UDCA did not affect barrier function itself, but it ameliorated DCA-induced barrier disruption at a 0.6 mM concentration. LPS had no significant effect on barrier function at 0.5-4.5 μg/ml concentrations.

Since the gastroduodenal contents of patients with reflux esophagitis may also contain bile salts, we used our model to determine the effect that a bile salt, taurodeoxycholate (TDC), would have on the esophageal mucosa when combined with either pepsin in an  perfusate (pH 2) or trypsin in an alkaline perfusate (pH 7.5). Indexes of esophageal injury included gross appearance of the mucosa, microscopic examination, and mucosal   as determined by permeability to hydrogen ion. We found that when 5 mM TDC was combined with pepsin (0.3 mg/ml), the gross and microscopic changes of esophagitis, as well as net hydrogen ion flux, were diminished when compared with those observed with pepsin exposure alone. When increasing concentrations of TDC (2 to 10 mM) were added to pepsin, the morphologic degree of injury as well as hydrogen ion flux decreased in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, when 5 mM TDC was combined with trypsin (1000 U/ml) in the alkaline perfusate, the gross and microscopic changes of esophagitis and the net of hydrogen ion flux were increased when compared with either bile salt or trypsin alone. These effects were also dose dependent. These data demonstrate that bile salts present in the gastroduodenal contents of patients with reflux esophagitis have the capacity to modulate the effects of pepsin and trypsin on the esophageal mucosa.</p><p>Keyword: barrier intergrity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23189156>Pharmacological activation of the bile  nuclear farnesoid X receptor is feasible in patients with quiescent Crohn's colitis.</a></h2><p>The bile -activated nuclear receptor Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) is critical in maintaining intestinal barrier integrity and preventing bacterial overgrowth. Patients with Crohn's colitis (CC) exhibit reduced ileal FXR target gene expression. FXR agonists have been shown to ameliorate inflammation in murine colitis models. We here explore the feasibility of pharmacological FXR activation in CC.Nine patients with quiescent CC and 12 disease controls were treated with the FXR ligand chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA; 15 mg/kg/day) for 8 days. Ileal FXR activation was assessed in the fasting state during 6 hrs after the first CDCA dose and on day 8, by quantification of serum levels of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 19. Since FGF19 induces gallbladder (GB) refilling in murine models, we also determined concurrent GB volumes by ultrasound. On day 8 ileal and cecal biopsies were obtained and FXR target gene expression was determined.At baseline, FGF19 levels were not different between CC and disease controls. After the first CDCA dose, there were progressive increases of FGF19 levels and GB volumes during the next 6 hours in CC patients and disease controls (FGF19: 576 resp. 537% of basal; GB volumes: 190 resp. 178% of basal) without differences between both groups, and a further increase at day 8. In comparison with a separate untreated control group, CDCA affected FXR target gene expression in both CC and disease controls, without differences between both groups.Pharmacological activation of FXR is feasible in patients with CC. These data provide a rationale to explore the anti-inflammatory properties of pharmacological activation of FXR in these patients.TrialRegister.nl NTR2009.</p><p>Keyword: barrier intergrity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15356194>Lasting blood-brain  disruption induces epileptic focus in the rat somatosensory cortex.</a></h2><p>Perturbations in the  of the blood-brain  have been reported in both humans and animals under numerous pathological conditions. Although the blood-brain  prevents the penetration of many blood constituents into the brain extracellular space, the effect of such perturbations on the brain function and their roles in the pathogenesis of cortical diseases are unknown. In this study we established a model for focal disruption of the blood-brain  in the rat cortex by direct application of bile salts. Exposure of the cerebral cortex in vivo to bile salts resulted in long-lasting extravasation of serum albumin to the brain extracellular space and was associated with a prominent activation of astrocytes with no inflammatory response or marked cell loss. Using electrophysiological recordings in brain slices we found that a focus of epileptiform discharges developed within 4-7 d after treatment and could be recorded up to 49 d postoperatively in >60% of slices from treated animals but only rarely (10%) in sham-operated controls. Epileptiform activity involved both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission. Epileptiform activity was also induced by direct cortical application of native serum, denatured serum, or albumin-containing solution. In contrast, perfusion with serum-adapted electrolyte solution did not induce abnormal activity, thereby suggesting that the exposure of the serum-devoid brain environment to serum proteins underlies epileptogenesis in the blood-brain -disrupted cortex. Although many neuropathologies entail a compromised blood-brain , this is the first direct evidence that it may have a role in the pathogenesis of focal cortical epilepsy, a common neurological disease.</p><p>Keyword: barrier intergrity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2050752>The effect of bile salts on the permeability and ultrastructure of the perfused, energy-depleted, rat blood-brain .</a></h2><p>The action of bile salts upon the rat blood-brain  (BBB) was assessed in the absence of energy-yielding metabolism. Brains were perfused in situ with a Ringer solution for 5 min followed by a 1 min perfusion containing either sodium deoxycholate (DOC), taurochenodeoxycholate (TCDC), or Ringer/DNP. The  of the BBB was then determined by perfusing with the radiotracer [14C]mannitol for 2.5 min. Alternatively, the brains were perfusion fixed for ultrastructural assessment. At 0.2 mM DOC, the BBB remained intact and the cerebral ultrastructure was similar to the controls. At 1 mM and above, disruption of the BBB became evident. At 2 mM, the cerebral cortex became severely vacuolated, with damaged endothelium and collapsed capillaries. With TCDC, BBB disruption occurred at 0.2 mM without any apparent ultrastructural damage to the microvasculature. Following 2 mM TCDC, similar, but less widespread, structural changes to the 2 mM DOC-perfused animals was apparent. Opening of the BBB occurred at a concentration lower than that required to cause lysis of either red blood cells or cultured cerebral endothelial cells. It is proposed that the effect of bile salts at concentrations of 1.5 mM and above is largely due to their lytic action as strong detergents on endothelial cell membranes, but that at lower concentrations a more subtle modification of the BBB occurs.</p><p>Keyword: barrier intergrity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21878234>Bile salt supplementation acts via the farnesoid X receptor to alleviate lipopolysaccharide-induced intestinal injury.</a></h2><p>Intestinal barrier integrity may be disrupted in many conditions allowing for bacterial invasion and ensuing systemic illness. We investigated the efficacy and mechanism of bile salts in protecting the intestinal mucosa integrity after injury through stimulation of cell proliferation and an increased resistance to apoptosis.Over 7 days, wild-type C57Bl/6J and Nr1h4(tm1Gonz)/J (farnesoid X receptor [FXR] knockout) male mice received either liquid rodent chow alone (for control animals) or with added 50 mg/kg per day of taurodeoxycholic  (TDCA; for experimental animals). On day 6, all mice received 10 mL/kg of lipopolysaccharide intraperitoneally. On day 7, small intestines were harvested. After immunohistochemistry with hematoxylin and eosin, activated caspase-3, and 5-bromo2'-deoxy-uridine (BrdU), mean proliferating and apoptotic cells were determined with light microscopy. In vitro, FXR proteins were immunoblotted from cultured cells after exposure to TDCA. FXR expression was then inhibited in the presence and absence of TDCA. Intestinal epithelial proliferation along with c-Myc and FXR protein expressions were determined.C57Bl/6J mice exhibited significant mucosal enterocyte proliferation and decreased mucosal enterocyte apoptosis when provided with supplemental TDCA in their diet. Inhibition of FXR, both in vivo and in vitro, prevented the bile salt-induced enterocyte proliferation and resistance to apoptosis. TDCA exposure stimulated nuclear translocation of FXR resulting in increased expression of c-Myc.A diet supplemented with bile salts, especially in patients who have decreased luminal bile salt, may prove beneficial and therapeutic in critical illness where intestinal injury is part of the spectrum.Copyright © 2011 Mosby, Inc.
