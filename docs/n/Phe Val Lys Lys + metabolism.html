Trial 1 determined retention of nutrients and apparent metabolizable energy corrected by nitrogen (AMEn). One reference diet (RD) protein-free (85% corn based) was fortified to determine the WB nutrient retention coefficient. Trial 2 determined standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of AA, when pancreas and liver were weighed. An additional group of bird was fed with an RD with 5% casein-corn starch diet, fortified with vitamins and minerals to quantify the endogenous fraction and determine SID of AA. For each trial, the test diets were made by mixing RD and WB 7:3 (wt/wt) and fed without or with MC or Phy or combination. Male broilers (Cobb 500), 245 d old, were allocated to five treatments to give seven replicates (seven birds/cage). The birds were fed a commercial diet from day 0 to10 followed by Trial 1 diets from day 11 to 18 and finally Trial 2 diets from day 19 to 21. Excreta samples were collected on days 15-18 and all birds were slaughtered on day 21 for ileal digesta. There was an interaction (P < 0.05) between MC and Phy on retention of DM, N, P, and AMEn. An interaction (P < 0.05) was also observed on SID of Arg, His, Leu, , , Thr, , Asp, Cys, Glu, and Ser. Responses of MC plus Phy supplementation were higher (P < 0.05) on overall SID of AA by 6.05% (75.18 to 94.26%), compared with responses for MC (2.35%; 72.04 to 88.97) or Phy (3.46%; 73.27 to 92.13). Liver and pancreas weights were affected (P < 0.05) by the single MC supplementation. The MC and Phy combination may be an effective strategy to improve AA utilization of WB in broiler chickens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28187204>Differentiating founder and chronic HIV envelope sequences.</a></h2><p>Significant progress has been made in characterizing broadly neutralizing antibodies against the HIV envelope glycoprotein Env, but an effective vaccine has proven elusive. Vaccine development would be facilitated if common features of early founder virus required for transmission could be identified. Here we employ a combination of bioinformatic and operations research methods to determine the most prevalent features that distinguish 78 subtype B and 55 subtype C founder Env sequences from an equal number of chronic sequences. There were a number of equivalent optimal networks (based on the fewest covarying amino acid (AA) pairs or a measure of maximal covariance) that separated founders from chronics: 13 pairs for subtype B and 75 for subtype C. Every subtype B optimal solution contained the founder pairs 178-346 Asn-, 232-236 Thr-Ser, 240-340 -, 279-315 Asp-, 291-792 Ala-Ile, 322-347 Asp-Thr, 535-620 Leu-Asp, 742-837 Arg-, and 750-836 Asp-Ile; the most common optimal pairs for subtype C were 644-781 -Ala (74 of 75 networks), 133-287 Ala-Gln (73/75) and 307-337 Ile-Gln (73/75). No pair was present in all optimal subtype C solutions highlighting the difficulty in targeting transmission with a single vaccine strain. Relative to the size of its domain (0.35% of Env), the α4β7 binding site occurred most frequently among optimal pairs, especially for subtype C: 4.2% of optimal pairs (1.2% for subtype B). Early sequences from 5 subtype B pre-seroconverters each exhibited at least one clone containing an optimal feature 553-624 (Ser-Asn), 724-747 (Arg-Arg), or 46-293 (Arg-Glu).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535386>Digestibility of amino acid in full-fat canola seeds, canola meal, and canola expellers fed to broiler chickens and pigs.</a></h2><p>Canola products including full-fat canola seeds (FFCS), canola meal (CM), and canola expellers (CE) have been used in diets for both broiler chickens and pigs. However, their ability to utilize the AA in canola products might be different from each other. Therefore, this study was conducted to compare the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of CP and AA in broiler chickens and growing pigs fed FFCS, CM, and CE. Three diets were prepared to contain FFCS, CM, or CE as a sole source of nitrogen. A nitrogen-free diet was prepared. In Exp. 1, a total of 272 twenty-one-day-old male broiler chickens with an initial BW of 932 ± 80.6 g were assigned to diets in a randomized complete block design with BW as a blocking factor. After 5 d of feeding, birds were euthanized by sodium pentobarbital, and ileal digesta samples were collected from distal two-third of the ileum. In Exp. 2, 16 barrows were surgically fitted with T-cannulas at the distal ileum. After 8-d recovery period, pigs (initial BW = 18.9 ± 1.17 kg) were divided into 4 blocks based on BW and assigned to a quadruplicate 4 × 2 incomplete Latin Square design with 4 diets and 2 periods. Each period consisted of 5-d adaptation and 2-d ileal digesta collection periods. Data were analyzed as a 2 × 3 factorial treatment arrangement with effects of species (broiler chickens or pigs) and diets (FFCS, CM, or CE). There were interactions (P < 0.05) between species and experimental diets in the AID of all indispensable AA except for . The AID of indispensable AA in FFCS for broiler chickens was greater (P < 0.05) than for pigs. Broiler chickens also had greater (P < 0.05) AID of Arg, His, Leu, , and  in CM compared with pigs; however, there were no differences in the AID of indispensable AA in CE between broiler chickens and pigs. The basal ileal endogenous losses of CP and AA, except Trp, in pigs were greater (P < 0.05) than in broiler chickens. There were also interactions (P < 0.05) between species and experimental diets in the SID of all indispensable AA except for . Broiler chickens fed the diet containing FFCS had greater (P < 0.05) SID of indispensable AA compared with pigs fed the same diet; however, the SID of indispensable AA in CM or CE were not different between broiler chickens and pigs. In conclusion, differences in digestibility of AA in canola products were affected by nonruminant animal species.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25951981>Requirement of standardized ileal digestible valine to lysine ratio for 8- to 14-kg pigs.</a></h2><p>The objective was to define the  requirement for weaned piglets in the context of reducing the dietary protein content. A dose-response experiment was conducted to estimate the standardized ileal digestible (SID)  to  ratio required to support the optimum growth of post-weaned piglets. In this study, 96 pigs weighing 8 kg were allotted to one of six dietary treatments (16 pigs for each dietary treatment) and were housed individually. Diets were formulated to provide 0.58, 0.62, 0.66, 0.70, 0.74 and 0.78 SID  :  by adding graded levels of crystalline l- to the 0.58 SID  :  diet. Lysine was sub-limiting and supplied 90% of the recommendation (10.95 g SID /kg equal to 11.8 g/kg total ). Average daily feed intake (ADFI), average daily gain (ADG) and gain to feed ratio (G : F) were determined during a 14-day period of ad libitum feeding. Blood and urine samples were taken at the end of each week (day 7 and 14 of the experiment) 3 h after feeding the experimental diets. The maximum ADFI and ADG were obtained in pigs fed the 0.78 SID  :  diet; it was not different from the results of pigs fed 0.70 SID  :  diet. The highest G : F was obtained in pigs fed 0.70 SID  : . The plasma concentration of  increased linearly (P<0.001) as the dietary SID  :  increased. The increasing dietary  :  also resulted in a linear increase in Cys (P<0.001) and a quadratic increase in Arg (P=0.003),  (P=0.05) and  (P=0.009). The plasma Gly showed a quadratic decrease (P=0.05) as the dietary  :  increased. Neither plasma nor urinary urea to creatinine ratio was affected by treatment. The minimum SID  :  required to maximize ADFI, ADG and G : F was estimated at 0.67 SID  :  by a broken-line model, and at 0.71 SID  :  by a curvilinear plateau model. The  deficiency caused a reduction in ADFI, and  supplementation above the requirement did not impair animal performance. In conclusion, 0.70 SID  :  is suggested as the  requirement for 8 to 14 kg individually housed pigs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26020311>Low-protein amino acid-supplemented diets for growing pigs: effect on expression of amino acid transporters, serum concentration, performance, and carcass composition.</a></h2><p>Pigs fed protein-bound AA appear to have a higher abundance of AA transporters for their absorption in the jejunum compared with the duodenum. However, there is limited data about the effect of dietary free AA, readily available in the duodenum, on the duodenal abundance of AA transporters and its impact on pig performance. Forty-eight pigs (24.3 kg initial BW) distributed in 4 treatments were used to evaluate the effect of the CP level and form (free vs. protein bound) in which AA are added to diets on the expression of AA transporters in the 3 small intestine segments, serum concentration of AA, and performance. Dietary treatments based on wheat and soybean meal (SBM) were 1) low-CP (14%) diet supplemented with L-, L-Thr, DL-Met, L-Leu, L-Ile, L-, L-His, L-Trp, and L- (LPAA); 2) as in the LPAA but with added L-Gly as a N source (LPAA+N); 3) intermediate CP content (16%) supplemented with L- HCl, L-Thr, and DL-Met (MPAA); and 4) high-CP (22%) diet (HP) without free AA. At the end of the experiment, 8 pigs from LPAA and HP were sacrificed to collect intestinal mucosa and blood samples and to dissect the carcasses. There were no differences in ADG, ADFI, G:F, and weights of carcass components and some visceral organs between treatments. Weights of the large intestine and kidney were higher in HP pigs (P < 0.01). Expression of b(0,+) in the duodenum was higher in pigs fed the LPAA compared with the HP diet (P= 0.036) but there was no difference in the jejunum and ileum. In the ileum, y+ L expression tended to be higher in pigs fed the LPAA diet (P = 0.098). Expression of b(0,+) in LPAA pigs did not differ between the duodenum and the jejunum, but in HP pigs, the expression of all AA transporters was higher in the jejunum than in the duodenum or ileum (P < 0.05). The serum concentration of Arg, His, Ile, Leu, , and  was higher but serum  and Met were lower in pigs fed the HP diet (P < 0.05). These results indicate that LPAA can substitute up to 8 percentage units of protein in HP wheat-SBM diets without affecting pig performance; nonessential N does not seem to be limiting in very low-protein wheat-SBM diets for growing pigs. Also, the inclusion of free AA in the diet appears to affect their serum concentration and the expression of the AA transporter b0,+ in the duodenum of pigs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26726739>Medicinal Chemistry Focusing on Aggregation of Amyloid-β.</a></h2><p>The aggregation of peptides/proteins is intimately related to a number of human diseases. More than 20 have been identified which aggregate into fibrils containing extensive β-sheet structures, and species generated in the aggregation processes (i.e., oligomers and fibrils) contribute to disease development. Amyloid-β peptide (designated Aβ), related to Alzheimer's disease (AD), is the representative example. The intensive aggregation property of Aβ also leads to difficulty in its synthesis. To improve the synthetic problem, we developed an O-acyl isopeptide of Aβ1-42, in which the N-acyl linkage (amide bond) of Ser(26) was replaced with an O-acyl linkage (ester bond) at the side chain. The O-acyl isopeptide demonstrated markedly higher water-solubility than that of Aβ1-42, while it quickly converted to intact monomer Aβ1-42 via an O-to-N acyl rearrangement under physiological conditions. Inhibition of the pathogenic aggregation of Aβ1-42 might be a therapeutic strategy for curing AD. We succeeded in the rational design and identification of a small molecule aggregation inhibitor based on a pharmacophore motif obtained from cyclo[--Leu----]. Moreover, the inhibition of Aβ aggregation was achieved via oxygenation (i.e., incorporation of oxygen atoms to Aβ) using an artificial catalyst. We identified a selective, cell-compatible photo-oxygenation catalyst of Aβ, a flavin catalyst attached to an Aβ-binding peptide, which markedly decreased the aggregation potency and neurotoxicity of Aβ.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27696676>Severity of experimental traumatic brain injury modulates changes in concentrations of cerebral free amino acids.</a></h2><p>In this study, concentrations of free amino acids (FAA) and amino group containing compounds (AGCC) following graded diffuse traumatic brain injury (mild TBI, mTBI; severe TBI, sTBI) were evaluated. After 6, 12, 24, 48 and 120 hr aspartate (Asp), glutamate (Glu), asparagine (Asn), serine (Ser), glutamine (Gln), histidine (His), glycine (Gly), threonine (Thr), citrulline (Cit), arginine (Arg), alanine (Ala), taurine (Tau), γ-aminobutyrate (GABA), tyrosine (Tyr), S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), l-cystathionine (l-Cystat), valine (), methionine (Met), tryptophane (Trp), phenylalanine (), isoleucine (Ile), leucine (Leu), ornithine (Orn), lysine (), plus N-acetylaspartate (NAA) were determined in whole brain extracts (n = 6 rats at each time for both TBI levels). Sham-operated animals (n = 6) were used as controls. Results demonstrated that mTBI caused modest, transient changes in NAA, Asp, GABA, Gly, Arg. Following sTBI, animals showed profound, long-lasting modifications of Glu, Gln, NAA, Asp, GABA, Ser, Gly, Ala, Arg, Citr, Tau, Met, SAH, l-Cystat, Tyr and . Increase in Glu and Gln, depletion of NAA and Asp increase, suggested a link between NAA hydrolysis and excitotoxicity after sTBI. Additionally, sTBI rats showed net imbalances of the Glu-Gln/GABA cycle between neurons and astrocytes, and of the methyl-cycle (demonstrated by decrease in Met, and increase in SAH and l-Cystat), throughout the post-injury period. Besides evidencing new potential targets for novel pharmacological treatments, these results suggest that the force acting on the brain tissue at the time of the impact is the main determinant of the reactions ignited and involving amino acid metabolism.© 2016 The Authors.

The hydrazinecarbothioamides 1-6 were synthesized from the reaction between phenylhydrazine and isothiocyanates, for which three different methods have been employed, namely stirring at room temperature, by microwave irradiation or by mechanochemical grinding. Quantitative yields were obtained for the later technique. Compound 4 showed the best value for tyrosinase inhibition (IC = 22.6 µM), which occurs through an uncompetitive mechanism. Molecular docking results suggested that 4 can interact via T-stacking with the substrate L-DOPA and via hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic forces with the amino acid residues Ala-79, His-243, -247, -263, -282, and Glu-321. The interaction between human serum albumin (HSA) and compound 4 occurs through a ground state association and does not perturb the secondary structure of the albumin as well as the microenvironment around Tyr and Trp residues. The binding is spontaneous, moderate and occurs mainly in the Sudlow's site I. Molecular docking results suggested hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions as the main binding forces between the compound 4 and the amino acid residues -198, Trp-214, Glu-449, Leu-452, and Leu-480.Copyright © 2018.

A crossover-designed experiment was conducted utilizing two 7-d periods with 8 pigs (30.8 kg initial BW) surgically fitted with T-type cannulas at the terminal ileum to analyze the effect of HS on both apparent (AID) and standardized (SID) ileal digestibility of AA in pigs fed a wheat-soybean meal diet. Subcutaneous skin and ileal lumen temperatures were continuously monitored in 15-min intervals during the entire experiment. After recovery from surgery, all pigs were adapted to the diet and trained to consume the same amount of feed twice a day for 5 d in thermal-neutral (TN) conditions (22°C ± 2°C). Following adaptation, pigs were divided into 2 groups (4 pigs each); 1 remained in TN conditions, and the other group was exposed to natural HS (24°C to 45°C) for 7 d (period 1). In period 2, the 2 groups switched environments. Ileal digesta were continuously collected for 12 h, starting at 0700 h, on d 6 and 7 of each period. Chromic oxide was used as an indicator of intestinal digesta flow. The subcutaneous and the ileal temperatures were increased between 1.3°C and 1.6°C in HS compared to TN pigs ( < 0.001). The AID of AA (%) for the TN and HS pigs were Arg, 90.6, 88.1; His, 88.7, 85.9; Ile, 84.8, 83.9; Leu, 86.9, 84.1; , 86.8, 86.2; Met, 89.8, 89.1; , 86.0, 84.8; Thr, 76.7, 74.3; and , 82.8, 81.7, respectively. The SID (%) of AA for the TN and HS pigs were Arg, 94.0, 92.0; His, 92.5, 90.2; Ile, 89.5, 88.1; Leu, 90.1, 88.6; , 91.0, 90.1; Met, 94.4, 93.6; , 90.4, 88.9; Thr, 86.0, 83.7; and , 88.1, 86.5, respectively. The AID of Arg, His, and Leu was lower ( < 0.01) in HS pigs, and the SID of Arg and His was also lower in HS pigs. Neither the AID nor the SID of the remaining essential AA was affected by HS. In summary, the digestibility of essential AA is differentially affected in pigs exposed to natural HS, and thus, special attention should be given to Arg and His when formulating diets for growing pigs under HS conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27328781>Antifungal membranolytic activity of the tyrocidines against filamentous plant fungi.</a></h2><p>The tyrocidines and analogues are cyclic decapeptides produced by Brevibacillus parabrevis with a conserved sequence of cyclo(D--Pro-X-x-Asn-Gln-X--X-Leu) with Trp/ in the aromatic dipeptide unit, /Orn as their cationic residue and Tyr (tyrocidines), Trp (tryptocidines) or  (phenicidines) in position 7. Previous studies indicated they have a broad antifungal spectrum with the peptides containing a Tyr residue in position 7 being more active than those with a  or Trp residue in this position. Detailed analysis of antifungal inhibition parameters revealed that -D- in the aromatic dipeptide unit lead to more consistent activity against the three filamentous fungi in this study. These peptides exhibited high membrane activity and fast leakage kinetics against model membranes emulating fungal membranes, with selectivity towards ergosterol containing membranes. More fluid membranes and doping of liposomes with the sphingolipid, glucosylceramide, led to a decreased permeabilising activity. Peptide-induced uptake of membrane impermeable dyes was observed in hyphae of both Fusarium solani and Botrytis cinerea, with uptake more pronounced at the hyphal growth tips that are known to contain ergosterol-sphigolipid rich lipid rafts. Tyrocidine interaction with these rafts may lead to the previously observed fungal hyperbranching. However, the leakage of model membranes and Bot. cinerea did not correlate directly with the antifungal inhibition parameters, indicating another target or mode of action. Proteinase K treatment of target fungi had a minimal influence or even improved the tyrocidine activity, ruling out a mannoprotein target in the fungal cell wall. β-glucanase treatment of Bot. cinerea did not significantly affect the tyrocidine activity, but there was a significant loss in activity towards the β-glucanase treated F. solani. This study showed the tyrocidine antifungal membrane activity is selective towards ergosterol and possibly lipid rafts, but also point to additional targets such as the cell wall β-glucans that could modulate their activity.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

Five female pigs (22.8 ± 1.6 kg BW), with catheters in the portal vein, ileal vein, and carotid artery, were fed 3 isocaloric-nitrogenous diets at 4% of their BW once daily at 0900 h for 7 d in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square design. The diets contained corn and soybean meal with 0% (control) or 30% distillers' dried grains with solubles (DDGS; HF) produced from a 1:1 mixture of wheat and corn. The third diet was supplemented with MC in addition to the 30% DDGS (HF + MC). The MC supplied (analyzed values) 5,397 U of xylanase, 162 U of β-glucanase, and 2,000 U of protease and guaranteed minimum activities of 1,000 U of α-amylase and 25 U of pectinase per kg of diet. On d 7, para-amino hippuric acid was infused into the ileal vein (to measure flow rate), and blood was sampled from the portal vein and carotid artery for 7 h after feeding to assay EAA, urea-N, and VFA. Portal absorption of nutrients was derived by multiplying the porto-arterial plasma concentration differences by portal vein blood flow. Diet had no effect on postprandial portal vein plasma flow rate and net BUN flux, but portal BUN tended to be lower ( = 0.070) and arterial BUN was lower ( 0.05) over the 7 h in pigs fed control. Postprandial portal Arg, Ile, Leu, Trp, and  or net fluxes were lower ( 0.05) in HF-fed pigs from 30 to 240 min than control-fed pigs and MC supplementation tended (0.05 ≤ ≤ 0.10) to or improved ( 0.05) portal appearances of those AA, but not their fluxes. Control-fed pigs had higher ( 0.05) net portal fluxes of most EAA and pigs fed HF + MC had higher ( 0.05) , and similar Met and  net portal fluxes were compared with control-fed pigs. Portal VFA was not affected by diet. However, total portal VFA flux was lower ( 0.05) in the HF-fed pigs than in the control pigs. The MC supplementation improved the total portal VFA flux, although it did not improve arterial VFA concentration relative to the HF diet. In conclusion, supplementing the HF diet with MC improved net portal appearance of some EAA and fluxes of total VFA, whereas fluxes of EAA did not change. The HF diet increased EAA demand by the PDV, but MC addition was not able to reduce this demand.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30329054>Immune system stimulation induced by Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide alters plasma free amino acid flux and dietary nitrogen utilization in growing pigs.</a></h2><p>Changes in plasma free AA flux reflect the modification of AA metabolism in different metabolic states. Immune system stimulation (ISS) in growing pigs may redistribute AA from protein retention towards processes involved in the immune response, thus impacting AA utilization. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effect of ISS on whole-body nitrogen (N) utilization and the kinetics of plasma free AA. Ten gilts (BW 9.4 ± 1.1 kg) were surgically fitted with jugular vein catheters, individually housed in metabolism crates, and feed-restricted (550 g/d). Repeated intramuscular injections of increasing amounts of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were used to induce ISS (30 and 36 µg/kg BW, given 48 h apart). Whole-body N-balance was determined for 3-d before ISS (ISS-) and 3-d during ISS (ISS+). At the end of each N-balance period, a bolus dose of labeled [U-13C, U-15N]-AA mixture (Ile, Leu, , Met, , Thr, Trp, , and Gln) was infused intravenously, followed by serial blood collection for determination of isotopic enrichment. A double exponential model was fitted with plasma enrichment data for each pig and each AA, and equation parameters were used to estimate plasma-free AA flux and pool size. Apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of N was determined using the slaughter technique and an indigestible marker. Blood samples were collected before and 76-h after the initiation of ISS and assayed for hematology and blood chemistry. Body temperature (BT) was monitored during the course of study. Blood chemistry, hematology, and BT results indicated that LPS induced effective ISS in pigs (P < 0.05). ISS tended to reduce N retention (P = 0.09) and the N retention-to-N intake ratio (P = 0.08). Apparent total tract digestibility of dietary energy and AID of N were reduced by ISS (P < 0.05). Plasma flux (µmol/kg BW/h) for Ile and  was reduced by ISS (P < 0.05). Strong tendencies for decreased  flux and N retention were observed in ISS pigs (P < 0.10). ISS increased the pool size for Leu but reduced the pool size for Ile (P < 0.05). Collectively, these results suggest that ISS alters the utilization of dietary N and AA flux, as well as pool size in growing pigs. The decrease in , , and Ile flux during ISS may be attributed to a reduction in whole-body protein synthesis or decreased catabolism of these AA. Relative to other AA, dietary , , and Ile requirements may decrease in ISS pigs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25864055>Changes in mammary  in response to the provision of an ideal amino acid profile at 2 levels of metabolizable protein supply in dairy cows: Consequences on efficiency.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to compare the modifications in mammary gland  by supplying an ideal versus an imbalanced essential AA (EAA) profile at low and high metabolizable protein (or PDIE, its equivalent in the INRA feeding system). Four lactating, multiparous Holstein cows received 4 treatments composed of 2 basal diets containing 2 levels of PDIE (LP or HP) and 2 different infusions of AA mixtures (AA- or AA+) in the duodenum. The AA+ mixture contained , Met, Leu, His, Ile, , , Arg, Trp, and Glu, whereas the AA- mixture contained Glu, Pro, and Ser. The infusion mixtures were iso-PDIE. The diet plus infusions provided 13.9 versus 15.8% of crude protein that corresponded to 102 versus 118g/kg of dry matter of PDIE in LP and HP treatments, respectively. The treatments were designed as a 2×2 crossover design of 2 levels of PDIE supply (LP vs. HP) with 28-d periods. Infusions of AA in the duodenum (AA- vs. AA+) were superimposed to diet within each 28-d period according to 2×2 crossover designs with 14-d subperiods. Increasing the PDIE supply tended to increase milk protein yield; however, the efficiency of PDIE utilization decreased and the plasma urea concentration increased, indicating a higher catabolism of AA. The AA+ treatments increased milk protein yield and content similarly at both levels of protein supply. This was explained by an increase in the mammary uptake of all EAA except His and Trp. The mammary uptake of non-EAA (NEAA) was altered to the increase in EAA uptake so that the total AA uptake was almost equal to milk protein output on a nitrogen basis. The ratio between NEAA to total AA uptake decreased from 46% in LPAA- to 40% in LPAA+, HPAA-, and HPAA+ treatments. The PDIE efficiency tended to increase in the AA+ versus the AA- treatments because the NEAA supply and the amount of NEAA not used by the mammary both decreased. Nevertheless, our AA+ treatments seemed not to be the ideal profile: the mammary uptake-to-output ratio for Thr was higher than 1 in LPAA-, but it decreased to 1 in all the other treatments, suggesting that Thr was deficient in these treatments. Conversely, an excess of His was indicated because its uptake was similar in AA+ and AA- treatments. In conclusion, balancing the EAA profile increased milk protein yield and metabolizable protein efficiency at both levels of protein supply by increasing the mammary uptake of EAA and altering the NEAA uptake, leading to less AA available for catabolism.Copyright © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.

Manganese exposure is considered to be an environmental risk factor connected to PD and PD-like syndrome. Research into the genetic and environmental risk factors involved in disease susceptibility has recently uncovered a link existing between Park9 and manganese. It seems that manganese binding to Park9 (YPk9) protein is involved in the detoxification mechanism exerted by this protein against manganese toxicity. In this study, we used potentiometric, mono- and bi-dimensional (TOCSY, HSQC) NMR, EPR and ESI-MS measurements to analyze complex formation and metal binding sites in the peptide fragment. Presumably octahedral species, in which the Mn(II) ion was bound to oxygens of the carboxyl groups of Glu and Asp, and species where the involvement of sulfur from Cys and nitrogen from His residues, depending on the metal to ligand molar ratio, were detected for manganese coordination. Structural changes in the 30-amino acid fragment were triggered by Zn(II) interaction. A general decrease in the intensity of NMR signals was detected, suggesting the occurrence of chemical exchange among some coordinated species in an intermediate NMR timescale. The coordination may involve both S and N donor atoms from cysteine as well as histidine residues, together with O donor atoms from glutamic and aspartic residues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28571990>Optimal ratios of essential amino acids stimulate β-casein synthesis via activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway in MAC-T cells and bovine mammary tissue explants.</a></h2><p>Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and serve as key molecular components upstream of the signaling pathways that regulate protein synthesis. The objective of this study was to systematically investigate the effect of essential AA ratios on milk protein synthesis in vitro and to elucidate some of the underlying mechanisms. Triplicate cultures of MAC-T cells and bovine mammary tissue explants (MTE) were incubated with the optimal AA ratio (OPAA; :Met, 2.9:1; Thr:, 1.05:1; :Thr, 1.8:1; :His, 2.38:1; and :, 1.23:1) in the presence of rapamycin (control), OPAA, a :Thr ratio of 2.1:1, a :Thr ratio of 1.3:1, a :His ratio of 3.05:1, or a : ratio of 1.62:1 for 12 h; the other AA concentrations were equal to OPAA. In some experiments, the cells were cultured with OPAA with or without rapamycin (100 ng/mL) or with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) small interference RNA, and the MTE were exposed to OPAA with rapamycin for β-casein expression. Among the treatments, the expression of β-casein was greatest in the MTE cultured with OPAA. In MAC-T cells, the OPAA upregulated the mRNA expression of SLC1A5 and SLC7A5 but downregulated the expression of IRS1, AKT3, EEF1A1, and EEF2 compared with the control. The OPAA had no effect on the mTOR phosphorylation status but increased the phosphorylation of S6K1 and RPS6. When the MTE were treated with rapamycin in the presence of OPAA, the expression of β-casein was markedly decreased. The phosphorylation of RPS6 and 4EBP1 also was reduced in MAC-T cells. A similar negative effect on the expression of RPS6KB1 and EIF4EBP1 was detected when the cells were cultured with either rapamycin or mTOR small interference RNA. The optimal AA ratio stimulated β-casein expression partly by enhancing the transport of AA into the cells, cross-talk with insulin signaling and a subsequent enhancement of mTOR signaling, or translation elongation in both MAC-T cells and bovine MTE.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.

A nitrogen balance (NB) trial was conducted using 198 adult roosters, housed individually in metabolic cages. The treatments were 33 purified diets being 11 diets with an amino acid mixture providing high protein intake of 500 mg N/BWkg (0.75) per day, 11 diets providing medium protein intake of 250 mg N/BWkg (0.75) per day (in each diet, one amino acid tested was diluted 50%) and 11 diets providing low protein intake of 125 mg N/BWkg (0.75) per day (made by omitting the amino acid tested). Each treatment had six replicates. After 48 h of fasting receiving water plus sucrose, the roosters were fed 40 g of the diets by tube once a day for 3 days. The excreta were collected within 72 h after the first feeding. The diets and excreta were analysed for nitrogen content. For each amino acid studied, a linear regression was fitted by NB and amino acid intake (AAI). The maintenance requirements were estimated as the AAI to maintain the NB equal to zero. The daily amino acid requirements for maintenance were estimated to be  11, Met 29, Thr 23, Trp 5, Arg 50,  29, His 6, Gly 54,  49, Leu 78 and Ile 21 mg/BWkg (0.75) per day. Therefore, the amino acid ratio for maintenance was concluded to be  100, Met 276, Thr 220, Trp 48, Arg 467,  275, His 60, Gly 511,  467, Leu 735 and Ile 198% independent of the scale. The essential amino acid profile and the ideal ratio for the maintenance of poultry estimated in this study contributed to improve the factorial model for estimating essential amino acid requirements for poultry.Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition © 2015 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27143767>Influence of dietary amino acid reductions and Eimeria acervulina infection on growth performance and intestinal cytokine responses of broilers fed low crude protein diets.</a></h2><p>Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the influence of Eimeria acervulina infection on growth performance, plasma carotenoids, and intestinal cytokine responses of broilers fed low crude protein (LCP) diets with reduced concentrations of selected amino acids (AA). Experiment 1 was conducted to validate a dietary formulation approach in which broilers were fed 1 of 5 diets including a 19.0% CP corn-soybean meal based (CSBM) diet, a LCP control diet (16.7% CP) that matched the AA profile of the CSBM diet, and 3 LCP diets with 30% reductions in standardized ileal digestible concentrations of TSAA, , or Thr from 14 to 23 d post-hatch. Body weight gain and G:F were greatest (P < 0.05) and similar for broilers fed the CSBM and LCP control diets, whereas reductions in Thr, TSAA, and  each decreased (P < 0.05) G:F of broilers. In Experiment 2, birds were allotted to 18 treatment groups in a factorial arrangement of 9 dietary treatments × 2 infection states. Dietary treatments included a LCP control diet similar to that fed in Experiment 1 and 8 LCP diets with 40% individual reductions in TSAA, , Thr, , Ile, Arg,  + Tyr, or Gly + Ser. Broilers received experimental diets from 10 d to 28 d post-hatch and were inoculated with 0 or 4.0 × 10 sporulated E. acervulina oocysts at 15 d. Decreased (P < 0.05) growth performance (10 to 28 d) of broilers was observed with each AA reduction, except  + Tyr, compared with birds fed the LCP control diet.

Although the analogs exhibited weak affinity for the urotensin II receptor (UT) without agonistic activity, azasulfuryl-UII((4-11)) derivatives 7-9 reduced up to 50% of the effects of UII and urotensin II-related peptide (URP) without affecting their potency.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29682906>Profiles of Streptococcus thermophilus MN-ZLW-002 nutrient requirements in controlled pH batch fermentations.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to evaluate the profiles of Streptococcus thermophilus nutrient requirements to guide the design of media for high cell density culturing. The growth kinetics, physiological state, and nutrient requirement profiles of S. thermophilus were analyzed in chemically defined media. The results showed that the intracellular ATP concentration, H -ATPase activity, NADH/NAD , and NH concentrations varied with intracellular pH. The nutrient components with the highest amounts required were Leu and Asp; ascorbic acid and p-amino benzoic acid; K and PO  ; and guanine and uracil. The nutrient components with the largest required ratios were Arg, His, and Met; folic acid, cyanocobalamine, biotin, and nicotinic acid; Ca and Mg ; and guanine and uracil. In this study, different nutrient components were primarily used at different phase. Trp, Tyr, calcium pantothenate, thiamine, guanine, and Mg were mainly used from late-lag to midexponential phase. Met, Pro, , Ala, Gly, nicotinic acid, and riboflavin were mainly used from midexponential to late-exponential phase. The highest bioavailabilities of nutrient components were also found at diverse phase. Met, Leu, Ile, Asn, Glu, , Pro, Gly, riboflavin, nicotinic acid, adenine, uracil, inosine, and Ca had the highest bioavailability from late-lag to midexponential phase.

A third cyclo[DKP-RGD]-PTX conjugate with a nonpeptide "uncleavable" linker (8) was also synthesized to be tested as a negative control. These three SMDCs were able to inhibit biotinylated vitronectin binding to the purified αVβ3-integrin receptor at nanomolar concentrations and showed good stability at pH 7.4 and pH 5.5. Cleavage of the two peptide linkers was observed in the presence of lysosomal enzymes, whereas conjugate 8, which possesses a nonpeptide "uncleavable" linker, remained intact under these conditions. The antiproliferative activities of the conjugates were evaluated against two isogenic cell lines expressing the integrin receptor at different levels: the acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line CCRF-CEM (αVβ3-) and its subclone CCRF-CEM αVβ3 (αVβ3+). Fairly effective integrin targeting was displayed by the cyclo[DKP-RGD]--Ala-PTX conjugate (6), which was found to differentially inhibit proliferation in antigen-positive CCRF-CEM αVβ3 versus antigen-negative isogenic CCRF-CEM cells. The total lack of activity displayed by the "uncleavable" cyclo[DKP-RGD]-PTX conjugate (8) clearly demonstrates the importance of the peptide linker for achieving the selective release of the cytotoxic payload.© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

A total of 84 male Ross 308 broiler chicks (Experiment 1) or 84 male BUT 10 turkey poults (Experiment 2) were offered a nutrient-adequate diet from d 1 to 23. On d 23, birds in each experiment were allocated to 4 treatments consisting of a nitrogen-free diet (NFD) (with or without protease) and an assay diet containing wheat-DDGS as the only source of amino acids (with or without protease) in a randomised complete block design. In Experiments 1 and 2, the coefficient of AIAAD or SIAAD of  and Asp were low irrespective of protease. In Experiment 1, the coefficient of AIAAD ranged from 0.35 (Ala) to 0.75 (Pro) without protease, whereas the range was 0.42 (Thr) to 0.82 (Pro) with protease. Protease improved the coefficient of AIAAD for Arg and Pro and tended to improve the coefficient of AIAAD for Met. Without protease, the coefficient of SIAAD ranged from 0.51 (Ala) to 0.84 (Pro), whereas the range was from 0.65 (Ala) to 0.93 (Pro) with protease. Protease improved the coefficient of SIAAD of Arg, Leu, , Met,  and Pro. In Experiment 2, the coefficient of AIAAD was lower than 0.50 for all amino acids except for Glu (0.70) and Pro (0.81) without protease. On the other hand, the coefficient of SIAAD ranged from 0.41 (Thr) to 0.89 (Pro) without protease, whereas the range was from 0.56 (Arg) to 0.88 (Pro) with protease supplementation. With the exception of Cys and Pro, protease improved the coefficient of AIAAD and SIAAD of all other amino acids by 0.05-0.19. It was concluded that the AIAAD and SIAAD of wheat-DDGS are variable and are generally greater in broilers compared to turkeys at 28 d of age. Protease improved the ileal digestibility of a large number of amino acids in wheat-DDGS for broilers and turkeys.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26593415>Regulation of the Melanocortin-Sensitive Adenylate Cyclase System by N-Acylated Peptide 71-82 of Type 4 Melanocortin Receptor.</a></h2><p>The peptides structurally corresponding in to cytoplasmic loops of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) are able to control functional activity of homologous receptors and the corresponding signaling pathways. Modification of these peptides with hydrophobic radicals enhances their biological activity due to penetration of lipophilic derivatives through the membrane and anchoring near their targets, GPCR. We synthesized an N-palmitoylated peptide Palm--[-Asn--Asn-Leu-His-Ser-Pro-(Nle)-Tyr--Phe71-82]-amide-Palm--(71-82) structurally corresponding to cytoplasmic loop 1 of melanocortin 4 receptor (M4R). We found that in micromolar concentrations it very effectively suppresses stimulation of basal adenylate cyclase activity and basal level of GppNHp binding of heterotrimeric G proteins produced by THIQ and α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH), agonists of M4R homologous to the peptide, in synaptosomal membranes of rat brain. The peptide Palm--(71-82) also reduced, albeit to a significantly less extent, stimulation of adenylate cyclase and G-proteins by M3R agonist of γ-MSH, due to high homology of the peptide primary structure to M3R cytoplasmic loop 1. The synthesized peptide with activity of M4R/M3R antagonist can be used for the development of regulators of M4R and M3R and the corresponding biochemical and physiological processes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155652>Effects of increased energy and amino acid intake in late gestation on reproductive performance, milk composition, metabolic, and redox status of sows1.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to determine the effects of increased AA and energy intake during late gestation on reproductive performance, milk composition, and metabolic and redox status of sows. A total of 118 Yorkshire sows (third through sixth parity) were randomly assigned to dietary treatments from day 90 of gestation until farrowing. Dietary treatments consisted of combinations of 2 standardized ileal digestible (SID) AA levels [14.7 or 20.6 g/d SID , SID  and other AA met or exceeded the NRC (2012) recommendations] and 2 energy levels (28.24 or 33.78 MJ/d intake of NE) in a 2 × 2 factorial design. After parturition, all sows were fed a standard lactation diet. Blood samples were collected and analyzed for parameters on , redox status, and amino acid profile. The data were analyzed using the generalized linear mixed models to reveal the impact of dietary levels of energy, AA, and their interaction. Sows with increased intake of AA had greater BW gain (P < 0.01) during late gestation. Furthermore, the BW loss during lactation was increased in sows with increasing intake of energy (P < 0.05) or AA (P < 0.05). Sows fed high energy had higher total litter birth weights (20.2 kg vs. 18.4 kg, P < 0.05) and shorter duration of farrowing (261 min vs. 215 min, P < 0.05), compared with those fed low energy, which likely was due to higher (P < 0.05) plasma glucose and lower (P < 0.05) plasma lactate prior to parturition. High AA intake in late gestation increased the ADG of piglets during the following lactation (P < 0.05), and increased the concentrations of plasma urea, and the following AA: , Met, Thr, , Ile, Leu, , Asp, Ser, and Arg at farrowing (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the increased intake of energy increased total litter weight of newborns and shortened the farrowing duration, which likely was due to improved energy status at farrowing. Furthermore, sows with increased intake of AA led to higher growth rate of piglets during the following lactation, accompanying with the increasing levels of plasma urea and amino acids. Therefore, the higher energy intake in late gestation appeared to improve litter weight and farrowing duration, while higher AA intake may have positive effect on piglets performance in lactation.© The Author(s) 2019.

The study was to evaluate effects of AKG on Gln  in vivo and in vitro. A total of twenty-one piglets were weaned at 28 days with a mean body weight (BW) of 6.0 ± 0.2 kg, and randomly divided into 3 groups: corn soybean meal based diet (CON group); the basal diet with 1% alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG treatment group); and the basal diet with 1% L-glutamine (GLN treatment group). Intestinal porcine epithelial cells-1 (IPEC-1) were incubated to investigate effects of 0.5, 2, and 3 mM AKG addition on Gln . Our results showed that there were no differences (P > 0.05) among the 3 treatments in initial BW, final BW, and average daily feed intake. However, average daily gain (P = 0.013) and gain:feed (P = 0.041) of the AKG group were greater than those of the other two groups. In comparison with the CON group, the AKG and GLN groups exhibited an improvement in villus length, mucosal thickness, and crypt depth in the jejunum of piglets. Serum concentrations of Asp, Glu, , Ile, Tyr, , , and Arg in the piglets fed the 1% AKG or Gln diet were lower than those in the CON group. Compared with the CON group, the mRNA expression of jejunal and ileal amino acid (AA) transporters in the AKG and GLN groups were significantly increased (P < 0.05). Additionally, the in vitro study showed that the addition of 0.5, 2, and 3 mM AKG dose-dependently decreased (P < 0.05) the net utilization of Gln and formulation of ammonia, Glu, Ala, and Asp by IPEC-1. In conclusion, dietary AKG supplementation, as a replacement for Gln, could improve Gln  in piglet enterocytes and enhance the utilization of AA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30428413>A deuterohemin peptide protects a transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans model of Alzheimer's disease by inhibiting Aβ aggregation.</a></h2><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative brain disease and is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. The main hallmark of AD is the deposition of insoluble amyloid (Aβ) outside the neuron, leading to amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Deuterohemin-Ala-His-Thr--Glu- (DhHP-6), a novel porphyrin-peptide, has both microperoxidase activity and cell permeability. In the present study, DhHP-6 efficiently inhibited the aggregation of Aβ and reduced the β-sheet percentage of Aβ from 89.1% to 78.3%. DhHP-6 has a stronger affinity (K = 100 ± 12 μM) for binding with Aβ at , Arg, , Glu and Glu. In addition, DhHP-6 (100 μM) significantly prolonged lifespan, alleviated paralysis and reduced Aβ plaque formation in the Aβ transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans CL4176 model of AD. Our results demonstrate that DhHP-6 is a potential drug candidate that efficiently protects a transgenic C. elegans model of Alzheimer's disease by inhibiting Aβ aggregation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The 4 processed soybean products included 2 sources of enzyme-treated soybean meal (ESBM-1 and ESBM-2), extruded soybean meal, and soy protein concentrate (SPC). Twenty-seven weanling barrows (9.29 ± 0.58 kg initial BW) were surgically equipped with a T-cannula in the distal ileum. Pigs were randomly allotted to three 9 × 5 Youden squares with 9 pigs and five 7-d periods in each square. Seven cornstarch-based diets were prepared using each of the protein sources as the sole source of CP and AA. A N-free diet was prepared to calculate basal endogenous losses of CP and AA, and this diet was fed to 2 groups of pigs, which resulted in a total of 9 dietary treatments. Results indicate that the SID of CP was greater ( < 0.05) in ESBM-1 than in SPC, RSE, or FCM. The SID of Arg, His, Ile, Leu, Met, and  were greater ( < 0.05) in ESBM-1 than in SPC, and the SID of  was greater ( < 0.05) in SBM-CV than in ESBM-2. The SID of Thr, Trp, , and total indispensable AA were not different among the soybean products, but the SID of total dispensable AA in ESBM-1 was greater ( < 0.05) than in SPC. Therefore, the SID of total AA was greater ( < 0.05) in ESBM-1 than in SPC, but no other differences were observed among soybean meal (SBM) products. The SID of most AA in RSE and the SID of all AA in FCM were less ( < 0.05) than in all the SBM products, but the SID of all AA in RSE were greater ( < 0.05) than in FCM. Results of this research indicate that although processing of SBM results in increased concentration of CP, processing may also reduce the digestibility of AA, which is likely due to heat damage during processing. There are, however, differences among processed soy products, with some products having greater SID of AA than others. Results also indicate that fermentation of a mixture of rapeseed meal, wheat, and relatively low quality coproducts does not result in SID values that are similar to those of unfermented 00-rapeseed expellers or soybean products.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29348627>Chikungunya virus nsP1 interacts directly with nsP2 and modulates its ATPase activity.</a></h2><p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus, which has created an alarming threat in the world due to unavailability of vaccine and antiviral compounds. The CHIKV nsP2 contains ATPase, RTPase, helicase and protease activities, whereas, nsP1 is a viral capping enzyme. In alphaviruses, the four non-structural proteins form the replication complex in the cytoplasm and this study characterizes the interaction between CHIKV nsP1 and nsP2. It was observed that, both the proteins co-localize in the cytoplasm and interact in the CHIKV infected cells by confocal microscopy and immunoprecipitation assay. Further, it was demonstrated through mutational analysis that, the amino acids 1-95 of nsP2 and 170-288 of nsP1 are responsible for their direct interaction. Additionally, it was noticed that, the ATPase activity of nsP2 is enhanced in the presence of nsP1, indicating the functional significance of this interaction. In silico analysis showed close (≤1.7 Å) polar interaction (hydrogen bond) between Glu, Arg of nsP2 with ,  and  of nsP1 respectively.

Eight mid-lactation Holstein cows were randomly assigned to 5-day continuous jugular infusions of saline (CTL), EAA mixture prepared on the profile of casein and supplied (in % of lysine ()) 100% of , 33.3% of methionine (Met), 110.2% of Leu, 43.6% of Arg, 50.8% of threonine (Thr), 81.6% of valine (), 69.7% of isoleucine (Ile), 61.4% of phenylalanine () and 34.2% of histidine (His) (Casein, 160 g/d), EAA mixture excluding Leu (-Leu, 163 g/d) or EAA mixture excluding Arg (-Arg, 158 g/d) in a duplicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with four infusion periods separated by 7-day interval period. The basal diet supplied 1.6 Mcal NE and 94.4 g MP per 1 kg DM to meet requirements for lactation. The Casein treatment provided a balanced supply (in % of MP) of 10.3% Leu and 5.3% Arg, whereas in the two subsequent -Leu and -Arg treatments, the concentration of Leu and Arg was reduced to 8.4 and 4.6% respectively. Dry matter intake (15.4 kg/day) was not affected by treatments. The Casein treatment increased milk yield (14.9%, p < 0.001), milk protein yield (120 g, p < 0.001) and milk protein efficiency (0.03, p = 0.099) than CTL treatment. However, the -Leu treatment decreased the responses of above-measured parameters by 6.25%, 70 g, 0.05 (p < 0.06) (compared with Casein). These effects of Leu were related to decreased Leu concentration and improved concentration of Ile and  in plasma. The -Arg treatment decreased the plasma Arg concentration than the Casein treatment, whereby resulted in the decrease of milk yield (5.7%, p = 0.073), milk protein yield (60 g, p = 0.011) and milk protein efficiency (0.04, p = 0.037). In conclusion, supply of EAA profile of casein can increase the lactation production in dairy cows, and 8.6% of Leu in MP partly limits the milk protein response when the requirements of , Met and His were met. The level of Arg at 4.6% MP is not deemed to an ideal profile, as evidenced by decreased milk protein efficiency.Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28380606>Amino acid digestibility in soybean meal sourced from different regions of the United States and fed to pigs.</a></h2><p>An experiment was conducted to determine the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) by growing pigs of AA in soybean meal (SBM) produced in different regions of the United States. Twenty-two growing barrows (25.5 ± 1.73 kg) were fitted with a T-cannula near the distal ileum and allotted to a 22 × 8 Youden square design. Twenty-two sources of SBM were procured from soybean crushing plants located throughout the United States. For analysis, the crushing plant locations were separated into the following 3 zones: 1) Michigan, Minnesota, and South Dakota ( = 4); 2) Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio ( = 11); and 3) Iowa, Missouri, and Nebraska ( = 7). Dietary treatments included 22 diets based on a mixture of cornstarch, sucrose, and each source of SBM as the sole source of CP. Results indicated that the concentration of most indispensable and dispensable AA in SBM were not different among zones. However, SBM from zone 2 had a greater ( < 0.05) concentration of Thr than SBM from zone 3 and a greater ( < 0.05) concentration of Gly than SBM from zone 1. The concentration of Tyr in SBM from zone 2 was also greater ( < 0.05) than in SBM from zones 1 and 3. However, if concentrations of AA were calculated as a percent of CP, there were no differences in the concentrations of indispensable and dispensable AA among SBM from the 3 zones. Likewise, the AID of CP and the AID of indispensable and dispensable AA were not different among SBM from the 3 zones. The SID of CP and most AA was also not different among SBM from the 3 zones. However, SBM from zone 3 had a greater ( < 0.05) SID of His, Asp, and Cys than SBM from zone 2, and SBM from zone 1 had a greater ( < 0.05) SID of  than SBM from zone 2. There was also a tendency ( < 0.10) for SBM from zone 3 to have a greater SID of Ile, Leu, , , Ala, and Tyr than SBM from zone 2. If the concentrations of SID CP and AA were calculated as grams per kilogram, SBM among the 3 zones were not different with the exception that there was a tendency ( = 0.07) for SBM from zone 2 to contain more SID Thr and SID Tyr than SBM from zone 3. In conclusion, only a few differences in concentrations and digestibility of CP and AA exist among sources of SBM from different zones in the United States. These observations indicate that the protein value is not different among SBM produced in the United States regardless of the location of the crushing plants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26319766>Abomasal amino acid infusion in postpartum dairy cows: Effect on whole-body, splanchnic, and mammary amino acid .</a></h2><p>Nine Holstein cows with rumen cannulas and indwelling catheters in splanchnic blood vessels were used in a generalized randomized incomplete block design with repeated measures to study the effect of increased early postpartum AA supply on splanchnic and mammary AA . At calving, cows were blocked according to parity (second and third or greater) and allocated to 2 treatments: abomasal infusion of water (CTRL; n=4) or free AA with casein profile (AA-CN; n=5) in addition to a basal diet. The AA-CN infusion started with half of the maximal dose at the calving day (1 d in milk; DIM) and then steadily decreased from 791 to 226 g/d until 29 DIM. On 5, 15, and 29 DIM, 6 sample sets of arterial, portal, hepatic, and mammary blood were taken at 45-min intervals. Over the whole period, increasing AA supply increased milk (+7.8 ± 1.3 kg/d) and milk protein yields (+220 ± 65 g/d) substantially. The increased milk yield was not supported by greater dry matter intake (DMI) as, overall, DMI decreased with AA-CN (-1.6 ± 0.6 kg/d). Arterial concentrations of essential AA were greater for AA-CN compared with CTRL. The net portal-drained viscera (PDV) release of His, Met, and  was greater for AA-CN compared with CTRL, and the net PDV recovery of these infused AA ranged from 72 to 102% once changes in DMI were accounted for. The hepatic removal of these AA was increased equivalently to the increased net PDV release, resulting in an unaltered net splanchnic release. The net PDV release of Ile, Leu, , and  tended to be greater for AA-CN, and the net PDV recovery of these infused AA ranged from 69 to 73%, indicating increased PDV  with AA-CN. The fractional hepatic removal of these AA did not differ from zero and was unaffected by the increased supply. Consequently, the splanchnic release of these AA was approximately equivalent to their net PDV release for both CTRL and AA-CN. Overall, greater early postpartum AA supply increased milk and milk protein yields substantially based on increased mammary AA uptake. The PDV  of branched-chain AA and  were increased, whereas it seemed to be unaffected for other essential AA when the intestinal AA supply was increased. On a net basis, the liver removed more group 1 AA (His, Met, , and Trp) for anabolism and catabolism when the early postpartum AA supply was increased. Thus, increasing the postpartum AA supply increased splanchnic and mammary consumption of AA; hence, the protein deficiency persisted.Copyright © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.

In Experiment 1, 18 growing pigs (average initial BW = 36.5 kg) were assigned randomly into one of three treatments (n = 6/treatment group) representing normal (18 % CP), low (15 % CP), and very low (12 % CP) protein intake. In Experiment 2, 18 finishing pigs (average initial BW = 62.3 kg) were allotted randomly into one of three treatments (n = 6/treatment group), representing normal (16 % CP), low (13 % CP) and very low (10 % CP) protein intake. In both experiments, diets with low and very low CP were supplemented with crystalline amino acids to achieve equal content of standardized ileal digestible , Met, Thr, and Trp, and were provided to pigs ad libitum. Daily feed intake, BW, and feed/gain ratios were determined. At the end of each experiment, all pigs were slaughtered to collect pancreas, small-intestine samples, and terminal ileal chymes. Samples were used for determining expression of genes for digestive enzymes and ileal amino acid digestibilities. Growing pigs fed the 12 % CP and 15 % CP diets had lower final body weight (P < 0.01) and ADG (P < 0.0001) when compared with pigs fed the 18 % dietary CP diet. Growing pigs fed with the 12 % CP diet showed higher digestibilities for CP (P < 0.05), DM (P < 0.05),  (P < 0.0001), Met (P < 0.01), Cys (P < 0.01), Thr (P < 0.01), Trp (P < 0.05),  (P < 0.05),  (P < 0.05), Ala (P < 0.05), Cys (P < 0.01), and Gly (P < 0.05) than those fed the 18 % CP diet. Finishing pigs fed the 16 % CP diet had a higher (P < 0.01) final body weight than those fed the 10 % CP diet. mRNA levels for digestive enzymes (trypsinogen, chymotrypsin B, and dipeptidases-II and III) differed among the three groups of pigs (P < 0.05), and no difference was noted in the genes expression between control group and lower CP group. These results indicated that a reduction of dietary CP by a six-percentage value limited the growth performance of growing-finishing pigs and that a low-protein diet supplemented with deficient amino acids could reduce the excretion of nitrogen into the environment without affecting weight gain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26643502>Radiopharmacological characterization of ⁶⁴Cu-labeled α-MSH analogs for potential use in imaging of malignant melanoma.</a></h2><p>The melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) plays an important role in melanoma growth, angiogenesis and metastasis, and is overexpressed in melanoma cells. α-Melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) and derivatives are known to bind with high affinity at this receptor that provides the potential for selective targeting of melanoma. In this study, one linear α-MSH-derived peptide Nle-Asp-His-D--Arg-Trp-Gly-NH2 (NAP-NS1) without linker and with εAhx-β-Ala linker, and a cyclic α-MSH derivative, [-Glu-His-D--Arg-Trp-Glu]-Arg-Pro--NH2 (NAP-NS2) with εAhx-β-Ala linker were conjugated with p-SCN-Bn-NOTA and labeled with (64)Cu. Radiochemical and radiopharmacological investigations were performed with regard to transchelation, stability, lipophilicity and in vitro binding assays as well as biodistribution in healthy rats. No transchelation reactions, but high metabolic stability and water solubility were demonstrated. The linear derivatives showed higher affinity than the cyclic one. [(64)Cu]Cu-NOTA-εAhx-β-Ala-NAP-NS1 ([(64)Cu]Cu-2) displayed rapid cellular association and dissociation in murine B16F10 cell homogenate. All [(64)Cu]Cu-labeled conjugates exhibited affinities in the low nanomolar range in B16F10. [(64)Cu]Cu-2 showed also high affinity in human MeWo and TXM13 cell homogenate. In vivo studies suggested that [(64)Cu]Cu-2 was stable, with about 85 % of intact peptide in rat plasma at 2 h p.i. Biodistribution confirmed the renal pathway as the major elimination route. The uptake of [(64)Cu]Cu-2 in the kidney was 5.9 % ID/g at 5 min p.i. and decreased to 2.0 % ID/g at 60 min p.i. Due to the prospective radiochemical and radiopharmacological properties of the linear α-MSH derivative [(64)Cu]Cu-2, this conjugate is a promising candidate for tracer development in human melanoma imaging.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27121753>Dietary levels of protein and free amino acids affect pancreatic proteases activities, amino acids transporters expression and serum amino acid concentrations in starter pigs.</a></h2><p>The dietary contents of crude protein and free amino acids (AA) may affect the protein digestion and AA absorption in pigs. Trypsin and chymotrypsin activities, AA serum concentrations and expression of AA transporters in the small intestine of pigs fed a low protein, AA-supplemented (19.2%, LPAA) or a high protein (28.1%, HP), wheat-soybean meal diet were measured in two 14-d trials. The LPAA diet contained free L-, L-Thr, DL-Met, L-Leu, L-Ile, L-, L-His, L-Trp and L-. All pigs were fed the same amount of feed (890 and 800 g/d for trial 1 and 2 respectively). In trial 1, samples of mucosa (duodenum, jejunum and ileum) and digesta (duodenum and jejunum) were collected from 14 pigs (17.2 ± 0.4 kg); in trial 2, blood samples were collected from 12 pigs (12.7 ± 0.3 kg). The trypsin and chymotrypsin activities in both intestinal segments were higher in pigs fed the HP diet (p < 0.01). Trypsin activity was higher in jejunum than in duodenum regardless the dietary treatment (p < 0.05). Pigs fed the LPAA diet expressed more b AT in duodenum, B AT1 in ileum (p < 0.05), and tended to express more y LAT1 in duodenum (p = 0.10). In pigs fed the LPAA diet, the expression of b AT was higher in duodenum than in jejunum and ileum (p < 0.01), but no difference was observed in pigs fed the HP diet. Ileum had the lowest b AT expression regardless the diet. The serum concentrations of , Thr and Met were higher in LPAA pigs while serum Arg was higher in HP pigs (p < 0.05). Serum concentrations of AA appear to reflect the AA absorption. In conclusion, these data indicate that the dietary protein contents affect the extent of protein digestion and that supplemental free AA may influence the intestinal site of AA release and absorption, which may impact their availability for growth of young pigs.Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26987951>Molecular mechanisms of protein-cholesterol interactions in plasma membranes: Functional distinction between topological (tilted) and consensus (CARC/CRAC) domains.</a></h2><p>The molecular mechanisms that control the multiple possible modes of protein association with membrane cholesterol are remarkably convergent. These mechanisms, which include hydrogen bonding, CH-π stacking and dispersion forces, are used by a wide variety of extracellular proteins (e.g. microbial or amyloid) and membrane receptors. Virus fusion peptides penetrate the membrane of host cells with a tilted orientation that is compatible with a transient interaction with cholesterol; this tilted orientation is also characteristic of the process of insertion of amyloid proteins that subsequently form oligomeric pores in the plasma membrane of brain cells. Membrane receptors that are associated with cholesterol generally display linear consensus binding motifs (CARC and CRAC) characterized by a triad of basic (/Arg), aromatic (Tyr/) and aliphatic (Leu/) amino acid residues. In some cases, the presence of both CARC and CRAC within the same membrane-spanning domain allows the simultaneous binding of two cholesterol molecules, one in each membrane leaflet. In this review the molecular basis and the functional significance of the different modes of protein-cholesterol interactions in plasma membranes are discussed.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The structure of PCNA from Leishmania donovani (LdPCNA) has been determined at 2.73Å resolution. Structure consists of six crystallographically independent molecules which form two trimeric rings. The pore diameter of the individual trimeric ring is of the order of 37Å. The two rings are stacked through their front to front faces. In order to gain a stable packing, the rings are rotated by 42° about the pore axis and shifted by 7Å and tilted by 16° along the perpendicular direction to pore axis. This form of stacking reduced the effective diameter of the pore to 32Å. The sequence of LdPCNA consists of a long segment of 41 amino acid residues (186-Gly--Ser-Asp-Arg-Ser-Thr--Ser-Glu---Ala-Glu---Ala-Glu-Ala-Arg-Asp-Asp-Asp-Glu-Glu-Pro-Leu-Ser-Arg--Tyr-Gly--Ala-Asp-Ser-Ser-Ala-Asn-Ala-Ile-226) whereas the corresponding segments in other PCNAs contain only eight residues corresponding to 186-Gly--Ser-Asp-Arg------224-Asn-Ala-Ile-226. The enhanced length of this segment in LdPCNA may influence its mode of interaction with DNA and other proteins.

Regulation of protein synthesis via AA occurs at least in part by alterations in the phosphorylation status of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway proteins. Although the ideal profile of :Met to promote milk protein synthesis during established lactation in dairy cows has been proposed to be 3:1, aside from being the most-limiting AA for milk protein synthesis, the role of Met in other key biologic pathways such as methylation is not well characterized in the bovine. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of increasing supplemental Met, based on the ideal 3:1 ratio of  to Met, on intracellular  related to protein synthesis and mTOR pathway phosphorylation status. MAC-T cells, an immortalized bovine mammary epithelial cell line, were incubated (n = 5 replicates/treatment) for 12 h with 3 incremental doses of Met while holding  concentration constant to achieve the following: :Met 2.9:1 (ideal AA ratio; IPAA), :Met 2.5:1 (LM2.5), and :Met 2.0:1 (LM2.0). The ratios of Thr: (1.05:1), :Thr (1.8:1), :His (2.38:1), and : (1.23:1) were the same across the 3 treatments. Applying gas chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomics revealed distinct clusters of differentially concentrated metabolites in response to :Met. Lower , branched-chain AA, and putrescine concentrations were observed with LM2.5 compared with IPAA. Apart from greater intracellular Met concentrations, further elevations in Met level (LM2.0) led to greater intracellular concentrations of nonessential AA (Pro, Glu, Gln, and Gly) compared with IPAA and greater essential AA (EAA; Met, Ile, and Leu) and nonessential AA (Pro, Gly, Ala, Gln, and Glu) compared with LM2.5. However, compared with IPAA, mRNA expression of β-casein and AA transporters (SLC7A5, SLC36A1, SLC38A2, SLC38A9, and SLC43A1) and mTOR phosphorylation were lower in response to LM2.5 and LM2.0. Overall, the results of this study provide evidence that increasing Met while  and the ratios of , Thr, His, and  relative to  were held constant could increase the concentration and utilization of intracellular EAA, in particular branched-chain AA, potentially through improving the activity of AA transporters partly controlled by mTOR signaling. Because EAA likely are metabolized by other tissues upon absorption, a question for future in vivo studies is whether formulating diets for optimal ratios of EAA in the metabolizable protein is sufficient to provide the desired levels of these AA to the mammary cells.The Authors.

Adding extra protein-bound or free AA to the diet may correct the reduced AA intake of HS pigs. However, extra protein-bound AA may further increase the body heat load, whereas extra free AA does not affect the heat load of HS pigs. Two experiments were conducted. In Exp. 1, the performance depression because of HS, compared with thermal neutrality, was determined with 30 pigs (31.1 ± 1.2 kg BW) fed diets with AA only as protein or as a mix of protein and free AA. Heat stress pigs consumed 18 to 25% less  and Thr than thermal neutral. In Exp. 2, the effect of extra dietary protein-bound or free AA on performance and serum concentration of AA in 25 HS pigs (33.6 ± 0.65 kg BW) was evaluated. Treatments were as follows: CON, wheat-soybean meal-free -Thr-Met diet; xP diet, 26% more protein than the CON diet; xAA diet, 24% or more of each AA than the recommended level. Pigs were fed ad libitum. Blood samples were collected between 1600 and 1700 h, when pigs were exposed to the highest ambient temperature (around 41.3 °C). Body temperature ranged daily from 39.9 to 41.1 °C. The performance data were reported already. Pigs fed the xP diet consumed more of all indispensable AA and dispensable AA than the CON pigs (P < 0.05), and more Arg, Ile, Asp, Glu, Gly, and Ser (P < 0.05) than the xAA pigs. Except for Arg, xAA pigs consumed more indispensable AA than the CON pigs (P < 0.05). Serum Arg, His, , , Thr, Trp, and , was higher (P < 0.05) in xP than in CON pigs. Except for Ile serum, indispensable AA were higher in xAA than in CON pigs (P < 0.05). Serum Ile, Leu, Thr, and  were higher (P < 0.05), and Met tended to be higher (P < 0.10) in xAA than in xP pigs. The difference of Ile, Leu, Met, Thr, and  between the CON and the xAA pigs was larger than that between the CON and the xP pigs (P < 0.05). Serum Asn and Tyr were higher, and Cys and Glu were lower (P < 0.05) in xP than in CON pigs. Serum Cys tended to be lower in xAA than in CON pigs (P < 0.10). Asp and Glu were higher (P < 0.05) in xAA pigs than in xP pigs. In conclusion, these serum AA results combined with the reported performance data indicate that extra free AA in diets for HS pigs may help to correct the reduced AA availability and performance of HS pigs, although higher levels of specific AA such as Ile and Met might be needed.© The Author(s) 2019.

This study evaluated effects of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and BCAA supplementation on blood metabolites and N balance of 20 ruminally-cannulated steers (177 ± 4.2 kg BW). The experiment was a randomized block design, with 14-d adaptation to  stalls and diet (DM fed = 1.5% BW) and 6-d collection. Treatments were a 2 × 2 factorial of LPS (0 vs. 1.0 to 1.5 μg/kg BW; -LPS vs. +LPS) and BCAA (0 vs. 35 g/d; -BCAA vs. +BCAA). The LPS in 100 mL sterile saline was infused (1 mL/min via i.v. catheter) on day 15. The BCAA in an essential AA solution were abomasally infused (900 mL/d) three times daily in equal portions beginning on day 7. Blood, rumen fluid, and rectal temperature were collected on day 15 at h 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 after LPS infusion. Feces and urine were collected from day 16 to 20. Rectal temperatures were greater for +LPS vs. -LPS steers at 4 h and lower at 8 h after LPS infusion (LPS × h, P < 0.01). Serum cortisol and plasma urea N were greater for +LPS than -LPS steers at 2 (cortisol only), 4, 8, 12, and 24 h after LPS infusion (LPS × h, P < 0.01). Serum cortisol was greater for +BCAA than -BCAA steers at 12 h after LPS infusion (BCAA × h, P < 0.05). Serum glucose was greater for +LPS than -LPS steers at 2 h after LPS infusion (LPS × h, P < 0.01). Plasma Ile, Leu, and  were lower, and plasma His was greater in +LPS than -LPS steers (LPS, P < 0.05). Plasma , Met, Thr, and Trp of +LPS steers were lower than -LPS steers at 4 (Thr only), 8 ( and Trp only), 12, and 24 h after infusion (LPS × h, P < 0.05). Plasma Ile, Leu, and  were greater (BCAA, P < 0.01), and Met, His, , Thr, and Trp were lower for +BCAA than -BCAA steers at 0 and 24 h after LPS infusion (BCAA × h, P ≤ 0.05). Steers receiving +LPS had lower rumen pH at 8 h, greater total VFA at 8 h, and lower rumen NH3 at 24 h after LPS infusion compared with -LPS steers (LPS × h, P ≤ 0.04). Total tract passage rates, DM, OM, NDF, ADF, and N intake, fecal N, digested N, and retained N were lower (P < 0.05) for +LPS than -LPS steers. Total N supply (dietary plus infused) and fecal N were greater (P < 0.05) for +BCAA vs. -BCAA steers. The absence of LPS × BCAA interactions (P ≥ 0.20) for N balance indicated that post-ruminal supplementation of BCAA did not alleviate the negative effects of endotoxin on N utilization by growing steers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28380619>Effects of ileal digesta collection time on standardized ileal digestibility of amino acids in corn, soybean meal, and distiller's dried grains with solubles fed to growing pigs.</a></h2><p>The objective of this experiment was to determine the minimum collection time needed to obtain representative samples of ileal digesta from pigs fed different types of diets. Eight barrows with an initial BW of 34.6 kg (SD 2.1) were individually fitted with a T-cannula in the distal ileum and randomly allotted to a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with 4 diets and 4 periods per square. Three diets contained corn, soybean meal (SBM), or distiller's dried grains with solubles (DDGS) as the sole source of CP. An N-free diet was also prepared. All diets contained 0.5% chromic oxide as an indigestible marker. Equal meals were provided at 0800 and 2000 h. Ileal digesta samples were collected in 2-h intervals from 0800 to 2000 h during the last 3 d of each 7-d period. When pigs were fed the corn diet, the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of most indispensable AA and dispensable AA increased and then decreased (quadratic, < 0.05) during each of the six 2-h periods. The SID of most AA were less ( < 0.05) if the ileal digesta samples were collected from 1800 to 2000 h or from 1600 to 2000 h compared with the SID values from the ileal samples collected over the entire 12-h period. When pigs were fed the SBM diet, the SID of Ile, Leu, Thr, Trp, , Ala, and Cys increased and then decreased (quadratic, < 0.05) but the SID of all other AA linearly decreased ( < 0.05) during the six 2-h periods. The SID of almost all AA were greater ( < 0.05) if the ileal samples were collected from 0800 to 1000 h, from 0800 to 1200 h, from 1000 to 1400 h, or from 0800 to 1400 h but less ( < 0.05) if collected from 1600 to 1800 h, from 1800 to 2000 h, from 1600 to 2000 h, or from 1400 to 2000 h compared with the SID values from the ileal samples collected over the entire 12-h period. When pigs were fed the DDGS-based diet, the SID of Ile, Leu, , , Trp, , and Tyr increased and then decreased (quadratic, < 0.05) during the six 2-h periods. The SID of most AA were less ( < 0.05) if the ileal samples were collected from 1800 to 2000 h compared with the SID values from the ileal samples collected over the entire 12-h period. In conclusion, diurnal variations in SID of AA in pigs indicate that 6 h of ileal sample collection starting 4 or 6 h after feeding may provide representative samples of ileal digesta from pigs fed different types of diets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26659347>Pilot Comparison of ⁶⁸Ga-RM2 PET and ⁶⁸Ga-PSMA-11 PET in Patients with Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Cancer.</a></h2><p>Glu-NH-CO-NH--(Ahx)-[(68)Ga(HBED-CC)] ((68)Ga-PSMA-11) is a PET tracer that can detect prostate cancer relapses and metastases by binding to the extracellular domain of PSMA. (68)Ga-labeled DOTA-4-amino-1-carboxymethyl-piperidine-D--Gln-Trp-Ala--Gly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2 ((68)Ga-RM2) is a synthetic bombesin receptor antagonist that targets gastrin-releasing peptide receptors. We present pilot data on the biodistribution of these PET tracers in a small cohort of patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer.Seven men (mean age ± SD, 74.3 ± 5.9 y) with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer underwent both (68)Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and (68)Ga-RM2 PET/MRI scans. SUVmax and SUVmean were recorded for normal tissues and areas of uptake outside the expected physiologic biodistribution.All patients had a rising level of prostate-specific antigen (mean ± SD, 13.5 ± 11.5) and noncontributory results on conventional imaging. (68)Ga-PSMA-11 had the highest physiologic uptake in the salivary glands and small bowel, with hepatobiliary and renal clearance noted, whereas (68)Ga-RM2 had the highest physiologic uptake in the pancreas, with renal clearance noted. Uptake outside the expected physiologic biodistribution did not significantly differ between (68)Ga-PSMA-11 and (68)Ga-RM2; however, (68)Ga-PSMA-11 localized in a lymph node and seminal vesicle in a patient with no abnormal (68)Ga-RM2 uptake. Abdominal periaortic lymph nodes were more easily visualized by(68)Ga-RM2 in two patients because of lack of interference by radioactivity in the small intestine.(68)Ga-PSMA-11 and (68)Ga-RM2 had distinct biodistributions in this small cohort of patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer.

In this study, we identified a novel exopeptidase, designated acylpeptidyl oligopeptidase (AOP), composed of 759 amino acid residues with active Ser(615) and encoded by PGN_1349 in P. gingivalis ATCC 33277. AOP is currently listed as an unassigned S9 family peptidase or prolyl oligopeptidase. Recombinant AOP did not hydrolyze a Pro-Xaa bond. In addition, although sequence similarities to human and archaea-type acylaminoacyl peptidase sequences were observed, its enzymatic properties were apparently distinct from those, because AOP scarcely released an N-acyl-amino acid as compared with di- and tripeptides, especially with N-terminal modification. The kcat/Km value against benzyloxycarbonyl---Met-4-methycoumaryl-7-amide, the most potent substrate, was 123.3 ± 17.3 μm(-1) s(-1), optimal pH was 7-8.5, and the activity was decreased with increased NaCl concentrations. AOP existed predominantly in the periplasmic fraction as a monomer, whereas equilibrium between monomers and oligomers was observed with a recombinant molecule, suggesting a tendency of oligomerization mediated by the N-terminal region (Met(16)-Glu(101)). Three-dimensional modeling revealed the three domain structures (residues Met(16)-Ala(126), which has no similar homologue with known structure; residues Leu(127)-Met(495) (β-propeller domain); and residues Ala(496)-(736) (α/β-hydrolase domain)) and further indicated the hydrophobic S1 site of AOP in accord with its hydrophobic P1 preference. AOP orthologues are widely distributed in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, suggesting its importance for processing of nutritional and/or bioactive oligopeptides.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27135265>Comparative Functional Alanine Positional Scanning of the α-Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone and NDP-Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone Demonstrates Differential Structure-Activity Relationships at the Mouse Melanocortin Receptors.</a></h2><p>The melanocortin system has been implicated in the regulation of various physiological functions including melanogenesis, steroidogenesis, energy homeostasis, and feeding behavior. Five melanocortin receptors have been identified to date and belong to the family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). Post-translational modification of the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) prohormone leads to the biosynthesis of the endogenous melanocortin agonists, including α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH), β-MSH, γ-MSH, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). All the melanocortin agonists derived from the POMC prohormone contain a His--Arg-Trp tetrapeptide sequence that has been implicated in eliciting the pharmacological responses at the melanocortin receptors. Herein, an alanine (Ala) positional scan is reported for the endogenous α-MSH ligand and the synthetic, more potent, NDP-MSH peptide (Ac-Ser(1)-Tyr(2)-Ser(3)-Nle(4)-Glu(5)-His(6)-DPhe(7)-Arg(8)-Trp(9)-Gly(10)-(11)-Pro(12)-(13)-NH2) at the cloned mouse melanocortin receptors to test the assumption that the structure-activity relationships of one ligand would apply to the other. Several residues outside of the postulated pharmacophore altered potency at the melanocortin receptors, most notably the 1560-, 37-, and 15-fold potency loss when the Glu(5) position of α-MSH was substituted with Ala at the mMC1R, mMC3R, and mMC4R, respectively. Importantly, the altered potencies due to Ala substitutions in α-MSH did not necessarily correlate with equivalent Ala substitutions in NDP-MSH, indicating that structural modifications and corresponding biological activities in one of these melanocortin ligands may not be predictive for the other agonist.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25575595>Characterization of the pivotal carbon metabolism of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 under ex vivo and chemically defined in vitro conditions by isotopologue profiling.</a></h2><p>Streptococcus suis is a neglected zoonotic pathogen that has to adapt to the nutritional requirements in the different host niches encountered during infection and establishment of invasive diseases. To dissect the central metabolic activity of S. suis under different conditions of nutrient availability, we performed labeling experiments starting from [(13)C]glucose specimens and analyzed the resulting isotopologue patterns in amino acids of S. suis grown under in vitro and ex vivo conditions. In combination with classical growth experiments, we found that S. suis is auxotrophic for Arg, Gln/Glu, His, Leu, and Trp in chemically defined medium. De novo biosynthesis was shown for Ala, Asp, Ser, and Thr at high rates and for Gly, , , Tyr, and  at moderate or low rates, respectively. Glucose degradation occurred mainly by  and to a minor extent by the pentose phosphate pathway. Furthermore, the exclusive formation of oxaloacetate by phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylation became evident from the patterns in de novo synthesized amino acids. Labeling experiments with S. suis grown ex vivo in blood or cerebrospinal fluid reflected the metabolic adaptation to these host niches with different nutrient availability; however, similar key metabolic activities were identified under these conditions. This points at the robustness of the core metabolic pathways in S. suis during the infection process. The crucial role of PEP carboxylation for growth of S. suis in the host was supported by experiments with a PEP carboxylase-deficient mutant strain in blood and cerebrospinal fluid.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26108540>Methionyl-Methionine Promotes α-s1 Casein Synthesis in Bovine Mammary Gland Explants by Enhancing Intracellular Substrate Availability and Activating JAK2-STAT5 and mTOR-Mediated Signaling Pathways.</a></h2><p>Interest is increasing in the role of peptide-bound amino acids (AAs) in milk protein synthesis because studies have found that the uptake of some essential AAs by the mammary gland cannot meet the requirements for milk protein synthesis. Although the role of dipeptides in milk protein synthesis is clearly established, little is known about the underlying mechanisms.The objective of this study was to determine whether small peptides can be taken up intact by the peptide transporters in mammary tissue explants and the underlying mechanisms of the effects of methionyl-methionine (Met-Met) supplementation on milk protein synthesis.Mammary tissue explants were cultured in conditional medium and then treated with different concentrations of Met-Met that replaced 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and 25% of free Met for another 24 h. In some experiments, explants were cultured with an optimal dose of Met-Met with or without the inhibitors of peptide transporter 2 [PepT2; diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC), 0.1 mmol/L] and aminopeptidase N (APN; bestatin, 20 μmol/L) for 24 h.The substitutions of 15% free Met with Met-Met significantly promoted α-s1 casein (αs1-CN) expression in the mammary explants (P < 0.05). The inhibition of the PepT2 by DEPC or APN by bestatin significantly decreased the Met-Met-stimulated increase of αs1-CN expression (P < 0.05). Compared with the control group (0% Met-Met), absorption of , Met, Leu, , , and His was improved, and mRNA abundance of the neutral and basic AA transporter was increased in the 15% Met-Met group (P < 0.05). In addition, the mRNA abundance of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 gene, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 gene , Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) was increased in the 15% Met-Met-treated group (P < 0.05).Met-Met promoted αs1-CN synthesis in cultured bovine mammary gland explants, and this stimulation may be mediated by enhanced intracellular substrate availability and by activating JAK2-STAT5 and mTOR signaling pathways.© 2015 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29271090>Peptide (-Leu) and amino acids ( and Leu) supplementations improve physiological activity and fermentation performance of brewer's yeast during very high-gravity (VHG) wort fermentation.</a></h2><p> and Leu were generally considered as the key amino acids for brewer's yeast during beer brewing.

Four diets were prepared to contain FFSB, SBM-43, SBM-47, and PNF as the sole source of N. A N-free diet was formulated to estimate the basal ileal endogenous losses of CP and AA for broiler chickens and pigs. In Exp. 1, a total of four hundred sixteen 21-d-old male broiler chickens (922.1 ± 79.9 g initial BW) were assigned to 5 experimental diets in a randomized complete block design with BW as a blocking factor. After 5 d of adaptation, ileal digesta samples were collected after birds were euthanized by CO asphyxiation. In Exp. 2, twenty barrows (62.0 ± 6.9 kg initial BW) surgically fitted with T-cannulas at the distal ileum were allotted to 5 experimental diets with 2 consecutive 7-d experimental periods. After 5 d of adaptation, ileal digesta samples were collected at d 6 and 7. For statistical analysis, treatments were considered a 2 × 4 factorial arrangement with effects of species and experimental diets (Exp. 1 vs. Exp. 2). There were no interactions between species and diets for the digestibility of CP and AA except for Cys ( < 0.01). The AID of CP and indispensable AA in pigs were greater ( < 0.01) than in broiler chickens. In both broiler chickens and pigs, the AID of CP and indispensable AA in SBM-47 were greater ( < 0.05) than in FFSB, and the AID of  in PNF was the least ( < 0.05) among ingredients. The SID of CP and indispensable AA in pigs were greater ( < 0.05) than in broiler chickens except for Trp. In both broiler chickens and pigs, the SID of  in PNF was the least ( < 0.05) among ingredients. In broiler chickens, the SID of CP, Ile, Leu, Thr, Trp, and  in FFSB were less ( < 0.05) than that in SBM-43, SBM-47, and PNF. In pigs, the SID of Arg, Ile, Leu, Met, , and  in FFSB were less ( < 0.05) than in SBM-43, SBM-47, and PNF.

Synthetic peptides conjugated to radionuclides or photosensitizers may serve to identify and treat skin tumors and their metastatic forms in other organs of the body. In the introductory part of this review, the role and interplay of the different peptides in the skin are briefly summarized, including their potential application for the management of frequently occurring skin cancers. Special emphasis is given to different targeting options for the treatment of melanoma and melanotic lesions. Radionuclide Targeting: α-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) is the most prominent peptide for targeting of melanoma tumors via the G protein-coupled melanocortin-1 receptor that is (over-)expressed by melanoma cells and melanocytes. More than 100 different linear and cyclic analogs of α-MSH containing chelators for 111In, 67/68Ga, 64Cu, 90Y, 212Pb, 99mTc, 188Re were synthesized and examined with experimental animals and in a few clinical studies. Linear Ac-Nle-Asp-His-D--Arg-Trp-Gly--NH2 (NAP-amide) and Re-cyclized Cys- Cys-Glu-His-D--Arg-Trp-Cys-Arg-Pro--NH2 (Re[Arg11]CCMSH) containing different chelators at the N- or C-terminus served as lead compounds for peptide drugs with further optimized characteristics. Alternatively, melanoma may be targeted with radiopeptides that bind to melanin granules occurring extracellularly in these tumors. Photosensitizer targeting: A more recent approach is the application of photosensitizers attached to the MSH molecule for targeted photodynamic therapy using LED or coherent laser light that specifically activates the photosensitizer. Experimental studies have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach as a more gentle and convenient alternative compared to radionuclides.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29471545>High-protein distillers dried grains with solubles produced using a novel front-end-back-end fractionation technology has greater nutritional value than conventional distillers dried grains with solubles when fed to growing pigs.</a></h2><p>Two experiments were conducted to determine the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of CP and AA, apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of GE, and DE and ME in conventional distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS-CV) and in a novel source of high-protein distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS-HP) produced by Lincolnway Energy (Nevada, IA). In Exp. 1, 18 barrows (initial BW: 72.47 ± 9.16 kg) that had a T-cannula installed in the distal ileum were allotted to a completely randomized design with 3 diets and 6 replicate pigs per diet. A nitrogen-free diet and 2 diets that contained cornstarch and DDGS-CV or DDGS-HPLincolnway as the sole source of CP and AA were formulated. Diets were fed to pigs for 7 d, and ileal digesta were collected on days 6 and 7 of each period. The SID for Leu, , Met, , and Glu was greater (P < 0.05) in DDGS-HPLincolnway than in DDGS-CV, and the SID of Ile, , and total indispensable AA, as well as the SID of Tyr, tended to be greater (P < 0.10) in DDGS-HPLincolnway than in DDGS-CV. No difference between DDGS-CV and DDGS-HPLincolnway was observed for the SID of CP and all other AA.

Data from 25 papers, published from 1995 to 2018, for a total of 44 trials and 210 observations were recorded in a database. Diets were reformulated using the NRC (2012) loading values to estimate nutrient concentrations. The response variables were average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and gain-to-feed ratio (G:F). The predictor variables tested included average body weight (BW), crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, Ile:, Leu:, :, BCAA:, Ile:Leu, :Leu, Ile:, (Ile+):Leu, Trp:, Leu:Trp, Ile:Trp, :Trp, BCAA:Trp, Met:, Leu:Met, Ile:Met, :Met, BCAA:Met, His:, Leu:His, Ile:His, :His, BCAA:His, Thr:, Leu:Thr, Ile:Thr, :Thr, BCAA:Thr, (+Tyr):, Leu:(+Tyr), Ile:(+Tyr), :(+Tyr), BCAA:(+Tyr), LNAA:, Leu:LNAA, Ile:LNAA, :LNAA, and BCAA:LNAA. Amino acids were expressed on standardized ileal digestible basis. The MIXED procedure of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used to develop the equations. The inverse of squared SEM was used to account for heterogeneous errors using the WEIGHT statement. Models were selected with a step-wise manual forward selection. In order to be included in the final model, predictor variables had to be statistically significant (P < 0.05) and provide an improvement of at least 2 points in Bayesian information criterion. The optimum equations were: ADG, g = - 985.94 + (15.2499 × average BW (kg)) - (0.08885 × average BW × average BW) + (1.063 × Leu:) + (20.2659 × Ile:) - (0.1479 × Ile: × Ile:) + (9.2243 × (Ile+):Leu) - (0.03321 × (Ile+):Leu × (Ile+):Leu) - (0.4413 × Ile:Trp); G:F, g/kg = 648.3 - (6.2974 × average BW (kg)) + (0.02051 × average BW × average BW) + (0.5396 × Ile:) + (1.7284 × :) - (0.00795 × : × :) - (1.7594 × Met:); and ADFI, kg = predicted ADG/predicted G:F. Overall, the prediction equations suggest that increasing Leu: negatively impacts ADG due to a reduction in G:F and ADFI caused by insufficient levels of other BCAA and LNAA relative to Leu. According to the model, the addition of , Ile, and Trp, alone or in combination, has the potential to counteract the negative effects of high dietary Leu concentrations on growth performance.© The Author(s) 2019.

Leukocyte recruitment is a key step, mediated partly by chemotactic complement activation factors C3a and C5a. However, mechanisms mediating C3a/C5a generation during thrombosis have not been studied. In a murine venous thrombosis model, levels of thrombin-antithrombin complexes poorly correlated with C3a and C5a, excluding a central role for thrombin in C3a/C5a production. However, clot weight strongly correlated with C5a, suggesting processes triggered during thrombosis promote C5a generation. Since thrombosis elicits fibrinolysis, we hypothesized that plasmin activates C5 during thrombosis. In vitro, the catalytic efficiency of plasmin-mediated C5a generation greatly exceeded that of thrombin or factor Xa, but was similar to the recognized complement C5 convertases. Plasmin-activated C5 yielded a functional membrane attack complex (MAC). In an arterial thrombosis model, plasminogen activator administration increased C5a levels. Overall, these findings suggest plasmin bridges thrombosis and the immune response by liberating C5a and inducing MAC assembly. These new insights may lead to the development of strategies to limit thrombus formation and/or enhance resolution.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25087732>Enzymatic hydrolysis optimization of Paphia undulata and lymphocyte proliferation activity of the isolated peptide fractions.</a></h2><p>The immune system is important in preventing and controlling various infectious diseases. Immunoactive peptides derived from food proteins could exert immunomodulatory activity without side effects. Paphia undulata with high-protein is suitable for the production of immunoactive peptides. The objective of this study was to optimize the hydrolysis parameters to maximize the immune activity of hydrolysates from Paphia undulata.Hydrolysis parameters, including temperature, time and the ratio of alkaline protease to Paphia undulata meat (E/S), were optimized by response surface methodology with a central composite design. The optimum conditions were obtained as follows: temperature, 51 °C; time, 3.14 h; E/S, 4,321 U g(-1) (Paphia undulata meat). Furthermore, hydrolysates obtained under the optimum conditions were fractionated by ultrafiltration and gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column. After two-step isolation, the isolated fractions (P2 and P3) including the peptides Pro-His-Thr-Cys, -Gly-Try-Thr, Glu-, Leu-, and Glu-Gly-Ala-, Trp-Ile or Trp-Leu, respectively, could significantly enhance lymphocyte proliferation ability.These results showed that response surface methodology and two-step separation were efficient for recovery of low-molecular-weight peptides with high spleen lymphocyte proliferation activity, and the isolated fractions of Paphia undulata hydrolysates are potential ingredients for development of functional foods.© 2014 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28380608>Performance, intestinal microflora, and amino acid digestibility altered by exogenous enzymes in broilers fed wheat- or sorghum-based diets.</a></h2><p>The objective of the current study was to compare the effects of dietary enzymes and nutrient restriction on performance and bone mineralization in birds fed wheat- or sorghum-based diets. A total of 720 d-old male broiler chicks were randomly allocated to 8 treatments, with 6 replicates per treatment and 15 birds per replicate. Birds were reared in floor pens from 0 to 35 d. The study used a 2 × 4 factorial arrangement with 2 grains (sorghum or wheat) and 4 diets: positive control (no enzyme and ME, digestible , Ca, and P sufficient, negative control (NC; no enzyme and reduced ME [-100 kcal/kg], digestible AA [-2%], Ca [-0.12 percentage points], and available P [-0.18 percentage points in the starter phase and -0.22 percentage points in the grower phase]), NC + nonstarch polysaccharide-degrading enzymes + phytase (500 phytase units [FTU]; NCCP), and NC + phytase (1,000 FTU; NCP). From 0 to 35 d, birds fed wheat-based diets had greater G:F (4.5%), BW gain (9.2%), breast meat yield (6.8%), and tibia ash (2.0%) compared with birds fed sorghum-based diets. Across grain types, the NCCP treatment improved BW gain ( < 0.001), feed intake ( < 0.001), G:F ( < 0.05), and livability ( < 0.001) compared with the NC treatment. Birds fed NCP had greater BW gain ( < 0.001), feed intake ( < 0.001), G:F ( < 0.001), and livability ( < 0.001) compared with birds fed NC. Birds fed the NCP diet had greater BW gain ( < 0.001), toe ash ( < 0.01), and tibia ash ( < 0.001) compared with birds fed the NCCP diet. There was a grain × diet interaction for feed intake ( < 0.01), BW gain ( < 0.001), tibia ash ( < 0.01), and tibia breaking strength ( < 0.05). The influence of enzymes was more pronounced in sorghum-based diets than in wheat-based diets. Birds fed wheat-based diets had greater ileal digestibility of His, Met, , , Ile, Leu, Trp, Glu, Pro, Ala, Tyr, and Cys compared with those fed sorghum-based diets ( < 0.05). Across grain types, NCP had greater apparent ileal digestibility of Met, , Ser, Pro, Gly, and Cys than NC ( < 0.05). The results suggest that wheat is superior to sorghum for broilers, as expected, but that enzyme supplementation has the capability to restore the compromised bird performance due to feeding sorghum. In addition, compared with nonstarch polysaccharide-degrading enzymes and phytase (500 FTU/kg feed) added in concert, phytase supplemented at 1,000 FTU/kg resulted in a further improvement of some of the performance and bone mineralization parameters in male broilers fed sorghum-based diets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29044929>Anticancer activity of VmCT1 analogs against MCF-7 cells.</a></h2><p>Antimicrobial peptides are considered promising drug candidates due to their broad range of activity. VmCT1 (-Leu-Gly-Ala-Leu-Trp-Asn--Ala--Ser---NH ) is an α-helical antimicrobial peptide that was obtained from the Vaejovis mexicanus smithi scorpion venom. Some of its analogs showed to be as antimicrobial as the wild type, and they were designed for understanding the influence of physiochemical parameters on antimicrobial and hemolytic activity. Some cationic antimicrobial peptides exhibit anticancer activity so VmCT1 analogs were tested to verify the anticancer activity of this family of peptides. The analogs were synthesized, purified, characterized, and the conformational studies were performed. The anticancer activity was assessed against MCF-7 mammary cancer cells. The results indicated that [Glu] -VmCT1-NH , [] -VmCT1-NH , and [] -VmCT1-NH analogs presented moderated helical tendency (0.23-0.61) and tendency of anticancer activity at 25 μmol/L in 24 hr of experiment; and [Trp] -VmCT1-NH analog that presented low helical tendency and moderated anticancer activity at 50 μmol/L. These results demonstrated that single substitutions on VmCT1 led to different physicochemical features and could assist on the understanding of anticancer activity of this peptide family.© 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29567240>Production of antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory peptides from Kluyveromyces marxianus protein hydrolysates: Purification and molecular docking.</a></h2><p>Kluyveromyces marxianus protein hydrolysates were prepared by two different sonicated-enzymatic (trypsin and chymotrypsin) hydrolysis treatments to obtain antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory peptides.

One fragment (LL-9, MW = 1180 Da) with the amino acid sequence of Leu-Pro-Glu-Ser--His-Leu-Asp- showed significant ACE inhibitory activity (IC = 22.88 μM) while another peptide fragment (VL-9, MW = 1118 Da) with the amino acid sequence of -Leu-Ser-Thr-Ser--Pro-Pro- showed the highest antioxidant and ACE inhibitory properties (IC = 15.20 μM, 5568 μM TE/mg protein). The molecular docking studies revealed that the ACE inhibitory activities of VL-9 is due to interaction with the S2 (His513, His353, Glu281) and S'1 (Glu162) pockets of ACE and LL-9 can fit perfectly into the S1 (Thr345) and S2 (Tyr520, Lys511, Gln281) pockets of ACE.Copyright © 2017.

The cultures were then split into 10 ml tubes and individually treated with 10 mg ml IAA, IBA or NAA (auxin catabolism and homeostasis); IAPhe, IALeu, IAA-ala, IAA-glucose (IAA conjugate hydrolysis); or l-, l-leu, l-ileu, l-, l-ala, l-, l-arg, l-glu, l-his, l-met, l-asp, l-cys, l-ser, l-pro, l-thr and l-trp (regulation of IAA biosynthesis and IAA conjugation). Bacterial growth, IAA production and ipdC expression were evaluated. None of the A. brasilense strains were able to hydrolyse IAA conjugates, catabolize auxins, or conjugate IAA with amino acids or glucose. l-amino acids l-met, l-, l-cys and l-ser inhibited bacterial growth and decreased IAA biosynthesis. The expression of ipdC and IAA biosynthesis but not bacterial growth was affected by l-leu, l-, l-ala, l-ile, l-pro. l-arg, l-glu, l-his, l-, l-asp and l-thr did not affect any of the measured parameters.In this paper, we confirmed that A. brasilense produces IAA only in presence of l-trp is not able to degrade auxins, conjugate IAA with sugars and/or l-amino acids, or hydrolyse such conjugates to release free IAA.

In this paper, we present a novel method to identify peptide binding to seven matrix metalloproteases. First, we propose a novel sampling criteria for constructing a training set for each new peptide motif. Then, we select nine physicochemical properties of amino acids and compute their auto-cross covariance to effectively extract features for both natural and non-natural amino acids. Finally, we adopt random forest to predict binding values of each peptide motif respectively with seven MMPs. Our method verifies on 1300 known peptide motifs binding to seven MMPs and achieved preeminent Pearson-product-moment correlation coefficient (PCC) and root mean squared error (RMSE) on all seven MMPs, especially of 0.9181 and 9.3827 on MMP-7. We predict binding values of 4000 peptide motifs and identify peptides preferentially bind to MMP-2 and MMP-7. We herein report 4 novel inhibitor candidates of Asp-Ile-, Asp-Ile-Tyr, Asp-Ile- and Hser-Gly- with high potency and selectivity binding to MMP-2, as well as 6 novel inhibitor candidates of Chg-Ile-Ile, Chg-Ile-Leu, Chg-Ile-Glu, Chg-Ile-Met, Chg--Ile and Chg--Leu selectively binding to MMP-7.

Illuminated chloroplasts are one of the important sources of hydrogen peroxide (H O ) and are highly sensitive to environmental stimuli, yet a comprehensive view of the oxidation-sensitive chloroplast proteome is still missing. By targeting the sulfenic acid YAP1C-trapping technology to the plastids of light-grown Arabidopsis cells, we identified 132 putatively sulfenylated plastid proteins upon H O pulse treatment. Almost half of the sulfenylated proteins are enzymes of the amino acid metabolism. Using metabolomics, we observed a reversible decrease in the levels of the amino acids Ala, Asn, Cys, Gln, Glu, His, Ile, Leu, , , Ser, Thr and  after H O treatment, which is in line with an anticipated decrease in the levels of the  and tricarboxylic acid metabolites. Through the identification of an organelle-tailored proteome, we demonstrated that the subcellular targeting of the YAP1C probe enables us to study in vivo cysteine sulfenylation at the organellar level. All in all, the identification of these oxidation events in plastids revealed that several enzymes of the amino acid metabolism rapidly undergo cysteine oxidation upon oxidative stress.© 2018 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27694057>Melanoma targeting with [Tc(N)(PNP3)]-labeled α-melanocyte stimulating hormone peptide analogs: Effects of cyclization on the radiopharmaceutical properties.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of cyclization on the biological profile of a [Tc(N)(PNP3)]-labeled α-melanocyte stimulating hormone peptide analog. A lactam bridge-cyclized H-Cys-Ahx-βAla-c[-Glu-His-D--Arg-Trp-Glu]-Arg-Pro--NH (NAP-NS2) and the corresponding linear H-Cys-Ahx-βAla-Nle-Asp-His-D--Arg-Trp-Gly-NH (NAP-NS1) peptide were synthetized, characterized by ESI-MS spectroscopy and their melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) binding affinity was determined in B16/F10 melanoma cells. The consistent [Tc(N)(PNP3)]-labeled compounds were readily obtained in high specific activity and their stability and biological properties were assessed. As an example, the chemical identity of [Tc(N)(NAP-NS1)(PNP3)] was confirmed by carrier added experiments supported by radio/UV HPLC analysis combined with ESI(+)-MS. Compared with the linear peptide, cyclization negatively affected the biological properties of NAP-NS2 peptide by reducing its binding affinity for MC1R and by decreasing the overall excretion rate of the corresponding [Tc(N)(PNP3)]-labeled peptide from the body as well as its in vivo stability. [Tc(N)(NAP-NS1)(PNP3)] was evaluated for its potential as melanoma imaging probe in murine melanoma model. Data from in vitro and in vivo studies on B16/F10 melanoma model of [Tc(N)(NAP-NS1)(PNP3)] clearly evidenced that the radiolabeled linear peptide keeps its biological properties up on the conjugation to the [Tc(N)(PNP3)]-building block.

The emergence of drug-resistant E. aerogenes demands the need for developing new drugs. Peptidoglycan is an important component of the cell wall of bacteria and the peptidoglycan biochemical pathway is considered as the best source of antibacterial targets. Within this pathway, four Mur ligases MurC, MurD, MurE, and MurF are responsible for the successive additions of L-alanine and suitable targets for developing novel antibacterial drugs. As an inference from this fact, we modeled the three-dimensional structure of above Mur ligases using best template structures available in PDB and analyzed its common binding features. Structural refinement and energy minimization of the predicted Mur ligases models is also being done using molecular dynamics studies. The models of Mur ligases were further investigated for in silico docking studies using bioactive plant compounds from the literature. Interestingly, these results indicate that four plant compounds Isojuripidine, Atroviolacegenin, Porrigenin B, and Nummularogenin showing better docking results in terms of binding energy and number of hydrogen bonds. All these four compounds are spirostan-based compounds with differences in side chains and the amino acid such as ASN, , THR, HIS, ARG (polar) and , GLY, , ALA, MET (non-polar) playing active role in binding site of all four Mur ligases.

In trial 1, 11 dietary treatments were fed from 1 to 18 d of age containing 1.20% digestible . Diet 1 (23.2% CP) was formulated with DL-Met, L-, and L-Thr to contain 1.70 total Gly + Ser to digestible  ratio whereas diets 2 (23.4% CP) to 11 were formulated with additional Gly to contain 1.90 total Gly + Ser to digestible  ratio. Free AA were added sequentially in the order of limitation (L-, L-Ile, L-Arg, L-Trp, L-His, L-, and L-Leu) from diets 3 to 10 to decrease CP content from 22.6 to 18.8%, respectively. In diet 11, L-Gln was added to increase the CP content to 23.4%. Feed conversion of broilers fed diet 2 was lower (P < 0.05) than those consuming diets 6 to 11 from 1 to 17 d of age. Nitrogen excretion (mg/b/d) decreased (P < 0.001) by 14.1% when broilers were fed diet 4 compared with birds fed diet 2 from 15 to 16 d of age. Broilers fed diet 4 had lower (P = 0.011) plasma UA concentration than birds fed diet 2 at 18 d of age. In trial 2, 8 dietary treatments containing 1.25% digestible  and 1.70 total Gly + Ser to digestible  ratio were fed from 1 to 21 d of age. Diet 1 (24.0% CP) was supplemented with DL-Met, L-, and L-Thr. Free AA (L-, Gly, L-Ile, L-Arg, L-Trp, L-His, and L-) were sequentially supplemented in the order of limitation to decrease CP content in diets 2 to 8 from 23.8 to 20.3%. Broilers fed diet 1 had higher (P < 0.05) body weight gain and lower (P < 0.05) feed conversion when compared with diet 7 or 8.

Three genotypes, Grenado, EAW6002 and Lasko, were cultivated with and without nitrogen fertilisation at the end of the heading stage. The six triticale variants as well as a basal diet were each used to feed seven laying hens in a 7 × 7 Latin square design.Nitrogen fertilisation influenced the digestibility of Cys, Glu,  and Ser in some triticale genotypes and reduced Ala, Ile, , Met and  digestibility in all genotypes (P < 0.05). Nitrogen fertilisation increased the concentration of all AAs in the grain. Consequently, the concentration of digestible AAs in the grains was increased for most AAs upon nitrogen fertilisation. Overall,  had the lowest digestibility, whereas that of Glu and Pro was the highest. For the triticale genotypes, the level of AA digestibility was highest for EAW6002 followed by Lasko and Grenado, with significant differences (P < 0.05) between genotypes for some but not all AAs.The results indicated that the accuracy of the digestible AA supply for hen feeding might benefit from considering fertilisation and genotype-specific digestibility data in feed formulation. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25912872>Relationships between circulating plasma concentrations and duodenal flows of essential amino acids in lactating dairy cows.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to better define essential AA (EAA) requirements in lactating dairy cows through examination of the relationship between plasma essential AA concentration (p[EAA]) and predicted duodenal flow of essential AA (EAAduo). Our hypothesis was that at a given level of milk protein output, p[EAA] would remain steady in response to increasing EAAduo until the EAA requirement was met, at which point p[EAA] would increase rapidly in response to greater duodenal flow of EAA until p[EAA] reached a plateau as other body processes degraded excess EAA to avoid toxicity. Thus, the requirement of each EAA would be fulfilled when p[EAA] increased rapidly. To investigate this hypothesis, we compiled a literature database that included 102 studies with 420 treatment means that reported p[EAA], dietary nutrient content, body weight, and milk production. A second database was produced to validate relationships developed in the first database and included 32 studies with 98 treatment means. All relationships were evaluated as regression equations with study as a random factor. Breed, days in milk, body weight, and milk protein production had no effect on the plasma concentration of any EAA. Other than metabolizable protein supply, nutritional content of the rations did not affect p[EAA]. Only p[Arg] was affected by parity, with primiparous cows having higher concentrations of Arg than older cows. No break points in the relationship between p[EAA] versus EAAduo were detected as either steep increases or plateaus. Plasma Arg, Ile, , Thr, and  concentrations were best associated with their respective EAAduo as quadratic equations, whereas His, Leu, Met, and  were associated only linearly. Adding a quadratic term improved the adjusted R(2) or decreased the root mean square error marginally (<2.0%). Thus, we conclude that the main effect of EAAduo on p[EAA] is linear. Abomasal or duodenal infusions of Met, , His, +Met, and casein revealed that Met or  infused alone increased the plasma concentration of the infused EAA and lowered the concentration of other EAA, particularly His. Infusion of +Met or His alone was associated with increases in concentrations of these EAA without affecting others. We conclude that over a wide range of protein intakes in lactating cows, plasma levels of EAA increase linearly with duodenal flow. No evidence was found that EAA requirements are reflected in blood plasma concentrations.Copyright © 2015 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Excreta samples were collected to analyze the dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), ether extract (EE), crude protein (CP), gross energy (GE), and amino acids (AA), and GE was analyzed for computation of AME and TME. As compared with those of the control treatment, the apparent digestibility (AD) and true digestibility (TD) of EE, CP, Thr, , Ile, Leu, , , His, and Arg were quadratically (P < 0.05) increased; moreover, the AD and TD of Met was linearly (P < 0.05) increased as the concentration of the EGB in the diet increased. Increasing GL from 0 to 60 g/kg of diet linearly (P < 0.05) increased the AD and TD of EE, Thr, , Leu, His, and Met and tended (0.05 < P < 0.1) to increase the TME, TMEn, and Arg. Supplementation of EGB increased (P < 0.05) AD and TD of EE, Thr, , Ile, Leu, , His, and Arg and tended (0.05 < P < 0.1) to increase  as compared with those in the GL-supplemented groups.

Ala, Gln, Gly, ,  and taurine (Tau) are the most abundant free AAs in mammals, and some of these react with hypochlorite (HOCl/OCl) produced by myeloperoxidase in activated phagocytes to form N-chloroamino acids (NCAA). In this study, we reacted 20 AAs and Tau with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), then classified the products into five types (I-V) based on the change in their absorbance. Type I AAs (Ala, Arg, Gln, Gly, Ile, , , Ser, Tau, Thr and ) generated a typical monochloramine peak at 252 nm, while Type II AAs (Asn and Tyr) and Type III AAs (Glu and Leu) produced peaks at 275 nm and 225 nm, respectively. The Type IV AAs (His, Met and Trp) did not show any distinct absorption peak, and Type V AAs (Asp, Cys and Pro) did not appear to react with NaOCl. The ArgCl and TauCl were stable, while GlnCl, GlyCl, IleCl, LysCl, PheCl and ValCl were less stable and AlaCl, SerCl and ThrCl were the least stable. Tau is the most abundant non-proteinogenic free AA in cellular fluid and has many physiological functions in the nervous, cardiovascular, renal and immune systems. Tau reacts with HOCl to form TauCl, which inhibits the production of proinflammatory mediators such as superoxide, nitric oxide (NO) and interleukins, while increasing the antioxidant proteins in macrophages. We determined the effects of Type I NCAA on cell viability, NO and TNF-α production in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 cells. All Type I NCAA showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity and inhibited LPS-induced NO production. However, only GlnCl, GlyCl, IleCl, LysCl, SerCl and TauCl inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α production. In summary, Type I NCAA showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity and inhibited NO production, while their effects on TNF-α varied.

An emerging theme in amyloid research is the hypothesis that the toxic species produced during amyloid formation share common physic-chemical features and exert their effects by common modes. This prompted the idea that molecules able to inhibit a protein aggregation process may cross-react with other amyloidogenic proteins, interfering in their fibrils formation. We investigate the ability of analogues of the heptapeptide H-Arg---MePhe-Tyr-Thr-Trp- OH2, an inhibitor of Aβ-peptide aggregation, to cross-react with α-synuclein interfering with its fibril formation. The influence of the MePhe topography on the interaction with α-synuclein has also been evaluated, replacing the MePhe residue with either  or the conformationally restricted Tic residues.

Infectious diseases repartition AA away from protein retention toward processes involved in immune defense, thus impacting AA utilization in pigs. The current study sought to evaluate the effects of disease induced by a live pathogen on plasma free AA flux and whole-body nitrogen (N) utilization. Twenty gilts (BW 9.4 ± 0.9 kg) were surgically catheterized into the jugular vein, individually housed in  crates, and feed-restricted (550 g/d). Intramuscular inoculation of a live field strain of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) was used to induce disease. Whole-body N-balance was conducted across 3 d both before PRRSV inoculation (PRRSV-) and also after PRRSV inoculation (PRRSV+). At the end of each N-balance period, a bolus dose of a labeled [U-13C, U-15N]-AA mixture (Ile, Leu, , Met, , Thr, Trp, , and Gln) was infused intravenously, followed by serial blood collection for measurement of isotopic enrichment. A double exponential model was fitted with plasma enrichment data for each pig and each AA, and equation parameters were used to estimate plasma free AA flux and pool size. Apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of dietary N was determined using the slaughter technique and an indigestible marker. Blood chemistry, hematology, body temperature, and serum viremia indicated that PRRSV induced effective immune response in pigs (P < 0.05). Challenge with PRRSV reduced the AID of N (P < 0.05), but had no effect on apparent total tract digestibility of dietary energy (P = 0.12). Plasma flux (µmol/kg BW/h) for Met and Thr was increased by PRRSV infection (P < 0.05). A strong tendency of increased  flux was observed in PRRSV+ pigs (P = 0.06). Infection with PRRSV increased the pool size for , Met, Thr, Trp, Leu, , and Gln (P < 0.05). Collectively, these results suggest that PRRSV alters the utilization of dietary N and AA flux, as well as pool size, in growing pigs. The increase in Thr and Met flux in PRRSV+ pigs may be associated with enhanced utilization of these AA for the synthesis of immune system metabolites and increased catabolism of these AA. Thus, dietary Met, Thr, and  requirements may increase in pigs infected with PRRSV, relative to the requirements for other AA.© The Author(s) 2019.

The serum concentration (SC) of free AA in pigs can be used as indicators of their availability. This study was conducted with 12 crossbred (Landrace × Hampshire × Duroc) pigs (29.0 ± 2.8 kg initial BW) distributed into 2 groups to analyze the SC of free AA and some AA metabolites in pigs exposed to HS conditions. The treatments were pigs housed under natural HS conditions in a room with no ambient temperature control (23.6 to 37.6°C, HS) and pigs housed at thermoneutral conditions (24 ± 2°C), feed restricted to a level similar to that of their HS counterparts. All pigs received a wheat-soybean meal diet. Blood samples were collected at both the absorptive (2.5 h after a meal) and postabsorptive (10.0 h after a meal) phase. At the absorptive phase, the SC of free Arg, Leu, , , Thr, and Trp were lower ( < 0.05) and the SC of His, , Ala, Pro, Ser, and Tyr tended to be lower ( < 0.10) in HS pigs. At the postabsorptive phase, the SC of free Arg, His, Met, Asn, Gln, and Tyr were higher ( < 0.05) but the SC of Ala was lower ( < 0.01) and the SC of Pro tended to be lower ( < 0.10) in HS pigs.

The results of this study show a marked and differential effect of HS on the SC of AA.

The data set contained 147 treatment means [i.e., 66 controls (CTL) and 81 casein-infused (CAS) means]. Each CAS mean was paired with its corresponding CTL mean to create 81 mean differences (CAS minus CTL), which were analyzed as absolute and percentage-based units (i.e., percentage increase or decrease in CAS relative to CTL). The primary variable of interest was the difference in estimated metabolizable protein (MP) supply (ΔMP) between CAS and CTL. The other explanatory variables were based on levels in CTL: MP supply, MP balance, the ratio of duodenal microbial protein (MCP) to MP supply (MCPMP), the stage of lactation (early or mid/late) and the type of forage (grass/legume- or corn silage-based). The MP supply and MP balance influenced negatively the relationship between ΔMP and the response of true protein yield. Responses of milk urea, blood urea, and plasma urea cycle AA concentrations were associated positively with ΔMP, indicating that a large amount of infused AA was catabolized to urea. Responses of plasma essential AA concentrations were related positively to ΔMP. The relative effect of ΔMP was highest for responses of plasma His concentration in cows fed grass/legume-based diets and at high MCPMP ratios. This relationship suggests that positive responses of plasma His concentrations are associated with diets relying heavily on microbial protein synthesis (high MCP), low in crude protein (low estimated MP supply), or both. The relationship between ΔMP and responses of plasma group 2 AA (Ile, Leu, , and ) concentrations was approximately 2 times greater than that for group 1 AA (His, Met, and +Tyr) at mean MCPMP and MP supply. This could reflect the low hepatic removal group 2 AA compared with group 1 AA in dairy cows. Collectively, these results provide novel information on how dietary and cow conditions may alter responses to protein supplementation.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.

Pigs were provided a cornstarch N-free diet (CST) or a diet containing 5% inulin (INU), carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC), microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), or Solka-Floc (SFC). Apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of DM, ash, and GE were greater ( < 0.05) in the MCC and SFC diets than in the INU and CMC diets. Apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of DM, carbohydrates (CHO), and GE and the DE content in the CST and INU diets were greater ( < 0.01) than in the CMC, MCC, and SFC diets. Hindgut disappearance of DM, CHO, and GE in the INU diet was greater ( < 0.05) than in the other N-free diets. The ileal endogenous flow of His, Ile, Leu, Met, Thr, , and all dispensable AA in the CMC diet was greater ( < 0.05) than in the other diets. In Exp. 2, 6 ileal-cannulated pigs were allotted to 3 diets containing either a corn-soybean meal control diet or the control diet with 5% INU or CMC in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square design. Standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of Ala, Arg, Asp, Cys, Gly, His, Ile, Leu, , , Ser, Thr, and  were greater ( < 0.05) in the CMC diet than in the control and INU diets. Incorporation of 5% INU or CMC in the control diet reduced ( < 0.01) the AID of arabinoxylan and insoluble and total NSP. The ATTD of NSP and cellulose and the hindgut disappearance of NSP, β-glucan, and cellulose in the CMC diet were less ( < 0.01) than in the control and INU diets. Inclusion of 5% INU in the diet increased ( < 0.01) hindgut fermentation of insoluble and total NSP compared with the control and CMC diets. In conclusion, depending on the viscosity and fermentability of the NSP, different sources will have different effects on nutrient digestibility and hindgut fermentation. Addition of 5% INU to a corn-soybean meal diet reduced digestibility of the NSP component in the ileum and increased hindgut fermentation of total NSP. In contrast, the inclusion of CMC increased the AID and SID of the diet and reduced total tract digestion and hindgut fermentation of NSP component. Carboxymethylcellulose sodium is not recommended as a source of synthetic fiber in a N-free diet to determine the SID of AA of diets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25306378>Nine novel angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides from cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) muscle protein hydrolysates and antihypertensive effect of the potent active peptide in spontaneously hypertensive rats.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to identify novel ACE inhibitory peptides from the muscle of cuttlefish. Proteins were hydrolyzed and the hydrolysates were then subjected to various types of chromatography to isolate the active peptides. Nine ACE inhibitory peptides were isolated and their molecular masses and amino acid sequences were determined using ESI-MS and ESI-MS/MS, respectively. The structures of the most potent peptides were identified as -Glu-Leu-Tyr-Pro, Ala---Gly-Tyr--Leu-Pro and Glu--Ser-Tyr-Glu-Leu-Pro. The first peptide displayed the highest ACE inhibitory activity with an IC50 of 5.22μM. Lineweaver-Burk plots suggest that -Glu-Leu-Tyr-Pro acts as a non-competitive inhibitor against ACE. Furthermore, antihypertensive effects in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) also revealed that oral administration of -Glu-Leu-Tyr-Pro can decrease systolic blood pressure significantly (p<0.01). These results suggest that the -Glu-Leu-Tyr-Pro would be a beneficial ingredient for nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals acting against hypertension and its related diseases.Crown Copyright © 2013.

Pigs were fed 4 diets for 2 periods in a crossover design. Within each period, there were 4 blocks of 4 pigs per block with each diet represented within each block. The average initial BW in periods 1 and 2 were 22 and 30 kg, respectively. Each period lasted 9 d with fecal collection on d 5 and 6 and a 12-h ileal digesta collection on d 7, 8, and 9. Pigs received a daily feed allowance of approximately 4.5% of their BW. The experimental diets were based on corn, soybean meal, wheat middlings, and corn distillers dried grain with solubles. Phytase was added at 0; 500; 1,000; or 2,000 phytase units/kg of diet to a basal diet that contained 205, 15, 5.4, and 10 g of CP, , total P (1.6 g of nonphytate P), and Ca/kg diet, respectively. The addition of phytase improved (P < 0.05) AID of DM, N, Ca, and P. Increasing phytase supplementation linearly and quadratically increased (P < 0.05) AID of P and Ca, respectively, with AID of Ca showing a tendency for a linear increase (P = 0.053). Phytase supplementation of the basal diet improved (P < 0.05) AID of P from 46 to 62%. Phytase supplementation increased (P < 0.05) ATTD of DM, N, Ca, P, Mg, K, and energy. Contrasts showed that phytase supplementation of the basal diet increased (P < 0.05) AID for 8 indispensable AA (Arg, His, Ile, Leu, , , Thr, and ), 6 dispensable AA (Ala, Asp, Cys, Glu, Ser, and Tyr), as well as for total AA. Furthermore, phytase supplementation to the basal diet showed a tendency (P < 0.10) to increase ileal digestibility of Gly. Ileal digestibility of Met, Trp, and Pro were not affected by phytase supplementation. Increasing the level of phytase supplementation resulted in linear increases (P < 0.05) in AID of 6 indispensable AA (Arg, Ile, Leu, , , and ) and 1 dispensable AA (Asp) with 4 AA (His, Cys, Glu, and Tyr) showing a tendency for linear increase (P < 0.10) in AID of AA. The results from this study showed that in addition to increasing P and Ca utilization, the new Buttiauxella 6-phytase expressed in Trichoderma reesei enhanced ileal digestibility of N and several AA in growing pigs in a dose-dependent manner.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559291>Retinal degeneration 3 (RD3) protein, a retinal guanylyl cyclase regulator, forms a monomeric and elongated four-helix bundle.</a></h2><p>Retinal degeneration 3 (RD3) protein promotes accumulation of retinal membrane guanylyl cyclase (RetGC) in the photoreceptor outer segment and suppresses RetGC activation by guanylyl cyclase-activating proteins (GCAPs). Mutations truncating RD3 cause severe congenital blindness by preventing the inhibitory binding of RD3 to the cyclase. The high propensity of RD3 to aggregate in solution has prevented structural analysis. Here, we produced a highly soluble variant of human RD3 (residues 18-160) that is monomeric and can still bind and negatively regulate RetGC. The NMR solution structure of RD3 revealed an elongated backbone structure (70 Å long and 30 Å wide) consisting of a four-helix bundle with a long unstructured loop between helices 1 and 2. The structure reveals that RD3 residues previously implicated in the RetGC binding map to a localized and contiguous area on the structure, involving a loop between helices 2 and 3 and adjacent parts of helices 3 and 4. The NMR structure of RD3 was validated by mutagenesis. Introducing Trp or  to replace Cys or Leu, respectively, disrupts packing in the hydrophobic core and lowers RD3's apparent affinity for RetGC1. Introducing a positive charge at the interface (Glu to ) also lowered the affinity. Conversely, introducing  in place of Cys stabilized the hydrophobic core and increased the RD3 affinity for the cyclase. The NMR structure of RD3 presented here provides a structural basis for elucidating RD3-RetGC interactions relevant for normal vision or blindness.© 2019 Peshenko et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27694331>A Role for Human N-alpha Acetyltransferase 30 (Naa30) in Maintaining Mitochondrial Integrity.</a></h2><p>N-terminal acetylation (Nt-acetylation) by N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs) is one of the most common protein modifications in eukaryotes. The NatC complex represents one of three major NATs of which the substrate profile remains largely unexplored. Here, we defined the in vivo human NatC Nt-acetylome on a proteome-wide scale by combining knockdown of its catalytic subunit Naa30 with positional proteomics. We identified 46 human NatC substrates, expanding our current knowledge on the substrate repertoire of NatC which now includes proteins harboring Met-Leu, Met-Ile, Met-, Met-Trp, Met-, Met-Met, Met-His and Met- N termini. Upon Naa30 depletion the expression levels of several organellar proteins were found reduced, in particular mitochondrial proteins, some of which were found to be NatC substrates. Interestingly, knockdown of Naa30 induced the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and fragmentation of mitochondria. In conclusion, NatC Nt-acetylates a large variety of proteins and is essential for mitochondrial integrity and function.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25726107>Short communication: Evaluation of amino acid consumption and necessary profiles of Streptococcus thermophilus T1C2 in controlled pH batch fermentations.</a></h2><p>The objective of the present study was to elucidate the relationship between amino acid consumption and necessary profiles of Streptococcus thermophilus T1C2 to guide the design of media for high-cell-density culture. The amino acid consumption and necessary patterns of S. thermophilus T1C2 were investigated in the complete chemically defined medium. For amino acid consumption profiles throughout the growth of S. thermophilus T1C2, the most abundantly consumed amino acids were Gln and Arg, which accounted for 19 and 20% of total amino acids consumed, respectively. Asparagine, Thr, Ser, Ala, , Met, Leu, and , consumptions of which ranged from 3 to 10% of total amino acids consumed, were the second most intensively consumed amino acids. For necessary amino acid patterns, the amount of Cys, which counted for 11% of total amino acids needed, was significantly higher than the amounts required for other amino acids in growth of S. thermophilus T1C2. The necessary amounts of Asp, Asn, Glu, Gln, Arg, Ala, Met, and Tyr ranked second, ranging from 5 to 8% of total amino acids needed. Compared with necessary amounts, the consumption of Asn, Thr, Ser, Gln, Arg, Ala, , Leu, , His, and  exceeded the necessary amounts for growth of S. thermophilus T1C2 remarkably. Consumption of Gly, Met, Ile, Trp, and Pro was slightly higher than the necessary amounts. Consumption of Asp, Glu, Tyr, and Cys was lower than the necessary amounts. The overall consumption of amino acids exceeded the required amount for growth of S. thermophilus T1C2 almost 2.43 times, which implied a significant nitrogen wasting.Copyright © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.

The very N-terminal amino acid sequence largely determines whether or not a given protein is Nt-acetylated. Currently, there are six distinct NATs characterized, NatA-NatF, in humans of which the in vivo substrate specificity of Naa50 (Nat5)/NatE, an alternative catalytic subunit of the human NatA, so far remained elusive. In this study, we quantitatively compared the Nt-acetylomes of wild-type yeast S. cerevisiae expressing the endogenous yeast Naa50 (yNaa50), the congenic strain lacking yNaa50, and an otherwise identical strain expressing human Naa50 (hNaa50). Six canonical yeast NatA substrates were Nt-acetylated less in yeast lacking yNaa50 than in wild-type yeast. In contrast, the ectopically expressed hNaa50 resulted, predominantly, in the Nt-acetylation of N-terminal Met (iMet) starting N-termini, including iMet-, iMet-, iMet-Ala, iMet-Tyr, iMet-, iMet-Leu, iMet-Ser, and iMet-Thr N-termini. This identified hNaa50 as being similar, in its substrate specificity, to the previously characterized hNaa60/NatF. In addition, the identification, in yNaa50-lacking yeast expressing hNaa50, of Nt-acetylated iMet followed by a small residue such as Ser, Thr, Ala, or , revealed a kinetic competition between Naa50 and Met-aminopeptidases (MetAPs), and implied that Nt-acetylated iMet followed by a small residue cannot be removed by MetAPs, a deduction supported by our in vitro data. As such, Naa50-mediated Nt-acetylation may act to retain the iMet of proteins of otherwise MetAP susceptible N-termini and the fraction of retained and Nt-acetylated iMet (followed by a small residue) in such a setting would be expected to depend on the relative levels of ribosome-associated Naa50/NatA and MetAPs.© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

ARC1 and Exo70A1 function as the downstream targets of the S-locus receptor kinase and play conservative roles in Brassica SI signaling. Based on the sequence homology, Exo70A1 is divided into four subdomains: leucine zipper (Leu(128)-Leu(149)), hypervariable region (Ser(172)-Leu(197)), SUMO modification motif (Glu(260)-Ile(275)), and pfamExo70 domain (His(271)-(627)). ARC1 contains four domains as follows: leucine zipper (Leu(116)-Leu(137)), coiled-coil domain (Thr(210)-(236)), U-box (Asp(282)-Trp(347)) motif, and ARM (Ala(415)-Thr(611)) domain. Bioinformatics analysis, yeast two-hybrid screening and pull-down assays show that leucine zipper and coiled-coil motifs of ARC1116-236 are required for the interaction with Exo70A1, while the addition of ARM motif results in loss of the interaction with Exo70A1. Meanwhile, the N-terminal of Exo70A1 without any domains shows a weak interaction with ARC1, and the level of LacZ expression increases with addition of leucine zipper and reaches the maximum value with hypervariable region and SUMO modification motif, indicating that hypervariable region and SUMO modification motif of Exo70A1172-275 is mainly responsible for the binding with ARC1, whereas pfamExo70 domain has little affinity for ARC1. (181) located in the Exo70A1 hypervariable region may be the ubiquitination site mediating the interaction between ARC1 and Exo70A1. Therefore, both the leucine zipper with coiled-coil structure of ARC1116-236, and the hypervariable region and SUMO modification motif of Exo70A1172-275 are the core interaction domains between ARC1 and Exo70A1. Any factors affecting these core domains would be the regulators of ARC1 mediating ubiquitin degradation in self-incompatible system.© The Author 2016.
