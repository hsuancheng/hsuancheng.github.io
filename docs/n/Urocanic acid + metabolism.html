Rumen microorganisms were collected from fistulated goats fed with lucerne cubes (Medicago sativa) and a concentrate mixture twice a day. Microbial suspensions were anaerobically incubated with or without 2 mm each of His, or histamine (HTM), or 1 mm  (URA) at 39 degrees C for 12 h. His and other related compounds in both supernatant and microbial hydrolysates were analyzed by HPLC. After 6- and 12-h incubations, the net degradation of His was 26.1% and 51.7% in B, 13.5% and 20.9% in P, and 21.7% and 46.0% in BP, respectively. The rate of the net degradation of His in B (98.0 micromol/g microbial nitrogen/h) was about 2.6 times higher than that of P during a 12-h incubation period. His was found to be degraded into  (URA), imidazolelactic  (ImLA), imidazoleacetic  (ImAA), and histamine (HTM). Of these degraded His was mainly converted into URA in all microbial suspensions. The production of ImLA and ImAA was higher in B than in P suspensions, whereas the production of HTM was higher in P than in B suspensions. From these results, the existence of diverse catabolic routes of His in rumen microorganisms was indicated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20103135>Catalytic molecularly imprinted polymer membranes: development of the biomimetic sensor for phenols detection.</a></h2><p>Portable biomimetic sensor devices for the express control of phenols content in water were developed. The synthetic binding sites mimicking active site of the enzyme tyrosinase were formed in the structure of free-standing molecularly imprinted polymer membranes. Molecularly imprinted polymer membranes with the catalytic activity were obtained by co-polymerization of the complex Cu(II)-catechol- ethyl ester with (tri)ethyleneglycoldimethacrylate, and oligourethaneacrylate. Addition of the elastic component oligourethaneacrylate provided formation of the highly cross-linked polymer with the catalytic activity in a form of thin, flexible, and mechanically stable membrane. High accessibility of the artificial catalytic sites for the interaction with the analyzed phenol molecules was achieved due to addition of linear polymer (polyethyleneglycol Mw 20,000) to the initial monomer mixture before the polymerization. As a result, typical semi-interpenetrating polymer  (semi-IPNs) were formed. The cross-linked component of the semi-IPN was represented by the highly cross-linked catalytic molecularly imprinted polymer, while the linear one was represented by polyethyleneglycol Mw 20,000. Extraction of the linear polymer from the fully formed semi-IPN resulted in formation of large pores in the membranes' structure. Concentration of phenols in the analyzed samples was detected using universal portable device oxymeter with the oxygen electrode in a close contact with the catalytic molecularly imprinted polymer membrane as a transducer. The detection limit of phenols detection using the developed sensor system based on polymers-biomimics with the optimized composition comprised 0.063 mM, while the linear range of the sensor comprised 0.063-1 mM. The working characteristics of the portable sensor devices were investigated. Storage stability of sensor systems at room temperature comprised 12 months (87%). As compared to traditional methods of phenols detection the developed sensor system is characterized by simplicity of operation, compactness, and low cost.Copyright 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Filaggrin is a crucial epidermal protein that is important for the formation of the corneocyte, as well as the generation of its intracellular metabolites, which contribute to stratum corneum hydration and pH. The levels of filaggrin and its degradation products are influenced not only by the filaggrin genotype but also by inflammation and exogenous stressors. Pertinently, filaggrin deficiency is observed in patients with atopic dermatitis regardless of filaggrin mutation status, suggesting that the absence of filaggrin is a key factor in the pathogenesis of this skin condition. In this article we review the various causes of low filaggrin levels, centralizing the functional and morphologic role of a deficiency in filaggrin, its metabolites, or both in the etiopathogenesis of atopic dermatitis.Copyright © 2014 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

To investigate the impact of filaggrin deficiency on the skin barrier, filaggrin expression was knocked down by small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology in an organotypic skin model in vitro. Three different siRNAs each efficiently suppressed the expression of profilaggrin and the formation of mature filaggrin. Electron microscopy revealed that keratohyalin granules were reduced in number and size and lamellar body formation was disturbed. Expression of keratinocyte differentiation markers and the composition of lipids appeared normal in filaggrin-deficient models. The absence of filaggrin did not render keratins 1, 2, and 10 more susceptible to extraction by urea, arguing against a defect in aggregation. Despite grossly normal stratum corneum morphology, filaggrin-deficient skin models showed a disturbed diffusion barrier function in a dye penetration assay. Moreover, lack of filaggrin led to a reduction in the concentration of , and sensitized the organotypic skin to UVB-induced apoptosis. This study thus demonstrates that knockdown of filaggrin expression in an organotypic skin model reproduces epidermal alterations caused by filaggrin mutations in vivo. In addition, our results challenge the role of filaggrin in intermediate filament aggregation and establish a link between filaggrin and endogenous UVB protection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21792987>Metabolomic assessment with CE-MS of the nutraceutical effect of Cystoseira spp extracts in an animal model.</a></h2><p>There is a need of scientific evidence of claimed nutraceutical effects, but also there is a social movement towards the use of natural products and among them algae are seen as rich resources. Within this scenario, the development of methodology for rapid and reliable assessment of markers of efficiency and security of these extracts is necessary. The rat treated with streptozotocin has been proposed as the most appropriate model of systemic oxidative stress for studying antioxidant therapies. Cystoseira is a brown alga containing fucoxanthin and other carothenes whose pressure-assisted extracts were assayed to discover a possible beneficial effect on complications related to diabetes evolution in an acute but short-term model. Urine was selected as the sample and CE-TOF-MS as the analytical technique to obtain the fingerprints in a non-target metabolomic approach. Multivariate data analysis revealed a good clustering of the groups and permitted the putative assignment of compounds statistically significant in the classification. Interestingly a group of compounds associated to lysine glycation and cleavage from proteins was found to be increased in diabetic animals receiving vehicle as compared to control animals receiving vehicle (N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine, N-methylnicotinamide, galactosylhydroxylysine, L-carnitine, N6-acetyl-N6-hydroxylysine, fructose-lysine, pipecolic , , amino-isobutanoate, formylisoglutamine. Fructoselysine significantly decreased after the treatment changing from a 24% increase to a 19% decrease. CE-MS fingerprinting of urine has provided a group of compounds different to those detected with other techniques and therefore proves the necessity of a cross-platform analysis to obtain a broad view of biological samples.Copyright © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Ultraviolet (UV) irradition converts it to the cis-isomer that is an important mediator in UV-induced immunosuppression. We have recently shown that  interferes with the agonist binding to GABA(A) receptors. We now report that the effects of  on binding of a convulsant ligand (t-butylbicyclo[35S]phosphorothionate) to GABA(A) receptors in brain membrane homogenates are dependent on pH of the incubation medium, the agonistic actions being enhanced at the normal pH of the skin (5.5). Using Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing recombinant rat alpha1beta1gamma2S GABA(A) receptors, the low pH potentiated the direct agonistic action of trans- under two-electrode voltage-clamp, whereas cis- retained its low efficacy both at pH 5.5 and 7.4. The results thus indicate clear differences between  isomers in functional activity at one putative receptor site of immunosuppression, the GABA(A) receptor, the presence of which in the skin remains to be demonstrated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20376063>Is the filaggrin-histidine- pathway essential for stratum corneum acidification?</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23228301>Pathobiology of actinic keratosis: ultraviolet-dependent keratinocyte proliferation.</a></h2><p>Actinic keratoses are proliferations of transformed neoplastic keratinocytes in the epidermis that are the result of cumulative ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sun exposure. They are commonly found on sites of sun-exposed skin such as the face, balding scalp, and back of the hand. Although UV exposure does exert certain beneficial effects on the skin, excessive exposure to UV radiation induces multiple cascades of molecular signaling events at the cellular level that produce inflammation, immunosuppression, failure of apoptosis, and aberrant differentiation. Cumulatively, these actions result in mutagenesis and, ultimately, carcinogenesis. This article provides a brief overview of the key mediators that are implicated in the pathobiology of actinic keratosis. Three evolutionary possibilities exist for these keratoses in the absence of treatment: (1) spontaneous remission, which can be common; (2) remaining stable, without further progression; or (3) transformation to invasive squamous cell carcinoma, which may metastasize. Because the effects of UV radiation on the skin are complex, it is not yet fully clear how all of the mediators of actinic keratosis progression are interrelated. Nonetheless, some represent potential therapeutic targets, because it is clear that directing therapy to the effects of UV radiation at a number of different levels could interrupt and possibly reverse the mechanisms leading to malignant transformation.Copyright © 2012 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.

Here, we demonstrate in female inbred Skh:hr-1 mice that single subinflammatory UVA exposures between 1.61 and 580.5 kJ/m(2) are not immunosuppressive. Furthermore, UVA exposures between 16.13 and 580.5 kJ/m(2) provided dose-related immunoprotection against UVB-induced immunosuppression. Higher UVA exposures (870.8-1,161 kJ/m(2)) became inflammatory and immunosuppressive alone, and lost the photoimmunoprotective capacity. We previously reported that UVA photoimmunoprotection depends on the induction of cutaneous heme oxygenase-1, particularly its enzymatic product, carbon monoxide (CO). CO was suggested to activate cutaneous guanylyl cyclase (GC), as the specific GC inhibitor, 1H-(1,2,4)oxadiazolo-(4,3-a)quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), abrogated CO photoimmunoprotection in the mouse. This study shows that cutaneous cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) concentration increased only following immunoprotective UVA doses, or immunoprotective topical CO treatment, and cGMP production was inhibited by ODQ. Conversely, cGMP concentration was increased by inhibition of its degradative phosphodiesterase (PDE) with topical sildenafil. The PDE-5 isoform was identified in normal mouse skin. Subsequently, a moderate concentration of sildenafil was shown to simulate the effect of UVA in protecting against photoimmunosuppression by solar-simulated UV radiation or its mediator cis-. Thus, cutaneous cGMP, controlled by its synthesis via CO-activated GC and its degradation by PDE-5, is strongly associated with UVA photoimmunoprotection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29567364>Development of an analytical method for  isomers in fish based on reactive extraction cleanup and chaotropic chromatography techniques.</a></h2><p> (UA), existing in trans- or cis-isoform, is of fairly recent interest to food researchers because of its potential public health hazards of scombrotoxicity and immunotoxicity, as well as associating with fish spoilage. This work is among the first efforts to study the analytical chemistry of UA in fish. With 0.6 M perchloric  UA was extracted, and co-extracted fish matrix components were efficiently removed through a reactive extraction of UA. The optimum conditions for the reactive extraction, which allowed an 80% recovery of UA, were sample pH adjustment to 9, twice extractions with 32% (w/w) di (2-ethylhexyl) phosphate in hexanol, and a back-extraction with 0.1 M hydrochloric  at 1:1 phase ratio. A chaotropic hexafluorophosphate salt was added to acidic water-acetonitrile mobile phases to improve the reversed-phase chromatography of UA, which otherwise was poorly retained. Optimum separation conditions were obtained for fish samples and enabled a fast (10 min), convenient-to-use chromatography that clearly outperforms cumbersome legacy ion-pair chromatography. Intended for routine use in our laboratory, the proposed method passed an in-house validation test for linearity, matrix effect (on reactive extraction), accuracy, precision, and detectability.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

C-UA at 1 microg/ml significantly depleted mast cell chymase, whereas trans- (T-UA) was relatively ineffective. C-UA, but not T-UA, induced local effects of liberated mast cell TNF-alpha, as detected by E-selectin expression on the microvascular dermal endothelium. C-UA significantly reduced (>70%) the ear swelling response in Balb/c mice, when applied 24 h prior to application of a sensitizing amount of dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB), and induced a prolonged (>3 weeks) state of immune tolerance (>40%). Similar effects on local immunosuppression of CHR were observed with topical chloroquine and capsaicin, while cromolyn, a mast cell membrane stabilizer, was unable to inhibit DNCB-induced CHR.

We hypothesized that UOPs can mimic UV-induced systemic immunosuppression comparable to the suppressive properties already established for cis-UCA. A crude mixture of UOPs showed a significant suppression of the sensitization phase of the systemic contact hypersensitivity (CHS) response to picryl chloride (PCl). Three of the UOPs were selected for this study: imidazole-4-carboxylic  (ImCOOH), imidazole-4-carboxaldehyde (ImCHO) and imidazole-4-acetic  (ImAc). Effects on the sensitization, elicitation and postelicitation phases of CHS to PCl in BALB/c mice were studied and compared with the effects of cis-UCA. ImCHO was equally effective at suppressing the sensitization phase as cis-UCA. The triplet combination of the imidazoles (1:1:1) showed more pronounced suppression than that induced by cis-UCA. The most effective compounds for the suppression of the elicitation phase appeared to be ImAc and cis-UCA. Significant suppression of the postelicitation phase was only obtained with the triplet combination of ImCHO, ImCOOH and ImAc, the combination that appeared to be effective at all three tested phases. Because these three UOPs are present in UV-B-exposed human stratum corneum, these compounds may play a role in UV-B-induced immunosuppression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28005947> Disturbances in Adult-Onset Still's Disease Evaluated Using Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry-Based Metabolomic Analysis.</a></h2><p>Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS)-based comprehensive analysis of  profiles with metabolomics approach has potential diagnostic and predictive implications. However, no metabolomics data have been reported in adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD). This study investigated the metabolomic profiles in AOSD patients and examined their association with clinical characteristics and disease outcome.Serum metabolite profiles were determined on 32 AOSD patients and 30 healthy controls (HC) using ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)/MS analysis, and the differentially expressed metabolites were quantified using multiple reactions monitoring (MRM)/MS analysis in 44 patients and 42 HC. Pure standards were utilized to confirm the presence of the differentially expressed metabolites.Eighteen differentially expressed metabolites were identified in AOSD patents using LC/MS-based analysis, of which 13 metabolites were validated by MRM/MS analysis. Among them, serum levels of lysoPC(18:2),  and indole were significantly lower, and L-phenylalanine levels were significantly higher in AOSD patients compared with HC. Moreover, serum levels of lysoPC(18:2), PhePhe, uridine, taurine, L-threonine, and (R)-3-Hydroxy-hexadecanoic  were significantly correlated with disease activity scores (all p<0.05) in AOSD patients.

Isoflavonoids have documented antioxidant activity, but their mechanism of immunomodulation remains unclear. This study examines whether photoimmunoprotection by the isoflavonoids might result from their interaction with one cutaneous antioxidant known to modulate UV photodamage, metallothionein (MT). In mice bearing a null mutation for MT-I and -II, we found that immunoprotection by the isoflavonoid 4',7-dihydroxyisoflavane (equol) against solar-simulated UV radiation (SSUV) or exogenous cis- was abrogated. Topical equol did not activate MT expression in normal mouse skin, but markedly enhanced the increase in MT expression in murine epidermis following SSUV irradiation. Normal human skin, unlike murine, expressed MT in the basal epidermis. Following SSUV irradiation, topical application of the related synthetic isoflavonoid NV-07alpha to human skin also markedly enhanced epidermal MT expression. The NV-07alpha has been reported previously to protect humans against the UV suppression of Mantoux reactions. Thus, epidermal MT expression appears to protect against photoimmunosuppression in both human and mouse skin. We speculate that equol and its related derivative NV-07alpha may activate the MT gene synergistically with SSUV, to produce the enhanced immunoprotective effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24305948>Urocanate as a potential signaling molecule for bacterial recognition of eukaryotic hosts.</a></h2><p>Host recognition is the crucial first step in infectious disease pathogenesis. Recognition allows pathogenic bacteria to identify suitable niches and deploy appropriate phenotypes for successful colonization and immune evasion. However, the mechanisms underlying host recognition remain largely unknown. Mounting evidence suggests that urocanate-an intermediate of the histidine degradation pathway-accumulates in tissues, such as skin, and acts as a molecule that promotes bacterial infection via molecular interaction with the bacterial regulatory protein HutC. In Gram-negative bacteria, HutC has long been known as a transcriptional repressor of hut genes for the utilization of histidine (and urocanate) as sources of carbon and nitrogen. Recent work on the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and zoonotic pathogen Brucella abortus shows that urocanate, in conjunction with HutC, plays a significant role in the global control of cellular , cell motility, and expression of virulence factors. We suggest that in addition to being a valuable source of carbon and nitrogen, urocanate may be central to the elicitation of bacterial pathogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25581069>Immediate and extended effects of abrasion on stratum corneum natural moisturizing factor.</a></h2><p>Natural moisturizing factor (NMF), principally comprised of hygroscopic amino acids and derivatives that absorb moisture from the surrounding environment, serves as the primary humectant of the stratum corneum (SC). Acute barrier disruption has been shown to differentially affect the concentration of NMF in the SC. This study measured the recovery kinetics of NMF after mechanical damage of the SC, which is not well understood.The study population included 20 healthy female volunteers (18-72-year old) with no history of dermatological disorders. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL), erythema, and SC water and NMF were measured at all sites before abrasion, 30 min following abrasion, and 1-3, 6, 8, and 10 days following abrasion. Measurements obtained from the abraded site were compared with those obtained from an untreated site.As expected, both TEWL and erythema increased significantly with abrasion. Erythema and TEWL values remained higher at the abraded site for 2 and 6 days, respectively, after abrasion. No changes in NMF component levels in the SC were observed at 30 min after abrasion. One day following abrasion, reduced levels of glycine, histidine pH4, trans- (tUca) pH4, and tUca pH8 were observed. In addition, a significantly lower level of serine was observed at the abraded site 2 and 6 days following abrasion. Within 8 days after abrasion, these components returned to levels comparable to those observed in untreated skin. Throughout the study, no differences were observed in the level of water in the SC.These results demonstrate that acute barrier disruption induced by mechanical abrasion has relatively little impact on biochemical events responsible for NMF generation. Though reductions in certain NMF components were observed, abrasion had no measureable effect on SC water content over the duration of the study. This implies that the reduced NMF components may not contribute substantially to water retention in the SC. The reduced components belong to a group of NMF molecules thought to be principally derived through degradation of S-100 proteins in the epidermis. NMF components measured in this study that are derived from sweat and/or urea cycling were not impacted. These data imply that while abrasion elicits clinical signs of barrier disruption within the SC, effects on its biochemical constituents and ability to retain water are relatively minor.© 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Although its mechanism of action is similar to that of Taxol, its structure is distinct. A structure-activity profile of synthetic eleutherobin derivatives that have modifications at C3, C8 and C15 was undertaken to define the structural requirements for microtubule stabilization and cross-resistance in Taxol-resistant cell lines.The biological activity of five eleutherobin analogs was assessed using three techniques: (1) cytotoxicity and drug-resistance in three paired Taxol-sensitive and -resistant cell lines; (2) polymerization of microtubule protein in vitro in the absence of GTP and (3) induction of microtubule bundle formation in NIH3T3 cells.Eleutherobin had an IC50 value comparable to that of Taxol, whereas neoeleutherobin, which has a carbohydrate domain that is enantiomeric with that of the parent compound, was less cytotoxic and had 69% of the maximum microtubule polymerization ability of eleutherobin. Both of these compounds exhibited cross-resistance in MDRI-expressing cell lines. Removal or replacement of the C15 sugar moiety resulted in reduced microtubule polymerization and cytotoxicity compared to eleutherobin and loss of cross-resistance in the cell lines SKVLB and J7-T3-1.6, both of which express high levels of P-glycoprotein. By contrast, removal of the  group at C8 resulted in virtually complete abrogation of biological activity. The compound lost its ability to polymerize microtubules, and its cytotoxicity was reduced by a minimum of 2000-fold in lung carcinoma A549 cells.Removal or modification of the sugar moiety alters the cytotoxic potency of eleutherobin and its pattern of cross-resistance in Taxol-resistant cells, although such compounds retain a small percentage of the microtubule-stabilizing activity of eleutherobin. The N(1)-methylurocanic  moiety of eleutherobin, or perhaps some other substituent at the C8 position, is essential for Taxol-like activity.

In experimental systems, UV radiation immunosuppression is at least partially mediated through  (UCA), an UV radiation-absorbing molecule in the stratum corneum. We tested the hypothesis that genetic variation in the histidase gene (HAL), which catalyzes the formation of UCA in the skin, modifies risk of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in a population-based study (914 BCC, 702 SCC and 848 controls). We observed no evidence of a main gene effect for the HAL I439V polymorphism (rs7297245) and BCC or SCC. However, we found a HAL genotype-sunburn interaction in association with BCC (P for interaction = 0.040) and SCC (P for interaction = 0.018). A HAL genotype-SCC association was observed primarily among women (odds ratio = 1.5, 95% confidence interval 1.1-2.2), and among women, we found an interaction between HAL genotype and oral contraceptive use on SCC risk (P = 0.040). The variant HAL allele likewise appeared to modify the SCC risk associated with glucocorticoid steroid usage (P for interaction = 0.0004). In conclusion, our findings are a first step in determining the genetic underpinnings of UV immune suppression and have identified important new genetic interactions contributing to the etiology of skin cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21921982>Cis- inhibits SAPK/JNK signaling pathway in UV-B exposed human corneal epithelial cells in vitro.</a></h2><p>The cornea is sensitive to ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation-induced oxidative stress and inflammation. Its clinical manifestations are photokeratitis and climatic droplet keratopathy.  (UCA) is a major endogenous UV-absorbing chromophore in the epidermis and it is also an efficacious immunosuppressant. We have previously shown that cis-UCA can suppress UV-B-induced interleukin-6 and -8 secretion and cytotoxicity in human corneal epithelium (HCE) cells. In the current study, we further wanted to investigate the effects of cis-UCA on UV-B-induced inflammatory and apoptotic responses in HCE-2 cells, focusing on the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and AP-1 (subunits c-Fos and c-Jun) signaling .After exposing HCE-2 cells to UV-B and cis-UCA, DNA binding of c-Fos, c-Jun and NF-κB was measured with ELISA. In addition, the endogenous levels of phosphorylated stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (phospho-SAPK/JNK) and phospho-c-Jun were determined. The proliferative capacity of HCE-2 cells was also quantified, and the cytotoxicity of the cis-UCA and UV-B treatments was monitored by measuring the release of lactate dehydrogenase enzyme in the culture medium.UV-B irradiation induced the binding of transcription factors c-Jun, c-Fos, and NF-κB to DNA. Cis-UCA inhibited the binding of c-Jun and c-Fos but not that of NF-κB. Moreover, UV-B increased the levels of phospho-c-Jun and phospho-JNK, and the expression of both was attenuated by cis-UCA. Cis-UCA also alleviated the UV-B-induced apoptosis and proliferative decline in human corneal cells.The results from this study suggest that cis-UCA suppresses JNK signaling pathway, which provides potential for treating UV-B-induced inflammatory defects in human corneal cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21997417>Cuts by caspase-14 control the proteolysis of filaggrin.</a></h2><p>Although mutations in the filaggrin gene (FLG) have been shown to be associated with ichthyosis vulgaris and atopic dermatitis, the function and regulation of filaggrin remain incompletely understood. In this issue, Hoste et al. report that filaggrin is directly cleaved by caspase-14. Acting in concert with other proteases, caspase-14 controls the breakdown of filaggrin to free amino acids and amino  derivatives that contribute to the hydration and UVB absorption capacity of the stratum corneum.

The authors examined the  effects of the cyanobacterial (blue-green algal) toxin microcystin-LR by (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis of urinary endogenous metabolites. Rats were treated with a single sublethal dose, either 20 or 80 µg/kg intraperitoneally, and sacrificed at 2 or 7 days post dosing. Changes in the high-dose, 2-day sacrifice group included centrilobular hepatic necrosis and congestion, accompanied in some animals by regeneration and neovascularization. By 7 days, animals had recovered, the necrotizing process had ended, and the centrilobular areas had been replaced by regenerative, usually hypertrophic hepatocytes. There was considerable interanimal variation in the histologic process and severity, which correlated with the changes in patterns of endogenous metabolites in the urine, thus providing additional validation of the biomarker and biochemical changes. Similarity of the shape of the  trajectories suggests that the mechanisms of toxic effects and recovery are similar among the individual animals, albeit that the magnitude and timing are different for the individual animals. Initial decreases in urinary citrate, 2-oxoglutarate, succinate, and hippurate concentrations were accompanied by a temporary increase in betaine and taurine, then creatine from 24 to 48 hours. Further changes were an increase in guanidinoacetate, dimethylglycine, , and bile acids. As a tool, urine can be repeatedly and noninvasively sampled and metabonomics utilized to study the onset and recovery after toxicity, thus identifying time points of maximal effect. This can help to employ histopathological examination in a guided and effective fashion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21455490>Histidine protects against zinc and nickel toxicity in Caenorhabditis elegans.</a></h2><p>Zinc is an essential trace element involved in a wide range of biological processes and human diseases. Zinc excess is deleterious, and animals require mechanisms to protect against zinc toxicity. To identify genes that modulate zinc tolerance, we performed a forward genetic screen for Caenorhabditis elegans mutants that were resistant to zinc toxicity. Here we demonstrate that mutations of the C. elegans histidine ammonia lyase (haly-1) gene promote zinc tolerance. C. elegans haly-1 encodes a protein that is homologous to vertebrate HAL, an enzyme that converts histidine to . haly-1 mutant animals displayed elevated levels of histidine, indicating that C. elegans HALY-1 protein is an enzyme involved in histidine catabolism. These results suggest the model that elevated histidine chelates zinc and thereby reduces zinc toxicity. Supporting this hypothesis, we demonstrated that dietary histidine promotes zinc tolerance. Nickel is another metal that binds histidine with high affinity. We demonstrated that haly-1 mutant animals are resistant to nickel toxicity and dietary histidine promotes nickel tolerance in wild-type animals. These studies identify a novel role for haly-1 and histidine in zinc  and may be relevant for other animals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11583543>A TD-DFT study of the photochemistry of  in biologically relevant ionic, rotameric, and protomeric forms.</a></h2><p>The photochemistry of , a chromophore present in human skin and linked to photoimmunosuppression and skin cancer, is investigated theoretically by means of time-dependent density functional theory. Extensive calculations are carried out for different ionic, rotameric, and protomeric forms of both the trans and cis form. Inclusion of solvation effects, here accounted for by means of a continuum solvent model, are found to be crucial for the correct description of the biologically relevant zwitterionic forms of the molecule. For the trans zwitterionic form, it is found that the planar form usually assumed in the literature is not stable, and that a realistic charge separation cannot be achieved in the gas phase. Calculated vertical excitation energies are in excellent agreement with available experimental data, with a weakly absorbing n --> pi transition around 4.0 eV, and strongly absorbing pi --> pi transitions at 4.5-4.9 eV. The debated intramolecular hydrogen bond is predicted to have a modest impact on the vertical spectra in solution, but improves agreement with experiment when included. In general, we also predict that different rotameric forms have very similar absorption spectra. In addition, we find a candidate absorbing state to link trans- to singlet oxygen production and subsequent photoaging of the skin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22530016>Expression of VjbR under nutrient limitation conditions is regulated at the post-transcriptional level by specific acidic pH values and .</a></h2><p>VjbR is a LuxR homolog that regulates transcription of many genes including important virulence determinants of the facultative intracellular pathogen Brucella abortus. This transcription factor belongs to a family of regulators that participate in a cell-cell communication process called quorum sensing, which enables bacteria to respond to changes in cell population density by monitoring concentration of self produced autoinducer molecules. Unlike almost all other LuxR-type proteins, VjbR binds to DNA and activates transcription in the absence of any autoinducer signal. To investigate the mechanisms by which Brucella induces VjbR-mediated transcriptional activation, and to determine how inappropriate spatio-temporal expression of the VjbR target genes is prevented, we focused on the study of expression of vjbR itself. By assaying different parameters related to the intracellular lifestyle of Brucella, we identified a restricted set of conditions that triggers VjbR protein expression. Such conditions required the convergence of two signals of different nature: a specific pH value of 5.5 and the presence of , a metabolite involved in the connection between virulence and  of Brucella. In addition, we also observed an , pH-dependent expression of RibH2 and VirB7, two additional intracellular survival-related proteins of Brucella. Analysis of promoter activities and determination of mRNA levels demonstrated that the -dependent mechanisms that induced expression of VjbR, RibH2, and VirB7 act at the post-transcriptional level. Taken together, our findings support a model whereby Brucella induces VjbR-mediated transcription by modulating expression of VjbR in response to specific signals related to the changing environment encountered within the host.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26152150>pH Gradient Reversal: An Emerging Hallmark of Cancers.</a></h2><p>Several tumors exhibit pH gradient reversal, with acidification of extracellular pH (pHe) and alkalinization of intracellular pH (pHi). The pH gradient reversal is evident even during the preliminary stages of tumorigenesis and is crucial for survival and propagation of tumors, irrespective of their pathology, genetics and origins. Moreover, this hallmark seems to be present ubiquitously in all malignant tumors. Based on these facts, we propose a new emerging hallmark of cancer "pH gradient reversal". Normalizing pH gradient reversal through inhibition of various proton transporters such as Na(+)-H(+) exchanger (NHE), Vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase), H(+)/K(+)-ATPases and carbonic anhydrases (CAs) has demonstrated substantial therapeutic benefits. Indeed, inhibition of NHE1 is now being regarded as the latest concept in cancer treatment. A recent patent deals with the utilization of cis- to acidify the pHi and induce apoptosis in tumors. Another patent reports therapeutic benefit by inhibiting Lactate Dehydrogenase - 5 (LDH-5) in various cancers. Several patents have been formulated by designing drugs activated through acidic pHe providing a cancer specific action.

Up to 50% of patients with moderate-to-severe AD in European populations have FLG-null alleles compared with a general population frequency of 7% to 10%.This study aimed to investigate the relationship between FLG-null mutations and epidermal antigen-presenting cell (APC) maturation in subjects with and without AD. Additionally, we investigated whether the cis isomer of  (UCA), a filaggrin breakdown product, exerts immunomodulatory effects on dendritic cells.Epidermal APCs from nonlesional skin were assessed by using flow cytometry (n = 27) and confocal microscopy (n = 16). Monocyte-derived dendritic cells from healthy volunteers were used to assess the effects of cis- and trans-UCA on dendritic cell phenotype by using flow cytometry (n = 11).Epidermal APCs from FLG-null subjects had increased CD11c expression. Confocal microscopy confirmed this and additionally revealed an increased number of epidermal CD83(+) Langerhans cells in FLG-null subjects. In vitro differentiation in the presence of cis-UCA significantly reduced costimulatory molecule expression on monocyte-derived dendritic cells from healthy volunteers and increased their ability to induce a regulatory T-cell phenotype in mixed lymphocyte reactions.We show that subjects with FLG-null mutations have more mature Langerhans cells in nonlesional skin irrespective of whether they have AD. We also demonstrate that cis-UCA reduces maturation of dendritic cells and increases their capacity to induce regulatory T cells, suggesting a novel link between filaggrin deficiency and immune dysregulation.Copyright © 2016 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

Skin cancer is the most common form of human neoplasia. Estimates suggest that in excess of 1.5 million new cases of skin cancer (www.cancer.org/statistics) will be diagnosed in the United States this year. Fortunately, because of their highly visible location, skin cancers are more rapidly diagnosed and more easily treated than other types of cancer. Be that as it may, approximately 10,000 Americans a year die from skin cancer, and the cost of treating skin cancer in the United States (both melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer) is estimated to be in excess of $2.9 billion a year. In addition to causing skin cancer, UV radiation is also immune suppressive. In fact, data from studies with both experimental animals and biopsy proven skin cancer patients suggest that there is an association between the immune suppressive effects of UV radiation and its carcinogenic potential. Recent studies in my laboratory have focused on understanding the initial molecular events that induce immune suppression. We made two novel observations: first UV-induced keratinocyte-derived platelet activating factor plays a role in the induction of immune suppression. Second, cis-, a skin-derived immunosuppressive compound mediates immune suppression by binding to serotonin receptors on target cells. Recent findings suggest that blocking the binding of these compounds to their receptors not only inhibits UV-induced immune suppression but it also interferes with skin cancer induction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27362712>The effect of epidermal levels of  on 25-hydroxyvitamin D synthesis and inflammatory mediators upon narrowband UVB irradiation.</a></h2><p> (UCA) absorbs ultraviolet (UV)B radiation in the epidermis which may interfere with phototherapy. Therefore, the influence of individual levels of UCA on immune reactivity and vitamin D synthesis induced by narrowband UVB radiation was assessed.Twenty-eight subjects with irritant contact dermatitis of the hands were irradiated with suberythemal doses of narrowband UVB radiation on their unaffected lower forearms on three consecutive days. Stratum corneum tape strips and epidermal interstitial fluid (ISF) as well as blood samples were analyzed.Narrowband UVB irradiation led to the conversion of trans-UCA into its cis-isomer in the epidermis. The observed increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum concentrations was inversely correlated with the baseline levels of trans-UCA. Furthermore, UVB irradiation induced significant changes in the levels of CXCL10/IP-10, CCL2/MCP-1, CCL4/MIP-1β, and the IL-1RA/IL-1α ratio. The levels of IL-1α and CXCL9/MIG showed a trend toward increase. The changes in the levels of inflammatory and immunomodulatory mediators did not depend on baseline levels of trans-UCA.The results suggest that epidermal levels of trans-UCA affect vitamin D synthesis, but not cutaneous immune reactivity upon repeated exposure to suberythemal doses of narrowband UVB radiation. However, this requires further exploration.© 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The results indicated that PAEP was able to condense DNA into complex nanoparticles with the size around 120 nm at the polymer/DNA ratio (N/P) of 35, at which PAEP/DNA complex nanoparticles (PACNs) showed efficient transfection activity in complete medium. After conjugating with UA at the substitution degree of 7% (UA-PAEP7), UA-PAEP7/DNA complex nanoparticles (UP7CNs) exhibited higher transfection efficiency than PACNs and UA-PAEP25/DNA complex nanoparticles (UP25CNs) and much lower cytotoxicity compared with PEI/DNA complex nanoparticles (PEICNs). The transfection experiment using a proton pump inhibitor suggested that the gene expression of PACNs and UP-PAEP/DNA complex nanoparticles (UPCNs) was dependent on the endosomal acidification process. The acetate solution (20 mM, pH5.7) improved the transfection activity of UP7CNs in HeLa and COS 7 cell lines, which was almost comparable to PEICNs at the N/P ratio of 35.

The anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects of cis-UCA were studied in ocular surface cell cultures exposed to UV-B irradiation.Human corneal epithelial cells (HCE-2) and human conjunctival epithelial cells (HCECs) were incubated with 10, 100, 1,000, and 5,000 microg/ml cis-UCA with and without a single UV-B irradiation dose. The concentrations of IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha in the culture medium and caspase-3 activity in the cell extract sampled were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cell viability was measured by the colorimetric MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyldiazol- 2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay.UV-B irradiation multiplied interleukin IL-6 and IL-8 secretion levels in HCE-2 cells and HCECs as analyzed with ELISA. Cell viability as measured by the MTT assay declined by 30%-50% in HCE-2 cells and by 20%-40% in HCECs after UV-B irradiation. Moreover, UV-B increased caspase-3 activity in both cell types as analyzed with ELISA. Treatment with 100 microg/ml cis-UCA completely suppressed IL-6 and IL-8 secretion, decreased caspase-3 activity, and improved cell viability against UV-B irradiation. No significant effects on IL-6 or IL-8 secretion, caspase-3 activity, or viability of the non-irradiated cells were observed with 100 microg/ml cis-UCA in both cell types. The 5,000 microg/ml concentration was toxic.These findings indicate that cis-UCA may represent a promising anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective treatment option to suppress UV-B-induced inflammation and cellular damage in human corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21412256>cis- enhances prostaglandin E2 release and apoptotic cell death via reactive oxygen species in human keratinocytes.</a></h2><p> (UCA) is a major UVR-absorbing skin molecule that undergoes trans to cis photoisomerization in the epidermis following UVR exposure. Murine studies have established that cis-UCA is an important mediator of UVR-induced immune suppression, but little is known about its signaling pathway. We have previously demonstrated that treatment of normal human epidermal keratinocytes with cis-UCA resulted in increased synthesis of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and cell death. Here, using immortalized human keratinocytes, we report that cis-UCA but not trans-UCA generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a dose-dependent manner and that the natural antioxidant α-tocopherol can reduce this ROS generation, subsequent PGE(2) release, and apoptotic cell death. Western blot analysis revealed that cis-UCA leads to a transient phosphorylation of EGFR as well as downstream mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38. Pharmacological inhibition of their activity attenuated PGE(2) release induced by cis-UCA. After transient activation, cis-UCA downregulated EGFR protein expression that corresponded to activation of caspase-3. In addition, pretreatment with α-tocopherol inhibited EGFR downregulation and caspase-3 activation induced by cis-UCA. These results suggest that cis-UCA exerts its effects on human keratinocytes via intracellular ROS generation that modulates EGFR signaling and subsequently induces PGE(2) synthesis and apoptotic cell death.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21142126>HILIC-UPLC-MS for exploratory urinary  profiling in toxicological studies.</a></h2><p>Hydrophilic interaction ultra performance liquid chromatography (HILIC-UPLC) permits the analysis of highly polar metabolites, providing complementary information to reversed-phase (RP) chromatography.

Repairing DNA damage, neutralizing the activity of cis-, and reversing oxidative stress abrogate UV-induced immune suppression and skin cancer induction, suggesting that DNA, UCA, and lipid photo-oxidation serve as UV photoreceptors. What is not clear is whether signaling through each of these different photoreceptors activates independent  to induce biological effects or whether there is a common checkpoint where these  converge. Here, we show that agents known to reverse photocarcinogenesis and photoimmune suppression, such as platelet-activating factor (PAF) and serotonin (5-HT) receptor antagonists, regulate DNA repair. Pyrimidine dimer repair was accelerated in UV-irradiated mice injected with PAF and 5-HT receptor antagonists. Nucleotide excision repair (NER), as measured by unscheduled DNA synthesis, was accelerated by PAF and 5-HT receptor antagonists. Injecting PAF and 5-HT receptor antagonists into UV-irradiated Xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group A-deficient mice, which lack the enzymes responsible for NER, did not accelerate photoproduct repair. Similarly, UV-induced formation of 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine was reduced by PAF and 5-HT receptor antagonists. We conclude that PAF and 5-HT receptor antagonists accelerate DNA repair caused by UV radiation, which prevents immune suppression and interferes with photocarcinogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23078170>Urocanate reductase: identification of a novel anaerobic respiratory pathway in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1.</a></h2><p>Interpretation of the constantly expanding body of genomic information requires that the function of each gene be established.

The inactivation of the enzyme results from its direct oxidation by the excited triplet RF in a Type-I-photosensitized reaction whose efficiency increases at low oxygen concentration. The addition of histidine to the system produced no change in the inactivation rate, discarding the participation of singlet oxygen in the reaction. On the other hand, the presence of UCA results in its bleaching, with a significant enhancement of RF-mediated inactivation of G6PD. Both the consumption of UCA and G6PD are faster at low oxygen concentrations. UCA also produced a decrease in the sensitizer photodecomposition yield. These results indicate that the enhancement of the RF-mediated G6PD inactivation observed in the presence of UCA is not a singlet oxygen-mediated process. It is proposed that UCA consumption and its effect on G6PD inactivation are due to a complex reaction sequence initiated by a direct oxidation of UCA by the excited sensitizer triplet. The oxidation of the semireduced flavin gives rise to reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsible for the increased rate of the process. This is supported by the protection afforded by several additives with ROS removal capacity: benzoate, superoxide dismutase and catalase.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18937775>In vivo evaluation of the protective capacity of sunscreen by monitoring  isomer in the stratum corneum using Raman spectroscopy.</a></h2><p> (UCA) is a major ultraviolet (UV) ray-absorbing component in the epidermis, and it isomerizes from the trans to the cis form upon exposure to UV radiation. Continuous measurement of UCA isomers in the skin at the same area is not available using conventional methods. This study aimed to evaluate the protective capacity of sunscreen by non-invasively monitoring the trans-UCA (t-UCA) amount in the stratum corneum (SC) by confocal Raman spectroscopy.In vivo Raman spectra of the skin at the cheek or volar forearm were obtained from 27 healthy Japanese volunteers of different ages (age range, 22-53 years) throughout a whole year using confocal Raman spectroscopy. Eighteen healthy male Japanese volunteers (age range, 25-52 years) were enrolled for the evaluation of the protective capacity of sunscreen. The concentration depth profile of t-UCA relative to keratin was calculated from the Raman spectra in the 400-2200 cm(-1) region. Then, the integrated amount within the depth of 0-12 mum was calculated, which represented the total amount of t-UCA in the SC.The integrated amount of t-UCA in the cheek skin was significantly lower than that in the volar forearm skin throughout a year. The amount of it in the volar forearm skin was significantly the lowest in summer, but not in the cheek skin. The amount of t-UCA decreased immediately after UV exposure even below 1 minimal erythema dose, remained low for 1 week, and gradually increased up to the initial level about 2 weeks after UV exposure. The decrease in the t-UCA amount was hindered by the application of sunscreen on the skin surface. There were no statistical differences in response to UV exposure between the erythema-positive and erythema-negative groups.The monitoring of the amount of t-UCA in the SC by confocal Raman spectroscopy is a good method to assess the efficacy of sun protective substances.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22225938>Variation in transport explains polymorphism of histidine and urocanate utilization in a natural Pseudomonas population.</a></h2><p>Phenotypic variation is a fundamental requirement for evolution by natural selection. While evidence of phenotypic variation in natural populations abounds, its genetic basis is rarely understood. Here we report variation in the ability of plant-colonizing Pseudomonas to utilize histidine, and its derivative, urocanate, as sole sources of carbon and nitrogen. From a population of 164 phyllosphere-colonizing Pseudomonas strains, 77% were able to utilize both histidine and urocanate (His(+) , Uro(+) ) as growth substrates, whereas the remainder could utilize histidine, but not urocanate (His(+) , Uro(-) ), or vice versa (His(-) , Uro(+) ). An in silico analysis of the hut locus, which determines capacity to utilize both histidine and urocanate, from genome-sequenced Pseudomonas strains, showed significant variation in the number of putative transporters. To identify transporter genes specific for histidine and urocanate, we focused on a single genotype of Pseudomonas fluorescens, strain SBW25, which is capable of utilizing both substrates. Site-directed mutagenesis, combined with [(3) H]histidine transport assays, shows that hutT(u) encodes a urocanate-specific transporter; hutT(h) encodes the major high-affinity histidine transporter; and hutXWV encodes an ABC-type transporter that plays a minor role in histidine uptake. Introduction of cloned copies of hutT(h) and hutT(u) from SBW25 into strains incapable of utilizing either histidine, or urocanate, complemented the defect, demonstrating a lack of functional transporters in these strains. Taken together our data show that variation in transport systems, and not in  genes, explains a naturally occurring phenotypic polymorphism.© 2012 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9813269>Inhibitory effects in vitro of S-[2-carboxy-1-(1H-imidazol-4-yl)ethyl]-glutathione, a proposed metabolite of L-histidine, on gamma-glutamyltransferase activity.</a></h2><p>A transfer of the gamma-glutamyl moiety of S-[2-carboxy-1-(1H-imidazol-4-yl)ethyl]glutathione (I), an adduct of glutathione and L-histidine metabolite , has been investigated by using gamma-glutamyltransferase preparation from bovine kidney. When an equimolar mixture of two diastereomers of compound I in a phosphate buffer was allowed to react with glycylglycine in the presence of the transferase, two diastereomers of N-[S-[2-carboxy-1-(1H-imidazol-4-yl)ethyl]-L-cysteinyl]glycine (II) were formed in the same yield with each other and this was accompanied by a formation of gamma-glutamylglycylglycine. Kinetics of compound I with the transferase indicated high affinity between the two materials, while the maximal reaction velocity of the gamma-glutamyl transfer was low. Effects of compound I in vitro on the transfer of gamma-glutamyl moiety of gamma-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide to glycylglycine with the transferase were also studied, and the results indicated that the transfer was suppressed by compound I based on its competitive and non-competitive inhibitions. These results suggest that little variation in reactivities of two diastereomers of compound I as the substrate is given by the difference in stereomerism of their asymmetric carbon atoms and that inhibitory effects of compound I on the catalytic action of the transferase is of sufficient physiological importance to decrease the degradation of natural gamma-glutamyl compounds, such as glutathione and its analogs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31207344>Lactobacillus sp. improved microbiota and metabolite profiles of aging rats.</a></h2><p>Aging is closely associated with altered gut function and composition, in which elderly were reported with reduced gut microbiota diversity and increased incidence of age-related diseases. Probiotics have been shown to exert beneficial health-promoting effects through modulation of intestinal microflora biodiversity, thus the effects of probiotics administration on D-galactose (D-gal) senescence-induced rat were evaluated based on the changes in gut microbiota and metabolomic profiles. Upon senescence induction, the ratio of Firmicutes/ Bacteroidetes was significantly lowered, while treatment with Lactobacillus helveticus OFS 1515 and L. fermentum DR9 increased the ratio at the phylum level (P < 0.05). Study on the genus level showed that L. paracasei OFS 0291 and L. helveticus OFS 1515 administration reduced Bacteroides, which are prominently opportunistic pathogens while L. fermentum DR9 treated rats promoted the proliferation of Lactobacillus compared to the aged rats (P < 0.05). Probiotics treatment did not alter fecal short-chain fatty  (SCFA) profile, but an increase in acetate was observed in the D-gal rats. The analysis of fecal water-soluble metabolites showed that D-gal induced senescence caused great impact on amino acids  such as , citrulline, cystamine and 5-oxoproline, which could serve as potential aging biomarkers. Treatment with probiotics ameliorated these metabolites in a strain-specific manner, whereby L. fermentum DR9 promoted antioxidative effect through upregulation of oxoproline, whereas both L. paracasei OFS 0291 and L. helveticus OFS 1515 restored the levels of reducing sugars, arabinose and ribose similar to the young rats. D-gal induced senescence did cause significant immunological alteration in the colon of aged rats however, all probiotic strains demonstrated immunomodulatory properties as L. paracasei OFS 0291, L. helveticus OFS 1515 and L. fermentum DR9 alleviated proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-1β as well as IL-4 compared to the aged control (P < 0.05).

One of the major challenges for biomedical Raman spectroscopy is the removal of intrinsic autofluorescence background signals, which are usually a few orders of magnitude stronger than those arising from Raman scattering. A number of methods have been proposed for fluorescence background removal including excitation wavelength shifting, Fourier transformation, time gating, and simple or modified polynomial fitting. The single polynomial and the modified multi-polynomial fitting methods are relatively simple and effective, and thus are widely used in biological applications. However, their performance in real-time in vivo applications and low signal-to-noise ratio environments is sub-optimal. An improved automated algorithm for fluorescence removal has been developed based on modified multi-polynomial fitting, but with the addition of (1) a peak-removal procedure during the first iteration, and (2) a statistical method to account for signal noise effects. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach improves the automated rejection of the fluorescence background during real-time Raman spectroscopy and for in vivo measurements characterized by low signal-to-noise ratios.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16908847>Estrogen receptor signaling protects against immune suppression by UV radiation exposure.</a></h2><p>The phytoestrogenic isoflavonoid equol is known to protect against solar-simulated UV radiation-induced inflammation, immunosuppression, and skin carcinogenesis. The mechanism may involve antioxidant actions, because equol not only is a radical scavenger but also enhances the induction of a relevant cutaneous antioxidant, metallothionein. However, this study in female hairless mice examined whether the estrogenicity of the isoflavonoid might be responsible. Protection by topically applied equol against photoimmune suppression was found to be strongly and dose-dependently inhibited by the estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist ICI 182,780. Furthermore, ICI 182,780 alone was found to significantly exacerbate immunosuppression resulting from solar-simulated UV radiation irradiation, suggesting a natural role for the ER in photoimmune protection. In support of this role, topical application of the physiological ligand 17-beta-estradiol also provided dose-dependent photoimmune protection, inhibitable by ICI 182,780, that was attributed largely to the inactivation of the downstream actions of cis-, an important endogenous immunosuppressive photoproduct. Thus, a hitherto unrecognized function of the ER as a normal photoprotective immune regulator in the skin was revealed. The relationship between equol and cutaneous metallothionein suggests an association of the ER with this inducible antioxidant in constraining the photoimmune-suppressed state and therefore in the prevention of the facilitation of photocarcinogenesis by this immunological defect. This role for the ER may underlie important gender-specific differences in UV-responsiveness that would reflect different needs for environmental photoprotection in males and females.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19304569>Mutations in the urocanase gene UROC1 are associated with  aciduria.</a></h2><p>Urocanase is an enzyme in the histidine pathway encoded by the UROC1 gene. This report describes the first putative mutations, p.L70P and p.R450C, in the coding region of the UROC1 gene in a girl with  aciduria presenting with mental retardation and intermittent ataxia. Computed (in silico) predictions, protein expression studies and enzyme activity assays suggest that none of the mutations can produce a fully functional enzyme. The p.L70P substitution, which probably implies the disruption of an alpha-helix in the N-terminus, would alter its properties and therefore, its function. The p.R450C change would render impossible any interaction between urocanase and its substrate and would loss its enzyme activity. Consequently, these studies suggest that both mutations could alter the correct activity of urocanase, which would explain the clinical and biochemical findings described in this patient.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20520626>Protodynamic intracellular acidification by cis- promotes apoptosis of melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo.</a></h2><p>The extracellular tumor microenvironment is acidified, whereas the intracellular pH of tumor and stromal cells is neutral. cis- (cis-UCA), an endogenous compound of the skin, can acidify the cytosol by transporting protons into the cells. This phenomenon, termed the protodynamic concept, was studied here in human cancer cells. cis-UCA dose-dependently reduced the number of viable human melanoma, cervical carcinoma, and fibrosarcoma cells at weakly acidic extracellular pH. The intracellular pH decreased by up to 0.5 pH units in a concentration-dependent manner with 0.3-30  m cis-UCA at extracellular pH 6.5 but not at pH 7.4. Under the same conditions, 30  mM cis-UCA induced annexin-V binding and activation of caspase-3 in A2058 melanoma cells as signs of apoptotic cell death. Finally, growth of human melanoma xenografts in SCID mice was suppressed by 60% following intratumoral injection of cis-UCA. Accordingly, the percentage of tumor necrosis and active caspase-3-immunopositive cells increased, whereas proliferation activity decreased. These results identify cis-UCA as an anticancer agent inhibiting melanoma growth by immediate intracellular acidification followed by apoptotic cell death in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9779251>Cis- down-regulates histamine-mediated activation of adenylate cyclase in the pig epidermis.</a></h2><p> (UCA), one of the skin's major components for absorbing UV radiation, is present naturally in the stratum corneum as a trans-isomer. On absorption of UVB radiation either in vitro or in the skin, UCA undergoes trans- to cis-isomerization in a dose-dependent manner. Although the mechanism by which cis-UCA suppresses immunity remains unelucidated, recent studies have indicated that cis-UCA appears to inhibit the induction of cyclic AMP in fibroblasts, which suggests that this molecule plays an active role in modifications to the skin. Here, we report that although neither trans-UCA nor cis-UCA increases cyclic AMP in the pig epidermis, cis-UCA actively down-regulates the increase of cyclic AMP induced by histamine. The effects of cis-UCA on the pig epidermis are revealed through the modulation of the effects caused by histamine. These findings suggest that in the pig epidermis, the initial biochemical and cellular event for UVB-induced immune suppression--that is, the step immediately following the isomerization of trans-UCA to cis-UCA--is down-regulation of cyclic AMP brought about by the activity of cis-UCA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24817485>Stratum corneum molecular mobility in the presence of natural moisturizers.</a></h2><p>The outermost layer of the skin, the stratum corneum (SC), is a lipid-protein membrane that experiences considerable osmotic stress from a dry and cold climate. The natural moisturizing factor (NMF) comprises small and polar substances, which like osmolytes can protect living systems from osmotic stress. NMF is commonly claimed to increase the water content in the SC and thereby protect the skin from dryness. In this work we challenge this proposed mechanism, and explore the influence of NMF on the lipid and protein components in the SC. We employ natural-abundance (13)C solid-state NMR methods to investigate how the SC molecular components are influenced by urea, glycerol, pyrrolidone carboxylic  (PCA), and  (UCA), all of which are naturally present in the SC as NMF compounds. Experiments are performed with intact SC, isolated corneocytes and model lipids. The combination of NMR experiments provides molecularly resolved qualitative information on the dynamics of different SC lipid and protein components. We obtain completely novel molecular information on the interaction of these NMF compounds with the SC lipids and proteins. We show that urea and glycerol, which are also common ingredients in skin care products, increase the molecular mobility of both SC lipids and proteins at moderate relative humidity where the SC components are considerably more rigid in the absence of these compounds. This effect cannot be attributed to increased SC water content. PCA has no detectable effect on SC molecular mobility under the conditions investigated. It is finally shown that the more apolar compound, UCA, specifically influences the mobility of the SC lipid regions. The present results show that the NMF components act to retain the fluidity of the SC molecular components under dehydrating conditions in such a way that the SC properties remain largely unchanged as compared to more hydrated SC. These findings provide a new molecular insight into how small polar molecules in NMF and skin care products act to protect the human skin from drying.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18173698>Molecular and cellular mechanisms of photocarcinogenesis.</a></h2><p>Skin cancer constitutes one of the most frequent types of malignancies in humans with rapidly increasing incidences almost worldwide. UVR is an essential risk factor for the development of premalignant as well as malignant skin lesions. In this context UVR can function as a complete carcinogen by inducing "UV signature" DNA mutations and by suppressing protective cellular antitumoral immune responses. UV-induced DNA damage can result in impaired cutaneous cell cycle control if cell cycle regulators, such as the p53 gene, are affected. Besides interfering with cell cycle control genes, UV-induced DNA damage can result in the release of interleukin-10, a cytokine with known immunosuppressive effects on T-helper(h)-1 cells. For the development of antitumoral immune responses antigen-specific activation of effector T cells by antigen-presenting cells (APC) is required. It was demonstrated that UVR can inhibit antigen presentation both directly and indirectly via the induction of suppressive cytokines. In addition, subsets of T cells are induced upon UVR, which can actively suppress major histocompatibility complex class I/II-restricted immune responses. These UV-induced regulatory T cells appear to belong to the CD4+CD25+ T cell lineage and can express the characteristic transcription factor Foxp3, which programs for suppressor function. In mice UV-induced regulatory T cells can control the development of UV-induced skin cancer. Peripheral regulatory T cells are maintained by the expression of B7 molecules and can be expanded by APC of the skin. Recently, epidermal expression of CD254 (RANKL) has been shown to connect UVR with the expansion of regulatory CD4+CD25+ T cells. In the following, new molecular and cellular mechanisms of UV-induced skin tumor development will be described and discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20393477>Common links among the  leading to UV-induced immunosuppression.</a></h2><p>In this issue, Sreevidya et al. demonstrate unexpected similarities in the downstream events of two molecular triggers of UV-induced immunosuppression. Both platelet-activating factor and cis- produced reactive oxygen species (ROS). Blocking both photoproducts reduced UV-induced genetic damage.

This flux was used to collect and identify the ionic species responsible for skin acidity. It was then found that: (i) pK of these proton donors (pK = 6.13 +/- 0.07) was quasi-identical to that of trans- (6.10), and (ii) the amount of  present in stratum corneum was sufficient in itself to explain the acidic level as measured with pH meter (R = 0.8484, n = 10, p = 0.00136). As a result, the contribution of other ionic species can be considered as negligible in normal human skin. The data recorded led us to identify three groups (Fast, Medium, and Slow) characterized by different skin surface pH values (low, medium, and close to neutral) and showing a pH gradient in the outer layers of the stratum corneum, or not. Data analysis suggests that these characteristics depend on  production rate within the stratum corneum and that this production rate is self-regulated by its  content.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14518047>Formation of S-[2-carboxy-1-(1H-imidazol-4-yl) ethyl]glutathione, a new metabolite of L-histidine, from cis- and glutathione by the action of glutathione S-transferase.</a></h2><p>Exposure of the skin to sunlight results in an increase of the content of epidermal trans-, a key metabolite of L-histidine, and also in occurrence of the isomerization of trans- to the cis isomer. S-[2-Carboxy-1-(1H-imidazol-4-yl)ethyl]glutathione (GS(CIE)), an adduct of  and glutathione, is a presumed origin of a urinary compound S-[2-carboxy-1-(1H-imidazol-4-yl)ethyl]-L-cysteine (Cys(CIE)). The formation of GS(CIE) is stimulated by exposing the skin to sunlight irradiation. In this study we investigated an enzymatic formation of GS(CIE) from glutathione and cis- by incubation with rat liver extract that contained glutathione S-transferase (GST) at high activity. The formation of GS(CIE) was suppressed significantly when a liver extract depleted of GST activity was used. Enzymatic degradation of GS(CIE) with gamma -glutamyl transpeptidase resulted in the formation of N-[S-[2-carboxy-1-(1H-imidazol-4-yl)ethyl]-L-cysteinyl]glycine, a  intermediate between the glutathione adduct and Cys(CIE). A hydrolyzed product of GS(CIE) by HCl was identical with the urinary Cys(CIE). Compounds were analyzed by high-voltage paper electrophoresis, capillary electrophoresis, and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. From these results, we suggest that GS(CIE) formed from cis- and glutathione is an origin of the urinary compound Cys(CIE) and that the formation reaction is catalyzed mostly by the action of GST.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24284985>Three randomised phase I/IIa trials of 5% cis- emulsion cream in healthy adult subjects and in patients with atopic dermatitis.</a></h2><p>New treatment modalities are needed in atopic dermatitis.

However, conventional in vivo noninvasive methods do not provide direct information about the depth profiles of water content or SC components that hold water.To study the depth profiles of water and SC components in vivo by Raman spectroscopy, and to analyse the changes due to age, anatomical location, season and water application.In vivo Raman spectra of the skin of the cheek and the volar forearm were obtained from 50 healthy Japanese volunteers of different ages (age range 22-76 years) with a confocal Raman spectrometer. The depth-dependent profiles of water and of SC water-binding components were calculated from the respective Raman spectra.The depth profile of the SC water content was observed in a pattern ranging from around 30% (water/wet tissue) at the outermost layer of the SC to about 70% at the deeper living layer. Although the water content at a depth of 10-30 microm in the forearm skin tended to be lower in older subjects than in younger subjects, no such difference was found in the much thinner SC of the cheek. Moreover, there was no seasonal difference in depth profile of water content from the mid part of the SC to an 80-microm depth from the skin surface both in the cheek and in the forearm. The water content of all the evaluated SC components showed a gradual decrease from the surface to deeper portions. The mean amounts of lactate in the forearm skin and cholesterol in the cheek skin were significantly higher in younger subjects than in older subjects. In contrast, the levels of free amino acids and trans- were higher in the forearm skin of older subjects than in younger subjects. The relative amounts of urea and lactate were the highest in summer, when that of trans- was the lowest. Prolonged water application on the forearm skin even for 90 min resulted in a remarkable increase in water content throughout the SC, even reaching the granular layer, which was only gradually released from the upper part of the SC after discontinuation of the hydration procedure.Our present findings suggest that changes in the concentration depth profiles of water, free amino acids and lipids in the skin depend on age, anatomical site and season. These findings indicate the important roles played by various water-holding substances in the SC in the regulation of SC water content.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12476016>Diffusion of E and Z  amphiphiles through skin and their insertion in a membrane model.</a></h2><p>The incorporation of synthetic  amphiphiles into a membrane model is described. A monomolecular film of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and cholesterol was formed at the air-water interface and used as a model. In parallel, diffusion of these derivatives through the skin was studied using rat skin on flow-through diffusion cells. The flux and the cumulative amount were determined. Although the structure and the composition of the DPPC/cholesterol monolayer differed greatly from multilayers of epidermal lipids, the results obtained in the incorporation and diffusion studies were similar. The structure of the  amphiphiles was very close, but the membranes led to the following flux or insertion classification: Ester E > Ester Z >> Amide E. From the results obtained and for simplicity, the technique of Langmuir monolayers seems to be highly suited to the primary screening of amphiphilic compounds.Copyright 2002 S.

A significant increase in cis-UCA levels was found in the skin of UVB-exposed volunteers compared with controls. cis-UCA levels, calculated as the percentage of the total UCA amount, in UVB-exposed volunteers correlated significantly with the cumulative UVB dose received in 5 consecutive days, i.e. the higher the UVB dose (J/m2), the higher the cis-UCA levels (until a cis-UCA plateau was reached in the so-called photostationary state). Correlations between skin cis-UCA levels and immune responses were determined, and they revealed no statistically significant correlations among lymphocyte proliferation responses after either mitogenic stimulation or stimulation with recall antigens. No correlation was found between cis-UCA levels and hepatitis B-specific antibody titers. However, we found a statistically significant negative correlation between cis-UCA levels and hepatitis B-specific lymphocyte proliferation responses when volunteers were irradiated with UVB before hepatitis B vaccination. In other words, volunteers with high cis-UCA levels caused by UVB exposure showed lower cellular immune responses against hepatitis B antigen after hepatitis B vaccination.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10898459>Histamine fish poisoning revisited.</a></h2><p>Histamine (or scombroid) fish poisoning (HFP) is reviewed in a risk-assessment framework in an attempt to arrive at an informed characterisation of risk. Histamine is the main toxin involved in HFP, but the disease is not uncomplicated histamine poisoning. Although it is generally associated with high levels of histamine (> or =50 mg/100 g) in bacterially contaminated fish of particular species, the pathogenesis of HFP has not been clearly elucidated. Various hypotheses have been put forward to explain why histamine consumed in spoiled fish is more toxic than pure histamine taken orally, but none has proved totally satisfactory. , like histamine, an imidazole compound derived from histidine in spoiling fish, may be the "missing factor" in HFP. cis- has recently been recognised as a mast cell degranulator, and endogenous histamine from mast cell degranulation may augment the exogenous histamine consumed in spoiled fish. HFP is a mild disease, but is important in relation to food safety and international trade. Consumers are becoming more demanding, and litigation following food poisoning incidents is becoming more common. Producers, distributors and restaurants are increasingly held liable for the quality of the products they handle and sell. Many countries have set guidelines for maximum permitted levels of histamine in fish. However, histamine concentrations within a spoiled fish are extremely variable, as is the threshold toxic dose. Until the identity, levels and potency of possible potentiators and/or mast-cell-degranulating factors are elucidated, it is difficult to establish regulatory limits for histamine in foods on the basis of potential health hazard. Histidine decarboxylating bacteria produce histamine from free histidine in spoiling fish. Although some are present in the normal microbial flora of live fish, most seem to be derived from post-catching contamination on board fishing vessels, at the processing plant or in the distribution system, or in restaurants or homes. The key to keeping bacterial numbers and histamine levels low is the rapid cooling of fish after catching and the maintenance of adequate refrigeration during handling and storage. Despite the huge expansion in trade in recent years, great progress has been made in ensuring the quality and safety of fish products. This is largely the result of the introduction of international standards of food hygiene and the application of risk analysis and hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) principles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11231318>In vivo confocal Raman microspectroscopy of the skin: noninvasive determination of molecular concentration profiles.</a></h2><p>Confocal Raman spectroscopy is introduced as a noninvasive in vivo optical method to measure molecular concentration profiles in the skin. It is shown how it can be applied to determine the water concentration in the stratum corneum as a function of distance to the skin surface, with a depth resolution of 5 microm. The resulting in vivo concentration profiles are in qualitative and quantitative agreement with published data, obtained by in vitro X-ray microanalysis of skin samples. Semi-quantitative concentration profiles were determined for the major constituents of natural moisturizing factor (serine, glycine, pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic , arginine, ornithine, citrulline, alanine, histidine, ) and for the sweat constituents lactate and urea. A detailed description is given of the signal analysis methodology that enables the extraction of this information from the skin Raman spectra. No other noninvasive in vivo method exists that enables an analysis of skin molecular composition as a function of distance to the skin surface with similar detail and spatial resolution. Therefore, it may be expected that in vivo confocal Raman spectroscopy will find many applications in basic and applied dermatologic research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24134186>Galectin-7, induced by cis- and ultraviolet B irradiation, down-modulates cytokine production by T lymphocytes.</a></h2><p> (UCA) is an epidermal chromophore that undergoes trans to cis isomerization after UVB irradiation. cis-UCA is a potent inhibitor of cutaneous acquired immunity. The aim of this study was to explore the genes, which are upregulated by cis-UCA in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) and investigated its role in vitro using human T-lymphocyte cell line, Jurkat cells. DNA microarray analysis and real-time PCR investigation revealed that cis-UCA, not trans-UCA, increased the expression of a gene encoding a β-galactoside-binding lectin, galectin-7, LGALS7B. Immunohistochemical study demonstrated that galectin-7 was highly expressed in the epidermis in the patients with actinic keratosis. Galectin-7 administration upregulated apoptosis and inhibited the expression of interleukin-2 (IL2) and interferon-γ (IFNG) mRNA in Jurkat cells. Taken together, galectin-7 may play important roles in downregulating the functions of T lymphocytes after UVB irradiation and can be developed into novel immunosuppressive therapies for inflammatory skin diseases.© 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

However, such exposure to UVA radiation has been observed unexpectedly to induce resistance to UVB-induced immunosuppression in mice, by a mechanism resulting in the inactivation of cis- (UCA), an epidermal immunosuppressive UV photoproduct. In this study in mice, we show that the immunoprotective activity of UVA radiation, against the effects of both UVB radiation and cis-UCA, can be attributed to the induction of cutaneous heme oxygenase (HO; EC 1.14.99.3). Cell-mediated immune function was assessed in vivo by the contact hypersensitivity response induced to oxazolone at an unirradiated skin site, and HO enzyme activity was measured in cutaneous microsomal preparations from treated mice. There was a progressive increase in HO enzyme activity for at least 3 days after UVA irradiation. However HO activity, both constitutive and UVA radiation-induced, was sensitive to the effects of injecting mice with the specific HO inhibitor, tin protoporphyrin (Sn [IV] protoporphyrin IX; SnPP). We observed, in addition, that in SnPP-injected mice, the immunoprotective effect of UVA radiation against either UVB radiation or cis-UCA was abrogated. Because SnPP injection did not affect normal contact hypersensitivity responsiveness but did inhibit the constitutive HO enzyme activity, it appeared that only the inducible HO was active in modulating immune function. This finding indicates that UVA-induced HO activity is a major player in the skin defenses against UVB immunosuppression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24627570>Pellagra and alcoholism: a biochemical perspective.</a></h2><p>Historical and clinical aspects of pellagra and its relationship to alcoholism are reviewed from a biochemical perspective. Pellagra is caused by deficiency of niacin (nicotinic ) and/or its tryptophan (Trp) precursor and is compounded by B vitamin deficiencies. Existence on maize or sorghum diets and loss of or failure to isolate niacin from them led to pellagra incidence in India, South Africa, Southern Europe in the 18th century and the USA following the civil war. Pellagra is also induced by drugs inhibiting the conversion of Trp to niacin and by conditions of gastrointestinal dysfunction. Skin photosensitivity in pellagra may be due to decreased synthesis of the Trp metabolite picolinic  → zinc deficiency → decreased skin levels of the histidine metabolite  and possibly also increased levels of the haem precursor 5-aminolaevulinic  (5-ALA) and photo-reactive porphyrins. Depression in pellagra may be due to a serotonin deficiency caused by decreased Trp availability to the brain. Anxiety and other neurological disturbances may be caused by 5-ALA and the Trp metabolite kynurenic . Pellagra symptoms are resolved by niacin, but aggravated mainly by vitamin B6. Alcohol dependence can induce or aggravate pellagra by inducing malnutrition, gastrointestinal disturbances and B vitamin deficiencies, inhibiting the conversion of Trp to niacin and promoting the accumulation of 5-ALA and porphyrins. Alcoholic pellagra encephalopathy should be managed with niacin, other B vitamins and adequate protein nutrition. Future studies should explore the potential role of 5-ALA and also KA in the skin and neurological disturbances in pellagra.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28833578>Loss-of- mutations in filaggrin gene and malignant melanoma: a case-control study.</a></h2><p>Loss-of- mutations in filaggrin gene (FLG) have been suggested to increase the susceptibility of skin malignancies due to reduced levels of epidermal filaggrin and its degradation products, , which may be protective against ultraviolet irradiation.We aimed to investigate the association between FLG mutation status and the occurrence of malignant melanoma (MM) in Danish adults.The prevalence of FLG mutations in a sample of MM biopsies was compared with a FLG-genotyped cohort from two general population studies. Pearson's chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare the two groups.A total of 867 MM biopsies and 9965 general population controls were genotyped, respectively. In the MM sample, two (0.23%) individuals were homozygous and 80 (9.4%) were heterozygous mutation carriers. In the general population controls, the prevalence of FLG mutations was 18 (0.18%) and 835 (8.4%) for homozygous and heterozygous mutations, respectively. Fisher's exact test and Pearson's chi-squared test yielded non-significant P-values when the groups were compared.FLG mutation was not associated with MM in the studied populations. This finding indicates that epidermal deficiency of filaggrin and its degradation products does not influence the risk of MM significantly.© 2017 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11714785>IL-12 prevents the inhibitory effects of cis- on tumor antigen presentation by Langerhans cells: implications for photocarcinogenesis.</a></h2><p>UV radiation induces skin cancer primarily by its DNA-damaging properties, but also by its capacity to suppress the immune system. The photoisomer of  (UCA), cis-UCA, is an important mediator of UV-induced immunosuppression and is involved in the inhibition of tumor immunity. The immunomodulatory cytokine IL-12 is known to counteract many of the immunosuppressive effects of UV radiation, including UV-induced immune tolerance. In this study, we addressed whether IL-12 also reverts the immunosuppressive activities of cis-UCA. Cis-UCA inhibits the ability of Langerhans cells to present tumor Ags for primary and secondary tumor immune responses. IL-12 treatment completely prevented the suppression by cis-UCA. IL-12 also protected mice from cis-UCA-induced suppression of contact hypersensitivity responses. To study the effects of cis-UCA on Ag-processing and Ag-presenting function in vitro, Langerhans cells were treated with UCA isomers and incubated with OVA or OVA peptide(323-339) before exposure to OVA-specific transgenic T cells. Cis-, but not trans-UCA suppressed Ag presentation, which was completely reversed upon addition of IL-12. Since these findings suggest that cis-UCA may play an important role in photocarcinogenesis by inhibiting a tumor immune response, mice were chronically UVB irradiated to induce skin cancer. Whereas all mice in the control groups developed tumors, mice treated with a mAb with specificity for cis-UCA showed a significantly reduced tumor incidence. These data strongly indicate the importance of cis-UCA during photocarcinogenesis and support the concept of counteracting cis-UCA as an alternative strategy to prevent UV-induced skin cancer, possibly via the application of IL-12.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9757593>The potential role for  and sunlight in the immune suppression associated with protein malnutrition.</a></h2><p>Irradiation of skin by sunlight or ultraviolet B (UVB, 290-320 nm) brings about a downregulation of cell-mediated immunity. An action spectrum for photoimmune suppression in mice indicates that trans- absorbs UV photons and is isomerized to the cis-isomer in the stratum corneum. Cis- is subsequently shown to suppress cellular immunity in mice. When histidine is elevated in a mouse diet, a higher level of  is detected in mouse skin. These mice are more susceptible to photoimmune suppression. There is evidence that humans and animals experiencing protein malnutrition have very high levels of  and/or histidine.  is formed by deamination of histidine in one enzymatic step. We discuss the protein malnutrition of kwashiorkor patients. They experience suppressed immunity and disturbed histidine . Here, we present a testable hypothesis: one cause of the immune deficiency observed in humans with protein malnutrition is the photoconversion by UVB of increased levels of trans- in skin to cis-, which suppresses the cellular immune system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27865021>Ligand binding specificity of the Escherichia coli periplasmic histidine binding protein, HisJ.</a></h2><p>The HisJ protein from Escherichia coli and related Gram negative bacteria is the periplasmic component of a bacterial ATP-cassette (ABC) transporter system. Together these proteins form a transmembrane complex that can take up L-histidine from the environment and translocate it into the cytosol. We have studied the specificity of HisJ for binding L-His and many related naturally occurring compounds. Our data confirm that L-His is the preferred ligand, but that 1-methyl-L-His and 3-methyl-L-His can also bind, while the dipeptide carnosine binds weakly and D-histidine and the histidine degradation products, histamine,  and imidazole do not bind. L-Arg, homo-L-Arg, and post-translationally modified methylated Arg-analogs also bind with reasonable avidity, with the exception of symmetric dimethylated-L-Arg. In contrast, L-Lys and L-Orn have considerably weaker interactions with HisJ and methylated and acetylated Lys variants show relatively poor binding. It was also observed that the carboxylate group of these amino acids and their variants was very important for proper recognition of the ligand. Taken together our results are a key step towards designing HisJ as a specific protein-based reagentless biosensor.© 2016 The Protein Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22404298>Editorial update on emerging treatments of atopic dermatitis.</a></h2><p>Various new agents are in the research pipeline for atopic dermatitis.

Ultraviolet B is known to suppress certain aspects of cell mediated immunity. Using three ultraviolet lamps (the broad-band ultraviolet B TL-12, the narrow-band ultraviolet B TL-01 and an ultraviolet AI source), we investigated the dose and waveband dependencies for the suppression of contact hypersensitivity to oxazolone and delayed-type hypersensitivity to herpes simplex virus, plus the formation of cis- in C3H/HeN mice. A single exposure of 1500 J/m2 TL-12 or 10,000 J/m2 TL-01 or 500,000 J/m2 ultraviolet AI corresponded to 1 minimum erythema dose in this mouse strain. The percentage of cis- of the total  rose from a background level of 1.7% to 40% with 1000 J/m2 TL-12 or 10,000 J/m2 TL-01, but only 17% cis- was obtained with 500,000 J/m2 ultraviolet AI. The contact hypersensitivity response was significantly suppressed after a minimum dose of 5000 J/m2 TL-12 or 50,000 J/m2 TL-01 or 500,000 J/m2 ultraviolet AI. The delayed-type hypersensitivity response was suppressed by a minimum dose of 100 J/m2 TL-12 or 10,000 J/m2 TL-01 or 1000 J/m2 ultraviolet AI. So, whereas a low dose of ultraviolet AI reduced the delayed-type hypersensitivity response, a 500-fold higher dose was required to suppress contact hypersensitivity. There was no correlation between the suppression of these responses and the concentration of cis- in the skin. Thus different mediators may modulate the various immune responses affected by ultraviolet exposure, depending on the wavelength of the radiation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17033005>Effect of cis- on bovine neutrophil generation of reactive oxygen species.</a></h2><p>Neutrophils play a fundamental role in the host innate immune response during mastitis and other bacterial-mediated diseases of cattle. One of the critical mechanisms by which neutrophils contribute to host innate immune defenses is through their ability to phagocytose and kill bacteria. The ability of neutrophils to kill bacteria is mediated through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the extracellular release of ROS can be deleterious to the host because ROS induce tissue injury. Thus, in diseases such as mastitis that are accompanied by the influx of neutrophils, the generation of large quantities of ROS may result in significant injury to the mammary epithelium. cis- (cis-UCA), which is formed from the UV photoisomerization of the trans isoform found naturally in human and animal skin, is an immunosuppressive molecule with anti-inflammatory properties. Little is known about the effect of cis-UCA on neutrophils, although one report demonstrated that it inhibits human neutrophil respiratory burst activity. However, the nature of this inhibition remains unknown. Because of the potential therapeutic use that a molecule such as cis-UCA may have in blocking excessive respiratory burst activity that may be deleterious to the host, the ability of cis-UCA to inhibit bovine neutrophil production of ROS was studied. Further, because neutrophil generation of ROS is necessary for optimal neutrophil bactericidal activity, a response which is critical for the host innate immune defense against infection, the effects of cis-UCA on bovine neutrophil phagocytosis and bacterial killing were assayed. cis- dose-dependently inhibited the respiratory burst activity of bovine neutrophils as measured by luminol chemiluminescence. Subsequently, the effect of cis-UCA on the production of specific oxygen radicals was investigated using more selective assays. Using 2 distinct assays, we established that cis-UCA inhibited the generation of extracellular superoxide. In contrast, cis-UCA had no effect on the generation of intracellular levels of superoxide or other ROS. At concentrations that inhibited generation of extracellular superoxide, bovine neutrophil phagocytosis and bacterial activity remained intact. Together, these data suggest that cis-UCA inhibits the tissue-damaging generation of extracellular ROS while preserving neutrophil bactericidal activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18312386>Screening of  isomers in human basal and squamous cell carcinoma tumors compared with tumor periphery and healthy skin.</a></h2><p>Trans- is a major chromophore for ultraviolet (UV) radiation in human epidermis. The UV induces photoisomerization of trans- (tUCA) form to cis- (cUCA) and has been reported as an important mediator in the immunosuppression induced by UV. This immunomodulation has been recognized as an important factor related to skin cancer development. This is the first time that UCA isomers have been measured in epidermis of skin biopsies from patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and with basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and compared with the tumor periphery and biopsies of healthy photoexposed and non-photoexposed skin as controls. The UCA isomers were separated and quantified by high performance liquid chromatography. Analysis of UCA in healthy skin showed significant increase in total UCA content in non-photoexposed body sites compared with highly exposed skins. In contrast, the percentage of cUCA was higher in photoexposed body sites. Maximal levels of cUCA were found in cheek, forehead and forearm and lower levels in abdomen and thigh. No differences were found in total UCA concentration between the tumor samples and healthy photoexposed skin. However, differences were found in relation between isomers. Higher levels of cUCA were detected in SCC biopsies (44% of total UCA) compared with samples of BCC and that of healthy photoexposed skin (30%). These results suggest that the UV radiation exposure, a main factor in development of SCC can be mediated, apart from direct effect to cells (DNA damage), by immunosuppression  mediated by high production of cUCA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21641400>Systemic low-dose UVB inhibits CD8 T cells and skin inflammation by alternative and novel mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Exposure to UVB radiation before antigen delivery at an unirradiated site inhibits functional immunological responses. Mice treated dorsally with suberythemal low-dose UVB and immunized with ova in abdominal skin generated ova-specific CD8 T cells with a significantly decreased activation, expansion, and cytotoxic activity compared with unirradiated mice. UVB also impaired the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction to ova. Transfer of CD4⁺CD25⁺cells from UVB-exposed mice did not suppress the ova-specific CD8 T-cell response or DTH reaction in unexposed mice, confirming that systemic low-dose UVB does not induce long-lived functional regulatory CD4⁺CD25⁺ T cells. Repairing cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer-type DNA damage and blocking aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling also did not reverse the immunosuppressive effect of UVB on ova-specific CD8 T cells and DTH, suggesting that cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor are not required in systemic low-dose UVB-induced immunosuppression. The known UVB chromophore, cis-, and reactive oxygen species triggered the inhibition of DTH caused by UVB, but they were not involved in the modulation of CD8 T cells. These findings indicate that systemic low-dose UVB impedes the primary response of antigen-specific CD8 T cells by a novel mechanism that is independent of  known to be involved in systemic suppression of DTH.Copyright © 2011 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

We collected stratum corneum (SC) specimens from the volar forearms of 10 CSU patients, 10 AD patients, and 10 healthy normal controls (NCs) and measured contents of FBPs (pyrrolidone carboxylic  [PCA] and  [UCA]) using UPLC-MS/MS, transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and epidermal pH. Compared to NCs, cis-UCA level was increased in CSU lesions (P < 0.05) and decreased in AD lesions (P < 0.01). The cis-to-trans-UCA ratio in SC specimens from CSU patients was significantly greater than those from AD and NC subjects. AD lesions had lower FBP and PCA contents compared to NC skin (both P < 0.001), and higher TEWL and pH compared to CSU lesions. Moreover, cis-UCA, but not trans-UCA, enhanced the IgE-mediated basophil activation, as well as IgE- and calcium-mediated degranulation of LAD-2 cells, in a dose-dependent manner. These findings suggest that increased cis-to-trans UCA ratio in the epidermis is a distinct feature of CSU, which could enhance mast cell degranulation.

The development into tumours of skin cells transformed by ultraviolet (UV) B radiation of wavelengths 290-320 nm is enhanced by the ability of UVB to suppress an immune response that would otherwise destroy them. Ultraviolet B-induced immunomodulation may be by multiple mechanisms, but generally manifests in an antigen-presenting cell defect and an altered cytokine environment in the draining lymph nodes. 2. Immune responses to microbial or self-antigens may be dysfunctional by similar mechanisms following UVB exposure. 3. Earliest-acting intermediates in the initiation of UVB-induced immunosuppression are the UVB absorbers (photoreceptors) of the skin, notably DNA resulting in immunoregulatory cytokine production, and trans- (UCA), which, upon isomerization to its cis isomer, signals downstream immunosuppressive events. 4. In mice, dermal mast cells are critical to UVB-induced systemic immunomodulation. In mice, there is a functional link as well as a linear relationship between the prevalence of histamine-staining dermal mast cells and the log of the dose of UVB required for 50% immunosuppression. Studies with histamine receptor antagonists support histamine as the main' product of mast cells involved. Histamine acts in large part via a prostanoid-dependent pathway. 5. Approximately 50% of humans and greater than 90% of patients with non-melanoma skin cancer are UVB susceptible for suppression of a contact hypersensitivity response. Neither cytokine polymorphisms nor UVB-induced levels of cis-UCA in irradiated skin have been linked to UVB susceptibility. Patients with basal cell carcinomas (BCC) have an increased dermal mast cell prevalence in non-sun-exposed buttock skin. We propose that mast cells function in humans, as in mice, by initiating immunosuppression and, thereby, allowing a permissive environment for BCC development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17170713>Looking ahead by looking back.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21036388>Effect of filaggrin breakdown products on growth of and protein expression by Staphylococcus aureus.</a></h2><p>Colonization of the skin by Staphylococcus aureus in individuals with atopic dermatitis exacerbates inflammation.

Histidine forms trans- (trans-UCA) enzymatically in the stratum corneum. Photoisomerization of trans-UCA to cis- (cis-UCA) has been proposed for the initiation of an immunosuppressive process. Many microorganisms described in the literature metabolize histidine and/or trans-UCA. Our enrichment cultures of soil and sewage contain organisms that can degrade cis-UCA. We have tested microorganisms for degradation of cis-UCA, trans-UCA, or L-histidine when they are incorporated at 0.2% in nutrient broth. Six out of 10 selected genera isolated by our clinical microbiology laboratory degrade one or more of the imidazole substrates. We have cultured over 60 aerobic isolates from human skin.

The effect that each had on UV-induced suppression of delayed-type hypersensitivity was measured. We asked whether the light source used (FS-40 sunlamps vs solar-simulated UV radiation) altered whichever pathway of immune suppression was activated. Different doses of UV radiation and the viability of the antigen were also considered. Neither the dose of UV nor the light source had any influence on determining which pathway was activated. Rather, we found that the viability of the antigen was the critical determinant. When live antigens were used, UV-induced immune suppression was blocked with monoclonal anti-cis-UCA but not with T4 endonuclease V-containing liposomes. The reverse was observed when formalin-fixed or killed antigens were used. Our findings indicate that antigen viability dictates which photoreceptor pathway predominates after UV exposure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25539991>Current knowledge in Polypodium leucotomos effect on skin protection.</a></h2><p>This article provides an overview of pharmacology, toxicity, pharmacokinetics and clinical data of Polypodium leucotomos L. (PL). PL aerial part has proven to exert antioxidant, photoprotective and immunomodulatory activities; its mechanism of action is complex and includes several activities: (1) PL diminishes the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS, RNS); (2) PL inhibits the photoisomerization of trans- (t-UCA); (3) PL inhibits apoptosis induced by ultraviolet radiation; (4) PL prevents damage to genetic material and (5) PL enhances DNA repair. PL is not mutagenic and does not induce acute or chronic toxicity. Its biological effects have been proved in cell cultures, animal models, murine models and in human beings. Photoprotective activity has been assessed in healthy volunteers as well as in patients suffering from several cutaneous diseases such as vitiligo, psoriasis, idiopathic photodermatosis or melasma. PL results to be an efficient treatment especially for sensitive cutaneous phototypes and adds extra protection when ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure cannot be avoided, such as wide or narrow band UVB phototherapy or treatment with psoralens plus UVA exposure radiation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16409897>The effect of clinical UVA/B exposures on urinary  isomer levels in individuals with caucasian type (II/III) skin types.</a></h2><p>Terrestrial ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure, consisting of ultraviolet A (320-40 nm) and B (290-320 nm), results in the photoisomerizion of epidermal trans- (trans-UCA) to cis- (cis-UCA), a potential suppressor of local and systemic immune responses. This study examines urinary UCA isomers as biomarkers of UVA/B exposure. It presents results measuring both cis- and trans-UCA in human urine samples collected from a group of study subjects (skin types II/III) that underwent controlled UVA/B exposures similar to those administered in commercial suntanning parlors. The UCA isomers were purified from urine using C18 solid-phase extraction columns followed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV absorbance (268 nm) detection. The UCA biomarker was expressed as the ratio of cis-UCA to trans-UCA (UCA ratio), or as cis-UCA concentration corrected for urine volume using creatinine (cis-UCA-Cr). The UCA ratio increased over baseline in the urine of individuals exposed to UVA/B. A single exposure to approximately 70 percent minimal erythema dose (MED) of UVR (95 % UVA/5 % UVB to approximately 90 % of skin area) produced a 4.75-fold increase in the UCA ratio (p< 0.001) relative to baseline. Repeated daily UV exposures of similar doses produced a minimal increase in UCA ratio above that of the single UV exposure. These findings indicate that UCA cis-trans ratio holds promise as a biomarker for recent solar UV exposure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21465502>Metabolomics applied to urine samples in childhood asthma; differentiation between asthma phenotypes and identification of relevant metabolites.</a></h2><p>Asthma is a heterogeneous disorder and one of the most common chronic childhood diseases. An improved characterization of asthma phenotypes would be invaluable for the understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms and the correct treatment of this disease. The aim of this pilot study was to explore the potential of metabolomics applied to urine samples in characterizing asthma, and to identify the most representative metabolites. Urine samples of 41 atopic asthmatic children (further subdivided in sub-groups according to the symptoms) and 12 age-matched controls were analyzed. Untargeted  profiles were collected by LC-MS, and studied by multivariate analysis. The group of the asthmatics was differentiated by a model that proved to be uncorrelated with the chronic assumption of controller drugs on the part of the patients. The distinct sub-groups were also appropriately modeled. Further investigations revealed a reduced excretion of , methyl-imidazoleacetic  and a metabolite resembling the structure of an Ile-Pro fragment in the asthmatics. The meaning of these findings was discussed and mainly correlated with the modulation of immunity in asthma.  profiles from urines have revealed the potential to characterize asthma and enabled the identification of metabolites that may have a role in the underlying inflammation.Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27784637>Screening and verifying endometrial carcinoma diagnostic biomarkers based on a urine metabolomic profiling study using UPLC-Q-TOF/MS.</a></h2><p>Endometrial carcinoma (EOC) is a gynecological disease with one of the highest worldwide incidences. Due to the lack of typical clinical symptoms and limited sensitive screening methods used to diagnose endometrial carcinoma, the disease is easily neglected before patients are aware of its presence. Therefore, EOC results in serious impacts on women's lives and health. We screened diagnostic biomarkers of EOC with a noninvasive method that compared healthy individuals and endometrial hyperplasia (EOH) patients.The morning urine of 25 healthy individuals, 25 patients with EOC and 10 patients with EOH were analyzed using an ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) platform. Metabolomics data were used to screen the different metabolites according to principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) analyses. Furthermore, the screened biomarkers of the newly diagnosed EOC and EOH candidates and healthy individuals were verified using the predictive model of the support vector machine (SVM) to obtain EOC diagnostic biomarkers.An EOC diagnostic biomarker group was found according to the metabolomics method. Five diagnostic biomarkers, including porphobilinogen, acetylcysteine, N-acetylserine,  and isobutyrylglycine, were significantly changed in the EOC patients. Among them, porphobilinogen and acetylcysteine were significantly down-regulated, while N-acetylserine,  and isobutyrylglycine were significantly up-regulated.Disturbances in these biomarkers have negative impacts on the body's  functioning. The EOC diagnostic biomarker group can provide a clinical reference for diagnosing EOC and insight into the diagnosis of other diseases in the clinic.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, the whole composition of sweat is still unknown and there is a lack of analytical strategies for sweat analysis. The aim of the present study was to develop and validate a method for metabolomic analysis of human sweat by gas chromatography-time of flight/mass spectrometry (GC-TOF/MS) in high resolution mode. Thus, different sample preparation strategies were compared to check their effect on the profile of sweat metabolites. Sixty-six compounds were tentatively identified by the obtained MS information. Amino acids, dicarboxylic acids and other interesting metabolites such as myo-inositol and  were identified. Among the tested protocols, methyoxiamination plus silylation after deproteinization was the most suited option to obtain a representative snapshot of sweat metabolome. The intra-day repeatability of the method ranged from 0.60 to 16.99% and the inter-day repeatability from 2.75 to 31.25%. As most of the identified metabolites are involved in key biochemical pathways, this study opens new possibilities to the use of sweat as a source of metabolite biomarkers of specific disorders.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This suppression has been attributed to the action of the cis form of  (UCA), a photoproduct of trans-UCA, a natural constituent of the skin. Here, we show that mouse spleen cells preincubated with cis-UCA have a diminished proliferative response to allogeneic cells in MLC and to stimulation with anti-CD3 mAb. Cells preincubated with cis-UCA also had a decreased ability to serve as APC and to stimulate the proliferation of allogeneic lymphocytes in MLC. Simultaneously, the production of IL-2 and IFN-gamma by cells preincubated with cis-UCA was decreased. However, IL-10 gene expression and IL-10 protein secretion by spleen cells stimulated in the presence of cis-UCA were significantly enhanced. The principal cell population displaying the cis-UCA-induced elevated production of IL-10 was CD4+ T cells, which were shown to be a direct target of cis-UCA action. This was also supported by the observation that production of IL-10 by stimulated splenic non-T cells or by macrophages was not altered by cis-UCA. The enhanced production of IL-10 by activated CD4+ T cells may represent a novel pathway of UVB radiation-induced, cis-UCA-mediated immunosuppression. We suggest that the elevated production of IL-10 by activated CD4+ T cells may account for the suppressor T cell phenomena described in UV-irradiated recipients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16259790>Interaction and reactivity of  towards peroxyl radicals.</a></h2><p>The capacity of  to interact with peroxyl radicals has been evaluated in several systems: oxidation in the presence of a free radical source (2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane; AAPH), protection of phycocyanin bleaching elicited by peroxyl radicals, and Cu(II)- and AAPH-promoted LDL oxidation. The results indicate that both isomers (cis and trans) are mild peroxyl radical scavengers. For example, trans- is nearly 400 times less efficient than Trolox in the protection of the peroxyl radical promoted bleaching of phycocyanin. Regarding the removal of  by peroxyl radicals, nearly 100 muM trans- is required to trap half of the produced radicals under the employed conditions (10 mM AAPH, 37 degrees C). Competitive experiments show that the cis-isomer traps peroxyl radicals 30% less efficiently than the trans-isomer. Given the high concentrations that trans- reaches in skin, its capacity to trap peroxyl radicals could contribute to the protection of the tissue towards ROS-mediated processes. Furthermore, both isomers, and particularly the cis-isomer, protect LDL from Cu(II)-induced oxidation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24061166>Filaggrin deficiency leads to impaired lipid profile and altered acidification  in a 3D skin construct.</a></h2><p>Mutations in the filaggrin (FLG) gene are strongly associated with common dermatological disorders such as atopic dermatitis. However, the exact underlying pathomechanism is still ambiguous. Here, we investigated the impact of FLG on skin lipid composition, organization, and skin acidification using a FLG knockdown (FLG-) skin construct. Initially, sodium/hydrogen antiporter (NHE-1) activity was sufficient to maintain the acidic pH (5.5) of the reconstructed skin. At day 7, the FLG degradation products  (UCA) and pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic  (PCA) were significantly decreased in FLG- constructs, but the skin surface pH was still physiological owing to an upregulation of NHE-1. At day 14, secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) IIA, which converts phospholipids to fatty acids, was significantly more activated in FLG- than in FLG+. Although NHE-1 and sPLA2 were able to compensate the FLG deficiency, maintain the skin surface pH, and ensured ceramide processing (no differences detected), an accumulation of free fatty acids (2-fold increase) led to less ordered intercellular lipid lamellae and higher permeability of the FLG- constructs.

Mice were exposed to a series of increasing daily UVB doses, each dose administered to the dorsum on 3 consecutive days. Erythema was assessed, and measured as its oedema component by the post-irradiation dorsal skinfold thickness, but there was no effect of the null mutation (MT-/-) observed after 3 x 3.4 kJ/m2 of UVB radiation. Immune function was assessed by the contact hypersensitivity (CHS) response, which was initiated by sensitization on unirradiated abdominal skin, and thus demonstrated the systemic effects of dorsal treatments. In comparison with the wild-type MT+/+ mouse, the MT-/- mouse was significantly more immunosuppressed by moderate daily UVB doses (1. 75-5.9 kJ/m2). When topically applied cis- (cis-UCA) replaced UVB radiation as the immunosuppressive agent, contact hypersensitivity in MT-/- mice was again markedly more suppressed than in MT+/+ mice, in a dose-responsive manner. The results infer that MT, which was shown immunohistochemically to be strongly induced in the epidermis of MT+/+ mice, but to be absent in MT-/- epidermis, has the potential to protect from photoimmunosuppression, and that the mechanism of action may be via the inactivation of the epidermal UVB-photoproduct, cis-UCA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11471746>Effect of dietary histidine content on the change in content of skin  isomers in hairless mice irradiated with ultraviolet B.</a></h2><p>Hairless mice were fed with a 10% amino  mixture diet (control diet, 0.42% histidine content), the control diet without histidine (histidine-free diet), or the control diet rich in histidine (histidine-rich diet; histidine content, 4.2%) for 32 days.

Total  isomers were decreased by UV irradiation in all the three groups, the recovery being the fastest in the histidine-rich group. The percentage increase in cis-/total  was quickly increased by UVB irradiation. The recovery of the ratio was slightly higher in the histidine-rich group, although the total  level was higher in the histidine-rich group than in the others. Therefore, the absolute cis- content in the skin was almost the same among the three groups.

The discovery of RNA interference provides efficient gene silencing within tumor cells for reversing MDR. In this study, a new "binary polymer" low-density lipoprotein--succinyl chitosan-cystamine- (LDL-NSC-SS-UA) with dual pH/redox sensitivity and targeting effect was synthesized for the co-delivery of breast cancer resistance protein small interfering RNA (siRNA) and paclitaxel (PTX). In vivo, the co-delivering micelles can accumulate in tumor tissue via the enhanced permeability and retention effect and the specific recognition and combination of LDL and LDL receptor, which is overexpressed on the surface of tumor cell membranes. The siRNA-PTX-loaded micelles inhibited gene and drug release under physiological conditions while promoting fast release in an  microenvironment or in the presence of glutathione. The micelles escaped from the lysosome through the proton sponge effect. Additionally, the micelles exhibited superior antitumor activity and downregulated the protein and mRNA expression levels of breast cancer resistance protein in MCF-7/Taxol cells. The biodistribution and antitumor studies proved that the siRNA-PTX-loaded micelles possessed prolonged circulation time with a remarkable tumor-targeting effect and effectively inhibited tumor growth.

Tolerability of cis-UCA was assessed by ocular comfort rating questionnaire. Pharmacokinetic blood and urine samples were analysed under good laboratory practice (GLP).All subjects completed both parts of the study. There were no significant adverse events (AEs). The most common treatment-related ocular AE was eye irritation (62.2% of subjects). Cis-UCA concentrations in plasma remained below the limit of quantification (0.195 μg/ml) in all but two subjects.

While many authorities believe that epidermal pigmentation evolved to protect against either ultraviolet B (UV-B) irradiation-induced mutagenesis or folic  photolysis, we hypothesize that pigmentation augmented the epidermal barriers by shifting the UV-B dose-response curve from toxic to beneficial. Whereas erythemogenic UV-B doses produce apoptosis and cell death, suberythemogenic doses benefit permeability and antimicrobial . Heavily melanized melanocytes acidify the outer epidermis and emit paracrine signals that augment  competence. Modern humans, residing in the cooler, wetter climes of south-central Europe and Asia, initially retained substantial pigmentation. While their outdoor lifestyles still permitted sufficient cutaneous vitamin D3 (VD3) synthesis, their marginal nutritional status, coupled with cold-induced caloric needs, selected for moderate pigment reductions that diverted limited nutritional resources towards more urgent priorities (=metabolic conservation). The further pigment-dilution that evolved as humans reached north-central Europe (i.e., northern France, Germany), likely facilitated cutaneous VD3 synthesis, while also supporting ongoing, nutritional requirements. But at still higher European latitudes where little UV-B breaches the atmosphere (i.e., present-day UK, Scandinavia, Baltic States), pigment dilution alone could not suffice. There, other nonpigment-related mutations evolved to facilitate VD3 production; for example, in the epidermal protein, filaggrin, resulting in reduced levels of its distal metabolite, trans-, a potent UV-B chromophore. Thus, changes in human pigmentation reflect a complex interplay between latitude, climate, diet, lifestyle, and shifting metabolic priorities.© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10494740>Epidermal  in discoid lupus erythematosus.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12390662>UV-induced skin changes due to regular use of commercial sunbeds.</a></h2><p>Increased pigmentation and thickening of the epidermis are the most important photoprotective skin reactions induced by ultraviolet (UV) radiation.

Recent studies suggest that an acidic pH is required for normal permeability barrier homeostasis and SC integrity/cohesion. We assessed here the basis for postnatal acidification in the neonatal rat, where SC pH, as measured with a flat surface electrode, declines progressively from near-neutral levels (pH 6.63) on postnatal days 0 to 1 to adult levels (pH 5.9) or even below over the subsequent 7 to 8 d. The postnatal decline in SC pH was paralleled by a progressive activation of a pH-dependent hydrolytic enzyme, beta-glucocerebrosidase. Because SC acidification could not be linked to commonly implicated exogenous factors, such as bacterial colonization, or the deposition of sebaceous gland products. We next assessed whether changes in one or more of three endogenous mechanisms demonstrate postnatal activity changes that contribute to the progressive development of an acidic SC pH. Although the histidine-to- pathway has been implicated in acidification of the adult SC, surface pH is completely normal in histidase-deficient (his/his, Peruvian) mice, ruling out a requirement for this mechanism. In contrast, when sodium/hydrogen antiporter-1 (NHE1), which predominantly acidifies membrane domains at the stratum granulosum-SC interface, is inhibited, postnatal acidification of the SC is partially blocked. Likewise, SC secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) activity, measured with a fluorometric assay, is low at birth, but increases progressively (by 66%) over the first 5 d after birth, and inhibition of sPLA2 between days 0 to 1 and days 5 to 6 delays postnatal SC acidification. Together, these results describe a neonatal model, in which the development of an acidic surface pH can be ascribed, in part, to progressive SC acidification by two endogenous mechanisms, namely, sPLA2 and NHE1, which are known to be important for acidification of adult rodent SC. Conversely, the impaired acidification of neonatal SC, which has important functional and clinical consequences, can be explained by the relatively low activities of one or both of these mechanisms at birth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24863253>The skin microbiome of caspase-14-deficient mice shows mild dysbiosis.</a></h2><p>Caspase-14, an important proteinase involved in filaggrin catabolism, is mainly active in terminally differentiating keratinocytes, where it is required for the generation of skin natural moisturizing factors (NMFs).

Patients suffering from filaggrin deficiency are prone to develop atopic dermatitis, which is accompanied with increased microbial burden. Among several reasons, this effect could be due to a decrease in filaggrin breakdown products. In this study, we found that caspase-14(-/-) mice show enhanced antibacterial response compared to wild-type mice when challenged with bacteria. Therefore, we compared the microbial communities between wild-type and caspase-14(-/-) mice by sequencing of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes. We observed that caspase-14 ablation leads to an increase in bacterial richness and diversity during steady-state conditions. Although both wild-type and caspase-14(-/-) skin were dominated by the Firmicutes phylum, the Staphylococcaceae family was reduced in caspase-14(-/-) mice.

This study seeks evidence for a common mechanism for this immunoprotection for both Er-beta signaling and irradiation with the UVA waveband. In Skh:hr-1 hairless mice, the immunoprotection afforded by UVA exposure against subsequent UVB or cis- suppression of contact hypersensitivity (CHS) was abrogated by treatment with the antiestrogen, ICI 182,780. Furthermore, in normal C57BL mice, UVA enrichment of UVA/UVB sources provided protection against UVB-suppressed CHS and upregulated epidermal IL-10 expression, but this protection was inhibited in Er-beta-/- mice. These observations indicated that the immunoprotective response to UVA was dependent on Er-beta signaling. As earlier studies have established that UVA photoimmune protection depends on the induction of the stress enzyme, heme oxygenase (HO)-1, its activity was examined relative to Er-beta. Immunoprotection against SSUV by 17-beta-estradiol was prevented by inhibiting HO enzyme activity; immunoprotection against cis- by carbon monoxide (HO product) was prevented by ICI 182,780. In addition, the HO-1 gene was unresponsive to UVA induction in Er-beta-/- mice.

An exception is the effects of UVR on immune responsiveness, with varying degrees of protection having been reported. We examined a system of UV-induced systemic suppression of contact hypersensitivity (CHS) responses in BALB/c mice. A range of commercially-available, broad spectrum, high SPF (15 + ) sunscreens demonstrated at best partial protection against systemic immunosuppression, yet were able to protect against two hallmarks of acute UVR-induced damage: skin oedema and keratinocyte proliferation. Two major models have been identified for the induction of immunosuppression following UVR, one identifying trans- (trans-UCA; deaminated histidine, located in the stratum corneum) as the critical photoreceptor, the other featuring DNA. UVR of trans-UCA produces cis-UCA, which itself is immunomodulatory. There was some abrogation of trans to cis isomerisation of  in UV-irradiated, sunscreen-protected mice. However, the majority of the immunomodulation seen in these mice was abrogated by pretreatment with a monoclonal antibody to cis-. It is possible to induce formation of cis- in BALB/c skin in the absence of immunosuppression, using lower doses of UV radiation, indicating that formation of cis- in the stratum corneum is not necessarily sufficient to induce immunosuppression in the UV-irradiated host. The mechanisms of induction of the immunomodulated state in the UV-irradiated host are potentially diverse and the subject of ongoing debate. Our studies maintain a role for cis-UCA, and form the basis for further studies on its involvement in immunomodulation by UVR in sunscreen-protected hosts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11345651>The enhancement of riboflavin-mediated photo-oxidation of doxorubicin by histidine and .</a></h2><p>Previously we have shown that doxorubicin (Adriamycin, ADR) can be inactivated by light-excited riboflavin. The inactivation of the drug results from its direct oxidation by the excited triplet riboflavin in a type I photosensitization reaction, and 3-methoxysalicyclic  is an ADR breakdown product. In the present study, we investigated the enhancement of this process by histidine and some other imidazole analogs.ADR solutions containing various concentrations of riboflavin and other agents were exposed to 365 nm light for various time periods and then the absorbance spectrum of ADR was measured by a double beam spectrophotometer. These measurement were used to calculate the half-time of the ADR degradation process. The degraded ADR solutions were analyzed by HPLC.The rate of bleaching of ADR by light-excited riboflavin was enhanced in the presence of histidine in a concentration-dependent manner. This enhancement was more pronounced at higher riboflavin concentrations. Histidine also enhanced the riboflavin-mediated photobleaching of N,N-dimethyl-4-nitrosoaniline (RNO), a compound known to be resistant to oxidation by singlet oxygen but sensitive to oxidation by the trans-annular peroxide of histidine. RNO was found to block the histidine enhancement of the riboflavin-mediated photobleaching of ADR in a competitive manner. Among the imidazole analogs of histidine tested,  was found to be the most efficient enhancer of the riboflavin-mediated photobleaching of ADR. Superoxide anion radicals which retard the oxidation of ADR were quenched by  but not by histidine. It was shown that the oxidation of ADR by the trans-annular peroxide of histidine resulted in the formation of 3-methoxysalicylic .In contrast to singlet oxygen, the trans-annular peroxide, formed by the interaction of histidine and the singlet oxygen produced by photoexcited riboflavin, is an efficient oxidizer of ADR. The enhancement of the riboflavin-mediated photobleaching of ADR by histidine analogs depends on the rate of their conversion to a trans-annular peroxide and on the efficiency of these products in oxidizing ADR. However, for some analogs of histidine, as shown for , other mechanisms could also be involved. The presence of  in the skin suggests that significant degradation of ADR could occur in the presence of biologically relevant concentrations of riboflavin if patients treated with ADR are exposed to sunlight. The finding that histidine also enhanced the degradation of ADR to 3-methoxysalicylic , suggests that the process of ADR oxidation by the trans-annular peroxides is similar to the direct oxidation of ADR by excited triplet riboflavin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10598754>Sunscreen protection against cis- production in human skin.</a></h2><p>Commercial sunscreens may offer some protection from immunosuppression induced by ultraviolet (UV) radiation, but agreement concerning the degree of protection is lacking. Cis-, formed by the photoisomerization of transurocanic  is considered an important mediator of the cutaneous immunomodulation resulting from exposure to UV radiation. We investigated the effect of sunscreens on the isomerization of  in 17 human subjects. Two sunscreens containing chemical filters, sun protection factor (SPF) 4 and SPF 10, and a SPF 10 sunscreen with a physical filter were applied at a thickness of 2 mg/cm2. The effect of a thin layer (0.5 mg/cm2) of the chemical SPF 10 sunscreen was also evaluated, as the amount of sunscreen applied in practice may be considerably less than recommended. All areas were irradiated with a single UV dose of 3.6 SED (standard erythema doses). In irradiated unprotected skin the median net production of cis- was 52% (relative amount). In the sites treated with the chemical sunscreens, the production of cis- was 7.4% (SPF 4) and 3.5% (SPF 10), and isomerization was thus reduced more efficiently at a higher SPF (p<0.01). The physical sunscreen reduced the formation of cis-UCA to 15%, and was significantly less effective than both the chemical SPF 10 sunscreen (p<0.01) and the SPF 4 sunscreen (p<0.01). The production of cis- in the area treated with the thin layer of the chemical SPF 10 sunscreen was 22%. The protection against the production of cis- was therefore reduced significantly (p<0.01) when the sunscreen was applied in an amount lower than recommended.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24352502>cis- as a potential nickel(II) binding molecule in the human skin.</a></h2><p>cis-, a derivative of histidine, is one of the essential components of human skin. We found that it can bind nickel(II) ions in a pH-dependent manner, with the dissociation constant in the low millimolar range, as revealed by potentiometry, and confirmed by isothermal titration calorimetry and UV-vis spectroscopy. The binding occurs within the physiological skin pH range.

Formation of cis-, however, is not affected. Besides , UV-induced DNA damage has been held responsible for the initiation of suppression of the contact hypersensitivity response. Therefore, the possible inhibitory effect of N-acetylcysteine on UVB-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone photoproducts has been investigated. No effect on the photoproducts studied is observed, suggesting that N-acetylcysteine exerts its photoprotective effect during the post-initiation phase of photoimmunosuppression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24328907>The effect of tacrolimus compared with betamethasone valerate on the skin barrier in volunteers with quiescent atopic dermatitis.</a></h2><p>Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an inflammatory skin disease arising as a result of immune system and skin barrier defects. Topical corticosteroids are safe and effective treatments for AD, when used in short courses. Prolonged use is associated with skin barrier damage. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are alternative immune-modulating treatments for AD purported to have no negative effects on the skin barrier.To compare the effects of betamethasone valerate 0·1% cream (BMVc) and tacrolimus 0·1% ointment (TACo) on the skin barrier.Twenty volunteers with quiescent AD (no active signs for 6 months) participated in a randomized observer-blind study, wherein BMVc was applied to one forearm and TACo to the other, twice daily for 4 weeks. The biophysical/biological properties of the stratum corneum were assessed before and after treatment. Nine volunteers with active disease and 10 with healthy skin were assessed at untreated sites.BMVc significantly reduced skin barrier function, integrity and cohesion, and the levels of pyrrolidone carboxylic  (PCA) and  (UCA) towards the subclinical barrier defect observed in patients with AD (nonlesional sites). TACo preserved skin barrier function, integrity, cohesion and PCA and UCA levels, while significantly increasing skin hydration to levels comparable with healthy skin. Both treatments reduced skin surface pH and trypsin-like protease activity, with TACo doing so to a significantly greater degree.In quiescent AD, 4 weeks of BMVc treatment adversely affected the biophysical properties of the skin and reduced the levels of natural moisturizing factor, whereas TACo improved the condition of the skin barrier.© 2013 British Association of Dermatologists.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19474802>cis- stimulates primary human keratinocytes independently of serotonin or platelet-activating factor receptors.</a></h2><p> (UCA) is a major epidermal chromophore that undergoes trans to cis isomerization after ultraviolet radiation (UVR). cis-UCA suppresses cell-mediated immunity. Recent studies suggest that cis-UCA binds to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) 2A (5-HT(2A)) receptor and that antagonists of 5-HT(2A) and the platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor can block cis-UCA-induced immune suppression in mice. Here, we examined the involvement of 5-HT(2A) and PAF receptors in the ability of cis-UCA to stimulate immunomodulatory mediator production in primary human keratinocytes. Using real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), PAF but not 5-HT(2A) receptor mRNA was constitutively expressed in primary human keratinocytes. Treatment with cis-UCA increased prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and IL-6 secretion, whereas 5-HT only stimulated IL-6 production. Pretreatment with a 5-HT receptor antagonist partially inhibited IL-6 increase by 5-HT, but did not inhibit mediator production by cis-UCA. Similarly, a PAF receptor antagonist did not inhibit cis-UCA-induced increase in PGE(2). Intracellular calcium mobilization studies using a human epithelial cell line stably transfected with PAF receptor also showed little evidence that cis-UCA stimulated PAF receptor and it did not bind to this receptor. Thus, cis-UCA stimulates mediator production by a pathway that is independent of these receptors in human keratinocytes, and these cells may not be the major target for cis-UCA-induced immune suppression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12405147>Refractoriness of UVA-induced protection from photoimmunosuppression correlates with heme oxygenase response to repeated UVA exposure.</a></h2><p>Single suberythemal exposures of UVA radiation have been shown to block the immunosuppressive effects of UVB radiation in the mouse. The immunoprotection is dependent both on the presence of the cytokine, IFN-gamma, and on the induction of the antioxidant stress enzyme, heme oxygenase (HO), in the skin. Recently, the transcriptional response of the HO-1 gene to UVA radiation in cultured human skin fibroblasts was reported to be refractory to a second UVA irradiation. In this study on the hairless mouse, we demonstrate that the inducibility of HO enzyme activity in the skin similarly became refractory to a second UVA irradiation at 24 h but, like the fibroblast response, was restored when the interval between the UVA exposures was increased to 96 h. Under the conditions of refractory HO enzyme induction, the protective effect of UVA radiation against the suppression of contact hypersensitivity induced by UVB radiation or cis- was strongly attenuated but was restored when the interval between UVA exposures was increased to 96 h. The results thus confirm the strong relationship between HO induction and photoimmunoprotection by UVA radiation, and describe a new phenomenon of immunological refractoriness that develops with rapidly repeated UVA exposures.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12573947>Cis- increases immunotoxicity and lethality of dermally administered permethrin in C57BL/6N mice.</a></h2><p>Immunomodulatory effects of a single topical permethrin exposure, 5-day exposure to cis- (cUCA), or a combination of the two chemicals were evaluated in 4- to 5-week-old female C57BL/6N mice. Permethrin alone decreased thymic weight and cellularity. Although cUCA alone did not affect thymic end points, coexposure to topical permethrin and cUCA exacerbated the thymolytic effects of permethrin. The single topical dose of permethrin also depressed several immune responses in isolated splenic leukocytes. This included splenic T-cell proliferative response to mitogen, splenic macrophage hydrogen peroxide production, and splenic B lymphocyte-specific antibody production. Unlike the effect of coexposure to these agents on thymic end points, cUCA did not exacerbate permethrin's adverse effect on any of the splenic end points examined. These results appear to suggest divergent mechanisms by which these compounds affect precursor and functionally mature T cells. At the doses used in this study, permethrin caused neurotoxic effects, including lethality, in a portion of the mice. For undetermined reasons, cUCA significantly increased the rate of lethality caused by permethrin. Although the permethrin doses used in this study exceed that typically used in human medicine, these results raise some concerns about the possibility that sunlight, via cUCA, may increase the risk of adverse central nervous system and immune effects caused by permethrin alone.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20920317>Molecular targets for the protodynamic action of cis- in human bladder carcinoma cells.</a></h2><p>cis- (cis-UCA) is an endogenous amino  metabolite capable of transporting protons from the mildly acidic extracellular medium into the cell cytosol. The resulting intracellular acidification suppresses many cellular activities. The current study was aimed at characterizing the molecular mechanisms underlying cis-UCA-mediated cytotoxicity in cultured cancer cells.5367 bladder carcinoma cells were left untreated or treated with cis-UCA. Cell death was assessed by measuring caspase-3 activity, mitochondrial membrane polarization, formation and release of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments, and cellular permeabilization. Cell viability and  activity were monitored by colorimetric assays. Nuclear labelling was used to quantify the effects of cis-UCA on cell cycle. The activity of the ERK and JNK signalling  was studied by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. Phosphatase activity in cis-UCA-treated cells was determined by assay kits measuring absorbance resulting from the dephosphorylation of an artificial substrate. All statistical analyses were performed using the two-way Student's t-test (p < 0.05).Here we report that treatment of the 5637 human bladder carcinoma cells with 2% cis-UCA induces both apoptotic and necrotic cell death. In addition,  activity of the 5637 cells is rapidly impaired, and the cells arrest in cell cycle in response to cis-UCA. Importantly, we show that cis-UCA promotes the ERK and JNK signalling  by efficiently inhibiting the activity of serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphatases.Our studies elucidate how cis-UCA modulates several cellular processes, thereby inhibiting the proliferation and survival of bladder carcinoma cells. These anti-cancer effects make cis-UCA a potential candidate for the treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder carcinoma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10384916>Epidermal  concentration and photoisomerization reactivity in patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma or basal cell carcinoma.</a></h2><p>The relationship of epidermal  concentration and photoisomerization reactivity to human skin cancer was studied.

Mast cells accumulate around cutaneous malignancies. Current evidence suggests that mast cells contribute to the tumorigenesis of cutaneous malignancies through four mechanisms. (1) Immunosuppression: Ultraviolet-B radiation, the most important initiator of cutaneous malignancies, activates mast cells. Upon irradiation of the skin, trans- in the epidermis isomerizes to cis-, which stimulates neuropeptide release from neural c-fibers. These neuropeptides in turn trigger histamine secretion from mast cells, leading to suppression of the cellular immune system. (2) Angiogenesis: Mast cells are the major source of vascular endothelial growth factor in basal cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma. Vascular endothelial growth factor is one of the most potent angiogenic factors, which also induces leakage of other angiogenic factors across the endothelial cell wall into the matrix. Mast cell proteases reorganize the stroma to facilitate endothelial cell migration. As well, heparin, the dominant mast cell proteoglycan, assists in blood-borne metastasis. (3) Degradation of extracellular matrix: Through its own proteases, and indirectly via interaction with other cells, mast cells participate in degradation of the matrix, which is required for tumor spread. (4) Mitogenesis: Mast cell mediators including fibroblast growth factor-2 and interleukin-8 are mitogenic to melanoma cells. Current evidence supports an accessory role for mast cells in the development and progression of cutaneous malignancies. Emerging data, however, also suggest that mast cells might, in fact, have opposing roles in tumor biology, and the microenvironment could polarize mast cells to possess either promoting or inhibitory effects on tumors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15854050>An action spectrum for the production of cis- in human skin in vivo.</a></h2><p> (UCA) is present at millimolar concentrations in mammalian epidermis and undergoes photoisomerization from the naturally occurring trans-isomer to the cis-isomer on exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR). Cis-UCA causes downregulation of various immune responses in mouse and human experimental models and has been proposed as both a chromophore and a mediator of UV-induced immune suppression. In this study, the wavelength dependence from 260-340 nm for trans to cis-UCA photoisomerization in human skin was analyzed in five healthy volunteers. The resulting action spectrum demonstrated maximal cis-UCA production in the UVB spectral region of 280-310 nm. This spectral peak is red-shifted to longer wavelengths compared with the erythemal action spectrum. The cis-UCA action spectrum can be used to predict the ability of sunscreens to protect against UVR-induced cis-UCA formation and may assist in explaining discrepancies between sunscreens' abilities to protect against erythema and photoimmunosuppression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19618743>Molecularly imprinted polymers--tyrosinase mimics.</a></h2><p>Synthetic polymers mimicking the enzyme tyrosinase have been prepared by the molecular imprinting of a complex between Cu (II) and catechol and ethyl ester of  in an ethylene glycol dimethacrylate copolymer.

These strains were ascribed to the A. salmonicida species by using 65 biochemical tests and by DNA-DNA hybridization. They produce  from -sorbitol, an unusual biochemical property found in a few members of the A. salmonicida species. They also utilize  and do not ferment L-rhamnose or utilize LD-lactate, and are elastase- and gluconate-negative. The DNA relatedness was over 70%, the current limit accepted for the phylogenetic definition of a species, to the described A. salmonicida subspecies and nearly 100% within the new group of Aeromonas strains. Phenotypic differentiation from other A. salmonicida subspecies was readily achieved using the following characteristics: growth at 37 degrees C, melanin production, indole and Voges-Proskauer assays, growth on KCN broth, mannitol and sucrose fermentation and gas from glucose. A remarkable property of the strains of the new group was their ability to degrade polypectate, an unusual feature among Aeromonas species in general. The complete 16S rRNA gene of one strain of the new group was sequenced. Comparison with rDNA sequences of Aeromonas members available in databases revealed a close relationship between this strain and strains belonging to A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida, masoucida and achromogenes, in agreement with the biochemical data. Since the new A. salmonicida strains constitute a tight genomic group that can be identified by phenotypic properties it was concluded that they represent a new subspecies for which the name Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. pectinolytica is proposed.

The ensemble was synthesized by directly conjugating the linoleic  (LA)-modified branched polyethyleneimine with a chemotherapeutic drug trifluorothymidine. Linoleic  residues were grafted onto 25 kDa polyethyleneimine (PEI) by treating PEI with linoleic  chloroanhydride. 5-Trifluoromethyl-2'-deoxyuridine (trifluorothymidine, TFT) was introduced into LA-PEI conjugate by phosphorylating the conjugate with amidophosphate of trifluorothymidine 5'-monophosphate (pTFT), which had been activated by its conversion into the N,N-dimethylaminopyridine derivative. The extent of mononucleotide analog incorporation in the polymer was regulated by the ratio of pTFT to the polymer during the synthesis. Samples containing 20-70 TFT residues per PEI molecule were obtained. The cytotoxicity of PEI-LA-pTFT conjugates decreased with increasing nucleotide content, as examined using the MTT method. Due to the presence of fluorine atoms, TFT-based conjugates could be detected directly in the animals by (19)F magnetic resonance imaging. In addition, the presence of the amidophosphate group in PEI-LA-pTFT conjugates allowed their detection by in vivo(31)P NMR spectroscopy. Indeed, the (31)P NMR signal of a phosphoramide (δ ~ 12 ppm) was observed in the mouse muscle tissue treated with PEI-LA-pTFT conjugate along with the signals from endogenous phosphorus-containing compounds. At the same time, the use of PEI-LA-pTFT conjugate for chemotherapeutic drug delivery is limited due to the low release of pTFT from the carrier. To enhance the release of the drug from the conjugate in the endosomes, PEI-LA polymer was coupled with  (UA), which bears imidazole ring and thus can form an -labile P-N bond with pTFT. The PEI-LA-UA-pTFT conjugate containing 30 residues of UA and 40 residues of pTFT was tested against the murine Krebs-II ascites carcinoma, grown as an ascetic tumor. The intraperitoneal injection of the conjugates resulted in prolongation of the animals' life and to the complete disappearance of the tumor after three injections.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29625778>[The epidermal ].</a></h2><p>The skin acts as an interface between the body and its surrounding environment.

It alters immune function, pigmentation and it is certainly responsible for a large part of photoaging changes. Moreover UVA is implicated in the etiology of several photodermatoses. As a consequence, to provide adequate protection, sunscreens or skin care products for daily use protective products need UVA absorbers combined with UVB ones.To assess the efficacy of sunscreens containing a broad-spectrum UVA absorber the Mexoryls SX or ecamsule and to compare formulations with and without it through a large number of clinical studies in human volunteers and patients.The following assessments were conducted: *Prevention of excessive pigmentation induced by UV exposure in Caucasian and Asian skins using a method that measures pigmentation protection factors (PPF). *Efficacy against DNA damage by measurement of pyrimidine dimer formation and p53 protein accumulation. *Protection of immune system using delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions to recall antigens, isomerization of  (UCA), alteration of Langerhans cells (LC) density, morphology and function. *Reduction of epidermal and dermal alterations induced by repeated UVA or UV solar simulated radiation (SSR) using histology or immunohistology. *Prevention of the polymorphous light eruption (PMLE) in patients prone to develop this disease.Mexoryls SX-containing formulations showed a dose-dependent level of protection against pigmentation. For a same sun protection factor (SPF) the higher the UVA protection was, the higher was the PPF. Pyrimidine dimer formation and p53 accumulation were significantly reduced by formulations with Mexoryls SX. In the studies looking at the suppression of DTH reactions to recall antigens by the different UV spectra, the LC alterations and the cis UCA formation, Mexoryls SX formulations always showed a higher protective potency than sunscreen without it even when the protection against erythema was similar (products with same SPF). Mexoryls SX formulations also prevented or significantly decreased to minimal, ferritin, tenascin and lysozyme expression induced by repeated UVA or SSR exposure. It also reduced the enhancement of collagenase 2 mRNA expression induced by SSR exposure. Finally PMLE study demonstrated that UVA protection was essential for the prevention of this photodermatose.Mexoryls SX formulated in sunscreens or daily use products have been shown to be an effective UV absorber, leading to an increased efficacy of these products against a large number of biological damage induced by UVA, SSR or sun exposure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22921868>Skin barrier abnormality caused by filaggrin (FLG) mutations is associated with increased serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10354063>The effects of ultraviolet radiation on the human immune system.</a></h2><p>The adverse outcome of increased ultraviolet (UV) irradiation on human health is currently of concern.

This study describes the potential for orally consumed goji berry juice to alter the photodamage induced in the skin of mice by acute solar simulated UV (SSUV) irradiation. In Skh:hr-1 hairless mice, 5% goji berry juice significantly reduced the inflammatory oedema of the sunburn reaction. Dilutions of goji berry juice between 1% and 10% dose-dependently protected against SSUV-induced immunosuppression, and against suppression induced by the mediator, cis-, measured by the contact hypersensitivity reaction. The immune protection could not be ascribed to either the minor excipients in the goji juice, pear and apple juice, nor the vitamin C content, nor the preservative, and appeared to be a property of the goji berry itself. Antioxidant activity in the skin was demonstrated by the significant protection by 5% goji juice against lipid peroxidation induced by UVA radiation. Furthermore, two known inducible endogenous skin antioxidants, haem oxygenase-1 and metallothionein, were found to be involved in the photoimmune protection.

This study utilizes IL-6-deficient mice to demonstrate that IL-6 does not contribute to the normal contact hypersensitivity response, nor to its systemic suppression by UVB radiation or cis-. In contrast, IL-6 was required for the attenuation of UVB- or cis--induced immunosuppression by sequential or concomitant UVA irradiation. The IL-6 was essential for several reactions previously established to be relevant for UVA photoimmune protection, namely the induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), the activity of its product carbon monoxide in activating guanylyl cyclase, and the consequent elevation of cutaneous cyclic guanosine monophosphate concentration. In addition, IL-6-deficient mouse skin had an elevated constitutive overexpression of HO activity, apparently not associated with photoimmune protection. This suggested that both the cutaneous level of HO activity, and the receptiveness of the HO-1 gene to stressors like UVA, normally controlled by promoter-binding repressor proteins, may also be under IL-6 control. Thus IL-6 has an important photoimmune protective function through interaction at several levels in the pathway determining the immunologically advantageous actions of UVA radiation. This may constitute a valuable endogenous antiphotocarcinogenic regulatory mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18366745>Histamine  influences blood vessel branching in zebrafish reg6 mutants.</a></h2><p>Vascular branching morphogenesis is responsible for the extension of blood vessels into growing tissues, a process crucial for organogenesis. However, the genetic mechanism for vessel branching is largely unknown. Zebrafish reg6 is a temperature-sensitive mutation exhibiting defects in blood vessel branching which results in the formation of swollen vessel lumina during capillary plexus formation.We performed a screening for chemical suppressors of reg6 and identified SKF91488, an inhibitor of histamine methyltransferase (HMT), that can rescue the reg6 vessel branching defects in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of HMT by SKF91488 presumably blocks histamine degradation, thus causing histamine accumulation. Consistent with this idea, we found that a high level of histamine also showed significant suppression of reg6 vessel phenotypes. Interestingly, when reg6 adults that had already developed swollen vessel lumina in regenerating fins were treated with histamine or SKF91488, either treatment significantly reduced the number of swollen vessels within 12 h, suggesting a rapid and constant influence of histamine on blood vessel branching. Furthermore, the expression of HMT was significantly elevated in reg6 regenerating fins. Conversely, lowering histamine by administering , a histidine decarboxylase inhibitor, enhanced the reg6 phenotypes. Finally, we identified that the transcription factor, egr-1 (early growth response factor 1), was closely associated with the reg6 phenotype and chemical treatments.Taken together, our results suggest that blood vessel branching is influenced by histamine , possibly through regulating the expression of the egr-1 transcription factor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17085585>Cis-, a sunlight-induced immunosuppressive factor, activates immune suppression via the 5-HT2A receptor.</a></h2><p>Exposure to UV radiation induces skin cancer and suppresses the immune response. To induce immune suppression, the electromagnetic energy of UV radiation must be absorbed by an epidermal photoreceptor and converted into a biologically recognizable signal. Two photoreceptors have been recognized: DNA and trans- (UCA). Trans-UCA is normally found in the outermost layer of skin and isomerizes to the cis isomer upon exposure to UV radiation. Although UCA was identified as a UV photoreceptor years ago, and many have documented its ability to induce immune suppression, its exact mode of action remains elusive. Particularly vexing has been the identity of the molecular pathway by which cis-UCA mediates immune suppression. Here we provide evidence that cis-UCA binds to the serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] receptor with relatively high affinity (Kd = 4.6 nM). Anti-cis-UCA antibody precipitates radiolabeled 5-HT, and the binding is inhibited by excess 5-HT and/or excess cis-UCA. Similarly, anti-5-HT antibody precipitates radiolabeled cis-UCA, and the binding is inhibited by excess 5-HT or excess cis-UCA. Calcium mobilization was activated when a mouse fibroblast line, stably transfected with the human 5-HT2A receptor, was treated with cis-UCA. Cis-UCA-induced calcium mobilization was blocked with a selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist. UV- and cis-UCA-induced immune suppression was blocked by antiserotonin antibodies or by treating the mice with 5-HT2A receptor antagonists. Our findings identify cis-UCA as a serotonin receptor ligand and indicate that the immunosuppressive effects of cis-UCA and UV radiation are mediated by activation of the 5-HT2A receptor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22048469>Hypoxia inducible factor-1α contributes to UV radiation-induced inflammation, epidermal hyperplasia and immunosuppression in mice.</a></h2><p>Hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), a ubiquitous inducible oxygen-sensing transcription factor, promotes cell survival under hypoxic conditions, including the early pre-angiogenic period of tumorigenesis, and is known to contribute to many malignancies. However HIF-1α can also be activated by inflammatory mediators, and can activate inflammation-modulating proteins itself, including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and the cytokine IL-6. Recently HIF-1α was reported to be induced by UVB (290-320 nm) radiation in cultured human keratinocytes, acting as a stress protein associated with the release of reactive oxygen species. In this in vivo murine study we demonstrate that HIF-1α protein is an early responder to UV radiation in the skin, and its activation can be attenuated by treating mice with its post-translational inhibitor, YC-1. Treatment with YC-1 following UV-irradiation of mice has revealed the involvement of HIF-1α in UV-induced inflammation, IL-6 production, and epidermal hyperplasia. In addition, upregulated cutaneous HIF-1α was found to be an important factor in the UV-suppression of T cell-mediated immunity, measured by contact hypersensitivity (CHS). The mechanism remains unclear, however it did not appear to involve the immunosuppressive cutaneous photoproduct cis-, but HIF-1α induction was inhibited by irradiation with photoimmune protective UVA (320-400 nm), implicating a negative correlation between the two stress proteins, HIF-1α and the photoimmune protective UVA responder HO-1.This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry and Owner Societies 2012</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29779945>Moderate UV Exposure Enhances Learning and Memory by Promoting a Novel Glutamate Biosynthetic Pathway in the Brain.</a></h2><p>Sunlight exposure is known to affect mood, learning, and cognition. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show that moderate UV exposure elevated blood  (UCA), which then crossed the blood-brain . Single-cell mass spectrometry and isotopic labeling revealed a novel intra-neuronal metabolic pathway converting UCA to glutamate (GLU) after UV exposure. This UV-triggered GLU synthesis promoted its packaging into synaptic vesicles and its release at glutamatergic terminals in the motor cortex and hippocampus. Related behaviors, like rotarod learning and object recognition memory, were enhanced after UV exposure. All UV-induced metabolic, electrophysiological, and behavioral effects could be reproduced by the intravenous injection of UCA and diminished by the application of inhibitor or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against urocanase, an enzyme critical for the conversion of UCA to GLU. These findings reveal a new GLU biosynthetic pathway, which could contribute to some of the sunlight-induced neurobehavioral changes.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we investigated the photoprotective role of endogenous UCA in the murine skin using histidinemic mice, in which the gene encoding histidase is mutated. Histidase was detected by immunohistochemistry in the stratum granulosum and stratum corneum of the normal murine skin but not in the histidinemic skin. The UCA content of the stratum corneum and the UVB absorption capacity of aqueous extracts from the stratum corneum were significantly reduced in histidinemic mice as compared with wild-type mice. When the shaved back skin of adult mice was irradiated with 250 mJ cm(-2) UVB, histidinemic mice accumulated significantly more DNA damage in the form of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers than did wild-type mice. Furthermore, UVB irradiation induced significantly higher levels of markers of apoptosis in the epidermis of histidinemic mice. Topical application of UCA reversed the UVB-photosensitive phenotype of histidinemic mice and increased UVB photoprotection of wild-type mice. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence for an important contribution of endogenous UCA to the protection of the epidermis against the damaging effects of UVB radiation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23807577>Facile and efficient syntheses of a series of N-benzyl and N-biphenylmethyl substituted imidazole derivatives based on (E)-, as angiotensin II AT1 receptor blockers.</a></h2><p>In the present work, a facile and efficient route for the synthesis of a series of N-substituted imidazole derivatives is described.

Loss-offunction mutations in FLG lead to reduced levels of filaggrin degradation products in the SC. It has recently been suggested that expression of filaggrin may additionally be influenced by the atopic inflammatory response. In this study, we investigated the levels of several breakdown products of filaggrin in the SC in healthy controls (CTRL) and patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) in relation to FLG null allele status. We examined the relationship between NMF (defined here as the sum of PCA and UCA) and AD severity.The SC levels of filaggrin degradation products including PCA, UCA, histidine (HIS) and tyrosine were determined in 24 CTRL and 96 patients with moderate-to-severe AD. All subjects were screened for 11 FLG mutations relevant for the study population.The levels of PCA, UCA and HIS correlated with FLG genotype. Furthermore, these levels were higher in the CTRL when compared to AD patients with no FLG mutations. Multiple regression analysis showed that NMF levels were independently associated with FLG genotype and severity of disease.Decreased NMF is a global feature of moderate-to-severe AD; within AD, FLG genotype is the major determinant of NMF, with disease severity as a secondary modifier. NMF components are reliably determined by a noninvasive and relatively inexpensive tape stripping technique.© 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602923>[UPLC-Q-TOF-MS-based metabolomics study of celastrol].</a></h2><p>The mass spectrometry-based metabolomics method was used to systematically investigate the formation of celastrol metabolites,and the effect of celastrol on endogenous metabolites.

The nested case-control study was based on a 13-year follow-up of about 19000 middle-aged men free of clinically verified prostate cancer. More than one-half of the serum samples had 25OH-vitamin D (25-VD) levels below 50 nmol/l, suggesting VD deficiency. Prostate cancer risk was highest among the group of younger men (40-51 years) with low serum 25-VD, whereas low serum 25-VD appeared not to increase the risk of prostate cancer in older men (>51 years). This suggests that VD has a protective role against prostate cancer only before the andropause, when serum androgen concentrations are higher. The lowest 25-VD concentrations in the younger men were associated with more aggressive prostate cancer. Furthermore, the high 25-VD levels delayed the appearance of clinically verified prostate cancer by 1.8 years. Since these results suggest that vitamin D has a protective role against prostate cancer, we tried to determine whether full spectrum lighting (FSL) during working hours could increase serum 25-VD concentrations. After 1-month exposure, there was no significant increase in the serum 25-VD level, although there was a bias towards slightly increasing values in the test group as opposed to decreasing values in controls. There was no significant change in the skin  production. The possibility to use FSL in cancer prevention is discussed. In order to clarify the mechanism of VD action on cell proliferation and differentiation, we performed studies with the rat and human prostates as well prostate cancer cell lines. It is possible that 25-VD may have a direct role in the host anticancer defence activity, but the  of vitamin D in the prostate may also play an important role in its action. We raised antibodies against human 1alpha-hydroxylase and 24-hydroxylase. Our preliminary results suggest that vitamin D is actively metabolised in the prostate. Vitamin D appears to upregulate androgen receptor expression, whereas androgens seem to upregulate vitamin D receptor (VDR). This may at least partially explain the androgen dependence of VD action. VD alone or administered with androgen causes a suppression of epithelial cell proliferation. VD can activate mitogen-activated kinases, erk-1 and erk-2, within minutes and p38 within hours. Also, auto/paracrine regulation might be involved, since keratinocyte growth factor (mRNA and protein) was clearly induced by VD. Based on these studies, a putative model for VD action on cell proliferation and differentiation is presented.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18528548>Recent advances in  photochemistry, photobiology and photoimmunology.</a></h2><p> (UCA), produced in the upper layers of mammalian skin, is a major absorber of ultraviolet radiation (UVR).

Eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) can inhibit photocarcinogenesis, but due to its polyunsaturated nature it is susceptible to oxidative damage by ROS. The antioxidant defense system may therefore be challenged upon ultraviolet-B (UVB) irradiation in the presence of EPA. We investigated whether topically applied EPA in mice could protect against local immunosuppression (contact hypersensitivity response to dinitrofluorobenzene) induced by UVB radiation (1.5 J/cm2), or topically applied cis-UCA (150 nmol/cm2) or thymidine dinucleotides (pTpT) (5 nmol/cm2). The influence of EPA on epidermal lipid peroxidation and antioxidant status was also measured. UVB irradiation, cis-UCA and pTpT all caused 70% immunosuppression. Topical pretreatment of mice with EPA partially protected against immunosuppression; the EPA dose needed to accomplish this was 10 nmol/cm2 for UVB irradiation, 100 nmol/cm2 for cis-UCA and 1000 nmol/cm2 for pTpT. Higher EPA doses caused higher UVB-induced lipid peroxidation and lower vitamin C levels. Glutathione only decreased with the highest EPA dose whereas vitamin E was not decreased after UVB irradiation. In conclusion, topically applied EPA protects against UVB-, cis-UCA- and pTpT-induced immunosuppression and maintenance of an adequate antioxidant defense seems to be an important prerequisite for the protective action by EPA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25412785>Phototherapy and photochemotherapy for psoriasis.</a></h2><p>Phototherapy is a first-line option for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis.

This study examined the effect of ultraviolet B irradiation on epidermal filaggrin and natural moisturizing factors in vivo in healthy adults (n = 22). Participants were irradiated with 2 minimal erythema doses of ultraviolet B on the skin. Biopsies and tape strips were collected from skin irradiated 24 and 72 h earlier and from non-irradiated skin (control). Real-time quantitative PCR on skin biopsies showed significantly reduced profilaggrin mRNA expression 24 h after irradiation (mean relative mRNA expression ± standard deviation: control, 3.86 ± 2.06 vs. 24 h, 1.52 ± 0.640; p = 0.02; n = 8). Immunohistochemistry showed aberrant spatial distribution of filaggrin protein 72 h after irradiation (n = 3). High-pressure liquid chromatography of tape extracts showed no change in mean total natural moisturizing factor levels after irradiation, but mean trans- was significantly reduced, as expected (n = 8).

Recently, N-acetylcysteine was found to protect against UVB-radiation-induced immunosuppression and several other types of damage induced by UV radiation. The protective effects appeared to be caused by an increase in glutathione (GSH). This increase was limited by feedback inhibition by GSH of its own synthesis. Better results were expected with the use of GSH derivatives which do not require de novo synthesis, such as GSH esters. In this study, topical application of glutathione ethylester (GSH-Et) was found to increase the epidermal GSH level in mice in a manner that was dependent on dose to 1234% of the control value at the highest dose tested (2.0 micromol/cm2). This resulted in dose-dependent protection against UVB-radiation-induced suppression of contact hypersensitivity. The highest dose of GSH-Et tested provided 83% protection against local suppression and 62% protection against systemic suppression. Immunosuppression induced by topically applied cis- (cis-UCA) was prevented completely. Although an effect on the formation of pyrimidine dimers cannot be excluded, the protective effect of GSH-Et seems to be mediated through inhibition of the action of cis-UCA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19683920>Molecular basis for cis- as a 5-HT(2A) receptor agonist.</a></h2><p>The underlying mechanisms of  (UA) to induce immune suppression remain elusive until the recent finding that cis-UA acts via the serotonin, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor subtype 5-HT(2A).

Caspase-14-deficient mice display reduced epidermal barrier function and increased sensitivity to UVB radiation. In these mice, profilaggrin, a protein with a pivotal role in skin barrier function, is processed correctly to its functional filaggrin (FLG) repeat unit, but proteolytic FLG fragments accumulate in the epidermis. In wild-type stratum corneum, FLG is degraded into free amino acids, some of which contribute to generation of the natural moisturizing factors (NMFs) that maintain epidermal hydration. We found that caspase-14 cleaves the FLG repeat unit and identified two caspase-14 cleavage sites. These results indicate that accumulation of FLG fragments in caspase-14(-/-) mice is due to a defect in the terminal FLG degradation pathway. Consequently, we show that the defective FLG degradation in caspase-14-deficient skin results in substantial reduction in the amount of NMFs, such as  and pyrrolidone carboxylic .

Moreover, UV exposure induces immune suppression. Early steps in the cascade of events leading to immune suppression are the binding of UV-induced platelet-activating factor (PAF) to its receptor and the binding of cis-, a photoreceptor for UVB radiation, to the serotonin (5-HT(2A)) receptor. Here, we tested the hypothesis that blocking the binding of PAF and 5-HT(2A) to their receptors would also block skin cancer induction. Hairless mice were injected with PAF or serotonin receptor antagonists and then exposed to solar-simulated UV radiation. We noted a significant and substantial decrease in skin cancer incidence in mice treated with the PAF or 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonists. Also, the PAF and/or serotonin receptor antagonists blocked skin cancer progression. The PAF and serotonin receptor antagonists worked in a synergistic fashion to block skin cancer induction. We also measured the effect that injecting PAF and 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonists had on UV-induced skin damage after a single UV exposure. We noted a significant decrease in UV-induced hypertrophy, sunburn cell formation, and apoptosis when the mice were injected with PAF and/or 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonists. These data indicate that treating UV-irradiated mice with PAF and 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonists blocks skin cancer induction in vivo, in part by reversing UV-induced damage to the skin and by preventing the induction of immune suppression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16528353>The receptor for cis- remains elusive.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11266559>Enhancing the catalytic repertoire of nucleic acids: a systematic study of linker length and rigidity.</a></h2><p>The incorporation of potentially catalytic groups in DNA is of interest for the in vitro selection of novel deoxyribozymes.

Also, similar to LAD, Pm1 was most active on L-histidine, indicating that Pm1 belongs to the second type of amino  deaminase. In agreement with this conclusion, the V(max) and K(m) values of Pm1 were 119.7 (μg phenylpyruvic /mg/min) and 31.55 mM phenylalanine, respectively, values lower than those of Pma. The Pml deaminase will be very useful industrially in the preparation of commercially valuable materials including  and α-oxoglutarate.Copyright © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The micelle was based on chitosan-ss-polyethylenimine- (CPU) with dual pH/redox sensitivity and targeting effects. This micelle was produced for codelivering Toll-like receptor 4 siRNA (TLR4-siRNA) and doxorubicin (Dox). In vitro investigation revealed the sustained gene and drug release from Dox-siRNA-loaded micelles under physiological conditions, and this codelivery nanosystem exhibited high dual pH/redox sensitivity, rapid intracellular drug release, and improved cytotoxicity against A549 cells in vitro. Furthermore, the micelles loaded with TLR4-siRNA inhibited the migration and invasion of A549. Excellent tumor penetrating efficacy was also noted in the A549 tumor spheroids and solid tumor slices. In vivo, multiple results demonstrated the excellent tumor-targeting ability of AS1411-chitosan-ss-polyethylenimine- (ACPU) micelle in tumor tissues. The micelles exhibited excellent antitumor efficacy and low toxicity in the systemic circulation in lung-tumor-bearing BALB/c mice. These results conclusively demonstrated the great potential of the new graft copolymer micelle with targeting  for the targeted and efficient codelivery of chemotherapeutic drugs and genes in cancer treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11332040>UVA exposure affects UVB and cis--induced systemic suppression of immune responses in Listeria monocytogenes-infected Balb/c mice.</a></h2><p>Ultraviolet radiation can inhibit immune responses locally as well as systemically. Such effects have been measured in animals and humans exposed to ultraviolet B (wavelength 280-315 nm) (UVB) and ultraviolet A (315-400 nm) (UVA). The precise wavelength dependence is important for the identification of possible molecular targets and for assessments of risk of different artificial UV sources and solar UV. In such analyses, it is commonly assumed that radiation energy from each wavelength contributes to the effect independent of the other wavelengths. Here we show that this assumption does not hold good. In the present study, it was investigated whether exposure to broadband UVA or longwave ultraviolet A 1 (340-400 nm) (UVA 1) prior to the standard immunosuppressive UVB protocol might modulate the immunosuppressive effects induced by UVB. Preexposure to broadband UVA or longwave UVA 1, 1 day prior to the standard immunosuppressive UVB protocol, inhibited the UVB-induced suppression of delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) to Listeria monocytogenes significantly. This effect was not associated with restoring the number of interleukin (IL-12)-positive cells in the spleen. Since isomerization of trans- (UCA) into the immunosuppressive cis-UCA isomer plays a crucial role in UVB-induced immunomodulation, in a second set of experiments it was investigated whether immunosuppression induced by cis-UCA might also be downregulated by preexposure to UVA. Animals were exposed to broad-band UVA or longwave UVA 1 prior to application of an immunosuppressive dose of cis- or trans-UCA as a control. Both UVA and UVA 1 appear to inhibit the cis-UCA-induced systemic immunosuppression (DTH and IL-12) to L. monocytogenes. These studies clearly show that UVA radiation modulates both UVB and cis-UCA-induced immunomodulation. In general, our studies indicate that both broadband UVA and longwave UVA 1 could induce modulation of UVB and cis-UCA-induced immunomodulation. As sunlight contains both UVA and UVB radiation the balance between these two radiations apparently determines the net immunomodulatory effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28338939>It Remains Unknown Whether Filaggrin Gene Mutations Evolved to Increase Cutaneous Synthesis of Vitamin D.</a></h2><p>About 8-10% of normal Northern Europeans are heterozygous carriers of common FLG mutations, while only 1-4% of southern Europeans display these mutations, and only very rarely are mutations detected in African populations. Although mutations are found in Asians, they are different from those encountered in Northern Europeans. Importantly, FLG mutation carriers have 10% increased serum vitamin D concentrations compared to controls. Based on these observations, we have proposed that this latitude-dependent gradient of FLG mutations across Europe, Asia and Africa could have provided an evolutionary advantage for heterozygous FLG mutation carriers, residing at northern latitudes, depletion of the FLG downstream product, trans-, would facilitate the intracutaneous synthesis of vitamin D3 by allowing increased transcutaneous absorption of UVB photons. Such loss-of-function FLG mutations would have provided an evolutionary advantage for modern humans, living in the far North of Europe, where little UV-B penetrates the atomosphere. In a recent article, it was concluded not only that the UVB-Vitamin D3 hypothesis is invalid, but also that FLG genetic variations, including loss-of-function variants, provide little or no impact on the fitness of modern humans. While we welcome studies that reassess our hypothesis, their conclusions are not valid for reasons explained in this letter.© The Author(s) 2017.

In this study, a novel stepwise pH-responsive nanodrug delivery system was developed to efficiently deliver and significantly promote the therapeutic effect of doxorubicin (DOX). The system comprised dimethylmaleic -chitosan- and elicited stepwise responses to extracellular and intracellular pH. The nanoparticles (NPs), which possessed negative surface charge under physiological conditions and an appropriate nanosize, exhibited advantageous stability during blood circulation and enhanced accumulation in tumor sites via enhanced permeability and retention effect. The tumor cellular uptake of DOX-loaded NPs was significantly promoted by the first-step pH response, wherein surface charge reversion of NPs from negative to positive was triggered by the slightly acidic tumor extracellular environment. After internalization into tumor cells, the second-step pH response in endo/lysosome acidic environment elicited the on-demand intracellular release of DOX from NPs, thereby increasing cytotoxicity against tumor cells. Furthermore, stepwise pH-responsive NPs showed enhanced antiproliferation effect and reduced systemic side effect in vivo. Hence, the stepwise pH-responsive NPs provide a promising strategy for efficient delivery of antitumor agents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15301569>Stratum corneum pH in atopic dermatitis: impact on skin barrier function and colonization with Staphylococcus Aureus.</a></h2><p>Recent studies have provided new insights into the occurrence, causes, and pathogenetic consequences of changes in the skin pH in atopic dermatitis, particularly with respect to skin barrier function and colonization with Staphylococcus aureus. Growing evidence suggests an impaired release of proton donors, such as amino acids, , and lactic , to the stratum corneum in atopic dermatitis, as a result of reductions in filaggrin proteolysis and sweat secretion. In addition, an impaired formation of free fatty acids from sebaceous lipids and epidermal phospholipids seems to be involved. Because both lipid organization and lipid  in the stratum corneum requires an acidic pH, these alterations might contribute to the disturbance of skin barrier function observed in atopic dermatitis. Furthermore, bacterial growth and virulence of S. aureus, as well as defensive host mechanisms, have increasingly been delineated as pH dependent, giving rise to a new understanding of the pathophysiology underlying increased skin colonization seen in atopic dermatitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27011348>-modified chitosan nanoparticles can confer anti-inflammatory effect by delivering CD98 siRNA to macrophages.</a></h2><p>CD98 plays an important role in the development and progression of . Here, CD98 siRNA (siCD98) was complexed with -modified chitosan (UAC) to form nanoparticles (NPs), which were transfected into Raw 264.7 macrophages in an effort to convey anti-inflammatory effects. Characterization showed that the generated NPs had a desirable particle size (156.0-247.1nm), a slightly positive zeta potential (15.8-17.5mV), and no apparent cytotoxicity against Raw 264.7 macrophages and colon-26 cells compared to control NPs fabricated by Oligofectamine (OF) and siRNA. Cellular uptake experiments demonstrated that macrophages exhibited a time-dependent accumulation profile of UAC/siRNA NPs. Further in vitro gene silencing experiments revealed that UAC/siCD98 NPs with a weight ratio of 60:1 yielded the most efficient knockdowns of CD98 and the pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF-α. Indeed, the RNAi efficiency obtained with our NPs was even higher than that of the positive control OF/siCD98 NPs. These results suggest that UAC/siCD98 NPs might be a safe, efficient and promising candidate for the treatment of inflammatory disease.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It is our hypothesis that UCA oxidation products in the skin play a role in the process of immunosuppression. Recently, both UCA isomers were found to be good hydroxyl radical scavengers and in this context we investigated the formation of products resulting from the interaction of hydroxyl radicals with UCA. Hydroxyl radicals were generated by (1) UV/H(2)O(2) (photooxidation), (2) ferrous ions/H(2)O(2) (Fenton oxidation) and (3) cupric ions/ascorbic . Oxidation products were identified by spectrometric methods and assessed by reversed-phase HPLC analysis. The photooxidation of UCA was induced by UV-B and UV-C, but not by UV-A radiation. Photooxidation and Fenton oxidation of trans-UCA, as well as of cis-UCA yielded comparable chromatographic patterns of UCA oxidation products. Several of the formed products were identified. The formation of three identified imidazoles was shown in UV-B exposed corneal layer samples, derived from human skin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17473244>Bacillus decisifrondis sp. nov., isolated from soil underlying decaying leaf foliage.</a></h2><p>An aerobic bacterium, designated strain E5HC-32(T), was isolated from soil underlying the decaying leaf litter of a slash pine forest located in south east Queensland, Australia. The strictly aerobic, motile rod-shaped cells (0.8-1.6 x 2.6-4.8 microm) produced subterminal spherical spores which distended the cells. Strain E5HC-32(T) grew optimally in 1 % trypticase soy broth (TSB) at 30 degrees C (temperature range for growth, 25-40 degrees C) and a pH of 8.4 (pH growth range, pH 7.1-9.1). Electron microscopic examination of negatively stained cells revealed the presence of peritrichous flagella and thin sections showed the presence of a typical Gram-positive type cell-wall ultrastructure.

The strong physical stability of UA-GT/PAH-Cit/siRNA NCs (UA-GT NCs) at pH 7.4 and 6.5 endowed protection from massive dilution, competitive ions, and ubiquitous nucleases in the blood and tumorous microenvironment. Their internalization into hepato-carcinoma cells was facilitated through the recognition of galactose receptors, followed by effective escape from endosomes/lysosomes owing to the strong buffering capacity of imidazole residues. At the meantime, the endosomal/lysosomal acidity triggered the charge reversal of PAH-Cit in UA-GT NCs, thus evoking their structural disassembly and subsequently accelerated release of siRNA in the cytosol. As a result, robust in vivo performance in terms of both gene silencing and tumor inhibition was achieved by UA-GT NCs at a low siRNA dose. Moreover, neither histological nor hematological toxicity was detected following repeated intravenous administration. Therefore, UA-GT NCs potentially served as an efficient and safe candidate in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma through knocking down the overall barriers for siRNA delivery.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This review focuses on the potential of serotonin receptors, namely 5-HT1/2A, as therapeutic targets for prevention of photocarcinogenesis. UV-induced immunosuppression is triggered by a cascade of events initiated when cis-, a UV photoreceptor present in the skin, binds to the serotonin receptor. Serotonin receptor antagonists will therefore attempt to block this association, and in turn, prevent skin cancer induction. In addition, 5-HT2A receptor antagonists are also capable of regulating DNA repair, including the acceleration of nucleotide excision repair. At the same time, UV-induced formation of reactive oxygen species is also reduced by these agents. Since the involvement of serotonin in photocarcinogenesis process is somewhat underexplored as a pertinent therapeutic effect, this review intends to reveal the use of serotonergic drugs as an important strategy to prevent and/or inhibit photocarcinogenesis. Considering the emergency of developing novel therapeutic strategies for skin cancer management, the use of these agents, whose benefits have partially been studied, may be crucial especially if topically applied. Topical nanoformulations containing serotonin receptor agonists and/or antagonists also represent a pioneer concept in this area.

DNA photodamage and UV-generated reactive oxygen species are the initial molecular events that lead to most of the typical histological and clinical manifestations of chronic photodamage of the skin. Knowledge of the UV-absorbing chromophores in the skin and of the molecular mechanisms leading to the unwanted effects of sun exposure provide a basis for the development of novel strategies for the prevention and repair of photoageing.

Animal studies have demonstrated that cis-UCA plays a role in UVR-induced immune suppression, but the molecular mechanisms of action of cis-UCA are not fully understood. In this study, we examined changes in gene expression and synthesis of cytokines and PGE2 following UCA treatment of primary human keratinocytes. A limited microarray analysis of keratinocytes from two donors indicated that approximately 400 genes were induced by solar-simulated radiation (SSR), 16 of which were also up-regulated by cis-UCA. In contrast, trans-UCA had little or no effect on gene expression. The genes up-regulated by both cis-UCA and SSR were associated with apoptosis, cell growth arrest, cytokines, and oxidative stress. Further studies using primary keratinocytes from four new donors showed that PG-endoperoxide synthase-2 was dramatically induced by cis-UCA, resulting in an enhanced secretion of PGE2 into the cell culture supernatant. cis-UCA also increased cytokine protein production such as that of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-8 in a dose-dependent manner. SSR had the same effect as cis-UCA, but trans-UCA had no effect. In addition, activation of NF-kappaB and lipid peroxidation were induced by cis-UCA and SSR, but not trans-UCA, suggesting possible upstream events of the gene expression changes. The data suggest that the induction of immune suppression by cis-UCA may involve the initiation of gene transcription of immunomodulatory mediators in primary human keratinocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11669511>Determination of S-[2-carboxy-1-(1H-imidazol-4-yl)ethyl]glutathione, a novel metabolite of L-histidine, in tissue extracts from sunlight-irradiated rat by capillary electrophoresis.</a></h2><p>Exposure of the skin to sunlight results in an increase in the content of epidermal , a key metabolite of L-histidine, and some portions of the metabolite penetrate into the body fluid.

Various catabolites of Cys(CIE) were also isolated from human urine previously. However, no direct evidence to show the existence of GS(CIE) as a biological material had been found. By using capillary electrophoresis, the glutathione adduct has now been found in the extracts of rat tissues from the kidney, liver, skin and blood when the rat was kept under conditions of sunlight irradiation after the fur on the dorsal skin had been clipped. On the other hand, no or a trace of GS(CIE) was determined in rat tissue extracts when the animal was kept indoor in usual manner. The glutathione adduct was isolated from the kidney extract of the sunlight-irradiated rat using ion-exchangers and high-voltage paper electrophoresis, and determined by fast-atom-bombardment mass spectrometry. These results indicate that GS(CIE) formation actually occurs in the body and that the formation is accelerated by exposing the rat to sunlight irradiation. From these findings, we propose an alternative pathway of histidine  which is initiated by the adduction of  to glutathione to form GS(CIE) and terminates with the formation of the urinary compounds via Cys(CIE).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19216704>Emerging drugs for  atopic dermatitis.</a></h2><p>Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease, affecting 10-20% of children and 2% of adults worldwide. Preventive treatment of AD consists of daily skin hydration and emollient therapy; but the majority of patients still require symptomatic treatment with topical corticosteroids and/or topical calcineurin inhibitors, both of which may be associated with potential long-term side effects. With increasing evidence supporting the role of skin barrier defects in the pathogenesis of AD, there is also a parallel increase in medications that claim to assist barrier repair. The current review discusses some exciting results with these medications, as well as the challenges that lie ahead of them. While barrier repair treatments offer some promise, there continues to be a need for safer anti-inflammatory medications. Some of these medications under investigation are phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors,  oxidation products and IL-4/IL-13 receptor blockers.

There was essentially no oxidation of l-[2-14C]histidine to 14CO2 in homozygous NEUT2 mice, but 52% of the [2-14C]l-histidine dose was recovered in the urine within 24 h. Analysis of urine samples for [14C]formiminoglutamate, the expected excretion product, was negative; however, [14C] was detected. Investigation of histidine catabolism via the folate-dependent deamination pathway revealed no detectable urocanase activity in homozygous NEUT2 mice, while heterozygous NEUT2 mice had 50% urocanase activity compared to normal mice. Histidase and formiminotransferase-cyclodeaminase, also on the histidine deamination pathway, had similar specific activities in normal and NEUT2 mice. Histidine-pyruvate aminotransferase, the first enzyme of the alternate histidine transamination catabolic pathway did not appear to be affected by the loss of urocanase. Based on the excretion of  it is estimated that NEUT2 mice catabolize approximately 40 micromol/day via the deamination pathway.

A blister induced in the rat hind footpad was used to examine the effects of slowly perfused cis- on cutaneous blood flow. cis- but not trans- increased microvascular flow by a mechanism largely dependent on the combined activity of the neuropeptides, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide.

There was a small direct effect of cis- on microvascular blood flow. As both substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide could directly degranulate connective tissue mast cells, this study suggests that cis- indirectly activates mast cells via its effects on peripheral terminals of unmyelinated primary afferent sensory nerves. cis--induced neuropeptides may also contribute to ultraviolet-B-induced cutaneous inflammation and alterations to Langerhans cell activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23075272>Amino  composition, including key derivatives of eccrine sweat: potential biomarkers of certain atopic skin conditions.</a></h2><p>The free amino  (AA) composition of eccrine sweat is different from other biological fluids, for reasons which are not properly understood. We undertook the detailed analysis of the AA composition of freshly isolated pure human eccrine sweat, including some of the key derivatives of AA , to better understand the key biological mechanisms governing its composition. Eccrine sweat was collected from the axillae of 12 healthy subjects immediately upon formation. Free AA analysis was performed using an automatic AA analyser after ninhydrin derivatization. Pyrrolidine-5-carboxylic  (PCA) and  (UCA) levels were determined using GC/MS. The free AA composition of sweat was dominated by the presence of serine accounting for just over one-fifth of the total free AA composition. Glycine was the next most abundant followed by PCA, alanine, citrulline and threonine, respectively. The data obtained indicate that the AA content of sweat bears a remarkable similarity to the AA composition of the epidermal protein profilaggrin. This protein is the key source of free AAs and their derivatives that form a major part of the natural moisturizing factor (NMF) within the stratum corneum (SC) and plays a major role in maintaining the barrier integrity of human skin. As perturbations in the production of NMF can lead to abnormal barrier function and can arise as a consequence of filaggrin genotype, we propose the quantification of AAs in sweat may serve as a non-invasive diagnostic biomarker for certain atopic skin conditions, that is, atopic dermatitis (AD).© 2012 Society of Cosmetic Scientists and the Société Française de Cosmétologie.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22071473>Intragenic copy number variation within filaggrin contributes to the risk of atopic dermatitis with a dose-dependent effect.</a></h2><p>Loss-of-function variants within the filaggrin gene (FLG) increase the risk of atopic dermatitis. FLG also demonstrates intragenic copy number variation (CNV), with alleles encoding 10, 11, or 12 filaggrin monomers; hence, CNV may affect the amount of filaggrin expressed in the epidermis. A total of 876 Irish pediatric atopic dermatitis cases were compared with 928 population controls to test the hypothesis that CNV within FLG affects the risk of atopic dermatitis independently of FLG-null mutations. Cases and controls were screened for CNV and common FLG-null mutations. In this population the 11-repeat allele was most prevalent (allele frequency 51.5%); the 10-repeat allele frequency was 33.9% and the 12-repeat allele frequency was 14.6%. Having excluded FLG mutation carriers, the control group had a significantly higher number of repeats than cases (χ(2) P=0.043), and the odds ratio of disease was reduced by a factor of 0.88 (95% confidence interval 0.78-0.98, P=0.025) for each additional unit of copy number. Breakdown products of filaggrin were quantified in tape-stripped stratum corneum from 31 atopic dermatitis patients and  showed a positive correlation with total copy number. CNV within FLG makes a significant, dose-dependent contribution to atopic dermatitis risk, and therefore treatments to increase filaggrin expression may have therapeutic utility.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16388959>Polypodium leucotomos extract inhibits trans- photoisomerization and photodecomposition.</a></h2><p>In this report, we demonstrate a possible molecular mechanism by which a hydrophilic extract of the leaves of the fern Polypodium leucotomos (Fernblock, PL) blocks ultraviolet (UV)-induced skin photodamage.

Both have negative effects on the protective  of the epidermis and both are connected to each other as is discussed here. In the aging process, the pH rises from ∼5 to ∼5.5-6. The establishment of the skin pH is the joint effort of several independent factors including the activity of sodium-hydrogen antiporters and the presence of lactate, , free fatty acids and melanophores in the outermost layers of the skin. All these elements are under the control of a small ion: calcium. Calcium is organized in the form of a gradient in the epidermis with low concentrations in the stratum basale and peak concentrations in the stratum granulosum. During the aging process, this epidermal gradient collapses. In this chapter, we describe how a drop of calcium in the stratum granulosum affects the expression as well as the activity of proteins and enzymes that are involved in the establishment of the skin pH. This rise of the pH combined with a rearrangement of the cornified envelope is a main driver for a reduced epidermal  in old age leading to an increased prevalence for infections, reduced resistance against mechanical stress and reduced wound healing.© 2018 S.

It is the most frequent inborn  error in Japan. Although the original description included mental retardation and speech impairment, neonatal screening programs have identified the majority of histidinemic patients with normal intelligence. Molecular characteristics of histidase in histidinemia have not been determined, and cytogenetically visible deletions of 12q22-24.1 in which histidase gene resides have not been identified in histidinemic patients. In order to investigate whether individuals with this disorder have small deletions, additions, or point mutations in the histidase gene, we screened genomic DNA isolated from 50 histidinemic individuals who were discovered by the neonatal screening program. The methods employed included polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of exons 1-21 of the histidase gene, followed by mutation detection enhancement gel electrophoresis and sequencing of the PCR products displaying heteroduplex bands. Four missense mutations (R322P, P259L, R206T, and R208L), two exonic polymorphisms (T141T c.423A-->T and P259P c.777A-->G), and two intronic polymorphisms (IVS6-5T-->C and IVS9+25A-->G) were identified. The frequencies of each polymorphism estimated either by dot blot allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization, restriction enzyme digestion, or direct sequencing of the PCR products amplified from 50 unrelated normal individuals were 0.28, 0.30, 0.40, and less than 0.01, respectively. Mutation analysis of one family demonstrated that the patient inherited R322P from the mother and P259L from the father. This report describes the first mutations occurring in the coding region of the histidase structural gene in patients with histidinemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15737207>Ultraviolet A (320-400 nm) modulation of ultraviolet B (290-320 nm)-induced immune suppression is mediated by carbon monoxide.</a></h2><p>Accumulating evidence suggests that suberythemogenic ultraviolet A (UVA) (320-400 nm) exposure protects against the immunosuppressive effect of ultraviolet B (290-320 nm) radiation or its epidermal photoproduct, cis- (cis-UCA). In skin, UVA photoimmunoprotection is mediated by the inducible antioxidant stress enzyme, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which degrades heme into carbon monoxide (CO), iron, and biliverdin (reduced to bilirubin), and is important for cell survival under conditions of oxidative stress. The identity of the HO enzymatic product(s) that provide the immunoprotection is unknown. Here we examine the potential of CO to fulfill this role in hairless mouse skin, utilizing a novel CO-releasing molecule (CO-RM) to deliver CO to the skin topically. The CO-RM released CO gradually from the lotion vehicle during 3 h following its preparation, and between 50 and 500 microM, concentration-dependently protected mice against the suppression of contact hypersensitivity by either solar-simulated UV radiation (SSUVR) or cis-UCA, whereas aged CO-depleted CO-RM was inactive. Thus, the CO-RM treatment mimicked UVA-photoimmunoprotection, and identified HO-released CO as the protective mediator, providing evidence that the murine cutaneous immune system is modulated by this gaseous messenger. Preliminary evidence for involvement of guanylyl cyclase was obtained by treatment of the mouse with its specific inhibitor 1H-(1,2,4)oxadiazolo-(4,3-1)quinoxaline-1-one, which abrogated UVA photoimmunoprotection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18280705>Histidase expression in human epidermal keratinocytes: regulation by differentiation status and all-trans retinoic .</a></h2><p>Histidase (histidine ammonia lyase) converts histidine into , the main ultraviolet (UV) light absorption factor of the stratum corneum. It is unknown if and how histidase is regulated in the epidermis.We have investigated the transcriptional regulation of histidase expression in epidermal keratinocytes.Human epidermal keratinocytes were cultured in vitro and exposed to UV irradiation, a number of cytokines and all-trans retinoic  (ATRA) (1 microM). Keratinocyte differentiation was triggered by maintaining confluent cells in monolayer culture and by establishing three-dimensional skin equivalents. The mRNA expression level of histidase in keratinoytes as well as in the epidermis and other tissues was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Protein expression was determined by Western blot analysis.Human epidermis contained higher levels of histidase transcripts than all other tissues investigated. Expression of histidase strongly increased at the mRNA and protein levels during differentiation of primary keratinocytes in vitro. Treatment of keratinocytes with UVA and UVB did not significantly change the expression level of histidase. By contrast, ATRA suppressed histidase expression almost completely.Our results show that histidase is upregulated during keratinocyte differentiation and that ATRA but not UV irradiation modulates the expression level of histidase. Suppression of histidase-mediated production of  may contribute to the increase in UV sensitivity that is caused by treatment with retinoids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11330718>Studies on the possibility of histidine biosynthesis from histodinol, imidazolepyruvic , imidazoleacetica , and imidazolelactic  by mixed ruminal bacteria, protozoa, and their mixture in vitro.</a></h2><p>The possibility of histidine (His) synthesis using a main biosynthetic pathway involving histidinol (HDL) and also the recycling capability of imidazolic compounds such as imidazolepyruvic  (ImPA), imidazoleacetic  (ImAA), and imidazolelactic  (ImLA) to produce His were investigated using mixed ruminal bacteria (B), protozoa (P), and a mixture of both (BP) in an in vitro system. Rumen microorganisms were anaerobically incubated at 39 degrees C for 18 h with or without each substrate (2 mM) mentioned. His and other related compounds produced in both the supernatants and hydrolyzates of the incubation were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. B, P, and BP suspensions failed to show His synthesizing ability when incubated with HDL. His was synthesized from ImPA by B, P, and BP. Expressed in units "per gram of microbial nitrogen (MN)", ImPA disappearance was greatest in B (72.7 micromol/g MN per hour), followed by BP (33.13 micromol/g MN per hour) and then P (18.6 micromol/g MN per hour) for the 18-h incubation period. The production of His from ImPA in B (240.0, 275.9, and 261.2 micromol/g MN in 6, 12, and 18 h incubation, respectively) was about 3.5 times higher than that in P (67.3, 83.8, and 72.7 micromol/g MN in 6, 12, and 18 h incubation, respectively). Other metabolites produced from ImPA were ImLA, ImAA, histamine (HTM), and  (URA), found in all microbial suspensions. ImLA as a substrate remained without diminution in all microbial suspensions. Although ImAA was found to be degraded to a small extent (3.4-6.3%) only after 18 h incubation, neither His nor other metabolites were detected on the chromatograms. These results have been demonstrated for the first time in rumen microorganisms and suggest that His may be an essential amino  for rumen microorganisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18292300>Sweat electrolyte concentrations obtained from within occlusive coverings are falsely high because sweat itself leaches skin electrolytes.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29465390>New nature-inspired  mimic preventing DNA damages and immunosuppressive signalling induced by ultraviolet-B radiations.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9764858> binds to GABA but not to histamine (H1, H2, or H3) receptors.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19209157>Eczema genetics: current state of knowledge and future goals.</a></h2><p>Multiple genetic as well as environmental factors interact in the pathogenesis of eczema. Increased understanding of genetic predisposition in atopy and eczema has directed interest toward key pathogenic mechanisms including skin barrier dysfunction. This review provides a succinct update on the current state of knowledge regarding eczema genetics. We discuss the relevance of loss-of-function mutations in the filaggrin gene within the context of other candidate gene studies and suggest possible applications for future research. Knowledge of genetic factors in eczema may translate into a clearer understanding of pathogenic mechanisms and hence more focused therapeutic strategies, but this remains at present a distant possibility.</p></html>
