Curcumin has poor aqueous solubility, poor stability in the gastrointestinal tract and poor bioavailability. The purpose of the study was to prepare and evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of solid lipid microparticles (SLMs) of curcumin for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease in a -induced rat model by a colon-specific delivery approach.We have developed a novel formulation approach for treating experimental  in the rat model. SLMs of curcumin were prepared with various lipids, such as , stearic  and soya lecithin, with an optimized percentage of poloxamer 188. The SLMs of curcumin were characterized for particle size, drug content, drug entrapment, in-vitro release, surface morphology and infrared, differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray studies. The colonic delivery system of SLM formulations of curcumin were further investigated for their anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory activity using chick embryo and rat  models.Particle size, drug content, drug entrapment and in-vitro release studies showed that formulation F4 containing one part stearic  and 0.5% surfactant had the smallest diameter of 108 microm, 79.24% entrapment and exhibited excellent in-vitro release characteristics when compared with other formulations and pure curcumin. SLMs of curcumin (F4) proved to be a potent angio-inhibitory compound, as demonstrated by inhibition of angiogenesis in the chorioallantoic membrane assay. Rats treated with curcumin and its SLM complex showed a faster weight gain compared with dextran sulfate solution (DSS) control rats. The increase in whole colon length appeared to be significantly greater in SLM-treated rats when compared with pure curcumin and DSS control rats. An additional finding in the DSS-treated rats was chronic cell infiltration with predominance of eosinophils. Decreased mast cell numbers in the mucosa of the colon of SLMs of curcumin and pure curcumin-treated rats was observed.The degree of  caused by administration of DSS was significantly attenuated by colonic delivery of SLMs of curcumin. Being a nontoxic natural dietary product, curcumin could be useful in the therapeutic strategy for inflammatory bowel disease patients.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24818658>Palmitoylethanolamide normalizes intestinal motility in a model of post-inflammatory accelerated transit: involvement of CB₁ receptors and TRPV1 channels.</a></h2><p>Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), a naturally occurring acylethanolamide chemically related to the endocannabinoid anandamide, interacts with targets that have been identified in peripheral nerves controlling gastrointestinal motility, such as cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors, TRPV1 channels and PPARα. Here, we investigated the effect of PEA in a mouse model of functional accelerated transit which persists after the resolution of colonic inflammation (post-inflammatory irritable bowel syndrome).Intestinal inflammation was induced by intracolonic administration of oil of mustard (OM). Mice were tested for motility and biochemical and molecular biology changes 4 weeks later. PEA, oleoylethanolamide and endocannabinoid levels were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and receptor and enzyme mRNA expression by qRT-PCR.OM induced transient  and a functional post-inflammatory increase in upper gastrointestinal transit, associated with increased intestinal anandamide (but not 2-arachidonoylglycerol, PEA or oleoylethanolamide) levels and down-regulation of mRNA for TRPV1 channels. Exogenous PEA inhibited the OM-induced increase in transit and tended to increase anandamide levels.  had a weaker effect on transit. Inhibition of transit by PEA was blocked by rimonabant (CB1 receptor antagonist), further increased by 5'-iodoresiniferatoxin (TRPV1 antagonist) and not significantly modified by the PPARα antagonist GW6471.Intestinal endocannabinoids and TRPV1 channel were dysregulated in a functional model of accelerated transit exhibiting aspects of post-inflammatory irritable bowel syndrome. PEA counteracted the accelerated transit, the effect being mediated by CB1 receptors (possibly via increased anandamide levels) and modulated by TRPV1 channels.© 2014 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27573241>Branched Fatty  Esters of Hydroxy Fatty Acids (FAHFAs) Protect against  by Regulating Gut Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses.</a></h2><p>We recently discovered a structurally novel class of endogenous lipids, branched  esters of hydroxy stearic acids (PAHSAs), with beneficial metabolic and anti-inflammatory effects. We tested whether PAHSAs protect against , which is a chronic inflammatory disease driven predominantly by defects in the innate mucosal barrier and adaptive immune system. There is an unmet clinical need for safe and well tolerated oral therapeutics with direct anti-inflammatory effects. Wild-type mice were pretreated orally with vehicle or 5-PAHSA (10 mg/kg) and 9-PAHSA (5 mg/kg) once daily for 3 days, followed by 10 days of either 0% or 2% dextran sulfate sodium water with continued vehicle or PAHSA treatment. The colon was collected for histopathology, gene expression, and flow cytometry. Intestinal crypt fractions were prepared for ex vivo bactericidal assays. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells pretreated with vehicle or PAHSA and splenic CD4 T cells from syngeneic mice were co-cultured to assess antigen presentation and T cell activation in response to LPS. PAHSA treatment prevented weight loss, improved  scores (stool consistency, hematochezia, and mouse appearance), and augmented intestinal crypt Paneth cell bactericidal potency via a mechanism that may involve GPR120. In vitro, PAHSAs attenuated dendritic cell activation and subsequent T cell proliferation and Th1 polarization. The anti-inflammatory effects of PAHSAs in vivo resulted in reduced colonic T cell activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression. These anti-inflammatory effects appear to be partially GPR120-dependent. We conclude that PAHSA treatment regulates innate and adaptive immune responses to prevent mucosal damage and protect against .

Palmatine is a herb derived isoquinoline alkaloid with potent anti-inflammatory and anti-bacteria activities. In present study, we evaluated the effect of palmatine on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced mice  and examined whether its effect is exerted by promoting mitophagy-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome inactivation. The result showed that palmatine (40, 100 mg/kg) significantly prevented bodyweight loss and colonic shortening in DSS mice, and reduced the disease activity index and histopathologic score. The levels of MPO, IL-1β, TNF-α and the number of F4/80+ cells in colon of DSS mice were remarkably decreased by palmatine. Moreover, palmatine suppressed NLRP3 inflammasomes activation, but enhanced the expression of the mitophagy-related proteins involving LC3, PINK1 and Parkin in colonic tissue of DSS mice. These effects was consistent with the in vitro data revealing that palmatine inhibited the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes, while promoted the expression and mitochondrial recruitment of PINK1 and Parkin in THP-1 cell differentiated macrophages. Furthermore, the effect of palmatine on THP-1 cells was neutralized by a mitophagy inhibitor Cyclosporin A (CsA) and PINK1-siRNA. In parallel, CsA significantly attenuated the therapeutic effect of palmatine in DSS mice, illustrating that the anti- effect of palmatine is closely related to mitophagy. Taken together, the current results demonstrated that palmatine protected mice against DSS-induced  by facilitating PINK1/Parkin-driven mitophagy and thus inactivating NLRP3 inflammasomes in macrophage.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast,  esterified to the sn-2 position (beta-palmitate), the main palmitate conformation in human milk fat, is well absorbed. The aim of the present study was to examine the influence of high alpha, alpha'-palmitate fat (HAPF) diet and high beta-palmitate fat (HBPF) diet on  development in Muc2 deficient (Muc2(-/-)) mice, a well-described animal model for spontaneous enterocolitis due to the lack of a protective mucus layer.Muc2(-/-) mice received AIN-93G reference diet, HAPF diet or HBPF diet for 5 weeks after weaning. Clinical symptoms, intestinal morphology and inflammation in the distal colon were analyzed.Both HBPF diet and AIN-93G diet limited the extent of intestinal erosions and morphological damage in Muc2(-/-) mice compared with HAPF diet. In addition, the immunosuppressive regulatory T (Treg) cell response as demonstrated by the up-regulation of Foxp3, Tgfb1 and Ebi3 gene expression levels was enhanced by HBPF diet compared with AIN-93G and HAPF diets. HBPF diet also increased the gene expression of Pparg and enzymatic antioxidants (Sod1, Sod3 and Gpx1), genes all reported to be involved in promoting an immunosuppressive Treg cell response and to protect against .This study shows for the first time that HBPF diet limits the intestinal mucosal damage and controls the inflammatory response in Muc2(-/-) mice by inducing an immunosuppressive Treg cell response.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25205418>Palmitoylethanolamide, a naturally occurring lipid, is an orally effective intestinal anti-inflammatory agent.</a></h2><p>Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) acts via several targets, including cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors, transient receptor potential vanilloid type-1 (TRPV1) ion channels, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR α) and orphan G protein-coupled receptor 55 (GRR55), all involved in the control of intestinal inflammation.

The goal of the current study was to explore the effects of adelmidrol, an analog of the anti-inflammatory fatty  amide signaling molecule palmitoylethanolamide, in mice subjected to experimental . Additionally, to clarify whether the protective action of adelmidrol is dependent on the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), we investigated the effects of a PPARγ antagonist, GW9662, on adelmidrol action. Adelmidrol (10 mg/kg daily, o.s.) was tested in a murine experimental model of  induced by intracolonic administration of dinitrobenzene sulfonic . Nuclear factor-κB translocation, cyclooxygenase-2, and phosphoextracellular signal-regulated kinase, as well as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β, were significantly increased in colon tissues after dinitrobenzene sulfonic  administration. Immunohistochemical staining for ICAM-1, P-selectin, nitrotyrosine, and poly(ADP)ribose showed a positive staining in the inflamed colon. Treatment with adelmidrol decreased diarrhea, body weight loss, and myeloperoxidase activity. Adelmidrol treatment, moreover, reduced nuclear factor-κB translocation, cyclooxygenase-2, and phosphoextracellular signal-regulated kinase expression; proinflammatory cytokine release; and the incidence of nitrotyrosine and poly(ADP)ribose in the colon. It also decreased the upregulation of ICAM-1 and P-selectin. Adelmidrol treatment produced a reduction of Bax and an intensification of Bcl-2 expression. This study clearly demonstrates that adelmidrol exerts important anti-inflammatory effects that are partly dependent on PPARγ, suggesting that this molecule may represent a new pharmacologic approach for inflammatory bowel disease treatment.Copyright © 2016 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14519964>Ethanol fraction of Aralia elata Seemann enhances antioxidant activity and lowers serum lipids in rats when administered with benzo(a)pyrene.</a></h2><p>Aralia elata Seemann is an edible mountain vegetable in Korea containing saponin, alkaloid, , linoleic , methyl eicosanoate and hexacosol, and is known to manifest an effect on cardiac infarction, gastric ulcer, , and enervation. This study has examined the effects of Aralia elata Seemann ethanol extract on antioxidant enzyme systems and lipid metabolism in rats along with benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) administration. Rats were divided into four groups: control (C), an extract fed group (CE), a B(a)P fed group (CB), and a B(a)P and extract fed group (CBE). The ethanol extracts of Aralia elata Seemann (50 mg/kg body weight) were fed to the rats for 4 weeks by stomach tubing. Extract administration increased the antioxidant activities of glutathione sulfur transferase (GST). Total superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Cu,Zn-SOD activities were stimulated. Catalase activities were increased by 50% with extract feeding. Cu,Zn-SOD was greatly enhanced from 0.10 unit to 0.18 unit and catalase activity also was increased. Serum alpha-tocopherol was markedly increased by the extracts. The ethanol fraction of Aralia elata Seemann decreased total serum cholesterol. However, serum HDL-cholesterol was increased by 35% (p<0.05).

We also describe the level of incorporation of  (16:0), linoleic (18:2n-6), and eicosapentaenoic (EPA) acids (20:5n-3) and their higher homologues into cytosolic and membrane lipids during long-term (10 days) medium supplementation in fully differentiated 16- to 18-day-old cultures. CaCo-2 monolayers reached confluency by day 6 with subsequent development of microvilli and maximal expression of microvillus membrane sucrose, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyltransaminase occurring between days 16 and 23 after plating. There was evidence of the presence and modulation of delta 9, delta 6, and delta 5 desaturase activity (delta 9 > delta 6 > delta 5). delta 6 Desaturase activity decreased approximately 2-fold between days 6 and 24 of culture and when the fetal bovine serum concentration was increased from 0.5% to 25%; in contrast, when cells were starved for 72 h, activity increased 5.4-fold. When the media was supplemented with either linoleic  and/or EPA, both delta 6 and delta 5 desaturase activities were inhibited, the greatest reduction of delta 5 desaturase activity occurring with EPA. Incorporation of media fatty acids plus their desaturase and elongase products was highly dependent on medium composition with the homologues of delta 9 > delta 6 > delta 5. Supplementation of cellular media with 100 microM EPA for 10 days decreased membrane phosphatidylethanolamine arachidonic  level from 13.2 to 8.9%. From these results we conclude that enterocyte membrane fatty  composition and desaturase enzyme activity are regulated by both dietary fat intake and cell maturation. The clinical relevance of these observations on lipid dietary modification for the management of chronic inflammatory bowel disease is still uncertain but these observations suggest that the beneficial effects of EPA supplements on human ulcerative  may be due to a reduction in enterocyte arachidonic  content by down-regulation of delta 6 and delta 5 desaturase activity.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28526351>Docosahexaenoyl serotonin emerges as most potent inhibitor of IL-17 and CCL-20 released by blood mononuclear cells from a series of N-acyl serotonins identified in human intestinal tissue.</a></h2><p>Fatty  amides (FAAs), conjugates of fatty acids with ethanolamine, mono-amine neurotransmitters or amino acids are a class of molecules that display diverse functional roles in different cells and tissues. Recently we reported that one of the serotonin-fatty  conjugates, docosahexaenoyl serotonin (DHA-5-HT), previously found in gut tissue of mouse and pig, attenuates the IL-23-IL-17 signaling axis in LPS-stimulated mice macrophages. However, its presence and effects in humans remained to be elucidated. Here, we report for the first time its identification in human intestinal (colon) tissue, along with a series of related N-acyl serotonins. Furthermore, we tested these fatty  conjugates for their ability to inhibit the release of IL-17 and CCL-20 by stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Serotonin conjugates with  (PA-5-HT), stearic  (SA-5-HT) and oleic  (OA-5-HT) were detected in higher levels than arachidonoyl serotonin (AA-5-HT) and DHA-5-HT, while eicosapentaenoyl serotonin (EPA-5-HT) could not be quantified. Among these, DHA-5-HT was the most potent in inhibiting IL-17 and CCL-20, typical Th17 pro-inflammatory mediators, by Concanavalin A (ConA)-stimulated human PBMCs. These results underline the idea that DHA-5-HT is a gut-specific endogenously produced mediator with the capacity to modulate the IL-17/Th17 signaling response.

Currently, only supportive treatment is available for diagnosed patients. We show here that 24-h pretreatment with an ether lipid precursor, the alkylglycerol sn-1-O-hexadecylglycerol (HG), protects HEp-2 cells against Shiga toxin and Shiga toxin 2. Also the endothelial cell lines HMEC-1 and HBMEC are protected against Shiga toxins after HG pretreatment. In contrast, the corresponding acylglycerol, DL-α-palmitin, has no effect on Shiga toxicity. Although HG treatment provides a strong protection (~30 times higher IC₅₀) against Shiga toxin, only a moderate reduction in toxin binding was observed, suggesting that retrograde transport of the toxin from the plasma membrane to the cytosol is perturbed. Furthermore, endocytosis of Shiga toxin and retrograde sorting from endosomes to the Golgi apparatus remain intact, but transport from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum is inhibited by HG treatment. As previously described, HG reduces the total level of all quantified glycosphingolipids to 50-70% of control, including the Shiga toxin receptor globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), in HEp-2 cells. In accordance with this, we find that interfering with Gb3 biosynthesis by siRNA-mediated knockdown of Gb3 synthase for 24 h causes a similar cytotoxic protection and only a moderate reduction in toxin binding (to 70% of control cells). Alkylglycerols, including HG, have been administered to humans for investigation of therapeutic roles in disorders where ether lipid biosynthesis is deficient, as well as in cancer therapy.

The actions of PEA are terminated following hydrolysis by 2 enzymes: fatty  amide hydrolase (FAAH), and the less-studied N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing  amidase (NAAA). This study aims to investigate the effects of inhibiting the enzymes responsible for PEA hydrolysis in colon inflammation in order to propose a potential therapeutic target for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Two murine models of IBD were used to assess the effects of NAAA inhibition, FAAH inhibition, and PEA on macroscopic signs of colon inflammation, macrophage/neutrophil infiltration, and the expression of proinflammatory mediators in the colon, as well as on the -related systemic inflammation. NAAA inhibition increases PEA levels in the colon and reduces colon inflammation and systemic inflammation, similarly to PEA. FAAH inhibition, however, does not increase PEA levels in the colon and does not affect the macroscopic signs of colon inflammation or immune cell infiltration. This is the first report of an anti-inflammatory effect of a systemically administered NAAA inhibitor. Because NAAA is the enzyme responsible for the control of PEA levels in the colon, we put forth this enzyme as a potential therapeutic target in chronic inflammation in general and IBD in particular.© FASEB.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31411504>High-fat diet promotes experimental  by inducing oxidative stress in the colon.</a></h2><p>Diets high in animal fats are associated with increased risks of inflammatory bowel disease, but the mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of high-fat diet (HFD) on the development of experimental  in mice. Relative to mice fed low-fat diet (LFD), HFD feeding for 4 wk increased the levels of triglyceride, cholesterol, and free fatty acids in the plasma as well as within the colonic mucosa. In an experimental  model induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS), mice on 4-wk HFD exhibited more severe colonic inflammation and developed more severe  compared with the LFD counterparts. HFD feeding resulted in higher production of mucosal pro-inflammatory cytokines, greater activation of the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) tight junction regulatory pathway, and greater increases in mucosal barrier permeability in mice following TNBS induction. HFD feeding also induced gp91, an NADPH oxidase subunit, and promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in both colonic epithelial cells and lamina propria cells. In HCT116 cell culture,  or  and TNF-α combination markedly increased ROS production and induced the MLCK pathway, and these effects were markedly diminished in the presence of a ROS scavenger. Taken together, these data suggest that HFD promotes  by aggravating mucosal oxidative stress, which rapidly drives mucosal inflammation and increases intestinal mucosal barrier permeability. This study demonstrates high-fat diet feeding promotes  in a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic -induced experimental  model in mice. The underlying mechanism is that high-fat diet induces oxidative stress in the colonic mucosa, which increases colonic epithelial barrier permeability and drives colonic mucosal inflammation.

Earlier experiments in rodents show that a diet with a higher proportion of palmitate at the sn-2 position of triacylglycerols improves dietary fat and calcium absorption compared with a diet with a lower sn-2 palmitate content. A high-sn-2 palmitate diet increased fecal short-chain fatty acids, reduced gut inflammation in a  model, and altered tissue endocannabinoid concentrations in laboratory rodents. Recent studies in infants confirm that formula with a high sn-2 palmitate content reduces stool fat, , fat soaps, palmitate soaps, and calcium compared with formula with a low sn-2 palmitate content. These effects have been associated with improved bone strength, increased fecal bifidobacteria, and reduced crying in infants. In some studies, findings with formula high in sn-2 palmitate match those seen in breast-fed infants. However, in many studies, high sn-2 palmitate formula remains inferior to breast-feeding. It is concluded that infant formula high in sn-2 palmitate is superior to formula with low sn-2 palmitate but does not fully match human breast milk. Recent studies showing altered gut microbiota (human infants) and tissue endocannabinoids (rodent model) suggest the potential for marked physiological impact of high sn-2 palmitate that needs to be explored further in human trials.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.
