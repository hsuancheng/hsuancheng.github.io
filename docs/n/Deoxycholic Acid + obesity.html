Cohort was divided into two groups: primary (n 104)- persons with  and excess weight, and the comparison group (n = 27) - people with normal body weight. All patients had been appointed drug Pantoprazole. Additionally we were recruited 20 patients followed by randomization to monotherapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), or a combination with ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA).Individuals both group often complained of regurgitation <~bitter?

The effect of  on the function of BM-MSCs is currently unknown. Here, we assessed how  affects the function of BM-MSCs and the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) therein. BM-MSCs were obtained from healthy donors with a normal (<25) or high (>30) body mass index (BMI). High-BMI BM-MSCs displayed severely impaired osteogenic and diminished adipogenic differentiation, decreased proliferation rates, increased senescence, and elevated expression of ER stress-related genes ATF4 and CHOP. Suppression of ER stress using tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) and 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) resulted in partial recovery of osteogenic differentiation capacity, with a significant increase in the expression of ALPL and improvement in the UPR. These data indicate that BMI is important during the selection of BM-MSC donors for regenerative medicine purposes and that application of high-BMI BM-MSCs with TUDCA or 4-PBA may improve stem cell function. However, whether this improvement can be translated into an in vivo clinical advantage remains to be assessed.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26579441>Bile acids and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 in hepatic lipid metabolism.</a></h2><p>The liver is the central organ involved in lipid metabolism. Dyslipidemia and its related disorders, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD),  and other metabolic diseases, are of increasing public health concern due to their increasing prevalence in the population. Besides their well-characterized functions in cholesterol homoeostasis and nutrient absorption, bile acids are also important metabolic regulators and function as signaling hormones by activating specific nuclear receptors, G-protein coupled receptors, and multiple signaling pathways. Recent studies identified a new signaling pathway by which conjugated bile acids (CBA) activate the extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK1/2) and protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway via sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2). CBA-induced activation of S1PR2 is a key regulator of sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2) and hepatic gene expression.

Agarose is hydrolyzed easily to yield oligosaccharides, designated as agaro-oligosaccharides (AGO). This study evaluated the effects of AGO on obese phenotype and gut microbial composition in mice. Mice were administered AGO in drinking water (AGO-receiving mice). 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyses revealed their fecal microbiota profiles. Serum bile acids were ascertained using a LC-MS/MS system. Compared to the control group, AGO administration significantly reduced epididymal adipose tissue weights and serum non-esterified fatty  concentrations, but the cecal content weights were increased. Data from the serum bile  profile show that concentrations of primary bile acids (cholic  and chenodeoxycholic ), but not those of secondary bile acids (, lithocholic , and ursodeoxycholic ), tended to increase in AGO-receiving mice. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyses showed that the relative abundances of 15 taxa differed significantly in AGO-receiving mice. Of these, the relative abundances of Rikenellaceae and Lachnospiraceae were found to be positively correlated with epididymal adipose tissue weight. The relative abundances of Bacteroides and Ruminococcus were correlated negatively with epididymal adipose tissue weight.

Here, we explore a role for this axis in mechanisms underlying diet-induced  (DIO).Intestinal uroguanylin expression and secretion, and hypothalamic GUCY2C expression and anorexigenic signaling, were quantified in mice on high-calorie diets for 14 weeks. The role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in suppressing uroguanylin in DIO was explored using tunicamycin, an inducer of ER stress, and tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), a chemical chaperone that inhibits ER stress. The impact of consumed calories on uroguanylin expression was explored by dietary manipulation. The role of uroguanylin in mechanisms underlying  was examined using Camk2a-Cre-ER(T2)-Rosa-STOP(loxP/loxP)-Guca2b mice in which tamoxifen induces transgenic hormone expression in brain.DIO suppressed intestinal uroguanylin expression and eliminated its postprandial secretion into the circulation. DIO suppressed uroguanylin through ER stress, an effect mimicked by tunicamycin and blocked by TUDCA. Hormone suppression by DIO reflected consumed calories, rather than the pathophysiological milieu of , as a diet high in calories from carbohydrates suppressed uroguanylin in lean mice, whereas calorie restriction restored uroguanylin in obese mice. However, hypothalamic GUCY2C, enriched in the arcuate nucleus, produced anorexigenic signals mediating satiety upon exogenous agonist administration, and DIO did not impair these responses. Uroguanylin replacement by transgenic expression in brain repaired the hormone insufficiency and reconstituted satiety responses opposing DIO and its associated comorbidities, including visceral adiposity, glucose intolerance and hepatic steatosis.These studies reveal a novel pathophysiological mechanism contributing to  in which calorie-induced suppression of intestinal uroguanylin impairs hypothalamic mechanisms regulating food consumption through loss of anorexigenic endocrine signaling.

However, an increase in the production of secondary BA modulates the intestinal microbiota due to the bactericidal effects and promotes cancer risk in the liver and colon. The ingestion of Bacillus coagulans improves constipation via the activation of bowel movement to promote defaecation in humans, which may alter BA metabolism in the intestinal contents. BA secretion is promoted with high-fat diet consumption, and the ratio of cholic  (CA):chenodeoxycholic  in primary BA increases with ageing. The dietary supplementation of CA mimics the BA environment in diet-induced  and ageing. We investigated whether B. coagulans lilac-01 and soya pulp influence both BA metabolism and the maintenance of host health in CA-supplemented diet-fed rats. In CA-fed rats, soya pulp significantly increased the production of secondary BA such as  and ω-muricholic acids, and soya pulp ingestion alleviated problems related to plasma adiponectin and gut permeability in rats fed the CA diet. The combination of B. coagulans and soya pulp successfully suppressed the increased production of secondary BA in CA-fed rats compared with soya pulp itself, without impairing the beneficial effects of soya pulp ingestion.

However, it is still unclear how FXR agonists protect against NASH and which cell type is the main target of FXR agonists. In this study, we examined the effects of OCA on the development of NASH using melanocortin 4 receptor-deficient (MC4R-KO) mice that progressively developed hepatic steatosis and NASH on Western diet (WD). Treatment with OCA effectively prevented chronic inflammation and liver fibrosis in WD-fed MC4R-KO mice with only marginal effect on body weight and hepatic steatosis. Hepatic crown-like structure (hCLS) is a unique histological structure characteristic of NASH, which triggers hepatocyte death-induced interstitial fibrosis. Intriguingly, treatment with OCA markedly reduced hCLS formation even after MC4R-KO mice developed NASH, thereby inhibiting the progression of liver fibrosis. As its mechanism of action, OCA suppressed metabolic stress-induced p53 activation and cell death in hepatocytes.

The relative proportion of each BA in total BAs was calculated.In the metabolic surgery study, RYGB was effective in the reduction of body weight in both remission and nonremission groups. The reductions of body mass index (BMI) in both groups were 7.34 ± 2.10 kg/m(2) and 6.31 ± 2.38 kg/m(2), respectively (P = .14). Patients in the remission group had a shorter duration of diabetes, lower glycated hemoglobin, and higher C-peptide and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) proportion at baseline compared with the nonremission group. Multiple logistic regression indicated that a higher level of CDCA relative to total BA (CDCA%) and shorter duration of diabetes at baseline were associated with a greater chance of diabetes remission. The odd ratios were 0.19 (95% confidence interval 0.05-0.74) and 1.77 (95% confidence interval 1.13-2.76), respectively, after adjustment for age, gender, and BMI. In the cross-sectional study, CDCA% was significantly higher in obese individuals with T2DM than the normal glucose tolerance group. Correlation analysis showed CDCA% was positively correlated with BMI, glycated hemoglobin, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and negatively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and diabetes duration.Increased CDCA, a major primary BA, was correlated with a shorter duration of T2DM, which was associated with a higher possibility of remission after surgery.

Bile acids (BAs) bind to the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5), which are involved in lipid and glucose metabolism and energy expenditure. The present study aimed to determine associations between the circulating BAs and the skeletal muscle volume (SMV), and lipid and glucose metabolism in patients with NAFLD. Methods Serum BAs and metabolic parameters were measured in 55 patients with NAFLD (median age, 55 years). The changes (Δ) in serum BA (ΔBA) and metabolic parameters were determined in 17 patients (male, n=10; female, n=7) who received nutritional counseling for 12 months. Results Spearman's test revealed that the levels of 12α-hydroxysterol (12α-OH) BAs, including  (DCA), were inversely correlated with the SMV of the upper and lower limbs and the total SMV. A multivariate analysis revealed that the level of DCA was correlated with a reduced total SMV, whereas non-12α-OH BAs, including chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), were correlated with an increased SMV of the lower limbs. Changes in CDCA were positively correlated with the ΔSMV of the lower limbs, and inversely correlated with the Δwaist-hip ratio and Δtotal cholesterol. Changes in the total non-12α-OH BA level were positively correlated with the ΔSMV of the lower limbs. Conclusion Circulating BAs were associated with SMV.

Injection of a formula comprising phosphatidylcholine (PPC) and deoxycholate (DC) has emerged as an alternative to liposuction in the reduction of local fat deposits. However, the formula component mainly responsible for this effect and the mechanism behind the actions of the components with respect to fat reduction are unknown. Here, we investigate the specific effects of PPC and DC on adipocyte viability. When exposed to PPC or DC, 3T3L1 preadipocytes and differentiated adipocytes showed dose dependent decrease in cell viability. Interestingly, while DC mediated cell death was non-specific to both preadipocytes and adipocytes, PPC specifically induced a decrease in mature adipocyte viability, but had less effect on preadipocytes. Injection of PPC and DC into inguinal fat pads caused reduction in size. PPC injections preferentially decreased gene expression in mature adipocytes, while a strong inflammatory response was elicited by DC injection. In line with the decreased adipocyte viability, exposure of differentiated adipocytes to PPC resulted in triglyceride release, with a minimal effect on free fatty acids release, suggesting that its fat-reducing effect mediated mainly through the induction of adipocyte cell death rather than lipolysis. Taken together, it appears that PPC specifically affects adipocytes, and has less effect on preadipocyte viability.

Here we aimed to explore the molecular and biochemical mechanisms of ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) in modulating the cross-talk between liver and visceral white adipose tissue (vWAT) regarding BA and cholesterol metabolism and fatty /lipid partitioning in morbidly obese NAFLD patients.In this randomized controlled pharmacodynamic study, we analyzed serum, liver and vWAT samples from 40 well-matched morbidly obese patients receiving UDCA (20 mg/kg/day) or no treatment three weeks prior to bariatric surgery.Short term UDCA administration stimulated BA synthesis by reducing circulating fibroblast growth factor 19 and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) activation, resulting in cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase induction mirrored by elevated C4 and 7α-hydroxycholesterol. Enhanced BA formation depleted hepatic and LDL-cholesterol with subsequent activation of the key enzyme of cholesterol synthesis 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase. Blunted FXR anti-lipogenic effects induced lipogenic stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) in the liver, thereby increasing hepatic triglyceride content. In addition, induced SCD activity in vWAT shifted vWAT lipid metabolism towards generation of less toxic and more lipogenic monounsaturated fatty acids such as oleic .These data demonstrate that by exerting FXR-antagonistic effects, UDCA treatment in NAFLD patients strongly impacts on cholesterol and BA synthesis and induces neutral lipid accumulation in both liver and vWAT.Copyright © 2015 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Recently, metformin was reported to alter the gut microbiota community in humans, suggesting that the hyperglycemia-lowering action of the drug could be the result of modulating the population of gut microbiota. However, the critical microbial signaling metabolites and the host targets associated with the metabolic benefits of metformin remained elusive. Here, we performed metagenomic and metabolomic analysis of samples from individuals with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D) naively treated with metformin for 3 d, which revealed that Bacteroides fragilis was decreased and the bile  glycoursodeoxycholic  (GUDCA) was increased in the gut. These changes were accompanied by inhibition of intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling. We further found that high-fat-diet (HFD)-fed mice colonized with B. fragilis were predisposed to more severe glucose intolerance, and the metabolic benefits of metformin treatment on glucose intolerance were abrogated. GUDCA was further identified as an intestinal FXR antagonist that improved various metabolic endpoints in mice with established .

A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Cochrane library, and Scopus databases, in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Eight studies met the inclusion criteria incorporating 1355 patients. Random-effects meta-analysis showed a lower incidence of gallstone formation in patients taking UDCA. Subgroup analysis reported fewer cases of gallstone disease in the UDCA group in relation to different bariatric procedures, doses of administered UDCA, and time from bariatric surgery. Adverse events were similar in both groups. Fewer patients required cholecystectomy in UDCA group. No deaths were reported.

This report describes a comprehensive investigation of the effect of agaro-oligosaccharides (AGO) on HFD-induced gut dysbiosis, including alterations in short-chain fatty  contents and bile  metabolism in mice. C57BL/6N mice were fed a control diet or HFD, with or without AGO. Terminal restriction fragment-length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis produced their fecal microbiota profiles. Profiles of cecal organic acids and serum bile acids were determined, respectively, using HPLC and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry systems. T-RFLP analyses showed that an HFD changed the gut microbiota significantly. Changes in the microbiota composition induced by an HFD were characterized by a decrease in the order Lactobacillales and by an increase in the Clostridium subcluster XIVa. These changes of the microbiota community generated by HFD treatment were suppressed by AGO supplementation. As supported by the data of the proportion of Lactobacillales order, the concentration of lactic  increased in the HFD + AGO group. Data from the serum bile  profile showed that the level of , a carcinogenic secondary bile  produced by gut bacteria, was increased in HFD-receiving mice. The upregulation tended to be suppressed by AGO supplementation. Finally, results show that AGO supplementation suppressed the azoxymethane-induced generation of aberrant crypt foci in the colon derived from HFD-treated mice. Our results suggest that oral intake of AGO prevents HFD-induced gut dysbiosis, thereby inhibiting colon carcinogenesis.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28853202>Ursodeoxycholic : Effects on hepatic unfolded protein response, apoptosis and oxidative stress in morbidly obese patients.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is a secondary hydrophilic bile  (BA) used as therapy for a range of hepatobiliary diseases. Its efficacy in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is still under debate. Here, we aimed to decipher molecular mechanisms of UDCA in regulating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis, apoptosis and oxidative stress in morbidly obese patients.In this randomized controlled pharmacodynamic study, liver and serum samples from 40 well-matched morbidly obese NAFLD-patients were analysed. Patients received UDCA (20 mg/kg/d) or no treatment 3 weeks before samples were obtained during bariatric surgery.Patients treated with UDCA displayed higher scoring of steatosis (S), activity (A) and fibrosis (F), the so called SAF-scoring. UDCA partially disrupted ER homeostasis by inducing the expression of the ER stress markers CHOP and GRP78. However, ERDJ4 and sXBP1 levels were unaffected. Enhanced CHOP expression, a suggested pro-apoptotic trigger, failed to induce apoptosis via BAK and BAX in the UDCA treated group. Potentially pro-apoptotic miR-34a was reduced in the vesicle-free fraction in serum but not in liver after UDCA treatment. Thiobarbituric  reactive substances, 4-hydroxynonenal and mRNA levels of several oxidative stress indicators remained unchanged after UDCA treatment.Our data suggest that UDCA treatment has ambivalent effects in NAFLD patients. While increased SAF-scores and elevated CHOP levels may be disadvantageous in the UDCA treated cohort, UDCA's cytoprotective properties potentially changed the apoptotic threshold as reflected by absent induction of pro-apoptotic triggers.

Total and glycine-amidated BAs increase after sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and correlate to improved metabolic disease. No specific bile  subtype has been shown conclusively to mediate the weight loss effect. Therefore, the objective of this study was to prospectively evaluate the comprehensive changes in meal-stimulated BAs after SG and determine if a specific change in the BA profile correlates to the early weight loss response.Patients were prospectively enrolled at the University of Nebraska Medical Center who were undergoing a SG for treatment of morbid . Primary and secondary plasma bile acids and their amidated (glycine, G-, or taurine, T-) subtypes were measured at fasting, 30 and 60 min after a liquid meal performed pre-op, and at 6 and 12 weeks post-op. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for the hour meal test for each bile  subtype. BAs that were significantly increased post-op were correlated to body mass index (BMI) loss.Total BA AUC was significantly increased at 6 (p < 0.01) and 12 weeks post-op (p < 0.01) compared to pre-operative values. The increase in total BA AUC was due to a statistically significant increase in G-BAs. Nine different BA AUC subtypes were significantly increased at both 6 and 12 weeks post-op. Increased total and G-chenodeoxycholic  AUC was significantly correlated to the 6 week BMI loss (p = 0.03). Increased G-hyocholic  was significantly correlated to increased weight loss at both 6 (p = 0.05) and 12 weeks (p = 0.006).SG induced an early and persistent post-prandial surge in multiple bile  subtypes. Increased G-hyocholic consistently correlated with greater early BMI loss.

The purpose of this study was to elucidate the action mechanisms underlying the protective effects of UDCA and vitamin E against liver dysfunction using metabolomics and metagenomic analysis. In this study, we analysed blood and urine samples from patients with  and liver dysfunction. Nine patients were randomly assigned to receive UDCA (300 mg twice daily), and 10 subjects received vitamin E (400 IU twice daily) for 8 weeks. UDCA significantly improved the liver function scores after 4 weeks of treatment and effectively reduced hepatic  and serum microRNA-122 levels. To better understand its protective mechanism, a global metabolomics study was conducted, and we found that UDCA regulated uremic toxins (hippuric , p-cresol sulphate, and indole-derived metabolites), antioxidants (ascorbate sulphate and N-acetyl-L-cysteine), and the phenylalanine/tyrosine pathway. Furthermore, microbiome involvement, particularly of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, was demonstrated through metagenomic analysis of bacteria-derived extracellular vesicles. Meanwhile, vitamin E treatment did not result in such alterations, except that it reduced uremic toxins and liver dysfunction.

Despite intensive study, no effective simple treatment for these conditions exists. As such, the need for go-to drugs is serious. Bile acids (BAs) present the possibility of reversing these problems, as various in vivo studies and clinical trials have shown significant effects with regard to weight and  reduction, insulin sensitivity restoration and cardiovascular improvements. However, the mechanism of action of BA-induced metabolic improvement has yet to be fully established. The currently most accepted model involves non-shivering thermogenesis for energy waste, but this is disputed. As such, we propose to determine whether the BA chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) can exert anti-obesogenic effects in vitro, independent of thermogenic brown adipose tissue activation. By exposing differentiated 3 T3-L1 adipocytes to high glucose and CDCA, we demonstrate that this BA has anti- effects in vitro. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic analysis of metabolic pathways clearly indicates an improvement in metabolic status, as these cells become more oxidative rather than glycolytic, which may be associated with an increase in fatty  oxidation. Our work demonstrates that CDCA-induced metabolic alterations occur in white and brown adipocytes and are not totally dependent on endocrine/nervous system signaling, as thought until now. Furthermore, future exploration of the mechanisms behind these effects will undoubtedly reveal interesting targets for clinical modulation.Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28692197>The Asia-Pacific Working Party on Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease guidelines 2017-Part 2: Management and special groups.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28637104>[Treatment Options in Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease].</a></h2><p>The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has sharply increased over the past several decades in Korea. In most cases of NAFLD, metabolic stress and cellular apoptosis are often driven by metabolic abnormality, eventually leading to inflammation and fibrosis . Along with a dramatic surge in the  epidemic, 10-20% of NAFLD patients ultimately progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a precursor to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as multi-organ systemic diseases. Currently, diet and exercise are chiefly recommended to achieve significant weight loss and improve metabolic dysfunction in patients with NAFLD. However, weight loss remains to be an elusive goal for both clinical practitioners and NAFLD patients. To date, although there has not been any proven pharmacotherapy against NAFLD, numerous promising pipelines with good target engagement are under development. Moreover, given the global landmark phase 3 trials using obeticholic  (a farnesoid X receptor agonist, REGENERATE trial) and elafibranor (a dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α/δ agonist, RESOLVE-IT trial), the era of specific target therapies focusing on molecular and metabolic pathogenesis of NASH and fibrosis is near at hand.

Rapid weight loss is a major risk factor for gallstone development. Approximately 11 % of patients who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass develop symptomatic gallstone disease. Gallstone disease can lead to severe complications and often requires hospitalization and surgery. Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) prevents the formation of gallstones after bariatric surgery. However, randomized controlled trials with symptomatic gallstone disease as primary endpoint have not been conducted. Currently, major guidelines make no definite statement about postoperative UDCA prophylaxis and most bariatric centers do not prescribe UDCA.A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind multicenter trial will be performed for which 980 patients will be included. The study population consists of consecutive patients scheduled to undergo Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy in three bariatric centers in the Netherlands. Patients will undergo a preoperative ultrasound and randomization will be stratified for pre-existing gallstones and for type of surgery. The intervention group will receive UDCA 900 mg once daily for six months. The placebo group will receive similar-looking placebo tablets. The primary endpoint is symptomatic gallstone disease after 24 months, defined as admission or hospital visit for symptomatic gallstone disease. Secondary endpoints consist of the development of gallstones on ultrasound at 24 months, number of cholecystectomies, side-effects of UDCA and quality of life. Furthermore, cost-effectiveness, cost-utility and budget impact analyses will be performed.The UPGRADE trial will answer the question whether UDCA reduces the incidence of symptomatic gallstone disease after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy.

Obeticholic  (OCA) illustrates this limitation since its dyslipidemic effect in humans cannot be observed in these rodents. Conversely, Golden Syrian hamsters have a lipoprotein metabolism mimicking human dyslipidemia since it does express the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP).

After 20 weeks of diet, FC fed hamsters were treated without or with obeticholic  (15mg/kg/day) for 5 weeks. Although a non-significant trend towards higher dietary caloric intake was observed, OCA significantly lowered body weight after 5 weeks of treatment. OCA significantly increased CETP activity and LDL-C levels by 20% and 27%, and reduced HDL-C levels by 20%. OCA blunted hepatic gene expression of Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1 and reduced fecal bile acids mass excretion by 64% (P < 0.05). Hamsters treated with OCA showed a trend towards higher scavenger receptor Class B type I (SR-BI) and lower LDL-receptor hepatic protein expression. OCA reduced NAS score for inflammation (P < 0.01) and total NAS score, although not significantly.

Mice fed a high-fat diet developed the core features of metabolic syndrome, with subsequent renal lipid accumulation and renal injury, including glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, and albuminuria. The effects were accentuated by uninephrectomy. In human renal biopsies, staining of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), glucose-regulated protein 78 (Grp78), and C/EBP-homologous protein, markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress, was more prominent in the proximal tubules of 15 obese patients compared with 16 non-obese patients.

How these genomic changes could further influence host health is still unclear. In this work, the alterations of gut-microbiota dependent metabolites were studied in the GTP-treated rats. Six groups of female SD rats (n=12/group) were administered drinking water containing 0%, 0.5%, and 1.5% GTP (wt/vol). Their gut contents were collected at 3 and 6 months and were analyzed via high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography (GC)-mass spectrometry (MS). GC-MS based metabolomics analysis captured 2668 feature, and 57 metabolites were imputatively from top 200 differential features identified via NIST fragmentation database. A group of key metabolites were quantitated using standard calibration methods. Compared with control, the elevated components in the GTP-treated groups include niacin (8.61-fold), 3-phenyllactic  (2.20-fold), galactose (3.13-fold), mannose (2.05-fold), pentadecanoic  (2.15-fold), lactic  (2.70-fold), and proline (2.15-fold); the reduced components include cholesterol (0.29-fold), cholic  (0.62-fold),  (0.41-fold), trehalose (0.14-fold), glucose (0.46-fold), fructose (0.12-fold), and alanine (0.61-fold).

Here, we determined whether these effects are mediated through differential or synergistic signaling pathways. We administered the FXR/TGR5 dual agonist INT-767 to DBA/2J mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes, db/db mice with type 2 diabetes, and C57BL/6J mice with high-fat diet-induced . We also examined the individual effects of the selective FXR agonist obeticholic  (OCA) and the TGR5 agonist INT-777 in diabetic mice. The FXR agonist OCA and the TGR5 agonist INT-777 modulated distinct renal signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis and treatment of diabetic nephropathy. Treatment of diabetic DBA/2J and db/db mice with the dual FXR/TGR5 agonist INT-767 improved proteinuria and prevented podocyte injury, mesangial expansion, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. INT-767 exerted coordinated effects on multiple pathways, including stimulation of a signaling cascade involving AMP-activated protein kinase, sirtuin 1, PGC-1, sirtuin 3, estrogen-related receptor-, and Nrf-1; inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress; and inhibition of enhanced renal fatty  and cholesterol metabolism. Additionally, in mice with diet-induced , INT-767 prevented mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress determined by fluorescence lifetime imaging of NADH and kidney fibrosis determined by second harmonic imaging microscopy.

However, the responsible molecular mechanism is poorly understood. Aim of the present study was the search for the key regulator of the overall fatty  absorption mechanism and its pharmaceutical modulation. As experimental tool we employed the polarized human intestinal tumor derived cell line CaCo2. Here we showed that influx of fatty acids is mediated by an apical heterotetrameric plasma membrane protein complex of which the calcium-independent membrane phospholipase A (iPLAß) is one constituent. The newly synthesized bile -phospholipid conjugate ursodeoxycholate-lysophosphatidylethanolamide (UDCA-LPE) blocked iPLAß, which structurally disrupted the fatty -uptake complex. Furthermore, the inhibition of iPLAß lead to reduction of cytosolic lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) production which suppressed p-JNK1, as a central regulator of metabolism. In a concerted action low p-JNK1 levels prohibited synthesis of the members of the fatty  uptake complex as well as of apolipoprotein B and the connected members of the basolateral vesicular chylomicron excretion machinery, thereby inhibiting cellular lipid excretion. The basolateral chylomicron release was shown to determine the overall fatty -absorption capacity as rate limiting step, whereas apical uptake replenishes the cellular stores, enabling continuous transcellular movement of fatty acids. In conclusion, the UDCA-LPE mediated inhibition of p-JNK1 represents a powerful tool to control intestinal absorption of fatty acids and, thus may be employed as a drug to treat .Copyright © 2017.

Prenatal caloric restriction results in low birth weight, glucose intolerance, , and reduced plasma bile acids (BAs) in offspring mice. Because BAs can regulate systemic metabolism and glucose homeostasis, we hypothesized that BA supplementation could prevent diet-induced  and glucose intolerance in this model of developmental programming. Pregnant dams were food restricted by 50% from gestational days 12.5 to 18.5. Offspring of both undernourished (UN) and control (C) dams given unrestricted diets were weaned to high-fat diets with or without supplementation with 0.25% w/w ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), yielding four experimental groups: C, UN, C + UDCA, and UN + UDCA. Glucose homeostasis, BA composition, liver and intestinal gene expression, and microbiota composition were analyzed in the four groups. Although UDCA supplementation ameliorated diet-induced  in C mice, there was no effect in UN mice. UDCA similarly lowered fasting insulin, and improved glucose tolerance, pyruvate tolerance, and liver steatosis in C, but not UN, animals. BA composition differed significantly, and liver and ileal expression of genes involved in BA metabolism (Cyp7b1, Shp) were differentially induced by UDCA in C vs UN animals. Bacterial taxa in fecal microbiota correlated with treatment groups and metabolic parameters. In conclusion, prenatal undernutrition alters responsiveness to the metabolic benefits of BA supplementation, with resistance to the weight-lowering and insulin-sensitizing effects of UDCA supplementation.

We here sought to identify the dietary constituents that determine the susceptibility to body fat accretion in germfree (GF) mice.GF and specific pathogen free (SPF) male C57BL/6N mice were fed high-fat diets either based on lard or palm oil for 4 wks. Mice were metabolically characterized at the end of the feeding trial. FT-ICR-MS and UPLC-TOF-MS were used for cecal as well as hepatic metabolite profiling and cecal bile acids quantification, respectively. Hepatic gene expression was examined by qRT-PCR and cecal gut microbiota of SPF mice was analyzed by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing.GF mice, but not SPF mice, were completely DIO resistant when fed a cholesterol-rich lard-based high-fat diet, whereas on a cholesterol-free palm oil-based high-fat diet, DIO was independent of gut microbiota. In GF lard-fed mice, DIO resistance was conveyed by increased energy expenditure, preferential carbohydrate oxidation, and increased fecal fat and energy excretion. Cecal metabolite profiling revealed a shift in bile  and steroid metabolites in these lean mice, with a significant rise in 17β-estradiol, which is known to stimulate energy expenditure and interfere with bile  metabolism. Decreased cecal bile  levels were associated with decreased hepatic expression of genes involved in bile  synthesis. These metabolic adaptations were largely attenuated in GF mice fed the palm-oil based high-fat diet. We propose that an interaction of gut microbiota and cholesterol metabolism is essential for fat accretion in normal SPF mice fed cholesterol-rich lard as the main dietary fat source. This is supported by a positive correlation between bile  levels and specific bacteria of the order  (phylum ) as a characteristic feature of normal SPF mice fed lard.In conclusion, our study identified dietary cholesterol as a candidate ingredient affecting the crosstalk between gut microbiota and host metabolism.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28202625>Gut Microbiota Promotes -Associated Liver Cancer through PGE-Mediated Suppression of Antitumor Immunity.</a></h2><p> increases the risk of cancers, including hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). However, the precise molecular mechanisms through which  promotes HCC development are still unclear. Recent studies have shown that gut microbiota may influence liver diseases by transferring its metabolites and components. Here, we show that the hepatic translocation of -induced lipoteichoic  (LTA), a Gram-positive gut microbial component, promotes HCC development by creating a tumor-promoting microenvironment. LTA enhances the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) of hepatic stellate cells (HSC) collaboratively with an -induced gut microbial metabolite, , to upregulate the expression of SASP factors and COX2 through Toll-like receptor 2. Interestingly, COX2-mediated prostaglandin E (PGE) production suppresses the antitumor immunity through a PTGER4 receptor, thereby contributing to HCC progression. Moreover, COX2 overexpression and excess PGE production were detected in HSCs in human HCCs with noncirrhotic, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), indicating that a similar mechanism could function in humans. We showed the importance of the gut-liver axis in -associated HCC. The gut microbiota-driven COX2 pathway produced the lipid mediator PGE in senescent HSCs in the tumor microenvironment, which plays a pivotal role in suppressing antitumor immunity, suggesting that PGE and its receptor may be novel therapeutic targets for noncirrhotic NASH-associated HCC. .©2017 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27089995>Influence of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass on plasma bile  profiles: a comparative study between rats, pigs and humans.</a></h2><p>Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) is the most widely used bariatric surgery procedure, which induces profound metabolic and physiological effects, such as substantial improvements in , type 2 diabetes and their comorbidities. Increasing evidence identifies bile acids (BAs) as signaling molecules that contribute to the metabolic improvement after RYGBP. However, how and to what extent BAs mediate the metabolic effects of RYGBP still remains unclear and requires mechanism of action studies using preclinical models. In this study, we compared plasma BA profiles before and after RYGBP in two animal models, rats and pigs, with humans to evaluate their translational potential.Plasma BAs were profiled in rats, pigs and humans by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry before and after RYGBP.RYGBP increased baseline plasma total BA concentrations in humans and in the two animal models to a similar extent (∼3-fold increase), despite differences in presurgery BA levels and profiles between the models. However, qualitatively, RYGBP differently affected individual plasma BA species, with similar increases in some free species (cholic  (CA), chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) and  (DCA)), different increases in glyco-conjugated species depending on the model and globally no increase in tauro-conjugated species whatever the model.The tested animal models share similar quantitative RYGBP-induced increases in peripheral blood BAs as humans, which render them useful for mechanistic studies.

UPR pathways and leptin receptor signaling were assessed in hypothalami. To further examine the mechanistic role of ER stress, changes in leptin receptor (ObR) signaling were also examined in wild-type mice treated with the ER chaperone tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), as well as in CHOP-/+ transgenic mice.Fragmented sleep in male mice induced increased food intake starting day 3 and thereafter, which was preceded by increases in ER stress and activation of all three UPR pathways in the hypothalamus. Although ObR expression was unchanged, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation was decreased, suggesting reduced ObR signaling. Unchanged suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) expression and increases in protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) expression and activity emerged with SF, along with reduced p-STAT3 responses to exogenous leptin. SF-induced effects were reversed following TUDCA treatment and were absent in CHOP -/+ mice.SF induces hyperphagic behaviors and reduced leptin signaling in hypothalamus that are mediated by activation of ER stress, and ultimately lead to increased PTP1B activity. ER stress pathways are therefore potentially implicated in SF-induced weight gain and metabolic dysfunction, and may represent a viable therapeutic target.© 2014 Associated Professional Sleep Societies, LLC.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27541710>Gallstones in childhood: etiology, clinical features, and prognosis.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to determine demographic and clinical features in children diagnosed with gallstones, risk factors for gallstone formation, the effectiveness of ursodeoxycholic  therapy, and the course of the disease.Patients aged 0-18 years were followed up for at least 6 months after the diagnosis of gallstones with ultrasonography and were evaluated retrospectively.

Here, we investigated the energy homeostasis in Klb-/- mice on high-fat diet in order to better understand the consequences of abrogating both endogenous FGF15/19 and FGF21 signaling during caloric overload. Surprisingly, Klb-/- mice are resistant to diet-induced  (DIO) owing to enhanced energy expenditure and BAT activity. Klb-/- mice exhibited not only an increase but also a shift in bile  (BA) composition featured by activation of the classical (neutral) BA synthesis pathway at the expense of the alternative (acidic) pathway. High hepatic production of cholic  (CA) results in a large excess of microbiota-derived  (DCA).

In fact, combined gene deletion of Klb and Tgr5 or antibiotic treatment abrogating bacterial conversion of CA into DCA both abolish DIO resistance in Klb-/- mice.

Experiments in rodents with trained exercise have shown that exercise improves vascular function and reduces vascular inflammation by modulating the balance between nitric oxide (NO) and oxidative stress. However, the upstream regulator of exercise-induced vascular benefits is unclear. We aimed to investigate the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ) in exercise-induced vascular functional improvement. We show that PPARδ is a crucial mediator for exercise to exert a beneficial effect on the vascular endothelium in diabetic mice. In db/db mice and high-fat diet-induced obese mice, 4 weeks of treadmill exercise restored endothelium-dependent vasodilation of aortas and flow-mediated vasodilation in mesenteric resistance arteries, whereas genetic ablation of Ppard abolished such improvements.

Plasma concentrations of bile acids (BAs) increase after RYGB, and BAs may act as molecular enhancers of GLP-1 secretion through activation of TGR5-receptors. We aimed to evaluate GLP-1 secretion after oral administration of the primary bile  chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) and the secondary bile  ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) (which are available for oral use) in RYGB-operated participants. Eleven participants (BMI 29.1 ± 1.2, age 37.0 ± 3.2 years, time from RYGB 32.3 ± 1.1 months, weight loss after RYGB 37.0 ± 3.1 kg) were studied in a placebo-controlled, crossover-study. On three different days, participants ingested (1) placebo (water), (2) UDCA 750 mg, (3) CDCA 1250 mg (highest recommended doses). Oral intake of CDCA increased plasma concentrations of GLP-1, C-peptide, glucagon, peptide YY, neurotensin, total bile acids, and fibroblast growth factor 19 significantly compared with placebo (all  < 0.05 for peak and positive incremental area-under-the-curve (piAUC)). All plasma hormone concentrations were unaffected by UDCA Neither UDCA nor CDCA changed glucose, cholecystokinin or glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) concentrations.

However, detailed information on the bactericidal activities of the diverse molecular species of bile  in humans and rodents is largely unknown. Here, we investigated the toxicity of 14 typical human and rodent free bile acids (FBAs) by monitoring intracellular pH, membrane integrity, and viability of a human intestinal bacterium,  Japan Collection of Microorganisms (JCM) 1192, upon exposure to these FBAs.

Additionally, it acts as a cell protector with unclear mechanism but may be implicated in combating against inflammation, fibrosis and cancers. FXR is thus accepted as a promising target particularly for the enterohepatic diseases, and numerous FXR modulators have been patented and developed.This review provides an update on the development of FXR modulators for enterohepatic diseases and offers an in-depth perspective on new strategies for the development of novel FXR modulators.Despite the development of numerous FXR modulators, which culminated in the successful launch of obeticholic  (OCA), it remains a matter of debate on how the function of FXR should be exploited for therapeutic purposes. The improvement for  achieved by either FXR agonists or antagonists is still in confusion. Whether the side effect of pruritus induced by OCA could be exempted for non-steroidal FXR agonists needs further validation. Apart from the development of conventional FXR ligands, emerging evidence support that restoration of FXR protein level may represent a new strategy in targeting FXR for enterohepatic and metabolic diseases.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27170389>Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis: From Pathophysiology to Novel Therapies.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) disease is defined by an accumulation of liver fat exceeding 5% of its weight in the absence of significant alcoholic intake. In 5-20%, there is a progression from NAFL to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Until now, it is not well understood why only some patients develop NASH, and currently, no drugs are licensed for this indication. Different T-cell populations such as T-regulatory, Th1 and Th17 cells play a central role in the immunopathogenesis of fatty liver disease and open the option of future interleukin (IL)-17-based therapeutics. The inflammatory process underlying NASH is furthermore characterized by elevated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and IL-1β. Anakinra, a recombinant version of IL-1Ra shows promising metabolic effects with improved hyperglycemia and beta-cell secretory function in a double-blind placebo controlled randomized trial in type 2 diabetic patients but such studies are still in their preliminary stages for NASH. Several studies point out that bile  farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-mediated signals (such as the enterohepatic hormone fibroblast growth factor 15/19) are involved in the regulation of triglyceride and glucose metabolism. Recent clinical trials have revealed a beneficial impact of the FXR agonist obeticholic  on body weight, insulin sensitivity and liver histology in patients with NASH. Further potential novel therapeutic targets in NASH are currently in phase II clinical development.© 2016 S.

Targeting the gut-liver axis and bile -based pharmaceuticals are potential therapies for NAFLD. The effect of tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), a candidate drug for NAFLD, on intestinal barrier function, intestinal inflammation, gut lipid transport and microbiota composition was analysed in a murine model of NAFLD.The NAFLD mouse model was established by feeding mice a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. TUDCA was administered p.o. during the last 4 weeks. The expression levels of intestinal tight junction genes, lipid metabolic and inflammatory genes were determined by quantitative PCR. Tissue inflammation was evaluated by haematoxylin and eosin staining. The gut microbiota was analysed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.TUDCA administration attenuated HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, inflammatory responses,  and insulin resistance in mice. Moreover, TUDCA attenuated gut inflammatory responses as manifested by decreased intestinal histopathology scores and inflammatory cytokine levels. In addition, TUDCA improved intestinal barrier function by increasing levels of tight junction molecules and the solid chemical barrier. The components involved in ileum lipid transport were also reduced by TUDCA administration in HFD-fed mice. Finally, the TUDCA-treated mice showed a different gut microbiota composition compared with that in HFD-fed mice but similar to that in normal chow diet-fed mice.TUDCA attenuates the progression of HFD-induced NAFLD in mice by ameliorating gut inflammation, improving intestinal barrier function, decreasing intestinal fat transport and modulating intestinal microbiota composition.© 2017 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30370307>Fecal Microbiota Transplantation Can Alleviate Gastrointestinal Transit in Rats with High-Fat Diet-Induced  via Regulation of Serotonin Biosynthesis.</a></h2><p>We tested the hypothesis that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) could regulate the biotransformation of bile acids, such as  (DCA) and cholic  (CA), which in turn regulate the biosynthesis of serotonin in the gut and relieve gastrointestinal dysmotility in high-fat diet- (HFD-) induced  in rats.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into the control diet group, HFD group, and HFD-fed with receiving FMT.

In HFD-fed rats, TPH1 protein expression was increased significantly, while SERT protein expression was decreased, but not significant. The levels of CA and DCA in intestinal contents were also significantly increased in HFD-fed rats compared with the control group.

Although the mainstay of treatment of NAFLD is weight loss, it is hard to maintain, prompting the need for pharmacotherapy as well. A greater understanding of disease pathogenesis in recent years was followed by development of new classes of medications, as well as potential repurposing of currently available agents. NAFLD therapies target four main pathways. The dominant approach is targeting hepatic fat accumulation and the resultant metabolic stress. Medications in this group include peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor agonists (eg, pioglitazone, elafibranor, saroglitazar), medications targeting the bile -farnesoid X receptor axis (obeticholic ), inhibitors of de novo lipogenesis (aramchol, NDI-010976), incretins (liraglutide) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-21 or FGF-19 analogues. A second approach is targeting the oxidative stress, inflammation and injury that follow the metabolic stress. Medications from this group include antioxidants (vitamin E), medications with a target in the tumour necrosis factor α pathway (emricasan, pentoxifylline) and immune modulators (amlexanox, cenicriviroc). A third group has a target in the gut, including antiobesity agents such as orlistat or gut microbiome modulators (IMM-124e, faecal microbial transplant, solithromycin). Finally, as the ongoing injury leads to fibrosis, the harbinger of liver-related morbidity and mortality, antifibrotics (simtuzumab and GR-MD-02) will be an important element of therapy. It is very likely that in the next few years several medications will be available to clinicians treating patients with NAFLD across the entire spectrum of disease.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

We have previously shown that ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) has antioxidative activity through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling-mediated glutathione production. In this study, we investigated the effects of UDCA on insulin response by analyzing intracellular ROS and the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in HepG2 cells treated with palmitate. The level of ROS was quantified using 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (HDCFDA), and the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was determined by Western blotting assay using appropriate antibodies. The intracellular ROS levels were increased by palmitate but were reduced by treatment with UDCA and insulin. Furthermore, insulin significantly stimulated the phosphorylation of Akt. When the cells were pre-treated with palmitate, insulin-induced Akt-phosphorylation was markedly inhibited. However, when the cells were treated with palmitate and UDCA, the effects of insulin were partially restored.

There are no approved therapies for NASH; however, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and farnesoid-X receptor (FXR) agonists are promising drug targets. We investigated the therapeutic effects of co-administration of a GLP-1R agonist, IP118, with FXR agonist obeticholic  (OCA) in mice.OCA and IP118 alone and in combination were sub-chronically administered to Lep/Lep mice with diet-induced NASH or diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Metabolic (body weight and glucose) and liver (biochemical and histological) endpoints were assessed. NASH severity in Lep/Lep mice was graded using a customized integrated scoring system.OCA reduced liver weight and lipid in NASH mice (both by -17%) but had no effect on plasma ALT or AST levels. In contrast, IP118 significantly reduced liver weight (-21%), liver lipid (-15%), ALT (-29%), and AST (-27%). The combination of OCA + IP118 further reduced liver weight (-29%), liver lipid (-22%), ALT (-39%), and AST (-36%). Combination therapy was superior to monotherapies in reducing hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. Hepatic improvements with IP118 and OCA + IP118 were associated with reduced body weight (-4.3% and -3.5% respectively) and improved glycemic control in OCA + IP118-treated mice. In DIO mice, OCA + IP118 co-administration reduced body weight (-25.3%) to a greater degree than IP118 alone (-12.5%) and further improved glucose tolerance and reduced hepatic lipid.Our data suggest a complementary or synergistic therapeutic effect of GLP-1R and FXR agonism in mouse models of metabolic disease and NASH.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

In the current study, we aim to elucidate the roles of bile acids and their associations with gut microbiota during  development, employing high fat diet (HFD)-induced  in a rat model.

We then assessed bile acids fluxes in the biological matrixes collected. We found that, irrespective of dietary regimes, taurine-conjugated bile acids were the dominant species in the liver whereas unconjugated bile acids were in plasma. However, HFD caused slight increases in the total bile acids pool and particularly the increases in the levels of  (DCA) (138.67 ± 37.225 nmol/L in control group, 242.61 ± 43.16 nmol/L in HFD group, p = 0.014) and taurodeoxycholic  (TDCA) (2.8 ± 0.247 nmol/g in control group, 4.5 ± 0.386 nmol/g in HFD group, p = 0.0018) in plasma and liver tissues, respectively, which were consistent with the increased levels of DCA in intestinal tissues and feces. These changes are correlated to an increase in abundance of genera Blautia, Coprococcus, Intestinimonas, Lactococcus, Roseburia, and Ruminococcus.

Specifically, increased levels of the bile   (DCA), an established tumor promoter, has been shown to correlate with increased development of colorectal adenomas and progression to carcinoma. Herein we investigate the mechanism by which DCA leads to EGFR-MAPK activation, a candidate mechanism by which DCA may promote colorectal tumorigenesis. DCA treated colon cancer cells exhibited strong and prolonged activation of ERK1/2 when compared to EGF treatment alone. We also showed that DCA treatment prevents EGFR degradation as opposed to the canonical EGFR recycling observed with EGF treatment. Moreover, the combination of DCA and EGF treatment displayed synergistic activity, suggesting DCA activates MAPK signaling in a non-canonical manner. Further evaluation showed that DCA treatment increased intracellular calcium levels and CAMKII phosphorylation, and that blocking calcium with BAPTA-AM abrogated MAPK activation induced by DCA, but not by EGF. Finally we showed that DCA-induced CAMKII leads to MAPK activation through the recruitment of c-Src. Taken together, we demonstrated that DCA regulates MAPK activation through calcium signaling, an alternative mechanism not previously recognized in human colon cancer cells. Importantly, this mechanism allows for EGFR to escape degradation and thus achieve a constitutively active state, which may explain its tumor promoting effects.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

There is increasing evidence for interplay between two key regulating factors in lipid metabolism: bile acids (BAs) and gut microbiota. However, very little is known about how types of different diet-supplemented bile salts (BS) influence this interaction . We sought to explore these relationships using grass carp (), which often suffers functional disorder of liver and gallbladder. We studied fluctuations of BAs in the gall and changes of microbial communities in the gut in response to seven different diets: five different BS, chelating BS agent, and control. The BS comprised two primary BS [sodium taurochololate (TCAS) and sodium taurochenodeoxycholate (TCDCAS)], sodium tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDCAS), and two secondary BS [sodium taurodeoxycholate (TDCAS) and sodium taurolithocholate (TLCAS)]. Supplementation of primary BS caused a more significant fluctuation of biliary BAs than secondary BS, and TCAS caused a more prominent increase than TCDCAS and TUDCAS. For the gut microbiota, primary BS tended to increase their diversity and induce community succession, secondary BS resulted in a higher firmicutes/bacteroidetes ratio, while TUDCAS had no significant effects. Changes of the gut microbiota triggered by different types of BS caused alteration in BAs biotransformation. Two--associated families, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae were positively correlated with biliary cholic  (CA), taurochenodeoxycholic  (TCDCA), and  (DCA).

Our data showed that rats fed a high-fat diet or that were centrally administered thapsigargin displayed hypothalamic ER stress, whereas genetic overexpression of GRP78 specifically in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus was sufficient to alleviate ER stress and to revert the obese and metabolic phenotype. Those effects were independent of feeding and leptin but were related to increased thermogenic activation of brown adipose tissue and induction of browning in WAT and could be reversed by antagonism of β3 adrenergic receptors.

Aims of the current investigation were to discriminate between nongenomic (≤1 h) and genomic effects (24-48 h) of BAs on β-cells and to evaluate whether FXR can modulate the adverse effects of a high-fat diet (HFD). TCDC (500 nM) as well as glycine-conjugated and unconjugated CDC (chenodeoxycholate) increased insulin secretion in acute incubations but did not evoke additional effects after 1-2 days of preincubation. The BAs did not stimulate β-cells of FXR-knockout (KO) mice and activation of the G protein-coupled BA receptor TGR5 was ineffective, suggesting that FXR is the sole BA receptor in β-cells activated by TCDC and its analogues. As opposed to lean mice, obese FXR-KO mice did not show HFD-induced glucose intolerance and increased fasting glucose. The beneficial impact of FXR-KO on glucose metabolism cannot be explained by an adaptive compensation of insulin secretion or β-cell mass. Interestingly, in contrast to its effect on islets from lean mice, the FXR agonist GW4064 was ineffective in stimulating insulin secretion of islets from wild type mice fed a HFD or isolated islets kept in a glucolipotoxic medium. Additional feeding of CDC restored the effect of GW4064. CDC prevented HFD-induced impairment of glucose tolerance and in vitro effects of glucolipotoxicity.
