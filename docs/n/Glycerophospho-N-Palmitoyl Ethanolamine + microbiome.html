However, global discovery of the MCR-1 colistin resistance dramatically challenges the newly renewed interest in colistin for clinical use.The mcr-1-harboring plasmids were acquired from swine and human Escherichia coli isolated in China, from 2015 to 2016, and subjected to Illumina PacBio RSII and Hi-Seq2000 for full genome sequencing. PCR was applied to close the gap of the assembled contigs. Ori-Finder was employed to predict the replication origin (oriC) in plasmids. The phenotype of MCR-1-producing isolates was evaluated on the LBA plates with various level of colistin. Genetic deletion was used to test the requirement of the initial "ATG" codon for the MCR-1 function.Here, we report full genomes of over 10 mcr-1-harboring plasmids with diversified replication incompatibilities. A novel hybrid IncI2/IncFIB plasmid pGD17-2 was discovered and characterized from a swine isolate with colistin resistance. Intriguingly, co-occurrence of two unique mcr-1-bearing plasmids (pGD65-3, IncI2, and pGD65-5, IncX4) was detected in a single isolate GD65, which might accelerate dissemination of the mcr-1 under environmental selection pressure. Genetic analyses of these plasmids mapped mobile elements in the context of antibiotic resistance and determined two insertion sequences (ISEcp1 and ISApl1) that are responsible for the mobilization of mcr-1. Gene deletion also proved that the first ATG codon is redundant in the mcr-1 gene.Collectively, our results extend landscapes of the diversified mcr-1-bearing plasmid reservoirs.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27281303>The association of serum choline with linear growth failure in young children from rural Malawi.</a></h2><p>Choline is an essential nutrient for cell structure, cell signaling, neurotransmission, lipid transport, and bone formation. Choline can be irreversibly converted to betaine, a major source of methyl groups. Trimethylene N-oxide (TMAO), a proatherogenic molecule, is produced from the metabolism of dietary choline by the gut . The relation between serum choline and its closely related metabolites with linear growth in children is unknown.The aim was to characterize the relation between serum choline and its closely related metabolites, betaine and TMAO, with linear growth and stunting in young children.We measured serum choline, betaine, and TMAO concentrations by using liquid chromatography isotopic dilution tandem mass spectrometry in a cross-sectional study in 325 Malawian children, aged 12-59 mo, of whom 62% were stunted.Median (25th, 75th percentile) serum choline, betaine, and TMAO concentrations were 6.4 (4.8, 8.3), 12.4 (9.1, 16.3), and 1.2 (0.7, 1.8) μmol/L, respectively. Spearman correlation coefficients of age with serum choline, betaine, and TMAO were -0.57 (P < 0.0001), -0.26 (P < 0.0001), and -0.10 (P = 0.07), respectively. Correlation coefficients of height-for-age z score with serum choline, betaine-to-choline ratio, and TMAO-to-choline ratio were 0.31 (P < 0.0001), -0.24 (P < 0.0001), and -0.29 (P < 0.0001), respectively. Serum choline concentrations were strongly and significantly associated with stunting. Children with and without stunting had median (25th, 75th percentile) serum choline concentrations of 5.6 (4.4, 7.4) and 7.3 (5.9, 9.1) μmol/L (P < 0.0001).Linear growth failure in young children is associated with low serum choline and elevated betaine-to-choline and TMAO-to-choline ratios. Further work is needed to understand whether low dietary choline intake explains low circulating choline among stunted children living in low-income countries and whether increasing choline intake may correct choline deficiency and improve growth and development.

Stress has been identified as part of the factors causing an outbreak of infections in the aquaculture industry. The most studied neuroendocrine hormonal family from a microbial endocrinology perspective is the catecholamine comprising of norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine. It is of importance that catecholamine affects the growth and virulence of bacteria. The influence of stress on bacterial infections is attributed to the ability of catecholamines to suppress the immune system as the mode of action for increased bacterial growth. Catecholamines have increased the growth of bacteria, virulence-associated factors, adhesions, and biofilm formation and consequently influence the outcome of infections by these bacteria in many hosts. The siderophores and the ferric iron transport system plays a vital role in the mechanism by which catecholamines stimulates growth and exposure of genes to stress hormones enhances the expression of genes involved in bacterial virulence. In recent years, it has been discovered that intestinal microflora takes part in bidirectional communication between the gut and brain. The rapidly growing field of  research, understanding the communities of bacteria living within our bodies and the genes they contain is yielding new perspectives. This review reveals catecholamines effects on the growth and virulence of bacteria and the latest trends in microbial endocrinology.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

For example, patients with cirrhosis have increased bacteremia, increased blood levels of lipopolysaccharide, and increased intestinal permeability. Patients with cirrhosis have bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine. Selective intestinal decontamination with antibiotics is beneficial for patients with decompensated cirrhosis. In experimental models of chronic liver injury with fibrosis, several toll-like receptors (TLR) are required to make mice sensitive to liver fibrosis. The presumed ligand for the TLRs are bacterial products derived from the gut , and TLR knockout mice are resistant to liver inflammation and fibrosis. We and others have characterized the association between preclinical models of liver disease in mice with the microbial diversity in their gut . In each model, including intragastric alcohol, bile duct ligation, chronic carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), administration, and genetic obesity, there is a significant change in the gut  from normal control mice. However, there is not a single clear bacterial strain or pattern that distinguish mice with liver injury from controlled mice. So how can the gut  affect liver disease? We can identify at least 6 changes that would result in liver injury, inflammation, and/or fibrosis. These include: (1) changes in caloric yield of diet; (2) regulation of gut permeability to release bacterial products; (3) modulation of choline metabolism; (4) production of endogenous ethanol; (5) regulation of bile acid metabolism; and (6) regulation in lipid metabolism.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30936548>Metagenomic analysis of colorectal cancer datasets identifies cross-cohort microbial diagnostic signatures and a link with choline degradation.</a></h2><p>Several studies have investigated links between the gut  and colorectal cancer (CRC), but questions remain about the replicability of biomarkers across cohorts and populations. We performed a meta-analysis of five publicly available datasets and two new cohorts and validated the findings on two additional cohorts, considering in total 969 fecal metagenomes. Unlike  shifts associated with gastrointestinal syndromes, the gut  in CRC showed reproducibly higher richness than controls (P < 0.01), partially due to expansions of species typically derived from the oral cavity. Meta-analysis of the  functional potential identified gluconeogenesis and the putrefaction and fermentation pathways as being associated with CRC, whereas the stachyose and starch degradation pathways were associated with controls. Predictive  signatures for CRC trained on multiple datasets showed consistently high accuracy in datasets not considered for model training and independent validation cohorts (average area under the curve, 0.84). Pooled analysis of raw metagenomes showed that the choline trimethylamine-lyase gene was overabundant in CRC (P = 0.001), identifying a relationship between  choline metabolism and CRC. The combined analysis of heterogeneous CRC cohorts thus identified reproducible  biomarkers and accurate disease-predictive models that can form the basis for clinical prognostic tests and hypothesis-driven mechanistic studies.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30082863>Development of a gut microbe-targeted nonlethal therapeutic to inhibit thrombosis potential.</a></h2><p>Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is a gut -derived metabolite that enhances both platelet responsiveness and in vivo thrombosis potential in animal models, and TMAO plasma levels predict incident atherothrombotic event risks in human clinical studies. TMAO is formed by gut microbe-dependent metabolism of trimethylamine (TMA) moiety-containing nutrients, which are abundant in a Western diet. Here, using a mechanism-based inhibitor approach targeting a major microbial TMA-generating enzyme pair, CutC and CutD (CutC/D), we developed inhibitors that are potent, time-dependent, and irreversible and that do not affect commensal viability. In animal models, a single oral dose of a CutC/D inhibitor significantly reduced plasma TMAO levels for up to 3 d and rescued diet-induced enhanced platelet responsiveness and thrombus formation, without observable toxicity or increased bleeding risk. The inhibitor selectively accumulated within intestinal microbes to millimolar levels, a concentration over 1-million-fold higher than needed for a therapeutic effect. These studies reveal that mechanism-based inhibition of gut microbial TMA and TMAO production reduces thrombosis potential, a critical adverse complication in heart disease. They also offer a generalizable approach for the selective nonlethal targeting of gut microbial enzymes linked to host disease limiting systemic exposure of the inhibitor in the host.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29172946>Postprandial gut -driven choline metabolism links dietary cues to adipose tissue dysfunction.</a></h2><p>The human body is an integrated circuit between microbial symbionts and our Homo sapien genome, which communicate bi-directionally to maintain homeostasis within the human meta-organism. There is now strong evidence that microbes resident in the human intestine can directly contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity and associated cardiometabolic disorders. In fact, gut microbes represent a filter of our greatest environmental exposure - the foods we consume. It is now clear that we each experience a given meal differently, based on our unique gut microbial communities. Biologically active gut microbe-derived metabolites, such as short chain fatty acids, secondary bile acids, and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), are now uniquely recognized as contributors to obesity and related cardiometabolic disorders. However, mechanistic insights into how microbe-derived metabolites promote obesity are largely unknown. Recent work has demonstrated that the meta-organismal production of the bacterial co-metabolite TMAO is linked to suppression of beiging of white adipose tissue in mice and humans. Furthermore, the TMAO pathway is becoming an increasingly attractive therapeutic target in obesity-associated diseases such as type 2 diabetes, kidney failure, and cardiovascular disease. In this commentary we discuss recent findings linking the TMAO pathway to obesity-associated disorders, and provide additional insights into potential mechanisms driving this microbe-host interaction.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30771811>Biomarker Discovery and Utility in Necrotizing Enterocolitis.</a></h2><p>Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating disease of prematurity, with no current method for early diagnosis.

Although natural resistance to polymyxins is rare, the discovery of a mobilized colistin resistance gene () in gut bacteria has raised significant concern. As an intramembrane enzyme, MCR-1 catalyzes the transfer of phosphoethanolamine (PEA) to the 1 (or 4')-phosphate group of the lipid A moiety of lipopolysaccharide, thereby conferring colistin resistance. However, the structural and biochemical mechanisms used by this integral membrane enzyme remain poorly understood. Here, we report the modeled structure of the full-length MCR-1 membrane protein. Together with molecular docking, our structural and functional dissection of the complex of MCR-1 with its phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) substrate suggested the presence of a 12 residue-containing cavity for substrate entry, which is critical for both enzymatic activity and its resultant phenotypic resistance to colistin.

The objective of this study was to observe intestinal  and susceptibility to Salmonella associated with stress hormones, cortisol (CORT), and norepinephrine (NE), in piglets. At weaning, 90 piglets (15 for a Salmonella challenge) were trained to take the carrier (apple juice) orally. At 2 wk after weaning, pens of piglets were assigned randomly to 1 of 3 treatments: control (CNT), NE, or CORT. Blood samples were collected prior to treatment, then piglets were dosed orally with treatments twice on day 0; at 0800 and 1600 h. Control piglets were administered 6.1 mL of the carrier only, NE pigs were administered 40 mg/mL of NE-bitartrate salt dissolved in the carrier, and CORT pigs were administered 12 mg/mL of hydrocortisone acetate dissolved in the carrier. Jugular blood samples were collected prior to necropsies (n = 5/treatment) at 0800 and 1600 h on day 1, and at 0800 h on days 2, 7, and 14 after treatments were started. A subset of pigs were subjected to a 24-h Salmonella challenge. Jejunal and ileal tissues and jejunal, ileal, cecal, and rectal contents were collected and colonies were counted. Microbial data and blood samples were analyzed using mixed models with fixed effects of treatment and day. Cortisol-treated piglets exhibited a spike in plasma CORT concentrations at 0800 h day 1 (P = 0.001) accompanied by greater concentrations of cecal Escherichia coli (P < 0.05) and a shift in intestinal environment to favor coliforms on day 2 (P < 0.05). Salmonella concentrations from rectal contents tended (P = 0.07) to be suppressed by CORT.

We investigated whether changes in gut -dependent metabolite of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and its nutrient precursors (choline and L-carnitine) were associated with improvements in glucose metabolism and diabetes-related amino acids in a weight-loss diet intervention.We included 504 overweight and obese adults who were randomly assigned to one of four energy-reduced diets varying in macronutrient intake. The 6-month changes (Δ) in TMAO, choline and L-carnitine levels after the intervention were calculated.Greater decreases in choline and L-carnitine were significantly (p<0.05) associated with greater improvements in fasting insulin concentrations and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) at 6 months. The reduction of choline was significantly related to 2-year improvements in glucose and insulin resistance. We found significant linkages between dietary fat intake and ΔTMAO for changes in fasting glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR (p <0.05); a greater increase in TMAO was related to lesser improvements in the outcomes among participants who consumed a high-fat diet. In addition, ΔL-carnitine and Δcholine were significantly related to changes in amino acids (including branched-chain and aromatic amino acids). Interestingly, the associations of ΔTMAO, Δcholine and ΔL-carnitine with diabetes-related traits were independent of the changes in amino acids.Our findings underscore the importance of changes in TMAO, choline and L-carnitine in improving insulin sensitivity during a weight-loss intervention for obese patients.

Besides endogenous biosynthesis and direct choline supplement, choline esters in the diet are another source of choline in the body. Phenolic choline esters are a group of unique dietary choline esters rich in the seeds of Brassicaceae plants, among which sinapine is a choline ester of sinapic acid abundant in rapeseed. In this study, 40 nursery pigs were fed with rapeseed-derived feed ingredients (RSF) or soybean meal for 3 weeks (20 pigs/diet). The metabolic fate of sinapine-derived choline in RSF was examined by comparing the distribution of choline and its metabolites in digesta, liver, and serum samples by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. The results showed that choline was released from extensive hydrolysis of sinapine in the small intestine. However, sinapine-derived choline did not increase the levels of choline and its major metabolites, including betaine, phosphocholine, and glycerophosphocholine, in the liver and serum. Instead, RSF feeding increased trimethylamine (TMA), the microbial metabolite of choline, in the large intestine and further increased trimethylamine -oxide (TMAO), the oxidation metabolite of TMA, in the liver and serum. Overall, these results suggested that sinapine-derived choline from rapeseed feeding had limited influences on the post-absorption choline pool as a result of its low bioavailability but may serve as a major source of TMAO through microbial metabolism in nursery pigs. Improving the bioavailability of sinapine-derived choline might have the potential to modify the nutritional values and functionalities of rapeseed meal in swine feeding.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31400167>Acidic pH promotes lipopolysaccharide modification and alters colonization in a bacteria-animal mutualism.</a></h2><p>Environmental pH can be an important cue for symbiotic bacteria as they colonize their eukaryotic hosts.

We have evaluated the association between metabolites from the choline pathway and risk of incident CVD and the potential modifying effect of Mediterranean diet interventions.We designed a case-cohort study nested within the PREDIMED (Prevention With Mediterranean Diet) trial, including 229 incident CVD cases and 751 randomly selected participants at baseline, followed up for 4.8 years. We used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to measure, at baseline and at 1 year of follow-up, plasma concentrations of 5 metabolites in the choline pathway: trimethylamine N-oxide, betaine, choline, phosphocholine, and α-glycerophosphocholine. We have calculated a choline metabolite score using a weighted sum of these 5 metabolites. We used weighted Cox regression models to estimate CVD risk. The multivariable hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) per 1-SD increase in choline and α-glycerophosphocholine metabolites were 1.24 (1.05-1.46) and 1.24 (1.03-1.50), respectively. The baseline betaine/choline ratio was inversely associated with CVD. The baseline choline metabolite score was associated with a 2.21-fold higher risk of CVD across extreme quartiles (95% confidence interval, 1.36-3.59; <0.001 for trend) and a 2.27-fold higher risk of stroke (95% confidence interval, 1.24-4.16; <0.001 for trend). Participants in the higher quartiles of the score who were randomly assigned to the control group had a higher risk of CVD compared with participants in the lower quartile and assigned to the Mediterranean diet groups (=0.05 for interaction). No significant associations were observed for 1-year changes in individual plasma metabolites and CVD.A metabolite score combining plasma metabolites from the choline pathway was associated with an increased risk of CVD in a Mediterranean population at high cardiovascular risk.URL: http://www.controlled-trials.com.

Dysbiosis of the gut  associated with increased intestinal permeability facilitates the passage of endotoxins and other microbial products, including indoxyl sulfate in the circulation. Although an emerging body of evidence has suggested that indoxyl sulfate is a key substance for the development of chronic kidney disease, few studies have investigated the direct association of indoxyl sulfate with vascular function. We hypothesized that indoxyl sulfate adversely affects vascular function. Aortas isolated from male Wistar rat were examined in the presence or absence of indoxyl sulfate to assess the vascular function, including vasorelaxation and vasocontraction. Indoxyl sulfate (vs. vehicle) (1) decreased vasorelaxation induced by acetylcholine (ACh) but not by sodium nitroprusside; (2) had no significant alterations of noradrenaline-induced vasocontraction in the absence and presence of endothelium; (3) decreased adenylyl cyclase activator (forskolin)-induced vasorelaxation, while such a difference was eliminated by endothelial denudation; and (4) decreased vasorelaxations induced by calcium ionophore (A23187) and transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 agonist (GSK1016790A). The indoxyl sulfate-induced decrease in the vasorelaxations induced by ACh and A23187 increased by cell-permeant superoxide dismutase or by organic anion transporter inhibitor. However, apocynin, an inhibitor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, had no effects on vasorelaxations induced by ACh, A23187, forskolin, and GSK1016790A in the presence of indoxyl sulfate. These results suggest that indoxyl sulfate directly affects the vascular function, particularly, endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation, and this effect may be attributable to increased oxidative stress after cell transportion via organic anion transporter, and such increased oxidative stress may not be attributable to activation of NADPH oxidase activation.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26187962>Small RNA Transcriptome of the Oral  during Periodontitis Progression.</a></h2><p>The oral  is one of the most complex microbial communities in the human body, and due to circumstances not completely understood, the healthy microbial community becomes dysbiotic, giving rise to periodontitis, a polymicrobial inflammatory disease. We previously reported the results of community-wide gene expression changes in the oral  during periodontitis progression and identified signatures associated with increasing severity of the disease. Small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs) are key players in posttranscriptional regulation, especially in fast-changing environments such as the oral cavity. Here, we expanded our analysis to the study of the sRNA metatranscriptome during periodontitis progression on the same samples for which mRNA expression changes were analyzed. We observed differential expression of 12,097 sRNAs, identifying a total of 20 Rfam sRNA families as being overrepresented in progression and 23 at baseline. Gene ontology activities regulated by the differentially expressed (DE) sRNAs included amino acid metabolism,  catabolism, signal recognition particle-dependent cotranslational protein targeting to membrane, intron splicing, carbohydrate metabolism, control of plasmid copy number, and response to stress. In integrating patterns of expression of protein coding transcripts and sRNAs, we found that functional activities of genes that correlated positively with profiles of expression of DE sRNAs were involved in pathogenesis, proteolysis, ferrous iron transport, and oligopeptide transport. These findings represent the first integrated sequencing analysis of the community-wide sRNA transcriptome of the oral  during periodontitis progression and show that sRNAs are key regulatory elements of the dysbiotic process leading to disease.Copyright © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

Toward elucidation of the molecular basis of EAL catalysis, and its intracellular trafficking and targeting to the Eut biomicrocompartment (BMC), we have applied electron spin-labelling and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to wild-type (wt) EAL from Salmonella typhimurium, by using the sulphydryl-specific, 4-maleimido-TEMPO (4MT) spin label. One cysteine residue per active site displays exceptional reactivity with 4MT. This site is identified as βC37 on the EutC subunit, by using 4MT-labeling of site-specific cysteine-to-alanine mutants, enzyme kinetics, and accessible surface area calculations. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of 4MT-labelled wt EAL are collected over 200-265 K in frozen, polycrystalline water-only, and 1% v/v DMSO solvents. EPR simulations reveal two mobility components for each condition. Detectable spin probe reorientational motion of the two components occurs at 215 and 225 K with 1% v/v DMSO, relative to the water-only condition, consistent with formation of an aqueous-DMSO solvent mesodomain around EAL. Parallel trends in fast- and slow-reorientational correlation times and interconversion of the two populations with increasing temperature, indicate 4MT labelling of a single site (βC37). A two-state model is proposed, in which the fast and slow motional populations represent EAL-bound and free conformations of the EutC N-terminal domain. The approximately equal proportion of each state may represent a balance between EutC and EAL protein stability and efficient targeting to the BMC.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30318075>The debate over neurotransmitter interaction in aspartame usage.</a></h2><p>Aspartame (NutraSweet®, Equal®) is a widely used artificial sweetener, has been reported to be accountable for neurological and behavioural disturbances in people. Upon ingestion, aspartame is hydrolyzed in gut and provides its metabolite; such as essential amino acid phenylalanine (Phy) (50%), aspartic acid (40%), and methanol (10%). Altered brain neurochemical compositions [such as dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and serotonin (5-HT)] have long been a concern and being involved in observed neurophysiological symptom (such as headaches, memory loss, mood changes, as well as depression) in aspartame consumers. Aspartames might act as chemical stressor through increasing plasma cortisol level. Aspartame consumption similarly altered gut . Taken together all this factors, we reviewed to search for convincing evidence, in what manner aspartame metabolites, stress hormones (cortisol), and gut dysbiosisis involved in altering brain neurochemical composition. We concluded that aspartame metabolite; mainly Phy and its interaction with neurotransmitter and aspartic acid by acting as excitatory neurotransmitter causes this pattern of impairments. Along with elevated cortisol and gut dysbiosis via interactions with different biogenic amine may also have additional impact to modulate neuronal signaling lead to neurobiological impairments. Hence ongoing research is instantly needed to understand the specific roles of aspartame metabolite, elevated cortisol, and gut dysbiosis with emerging neurophysiological symptom in aspartame consumers to improve healthy life in its consumers.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Approach and Results- Here, we investigated the interaction between the gut  and diet on atherosclerosis by feeding germ-free or conventionally raised Apoe mice chow or Western diet alone or supplemented with choline (which is metabolized by the gut  and host enzymes to trimethylamine N-oxide) for 12 weeks. We observed smaller aortic lesions and lower plasma cholesterol levels in conventionally raised mice compared with germ-free mice on a chow diet; these differences were not observed in mice on a Western diet. Choline supplementation increased plasma trimethylamine N-oxide levels in conventionally raised mice but not in germ-free mice. However, this treatment did not affect the size of aortic lesions or plasma cholesterol levels. Gut  composition was analyzed by sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. As expected, the global community structure and relative abundance of many taxa differed between mice fed chow or a Western diet. Choline supplementation had minor effects on the community structure although the relative abundance of some taxa belonging to Clostridiales was altered. Conclusions- In conclusion, the impact of the gut  on atherosclerosis is dietary dependent and is associated with plasma cholesterol levels.

These molecules are closely related to the development of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. A rapid, sensitive and accurate method has been developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), choline and betaine in human plasma using d9-trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), d9-choline, d9-betaine as the internal standard (IS). After methanol precipitation with 10 μL plasma samples, the analytes were extracted and then separated on Amide column (2.1 × 100 mm, 1.7 μm, waters) with an isocratic elution program consisting of acetonitrile-water (containing 10 mM ammonium formate pH = 3.0) at a flow of 400 μL/min. The detection was achieved under the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) scan using positive electrospray ionization (ESI+) in 3 min. The mass transitions monitored were as follows: m/z 76.3 → 58.4 for TMAO, m/z 104.2 → 60.3 for choline, m/z 118.1 → 58.3 for betaine, m/z 85.1 → 66.3 for d9-TMAO, m/z 113.2 → 69.3 for d9-choline, and m/z 127.1 → 67.2 for d9-betaine, respectively. The method has been fully validated for specificity, lower limit of quantification, linearity, stability, intra- and inter-day accuracy and precision. This assay combines simple sample processing with a short run time and small plasma volumes, making it well suited for high-throughput routine clinical or research purposes. The newly developed method was successfully applied to the patients (n = 220) suffered from acute stroke, and the concentration of choline was firstly found to be closely related with the prognosis of these patients.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

As the HIV population is vulnerable to cardiovascular disease and can develop intestinal dysbiosis associated with systemic inflammation, we investigated the novel relationship between -derived metabolites of phosphatidylcholine and coronary atherosclerosis in HIV.One hundred and fifty-five HIV-infected and 67 non-HIV-infected individuals without known history of cardiovascular disease were previously recruited to assess coronary plaque by computed tomography angiography. In the current study, we evaluate whether serum choline, trimethylamine (TMA), or trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) levels are associated with plaque features.Young, asymptomatic HIV-infected patients (age 47 ± 7 years) demonstrated significantly higher prevalence of plaque (53 vs. 35%, P = 0.01) and number of total plaque segments (1.8 ± 2.5 vs. 1.2 ± 2.2, P = 0.03) when compared with well matched noninfected individuals with similar comorbidities. TMA was significantly associated with calcium score (r = 0.22, P = 0.006), number of total (r = 0.20, P = 0.02) and calcified (r = 0.18, P = 0.03) plaque segments, and calcium plaque volume (r = 0.19, P = 0.02) and mass (r = 0.22, P = 0.009) in the HIV cohort only. In multivariate modeling among HIV-infected patients, TMA remained significantly associated with calcium score (P = 0.008), number of total (P = 0.005) and calcified (P = 0.02) plaque segments, and calcium plaque volume (P = 0.01) and mass (P = 0.007), independent of Framingham risk score.

It has recently been found that the human β-defensin-2 can enhance the pathogenic potential of P. fluorescens. In this study, we evaluated the effect of other intestinal molecules (5HT, SP and Epi) on growth and virulence of the clinical strain P. fluorescens MFN1032. We found that P. fluorescens MFN1032 growth was not mainly affected by these factors, but several modifications in the virulence behavior of this bacterium were observed. 5HT, SP and Epi were able to modulate the motility of P. fluorescens MFN1032. 5HT and SP had an effect on pyoverdin production and IL-8 secretion, respectively. Infection of Caco-2/TC7 cells with P. fluorescens MFN1032 pretreated by SP or Epi enhanced the permeability of the monolayers and led to a partial delocalization of F-actin to the cytoplasm.

Trigonelline from the plant Trigonella foenum-graecum has been reported for the treatment of CVD. Aim of the present study was to check the effect of trigonelline on the gut  based conversion of TMA to TMAO. Trigonelline was isolated from hydroalcoholic extract of seeds of Trigonella foenum-graecum. The isolated trigonelline was characterized through TLC and UPLC-MS. Anaerobic microbe responsible for the metabolism of choline to TMA was isolated by culturing the human gut  in choline enriched medium. The isolated bacteria was identified at molecular level based on PCR amplification of 1500bp of 16S rRNA gene sequence. Isolated FMO was used for ex vivo conversion of TMA to TMAO. Further, we investigated the effect of trigonelline in isolated gut microbe based metabolism of choline, lipid profile and TMAO levels in mice with or without suppression of gut  with antibiotics. Liquid-liquid purification and chromatographic analysis confirmed the trigonelline purity (87.26%) and which was also confirmed by mass spectroscopy with m/z 137.4 in positive ionization mode. A total of 30 anaerobic microbes responsible for TMA production were isolated and Citrobacter freundii was the superior among others for the production of TMA. In vitro culture of C. freundii in choline enriched medium supplemented with trigonelline resulted in significantly reduction TMA and followed by TMAO production. In ex vivo, a maximum of 85.3% TMAO production was reduced by trigonelline at concentration of about 300 μg/mL. Serum level of lipids and TMAO were significantly altered in choline fed animals with or without suppression of gut  and this phenomenon was reversed upon the oral administration of trigonelline in a dose-dependent manner. This study demonstrates the effect of trigonelline on gut  responsible for choline metabolism and this can be used as a model for evaluation of herbal drugs and its effect in gut  prompted cardiovascular disorders.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

An alternative pathway of TMAO formation from carnitine is via the -dependent intermediate γ-butyrobetaine (γBB). Elevated TMAO levels are associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), but little is known about TMAO in obesity. Given the proposed contribution of  alterations in obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), we investigated the potential impact of obesity, lifestyle-induced weight loss, and bariatric surgery on plasma levels of TMAO, its -dependent intermediate γBB, and its diet-dependent precursors carnitine and choline.TMAO, γBB, carnitine, and choline were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography in 34 obese individuals (17 with and 17 without T2D) undergoing bariatric surgery and 17 controls.TMAO was not elevated in obese patients or reduced by lifestyle interventions but increased approximately twofold after bariatric surgery. Similar to TMAO, plasma levels of γBB were not influenced by lifestyle interventions but increased moderately after bariatric surgery. In contrast, carnitine and choline, which are abundant in nutrients, such as in red meat and eggs, and not  dependent, were reduced after lifestyle interventions and rebounded after bariatric surgery.The major increase in TMAO after bariatric surgery was unexpected because high TMAO levels have been linked to CVD, whereas bariatric surgery is known to reduce CVD risk.

EAL plays a role in human gut -based disease conditions, and physicochemical studies provide insight into protein structure and mechanism, toward potential therapeutics. Temperature dependences of the rotational correlation times (τ; detection range, 10 ≤ τ ≤ 10 s) and the corresponding weights of TEMPOL tumbling components from 200 to 265 K in the presence of EAL are measured in two frozen systems: (1) water-only and (2) 1% v/v dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). In the water-only condition, a protein-vicinal solvent component detectably fluidizes at 230 K and melts the surrounding ice-crystalline region with increasing T, creating a bounded, relatively high-viscosity aqueous solvent domain, up to 265 K. In the EAL, 1% v/v DMSO condition, two distinct concentric solvent phases are resolved around EAL: protein-associated domain (PAD) and mesodomain. The DMSO aqueous mesodomain fluidizes at 200 K, followed by PAD fluidization at 210 K.

In the anoxic environment of the healthy human gut, many important microbial metabolic transformations are performed by radical-dependent enzymes. Although identifying and characterizing these enzymes has been challenging, recent advances in genome and metagenome sequencing have enabled studies of their chemistry and biology.

RNA sequencing analysis of  isolated from monoassociated wild type and IL-10 mice identified 408 genes including 14 genes of the  utilization () locus that were significantly up-regulated in response to inflammation. Despite considerable up-regulation of  genes, deletion of  utilization (Δ) had no impact on  colitogenic activity in monoassociated IL-10 mice. However, replacement of the  wild type bacteria by a Δ mutant in SIHUMI-colonized IL-10 mice resulted in exacerbated colitis, suggesting protective functions of   utilization in complex bacterial communities. To better understand  gene response in the presence of other microbes, we purified wild type  cells from the colon content of SIHUMI-colonized wild type and IL-10 mice using immuno-magnetic separation and performed RNA sequencing. Transcriptional profiling revealed that the bacterial environment reprograms  gene expression in response to inflammation, with the majority of differentially expressed genes not being shared between monocolonized and SIHUMI conditions. While in  monoassociation a general bacterial stress response could be observed, expression of  genes in SIHUMI-colonized mice was characterized by up-regulation of genes involved in growth and replication. Interestingly, in mice colonized with SIHUMI lacking  enhanced inflammation was observed in comparison to SIHUMI-colonized mice, supporting the hypothesis that   metabolism protects against colitis in complex consortia.

Here, we investigate the impact of targeted inhibition of the first step in TMAO generation, commensal microbial TMA production, on diet-induced atherosclerosis. A structural analog of choline, 3,3-dimethyl-1-butanol (DMB), is shown to non-lethally inhibit TMA formation from cultured microbes, to inhibit distinct microbial TMA lyases, and to both inhibit TMA production from physiologic polymicrobial cultures (e.g., intestinal contents, human feces) and reduce TMAO levels in mice fed a high-choline or L-carnitine diet. DMB inhibited choline diet-enhanced endogenous macrophage foam cell formation and atherosclerotic lesion development in apolipoprotein e(-/-) mice without alterations in circulating cholesterol levels.

We hypothesized that a short-term, high-fat diet would increase fasting and postprandial plasma concentrations of TMAO in response to a high-fat meal challenge. Following a 2-week eucaloric control diet, 10 nonobese men (18-30 years) consumed a eucaloric, high-fat diet (55% fat) for 5 days. Plasma TMAO was measured after a 12-hour fast and each hour after for 4 hours following a high-fat meal (63% fat) at baseline and after the high-fat diet using ultraperformance liquid chromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry. Fasting plasma TMAO did not increase significantly following the high-fat diet (1.83 ± 0.21 vs 1.6 ± 0.24 μmol/L). However, plasma TMAO was higher at hour 1 (2.15 ± 0.28 vs 1.7 ± 0.30 μmol/L), hour 2 (2.3 ± 0.29 vs 1.8 ± 0.32 μmol/L), hour 3 (2.4 ± 0.34 vs 1.58 ± 0.19 μmol/L), and hour 4 (2.51 ± 0.33 vs 1.5 ± 0.12 μmol/L) (all P < .05) following the high-fat diet as compared with the baseline postprandial response.

Today money has become the sole life essential need. Contrarily none of the animals needs to earn money. Brain is also an organ of the human body with a unique thought process to define logical actions to achieve a person's goals. This way life is a flow of desires followed by logical actions. The person struggles to attain desired goals via the allostatic load but a perceived insurmountable threat can make his flow of life stalled to freeze him.

Adrenalin being the primary mediator of Cori cycle is also well known.

Anaerobic microbial choline metabolism, a disease-associated metabolic pathway, exemplifies this challenge, as the specific human gut microorganisms responsible for this transformation have not yet been clearly identified. In this study, we established the link between a bacterial gene cluster, the choline utilization (cut) cluster, and anaerobic choline metabolism in human gut isolates by combining transcriptional, biochemical, bioinformatic, and cultivation-based approaches. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis and in vitro biochemical characterization of two cut gene products linked the entire cluster to growth on choline and supported a model for this pathway. Analyses of sequenced bacterial genomes revealed that the cut cluster is present in many human gut bacteria, is predictive of choline utilization in sequenced isolates, and is widely but discontinuously distributed across multiple bacterial phyla. Given that bacterial phylogeny is a poor marker for choline utilization, we were prompted to develop a degenerate PCR-based method for detecting the key functional gene choline TMA-lyase (cutC) in genomic and metagenomic DNA. Using this tool, we found that new choline-metabolizing gut isolates universally possessed cutC. We also demonstrated that this gene is widespread in stool metagenomic data sets. Overall, this work represents a crucial step toward understanding anaerobic choline metabolism in the human gut  and underscores the importance of examining this microbial community from a function-oriented perspective.Anaerobic choline utilization is a bacterial metabolic activity that occurs in the human gut and is linked to multiple diseases. While bacterial genes responsible for choline fermentation (the cut gene cluster) have been recently identified, there has been no characterization of these genes in human gut isolates and microbial communities. In this work, we use multiple approaches to demonstrate that the pathway encoded by the cut genes is present and functional in a diverse range of human gut bacteria and is also widespread in stool metagenomes. We also developed a PCR-based strategy to detect a key functional gene (cutC) involved in this pathway and applied it to characterize newly isolated choline-utilizing strains. Both our analyses of the cut gene cluster and this molecular tool will aid efforts to further understand the role of choline metabolism in the human gut  and its link to disease.Copyright © 2015 Martínez-del Campo et al.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26235933>Trimethylamine N-Oxide From Gut  in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients: Focus on Diet.</a></h2><p>Low-protein diet is the recommended nutritional intervention for nondialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients because excess protein intake can damage kidney function and produce uremic toxins.

Recent studies on the gut  will unveil evolved mechanisms of the host to affect bacterial QS and shape bacterial composition. Bacterial autoinducers (AIs) could talk to the host's gut by eliciting proinflammatory effects and modulating the activities of T lymphocyte, macrophage, dendritic cells, and neutrophils. In addition, the gut mucosa could interfere with bacterial AIs by degrading them or secreting AI mimics. Moreover, bacterial AIs and gut hormones epinephrine and noradrenaline may be interchangeable in the crosstalk between the  and human gut. Therefore, inter-kingdom signaling between gut  and host may provide a novel target in the management of gut -related conditions or diseases in the future.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28220901>Distinct signatures of dental plaque metabolic byproducts dictated by periodontal inflammatory status.</a></h2><p>Onset of chronic periodontitis is associated with an aberrant polymicrobial community, termed dysbiosis. Findings regarding its etiology obtained using high-throughput sequencing technique suggested that dysbiosis holds a conserved metabolic signature as an emergent property. The purpose of this study was to identify robust biomarkers for periodontal inflammation severity. Furthermore, we investigated disease-associated metabolic signatures of periodontal  using a salivary metabolomics approach. Whole saliva samples were obtained from adult subjects before and after removal of supragingival plaque (debridement). Periodontal inflamed surface area (PISA) was employed as an indicator of periodontal inflammatory status. Based on multivariate analyses using pre-debridement salivary metabolomics data, we found that metabolites associated with higher PISA included cadaverine and hydrocinnamate, while uric acid and  were associated with lower PISA. Next, we focused on dental plaque metabolic byproducts by selecting salivary metabolites significantly decreased following debridement. Metabolite set enrichment analysis revealed that polyamine metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, butyric acid metabolism, and lysine degradation were distinctive metabolic signatures of dental plaque in the high PISA group, which may be related to the metabolic signatures of disease-associated communities. Collectively, our findings identified potential biomarkers of periodontal inflammatory status and also provide insight into metabolic signatures of dysbiotic communities.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26585860>The relationship between early-life environment, the epigenome and the .</a></h2><p>Children exposed to early-life adversity carry a greater risk of poor health and disease into adulthood.

Therefore, we investigated associations between plasma biomarkers of choline metabolism [choline, betaine, dimethylglycine, and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO)] and colorectal cancer risk among postmenopausal women in a case-control study nested within the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study. We selected 835 matched case-control pairs, and cases were further stratified by tumor site (proximal, distal, or rectal) and stage (local/regional or metastatic). Colorectal cancer was assessed by self-report and confirmed by medical records over the mean of 5.2 years of follow-up. Baseline plasma choline metabolites were measured by LC/MS-MS. In multivariable-adjusted conditional logistic regression models, plasma choline tended to be positively associated with rectal cancer risk [OR (95% confidence interval, CI)(highest vs. lowest quartile) = 2.44 (0.93-6.40); P trend = 0.08], whereas plasma betaine was inversely associated with colorectal cancer overall [0.68 (0.47-0.99); P trend = 0.01] and with local/regional tumors [0.64 (0.42-0.99); P trend = 0.009]. Notably, the plasma betaine:choline ratio was inversely associated with colorectal cancer overall [0.56 (0.39-0.82); P trend = 0.004] as well as with proximal [0.66 (0.41-1.06); P trend = 0.049], rectal [0.27 (0.10-0.78); P trend = 0.02], and local/regional [0.50 (0.33-0.76); P trend = 0.001] tumors. Finally, plasma TMAO, an oxidative derivative of choline produced by intestinal bacteria, was positively associated with rectal cancer [3.38 (1.25-9.16); P trend = 0.02] and with overall colorectal cancer risk among women with lower (vs. higher) plasma vitamin B12 levels (P interaction = 0.003). Collectively, these data suggest that alterations in choline metabolism, which may arise early in disease development, may be associated with higher risk of colorectal cancer. The positive association between plasma TMAO and colorectal cancer risk is consistent with an involvement of the gut  in colorectal cancer pathogenesis.©2014 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30031584>Supplementing phytogenic compounds or autolyzed yeast modulates ruminal biogenic amines and plasma metabolome in dry cows experiencing subacute ruminal acidosis.</a></h2><p>Subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) causes ruminal dysbiosis, thereby increasing the risk of systemic metabolic disorders in cattle. We recently showed that supplementation with phytogenic compounds (PHY) or autolyzed yeast (AY) counteracted negative effects of SARA by improving ruminal pH and . This study investigated the effects of an intermittent SARA challenge on the ruminal concentration of biogenic amines (BA) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS), as well as on the blood metabolome. We also evaluated effects of PHY and AY on the latter variables. Eight rumen-cannulated nonlactating Holstein cows were arranged in an incomplete 4 × 3 Latin square design with 4 experimental runs and 3 treatment groups. During each run, cows were switched from an all-forage diet (baseline) to an intermittent concentrate-challenge diet with a forage:concentrate ratio of 35:65 (dry matter basis) to induce SARA for 1 (SARA1) or 2 (SARA2) wk, separated by 1 wk of forage-only feeding. The 3 treatment groups were no additive as control, PHY, or AY. During baseline, SARA1 and SARA2 rumen fluid samples were collected for analysis of BA and LPS. Blood samples were taken during baseline and SARA1 for a targeted metabolomics approach. High-concentrate feeding caused a 9-fold increase in ruminal LPS during SARA1 and an 11-fold increase in SARA2 compared with the baseline. Elevated concentrations of ruminal BA were found during both SARA periods, with histamine showing the strongest increase during SARA1. Moreover, a decrease in phosphatidylcholines, lysophosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelines, and several AA in the blood during SARA1 were detected. Supplementation of PHY decreased concentrations of LPS (-43%), histamine (-66%), pyrrolidine (-38%), and spermine (-54%) in SARA1 and cadaverine in SARA2 (-50%). Moreover, cows that received PHY had higher concentrations of cholesterol (+26%), several AA, and phosphatidylcholines in SARA1 compared with control cows. For AY, decreases in ruminal  (-21%), methylamine (-52%), histamine (-54%), spermidine (-44%), and spermine (-80%) in SARA1 were observed, whereas in the blood an increase in tryptophan was noticed. In conclusion, the SARA was associated with markedly increased concentrations of LPS and BA in the rumen fluid and undesirable shifts in the plasma metabolome. Supplementation of PHY and AY counteracted some of these changes and therefore may help in attenuating negative effects of high-concentrate feeding in dairy cattle.The Authors.

We aimed to determine the prognostic value of TMAO and its dietary precursors, choline and betaine, in heart failure (HF).In 112 patients with chronic systolic HF with comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation, we measured plasma TMAO, choline, and betaine by mass spectrometry. Median (interquartile range) TMAO levels, choline, and betaine levels were 5.8 (3.6-12.1) μmol/L, 10.9 (8.4-14.0) μmol/L, and 43.8 (37.1-53.0) μmol/L, respectively, and were correlated with each other (all P < .0001 for both). TMAO levels were significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus (9.4 [4.9-13.2] vs 4.8 [3.4-9.8] μmol/L; P = .005) and in subjects with New York Heart Association functional class III or greater (7.0 [4.7-14.8] vs 4.7 [3.4-11.3] μmol/L; P = .02). Elevated TMAO, choline, and betaine levels were each associated with higher plasma N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels and more advanced left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, but not systolic dysfunction or inflammatory and endothelial biomarkers. Higher choline (hazard ratio [HR] 1.64, 95% CI 1.22-2.20; P = .001), betaine (HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.10-2.08; P = .01), and TMAO (HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.10-1.96; P = .01) predicted increased risk for 5-year adverse clinical events (death/transplantation). Only higher TMAO levels predicted incident adverse clinical events independently from age, estimated glomerular filtration rate, mitral E/septal Ea, and NT-proBNP levels (HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.03-2.14; P = .03).Elevated plasma TMAO, choline, and betaine levels are each associated with more advanced left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and portend poorer long-term adverse clinical outcomes in chronic systolic HF. However, only higher plasma TMAO was associated with poor prognosis after adjustment for cardiorenal indices.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The high nutrient competition between the commensal  and AIEC pathobiont requires the latter to occupy their own metabolic niches to survive and proliferate within the gut. In this study, a global RNA sequencing of AIEC strain LF82 has been used to observe the impact of bile salts on the expression of metabolic genes. The results showed a global up-regulation of genes involved in degradation and a down-regulation of those implicated in biosynthesis. The main up-regulated degradation pathways were , 1,2-propanediol and citrate utilization, as well as the methyl-citrate pathway. Our study reveals that  utilization bestows a competitive advantage of AIEC strains that are metabolically capable of its degradation in the presence of bile salts. We observed that bile salts activated secondary metabolism pathways that communicate to provide an energy benefit to AIEC. Bile salts may be used by AIEC as an environmental signal to promote their colonization.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29563342>Untargeted metabolomics identifies trimethyllysine, a TMAO-producing nutrient precursor, as a predictor of incident cardiovascular disease risk.</a></h2><p>Using an untargeted metabolomics approach in initial (N = 99 subjects) and replication cohorts (N = 1,162), we discovered and structurally identified a plasma metabolite associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks, N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine (trimethyllysine, TML). Stable-isotope-dilution tandem mass spectrometry analyses of an independent validation cohort (N = 2,140) confirmed TML levels are independently associated with incident (3-year) major adverse cardiovascular event risks (hazards ratio [HR], 2.4; 95% CI, 1.7-3.4) and incident (5-year) mortality risk (HR, 2.9; 95% CI, 2.0-4.2). Genome-wide association studies identified several suggestive loci for TML levels, but none reached genome-wide significance; and d9(trimethyl)-TML isotope tracer studies confirmed TML can serve as a nutrient precursor for gut -dependent generation of trimethylamine (TMA) and the atherogenic metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). Although TML was shown to be abundant in both plant- and animal-derived foods, mouse and human fecal cultures (omnivores and vegans) showed slow conversion of TML to TMA. Furthermore, unlike chronic dietary choline, TML supplementation in mice failed to elevate plasma TMAO or heighten thrombosis potential in vivo. Thus, TML is identified as a strong predictor of incident CVD risks in subjects and to serve as a dietary precursor for gut -dependent generation of TMAO; however, TML does not appear to be a major microbial source for TMAO generation in vivo.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27345328>Adrenergic and noradrenergic regulation of poultry behavior and production.</a></h2><p>Norepinephrine and epinephrine (noradrenaline and adrenaline) are integral in maintaining behavioral and physiological homeostasis during both aversive and rewarding events.

CKD patients had higher percentages of opportunistic pathogens from gamma-Proteobacteria and reduced percentages of beneficial microbes, such as Roseburia, Coprococcus, and Ruminococcaceae. The PICRUSt analysis demonstrated that eight genes involved in choline, betaine, L-carnitine and trimethylamine (TMA) metabolism were changed in the CKD patients. Moreover, we transferred faecal samples from CKD patients and healthy controls into antibiotic-treated C57BL/6 mice and found that the mice that received gut microbes from the CKD patients had significantly higher plasma TMAO levels and different composition of gut  than did the comparative mouse group.

Chronic stress can cause behavioral, cognitive, biochemical, and gut  aberrations. Gut bacteria can communicate with the host through the -gut-brain axis (which mainly includes the immune, neuroendocrine, and neural pathways) to influence brain and behavior. It is hypothesized that administration of probiotics can improve chronic-stress-induced depression. In order to examine this hypothesis, the chronic restraint stress depression model was established in this study. Adult specific pathogen free (SPF) Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 21 days of restraint stress followed by behavioral testing (including the sucrose preference test (SPT), elevated-plus maze test, open-field test (OFT), object recognition test (ORT), and object placement test (OPT)) and biochemical analysis. Supplemental Lactobacillus helveticus NS8 was provided every day during stress until the end of experiment, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram (CIT) served as a positive control. Results showed that L. helveticus NS8 improved chronic restraint stress-induced behavioral (anxiety and depression) and cognitive dysfunction, showing an effect similar to and better than that of CIT. L. helveticus NS8 also resulted in lower plasma corticosterone (CORT) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels, higher plasma interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels, restored hippocampal serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) levels, and more hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA expression than in chronic stress rats. Taken together, these results indicate an anti-depressant effect of L. helveticus NS8 in rats subjected to chronic restraint stress depression and that this effect could be due to the -gut-brain axis. They also suggest the therapeutic potential of L. helveticus NS8 in stress-related and possibly other kinds of depression.Copyright © 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

There is emerging evidence that bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain affects behaviours including anxiety, cognition, nociception and social interaction. Coordinated locomotor behaviour is critical for the survival and propagation of animals, and is regulated by internal and external sensory inputs. However, little is known about how the gut  influences host locomotion, or the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved. Here we report that germ-free status or antibiotic treatment results in hyperactive locomotor behaviour in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Increased walking speed and daily activity in the absence of a gut  are rescued by mono-colonization with specific bacteria, including the fly commensal Lactobacillus brevis. The bacterial enzyme xylose isomerase from L. brevis recapitulates the locomotor effects of microbial colonization by modulating sugar metabolism in flies. Notably, thermogenetic activation of octopaminergic neurons or exogenous administration of octopamine, the invertebrate counterpart of noradrenaline, abrogates the effects of xylose isomerase on Drosophila locomotion. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated role for the gut  in modulating locomotion, and identify octopaminergic neurons as mediators of peripheral microbial cues that regulate motor behaviour in animals.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26699388>Choline Diet and Its Gut Microbe-Derived Metabolite, Trimethylamine N-Oxide, Exacerbate Pressure Overload-Induced Heart Failure.</a></h2><p>Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a gut microbe-dependent metabolite of dietary choline and other trimethylamine-containing nutrients, is both elevated in the circulation of patients having heart failure and heralds worse overall prognosis. In animal studies, dietary choline or TMAO significantly accelerates atherosclerotic lesion development in ApoE-deficient mice, and reduction in TMAO levels inhibits atherosclerosis development in the low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout mouse.C57BL6/J mice were fed either a control diet, a diet containing choline (1.2%) or a diet containing TMAO (0.12%) starting 3 weeks before surgical transverse aortic constriction. Mice were studied for 12 weeks after transverse aortic constriction. Cardiac function and left ventricular structure were monitored at 3-week intervals using echocardiography. Twelve weeks post transverse aortic constriction, myocardial tissues were collected to evaluate cardiac and vascular fibrosis, and blood samples were evaluated for cardiac brain natriuretic peptide, choline, and TMAO levels. Pulmonary edema, cardiac enlargement, and left ventricular ejection fraction were significantly (P<0.05, each) worse in mice fed either TMAO- or choline-supplemented diets when compared with the control diet.

Plasma TMAO levels in subjects (n > 4,000) independently predicted incident (3 years) thrombosis (heart attack, stroke) risk. Direct exposure of platelets to TMAO enhanced sub-maximal stimulus-dependent platelet activation from multiple agonists through augmented Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores.

Interestingly, functional and inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases are often reported as a comorbidity in ASDs, indicating gut-brain axis as a novel emerging approach. Recently, a central role for peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-α has been addressed in neurological functions, associated with the behaviour. Among endogenous lipids, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), a PPAR-α agonist, has been extensively studied for its anti-inflammatory effects both at central and peripheral level. Based on this background, the aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacological effects of PEA on autistic-like behaviour of BTBR T+tf/J mice and to shed light on the contributing mechanisms. Our results showed that PEA reverted the altered behavioural phenotype of BTBR mice, and this effect was contingent to PPAR-α activation. Moreover, PEA was able to restore hippocampal BDNF signalling pathway, and improve mitochondrial dysfunction, both pathological aspects, known to be consistently associated with ASDs. Furthermore, PEA reduced the overall inflammatory state of BTBR mice, reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines at hippocampal, serum, and colonic level. The analysis of gut permeability and the expression of colonic tight junctions showed a reduction of leaky gut in PEA-treated BTBR mice. This finding together with PEA effect on gut  composition suggests an involvement of -gut-brain axis. In conclusion, our results demonstrated a therapeutic potential of PEA in limiting ASD symptoms, through its pleiotropic mechanism of action, supporting neuroprotection, anti-inflammatory effects, and the modulation of gut-brain axis.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

The discovery that a different microbial composition can influence behavior and cognition, and in turn the nervous system can indirectly influence enteric  composition, has significantly contributed to establish the well-accepted concept of gut-brain axis. This hypothesis is supported by several evidence showing mutual mechanisms, which involve the vague nerve, the immune system, the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis modulation and the bacteria-derived metabolites. Many studies have focused on delineating a role for this axis in health and disease, ranging from stress-related disorders such as depression, anxiety and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, and to neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson Disease, Alzheimer's Disease etc. Based on this background, and considering the relevance of alteration of the symbiotic state between host and , this review focuses on the role and the involvement of bioactive lipids, such as the N-acylethanolamine (NAE) family whose main members are N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA), palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and oleoilethanolamide (OEA), and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as butyrate, belonging to a large group of bioactive lipids able to modulate peripheral and central pathologic processes. Their effective role has been studied in inflammation, acute and chronic pain, obesity and central nervous system diseases. A possible correlation has been shown between these lipids and gut  through different mechanisms. Indeed, systemic administration of specific bacteria can reduce abdominal pain through the involvement of cannabinoid receptor 1 in the rat; on the other hand, PEA reduces inflammation markers in a murine model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and butyrate, producted by gut , is effective in reducing inflammation and pain in irritable bowel syndrome and IBD animal models. In this review, we underline the relationship among inflammation, pain,  and the different lipids, focusing on a possible involvement of NAEs and SCFAs in the gut-brain axis and their role in the central nervous system diseases.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29974463>Analysis of metabolic profiles of generalized aggressive periodontitis.</a></h2><p>The specific pathogenesis of generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAgP) has not yet been clarified, and few studies have focused on the association between GAgP and metabolomics. To elucidate the roles of metabolic profiles in the status of GAgP, this study aimed to identify the differential metabolic profiles between patients with GAgP and healthy controls using an untargeted metabolomic profiling method.Serum and gingival crevicular fluid samples were collected from healthy controls (n = 20) and patients with GAgP (n = 20) in this cross-sectional study. The relative levels of biomarkers in the samples were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Principal components analysis and orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis were used for statistical analysis. Metabolites were analysed qualitatively using the FiehnLib and NIST databases. Full-mouth probing depth and clinical attachment loss were recorded as indexes of periodontal disease.A total of 349 metabolites were qualitatively detected in the gingival crevicular fluid samples, and 200 metabolites were detected in the serum samples. Compared with healthy controls, patients with GAgP showed significant increases in serum urea and allo-inositol levels. In contrast, glutathione, 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde, adipic acid and 2-deoxyguanosine levels were decreased in patients with GAgP. In the gingival crevicular fluid samples, noradrenaline, uridine, α-tocopherol, dehydroascorbic acid, xanthine, galactose, glucose-1-phosphate and ribulose-5-phosphate levels were increased in patients with GAgP, while thymidine, glutathione and ribose-5-phosphate levels were decreased.The metabolomics analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry is an effective and minimally non-invasive way to differentiate the metabolites characteristic of patients with GAgP. Both serum and gingival crevicular fluid metabolomics are significantly different between patients with GAgP and healthy controls. These metabolic profiles have great potential in detecting GAgP and helping to understand its underlying mechanisms.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

While IBD in adults has shown to be associated with marked changes in body fluid metabolomics, there are only few studies in children. Hence, this prospective study addressed the faecal and serum metabolomics in newly diagnosed paediatric IBD.Paediatric patients with IBD undergoing diagnostic endoscopies and controls also with endoscopy but no signs of inflammation provided blood and stool samples in a tertiary care hospital. Blood inflammatory markers and faecal calprotectin levels were determined. The serum and faecal metabolomics were determined using ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer.Serum and faecal metabolite profiles in newly diagnosed paediatric IBD patients were different from healthy controls and categorized Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis [UC] patients into separate groups. In serum, amino acid metabolism, folate biosynthesis and signalling pathways were perturbed in Crohn's disease; in UC also sphingolipid metabolic pathways were perturbed when compared to controls. In faecal samples, there was an increased level of several metabolites in UC in contrast to low or intermediate levels in Crohn's disease. There was a clear correlation with the level of inflammation, i.e. faecal calprotectin levels and the profile of various biologically important metabolites [carnosine, ribose and, most significantly, choline].Characterization of inflammatory pattern using metabolomics analysis is a promising tool for better understanding disease pathogenesis of paediatric IBD.Copyright © 2016 European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO).

Here, we assessed the impact of gut microbial choline metabolism on bacterial fitness and host biology by engineering a microbial community that lacks a single choline-utilizing enzyme. Our results indicate that choline-utilizing bacteria compete with the host for this nutrient, significantly impacting plasma and hepatic levels of methyl-donor metabolites and recapitulating biochemical signatures of choline deficiency. Mice harboring high levels of choline-consuming bacteria showed increased susceptibility to metabolic disease in the context of a high-fat diet. Furthermore, bacterially induced reduction of methyl-donor availability influenced global DNA methylation patterns in both adult mice and their offspring and engendered behavioral alterations. Our results reveal an underappreciated effect of bacterial choline metabolism on host metabolism, epigenetics, and behavior.

However, the determinants of TMAO in humans require additional assessment.We examined cardiometabolic risk factors and pathways associated with TMAO concentrations in humans.A total of 283 individuals (mean ± SD age: 66.7 ± 9.0 y) were included in this observational study. Plasma concentrations of trimethylamine, TMAO, choline, lipids, phospholipids, and methyl metabolites were measured.Study participants were divided into 4 groups by median concentrations of TMAO and choline (4.36 and 9.7 μmol/L, respectively). Compared with the group with TMAO and choline concentrations that were less than the median (n = 82), the group with TMAO and choline concentrations that were at least the median (n = 83) was older and had lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, phospholipids, and methylation potential, higher creatinine, betaine, S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), and higher percentages of men and subjects with diabetes. The difference in plasma TMAO concentrations between men and women (7.3 ± 10.0 compared with 5.4 ± 5.6 μmol/L, respectively) was NS after adjustment for age and creatinine (P = 0.455). The TMAO:trimethylamine ratio was higher in men (P < 0.001). Diabetes was associated with significantly higher plasma TMAO concentration (8.6 ± 12.2 compared with 5.4 ± 5.2 μmol/L) even after adjustments. Sex and diabetes showed an interactive effect on trimethylamine concentrations (P = 0.010) but not on TMAO concentrations (P = 0.950). Positive determinants of TMAO in a stepwise regression model that applied to the whole group were SAH, trimethylamine, choline, and female sex, whereas plasma phosphatidylcholine was a negative determinant.High TMAO and choline concentrations are associated with an advanced cardiometabolic risk profile. Diabetes is related to higher plasma TMAO concentrations but also to alterations in interrelated pathways such as lipids, phospholipids, and methylation.

To gain molecular insight into these processes toward development of potential therapeutic targets, reactions of the cryotrapped (S)-2-aminopropanol substrate radical EAL from Salmonella typhimurium are addressed over a temperature (T) range of 220-250 K by using T-step reaction initiation and time-resolved, full-spectrum electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The observed substrate radical reaction kinetics are characterized by two pairs of biexponential processes: native decay to diamagnetic products and growth of a non-native radical species and Co(II) in cobalamin. The multicomponent low-T kinetics are simulated by using a minimal model, in which the substrate-radical macrostate, S, is partitioned by a free-energy barrier into two sequential microstates: 1) S, a relatively high-entropy/high-enthalpy microstate with a protein configuration that captures the nascent substrate radical in the terminal step of radical-pair separation; and 2) S, a relatively low-enthalpy/low-entropy microstate with a protein configuration that enables the rearrangement reaction. The non-native, destructive reaction of S at T ≤ 250 K is caused by a prolonged lifetime in the substrate-radical capture state. Monotonic S decay over 278-300 K indicates that the free-energy barrier to S and S interconversion is latent at physiological T-values. Overall, the low-temperature studies reveal two protein-configuration microstates and connecting protein-configurational transitions that specialize the S macrostate for the dual functional roles of radical capture and rearrangement enabling. The identification of new, to our knowledge, intermediate states and specific protein-fluctuation contributions to the reaction coordinate represent an advance toward development of novel therapeutic targets in EAL.Copyright © 2018 Biophysical Society.

Sustained CH is catastrophic, resulting in cardiac dysfunction that eventually leads to heart failure (HF). Baoyuan decoction (BYD) is a famous traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula for supplementing and reinforcing Qi, clinically used for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, the therapeutic effects of BYD on CH remain unidentified. We herein investigated the effect of BYD on isoproterenol (ISO)-induced CH in rats and the underlying mechanisms by comprehensive pharmacodynamics and H NMR-based dynamic metabolomics analysis of the plasma and urine samples. Results showed that BYD treatment markedly attenuated ISO-induced CH as evidenced by decreasing the left ventricular wall thickness, pathological cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, myocardial collagen fiber deposition and apoptosis, and plasma natriuretic peptide levels. Multivariate trajectory analysis revealed that the BYD treatment could restore the CH-disturbed plasma and urinary metabolite profiles towards the normal metabolic status featuring with a time-dependent tendency. Moreover, the key metabolic alterations in CH rats at different BYD-treated time stages involved energy metabolism, oxidative stress responses, amino acid metabolism, and gut  metabolism. Of particularly, the significant roles of BYD for treating CH lie in the improvement of cardiac energy generation and antioxidant capacity. Our investigation provides a holistic view of BYD for therapeutic intervention of CH through monitoring of the dynamic metabolic changes and the results indicate that BYD may be applied as a potential agent for treating CH.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Gut microbial metabolism of choline results in the production of trimethylamine (TMA), which upon absorption by the host is converted in the liver to trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). Recent studies revealed that TMAO exacerbates atherosclerosis in mice and positively correlates with the severity of this disease in humans. However, which microbes contribute to TMA production in the human gut, the extent to which host factors (e.g., genotype) and diet affect TMA production and colonization of these microbes, and the effects TMA-producing microbes have on the bioavailability of dietary choline remain largely unknown. We screened a collection of 79 sequenced human intestinal isolates encompassing the major phyla found in the human gut and identified nine strains capable of producing TMA from choline in vitro. Gnotobiotic mouse studies showed that TMAO accumulates in the serum of animals colonized with TMA-producing species, but not in the serum of animals colonized with intestinal isolates that do not generate TMA from choline in vitro. Remarkably, low levels of colonization by TMA-producing bacteria significantly reduced choline levels available to the host. This effect was more pronounced as the abundance of TMA-producing bacteria increased. Our findings provide a framework for designing strategies aimed at changing the representation or activity of TMA-producing bacteria in the human gut and suggest that the TMA-producing status of the gut  should be considered when making recommendations about choline intake requirements for humans.Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, and increased trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) levels have been causally linked with CVD development. This work identifies members of the human gut  responsible for both the accumulation of trimethylamine (TMA), the precursor of the proatherogenic compound TMAO, and subsequent decreased choline bioavailability to the host. Understanding how to manipulate the representation and function of choline-consuming, TMA-producing species in the intestinal  could potentially lead to novel means for preventing or treating atherosclerosis and choline deficiency-associated diseases.Copyright © 2015 Romano et al.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28875318>Influence of gut  on the development and progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterized by the presence of steatosis, inflammation, and ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes, with or without fibrosis.

It remains unknown whether TMAO is associated with the risk of first stroke. We aimed to determine the association between serum TMAO levels and first stroke in hypertensive patients without major cardiovascular diseases and examine any possible effect modifiers. Methods- We used a nested case-control design, using data from the CSPPT (China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial), including 622 patients with first stroke and 622 matched controls. The study was conducted from May 2008 to August 2013. The primary outcome was a first stroke. Results- After adjusting for choline, L-carnitine, and other important covariates, including baseline systolic blood pressure and time-averaged systolic blood pressure, during the treatment period, the risk of first stroke increased with each increment of TMAO level (per natural log [TMAO] increment: odds ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.02-1.46). Consistently, compared with participants in the lowest tertile (<1.79 μmol/L) of serum TMAO levels, a significantly higher risk of first stroke was found in those in higher TMAO tertiles (≥1.79 μmol/L; odds ratio, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.00-1.81) or in TMAO tertile 3 (≥3.19 μmol/L; odds ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.02-2.01). In the exploratory analysis, we observed an interaction between TMAO and folate levels (≥7.7 [median] versus <7.7 ng/mL) on first stroke ( P for interaction, 0.030). Conclusions- Higher TMAO levels were associated with increased risk of first stroke in hypertensive patients. Our finding, if further confirmed, calls for a carefully designed clinical trial to further evaluate the role of higher TMAO levels on outcomes in hypertensive patients.

Stomach retention of beads was 77% for WKY compared with 35% for SD rats. GI transit was decreased by 34% (9 h) and 21% (12 h) in WKY compared with SD rats.

This study investigates an industrial (1,200 m³) cooling-lubrication circuit (CLC) that has been in operation for 20 years and is supposedly in an ecological equilibrium, thus offering a unique habitat.

Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes dominated the effluent and influent sites, while Alcaligenes faecalis dominated biofilms, and both species were identified as the major TEA degrading bacteria. It was shown that a 15 min heat treatment at 50°C was able to slow down the growth of both species, a promising option to control TEA degradation at large scale.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26895493>NMR-based metabonomic analysis of normal rat urine and faeces in response to (±)-venlafaxine treatment.</a></h2><p>(±)-Venlafaxine, a bicyclic antidepressant of the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) class, is prescribed for the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders. As is the case with other antidepressants, its precise mechanisms of action are still unknown. Pharmacometabonomic approaches allow for the detection of diverse metabolites, unlike classic methods for analysing drug interaction based on single metabolites and linear pathways. This provides a global view of the state of homeostasis during treatment and an insight into the mechanisms of action of a drug. Accordingly, the final outcome of treatment is characterised by the network of reactome pathways derived from the on-target and off-target effects of the drug. Regarding antidepressants, the drug network may be located in the gut--brain-liver-kidney-immune-cardiovascular system axis (GMBLKICA), implying that neurotransmitters participate as signalling molecules in bidirectional communication. If their bioavailability is increased, this communication and the state of homeostasis may be disrupted. With a pharmacometabonomic approach using NMR in combination with different chemometric methods, a determination was made of subtle changes in the metabolic profile (metabotype) of urine and faeces in normal Wistar rats following a single administration of pharmacological doses of (±)-venlafaxine hydrochloride. Based on the drug-response metabotypes observed, (±)-venlafaxine had effects on gut microbial co-metabolites and osmolytes. Hence, it can be hypothesized that bidirectional communication in the multiorgan axis was perturbed by this drug, and very likely by its active metabolite, (±)-desvenlafaxine. This disrupted signalling could be related not only to therapeutic and adverse effects, but also to the lag period in treatment response.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Gut-liver communication and  composition have been identified as critical drivers of the NAFLD progression. Hence, it has been shown that  depletion can ameliorate high-fat diet or western-diet induced experimental Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, its functional implications in the methionine-choline dietary model, remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigated the physiological relevance of gut  in methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet induced NASH. Experimental liver disease was induced by 8 weeks of MCD feeding in wild-type (WT) mice, either with or without commensal  depletion, by continuous broad-spectrum antibiotic (AB) treatment. MCD diet induced steatohepatitis was accompanied by a reduced gut  diversity, indicating intestinal dysbiosis. MCD treatment prompted macroscopic shortening of the intestine, as well as intestinal villi in histology. However, gut  composition of MCD-treated mice, neither resembled human NASH, nor did it augment the intestinal barrier integrity or intestinal inflammation. In the MCD model, AB treatment resulted in increased steatohepatitis activity, compared to  proficient control mice.

TMAO is formed from trimethylamine (TMA)-precursors such as choline via the combined action of the gut  and liver. We conducted a Mediterranean diet intervention that increased intakes of fiber and changed intakes of many other foods containing fat to increase the relative amount of mono-unsaturated fats in the diet. The Mediterranean diet is associated with reduced risks of chronic diseases and might counteract the pro-inflammatory effects of increased TMAO formation. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if the Mediterranean diet would reduce TMAO concentrations. Fasting TMAO concentrations were measured before and after six-months of dietary intervention in 115 healthy people at increased risk for colon cancer. No significant changes in plasma TMAO or in the ratios of TMAO to precursor compounds were found in either the Mediterranean group or the comparison group that followed a Healthy Eating diet. TMAO concentrations exhibited positive correlations with age and markers of metabolic health. TMAO concentrations were not associated with circulating cytokines, but the relative abundance of Akkermansia mucinophilia in colon biopsies was modestly and inversely correlated with baseline TMAO, choline, and betaine serum concentrations.

This concept is often referred to as the "fetal origins hypothesis" or "developmental origins of health and disease". Since its first proposal, epigenetics has emerged as an underlying mechanism explaining how environmental cues become gestationally "encoded". Many of the enzymes that impart and maintain epigenetic modifications are highly sensitive to nutrient availability, which can be influenced by the metabolic activities of the intestinal . Therefore, the maternal  has the potential to influence epigenetics in utero and modulate offspring's long-term health trajectories. Here we summarize the current understanding of the interactions that occur between the maternal gut  and the essential nutrient choline, that is not only required for fetal development and epigenetic regulation but is also a growth substrate for some microbes. Bacteria able to metabolize choline benefit from the presence of this nutrient and compete with the host for its access, which under extreme conditions may elicit signatures of choline deficiency. Another consequence of bacterial choline metabolism is the accumulation of the pro-inflammatory, pro-thrombotic metabolite trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). Finally, we discuss how these different facets of microbial choline metabolism may influence infant development and health trajectories via epigenetic mechanisms and more broadly place a call to action to better understand how maternal microbial metabolism can shape their offspring's propensity to chronic disease development later in life.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31110206>Phosphatidylcholine synthesis through cholinephosphate cytidylyltransferase is dispensable in Leishmania major.</a></h2><p>Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is a major cell membrane constituent and precursor of important second messengers.

To investigate the role of de novo PC synthesis in Leishmania major, we focused on the cholinephosphate cytidylyltransferase (CPCT) which catalyzes the formation of CDP-choline, a key intermediate in the choline branch of the Kennedy pathway. Without CPCT, L. major parasites cannot incorporate choline into PC, yet the CPCT-null mutants contain similar levels of PC and PE as wild type parasites. Loss of CPCT does not affect the growth of parasites in complete medium or their virulence in mice. These results suggest that other mechanisms of PC synthesis can compensate the loss of CPCT. Importantly, CPCT-null parasites exhibited severe growth defects when  and exogenous lipids became limited or when they were co-cultured with certain bacteria that are known to be members of sandfly midgut .

Here, we report the surprising, opposite effect of  utilization on the commensal colonizer , namely, that loss of this metabolic capacity made it a better colonizer.Copyright © 2018 Kaval et al.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26707739>Commensal 'trail of bread crumbs' provide pathogens with a map to the intestinal landscape.</a></h2><p>Growth of a microorganism in a host is essential for infection, and bacterial pathogens have evolved to utilize specific metabolites to enhance replication in vivo. Now, emerging data demonstrate that pathogens rely on -derived metabolites as a form of bacterial-bacterial communication to gain information about location within a host and modify virulence gene expression accordingly. Thus, metabolite-sensing is critical for pathogens to establish infection. Here, we highlight recent examples of how the foodborne pathogen enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 (EHEC) exploits -derived metabolites to recognize the host intestinal environment and control gene expression that results in controlled expression of virulence traits.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Microcompartment-mediated catabolism of , a host cell breakdown product, fuels the competitive overgrowth of intestinal , both pathogenic enterohemorrhagic  and commensal strains. During a UTI, urease-negative  bacteria thrive, despite the comparative nutrient limitation in urine. The role of  as a potential nutrient source during UTIs is understudied. We evaluated the role of the metabolism of  as a potential nitrogen and carbon source for UPEC in the urinary tract. We analyzed infected urine samples by culture, high-performance liquid chromatography, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, and genomic sequencing. The  concentration in urine was comparable to the concentration of the most abundant reported urinary amino acid, d-serine. Transcription of the  operon was detected in the majority of urine samples containing  screened. All sequenced UPEC strains had conserved  operons, while metabolic genotypes previously associated with UTI (, ) were mainly limited to phylogroup B2.   was found to be utilized as a sole source of nitrogen by UPEC strains. The metabolism of  in artificial urine medium (AUM) induced metabolosome formation and provided a growth advantage at the physiological levels found in urine. Interestingly,  (which encodes acetaldehyde dehydrogenase) was required for UPEC strains to utilize  to gain a growth advantage in AUM, suggesting that  is also utilized as a carbon source. These data suggest that urinary  is a significant additional carbon and nitrogen source for infecting  strains.Copyright © 2019 Dadswell et al.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30511765>A pilot study investigating circulating trimethylamine N-oxide and its precursors in dogs with degenerative mitral valve disease with or without congestive heart failure.</a></h2><p>Pathophysiologic mechanisms for the development and progression of degenerative mitral valve disease (DMVD) remain elusive.

The volunteers were divided into two groups with increased or decreased TMAO level following choline challenge. Fresh fecal samples were collected before taking fasting blood samples for amplifying 16S rRNA V4 tags, and the PCR products were sequenced using the platform of Illumina HiSeq 2000. The differences in gut microbiata between subjects with increased and decreased plasma TMAO were analyzed using QIIME. Based on the gut  data and TMAO levels in the two groups, the prediction model was established using the machine learning random forest algorithm, and the validity of the model was tested using a verified dataset.An obvious difference was found in beta diversity of the gut microbota between the subjects with increased and decreased plasma TMAO level following choline challenge. The area under the curve (AUC) of the model was 86.39% (95% CI: 72.7%-100%). Using the verified dataset, the model showed a much higher probability for correctly predicting TMAO variation following choline challenge.The model is feasible and reliable for predicting the level of TMAO metabolism in vivo based on gut .</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29870894>Gut  and magnetic resonance spectroscopy study of subjects at ultra-high risk for psychosis may support the membrane hypothesis.</a></h2><p>The -gut-brain axis and membrane dysfunction in the brain has attracted increasing attention in the field of psychiatric research. However, the possible interactive role of gut  and brain function in the prodromal stage of schizophrenia has not been studied yet.To explore this, we collected fecal samples and performed Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) scans in 81 high risk (HR) subjects, 19 ultra-high risk (UHR) subjects and 69 health controls (HC). Then we analyzed the differences in gut  and choline concentrations in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).Presences of the orders Clostridiales, Lactobacillales and Bacteroidales were observed at increase levels in fecal samples of UHR subjects compared to the other two groups. The composition changes of gut  indicate the increased production of Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs), which could activate microglia and then disrupt membrane metabolism. Furthermore, this was confirmed by an increase of choline levels, a brain imaging marker of membrane dysfunction, which is also significantly elevated in UHR subjects compared to the HR and HC groups.Both gut  and imaging studies of UHR subjects suggest the membrane dysfunction in the brain and hence might support the membrane hypothesis of schizophrenia.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We aimed to comprehensively examine how changes induced by a weight-loss diet intervention in gut -related metabolites, such as trimethylamine -oxide (TMAO) and its precursors (choline and l-carnitine), were associated with improvements in adiposity and regional fat deposition.This study included 510 overweight and obese individuals who were randomly assigned one of four diets varying in macronutrient intake. We examined associations of 6-month changes in blood metabolites (TMAO, choline, and l-carnitine) with improvements in body weight (BW), waist circumference (WC), body fat composition, fat distribution, and resting energy expenditure (REE).Individuals with a greater reduction of choline ( < 0.0001) and l-carnitine ( < 0.01) rather than TMAO showed significant losses of BW and WC at 6 months. The reduction of choline was significantly predictive of decreases in body fat composition, fat distribution, and REE. Results of sensitivity analysis showed that the baseline diabetes risk status, such as the presence of hyperglycemia (31% of the total participants) and fasting glucose levels, did not modify the associations. Early changes in choline and l-carnitine were significantly predictive of weight loss over 2 years ( < 0.05 for all). Individuals with increases in choline or l-carnitine were 2.35-times (95% CI 1.38, 4.00) or 1.77-times (1.06, 2.95) more likely to fail to lose weight (-5% or more loss) at 2 years.Overweight and obese individuals who showed decreases in circulating choline or l-carnitine levels achieved greater improvements of adiposity and energy metabolism by eating a low-calorie weight-loss diet, suggesting that such metabolites are predictive of individuals' response to the treatment. Further investigations are necessary to confirm our findings, particularly in a population with prediabetes that is more representative of the U.S. population with obesity.ClinicalTrials.gov .© 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26714432>: Drugs for your bugs.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25550161>Transmission of atherosclerosis susceptibility with gut microbial transplantation.</a></h2><p>Recent studies indicate both clinical and mechanistic links between atherosclerotic heart disease and intestinal microbial metabolism of certain dietary nutrients producing trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). Here we test the hypothesis that gut microbial transplantation can transmit choline diet-induced TMAO production and atherosclerosis susceptibility. First, a strong association was noted between atherosclerotic plaque and plasma TMAO levels in a mouse diversity panel (n = 22 strains, r = 0.38; p = 0.0001). An atherosclerosis-prone and high TMAO-producing strain, C57BL/6J, and an atherosclerosis-resistant and low TMAO-producing strain, NZW/LacJ, were selected as donors for cecal microbial transplantation into apolipoprotein e null mice in which resident intestinal microbes were first suppressed with antibiotics. Trimethylamine (TMA) and TMAO levels were initially higher in recipients on choline diet that received cecal microbes from C57BL/6J inbred mice; however, durability of choline diet-dependent differences in TMA/TMAO levels was not maintained to the end of the study. Mice receiving C57BL/6J cecal microbes demonstrated choline diet-dependent enhancement in atherosclerotic plaque burden as compared with recipients of NZW/LacJ microbes. Microbial DNA analyses in feces and cecum revealed transplantation of donor microbial community features into recipients with differences in taxa proportions between donor strains that were transmissible to recipients and that tended to show coincident proportions with TMAO levels. Proportions of specific taxa were also identified that correlated with plasma TMAO levels in donors and recipients and with atherosclerotic lesion area in recipients. Atherosclerosis susceptibility may be transmitted via transplantation of gut . Gut microbes may thus represent a novel therapeutic target for modulating atherosclerosis susceptibility.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p></html>
