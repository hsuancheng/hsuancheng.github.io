Characterizing such complex exposure and examining associations with health still poses considerable challenges. The present study summarizes the development and application of novel approaches to identifying chemical hazards and their potential impacts on the health of coastal wildlife, using green sea turtles as model species. We used an epidemiological study approach to collect blood and keratinized scute samples from free-ranging turtles foraging in nearshore areas and an offshore control site. These were analyzed using a combination of non-targeted, effect-based and multi-chemical analytical screening approaches to assess internal exposure to a wide range of chemicals. The screening phase identified a suite of elements (essential and non-essential) as priority for further investigation. Many of these elements are not commonly analyzed in marine wildlife, illustrating that comprehensive screening is important where exposure is unknown or uncertain. In particular, cobalt was present at highly elevated concentrations, in the order of those known to elicit acute effects across other vertebrate species. Several trace elements, including cobalt, were correlated with clinical indicators of impaired turtle health. In addition, biomarkers of oxidative stress (e.g.  and lipid peroxidation products) identified in the blood of turtles showed significant correlations with clinical health markers (particularly alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin), as well as with cobalt. To assist interpretation of trace element blood data in the absence of sufficient information on reptile toxicity, we established exposure reference intervals using a healthy control population. In addition, trace element exposure history was investigated by establishing temporal exposure indices using steady-state relationships between blood and scute. Overall, the data provide a strong argument for the notion that trace element exposure is having an impact on the health of coastal sea turtle populations.Copyright © 2018.

This study evaluated the toxicity of chronic exposure to low-level cadmium (Cd) in rats using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to four groups, namely, the control group, low-dose group (0.13 mg/kg·bw), middle-dose group (0.8 mg/kg·bw) and high-dose group (4.89 mg/kg·bw). The rats continuously received CdCl via drinking water for 24 weeks. Serum samples were collected for metabonomics analysis. The data generated from the UPLC-MS was analysed using principal components analysis (PCA) and partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). PLS-DA model with satisfactory explanatory and predictive ability is capable of discriminating the treatment groups from the control group. 2. Finally, the 10 metabolites were identified and showed significant changes in some treatment groups compared with that in the control group (p < 0.0167 or p < 0.003). Exposure to Cd resulted in increased intensities of lysophosphatidic acid (P-16:0e/0:0), glycocholic acid, bicyclo-prostaglandin E2, lithocholyltaurine, sulfolithocholylglycine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine (20:5/0:0) and lysophosphatidylcholine (20:0), as well as decreased intensities of , phosphatidylcholine (18:4/18:0) and 15S-hydroxyeicosatrienoic acid in rat serum. 3. Results suggest that exposure to Cd can cause disturbances in the lipid , amino acid , nervous system, antioxidant defence system, liver and kidney function.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p></html>
