Because these effects are thought to be mediated through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors alpha and gamma (PPARalpha and PPARgamma), we have now examined the possibility that troglitazone may modulate the expression of PPARalpha and PPARgamma. Seven obese hyperinsulinemic subjects were administered 400 mg troglitazone daily for 4 weeks. Fasting blood samples were obtained before and during troglitazone therapy at 1, 2, and 4 weeks. Fasting insulin concentrations fell at week 1 and persisted at lower levels till 4 weeks. PPARgamma expression fell significantly at week 1 and fell further at weeks 2 and 4. In contrast, PPARalpha expression increased significantly at week 2 and further at week 4. 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid, products of linoleic acid peroxidation and agonists of PPARgamma, decreased during troglitazone therapy. We conclude that troglitazone, an agonist for both PPARalpha and PPARgamma, has significant but dramatically opposite effects on PPARalpha and PPARgamma. These effects may be relevant to its insulin sensitizing and anti-inflammatory effects.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28303483>Proliferation and differentiation of adipose tissue in prolonged lean and obese critically ill patients.</a></h2><p>In prolonged non-obese critically ill patients, preservation of adipose tissue is prioritized over that of the skeletal muscle and coincides with increased adipogenesis. However, we recently demonstrated that in obese critically ill mice, this priority was switched. In the obese, the use of abundantly available adipose tissue-derived energy substrates was preferred and counteracted muscle wasting. These observations suggest that different processes are ongoing in adipose tissue of lean vs. overweight/obese critically ill patients.We hypothesize that to preserve adipose tissue mass during critical illness, adipogenesis is increased in prolonged lean critically ill patients, but not in overweight/obese critically ill patients, who enter the ICU with excess adipose tissue. To test this, we studied markers of adipogenesis in subcutaneous and visceral biopsies of matched lean (n = 24) and overweight/obese (n = 24) prolonged critically ill patients. Secondly, to further unravel the underlying mechanism of critical illness-induced adipogenesis, local production of eicosanoid PPARγ agonists was explored, as well as the adipogenic potential of serum from matched lean (n = 20) and overweight/obese (n = 20) critically ill patients.The number of small adipocytes, PPARγ protein, and CEBPB expression were equally upregulated (p ≤ 0.05) in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue biopsies of lean and overweight/obese prolonged critically ill patients. Gene expression of key enzymes involved in eicosanoid production was reduced (COX1, HPGDS, LPGDS, ALOX15, all p ≤ 0.05) or unaltered (COX2, ALOX5) during critical illness, irrespective of . Gene expression of PLA2G2A and ALOX15B was upregulated in lean and overweight/obese patients (p ≤ 0.05), whereas their end products, the PPARγ-activating metabolites 15s-HETE and , were not increased in the adipose tissue. In vitro, serum of lean and overweight/obese prolonged critically ill patients equally stimulated adipocyte proliferation (p ≤ 0.05) and differentiation (lipid accumulation, DLK1, and CEBPB expression, p ≤ 0.05).Contrary to what was hypothesized, adipogenesis increased independently of initial BMI in prolonged critically ill patients. Not the production of local eicosanoid PPARγ agonists but circulating adipogenic factors seem to be involved in critical illness-induced adipogenesis. Importantly, our findings suggest that abundantly available energy substrates from the adipose tissue, rather than excess adipocytes, can play a beneficial role during critical illness.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11232024>The suppressive effect of dietary restriction and weight loss in the obese on the generation of reactive oxygen species by leukocytes, lipid peroxidation, and protein carbonylation.</a></h2><p>Increased reactive oxygen species generation by the leukocytes of the obese may be responsible for increased oxidative injury to lipids and proteins and, hence, atherosclerosis. We have investigated whether reactive oxygen species generation by leukocytes and other indexes of oxidative damage in the body fall with short-term dietary restriction and weight loss. Nine nondiabetic obese subjects (body mass index, 32.5-64.4 kg/m(2)), not taking any antioxidants, were put on a 1000-Cal diet. Fasting blood samples were taken at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks and at 12 weeks after the cessation of dietary restriction. Blood samples were also obtained at 1 and 2 h after administration of 75 g oral glucose at 0 and 4 weeks. Mononuclear cells (MNC) and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) were isolated, and reactive oxygen species generation was measured. Plasma concentrations of thiobarbituric acid-reactive species (TBARS), 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE), 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (), carbonylated proteins, o-tyrosine, and m-tyrosine as indexes of oxidative damage to lipids, proteins and amino acids, respectively, were measured. Antioxidant vitamins were measured as indexes of antioxidant reserves. Plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentrations were also measured. Mean weight loss was 2.4 +/- 0.6 kg at week 1, 2.5 +/- 1.7 kg at week 2, 3.9 +/- 0.8 kg at week 3, and 4.5 +/- 2.8 kg at week 4 (P < 0.05). Reactive oxygen species generation by PMN fell from 236.4 +/- 95.8 to 150.9 +/- 69.0, 125.9 +/- 24.3, 96.0 +/- 39.9, and 103.1 +/- 35.7 mV at weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively (P < 0.001). It increased 3 months after the cessation of dietary restriction to 270.0 +/- 274.3 mV. Reactive oxygen species generation by MNC fell from 187.8 +/- 75.0 to 101.7 +/- 64.5, 86.9 +/- 42.8, 63.8 +/- 14.3, and 75.1 +/- 32.2 mV and increased thereafter to 302.0 +/- 175.5 mV at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 16 weeks, respectively (P < 0.005). Reactive oxygen species generation by PMN and MNC increased in response to glucose; the relative increase was greater at 4 weeks than that at week 0 due to a fall in the basal levels of reactive oxygen species generation. Consistent with the fall in reactive oxygen species generation, there was a reduction in plasma TBARS from 1.68 +/- 0.17 micromol/L at week 0 to 1.47 micromol/L at 4 weeks (P < 0.05). The 13-HODE to linoleic acid ratio fell from a baseline of 100% to 56.4 +/- 36.1% at 4 weeks (P < 0.05), and the  to linoleic acid ratio fell from a baseline of 100% to 60.5 +/- 37.7% at 4 weeks (P < 0.05). Carbonylated proteins fell from 1.39 +/- 0.27 microgram/mg protein at week 0 to 1.17 +/- 0.12 microgram/mg protein at week 4 (P < 0.05); o-tyrosine fell from 0.42 +/- 0.03 mmol/mol phenylalanine at week 0 to 0.36 +/- 0.02 mmol/mol phenylalanine at 4 weeks (P < 0.005), and m-tyrosine fell from 0.45 +/- 0.04 mmol/mol phenylalanine at week 0 to 0.40 +/- 0.03 mmol/mol phenylalanine at 4 weeks (P < 0.05). The basal concentrations of TBARS, , 13-HODE, carbonylated proteins, o-tyrosine, and m-tyrosine in the obese were significantly greater than those in normal subjects. On the other hand, tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentrations did not change during this 4-week period, nor was there any change in antioxidant vitamins. This is the first demonstration of 1) an increase in reactive oxygen species-induced damage in lipids, proteins, and amino acids in the obese compared with normal subjects; and 2) a decrease in reactive oxygen species generation by leukocytes and oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and amino acids after dietary restriction and weight loss in the obese over a short period.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25381799>Switching from singlet-oxygen-mediated oxidation to free-radical-mediated oxidation in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes in model mouse.</a></h2><p>Oxidative stress plays a key role in the development of type 2 diabetes. However, it is still unknown what kind of oxidative stress underlies the development of type 2 diabetes. We investigated hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE) isomers, which have been proposed as a biomarker for evaluating oxidative stress in vivo, during the development of diabetes in Tsumura Suzuki Obese Diabetes (TSOD) mouse, a type 2 diabetes model. It was revealed that glucose tolerance and insulin resistance index HOMA-IR in TSOD mice at 5 weeks of age were approximately normal, namely, the mice were in the prediabetic state, but these levels were significantly exacerbated from 8 weeks of age compared with those in Tsumura Suzuki Non  (TSNO) mice (control). Concomitantly, the plasma levels of free-radical-mediated oxidation products, 9- and 13-(E,E)-HODE and 7β-hydroxycholesterol, in TSOD mice were significantly higher than those in TSNO mice at 8, and 8 and 11 weeks of age, respectively. Interestingly, the plasma levels of 10- and 12-(Z,E)-HODE, which are produced specifically by singlet-oxygen-mediated oxidation, in TSOD mice were higher than those in TSNO mice only at 5 weeks of age, and not at 8, 11, and 13 weeks of age. We demonstrated that singlet-oxygen-mediated oxidation occurred in TSOD mice before development of the diabetic phenotypes, including impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. These results suggest that excessive singlet-oxygen-mediated oxidation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11443197>Nuclear factor-kappaB suppressive and inhibitor-kappaB stimulatory effects of troglitazone in obese patients with type 2 diabetes: evidence of an antiinflammatory action?</a></h2><p>It has been shown recently that troglitazone exerts an anti-inflammatory effect, in vitro, and in experimental animals. To test these properties in humans, we investigated the effect of troglitazone on the proinflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB and its inhibitory protein IkappaB in mononuclear cells (MNC) and plasma soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and C-reactive protein. We also examined the effect of troglitazone on reactive oxygen species generation, p47(phox) subunit expression, 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (), 13-HODE, o-tyrosine, and m-tyrosine in obese patients with type 2 diabetes. Seven obese patients with type 2 diabetes were treated with troglitazone (400 mg/day) for 4 weeks. Blood samples were obtained at weekly intervals. Nuclear factor-kappaB binding activity in MNC nuclear extracts was significantly inhibited after troglitazone treatment at week 1 and continued to be inhibited up to week 4. On the other hand, IkappaB protein levels increased significantly after troglitazone treatment at week 1, and this increase persisted throughout the study. Plasma monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 concentrations did not decrease significantly after troglitazone treatment, although there was a trend toward inhibition. Reactive oxygen species generation by polymorphonuclear cells and MNC, p47(phox) subunit protein quantities, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and C-reactive protein levels decreased significantly after troglitazone intake. 13-HODE/linoleic acid and /linoleic acid ratios also decreased after troglitazone intake. However, o-tyrosine/phenylalanine and m-tyrosine/phenylalanine ratios did not change significantly. These data show that troglitazone has profound antiinflammatory effects in addition to antioxidant effects in obese type 2 diabetics; these effects may be relevant to the recently described beneficial antiatherosclerotic effects of troglitazone at the vascular level.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p></html>
