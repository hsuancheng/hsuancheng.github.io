Rose hips have long been used to treat kidney stones, gastroenteric ailments, hypertension and respiratory problems such as bronchitis, cough and cold.This review is focused on the ethnopharmacological uses of rose hip as well as phytochemical and pharmacological aspects.Ethno-medical uses of rose hip have been recorded in many countries since a long time. Approximately, 129 chemical compounds have been isolated and identified from rose hip. This fruit contains some major active components such as flavonoids, tannins, anthocyanin, phenolic compounds,  oil, organic acids and inorganic compounds. Scientific studies have suggested a wide range of pharmacological activities for rose hip including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-obesity, anti-cancer, hepatoprotective, nephroprotective, cardioprotective, antiaging, anti H. pylori, neuroprotective and antinociceptive activities. In particular, the rose hip powder and extract have been reported to exert therapeutic effects on arthritis.Some of the ethnomedical indications of rose hip, such as nephroprotective and gastroproetctive actions, have been confirmed by preclinical pharmacological studies. Additional investigations on the pharmacological effects of rose hip as well as evidence from randomized controlled trials are essential to assess the therapeutic value of this natural product.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30208301>Trigonelline prevents high cholesterol and high fat diet induced hepatic lipid accumulation and lipo-toxicity in C57BL/6J mice, via restoration of hepatic autophagy.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is often linked with impaired hepatic autophagy. Here, we studied the alterations in hepatocellular autophagy by high cholesterol and high-fat diet (HC-HF) diet in C57BL/6J mice, and by  (PA), in AML-12 and HepG2 cells. Further, we analysed role of Trigonelline (TG), a plant alkaloid, in preventing NAFLD, by modulating autophagy. For this, C57BL/6J mice were fed with Standard Chow (SC) or HC-HF diet, with and without TG for 16 weeks. In-vitro; AML-12 cells and HepG2 cells, were exposed to PA with and without TG, for 24 h. Cellular events related to autophagy, lipogenesis, and lipo-toxicity were studied. The HC-HF diet fed mice showed hepatic autophagy blockade, increased triglycerides and steatosis. PA exposure to AML-12 cells and HepG2 cells induced impaired autophagy, ER stress, resulting in lipotoxicity. TG treatment in HC-HF fed mice, restored hepatic autophagy, and prevented steatosis. TG treated AML-12, and HepG2 cells exposed to PA showed autophagy restoration, and reduced lipotoxicity, however, these effects were diminished in Atg7-/- HepG2 cells, and in the presence of chloroquine. This study shows that HC-HF diet-induced impaired autophagy, and steatosis is prevented by TG, which attributes to its novel mechanism in treating NAFLD.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Nobiletin (Nob) is a polymethoxylated flavonoid derived from citrus fruits that has been reported to exert antioxidant and antitumor effects. However, its protective and regulatory mechanisms in PA‑induced lipotoxicity remain unclear. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effects of Nob in AML‑12 cells against lipotoxicity and examine the underlying mechanism. Western blotting, reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and ELISA assays were performed to investigate the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) small interfering RNA was used to knockdown SIRT1 expression in AML‑12 cells. The results demonstrated that PA effectively activated NLRP3 inflammasome and increased the expression and secretion of interleukin (IL)‑1β and IL‑18. Notably, the PA‑induced inflammasome activation was reversed by Nob, as indicated by the decreased expression levels of NLRP3, Caspase‑1, IL‑1β and IL‑18. Furthermore, Nob treatment with or without PA enhanced the expression of SIRT1 in AML‑12 cells, while knockdown of SIRT1 with SIRT1‑small interfering RNA reversed the anti‑inflammatory effects of Nob. Overall, the results of the present study indicated that Nob alleviated PA‑induced lipotoxicity in AML‑12 cells via the suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in a SIRT1‑dependent manner. These results provide a possible basis of the underlying mechanism and, in turn, the potential application of Nob in the treatment of non‑alcoholic  disease.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30201523>Development of an in vitro model to study hepatitis C virus effects on hepatocellular lipotoxicity and lipid metabolism.</a></h2><p>Hepatic steatosis is common in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Particularly in patients infected with non-genotype 3 HCV, hepatic steatosis is closely related to factors of the metabolic syndrome such as hyperlipidemia. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this "metabolic" steatosis in non-3 genotype HCV infections are not well understood. Here, we aimed to develop an in vitro model to study the effect of genotype 1 HCV infection on hepatic lipotoxicity and lipid metabolism. Cellular lipid accumulation was induced in Huh-7 hepatoma cells transfected with HCV genotype 1b replicon (HCV) by incubation with increasing doses of  (C16:0) or oleic  (C18:1 n-9) complexed to albumin mimicking hyperlipidemic conditions. Mock transfected hepatoma cells (HCV) were used as controls. Incubation with oleic  concentrations as high as 0.5 mM did not induce toxic effects in HCV or HCV cells. In contrast, incubation with  caused dose-dependently cytotoxic effects which were more pronounced in HCV compared to HCV cells. Further analysis with subtoxic  and oleic  concentrations revealed a higher uptake of  acids and intracellular triglyceride accumulation in HCV compared to HCV cells. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) expression, indicative of mitochondrial beta-oxidation, was markedly stimulated by lipid exposure in HCV but not in HCV cells. Furthermore, heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) expression levels increased in FA stimulated cells, and this increase was significantly higher in HCV compared to HCV cells. In contrast, expression of the key enzymes of hepatic de novo lipogenesis   synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD-1) was significantly reduced upon oleate exposure in HCV but not in HCV cells. In summary, our newly developed cell culture model revealed effects of HCV genotype 1b infection on metabolic susceptibility to lipid accumulation and toxicity particularly to saturated lipids. These results may indicate that HCV (genotype 1b) infected individuals with hyperlipidemia may benefit from dietary or pharmacological intervention.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

The saturated   palmitate and the unsaturated   oleate are the main free  acids in adipose tissue and human diet. We asked how these  acids affect cell survival, NAMPT and NAD levels in HepG2 cells and primary human hepatocytes.HepG2 cells were stimulated with palmitate (0.5mM), oleate (1mM) or a combination of both (0.5mM/1mM) as well as nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) (0.5 mM) or the specific NAMPT inhibitor FK866 (10nM). Cell survival was measured by WST-1 assay and Annexin V/propidium iodide staining. NAD levels were determined by NAD/NADH Assay or HPLC. Protein and mRNA levels were analysed by Western blot analyses and qPCR, respectively. NAMPT enzyme activity was measured using radiolabelled C-nicotinamide. Lipids were stained by Oil red O staining.Palmitate significantly reduced cell survival and induced apoptosis at physiological doses. NAMPT activity and NAD levels significantly declined after 48h of palmitate. In addition, NAMPT mRNA expression was enhanced which was associated with increased NAMPT release into the supernatant, while intracellular NAMPT protein levels remained stable. Oleate alone did not influence cell viability and NAMPT activity but ameliorated the negative impact of palmitate on cell survival, NAMPT activity and NAD levels, as well as the increased NAMPT mRNA expression and secretion. NMN was able to normalize intracellular NAD levels but did not ameliorate cell viability after co-stimulation with palmitate. FK866, a specific NAMPT inhibitor did not influence lipid accumulation after oleate-treatment.Palmitate targets NAMPT activity with a consequent cellular depletion of NAD. Oleate protects from palmitate-induced apoptosis and variation of NAMPT and NAD levels. Palmitate-induced cell stress leads to an increase of NAMPT mRNA and accumulation in the supernatant. However, the proapoptotic action of palmitate seems not to be mediated by decreased NAD levels.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30368556>Differential capability of metabolic substrates to promote hepatocellular lipid accumulation.</a></h2><p>Excessive storage of triacylglycerides (TAGs) in lipid droplets within hepatocytes is a hallmark of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD), one of the most widespread metabolic disorders in Western societies. For the purpose of exploring molecular pathways in NAFLD development and testing potential drug candidates, well-characterised experimental models of ectopic TAG storage in hepatocytes are needed.Using an optimised Oil Red O assay, immunoblotting and real-time qRT-PCR, we compared the capability of dietary monosaccharides and  acids to promote lipid accumulation in HepG2 human hepatoma cells.Both high glucose and high fructose resulted in intracellular lipid accumulation after 48 h, and this was further augmented (up to twofold, as compared to basal levels) by co-treatment with the lipogenesis-stimulating hormone insulin and the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), respectively. The  acids  and oleic  were even more effective than these carbohydrates, inducing significantly elevated TAG storage already after 24 h of treatment. Highest (about threefold) increases in lipid accumulation were observed upon treatment with oleic , alone as well as in combinations with  or with high glucose and insulin. Increases in protein levels of a major lipid droplet coat protein, perilipin-2 (PLIN2), mirrored intracellular lipid accumulation following different treatment regimens.Several treatment regimens of excessive fat and sugar supply promoted lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells, albeit with differences in the extent and rapidity of steatogenesis. PLIN2 is a candidate molecular marker of sustained lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29169220>Fermented Soymilk Alleviates Lipid Accumulation by Inhibition of SREBP-1 and Activation of NRF-2 in the Hepatocellular Steatosis Model.</a></h2><p>Ingredients of soy and fermented soy products have been widely utilized as food supplements for health-enhancing properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of fermented soymilk (FSM) and soymilk (SM) on free  -induced lipogenesis in the hepatocellular steatosis model. HepG2 cells were incubated with  (PA) for 24 h to induce lipogenesis and accumulation of intracellular lipid contents. The PA-treated cells were co-incubated with FSM, SM, genistein, and estrogen, respectively. Lipid accumulation in the PA-treated HpG2 cells was significantly decreased by co-incubation with FSM. Treatment of HepG2 cells with PA combined with genistein or estrogen significantly increased the expression of SREBP-1. However, FSM co-incubation significantly attenuated SREBP-1 expression in the PA-treated HepG2 cells; in addition, expression of NRF-2 and phosphorylation of ERK were significantly increased in the PA and FSM co-incubated cells. PA-induced ROS production was significantly reduced by FSM and SM. Our results suggested that the bioactive components of FSM could protect hepatocytes against the lipid accumulation and ROS production induced by free  acids.

The expression levels of genes related to lipid metabolism and proinflammation in  tissue were examined. NLRP3 inflammasome expression in  tissue was detected by the western blot assay. HepG2 cells were pretreated with compound C and/or AICAR for 1 h and then treated with  (PA) for 3 h. The cells were collected, and mRNA levels were determined.There was a significant reduction in body-weight gain and daily food intake in the HFD + compound C group compared with the HFD + vehicle group ( < 0.05). The glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT) showed that compound C alleviated insulin resistance. Histology analysis showed a significant reduction of hepatic steatosis by compound C. Compound C also significantly decreased   synthesis genes, while increased   oxidation genes. Furthermore, compound C significantly reduced the expression of proinflammatory markers and NLRP3 inflammasome ( < 0.05). Compound C enhanced mRNA levels of SOD1, SOD2, catalase, GPx1, and GPx4 and reduced the p-AMPK/AMPK ratio, which were stimulated by  (PA).

Due to its dangerous aftermaths, finding new substances, such as polyphenols and their derivatives, which might reduce  steatosis is the main target of research into NAFLD treatment. Hence, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect(s) of enterolactone (ENL), a metabolite of secoisolariciresinol (SECO), on lipid metabolism together with changes in the expression of   transporters in .The experiments were conducted on HepG2 cells incubated with either ENL and/or  during 16 h exposure. The expression of selected   transport proteins: FATP2, FATP5, CD36, FABPpm, ABCA1, MTP, ACBP and L-FABP, as well as the proteins directly involved in lipogenesis (FAS), oxidation pathway (CPT 1), and lipid metabolism (PPARα, LXR, SREBP1c, pAMPK) was estimated by Western Blot. Intra and extracellular lipid contents were assessed by Gas-Liquid Chromatography. The data was analyzed with two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and results were considered to be statistically significant at  ≤ 0.05.ENL stimulated extracellular efflux of free  acids (FFA) and triacylglicerols (TAG) to the medium, while, it had no influence on FATP-family mediated intracellular   uptake. Moreover, ENL decreased the expression of CPT 1, pAMPK, PPARα, increased SREBP1c and had no effect on LXR, and FAS content.The findings of our study demonstrate that ENL had opposite effect on  steatosis in comparison with other polyphenols what suggests that it may be an inactive metabolite. ENL did not affect significantly the intracellular accumulation of FFA, DAG and TAG, yet it promoted their extracellular efflux. Furthermore, it inhibited ß-oxydation and intracellular lipid metabolism what may contribute to the progression of NAFLD.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30187271>Membranotropic effects of ω-hydroxypalmitic  and Ca on rat  mitochondria and lecithin liposomes.

It was established that in the presence of Ca, HPA induced aggregation of  mitochondria, which was accompanied by the release of cytochrome c from the organelles. It was further demonstrated that the addition of Ca to HPA-containing liposomes induced their aggregation and/or fusion. Ca also caused the release of the fluorescent dye sulforhodamine B from liposomes, indicating their permeabilization. HPA was shown to induce a high-amplitude swelling of Ca-loaded mitochondria, to decrease their membrane potential, to induce the release of Ca from the organelles and to result in the oxidation of the mitochondrial NAD(P)H pool. Those effects of HPA were not blocked by the MPT pore inhibitor CsA, but were suppressed by the mitochondrial calcium uniporter inhibitor ruthenium red. The effects of HPA were also observed when Ca was replaced with Sr (but not with Ba or Mg). A supposition is made that HPA can induce a Ca-dependent aggregation of mitochondria, as well as Cadependent CsA-insensitive permeabilization of the inner mitochondrial membrane - with the subsequent lysis of the organelles.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31467529>Ginsenoside Rg1 Ameliorates -Induced Hepatic Steatosis and Inflammation in HepG2 Cells via the AMPK/NF-B Pathway.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is one of the common diseases in the world, and it can progress from simple lipid accumulation to sustained inflammation. The present study was designed to investigate the effects and underlying mechanisms of ginsenoside Rg1 (G-Rg1) treatment on NAFLD . HepG2 cells were treated with  (PA) to induce steatosis and inflammation and then successively incubated with G-Rg1. Lipids accumulation was analyzed by Oil Red O staining and intracellular triglyceride (TG) quantification. Inflammatory conditions were examined by quantifying the levels of cell supernatant alanine transaminase/aspartate aminotransferase (ALT/AST) and secretory proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, and TNF- in the cell supernatants. Quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting were used to measure the expressions of genes and proteins associated with lipogenic synthesis and inflammation, including AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) pathways. HepG2 cells were pretreated with an AMPK inhibitor; then, Oil Red O staining and TG quantification were performed to study the lipid deposition. Phospho-AMPK (Thr172) (p-AMPK) and phospho-acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Ser79) (p-ACC) were quantified by immunoblotting. Immunofluorescence was performed to demonstrate the nuclear translocation of NF-B P65. The present study showed that PA markedly increased the intracellular lipid droplets accumulation and TG levels, but decreased AMPK phosphorylation and the expressions of its downstream lipogenic genes. However, G-Rg1 alleviated hepatic steatosis and reduced the intracellular TG content; these changes were accompanied by the activation of the AMPK pathway. In addition, blocking AMPK by using the AMPK inhibitor markedly abolished the G-Rg1-mediated protection against PA-induced lipid deposition in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, G-Rg1 reduced the ALT/AST levels and proinflammatory cytokines release, which were all enhanced by PA. These effects were correlated with the inactivation of the NF-B pathway and translocation of P65 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Overall, these results suggest that G-Rg1 effectively ameliorates hepatic steatosis and inflammation, which might be associated with the AMPK/NF-B pathway.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907226>Dual roles of ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1) in cytoprotection against lipotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Saturated   (SFA)-induced lipotoxicity is caused by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is associated with damaged mitochondria. Moreover, lipotoxicity is crucial for the progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Autophagy is required for the clearance of protein aggregates or damaged mitochondria to maintain cellular metabolic homeostasis. The NFE2L2/NRF2 (nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2)-KEAP1 (kelch like ECH associated protein 1) pathway is essential for the elimination of ROS. ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1; yeast Atg1) is involved in the initiation of autophagy; however, its role in lipotoxicity-induced cell death in hepatocytes and mouse  has not been elucidated. We now show that ULK1 potentiates the interaction between KEAP1 and the autophagy adaptor protein SQSTM1/p62, thereby mediating NFE2L2 activation in a manner requiring SQSTM1-dependent autophagic KEAP1 degradation. Furthermore, ULK1 is required for the autophagic removal of damaged mitochondria and to enhance binding between SQSTM1 and PINK1 (PTEN induced kinase 1). This study demonstrates the molecular mechanisms underlying the cytoprotective role of ULK1 against lipotoxicity. Thus, ULK1 could represent a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of NASH.

However, the source of ROS and mechanisms underlying the development of NAFLD have yet to be established. We observed a significant up-regulation of a minor isoform of NADPH oxidase, NOX1, in the  of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) patients as well as of mice fed a high-fat and high-cholesterol (HFC) diet for 8 weeks. In mice deficient in Nox1 (Nox1KO), increased levels of serum alanine aminotransferase and hepatic cleaved caspase-3 demonstrated in HFC diet-fed wild-type mice (WT) were significantly attenuated. Concomitantly, increased protein nitrotyrosine adducts, a marker of peroxynitrite-induced injury detected in hepatic sinusoids of WT, were significantly suppressed in Nox1KO. The expression of NOX1 mRNA was much higher in the fractions of enriched  sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) than in those of hepatocytes. In primary cultured LSECs,  (PA) up-regulated the mRNA level of NOX1, but not of NOX2 or NOX4. The production of nitric oxide by LSECs was significantly attenuated by PA-treatment in WT but not in Nox1KO. When the in vitro relaxation of TWNT1, a cell line that originated from hepatic stellate cells, was assessed by the gel contraction assay, the relaxation of stellate cells induced by LSECs was attenuated by PA treatment. In contrast, the relaxation effect of LSECs was preserved in cells isolated from Nox1KO. Taken together, the up-regulation of NOX1 in LSECs may elicit peroxynitrite-mediated cellular injury and impaired hepatic microcirculation through the reduced bioavailability of nitric oxide. ROS derived from NOX1 may therefore constitute a critical component in the progression of NAFLD.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In the strive for the best kinetic parameters of biological organisms without a possibility of modifying physicochemical and biochemical reactions in the mitochondrial matrix, the mitochondria can be provided with a substrate that increases energy production efficiency and the amount of ATP. Physicochemical parameters of oleic MFA has become the standard of an oxidation substrate for in vivo energy production; this MFA was synthesized in organisms for millions of years. Environmental influences are the second factor which determines kinetic perfection of biological organisms during phylogenesis. Are these influences always beneficial? Mostly, they are not. However, they largely stimulate adaptive functions of the organism, including the biological function of locomotion, cognitive function and the function of positioning in the environment. Biological, energy and kinetic perfection formed in vivo can be easily destroyed if phylogenetically herbivorous Homo sapiens abuses the diet of carnivorous animals (meat) which was not consumed by him and his ancestors during phylogenesis.

However, the role of HSP70 in NAFLD has not been investigated. Here, we investigated the possible role of HSP70 in lipid synthesis.C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet, and HepG2 cells were treated with 0.5 mM  (PA). HSP70 expression was detected by qPCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). After Hsp70 overexpression and knockdown, TC and TG levels and FAS, SCD, and ACC expression were detected.HSP70 expression was significantly increased in the livers of obese mice. In vitro, HSP70 expression was markedly induced by PA in HepG2 cells. Notably, HSP70 overexpression in HepG2 cells enhanced TC and TG synthesis, in parallel with the upregulation of lipogenic genes, including FAS, SCD and ACC.

The hepatocytes were treated with NR (10 µM and 10 mM) for 24 h with and without PA. The cell viability and the levels of sirtuins, inflammatory markers, and mitochondrial markers were analyzed.Cytotoxicity of NR was examined by PrestoBlue assay. Exposure to NR had no effect on cell viability or morphology. Gene expression of sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) and Sirt3 was significantly upregulated by NR in PA-treated hepatocytes. However, Sirt1 activities were increased in hepatocytes treated with low-dose NR. Hepatic pro-inflammatory markers including tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 were decreased in NR-treated cells. NR upregulated anti-inflammatory molecule adiponectin, and, tended to down-regulate hepatokine fetuin-A in PA-treated hepatocytes, suggesting its inverse regulation on these cytokines.

Chaperon-mediated autophagy (CMA) triggers lipid droplets (LDs) breakdown, to initiate lipolysis via either cytosolic lipases or macroautophagy. SIRT3, a mitochondrial NAD-dependent deacetylase, regulates the acetylation status and activity of many substrates involving in energy metabolism. However, the role of SIRT3 in regulating lipophagy is controversial. The current study showed that SIRT3 expression was decreased and the macroautophagy flux was blocked in the primary hepatocytes from high-fat diet fed mice and P/O ( and oleic  mixture) treated AML12 mouse hepatocytes, compared with the corresponding controls. SIRT3 overexpression promoted macroautophagy in LDs from P/O-treated hepatocytes through activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and unc-51-like kinase 1, to boost LDs digestion. Gain of SIRT3 expression stimulated the formation of lysosome-associated membrane protein 2A (LAMP-2A)-heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein (HSC70)-perilipin-2 (PLN2) complex, to promote CMA process and reduce the stability of LDs in hepatocytes. Moreover, SIRT3 reduced the expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, to suppress lipogenesis. In addition, SIRT3 overexpression promoted LDs dispersion on detyrosinated microtubules, and directly deacetylated long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase to enhance mitochondrial energetics.

Oil red O staining and triglyceride assays were used to assess lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) and the   β-oxidation-related genes. Direct interactions were validated by dual-luciferase reporter gene assays. MiR-181a expression was significantly upregulated in the serum of NAFLD patients and PA-induced hepatocytes. Inhibition of miR-181a expression resulted in the increased expression of PPARα and its downstream genes, and PA-induced lipid accumulation in hepatocytes was also inhibited. Upregulation of miR-181a resulted in the downregulation of its direct target PPARα and downstream gene expression of PPARα as well as aggravated lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. At the same time, the increased expression of PPARα can offset lipid accumulation in hepatocytes induced by miR-181a mimics. This study demonstrates that reducing the expression of miR-181a may improve lipid metabolism in NAFLD.

We observed an increased rate of apoptosis in Sertoli cells, accompanied with elevated FFA levels, in the testes of obese mice that were provided a high-fat diet (HFD). Moreover, the levels of reactive oxygen species were elevated. Furthermore, we demonstrated by in vitro assays that saturated  (PA), which is the most common saturated FFA in plasma, led to decreased cell viability of TM4 Sertoli cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. A similar finding was noted in primary mouse Sertoli cells. In contrast to saturated FFA, omega-3 (ω-3) polyunsaturated  acids (PUFAs) protected Sertoli cells from PA-induced lipotoxicity at the physiologically relevant levels.

It has been well established that the chronic sterile inflammation caused by the NLRP3 inflammasome is closely related to NAFLD development. Kupffer cells (KCs) are involved in the pathogenesis of various  diseases. We used methionine choline-deficient diets to establish a mouse nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) model. The expression and formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the KCs from the mouse and cell models were determined by Western blotting and co-immunoprecipitation. Evidence of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) release was determined by live cell labeling and imaging. KCs and the NLRP3 inflammasome exerted proinflammatory effects on the development and progression of NASH through secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β. NLRP3, ASC and Caspase-1 protein expression levels in KCs from NASH mouse livers were significantly higher than those in KCs from NLRP3 mice, and the number of NLRP3 inflammasome protein complexes was significantly higher in KCs from NASH mouse livers, whereas these protein complexes could not be formed in NLRP3 mice. In in vitro experiments,  (PA) decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential and subsequently induced mtDNA release from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm. NLRP3 inflammasome expression was substantially increased, and mtDNA-NLRP3 inflammasome complexes formed upon PA stimulation. Our data suggest that mtDNA released from mitochondria during PA stimulation causes NLRP3 inflammasome activation, providing a missing link between NLRP3 inflammasome activation and NASH development, via binding of cytosolic mtDNA to the NLRP3 inflammasome.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We explored the significance of CXCR3 in regulating mitochondrial function during NASH development in animal models and cultured hepatocytes.The effects of CXCR3 on mitochondrial function were evaluated by genetic knockout or pharmacological inhibition in mouse models and . The ultrastructural changes of mitochondria were assessed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Hepatic levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage, membrane potential and ATP were examined.CXCR3 ablation by genetic knockout or pharmacological inhibition in mice protected against NASH development by influencing mitochondrial function. Similarly, depletion of CXCR3 reduced steatohepatitis injury in cultured hepatocytes. TEM analysis revealed that  mitochondrial integrity was much improved in CXCR3 knockout (CXCR3) compared to wildtype (WT) mice. In agreement with this, impaired mitochondrial function was pronounced in WT mice compared to CXCR3 mice, evidenced by increased protein expression of dynamic-related protein-1 (DRP1) and fission-1 (FIS1) and decreased protein expression of mitofusin-1 (MFN1).

However, the contribution and regulatory mechanisms of Parkin-related mitophagy in NAFLD are incompletely understood. Macrophage stimulating 1 (Mst1) is a novel mitophagy upstream regulator which excerbates heart and cancer apoptosisn via repressing mitophagy activity. The aim of our study is to explore whether Mst1 contributes to NAFLD via disrupting Parkin-related mitophagy. A NAFLD model was generated in wild-type (WT) mice and Mst1 knockout (Mst1-KO) mice using high-fat diet (HFD). Cell experiments were conducted via  (PA) treatment in the primary hepatocytes. The results in our study demonstrated that Mst1 was significantly upregulated in HFD-treated livers. Genetic ablation of Mst1 attenuated HFD-mediated hepatic injury and sustained hepatocyte viability. Functional studies illustrated that Mst1 knockdown reversed Parkin-related mitophagy and the latter protected mitochondria and hepatocytes against HFD challenge. Besides, we further figured out that Mst1 modulated Parkin expression via the AMPK pathway; blockade of AMPK repressed Parkin-related mitophagy and recalled hepatocytes mitochondrial apoptosis.

However, it is unknown if 5-PAHSA affects glucose and lipid metabolism in db/db mice, which are characterized by extreme hyperglycemia. Here, we aim to determine the effect of continued 5-PAHSA administration on glucose and lipid metabolism in db/db mice. We also used 3T3-L1 cells and HepG2 cells to investigate the mechanism behind this effect. HepG2 cells and 3T3-L1 cells were induced to become models of insulin resistance. The models were used to test the effect of 5-PAHSA on insulin signaling. 5-PAHSA was administered orally to db/db mice for 1 month to assess its effects on glucose and lipid metabolism. We also exposed HepG2 cells to high glucose concentrations to investigate the influence on 5-PAHSA's effects on hepatic lipid metabolism and inflammation. 5-PAHSA improved glucose uptake and insulin signaling in HepG2 cells and 3T3-L1 cells. However, after 1 month of treatment, 5-PAHSA did not reduce blood glucose levels, but increased inflammation and promoted  in db/db mice. In HepG2 cells under normal glucose conditions, 5-PAHSA treatment reduced lipogenesis and increased lipid oxidation. Notably, a high glucose concentration in cell media abolished the positive effects of 5-PAHSA treatment. These changes were associated with: decreased phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC); upregulation of sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c), and   synthase (FAS); and downregulation of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1).

Lipid accumulation in hepatocytes are implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic  injury. CD36 is known to mediate long-chain   (LCFA) uptake and lipid metabolism. However, it is unclear whether LCFA directly promotes hepatocyte activation and the involved mechanisms have not been fully clarified.Mice were fed with a high fat diet (HFD) and normal hepatocyte cells (Chang  cells) were treated with  (PA) in vivo and in vitro. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting were used to examine the gene and protein expression of molecules involved in hepatic fibrogenesis and hepatocyte activation. CD36 was knocked down by transfecting CD36 siRNA into hepatocyte cells. Hydrogen peroxide (HO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were detected using commercial kits.HFD induced a profibrogenic response and up-regulated CD36 expression in vivo. Analogously, PA increased lipid accumulation and induced human hepatocyte activation in vitro, which was also accompanied by increased CD36 expression. Interestingly, knockdown of CD36 resulted in a reduction of hepatocyte lipid deposition and decreased expression of Acta2 (34% decrease), Vimentin (29% decrease), Desmin (60% decrease), and TGF-β signaling pathway related genes. In addition, HFD and PA increased the production of HO in vivo (48% increase) and in vitro (385% increase), and the antioxidant, NAC, ameliorated PA-induced hepatocyte activation. Furthermore, silencing of CD36 in vitro markedly attenuated PA-induced oxidative stress (HO: 41% decrease; ROS: 39% decrease), and the anti-activation effects of CD36 knockdown could be abolished by pretreatment with HO.Our study demonstrated that LCFA facilitates hepatocyte activation by up-regulating oxidative stress through CD36, which could be an important mechanism in the development of hepatic fibrosis.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30100495>Adaptations of hepatic lipid metabolism and mitochondria in dairy cows with mild .</a></h2><p>The inevitable deficiency in nutrients and energy at the onset of lactation requires an optimal adaptation of the hepatic metabolism to overcome metabolic stress.  is one of the main health disorders after parturition. Therefore, to investigate changes in hepatic lipid metabolic status and mitochondria in dairy cows with mild ,  and blood samples were collected from healthy cows (n = 15) and cows with mild  (n = 15). To determine the effects of  acids (PA), one of the major component of  acids, on lipid metabolism and mitochondria in vitro, calf hepatocytes were isolated from healthy calves and treated with various concentrations of PA (0, 50, 100, and 200 μM). Dairy cows with mild  displayed hepatic lipid accumulation. The protein levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) and mRNA levels of acetyl CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1),   synthase (FAS), acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) were significantly higher in dairy cows with mild  than in control cows. The hepatic mitochondrial DNA content, mRNA levels of oxidative phosphorylation complexes I to V (CO 1-V), protein levels of cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COX IV), voltage dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) and nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content were all markedly increased in the  of dairy cows with mild  compared with healthy cows. The PA treatment significantly increased lipid accumulation; protein levels of SREBP-1c and PPARα; and mRNA levels of ACC1, FAS, ACO, and CPT1A in calf hepatocytes. Moreover, the mitochondrial DNA content, mRNA levels of CO 1-V, protein levels of COX IV, VDAC1, PGC-1α, NRF1, mitochondrial transcription factor A, and ATP content were significantly increased in PA-treated hepatocytes compared with control hepatocytes. The protein level of mitofusin-2 was significantly decreased in PA-treated groups. In conclusion, lipid synthesis and oxidation, number of mitochondria, and ATP production were increased in the  of dairy cows with mild  and PA-treated calf hepatocytes.

Previous studies indicated that hepatic microRNAs (miRs) play critical roles in the development of NAFLD. In this study, we aim to explore the pathophysiological role of miR-194 in obesity-mediated metabolic dysfunction. Our findings show that the high fat diet or  treatment significantly increase hepatic miR-194 levels in vivo and in vitro. Silence of miR-194 protects -induced inflammatory response in cultured hepatocytes, and attenuates structural disorders, lipid deposits and inflammatory response in . MiR-194 inhibitor also improves glucose and insulin intolerance in obese mice. Through dual luciferase assay, we demonstrate that miR-194 directly binds to FXR/Nr1h4 3'-UTR, and inhibits gene expression of FXR/Nr1h4. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-194 downregulates FXR/Nr1h4 in cultured hepatocytes, but miR-194 inhibitor reversely increases FXR/Nr1h4 expression in obese mouse  tissues. On the contrast, silence of FXR/Nr1h4 abolishes the hepatic benefits in obese mice treated with miR-194 inhibitor. Present study provides a novel finding that suppression of miR-194 attenuates dietary-induced NAFLD via upregulation of FXR/Nr1h4. The findings suggest miR-194/FXR are potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for NAFLD.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Our previous studies suggested that resveratrol (RSV) supplement could improve hepatic steatosis, but the underlying mechanism, particularly which related to LD accumulation, has not yet been elucidated.A high-fat diet (HFD) and  were used to induce hepatic steatosis in mouse  and hepatocytes, respectively. The effects of RSV on LD accumulation were analyzed in vivo and in vitro. The effects of RSV on the expression levels of LD-associated genes (ATF6, Fsp27β/CIDEC, CREBH, and PLIN1) were measured by qRT-PCR and western blot assays, followed by KD or overexpression of SIRT1 and ATF6 with small interfering RNAs or overexpressed plasmids, respectively. The dual luciferase reporter assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, coimmunoprecipitation, and proximity ligation assay were utilized to clarify the mechanism of transcriptional regulation and possible interaction between SIRT1 and ATF6.There was a significant increase in the accumulation of LDs in  and hepatocytes during the process of HFD-induced steatosis, respectively, which was significantly inhibited by RSV supplementation. RSV notably activated SIRT1 expression and decreased the expression levels of ATF6, Fsp27β/CIDEC, CREBH, and PLIN1, which are associated with LD accumulation. Interestingly, the inhibitory effects of RSV on LD accumulation and the associated expression of genes in hepatocytes were abrogated or strengthened with SIRT1 silencing or overexpression, respectively. On the contrary, the benefits of RSV in hepatocytes were eliminated or aggravated when transfected with the overexpressed ATF6 or ATF6 siRNA, respectively. Furthermore, we found that RSV stimulated SIRT1 expression significantly, which was followed by increased deacetylation and inactivation of ATF6, resulting in a positive feedback loop for SIRT1 transcription associated with ATF6 binding to the SIRT1 promoter region.Taken together, these findings indicate that RSV supplementation improves hepatic steatosis by ameliorating the accumulation of LDs, and this might be partially mediated by a SIRT1/ATF6-dependent mechanism.© 2018 The Author(s).

However, the role and molecular mechanism of IGFBP-7 in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains largely unknown. Therefore, the potential function of IGFBP7 in the pathological progression of NAFLD was explored in this investigation. For in vivo experiments, an animal model of NAFLD was established in C57BL/6 mice by feeding a high-fat diet (HFD), and IGFBP7 was knocked down by injecting adeno-associated adenovirus (AAV)-mediated short-hairpin (sh)-IGFBP7 into the liver. We found that AAV-sh-IGFBP7 treatment significantly alleviated hepatocyte injury and inhibited hepatic lipid accumulation by reducing lipogenesis-associated gene expression. Furthermore, downregulation of IGFBP7 markedly ameliorated IR and restored impaired insulin signalling by elevating the phosphorylation levels of IRS-1, Akt and GSK3β in HFD-treated mice. Similar results were also confirmed by an in vitro study in a  (PA)-stimulated HepG2 cell model. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that IGFBP7 contributes to hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in NAFLD development, which might serve as a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of NAFLD.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29655752>Systematic evaluation of phenolic compounds and protective capacity of a new mulberry cultivar J33 against -induced lipotoxicity using a simulated digestion method.</a></h2><p>This research aimed to investigate the protective effects of a new mulberry cultivar J33 with simulated gastrointestinal digestion against  (PA)-induced lipotoxicity. LC-MS analysis revealed that the contents of four flavonoid glycosides (quercetin rhamnosylhexoside hexoside, quercetin rhamnosylhexoside, quercetin hexoside, kaempferol rhamnosylhexoside) increased after digestion. Besides, mulberry digest (MBD) at 0.5-2 mg/mL significantly reduced PA-induced lipotoxicity in human hepatocytes, while mulberry extract without digestion (MBE) showed no protection. Further investigations demonstrated that the protection of MBD was attributed to two aspects. On the one hand, MBD could attenuate PA-induced oxidative stress by suppressing ROS accumulation, regulating intracellular glutathione and ameliorating mitochondrial dysfunction. On the other hand, MBD could promote PA incorporation into inert triglycerides (TG) to deal with the acute lipid overload, reducing the lipotoxicity caused by PA.

The present study explored the role of PKCδ in NAFLD development and investigated the relationships between PKCδ, calcium homeostasis, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (ERS). Hepatic steatosis cell model was induced by  (PA) in L02 cells. Lipid accretion was evaluated using Oil Red O staining and a triglyceride (TG) detection kit. PKCδ was down-regulated by siRNA. RT-PCR and Western blotting were used to detect the expression of ERS markers. The fluorescence of Ca influx was recorded using confocal microscopy. Sarco-ER Ca-ATPase (SERCA) activity was measured by ultramicro-ATP enzyme test kit. PA treatment induced lipid accretion in L02 cells, destroyed the ER structure, and increased PKCδ activation in a time-dependent manner. Further, PA treatment significantly increased the expression of ERS markers, Ig heavy chain binding protein (Bip), and homologous proteins of CCAAT-enhancer binding proteins (CHOP). PKCδ silencing down-regulated Bip and CHOP expression, indicating a successful alleviation of ERS. The increased calcium storage induced by PA stimulation was significantly decreased in L02 cells treated with PKCδ siRNA compared with the negative control. Moreover, diminished SERCA activity caused by PA was recovered in PKCδ siRNA transfected cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that the inhibition of PKCδ alleviates ERS by enhancing SERCA activity and stabilizing calcium homeostasis.© 2017 The Author(s).</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29982798>The Hepatotoxicity of  in Zebrafish Involves the Intestinal Microbiota.</a></h2><p> (PA) is the main saturated   naturally occurring in animal fats and vegetable oils.

Natural compounds present in bergamot polyphenol fraction (BPF) prevent NAFLD and induce autophagy in rat livers. Here, we employed HepG2 cells expressing DsRed-LC3-GFP, a highly sensitive model system to screen for proautophagic compounds present in BPF. BPF induced autophagy in a time- and dose-dependent fashion and the effect was amplified in cells loaded with . Autophagy was mediated by the hydrophobic fraction of -hydrolyzed BPF (A-BPF), containing six flavanone and flavone aglycones as identified by liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry. Among them, naringenin, hesperitin, eriodictyol and diosmetin were weak inducers of autophagy. Apigenin showed the strongest and dose-dependent proautophagic activity at early time points (6 h). Luteolin induced a biphasic autophagic response, strong at low doses and inhibitory at higher doses. Both flavones were toxic in HepG2 cells and in differentiated human  progenitors HepaRG upon longer treatments (24 h). In contrast, BPF and A-BPF did not show any toxicity, but induced a persistent increase in autophagic flux. A mixture of six synthetic aglycones mimicking A-BPF was sufficient to induce a similar autophagic response, but it was mildly cytotoxic. Thus, while six main BPF flavonoids fully account for its proautophagic activity, their combined effect is not sufficient to abrogate cytotoxicity of individual compounds. This suggests that a natural polyphenol phytocomplex, such as BPF, is a safer and more effective strategy for the treatment of NAFLD than the use of pure flavonoids.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of resveratrol on steatosis and oxidative stress in HepG2 cells. The steatosis of cells was carried out using free  acids: oleic or  and their mixtures. Steatosis was visualized using the intracellular lipid staining by Nile Red dye with a fluorescence microscope. This study also determined the viability of cells and mitochondrial membrane potential. The current study showed that  acids and their mixtures induced fat overloading in HepG2 cells.

In case of cells incubated with  (PA) and the mixtures of  acids, micro- and macro-vacuolar steatosis occurred in most of the cells. Resveratrol decreased steatosis in HepG2 cells induced by OA, PA, as well as their mixtures, and in most of experimental groups did not reduce cells viability.

The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat-containing receptor-containing pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and pyroptosis play crucial roles in the progression of NASH. Our team has provided clinical evidence of the effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) on the improvement in  function and histological resolution of NAFLD. Preliminary work has demonstrated that GLP-1 inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation in a mouse model of NAFLD. We further explored the potential molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory effect of liraglutide, a long-acting GLP-1 analog, in the treatment of NASH. We established a HepG2 cell model of NASH using double stimulation with  and lipopolysaccharide to assess NLRP3 inflammasome and pyroptotic cell activity and to evaluate mitochondrial function and mitophagy. Liraglutide reduced lipid accumulation, inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome and pyroptosis activation, attenuated mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species generation, augmented mitophagy in hepatocytes. Mitophagy inhibition with 3-methyladenine/PINK1-directed siRNA weakened the liraglutide-mediated suppression of inflammatory injury. We propose that liraglutide suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome-induced hepatocyte pyroptosis via mitophagy to slow the progression of NASH.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Previous studies have suggested that hepatocyte nuclear factor 1b (HNF1b) ameliorates insulin resistance. However, the role of HNF1b in the regulation of lipid metabolism and hepatic steatosis remains poorly understood. We found that HNF1b expression was decreased in steatotic livers. We injected mice with lentivirus (LV) expressing HNF1b shRNA to generate mice with hepatic knockdown of HNF1b. We also injected high fat (HF) diet-induced obese and db/db diabetic mice with LV expressing HNF1b to overexpress HNF1b. Knockdown of HNF1b increased hepatic lipid contents and induced insulin resistance in mice and in hepatocytes. Knockdown of HNF1b worsened HF diet-induced increases in hepatic lipid contents,  injury and insulin resistance in mice and PA-induced lipid accumulation and impaired insulin signaling in hepatocytes. Moreover, overexpression of HNF1b alleviated HF diet-induced increases in hepatic lipid content and insulin resistance in mice. Knockdown of HNF1b increased expression of genes associated with lipogenensis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. DPP4 and NOX1 expression was increased by knockdown of HNF1b and HNF1b directly bound with the promoters of DPP4 and NOX1. Overexpression of DPP4 or NOX1 was associated with an increase in lipid droplets in hepatocytes and decreased expression of DPP4 or NOX1 suppressed the effects of knockdown of HNF1b knockdown on triglyceride (TG) formation and insulin signaling. Knockdown of HNF1b increased superoxide level and decreased glutathione content, which was inhibited by downregulation of DPP4 and NOX1. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) suppressed HNF1b knockdown-induced ER stress, TG formation and insulin resistance.  (PA) decreased HNF1b expression which was inhibited by NAC. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that HNF1b plays an essential role in controlling hepatic TG homeostasis and insulin sensitivity by regulating DPP4/NOX1mediated generation of superoxide.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The treated mice were divided into three groups: the control group (n = 10), the low-dose CQJD treatment group (n = 10) and the high-dose CQJD treatment group (n = 10). The hepatic injury, inflammation, and apoptotic molecules were evaluated by H&E staining, immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR. Kupffer cells were isolated from control mice and CQJD-treated mice after stimulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and/or . The level of the inflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL1β, and CCL2 was measured by ELISA.The HFD-fed mice displayed significant metabolic, inflammatory, and oxidative stress-related alterations due to hepatic lipid accumulation. CQJD treatment largely normalized the hepatic injury, lowered the ALT/AST level, and reduced the severity of  inflammation, as revealed by the decreased inflammatory cytokines levels. In vitro, CQJD blocked the activation of LPS- or -primed Kupffer cells in a dose-dependent manner. In the MCD diet-induced NASH mice, similar therapeutic effects of CQJD were also observed.CQJD ameliorates mouse nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.

It has been confirmed that statured  (PA) (the most abundant FFA) could bind MD2 to cause cellular inflammation. The natural compound celastrol could improve obesity, which is suggested via inhibiting inflammation, yet the detailed mechanism for celastrol is still unclear. As celastrol is reported to directly target MD2, we thought disrupting the binding between FFAs and MD2 might be one of the ways for celastrol to inhibit FFAs-caused inflammation and insulin resistance. In this study, we found evidence to support our hypothesis: celastrol could reverse PA-caused TLR4/MD2 activation-dependent insulin resistance, as determined by glucose-lowering ability, cellular glucose uptake, insulin action-related proteins and TLR4/MD2/NF-κB activation. Bioinformatics and cellular experiments showed that both celastrol and PA could bind MD2, and that celastrol could expel PA from cells. Finally, celastrol could reverse high fat diet caused hyperglycemia and obesity, and  NF-kB activations.

The putative actions of reduced insulin sensitivity and responsiveness and enhanced adipose tissue lipolysis spare glucose for the mammary synthesis of milk. However, severe insulin antagonism and body fat mobilization may jeopardize hepatic health and lactation in dairy cattle. Interestingly, lipolysis- and dietary-derived  acids may impair insulin sensitivity in cows. The mechanisms are undefined yet have major implications for the development of postpartum  disease. In nonruminants, the sphingolipid ceramide is a potent mediator of saturated fat-induced insulin resistance that defines in part the mechanisms of type 2 diabetes mellitus and nonalcoholic  disease. In ruminants including the lactating dairy cow, the functions of ceramide had remained virtually undescribed. Through a series of hypothesis-centered studies, ceramide has emerged as a potential antagonist of insulin-stimulated glucose utilization by adipose and skeletal muscle tissues in dairy cattle. Importantly, bovine data suggest that the ability of ceramide to inhibit insulin action likely depends on the lipolysis-dependent hepatic synthesis and secretion of ceramide during early lactation. Although these mechanisms appear to fade as lactation advances beyond peak milk production, early evidence suggests that  feeding is a means to augment ceramide supply. Herein, we review a body of work that focuses on sphingolipid biology and the role of ceramide in the dairy cow within the framework of hepatic and   metabolism, insulin function, and lactation. The potential involvement of ceramide within the endocrine control of lactation is also considered.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The expression of these genes and the transcriptional responses to a high-fat diet and  acids (FAs) ( (PA) and oleic  (OA)) were investigated. The mRNAs of these genes could be detected in heart, , muscle, spleen, brain, mesenteric adipose tissue, intestine, kidney and ovary, but varied with the tissues. In the , the mRNA levels of the nine autolysosome-related genes were lower in fish fed a high-fat diet than those fed the control, indicating that a high-fat diet inhibited formation of autolysosomes.  (a saturated FA) significantly inhibited the formation of autolysosomes at 12 h, 24 h and 48 h incubation. In contrast, oleic  (an unsaturated FA) significantly induced the formation of autolysosomes at 12 h, but inhibited them at 24 h. At 48 h, the effects of OA incubation on autolysosomes were OA concentration-dependent in primary hepatocytes of P. fulvidraco. The results of flow cytometry and laser confocal observations confirmed these results. PA and OA incubation also increased intracellular non-esterified   (NEFA) concentration at 12 h, 24 h and 48 h, and influenced mRNA levels of   binding protein () and   transport protein 4 () which facilitate FA transport in primary hepatocytes of P. fulvidraco. The present study demonstrated the molecular characterization of the nine autolysosome-related genes and their transcriptional responses to fat and FAs in fish, which provides the basis for further exploring their regulatory mechanism in vertebrates.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30781729>Palmitate and Stearate are Increased in the Plasma in a 6-OHDA Model of Parkinson's Disease.</a></h2><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, without any widely available curative therapy.

The first principal component derived by principal component analysis of 27 individual  acids (mole percentage) was the main exposure (subsequently called the   pattern score [FA-pattern score]). The FA-pattern score was partly characterised by high concentrations of linoleic , stearic , odd-chain  acids, and very-long-chain saturated  acids and low concentrations of γ-linolenic , , and long-chain monounsaturated  acids, and it explained 16.1% of the overall variability of the 27  acids. Based on country-specific Prentice-weighted Cox regression and random-effects meta-analysis, the FA-pattern score was associated with lower incident T2D. Comparing the top to the bottom fifth of the score, the hazard ratio of incident T2D was 0.23 (95% CI 0.19-0.29) adjusted for potential confounders and 0.37 (95% CI 0.27-0.50) further adjusted for metabolic risk factors. The association changed little after adjustment for individual  acids or   subclasses. In cross-sectional analyses relating the FA-pattern score to metabolic, genetic, and dietary factors, the FA-pattern score was inversely associated with adiposity, triglycerides,  enzymes, C-reactive protein, a genetic score representing insulin resistance, and dietary intakes of soft drinks and alcohol and was positively associated with high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and intakes of polyunsaturated fat, dietary fibre, and coffee (p < 0.05 each).

In this study, the efficacy of saroglitazar, a novel PPARα/γ agonist, was assessed in models of NAFLD/NASH.HepG2 cells treated with  (PA;0.75 mM) showed decreased expression of various antioxidant biomarkers (SOD1, SOD2, glutathione peroxidase and catalase) and increased expression of inflammatory markers (TNFα, IL1β and IL6). These effects were blocked by saroglitazar, pioglitazone and fenofibrate (all tested at 10μM concentration). Furthermore, these agents reversed PA-mediated changes in mitochondrial dysfunction, ATP production, NFkB phosphorylation and stellate cell activation in HepG2 and HepG2-LX2 Coculture studies. In mice with choline-deficient high-fat diet-induced NASH, saroglitazar reduced hepatic steatosis, inflammation, ballooning and prevented development of fibrosis. It also reduced serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and expression of inflammatory and fibrosis biomarkers. In this model, the reduction in the overall NAFLD activity score by saroglitazar (3 mg/kg) was significantly more prominent than pioglitazone (25 mg/kg) and fenofibrate (100 mg/kg). Pioglitazone and fenofibrate did not show any improvement in steatosis, but partially improved inflammation and  function. Antifibrotic effect of saroglitazar (4 mg/kg) was also observed in carbon tetrachloride-induced fibrosis model.Saroglitazar, a dual PPARα/γ agonist with predominant PPARα activity, shows an overall improvement in NASH.

The Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) to establish NAFLD model in vivo. After strontium treatment, the total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and lipid deposition in L02 cells and  tissues were determined. Strontium treatment suppressed intracellular TC and TG levels and lipid accumulation in L02 cells, and the effect of high concentrations of strontium were more obvious. Strontium significantly reduced the mRNA and protein expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), SREBP cleavage activator protein (SCAP), sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), and SREBP-2 in L02 cells. In HFD-fed rats, strontium treatment reduced serum TC, TG, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, concurrent with a decrease in hepatic lipid accumulation. Furthermore, strontium treatment reduced the expression of GRP78 and SREBP-2 protein in  tissues.

However, the pathogenesis of NAFLD is still unclear. Emerging studies have demonstrated that microRNAs (miRs) are profoundly involved in NAFLD and related metabolic diseases. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which miR-181b influences NAFLD via direct targeting SIRT1. The expression of miR181b was up-regulated while SIRT1 was down-regulated in both human NAFLD patients and high fat diet (HFD) induced NAFDL mice model. And  (PA) treatment increased the miR-181b expression while decreased SIRT1 expression in HepG2 cells. Further, we identified that SIRT1 is a direct downstream target of miR-181b. Ectopic expression of miR-181b significantly repressed the 3'-UTR reporter activities of SIRT1 in a dose-dependent manner, while the effect of miR-181b was interrupted when the binding site of miR-181b within the SIRT1 3'-UTR was mutated. And overexpression of miR-181b reduced both the mRNA and protein levels of SIRT1 in HepG2 cells. We also found that inhibition of miR-181b expression alleviates hepatic steatosis both in vitro and in vivo. And the effect of miR-181b on steatosis was blocked by SIRT1 overexpression.

Excess of meat in the diet leads to high content of    (FA) in hepatocytes and formation of  triglycerides (TG). Post heparin lipoprotein lipase slowly hydrolyzes  TG in blood plasma lipoproteins and releases small amounts of FA. If dietary carbohydrate content is low, the biological function of exotrophy does not provide the substrate from which hepatocytes can rapidly produce oleic nonesterified FA de novo.

In insulin resistance (IR) syndrome, the biological function of feeding is realized nonphysiologically while the biological reaction of adaptation is realized physiologically. An increase in NEFA blood content physiologically blocks glucose uptake in cells.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression level of SIRT3, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial impairments in human hepatoma HepG2 cells exposed to  (PA). Our results showed that PA treatment caused the deposition of lipid droplets and resulted in an increased expression of tumor necrosis factor-α in a dose-dependent manner. Excessive accumulation of PA induces the reactive oxygen species formation and apoptosis while dissipating the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. The level of SIRT3 expression in both nuclear and mitochondrial fractions in HepG2 cells was decreased with the increase in PA concentrations. However, in the cytosolic fraction, the SIRT3 was undetectable. In conclusion, our results showed that PA caused an increase in inflammation and oxidative stress in HepG2 cells.

Biological function of trophology (nutrition) in ontogenesis.]</a></h2><p>According to the phylogenetic theory of general pathology, seven biological functions have been formed over billions of years. 1. biological function of trophology, nutrition; 2. homeostasis function; 3. biological function of endoecology; 4. function of adaptation; 5. function of the continuation of the species; 6. function of locomotion and 7. cognitive biological function, including intelligence. Millions of years in life consistently in the waters of several oceans, all the ancestors of man were carnivorous (Carnivores), fish-eating mammals. When the ocean retreated and the carnivorous (fish-eating) were on land, each individual privatized a "piece" of the ocean. Animals transformed it ito a pool of intercellular medium in vivo. The biological role of the late in the phylogeny of insulin is the formation of new biological functions in vivo. The action of insulin has transformed the carnivorous (fish-eating) ocean into herbivorous (Herbivores) species on land. There was it by synthesis in vivo from exogenous glucose of  acids (FA). Regulatory action of insulin was the directed conversion of exogenous glucose into ω-6 C18: 1 cis-oleic FA. Insulin late in phylogeny expressed the synthesis of new, conjugated enzymes: it is palmitoyl-CoA-elongase and stearyl-CoAdesaturase. Two enzymes synthesized FAs along the way: synthesized in situ de novo, from exogenous glucose, C16: 0  → C18: 0 stearic  → ω-6 C18: 1 cis-oleic  without accumulation of stearic FA. Insulin is not converted into an oleic FA exogenous  from carnivorous food. On land, the action of insulin transformed the species Homo sapiens, into a herbivore, but with carnivorous, fish-eating, past. The idea of a person as omnivorous (Omnivor) - nonsense; such forms of nature did not form. Violation of the function of nutrition, the biological reaction of exotrophy (external nutrition), is the etiological and pathogenetic basis of the seven metabolic pandemics, the diseases of civilization. 1. Atherosclerosis and atheromatosis; 2. metabolic arterial hypertension; 3. metabolic syndrome; 4. obesity; 5. syndrome of insulin resistance; 6. non-alcoholic  disease and 7. endogenous hyperuricemia. The primary prevention of metabolic pandemics in the biological function of nutrition, in the biological reactions of exo-and endotrophy, will allow us to understand the theoretical bases and implementation of preventive actions that will determine the characteristics of nutrition in the future.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818824>A Pathophysiological Model of Non-Alcoholic  Disease Using Precision-Cut  Slices.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is a common  disorder closely related to metabolic syndrome. NAFLD can progress to an inflammatory state called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which may result in the development of fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. To develop therapeutic strategies against NAFLD, a better understanding of the molecular mechanism is needed. Current in vitro NAFLD models fail to capture the essential interactions between  cell types and often do not reflect the pathophysiological status of patients. To overcome limitations of commonly used in vitro and in vivo models, precision-cut  slices (PCLSs) were used in this study. PCLSs, prepared from  tissue obtained from male Wistar rats, were cultured in supraphysiological concentrations of glucose, fructose, insulin, and  to mimic metabolic syndrome. Accumulation of lipid droplets was visible and measurable after 24 h in PCLSs incubated with glucose, fructose, and insulin, both in the presence and absence of . Upregulation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 and 2, and of sterol responsive element binding protein 1c, suggests increased de novo lipogenesis in PCLSs cultured under these conditions. Additionally, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 expression was reduced, which indicates impaired   transport and disrupted mitochondrial β-oxidation. Thus, steatosis was successfully induced in PCLSs with modified culture medium. This novel ex vivo NAFLD model could be used to investigate the multicellular and molecular mechanisms that drive NAFLD development and progression, and to study potential anti-steatotic drugs.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30738135>Permethrin and ivermectin modulate lipid metabolism in steatosis-induced HepG2 hepatocyte.</a></h2><p>Recent studies have reported the positive association between exposure to insecticides and increased risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes, which are closely associated with non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD). However, it is not known if insecticide exposure can contribute to NAFLD. Thus, the goal of the current study was to determine if insecticide exposures can exacerbate the physiological conditions of NAFLD by modulating hepatic lipid metabolism. The effects of 12 insecticides on triglycerides (TG) accumulation were tested using  (PA)-induced HepG2 hepatoma steatosis model. Results showed that among tested insecticides, permethrin and ivermectin significant interacted with  to potentiate (permethrin) or decrease (ivermectin) TG accumulation. Further study showed that permethrin significantly promoted   synthesis, while suppressed lipid oxidation-related genes only under steatosis conditions. In comparison, ivermectin inhibited lipogenesis-related genes and promoted farnesoid X receptor, which upregulates   oxidation. Results in this study suggested that hepatic lipid metabolism may be more susceptible to insecticide exposure in the presence of excessive  acids, which can be associated with the development of NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

For this reason, the current study was designed to scrutinize changing patterns of C16 and C18 FAs in 10 dromedary camels from the last 2 months of gestation to the first months of lactation. Camels were grazed on natural pasture and supplemented with a balanced ration.  biopsies were obtained through blind biopsy technique at about 60, 45, 30, and 15-day antepartum (AP), and at 3, 15, 30, 45, and 60 post-partum (PP). Data were analyzed by the ANOVA procedure of SPSS with repeated measurements. From 15-day AP, saturated FA content of the  declined (P < 0.01) and 15-day PP reached its peak (P = 0.02). At 30-day PP it went down (P < 0.01), and re-elevated at 45-day PP (P < 0.01) but remained at a steady state for the duration of the study. Mono-unsaturated and polyunsaturated FA content of hepatic tissue were constant throughout AP, albeit observed to peak at 15-day AP compared with 45 (P = 0.04) and 30-day AP (P < 0.01) for mono-unsaturated FAs, and with 60-, 45-, and 30-day AP (P ≤ 0.01) for polyunsaturated FAs. The  content of the  reached a nadir at 30-day AP (P < 0.01), increased sharply (P < 0.01) at the next sampling time-point, and had a trend to escalate until 3-day PP. Palmitoleic  levels were unchanged from 60- to 30-day AP, decreased at 15 AP and 3-day PP, increased at 15-day PP, then remained constant until the end of the study period (P ≤ 0.04). Stearic  content started to grow at 15-day AP and reached its peak at 15-day PP (P < 0.01). At 30-day PP, stearic level in  dropped abruptly (P < 0.01), then intensified at 45-day PP and did not change after; hepatic content of stearic  was lower during AP compared with PP time-points. Other C18 FAs changed significantly during the study period. These results suggest that parturition could have a profound effect on FA composition and other metabolites in camel .

The objective of this study is to delineate the mechanism of subdiaphragmatic vagotomy in preventing obesity, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance.By subjecting the complete subdiaphragmatic vagotomized mice to various nutritional conditions and investigating hepatic de novo lipogenesis pathway, we found that complete disruption of subdiaphragmatic vagal signaling resulted in a significant decrease of circulating VLDL-triglyceride compared with the mice obtained sham procedure. Vagotomy further prevented overproduction of VLDL-triglyceride induced by an acute fat load and a high-fat diet-induced obesity, hyperlipidemia, hepatic steatosis, and glucose intolerance. Mechanistic studies revealed that plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 was significantly raised in the vagotomized mice, which was associated with significant reductions in mRNA and protein expression of SREBP-1c (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c), SCD-1 (stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1), and FASN (  synthase), as well as enhanced hepatic insulin sensitivity. In vitro, treating mouse primary hepatocytes with a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, exendin-4, for 48 hours inhibited free  ,  treatment induced de novo lipid synthesis, and VLDL secretion from hepatocytes.Elevation of glucagon-like peptide-1 in vagotomized mice may prevent VLDL overproduction and insulin resistance induced by high-fat diet.

Due to the growing economic burden of NAFLD on public health, it has become an emergent target for clinical intervention. DUSP12 is a member of the dual specificity phosphatase (DUSP) family, which plays important roles in brown adipocyte differentiation, microbial infection, and cardiac hypertrophy. However, the role of DUSP12 in NAFLD has yet to be clarified. Here, we reveal that DUSP12 protects against hepatic steatosis and inflammation in L02 cells after /oleic  treatment. We demonstrate that hepatocyte specific DUSP12-deficient mice exhibit high-fat diet (HFD)-induced and high-fat high-cholesterol diet-induced hyperinsulinemia and  steatosis and decreased insulin sensitivity. Consistently, DUSP12 overexpression in hepatocyte could reduce HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and inflammation. At the molecular level, steatosis in the absence of DUSP12 was characterized by elevated apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), which mediates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and hepatic metabolism. DUSP12 physically binds to ASK1, promotes its dephosphorylation, and inhibits its action on ASK1-related proteins, JUN N-terminal kinase, and p38 MAPK in order to inhibit lipogenesis under high-fat conditions. Conclusion: DUSP12 acts as a positive regulator in hepatic steatosis and offers potential therapeutic opportunities for NAFLD.© 2019 The Authors.

The underlying mechanisms linking obesity to metabolic diseases are still less understandable.Previously, we screened a group of spontaneously obese rhesus monkeys. Here, we performed a plasma lipidomic analysis of normal and obese monkeys using gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (UPLC/MS).In total, 143 lipid species were identified, quantified, and classified into free  acids (FFA), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), lysophosphatidic  (LPA), and sphingomyelin (SM). Data analysis showed that the obese monkeys had increased levels of  acids palmitoleic  (C16:1) and arachidonic  (C20:4), FFA especially  (C16:0), as well as certain PC species and SM species. Surprisingly, the plasma level of LPA-C16:0 was approximately four-fold greater in the obese monkeys.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide peptide (GLPP) has therapeutic effect on NAFLD.Ob/ ob mouse model and ApoC3 transgenic mouse model were used for exploring the effect of GLPP on NAFLD. Key metabolic pathways and enzymes were identified by metabolomics combining with KEGG and PIUmet analyses and key enzymes were detected by Western blot.

Pathways of glycerophospholipid metabolism,   metabolism and primary bile  biosynthesis were involved in the therapeutic effect of GLPP on NAFLD. Detection of key enzymes revealed that GLPP reversed low expression of CYP7A1, CYP8B1, FXR, SHP and high expression of FGFR4 in ob/ob mice and ApoC3 mice.

Especially insulin signaling in the brain seems to impact whole body glucose homeostasis and interacts with   signaling. In humans circulating saturated  acids are negatively associated with brain insulin action while animal studies suggest both positive and negative interactions of  acids and insulin brain action. This apparent discrepancy might reflect a difference between acute and chronic   signaling. To address this question we investigated the acute effect of an intracerebroventricular  administration on peripheral glucose homeostasis. We developed and implemented a method for simultaneous monitoring of brain activity and peripheral insulin action in freely moving mice by combining radiotelemetry electrocorticography (ECoG) and euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps. This method allowed gaining insight in the early kinetics of brain   signaling and its contemporaneous effect on  function , which, to our knowledge, has not been assessed so far in mice.Insulin-induced brain activity in the theta and beta band was decreased by acute intracerebroventricular application of . Peripherally it amplified insulin action as demonstrated by a significant inhibition of endogenous glucose production and increased glucose infusion rate. Moreover, our results further revealed that the brain effect of peripheral insulin is modulated by  load in the brain.These findings suggest that insulin action is amplified in the periphery and attenuated in the brain by acute  application. Thus, our results indicate that acute  signaling in the brain may be different from chronic effects.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28779736>Dietary lipid requirement of lemon fin barb hybrid.</a></h2><p>The present study has been conducted to determine the optimal dietary requirement lipid of lemon fin barb hybrid fingerlings.

Thus, investigation of the metabolic pathways used by NIR probes such as cy-2-glu advances their use in the detection and monitoring of tumor progression in preclinical animal studies.Copyright © 2019 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625377>Thioacetamide potentiates high cholesterol and high fat diet induced steato-hepatitic changes in livers of C57BL/6J mice: A novel eight weeks model of fibrosing NASH.</a></h2><p>There is an inadequacy of relevant animal models to study non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis.

Molecular and cellular events related to inflammation, fibrosis, collagen deposition were studied. The FTH mice featured hepatic inflammation, severe diffuse fibrosis, and collagen deposition, which were less severe in FF & STH groups. In FTH group the protein expressions of α-SMA, TGF-ß, Col1 A1, CYP2E1, were up-regulated as compared to the FF group. The in-vivo findings were complemented in the LX-2 and Hep3B cells. The protein expressions of inflammatory and cellular injury markers were significantly higher in PA + TH exposed LX-2 cells. This novel model manifested hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in just eight weeks, which may be exploited for rapid screening of novel anti-NAFLD and  anti-fibrotic agents.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Lambs born from ewes supplemented with Ca salts of EPA + DHA, or palm FA distillate (PFAD) high in  and oleic  at 0.39% DM during the last 50 d of gestation were used. Lambs were weaned at 61 d of age and adapted to a high concentrate diet for 1.5 mo. After adaptation, 74 lambs (28 pens) were blocked by sex and BW and used in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments using the factors of dam supplementation (DS) and lamb supplementation (LS) of Ca salts of EPA + DHA or PFAD at 1.48% DM. Lambs were slaughtered after 42 d and  and adipose tissue collected for FA and gene expression analysis.  concentrations of EPA and DHA were greater (P < 0.01) with LS of EPA + DHA vs. PFAD during the finishing period. In adipose tissue, a lamb × dam interaction was observed for EPA (P = 0.02) and DHA (P = 0.04); LS of EPA + DHA increased EPA and DHA, but the increase was greatest in lambs born from ewes supplemented with PFAD. No lamb × dam treatment interactions were observed for gene expression in  tissue (P > 0.10). Hepatic mRNA abundance of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL; P = 0.01) was greater in lambs born from EPA + DHA ewes vs. lambs from PFAD ewes. mRNA expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (P < 0.01),   synthase (P = 0.01), Δ5-desaturase (P < 0.01), and Δ6-desaturase (P < 0.01) were decreased in  of EPA + DHA lambs. A significant lamb × dam diet interaction was observed for elongation of very long chain   2 in adipose tissue (P = 0.01); lambs supplemented with the same FA as their dams had lower expression. Expression of HSL tended (P = 0.08) to be decreased in adipose of EPA + DHA lambs born from EPA + DHA ewes. The changes in mRNA expression suggest that lipogenesis decreased, and lipolysis increased in lamb  with EPA + DHA vs. PFAD supplementation during the finishing period. In adipose tissue, changes suggest that lipogenesis decreased in lambs born from EPA + DHA supplemented dams and supplemented with EPA + DHA during the finishing period. In addition, these results suggest an interaction between supplementation of FA to dams during late gestation on lamb response of adipose tissue, but not , to FA supplementation during the finishing period.© The Author(s) 2019.

One of the hallmarks of NAFLD, hepatic steatosis, is a common feature in canine congenital portosystemic shunts. The aim of this study was to gain detailed insight into the pathogenesis of steatosis in this large animal model. Hepatic lipid accumulation, gene-expression analysis and HPLC-MS of neutral lipids and phospholipids in extrahepatic (EHPSS) and intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (IHPSS) was compared to healthy control dogs.  organoids of diseased dogs and healthy control dogs were incubated with - and oleic-, and lipid accumulation was quantified using LD540. In histological slides of shunt livers, a 12-fold increase of lipid content was detected compared to the control dogs (EHPSS P<0.01; IHPSS P = 0.042). Involvement of lipid-related genes to steatosis in portosystemic shunting was corroborated using gene-expression profiling. Lipid analysis demonstrated different triglyceride composition and a shift towards short chain and omega-3  acids in shunt versus healthy dogs, with no difference in lipid species composition between shunt types. All organoids showed a similar increase in triacylglycerols after free  acids enrichment. This study demonstrates that steatosis is probably secondary to canine portosystemic shunts. Unravelling the pathogenesis of this hepatic steatosis might contribute to a better understanding of steatosis in NAFLD.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29936274>Synthesis and evaluation of Ga labeled  for cardiac metabolic imaging.</a></h2><p>This work evaluates the potential of a Ga labeled long chain 16C   for cardiac metabolic imaging.

However, the mechanism underlying the effect of BBR is not fully understood. Stearyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD1) mediates lipid metabolism in . Therefore, we hypothesized that SCD1 mediated the beneficial effect of BBR on NAFLD.The expression of SCD1 was measured in the  of NAFLD patients and ob/ob mice. The effect of BBR on NAFLD was evaluated in C57BL/6 J mice on high fat diet (HFD). The effect of BBR was also investigated in HepG2 and AML12 cells exposed to high glucose and . Oil red O staining was performed to detect triglyceride (TG) level. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot were used to detect the messenger ribonucleic  (mRNA) and protein expression of target genes. The activity of SCD1 promoter was measured by dual-luciferase reporter assay.The expression of SCD1 was increased in the  of NAFLD patients and ob/ob mice. BBR reduced hepatic TG accumulation and decreased the expressions of hepatic SCD1 and other TG synthesis related genes both in vivo and in vitro. Knockdown of SCD1 expression mimicked the effect of BBR decreasing TG level in steatotic hepatocytes, whereas overexpression of SCD1 attenuated the effect of BBR. Mechanistically, BBR promoted the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) in HepG2 cells and the  of HFD-fed mice. Activation of the AMPK-SREBP-1c pathway and sterol regulatory element (SRE) motif in SCD1 promoter (-920/-550) was responsible for the BBR-induced suppression of SCD1.BBR reduces  TG synthesis and attenuates hepatic steatosis through the activation of AMPK-SREBP-1c-SCD1 pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The present study was designed to test whether this NLRP3 inflammasome activation contributes to the "two-hit" injury during nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and whether it can be a therapeutic target for the action of Fufang Zhenzhu Tiaozhi (FTZ), a widely used herbal remedy for hyperlipidemia and metabolic syndrome in China. We first demonstrated that NLRP3 inflammasome formation and activation as well as lipid deposition occurred in the  of mice on the high-fat diet (HFD), as shown by increased NLRP3 aggregation, enhanced production of IL-1 and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), and remarkable lipid deposition in  cells. FTZ extracts not only significantly reduced the NLRP3 inflammasome formation and activation but also attenuated the  steatosis and fibrogenic phenotype changed. In  studies,  (PA) was found to increase colocalization of NLRP3 components and enhanced caspase-1 activity in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), indicating enhanced formation and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes by PA. PA also increased lipid deposition. Nlrp3 siRNA can reverse this effect by silencing the NLRP3 inflammasome and both with FTZ. In FTZ-treated cells, not only inflammasome formation and activation was substantially attenuated but also lipid deposition in HSCs was blocked. This inhibition of FTZ on lipid deposition was similar to the effects of glycyrrhizin, an HMGB1 inhibitor. Mechanistically, stimulated membrane raft redox signaling platform formation and increased O production by PA to activate NLRP3 inflammasomes in HSCs was blocked by FTZ treatment. It is concluded that FTZ extracts inhibit NASH by its action on both inflammatory response and  lipid metabolism associated with NLRP3 inflammasome formation and activation.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28763157>A unifying mathematical model of lipid droplet metabolism reveals key molecular players in the development of hepatic steatosis.</a></h2><p>The  responds to elevated plasma concentrations of free  acids (FFAs) with an enhanced uptake of FFAs and their esterification to triacylglycerol (TAG). On the long term, this may result in massive hepatic TAG accumulation called steatosis hepatitis. In hepatocytes, the poor water-soluble TAG is packed in specialized organelles: Lipid droplets (LDs) serving as transient cellular deposit and lipoproteins (LPs) transporting TAG and cholesterol esters to extra-hepatic tissues. The dynamics of these organelles is controlled by a variety of regulatory surface proteins (RSPs). Assembly and export of VLDLs are mainly regulated by the microsomal transfer protein (MTP) and apoprotein B100. Formation and lipolysis of LDs are regulated by several RSPs. The best studied regulators belong to the PAT (Perilipin/Adipophilin/TIP47) and CIDE families. Knockdown or overexpression of SRPs may significantly affect the total number and size distribution of LDs. Intriguingly, a large cell-to-cell heterogeneity with respect to the number and size of LDs has been found in various cell types including hepatocytes. These findings suggest that the extent of cellular lipid accumulation is determined not only by the imbalance between lipid supply and utilization but also by variations in the expression of RSPs and metabolic enzymes. To better understand the relative regulatory impact of individual processes involved in the cellular TAG turnover, we developed a comprehensive kinetic model encompassing the pathways of the   and triglyceride metabolism and the main molecular processes governing the dynamics of LDs. The model was parametrized such that a large number of experimental in vitro and in vivo findings are correctly recapitulated. A control analysis of the model revealed that variations in the activity of FFA uptake, diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) 2, and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) have the strongest influence on the cellular TAG level. We used the model to simulate LD size distributions in human hepatoma cells and hepatocytes exposed to a challenge with FFAs. A random fold change by a factor of about two in the activity of RSPs was sufficient to reproduce the large diversity of droplet size distributions observed in individual cells. Under the premise that the same extent of variability of RSPs holds for the intact organ, our model predicts variations in the TAG content of individual hepatocytes by a factor of about 3-6 depending on the nutritional regime. Taken together, our modeling approach integrates numerous experimental findings on individual processes in the cellular TAG metabolism and LD dynamics metabolism to a consistent state-of-the-art dynamic network model that can be used to study how changes in the external conditions or systemic parameters will affect the TAG content of hepatocytes.© 2017 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29178411>Increased plasma oleoylethanolamide and palmitoleoylethanolamide levels correlate with inflammatory changes in alcohol binge drinkers: the case of HMGB1 in women.</a></h2><p>Alcohol binge drinking is a heavy pattern of alcohol consumption increasingly used by young people. In a previous study, we reported that young drinkers with a 2-year history of binge alcohol consumption had an overactivation of the innate immune system and peripheral inflammation when compared with controls. In the present study, we measured several biolipids that are   derivatives belonging to the acylethanolamide or 2-acylglycerol families in the plasma of the same subjects (n = 42; 20 men and 22 women). We found that during abstinence, alcohol binge drinkers had elevated plasma levels of oleoylethanolamide, palmitoleoylethanolamide, arachidonoylethanolamide, dihomo-γ-linolenoyl ethanolamide and linoleoyl ethanolamide, which positively correlated with changes in the mRNA expression of key inflammatory markers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, such as toll-like receptors (TLR4), pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and cyclooxygenase-2. Additionally, plasma oleoylethanolamide positively correlated with plasma levels of high mobility group box-1, which is a danger-associated molecular pattern and an endogenous TLR4 agonist, specifically in female alcohol binge drinkers. No changes were observed in 2-acylglycerols in alcohol binge drinkers, although sex-related differences in these bioactive lipids as well as in palmitoleoylethanolamide and docosatetraenoylethanolamide levels were detected. These results extend the previous clinical findings observed in patients diagnosed with long-term alcohol use disorder to young users and suggest a prominent role for these lipids in the response to acute alcohol exposure.© 2017 Society for the Study of Addiction.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29772372>Palmitate induces nitric oxide production and inflammatory cytokine expression in zebrafish.</a></h2><p>Inflammation markers in zebrafish embryos reflect a toxic response that is common to other animal models and humans.

Although free  -mediated apoptosis is a prominent feature of NASH, the impact of HCV infection on hepatocyte lipotoxicity has remained largely unexplored. The study aimed at identifying whether infection by HCV affected the apoptotic pathway in hepatocytes during   assault. MATERIAL AND METHODS OR6 cells, which are derived from human hepatocellular carcinoma Huh-7 cells and harbor a full-length HCV RNA genome replication system, were treated with palmitate. Apoptosis was examined by 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. Activation and expression of JNK, Bim, cIAP-1, and Mcl-1 were examined by immunoblotting. mRNA expression of CHOP, a major player in endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis, was assessed by real-time PCR. RESULTS Palmitate-induced hepatocyte apoptosis was significantly enhanced in OR6 cells compared to cured cells, in which the HCV genome had been eradicated by treatment with interferon-α. Although basal expression of CHOP mRNA was enhanced in OR6 cells compared to cured cells, it was similarly upregulated in both cell lines following palmitate treatment. Notably, palmitate-induced JNK phosphorylation was accentuated in OR6 cells compared to cured cells. Inhibition of JNK with SP600125 attenuated palmitate-induced apoptosis. Palmitate-mediated upregulation of BH3-only protein Bim, which acts downstream of JNK, was also enhanced in OR6 cells compared to cured cells. In contrast, Mcl-1 and cIAP-1 were equally reduced in OR6 cells and cured cells following palmitate treatment. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that during lipoapoptosis, HCV infection may enhance hepatocyte toxicity by increasing JNK phosphorylation.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28790196>TRIF-dependent Toll-like receptor signaling suppresses  transcription in hepatocytes and prevents diet-induced hepatic steatosis.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) includes a spectrum of diseases that ranges in severity from hepatic steatosis to steatohepatitis, the latter of which is a major predisposing factor for  cirrhosis and cancer. Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, which is critical for innate immunity, is generally believed to aggravate disease progression by inducing inflammation. Unexpectedly, we found that deficiency in TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-β (TRIF), a cytosolic adaptor that transduces some TLR signals, worsened hepatic steatosis induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) and that such exacerbation was independent of myeloid cells. The aggravated steatosis in  mice was due to the increased hepatocyte transcription of the gene encoding stearoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) desaturase 1 (SCD1), the rate-limiting enzyme for lipogenesis. Activation of the TRIF pathway by polyinosinic:polycytidylic  [poly(I:C)] suppressed the increase in SCD1 abundance induced by  or an HFD and subsequently prevented lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), a transcriptional regulator downstream of TRIF, acted as a transcriptional suppressor by directly binding to the  promoter. These results suggest an unconventional metabolic function for TLR/TRIF signaling that should be taken into consideration when seeking to pharmacologically inhibit this pathway.Copyright © 2017 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Knockdown PPARα/PPARγ in AML12 cells significantly and proportionally reduced the expressions of ATGL, CPT-1A and LC3II, which was induced by pioglitazone. Furthermore, facilitation of the autophagic flux by pioglitazone was obviously blocked by lysosomal inhibitor, leupeptin, to demonstrate accumulation of the LC3II and intracellular lipid in AML12 cells.

Calcium (Ca) homeostasis is considered to play a key role in ER stress. Matrine (Mat) has been applied for the treatment of hepatitis B, but its effect on NAFLD is still unknown, and there is no unified view of Mat on the regulation of ER stress in the previous literature.The pharmacological effects were studied in high-fat-diet or methionine-choline-deficient diet induced C57BL/6J mice models and in  (PA) induced L02 human  cell model.

The beneficial effect of Mat was associated with suppressing ER stress and restoring mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, Mat decreased the PA-induced lipid accumulation, ER stress and cytosolic calcium level ([Ca]) in hepatocyte cell lines in low and middle dose. However, the high dose Mat did not show satisfactory results in cell model. Calcium fluorescence experiments showed that Mat was able to regulate [Ca].

In view of the anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of polydatin, the current study aimed to investigate the pharmacological effects of polydatin on NASH and its related fibrosis.  C57BL/6 mice were fed with methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet to induce NASH and  fibrosis, and treated with or without polydatin (5 mg/kg, every other day, i.p) for 4 weeks. HepG2 cells induced by  (PA) were treated with polydatin.  The elevations of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), active caspase-3, TUNEL-positive cells, and triglyceride content were decreased by polydatin treatment. In addition, administration of polydatin to MCD-fed mice reduced oxidative stress by down-regulating NOX4 enzymes. Furthermore, the reduction in inflammation and CD68 macrophage activation correlated with inhibition of toll-like receptor (TLR)-4/NF-κB p65 signaling pathway by polydatin treatment. Polydatin also attenuated lipid accumulation, inflammation and apoptosis in HepG2 cells challenged by  (PA) combined with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Finally, the reduction of hepatic fibrosis by polydatin treatment corresponded to a reduction in hepatic gene expression of fibrosis markers.  These results suggest that polydatin prevents NASH and fibrosis via inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammation, highlighting polydatin as a potential therapeutic agent for prevention and treatment of NASH.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30255327>GC-MS metabolomics reveals disturbed metabolic pathways in primary mouse hepatocytes exposed to subtoxic levels of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA).</a></h2><p>3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) is a well-known hepatotoxic drug. Although its toxicity has been thoroughly studied at high concentrations, there is still insufficient knowledge on possible alterations of cell function at subtoxic concentrations, which are in fact more representative concentrations of intoxication scenarios. In this study, a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) metabolomics approach was used to investigate the metabolic changes in primary mouse hepatocytes (PMH) exposed to two subtoxic concentrations of MDMA (LC and LC) for 24 h. Metabolomic profiling of both intracellular metabolites and volatile metabolites in the extracellular medium of PMH was performed. Multivariate analysis showed that the metabolic pattern of cells exposed to MDMA discriminates from the controls in a concentration-dependent manner. Exposure to LC MDMA induces a significant increase in some intracellular metabolites, including oleic  and , and a decrease in glutamate, aspartate, 5-oxoproline, fumarate, malate, phosphoric , α-ketoglutarate and citrate. Extracellular metabolites such as acetophenone, formaldehyde, pivalic , glyoxal and 2-butanone were found significantly increased after exposure to MDMA, compared to controls, whereas 4-methylheptane, 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptene, nonanal, among others, were found significantly decreased. The panel of discriminatory metabolites is mainly involved in tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle,   metabolism, glutamate metabolism, antioxidant defenses and possibly changes in the  enzyme machinery. Overall, these results highlight the potential of the intra- and extracellular metabolome to study alterations triggered by subtoxic concentrations of MDMA in hepatic cell functions, which represents a more realistic appraisal of early toxicity events posed by exposure to this drug.

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of nuciferine on lipid and glucose metabolism in a murine model of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and to determine the underlying mechanisms of these effects.A murine model of T2DM was induced by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding combined with streptozocin (STZ) injections, and the diabetic mice were treated with nuciferine in their food. The underlying mechanism of the anti-steatotic effect of nuciferine was further explored in HepG2 hepatocytes cultured with . Major signalling profiles involved in   oxidation were then evaluated, using Western blot, RT-qPCR and si-RNA techniques, along with immunohistochemistry.Nuciferine restored impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in diabetic mice. Hepatic levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL were decreased, as were the number of lipid droplets, by nuciferine treatment. Furthermore, nuciferine up-regulated β-oxidation related genes in livers of diabetic mice. Luciferase reporter cell assay showed that nuciferine directly reversed -induced inhibition of PPARα transcriptional activity. Silencing PPARγ coactivator-1α (PGC1α) expression in HepG2 cells abolished the effects of nuciferine in accelerating β-oxidation.Nuciferine improved lipid profile and attenuated hepatic steatosis in HFD/STZ-induced diabetic mice by activating the PPARα/PGC1α pathway.

We previously reported that augmenter of  regeneration (ALR) alleviates ER stress and protects hepatocytes from lipotoxicity. However, the link between ALR protection and the suppression of ER stress remains unclear. In this study, we investigated whether the protection against  steatosis afforded by ALR is related to its inhibition of calcium overflow from the ER to the mitochondria. The treatment of HepG2 cells with  (PA) upregulated IP3R expression, triggering ER-luminal Ca release and inducing ER stress. However, in ALR-transfected (ALR-Tx) HepG2 cells, PA-induced cell injury was clearly alleviated compared with that in vector-Tx cells. After exposure to PA, IP3R expression was downregulated and ER stress was effectively inhibited in the ALR-Tx cells, and ER-Ca release and simultaneous mitochondrial Ca uptake were lower than those in vector-Tx cells. The knockdown of ALR expression with shRNA abolished the protective effects afforded by ALR transfection. PA treatment also suppressed the interaction between BCL-2 and IP3R in HepG2 cells, whereas this interaction was massively enhanced in the ALR-Tx cells, effectively reducing the IP3R-mediated ER-Ca release and thus mitochondrial Ca influx. Our results suggest that the inhibition of ER stress by ALR is related to the interruption of the interaction between BCL2 and IP3R, demonstrating a novel mechanism of ER stress resistance in ALR-Tx cells.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29447962>Low molecular weight fucoidan attenuates  injury via SIRT1/AMPK/PGC1α axis in db/db mice.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD), caused by elevated hepatic lipids, inflammation and oxidative stress, is the most common  disease globally. Low molecular weight fucoidan (LMWF), a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from brown seaweeds, has shown strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, which has not been explored in diabetes-induced NAFLD. Therefore, the present study sought to determine whether LMWF protects obese diabetic db/db mice against NAFLD. Results showed LMWF administration decreased plasma level of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total cholesterol, and triglyceride, as well as alleviated hepatic accumulation of triglyceride and total cholesterol in db/db mice. LMWF also ameliorated hepatic oxidative stress by suppressing superoxide production and lipid peroxidation, and increasing catalase and superoxide dismutase activity in the  of db/db mice. Furthermore, LMWF down-regulated several pro-inflammatory cytokines and transcription factor, and up-regulated the anti-inflammatory adiponectin. These changes were accompanied by the activation of hepatic SIRT1/AMPK/PGC1α signaling with LMWF treatment. In addition, blocking SIRT1 or AMPK by inhibitor notably abolished LMWF-elicited protection against -induced oxidative stress and inflammation in hepatocytes. These results suggest LMWF prevents NAFLD in db/db mice by activation of SIRT1/AMPK/PGC1α signaling pathway, which prevents lipotoxicity-related oxidative stress and inflammation. Therefore, LMWF provides a potential supplementary treatment for obesity/diabetes-induced NAFLD.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Chlorogenic  (CGA), a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compound, protects against high-fat-diet-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in . This study investigates whether CGA protects against FFA-induced hepatocyte lipotoxicity via the regulation of mitochondrial fission/fusion and elucidates its underlying mechanisms.AML12 cell, a non-transformed hepatocyte cell line, is treated with palmitate. Here, it is shown that CGA prevents palmitate-induced lipotoxicity by activation of SIRT1 regulated mitochondrial morphology. CGA treatment mitigates oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, as evidenced by a decrease in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and an increase in mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial membrane potential. CGA also significantly decreases Bax expression and thereby reduces mitochondria-mediated caspase-dependent apoptosis. Mechanistically, CGA attenuates ROS-induced mitochondrial fragmentation by inhibiting dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) and enhancing Mfn2 expression. In contrast, the inhibitory effects of CGA on the generation of mitochondrial ROS and Drp1 are blocked by siRNA knockdown of SIRT1.Collectively, these findings show that supplementation with CGA protects hepatocytes from FFA-induced lipotoxicity through activation of SIRT1, which reverses the oxidative stress and dysfunction of mitochondrial biogenesis directly.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Phytoestrogens are a group of plant-derived compounds that have been studied in the case of metabolic disorders treatment. Therefore, the aim of this study was to ascertain whether enterolactone (ENL), a commonly known phytoestrogen, may affect sphingolipid metabolism and decrease hepatic insulin resistance development in a lipid overload state.The study was conducted on HepG2 cells incubated with ENL and/or  (PA) for 16 h. Intra- and extracellular sphingolipid concentrations were assessed by high performance liquid chromatography. The expression of sphingolipid pathway enzymes, apoptosis and insulin signaling pathway proteins and glucose metabolism regulators were evaluated by Western Blot.In HepG2 cells, a considerable augmentation of intracellular ceramide and sphingosine concentration in ENL with PA group were indicated with simultaneous increase in extracellular ceramide concentration. The ENL treatment increased expression of selected enzymes from de novo ceramide synthesis pathway with lower expression of ceramide transfer protein. We also observed a decreased expression of insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of AKT and AMPK after exposure to ENL with PA. Our research demonstrated that ENL with PA resulted in an increased expression of caspase-3.Enterolactone, in a higher  acids availability, led to the development of hepatic IR in HepG2 cells.

Noteworthily, half replacement of HFD with olive oil (a mixed diet) has ameliorated NASH injury as well. It strikingly changed the hepatic histology from macrovesicular-steatosis into entire microvesicular-steatosis, and significantly reduced inflammation, ballooning and fibrosis.Our study has demonstrated in both hepatocytes and NASH rats that oleic acids had great potential to combat the saturated  acids induced hepatic lipotoxicity. Only half replacement of HFD by monounsaturated  acids rich diet still had significant therapeutic outcome in NASH rats.

Food habit changes, such as the quality of  acids in the diet, are proposed to treat and prevent these disorders. Some studies demonstrated that saturated  acids (SFA) are considered detrimental for treating these disorders. A high fat diet rich in , a SFA, is associated with lower insulin sensitivity and it may also increase atherosclerosis parameters.

These events are highly dependent on glucose utilization and inhibited by vitamin E (VE) (α-tocopherol) administration. Therefore, the present study aimed at assessing lipid metabolism in the gastric mucosa and ethanol-induced gastric damage and the effect of α-tocopherol administration. For this, rates of   β-oxidation and lipogenesis were tested in gastric mucosa samples. Through histological analysis, we found loss of the mucosa's superficial epithelium, which became gradually normalized during the recovery period. Proliferation of gastric mucosa occurred with augmented formation of β-oxidation by-products, diminished synthesis of triacylglycerols (TGs), as well as of phospholipids, and a reduced cytoplasmic NAD/NADH ratio, whereas the mitochondrial redox NAD/NADH ratio was much less affected. In addition, α-tocopherol increased  utilization in the gastric mucosa, which was accompanied by the induction of 'mirror image' effects on the cell redox state, reflected in an inhibited cell gastric mucosa proliferation by the vitamin administration. In conclusion, the present study shows, for the first time, the role of lipid metabolism in the adaptive cell gastric mucosa changes that drive proliferation after a chronic insult. Moreover, α-tocopherol increased gastric mucosa utilization of  associated with energy production.

Furthermore, coculture of hepatocytes with macrophages resulted in a greater IL-6 expression than culture of hepatocytes without macrophages in response to the combination of PA and LPS.

A previous study showed that SREBP‑2 also activated autophagic genes during cell‑sterol depletion. Alterations in autophagy are reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD). However, whether the regulation of SREBP‑2 restores dysfunctional autophagy in hepatocytes during NAFLD remains to be elucidated. In the present study, a steatosis model was established with  (PA) treatment at the indicated times and concentrations. Autophagosomes in hepatocytes were visualized by confocal microscopy after transfection with a tandem GFP‑mCherry‑LC3 construct. Autophagy‑associated protein levels were analyzed by western blot analysis. Loss‑ and gain‑of‑function studies were performed to examine the role of SREBP‑2 in the regulation of hepatocyte autophagy. It was demonstrated that PA induced autophagy and enhanced autophagic flux at the early stage, whereas prolonged treatment with PA resulted in dysfunction of autophagy in the PA‑induced steatotic hepatocytes. In addition, different cellular models presented with differing dysfunctional autophagy in response to   overload. It was also confirmed that SREBP‑2 regulated autophagy‑related gene expression in hepatocytes, and it was shown that the overexpression of SREBP‑2 increased the expression of autophagy‑related genes, but did not affect the inhibition of the autophagic flux in lipid‑overloaded HL‑7702 cells. By contrast, increased SREBP‑2 partly restored the inhibited autophagic activity in lipid‑overloaded hepatoma HepG2 cells. Taken together, the present study demonstrated that autophagic function was impaired in lipid‑overloaded human hepatocytes, and the differential effect of PA on autophagy was associated with the duration of PA and the cell type. Under these conditions, the overexpression of SREBP‑2 alleviated the inhibited autophagic activity rather than the inhibition of autophagic flux.

Primary rat hepatocytes were treated with  (PA) for various periods of time. Mitophagy was measured by protein levels of LC3II and P62. NLRP3, caspase-1, interleukin (IL)-18, and IL-1β at mRNA and protein levels were used as indicators of inflammasome activation. Along with steatotic progression in HFCD-fed mice, ratio of LC3II/β-actin was decreased concurrently with increased levels of  P62, NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-1β, IL-18, and serum IL-1β levels in late-stage NASH. PA treatment resulted in mitochondrial oxidative stress and initiated mitophagy in primary hepatocytes. The addition of cyclosporine A did not change LC3II/Τοmm20 ratios; but P62 levels were increased after an extended duration of PA exposure, indicating a defect in autophagic activity. Along with impaired mitophagy, mRNA and protein levels of NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-18 and IL-1β were upregulated by PA treatment. Pretreatment with MCC950, N-acetyl cysteine or acetyl-L-carnitine reversed inflammasome activation and a pyroptotic cascade. Additionally, mitophagic flux was partially recovered as indicated by increases in LC3II/Tomm20 ratio, parkin, and PINK1 expression, and decreased P62 expression.

Likewise, the combined lipid and TNFα treatment of PHH, HuH7 and HepG2 cell cultures revealed 154, 1238 and 278 differentially expressed genes. Although genomic responses differed among in-vitro systems, commonalities were ascertained by filtering the data for LD associated gene regulations. Among others the LD-growth and fusion associated cell death inducing DFFA like effector C (CIDEC), perilipins (PLIN2, PLIN3), the synaptosome-associated-protein 23 and the vesicle associated membrane protein 3 were strongly up-regulated.

Their inhibition ameliorates triglyceride and cholesterol accumulation. TNFα treatment elicited strong induction of the chemokine CXCL8, the kinases MAP3K8, MAP4K4 and negative regulators of cytokine signaling, i.e. SOCS2&SOCS3.

To disclose the hypothesis, we utilized miR-33a mimic and antisense to explore their effects in primary hepatocytes or high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Treatment with  (PA) or HFD significantly increased the expression of miR-33a in hepatocytes or  tissues. In primary hepatocytes, miR-33a mimic decreased mitochondrial function, including reduction of ATP production and oxygen consumption, whereas miR-33a inhibition protected PA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Interestingly, miR-33a selectively suppressed mitochondrial complex I activity and protein expression, but not other complexes. Through bioinformatics prediction, we found miR-33a directly targeted on the 3'-UTR of NDUFA5. Dual-luciferase reporter analysis further confirmed the direct suppression of miR-33a on NDUFA5 expression. More importantly, administration of miR-33a antisense could effectively restore HFD-induced mitochondrial dysfunction through up-regulation of NDUFA5 levels. Mice treated with miR-33a antisense also exhibited improved  function and structural disorders under obese status.

GDM offspring were divided into three groups: GDM offspring (soybean oil), n-3 PUFA adequate offspring (fish oil), and n-3 PUFA deficient offspring (safflower oil), fed up to 11 months old. The diabetic risk of GDM offspring gradually increased from no change at weaning to obvious impaired glucose and insulin tolerance at 11 months old. N-3 PUFA decreased oxidative stress and inflammation in the  of older GDM offspring. There was a differential effect of n-3 PUFA and n-6 PUFA on hepatic telomere length in GDM offspring. Non-targeted metabolomics showed that n-3 PUFA played a modulating role in the , in which numerous metabolites and metabolic pathways were altered when GDM offspring grew to old age. Many metabolites were related to diabetes risk, such as α-linolenic , , ceramide, oxaloacetic , tocotrienol, tetrahydro-11-deoxycortisol, andniacinamide. In summary, GDM offspring exhibited obvious diabetes risk at old age, whereas n-3 PUFA decreased this risk.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30298839>[The involvement of NOX1/NADPH oxidase in the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis].</a></h2><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to play a critical role in the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). To clarify the source of ROS, we examined the expression of superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase isoforms in the  of high-fat and high-cholesterol (HFC) diet-fed mice. The mRNA expression of NOX1 was significantly elevated in mice on HFC diet for 8 weeks. Increased levels of serum alanine aminotransferase and hepatic cleaved caspase-3 in HFC diet-fed wild-type mice (WT) were significantly ameliorated in mice deficient in Nox1 (Nox1-KO). Increased nitrotyrosine adduct formation, a marker of peroxynitrite-induced injury, was observed in hepatic sinusoids of WT, which was significantly suppressed in NOX1-KO. NOX1 mRNA was mainly expressed in  sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), and it was significantly up-regulated in primary cultured LSECs treated with  (PA). The production of nitric oxide by LSECs and LSECs-dependent relaxation of hepatic stellate cells were significantly attenuated by PA treatment. In contrast, these effects of PA were not observed in cells isolated from Nox1-KO. Taken together, the up-regulation of NOX1 in LSECs may elicit peroxynitrite-mediated cellular injury and impair hepatic microcirculation through reduced bioavailability of nitric oxide. ROS derived from NOX1 may therefore constitute a critical component in the development of NASH.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29290651>miR-192-5p regulates lipid synthesis in non-alcoholic  disease through SCD-1.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the levels of miR-192-5p in non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) models and demonstrate the role of miR-192-5p in lipid accumulation.Thirty Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups, which were given a standard diet, a high-fat diet (HFD), and an HFD with injection of liraglutide. At the end of 16 weeks, hepatic miR-192-5p and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD-1) levels were measured. MiR-192-5p mimic and inhibitor and SCD-1 siRNA were transfected into Huh7 cells exposed to  (PA). Lipid accumulation was evaluated by oil red O staining and triglyceride assays. Direct interaction was validated by dual-luciferase reporter gene assays.The HFD rats showed a 0.46-fold decrease and a 3.5-fold increase in hepatic miR-192-5p and SCD-1 protein levels compared with controls, respectively, which could be reversed after disease remission by liraglutide injection ( < 0.01). The Huh7 cells exposed to PA also showed down-regulation and up-regulation of miR-192-5p and SCD-1 protein levels, respectively ( < 0.01). Transfection with miR-192-5p mimic and inhibitor in Huh7 cells induced dramatic repression and promotion of SCD-1 protein levels, respectively ( < 0.01). Luciferase activity was suppressed and enhanced by miR-192-5p mimic and inhibitor, respectively, in wild-type SCD-1 ( < 0.01) but not in mutant SCD-1.

These include the infiltration of macrophages into hepatic cords in response to incompletely understood stimuli. Stressed hepatocytes release an increased number of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are known to participate in intercellular signaling and coordination of the behavior of immune cell populations via their cargo. We hypothesized that hepatocyte-derived lipotoxic EVs that are enriched in sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) are effectors of macrophage infiltration in the hepatic microenvironment.  Lipotoxic EVs were isolated from palmitate treated immortalized mouse hepatocytes and characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis. Lipotoxic EV sphingolipids were quantified using tandem mass spectrometry. Wildtype and S1P receptor knockout bone marrow-derived macrophages were exposed to lipotoxic EV gradients in a microfluidic gradient generator. Macrophage migration toward EV gradients was captured by time-lapse microscopy and analyzed to determine directional migration. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting along with quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry were utilized to characterize the cell surface expression of S1P receptor on intrahepatic leukocytes and hepatic expression of S1P receptor, respectively.  Palmitate treatment induced the release of EVs. These EVs were enriched in S1P. Palmitate-induced S1P enriched EVs were chemoattractive to macrophages. EV S1P enrichment depended on the activity of sphingosine kinases 1 and 2, such that, pharmacological inhibition of sphingosine kinases 1 and 2 resulted in a significant reduction in EV S1P cargo without affecting the number of EVs released. When exposed to EVs derived from cells treated with palmitate in the presence of a pharmacologic inhibitor of sphingosine kinases 1 and 2, macrophages displayed diminished chemotactic behavior. To determine receptor-ligand specificity, we tested the migration responses of macrophages genetically deleted in the S1P receptor toward lipotoxic EVs. S1P receptor knockout macrophages displayed a marked reduction in their chemotactic responses toward lipotoxic palmitate-induced EVs. Palmitate-induced lipotoxic EVs are enriched in S1P through sphingosine kinases 1 and 2. S1P-enriched EVs activate persistent and directional macrophage chemotaxis mediated by the S1P receptor, a potential signaling axis for macrophage infiltration during hepatic lipotoxicity, and a potential therapeutic target for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30102772>Macrophage-Specific Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1α Contributes to Impaired Autophagic Flux in Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory cell activation drives diverse cellular programming during hepatic diseases. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) have recently been identified as important regulators of immunity and inflammation. In nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), HIF-1α is upregulated in hepatocytes, where it induces steatosis; however, the role of HIF-1α in macrophages under metabolic stress has not been explored. In this study, we found increased HIF-1α levels in hepatic macrophages in methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet-fed mice and in macrophages of patients with NASH compared with controls. The HIF-1α increase was concomitant with elevated levels of autophagy markers BNIP3, Beclin-1, LC3-II, and p62 in both mouse and human macrophages. LysM HIF fl/fl mice, which have HIF-1α levels stabilized in macrophages, showed higher steatosis and  inflammation compared with HIF fl/fl mice on MCD diet. In vitro and ex vivo experiments reveal that saturated  ,  (PA), both induces HIF-1α and impairs autophagic flux in macrophages. Using small interfering RNA-mediated knock-down and overexpression of HIF-1α in macrophages, we demonstrated that PA impairs autophagy via HIF-1α. We found that HIF-1α mediates NF-κB activation and MCP-1 production and that HIF-1α-mediated impairment of macrophage autophagy increases IL-1β production, contributing to MCD diet-induced NASH. Conclusion:  impairs autophagy via HIF-1α activation in macrophages. HIF-1α and impaired autophagy are present in NASH in vivo in mouse macrophages and in human blood monocytes. We identified that HIF-1α activation and decreased autophagic flux stimulate inflammation in macrophages through upregulation of NF-κB activation. These results suggest that macrophage activation in NASH involves a complex interplay between HIF-1α and autophagy as these pathways promote proinflammatory overactivation in MCD diet-induced NASH.© 2018 by the American Association for the Study of  Diseases.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29501845>Acetone fraction from Sechium edule (Jacq.)

(Cucurbitaceae) is one of the most valued plant species to treat cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension. Fruits, young leaves, buds, stems, and tuberous roots of the plant are edible. Considering that endothelial dysfunction induced by Angiotensin II plays an important role in the pathogenesis of hypertension and is accompanied by a prooxidative condition, which in turn induces an inflammatory state, vascular remodeling, and tissue damage, and that S. edule has been reported to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antihypertensive activity, its capability to control endothelial dysfunction was also assessed.To assess in vivo the anti-endothelial dysfunction activity of the acetone fraction (rSe-ACE) of the hydroalcoholic extract from S. edule roots.Endothelial dysfunction was induced in female C57BL/6 J mice by a daily intraperitoneal injection of angiotensin II for 10 weeks. Either rSe-ACE or losartan (as a control) were co-administered with angiotensin II for the same period. Blood pressure was measured at weeks 0, 5, and 10. Kidney extracts were prepared to determine IL1β, IL4, IL6, IL10, IL17, IFNγ, TNFα, and TGFβ levels by ELISA, along with the prooxidative status as assessed by the activity of antioxidant enzymes. The expression of ICAM-1 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in kidney histological sections. Kidney and hepatic damage, as well as vascular tissue remodeling, were studied.The rSe-ACE fraction administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg was able to control hypertension, as well as the prooxidative and proinflammatory status in kidney as efficiently as losartan, returning mice to normotensive levels. Additionally, the fraction was more efficient than losartan to prevent  and kidney damage. Phytochemical characterization identified cinnamic  as a major compound, and linoleic, , and myristic acids as the most abundant non-polar components in the mixture, previously reported to aid in the control of hypertension, inflammation, and oxidative stress, three important components of endothelial dysfunction.this study demonstrated that rSe-ACE has anti-endothelial dysfunction activity in an experimental model and highlights the role of cinnamic  and  acids in the observed effects.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The present study intended to reveal the effect and mechanism of AA on nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) associated with lipid accumulation by activating Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and  X receptors (LXRs) signaling. C57BL/6 mice were received a modified Lieber-DeCarli diet with 71% high-fat (L-D) and treated with AA (20 and 40 mg/kg) or equal volume of saline for 12 weeks. The regulation of AA on lipid accumulation was also detected in pro-steatotic stimulated AML12 cells with  (PA). When L-D diet-fed mice were treated with AA, loss in body weight,  index, and  lipid droplet were observed along with reduced triglyceride (TG) and serum transaminase. Furthermore, AA decreased sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) and target genes expression, regulated PPARα and PPARγ expressions, ameliorated hepatic fibrosis markers, enhanced hepatic FXR and LXR, and regulated AMPK-LKB1 and SIRT1 signaling pathway. Moreover, AA attenuated lipid accumulation via FXR and LXR activation in steatotic AML-12 cells, which was confirmed by guggulsterones (FXR antagonist) or GW3965 (LXR agonist). Activation of FXR and LXR signaling caused by AA might increase AMPK-SIRT1 signaling and then contribute to modulating lipid accumulation and   synthesis, which suggested that activated FXR-LXR axis by AA represented an effective strategy for relieving NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Histological staining's, and commercially available kits for ALT and AST and hepatic contents of TG, TC, MDA, SOD, and GSH were used to assess NASH. Furthermore, relative  protein and gene expression levels were determined by Western Blot and qPCR, respectively.After establishing NASH models, LH treatment improved lipid accumulation, hepatic contents of TG, TC, and expression levels of ALT and AST in dose-dependent manner. Also, LH improved MDA, SOD, and GSH expression levels. The results of RT-PCR and Western blotting showed that LH upregulated the expression of AMPK phosphorylation and downregulated SREBP-1c and its target genes expression level.Our data reveal the promising role of Leonurine hydrochloride in the prevention and treatment of NASH, in vitro and in vivo.

Saturated   palmitate stimulates lipid accumulation and apoptosis in hepatocytes. In the present study, we examined bee-bee tree oil (BO)-mediated protective effects on palmitate-induced lipid accumulation and apoptosis in mouse primary hepatocytes. Cells were cultured in a control media or the same media containing 150 or 300 µmol/L of albumin-bound palmitate for 24 h. BO concentrations used were 0, 0.1, 0.2, or 0.5%. Palmitate induced lipid accumulation and mRNA expression of lipogenic genes such as SREBP1c and SCD1. However, BO prevented these changes. Furthermore, palmitate stimulated caspase-3 activity and decreased cell viability in the absence of BO. BO reduced palmitate-induced activation of caspase-3 and cell death in a dose-dependent manner. AMP-activated protein kinase inhibitors abolished the effects of BO. Furthermore, BO suppressed palmitate-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation through the 5&apos; adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent pathway. In conclusion, BO attenuated palmitate-induced hepatic steatosis and apoptosis through AMPK-mediated suppression of JNK signaling.

Thus, DCI could improve insulin sensitivity by suppressing hepatic gluconeogenesis.

This condition is associated with dyslipidemia and predisposition to cardiovascular diseases.

Similarly, the metabolism of these lipids in the arthritic  has not yet been clarified. Aiming at filling these gaps this study presents a characterization of the circulating lipid profile and of the  acids uptake and metabolism in perfused livers of rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis. The levels of TG and total cholesterol were reduced in both serum (10-20%) and  (20-35%) of arthritic rats. The levels of circulating FFA were 40% higher in arthritic rats, possibly in consequence of cytokine-induced adipose tissue lipolysis. Hepatic uptake and oxidation of  and oleic acids was higher in arthritic livers. The phenomenon results possibly from a more oxidized state of the arthritic . Indeed, NADPH/NADP and NADH/NAD ratios were 30% lower in arthritic livers, which additionally presented higher activities of the citric  cycle driven by both endogenous and exogenous FFA. The lower levels of circulating and hepatic TG possibly are caused by an increased oxidation associated to a reduced synthesis of  acids in arthritic livers. These results reveal that the lipid hepatic metabolism in arthritic rats presents a strong catabolic tendency, a condition that should contribute to the marked cachexia described for arthritic rats and possibly for the severe rheumatoid arthritis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

PAHSAs reduce ambient glycemia and improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant aged chow- and high-fat diet-fed (HFD-fed) mice. Here, we aimed to determine the mechanisms by which PAHSAs improve insulin sensitivity. Both acute and chronic PAHSA treatment enhanced the action of insulin to suppress endogenous glucose production (EGP) in chow- and HFD-fed mice.

The mechanisms by which PAHSAs enhanced hepatic insulin sensitivity included direct and indirect actions involving intertissue communication between adipose tissue and . PAHSAs inhibited lipolysis directly in WAT explants and enhanced the action of insulin to suppress lipolysis during the clamp in vivo. Preventing the reduction of free  acids during the clamp with Intralipid infusion reduced PAHSAs' effects on EGP in HFD-fed mice but not in chow-fed mice. Direct hepatic actions of PAHSAs may also be important, as PAHSAs inhibited basal and glucagon-stimulated EGP directly in isolated hepatocytes through a cAMP-dependent pathway involving Gαi protein-coupled receptors.

In this study, a mixture of HepG2 cells treated with free   (FFA)- and oleic -and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed obese mice were used; in this background, the triglyceride (TG) levels in HepG2 cells and mice  were measured, and the expression levels of genes associated with lipogenesis,   oxidation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and autophagy were determined. Treatment of HepG2 cells with FFA enhanced intracellular TG levels in HepG2 cells, but co-treatment with PCW significantly attenuated the TG levels. Notably, PCW significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) in FFA-treated HepG2 cells. PCW downregulated the expression of lipogenesis-related genes, but upregulated the expression of genes associated with   oxidation. Further, PCW inhibited FFA-induced expression of ER stress markers and induced autophagy proteins. However, inhibition of AMPK significantly attenuated the beneficial effects of PCW in HepG2 cells. Moreover, PCW efficiently decreased HFD-induced hepatic TG accumulation in vivo and increased the phosphorylation of hepatic AMPK. Three compounds present in PCW including poricoic , pachymic , and ergosterol, significantly decreased FFA-induced increase in intracellular TG levels, consistent with increased AMPK phosphorylation, suggesting that poricoic , pachymic , and ergosterol are responsible for PCW-mediated amelioration of hepatic steatosis.

Increased hepatocellular damage was observed in PA-treated hepatocytes with TPM or CSE treatment, but increased triglyceride level was only observed in PA plus LPS-treated hepatocytes with a high concentration of TPM. Also, expression levels of steatohepatitis-related genes such as TNF-α, NOS 2, and SREBP-1c were significantly increased after treatment of TPM. To further demonstrate the role of Kupffer cells (KCs) after CS extracts treatment, trans-well co-culture system of hepatocytes and KCs was utilized. The levels of inflammatory cytokines and the ratios of Bax/Bcl-2 (apoptosis-related genes) were markedly increased in co-cultured hepatocytes after TPM or CSE treatment. Interestingly, KCs activation was augmented in KCs upon treatment with CSE or TPM.

The levels of IL-1β and IL-18 in the supernatant of KCs were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Our results showed that CTSB inhibition improved the  function and reduced hepatic inflammation and ballooning, and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 were decreased. The expressions of CTSB and caspase-1 in  tissues were increased in the NASH group. In in vitro experiments, PA stimulation could increase the expressions of CTSB and NLRP3 inflammasome in KCs, and CTSB inhibition downregulated the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome in KCs, when challenged by PA. Moreover, CTSB inhibition effectively suppressed the expression and activity of caspase-1 and subsequently secretions of IL-1β and IL-18. Collectively, these results suggest that CTSB inhibition limits NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent NASH formation through regulating the expression and activity of caspase-1, thus providing a novel anti-inflammatory signal pathway for the therapy of NAFLD.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30460699>Unsaturated  Acids Increase the Expression of Hepassocin through a Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3-Dependent Pathway in HepG2 Cells.</a></h2><p>Hepassocin (HPS) is a hepatokine that regulates hepatocyte proliferation. It is known that HPS plays an important role in the development of nonalcoholic  diseases (NAFLD).  acids, such as oleic  (OLA), exhibit the ability to activate the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3), and the binding site of STAT3 is found in the promoter region of HPS. However, the regulation of HPS by  acids is still obscure. To clarify the regulation of HPS, we detected the expression of HPS by western blots. In addition, a hepatic steatosis cell culture model was established by treatment of different  acids, including linoleic  (LNA), oleic , , and stearic . The intracellular lipid accumulation was confirmed by oil red O staining. Blocking of STAT3 activity was achieved by the pretreatment of the STAT3 inhibitor, stattic. We found that activation of STAT3 by interleukin-6 (IL-6) was mediated in the regulation of HPS expression. Treatment of unsaturated  acids significantly induced intracellular lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. Moreover, the expressions of HPS were increased in unsaturated  -treated HepG2 cells, as compared with saturated  -treated groups. Also, the expression of HPS induced by OLA was blocked by the inhibition of STAT3 activity. Furthermore, we found that deletion of HPS by small interfering ribonucleic  transfection decreased the protective effect of OLA on cell viability. Taken together, we provided evidence that STAT3 plays an important role in the regulation of OLA-induced HPS expression and the increased HPS may further participate in the development of NAFLD. In addition, the increase of HPS might be involved in the protective effect of OLA on cell viability.© 2018 AOCS.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31393851>Degradation of splicing factor SRSF3 contributes to progressive liver disease.</a></h2><p>Serine rich splicing factor 3 (SRSF3) plays a critical role in liver function and its loss promotes chronic liver damage and regeneration. As a consequence, genetic deletion of SRSF3 in hepatocytes caused progressive liver disease and ultimately led to hepatocellular carcinoma. Here we show that SRSF3 is decreased in human liver samples with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), or cirrhosis that was associated with alterations in RNA splicing of known SRSF3 target genes. Hepatic SRSF3 expression was similarly decreased and RNA splicing dysregulated in mouse models of NAFLD and NASH. We showed that -induced oxidative stress caused conjugation of the ubiquitin like NEDD8 protein to SRSF3 and proteasome mediated degradation. SRSF3 was selectively neddylated at lysine11 and mutation of this residue (SRSF3-K11R) was sufficient to prevent both SRSF3 degradation and alterations in RNA splicing. Finally prevention of SRSF3 degradation in vivo partially protected mice from hepatic steatosis, fibrosis and inflammation. These results highlight a neddylation-dependent mechanism regulating gene expression in the liver that is disrupted in early metabolic liver disease and may contribute to the progression to NASH, cirrhosis and ultimately hepatocellular carcinoma.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29037332>Dihydrosterculic  from cottonseed oil suppresses desaturase activity and improves  metabolomic profiles of high-fat-fed mice.</a></h2><p>Polyunsaturated   (PUFA)-rich diets are thought to provide beneficial effects toward metabolic health in part through their bioactive properties. We hypothesized that increasing PUFA intake in mice would increase peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta (PPARδ) expression and activity, and we sought to examine the effect of different PUFA-enriched oils on muscle PPARδ expression. One of the oils we tested was cottonseed oil (CSO) which is primarily linoleic  (53%) and  (24%). Mice fed a CSO-enriched diet (50% energy from fat) displayed no change in muscle PPARδ expression; however, in the , it was consistently elevated along with its transcriptional coactivator Pgc-1. Male mice were fed chow or CSO-, saturated fat (SFA)-, or linoleic  (18:2)-enriched diets that were matched for macronutrient content for 4 weeks. There were no differences in food intake, body weight, fasting glucose, glucose tolerance, or energy expenditure between chow- and CSO-fed mice, whereas SFA-fed mice had increased fat mass and 18:2-fed mice were less glucose tolerant. Metabolomic analyses revealed that the livers of CSO-fed mice closely matched those of chow-fed but significantly differed from SFA- and 18:2-enriched groups.   composition of the diets and livers revealed an impairment in desaturase activity and the presence of dihydrosterculic  (DHSA) in the CSO-fed mice. The effect of DHSA on PPARδ and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 expression mimicked that of the CSO-fed mice. Taken together, these data suggest that DHSA from CSO may be an effective means to increase PPARδ expression with concomitant suppression of  stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 activity.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The pathogenic basis of NAFLD progressing to NASH is currently unknown, but growing evidence suggests MD2 (myeloid differentiation factor 2), an accessory protein of TLR4, is an important signalling component contributing to this disease. We evaluated the effectiveness of the specific MD2 inhibitor, L6H21, in reducing inflammatory  injury in a relevant high-fat diet (HFD) mouse model of NASH and in the  (PA)-stimulated human  cell line (HepG2). For study, genetic knockout (MD2 ) mice were fed a HFD or control diet for 24 weeks, or wild-type mice placed on a similar diet regimen and treated with L6H21 for the last 8 or 16 weeks. Results indicated that MD2 inhibition with L6H21 was as effective as MD2 knockout in preventing the HFD-induced hepatic lipid accumulation, pro-fibrotic changes and expression of pro-inflammatory molecules. Direct challenge of HepG2 with PA (200 μM) increased MD2-TLR4 complex formation and expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic genes and L6H21 pre-treatment prevented these PA-induced responses. Interestingly, MD2 knockout or L6H21 increased expression of the anti-inflammatory molecule, PPARγ, in  tissue and the  cell line. Our results provide further evidence for the critical role of MD2 in the development of NASH and conclude that MD2 could be a potential therapeutic target for NAFLD/NASH treatment. Moreover, the small molecule MD2 inhibitor, L6H21, was an effective and selective investigative agent for future mechanistic studies of MD2.© 2017 The Authors.

Brain δ C was found to be more enriched than  or blood pools (-16.7 ± 0.2 mUr, mean ± SD). Two end-member-mixed modeling using the carbon isotopic signature of dietary PAM and dietary sugars determined the contribution of synthesis to the total tissue PAM pool to range between 44% and 48%.

Herein, early and persistently elevated, proinflammatory cytokine HMGB1 expression was detected in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD model in C57BL/6 mice. The expression and extracellular release of HMGB1 was rapidly and dramatically induced by saturated  in vitro. HFD-induced inflammatory response and  function impairment were both mitigated after the inhibition of endogenous HMGB1 by neutralizing antibody in vivo. The up-regulation of HMGB1 was thought to be modified by dual channels: in the transcriptional level, it was regulated by JNK1/JNK2-ATF2 axis; post-transcriptionally, it was regulated by the microRNA (miR)-200 family, especially miR-429. miR-429  conditional knockout mice (miR-429), fed either a normal diet or an HFD, showed severe  inflammation and dysfunction, accompanied by greater expression of HMGB1. Intriguingly, the up-regulation and release of HMGB1 could in turn self-activate TLR4-JNK1/JNK2-ATF2 signaling, thus forming a positive feedback.

However, the effect of procyanidin B2 on free  acids (FFAs)-induced hepatic steatosis remains obscure. The present study is therefore aimed to elucidate the protective effect of procyanidin B2 against hepatic steatosis and its underlying mechanism. Herein, we reported that procyanidin B2 attenuated FFAs-induced lipid accumulation and its associated oxidative stress by scavenging excessive ROS and superoxide anion radicals, blocking loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, restoring glutathione content, and increasing activity of antioxidant enzymes (GPx, SOD and CAT) in hepatocytes. Procyanidin B2 mechanistically promoted lipid degradation via modulation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal pathway. Molecular docking analysis indicated a possible ligand-binding position of procyanidin B2 with TFEB. In addition, administration of procyanidin B2 resulted in a significant reduction of hepatic fat accumulation in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice, and also ameliorated HFD-induced metabolic abnormalities, including hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia. It was confirmed that procyanidin B2 prevented HFD-induced hepatic fat accumulation through down-regulating lipogenesis-related gene expressions (PPARγ, C/EBPα and SREBP-1c), inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines production (IL-6 and TNF-α) and increasing antioxidant enzymes activity (GPx, SOD and CAT). Moreover, hepatic  acids analysis indicated that procyanidin B2 caused a significant increase in the levels of , oleic  and linoleic . Intriguingly, procyanidin B2 restored the decreased nuclear TFEB expression in HFD-induced  steatosis and up-regulated its target genes involved in lysosomal pathway (Lamp1, Mcoln, Uvrag), which suggested a previously unrecognized mechanism of procyanidin B2 on ameliorating HFD-induced hepatic steatosis. Taken together, our results demonstrated that procyanidin B2 attenuated FFAs-induced hepatic steatosis through regulating TFEB-mediated lysosomal pathway and redox state, which had important implications that modulation of TFEB might be a potential therapeutic strategy for hepatic steatosis and procyanidin B2 could represent a promising novel agent in the prevention and treatment of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD).Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Forty male C57BL/6J mice (9week-old) were randomly assigned into four groups (n=10) and fed: i) a low-fat diet; ii) a low-fat diet supplemented with 1% (wt:vol) serine; iii) a high-fat (HF) diet; and iv) a HF diet supplemented with 1% serine, respectively.  (PA)-treated primary hepatocytes separated from adult mice were also used to study the effects of serine on oxidative stress. The results showed that serine supplementation increased glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, and protected mice from hepatic lipid accumulation, but did not significantly decreased HF diet-induced weight gain. In addition, serine supplementation protected glutathione (GSH) antioxidant system and prevented hypermethylation in the promoters of glutathione synthesis-related genes, while decreasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mice fed a HF diet. Moreover, we found that serine supplementation increased phosphorylation and S-glutathionylation of AMP-activated protein kinase α subunit (AMPKα), and decreased ROS, malondialdehyde and triglyceride contents in PA-treated primary hepatocytes. However, while AMPK activity or GSH synthesis was inhibited, the abovementioned effects of serine on PA-treated primary hepatocytes were not observed. Our results suggest that serine supplementation could prevent HF diet-induced oxidative stress and steatosis by epigenetically modulating the expression of glutathione synthesis-related genes and through AMPK activation.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we used an acute inflammation model in which pigs were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and found that hepatic glycolysis and   oxidation are both promoted. Acetyl-proteome profiling of LPS-infected pigs  showed that inflammatory stress exacerbates the acetylation of mitochondrial proteins. Both mitochondrial glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 2 (GOT2) and malate dehydrogenase 2 (MDH2) were acetylated, and the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS) activity was stimulated to maintain glycolysis. With the use of C-carbon tracing in vitro, acetyl-CoA was found to be mainly supplied by lipid-derived   oxidation rather than glucose-derived pyruvate oxidative decarboxylation, while glucose was mainly used for lactate production in response to inflammatory stress. The results of the mitochondrial experiment showed that acetyl-CoA directly increases MDH2 and, in turn, the GOT2 acetylation level affects MAS activity. Treatment with palmitate in primary hepatocytes from LPS-injected pigs increased the hepatic production of acetyl-CoA, pyruvate, and lactate; MAS activity; and hepatic MDH2 and GOT2 hyperacetylation, while the deficiency of long-chain acetyl-CoA dehydrogenase resulted in the stabilization of these parameters. These observations suggest that acetyl-CoA produced by   oxidation promotes MAS activity and glycolysis via nonenzymatic acetylation during the inflammatory stress response.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29234397> plus  Synergistically Ameliorates Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis in HepG2 Cells.</a></h2><p>The combination of  and  radix is frequently prescribed for  diseases in TKM.

Therefore, we investigated the anti-NASH effects of the water extract of  (AI),  radix (CL), and combination of the two herbs (ACE). Hepatic steatosis and NASH were induced in HepG2 cells by treatment with  (PA, for 6 h) with/without pretreatment of ACE (25 or 50 g/mL), AI (50 or 100 g/mL), CL (50 or 100 g/mL), curcumin (5 g/mL), or scopoletin (5 g/mL). The PA treatment (200 M) drastically altered intracellular triglyceride levels, total cholesterol, and expression levels of genes related to lipid metabolism (CD36, SREBP1c, PPAR-, and PPAR-), whereas pretreatment with ACE significantly attenuated these alterations. ACE also protected HepG2 cells from PA- (300 M-) induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis and attenuated the related key molecules including GRP78, eIF2, and CHOP, respectively.

Therefore, there is a need for easier ways of diagnosing NASH. In this study, we investigated the serum   composition and evaluated the possibility of using the serum   composition as a diagnostic marker of NASH.The subjects were 78 NAFLD patients (non-alcoholic  [NAFL]: 30, NASH: 48) and 24 healthy individuals.  acids extracted from the  tissue and serum were identified and quantified by gas chromatography. In addition, we evaluated the relationship between serum and  tissue   composition, patient background, and  histology. The diagnostic performance of NASH was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC).The results of the   analysis showed the C16:1n7/C16:0 ratio to have the strongest correlation between serum and  tissue (r = 0.865, P < 0.0001). The serum C16:1n7/C16:0 ratio in the NASH group was higher compared with that in the NAFL group (P = 0.0007). Evaluation of the association of the serum C16:1n7/C16:0 ratio with  histology revealed significant correlation with lobular inflammation score, ballooning score, and fibrosis score. The AUROC for predicting NASH in all NAFLD patients was 0.7097.

For in vitro study, four experimental groups were designed by using HepG2 cells, including the control group,  (PA) treatment alone group, NACOS treatment alone group and NACOS + PA treatment group. For in vivo study, male C57BL/6 mice were divided into four groups (n=5) at random including the normal control group (NCD), high fat diet (HFD) group, NACOS treatment alone group, NACOS+HFD group, which were treated for 20 weeks. The used methods in this study were as follows: the observation of lipid droplet deposition in HepG2 cells by oil red O staining, the detection of mRNA levels of lipid metabolism-related regulators and inflammatory cytokine by RT-PCR method, the monitoring of MAPKs and PI3K/Akt pathway activation by Western blotting method. The in vitro study shows that, NACOS had no toxicity on the viability of HepG2 cells at 25-100 μg/mL and significantly reduced the deposition of lipid droplet. Also, based on both in vitro and in vivo investigation, NACOS evidently down-regulated the expression of lipid metabolism-related regulators (PGC1α, Cox5b, Mcad) and inflammatory cytokine (IL-1β) at mRNA level (P<0.05 or 0.01), and suppressed the activation of p38, ERK1/2 and Akt in HepG2 cells and lever tissues from HFD-fed mice (P<0.05 or 0.01).

However, the effects of relaxin-2 on hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in animals with non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) remain to be elucidated. C57BL/6 mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet were randomly assigned to receive recombinant human relaxin-2 (25 or 75 μg/kg/day) or vehicle for 4 weeks. In HFD-fed mice, relaxin-2 decreased systemic insulin resistance and reduced body weight, epididymal fat mass and serum leptin and insulin concentrations. In livers of HFD-fed mice, relaxin-2 attenuated steatosis and increased phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1, Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and activated genes that regulate   oxidation and suppressed acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Relaxin-2 had no direct anti-steatotic effect on primary mouse hepatocytes, but S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine attenuated -induced steatosis and activated genes regulating   oxidation in hepatocytes. In mice fed an MCD diet, relaxin-2 attenuated steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. Relaxin-2 increased eNOS and Akt phosphorylation and transcript levels of cytochrome P450-4a10 and decreased acetyl-CoA carboxylase in MCD-fed mouse livers. Moreover, expression levels of Kupffer cell activation, hepatic stellate cell activation and hepatocyte apoptosis were decreased in MCD diet-fed mice receiving relaxin-2. In conclusion, relaxin-2 reduces hepatic steatosis by activating intrahepatic eNOS in HFD-fed mice and further attenuates  fibrosis in MCD diet-fed mice.

Although the exact molecular pathway leading to impaired insulin signaling has not been definitively established, ceramides are suspected mediators of lipid induced hepatic insulin resistance. Therefore, the aim of the study was to evaluate the serum ceramides concentration in obese children with NAFLD.The prospective study included 80 obese children (aged 7-17 years, median 12 years) admitted to our Department to diagnose initially suspected  disease. Patients with viral hepatitis (HCV, HBV, CMV), autoimmune (AIH), toxic and metabolic (Wilson's disease, alfa-1-antitrypsin deficiency)  diseases and celiac disease were excluded. NAFLD was diagnosed based on pediatric diagnostic criteria in obese children with  steatosis in ultrasound (US) as well as elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) serum activity after exclusion of other major  diseases listed before. Ultrasonography was used as a screening method and for qualitative assessment of the steatosis degree (graded according to Saverymuttu scale). Advanced steatosis was defined as a score > 1. The total intrahepatic lipid content (TILC) was assessed by magnetic resonance proton spectroscopy (HMRS) which is the most accurate technique for assessment of ectopic fat accumulation. Fasting serum concentration of ceramides was measured in 62 children.NAFLD was diagnosed in 31 children. Significant, positive correlation was found between total serum concentration of ceramides and insulin (r = 0.3, p = 0.02) and HOMA-IR (r = 0.28, p = 0.03). Total ceramide concentration as well as specific  -ceramides (FA-ceramides) concentrations, namely: myristic, , palmitoleic, stearic, oleic, behenic and lignoceric were significantly higher (p = 0.004, p = 0.003, p = 0.007, p < 0.001, p = 0.035, p = 0.008, p = 0.003, p = 0.006, respectively) in children with NAFLD compared to controls (n = 14). Moreover, children with NAFLD had significantly higher activity of ALT (p < 0.001) and GGT (p < 0.001), HOMA-IR (p = 0.04), BMI (p = 0.046), waist circumference (p = 0.01) steatosis grade in ultrasound (p < 0.001) and TILC in HMRS (p < 0.001) compared to children without NAFLD. We did not find significant differences in total and FA-ceramide species concentrations between children with mild (grade 1) and advanced  steatosis in ultrasonography (grade 2-3).Elevated ceramide concentrations in obese patients together with their significant correlation with insulin resistance parameters suggest their association with molecular pathways involved in insulin signaling impairment known to be strongly linked to pathogenesis of non-alcoholic  disease.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30320914>Protein translation associated to PERK arm is a new target for regulation of metainflammation: A connection with hepatocyte cholesterol.</a></h2><p>Endoplasmic reticulum stress is a cellular phenomenon that has been associated with metabolic disorders, contributing to the development of obesity,  disease, and dyslipidemias. Under metabolic overload conditions, in cells with a high protein-secretory activity, such as hepatocytes and Langerhans β cells, the unfolded protein response (UPR) is critical in to maintain protein homeostasis (proteostasis). UPR integrated by a tripartite signaling system, through activating transcription factor 6, protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), and inositol-requiring enzyme 1, regulates gene transcription and translation to resolve stress and conserve proteostasis. In the current study, we demonstrated in hepatocytes under metabolic overload by saturated  and stearic  acids, through activation of PERK signaling and CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) transcription factor, an association with the expression of cyclooxygenase 2. More important, isolated exosomes from supernatants of macrophages exposed to lipopolysaccharides can also induce a metainflammation phenomenon, and when treated on hepatocytes, induced a rearrangement in cholesterol metabolism through sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2), low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), apolipoprotein A-I, and ABCA1. Moreover, we demonstrate the cellular effect of terpene-derived molecules, such as cryptotanshinone, isolated of plant Salvia brandegeei, regulating metainflammatory conditions through PERK pathway in both hepatocytes and β cells. Our data suggest the presence of a modulatory mechanism on specific protein translation process. This effect could be mediated by eukaryotic initiation factor-4A, evaluating salubrinal as a control molecule. Likewise, the protective mechanisms of unsaturated  acids, such as oleic and palmitoleic  were confirmed. Therefore, modulation of metainflammation suggests a new target through PERK signaling in cells with a high secretory activity, and possibly the regulation of cholesterol in hepatocytes is promoted via exosomes.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29607540>Melatonin improves insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis through attenuation of alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein.</a></h2><p>Melatonin plays an important role in regulating circadian rhythms. It also acts as a potent antioxidant and regulates glucose and lipid metabolism, although the exact action mechanism is not clear. The α2-HS-glycoprotein gene (AHSG) and its protein, fetuin-A (FETUA), are one of the hepatokines and are known to be associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine whether melatonin improves hepatic insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in a FETUA-dependent manner. In HepG2 cells treated with 300 μmol/L of , phosphorylated AKT expression decreased, and FETUA expression increased, but this effect was inhibited by treatment with 10 μmol/L of melatonin. However, melatonin did not improve insulin resistance in FETUA-overexpressing cells, indicating that improvement in insulin resistance by melatonin was dependent on downregulation of FETUA. Moreover, melatonin decreased -induced ER stress markers, CHOP, Bip, ATF-6, XBP-1, ATF-4, and PERK. In addition, in the high-fat diet (HFD) mice, oral treatment with 100 mg/kg/day melatonin for 10 weeks reduced body weight gain to one-third of that of the HFD group and hepatic steatosis. Insulin sensitivity and glucose intolerance improved with the upregulation of muscle p-AKT protein expression. FETUA expression and ER stress markers in the  and serum of HFD mice were decreased by melatonin treatment. In conclusion, melatonin can improve hepatic insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis through reduction in ER stress and the resultant AHSG expression.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Rabbits fed with a moderate -- Enriched Diet 3%  (FAED), were evaluated for body weight, biochemical parameters, and  function.  samples were analyzed by histology and RT-qPCR to measure lipid accumulation, the expression of inflammation-related genes IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, IL-18, COX-2, TNF-α, and TLR-4.

We show that hepatic steatosis is an early consequence of fat-enriched diets, and that it is accompanied by an immune response that exerts protective effects that prevent the development of metabolic disorders, such as overweight/obesity and metabolic syndrome. However, the excessive intake of  acids renders these mechanisms less efficient for delaying the start of metabolic alterations.

Lipid overload causing lipotoxicity and inflammation has been considered as an essential pathogenic factor. To correlate the lipid profiles with cellular lipotoxicity, we utilized  (C16:0)- and especially unprecedented palmitoleic  (C16:1)-induced lipid overload HepG2 cell models coupled with lipidomic technology involving labeling with stable isotopes. C16:0 induced inflammation and cell death, whereas C16:1 induced significant lipid droplet accumulation. Moreover, inhibition of de novo sphingolipid synthesis by myriocin (Myr) aggravated C16:0 induced lipoapoptosis. Lipid profiles are different in C16:0 and C16:1-treated cells. Stable isotope-labeled lipidomics elucidates the roles of specific  acids that affect lipid metabolism and cause lipotoxicity or lipid droplet formation.

Autophagy dysregulation is known to contribute to hepatic inflammatory injury. Hence, we investigated the regulatory effect of CXCL10 on the autophagosome-lysosome system during non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) development. The effect of CXCL10 ablation by neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) or genetic knockout on autophagic flux was evaluated in cultured hepatocytes and animal models of NAFLD. Results demonstrated that CXCL10 ablation protected against hepatocyte injury  and steatohepatitis development in mice. Autophagic flux impairment was rectified by CXCL10 inhibition using anti-CXCL10 mAb in AML-12 and HepG2  cell lines and primary hepatocytes as evidenced by the attenuated accumulation of p62/SQSTM1 and LC3-II proteins and increased autophagic protein degradation. Impaired autophagic flux was significantly restored by CXCL10 knockout or anti-CXCL10 mAb in mice. Bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of autolysosome formation, abolished the rectifying effect of anti-CXCL10 mAb or CXCL10 knockdown in AML-12 and primary hepatocytes, indicating CXCL10 impaired late-stage autophagy in NAFLD.

Herein, we discuss two pivotal aspects of the pathogenesis of NASH. We first analyse the initial mechanisms responsible for hepatocellular damage and inflammation, which derive from the toxic effects of excess lipids. Accumulating data indicate that the total amount of triglycerides stored in hepatocytes is not the major determinant of lipotoxicity, and that specific lipid classes act as damaging agents on  cells. In particular, the role of free  acids such as , cholesterol, lysophosphatidylcholine and ceramides has recently emerged. These lipotoxic agents affect the cell behaviour via multiple mechanisms, including activation of signalling cascades and death receptors, endoplasmic reticulum stress, modification of mitochondrial function, and oxidative stress. In the second part of this review, the cellular and molecular players involved in the cross-talk between the gut and the  are considered.

Free  acids (FFA) induce steatosis and lipo-toxicity and correlate with severity of NAFLD. In this study we aimed to investigate the role of exogenous and endogenous ALR (augmenter of  regeneration) for FFA induced ER (endoplasmatic reticulum) -stress and lipoapoptosis. Primary human hepatocytes or hepatoma cells either treated with recombinant human ALR (rhALR, 15kDa) or expressing short form ALR (sfALR, 15kDa) were incubated with  (PA) and analyzed for lipo-toxicity, -apoptosis, activation of ER-stress response pathways, triacylglycerides (TAG), mRNA and protein expression of lipid metabolizing genes. Both, exogenous rhALR and cytosolic sfALR reduced PA induced caspase 3 activity and Bax protein expression and therefore lipotoxicity. Endogenous sfALR but not rhALR treatment lowered TAG levels, diminished activation of ER-stress mediators C-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1) and proapoptotic transcription factor C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP), and reduced death receptor 5 protein expression. Cellular ALR exerts its lipid lowering and anti-apoptotic actions by enhancing FABP1, which binds toxic FFA, increasing mitochondrial β-oxidation by elevating the mitochondrial FFA transporter CPT1α, and decreasing ELOVL6, which delivers toxic FFA metabolites. We found reduced hepatic mRNA levels of ALR in a high fat diet mouse model, and of ALR and FOXA2, a transcription factor inducing ALR expression, in human steatotic as well as NASH  samples, which may explain increased lipid deposition and reduced β-oxidation in NASH patients. Present study shows that exogenous and endogenous ALR reduce PA induced lipoapoptosis. Furthermore, cytosolic sfALR changes mRNA and protein expression of genes regulating lipid metabolism, reduces ER-stress finally impeding progression of NASH.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30202233>Anticandidal activity of the extract and compounds isolated from  Rottb.</a></h2><p>The phytochemical screening of  showed that carbohydrates and/or glycosides, flavonoids, tannins, sterols and/or triterpenes, and proteins and/or amino acids are present.

In this study, we determined whether the depletion of TLR3 modulated hepatic injury in mice and further aimed to provide mechanistic insights into the TLR3-mediated modulation of diet-induced hepatic inflammation and fat accumulation. Hepatic steatosis and inflammatory response were induced by feeding wild-type (WT) or TLR3 knockout mice a high-fat diet for 8 weeks. Primary  resident cells, including hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), were treated with . TLR3 knockout mice fed a high-fat diet showed severe hepatic inflammation accompanied by nuclear factor-κB and IRF3 activation, which is mainly induced by the activation of Kupffer cells. Decreased TLR4 expression was restored in hepatic mononuclear cells and Kupffer cells in TLR3 knockout mice compared to that in the WT. Moreover, hepatic steatosis was decreased in TLR3 knockout mice. Hepatocytes from TLR3 knockout mice exhibited reduced expression of cannabinoid receptors. HSCs from TLR3 knockout mice showed decreased expression of the enzymes involved in endocannabinoid synthesis. In conclusion, this study suggests that the selective modulation of TLR3 could be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of hepatic inflammation and steatosis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AFLP is also recognized as an obstetric and medical emergency. Maternal AFLP is highly associated with a fetal homozygous mutation (1528G>C) in the gene that encodes for mitochondrial long-chain hydroxy acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD).

In this study, we investigated the effect of high-fat diet (HFD) on the development of experimental  in mice. Relative to mice fed low-fat diet (LFD), HFD feeding for 4 wk increased the levels of triglyceride, cholesterol, and free fatty acids in the plasma as well as within the colonic mucosa. In an experimental  model induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS), mice on 4-wk HFD exhibited more severe colonic inflammation and developed more severe  compared with the LFD counterparts. HFD feeding resulted in higher production of mucosal pro-inflammatory cytokines, greater activation of the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) tight junction regulatory pathway, and greater increases in mucosal barrier permeability in mice following TNBS induction. HFD feeding also induced gp91, an NADPH oxidase subunit, and promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in both colonic epithelial cells and lamina propria cells. In HCT116 cell culture,  or  and TNF-α combination markedly increased ROS production and induced the MLCK pathway, and these effects were markedly diminished in the presence of a ROS scavenger.

The underlying mechanism is that high-fat diet induces oxidative stress in the colonic mucosa, which increases colonic epithelial barrier permeability and drives colonic mucosal inflammation.

Although emerging evidence has suggested that ER calcium flux disruption in hepatocytes is involved in NAFLD pathogenesis, the roles of  acids in autophagy and ER calcium flux still remain unclear. We demonstrated that oleic  ameliorated -induced autophagy arrest and ER stress in parallel with ER calcium depletion in hepatocytes. Moreover, we found that the effect of oleic  against autophagy arrest was reversed by the pharmacological inhibition of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA), which influxes calcium to ER.

Hydroxyhydroquinone (HHQ) impairs the vasodilatory and antihypertensive effects of CGAs by reducing nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. Since HHQ also reduces fat catabolism, we hypothesized that HHQ does so by decreasing NO availability. Therefore, we investigated the effect of HHQ on energy metabolism in KKAy mice. In HHQ-treated mice, fat oxidation was significantly low and dose-dependent, serum and urinary hydrogen peroxide were high, and plasma NO metabolites and S-nitrosylated  proteins were low. In HHQ-treated mouse hepatocytes, the palmitate-induced increase in cellular oxygen consumption was negatively affected, and HHQ or L-NAME reduced cellular   utilization. In conclusion, HHQ can impair fat utilization by reducing NO availability in mice.

On the other hand, trace elements function as essential cofactors that are involved in various biochemical processes in mammals, including metabolic homeostasis. Notably, clinical and animal studies suggest that the plasma levels of bromide negatively correlate with those of TG, total cholesterol (TC) and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C). However, the effect of bromide on lipid accumulation and the direct molecular target responsible for its action remains unknown. Oil red O (ORO) and Nile red staining were used to detect the effect of bromide on lipid accumulation in mouse primary hepatocytes (PHs) treated with different doses of sodium bromide (NaBr) in the presence of FFAs (0.4 mM oleate/ 1:1). Spectrophotometric and fluorometric analyses were performed to assess cellular TG concentrations and rates of   oxidation (FAO), respectively, in mouse PHs. We found that bromide decreased FFA-induced lipid accumulation and increased FFA-inhibited oxygen consumptions in mouse PHs in a dose-dependent manner via activation of PPARα. Mechanical studies demonstrated that bromide decreased the phosphorylation levels of JNK. More importantly, the PPARα-specific inhibitor GW6471 partially abolished the beneficial effects of bromide on mouse PHs. Bromide alleviates FFA-induced excessive lipid storage and increases rates of FAO through the activation of PPARα/JNK signals in mouse PHs.

Palmitate-induced ROS generation in human CD68CD14 macrophages is strongly suppressed by inhibition of dynamin.

As a consequence of anti-ER stress, the activation of ACE2 led to improved glucose and lipid metabolism through the IKKβ/NFκB/IRS1/Akt pathway.This is the first time documented that ACE2 had a notable alleviating role in ER stress-induced hepatic steatosis and glucose metabolism via the IKKβ/NFκB/IRS1/Akt-mediated pathway. This study may further provide insight into a novel underlying mechanism and a strategy for treating NAFLD.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31139863>Skeletal muscle miR-34a/SIRT1:AMPK axis is activated in experimental and human non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis associates with intramyocellular lipid deposition and mitochondrial dysfunction. microRNAs (miRs), including pro-apoptotic miR-34a, are modulated during disease progression in  tissue and plasma. We aimed to investigate the functional role of the miR-34a/SIRT1:AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway in modulating local mitochondrial dysfunction in the skeletal muscle of human and experimental non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Muscle biopsies were obtained from morbid obese NAFLD patients undergoing bariatric surgery. C57BL/6N mice were fed different NAFLD-inducing diets and C2C12 muscle cells incubated with  (PA) in the presence or absence of an AMPK activator, or upon miR-34a functional modulation. Several muscle miRNAs, including miR-34a, were found increased with human NAFLD progression. Activation of the miR-34a/SIRT1:AMPK pathway, concomitant with impairment in insulin signalling mediators and deregulation of mitochondrial-shaping proteins, was evident in C2C12 cells incubated with PA, as well as in the skeletal muscle of all three diet-induced NAFLD mice models. Functional studies established the association between miR-34a- and PA-induced muscle cell deregulation. Of note, activation of AMPK almost completely prevented miR-34a- and PA-induced cellular stress. In addition, the miR-34a/SIRT1:AMPK pathway and mitochondrial dynamics dysfunction were also found amplified in muscle of human NAFLD. Finally, muscle miR-34a expression and mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) protein levels correlated with hallmarks of NAFLD and disease progression. Our results indicate that activation of the miR-34a/SIRT1:AMPK pathway leads to mitochondrial dynamics dysfunction in skeletal muscle of human and experimental NAFLD, representing an appealing prospective target in metabolic syndrome. KEY MESSAGES: Skeletal muscle microRNAs are modulated during NAFLD progression. -induced muscle cell dysfunction occurs, at least in part, through activation of the miR-34a/SIRT1:AMPK pathway. miR-34a/SIRT1:AMPK activation associates with mitochondria dynamics dysfunction in human NAFLD.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161349>Moderate chronic ethanol consumption exerts beneficial effects on nonalcoholic  in mice fed a high-fat diet: possible role of higher formation of triglycerides enriched in monounsaturated  acids.</a></h2><p>Several clinical studies suggested that light-to-moderate alcohol intake could alleviate nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD), but the underlying mechanism is still poorly understood.Mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) were submitted or not to moderate ethanol intake for 3 months (ca. 10 g/kg/day) via drinking water. Biochemical, analytical and transcriptomic analyses were performed in serum and .Serum ethanol concentrations in ethanol-treated HFD mice comprised between 0.5 and 0.7 g/l throughout the experiment. NAFLD improvement was observed in ethanol-treated HFD mice as assessed by reduced serum transaminase activity. This was associated with less microvesicular and more macrovacuolar steatosis, the absence of apoptotic hepatocytes and a trend towards less fibrosis.  lipid analysis showed increased amounts of  acids incorporated in triglycerides and phospholipids, reduced proportion of  in total lipids and higher desaturation index, thus suggesting enhanced stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase activity. mRNA expression of several glycolytic and lipogenic enzymes was upregulated. Genome-wide expression profiling and gene set enrichment analysis revealed an overall downregulation of the expression of genes involved in collagen fibril organization and leukocyte chemotaxis and an overall upregulation of the expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial respiratory chain complex assembly. In addition, mRNA expression of several proteasome subunits was upregulated in ethanol-treated HFD mice.Moderate chronic ethanol consumption may alleviate NAFLD by several mechanisms including the generation of non-toxic lipid species, reduced expression of profibrotic and proinflammatory genes, restoration of mitochondrial function and possible stimulation of proteasome activity.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31355732>-Enriched Diet Induces Hepatic Steatosis and Injury in Adult Zebrafish.</a></h2><p> (PA) is the most abundant saturated   in fast foods and is known to induce inflammation and cellular injury in various tissues. In this study, we investigated whether a PA-enriched diet can induce hepatic steatosis and injury in adult zebrafish. The adult zebrafish exhibited increased body weight, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, and steatosis and a hepatic injury phenotype after being fed with a PA-enriched diet for 6 weeks. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that genes associated with hepatic injury were all significantly increased in the . Furthermore, livers from the PA-fed group showed an increased messenger RNA (mRNA) expression associated with oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses. We also found significant upregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism and triacylglyceride accumulation. Ultrastructural analysis revealed mitochondrial cristae injury and a dilated ER phenotype in the PA-fed hepatocytes, which can be causes of hepatic injury. PA-enriched diet induced hepatic steatosis and injury in adult zebrafish that recapitulated typical metabolic changes and pathophysiological changes as well as increased oxidative stress and ER stress observed in patients with nonalcoholic  disease.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572539>Apigenin reduces the excessive accumulation of lipids induced by  via the AMPK signaling pathway in HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to diseases caused by excessive accumulation of lipids in the  with therapeutic agents derived from natural products offering an alternative treatment to conventional therapies. Among these therapeutic agents, apigenin, a natural flavonoid, has been proven to exert various beneficial biological effects. In the present study, the antiadipogenic effects of apigenin in HepG2 cells was investigated. It was demonstrated that the treatment of cells with different concentrations of apigenin for 24 h significantly decreased the -induced increases in total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels as well as intracellular lipid accumulation. In addition, apigenin increased the phosphorylated-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) levels but decreased the expression levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1,   synthase, and SREBP-2 in a concentration-dependent manner.

In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which NAFLD-HCC survives in a fat-rich environment. We found that caveolin (CAV)-1 was overexpressed in clinical specimens from NAFLD-HCC patients. HepG2, HLE, and HuH-7 HCC cell lines showed decreased proliferation in the presence of the saturated  acids  and stearic , although only HLE cells expressed high levels of CAV-1. HLE cells treated with oleic  (OA) showed robust proliferation, whereas CAV-null HepG2 cells showed reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis. CAV-1 knockdown in HLE cells attenuated the OA-induced increase in proliferation and enhanced apoptosis. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the levels of OA-containing ceramide, a pro-apoptotic factor, were higher in HepG2 and CAV-1-deficient HLE cells than in HLE cells, suggesting that CAV-1 inhibits apoptosis by decreasing the level of OA-containing ceramide. These results indicate that CAV-1 is important for NAFLD-HCC survival in  -rich environments and is a potential therapeutic target.© 2018 The Authors.

Older men (n = 5, age 68.0 ± 4.6 years) and postmenopausal women (n = 7, age 60.9 ± 3.1 years) were assigned randomly to consume ground-beef containing 18% total fat (18F) or 25% total fat (25F), five patties per week for 5 weeks with an intervening 4-week washout period. The 25F and 18F ground-beef increased (p < 0.05) the intake of saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, , and stearic , but the 25F ground-beef increased only the intake of oleic  (p < 0.05). The ground-beefs 18F and 25F increased the plasma concentration of  (p < 0.05) and decreased the plasma concentrations of arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenic acids (p < 0.05). The interventions of 18F and 25F ground-beef decreased very low-density lipoprotein C concentrations and increased particle diameters and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-I-C and LDL-II-C concentrations (p < 0.05). The ground-beef 25F decreased PBMC mRNA levels for the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding cassette A, ATP binding cassette G1, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1, and LDL receptor (LDLR) (p < 0.05). The ground-beef 18F increased mRNA levels for stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (p < 0.05). We conclude that the increased LDL particle size and LDL-I-C and LDL-II-C concentrations following the 25F ground-beef intervention may have been caused by decreased hepatic LDLR gene expression.© 2018 AOCS.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p></html>
