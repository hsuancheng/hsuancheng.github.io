Rose hips have long been used to treat kidney stones, gastroenteric ailments, hypertension and respiratory problems such as bronchitis, cough and cold.This review is focused on the ethnopharmacological uses of rose hip as well as phytochemical and pharmacological aspects.Ethno-medical uses of rose hip have been recorded in many countries since a long time. Approximately, 129 chemical compounds have been isolated and identified from rose hip. This fruit contains some major active components such as flavonoids, tannins, anthocyanin, phenolic compounds, fatty oil, organic acids and inorganic compounds. Scientific studies have suggested a wide range of pharmacological activities for rose hip including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-obesity, anti-cancer, hepatoprotective, nephroprotective, cardioprotective, antiaging, anti H. pylori, neuroprotective and antinociceptive activities. In particular, the rose hip powder and extract have been reported to exert therapeutic effects on arthritis.Some of the ethnomedical indications of rose hip, such as nephroprotective and gastroproetctive actions, have been confirmed by preclinical pharmacological studies. Additional investigations on the pharmacological effects of rose hip as well as evidence from randomized controlled trials are essential to assess the therapeutic value of this natural product.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29552860>[Protective effects of total saponins of Panax japonicas on HepG2 cell apoptosis induced with ].</a></h2><p>This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism and protective effect of total saponins of Panax japonicas (TSPJ) on HepG2 cells apoptosis induced by  (PA).The HepG2 cells were cultured , and divided into five groups: the control group, the model group, the high-dose group (50 mg·L⁻¹), the middle-dose group (25 mg·L⁻¹) and the low-dose group (12.5 mg·L⁻¹).The cells of the five groups were cultured continuously for 24 hours. The cell viability was measured with MTT. HepG2 cells apoptosis was detected by Hoechest staining and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining. The protein expressions of BCL-2, CHOP and TLR4 were measured with western blotting and flow cytometry analysis. The mRNA expressions of TNF-α, IL-1β, BCL-2, CHOP and GAPDH were measured with RT-PCR. The results suggested that compared with the control group, the number of HepG2 cells of the model group were reduced significantly (<0.01), while the number of apoptotic HepG2 cells were increased. Compared with the model group, the number of HepG2 cells of the high-dose group and the middle-dose group were increased significantly (<0.01), whereas the number of apoptotic HepG2 cells were reduced. Compared with the control group, TNF-α, IL-1β and CHOP mRNA expressions and CHOP and TLR4 protein expressions in the model group were significantly up-regulated (<0.01), while BCL-2 protein and mRNA expressions in the model group were significantly decreased (<0.01). Compared with the model group, TNF-α, IL-1β and CHOP mRNA expressions and CHOP and TLR4 protein expressions in the high-dose group were significantly decreased (<0.01), while BCL-2 protein and mRNA expressions in the high-dose group were significantly up-regulated (<0.01).In conclusion, TSPJ can reduce  and apoptosis induced by , with a certain protective effect on liver cells.Copyright© by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848861>Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Inhibit IL-17A Secretion through Decreased ICAM-1 Expression in T Cells Co-Cultured with Adipose-Derived Stem Cells Harvested from Adipose Tissues of Obese Subjects.</a></h2><p>Obese adipose tissue (AT) is infiltrated by inflammatory immune cells including IL-17A-producing-T (Th17) cells. It has been previously demonstrated that adipose-derived stem cells from obese (ob-ASCs), but not lean AT promote Th17 cells. Because n-3 PUFAs are known to inhibit obese AT , it is tested here whether they could inhibit ob-ASC-mediated IL-17A secretion.The n-3 PUFA precursor, alpha-linolenic  (ALA), or its derivatives, eicosapentaenoic, or docosahexaenoic , is added to co-cultures of human ob-ASCs and mononuclear cells (MNCs). All three inhibited IL-17A, but not IL-1β, IL-6, nor TNFα  secretion. As a control,  (PA), a saturated fatty , did not inhibit IL-17A secretion. ALA also inhibited IL-17A secretion mediated by adipocytes differentiated from ob-ASCs. Toll-like-receptor 4 is shown to be involved in ob-ASC-mediated-IL-17A secretion, and to be inhibited by ALA, together with Cyclo-Oxygenase-2 and Signal-Transducer-and-Activator-of-transcription-3. In addition, ALA down-regulated Intercellular-Adhesion-Molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression in both monocytes and ASCs, which resulted in decreased interactions between ob-ASCs and MNCs, and inhibition of IL-17A secretion.It is demonstrated herein that ALA inhibits Th17 cell promotion, through decreased ICAM-1expression in both ob-ASCs and monocytes. This novel mechanism may contribute to explain the beneficial effects of n-3 PUFA in IL-17A-related inflammatory pathologies.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Experimental confounders and context-specificity.</a></h2><p>Based primarily on cell culture results, saturated fatty acids (SFAs) are proposed to promote  and contribute to metabolic dysfunction through Toll-like receptor activation. Studies are often complicated by a requirement for carriers (e.g., BSA) or solvents (e.g., ethanol) to increase SFA solubility. To ascertain whether these factors influence interpretations of SFA-associated  activity, we measured responses of RAW264.7 monocyte/macrophages and CC myotubes to various BSA, ethanol, and cyclodextrin (alternative FA carrier) conditions. Fatty -free, low-endotoxin BSA preparations (0.33% to 2% wt/vol) activated whereas 0.5-1.0% ethanol inhibited RAW264.7 TNFα release. Ethanol modestly increased IL-6 secretion in CC myotubes. Cyclodextrins (0.3-6.0 mM) were tested as alternative carriers of palmitate, but their usefulness was limited due to toxicity and solubility issues. Using a lower- BSA source and no ethanol, ∼24-h sodium palmitate treatment (≤600 µM) failed to trigger RAW264.7 TNFα release and, in fact, significantly dampened BSA-induced  by >50%. In CC myotubes, only high palmitate concentrations (500-600 µM) elicited IL-6 secretion (>2.5-fold increase). Acute palmitate (200 or 500 µM) treatment did not activate MAP kinase pathways above that of fresh BSA-containing media alone in either cell type. These results highlight the importance of experimental conditions in studies exploring SFA  effects. The limited (or even anti-inflammatory) effects of palmitate that we observed indicate that immunomodulatory effects of SFAs are context-specific. Thus, caution is needed when interpreting the literature related to putative proinflammatory effects of SFA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30466091>Irisin Ameliorates Glucolipotoxicity-Associated β-Cell Dysfunction and Apoptosis via AMPK Signaling and Anti-Inflammatory Actions.</a></h2><p>Islet metabolic disorder and  contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Irisin is a recently identified adipomyokine with protective effects on metabolic homeostasis and -suppressing effects in hepatic and vascular cells. The present study examined the effects of irisin on lipid metabolism and  in β cells under glucolipotoxic conditions.Rat INS-1E β cells and islets isolated from C57BL/6 mice were incubated in glucolipotoxic conditions with or without irisin. Intracellular lipid contents and lipogenic gene expression were determined by enzymatic colorimetric assays and real-time PCR, respectively. Inflammatory status was evidenced by Western blot analysis for the phosphorylation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 and real-time PCR analysis for the expression of pro-inflammatory genes.Irisin reversed glucolipotoxicity-induced intracellular non-esterified fatty  (NEFA) and triglyceride accumulation, suppressed associated elevations in lipogenic gene expression, and phosphorylated acetyl-CoA-carboxylase (ACC) in INS-1E cells. These demonstrated effects were dependent on irisin-activated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Meanwhile, AMPK signaling mediated the protective effects of irisin on INS-1E cell insulin secretory ability and survival as well. Additionally, irisin inhibited phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 while decreasing the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in INS-1E cells under glucolipotoxic conditions. Moreover, irisin also improved insulin secretion, inhibited apoptosis, and restored β-cell function-related gene expression in isolated mouse islets under glucolipotoxic conditions.Irisin attenuated excessive lipogenesis in INS-1E cells under glucolipotoxic state through activation of AMPK. Irisin also suppressed overnutrition-induced  in INS-1E cells. Our findings implicate irisin as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of islet lipid metabolic disorder and islet  in T2DM.© 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.

The present study was designed to investigate the effects and underlying mechanisms of ginsenoside Rg1 (G-Rg1) treatment on NAFLD . HepG2 cells were treated with  (PA) to induce steatosis and  and then successively incubated with G-Rg1. Lipids accumulation was analyzed by Oil Red O staining and intracellular triglyceride (TG) quantification. Inflammatory conditions were examined by quantifying the levels of cell supernatant alanine transaminase/aspartate aminotransferase (ALT/AST) and secretory proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, and TNF- in the cell supernatants. Quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting were used to measure the expressions of genes and proteins associated with lipogenic synthesis and , including AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) pathways. HepG2 cells were pretreated with an AMPK inhibitor; then, Oil Red O staining and TG quantification were performed to study the lipid deposition. Phospho-AMPK (Thr172) (p-AMPK) and phospho-acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Ser79) (p-ACC) were quantified by immunoblotting. Immunofluorescence was performed to demonstrate the nuclear translocation of NF-B P65. The present study showed that PA markedly increased the intracellular lipid droplets accumulation and TG levels, but decreased AMPK phosphorylation and the expressions of its downstream lipogenic genes. However, G-Rg1 alleviated hepatic steatosis and reduced the intracellular TG content; these changes were accompanied by the activation of the AMPK pathway. In addition, blocking AMPK by using the AMPK inhibitor markedly abolished the G-Rg1-mediated protection against PA-induced lipid deposition in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, G-Rg1 reduced the ALT/AST levels and proinflammatory cytokines release, which were all enhanced by PA. These effects were correlated with the inactivation of the NF-B pathway and translocation of P65 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Overall, these results suggest that G-Rg1 effectively ameliorates hepatic steatosis and , which might be associated with the AMPK/NF-B pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31405384>Preliminary evidence for reduced adipose tissue inflammation in vegetarians compared with omnivores.</a></h2><p>There are links between obesity and inflammation that may relate activation of pro-inflammatory pathways by dietary factors. Because dietary fat intake of vegetarians is thought to be more beneficial than that of omnivores, we hypothesized that obese vegetarians would have less adipose tissue inflammation and lower intramyocellular ceramide concentrations than equally obese omnivores.Eight obese vegetarian (1 male) and 8 obese omnivore volunteers (1 male) completed a Food Frequency Questionnaire, underwent body composition measures, subcutaneous adipose tissue and muscle biopsies. We used immunohistochemistry to measure adipose macrophage (ATM) and senescent cells. Plasma free fatty  (FFA), adipose FA and muscle ceramide profiles were measured using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Student t tests were used for the comparison of primary outcomes; univariate regression analysis was used to test for associations between dietary patterns and ATMs (secondary analysis).There were no differences in age (38 ± 8 vs. 39 ± 8 years), BMI (32.2 ± 2.6 vs. 33.3 ± 1.9 kg/m) or percent body fat (44 ± 8 vs. 45 ± 4) between the vegetarians and omnivores. Vegetarians consumed 42% (P = 0.02) less saturated fat and 50% (P = 0.04) less cholesterol than the omnivores. Plasma FFA of vegetarians had lesser proportions of  (24 ± 3 vs. 29 ± 4%, P = 0.02) and vegetarians had fewer femoral pro-inflammatory ATMs than omnivores (3.6 ± 2.8 vs. 7.9 ± 4.4 per 100 adipocytes, respectively; P = 0.02). Omnivores had 50% greater (P = 0.01) expression of TNF mRNA in abdominal fat. We found no significant between group differences in muscle ceramide concentrations.Although the sample size is small, these results may indicate that dietary patterns play a role in adipose tissue inflammation, as reflected by reduced number of femoral ATMs in obese vegetarians than obese omnivores.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29730133>Cytotoxic effect of Kalanchoe flammea and induction of intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic signaling in prostate cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Kalanchoe flammea Stapf (Crassulaceae) is a medicinal plant grown in the South of Mexico (State of Tabasco), which is commonly used in traditional medicine for the treatment of fever, wounds, , and cancer.To establish the potential of K. flammea for the treatment of prostate cancer, evaluating its cytotoxic activity, its probable mechanism of action, and carrying out some toxicological safety studies.The cytotoxic activity of the ethyl acetate extract of K. flammea (Kf-EtOAc) was evaluated in several cell lines of prostate cancer by MTT viability assay. The cellular death mechanism was studied by evaluating the translocation of phosphatidylserine (Annexin V); overproduction of reactive oxygen species [2'-7'-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay]; release of Cytochrome C; activation of caspase-3 and -9, and regulation of Bcl-2, XIAP, and PKCε proteins by Western Blot analysis. For the evaluation of the safety of Kf-EtOAc, the Ames test, Micronucleus assay, and acute toxicity study were determined.Kf-EtOAc exhibited selective cytotoxic activity against prostate cell lines as follows: PC-3, LNCaP, and PrEC (IC = 1.36 ± 0.05; 2.06 ± 0.02, and 127.05 ± 0.07 μg/mL, respectively). The F82-P2 fraction (rich in coumaric  and ) obtained by bioassay-guided fractionation of Kf-EtOAc also demonstrated selective cytotoxic activity against PC-3 cells (IC = 1.05 ± 0.06 μg/mL). Kf-EtOAc induces apoptosis by the intrinsic pathway; this mechanism of cell death was confirmed after observing that the extract produces phosphatidylserine translocation, overproduction of reactive oxygen species, release of Cytochrome C at mitochondrial level, and activation of caspase-3 and -9. It was also observed that Kf-EtOAc produces significant downregulation of apoptosis-related proteins Bcl-2, XIAP, and PKCε and induces DNA fragmentation and cell cycle arrest. In addition, Kf-EtOAc is non-genotoxic in vitro by Ames test and non-genotoxic in vivo by Micronucleus assay, and no signs of toxicity or death were reported after the administration of a single acute exposure of 2000 mg/kg.K. flammea is a potential candidate for the development of new drugs for the treatment of prostate cancer. However, to propose their use in clinical trials, additional studies are required to understand their pharmacokinetic behavior, as well as the development of a suitable pharmaceutical form.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Its biological actions are primarily mediated by PPAR-α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors α) and the orphan receptor GPR55. Palmitoylethanolamide exerts potent anti-inflammatory actions but its physiological role and promise as a therapeutic agent in chronic arterial , such as atherosclerosis remain unexplored. Approach and Results- First, the polarization of mouse primary macrophages towards a proinflammatory phenotype was found to reduce N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D expression and palmitoylethanolamide bioavailability. N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D expression was progressively downregulated in the aorta of apolipoprotein E deficient (ApoE) mice during atherogenesis. N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D mRNA levels were also downregulated in unstable human plaques and they positively associated with smooth muscle cell markers and negatively with macrophage markers. Second, ApoE mice were fed a high-fat diet for 4 or 16 weeks and treated with either vehicle or palmitoylethanolamide (3 mg/kg per day, 4 weeks) to study the effects of palmitoylethanolamide on early established and pre-established atherosclerosis. Palmitoylethanolamide treatment reduced plaque size in early atherosclerosis, whereas in pre-established atherosclerosis, palmitoylethanolamide promoted signs of plaque stability as evidenced by reduced macrophage accumulation and necrotic core size, increased collagen deposition and downregulation of M1-type macrophage markers. Mechanistically, we found that palmitoylethanolamide, by activating GPR55, increases the expression of the phagocytosis receptor MerTK (proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase MER) and enhances macrophage efferocytosis, indicative of proresolving properties. Conclusions- The present study demonstrates that palmitoylethanolamide protects against atherosclerosis by promoting an anti-inflammatory and proresolving phenotype of lesional macrophages, representing a new therapeutic approach to resolve arterial .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719005>The Distinct Effects of  and Oleic  on Pancreatic Beta Cell Function: The Elucidation of Associated Mechanisms and Effector Molecules.</a></h2><p>In this study, we aimed to identify the mechanisms underlying the different effects of  and oleic  on human pancreatic beta cell function. To address this problem, the oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, , apoptosis and their mediator molecules have been investigated in the insulin releasing beta cells exposed to  and/or oleic . Herein, we have demonstrated that in cultured 1.1B4 beta cells oleic  promotes neutral lipid accumulation and insulin secretion, whereas  is poorly incorporated into triglyceride and it does not stimulate insulin secretion from human pancreatic islets at physiologically glucose concentrations. In addition,  caused:  oxidative stress through a mechanism involving increases in ROS production and MMP-2 protein expression/gelatinolytic activity associated with down-regulation of SOD2 protein;  endoplasmic reticulum stress by up-regulation of chaperone BiP protein and unfolded protein response (UPR) transcription factors (eIF2α, ATF6, XBP1u proteins) and by PTP-1B down-regulation in both mRNA and protein levels;   through enhanced synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines (IL6, IL8 proteins); and  apoptosis by enforced proteic expression of CHOP multifunctional transcription factor. Oleic  alone had opposite effects due to its different capacity of controlling these metabolic pathways, in particular by reduction of the ROS levels and MMP-2 activity, down-regulation of BiP, eIF2α, ATF6, XBP1u, CHOP, IL6, IL8 and by SOD2 and PTP-1B overexpression. The supplementation of saturated  with the monounsaturated oleic  reversed the negative effects of  alone regulating insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells through ROS, MMP-2, ATF6, XBP1u, IL8 reduction and SOD2, PTP-1B activation. Our findings have shown the protective action of oleic  against  on beta cell lipotoxicity through promotion of triglyceride accumulation and insulin secretion and regulation of some effector molecules involved in oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress,  and apoptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30028518>Multi-omics analysis points to altered platelet functions in severe food-associated respiratory allergy.</a></h2><p>Prevalence and severity of allergic diseases have increased worldwide. To date, respiratory allergy phenotypes are not fully characterized and, along with  progression, treatment is increasingly complex and expensive. Profilin sensitization constitutes a good model to study the progression of allergic . Our aim was to identify the underlying mechanisms and the associated biomarkers of this progression, focusing on severe phenotypes, using transcriptomics and metabolomics.Twenty-five subjects were included in the study. Plasma samples were analyzed using gas and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS and LC-MS, respectively). Individuals were classified in four groups-"nonallergic," "mild," "moderate," and "severe"-based on their clinical history, their response to an oral challenge test with profilin, and after a refinement using a mathematical metabolomic model. PBMCs were used for microarray analysis.We found a set of transcripts and metabolites that were specific for the "severe" phenotype. By metabolomics, a decrease in carbohydrates and pyruvate and an increase in lactate were detected, suggesting aerobic glycolysis. Other metabolites were incremented in "severe" group: lysophospholipids, sphingosine-1-phosphate, sphinganine-1-phosphate, and lauric, myristic, , and oleic fatty acids. On the other hand, carnitines were decreased along severity. Significant transcripts in the "severe" group were found to be downregulated and were associated with platelet functions, protein synthesis, histone modification, and fatty  metabolism.We have found evidence that points to the association of severe allergic  with platelet functions alteration, together with reduced protein synthesis, and switch of immune cells to aerobic glycolysis.© 2018 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

The current study aimed to investigate the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 5 (MKP-5) in islet cells under glucolipotoxic conditions. Using gene overexpression and knockdown approaches, we demonstrated that MKP-5 could alleviate glucolipotoxicity-induced apoptosis via the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial apoptosis pathways owing to the altered regulation of caspase family members and ER stress-related molecules in MIN6 and primary islet cells. Overexpression of MKP-5 reversed the glucose and  (GP)-induced impairment of insulin secretion as well as the abnormal decreases in the expression of islet functional genes, thereby maintaining the normal insulin secretory functionality, whereas the absence of MKP-5 aggravated islet cell dysfunction. In parallel, the production of ROS and increased -associated genes in response to GP were also reduced upon MKP-5 overexpression. Further, inhibition of JNK or P38 MAPK pathways resisted to glucolipotoxicity observed in MKP-5 knockdown MIN6 cells. These findings indicate that MKP-5 is an important mediator for glucolipotoxicity-induced islet cell dysfunction and apoptosis, with JNK and P38 as the critical downstream pathways.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Emerging evidence highlights the importance of directly elucidating T-cell activation under the obesity-induced metabolic stress condition, as T cells primed under such conditions were found to acquire a unique phenotype and function. Herein, we found a significant upregulation of signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family member 3 (SLAMF3) expression on T cells from T2D patients compared to those of healthy controls. Importantly, SLAMF3 upregulation was associated with an increased ability to produce proinflammatory cytokines. Significantly increased SLAMF3 expression was seen in T2D patient T cells that produce IFN-γ or IL-17 upon short (4-h) stimulation, compared to non-cytokine-producing T cells. In line with this finding, SLAMF3 T cells were significantly more sensitive than SLAMF3 T cells to TCR stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies. Furthermore, treatment with  (PA) led to significant upregulation of SLAMF3 on human T cells primed by anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies and on Jurkat cells, a human T-cell line. RNA sequencing revealed strong activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in T cells that were primed with PA. Further mechanistic studies showed that inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling, or its upstream mediator STAT5 can prevent PA-induced SLAMF3 upregulation on T cells. These results indicate that SLAMF3 upregulation is associated with T-cell activation and cytokine production in T2D patients, and suggest that elevated saturated fatty acids in T2D patients may induce SLAMF3 upregulation on T cells via activation of the STAT5-PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30788050>Nicotinamide riboside regulates  and mitochondrial markers in AML12 hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>The NAD precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR) is a type of vitamin B found in cow's milk and yeast-containing food products such as beer.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of NR on  and mitochondrial biogenesis in AML12 mouse hepatocytes.A subset of hepatocytes was treated with  (PA; 250 µM) for 48 h to induce hepatocyte steatosis. The hepatocytes were treated with NR (10 µM and 10 mM) for 24 h with and without PA. The cell viability and the levels of sirtuins, inflammatory markers, and mitochondrial markers were analyzed.Cytotoxicity of NR was examined by PrestoBlue assay. Exposure to NR had no effect on cell viability or morphology. Gene expression of sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) and Sirt3 was significantly upregulated by NR in PA-treated hepatocytes. However, Sirt1 activities were increased in hepatocytes treated with low-dose NR. Hepatic pro-inflammatory markers including tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 were decreased in NR-treated cells. NR upregulated anti-inflammatory molecule adiponectin, and, tended to down-regulate hepatokine fetuin-A in PA-treated hepatocytes, suggesting its inverse regulation on these cytokines. NR increased levels of mitochondrial markers including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, uncoupling protein 2, transcription factor A, mitochondrial and mitochondrial DNA in PA-treated hepatocytes.These data demonstrated that NR attenuated hepatic  and increased levels of mitochondrial markers in hepatocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939862>Molecular Targets of Fatty  Ethanolamides in Asthma.</a></h2><p>Asthma is a common allergic pathology of the respiratory tract that requires the study of mechanisms underlying it, due to severe forms of the disease, which are refractory to therapy. The review is devoted to the search for molecular targets of fatty  ethanolamides in asthma, in particular palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), which has been successfully used in the treatment of chronic inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases, in the pathogenesis of which the nervous and immune systems are involved. Recently, the potentially important role of neuro-immune interactions in the development of allergic reactions has been established. Many of the clinical symptoms accompanying allergic airway  are the result of the activation of neurons in the airways, so the attention of researchers is currently focused on neuro-immune interactions, which can play an important role in asthma pathophysiology. A growing number of scientific works confirm that the key molecule in the implementation of these inter-systemic interactions is nerve growth factor (NGF). In addition to its classic role in nervous system physiology, NGF is considered as an important factor associated with the pathogenesis of allergic diseases, particularly asthma, by regulating of mast cell differentiation. In this regard, NGF can be one of the targets of PEA in asthma therapy.

Natural products are an alternative source of new compounds with anti-inflammatory activity. Jefea gnaphalioides (Astereaceae) (A. Gray) is a plant species used to treat inflammatory problems, in Mexico. This study determined the anti-inflammatory activity and the composition of the methanol extract of Jefea gnaphalioides (MEJG).The extract was obtained by heating the plant in methanol at boiling point for 4 h, and then the solvent was evaporated under vacuum (MEJG). The derivatization of the extract was performed using Bis-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide, and the composition was determined by GC-MS. Total Phenols and flavonoids were determined by Folin-Ciocalteu AlCl reaction respectively. The antioxidant activity of MEJG was determined by DPPH method. The acute and chronic anti-inflammatory effects were evaluated on a mouse ear edema induced with 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Acute oral toxicity was tested in mice at doses of MEJG of 5000, 2500 and 1250 mg/kg. The levels of NO, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 were determinate in J774A.1 macrophages stimulated by Lipopolysaccharide. The production of inflammatory interleukins was measured using commercial kits, and nitric oxide was measured by the Griess reaction.The anti-inflammatory activity of MEJG in acute TPA-induced ear edema was 80.7 ± 2.8%. This result was similar to the value obtained with indomethacin (IND) at the same dose (74.3 ± 2.8%). In chronic TPA-induced edema at doses of 200 mg/kg, the inhibition was 45.7%, which was similar to that obtained with IND (47.4%). MEJG have not toxic effects even at a dose of 5000 mg/kg. MEJG at 25, 50, 100 and 200 μg/mL decreased NO, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 production in macrophages stimulated with LPS.

Moreover, the anti-inflammatory potential of HD was examined to identify a plausible mechanism of action of HD in vitro. HD strongly reduced goblet cell hyperplasia, eosinophil infiltration, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which reduced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), , and the expression of Th2 cytokines (IL-5 and IL-13) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). The expression of IL-5, IL-4, eotaxin-2, lysyl oxidase-like 2 (loxl2), and GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA-3) was attenuated in the lungs. In an in vitro assay, HD exerted immunomodulatory effects through the suppression of Th2 cytokines (IL-5, IL-13), IL-17, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α production through downregulation of GATA-3 expression in EL-4 T cells. These findings suggest that the anti-asthmatic activity of HD may occur through the suppression of Th2 cytokines and total Immunoglobulin E (IgE) production by inhibition of the GATA-3 transcription pathway. Our results suggest that HD may be a potential alternative therapy, or a novel therapeutic traditional medicine, for the treatment of allergic asthma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31404259> Triterpenoids Improve Diabetes-Induced Hepatic   the Rho-Kinase-Dependent Pathway.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to assess the effects of triterpene extract of  (Batal.) Iljinskaja (CPT) on diabetes-induced hepatic  and to unveil the underlying mechanisms. Diabetes in db/db mice was alleviated after CPT administration, as assessed by the oral glucose tolerance test. In addition, treatment with CPT dramatically reduced serum insulin, aspartate amino-transaminase, alanine aminotransferase, triglyceride, and total cholesterol amounts. Besides, serum levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were also reduced after CPT administration. Western blot analysis revealed that CPT treatment significantly reversed the protein expression levels of Rho, ROCK1, ROCK2, p-P65, p-IκBα, p-IKKα, and p-IKKβ in liver samples obtained from db/db mice. Upon  stimulation, the protective effects of CPT on the liver were further assessed in HepG2 and LO2 cells, and no appreciable cytotoxic effects were found. Therefore, these findings indicate that CPT alleviates liver   Rho-kinase signaling.

In AD hippocampal-dependent episodic memory is one of the first types of memory to be impaired. Previous studies have shown that in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) episodic memory is rapidly but reversibly impaired.In this study we use hippocampal proteomics to investigate the effects of HFD in the hippocampus. Mice were fed either a low-fat diet (LFD) or HFD containing either 10% or 60% (Kcal) from fat for 3 days, 1 week or 2 weeks. One group of mice were fed the HFD for 1 week and then returned to the LFD for a further week. Primary hippocampal cultures were challenged with  (PA), the most common long-chain saturated FA in the Western diet, and with the anti-inflammatory, n-3 polyunsaturated FA, docosahexaenoic  (DHA), or a combination of the two to ascertain effects of these fatty acids on dendritic structure.HFD-induced changes occur in hippocampal proteins involved in metabolism, , cell stress, cell signalling, and the cytoskeleton after 3 days, 1 week and 2 weeks of HFD. Replacement of the HFD after 1 week by a low-fat diet (LFD) for a further week resulted in partial recovery of the hippocampal proteome. Microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), one of the earliest proteins changed, was used to investigate the impact of fatty acids (FAs) on hippocampal neuronal morphology. PA challenge resulted in shorter and less arborised dendrites while DHA had no effect when applied alone but counteracted the effects of PA when FAs were used in combination. Dendritic morphology recovered when PA was removed from the cell culture media.This study provides evidence for the rapid and reversible effects of diet on the hippocampal proteome and the impact of PA and DHA on dendritic structure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30263011>MiR27a Promotes the Development of Macrophage-like Characteristics in 3T3-L1 Preadipocytes.</a></h2><p>Recruitment and polarization of classically activated (M1) macrophages within adipose tissue contribute to chronic low-grade  in obesity. Adipose tissue precursor cells exhibit the capacity to develop macrophage-like characteristics and adipocyte-derived miR27a is known to promote reprogramming of somatic cells. It was unknown whether exogenous addition of miR27a promote the development of macrophage-like characteristics of adipose precursor cells. We examined macrophage surface antigen, phagocytosis and migration ability in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes transfected with miR27a mimics. Transfection of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with miR27a mimics increased phagocytosis and migration and increased the number of cells expressing the macrophage makers F4/80 and MHC compared to controls. M2 and CD206 macrophage markers were unaltered. In addition, transfection of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with miR27a mimics reduced PPARγ expression, activated NF-κB and promoted secretion of the inflammatory cytokines MCP-1, TNF-α and IL-1β compared to controls. The level of anti-inflammatory factors Arg-1, IL-10, Ym1 and Fizz1 were unaltered. Secretion of miR27a was increased in conditioned medium prepared from -treated differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes compared to controls. Incubation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with this conditioned medium increased phagocytosis and migration compared to controls. Finally, conditioned medium prepared from differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes transfection with miR27a inhibitors reduced phagocytosis and migration in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes compared to controls. The data indicate that PPARγ agonists may reverse the activation of NF-κB pathway mediated by miR27a overexpression and reduce phagocytosis and migration of adipose precursor cells. In addition, miR27a may promote the development of macrophage-like characteristics in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30993530>Analysis of Fatty  Esters of Hydroxyl Fatty  in Selected Plant Food.</a></h2><p>Metabolic syndrome, characterized by obesity, low-grade , insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and hypertension, is a major risk factor for cardiovascular mortality. Preclinical studies on recently discovered classes of lipids - fatty  esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFA) have revealed their anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing potential. The FAHFA levels are significantly decreased in insulin-resistant individuals, their application exhibited anti-inflammatory effects and restoring the glucose-insulin homeostasis. The aim of our research was to analyze the overall FAHFA composition in a common diet, as only a partial FAHFA composition has been revealed so far (only the PAHSA subclass was analyzed in a few foods). A new approach to the FAHFAs analysis includes nano-LC and post-column modifier followed by negative ion mass spectrometry, in order to obtain maximum sensitivity. Analysis of different foods - oat (whole grain, coarse flakes and fine flakes), apple, clementine, lemon, strawberry, blueberry, mango, kiwi, avocado, pineapple, banana, onion, garlic, cherry tomato, carrot, parsley root, pepper and radish - exhibited wide inter-food variation in the FAHFA profiles. Sixteen analyzed FAHFAs (, oleic, palmitoleic and stearic hydroxy-esters) showed microgram to low nanogram levels (0.165 ng/g - 32 μg/g FW), with the highest abundancy in oat, clementine, garlic and pineapple. Stearic  hydroxy stearic  (SAHSA) was the most abundant FAHFA, especially in the food with antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and beneficial metabolic effects. In contrary, the PAHSA - previously proven to have the strongest antihyperglycemic and insulin-sensitizing effects, was not present in some foods (radish, avocado, mango, lemon, cherry tomato, kiwi). Our study proves the importance of overall FAHFA analysis in food (especially in a functional food), because of their potential metabolic benefits and possible future incorporation in special diets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30516825>Histone demethylase UTX is a therapeutic target for diabetic kidney disease.</a></h2><p>Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a major complication of diabetes.

It has been well established that the chronic sterile  caused by the NLRP3 inflammasome is closely related to NAFLD development. Kupffer cells (KCs) are involved in the pathogenesis of various liver diseases. We used methionine choline-deficient diets to establish a mouse nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) model. The expression and formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the KCs from the mouse and cell models were determined by Western blotting and co-immunoprecipitation. Evidence of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) release was determined by live cell labeling and imaging. KCs and the NLRP3 inflammasome exerted proinflammatory effects on the development and progression of NASH through secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β. NLRP3, ASC and Caspase-1 protein expression levels in KCs from NASH mouse livers were significantly higher than those in KCs from NLRP3 mice, and the number of NLRP3 inflammasome protein complexes was significantly higher in KCs from NASH mouse livers, whereas these protein complexes could not be formed in NLRP3 mice. In in vitro experiments,  (PA) decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential and subsequently induced mtDNA release from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm. NLRP3 inflammasome expression was substantially increased, and mtDNA-NLRP3 inflammasome complexes formed upon PA stimulation. Our data suggest that mtDNA released from mitochondria during PA stimulation causes NLRP3 inflammasome activation, providing a missing link between NLRP3 inflammasome activation and NASH development, via binding of cytosolic mtDNA to the NLRP3 inflammasome.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In particular, saturated FAs such as  (PA) induce inflammatory signals in macrophages, whereas polyunsaturated FAs, including docosahexaenoic  (DHA), have been related to anti-inflammatory effects. Several studies have suggested a role of fatty acids on DNA methylation, epigenetically regulating gene expression in  processes. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of PA and DHA on the -related genes on human macrophages. In addition, a second aim was to study the epigenetic mechanism underlying the effect of FAs on the inflammatory response. For these purposes, human acute monocytic leukaemia cells (THP-1) were differentiated into macrophages with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), followed by an incubation with PA or DHA. At the end of the experiment, mRNA expression, protein secretion, and CpG methylation of the following inflammatory genes were analysed: interleukin 1 beta (IL1B), tumour necrosis factor (TNF), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (SERPINE1) and interleukin 18 (IL18). The results showed that the treatment with PA increased IL-18 and TNF-α production. Contrariwise, the supplementation with DHA reduced IL-18, TNF-α and PAI-1 secretion by macrophages. However, the incubation with these fatty acids did not apparently modify the DNA methylation status of the investigated genes in the screened CpG sites. This research reveals that PA induces important pro-inflammatory markers in human macrophages, whereas DHA decreases the inflammatory response. Apparently, DNA methylation is not directly involved in the fatty -mediated regulation of the expression of these -related genes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30340828>9-PAHSA promotes browning of white fat via activating G-protein-coupled receptor 120 and inhibiting lipopolysaccharide / NF-kappa B pathway.</a></h2><p>Browning of white adipose tissue is a novel mechanism to counteract obesity in view of its thermogenic activity. Activation of G-protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR120) can promote the browning of white fat. 9-PAHSA, an endogenous mammalian lipid, which is acting as the ligand of GPR120 to enhance glucose uptake and exert anti-inflammatory effect. In the study, we would like to investigate the biological effects of 9-PAHSA on adipocyte browning. Here, we show that 9-PAHSA induces browning of 3T3-L1 adipocytes via enhanced expression of brown fat specific genes. 9-PAHSA-induced browning in white adipocytes of WT mice and ob/ob mice was investigated by determining expression levels of brown adipocyte-specific genes/proteins by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis, immunoblot analysis and immunochemical staining. The effects of 9-PAHSA on brown fat markers in 3T3-L1 cells were decreased when GPR120 gene was silenced. To investigate the molecular mechanism of 9-PAHSA on adipocyte browning, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory model was conducted. 9-PAHSA treatment abolished LPS-induced NF-kappa B (NF-κB) activation and inflammatory cytokine secretion. But these anti-inflammatory effects of 9-PAHSA were attenuated by GPR120 knockdown. Our finding demonstrated that the browning of adipocyte was induced by 9-PAHSA through activating GPR120 and inhibiting the LPS/NF-κB pathway.

Acute liver injury was induced by a single injection of acetaminophen (APAP). Feeding with either a methionine choline-deficient (MCD; 8 weeks) or a 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine-supplemented diet (DDC; 12 weeks) was used to induce lipotoxic injury and Mallory-Denk body (MDB) formation, respectively. Primary hepatocytes were treated with .Patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and chronic hepatitis C infection displayed elevated HSP72 levels. These levels increased with the extent of hepatic  and HSP72 expression was induced after treatment with either interleukin (IL)-1β or IL-6. Hsp72-LAP mice exhibited robust, hepatocyte-specific Hsp72 overexpression. Primary hepatocytes from these animals were more resistant to isolation-induced stress and Hsp72-LAP mice displayed lower levels of hepatic injury in vivo. Mice overexpressing Hsp72 had fewer APAP protein adducts and were protected from oxidative stress and APAP-/MCD-induced cell death. Hsp72-LAP mice and/or hepatocytes displayed significantly attenuated Jnk activation. Overexpression of Hsp72 did not affect steatosis or the extent of MDB formation.Our results demonstrate that HSP72 induction occurs in human liver disease, thus, HSP72 represents an attractive therapeutic target owing to its broad hepatoprotective functions.HSP72 constitutes a stress-inducible, protective protein. Our data demonstrate that it is upregulated in patients with chronic hepatitis C and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

However, it is unknown if 5-PAHSA affects glucose and lipid metabolism in db/db mice, which are characterized by extreme hyperglycemia. Here, we aim to determine the effect of continued 5-PAHSA administration on glucose and lipid metabolism in db/db mice. We also used 3T3-L1 cells and HepG2 cells to investigate the mechanism behind this effect. HepG2 cells and 3T3-L1 cells were induced to become models of insulin resistance. The models were used to test the effect of 5-PAHSA on insulin signaling. 5-PAHSA was administered orally to db/db mice for 1 month to assess its effects on glucose and lipid metabolism. We also exposed HepG2 cells to high glucose concentrations to investigate the influence on 5-PAHSA's effects on hepatic lipid metabolism and . 5-PAHSA improved glucose uptake and insulin signaling in HepG2 cells and 3T3-L1 cells. However, after 1 month of treatment, 5-PAHSA did not reduce blood glucose levels, but increased  and promoted fatty liver in db/db mice. In HepG2 cells under normal glucose conditions, 5-PAHSA treatment reduced lipogenesis and increased lipid oxidation. Notably, a high glucose concentration in cell media abolished the positive effects of 5-PAHSA treatment. These changes were associated with: decreased phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC); upregulation of sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c), and fatty  synthase (FAS); and downregulation of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1).

Pharmacological agents that can restore hepatic autophagic flux could therefore have therapeutic potentials for this increasingly prevalent disease. Herein, we investigated the effects of polydatin, a natural precursor of resveratrol, in a murine nutritional model of NASH and a cell line model of steatosis. Results showed that oral administration of polydatin protected against hepatic lipid accumulation and alleviated  and hepatocyte damage in db/db mice fed methionine-choline deficient diet. Polydatin also alleviated -induced lipid accumulation in cultured hepatocytes. In both models, polydatin restored lysosomal function and autophagic flux that were impaired by NASH or steatosis. Mechanistically, polydatin inhibited mTOR signalling and up-regulated the expression and activity of TFEB, a known master regulator of lysosomal function. In conclusion, polydatin ameliorated NASH through restoring autophagic flux. The polydatin-regulated autophagy was associated with inhibition of mTOR pathway and restoration of lysosomal function by TFEB.

SFAs can induce lipotoxic damage to cardiomyocytes, but the mechanism is unclear. The long noncoding RNA metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) acts as a key regulator in  (PA)-induced hepatic steatosis, but its role in PA-induced myocardial lipotoxic injury is still unknown. The aim of this study was to explore the role and underlying mechanism of MALAT1 in PA-induced myocardial lipotoxic injury.  MALAT1 expression in PA-treated human cardiomyocytes (AC16 cells) was detected by RT-qPCR. The effect of MALAT1 on PA-induced myocardial injury was measured by Cell Counting Kit-8, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) assays. Apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. The activities of cytokines and nuclear factor (NF)-κB were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The interaction between MALAT1 and miR-26a was evaluated by a luciferase reporter assay and RT-qPCR. The regulatory effects of MALAT1 on high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) expression were evaluated by RT-qPCR and western blotting.  MALAT1 was significantly upregulated in cardiomyocytes after PA treatment. Knockdown of MALAT1 increased the viability of PA-treated cardiomyocytes, decreased apoptosis, and reduced the levels of LDH, CK-MB, TNF-α, and IL-1β. Moreover, we found that MALAT1 specifically binds to miR-26a and observed a reciprocal negative regulatory relationship between these factors. We further found that the downregulation of MALAT1 represses HMGB1 expression, thereby inhibiting the activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response. These repressive effects were rescued by an miR-26a inhibitor.  We demonstrate that MALAT1 is induced by SFAs and its downregulation alleviates SFA-induced myocardial inflammatory injury via the miR-26a/HMGB1/TLR4/NF-κB axis.

Our results showed that HDL inhibited PA-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, HDL rescued PA-induced ROS generation and the phosphorylation of JNK which in turn activated NF-κB-mediated inflammatory proteins expressions.

Nutrient excess, through overconsumption of a Western or high-fat diet, exposes the hypothalamus to high levels of free fatty acids, which induces neuroinflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and dysregulation of neuropeptide synthesis. Furthermore, exposure to a high-fat diet also disrupts normal circadian rhythms, and conversely, clock gene knockout models have symptoms of metabolic disorders. While whole brain/animal studies have provided phenotypic end points and important clues to the genes involved, there are still major gaps in our understanding of the intracellular pathways and neuron-specific components that ultimately control circadian rhythms and energy homeostasis. Because of its complexity and heterogeneous nature, containing a diverse mix cell types, it is difficult to dissect the critical hypothalamic components involved in these processes. Of significance, we have the capacity to study these individual components using an extensive collection of both embryonic- and adult-derived, immortalized hypothalamic neuronal cell lines from rodents.

Anthocyanins (ACNs) are associated to enhanced adipocyte function and protection from metabolic stress. Herein, we evaluated the in vitro protective effects of an ACN rich extract against  (PA)-induced hypertrophy, , and insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. ACN extract pretreatment reduces lipid accumulation and peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-γ protein levels induced by PA. In addition, PA induces  with activation of NF-κB pathway, whereas ACN extract pretreatment dose-dependently inhibited this pathway. Furthermore, adipocyte dysfunction associated with hypertrophy induces insulin resistance by affecting phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-protein kinase B/Akt axis, GLUT-1, and adiponectin mRNA levels. ACN extract pretreatment reverts these effects induced by PA and moreover was able to induce insulin pathway with levels higher than insulin control cells, supporting an insulin sensitizer role for ACNs. This study demonstrates a prevention potential of ACNs against obesity comorbidities, due to their protective effects against /insulin resistance in adipocytes.

Additionally, 1,25(OH)D stimulated a 2.5-fold increase in CO production from [1-C]  (P < .01), indicative of an elevated rate of fatty  β-oxidation, while stimulating a 9% reduction in de novo fatty  synthesis (P = .03). Interestingly, d-[U-C]glucose incorporation into fatty acids was reduced by 30% in response to 1,25(OH)D (P < .01), indicating a reduced contribution of glucose as a substrate for de novo lipogenesis. Consistent with these findings, mRNA expression of the anaplerotic enzyme pyruvate carboxylase was reduced by 41% (P < .01). In summary, 1,25(OH)D stimulated fatty  oxidation and reduced TAG accumulation in differentiated adipocytes. Furthermore, 1,25(OH)D reduced glucose utilization as a substrate for fatty  synthesis potentially by downregulating pyruvate carboxylase and stimulating glucose disposal as glycerol. Collectively, these 1,25(OH)D-induced changes in lipid metabolism and glucose utilization may contribute to the reduction in TAG accumulation and be protective against excessive fat mass accumulation and associated metabolic disorders.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

It has been suggested that microglia sense palmitate, a prevalent circulating SFA, and act as mediators of this inflammatory process by communicating with neurons, particularly those involved in appetite regulation. In this study, we examined the inflammatory response to palmitate in immortalized microglial cell lines, BV-2 and IMG, and the subsequent effects on inflammatory gene expression in a model of NPY/AgRP neurons, mHypoE-46.The BV-2 cells were treated with 50 µM palmitate for 4 and 24 h, and the transcriptional regulation of markers for  and cellular stress was assessed using an RT2 Profiler PCR Array. Select genes were verified with qRT-PCR. The BV-2 and IMG cells were then co-cultured using 1.0-µm cell culture inserts with an immortalized hypothalamic cell line, mHypoE-46, to investigate potential intercellular communication between microglia and neurons.We found that palmitate increased the mRNA levels of specific inflammatory genes, and a general anti-inflammatory profile was revealed in the microglia cells. The mRNA changes in TNFα at 4 and 24 h in BV-2 cells were abrogated with the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) inhibitor, TAK-242, indicating the involvement of TLR4. Co-culture of mHypoE-46 neurons with microglia pre-treated with palmitate resulted in repression of TNFα expression in the hypothalamic neurons. As palmitate significantly increased IL-13 expression in microglia, the effect of this cytokine was tested in mHypoE-46 neurons. The addition of IL-13 to neuronal cultures normalized the palmitate-mediated increase in IL-6 and AgRP expression, suggesting that microglia may protect surrounding neurons, at least in part, through the release of IL-13.These results suggest a potential anti-inflammatory role of microglia towards the palmitate-induced neuroinflammation, and potentially energy homeostasis, in hypothalamic neurons.© 2018 ©2018S.

Here we investigated the effects of Cangju Qinggan Jiangzhi decoction (CQJD) on high fat diet (HFD) and methionine-choline deficient (MCD) induced mouse NASH pathogenesis.Mouse NASH models were developed by HFD and MCD diet. The treated mice were divided into three groups: the control group (n = 10), the low-dose CQJD treatment group (n = 10) and the high-dose CQJD treatment group (n = 10). The hepatic injury, , and apoptotic molecules were evaluated by H&E staining, immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR. Kupffer cells were isolated from control mice and CQJD-treated mice after stimulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and/or . The level of the inflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL1β, and CCL2 was measured by ELISA.The HFD-fed mice displayed significant metabolic, inflammatory, and oxidative stress-related alterations due to hepatic lipid accumulation. CQJD treatment largely normalized the hepatic injury, lowered the ALT/AST level, and reduced the severity of liver , as revealed by the decreased inflammatory cytokines levels. In vitro, CQJD blocked the activation of LPS- or -primed Kupffer cells in a dose-dependent manner. In the MCD diet-induced NASH mice, similar therapeutic effects of CQJD were also observed.CQJD ameliorates mouse nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The reduction in liver injury and  induced by CQJD is associated with reduced activation of Kupffer cells.

However, the underlying mechanism in pancreatic β cells remains unclear. To explore the potential link between GPR120 and β-cell function, its agonists docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and GSK137647A were used in  (PA)-induced pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, coupled with GPR120 knockdown (KD) in MIN6 cells and GPR120 knockout (KO) mice to identify the underlying signaling pathways.  and  treatments of MIN6 cells and islets isolated from wild-type (WT) mice with DHA and GSK137647A restored pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1 (PDX1) expression levels and β-cell function via inhibiting PA-induced elevation of proinflammatory chemokines and activation of nuclear factor κB, c-Jun amino (N)-terminal kinases1/2 and p38MAPK signaling pathways. On the contrary, these GPR120 agonism-mediated protective effects were abolished in GPR120 KD cells and islets isolated from GPR120 KO mice. Furthermore, GPR120 KO mice displayed glucose intolerance and insulin resistance relative to WT littermates, and β-cell functional related genes were decreased while  was exacerbated in islets with increased macrophages in pancreas from GPR120 KO mice. DHA and GSK137647A supplementation ameliorated glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, as well as improved  expression and islet  in diet-induced obese WT mice, but not in GPR120 KO mice. These findings indicate that GPR120 activation is protective against lipotoxicity-induced pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, via the mediation of PDX1 expression and inhibition of islet , and that GPR120 activation may serve as a preventative and therapeutic target for obesity and diabetes.© 2019 The Author(s).

Intestinal immunity is functionally affected by both diet and gut commensal bacteria. Here, we review the effects of fatty acids on the regulation of intestinal immunity and immunological diseases, revealing that dietary fatty acids and their metabolites play an important role in the regulation of allergy, , and immunosurveillance in the intestine. Several lines of evidence have revealed that some dietary fatty acids are converted to biologically active metabolites by enzymes not only in the host but also in the commensal bacteria.

The natural compound celastrol could improve obesity, which is suggested via inhibiting , yet the detailed mechanism for celastrol is still unclear. As celastrol is reported to directly target MD2, we thought disrupting the binding between FFAs and MD2 might be one of the ways for celastrol to inhibit FFAs-caused  and insulin resistance. In this study, we found evidence to support our hypothesis: celastrol could reverse PA-caused TLR4/MD2 activation-dependent insulin resistance, as determined by glucose-lowering ability, cellular glucose uptake, insulin action-related proteins and TLR4/MD2/NF-κB activation. Bioinformatics and cellular experiments showed that both celastrol and PA could bind MD2, and that celastrol could expel PA from cells. Finally, celastrol could reverse high fat diet caused hyperglycemia and obesity, and liver NF-kB activations.

The formation of mature IL-1β from an inactive pro-IL-1β precursor is produced via nonconventional multiprotein complexes called the inflammasomes, of which the most common is the nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome composed by NLRP3, (ASC) apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD), and caspase-1. Specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs) promote resolution of , which is an essential process to maintain host health. SPMs prevent excessive  by terminating the inflammatory response and returning to tissue homeostasis without immunosupression. This study tested the hypothesis that modulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages is one mechanism involved in the SPM-regulated processes during resolution. Our findings demonstrate that the SPM resolvin D2 (RvD2) suppressed the expression of pro-IL-1β and reduced the secretion of mature IL-1β in bone marrow-derived macrophages challenged with LPS+ATP (classical NLRP3 inflammasome model) or LPS+palmitate (lipotoxic model). Similar findings were observed in thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages, in which RvD2 remarkably reduced ASC oligomerization, inflammasome assembly, and caspase-1 activity. In vivo, in a self-resolving zymosan A-induced peritonitis model, RvD2 blocked the NLRP3 inflammasome leading to reduced release of IL-1β into the exudates, repression of osteopontin, and MCP-1 expression and induction of M2 markers of resolution (i.e., CD206 and arginase-1) in peritoneal macrophages. RvD2 inhibitory actions were receptor mediated and were abrogated by a selective GPR18 antagonist. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that SPMs have the ability to inhibit the priming and to expedite the deactivation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages during the resolution process.©2018 Society for Leukocyte Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29463677>An unexpected link between fatty  synthase and cholesterol synthesis in proinflammatory macrophage activation.</a></h2><p>Different immune activation states require distinct metabolic features and activities in immune cells. For instance, inhibition of fatty  synthase (FASN), which catalyzes the synthesis of long-chain fatty acids, prevents the proinflammatory response in macrophages; however, the precise role of this enzyme in this response remains poorly defined. Consistent with previous studies, we found here that FASN is essential for lipopolysaccharide-induced, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated macrophage activation. Interestingly, only agents that block FASN upstream of acetoacetyl-CoA synthesis, including the well-characterized FASN inhibitor C75, inhibited TLR4 signaling, while those acting downstream had no effect. We found that acetoacetyl-CoA could overcome C75's inhibitory effect, whereas other FASN metabolites, including palmitate, did not prevent C75-mediated inhibition. This suggested an unexpected role for acetoacetyl-CoA in  that is independent of its role in palmitate synthesis. Our evidence further suggested that acetoacetyl-CoA arising from FASN activity promotes cholesterol production, indicating a surprising link between fatty  synthesis and cholesterol synthesis. We further demonstrate that this process is required for TLR4 to enter lipid rafts and facilitate TLR4 signaling. In conclusion, we have uncovered an unexpected link between FASN and cholesterol synthesis that appears to be required for TLR signal transduction and proinflammatory macrophage activation.© 2018 Carroll et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29991726>The autophagic degradation of Cav-1 contributes to PA-induced apoptosis and  of astrocytes.</a></h2><p>The accumulation of  (PA), implicated in obesity, can induce apoptotic cell death and  of astrocytes. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), an essential protein for astrocytes survival, can be degraded by autophagy, which is a double-edge sword that can either promote cell survival or cell death. The aim of this study was to delineate whether the autophagic degradation of Cav-1 is involved in PA-induced apoptosis and  in hippocampal astrocytes.

The dietary supplement palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) exerts anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. Here, we investigated the effect of prophylactic PEA on the early immune response, clinical course, and survival of old mice after intracerebral  K1 infection. Nineteen-month-old wild type mice were treated intraperitoneally with two doses of either 0.1 mg PEA/kg in 250 μl vehicle solution ( = 19) or with 250 μl vehicle solution only as controls ( = 19), 12 h and 30 min prior to intracerebral  K1 infection. The intraperitoneal route was chosen to reduce distress in mice and to ensure exact dosing. Survival time, bacterial loads in cerebellum, blood, spleen, liver, and microglia counts and activation scores in the brain were evaluated. We measured the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, MIP-1α, and CXCL1 in cerebellum and spleen, as well as of bioactive lipids in serum in PEA- and vehicle-treated animals 24 h after infection. In the absence of antibiotic therapy, the median survival time of PEA-pre-treated infected mice was prolonged by 18 h compared to mice of the vehicle-pre-treated infected group ( = 0.031). PEA prophylaxis delayed the onset of clinical symptoms ( = 0.037). This protective effect was associated with lower bacterial loads in the spleen, liver, and blood compared to those of vehicle-injected animals ( ≤ 0.037). PEA-pre-treated animals showed diminished levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in spleen 24 h after infection, as well as reduced serum concentrations of arachidonic  and of one of its metabolites, 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic . In the brain, prophylactic PEA tended to reduce bacterial titers and attenuated microglial activation in aged infected animals ( = 0.042). Our findings suggest that prophylactic PEA can counteract infection associated detrimental responses in old animals. Accordingly, PEA treatment slowed the onset of infection symptoms and prolonged the survival of old infected mice. In a clinical setting, prophylactic administration of PEA might extend the potential therapeutic window where antibiotic therapy can be initiated to rescue elderly patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29474492>Docosahexaenoic  antagonizes the boosting effect of  on LPS inflammatory signaling by inhibiting gene transcription and ceramide synthesis.</a></h2><p>It is well known that saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and unsaturated fatty , in particular omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), have different effects on inflammatory signaling: SFAs are pro-inflammatory but n-3 PUFAs have strong anti-inflammatory properties. We have reported that  (PA), a saturated fatty , robustly amplifies lipopolysaccharide (LPS) signaling to upregulate proinflammatory gene expression in macrophages. We also reported that the increased production of ceramide (CER) via sphingomyelin (SM) hydrolysis and CER de novo synthesis plays a key role in the synergistic effect of LPS and PA on proinflammatory gene expression. However, it remains unclear if n-3 PUFAs are capable of antagonizing the synergistic effect of LPS and PA on gene expression and CER production. In this study, we employed the above macrophage culture system and lipidomical analysis to assess the effect of n-3 PUFAs on proinflammatory gene expression and CER production stimulated by LPS and PA. Results showed that DHA strongly inhibited the synergistic effect of LPS and PA on proinflammatory gene expression by targeting nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB)-dependent gene transcription. Results also showed that DHA inhibited the cooperative effect of LPS and PA on CER production by targeting CER de novo synthesis, but not SM hydrolysis. Furthermore, results showed that myriocin, a specific inhibitor of serine palmitoyltransferase, strongly inhibited both LPS-PA-stimulated CER synthesis and proinflammatory gene expression, indicating that CER synthesis is associated with proinflammatory gene expression and that inhibition of CER synthesis contributes to DHA-inhibited proinflammatory gene expression. Taken together, this study demonstrates that DHA antagonizes the boosting effect of PA on LPS signaling on proinflammatory gene expression by targeting both NFκB-dependent transcription and CER de novo synthesis in macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29720222>Targeted lipidomics analysis identified altered serum lipid profiles in patients with polymyositis and dermatomyositis.</a></h2><p>Polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM) are severe chronic autoimmune diseases, characterized by muscle fatigue and low muscle endurance. Conventional treatment includes high doses of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive drugs; however, few patients recover full muscle function.

Using a targeted lipidomic approach we aimed to characterize serum lipid profiles in patients with PM/DM compared to healthy individuals (HI) in a cross-sectional study. Also, in the longitudinal study we compared serum lipid profiles in patients newly diagnosed with PM/DM before and after immunosuppressive treatment.Lipidomic profiles were analyzed in serum samples from 13 patients with PM/DM, 12 HI and 8 patients newly diagnosed with PM/DM before and after conventional immunosuppressive treatment using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and a gas-chromatography flame ionization detector (GC-FID). Functional Index (FI), as a test of muscle performance and serum levels of creatine kinase (s-CK) as a proxy for disease activity were analyzed.The fatty  (FA) composition of total serum lipids was altered in patients with PM/DM compared to HI; the levels of  (16:0)  were significantly higher while the levels of arachidonic (20:4, n-6)  were significantly lower in patients with PM/DM. The profiles of serum phosphatidylcholine and triacylglycerol species were changed in patients with PM/DM compared to HI, suggesting disproportionate levels of saturated and polyunsaturated FAs that might have negative effects on muscle performance. After immunosuppressive treatment the total serum lipid levels of eicosadienoic (20:2, n-6) and eicosapentaenoic (20:5, n-3) acids were increased and serum phospholipid profiles were altered in patients with PM/DM. The correlation between FI or s-CK and levels of several lipid species indicate the important role of lipid changes in muscle performance and .Serum lipids profiles are significantly altered in patients with PM/DM compared to HI. Moreover, immunosuppressive treatment in patients newly diagnosed with PM/DM significantly affected serum lipid profiles. These findings provide new evidence of the dysregulated lipid metabolism in patients with PM/DM that could possibly contribute to low muscle performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29290500> and Oleic : The Yin and Yang of Fatty Acids in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.</a></h2><p>Increased plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) link obesity with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

The aim of the present study was to examine whether EPA could affect substrate cycling in human skeletal muscle cells by altering lipolysis rate of intracellular TAG and re-esterification of fatty acids. Fatty  metabolism was studied in human myotubes using a mixture of fatty acids, consisting of radiolabelled oleic  as tracer (14C-OA) together with EPA or PA. Co-incubation of myotubes with EPA increased cell-accumulation and incomplete fatty  oxidation of 14C-OA compared to co-incubation with PA. Lipid distribution showed higher incorporation of 14C-OA into all cellular lipids after co-incubation with EPA relative to PA, with most markedly increases (3 to 4-fold) for diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol. Further, the increases in cellular lipids after co-incubation with EPA were accompanied by higher lipolysis and fatty  re-esterification rate. Correspondingly, basal respiration, proton leak and maximal respiration were significantly increased in cells exposed to EPA compared to PA. Microarray and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that EPA, related to PA, significantly changed i.e. the GO terms "Neutral lipid metabolic process" and "Regulation of lipid storage". Finally, an inhibitor of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 decreased the effect of EPA to promote fatty  accumulation. In conclusion, incubation of human myotubes with EPA, compared to PA, increased processes of fatty  turnover and oxidation suggesting that EPA may activate futile substrate cycling of fatty acids in human myotubes. Increased TAG-FA cycling may be involved in the potentially favourable effects of long-chain polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids on skeletal muscle and whole-body energy metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29930005>Diabetes Mellitus-Induced Long Noncoding RNA Dnm3os Regulates Macrophage Functions and  via Nuclear Mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Objective- Macrophages play key roles in  and diabetic vascular complications. Emerging evidence implicates long noncoding RNAs in , but their role in macrophage dysfunction associated with inflammatory diabetic complications is unclear and was therefore investigated in this study. Approach and Results- RNA-sequencing and real-time quantitative PCR demonstrated that a long noncoding RNA Dnm3os (dynamin 3 opposite strand) is upregulated in bone marrow-derived macrophages from type 2 diabetic db/db mice, diet-induced insulin-resistant mice, and diabetic ApoE mice, as well as in monocytes from type 2 diabetic patients relative to controls. Diabetic conditions (high glucose and ) induced Dnm3os in mouse and human macrophages. Promoter reporter analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that diabetic conditions induce Dnm3os via NF-κB activation. RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization and real-time quantitative PCRs of subcellular fractions demonstrated nuclear localization and chromatin enrichment of Dnm3os in macrophages. Stable overexpression of Dnm3os in macrophages altered global histone modifications and upregulated  and immune response genes and phagocytosis. Conversely, RNAi-mediated knockdown of Dnm3os attenuated these responses. RNA pull-down assays with macrophage nuclear lysates identified nucleolin and ILF-2 (interleukin enhancer-binding factor 2) as protein binding partners of Dnm3os, which was further confirmed by RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization immunofluorescence. Furthermore, nucleolin levels were decreased in diabetic conditions, and its knockdown enhanced Dnm3os-induced inflammatory gene expression and histone H3K9-acetylation at their promoters. Conclusions- These results demonstrate novel mechanisms involving upregulation of long noncoding RNA Dnm3os, disruption of its interaction with nucleolin, and epigenetic modifications at target genes that promote macrophage inflammatory phenotype in diabetes mellitus.

Fatty  profiles, endocannabinoids, and N-acylethanolamine congeners were determined in liver and skeletal muscle tissue.  We demonstrated that DM or HM administration reducing  status, improves glucose disposal and insulin resistance and reduces lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle. Moreover, HM or DM administration increases redox status, and mitochondrial uncoupling, affecting mitochondrial dynamics in the skeletal muscle. Interestingly, HM and DM supplementation increase liver and muscle levels of the N-oleoylethanolamine (OEA), a key regulator of lipid metabolism and .  HM and DM have a healthy nutritional effect, acting on inflammatory factors and glucose and lipid metabolism. This beneficial effect is associated to a modulation of mitochondrial function, efficiency, and dynamics and to an increase of OEA levels in skeletal muscle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30261289>Involvement of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) in the development of non-alcoholic steatosis and steatohepatitis in mice and humans.</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance (IR) and obesity are important risk factors for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) is involved in the development of IR and obesity in vivo. However, its possible contribution to NAFLD and/or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) independently of its role on IR or fat mass accretion has not been explored. Here, we used wild-type (WT) or GRK2 hemizygous (GRK2±) mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or a methionine and choline-deficient diet (MCD) as a model of NASH independent of adiposity and IR. GRK2± mice were protected from HFD-induced NAFLD. Moreover, MCD feeding caused an increased in triglyceride content and liver-to-body weight ratio in WT mice, features that were attenuated in GRK2± mice. According to their NAFLD activity score, MCD-fed GRK2± mice were diagnosed with simple steatosis and not overt NASH. They also showed reduced expression of lipogenic and lipid-uptake markers and less signs of  in the liver. GRK2± mice preserved hepatic protective mechanisms as enhanced autophagy and mitochondrial fusion and biogenesis, together with reduced endoplasmic reticulum stress. GRK2 protein was increased in MCD-fed WT but not in GRK2± mice, and enhanced GRK2 expression potentiated -triggered lipid accumulation in human hepatocytes directly relating GRK2 levels to steatosis. GRK2 protein and mRNA levels were increased in human liver biopsies from simple steatosis or NASH patients in two different human cohorts. Our results describe a functional relationship between GRK2 levels and hepatic lipid accumulation and implicate GRK2 in the establishment and/or development of NASH.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, the mechanism by which long-chain saturated fatty acids trigger  is still contentious. To elucidate this mechanism, the effect of fatty acids on the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNFα was investigated in the mHypoE-N42 hypothalamic cell line (N42). N42 cells were treated with lauric  (LA) and  (PA). PA challenge was carried out in the presence of either a TLR4 inhibitor, a ceramide synthesis inhibitor (L-cycloserine), oleic  (OA) or eicosapentaenoic  (EPA). Intracellular ceramide accumulation was quantified using LC-ESI-MS/MS. PA but not LA upregulated IL-6 and TNFα. L-cycloserine, OA and EPA all counteracted PA-induced intracellular ceramide accumulation leading to a downregulation of IL-6 and TNFα. However, a TLR4 inhibitor failed to inhibit PA-induced upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, PA induced the expression of IL-6 and TNFα in N42 neuronal cells independently of TLR4 but, partially, via ceramide synthesis with OA and EPA being anti-inflammatory by decreasing PA-induced intracellular ceramide build-up. Thus, ceramide accumulation represents one on the mechanisms by which PA induces  in neurons.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30230367>Palmitate aggravates proteinuria-induced cell death and  via CD36-inflammasome axis in the proximal tubular cells of obese mice.</a></h2><p>High levels of serum free fatty acids (FFAs) and proteinuria have been implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity-related nephropathy. CD36, a class B scavenger receptor, is highly expressed in the renal proximal tubules and mediates FFA uptake. It is not clear whether FFA- and proteinuria-mediated CD36 activation coordinates NLRP3 inflammasomes to induce renal tubular injury and . In this study, we investigated the roles of CD36 and NLRP3 inflammasomes in FFA-induced renal injury in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. HFD-fed C57BL/6 mice and palmitate-treated HK2 renal tubular cells were used as in vivo and in vitro models. Immunohistochemical staining showed that CD36, IL-1β, and IL-18 levels increased progressively in the kidneys of HFD-fed mice. Sulfo- N-succinimidyl oleate (SSO), a CD36 inhibitor, attenuated the HFD-induced upregulation of NLRP3, IL-1β, and IL-18 and suppressed the colocalization of NLRP3 and ASC in renal tubular cells. In vitro, SSO abolished the palmitate-induced activation of IL-1β, IL-18, and caspase-1 in HK2 proximal tubular cells. Furthermore, treatment with SSO and the knockdown of caspase-1 expression by siRNA both inhibited palmitate-induced cell death and apoptosis in HK2 cells. Collectively, palmitate causes renal tubular , cell death, and apoptosis via the CD36/NLRP3/caspase-1 axis, which may explain, at least in part, the mechanism underlying FFA-related renal tubular injury. The blockade of CD36-induced cellular processes is therefore a promising strategy for treating obesity-related nephropathy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634961>Downregulation of miR-320 Alleviates Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Inflammatory Response in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes.</a></h2><p>MicroRNAs serve important roles in the regulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERs). This study aimed to investigate the role of microRNA-320 (miR-320) in the development of ERs and the inflammatory response in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.The adipose tissue expression levels of miR-320 and ERs markers (GRP78, GRP94, Derlin-1 and CHOP) and the serum concentration of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, NF-κB and IL-6) in obese patients were evaluated using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The correlation of miR-320 with genes involved in ERs and inflammation was analyzed. The effects of miR-320 on ERs and inflammation were explored using mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which were pretreated with  (PA).ERs markers and inflammatory cytokines were all upregulated in obese patients. Adipose tissue miR-320 expression was also increased in obese patients, and had positive correlations with the levels of ERs markers and inflammatory cytokines. After PA treatment, the levels of ERs markers and inflammatory cytokines were elevated significantly in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Moreover, miR-320 expression was increased in the cells under ERs status. The upregulation of miR-320 could enhance the expression of ERs markers and inflammatory cytokines, but the downregulation of miR-320 resulted in the opposite results.The data of this study indicate that miR-320 expression is upregulated in ERs status, and the downregulation of miR-320 ameliorates ERs and the inflammatory response in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We consider that the approaches to decrease miR-320 expression may be novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of obesity and obesity-related diseases.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29794037>Sphingolipid changes do not underlie fatty -evoked GLUT4 insulin resistance nor  signals in muscle cells.</a></h2><p>Ceramides contribute to obesity-linked insulin resistance and  in vivo, but whether this is a cell-autonomous phenomenon is debated, particularly in muscle, which dictates whole-body glucose uptake. We comprehensively analyzed lipid species produced in response to fatty acids and examined the consequence to insulin resistance and pro-inflammatory pathways. L6 myotubes were incubated with BSA-adsorbed palmitate or palmitoleate in the presence of myriocin, fenretinide, or fumonisin B1. Lipid species were determined by lipidomic analysis. Insulin sensitivity was scored by Akt phosphorylation and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation, while pro-inflammatory indices were estimated by IκBα degradation and cytokine expression. Palmitate, but not palmitoleate, had mild effects on Akt phosphorylation but significantly inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation and increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines  and  Ceramides, hexosylceramides, and sphingosine-1-phosphate significantly heightened by palmitate correlated negatively with insulin sensitivity and positively with pro-inflammatory indices. Inhibition of sphingolipid pathways led to marked changes in cellular lipids, but did not prevent palmitate-induced impairment of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, suggesting that palmitate-induced accumulation of deleterious lipids and insulin resistance are correlated but independent events in myotubes. We propose that muscle cell-endogenous ceramide production does not evoke insulin resistance and that deleterious effects of ceramides in vivo may arise through ancillary cell communication.Copyright © 2018 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30802511>The effect of enterolactone on liver lipid precursors of .</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to assess the effects of enterolactone (ENL) on lipid fractions fatty acids composition affecting hepatocyte  development.The experiments were conducted in HepG2 cells incubated with ENL and/or  (16 h). Intracellular contents of free fatty acids (FFA), di- (DAG) and tri- (TAG) acylglycerol as well as their fatty acids compositions were assessed by Gas-Liquid Chromatography. Moreover, the ω-6/ω-3 ratios in the above mentioned lipids fractions were estimated. The expression of proteins involved in eicosanoids and prostanoids production (COX-2, 15-LOX), inflammatory process (TNFα), as well as the proteins participating in the desaturation (SCD 1) and elongation (Elovl 3, Elovl 6) of fatty acids were evaluated by Western Blot.Enterolactone modified fatty acids composition in FFA, DAG and TAG fractions. In conjunction with lipid overload, it increased the content of ω-6 more than ω-3 PUFA. Moreover, it enhanced the expressions of Elovl 3, Elovl 6, COX-2 and TNFα, whereas it had no influence on SCD 1 and 15-LOX level.Our study revealed that the supplementation with ENL affected intracellular hepatic composition of saturated as well as unsaturated fatty acids in each of the investigated lipid fractions. Based on the shift in the ω-6/ω-3 balance towards ω-6, as well as the increase in COX-2 and TNFα protein expressions, we may postulate a pro-inflammatory nature of the examined polyphenol.

It is expressed by endothelial cells, but surprisingly shows negligible glutamine-synthesizing activity in these cells at physiological glutamine levels. Here we show in mice that genetic deletion of Glul in endothelial cells impairs vessel sprouting during vascular development, whereas pharmacological blockade of glutamine synthetase suppresses angiogenesis in ocular and inflammatory skin disease while only minimally affecting healthy adult quiescent endothelial cells. This relies on the inhibition of endothelial cell migration but not proliferation. Mechanistically we show that in human umbilical vein endothelial cells GLUL knockdown reduces membrane localization and activation of the GTPase RHOJ while activating other Rho GTPases and Rho kinase, thereby inducing actin stress fibres and impeding endothelial cell motility. Inhibition of Rho kinase rescues the defect in endothelial cell migration that is induced by GLUL knockdown. Notably, glutamine synthetase palmitoylates itself and interacts with RHOJ to sustain RHOJ palmitoylation, membrane localization and activation. These findings reveal that, in addition to the known formation of glutamine, the enzyme glutamine synthetase shows unknown activity in endothelial cell migration during pathological angiogenesis through RHOJ palmitoylation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30301806>Molecular mechanism of activation of the immunoregulatory amidase NAAA.</a></h2><p>Palmitoylethanolamide is a bioactive lipid that strongly alleviates pain and  in animal models and in humans. Its signaling activity is terminated through degradation by -acylethanolamine  amidase (NAAA), a cysteine hydrolase expressed at high levels in immune cells. Pharmacological inhibitors of NAAA activity exert profound analgesic and antiinflammatory effects in rodent models, pointing to this protein as a potential target for therapeutic drug discovery. To facilitate these efforts and to better understand the molecular mechanism of action of NAAA, we determined crystal structures of this enzyme in various activation states and in complex with several ligands, including both a covalent and a reversible inhibitor. Self-proteolysis exposes the otherwise buried active site of NAAA to allow catalysis. Formation of a stable substrate- or inhibitor-binding site appears to be conformationally coupled to the interaction of a pair of hydrophobic helices in the enzyme with lipid membranes, resulting in the creation of a linear hydrophobic cavity near the active site that accommodates the ligand's acyl chain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30958623>Downregulation of sirtuin 3 by  increases the oxidative stress, impairment of mitochondrial function, and apoptosis in liver cells.</a></h2><p>Elevated levels of saturated fatty acids show a strong cytotoxic effect in liver cells. Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), a mitochondrially localized member of NAD -dependent deacetylase has been shown to protect hepatocytes against the oxidative stress. The role of SIRT3 on the cytotoxicity caused by fatty acids in liver cells is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression level of SIRT3, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial impairments in human hepatoma HepG2 cells exposed to  (PA). Our results showed that PA treatment caused the deposition of lipid droplets and resulted in an increased expression of tumor necrosis factor-α in a dose-dependent manner. Excessive accumulation of PA induces the reactive oxygen species formation and apoptosis while dissipating the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. The level of SIRT3 expression in both nuclear and mitochondrial fractions in HepG2 cells was decreased with the increase in PA concentrations. However, in the cytosolic fraction, the SIRT3 was undetectable. In conclusion, our results showed that PA caused an increase in  and oxidative stress in HepG2 cells. The exposure of PA also resulted in the decline in transmembrane potential and an increase in apoptosis. The underexpression of nuclear and mitochondrial SIRT3 by PA suggests that the PA target the process that regulates the stress-related gene expression and mitochondrial functions.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988370>Synthesis of chemically edited derivatives of the endogenous regulator of  9-PAHSA.</a></h2><p>Fatty  esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs) are a growing class of natural products found in organisms ranging from plants to humans.

NAFLD can progress to an inflammatory state called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which may result in the development of fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. To develop therapeutic strategies against NAFLD, a better understanding of the molecular mechanism is needed. Current in vitro NAFLD models fail to capture the essential interactions between liver cell types and often do not reflect the pathophysiological status of patients. To overcome limitations of commonly used in vitro and in vivo models, precision-cut liver slices (PCLSs) were used in this study. PCLSs, prepared from liver tissue obtained from male Wistar rats, were cultured in supraphysiological concentrations of glucose, fructose, insulin, and  to mimic metabolic syndrome. Accumulation of lipid droplets was visible and measurable after 24 h in PCLSs incubated with glucose, fructose, and insulin, both in the presence and absence of . Upregulation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 and 2, and of sterol responsive element binding protein 1c, suggests increased de novo lipogenesis in PCLSs cultured under these conditions. Additionally, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 expression was reduced, which indicates impaired fatty  transport and disrupted mitochondrial β-oxidation. Thus, steatosis was successfully induced in PCLSs with modified culture medium.

In this study, we aimed to explore the preventive effects of COS on glucolipid metabolism disorder using  (PA)-induced HepG2 cells and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed C57BL/6J mice as experimental models in vitro and in vivo, respectively. The results showed that COS pretreatment for 12 h significantly ameliorated lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells exposed to PA for 24 h, accompanied by a reversing of the upregulated mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, MCP-1, TNF-α) and glucolipid metabolism-related regulators (SCD-1, ACC1, PCK1-α). In addition, COS treatment alleviated glucolipid metabolism disorder in mice fed with HFD for five months, including reduction in body weight and fasting glucose, restoration of intraperitoneal glucose tolerance, and suppression of overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines and glucolipid metabolism-related regulators. Furthermore, our study found that COS pretreatment significantly reversed the downregulation of PPARγ at transcriptional and translational levels in both PA-induced HepG2 cells and liver tissues of HFD-fed mice.

Despite its pandemic proportions, no anti-NASH drugs have been approved yet. This is partially because drug development is decelerated due to the lack of adequate tools to assess the efficacy of potential new drug candidates. The present study describes the development and application of a new preclinical model for NASH using hepatic cells generated from human skin-derived precursors. Exposure of these cells to lipogenic (insulin, glucose, fatty acids) and pro-inflammatory factors (IL-1β, TNF-α, TGF-β) resulted in a characteristic NASH response, as indicated by intracellular lipid accumulation, modulation of NASH-specific gene expression, increased caspase-3/7 activity and the expression and/or secretion of inflammatory markers, including CCL2, CCL5, CCL7, CCL8, CXCL5, CXCL8, IL1a, IL6 and IL11. The human relevance of the proposed NASH model was verified by transcriptomics analyses that revealed commonly modulated genes and the identification of the same gene classes between the in vitro system and patients suffering from NASH. The application potential of this in vitro model was demonstrated by testing elafibranor, a promising anti-NASH compound currently under clinical phase III trial evaluation. Elafibranor attenuated in vitro key features of NASH, and dramatically lowered lipid load as well as the expression and secretion of inflammatory chemokines, which in vivo are responsible for the recruitment of immune cells. This reduction in inflammatory response was NFκB-mediated.

DUSP12 is a member of the dual specificity phosphatase (DUSP) family, which plays important roles in brown adipocyte differentiation, microbial infection, and cardiac hypertrophy. However, the role of DUSP12 in NAFLD has yet to be clarified. Here, we reveal that DUSP12 protects against hepatic steatosis and  in L02 cells after /oleic  treatment. We demonstrate that hepatocyte specific DUSP12-deficient mice exhibit high-fat diet (HFD)-induced and high-fat high-cholesterol diet-induced hyperinsulinemia and liver steatosis and decreased insulin sensitivity. Consistently, DUSP12 overexpression in hepatocyte could reduce HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and . At the molecular level, steatosis in the absence of DUSP12 was characterized by elevated apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), which mediates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and hepatic metabolism. DUSP12 physically binds to ASK1, promotes its dephosphorylation, and inhibits its action on ASK1-related proteins, JUN N-terminal kinase, and p38 MAPK in order to inhibit lipogenesis under high-fat conditions.

Some mice develop diet-induced obesity (DIO), but others remain diet resistant (DR) despite intake of the same high-saturated-fat diet, a phenomenon that mimics characteristics of the human obese phenotype. Microbiota-colon-brain axis regulation is important for energy metabolism and cognition. Using DIO and DR mouse models, this study aimed to examine gut microbiota, colonic inflammation and cognitive function to elucidate the role of microbiota-gut-brain regulation in DIO. C57Bl6/J mice fed a chronic saturated- diet for 22 weeks showed significant body weight gain differences, with the top one third gaining 48% heavier body weight than the lower one third. There was significant reduction in gut microbiota richness and diversity in DIO mice but not in DR mice. At the phylum level, DIO mice had increased abundance of Firmicutes and Antinobacteria, and decreased abundance of Bacterioides and Proteobacteria in gut microbiota. DIO mice exhibited reduced  proteins, increased plasma endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and increased inflammation in the colon and liver. Recognition memory and spatial memory were impaired in DIO mice, associated with decreased Bacteroidetes. Further examination showed that hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor was significantly decreased in DIO mice (vs. DR). Conversely, DR mice showed no changes in the above parameters measured. Therefore, gut microbiota, colon inflammation and circulating LPS may play a major role in the development of the obese phenotype and cognitive decline associated with a chronic high-saturated- diet.Copyright © 2018.

Panaxynol was isolated from Saposhnikovia divaricata as an active compound with HMW adiponectin promoting properties. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) agonists are reported to increase the secretion of HMW adiponectin, although the effects of panaxynol were found to be independent of PPARγ activation. When the underlying mechanisms were further examined, panaxynol was found to inhibit the -induced downregulation of forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) protein, and the anti-lipotoxic effects were abolished by a FoxO1 inhibitor.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) levels were measured using DCF and JC-1 assay. Cytokine levels were evaluated using ELISA assay. Immunoblot was used to compare the activation level of c-Jun N terminal kinase (JNK), NADPH oxidase (Nox4), and NFκB pathways.Addition of SF preparation prevented PA-mediated increase of apoptosis and iTG as well as IL-8 and IL-6. In PA-treated cell, SF preparation reduced the level of Nox4 and ROS, while increasing the level of MMP and the expression of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and catalase, indicating emendation of mitochondrial dysfunction. Nox4 inhibitor GKT137381 prevented PA-induced increase of ROS and apoptosis, while decreasing iTG slightly and not influencing the level of IL-8 and IL-6. SF preparation prevented PA-induced upregulation of phospho-JNK. JNK inhibitor SP600125 prevented PA-mediated increase of Nox4, IL-8, IL-6 and iTG. Nuclear translocation of NFκB/p65 was detected in PA-treated cells, which was prevented by SF preparation. An IκB degradation inhibitor, BAY11-7082, prevented PA-induced increase of IL-8 and IL-6 as well as iTG, whereas it only decreased ROS levels slightly and showed no influence on cellular apoptosis.SF preparation shows a beneficial role in prevention of hepatocyte injury by attenuating oxidative stress and cytokines production at least partially through inhibition of JNK/Nox4 and JNK/NFκB pathway, respectively.© 2018 The Author(s).

We hypothesized that the uptake and incorporation of FAs and POA synthesis are reduced in primary human trophoblasts (PHTs) isolated from pregnancies complicated by maternal obesity. Villous cytotrophoblasts were isolated from 7 placentas of obese [body mass index (BMI) = 37.5 ± 1.9] and 12 normal (BMI = 23.6 ± 0.6) mothers. FA uptake and incorporation were assessed using uniformly labeled (U[C])-FA mixtures of PA, oleic  (OA), linoleic , and docosahexaenoic . Cellular [C] FAs were quantified both in total cellular lipids and in lipid classes by GC-MS. Uptake and incorporation of [C] FAs in total cellular lipids were not different in PHTs isolated from obese mothers compared with normal mothers. Only the concentration of OA was increased in the triglyceride fraction ( < 0.05) if the mother was obese. We found an isotopic enrichment of POA after U[C]-PA treatment, demonstrating SCD activity in PHT cells. Labeled POA content and the POA:PA ratio were significantly lower in PHTs isolated from placentas of obese mothers compared with normal, healthy controls. Decreased syncytiotrophoblast POA synthesis may contribute to insulin resistance and low-grade  in the mother, placenta, or fetus (or a combination of the 3) in pregnancies complicated by obesity.-Ferchaud-Roucher, V., Barner, K., Jansson, T., Powell, T.

In 3T3-L1 cells, the cytotoxicity of QWTX was tested by CKK-8, and glucose uptake and fat  oxidation were assessed by 2-deoxy-D-[H] glucose and [1-C] , respectively. The expression levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1), liver X receptor α (LXRα), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), ikappa B α (IκBα), and AKT were determined by PCR and western blot. NAFLD was established by the administration of fat emulsion and sucrose for 9 weeks. The effects of QWTX on lipid metabolism, liver function, and hepatic morphology were observed in NAFLD rats by HE and transmission electron microscope. Serum level of nitric oxide (NO) and fee fatty  (FFA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in the liver, as well as the expression levels of Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), NF-κB, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), CPT-1, LXRα, PPARα, PPARβ/δ, PPARγ, and iNOS were all detected.QWTX showed no cell cytotoxicity in 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells, and increased the CO production rate to 4.15, which indicated the reducing the fatty accumulation. In NAFLD, QWTX attenuated liver steatosis, fat vacuoles and  from the HE staining and electron micrograph tests. For the oxidative stress biomarkers, serum FFA level was reduced and serum NO level was enhanced after QWTX treatment. In liver tissue, SOD was decreased and MDA was significantly increased in NAFLD, and both of them were restored by QWTX. NF-κB and CYP2E1 were also upregulated in NAFLD, while downregulated by QWTX. Downregulation of LXRα, PPARγ and iNOS by QWTX were both observed in the 3T3-L1 adipocytes and NAFLD model.QWTX protected the liver injury in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and NAFLD by regulating the LXRα, PPARγ, and NF-κB-iNOS-NO signal pathways.Copyright © 2019.

We quantitatively determined 11 FFAs, seven cytokine/adipokine, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and C-peptide levels from the fasting blood samples that were collected at 16 weeks of gestation. Multivariate analyses were performed along with separate analyses for each individual FFA.High HOMA-IR (p<0.001) and C-peptide (p<0.0001) levels were positively associated with a twofold to fourfold increased risk for developing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Negative relationships were found with specific FFAs (molecular percentage, palmitoleic, oleic, linolenic, myristic acids) and HOMA-IR and C-peptide levels (p<0.01 to p<0.0001). In contrast, , stearic, arachidonic, dihomo-γ-linolenic (DGLA) and docosahexaenoic acids were positively associated with HOMA-IR and C-peptide (p<0.01 to p<0.0001). The individual FFAs also predicted cytokine/adipokine levels. For example, women who had elevated DGLA (highest quartile) were twice as (adjusted OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.98) likely to have higher interleukin (IL)-8 (p<0.0001) levels. Conversely, women with high palmitoleic, oleic, and linolenic  levels had reduced odds (≥2-fold, p<0.01 to p<0.001) for having higher IL-8, IL-6 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels.Our results suggest that maternal individual FFAs uniquely affect insulin resistance and secretion. The effects are either direct or indirect via modulation of the inflammatory response. Modifying the composition of FFAs may help in reducing the risk of GDM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31355570>[Psoralen and isopsoralen improve lipid metabolism disorder via inhibition of NF-κB activation in LO2 cells].</a></h2><p>The aim of this paper was to investigate the mechanism and effect of psoralen and isopsoralen in the treatment of lipid accumulation in LO2 cells. Human LO2 cells nonalcoholic fatty liver models were established by using ( PA). Then psoralen and isopsoralen were administered for intervention. Intracellular triglyceride( TG) and total cholesterol( TC) content,the cell supernatant alanine aminotransferase( ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase( AST) levels were determined by enzyme method. Cell supernatant proinflammatory cytokines( IL-6,TNF-α) and chemokines( IL-8,MCP-1) were determined by ELISA method. Western blot method was conducted to detect the protein expression of intracellular nuclear factor( NF-κB) p65 phosphorylation( p-p65),nonphosphorylated protein( p65),and transforming factor TGF-β1. Result showed that as compared with the model group,intracellular TG and TC levels,the cell supernatant ALT and AST levels,proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were decreased( P < 0. 01,P <0. 05); the p-p65/p65 ratio and TGF-β1 protein expression were also significantly decreased( P< 0. 01,P< 0. 05) in psoralen intervention group. As compared with the model cells,intracellular TG content had no significant changes,but all the other indexes were reduced( P<0. 01,P<0. 05) in the cells of isopsoralen intervention group. Psoralen exhibited better effect than isopsoralen( P< 0. 01,P<0. 05). It is concluded that psoralen could improve the adipogenesis of LO2 cells induced by PA; both psoralen and isopsoralen are effective in ameliorating LO2 cells injury induced by PA,reducing  via inhibiting the activation of NF-κB and down-regulating the expression of TGF-β1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625377>Thioacetamide potentiates high cholesterol and high fat diet induced steato-hepatitic changes in livers of C57BL/6J mice: A novel eight weeks model of fibrosing NASH.</a></h2><p>There is an inadequacy of relevant animal models to study non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis.

The FTH mice featured hepatic , severe diffuse fibrosis, and collagen deposition, which were less severe in FF & STH groups. In FTH group the protein expressions of α-SMA, TGF-ß, Col1 A1, CYP2E1, were up-regulated as compared to the FF group. The in-vivo findings were complemented in the LX-2 and Hep3B cells.

Proteomic analysis was carried out to determine if hypothalamic proteins were changed by a HFD. The direct effects of dietary fatty acids on mitochondrial morphology and on one of the proteins most changed by a HFD, dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2 (DRP-2) a microtubule-associated protein which regulates microtubule dynamics, were also tested in mHypoE-N42 (N42) neuronal cells challenged with  (PA) and oleic  (OA).Mice on the HFD, as expected, showed increased adiposity and glucose intolerance. Hypothalamic proteomic analysis revealed changes in 104 spots after 3 days on HFD, which, when identified by LC/MS/MS, were found to represent 78 proteins mainly associated with cytoskeleton and synaptic plasticity, stress response, glucose metabolism and mitochondrial function. Over half of the changed proteins have also been reported to be changed in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Also,in N42 neurons mitochondrial morphology and DRP-2 levels were altered by PA but not by OA.These results demonstrate that within 3 days, there is a relatively large effect of HFD on the hypothalamic proteome indicative of cellular stress, altered synaptic plasticity and mitochondrial function, but not .

Studies have suggested that increased availability of energy metabolites like glucose and saturated fatty acids induces metabolic, oxidative, and mitochondrial stress, accompanied by  that may lead to chronic complications in diabetes. In the present study, we used human hepatoma HepG2 cells to investigate the effects of high glucose (25 mM) and high  (up to 0.3 mM) on metabolic-, inflammatory-, and redox-stress-associated alterations in these cells. Our results showed increased lipid, protein, and DNA damage, leading to caspase-dependent apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction. Glucolipotoxicity increased ROS production and redox stress appeared to alter mitochondrial membrane potential and bioenergetics. Our results also demonstrate the enhanced ability of cytochrome P450s-dependent drug metabolism and antioxidant adaptation in HepG2 cells treated with , which was further augmented with high glucose. Altered NF-kB/AMPK/mTOR-dependent cell signaling and inflammatory (IL6/TNF-α) responses were also observed.

Hypothalamic  has also been related to oxidative stress.  (PA) is the most abundant free fatty  found in food, and in vitro studies indicate that it triggers a pro-inflammatory response in the brain. Melanocortins are neuropeptides with proven anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective action mediated by melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R), but little is known about the effect of melanocortins on oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to investigate whether melanocortins could alleviate oxidative stress induced by a high fat diet (HFD) model. We found that NDP-MSH treatment decreased PA-induced reactive oxygen species production in astrocytes, an effect blocked by the MC4R inhibitor JKC363. NDP-MSH abolished nuclear translocation of Nrf2 induced by PA and blocked the inhibitory effect of PA on superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and glutathione levels while it also per se increased activity of SOD and γ-glutamate cysteine ligase (γ-GCL) antioxidant enzymes. However, HFD reduced hypothalamic MC4R and brain derived neurotrophic factor mRNA levels, thereby preventing the neuroprotective mechanism induced by melanocortins.© 2019 British Society for Neuroendocrinology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31040846>Altered Lipidome Composition Is Related to Markers of Monocyte and Immune Activation in Antiretroviral Therapy Treated Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection and in Uninfected Persons.</a></h2><p> HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy (ART) have both been linked to dyslipidemia and increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.

There is growing evidence indicating that telomerase plays an important role with respect to , especially in the regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression. The present study aimed to evaluate the role of telomerase in an astrocyte cell model treated with  (PA) and tibolone. Cell death, reactive oxygen species production and interleukin-6 expression were evaluated under telomerase inhibition with the BIBR1532 compound in T98G cells treated with tibolone and PA, using fluorometry, flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and the quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results obtained showed that telomerase protein was increased by PA after 36 hours, alone or in combination with tibolone, and that its activity was affected by PA. Telomerase inhibition reduced interleukin-6 expression and it interfered with the protective effects of tibolone on cell death. Moreover, tibolone increased Tyr707 phosphorylation in PA-treated cells. In the present study, we provide novel findings about the regulation of telomerase by PA and tibolone. Telomerase was involved in  by PA and in protective effects of tibolone.

Galectin-3 (Gal-3) induces cardiac  and fibrosis in the context of obesity; however, its role in the metabolic consequences of obesity is not totally established. We have investigated the potential role of Gal-3 in the cardiac metabolic disturbances associated with obesity. In addition, we have explored whether this participation is, at least partially, acting on mitochondrial damage. Gal-3 inhibition in rats that were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 6 weeks with modified citrus pectin (MCP; 100 mg/kg/day) attenuated the increase in cardiac levels of total triglyceride (TG). MCP treatment also prevented the increase in cardiac protein levels of carnitine palmitoyl transferase IA, mitofusin 1, and mitochondrial complexes I and II, reactive oxygen species accumulation and decrease in those of complex V but did not affect the reduction in F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake observed in HFD rats. The exposure of cardiac myoblasts (H9c2) to  increased the rate of respiration, mainly due to an increase in the proton leak, glycolysis, oxidative stress, β-oxidation and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential. Inhibition of Gal-3 activity was unable to affect these changes. Our findings indicate that Gal-3 inhibition attenuates some of the consequences of cardiac lipotoxicity induced by a HFD since it reduced TG and lysophosphatidyl choline (LPC) levels. These reductions were accompanied by amelioration of the mitochondrial damage observed in HFD rats, although no improvement was observed regarding insulin resistance.

Meteorin-like protein (METRNL), a novel secreted protein homologous to the neurotrophin Metrn, is induced after exercise in the skeletal muscle. Herein, we investigated the effects of METRNL on lipid-mediated  and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ). Treatment with METRNL suppressed inflammatory markers, such as nuclear factor κB (NFκB) nuclear translocation, inhibitory κBα (IκBα) phosphorylation, interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as TNFα and MCP-1). METRNL treatment also attenuated the impaired insulin response both in palmitate-treated differentiated C2C12 cells and the skeletal muscle of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Furthermore, METRNL administration rescued glucose intolerance and reduced HFD-induced body weight gain in mice; however, METRNL did not affect calorie intake. METRNL treatment increased AMPK phosphorylation and PPARδ expression both in differentiated C2C12 cells and mouse skeletal muscle. siRNA-mediated suppression of AMPK and PPARδ abrogated the suppressive effects of METRNL on palmitate-induced  and insulin resistance. Moreover, METRNL augmented the mRNA expression of fatty  oxidation-associated genes, such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO), and fatty  binding protein 3 (FABP3). siRNAs for AMPK and PPARδ reversed these changes.

The present study was designed to test whether this NLRP3 inflammasome activation contributes to the "two-hit" injury during nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and whether it can be a therapeutic target for the action of Fufang Zhenzhu Tiaozhi (FTZ), a widely used herbal remedy for hyperlipidemia and metabolic syndrome in China. We first demonstrated that NLRP3 inflammasome formation and activation as well as lipid deposition occurred in the liver of mice on the high-fat diet (HFD), as shown by increased NLRP3 aggregation, enhanced production of IL-1 and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), and remarkable lipid deposition in liver cells. FTZ extracts not only significantly reduced the NLRP3 inflammasome formation and activation but also attenuated the liver steatosis and fibrogenic phenotype changed. In  studies,  (PA) was found to increase colocalization of NLRP3 components and enhanced caspase-1 activity in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), indicating enhanced formation and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes by PA. PA also increased lipid deposition. Nlrp3 siRNA can reverse this effect by silencing the NLRP3 inflammasome and both with FTZ. In FTZ-treated cells, not only inflammasome formation and activation was substantially attenuated but also lipid deposition in HSCs was blocked. This inhibition of FTZ on lipid deposition was similar to the effects of glycyrrhizin, an HMGB1 inhibitor. Mechanistically, stimulated membrane raft redox signaling platform formation and increased O production by PA to activate NLRP3 inflammasomes in HSCs was blocked by FTZ treatment.

In the mouse IR model, the role of differentially expressed Anxa2 in glycometabolism and IR was subsequently detected. To investigate the effect of Anxa2 on IR and its correlation with , a  (PA)-induced IR cell model was established, with the relationship between Anxa2 and the NF-κB signaling pathway investigated accordingly. Anxa2 was determined to be highly expressed in IR. Silencing Anxa2 was shown to inhibit IR triggered by obesity. When Anxa2 was knocked down, elevated expression of phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), IRS1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1a, and glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity along with 2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake was detected, whereas decreased expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3, IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and p50 was observed.

Consistently, levels of serum biochemical, hepatic steatosis, , and apoptosis in MCD-fed mice were exacerbated with RSL-3 treatment. However, MCD-fed mice treated with sodium selenite (a GPX4 activator) showed increase of hepatic GPX4, accompanied by reduced NASH severity. To chelate iron, deferoxamine mesylate salt was used. Administration of deferoxamine mesylate salt significantly reduced NASH severity and abolished the harmful effects of RSL-3 in MCD-fed mice. Finally, treatment with Liproxstatin-1 (a ferroptosis inhibitor) repressed hepatic lipid peroxidation, and its associated cell death, resulting in decreased NASH severity. Consistent with the in vivo findings, modulation of ferroptosis /GPX4 affected hepatocellular death in -induced in vitro NASH milieu. We conclude that GPX4 and its-related ferroptosis might play a major role in the development of NASH.Copyright © 2019.

Fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FIN) and a blood lipid profile were measured. The homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) was used to estimate insulin resistance (IR). Plasma tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL)-6 were determined. PBMCs isolated from healthy subjects were cultured with or without 33.3 mmol/l glucose or 0.5 mmol/l  (PA) for 6 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. The expression of TAp63 at mRNA and protein levels in PBMCs was analyzed using real-time qRT-PCR and western blots, respectively.TAp63 expression was significantly lower in T2DM patients compared with that of the controls. In addition, TAp63 expression showed a negative correlation with FBG, FIN, HbA1c, HOMA-IR, FFAs, TNF-α, and IL-6 levels. Treatment with 33.3 mmol/l glucose or 0.5 mmol/l PA increased TAp63 expression in the cultured PBMCs.TAp63 level may be correlated with chronic inflammatory state and perturbed glucose and lipid metabolism in T2DM.Copyright © 2018.

PAHSA levels are reduced in serum and adipose tissue of insulin-resistant people and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Here, we investigated whether chronic PAHSA treatment enhances insulin sensitivity and which receptors mediate PAHSA effects. Chronic PAHSA administration in chow- and HFD-fed mice raises serum and tissue PAHSA levels ∼1.4- to 3-fold. This improves insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance without altering body weight. PAHSA administration in chow-fed, but not HFD-fed, mice augments insulin and glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) secretion. PAHSAs are selective agonists for GPR40, increasing Ca flux, but not intracellular cyclic AMP. Blocking GPR40 reverses improvements in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in PAHSA-treated chow- and HFD-fed mice and directly inhibits PAHSA augmentation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in human islets. In contrast, GLP-1 receptor blockade in PAHSA-treated chow-fed mice reduces PAHSA effects on glucose tolerance, but not on insulin sensitivity. Thus, PAHSAs activate GPR40, which is involved in their beneficial metabolic effects.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a pleiotropic cytokine frequently featured in stem cell therapy with distinct renotropic benefits. This study aims to define the potential link between human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived mesenchymal stem cells (iPS-MSCs)/bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) and ER stress in lipotoxic kidney injury induced by  (PA) in renal tubular cells and by high-fat diet (HFD) in mice. iPS-MSCs or BM-MSCs alleviated ER stress (by preventing induction of Bip, chop, and unfolded protein response),  (Il6, Cxcl1, and Cxcl2), and apoptosis (Bax/Bcl2 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling-positive cells) in renal cortex of animals exposed to HFD thus mitigating histologic damage and albuminuria, via activating HGF/c-Met paracrine signaling that resulted in enhanced HGF secretion in the glomerular compartment and c-Met expression in the tubules. Coculture experiments identified glomerular endothelial cells (GECs) to be the exclusive source of glomerular HGF when incubated with either iPS-MSCs or BM-MSCs in the presence of PA. Furthermore, both GEC-derived HGF and exogenous recombinant HGF attenuated PA-induced ER stress in cultured tubular cells, and this effect was abrogated by a neutralizing anti-HGF antibody. Taken together, this study is the first to demonstrate that MSCs ameliorate lipotoxic kidney injury via a novel microenvironment-dependent paracrine HGF/c-Met signaling mechanism to suppress ER stress and its downstream pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic consequences.

Calcium (Ca) homeostasis is considered to play a key role in ER stress. Matrine (Mat) has been applied for the treatment of hepatitis B, but its effect on NAFLD is still unknown, and there is no unified view of Mat on the regulation of ER stress in the previous literature.The pharmacological effects were studied in high-fat-diet or methionine-choline-deficient diet induced C57BL/6J mice models and in  (PA) induced L02 human liver cell model. Calcium fluorescence experiments, computational virtual docking analysis and biochemical assays were used in identifying the locus of Mat.The results showed that Mat-treated mice were more resistant to steatosis in the liver than vehicle-treated mice and that Mat significantly reduced hepatic , lipid peroxides. The beneficial effect of Mat was associated with suppressing ER stress and restoring mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, Mat decreased the PA-induced lipid accumulation, ER stress and cytosolic calcium level ([Ca]) in hepatocyte cell lines in low and middle dose. However, the high dose Mat did not show satisfactory results in cell model. Calcium fluorescence experiments showed that Mat was able to regulate [Ca]. By computational virtual docking analysis and biochemical assays, Mat was shown to influence [Ca] via direct inhibition of SERCA.The results showed that the bi-directional regulation of Mat to endoplasmic reticulum at different doses was based on the inhibition of SERCA. In addition, the results also provide a theoretical basis for Mat as a potential therapeutic strategy in NAFLD/NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30262993>Polydatin attenuates diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and fibrosis in mice.</a></h2><p> Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterized by lipid accumulation in hepatocytes and inflammatory cell infiltration. In view of the anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of polydatin, the current study aimed to investigate the pharmacological effects of polydatin on NASH and its related fibrosis.  C57BL/6 mice were fed with methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet to induce NASH and liver fibrosis, and treated with or without polydatin (5 mg/kg, every other day, i.p) for 4 weeks. HepG2 cells induced by  (PA) were treated with polydatin.  The elevations of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), active caspase-3, TUNEL-positive cells, and triglyceride content were decreased by polydatin treatment. In addition, administration of polydatin to MCD-fed mice reduced oxidative stress by down-regulating NOX4 enzymes. Furthermore, the reduction in  and CD68 macrophage activation correlated with inhibition of toll-like receptor (TLR)-4/NF-κB p65 signaling pathway by polydatin treatment. Polydatin also attenuated lipid accumulation,  and apoptosis in HepG2 cells challenged by  (PA) combined with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Finally, the reduction of hepatic fibrosis by polydatin treatment corresponded to a reduction in hepatic gene expression of fibrosis markers.  These results suggest that polydatin prevents NASH and fibrosis via inhibition of oxidative stress and , highlighting polydatin as a potential therapeutic agent for prevention and treatment of NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29263047>Nicotinic  Receptor GPR109A Exerts Anti-Inflammatory Effects Through Inhibiting the Akt/mTOR Signaling Pathway in MIN6 Pancreatic β cells.</a></h2><p>We found that activation of the nicotinic  receptor GPR109A, expressed by the MIN6 murine pancreatic β cell line, inhibits nitric oxide accumulation induced by IFN-γ and TNF-α, implicating an anti-inflammatory effect of GPR109A in MIN6 cells.

Clinopodium chinense (Benth.) O. Kuntze has been shown to lower blood glucose and attenuate high glucose-induced vascular endothelial cells injury. In the present study we investigated the effects of ethyl acetate extract of C. chinense (CCE) on PA-induced  and IR in the vascular endothelium and its molecular mechanism. We found that CCE significantly inhibited PA-induced toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Consequently, this led to the inhibition of the following downstream adapted proteins myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88, Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-  and TNF receptor-associated factor 6. Moreover, CCE inhibited the phosphorylation of Ikappa B kinase  , nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-  B), c-Jun N-terminal kinase, extracellular regulated protein kinases, p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and subsequently suppressed the release of tumor necrosis factor-  , interleukin-1  (IL-1  ) and IL-6. CCE also inhibited IRS-1 serine phosphorylation and ameliorated insulin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Moreover, CCE restored serine/threonine kinase and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation and thus increased insulin-mediated nitric oxide (NO) production in PA-treated HUVECs. This led to reverse insulin mediated endothelium-dependent relaxation, eNOS phosphorylation and NO production in PA-treated rat thoracic aortas. These results suggest that CCE can significantly inhibit the inflammatory response and alleviate impaired insulin signaling in the vascular endothelium by suppressing TLR4-mediated NF-  B and MAPK pathways. Therefore, CCE can be considered as a potential therapeutic candidate for endothelial dysfunction associated with IR and diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30820195>Tetrahydroxy stilbene glucoside alleviates -induced  and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes by regulating miR-129-3p/Smad3 signaling.</a></h2><p>Tetrahydroxy stilbene glucoside (TSG) has been reported to exert a cytoprotective effect against various toxicants. However, the function and mechanism of TSG in  (PA)-induced  and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes are still unknown. The present study was designed to investigate the post-transcriptional mechanism in TSG-treated cardiomyocytes'  and apoptosis induced by PA.The mRNA and protein levels were assayed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blotting, respectively. The targeted genes were predicted by a bioinformatics algorithm and confirmed by a dual luciferase reporter assay. Cell proliferation was analyzed by CCK-8 assay. Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/polyimide (annexin V-FITC/PI) staining was used to evaluate apoptosis using flow cytometry.TSG restricted the detrimental effects, including the activated inflammatory response and apoptosis, of PA in cardiomyocytes, as well as the up-regulation of miR-129-3p and down-regulation of p-Smad3 expression. In addition, bioinformatics and experimental analysis suggested that Smad3 was a direct target of miR-129-3p, which could inhibit or enhance the expression of p-Smad by transfection with miR-129-3p mimics or inhibitors, respectively. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that overexpression of Smad3 reversed the inhibition of  and apoptosis by overexpression of miR-129-3p in PA-stimulated cardiomyocytes.TSG targeted to miR-129-3p/Smad3 signaling inhibited PA-induced  and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31236740>Untargeted metabolomic analysis of coronary artery disease patients with diastolic dysfunction show disturbed oxidative pathway.</a></h2><p>Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) is common in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) with prevalence estimates of 34% and constitutes a predictor of all-cause mortality. Although diastolic dysfunction is induced by myocardial ischemia and has been shown to alter the clinical course, the role of coronary artery disease in the diastolic dysfunction and its progression into heart failure has not been completely elucidated.The present study was conducted to identify possible metabolites in coronary artery disease patients that are differentially regulated in patients with diastolic dysfunction.The serum of CAD (n = 75) patients and young healthy volunteers (n = 43) were analysed by using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique. Pre-processing of data results in 1547 features; among them 1064 features were annotated using NIST library.Fifteen metabolites were found to be statistically different between cases and control. Variation in metabolites were identified and correlated with several clinically important echocardiography parameters i.e. LVDD grades, ejection fraction (EF) and E/e' values. The results suggested that metabolic products of fatty  oxidation and glucose oxidation pathways such as oleic , stearic , , linoleic , galactose, pyruvic and lactic acids are predominantly up regulated in patients with coronary artery disease and severity of diastolic dysfunction appears to be linked to increase in fatty  oxidation and .

Low molecular weight fucoidan (LMWF), a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from brown seaweeds, has shown strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, which has not been explored in diabetes-induced NAFLD. Therefore, the present study sought to determine whether LMWF protects obese diabetic db/db mice against NAFLD. Results showed LMWF administration decreased plasma level of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total cholesterol, and triglyceride, as well as alleviated hepatic accumulation of triglyceride and total cholesterol in db/db mice. LMWF also ameliorated hepatic oxidative stress by suppressing superoxide production and lipid peroxidation, and increasing catalase and superoxide dismutase activity in the liver of db/db mice. Furthermore, LMWF down-regulated several pro-inflammatory cytokines and transcription factor, and up-regulated the anti-inflammatory adiponectin. These changes were accompanied by the activation of hepatic SIRT1/AMPK/PGC1α signaling with LMWF treatment. In addition, blocking SIRT1 or AMPK by inhibitor notably abolished LMWF-elicited protection against -induced oxidative stress and  in hepatocytes. These results suggest LMWF prevents NAFLD in db/db mice by activation of SIRT1/AMPK/PGC1α signaling pathway, which prevents lipotoxicity-related oxidative stress and . Therefore, LMWF provides a potential supplementary treatment for obesity/diabetes-induced NAFLD.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

SD rats were fed with high fat diet (HFD) to induce NASH. From the 16th w, the HFD was full or half replaced by olive oil to observe the protective effects.In vitro, OA substantially alleviated PA induced cellular apoptosis, oxidative stress, ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as  in hepatocytes. In vivo, only olive oil supplementation had no detrimental effects, while HFD developed NASH in normal rats. Full replacement of HFD with olive oil had profoundly reversed NASH. Noteworthily, half replacement of HFD with olive oil (a mixed diet) has ameliorated NASH injury as well. It strikingly changed the hepatic histology from macrovesicular-steatosis into entire microvesicular-steatosis, and significantly reduced , ballooning and fibrosis.Our study has demonstrated in both hepatocytes and NASH rats that oleic acids had great potential to combat the saturated fatty acids induced hepatic lipotoxicity. Only half replacement of HFD by monounsaturated fatty acids rich diet still had significant therapeutic outcome in NASH rats. Redirecting the toxic saturated fatty acids into triglyceride storage and reduction of cholesterol accumulation might be the possible explanation of OA driven protection in this scenario.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Although it is known that SFA or LPS promote hepatic , a hallmark of NAFLD, it remains unclear how SFA in combination with LPS stimulates host inflammatory response in hepatocytes. In this study, we performed both in vivo and in vitro experiments to investigate the effect of SFA in combination with LPS on proinflammatory gene expression in hepatocytes. Our animal study showed that feeding low-density lipoprotein-deficient mice HFD enriched with SFA and injection of low-dose LPS cooperatively stimulated IL-6 expression in livers. To understand how SFA and LPS interact to promote IL-6 expression, our in vitro studies showed that  (PA), a major SFA, and LPS exerted synergistic effect on the expression of IL-6 in hepatocytes. Furthermore, coculture of hepatocytes with macrophages resulted in a greater IL-6 expression than culture of hepatocytes without macrophages in response to the combination of PA and LPS.

Previous studies have shown that PA exerts proinflammatory actions and reduces cell viability in astrocyte cultures. In this study, we have assessed whether an alteration in autophagy is involved in the effects of PA on astrocytes. Primary astrocytes were obtained from the cerebral cortex of male and female CD1 mouse pups and were incubated for 4.5 or 24 h with 250-500 μM PA. PA increased the levels of LC3-II, an autophagosome marker, and reduced LC3-II flux in astrocytes, suggesting a blockade of autophagy. This effect was observed both after 4.5 and 24 h of treatment with PA. PA had additional effects after treatment for 24 h, increasing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, decreasing cell viability, and increasing the levels of an endoplasmic reticulum stress marker. In addition, PA decreased the expression of estrogen receptors, but only in female astrocytes. However, the treatment with estradiol, estrogen receptor agonists, or inhibitor of estradiol synthesis did not counteract the action of PA on cell viability. Rapamycin, an autophagy inducer, was unable to prevent the effect of PA on cell viability. In addition, hydroxychloroquine, an autophagy blocker, did not cause per se astrocyte death. These findings suggest that the effect of PA on autophagy is not sufficient to induce astrocyte loss, which is only observed when prolonged PA treatment causes other alterations in astrocytes, such as increased  and endoplasmic reticulum stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29434805>Overexpression of heart-type fatty  binding protein enhances fatty -induced podocyte injury.</a></h2><p>Deregulated lipid metabolism is a characteristic of metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes and obesity, and likely contributes to podocyte injury and end-stage kidney disease. Heart-type fatty  binding protein (H-FABP) was reported to be associated with lipid metabolism. The present study investigated whether H-FABP contributes to podocyte homeostasis. Podocytes were transfected by lentiviral vector to construct a cell line which stably overexpressed H-FABP. Small interfering RNA capable of effectively silencing H-FABP was introduced into podocytes to construct a cell line with H-FABP knockdown. Certain groups were treated with  (PA) and the fat metabolism, as well as inflammatory and oxidative stress markers were measured. PA accelerated lipid metabolism derangement, inflammatory reaction and oxidative stress in podocytes. Overexpression of H-FABP enhanced the PA-induced disequilibrium in podocytes. The mRNA and protein expression levels of acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 3 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1, and the protein expression levels of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and 4-hydroxynonenal were upregulated in the H-FABP overexpression group, while the mRNA and protein expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α was downregulated. Knockdown of H-FABP inhibited the PA-induced injury and lipid metabolism derangement, as well as the inflammatory reaction and oxidative stress in podocytes. These results indicated that overexpression of H-FABP enhances fatty -induced podocyte injury, while H-FABP inhibition may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for the prevention of lipid metabolism-associated podocyte injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29853224>Wnt7a promotes wound healing by regulation of angiogenesis and : Issues on diabetes and obesity.</a></h2><p>Diabetic skin heals wounds poorly.

Impaired wound healing was also observed in DM and HF groups. The healing rate significantly accelerated after localized injection with Wnt7a at d10. Moreover, the expression of CD31, eNOS phosphorylation and NO were increased; the reduction of local neutrophils influx, ICAM-1 and IL-6/8 expression levels were obvious especially in diabetic with obesity rats at d10 after Wnt7a treatment.This study indicates the potential role of Wnt7a, which is beneficial for regeneration of damaged vessels, moderation of inflammatory statement in diabetic wound healing with or without obesity, thus demonstrating its possible utility as a topical administration to promote healing rate.Copyright © 2018.

This study aims to delineate how mitophagy affects NLRP3 inflammasome activation in hepatic lipotoxicity. Mice were fed a high fat/calorie diet (HFCD) for 24 weeks. Primary rat hepatocytes were treated with  (PA) for various periods of time. Mitophagy was measured by protein levels of LC3II and P62. NLRP3, caspase-1, interleukin (IL)-18, and IL-1β at mRNA and protein levels were used as indicators of inflammasome activation. Along with steatotic progression in HFCD-fed mice, ratio of LC3II/β-actin was decreased concurrently with increased levels of liver P62, NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-1β, IL-18, and serum IL-1β levels in late-stage NASH. PA treatment resulted in mitochondrial oxidative stress and initiated mitophagy in primary hepatocytes. The addition of cyclosporine A did not change LC3II/Τοmm20 ratios; but P62 levels were increased after an extended duration of PA exposure, indicating a defect in autophagic activity. Along with impaired mitophagy, mRNA and protein levels of NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-18 and IL-1β were upregulated by PA treatment. Pretreatment with MCC950, N-acetyl cysteine or acetyl-L-carnitine reversed inflammasome activation and a pyroptotic cascade. Additionally, mitophagic flux was partially recovered as indicated by increases in LC3II/Tomm20 ratio, parkin, and PINK1 expression, and decreased P62 expression. The findings suggest that impaired mitophagy triggers hepatic NLRP3 inflammasome activation in a murine NASH model and primary hepatocytes. The new insights into inflammasome activation through mitophagy advance our understanding of how fatty acids elicit lipotoxicity through oxidant stress and autophagy in mitochondria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30086884>Caveolin-1 prevents palmitate-induced NF-κB signaling by inhibiting GPRC5B-phosphorylation.</a></h2><p>Tyrosine phosphorylation of GPRC5B and phosphorylation-dependent recruitment of Fyn through the SH2 domain have been implicated in NF-κB activation and obesity-linked adipose . GPRC5B tightly associates with caveolin-1 (Cav1); however, the role of this interaction remains elusive. Here, we report that Cav1 reduces GPRC5B-mediated NF-κB signaling by blocking GPRC5B-phosphorylation. We demonstrate highly abundant tyrosine phosphorylation of GPRC5B is observed in Neuro2a cells lacking endogenous Cav1 expression. Reversely, exogenous expression of Cav1 in these cells inhibits GPRC5B-phosphorylation. Although GPRC5B lacks conventional caveolin-binding motif, cytoplasmic tail of GPRC5B directly interacts with the C-terminal domain of Cav1. The vacant scaffolding domain of Cav1 in the protein complex suggests a potential mechanism for blocking GPRC5B-phosphorylation by Cav1, because Fyn loses the activity by binding with Cav1-scaffolding domain. Enhanced GPRC5B-mediated NF-κB signaling in Cav1-deficient cells were observed under palmitate-induced metabolic stress. These results support Cav1 functions as a negative modulator for GPRC5B action.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Mechanisms responsible for the occurrence of the pDSPN are multifactorial and involve metabolic pathways regulating , microvessel circulation, axonal degeneration and so on. Several therapeutic approaches have been proposed to treat pain and each of them showed positive effects associated to drug-related side effects.Twenty-five consecutive patients with diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and pDSPN and tried to manage pain with a dietary supplement composed of a mixture of natural extracts (β-caryophyllene, myrrh, carnosic ) and PEA. This is a nutraceutical with potential multiple effects on metabolic, pain and vascular compartments, a profile considered useful in pDSPN. Patients were enrolled and polyneuropathy evaluated by means of nerve conduction study. Pain was assessed using VAS score scale and MNSI. Each patient was evaluated at T0 (time of enrollment) and at T1 (after 16 weeks of treatment).Supplement administration was well tolerated and induced unexpectedly significant amelioration of polyneuropathy with increase amplitude and reduction of pain. No side effects were reported.This fixed combination could well be considered as a potential nutraceutical option to manage pDSPN in diabetic patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29331316>Pharmacological activities of the organic extracts and fatty  composition of the petroleum ether extract from Haplophyllum tuberculatum leaves.</a></h2><p>Haplophyllum tuberculatum is used in traditional medicine to treat many disorders including  and pain.

We studied the long-term diabetic risk in GDM offspring and evaluated the effect of n-3 PUFA intervention. Healthy offspring rats were fed standard diet (soybean oil) after weaning. GDM offspring were divided into three groups: GDM offspring (soybean oil), n-3 PUFA adequate offspring (fish oil), and n-3 PUFA deficient offspring (safflower oil), fed up to 11 months old. The diabetic risk of GDM offspring gradually increased from no change at weaning to obvious impaired glucose and insulin tolerance at 11 months old. N-3 PUFA decreased oxidative stress and  in the liver of older GDM offspring. There was a differential effect of n-3 PUFA and n-6 PUFA on hepatic telomere length in GDM offspring. Non-targeted metabolomics showed that n-3 PUFA played a modulating role in the liver, in which numerous metabolites and metabolic pathways were altered when GDM offspring grew to old age. Many metabolites were related to diabetes risk, such as α-linolenic , , ceramide, oxaloacetic , tocotrienol, tetrahydro-11-deoxycortisol, andniacinamide.

Chest digital radiography and laboratory tests were also conducted.Two of the four patients did not survive the clinical treatments with antiviral medication, steroids, and oxygen therapy. Biopsy revealed disrupted expression of genes associated with lung epithelial integrity. Histopathological analysis demonstrated severe lung  after H7N9 infection. Metabolomic analysis indicated that fatty  metabolism may be inhibited during H7N9 infection. Serum levels of , erucic , and phytal may negatively correlate with the extent of lung  after H7N9 infection.

Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) have recently been identified as important regulators of immunity and . In nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), HIF-1α is upregulated in hepatocytes, where it induces steatosis; however, the role of HIF-1α in macrophages under metabolic stress has not been explored. In this study, we found increased HIF-1α levels in hepatic macrophages in methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet-fed mice and in macrophages of patients with NASH compared with controls. The HIF-1α increase was concomitant with elevated levels of autophagy markers BNIP3, Beclin-1, LC3-II, and p62 in both mouse and human macrophages. LysM HIF fl/fl mice, which have HIF-1α levels stabilized in macrophages, showed higher steatosis and liver  compared with HIF fl/fl mice on MCD diet. In vitro and ex vivo experiments reveal that saturated fatty ,  (PA), both induces HIF-1α and impairs autophagic flux in macrophages. Using small interfering RNA-mediated knock-down and overexpression of HIF-1α in macrophages, we demonstrated that PA impairs autophagy via HIF-1α. We found that HIF-1α mediates NF-κB activation and MCP-1 production and that HIF-1α-mediated impairment of macrophage autophagy increases IL-1β production, contributing to MCD diet-induced NASH. Conclusion:  impairs autophagy via HIF-1α activation in macrophages. HIF-1α and impaired autophagy are present in NASH in vivo in mouse macrophages and in human blood monocytes. We identified that HIF-1α activation and decreased autophagic flux stimulate  in macrophages through upregulation of NF-κB activation. These results suggest that macrophage activation in NASH involves a complex interplay between HIF-1α and autophagy as these pathways promote proinflammatory overactivation in MCD diet-induced NASH.© 2018 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30388381>Modification of gene expression in rat cardiomyocytes by linoleic and docosahexaenoic acids .</a></h2><p>Regulation of cardiac fatty  metabolism is central to the development of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. We investigated the effects of select fatty acids on the expression of genes involved in immediate early as well as inflammatory and hypertrophic responses in adult rat cardiomyocytes. Cardiac remodeling begins with upregulation of immediate early genes for c-fos and c-jun, followed by upregulation of inflammatory genes for nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT). At later stages, genes involved in hypertrophic responses, such as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), are upregulated. Adult rat cardiomyocytes were treated with , a saturated fatty ; oleic , a monounsaturated fatty ; linoleic , a polyunsaturated fatty  belonging to the n-6 class; and docosahexaenoic , a polyunsaturated fatty  belonging to the n-3 class. Linoleic  produced a greater increase in the mRNA expression of c-fos, c-jun, NF-κB, NFAT3, ANP, and BNP relative to  and oleic .

Considering that endothelial dysfunction induced by Angiotensin II plays an important role in the pathogenesis of hypertension and is accompanied by a prooxidative condition, which in turn induces an inflammatory state, vascular remodeling, and tissue damage, and that S. edule has been reported to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antihypertensive activity, its capability to control endothelial dysfunction was also assessed.To assess in vivo the anti-endothelial dysfunction activity of the acetone fraction (rSe-ACE) of the hydroalcoholic extract from S. edule roots.Endothelial dysfunction was induced in female C57BL/6 J mice by a daily intraperitoneal injection of angiotensin II for 10 weeks. Either rSe-ACE or losartan (as a control) were co-administered with angiotensin II for the same period. Blood pressure was measured at weeks 0, 5, and 10. Kidney extracts were prepared to determine IL1β, IL4, IL6, IL10, IL17, IFNγ, TNFα, and TGFβ levels by ELISA, along with the prooxidative status as assessed by the activity of antioxidant enzymes.

Treatment is still suboptimal. Dosage of urate-lowering therapy is often too low to reach target urate levels, and adherence to therapy is poor. In this study, we therefore explore a new treatment option to limit  in acute gout: specific histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition.Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were cultured with a combination of monosodium urate crystals (MSU) and  (C16.0) in order to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and induce IL-1β production. HDAC inhibitors and other compounds were added beforehand with a 1-h pre-incubation period.The HDAC1/2 inhibitor romidepsin was most potent in lowering C16.0+MSU-induced IL-1β production compared to other specific class I HDAC inhibitors. At 10 nM, romidepsin decreased IL-1β, IL-1Ra, IL-6, and IL-8 production. IL-1β mRNA was significantly decreased at 25 nM. Although romidepsin increased PTEN expression, PBMCs from patients with germline mutations in PTEN still responded well to romidepsin. Romidepsin also increased SOCS1 expression and blocked STAT1 and STAT3 activation. Furthermore, experiments with bortezomib showed that blocking the proteasome reverses the cytokine suppression by romidepsin.Our results show that romidepsin is a very potent inhibitor of C16.0+MSU-induced cytokines in vitro. Romidepsin upregulated transcription of SOCS1, which was shown to directly target inflammatory signaling molecules for proteasomal degradation. Inhibiting the proteasome therefore reversed the cytokine-suppressive effects of romidepsin. HDAC1/2 dual inhibition could therefore be a highly potent new treatment option for acute gout, although safety has to be determined in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629732>Integrated metabolomics and network toxicology to reveal molecular mechanism of celastrol induced cardiotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Celastrol (CS), an active triterpene derived from traditional Chinese medicine Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. f, has been used to treat chronic inflammation, arthritis and other diseases.

Although general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) has been identified as a sensor of amino  availability, it also functions as an important regulator of hepatic lipid metabolism. Our previous studies have reported that GCN2 promotes pressure overload or doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction by increasing cardiomyocyte apoptosis and myocardial oxidative stress. However, the impact of GCN2 on the development of DCM remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of GCN2 on DCM in type 1 and type 2 diabetes animal models. After streptozotocin (STZ) or high-fat diet (HFD) plus low-dose STZ treatments, GCN2 mice developed less cardiac dysfunction, hyperlipidemia, myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, lipid accumulation, oxidative stress,  and apoptosis compared with wild-type (WT) mice. In diabetic hearts, GCN2 deficiency attenuated the upregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and gamma (PPARγ), the phosphorylation of eIF2α and the induction of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), as well as the reduction of Bcl-2. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of GCN2 attenuated, whereas overexpression of GCN2 exacerbated, high glucose or -induced cell death, oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress and lipid accumulation in H9C2 cells. Collectively, our data provide evidence that GCN2 deficiency protects cardiac function by reducing lipid accumulation, oxidative stress and cell death.

Fertility is regulated by hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone, encoded by the Gnrh1 gene. Because obesity promotes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, we sought to determine how tunicamycin-induced ER stress affected Gnrh1 gene expression in the mouse hypothalamic cell line GT1-7. Tunicamycin repressed expression of Gnrh1 in a PKC- and JNK-dependent manner, while upregulating expression of a known Gnrh1 repressor, Fos. Obesity is associated with increased circulating free fatty acids, and exposure to palmitate promoted ER stress and . Fos expression increased with palmitate dose, but Gnrh1 expression was upregulated with low-dose palmitate and repressed with high-dose palmitate. Using a small molecule inhibitor, we determined that AP-1 was required for Gnrh1 repression by high-dose palmitate or tunicamycin-induced ER stress.

In the current study, we investigated the effects of PCW extract on hepatic steatosis under in vitro and in vivo conditions, and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. In this study, a mixture of HepG2 cells treated with free fatty  (FFA)- and oleic -and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed obese mice were used; in this background, the triglyceride (TG) levels in HepG2 cells and mice liver were measured, and the expression levels of genes associated with lipogenesis, fatty  oxidation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and autophagy were determined. Treatment of HepG2 cells with FFA enhanced intracellular TG levels in HepG2 cells, but co-treatment with PCW significantly attenuated the TG levels. Notably, PCW significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) in FFA-treated HepG2 cells. PCW downregulated the expression of lipogenesis-related genes, but upregulated the expression of genes associated with fatty  oxidation. Further, PCW inhibited FFA-induced expression of ER stress markers and induced autophagy proteins. However, inhibition of AMPK significantly attenuated the beneficial effects of PCW in HepG2 cells. Moreover, PCW efficiently decreased HFD-induced hepatic TG accumulation in vivo and increased the phosphorylation of hepatic AMPK. Three compounds present in PCW including poricoic , pachymic , and ergosterol, significantly decreased FFA-induced increase in intracellular TG levels, consistent with increased AMPK phosphorylation, suggesting that poricoic , pachymic , and ergosterol are responsible for PCW-mediated amelioration of hepatic steatosis. Taken together, these results demonstrated that PCW ameliorates hepatic steatosis through the regulation of lipid metabolism, inhibition of ER stress, and activation of autophagy in an AMPK-dependent manner. This suggested that PCW can be potentially used for the treatment of hepatic steatosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29554661>Alkannin Inhibited Hepatic  in Diabetic Db/Db Mice.</a></h2><p>The current study was designed to investigate the protective role of alkannin (ALK) on liver injury in diabetic C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice and explore its potential mechanisms.An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed.

Further, Western blotting analysis showed that the expression of Rho, ROCK1, ROCK2, p-NF-κBp65, and p-IκBα was significantly reversed by ALK treatment. In human hepatic HepG2 cells, the hepatoprotective effects of ALK were further characterized. With response to -challenge, increased amounts of insulin, ALT, AST, TG, and TC were observed, whereas ALK pretreatment significantly inhibited their leakage in HepG2 cells without appreciable cytotoxic effects.

Increased hepatocellular damage was observed in PA-treated hepatocytes with TPM or CSE treatment, but increased triglyceride level was only observed in PA plus LPS-treated hepatocytes with a high concentration of TPM. Also, expression levels of steatohepatitis-related genes such as TNF-α, NOS 2, and SREBP-1c were significantly increased after treatment of TPM. To further demonstrate the role of Kupffer cells (KCs) after CS extracts treatment, trans-well co-culture system of hepatocytes and KCs was utilized. The levels of inflammatory cytokines and the ratios of Bax/Bcl-2 (apoptosis-related genes) were markedly increased in co-cultured hepatocytes after TPM or CSE treatment. Interestingly, KCs activation was augmented in KCs upon treatment with CSE or TPM.

Astragalosides IV (AS-IV) has a variety of pharmacological effects such as anti- and anti-oxidation. In the current study, we investigated the effects of AS-IV on PA-induced apoptosis of HK-2 cells and the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that AS-IV (10, 20, 40 μmol/L) could alleviate PA-induced apoptosis of HK-2 cells. We found that AS-IV reduced the expression of Bax and cleaved-caspase3, but increased the expression of Bcl-2 and phosphorylated Nrf2 in HK-2 cells. Moreover, AS-IV reduced the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cells. Our study suggests that AS-IV could protect against PA-induced apoptosis in HK-2 cells by inhibiting ROS generation and apoptotic protein expression. This study may provide a new theoretical option for the patients with type 2 diabetes.Copyright © 2018.

This causes inflammatory responses, where toll-like receptors (TLR), TLR2 and TLR4, play an important role. Nevertheless,  is not only a TLR agonist. In the cell, this fatty  is converted into phospholipids, diacylglycerol and ceramides. They trigger the activation of various signaling pathways that are common for LPS-mediated TLR4 activation. In particular, metabolic products of  affect the activation of various PKCs, ER stress and cause an increase in ROS generation. Thanks to this,  also strengthens the TLR4-induced signaling. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of inflammatory response induced by . In particular, we focus on describing its effect on ER stress and IRE1α, and the mechanisms of NF-κB activation. We also present the mechanisms of inflammasome NLRP3 activation and the effect of  on enhanced inflammatory response by increasing the expression of FABP4/aP2. Finally, we focus on the consequences of inflammatory responses, in particular, the effect of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 on insulin resistance. Due to the high importance of macrophages and the production of proinflammatory cytokines by them, this work mainly focuses on these cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30019185>Cathepsin B inhibition ameliorates the non-alcoholic steatohepatitis through suppressing caspase-1 activation.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has emerged as the most common chronic liver disease. NLRP3 inflammasome activation has been widely studied in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Cathepsin B (CTSB) is a ubiquitous cysteine cathepsin, and the role of CTSB in the progression and development of NAFLD has received extensive concern. However, the exact roles of CTSB in the NAFLD development and NLRP3 inflammasome activation are yet to be evaluated. In the present study, we used methionine choline-deficient (MCD) diet to establish mice NASH model. CTSB inhibitor (CA-074) was used to suppress the expression of CSTB. Expressions of CTSB and caspase-1 were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. Serum IL-1β and IL-18 levels were also determined.  was used to stimulate Kupffer cells (KCs), and protein expressions of CTSB, NLRP3, ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD), and caspase-1 in KCs were detected. The levels of IL-1β and IL-18 in the supernatant of KCs were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Our results showed that CTSB inhibition improved the liver function and reduced hepatic  and ballooning, and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 were decreased. The expressions of CTSB and caspase-1 in liver tissues were increased in the NASH group. In in vitro experiments, PA stimulation could increase the expressions of CTSB and NLRP3 inflammasome in KCs, and CTSB inhibition downregulated the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome in KCs, when challenged by PA. Moreover, CTSB inhibition effectively suppressed the expression and activity of caspase-1 and subsequently secretions of IL-1β and IL-18. Collectively, these results suggest that CTSB inhibition limits NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent NASH formation through regulating the expression and activity of caspase-1, thus providing a novel anti-inflammatory signal pathway for the therapy of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31393851>Degradation of splicing factor SRSF3 contributes to progressive liver disease.</a></h2><p>Serine rich splicing factor 3 (SRSF3) plays a critical role in liver function and its loss promotes chronic liver damage and regeneration. As a consequence, genetic deletion of SRSF3 in hepatocytes caused progressive liver disease and ultimately led to hepatocellular carcinoma. Here we show that SRSF3 is decreased in human liver samples with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), or cirrhosis that was associated with alterations in RNA splicing of known SRSF3 target genes. Hepatic SRSF3 expression was similarly decreased and RNA splicing dysregulated in mouse models of NAFLD and NASH. We showed that -induced oxidative stress caused conjugation of the ubiquitin like NEDD8 protein to SRSF3 and proteasome mediated degradation. SRSF3 was selectively neddylated at lysine11 and mutation of this residue (SRSF3-K11R) was sufficient to prevent both SRSF3 degradation and alterations in RNA splicing. Finally prevention of SRSF3 degradation in vivo partially protected mice from hepatic steatosis, fibrosis and . These results highlight a neddylation-dependent mechanism regulating gene expression in the liver that is disrupted in early metabolic liver disease and may contribute to the progression to NASH, cirrhosis and ultimately hepatocellular carcinoma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728499>Evidence for an alternative fatty  desaturation pathway increasing cancer plasticity.</a></h2><p>Most tumours have an aberrantly activated lipid metabolism that enables them to synthesize, elongate and desaturate fatty acids to support proliferation. However, only particular subsets of cancer cells are sensitive to approaches that target fatty  metabolism and, in particular, fatty  desaturation. This suggests that many cancer cells contain an unexplored plasticity in their fatty  metabolism. Here we show that some cancer cells can exploit an alternative fatty  desaturation pathway. We identify various cancer cell lines, mouse hepatocellular carcinomas, and primary human liver and lung carcinomas that desaturate palmitate to the unusual fatty  sapienate to support membrane biosynthesis during proliferation. Accordingly, we found that sapienate biosynthesis enables cancer cells to bypass the known fatty  desaturation pathway that is dependent on stearoyl-CoA desaturase. Thus, only by targeting both desaturation pathways is the in vitro and in vivo proliferation of cancer cells that synthesize sapienate impaired. Our discovery explains metabolic plasticity in fatty  desaturation and constitutes an unexplored metabolic rewiring in cancers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29790117>Regulatory roles of miR-155 and let-7b on the expression of -related genes in THP-1 cells: effects of fatty acids.</a></h2><p>The main aim of this investigation was to study the regulatory roles of let-7b and miR-155-3p on the expression of -associated genes in monocytes, macrophages, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages (AcM). A second goal was to analyze the potential modulatory roles of different fatty acids, including oleic, , eicosapentaenoic (EPA), and docosahexaenoic (DHA), on the expression of these miRNAs in the three cell types. This hypothesis was tested in human acute monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1), which were differentiated into macrophages with 2-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and further activated with LPS for 24 h. Monocytes, macrophages, and AcM were transfected with a negative control, or mimics for miR-155-3p and miR-let-7b-5p. The expression of both miRNAs and some proinflammatory genes was analyzed by qRT-PCR. Interestingly, let-7b mimic reduced the expression of IL6 and TNF in monocytes, and SERPINE1 expression in LPS-activated macrophages. However, IL6, TNF, and SERPINE1 were upregulated in macrophages by let-7b mimic. IL6 expression was higher in the three types of cells after transfecting with miR-155-3p mimic. Similarly, expression of SERPINE1 was increased by miR-155-3p mimic in monocytes and macrophages. However, TLR4 was downregulated by miR-155-3p in monocytes and macrophages. Regarding the effects of the different fatty acids, oleic  increased the expression of let-7b in macrophages and AcM and also increased the expression of miR-155 in monocytes when compared with DHA but not when compared with non-treated cells. Overall, these results suggest anti- and proinflammatory roles of let-7b and miR-155-3p in THP-1 cells, respectively, although these outcomes are strongly dependent on the cell type. Noteworthy, oleic  might exert beneficial anti-inflammatory effects in immune cells (i.e., non-activated and LPS-activated macrophages) by upregulating the expression of let-7b.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535458>Role of the mTOR‑FOXO1 pathway in obesity‑associated renal tubulointerstitial .</a></h2><p>Since obesity is largely responsible for the growing incidence of renal tubulointerstitial , exploration into the mechanisms of obesity‑associated tubulointerstitial  is essential. Studies have demonstrated that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a crucial molecule in the pathogenesis of renal , including regulating the expression of inflammatory factors. The purpose of the present study was to further elucidate the role of mTOR in obesity‑associated tubulointerstitial . In the clinical study, obese and healthy subjects were recruited for physical examination, as well as the collection of blood and urine samples. Further study was performed on a high fat diet (HFD)‑induced obese rat model and a cultured human renal tubular epithelial cell line (HK‑2). The clinical study demonstrated that the participants with obesity had increased serum lipids, creatinine (Cr), urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) and urinary neutrophil gelatinase‑associated lipocalin (u‑NGAL). Moreover, the level of urinary monocyte chemoattractant protein‑1 (u‑MCP‑1) was increased in the participants with obesity, and it was positively correlated with free fatty  (FFA), UACR and u‑NGAL. In the in vivo study, the results indicated that the levels of serum lipids, Cr and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), as well as 24 h urine protein and u‑NGAL, were signiﬁcantly increased in the HFD‑fed obese rats. In addition, the infiltration of CD68+ cells into the renal interstitial area and the release of interleukin‑1β (IL‑1β) was observed in the kidneys of obese rats. Meanwhile, the supernatant from HK‑2 cells treated with  stimulated THP‑1 monocyte migration. The upregulation of MCP‑1, phosphorylated forkhead boxO1 (p‑FOXO1), and phosphorylated mTOR (p‑mTOR) was observed in vivo and in vitro. However, inhibition of mTOR was able to alleviate the above effects. Overall, these results demonstrated that activated mTOR induced FOXO1 phosphorylation, which mediates renal MCP‑1 release, causes tubulointerstitial  and ultimately leads to pathological renal changes and dysfunction. However, inhibition of mTOR may play a renoprotective role during the progression of obesity‑associated tubulointerstitial .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30293775>Complement Component C3 Is Highly Expressed in Human Pancreatic Islets and Prevents β Cell Death via ATG16L1 Interaction and Autophagy Regulation.</a></h2><p>We show here that human pancreatic islets highly express C3, which is both secreted and present in the cytosol. Within isolated human islets, C3 expression correlates with type 2 diabetes (T2D) donor status, HbA1c, and . Islet C3 expression is also upregulated in several rodent diabetes models. C3 interacts with ATG16L1, which is essential for autophagy. Autophagy relieves cellular stresses faced by β cells during T2D and maintains cellular homeostasis. C3 knockout in clonal β cells impaired autophagy and led to increased apoptosis after exposure of cells to  and IAPP. In the absence of C3, autophagosomes do not undergo fusion with lysosomes. Thus, C3 may be upregulated in islets during T2D as a cytoprotective factor against β cell dysfunction caused by impaired autophagy. Therefore, we revealed a previously undescribed intracellular function for C3, connecting the complement system directly to autophagy, with a broad potential importance in other diseases and cell types.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, Pck1's role in macrophage metabolism and function is unknown. Using stable isotopomer MS analysis in a mouse model with a myeloid cell-specific  deletion, we show here that this deletion increases the proinflammatory phenotype in macrophages. Incubation of LPS-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) with [U-C]glucose revealed reduced C labeling of citrate and malate and increased C labeling of lactate in Pck1-deleted bone marrow-derived macrophages. We also found that the Pck1 deletion in the myeloid cells increases reactive oxygen species (ROS). Of note, this altered macrophage metabolism increased expression of the M1 cytokines TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6. We therefore conclude that  contributes to M1 polarization in macrophages. Our findings provide important insights into the factors determining the macrophage inflammatory response and indicate that Pck1 activity contributes to metabolic reprogramming and polarization in macrophages.© 2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30552992>Emex spinosa (L.)

It is still being exploited by pharmaceutical companies for its potential remedial effects.In this study, the effects of E. spinosa (L.) Campd. against acute , pain and oxidative damage were evaluated.Total phenols and flavonoids were evaluated. Anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities the E. spinosa ethyl acetate fractions of the aerial (Es EtOAc-AP) and underground (Es EtOAc-R) parts were assessed on carrageenan-induced paw oedema (100 mg/kg BW) and acetic -induced writhing response (50, 100 and 150 mg/kg BW), respectively. The E. spinosa fractions effects on oxidative stress markers and inflammatory parameters were determined. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was performed to identify various chemical components.The ethyl acetate fractions were shown to be the most active thanks to their phenolic and flavonoid contents richness. Intraperitoneal administration of E. spinosa ethyl acetate fractions at 100 mg/kg BW, one hour before carrageenan injection, significantly inhibited the oedema formation by 89.31% and 97.7% for the aerial and underground parts respectively when compared to the reference drug "dexamethasone" (51.9%). Besides, a significant increase (p ≤ 0.001) of the dermal antioxidant enzymes (the superoxide dismutase (SOD)), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) was observed five hours after carrageenan administration. The best restoration was obtained with Es EtOAc-R (82.04%, 93.55% and 93.55% respectively for SOD, CAT and GPx activities). Moreover, EtOAc-fractions treated mice proved their ability to restore both of CRP and fibrinogen (p < 0.001). In addition, E. spinosa EtOAc-fractions attenuated abdominal contractions (p < 0.05) by 71.69% and 82.41% for the aerial part and roots respectively at 150 mg/kg BW against 100% for dichlofenac sodium used as standard drug. The phytochemical analysis of Es EtOAc-AP and Es EtOAc-R by GC-MS may explain the obtained results. The analysis of the fractions demonstrated the presence of  and linoleic acids known for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic capacities.These findings explain the traditional use of E. spinosa in folk medicine and suggest that E. spinosa fractions could be a promising herbal drug.Copyright © 2018.

Herein, early and persistently elevated, proinflammatory cytokine HMGB1 expression was detected in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD model in C57BL/6 mice. The expression and extracellular release of HMGB1 was rapidly and dramatically induced by saturated  in vitro. HFD-induced inflammatory response and liver function impairment were both mitigated after the inhibition of endogenous HMGB1 by neutralizing antibody in vivo. The up-regulation of HMGB1 was thought to be modified by dual channels: in the transcriptional level, it was regulated by JNK1/JNK2-ATF2 axis; post-transcriptionally, it was regulated by the microRNA (miR)-200 family, especially miR-429. miR-429 liver conditional knockout mice (miR-429), fed either a normal diet or an HFD, showed severe liver  and dysfunction, accompanied by greater expression of HMGB1. Intriguingly, the up-regulation and release of HMGB1 could in turn self-activate TLR4-JNK1/JNK2-ATF2 signaling, thus forming a positive feedback.

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were treated with 1mM  for 48 hours and exposed to 40μM docosahexaenoic  for the next 24 hours. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to measure the expression of PTX3, iNOS, and eNOS. The level of nitric oxide was detected by Griess reagent. The transcription level of genes participating in coagulation and blood pressure was studied by polymerase chain reaction array. Docosahexaenoic  improved the survival rate by reducing apoptosis rate (P < .05). Compared with that of the group given , attenuation of proinflammatory status was indicated by reduced interleukin-6 (P < .05) and prostaglandin E levels. All genes PTX3, iNOS, and eNOS were down-regulated after being exposed to docosahexaenoic . Nitric oxide contents were not changed in cells exposed to docosahexaenoic . Polymerase chain reaction array confirmed the reduction of LPA, PDGFβ, ITGA2, SERPINE1, and FGA after exposure to docosahexaenoic  for 24 hours (P < .05). Docosahexaenoic  had potential to blunt atherosclerotic changes in the modulation of genes controlling blood coagulation, pressure, and platelet function.The current experiment showed that docosahexaenoic  could reverse atherosclerotic changes in human endothelial cells induced by . The increased levels of interleukin-6 and prostaglandin E in atherosclerotic cells were returned to near-to-normal status. Gene expression analysis showed a reduced activity of genes participating in atherosclerotic endothelial cells treated by docosahexaenoic . The expression of genes related to cell clotting activity was also similar to that of normal cells.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31159189>Priming of Hypothalamic Ghrelin Signaling and Microglia Activation Exacerbate Feeding in Rats' Offspring Following Maternal Overnutrition.</a></h2><p>Maternal overnutrition during pregnancy leads to metabolic alterations, including obesity, hyperphagia, and  in the offspring. Nutritional priming of central  and its role in ghrelin sensitivity during fed and fasted states have not been analyzed. The current study aims to identify the effect of maternal programming on microglia activation and ghrelin-induced activation of hypothalamic neurons leading to food intake response. We employed a nutritional programming model exposing female Wistar rats to a cafeteria diet (CAF) from pre-pregnancy to weaning. Food intake in male offspring was determined daily after fasting and subcutaneous injection of ghrelin. Hypothalamic ghrelin sensitivity and microglia activation was evaluated using immunodetection for Iba-1 and c-Fos markers, and Western blot for TBK1 signaling. Release of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1β after stimulation with , oleic, linoleic , or C6 ceramide in primary microglia culture were quantified using ELISA. We found that programmed offspring by CAF diet exhibits overfeeding after fasting and peripheral ghrelin administration, which correlates with an increase in the hypothalamic Iba-1 microglia marker and c-Fos cell activation. Additionally, in contrast to oleic, linoleic, or C6 ceramide stimulation in primary microglia culture, stimulation with  for 24 h promotes TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1β release and TBK1 activation. Notably, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.)  or LPS inoculation for five days promotes daily increase in food intake and food consumption after ghrelin administration. Finally, we found that i.c.v.  substantially activates hypothalamic Iba-1 microglia marker and c-Fos.

Human THP-1 macrophages and primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells exposed to multiple inflammatory crystal types were used to determine the anti-inflammatory potential of omega-3 (OM-3) fatty acids in vitro. Anti-inflammatory effects of OM-3 CA in vivo were tested in rat monosodium urate (MSU) crystal air pouch and rat knee intra-articular MSU injection models. Acute treatment with the OM-3 fatty  docosahexaenoic  suppressed MSU-, cholesterol crystal-, and calcium pyrophosphate crystal-mediated interleukin-1β (IL-1β) production in vitro. In vivo, OM-3 CA dose-dependently reduced crystal-mediated cell migration, exudate volume, and levels of IL-1β and prostaglandin E. Following intra-articular injection of MSU, treatment with OM-3-CA (1 mL/kg) and indomethacin (1 mg/kg) resulted in similar mean reductions in pain (23% and 41%, respectively) and swelling (58% and 50%, respectively), compared with controls. Additionally, in complex formulations of OM-3 fatty acids, high levels of  could reduce the in vivo effect on crystal-mediated IL-1β elevation. OM-3 CA has a broadly efficacious anti-inflammatory effect with a strong exposure-response relationship that could be beneficial in prevention and treatment of crystal arthritis, with potential applications in other IL-1β-mediated diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182969>Caprylic  suppresses  via TLR4/NF-κB signaling and improves atherosclerosis in ApoE-deficient mice.</a></h2><p>As reported previously by our group, medium-chain triglycerides can ameliorate atherosclerosis. Given that TLR4 is closely related to atherosclerosis, we hypothesized herein that caprylic  (C8:0) would suppress  via TLR4/NF-κB signaling and further promote the amelioration of atherosclerosis in apoE- deficient (apoE) mice.Fifty 6-week male apoE mice were randomly allocated into five diet groups: a high-fat diet (HFD) without or with 2% caprylic  (C8:0), capric  (C10:0), stearic  (C18:0), or linolenic  (C18:3). RAW246.7 cells were treated with caprylic  (C8:0), docosahexenoic  (DHA),  (C16:0), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with or without TLR4 knock-down (TLR4-KD). The serum lipid profiles, inflammatory biomolecules, and mRNA and protein expression levels were measured. Atherosclerotic lesions that occurred in the aorta and aortic sinuses were evaluated and quantified.Our results indicated that C8:0 reduced body fat, improved the lipid profiles, suppressed inflammatory cytokine production, downregulated aortic TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB, TNF-α, IKKα, and IKKβ mRNA expression, and alleviated atherosclerosis in the apoE mice ( < 0.05). In RAW 264.7 cells, C8:0 diminished the inflammatory response and both mRNA and protein expression of TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB, and TNF-α compared to those in the LPS and C16:0 groups ( < 0.05). However, in the TLR4-KD RAW 264.7 cells, C8:0 significantly upregulated NF-κB mRNA and protein expression compared to those in the C16:0 and DHA groups.These results suggest that C8:0 functions via TLR4/NF-κB signaling to improve the outcomes of apoE mice through suppressing  and ameliorating atherosclerosis.

Importantly, there are currently no approved treatments available for NAFLD. This study aims to investigate the potential applications of sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate (STS) on improving the NAFLD condition using both in vitro and in vivo approaches. The results showed that STS markedly inhibited lipid accumulation in oleic  (OA) and  (PA) treated HepG2 and primary immortalized human hepatic (PIH) cells. STS suppressed lipogenesis by inhibiting expression of sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1), fatty  synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD). In addition, STS reduced  in cells treated with OA-PA, shown by decreased transcriptional levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) and interleukin 1 beta (IL1B). Consistently, protective effects on hepatic steatosis in db/db mice were observed after STS administration, demonstrated by decreased lipid accumulation in mouse hepatocytes. This protective effect might be associated with STS induced activation of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)/protein kinase AMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha 1 (PRKAA1) pathways. Our findings suggest a potential therapeutic role for STS in the treatment of NAFLD.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..

The current study investigated the effect of exosomes derived from mangiferin‑stimulated PVAT on endothelial function, including regeneration, migration, apoptosis and . The number of exosomes secreted by PVAT was increased by stimulation with mangiferin (0.1, 1 or 10 µM), and uptake of these exosomes by endothelial cells was observed. Exosomes produced by stimulation of PVAT with mangiferin reversed the effects of ‑induced endothelial dysfunction following  (PA) treatment. Furthermore, nuclear factor (NF)‑κB signaling in endothelial cells was significantly increased when treated with PA‑induced PVAT‑derived exosomes, whereas exosomes from the supernatant of PVAT stimulated with mangiferin reduced p65 and p50 phosphorylation levels in the cells, and inhibited p65 transportation to the nucleus.

Previously, we demonstrated that tibolone, a synthetic steroid with estrogenic, progestogenic and androgenic actions, protects cells from mitochondrial damage and morphological changes induced by PA. Here, we have evaluated which estrogen receptor is involved in protective actions of tibolone and analyzed whether tibolone reverses gene expression changes induced by PA. Tibolone actions on astrocytic cells were mimicked by agonists of estrogen receptor α (ERα) and β (ERβ), but the blockade of both ERs suggested a predominance of ERβ on mitochondria membrane potential. Expression analysis showed a significant effect of tibolone on genes associated with  such as IL6, IL1B and miR155-3p. It is noteworthy that tibolone attenuated the increased expression of TERT, TERC and DNMT3B genes induced by . Our results suggest that tibolone has anti-inflammatory effects and can modulate pathways associated with DNA methylation and telomeric complex. However, future studies are needed to elucidate the role of epigenetic mechanisms and telomere-associated proteins on tibolone actions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Pathology of the biological functions of trophology and endoecology is the basis for ischemic heart disease prevention.]</a></h2><p>Atherosclerosis and atheromatosis are different nonphysiological processes with different etiology and pathogenesis. They manifest alterations in different biological functions. According to our original phylogenetic theory of general pathology, atherosclerosis is associated with altered biological function of trophology, eating, biological reaction of exotrophy. Atherosclerosis is induced by eating of nonoptimal for phylogenetically herbivorous Homo sapiens meat diet with high content of  saturated fatty  (SFA), which leads to in vivo formation of phylogenetically early low-efficient  pathway of FA metabolism instead of highly-efficient oleic pathway operating in herbivores. Accumulation of nonligand  very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and low density lipoproteins (LDL) in the bloodstream results from nonphysiological reaction of compensation upon transport of  SFA to cells. An increase in blood content of  triglycerides (TG) and nonligand  VLDLЛ→LDL coincides with the development of hypercholesterolemia: type IV→ type IIb → type V. Atheromatosis compensates changes in lipoproteins by activation of the biological function of endoecology (purity of the extracellular medium) in vivo, thus fulfilling the biological reaction of . This is physiological denaturation of apoВ-100 in nonligand VLDL→LDL by neutrophils via peroxidation, opsonization by the complement components, transcytosis across the endothelial monolayer and removal to the intima of elastic arteries that serves as a collection and utilization pool for phogogens from local intravascular pool of the intercellular medium. Endogenous phlogogens are utilized by phylogenetically early polyfunctional resident macrophages which are small in number and do not proliferate. Blood-borne monocytes-macrophages are also involved in this process, however, they do not express  hydrolase of polyenic cholesteryl esters. Atheromatous masses are partially catabolized polyenic FA esterified by the alcohol cholesterol which were not internalized by cells. Atheromatosis is a process of pathological compensation in the realization of the function of endoecology. Prevention of atherosclerosis and atheromatosis should be based on elimination of the effects produced by a nonphysiological meat diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30668378>Effects of a new compound containing Palmitoylethanolamide and Baicalein in myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion injury in vivo.</a></h2><p>Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is the principal cause of death, happens after prolonged obstruction of the coronary arteries.  The first intervention to limit myocardial damage is directed to restoration of perfusion, to avoid inflammatory response and a significant oxidative stress triggered by infarction. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), is a well-known fatty  amide-signaling molecule that possess an important anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. PEA does not hold the ability to inhibit free radicals formation. Baicalein, a bioactive component isolated from a Chinese herbal medicine, has multiple pharmacological activities, such as a strong anti-oxidative effects.A combination of PEA and Baicalein could have beneficial effects on oxidative stress produced by inflammatory response.In the present study we explored the effects of composite containing PEA and Baicalein in a model of myocardial I/R injury.Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury was induced by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 30 min followed by 2 h of reperfusion. PEA-Baicalein (9:1), was administered (10 mg/kg) 5 min before the end of ischemia and 1 h after reperfusion.In this study, we clearly demonstrated that PEA-Baicalein treatment decreases myocardial tissue injury, neutrophils infiltration, markers for mast cell activation expression as chymase and tryptase and pro-inflammatory cytokines production (TNF-α, IL-1β). Moreover, PEA-Baicalein treatment reduces stress oxidative and modulates Nf-kB and apoptosis pathways.These results support the idea that the association between PEA and Baicalein should be a potent candidate for the treatment of myocardial I/R injury.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

Here, we used an acute  model in which pigs were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and found that hepatic glycolysis and fatty  oxidation are both promoted. Acetyl-proteome profiling of LPS-infected pigs liver showed that inflammatory stress exacerbates the acetylation of mitochondrial proteins. Both mitochondrial glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 2 (GOT2) and malate dehydrogenase 2 (MDH2) were acetylated, and the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS) activity was stimulated to maintain glycolysis. With the use of C-carbon tracing in vitro, acetyl-CoA was found to be mainly supplied by lipid-derived fatty  oxidation rather than glucose-derived pyruvate oxidative decarboxylation, while glucose was mainly used for lactate production in response to inflammatory stress. The results of the mitochondrial experiment showed that acetyl-CoA directly increases MDH2 and, in turn, the GOT2 acetylation level affects MAS activity. Treatment with palmitate in primary hepatocytes from LPS-injected pigs increased the hepatic production of acetyl-CoA, pyruvate, and lactate; MAS activity; and hepatic MDH2 and GOT2 hyperacetylation, while the deficiency of long-chain acetyl-CoA dehydrogenase resulted in the stabilization of these parameters. These observations suggest that acetyl-CoA produced by fatty  oxidation promotes MAS activity and glycolysis via nonenzymatic acetylation during the inflammatory stress response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31004475>Sulforaphane ameliorates high-fat diet-induced spermatogenic deficiency in mice†.</a></h2><p>Sulforaphane (SFN), a dietary isothiocyanate that is mainly found in cruciferous vegetables, possesses anti-oxidative and anticancer activity and modulates . However, little is known about the role of SFN in obesity-related male reproductive defects. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of SFN on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced male spermatogenic impairment and further clarify the possible underlying mechanisms. In this study, 8-week-old mice were randomly divided into four groups. Mice were fed a normal diet or an HFD with or without SFN supplementation. Sulforaphane was subcutaneously injected at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg 5 days/week for 4 weeks beginning 8 weeks after initiation of the HFD. The results demonstrated that SFN could protect against HFD-induced reproductive dysfunction in male mice. Moreover, SFN also improved reproductive ability, as demonstrated by an increased pregnancy rate and decreased embryo resorption rate in comparison to the corresponding HFD group. We also observed a decrease in apoptosis and an attenuation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress after SFN treatment. In vitro studies of mouse and human sperm samples also revealed that SFN protects against the -induced reduction in sperm viability and motility by inhibiting ER stress in an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent manner. AMPK-dependent ER stress attenuation by SFN was further confirmed using AMPK knockout mice. Taken together, these data show that SFN protects against HFD-induced male reproductive dysfunction by inhibiting ER stress and apoptosis. These findings may be helpful for identifying new therapeutic methods to treat male infertility.© The Author(s) 2019.

In atherosclerosis this is associated with dyslipidemia and oxidative stress, but mechanisms linking these phenomena to macrophage activation remain incompletely understood.  To investigate mechanisms linking dyslipidemia, oxidative stress and macrophage activation through modulation of immunemetabolism, and to explore therapeutic potential targeting specific metabolic pathways.  Using a combination of biochemical, immunological, and ex vivo cell metabolic studies, we report that CD36 mediates a mitochondrial metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to superoxide production in response to its ligand, oxLDL. Mitochondrial-specific inhibition of superoxide inhibited oxLDL-induced NF-κB activation and inflammatory cytokine generation. RNAseq, flow cytometry, H-labeled  uptake, lipidomic analysis, confocal and EM imaging, and functional energetics revealed that oxLDL upregulated effectors of long-chain fatty  (FA) uptake and mitochondrial import, while downregulating FA oxidation and inhibiting ATP5A, an electron transport chain (ETC) component. The combined effect is long-chain FA accumulation, alteration of mitochondrial structure and function, repurposing of the ETC to superoxide production, and NF-κB activation. Apoe null mice challenged with high fat diet showed similar metabolic changes in circulating Ly6C monocytes and peritoneal macrophages, along with increased CD36 expression. Moreover, mitochondrial ROS was positively correlated with CD36 expression in aortic lesional macrophages.  These findings reveal that oxLDL/CD36 signaling in macrophages links dys-regulated FA metabolism to oxidative stress from the mitochondria, which drives chronic inflammation. Thus, targeting to CD36 and its downstream effectors may serve as potential new strategies against chronic inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30509266>Soluble epoxide hydrolase derived lipid mediators are elevated in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with sarcoidosis: a cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p>Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory multi-organ disease almost always affecting the lungs. The etiology remains unknown, but the hallmark of sarcoidosis is formation of non-caseating epithelioid cells granulomas in involved organs. In Scandinavia, > 30% of sarcoidosis patients have Löfgren's syndrome (LS), an acute disease onset mostly indicating a favorable prognosis. The impact of dysregulation of lipid mediators, which has been investigated in other inflammatory disorders, is still unknown.Using three different liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry targeted platforms (LC-MS/MS), we quantified a broad suite of lipid mediators including eicosanoids, sphingolipids and endocannabinoids in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from pulmonary sarcoidosis patients (n = 41) and healthy controls (n = 16).A total of 47 lipid mediators were consistently detected in BAL fluid of patients and controls. After false discovery rate adjustment, two products of the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) enzyme, 11,12-dihydroxyeicosa-5,8,14-trienoic  (11,12-DiHETrE, p = 4.4E-5, q = 1.2E-3, median fold change = 6.0) and its regioisomer 14,15-dihydroxyeicosa-5,8,11-trienoic  (14,15-DiHETrE, p = 3.6E-3, q = 3.2E-2, median fold change = 1.8) increased in patients with sarcoidosis. Additional shifts were observed in sphingolipid metabolism, with a significant increase in -derived sphingomyelin (SM16:0, p = 1.3E-3, q = 1.7E-2, median fold change = 1.3). No associations were found between these 3 lipid mediators and LS, whereas levels of SM 16:0 and 11,12-DiHETrE associated with radiological stage (p < 0.05), and levels of 14,15-DiHETrE were associated with the BAL fluid CD4/CD8 ratio.These observed shifts in lipid mediators provide new insights into the pathobiology of sarcoidosis and in particular highlight the sEH pathway to be dysregulated in disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30710016>Interactions of fatty acids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and coxibs with the catalytic and allosteric subunits of cyclooxygenases-1 and -2.</a></h2><p>Prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthases-1 and -2, commonly called cyclooxygenases-1 and -2 (COX-1 and -2), catalyze the committed step in prostaglandin biosynthesis-the conversion of arachidonic  to prostaglandin endoperoxide H Both COX isoforms are sequence homodimers that function as conformational heterodimers having allosteric (Eallo) and catalytic (Ecat) subunits. At least in the case of COX-2, the enzyme becomes folded into a stable Eallo/Ecat pair. Some COX inhibitors ( nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and coxibs) and common fatty acids (FAs) modulate Ecat activity by binding Eallo. However, the interactions and outcomes often differ between isoforms. For example, naproxen directly and completely inhibits COX-1 by binding Ecat but indirectly and incompletely inhibits COX-2 by binding Eallo. Additionally, COX-1 is allosterically inhibited up to 50% by common FAs like , whereas COX-2 is allosterically activated 2-fold by . FA binding to Eallo also affects responses to COX inhibitors. Thus, COXs are physiologically and pharmacologically regulated by the FA tone of the milieu in which each operates-COX-1 in the endoplasmic reticulum and COX-2 in the Golgi apparatus. Cross-talk between Eallo and Ecat involves a loop in Eallo immediately downstream of Arg-120. Mutational studies suggest that allosteric modulation requires a direct interaction between the carboxyl group of allosteric effectors and Arg-120 of Eallo; however, structural studies show some allosterically active FAs positioned in COX-2 in a conformation lacking an interaction with Arg-120. Thus, many details about the biological consequences of COX allosterism and how ligand binding to Eallo modulates Ecat remain to be resolved.© 2019 Smith and Malkowski.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30864239>Serum C16:1n7/C16:0 ratio as a diagnostic marker for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Accurate diagnosis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is clinically important. Therefore, there is a need for easier ways of diagnosing NASH. In this study, we investigated the serum fatty  composition and evaluated the possibility of using the serum fatty  composition as a diagnostic marker of NASH.The subjects were 78 NAFLD patients (non-alcoholic fatty liver [NAFL]: 30, NASH: 48) and 24 healthy individuals. Fatty acids extracted from the liver tissue and serum were identified and quantified by gas chromatography. In addition, we evaluated the relationship between serum and liver tissue fatty  composition, patient background, and liver histology. The diagnostic performance of NASH was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC).The results of the fatty  analysis showed the C16:1n7/C16:0 ratio to have the strongest correlation between serum and liver tissue (r = 0.865, P < 0.0001). The serum C16:1n7/C16:0 ratio in the NASH group was higher compared with that in the NAFL group (P = 0.0007). Evaluation of the association of the serum C16:1n7/C16:0 ratio with liver histology revealed significant correlation with lobular  score, ballooning score, and fibrosis score. The AUROC for predicting NASH in all NAFLD patients was 0.7097. The AUROC was nearly equivalent even when the study subjects were restricted to patients with a fibrosis score ≤ 2 only (AUROC 0.6917).Measuring the serum C16:1n7/C16:0 ratio may be an effective non-invasive method for diagnosing NASH, particularly in its early stages.© 2019 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29857009>Saturated fatty acids, obesity, and the nucleotide oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in asthmatic patients.</a></h2><p>Both obesity and high dietary fat intake activate the nucleotide oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome.We aimed to examine NLRP3 inflammasome activity in the airways of obese asthmatic patients after macronutrient overload and in immune cells challenged by inflammasome triggers.Study 1 was a cross-sectional observational study of nonobese (n = 51) and obese (n = 76) asthmatic adults.

Our study shows that HFD feeding increases β2AR expression in the xenograft tissues of CRC-bearing mouse model; the elevated β2AR expression is reduced when HFD is replaced by control diet, which strongly suggests an association between HFD feeding and β2AR expression in CRC. HFD feeding increases  and stearic  levels in CRC; however, only  increases β2AR expression, which is dependent upon Sp1. β2AR plays the dominant role in promoting CRC cell proliferation among all the β-AR subtypes. More importantly, knockout of β2AR or knockdown of Sp1 abolishes the  increased CRC cell proliferation, suggesting  increases CRC cell proliferation in β2AR-dependent manner. HFD or -rich diet (PAD) also fails to increase the tumor growth in xenograft mouse models bearing β2AR-knockout CRC cells. β2AR promotes CRC growth by increasing the phosphorylation of HSL at the residue S552. The phosphorylated and activated HSL (S552) changes the metabolic phenotype of CRC and increases energy production, which promotes CRC growth. Our study has revealed the unique tumorigenic properties of  in promoting CRC growth, and have delineated the underlying mechanism of action. We are also the first to report the linkage between HFD feeding and β-adrenergic signaling pathway in relation to CRC growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30918325>Human relaxin-2 attenuates hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in mice with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Human relaxin-2 reduces hepatic fibrosis in mice. However, the effects of relaxin-2 on hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in animals with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remain to be elucidated. C57BL/6 mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet were randomly assigned to receive recombinant human relaxin-2 (25 or 75 μg/kg/day) or vehicle for 4 weeks. In HFD-fed mice, relaxin-2 decreased systemic insulin resistance and reduced body weight, epididymal fat mass and serum leptin and insulin concentrations. In livers of HFD-fed mice, relaxin-2 attenuated steatosis and increased phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1, Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and activated genes that regulate fatty  oxidation and suppressed acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Relaxin-2 had no direct anti-steatotic effect on primary mouse hepatocytes, but S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine attenuated -induced steatosis and activated genes regulating fatty  oxidation in hepatocytes. In mice fed an MCD diet, relaxin-2 attenuated steatosis,  and fibrosis. Relaxin-2 increased eNOS and Akt phosphorylation and transcript levels of cytochrome P450-4a10 and decreased acetyl-CoA carboxylase in MCD-fed mouse livers. Moreover, expression levels of Kupffer cell activation, hepatic stellate cell activation and hepatocyte apoptosis were decreased in MCD diet-fed mice receiving relaxin-2. In conclusion, relaxin-2 reduces hepatic steatosis by activating intrahepatic eNOS in HFD-fed mice and further attenuates liver fibrosis in MCD diet-fed mice. Therefore, human relaxin-2 is a potential therapeutic treatment for NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29413957>2-Chlorohexadecanoic  induces ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in brain microvascular endothelial cells.</a></h2><p>Peripheral leukocytes induce blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction through the release of cytotoxic mediators. These include hypochlorous  (HOCl) that is formed via the myeloperoxidase-HO-chloride system of activated phagocytes. HOCl targets the endogenous pool of ether phospholipids (plasmalogens) generating chlorinated inflammatory mediators like e.g. 2-chlorohexadecanal and its conversion product 2-chlorohexadecanoic  (2-ClHA). In the cerebrovasculature these compounds inflict damage to brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVEC) that form the morphological basis of the BBB. To follow subcellular trafficking of 2-ClHA we synthesized a 'clickable' alkyne derivative (2-ClHyA) that phenocopied the biological activity of the parent compound. Confocal and superresolution structured illumination microscopy revealed accumulation of 2-ClHyA in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria of human BMVEC (hCMEC/D3 cell line). 2-ClHA and its alkyne analogue interfered with protein palmitoylation, induced ER-stress markers, reduced the ER ATP content, and activated transcription and secretion of interleukin (IL)-6 as well as IL-8. 2-ClHA disrupted the mitochondrial membrane potential and induced procaspase-3 and PARP cleavage. The protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK) inhibitor GSK2606414 suppressed 2-ClHA-mediated activating transcription factor 4 synthesis and IL-6/8 secretion, but showed no effect on endothelial barrier dysfunction and cleavage of procaspase-3. Our data indicate that 2-ClHA induces potent lipotoxic responses in brain endothelial cells and could have implications in -induced BBB dysfunction.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

However, it is presently unknown whether BACE1 and the product of its activity, soluble APPβ (sAPPβ), contribute to lipid-induced  and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle cells.Studies were conducted in mouse C2C12 myotubes, skeletal muscle from Bace1mice and mice treated with sAPPβ and adipose tissue and plasma from obese and type 2 diabetic patients.We show that BACE1 inhibition or knockdown attenuates palmitate-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, , and insulin resistance and prevents the reduction in Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor γ Co-activator 1α (PGC-1α) and fatty  oxidation caused by palmitate in myotubes. The effects of palmitate on ER stress, , insulin resistance, PGC-1α down-regulation, and fatty  oxidation were mimicked by soluble APPβ in vitro. BACE1 expression was increased in subcutaneous adipose tissue of obese and type 2 diabetic patients and this was accompanied by a decrease in PGC-1α mRNA levels and by an increase in sAPPβ plasma levels of obese type 2 diabetic patients compared to obese non-diabetic subjects. Acute sAPPβ administration to mice reduced PGC-1α levels and increased  in skeletal muscle and decreased insulin sensitivity.Collectively, these findings indicate that the BACE1 product sAPPβ is a key determinant in ER stress,  and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and gluconeogenesis in liver.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Even though NAFLD is strongly associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome, there is a proportion of patients who develop this condition in the absence of obesity and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We investigated early events in the pathogenesis of non-obese NAFLD, analyzing the impact of the chronic intake of a moderate fat-enriched diet on hepatic lipid accumulation and their relationship with . Rabbits fed with a moderate Fatty-- Enriched Diet 3%  (FAED), were evaluated for body weight, biochemical parameters, and liver function. Liver samples were analyzed by histology and RT-qPCR to measure lipid accumulation, the expression of -related genes IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, IL-18, COX-2, TNF-α, and TLR-4. Chronic consumption by 6-months of FAED did not generate metabolic changes, but it induced fatty liver. We also observed the development of low-grade  characterized by the up regulation of TNF-α, IL-13 and IL-18. The consumption by 12-months of FAED caused the overexpression of IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, COX-2, and TLR-4. We show that hepatic steatosis is an early consequence of fat-enriched diets, and that it is accompanied by an immune response that exerts protective effects that prevent the development of metabolic disorders, such as overweight/obesity and metabolic syndrome. However, the excessive intake of fatty acids renders these mechanisms less efficient for delaying the start of metabolic alterations. Rabbits fed with FAED can be used as a model of NAFLD in non-obese and obese groups, especially at early stages of the disease.Copyright © 2019.

The present study was aimed at elucidating the effects of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) on -stimulated BV-2 microglia and high-fat-diet-induced obese mice. The results indicated the suppressive effect of EGCG on lipid accumulation, pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β) release, and microglial activation in both cellular and high-fat-diet rodent models. These results were associated with lower phosphorylated levels of the janus kinase 2/signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3) signaling pathway.

Alterations in the lipid composition of the epidermis are associated with  and can affect the barrier function of the skin. SHARPIN-deficient cpdm mice develop a chronic dermatitis with similarities to atopic dermatitis in humans. Here, we used a recently-developed approach named multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-profiling and single ion monitoring to rapidly identify discriminative lipid ions. Shorter fatty acyl residues and increased relative amounts of sphingosine ceramides were observed in cpdm epidermis compared to wild type mice. These changes were accompanied by downregulation of the Fasn gene which encodes fatty  synthase. A profile of diverse lipids was generated by fast screening of over 300 transitions (ion pairs). Tentative attribution of the most significant transitions was confirmed by product ion scan (MS/MS), and the MRM-profiling linear intensity response was validated with a C17-ceramide lipid standard. Relative quantification of sphingosine ceramides CerAS(d18:1/24:0)2OH, CerAS(d18:1/16:0)2OH and CerNS(d18:1/16:0) discriminated between the two groups with 100% accuracy, while the free fatty acids cerotic , 16-hydroxy , and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) had 96.4% of accuracy. Validation by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) of the above-mentioned ceramides was in agreement with MRM-profiling results.

The role of different types of fatty acids in driving the early progression of NAFL to NASH is not understood. Lipid overload causing lipotoxicity and  has been considered as an essential pathogenic factor. To correlate the lipid profiles with cellular lipotoxicity, we utilized  (C16:0)- and especially unprecedented palmitoleic  (C16:1)-induced lipid overload HepG2 cell models coupled with lipidomic technology involving labeling with stable isotopes. C16:0 induced  and cell death, whereas C16:1 induced significant lipid droplet accumulation. Moreover, inhibition of de novo sphingolipid synthesis by myriocin (Myr) aggravated C16:0 induced lipoapoptosis. Lipid profiles are different in C16:0 and C16:1-treated cells. Stable isotope-labeled lipidomics elucidates the roles of specific fatty acids that affect lipid metabolism and cause lipotoxicity or lipid droplet formation. It indicates that not only saturation or monounsaturation of fatty acids plays a role in hepatic lipotoxicity but also Myr inhibition exasperates lipoapoptosis through ceramide in-direct pathway. Using the techniques presented in this study, we can potentially investigate the mechanism of lipid metabolism and the heterogeneous development of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30257381>Protective effects of Danzhi jiangtang capsule on vascular endothelial damages induced by high-fat diet and .</a></h2><p>Danzhi jiangtang capsule (DJC) is mainly used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus and vascular complication. Our aim was to investigate whether the protective effects of DJC by oral administration on high-fat diet (HFD) and -induced damages of endothelial cells are related to oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into standard chow diet (SCD), HFD, HFD plus DJC-low dose (HFD + DJCL) and HFD plus DJC-high dose treatment groups (HFD + DJCH). The latter three groups were given HFD feeding for three months, then the HFD + DJCL and HFD + DJCH rats were treated with DJC (500 and 1000 mg/kg/day) via gavage for another two months respectively. Endothelium-dependent relaxations induced by acetylcholine were observed in isolated rat thoracic aortic ring preparation. Malondialdehyde (MDA), total-antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα), free fatty acids (FFA), endothelin-1 (ET-1) and nitric oxide (NO) levels in serum were assayed. The pathological changes, protein expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), phosphorylated eNOS (p-eNOS) and ER stress-related genes in the thoracic aorta were measured. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were treated with serum-medicated DJC and then with  to detect the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) distribution, expression of p-eNOS and ER stress-related genes. DJC therapy exhibited a potent antioxidant activity and effectively prevented the endothelial dysfunction (ED) manifested by promoting p-eNOS expression and enhancing NO release, decreasing lipid deposition (Oil-red O staining, CPT1b and ACC) and  (IL-1β, TNFα, CD68 and p-JNK), alleviating oxidative and ER stress, and decreasing the apoptosis of endothelial cells (TUNEL, BCL-2 and BAX) induced by HFD and  respectively.

The effect of interesterified fats containing  or stearic acids on lipid metabolism and inflammatory signaling pathways in adipose and hepatic tissues was evaluated. Male LDLr-KO mice were fed a high-fat diet containing polyunsaturated (PUFA),  (PALM),  interesterified (PALM INTER), stearic (STEAR), or stearic interesterified (STEAR INTER) fats for 16 weeks. The expression of genes and protein levels involved in lipid metabolism and inflammatory processes in liver and white adipose tissue was determined by quantitative RT-PCR and by Western blot, respectively. The infiltration of inflammatory cells in hepatic and adipose tissues was determined by eosin and hematoxylin, while liver collagen content was determined by Sirius Red staining. Both interesterified fats increased liver collagen content and JNK phosphorylation. Additionally, the STEAR INTER group developed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) associated with higher neutrophil infiltration. PALM INTER induced adipose tissue expansion and enlargement of adipocytes. Furthermore, PALM INTER triggered increased IKK phosphorylation and TNFα protein content, conditions associated with the upstream activation of the NFkB signaling pathway.

Both MIP-1α and free fatty acids are elevated in obesity/T2D. We asked if free fatty  palmitate could modulate MIP1α expression in the human monocytic cells.Human monocytic THP-1 cells and macrophages were stimulated with palmitate and TNF-α (positive control). MIP-1α expression was measured with real time RT-PCR, Flow Cytometry and ELISA. Signaling pathways were identified by using THP-1-XBlue™ cells, THP-1-XBlue™-defMyD cells, anti-TLR4 mAb and TLR4 siRNA.Our data show that palmitate induced significant increase in MIP1α production in monocytic THP-1 cells/macrophages. MIP-1α induction was significantly suppressed when cells were treated with anti-TLR4 antibody prior stimulation with palmitate. Using TLR4 siRNA, we further demonstrate that palmitate-induced MIP-1α expression in monocytic cells requires TLR4. Moreover, THP1 cells defective in MyD88, a major adaptor protein involved in TLR4 signaling, were unable to induce MIP-1α production in response to palmitate. Palmitate-induced MIP-1α expression was suppressed by inhibition of MAPK, NFkB and PI3K signaling pathways. In addition, palmitate-induced NF-κB/AP-1 activation was observed while production of MIP-1α. However, this activation of NF-κB/AP-1 was abrogated in MyD88 deficient cells.Overall, these results show that palmitate induces TLR4dependent MIP-1α expression requiring the MyD88 recruitment and activation of MAPK, NF-κB/AP-1 and PI3K signaling. It implies that the increased systemic levels of free fatty  palmitate in obesity/T2D may contribute to metabolic  through excessive production of MIP-1a.© Copyright by the Author(s).

PCa progression can be associated with obesity. Signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) plays a crucial role in PCa growth. However, whether STAT3 plays a role in high-fat diet (HFD)-associated PCa growth is unknown. Our data show that HFD feeding increases tumor size, STAT3 phosphorylation, and  (PA) level in the xenograft tissues of the PCa-bearing xenograft mouse model. In vitro studies show that PA increases STAT3 expression and phosphorylation (STAT3-Y705) in PCa. Computational modeling suggests strong and stable binding between PA and unphosphorylated STAT3 at R593 and N538. The binding changes STAT3 structure and activity. Functional studies show that both STAT3 mutants (R583A and N538A) and STAT3 dominant negative significantly reduce PA-enhanced STAT3 phosphorylation, PA-increased PCa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In the xenograft mouse models, the HFD-increased tumor growth and STAT3 phosphorylation in tumors are reversed by STAT3 inhibition. Our study not only demonstrates the regulatory role of PA/STAT3 axis in HFD-associated PCa growth but also suggests a novel mechanism of how STAT3 is activated by PA.

Aging and obesity independently contribute to muscle atrophy that is assumed to be a result of the activation of mutual physiological pathways. Understanding mechanisms contributing to the induction of skeletal muscle atrophy with aging and obesity is important for determining targets that may have pivotal roles in muscle loss in these conditions. We find that aging and obesity equally induce an anabolic resistance to acute skeletal muscle contraction as observed with decreases in anabolic signaling activation after contraction. Furthermore, treatment with the sphingosine-1-phosphate analog FTY720 for 4 wk increased lean mass and strength, and the anabolic signaling response to contraction was improved in obese but not older animals. To determine the role of chronic  and different fatty acids on anabolic resistance in skeletal muscle cells, we overexpressed IKKβ with and without exposure to saturated fatty  (SFA; ), polyunsaturated fatty  (eicosapentaenoic ), and monounsaturated fatty  (oleic ). We found that IKKβ overexpression increased  markers in muscle cells, and this chronic  exacerbated anabolic resistance in response to SFA. Pretreatment with FTY720 reversed the inflammatory effects of  in the muscle cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate chronic  can induce anabolic resistance, SFA aggravates these effects, and FTY720 can reverse this by decreasing ceramide accumulation in skeletal muscle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30703495>Evaluation of anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities of the methanol extract of Holigarna caustica (Dennst.)

MEHC was subjected to activity testing, using chemical-induced (acetic  and formalin test) and heat-induced (hot plate and tail immersion test) pain models. To determine the possible mechanism behind the anti-nociceptive activity of MEHC, the opioid antagonist naltrexone was used to evaluate the involvement of opioid receptors in the case of formalin, hot plate and tail immersion tests, while the involvement of the cGMP and ATP-sensitive K channel pathways were assessed using methylene blue and glibenclamide respectively, in the acetic -induced writhing test. In parallel, the carrageenan-induced paw oedema model was used to determine the anti-inflammatory potential of the extract. Exploratory and motor behaviours were evaluated by the open-field test. Various bioactive compounds potentially responsible for the anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities were ascertained using GC-MS analysis.MEHC showed strong, significant and dose-dependent anti-nociceptive activity in all chemical-induced and heat-induced pain models at all experimental doses. The association of opioid receptors with the observed anti-nociceptive effects was confirmed by using naltrexone. The cGMP and ATP-sensitive K channel pathway was also shown to be involved in the anti-nociceptive activity of MEHC. In addition, MEHC exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of inflammatory oedema induced by carrageenan. MEHC was not connected with changes in either the locomotor activity or motor responses of mice. In a GC-MS analysis, 40 compounds were identified, among which twelve are documented bioactive compounds with potent analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties.Our current study revealed that MEHC possesses strong central and peripheral anti-nociceptive as well as anti-inflammatory activity. It may also be concluded that both opioid receptors as well as the cGMP and ATP-sensitive K channel pathway are involved in the anti-nociceptive mechanism of MEHC.

In this study, we determined whether the depletion of TLR3 modulated hepatic injury in mice and further aimed to provide mechanistic insights into the TLR3-mediated modulation of diet-induced hepatic  and fat accumulation. Hepatic steatosis and inflammatory response were induced by feeding wild-type (WT) or TLR3 knockout mice a high-fat diet for 8 weeks. Primary liver resident cells, including hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), were treated with . TLR3 knockout mice fed a high-fat diet showed severe hepatic  accompanied by nuclear factor-κB and IRF3 activation, which is mainly induced by the activation of Kupffer cells. Decreased TLR4 expression was restored in hepatic mononuclear cells and Kupffer cells in TLR3 knockout mice compared to that in the WT. Moreover, hepatic steatosis was decreased in TLR3 knockout mice. Hepatocytes from TLR3 knockout mice exhibited reduced expression of cannabinoid receptors. HSCs from TLR3 knockout mice showed decreased expression of the enzymes involved in endocannabinoid synthesis.

Cell culture models of retinal cell types are frequently used to mechanistically study DR, but appropriate stimulators of DR-like factors are difficult to identify.

IBD associated fatty  profile abnormalities were observed independently of nutritional status or disease activity, suggesting a common genetic background. However, no study so far has attempted to look for overlap between IBD loci and fatty  associated loci or investigate the genetics of fatty  profiles in IBD.

JZG activated autophagy progression by either induction of autophagosomes or co-localization of autophagosomes and lysosomes as well as degradation of autolysosomes to protect against PA-induced hepatocyte injury, and protected mitochondrial integrity against oxidative stress in PA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, JZG ameliorated lipid droplets and  induced by HF diet , leading to improved metabolic disorder and associated liver injury in a mouse model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).Metabolic stress-induced hepatocyte injury exhibited dual effects on autophagy and JZG activated the entire process, resulting in beneficial effects in NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31415760>Oxidative stress induced by  modulates K2.3 channels in vascular endothelium.</a></h2><p>Elevated plasma free fatty acids level has been implicated in the development of insulin resistance, , and endothelial dysfunction in diabetic and nondiabetic individuals. However, the underlying mechanisms still remain to be defined. Herein, we investigated the effect of  (PA), the most abundant saturated fatty  in the human body, on small-conductance Ca-activated potassium channels (K2.3)-mediated relaxation in rodent resistance arteries and the underlying molecular mechanism. The effect of PA on K2.3 in endothelium was evaluated using real-time PCR, Western blotting, whole-cell patch voltage-clamp, wire and pressure myograph system, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured by using dihydroethidium and 2', 7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate. K2.3-mediated vasodilatation responses to acetylcholine and NS309 (agonist of K2.3 and K3.1) were impaired by incubation of normal mesenteric arteries with 100 μM PA for 24 h. In cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), PA decreased K2.3 current and expression at mRNA and protein levels. Incubation with the NADPH oxidase (Nox) inhibitor dibenziodolium (DPI) partly inhibited the PA-induced ROS production and restored K2.3 expression. Inhibition of either p38-MAPK or NF-κB using specific inhibitors (SB203580, SB202190 or Bay11-7082, pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate) attenuated PA-induced downregulation of K2.3 and inhibition of p38-MAPK also attenuated PA-induced phosphorylation of NF-κB p65. Furthermore, DPI reversed the increment of phospho-p38-MAPK by PA. These results demonstrated that PA downregulated K2.3 expressions via Nox/ROS/p38-MAPK/NF-κB signaling leading to endothelial vasodilatory dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we investigated the effect of high-fat diet (HFD) on the development of experimental colitis in mice. Relative to mice fed low-fat diet (LFD), HFD feeding for 4 wk increased the levels of triglyceride, cholesterol, and free fatty acids in the plasma as well as within the colonic mucosa. In an experimental colitis model induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS), mice on 4-wk HFD exhibited more severe colonic inflammation and developed more severe colitis compared with the LFD counterparts. HFD feeding resulted in higher production of mucosal pro-inflammatory cytokines, greater activation of the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK)  regulatory pathway, and greater increases in mucosal barrier permeability in mice following TNBS induction. HFD feeding also induced gp91, an NADPH oxidase subunit, and promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in both colonic epithelial cells and lamina propria cells. In HCT116 cell culture,  or  and TNF-α combination markedly increased ROS production and induced the MLCK pathway, and these effects were markedly diminished in the presence of a ROS scavenger. Taken together, these data suggest that HFD promotes colitis by aggravating mucosal oxidative stress, which rapidly drives mucosal inflammation and increases intestinal mucosal barrier permeability. This study demonstrates high-fat diet feeding promotes colitis in a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic -induced experimental colitis model in mice. The underlying mechanism is that high-fat diet induces oxidative stress in the colonic mucosa, which increases colonic epithelial barrier permeability and drives colonic mucosal inflammation. These observations provide molecular evidence that diets high in saturated fats are detrimental to patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30102465>Palmitoleic  has Stronger Anti-Inflammatory Potential in Human Endothelial Cells Compared to Oleic and  Acids.</a></h2><p>Fatty acids (FAs) may affect endothelial cell (EC) function, influencing atherogenesis and inflammatory processes. Palmitoleic  (POA) has been described as an anti-inflammatory FA. However, its effects on ECs are underexplored. This study compares the effects of POA with those of  (PA) and oleic  (OA) on EC inflammatory responses.EAHy926 cells (EC lineage) are exposed to PA, OA, or POA, and stimulated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Associated with the FA's own incorporation, PA induces a twofold increase in arachidonic , while POA increases the amount of cis-vaccenic . PA, but not OA, enhances the production of IL-6 and IL-8 in response to TNF-α. In contrast, POA decreases production of monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, IL-6, and IL-8 compared to PA. TNF-α increases surface intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression previously decreased by POA. TNF-α stimulation increases the expression of NFκB, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, MCP-1, and IL-6 genes and reduces the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α gene. PA enhances the expression of MCP-1, IL-6, and COX-2 genes, while POA downregulates these genes, decreases expression of NFκB, and upregulates PPAR-α gene expression.POA has anti-inflammatory effects on ECs stimulated with TNF-α and may counter endothelial dysfunction.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We previously showed that saturated dietary fat induces pancreatic acinar lipotoxicity and cellular stress. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of exocrine pancreas cells is highly developed and thus predisposed to stress. We studied the combination of saturated and unsaturated FAs in metabolic and pancreatitis like cerulein (CER)-induced stress states on cellular ER stress.Exocrine pancreas AR42J and rat primary exocrine acinar cells underwent acute (24 h) challenge with different FAs (saturated, monounsaturated) at different concentrations (250 and 500 µM) and in combination with acute CER-induced stress, and were analyzed for fat accumulation, ER stress unfolded protein response (UPR) and immune and enzyme markers. Acute exposure of AR42J and pancreatic acinar cells to different FAs and their combinations increased triglyceride accumulation.  significantly dose-dependently enhanced the UPR, immune factors and pancreatic lipase (PL) levels, as demonstrated by XBP1 splicing and elevation in UPR transcripts and protein levels ( and ). Exposure to high  levels in a CER-induced stress state synergistically increased ER stress and  marker levels. Exposure to oleic  did not induce ER stress and PL levels and significantly decreased immune factors in an acute CER-induced stress state. Combination of oleic and  acids significantly reduced the -induced ER stress, but did not affect the immune factor response. We show that combination of monounsaturated and saturated FAs protects from exocrine pancreatic cellular ER stress in both metabolic and CER-induced stress.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29701903>Impact of miR-140 Deficiency on Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>We have previously shown that loss of miR-140 has a pro-fibrotic effect in the mammary gland. This study aims to investigate whether miR-140 loss and obesity act synergistically to promote non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and to identify the underlying mechanisms.Liver tissues were isolated from lean-fat-diet and high-fat-diet fed wild-type and miR-140 knockout mice. Using molecular staining and immunohistochemistry techniques, increased development of NAFLD and fibrotic indicators in miR-140 knockout mice were identified. Utilizing an in vitro model system, miR-140 was demonstrated to target TLR-4, and miR-140 overexpression was shown to be sufficient to inhibit  signaling through the TLR-4/NFκB pathway.These findings demonstrate that loss of miR-140 results in increased expression of TLR-4, sensitizing cells to  signaling and in increased inflammatory activity through the TLR4/NFκB pathway. This signaling axis promotes NAFLD development in a high-fat diet context and indicates the potential utility of miR-140 rescue as a therapeutic strategy in NAFLD.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The aim of this work was twofold: 1) to investigate the structural and functional alterations of the  (TJ)-mediated intestinal epithelial barrier of ileum and colon, that concentrate most of the microbiota, after exposure to a HFD for 15, 30 and 60 days, and 2) to assess the effect of in vitro exposure to free fatty acids (FFAs), one of the components of HFD, on paracellular barrier of colon-derived Caco-2 cells.HFD exposure induced progressive metabolic changes in male mice that culminated in prediabetes after 60d. Morphological analysis of ileum and colon mucosa showed no signs of epithelial rupture or local inflammation but changes in the junctional content/distribution and/or cellular content of TJ-associated proteins (claudins-1, -2, -3, and occludin) in intestinal epithelia were seen mainly after a prediabetes state has been established. This impairment in TJ structure was not associated with significant changes in intestinal permeability to FITC-dextran. Exposure of Caco-2 monolayers to  or linoleic acids seems to induce a reinforcement of TJ structure while treatment with oleic  had a more diverse effect on TJ protein distribution.TJ structure in distal intestinal epithelia can be specifically impaired by HFD intake at early stage of T2DM, but not by FFAs in vitro. Since the TJ change in ileum/colon was marginal, probably it does not contribute to the disease onset.Copyright © 2019.

ROS generation by infiltrating macrophages involves multiple mechanisms, including Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated NADPH oxidase (NOX) activation. Here, we show that palmitate-stimulated CD11bF4/80 hepatic infiltrating macrophages, but not CD11bF4/80 Kupffer cells, generate ROS via dynamin-mediated endocytosis of TLR4 and NOX2, independently from MyD88 and TRIF. We demonstrate that differently from LPS-mediated dimerization of the TLR4-MD2 complex, palmitate binds a monomeric TLR4-MD2 complex that triggers endocytosis, ROS generation and increases pro-interleukin-1β expression in macrophages. Palmitate-induced ROS generation in human CD68CD14 macrophages is strongly suppressed by inhibition of dynamin. Furthermore, Nox2-deficient mice are protected against high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. Therefore, endocytosis of TLR4 and NOX2 into macrophages might be a novel therapeutic target for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29666185>Hepatocyte nuclear receptor SHP suppresses  and fibrosis in a mouse model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a burgeoning health problem worldwide, ranging from nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL, steatosis without hepatocellular injury) to the more aggressive nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH, steatosis with ballooning, , or fibrosis). Although many studies have greatly contributed to the elucidation of NAFLD pathogenesis, the disease progression from NAFL to NASH remains incompletely understood. Nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (Nr0b2, ) is a transcriptional regulator critical for the regulation of bile , glucose, and lipid metabolism. Here, we show that SHP levels are decreased in the livers of patients with NASH and in diet-induced mouse NASH. Exposing primary mouse hepatocytes to  and lipopolysaccharide , we demonstrated that the suppression of  expression in hepatocytes is due to c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, which stimulates c-Jun-mediated transcriptional repression of  Interestingly,  induction of hepatocyte-specific SHP in steatotic mouse liver ameliorated NASH progression by attenuating liver  and fibrosis, but not steatosis. Moreover, a key mechanism linking the anti-inflammatory role of hepatocyte-specific SHP expression to  involved SHP-induced suppression of NF-κB p65-mediated induction of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), which activates macrophage proinflammatory polarization and migration. In summary, our results indicate that a JNK/SHP/NF-κB/CCL2 regulatory network controls communications between hepatocytes and macrophages and contributes to the disease progression from NAFL to NASH.

The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of EGCG in alleviating IR in HepG2 cells.HepG2 cells were treated with 25 mM glucose, 0.25 mM  (PA), or 50 μM EGCG for 24 h.EGCG increased glucose uptake and decreased glucose content. EGCG markedly decreased the levels of inflammatory and oxidative stress factors including nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde and p53 protein, and markedly increased superoxide dismutases (SOD), glutathione peroxidase and SOD2 protein. EGCG significantly downregulated the levels of FFAs, triacylglycerol and cholesterol in HepG2 cells. The glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) protein and its downstream proteins peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator (PGC)-1β were significantly increased, and sterol regulatory element-binding-1c (SREBP-1c) protein, and fatty  synthase (FAS) were significantly decreased by EGCG in HepG2.

During vascular pathologies such as atherosclerosis, increases in COX-2 activity result in prostanoid production, a contributor to the development and progression of vascular  leading to unstable atherosclerotic plaques and increased risk for thrombotic events. Recent studies demonstrate that select free fatty acids, such as palmitate, can act as proinflammatory mediators. However, the effect of palmitate on COX-2 expression and activity, and its impact on the development and progression of vascular , are not well elucidated. We investigated the effect of palmitate on COX-2 expression and function in human vascular smooth muscle cells. Cells were treated with palmitate, COX-2 protein levels were assessed using Western analysis, and activity was assessed via ELISA. We observed that palmitate dose-dependently increased COX-2 levels and specifically enhanced band intensity of the COX-2 74 kDa band (slowest migrating band). This response was attenuated by N-linked glycosylation inhibition, suggesting that palmitate impacts expression of the fully activated glycoform of COX-2. Palmitate-induced increases in COX-2 levels correlated with an increase in prostaglandin E production that was also attenuated by a glycosylation inhibitor. Additionally, palmitate altered cell morphology and increased cell density which were reversed by selective COX-2 inhibition. Thus, we conclude that palmitate acts on COX-2 by two separate mechanisms of action in human vascular smooth muscle. It elicits dose-dependent increases in COX-2 protein expression and modulates regulation of COX-2 activity via modification of posttranslational glycosylation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30587074>The effects of pro- and anti-atherosclerotic factors on intracellular nucleotide concentration in murine endothelial cells.</a></h2><p>Endothelial cell activation and dysfunction could lead to endothelial injury that is an important factor in the development of vascular diseases. Vascular injury is strongly associated with disturbed endothelial cell energetics and pyridine nucleotide pool. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of inflammatory stimuli (IL-6, LPS), uric , hyperglycemia, fatty acids, flavonoids, statins and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on cellular concentration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) in cultured endothelial cells. Murine-immortalized heart endothelial cells (H5V cells) were treated with different concentrations of pro- and anti-atherosclerotic factors and intracellular concentration of nucleotides were measured using high performance liquid chromatography. Intracellular ATP concentration in H5V cells was not changed by inflammatory stimuli (IL-6 and LPS), uric , glucose, atorvastatin, acetylsalicylic , monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Only high concentration of  (1 mM) and kaempferol (>0.1 mM) decreased intracellular ATP concentration. The concentration of intracellular ADP has not been altered by any of tested compounds. In turn, intracellular NAD pool was modified only by polyunsaturated fatty acids and atorvastatin. Linoleic , docosahexaenoic  and atorvastatin increased cellular NAD concentration. Tested compounds have a small influence on murine endothelial cell energetics, but polyunsaturated fatty acids and atorvastatin increased intracellular NAD concentration that could be an important protective mechanism against endothelial cell injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31355732>-Enriched Diet Induces Hepatic Steatosis and Injury in Adult Zebrafish.</a></h2><p> (PA) is the most abundant saturated fatty  in fast foods and is known to induce  and cellular injury in various tissues. In this study, we investigated whether a PA-enriched diet can induce hepatic steatosis and injury in adult zebrafish. The adult zebrafish exhibited increased body weight, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, and steatosis and a hepatic injury phenotype after being fed with a PA-enriched diet for 6 weeks. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that genes associated with hepatic injury were all significantly increased in the liver. Furthermore, livers from the PA-fed group showed an increased messenger RNA (mRNA) expression associated with oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses. We also found significant upregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism and triacylglyceride accumulation. Ultrastructural analysis revealed mitochondrial cristae injury and a dilated ER phenotype in the PA-fed hepatocytes, which can be causes of hepatic injury. PA-enriched diet induced hepatic steatosis and injury in adult zebrafish that recapitulated typical metabolic changes and pathophysiological changes as well as increased oxidative stress and ER stress observed in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30506807>Enhancement of lipid content and inflammatory cytokine secretion in SZ95 sebocytes by  suggests a potential link between free fatty acids and acne aggravation.</a></h2><p>A relationship between acne and free fatty acids (FFAs) has been suggested recently. However, the effects of FFAs on sebaceous glands are still largely unknown. At the same time, the role of FFAs during chronic  is well established. Considering that FFAs are also a major component of sebum, it is likely that changes in FFA affect both the synthesis of sebum and the inflammatory response in sebaceous glands. In this study, we examined a hypothesis that FFAs increase the production of sebum and induce  in the sebaceous glands. We found that treatment of SZ95 sebocytes with exogenously applied  (PA), a major saturated FFA, induced a significant increase in intracellular lipid levels. Moreover, PA treatment also increased the expression and secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines in SZ95 sebocytes. We also found that Toll-like receptors were required for the inflammatory response triggered by PA. The results of our study strengthen the notion about the link between acne and FFAs and suggest the mechanism underlying this relationship.

Therefore, we investigated the underlying mechanism by which SFAs trigger NLRP3 inflammasome activation.The treatment with SFAs, such as  and stearic , promoted IL-1β release in murine primary macrophages while treatment with oleic  inhibited SFA-induced IL-1β release in a dose-dependent manner. Analyses using polarized light microscopy revealed that intracellular crystallization was provoked in SFA-treated macrophages. As well as IL-1β release, the intracellular crystallization and lysosomal dysfunction were inhibited in the presence of oleic . These results suggest that SFAs activate NLRP3 inflammasome through intracellular crystallization. Indeed, SFA-derived crystals activated NLRP3 inflammasome and subsequent IL-1β release via lysosomal dysfunction. Excess SFAs also induced crystallization and IL-1β release in vivo. Furthermore, SFA-derived crystals provoked acute , which was impaired in IL-1β-deficient mice.These findings demonstrate that excess SFAs cause intracellular crystallization and subsequent lysosomal dysfunction, leading to the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases.© 2018 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29713651>Novel Mechanisms Modulating Palmitate-Induced Inflammatory Factors in Hypertrophied 3T3-L1 Adipocytes by AMPK.</a></h2><p>A growing body of evidence indicates that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) contributes to not only energy metabolic homeostasis but also the inhibition of inflammatory responses.

Dietary fatty acids, which are increased systemically in obese patients and are further increased after high-fat meals, affect the innate immune system and may contribute to dysfunctional immune responses to respiratory infection. In this study we investigated the effects of dietary fatty acids on immune responses to respiratory infection in pulmonary fibroblasts and a bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B). Cells were challenged with BSA-conjugated fatty acids (ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids [PUFAs], ω-3 PUFAs, or saturated fatty acids [SFAs]) +/- the viral mimic polyinosinic:polycytidylic  (poly[I:C]) or bacterial compound lipoteichoic  (LTA), and release of proinflammatory cytokines was measured. In both cell types, challenge with arachidonic  (AA) (ω-6 PUFA) and poly(I:C) or LTA led to substantially greater IL-6 and CXCL8 release than either challenge alone, demonstrating synergy. In epithelial cells,  (SFA) combined with poly(I:C) also led to greater IL-6 release. The underlying signaling pathways of AA and poly(I:C)- or LTA-induced cytokine release were examined using specific signaling inhibitors and IB. Cytokine production in pulmonary fibroblasts was prostaglandin dependent, and synergistic upregulation occurred via p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, whereas cytokine production in bronchial epithelial cell lines was mainly mediated through JNK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. We confirmed these findings using rhinovirus infection, demonstrating that AA enhances rhinovirus-induced cytokine release. This study suggests that during respiratory infection, increased levels of dietary ω-6 PUFAs and SFAs may lead to more severe airway  and may contribute to and/or increase the severity of asthma exacerbations.</p></html>
