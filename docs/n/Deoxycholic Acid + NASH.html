The association between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and hepatocyte metabolism disorders prompted us to characterize ER stress-induced hepatic metabolic dysfunction in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocytes (hiPSC-Hep), to explore regulatory pathways and validate a phenotypic  model for progression of liver steatosis. We treated hiPSC-Hep with a ratio of unsaturated and saturated fatty acids in the presence of an inducer of ER stress to synergistically promote triglyceride accumulation and dysregulate lipid metabolism. We monitored lipid accumulation by high-content imaging and measured gene regulation by RNA sequencing and reverse transcription quantitative PCR analyses. Our results show that ER stress potentiated intracellular lipid accumulation by 5-fold in hiPSC-Hep in the absence of apoptosis. Transcriptome pathway analysis identified ER stress pathways as the most significantly dysregulated of all pathways affected. Obeticholic  dose dependently inhibited lipid accumulation and modulated gene expression downstream of the farnesoid X receptor. We were able to identify modulation of hepatic markers and gene pathways known to be involved in steatosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), in support of a hiPSC-Hep disease model that is relevant to clinical data for human . Our results show that the model can serve as a translational discovery platform for the understanding of molecular pathways involved in NAFLD, and can facilitate the identification of novel therapeutic molecules based on high-throughput screening strategies.© 2018.

Clinical efficacy superior to most other treatment options was shown by FXR agonists such as obeticholic  (OCA) as they improved various metabolic features including liver steatosis as well as liver inflammation and fibrosis. But OCA's clinical success comes with some major liabilities such as pruritus, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) lowering, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) increase, and a potential for drug-induced liver toxicity. Some of these effects can be attributed to on-target effects exerted by FXR, but with others it is not clear whether it is FXR- or OCA-related. Therefore a quest for novel, proprietary FXR agonists is ongoing with the aim to increase FXR potency and selectivity over other proteins and to overcome at least some of the OCA-associated clinical side effects through an improved pharmacology. In this chapter we will discuss the historical and ongoing efforts in the identification and development of nonsteroidal, which largely means non-bile -type, FXR agonists for clinical use.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25744638>[Cellular senescence and chronic inflammation].</a></h2><p>It has recently become apparent that obesity is associated with chronic inflammation and several common types of cancer development. Although several events were proposed to be involved in these pathologies, the precise mechanisms underlying obesity-associated inflammation and cancer largely remain unclear. Here, we show that senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) plays crucial roles in promoting obesity-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in mice. Dietary or genetic obesity induces alterations of gut microbiota, thereby increasing the levels of a bacterial metabolite that cause DNA damage. The enterohepatic circulation of the bacterial metabolites provokes SASP phenotype in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which in turn, secretes various inflammatory and tumour promoting factors in the liver, thus facilitating HCC development in mice after exposure to chemical carcinogen. Importantly, reducing gut bacteria efficiently prevents HCC development in obese mice. Similar results were also observed in mice lacking an SASP inducer or depleted of senescent HSCs, indicating that the induction of SASP by the gut bacterial metabolite in HSCs plays key roles in obesity-associated HCC development. Interestingly, moreover, signs of SASP were also observed in the HSCs in the area of HCC arising in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), implying that a similar pathway may contribute to at least certain aspects of obesity-associated HCC development in humans as well. These findings provide valuable new insights into the development of obesity-associated cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29128056>Emerging Treatments for Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>This review discusses completed phase II randomized clinical trials with high-quality published results for compounds that demonstrate effects on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis histology (obeticholic , elafibranor, and liraglutide).

Spirulina was reported to possess hypolipemic and antioxidative effects and might counteract  development. C57Bl/6J mice were fed a western diet (WD) during 25 weeks with or without spirulina liquid extract (SLE) at 2 different doses (WDS1 and WDS2 groups) in drinking water. Liver histology, inflammation, and oxidative stress were assessed as well as glucose tolerance status, lipid metabolism, and gallbladder bile  profile. WDS2 gained significantly less weight than WD. Liver weight-to-body weight ratio and plasma alanine aminotransferase were significantly lower in WDS2 mice. A reduced liver fibrosis and NFκBp65 protein expression were measured in the supplemented group as a lower accumulation of superoxide anion, nitric oxide, and thiobarbituric reactive substances. WDS2 mice showed also a preserved glucose tolerance, a strong decrease of plasma cholesterol, and a significant increase of gallbladder ursodeoxycholic  and β-muricholic .

At the end of the experiment, body weight, serum biochemical index, and hepatopathologic changes were examined.Compared with the control group, rats in the  group had significantly increased body weight, liver weight, and serum lipid and aminotransferase levels. All rats in the  group developed steatohepatitis, as determined by their liver histology. Compared with the  group, there were no significant changes in body weight, liver weight, blood biochemical index, the degree of hepatic steatosis, and histological activity index (HAI) score in the UDCA group; however, body and liver weights were significantly decreased, and the degree of steatosis was markedly improved in rats of both the LCD group and the UDCA+LCD group, but significant improvement with regard to serum lipid variables and hepatic inflammatory changes were seen only in rats of the UDCA+LCD group, and not in the LCD group.LCD might play a role in the treatment of obesity and hepatic steatosis in rats, but it exerts no significant effect on both serum lipid disorders and hepatic inflammatory changes. UDCA may enhance the therapeutic effects of LCD on steatohepatitis accompanied by obesity and hyperlipidemia. However, UDCA alone is not effective in the prevention of steatohepatitis induced by high-fat diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27512874>Comparative efficacy of interventions on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): A PRISMA-compliant systematic review and network meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has significantly increased over the last decades. Despite existence of several interventions, there remains unclear which interventions work the best.A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing efficacy of all treatment options in NAFLD were performed to determine comparative efficacy and safety of interventions in the management of NAFLD. Several electronic databases were searched up to Nov 15, 2015. Outcomes include liver histological outcomes (i.e., fibrosis), all-cause mortality, cirrhosis, and safety. A network meta-analysis was applied to estimate pooled risk ratios (RR). Quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE criteria.A total of 44 studies (n = 3802) were eligible. When compared with placebo, obeticholic  (OCA) was the only intervention that significantly improved fibrosis with RR (95% CI) of 1.91 (1.15, 3.16), while pentoxyfylline (PTX) demonstrated improved fibrosis without statistical significance with RR (95% CI) of 2.27 (0.81, 6.36). Only thiazolidinedione (TZD) and vitamin E use resulted in significant increase in resolution of , while OCA, TZD, and vitamin E significantly improved other outcomes including NAS, steatosis, ballooning, and inflammation outcomes. Quality of evidence varied from very low (i.e., metformin, PTX on mean change of ballooning grade) to high (OCA, TZD, vitamin E on improving histological outcomes). Limitations of this study were lack of relevant long-term outcomes (e.g., cirrhosis, death, safety), possible small study effect, and few head-to-head studies.Our study suggests potential efficacy of OCA, TZD, and vitamin E in improving histologic endpoints in NAFLD.

OCA, also known as 6-ethyl-CDCA or INT-747, was originally described by investigators at the Perugia University in 2002 as a selective ligand for the bile  sensor, farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR). In addition to FXR and similarly to CDCA, OCA also activates GPBAR1/TGR5, a cell membrane G protein-coupled receptor for secondary bile acids. In 2016, based on the results of phase II studies showing efficacy in reducing the plasma levels of alkaline phosphatase, a surrogate biomarker for disease progression in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), OCA has gained approval as a second-line treatment for PBC patients nonresponsive to UDCA. The use of OCA in PBC patients associates with several side effects, the most common of which is pruritus, whose incidence is dose-dependent and is extremely high when this agent is used as a monotherapy. Additionally, the use of OCA associates with the increased risk for the development of liver failure in cirrhotic PBC patients. Currently, OCA is investigated for its potential in the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). Phase II and III trials have shown that OCA might attenuate the severity of liver fibrosis in patients with , but it has no efficacy in reversing the steatotic component of the disease, while reduces the circulating levels of HDL-C and increases LDL-C. In summary, OCA has been the first-in-class of FXR ligands advanced to a clinical stage and is now entering its third decade of life, highlighting the potential benefits and risk linked to FXR-targeted therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18410557>Review article: current management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome.To assess the epidemiological impact and the current management of patients with NAFLD.Published peer-reviewed literature and abstracts concerning NAFLD and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () were reviewed. Articles specifically related to epidemiology, diagnosis and current treatment strategies for NAFLD and  are summarized.NAFLD is strongly associated with the epidemic of obesity and type-2 diabetes mellitus, and is estimated to affect about 20-30% of the population in the US. From the spectrum of NAFLD, only patients with biopsy-proven  (estimated prevalence in the US population is about 3-5%) have been convincingly shown to progress to cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. The clinical manifestation of NAFLD is usually absent or subtle, with abnormal aminotransferases or incidental radiographic findings of fatty liver. The pathogenesis of NAFLD is attributed to a multi-hit process involving insulin resistance, oxidative stress, apoptotic pathways, and adipocytokines. In 2008, there is no established treatment for NAFLD. Weight loss and treatment for each component of metabolic syndrome. Nevertheless, a large number of agents are being considered in clinical trials of patients with .Awareness of the tremendous impact of NAFLD as an important cause of chronic liver disease is increasing along with a great deal of information about its pathogenesis.

Therefore, we evaluated the hepatoprotective effect of a PC-precursor lipid specifically targeted to the liver. We synthesized the bile -phospholipid conjugate ursodeoxycholyl lysophosphatidylethanolamide (UDCA-LPE), which was designed to target PC to hepatocytes by way of bile- transport systems. We synthesized a fluorescently labeled analogue UDCA-6-[(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]hexanoyl PE (UDCA-NBDPE) for uptake and metabolism studies. Unexpectedly, the majority of UDCA-NBDPE was still intact and not hydrolyzed efficiently in HepG2 cells. For targeting in vivo, NBD fluorescence from UDCA-NBDPE-injected mice was recovered in the liver the most, whereas injection of NBDPE alone resulted in an even distribution in liver, kidneys, and intestine. Cytoprotection by UDCA-LPE was tested in starvation and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) apoptosis models using HepG2 cells. Only the intact UDCA-LPE was able to persistently stimulate growth after 36 to 120-hour starvation, and significantly inhibited TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis. In both models, LPC, LPE, UDCA, or UDCA added with LPE exhibited weak to no cytoprotection. UDCA-LPE stabilized mitochondrial membranes by lowering mitochondrial membrane potential. Western blot analyses of phosphorylated Akt and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3)alpha/beta revealed that UDCA-LPE activated phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathways. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or Akt small interfering (si)RNA consistently inhibited the proproliferative effects of UDCA-LPE during starvation. The TNF-alpha death-receptor extrinsic pathway involves caspase 8 activation, which is inhibited by cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (cFLIP); thus, cFLIP siRNA was employed in our studies. cFLIP siRNA was able to reverse the cytoprotective effects of UDCA-LPE during TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis, and UDCA-LPE concomitantly upregulated protein expression of cFLIP(L).UDCA-LPE, which targeted the liver in vivo, elicited potent biological activities in vitro by stimulating hepatocyte growth and by inhibiting TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis.

Here, we aimed to explore a potential relationship between FXR and CHOP. We fed wild-type (WT) and FXR KO mice a MCD diet (model of steatohepatitis) and found that Chop mRNA expression is upregulated in WT but not FXR KO mice. The absence of FXR aggravates hepatic inflammation after MCD feeding. In HepG2 cells, we found that Chop expression is regulated in a FXR/Retinoid X receptor (RXR)-dependent manner. We identified a FXR/RXR-binding site in the human CHOP promoter, demonstrating a highly conserved regulatory pathway. Our study shows that FXR/RXR regulates Chop expression in a mouse model of steatohepatitis, providing novel insights into pathogenesis of this disorder.© 2017 The Authors.

Bile acids such as ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) play an essential role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD by regulating the level of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) 1c, but the underlying regulatory mechanism remains elusive. Increased evidence indicates that the AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1 signaling pathway is a key pathway to regulate hepatic cellular lipid metabolism. UDCA may regulate the AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1 signaling pathway to ameliorate hepatic lipid metabolism.To investigate the functional mechanism of UDCA in an oleic  (OA)-induced cellular model of NAFLD.The cellular model of NAFLD was established using OA and treated with UDCA. First, the best concentration of UDCA was selected. For the best time-dependent assay, cells were stimulated with OA only or co-treated with OA and 2 mmol/L UDCA for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. Oil red O staining was used to observe the accumulation of intracellular lipids, while the intracellular contents of triglyceride, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were detected by enzymatic methods. Meanwhile, the expression levels of AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1 signaling pathway-related proteins were detected by real-time PCR and Western blot.In the NAFLD cell model established with LO2 cells induced using OA, lipid accumulation was obvious. UDCA significantly inhibited lipid accumulation at different concentrations (especially 2 mmol/L) and decreased cell growth ability at different time points. The biochemical parameters like ALT, AST, and GGT were significant improved by UDCA. UDCA treatment vividly repressed the activation of AKT, mTOR, and CRTC2 and the expression of nSREBP-1 in LO2 cells induced with OA.Our findings demonstrate the effect of UDCA in improving NAFLD. UDCA attenuates OA-induced hepatic steatosis mainly by regulation of AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1 signal transduction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23246637>Sex and age are determinants of the clinical phenotype of primary biliary cirrhosis and response to ursodeoxycholic .</a></h2><p>BACKGROUND, & AIMS: Studies of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) phenotypes largely have been performed using small and selected populations. Study size has precluded investigation of important disease subgroups, such as men and young patients. We used a national patient cohort to obtain a better picture of PBC phenotypes.We performed a cross-sectional study using the United Kingdom-PBC, patient cohort. Comprehensive data were collected for 2353 patients on diagnosis reports, response to therapy with ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), laboratory results, and symptom impact (assessed using the PBC-40 and other related measures).Seventy-nine percent of the patients reported current UDCA, therapy, with 80% meeting Paris response criteria. Men were significantly less likely to have responded to UDCA than women (72% vs 80% response rate; P < .05); male sex was an independent predictor of nonresponse on multivariate analysis. Age at diagnosis was associated strongly and independently with response to UDCA; response rates ranged from 90% among patients who presented with PBC when they were older than age 70, to less than 50% for those younger than age 30 (P < .0001). Patients who presented at younger ages also were significantly more likely not to respond to UDCA therapy, based on alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase response criteria, and more likely to report fatigue and pruritus. Women had mean fatigue scores 32% higher than men's (P < .0001). The increase in fatigue severity in women was related strongly (r = 0.58; P < .0001) to higher levels of autonomic symptoms (P < .0001).Among patients with PBC, response to UDCA, treatment and symptoms are related to sex and age at presentation, with the lowest response rates and highest levels of symptoms in women presenting at younger than age 50. Increased severity of fatigue in women is related to increased autonomic symptoms, making dysautonomia a plausible therapeutic target.Copyright © 2013 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

A pharmacological approach is necessary to treat NASH because of failure to change dietary habits and lifestyle in most patients. Insulin resistance with an increased release of free fatty acids, oxidative stress and activation of inflammatory cytokines seem to be key features for disease progression. Thiazolidinediones, such as pioglitazone and antioxidant agents, such as vitamin E, were the first pharmacological options to be evaluated for NASH. In recent years, several new molecules that target different pathways related to NASH pathogenesis, such as liver metabolic homeostasis, inflammation, oxidative stress and fibrosis, have been developed. Obeticholic  (INT-747) and elafibranor (GFT-505) have provided promising results in phase IIb, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials and they are being evaluated in ongoing phase III studies. Most of the potential treatments for NASH are under investigation in phase II studies, with some at phase I. This diversity in possible treatments calls for a better understanding of NASH in order to enrich trial populations with patients more susceptible to progress and to respond.

Some authors have even described  as a benign disease; however, it is presently considered a potentially serious disease that may evolve into liver cirrhosis and probably, liver cancer. It is more often related to female sex, obesity, and dyslipidemia, although it may be present in other population groups and associated with other factors. Its origin may be multifactorial, including insulin resistance, protein glycation, oxidative stress, and others. The disease may be asymptomatic and found in routine physical exams when the patient shows increased aminotransferases with no other explanation. At present the only specific diagnosis procedure is liver biopsy. The sole available current treatment is body weight control, normalizing glucose and lipid blood levels, as well as the administration of some medication, as illustrated in the subsequent article.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15654810>Treatment for : the value of histology.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28406477>miR-21 ablation and obeticholic  ameliorate nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in mice.</a></h2><p>microRNAs were recently suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a disease lacking specific pharmacological treatments. In that regard, nuclear receptors are arising as key molecular targets for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). Here we show that, in a typical model of -associated liver damage, microRNA-21 (miR-21) ablation results in a progressive decrease in steatosis, inflammation and lipoapoptosis, with impairment of fibrosis. In a complementary fast food (FF) diet  model, mimicking features of the metabolic syndrome, miR-21 levels increase in both liver and muscle, concomitantly with decreased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), a key miR-21 target. Strikingly, miR-21 knockout mice fed the FF diet supplemented with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist obeticholic  (OCA) display minimal steatosis, inflammation, oxidative stress and cholesterol accumulation. In addition, lipoprotein metabolism was restored, including decreased fatty  uptake and polyunsaturation, and liver and muscle insulin sensitivity fully reinstated. Finally, the miR-21/PPARα axis was found amplified in liver and muscle biopsies, and in serum, of NAFLD patients, co-substantiating its role in the development of the metabolic syndrome. By unveiling that miR-21 abrogation, together with FXR activation by OCA, significantly improves whole body metabolic parameters in , our results highlight the therapeutic potential of nuclear receptor multi-targeting therapies for NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28853202>Ursodeoxycholic : Effects on hepatic unfolded protein response, apoptosis and oxidative stress in morbidly obese patients.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is a secondary hydrophilic bile  (BA) used as therapy for a range of hepatobiliary diseases. Its efficacy in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is still under debate. Here, we aimed to decipher molecular mechanisms of UDCA in regulating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis, apoptosis and oxidative stress in morbidly obese patients.In this randomized controlled pharmacodynamic study, liver and serum samples from 40 well-matched morbidly obese NAFLD-patients were analysed. Patients received UDCA (20 mg/kg/d) or no treatment 3 weeks before samples were obtained during bariatric surgery.Patients treated with UDCA displayed higher scoring of steatosis (S), activity (A) and fibrosis (F), the so called SAF-scoring. UDCA partially disrupted ER homeostasis by inducing the expression of the ER stress markers CHOP and GRP78. However, ERDJ4 and sXBP1 levels were unaffected. Enhanced CHOP expression, a suggested pro-apoptotic trigger, failed to induce apoptosis via BAK and BAX in the UDCA treated group. Potentially pro-apoptotic miR-34a was reduced in the vesicle-free fraction in serum but not in liver after UDCA treatment. Thiobarbituric  reactive substances, 4-hydroxynonenal and mRNA levels of several oxidative stress indicators remained unchanged after UDCA treatment.Our data suggest that UDCA treatment has ambivalent effects in NAFLD patients. While increased SAF-scores and elevated CHOP levels may be disadvantageous in the UDCA treated cohort, UDCA's cytoprotective properties potentially changed the apoptotic threshold as reflected by absent induction of pro-apoptotic triggers. UDCA treatment failed to improve the oxidative stress status in NAFLD patients.ClinicalTrials.gov .© 2017 The Authors.

The aim of this study was to characterize bile  profiles in liver tissue of patients with steatohepatitis.Bile  composition was determined by gas-liquid chromatography in liver tissue from patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (; n=15), patients with alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH; n=14), and controls (n=8). Liver biopsies were graded for steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis.Bile acids were moderately increased in liver tissue of steatohepatitis patients compared with controls (P<0.05). , chenodeoxycholic, and cholic acids were elevated by 92, 64, and 43%, respectively, in patients with steatohepatitis (P<0.05). Cholic  was the prevailing bile  in  patients and in controls. More hydrophobic bile  species were elevated in ASH patients compared with controls (P<0.05). Significant correlations were found in  patients between hepatic chenodeoxycholic  and fibrosis, and between cholic  and trihydroxy/dihydroxy bile acids and inflammation (P<0.05). In patients with ASH, cholic  and trihydroxy/dihydroxy bile acids were correlated with steatosis (P<0.01).This study shows a distinct pattern of bile acids in the liver of patients with steatohepatitis. Further, the association between bile acids and histological liver injury suggests an association of specific bile acids and disease progression, possibly through bile -induced liver injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23727264>Efficacy and safety of the farnesoid X receptor agonist obeticholic  in patients with type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Obeticholic  (OCA; INT-747, 6α-ethyl-chenodeoxycholic ) is a semisynthetic derivative of the primary human bile  chenodeoxycholic , the natural agonist of the farnesoid X receptor, which is a nuclear hormone receptor that regulates glucose and lipid metabolism. In animal models, OCA decreases insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis.We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept study to evaluate the effects of OCA on insulin sensitivity in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients were randomly assigned to groups given placebo (n = 23), 25 mg OCA (n = 20), or 50 mg OCA (n = 21) once daily for 6 weeks. A 2-stage hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic insulin clamp was used to measure insulin sensitivity before and after the 6-week treatment period. We also measured levels of liver enzymes, lipid analytes, fibroblast growth factor 19, 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (a BA precursor), endogenous bile acids, and markers of liver fibrosis.When patients were given a low-dose insulin infusion, insulin sensitivity increased by 28.0% from baseline in the group treated with 25 mg OCA (P = .019) and 20.1% from baseline in the group treated with 50 mg OCA (P = .060). Insulin sensitivity increased by 24.5% (P = .011) in combined OCA groups, whereas it decreased by 5.5% in the placebo group. A similar pattern was observed in patients given a high-dose insulin infusion. The OCA groups had significant reductions in levels of γ-glutamyltransferase and alanine aminotransferase and dose-related weight loss. They also had increased serum levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and fibroblast growth factor 19, associated with decreased levels of 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one and endogenous bile acids, indicating activation of farnesoid X receptor. Markers of liver fibrosis decreased significantly in the group treated with 25 mg OCA. Adverse experiences were similar among groups.In this phase 2 trial, administration of 25 or 50 mg OCA for 6 weeks was well tolerated, increased insulin sensitivity, and reduced markers of liver inflammation and fibrosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

A major challenge has been the lack of suitable models expressing OSTα/β. Based on observations first reported here that hepatic OSTα/β is upregulated in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, the aim of this research was to develop an in vitro model to evaluate OSTα/β function and interaction with drugs and bile acids. OSTα/β expression in human liver tissue was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence. Radiolabeled compounds were used to determine OSTα/β-mediated transport in the established in vitro model. The effect of bile acids and drugs, including those associated with cholestatic drug-induced liver injury, on OSTα/β-mediated transport was evaluated. Expression of OSTα/β was elevated in the liver of patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and primary biliary cholangitis, whereas hepatocyte expression of OSTα/β was low in control liver tissue. Studies in the novel cell-based system showed rapid and linear OSTα/β-mediated transport for all tested compounds: dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, digoxin, estrone sulfate, and taurocholate. The interaction study with 26 compounds revealed novel OSTα/β inhibitors: a biomarker for cholestasis, glycochenodeoxycholic ; the major metabolite of troglitazone, troglitazone sulfate; and a macrocyclic antibiotic, fidaxomicin. Additionally, some drugs (e.g., digoxin) consistently stimulated taurocholate uptake in OSTα/β-overexpressing cells. Our findings demonstrate that OSTα/β is an important transporter in liver disease and imply a role for this transporter in bile -bile  and drug-bile  interactions, as well as cholestatic drug-induced liver injury. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The organic solute transporter OSTα/β is highly expressed in hepatocytes of liver tissue obtained from patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and primary biliary cholangitis. OSTα/β substrates exhibit rapid, linear, and concentration-driven transport in an OSTα/β-overexpressing cell line. Drugs associated with hepatotoxicity modulate OSTα/β-mediated taurocholate transport. These data suggest that hepatic OSTα/β plays an essential role in patients with cholestasis and may have important clinical implications for bile  and drug disposition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28692197>The Asia-Pacific Working Party on Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease guidelines 2017-Part 2: Management and special groups.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25864227>Obeticholic : expanding the therapeutic landscape of .</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9368828>Estimation of the cost savings resulting from the use of ursodiol for the prevention of gallstones in obese patients undergoing rapid weight reduction.</a></h2><p>Morbidly obese patients enrolled in a rapid weight reduction program are at a high risk of developing gallstones.

This study examines the cost consequences associated with the prophylactic use of ursodiol.A medical decision analysis model for the prophylactic administration of ursodiol in morbidly obese patients undergoing rapid weight reduction by either gastric bypass surgery or very-low-calorie-diet, was developed through the use of data from two clinical trials and review of the related literature. The expert opinion of clinicians from the fields of internal medicine, gastroenterology and surgery were solicited. Financial data for the charges associated with cholecystectomies, physician fees and ursodiol were obtained from current financial databases.The model demonstrates that the prophylactic administration of ursodiol, in morbidly obese patients undergoing rapid weight reduction, results in cost savings. Sensitivity analysis was performed to illustrate that the cost savings achieved by the prophylactic use of ursodiol were valid over a realistic range of charges and assumptions.The decision model may allow health care decision makers to apply their own data to the model to determine the cost savings obtainable through the prophylactic use of ursodiol in patients undergoing rapid weight reduction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10907390>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () is a liver disease that, until recently, has been underrecognized as a common cause of elevated liver enzymes.

In most cases of NAFLD, metabolic stress and cellular apoptosis are often driven by metabolic abnormality, eventually leading to inflammation and fibrosis . Along with a dramatic surge in the obesity epidemic, 10-20% of NAFLD patients ultimately progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), a precursor to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as multi-organ systemic diseases. Currently, diet and exercise are chiefly recommended to achieve significant weight loss and improve metabolic dysfunction in patients with NAFLD. However, weight loss remains to be an elusive goal for both clinical practitioners and NAFLD patients. To date, although there has not been any proven pharmacotherapy against NAFLD, numerous promising pipelines with good target engagement are under development. Moreover, given the global landmark phase 3 trials using obeticholic  (a farnesoid X receptor agonist, REGENERATE trial) and elafibranor (a dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α/δ agonist, RESOLVE-IT trial), the era of specific target therapies focusing on molecular and metabolic pathogenesis of  and fibrosis is near at hand. In this paper, we briefly cover the current and future therapeutic options in patients with NAFLD across the entire spectrum of diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24421392>c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1/c-Jun activation of the p53/microRNA 34a/sirtuin 1 pathway contributes to apoptosis induced by  in rat liver.</a></h2><p>MicroRNAs (miRs) are increasingly associated with metabolic liver diseases. We have shown that ursodeoxycholic , a hydrophilic bile , counteracts the miR-34a/sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)/p53 pathway, activated in the liver of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () patients. In contrast, hydrophobic bile acids, particularly  (DCA), activate apoptosis and are increased in . We evaluated whether DCA-induced apoptosis of rat hepatocytes occurs via miR-34a-dependent pathways and whether they connect with c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) induction. DCA enhanced miR-34a/SIRT1/p53 proapoptotic signaling in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In turn, miR-34a inhibition and SIRT1 overexpression significantly rescued targeting of the miR-34a pathway and apoptosis by DCA. In addition, p53 overexpression activated the miR-34a/SIRT1/p53 pathway, further induced by DCA. DCA increased p53 expression as well as p53 transcriptional activation of PUMA and miR-34a itself, providing a functional mechanism for miR-34a activation. JNK1 and c-Jun were shown to be major targets of DCA, upstream of p53, in engaging the miR-34a pathway and apoptosis. Finally, activation of this JNK1/miR-34a proapoptotic circuit was also shown to occur in vivo in the rat liver. These results suggest that the JNK1/p53/miR-34a/SIRT1 pathway may represent an attractive pharmacological target for the development of new drugs to arrest metabolism- and apoptosis-related liver pathologies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23974795>Ursodeoxycholyl lysophosphatidylethanolamide inhibits lipoapoptosis by shifting fatty  pools toward monosaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids in mouse hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholyl lysophosphatidylethanolamide (UDCA-LPE) is a hepatoprotectant in inhibiting apoptosis, inflammation, and hyperlipidemia in mouse models of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). We studied the ability of UDCA-LPE to inhibit palmitate (Pal)-induced apoptosis in primary hepatocytes and delineate cytoprotective mechanisms. We showed that lipoprotection by UDCA-LPE was mediated by cAMP and was associated with increases in triglycerides (TGs) and phospholipids (PLs). An inhibitor of cAMP-effector protein kinase A partially reversed the protective effects of UDCA-LPE. Lipidomic analyses of fatty acids and PL composition revealed a shift of lipid metabolism from saturated Pal to monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, mainly, oleate, docosapentaenoate, and docosahexaenoate. The latter two ω-3 fatty acids were particularly found in phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine pools. The catalysis of Pal by stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1) is a known mechanism for the channeling of Pal away from apoptosis. SCD-1 protein was upregulated during UDCA-LPE lipoprotection. SCD-1 knockdown of Pal-treated cells showed further increased apoptosis, and the extent of UDCA-LPE protection was reduced. Thus, the major mechanism of UDCA-LPE lipoprotection involved a metabolic shift from toxic saturated toward cytoprotective unsaturated fatty acids in part via SCD-1. UDCA-LPE may thus be a therapeutic agent for treatment of  by altering distinct pools of fatty acids for storage into TGs and PLs, and the latter may protect lipotoxicity at the membrane levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27773935>Alisol B 23-acetate protects against non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in mice via farnesoid X receptor activation.</a></h2><p>Alisol B 23-acetate (AB23A) is a natural triterpenoid isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine rhizoma alismatis, which exhibits a number of pharmacological activities, including anti-hepatitis virus, anti-cancer and antibacterial effects. In this study we examined whether AB23A protected against non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in mice, and the mechanisms underlying the protective effects. NASH was induced in mice fed a methionine and choline-deficient (MCD) diet for 4 weeks. The mice were simultaneously treated with AB23A (15, 30, and 60 mg·kg·d, ig) for 4 weeks. On the last day, blood samples and livers were collected. Serum liver functional enzymes, inflammatoru markers were assessed. The livers were histologically examined using H&E, Oil Red O, Masson's trichrome and Sirius Red staining. Mouse primary hepatocytes were used for in vitro experiments. The mechanisms underlying AB23A protection were analyzed using siRNA, qRT-PCR, and Western blot assays. AB23A treatment significantly and dose-dependently decreased the elevated levels of serum ALT and AST in MCD diet-fed mice. Furthermore, AB23A treatment significantly reduced hepatic triglyceride accumulation, inflammatory cell infiltration and hepatic fibrosis in the mice. AB23A-induced decreases in serum and hepatic lipids were related to decreased hepatic lipogenesis through decreasing hepatic levels of SREBP-1c, FAS, ACC1 and SCD1 and increased lipid metabolism via inducing PPARα, CPT1α, ACADS and LPL. The reduction in inflammatory cell infiltration corresponded to deceased serum levels of mKC and MCP-1 and decreased hepatic gene expression of MCP-1 and VCAM-1. The reduction in hepatic fibrosis was correlated with decreased hepatic gene expression of fibrosis markers. The protective effects of AB23A were FXR-dependent, because treatment with the FXR agonist CDCA mimicked AB23A-induced hepato-protection in the mice, whereas co-administration of FXR antagonist guggulsterone abrogated AB23A-induced hepato-protection. In mouse primary hepatocytes, FXR gene silencing abrogated AB23A-induced changes in gene expression of Apo C-II, CPT1α, ACADS and LPL.

The impact of these treatments on the progression of  was evaluated.We show that high expression of DR5 in livers from NEMO(Δhepa) mice is accompanied by an abundant presence of bile acids (BAs), misregulation of BA transporters and significant alteration of lipid metabolism-related genes. Additionally, mice lacking NEMO in hepatocytes spontaneously showed ductular response at young age. Unexpectedly, feeding of NEMO(Δhepa) mice with low-fat diet failed to improve chronic liver injury. Conversely, anti-cholestatic treatment with nor-ursodeoxycholic  (NorUDCA), but not with ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), led to a significant attenuation of liver damage in NEMO(Δhepa) mice. The strong therapeutic effect of NorUDCA relied on a significant downregulation of LXR-dependent lipogenesis and the normalisation of BA metabolism through mechanisms involving cross-talk between Cyp7a1 and SHP. This was associated with the significant improvement of liver histology, NEMO(Δhepa)/NorUDCA-treated mice showed lower apoptosis and reduced CyclinD1 expression, indicating attenuation of the compensatory proliferative response to hepatocellular damage. Finally, fibrosis and ductular reaction markers were significantly reduced in NorUDCA-treated NEMO(Δhepa) mice.Overall, our work demonstrates the contribution of bile acids metabolism to the progression of  in the absence of hepatocyte-NF-kB through mechanisms involving DR5-apoptosis, inflammation and fibrosis.

We explored the pharmaco-toxicological effects of OCA on patho-physiological pathways in hepatocytes using a previously described perfused organotypic liver system that allows culture in near-physiological insulin/glucose milieus, and exhibits drug responses at clinically-relevant concentrations. Primary hepatocytes experienced 48-hour exposure to OCA at concentrations approximating therapeutic (0.5μM) and supratherapeutic (10μM) levels. Global transcriptomics by RNAseq was complimented by cellular viability (MTT), CYP activity assays, and secreted FGF19 levels in the media. Dose-dependent, transcriptional effects suggested suppression of bile  synthesis (↓CYP7A1, ↓CYP27A1) and increased bile efflux (↑ABCB4, ↑ABCB11, ↑OSTA, ↑OSTB). Pleiotropic effects included suppression of TGFβ and IL-6 signaling pathways, and signatures suggestive of HDL suppression (↑SCARB1, ↓ApoAI, ↓LCAT) and LDL elevation (↑ApoB, ↓CYP7A1).

However, understanding of the precise mechanism of this process remains incomplete. A new class steatohepatitis-inducing high-fat diet (HFD), namely STHD-01, can promote the development of HCC without the administration of chemical carcinogens. Using this diet, we comprehensively analyzed changes in the gut microbiota and its metabolic functions during the development of HCC in . Mice fed the STHD-01 developed  within 9 weeks.  further progressed into HCC by 41 weeks. Treatment with antibiotics significantly attenuated liver pathology and suppressed tumor development, indicating the critical role of the gut microbiota in tumor development in this model. Accumulation of cholesterol and bile acids in the liver and feces increased after feeding the mice with STHD-01. Treatment with antibiotics did not reverse these phenotypes. In contrast, accumulation of secondary bile acids was dramatically reduced after the treatment with antibiotics, suggesting the critical role of the gut microbiota in the conversion of primary bile acids to secondary bile acids. Secondary bile acids such as  activated the mTOR, pathway in hepatocytes. Activation of mTOR was observed in the liver of mice fed STHD-01, and the activation was reduced when mice were treated with antibiotics.

UDCA reportedly counteracts the effects of endotoxemia. Previously, we demonstrated attenuated hepatic fibrogenesis and suppression of activated hepatic stellate cells (Ac-HSC) with an angiotensin-II (AT-II) type 1 receptor blocker (ARB). Here we evaluated the simultaneous effect of both agents on hepatic fibrogenesis in a rat model of NASH.Fischer 344 rats were fed a choline-deficient L-amino--defined (CDAA) diet for 8 weeks. The therapeutic effect of UDCA and ARB was evaluated along with hepatic fibrogenesis, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) regulatory cascade, and intestinal barrier function. The direct inhibitory effect of both UDCA and ARB on Ac-HSC was assessed in vitro.Both UDCA and ARB had a potent inhibitory effect on hepatic fibrogenesis with suppression of the HSC activation and hepatic expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and TLR4. UDCA decreased intestinal permeability by ameliorating zonula occuludens-1 (ZO-1) disruption induced by the CDAA diet. ARB was found to directly suppress regulation of Ac-HSC.UDCA and ARB have a synergistic repressive effect on hepatic fibrogenesis by counteracting endotoxemia induced by intestinal barrier dysfunction and suppressing the activation of Ac-HSC. Because both agents are currently used in clinical practice, combined UDCA and ARB may represent a promising novel therapeutic approach for NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24053454>The role of ursodeoxycholic  in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: a systematic review.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () is a condition that occurs during the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

Patient characteristics and trial endpoints were analyzed, with quality assessment according to widely acknowledged criteria. P < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant in all trials.Twelve qualified randomized clinical trials, including six from China and involving 1160 subjects, were selected. Seven of these trials assessed the effects of UDCA Monotherapy, with the other five testing combinations of UDCA with vitamin E, polyene phosphatidylcholine, silymarin, glycyrrhizin and tiopronin. The duration of therapy ranged from 3 to 24 months, with two studies using high doses of UDCA (23-35 mg/kg/d). The average quality point was 2.69, and was significantly lower in articles from China than in those from Western countries (2.2 ± 0.4 vs. 3.8 ± 1.1, respectively, p < 0.05). UDCA Monotherapy significantly improved liver function in five studies and improved steatosis and fibrosis in two studies. All five studies assessing UDCA combination therapy showed significant improvements liver function, while two studies also improved steatosis and inflammation. One study of high-dose UDCA showed significant improvements in ALT, γGT and liver fibrosis, whereas the other study showed no significant change in ALT and liver pathology.UDCA therapy is effective in , especially when combined with other drugs.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the hepatic hallmark of MetS, is regarded as an active player in the pathogenesis of MetS-associated cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study was aimed at evaluating the relationship between MetS-induced NASH and penile dysfunction. We used a non-genomic, high fat diet (HFD)-induced, rabbit model of MetS, and treated HFD rabbits with testosterone (T), with the selective farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist obeticholic  (OCA), or with the anti-TNFα mAb infliximab. Rabbits fed a regular diet were used as controls. Liver histomorphological and gene expression analysis demonstrated NASH in HFD rabbits. Several genes related to inflammation (including TNFα), activation of stellate cells, fibrosis, and lipid metabolism parameters were negatively associated to maximal acetylcholine (Ach)-induced relaxation in penis. When all these putative liver determinants of penile Ach responsiveness were tested as covariates in a multivariate model, only the association between hepatic TNFα expression and Ach response was confirmed. Accordingly, circulating levels of TNFα were increased 15-fold in HFD rabbits. T and OCA dosing in HFD rabbits both reduced TNFα liver expression and plasma levels, with a parallel increase of penile eNOS expression and responsiveness to Ach. Also neutralization of TNFα with infliximab treatment fully normalized HFD-induced hypo-responsiveness to Ach, as well as responsiveness to vardenafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor. Thus, MetS-induced NASH in HFD rabbits plays an active role in the pathogenesis of ED, likely through TNFα, as indicated by treatments reducing liver and circulating TNFα levels (T or OCA), or neutralizing TNFα action (infliximab), which significantly improve penile responsiveness to Ach in HFD rabbits.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, the precise molecular mechanisms through which obesity promotes HCC development are still unclear. Recent studies have shown that gut microbiota may influence liver diseases by transferring its metabolites and components. Here, we show that the hepatic translocation of obesity-induced lipoteichoic  (LTA), a Gram-positive gut microbial component, promotes HCC development by creating a tumor-promoting microenvironment. LTA enhances the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) of hepatic stellate cells (HSC) collaboratively with an obesity-induced gut microbial metabolite, , to upregulate the expression of SASP factors and COX2 through Toll-like receptor 2. Interestingly, COX2-mediated prostaglandin E (PGE) production suppresses the antitumor immunity through a PTGER4 receptor, thereby contributing to HCC progression. Moreover, COX2 overexpression and excess PGE production were detected in HSCs in human HCCs with noncirrhotic, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), indicating that a similar mechanism could function in humans. We showed the importance of the gut-liver axis in obesity-associated HCC. The gut microbiota-driven COX2 pathway produced the lipid mediator PGE in senescent HSCs in the tumor microenvironment, which plays a pivotal role in suppressing antitumor immunity, suggesting that PGE and its receptor may be novel therapeutic targets for noncirrhotic -associated HCC. .©2017 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17162245>Randomized placebo-controlled trial of ursodeoxycholic  with vitamin e in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () is a frequent liver disease that can progress to cirrhosis and for which there is no recognized therapy.

Protection was most effective against the ip challenge route and less effective against the iv route. A study of the kinetics of the population of bacteria in the spleens and livers of immunized animals showed that after ip challenge there was an initial reduction of 99% at 6 hr after challenge, maintenance of levels of less than 10(3) bacteria per organ, and a final population of 10(2) to 10(3) per organ at 21 days. With iv challenge, after an initial reduction of 90% at 6 hr, growth ensued to levels above 10(6) bacteria per organ until 8 days, followed by a steady decline yielding residual populations of 10(3) to 10(4) in some cases. Organ hypertrophy correlated with bacterial population. Morbidity was prevented (as measured by gain in body weight) by immunization against ip challenge but not against iv challenge. Killed vaccines protected by their ability to induce an immune state which reduced the initial challenge population, prevented extensive multiplication, yet allowed "cellular immunity" to develop due to response to the living challenge infection itself. The consequence was a low-level carrier state similar to that induced by recovery from sublethal virulent infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30222962>Factors Associated With Histologic Response in Adult Patients With Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () is a leading cause of liver transplantation, and many trials are underway to evaluate potential therapies.

We performed a secondary analysis of data from this trial to identify clinical parameters associated with a histologic response.We used a logistic regression model with a stepwise selection procedure to identify baseline and early on-treatment factors associated with a histologic response at 72 weeks. Baseline demographics, liver histology, medical history, concomitant medications, cardiometabolic parameters, and serum biochemistry, as well as the changes over the course of the trial (at weeks 12 and 24), were evaluated as potential predictors of a histologic response. The model was cross-validated by a jackknife method, and performance was evaluated with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.The logistic regression model found that obeticholic  treatment, baseline NAS > 5, baseline triglyceride level ≤ 154 mg/dL, baseline international normalized ratio ≤ 1, baseline aspartate aminotransferase level ≤ 49 U/L, and a decrease in alanine aminotransferase level at week 24 by 17 U/L or more, to be significantly associated with histologic response (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-0.89; P < .0001).In a secondary analysis of data from a clinical trial of obeticholic  in patients with , we identified routine clinical and laboratory parameters during the first 24 weeks of treatment (such as baseline NAS, triglyceride levels, and a decrease in alanine aminotransferase level) to significantly associate with histologic markers of response.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

As an experimental approach for treatment of NAFLD, we synthesized the bile -phospholipid conjugate ursodeoxycholyl lysophosphatidylethanolamide (UDCA-LPE). Previous work demonstrated profound hepatoprotective properties of the conjugate in vitro and in vivo. Here we investigated the effects of UDCA-LPE in two nutritional mouse models of NAFLD. C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 28 weeks, resulting in steatosis with hyperlipidemia. In a second model, mice received a methionin-choline-deficient (MCD) diet for up to 11 weeks, which induced advanced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). Establishment of liver injury was followed by intraperitoneal injections of 30 mg/kg UDCA-LPE three times a week for different time periods. UDCA-LPE ameliorated both HFD- and MCD-induced increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values near to normalization. As for metabolic parameters, UDCA-LPE reduced elevated serum triglyceride and cholesterol values in HFD mice. Liver histology showed improvement of steatosis in HFD and MCD mice concomitant with reductions in hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol levels. Additionally, the conjugate lowered serum caspase-8 activity in both models and decreased lipid hydroperoxides in MCD mice. Abundance of proinflammatory lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), which was detectable in both HFD and MCD mice, was reduced by UDCA-LPE. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction qRT-PCR of liver specimens revealed that UDCA-LPE strongly down-regulated inflammatory genes and modified the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism.The current study demonstrates that UDCA-LPE improves hepatic injury at different stages of NAFLD. By concurrently lowering hepatic lipid overloading as well as susceptibility of hepatocytes toward inflammatory stimuli, the conjugate may be able to ameliorate disease progression. Thus, UDCA-LPE represents a promising compound suitable for the treatment of NAFLD.Copyright © 2012 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27214981>[EFFICIENCY OF URSODEOXYCHOLIC  APPLICATION IN NONALCOCHOLIC STEATOHEPATITIS].</a></h2><p>to estimate the efficiency of ursodeoxycholic  (UDHC) in nonalcocholic steatohepatitis () by analysis of conventional clinical datas, apoptosis and liver perfusion parameters.UDHC was used as monotherapy in treatment of 92  patients in daily dose 10-15 mg/kg.

Through systematic literature review, we identified nine randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) including 964 patients with biopsy-proven NASH, comparing vitamin E, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), pentoxifylline, or obeticholic  to one another or placebo. The primary outcome was improvement in fibrosis stage; secondary outcomes were improvement in ballooning degeneration, lobular inflammation, and steatosis. We reported relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from direct meta-analysis and 95% credible intervals (CrIs) from Bayesian network meta-analysis, and used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria to appraise quality of evidence. Moderate-quality evidence supports the use of pentoxifylline (RR, 0.26; 95% CrI: 0.05-1.00) and obeticholic  (RR, 0.81; 95% CI: 0.70-0.95) over placebo in improving fibrosis. High-quality evidence supports the effect of vitamin E, TZDs, and obeticholic  over placebo in improving ballooning degeneration. All four interventions seemed to have at least moderate-quality evidence over placebo to improve steatosis. Moderate-quality evidence supports that TZDs, pentoxifylline, and obeticholic  decrease lobular inflammation. All the head-to-head comparisons were supported by very-low-quality evidence except for superiority of TZDs over vitamin E on improving steatosis and lobular inflammation, which had moderate-quality evidence.Based on direct and network meta-analysis, pentoxifylline and obeticholic  improve fibrosis, and vitamin E, TZDs, and obeticholic  improve ballooning degeneration in patients with NASH.

The modulation of gut microbiota, bile acids and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) axis is correlated with obesity-induced insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in mice. However, the interactions among the gut microbiota, bile acids and FXR in metabolic disorders remained largely unexplored in hamsters. In the current study, hamsters fed a 60% high-fat diet (HFD) were administered vehicle or an antibiotic cocktail by gavage twice a week for four weeks. Antibiotic treatment alleviated HFD-induced glucose intolerance, hepatic steatosis and inflammation accompanied with decreased hepatic lipogenesis and elevated thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT). In the livers of antibiotic-treated hamsters, cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily B member 1 (CYP7B1) in the alternative bile  synthesis pathway was upregulated, contributing to a more hydrophilic bile  profile with increased tauro--muricholic  (TMCA).

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (omega-3) has been reported to alleviate experimental NASH, although its beneficial effect was not evident when tested clinically. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the additive effect of omega-3 and ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) on diet-induced NASH in mice. C57BL/6 mice were given a high-fat diet (HFD) for 24 weeks, at which point the mice were divided into three groups and fed HFD alone, HFD with omega-3 or HFD with omega-3 in combination with UDCA for another 24 weeks. Feeding mice an HFD and administering omega-3 improved histologically assessed liver fibrosis, and UDCA in combination with omega-3 further attenuated this disease. The assessment of collagen α1(I) expression agreed with the histological evaluation. Omega-3 in combination with UDCA resulted in a significant attenuation of inflammation whereas administering omega-3 alone failed to improve histologically assessed liver inflammation. Quantitative analysis of tumor necrosis factor α showed an additive effect of omega-3 and UDCA on liver inflammation. HFD-induced hepatic triglyceride accumulation was attenuated by omega-3 and adding UDCA accentuated this effect. In accordance with this result, the expression of sterol regulatory binding protein-1c decreased after omega-3 administration and adding UDCA further diminished SREBP-1c expression. The expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which may reflect oxidative stress-induced tissue damage, was suppressed by omega-3 administration and adding UDCA further attenuated iNOS expression.

Currently there is no approved treatment for NASH. It is known that bile acids not only have physiological roles in lipid digestion but also have strong hormonal properties. We have synthesized a novel chenodeoxycholyl-arginine ethyl ester conjugate (CDCArg) for the treatment of NAFLD.Chemical synthesis of CDCArg was performed. Experiments for prevention and treatment of NAFLD were carried out on C57BL/6 J male mice that were treated with high fat diet (HFD, 60% calories from fat). CDCArg or cholic  bile acids were admixture into the diets. Food consumption, weight gain, liver histology, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test, biochemical analysis and blood parameters were assessed at the end of the experiment after 5 weeks of diet (prevention study) or after 14 weeks of diet (treatment study). In the treatment study CDCArg was admixture into the diet at weeks 10-14.In comparison to HFD treated mice, mice treated with HFD supplemented with CDCArg, showed reduced liver steatosis, reduced body weight and decreased testicular fat and liver tissue mass. Blood glucose, cholesterol, insulin and leptin levels were also lower in this group. No evidence of toxicity of CDCArg was recorded. In fact, liver injury, as evaluated using plasma hepatic enzyme levels, was low in mice treated with HFD and CDCArg when compared to mice treated with HFD and cholic .CDCArg supplementation protected the liver against HFD-induced NAFLD without any toxic effects. These results indicate that basic amino acids e.g., L-arginine and bile acids conjugates may be a potential therapy for NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30511198>Disease Progression and Pharmacological Intervention in a Nutrient-Deficient Rat Model of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>There is a marked need for improved animal models of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () to facilitate the development of more efficacious drug therapies for the disease.Here, we investigated the development of fibrotic  in male Wistar rats fed a choline-deficient L-amino -defined (CDAA) diet with or without cholesterol supplementation for subsequent assessment of drug treatment efficacy in  biopsy-confirmed rats.

In 5-20%, there is a progression from NAFL to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Until now, it is not well understood why only some patients develop NASH, and currently, no drugs are licensed for this indication. Different T-cell populations such as T-regulatory, Th1 and Th17 cells play a central role in the immunopathogenesis of fatty liver disease and open the option of future interleukin (IL)-17-based therapeutics. The inflammatory process underlying NASH is furthermore characterized by elevated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and IL-1β. Anakinra, a recombinant version of IL-1Ra shows promising metabolic effects with improved hyperglycemia and beta-cell secretory function in a double-blind placebo controlled randomized trial in type 2 diabetic patients but such studies are still in their preliminary stages for NASH. Several studies point out that bile  farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-mediated signals (such as the enterohepatic hormone fibroblast growth factor 15/19) are involved in the regulation of triglyceride and glucose metabolism. Recent clinical trials have revealed a beneficial impact of the FXR agonist obeticholic  on body weight, insulin sensitivity and liver histology in patients with NASH.

Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 using a computer-generated, centrally administered procedure, stratified by clinical centre and  status. The primary outcome measure was improvement in centrally scored liver histology defined as a decrease in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score by at least 2 points without worsening of fibrosis from baseline to the end of treatment. A planned interim analysis of change in alanine aminotransferase at 24 weeks undertaken before end-of-treatment (72 weeks) biopsies supported the decision to continue the trial (relative change in alanine aminotransferase -24%, 95% CI -45 to -3). A planned interim analysis of the primary outcome showed improved efficacy of obeticholic  (p=0·0024) and supported a decision not to do end-of-treatment biopsies and end treatment early in 64 patients, but to continue the trial to obtain the 24-week post-treatment measures.

Here, we show that the intrahepatic retention of hydrophobic BAs including deoxycholate (DCA), taurocholate (TCA), taurochenodeoxycholate (TCDCA), and taurolithocholate (TLCA) were substantially increased in a streptozotocin and high fat diet (HFD) induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-hepatocellular carcinoma (NASH-HCC) mouse model. Additionally chronic HFD-fed mice spontaneously developed liver tumors with significantly increased hepatic BA levels. Enhancing intestinal excretion of hydrophobic BAs in the NASH-HCC model mice by a 2% cholestyramine feeding significantly prevented HCC development. The gut microbiota alterations were closely correlated with altered BA levels in liver and feces. HFD-induced inflammation inhibited key BA transporters, resulting in sustained increases in intrahepatic BA concentrations. Our study also showed a significantly increased cell proliferation in BA treated normal human hepatic cell lines and a down-regulated expression of tumor suppressor gene CEBPα in TCDCA treated HepG2 cell line, suggesting that several hydrophobic BAs may collaboratively promote liver carcinogenesis.© 2016 UICC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17410287>Therapeutic options in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ().

However, disease pathogenesis remains largely unknown. microRNA (miRNA or miR) expression has recently been reported to be altered in human , and modulated by ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) in the rat liver. Here, we aimed at evaluating the miR-34a/Sirtuin 1(SIRT1)/p53 pro-apoptotic pathway in human NAFLD, and to elucidate its function and modulation by UDCA in the rat liver and primary rat hepatocytes.Liver biopsies were obtained from NAFLD morbid obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Rat livers were collected from animals fed a 0.4% UDCA diets. Primary rat hepatocytes were incubated with bile acids or free fatty acids (FFAs) and transfected with a specific miRNA-34a precursor and/or with a p53 overexpression plasmid. p53 transcriptional activity was assessed by ELISA and target reporter constructs.miR-34a, apoptosis and acetylated p53 increased with disease severity, while SIRT1 diminished in the NAFLD liver. UDCA inhibited the miR-34a/SIRT1/p53 pathway in the rat liver in vivo and in primary rat hepatocytes. miR-34a overexpression confirmed its targeting by UDCA, which prevented miR-34a-dependent repression of SIRT1, p53 acetylation, and apoptosis. Augmented apoptosis by FFAs in miR-34a overexpressing cells was also inhibited by UDCA. Finally, p53 overexpression activated miR-34a/SIRT1/p53, which in turn was inhibited by UDCA, via decreased p53 transcriptional activity.Our results support a link between liver cell apoptosis and miR-34a/SIRT1/p53 signaling, specifically modulated by UDCA, and NAFLD severity.

Obeticholic  (OCA), a promising drug for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and type 2 , activates FXR. Mouse studies demonstrated that FXR activation by OCA alters hepatic expression of many genes. However, no data are available on the effects of OCA in the human liver. Here we generated gene expression profiles in human precision cut liver slices (hPCLS) after treatment with OCA.hPCLS were incubated with OCA for 24 h. Wild-type or FXR(-/-) mice received OCA or vehicle by oral gavage for 7 days.Transcriptomic analysis showed that well-known FXR target genes, including NR0B2 (SHP), ABCB11 (BSEP), SLC51A (OSTα) and SLC51B (OSTβ), and ABCB4 (MDR3) are regulated by OCA in hPCLS. Ingenuity pathway analysis confirmed that 'FXR/RXR activation' is the most significantly changed pathway upon OCA treatment. Comparison of gene expression profiles in hPCLS and mouse livers identified 18 common potential FXR targets. ChIP-sequencing in mouse liver confirmed FXR binding to IR1 sequences of Akap13, Cgnl1, Dyrk3, Pdia5, Ppp1r3b and Tbx6.Our study shows that hPCLS respond to OCA treatment by upregulating well-known FXR target genes, demonstrating its suitability to study FXR-mediated gene regulation. We identified six novel bona-fide FXR target genes in both mouse and human liver.
