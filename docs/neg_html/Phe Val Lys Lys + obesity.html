It is affecting approximately up to 14% of all pregnancies with an increasing tendency. GDM has been related to relevant short-term and long-term health complications for both mother and offspring. Recent studies strongly emphasized the role of several essential amino acids in the pathogenesis of  and highlighted their strong correlation with insulin resistance, but there are no references related to modifications in D-AAs in biological fluids. As D-AA elimination proceeds mainly by renal excretion, urine was the selected sample to evaluate the alterations in free D-AAs ratio in a GDM study. Only 1 mL of first void urine or standard solution was required for purification, by using a Discovery DSC-SCX SPE cartridge (500 mg/3 mL) and derivatization into their N(O)-pentafluoropropionyl amino acid 2-propyl esters. Enantiomeric separation was carried out by GC-MS on a Chirasil-L- N-propionyl-L-valine-tert-butylamide polysiloxane fused-silica capillary column (25 m×0.25 mm I.D., 0.12 μm film thickness, Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany), under programmed temperature elution. Detection was performed with an ion trap mass analyzer, operating in the full scan mode in the m/z 50-350 range. 14 pairs of derivatives of D-and L-AAs were separated. The steps of sample preparation, derivatization and GC-MS conditions were optimized for both urine and standards. Several conditions affecting the SPE procedure, such as sorbent mass/volume ratio of the cartridge, sample dilution and pH, were optimized. Volume of reagents and solvents and reaction temperature and time were also tested for the derivatization. Regarding the GC-MS parameters, split ratio, temperature program and mass range were optimized. The final method was validated in terms of linearity, sensitivity, accuracy and precision for D-Ala, D-Pro, D-Ser, D-Met, D-, D-Glu, D-Orn and D-. Identification of AAs in urine samples was based on retention time and mass spectra. Urine from 20 women with GDM and 20 pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance (after 2-h 75-g oral glucose tolerance test), matched according to the week of gestation and age (22-28 week of gestation and age 24-37 years), were enrolled into the study. %D-Relative amounts were determined for Ala, , Thr, Ser, Leu, Asx (Asp+Asn), Glx (Glu+Gln), Met, , Tyr, Orn and . Statistically significant differences (p<0.05) were observed only for D- and higher values were found in the GDM group. It is possible that D- could be involved in metabolic/signaling pathways to compensate early stages of insulin resistance, although further work is necessary to confirm this hypothesis.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Five melanocortin receptors have been identified to date and belong to the family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). Post-translational modification of the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) prohormone leads to the biosynthesis of the endogenous melanocortin agonists, including α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH), β-MSH, γ-MSH, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). All the melanocortin agonists derived from the POMC prohormone contain a His--Arg-Trp tetrapeptide sequence that has been implicated in eliciting the pharmacological responses at the melanocortin receptors. Herein, an alanine (Ala) positional scan is reported for the endogenous α-MSH ligand and the synthetic, more potent, NDP-MSH peptide (Ac-Ser(1)-Tyr(2)-Ser(3)-Nle(4)-Glu(5)-His(6)-DPhe(7)-Arg(8)-Trp(9)-Gly(10)-(11)-Pro(12)-(13)-NH2) at the cloned mouse melanocortin receptors to test the assumption that the structure-activity relationships of one ligand would apply to the other. Several residues outside of the postulated pharmacophore altered potency at the melanocortin receptors, most notably the 1560-, 37-, and 15-fold potency loss when the Glu(5) position of α-MSH was substituted with Ala at the mMC1R, mMC3R, and mMC4R, respectively. Importantly, the altered potencies due to Ala substitutions in α-MSH did not necessarily correlate with equivalent Ala substitutions in NDP-MSH, indicating that structural modifications and corresponding biological activities in one of these melanocortin ligands may not be predictive for the other agonist.</p></html>
