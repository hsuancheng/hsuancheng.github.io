Several scorpion peptide toxins-charybdotoxin (ChTX), kaliotoxin (KITX), and agitoxin (AgTX)-also block the channel with high affinity and specificity. Here, we examine the interaction predicted when the toxins are docked onto the molecular model of the K+ channel pore that we recently proposed. Docking with the model of the Kv1.3 channel started by location of -27 side chain into the central axis of the pore, followed by energy minimization. In the optimal arrangement, Arg-24 of KITX or AgTX forms a hydrogen bond with the Asp-386 carboxyl of one subunit, and -30 is in immediate contact with Asp-386 of the opposing subunit in the tetramer. Toxin residues in proximity to the side chain of -27 (-25, Thr-36, Met-29, and Ser-11 in KITX) interact with the four C-end -404s. For ChTX the interaction with Asp-386 is reduced, but this is compensated by additional nonbonded interactions formed by Tyr-36 and Arg-34. Comparison of calculated energy of interaction of these specific toxin-channel residues with experimental studies reveals good agreement. The similar total calculated energy of interaction is consistent with the similar IC50 for Kv1.3 block by KITX and AgTX. Steric contacts of residues in position 380 of the S5-P linker with residues on the upper part of toxins permit reconstruction of the K+ channel outer vestibule walls, which are about 30 A apart and about 9 A high. Molecular modeling shows complementarity of the pore model to toxin spacial structures, and supports the proposal that the N-terminal borders of the P regions surround residues of their C-terminal halves.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18753605>Select nutrients in the ovine uterine lumen. I. Amino acids, glucose, and ions in uterine lumenal flushings of cyclic and pregnant ewes.</a></h2><p>Nutrients in uterine secretions are essential for development and survival of conceptuses (embryo and associated extraembryonic membranes) during pregnancy; however, little is known about changes in the amounts of specific nutrients in the uterine fluids of cyclic and pregnant ruminants. This study determined quantities of glucose, amino acids, glutathione, calcium, sodium, and potassium in uterine lumenal fluid from cyclic (Days 3-16) and pregnant (Days 10-16) ewes. Total recoverable glucose, Arg, Gln, Leu, Asp, Glu, , , beta-Ala, Tyr, Trp, Met, Val, , Ile, , Cys, Pro, glutathione, calcium, and sodium were greater in the uterine fluid of pregnant compared with cyclic ewes between Days 10 and 16. In cyclic ewes, only modest changes in the total amounts of glucose, , Cit, Tyr, Trp, Met, Val, Cys, glutathione, calcium, and potassium were detected between Days 3 and 16. However, in pregnant ewes, amounts of glucose, Arg, Gln, Glu, Gly, Cys, Leu, Pro, glutathione, calcium, and potassium in uterine fluids increased 3- to 23-fold between Days 10 and 14 and remained high to Day 16. Of particular interest were increases in glucose, Arg, Leu, and Gln in uterine flushings of pregnant ewes between Days 10 and 16 of pregnancy. Total amounts of , ornithine, , Ser, Thr, Ile, , Trp, Met, and Cit in uterine fluids also increased, but to a lesser extent during early pregnancy. These novel results indicate activation of pregnancy-associated mechanisms for transport of nutrients into the uterine lumen, and they provide a framework for future studies of nutrients, including glucose, amino acids, and glutathione, required to activate nutrient-sensing cell signaling pathways for growth, development, and survival of conceptuses, as well as for optimization of culture media for in vitro studies of conceptus development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2989287>Amino acid sequence of the active site peptide of bovine intestinal 5'-nucleotide phosphodiesterase and identification of the active site residue as threonine.</a></h2><p>We report here the identification of the amino acid residue which forms the covalent intermediate in the catalytic mechanism of bovine intestinal 5'-nucleotide phosphodiesterase and the sequence of the neighboring amino acids. The active site of 5'-nucleotide phosphodiesterase was labeled using thymidine 5'-[alpha-32P]triphosphate as substrate. A single labeled cyanogen bromide peptide was isolated using reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. After subdigestion with endoproteinase -C and chymotrypsin, the entire amino acid sequence of the 60-residue active site peptide was obtained using automated Edman degradation. All of the radioactivity of the active site peptide was localized to a hexapeptide with sequence Thr--Pro---Tyr. Phosphoamino acid analysis of this peptide indicated that the labeled residue was threonine. We are not aware of any other enzymes in which threonine is phosphorylated as a covalent intermediate in the catalytic mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10671523>The molecular structure of hyperthermostable aromatic aminotransferase with novel substrate specificity from Pyrococcus horikoshii.</a></h2><p>Aromatic amino acid aminotransferase (ArATPh), which has a melting temperature of 120 degrees C, is one of the most thermostable aminotransferases yet to be discovered. The crystal structure of this aminotransferase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii was determined to a resolution of 2.1 A. ArATPh has a homodimer structure in which each subunit is composed of two domains, in a manner similar to other well characterized aminotransferases. By the least square fit after superposing on a mesophilic ArAT, the ArATPh molecule exhibits a large deviation of the main chain coordinates, three shortened alpha-helices, an elongated loop connecting two domains, and a long loop transformed from an alpha-helix, which are all factors that are likely to contribute to its hyperthermostability. The pyridine ring of the cofactor pyridoxal 5'-phosphate covalently binding to (233) is stacked parallel to F121 on one side and interacts with the geminal dimethyl-CH/pi groups of Val(201) on the other side. This tight stacking against the pyridine ring probably contributes to the hyperthermostability of ArATPh. Compared with other ArATs, ArATPh has a novel substrate specificity, the order of preference being Tyr >  > Glu > Trp > >> Met > Leu > Asp > . Its relatively weak activity against Asp is due to lack of an arginine residue corresponding to Arg(292)* (where the asterisk indicates that this is a residues supplied by the other subunit of the dimer) in pig cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase. The enzyme recognizes the aromatic substrate by hydrophobic interaction with aromatic rings ((121) and Tyr(59)*) and probably recognizes acidic substrates by a hydrophilic interaction involving a hydrogen bond network with Thr(264)*.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16036434>Biochemical characterization of plasma in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: amino acid and protein composition.</a></h2><p>In this work, we have studied the amino acid and protein composition of the plasma from a group of 32 ALS patients. As controls, groups of 10 healthy subjects (HC) and 32 patients with other neuromuscular disorders have been analysed. When the HC group was compared with the ALS group there were significant decreases of  (39+/-18 to 24+/-9 microM, p<0.01) and Ala (313+/-62 to 237+/-66 microM, p<0.05), and a significant increase of  (89+/-41 to 118+/-24 microM, p<0.05), for the ALS group. When the three groups were compared, we observed significant decreased concentrations of Ser, , Thr, Ala, Arg, Tyr, Met, Cys, Ile, and significant increases of ,  and . An increase of proteolytic products of alpha2-macroglobulin (alpha2-M), an acute-phase serum glycoprotein that functions as a protease inhibitor, has been observed for a subgroup of ALS patients by Western blot. Furthermore, the detection of alpha2-M during disease progression has shown increases of the intact subunit and of a proteolytic product for two of the four patients analysed. Another acute-phase glycoprotein, haptoglobin, which regulates haemoglobin degradation, was not increased for the same group of patients. The results obtained suggested that diet supplementation with  and Ala and modulation of alpha2-M might have some beneficial effects on the course of ALS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10231723>Structure-activity studies at the rat tachykinin NK2 receptor: effect of substitution at position 5 of neurokinin A.</a></h2><p>A series of analogues of neurokinin A(4-10) was synthesized using solid phase techniques with Chiron pins, and purified by HPLC. The potencies of 10 peptides with substitution at Ser5 were assessed at rat fundus NK2 receptors. In membrane binding studies with [125I]-[Lys5,Tyr(I2)7,MeLeu9,Nle10]-NKA(4-10), all compounds except [Asp5]NKA(4-10) showed reasonable affinity, and analogues with  and Arg substitutions were five-fold more potent than NKA(4-10). In functional studies, all peptides were able to contract the rat isolated fundus strips. Analogues with ,  and  substitutions were substantially weaker in functional than in binding studies, whereas there was an excellent correlation (r = 0.95) between binding and functional potency for the remaining seven peptides. [Phe5]NKA(4-10) is in fact neurokinin B(4-10) and this residue may be critical in determining selectivity between NK2 and NK3 receptors. Analogues with a basic residue (, Arg) at position 5 showed both increased affinity and functional potency, whereas the neutral [Asn5]NKA(4-10) was equally as weak in contractile studies as the acidic [Asp5]NKA(4-10). However, [Glu5]NKA(4-10) and [Gln5]NKA(4-10) were no different from NKA(4-10). Our results could indicate the presence of a negative charge on the NK2 receptor, close to position 5 of NKA. This would facilitate interaction with positively charged side chains and impede interaction with negatively charged side chains, particularly the inflexible side chain of aspartic acid. Thus, not only the charge, but also the length of the side chain of the residue at position 5, seems to be important for interaction with the rat NK2 receptor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19393676>Purification, characterization and biological activities of the L-amino acid oxidase from Bungarus fasciatus snake venom.</a></h2><p>L-amino acid oxidases (LAAOs) are widely distributed in snake venoms, which contribute to the toxicity of venoms. However, LAAO from Bungarus fasciatus (B. fasciatus) snake venom has not been isolated previously. In the present study, LAAO from B. fasciatus snake venom was purified by SP-Sepharose HP anion exchange chromatography followed by Heparin-Sepharose FF affinity chromatography procedure and the purified enzyme was named BF-LAAO. BF-LAAO presented an estimated molecular weight of 55kDa in SDS-PAGE and an apparent molecular weight of 70kDa in size-exclusion chromatography suggesting that BF-LAAO is a monomeric protein. Kinetics studies showed that BF-LAAO was very active against L-Tyr, L-Asp, L-, L-Glu, L-Trp, L-, L-Gln, L-Ile, L-Met, L-Leu and moderately active against L-, L-Arg, L-Ala and L-. BF-LAAO exhibited a cytotoxic effect on A549 cells and caused up to 41.2% apoptosis of A549 cells following 12h incubation period. In the mouse peritoneum, BF-LAAO provoked a marked increase in the number of neutrophils, lymphocytes and macrophages following injection. It also induced rabbit platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent manner. At 3h following injection, BF-LAAO elicited severe inflammation in the gastrocnemius muscles of mice, but failed to induce significant organ damage. In conclusion, the cytotoxic and proinflammatory activities of BF-LAAO could be the main cause of the local inflammation, which helps us to understand the pathogenesis of snakebite.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10873472>Effects of side-chain characteristics on stability and oligomerization state of a de novo-designed model coiled-coil: 20 amino acid substitutions in position "d".</a></h2><p>We describe the de novo design and biophysical characterization of a model coiled-coil protein in which we have systematically substituted 20 different amino acid residues in the central "d" position. The model protein consists of two identical 38 residue polypeptide chains covalently linked at their N termini via a disulfide bridge. The hydrophobic core contained Val and Ile residues at positions "a" and Leu residues at positions "d". This core allowed for the formation of both two-stranded and three-stranded coiled-coils in benign buffer, depending on the substitution at position "d". The structure of each analog was analyzed by CD spectroscopy and their relative stability determined by chemical denaturation using GdnHCI (all analogs denatured from the two-stranded state). The oligomeric state(s) was determined by high-performance size-exclusion chromatography and sedimentation equilibrium analysis in benign medium. Our results showed a thermodynamic stability order (in order of decreasing stability) of: Leu, Met, Ile, Tyr, , Val, Gln, Ala, Trp, , , Thr, , Ser, Asp, Glu, Arg, Orn, and Gly. The Pro analog prevented coiled-coil formation. The overall stability range was 7.4 kcal/mol from the lowest to the highest analog, indicating the importance of the hydrophobic core and the dramatic effect a single substitution in the core can have upon the stability of the protein fold. In general, the side-chain contribution to the level of stability correlated with side-chain hydrophobicity. Molecular modelling studies, however, showed that packing effects could explain deviations from a direct correlation. In regards to oligomerization state, eight analogs demonstrated the ability to populate exclusively one oligomerization state in benign buffer (0.1 M KCl, 0.05 M K(2)PO(4)(pH 7)). Ile and Val (the beta-branched residues) induced the three-stranded oligomerization state, whereas Tyr, , Arg, Orn, Glu and Asp induced the two-stranded state. , Gln, Ser, Ala, Gly, , Leu, Met and Trp analogs were indiscriminate and populated two-stranded and three-stranded states. Comparison of these results with similar substitutions in position "a" highlights the positional effects of individual residues in defining the stability and numbers of polypeptide chains occurring in a coiled-coil structure. Overall, these results in conjunction with other work now generate a relative thermodynamic stability scale for 19 naturally occurring amino acid residues in either an "a" or "d" position of a two-stranded coiled-coil. Thus, these results will aid in the de novo design of new coiled-coil structures, a better understanding of their structure/function relationships and the design of algorithms to predict the presence of coiled-coils within native protein sequences.Copyright 2000 Academic Press.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19811930>Electron capture dissociation product ion abundances at the X amino acid in RAAAA-X-AAAAK peptides correlate with amino acid polarity and radical stability.</a></h2><p>We present mechanistic studies aimed at improving the understanding of the product ion formation rules in electron capture dissociation (ECD) of peptides and proteins in Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. In particular, we attempted to quantify the recently reported general correlation of ECD product ion abundance (PIA) with amino acid hydrophobicity. The results obtained on a series of model H-RAAAAXAAAAK-OH peptides confirm a direct correlation of ECD PIA with X amino acid hydrophobicity and polarity. The correlation factor (R) exceeds 0.9 for 12 amino acids (Ile, Val, , , Asp, Glu, Gln, Ser, Thr, Gly, Cys, and Ala). The deviation of ECD PIA for seven outliers (Pro is not taken into consideration) is explained by their specific radical stabilization properties (, Trp, Tyr, Met, and Leu) and amino acid basicity (, Arg). Phosphorylation of Ser, Thr, and Tyr decreases the efficiency of ECD around phosphorylated residues, as expected. The systematic arrangement of amino acids reported here indicates a possible route toward development of a predictive model for quantitative electron capture/transfer dissociation tandem mass spectrometry, with possible applications in proteomics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17029402>Catalytic role for arginine 188 in the C-C hydrolase catalytic mechanism for Escherichia coli MhpC and Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 BphD.</a></h2><p>The alpha/beta-hydrolase superfamily, comprised mainly of esterase and lipase enzymes, contains a family of bacterial C-C hydrolases, including MhpC and BphD which catalyze the hydrolytic C-C cleavage of meta-ring fission intermediates on the Escherichia coli phenylpropionic acid pathway and Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 biphenyl degradation pathway, respectively. Five active site amino acid residues (Arg-188, -109, -173, Cys-261, and Trp-264) were identified from sequence alignments that are conserved in C-C hydrolases, but not in enzymes of different function. Replacement of Arg-188 in MhpC with Gln and  led to 200- and 40-fold decreases, respectively, in k(cat); the same replacements for Arg-190 of BphD led to 400- and 700-fold decreases, respectively, in k(cat). Pre-steady-state kinetic analysis of the R188Q MhpC mutant revealed that the first step of the reaction, keto-enol tautomerization, had become rate-limiting, indicating that Arg-188 has a catalytic role in ketonization of the dienol substrate, which we propose is via substrate destabilization. Mutation of nearby residues -173 and Trp-264 to Gly gave 4-10-fold reductions in k(cat) but 10-20-fold increases in K(m), indicating that these residues are primarily involved in substrate binding. The X-ray structure of a succinate-H263A MhpC complex shows concerted movements in the positions of both -173 and Trp-264 that line the approach to Arg-188. Mutation of -109 to Ala and  yielded 200- and 350-fold reductions, respectively, in k(cat) and pre-steady-state kinetic behavior similar to that of a previous S110A mutant, indicating a role for -109 is positioning the active site loop containing Ser-110. The catalytic role of Arg-188 is rationalized by a hydrogen bond network close to the C-1 carboxylate of the substrate, which positions the substrate and promotes substrate ketonization, probably via destabilization of the bound substrate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3010325>Purification and characterization of peptides with corticotropin-releasing factor activity from porcine hypothalami.</a></h2><p>Ten polypeptides that stimulated the release of corticotropin from superfused rat pituitary cells and that are structurally related to porcine corticotropin-releasing factor were isolated from porcine hypothalami. The purification was carried out by gel filtration followed by reversed-phase HPLC using trifluoroacetic acid or heptafluorobutyric acid as the ion-pairing agent in water/acetonitrile solvent systems. The purified peptides were homogeneous by chromatography and by sequence analysis. One major polypeptide was characterized. Its structure is -H-Ser-Glu-Glu-Pro-Pro-Ile-Ser-Leu-Asp-Leu-Thr---Leu-Leu-Arg-Gl u-Val -Leu-Glu-Met-Ala-Arg-Ala-Glu-Gln-Leu-Ala-Gln-Gln-Ala--Ser--Arg- -Leu-Met-Glu---NH2 [Patthy, M., Horvath, J., Mason-Garcia, M., Szoke, B., Schlesinger, D. H. & Schally, A. V. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82, 8762-8766]. This 41-amino acid sequence is thought to represent porcine corticotropin-releasing factor. Based on automated gas-phase sequencing of the intact and CNBr-cleaved peptides, amino acid analysis, and carboxypeptidase Y digestion, the other nine polypeptides were found to be structurally similar to this 41-amino acid sequence. Modifications of this structure include deamidation of glutamine at position 26 or 29, oxidation of methionine at positions 21 and/or 38, a blocked N terminus, and deletion of phenylalanine amide at the C terminus. Eight of these nine modified peptides retained significant corticotropin-releasing factor activity as shown by the stimulation of corticotropin release from superfused rat and pig pituitary cells. Some of these peptides may be present in pig hypothalami, while the others could have been produced during the isolation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8497481>Refined structure of bovine carbonic anhydrase III at 2.0 A resolution.</a></h2><p>The three-dimensional structure of bovine carbonic anhydrase III (BCA III) from red skeletal muscle cells has been determined by molecular replacement methods. The structure has been refined at 2.0 A resolution by both constrained and restrained structure-factor least squares refinement. The current crystallographic R-value is 19.2% and 121 solvent molecules have so far been found associated with the protein. The structure is highly similar to the refined structure of human carbonic anhydrase II. Some differences in amino acid sequence and structure between the two isoenzymes are discussed. In BCA III,  64 and Arg 91 ( 64 and Ile 91 in HCA II) are both pointing out from the active site cavity forming salt bridges with Glu 4 and Asp 72 ( 4 and Asp 72 in HCA II), respectively. However, Arg 67 and  198 ( 67 and Leu 198 in HCA II) are oriented towards the zinc ion and significantly reduce the volume of the active site cavity.  198 particularly reduces the size of the substrate binding region at the "deep water" position at the bottom of the cavity and we suggest that this is one of the major reasons for the differences in catalytic properties of isoenzyme III as compared to isozyme II.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2002352>Carassin: a tachykinin that is structurally related to neuropeptide-gamma from the brain of the goldfish.</a></h2><p>A 21-amino-acid residue tachykinin-related peptide, carassin, was isolated in pure form from an extract of the brain of the goldfish, Carrassius auratus, by reversed-phase HPLC.

In this study, eight drug-resistant genes, beta-lactamase, metallo-beta-lactamase, vanB, mecA, norA, qacA, qacB and qacC of S. aureus strain Mu50 (vancomycin resistant) were studied to predict the evolutionary conserved functional site residues in their protein sequences. It was found that in beta-lactamase, Tyr, Gly, Thr,  and in metallo-beta-lactamase, Thr, , Gly, Leu, Arg and Asp residues were highly conserved. In vanB, Gly,  and Asp residues were highly conserved. Whereas in mecA, , Val, , Gln,  and in norA, Ser, Leu and Ala residues showed conservedness at moderate level. In the multi-drug efflux pump (corresponding to qacA, qacB and qacC), Gly residue was found to be highly conserved. The homology clustering of target proteins through SCI-PHY algorithm and homologues identified through PSI-BLAST were compared to identify the degree of conservation of functional residues. The phylogenetic motifs identified using homologues of target proteins were validated through domain search to locate their site and functionality in the protein sequences.

NEM produced time- and concentration-dependent inactivation of DD3 in a pseudo-first-order reaction manner. This inactivation was prevented by NADP+, 3-acetylpyridine-adenine dinucleotide phosphate, 2',5'-ADP and 2'-AMP but not by substrates, NAD+, nicotinamide mononucleotide or 5'-ADP.DD3 was absorbed by an affinity column of thiopropyl-Sepharose 6B, but enzyme incubated with both NEM and NADP+ was not. Moreover, one [14C]NEM molecule was incorporated into a cysteine of DD3 in the presence, and two cysteines of DD3 in the absence, of NADP+. These results suggested that two cysteine residues were modified per enzyme molecule by NEM, one was protected by NADP+ and the other had no significant function for the enzyme activity. Two radiolabelled peptides (P1 and P2) produced by the digestion with lysyl endopeptidase of [14C]NEM-modified DD3 could be separated by reverse-phase HPLC. P1, which was radiolabelled by [14C]NEM only in the absence of NADP+, showed the following sequence; H2N-Tyr--Pro-Val-Xaa--Gln-Val-Glu- NEM.Cys--Pro-Tyr---Gln-Ser--COOH (Xaa indicates a possible cysteine residue). This sequence was very similar to that of rat liver 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid/dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (3 alpha-HSD/DD) (residues 184 to 201) and was also highly conserved in the aldo-keto reductase superfamily. The sequence of P2, which had radioactivity in both the absence and presence of NADP+, also contained an NEM-modified cysteine and was similar in sequence to the regions located in loop A of rat 3 alpha-HSD/DD. The present study suggests that P1, which may have a cysteine residue corresponding to Cys-193 of rat 3 alpha-HSD/DD, functions in the alteration of DD3 activity depending on the modulation of NADP(+)-binding ability through a thiol/disulphide exchange reaction similar to that of rat 3 alpha-HSD/DD shown in our previous results; while P2, which may have a cysteine residue corresponding to Cys-145 of rat 3 alpha-HSD/DD, may be located near the surface of the enzyme molecule.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3759971>S-adenosylhomocysteinase from rat liver.

Treatment of the FSBA-inactivated enzyme with iodoacetate in the absence of reducing agent and then with [14C] iodoacetate after reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol yielded the enzyme containing approximately 2 mol of radiolabeled S-carboxymethylcysteine/mol of subunit. Analysis of tryptic peptides showed that the radioactivity was associated with 2 carboxymethylcysteine-containing peptides whose amino acid sequences were: Trp-Ser-Ser-Cys(Cm)--Ile--Ser-Thr-Gln-Asp--Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ile- Ala- and Gly-Glu-Thr-Asp-Glu-Glu-Tyr-Leu-Trp-Cys(Cm)-Ile-Glu-Gln-Thr-Leu--- , respectively.

We have approached this question by using 2',3'-O-(trinitrophenyl)-8-azidoadenosine 5'-diphosphate (TNP-8N(3)-ADP) to photoinactivate and label Na,K-ATPase, both in its native state and after covalent FITC block of its high-affinity ATP site. With the native enzyme, the photoinactivation rate constant increases hyperbolically with a K(D(TNP-8N)3(-)(ADP)) of 0.11 microM; TNP-ATP and ATP protect the site with high affinities. The inactivation does not require Na(+), but K(+) inhibits with a K(K)' of 12 microM; Na(+) reverses this effect, with a K(Na) of 0.17 mM. This pattern suggests that Na(+) and K(+) are binding at sites in their "intracellular" conformation. It was known that FITC did not abolish the reverse phosphorylation by P(i), or the K(+)-phosphatase activity, and that TNP-8N(3)-ADP could subsequently photoinactivate the latter with >100-fold lower affinity; in that case, the cation sites acted as if facing outward [Ward, D. G., and Cavieres, J. D. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 14277-14284, 33759-33765]. Native and FITC-modified enzymes have now been photolabeled with TNP-8N(3)-[alpha-(32)P]ADP and alpha-chain soluble tryptic peptides separated by reverse-phase HPLC. With native Na,K-ATPase, three labeled peaks lead to the unique sequence alpha-(470)Ile-Val-Glu-Ile-Pro---Ser-Thr--X-Tyr-Gln-Leu-Ser-Ile--(487), the dropped residue being alphaLys480. With the FITC enzyme, instead, two independent labeling and purification cycles return the sequence alpha-(721)Ala-Asp-Ile-Gly-Val-Ala-Met-Gly-Ile-Ala-Gly-Ser-Asp-Val-Ser-(736). These results suggest that Na,K-ATPase also has a low-affinity nucleotide binding region, one that is under distinctive allosteric control by Na(+) and K(+). Moreover, the cation effects seem compatible with a slow, passive Na(+)/K(+) carrier behavior of the FITC-modified sodium pump.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2284199>Urotensin I and its N-terminal flanking peptide from the flounder, Platichthys flesus.</a></h2><p>The caudal spinal cord region of teleost fish terminates in a neurosecretory organ, the urophysis. Two peptides have been purified to homogeneity from an extract of the urophysis of a teleost fish, the flounder. The primary structure of one peptide, Ser-Glu-Asp-Pro-Pro-Met-Ser-Ile-Asp-Leu10-Thr---Met-Leu-Arg- -Met-Ile- His20-Met-Ala--Met-Glu-Gly-Glu-Arg-Glu-Gln30-Ala-Gln-Ile- -Arg--Leu-Leu - Asp-Glu40-Val, indicates identity with urotensin I. By analogy with other urotensins, the COOH-terminal residue is probably alpha-amidated. A second peptide was present in the extract in a concentration that was approximately equimolar with that of urotensin I. The amino acid composition of this peptide indicated a total of approximately 65 residues. The amino acid sequence of a fragment produced by digestion with trypsin was established as: Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala-Gly5-Asp-Ser-Ala-Ala-Ser10-Asp-Leu-Leu-Gly-Asp1 5--Ile-Leu- Arg. This sequence shows partial homology to carp prepro-urotensin I(41-59)-peptide as deduced from the nucleotide sequence of a cloned cDNA. It is concluded that the second peptide probably represents the N-terminal flanking peptide of pro-urotensin I which, it has previously been suggested, may function as a urotensin-binding peptide (urophysin) analogous to the neurophysins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17123703>Comparison of codon usage and tRNAs in mitochondrial genomes of Candida species.</a></h2><p>To gain insight into the nature of the mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA) of different Candida species, the synonymous codon usage bias of mitochondrial protein coding genes and the tRNAs in C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. stellata, C. glabrata and the closely related yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae were analyzed. Common features of the mtDNA in Candida species are a strong A+T pressure on protein coding genes, and insufficient mitochondrial tRNA species are encoded to perform protein synthesis. The wobble site of the anticodon is always U for the NNR (NNA and NNG) codon families, which are dominated by A-ending codons, and always G for the NNY (NNC and NNU) codon families, which is dominated by U-ending codons, and always U for the NNN (NNA, NNU, NNC and NNG) codon families, which are dominated by A-ending codons and U-ending codons. Patterns of synonymous codon usage of Candida species can be classified into three groups: (1) optimal codon-anticodon usage, Glu, , Leu (translated by anti-codon UAA), Gln, Arg (translated by anti-codon UCU) and Trp are containing NNR codons. NNA, whose corresponding tRNA is encoded in the mtDNA, is used preferentially. (2) Non-optimal codon-anticodon usage, Cys, Asp, , , , Ser (translated by anti-codon GCU) and Tyr are containing NNY codons. The NNU codon, whose corresponding tRNA is not encoded in the mtDNA, is used preferentially. (3) Combined codon-anticodon usage, Ala, Gly, Leu (translated by anti-codon UAG), Pro, Ser (translated by anti-codon UGA), Thr and Val are containing NNN codons. NNA (tRNA encoded in the mtDNA) and NNU (tRNA not encoded in the mtDNA) are used preferentially. In conclusion, we propose that in Candida species, codons containing A or U at third position are used preferentially, regardless of whether corresponding tRNAs are encoded in the mtDNA. These results might be useful in understanding the common features of the mtDNA in Candida species and patterns of synonymous codon usage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27696676>Severity of experimental traumatic brain injury modulates changes in concentrations of cerebral free amino acids.</a></h2><p>In this study, concentrations of free amino acids (FAA) and amino group containing compounds (AGCC) following graded diffuse traumatic brain injury (mild TBI, mTBI; severe TBI, sTBI) were evaluated. After 6, 12, 24, 48 and 120 hr aspartate (Asp), glutamate (Glu), asparagine (), serine (Ser), glutamine (Gln), histidine (), glycine (Gly), threonine (Thr), citrulline (Cit), arginine (Arg), alanine (Ala), taurine (Tau), γ-aminobutyrate (GABA), tyrosine (Tyr), S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), l-cystathionine (l-Cystat), valine (Val), methionine (Met), tryptophane (Trp), phenylalanine (), isoleucine (Ile), leucine (Leu), ornithine (Orn), lysine (), plus N-acetylaspartate (NAA) were determined in whole brain extracts (n = 6 rats at each time for both TBI levels). Sham-operated animals (n = 6) were used as controls. Results demonstrated that mTBI caused modest, transient changes in NAA, Asp, GABA, Gly, Arg. Following sTBI, animals showed profound, long-lasting modifications of Glu, Gln, NAA, Asp, GABA, Ser, Gly, Ala, Arg, Citr, Tau, Met, SAH, l-Cystat, Tyr and . Increase in Glu and Gln, depletion of NAA and Asp increase, suggested a link between NAA hydrolysis and excitotoxicity after sTBI. Additionally, sTBI rats showed net imbalances of the Glu-Gln/GABA cycle between neurons and astrocytes, and of the methyl-cycle (demonstrated by decrease in Met, and increase in SAH and l-Cystat), throughout the post-injury period. Besides evidencing new potential targets for novel pharmacological treatments, these results suggest that the force acting on the brain tissue at the time of the impact is the main determinant of the reactions ignited and involving amino acid .© 2016 The Authors.

The primary structure of insulin from a holostean fish, the bowfin (Amia calva), was established as: A-chain: Gly-Ile-Val-Glu-Gln-Cys-Cys-Leu--Pro-Cys-Thr-Ile-Tyr-Glu-Met-Glu- -Tyr-Cys- B-chain: Ala-Ala-Ser-Gln--Leu-Cys-Gly-Ser--Leu-Val-Glu-Ala-Leu--Leu- Val-Cys-Gly-Glu-Ser-Gly---Tyr--Pro---Ser This amino acid sequence contains several substitutions (methionine at A16, phenylalanine at B16 and serine at B22) at sites that have been strongly conserved in other vertebrate species and that may be expected to influence biological activity. Consistent with this prediction, bowfin insulin was approx. 14-fold less potent than pig insulin in inhibiting the binding of [125I-Tyr-A14](human insulin) to transfected mouse NIH 3T3 cells expressing the human insulin receptor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30418772> Alternations of Amino Acids, γ-Aminobutyric Acid, and Salicylic Acid in Solanum lycopersicum (L.)

Free amino acid pools increased; bound amino acid pools reduced. In vegetative tissues, amino acid biosyntheses linked to osmo-compatibility (Pro, Leu, Val and GABA); N (Arg, , Asp, Gln, and Glu); C (Pro, Ser, and Tyr); S (Cys) assimilation; stress tolerance (Ala, Gly, Hyp, , , Met, and Thr); and central  (, Trp, and Tyr) enhanced for 60-120 days. Concentrations of Ala, Arg, Gln, Gly, Leu, and Ser in leaf and of Asp, Cys, Glu, , Hyp, , Met, Pro, and Val in root predominated. In planta SA and GABA biosynthesis increased concurrently. SA affected GABA biosynthesis via Glu, Pro, and Arg . SA, GABA, Glu, and Pro were key canonical variables.

A panel of overlapping synthetic peptides revealed two T cell epitopes, one encompassed by residues 121-136 and the other by 129-145. Residues 129 (glutamic acid) and 130 (isoleucine) were implicated in a pathogenic B cell epitope. Peptide 129-145 (Glu-Ile-Ile-Val-Thr---Pro--Asp-Glu-Gln--Cys-Ser-Met-, a conserved sequence in rat and human AChR) induced autoantibody production in 76% of rats. All seropositive rats had evidence of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis; five of five tested had electrophysiologic signs, and all had loss of immunochemically measured autologous muscle AChR. Analogues of 129-145, with single residues substituted by alanine, revealed phenylalanine 135, phenylalanine 137, and glutamic acid 139 as most important determinants of Ag/MHC-II/TCR interactions; phenylalanine 137 is critical for T cell activation. B cells were the major MHC-II-positive cell type to which the self-peptide 129-145 bound in a population of nonimmune splenic cells. More efficient processing and presentation of the Th cell epitope by an expanded population of immune B cells selected by specifically binding another epitope of the same peptide would greatly amplify the production of autoantibodies. Peptide autoantigens of this type could plausibly perpetuate the autoantibody response in myasthenia gravis, and are a rational target for strategies aimed at Ag-specific therapeutic intervention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19657833>Description of two new alpha variants: Hb Canuts [alpha85(F6)Asp--> (alpha1)] and Hb Ambroise Pare [alpha117(GH5)-->Ile (alpha2)]; two new beta variants: Hb Beaujolais [beta84(EF8)Thr-->] and Hb Monplaisir [beta147 (Tyr--Leu-Ala---Leu-Leu-Ser---Tyr-158-COOH)] and one new delta variant: Hb (A2)North Africa [delta59(E3)-->Met].</a></h2><p>We present here five new hemoglobin (Hb) variants which have been identified during routine Hb analysis before their genotypic characterization. Four of these result from a classical missense mutation: Hb Canuts [alpha85(F6)Asp--> (alpha1)], Hb Ambroise Pare [alpha117(GH5)-->Ile (alpha2)], Hb Beaujolais [beta84(EF8)Thr-->] and HbA(2)-North Africa [delta59(E3)-->Met]. The last one, Hb Monplaisir [beta147 (Tyr--Leu-Ala---Leu-Leu-Ser---Tyr-158-COOH)], results from a frameshift mutation at the stop codon of the beta-globin gene which leads to a modified C-terminal sequence in the beta-globin chain. None of these variants seem to have a particular clinical expression in the heterozygous state. The circumstances of the discovery of these five new Hb variants emphasize the fact that an association of techniques is necessary for a complete screening of Hb variants during routine Hb analysis. Globin chain separation by reversed phase liquid chromatography (RP-LC) appears to be the most relevant method.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20969427>Sequence composition and environment effects on residue fluctuations in protein structures.</a></h2><p>Structure fluctuations in proteins affect a broad range of cell phenomena, including stability of proteins and their fragments, allosteric transitions, and energy transfer. This study presents a statistical-thermodynamic analysis of relationship between the sequence composition and the distribution of residue fluctuations in protein-protein complexes. A one-node-per-residue elastic network model accounting for the nonhomogeneous protein mass distribution and the interatomic interactions through the renormalized inter-residue potential is developed. Two factors, a protein mass distribution and a residue environment, were found to determine the scale of residue fluctuations. Surface residues undergo larger fluctuations than core residues in agreement with experimental observations. Ranking residues over the normalized scale of fluctuations yields a distinct classification of amino acids into three groups: (i) highly fluctuating-Gly, Ala, Ser, Pro, and Asp, (ii) moderately fluctuating-Thr, , Gln, , Glu, Arg, Val, and Cys, and (iii) weakly fluctuating-Ile, Leu, Met, , Tyr, Trp, and . The structural instability in proteins possibly relates to the high content of the highly fluctuating residues and a deficiency of the weakly fluctuating residues in irregular secondary structure elements (loops), chameleon sequences, and disordered proteins. Strong correlation between residue fluctuations and the sequence composition of protein loops supports this hypothesis. Comparing fluctuations of binding site residues (interface residues) with other surface residues shows that, on average, the interface is more rigid than the rest of the protein surface and Gly, Ala, Ser, Cys, Leu, and Trp have a propensity to form more stable docking patches on the interface. The findings have broad implications for understanding mechanisms of protein association and stability of protein structures.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23374643>Effects of systemic progesterone during the early luteal phase on the availabilities of amino acids and glucose in the bovine uterine lumen.</a></h2><p>The uterine histotroph provides essential nutrition to the developing conceptus during the preimplantation period of pregnancy. The objective of the present study was to examine the effects of cycle stage and progesterone (P4) concentrations in the blood on the recoverable quantities of amino acids and glucose in the histotroph during the preimplantaion period of conceptus development. Following oestrus, dairy heifers were assigned to low, control or high P4 groups (n=6 heifers per treatment and time point). The uterine horn ipsilateral to the corpus luteum was flushed on either Day 7 or Day 13. The present study quantified 24 amino acids and glucose in the uterine flushings using HPLC and fluorometry, respectively. Heifers in the low P4 group had lower plasma concentrations of P4 throughout the cycle, whereas heifers in the high group had higher plasma concentrations of P4 between Days 3 and 7 compared with the control group (P<0.05). Total recoverable neutral (Ser, Gln, Gly, Thr, Cit, β-Ala, Tau, Ala, Tyr, Trp, Met, Val, , Ile, Leu, Pro and Cys), acidic (Glu) and basic (, Arg, Orn and ) amino acids were greater (P<0.05) on Day 13 than on Day 7. There was no significant difference in the amount of Asp or  between Day 7 and Day 13. The amount of amino acids recovered on Day 7 was similar across treatment groups. On Day 13, the amount of ,  and Thr was lower (P<0.05) in the low P4 heifers compared with the controls and/or high P4 heifers. Quantities of glucose were not altered by cycle stage or P4 treatment. In conclusion, the stage of oestrous cycle and P4 play important roles in modulating amino acids in the histotroph, a potentially critical factor for early embryonic and/or conceptus survival.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23502767>Identification of synthetic peptides that inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding to myeloid differentiation protein-2 (MD-2).</a></h2><p>Many studies have suggested that the synergic effect of myeloid differential protein-2 (MD-2) on bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) may be a critical step during the LPS-TLR4 response signaling pathway. We performed a bioinformatic analysis on the MD-2 protein and identified the amino acid sequence NH2-FSKGKYKCV-COOH (K128-132) as a possible key sequence involved in the binding between MD-2 and LPS. We then screened a random phage display peptide library using this sequence as bait in order to identify antagonistic peptides. After 3 rounds of selection, 3 positive clones were identified. All 3 peptides were shown to inhibit, in a dose-dependent manner the production of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 in human U937 and THP-1 cell lines as well as human peripheral blood monocytes stimulated by LPS. Only 2 of the 3 peptides were able to bind MD-2 directly as shown by sulfo-SBED biotin label transfer experiments. BALB/C mice were used to estimate the protection of these peptides from LPS challenge, and 2 of the 3 peptides (-Thr-Val-Pro-Asp-- and Ile-Gly---Leu-Tyr-Arg) reduced mortality of the challenged mice from 100% to 53.8%. This study has demonstrated that interfering with the binding between MD-2 and LPS might be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating LPS-induced sepsis, and in doing so has identified 2 potential peptide candidates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19375530>Searching for specific motifs in affinity capture in proteome analysis.</a></h2><p>In analysing the red blood cell cytoplasmic proteome, in search for low abundance proteins, 15 amino acid (AA; Arg, , Asp, Gln, Gly, , Ile, , , Pro, Ser, Thr, Trp, Tyr, and Val) probes, used individually, captured a total of 787 unique gene products. Of those, 76 were found to be the common catch of all AA probes, 497 were captured by more than one (but not all) probe, and 214 were captured by only one probe. By using the InterPro database, for 151 of the 214 IPIs associated with proteins captured by a single amino acid, we have found 265 annotations of motifs (231 protein domains, 3 binding sites, 3 active sites, 13 conserved sites, and 15 repeats). Among these 151 proteins annotated, there are 75 domains, 2 active sites, 5 conserved sites, and 3 repeats (a total of 85 motifs) that are at all effects amino acid strictly specific. As a result of these findings, these 85 amino acid specific motifs singled out 40 (18.69%) of the total list of 214 proteins representing the total capture of the 15 AAs here reported. If one considers that only for 151 (70.56%) of the 214 proteins data about interacting motifs could be collected, the percentage of proteins for which the 85 amino acid strictly specific motifs have been found increases to the even more relevant value of 26.49%. The identified motifs can partially explain the exclusive protein capture of the 15 amino acid probes. The unique general and specific capturing ability of two of these AA probes,  and Arg, is evaluated, discussed and put in perspective.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1985896>Amino acid sequence of an anti-tumor protein from Rana pipiens oocytes and early embryos.

We analyze potential auto-inhibitory associations by employing charge reversal and hydrophobic-to-charged residue mutagenesis. We identify interacting amino acid pairs by using double mutants to test which modification in the catalytic domain complements a given change in the auto-inhibitory domain. Our studies identify the core pseudosubstrate sequence (residues 297-300) but reveal that distinct sequences centered about the autophosphorylation site at Thr-286 are involved in the critical auto-inhibitory interactions. Individual changes in any of the residues Arg-274, -282, Arg-283, -291, Arg-297, -293, and -294 in the auto-inhibitory domain or their interacting partners in the catalytic domain produces an enhanced affinity for calmodulin or generates a constitutively active enzyme. A structural model of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II that incorporates these interactions shows that Thr-286 is oriented inwardly into a hydrophobic channel. The model explains why calmodulin must bind to the auto-inhibitory domain in order for Thr-286 in that domain to be phosphorylated and why introduction of phospho-Thr-286 produces the important Ca(2+)-independent state of the enzyme.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3436516>Gastrin-releasing peptide from the intestine of the elasmobranch fish, Scyliorhinus canicula (common dogfish).</a></h2><p>The concentration of gastrin-releasing peptide in the intestine of the elasmobranchian fish, Scyliorhinus canicula, measured with an antiserum directed against the COOH-terminal region of porcine gastrin-releasing peptide, was higher than the concentrations measured in mammalian intestines.

Responses were detected in stellate cells and occasionally in principal cells, although at no concentration tested did [Ca(2+)] in the principal cell increase significantly above background. In stellate cells, DLK produced a biphasic rise in intracellular [Ca(2+)] from resting levels of 80-100 nmol l(-)(1), with a transient peak being followed by a slower rise that peaked at 200-300 nmol l(-)(1) after 3 s, then decayed over approximately 10 s.

As such, the Ab surface holds information about Ag folding that resides with the Ab-Ag interface residues and how they interact.

We assessed the physical and biochemical features of the Ag-Ab interfaces and the degree to which favored interactions exist between amino acid residues on the corresponding interface surfaces. Amino acid compositional analysis of the interfaces confirmed the dominance of TYR in the Ab paratope-containing surface (PCS), with almost two fold greater abundance than any other residue. Additionally TYR had a much higher than expected presence in the PCS compared to the surface of the whole antibody (defined as the occurrence propensity), along with aromatics , TRP, and to a lesser degree  and ILE.

Insulin has been isolated from an extract of the pancreas and upper gastrointestinal tract of the bichir Polypterus senegalis and its primary structure established as A-chain: Gly-Ile-Val-Glu-Gln-Cys-Cys-Asp-Thr-Pro10-Cys-Ser- Leu-Tyr-Asp-Leu-Glu--Tyr-Cys20-: B-chain: Ala-Ala--Arg--Leu-Cys-Gly-Ser-His10-Leu-Val- Glu-Ala-Leu-Tyr-Leu-Val-Cys-Gly20--Arg-Gly-- -Tyr-Ile-Pro-Ser-Lys30-Met. Despite the fact that Polypterus insulin contains several unusual structural features that are not found in insulins from other jawed fish (Asp at A-8, Thr at A-9, Arg at B-4,  at B-21, Ile at B-27, Met at B-31), all the residues in human insulin that are involved in receptor binding, dimerization, and hexamerization have been conserved. A comparison of the structures of insulins from a range of species indicates that Polypterus insulin most closely resembles paddlefish insulin II (seven amino acid substitutions). In contrast, Polypterus glucagon (-Ser- Gln-Gly-Thr--Thr--Asp-Tyr10-Thr--Tyr- Gln-Asp-Ser-Arg-Arg-Ala-Gln20-Asp--Val-Gln- Trp-Leu-Met-Ser-) most closely resembles the glucagons from the gar Lepisosteus spatula and the bowfin Amia calva (four amino acid substitutions).

Blood samples were collected before the morning feeding on d 0, 6, and 12 (prefeeding), and 2 h after the morning feeding on d 13 (postfeeding). Pigs were euthanized on d 13, and liver and right LM were removed and weighed. The reduction in the dietary CP concentration linearly decreased (P < 0.01) ADG, G:F, LM weight, and the CP content of LM. Reducing the CP concentration decreased pre- and postfeeding plasma concentrations of IGF-I (linear, P < 0.01) and insulin (linear, P < 0.10). The reduction in the dietary CP concentration increased prefeeding plasma concentrations of Ala, Gln, Gly, and total AA but decreased Arg, , , Ile, , Trp, and Tyr (linear, P < 0.05). Plasma concentration of total indispensable AA decreased initially and increased thereafter as the dietary CP concentration decreased from 16.1 to 7.8% (quadratic, P < 0.01). The reduction in the dietary CP concentration increased postfeeding plasma concentrations of Ala, , Met (linear, P < 0.01), and Gly (linear, P = 0.073) and decreased , Ser, Tyr, Arg, , and Leu (linear, P < 0.05). Plasma concentrations of Ile, , Thr, Trp, and Val decreased initially and increased thereafter as the dietary CP concentration decreased from 16.1 to 7.8% (quadratic, P < 0.05). In muscle tissue, concentrations of free Ala, Asp, Glu, Gln, Gly, and  increased (linear, P < 0.05) as the dietary CP concentration decreased. Concentrations of free , Ile, , Thr, Trp, and Val in muscle tissue decreased initially and increased thereafter as the dietary CP concentration decreased from 16.1 to 7.8% (quadratic, P < 0.05). In summary, the reduction in the dietary protein-bound AA decreased whole-body and LM growth, altered the free AA pool profile in muscle tissue, and decreased plasma insulin and IGF-I. As the replacement of protein-bound AA with CAA increased, 1) free Ala and Gln in muscle tissue increased, indicating an increase of muscle tissue protein breakdown; and 2) utilization of indispensable AA in muscle tissue decreased.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16013499>[Characteristics of a new fibrinolytic enzyme produced from Rhizopus chinensis 12#].</a></h2><p>As a therapeutic agent in thrombosis the fibrinolytic enzymes are of interest and the search for a new enzyme continues. A novel fibrinolytic enzyme was produced from Rhizopus chinensis 120, which was screened from the starter for brewing rice wine in the South of China, by solid fermentation, and purified through ammonium sulfate precipitation, hydrophobic interaction, ionic exchange and gel filtration chromatographies. The purified enzyme hydrolyzed fibrin, it cleaved the alpha-, beta- and gamma-chains of fibrinogen simultaneously, and it also activated plasminogen to plasmin. The enzyme hydrolyzed N-Succinyl-Ala-Ala- Pro--pNA, and Km was 0.23 mmol/L and Kcat 16.36 s(-1). The optimal temperature of the enzyme for hydrolying fibrin was 45 degrees C, and the optimal pH range of 6.8 - 8.8. The isoelectric point of the enzyme estimated by isoelectric focusing electrophoresis was 8.5 +/- 0.1. The enzyme was a glycoprotein. EDTA, PCMB, PMSF inhibited the activety of the enzyme, and SBTI, , TPCK, Aprotinine had none obvious inhibition, which suggested that the activity centre of the enzyme had hydrosulfuryl, metal and serine. The first 12 amino acids of the N-termimal sequence of the enzyme were NH2-Ser-Val-Ser-Glu-Ile-Gln-Leu-Met---Leu-Gly, and had none homology with that of other fibrinolytic enzyme from other microbes. The novel fibrinolytic enzyme from Rhizopus chinensis 12# has potential to become a therapeutic agent in thrombosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16926512>Effects of orally administrated amino acids on myofibrillar proteolysis in chicks.</a></h2><p>We examined the effects of orally administrated amino acids on myfibrillar proteolysis in food-deprived chicks.

Manganese exposure is considered to be an environmental risk factor connected to PD and PD-like syndrome. Research into the genetic and environmental risk factors involved in disease susceptibility has recently uncovered a link existing between Park9 and manganese. It seems that manganese binding to Park9 (YPk9) protein is involved in the detoxification mechanism exerted by this protein against manganese toxicity. In this study, we used potentiometric, mono- and bi-dimensional (TOCSY, HSQC) NMR, EPR and ESI-MS measurements to analyze complex formation and metal binding sites in the peptide fragment. Presumably octahedral species, in which the Mn(II) ion was bound to oxygens of the carboxyl groups of Glu and Asp, and species where the involvement of sulfur from Cys and nitrogen from  residues, depending on the metal to ligand molar ratio, were detected for manganese coordination. Structural changes in the 30-amino acid fragment were triggered by Zn(II) interaction. A general decrease in the intensity of NMR signals was detected, suggesting the occurrence of chemical exchange among some coordinated species in an intermediate NMR timescale. The coordination may involve both S and N donor atoms from cysteine as well as histidine residues, together with O donor atoms from glutamic and aspartic residues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9204362>Purification and structural characterization of insulin from the lesser siren, Siren intermedia (Amphibia: Caudata).</a></h2><p>Insulin has been isolated from an extract of the pancreas of a salamander, the lesser siren Siren intermedia, and its primary structure was established as: A-chain, Gly-Ile-Val- Glu-Gln-Cys-Cys---Thr10-Cys-Ser-Leu-Tyr-Gln-Leu-Glu--Tyr- Cys20-, and B-chain, Val-Pro---Pro- Leu-Cys-Gly-Ala-His10-Leu-Val-Glu-Val-Met-Tyr--Val- Cys-Gly20-Asp-Arg-Gly---Tyr-Pro-Ser-Ser-Thr 30. Although those amino acid residues considered to constitute the receptor-binding region of insulin have been retained, siren insulin contains several substitutions (Gln--> at B4, Ser-->Ala at B9, Ala-->Val at B14, Leu-->Met at B15, Leu--> at B17, Pro-->Ser at B28, and -->Ser at B29) of amino acid residues that are conserved in insulins from species of other amphibian orders. The biological activity of siren insulin was not investigated in this study but the substitutions at B28 (involved in dimer formation) and at B14 and B17 (involved in hexamer formation) may be expected to influence conformation and therefore biological potency. The data are consistent with the view that the Sirenoidea represent an early divergence from the ancestral stock of salamanders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21555255>High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of naturally occurring D-amino acids in sake.</a></h2><p>We measured all of the D- and L-amino acids in 141 bottles of sakes using HPLC. We used two precolumn derivatization methods of amino acid enantiomer detection with o-phthalaldehyde and N-acetyl-L-cysteine, as well as (+)-1-(9-fluorenyl)ethyl chloroformate/1-aminoadamantane and one postcolumn derivatization method with o-phthalaldehyde and N-acetyl-L-cysteine. We found that the sakes contained the D-amino acids forms of Ala, , Asp, Arg, Glu, Gln, , Ile, Leu, , Ser, Tyr, Val, , and Pro. We were not able to detect D-Met, D-Thr D-Trp in any of the sakes analyzed. The most abundant D-Ala, D-Asp, and D-Glu ranged from 66.9 to 524.3 μM corresponding to relative 34.4, 12.0, and 14.6% D-enantiomer. The basic parameters that generally determine the taste of sake such as the sake meter value (SMV; "Nihonshudo"), acidity ("Sando"), amino acid value ("Aminosando"), alcohol content by volume, and rice species of raw material show no significant relationship to the D-amino acid content of sake. The brewing water ("Shikomimizu") and brewing process had effects on the D-amino acid content of the sakes: the D-amino acid contents of the sakes brewed with deep-sea water "Kaiyoushinosousui", "Kimoto yeast starter", "Yamahaimoto", and the long aging process "Choukijukusei" are high compared with those of other sakes analyzed. Additionally, the D-amino acid content of sakes that were brewed with the adenine auxotroph of sake yeast ("Sekishoku seishu kobo", Saccharomyces cerevisiae) without pasteurization ("Hiire") increased after storage at 25 °C for three months.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

These measurements were taken to gain information on conformational change produced by single amino acid substitutions. The CD spectra of the mutant proteins, substituted by Tyr or Trp residue in place of Glu residue at position 49, showed more intense positive bands due to one additional Tyr or Trp residue at position 49. The CD spectra of other mutant proteins also differed from that of the wild-type protein, despite the fact that the substituted residues at position 49 were not aromatic. Using the spectrum of the wild-type protein (Glu49) as a standard, the spectra of the other mutants were classified into three major groups. For 10 mutant proteins substituted by Ile, Ala, Leu, Met, Val, Cys, Pro, Ser, , or Gly, their CD values of bands (due to Tyr residues) decreased in comparison with those of the wild-type protein. The mutant protein substituted by  also belonged to this group. These substituted amino acid residues are more hydrophobic than the original residue, Glu. In the second group, three mutant proteins were substituted by , Gln, or , and the CD values of tyrosyl bands increased compared to those of the wild-type proteins. These residues are polar. In the third group, the CD values of tyrosyl bands of two mutant proteins substituted by Asp or Thr were similar to those of the wild-type protein, except for one band at 276.5 nm. These results suggested that the changes in the CD spectra for the mutant proteins were affected by the hydrophobicity of the residues at position 49.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9114452>Aib-containing analogues of the insect kinin neuropeptide family demonstrate resistance to an insect angiotensin-converting enzyme and potent diuretic activity.</a></h2><p>Analogues of the insect kinin family in which the Xaa2 residue of the C-terminal pentapeptide core sequence -Xaa1-Xaa2-Trp-Gly-NH2 (Xaa1 = , , , Ser, or Tyr; Xaa2 = Ala, Ser, or Pro) is replaced with sterically hindered aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) prove to be resistant to hydrolysis by housefly (Musca domestica) angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), an endopeptidase capable of hydrolysis and inactivation of the naturally occurring insect kinin peptides. The Aib residue is compatible with formation of turn in the active core region that is important for the biological activity of the insect kinins. One of the Aib-containing analogues, pGlu----Aib-Trp-Gly-NH2, is five- and eightfold more active than the most active endogenous insect kinins in cockroach (Leucophaea maderae) hindgut myotropic and cricket (Acheta domesticus) Malpighian tubule fluid secretion assays, respectively. As the analogue is blocked at both the amino- and the carboxyl-terminus and resistant to an endopeptidase present in insects, it is better adapted than the endogenous peptides to survive for long periods in the hemolymph. Enzyme-resistant insect kinin analogues can provide useful tools to insect researchers studying the neuroendocrine control of water and ion balance and the physiological consequences of challenging insect with diuretic factors that demonstrate enhanced resistance to peptidase attack. If these analogues, whether in isolation or in combination with other factors, can disrupt the water and/or ion balance they hold potential utility for the control of pest insect populations in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9650713>Isolation and characterization of insulin in Russian sturgeon (Acipenser guldenstaedti).</a></h2><p>Insulin was isolated from the pancreas of Chondrostean fish, the Russian sturgeon, Acipenser guldenstaedti, by acid-ethanol extraction followed by ion-exchange and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatographies. The amino acid sequence determined by automated Edman degradation is as follows: A-chain (21-amino-acid peptide), H-Gly-Ile-Val-Glu-Gln-Cys-Cys--Ser-Pro-Cys-Ser-Leu-Tyr-Asp-Leu-Glu-As n-Tyr-Cys--OH; and B-chain (31-amino-acid peptide), H-Ala-Ala--Gln--Leu-Cys-Gly-Ser--Leu-Val-Glu-Ala-Leu-Tyr-Leu-Va l-Cys-Gly-Glu-Arg-Gly---Tyr-Thr-Pro---Val-OH.

Yet, they differ by only 7 amino acids at positions 15, 67, 68, 84, 241, 254, and 429 within their respective 484 residues. To determine the structural basis and the amino acid(s) involved in these physicochemical differences, we constructed three GCAP mutants by site-directed mutagenesis and six GCAP/PLAP chimeras and then expressed these alkaline phosphatase mutants in COS-1 cells. We report that the differential reactivity of PLAP and GCAP depends critically on a single amino acid at position 429. GCAP with Gly-429 is strongly inhibited by L-leucine, EDTA, and heat, whereas PLAP with Glu-429 is resistant. By substituting Gly-429 of GCAP with a series of amino acids, we demonstrate that the relative sensitivities of these mutants to L-leucine, EDTA, and heat inhibition are, in general, parallel. Mutants in the order of resistance to these treatments are: Glu (most resistant), Asp/Ile/Leu, Gln/Val/, Ser/, and Arg/Thr/Met/Cys//Trp/Tyr/Pro//Ala/Gly (least resistant). However, the Ser-429 and -429 mutants were more resistant to EDTA and heat inhibition than the wild-type GCAP, but were equally sensitive to L-leucine inhibition. Structural analysis of mammalian alkaline phosphatase modeled on the refined crystal structure of Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase indicates that the negative charge of Glu-429 of PLAP, which simultaneously stabilizes the protein as a whole and the metal binding specifically, probably acts through interactions with the metal ligand -320 (-331 in E. coli alkaline phosphatase). Replacement of codon 429 with Gly in GCAP leads to destabilization and loosening of the metal binding. The data suggest that the natural binding site for L-leucine may be near position 429, with the amino and carboxyl groups of L-leucine interacting with bound phosphate and -432 (-412 in E. coli alkaline phosphatase), respectively.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28959869>[Binding of glycoprotein β₂-GPI with oxidized low density lipoprotein].</a></h2><p>We analyzed the binding of P.rβ₂-GPI-DV with ox-LDL by fluorescence, molecular simulation and circular dichroism.

Recombinant protein and model peptide studies.</a></h2><p>An important function of the mammalian nonerythroid alpha-spectrin chain (alpha-fodrin) that distinguishes it from the closely related erythroid isoform is its ability to bind calmodulin. By analysis of a series of deleted recombinant spectrin fusion proteins, we have identified a region in the nonerythroid alpha chain involved in calcium-dependent binding of calmodulin. The region is distinctive in that the sequence is absent from the homologous domain of the erythroid alpha chain and diverges from the normal internal repeat structure observed throughout other spectrins. In order to determine limits of this functional site, a synthetic peptide as small as 24 residues was shown to compete with either recombinant or brain alpha-spectrin in binding to calmodulin. The active peptide, which was derived from a segment between repeats 11 and 12, was composed of the following sequence: -Thr-Ala-Ser-Pro-Trp--Ser-Ala-Arg-Leu-Met-Val--Thr-Val-Ala-Thr-- - Ser-Ile--Glu. Comparison of this sequence with functional sites in other diverse calcium-dependent calmodulin-binding proteins has revealed a structural motif common to all of these proteins, namely clusters of hydrophobic residues interspersed with basic residues. When folded into alpha-helical conformations, these binding sites are predicted to form amphipathic structures.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6424730>[Carboxypeptidase T--intracellular carboxypeptidase of Thermoactinomycetes--a distant analog of animal carboxypeptidase].</a></h2><p>Carboxypeptidase T, an extracellular carboxypeptidase from Thermoactinomyces sp. was isolated and purified by affinity chromatography on bacitracin adsorbents. The enzyme homogeneity was established by SDS electrophoresis (Mr = 38 000) and isoelectrofocusing in PAAG (pI 5.3). Carboxypeptidase T reveals a mixed specificity in comparison with pancreatic carboxypeptidases A and B and cleaves with nearly the same efficiency the peptide bonds formed by the C-terminal residues of basic and neutral hydrophobic amino acids. The enzyme is insensitive to serine and thiol proteinase inhibitors but is completely inhibited by EDTA and o-phenanthroline. The maximal enzyme activity is observed at pH 7-8. With an increase of temperature from 20 to 70 degrees C the enzyme activity is enhanced approximately 10-fold. In the presence of 1 mM Ca2+ the enzyme thermostability is also increased. In terms of some properties, e.g. substrate specificity carboxypeptidase T is similar to metallocarboxypeptidase secreted by Streptomyces griseus.

Additional studies of -319 suggest that it may interact with Glu-269 as well as Asp-240. A cell containing the LacY gene with the mutation -319--> failed to ferment melibiose and after several days melibiose-positive mutants arose on indicator plates.

Although Cys replacement for -319 or -334 also inactivates lactose accumulation, -319 is not essential for active lactose transport (Sahin-Tóth, M., Dunten, R.L., Gonzalez, A., & Kaback, H.R., 1992, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89, 10547-10551), and replacement of -334 with leucine yields permease with considerable activity. All single-Cys mutants except Gly-296 --> Cys are present in the membrane in amounts comparable to C-less permease, as judged by immunological techniques. In contrast, mutant Gly-296 --> Cys is hardly detectable when expressed at a relatively low rate from the lac promoter/operator but present in the membrane in stable form when expressed at a high rate from T7 promoter. Finally, studies with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) show that only a few mutants are inactivated significantly. Remarkably, the rate of inactivation of Val-315 --> Cys permease is enhanced at least 10-fold in the presence of beta-galactopyranosyl 1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside (TDG) or an H+ electrochemical gradient (delta mu-H+). The results demonstrate that only three residues in this region of the permease -Arg-302, -322, and Glu-325-are essential for active lactose transport. Furthermore, the enhanced reactivity of the Val-315 --> Cys mutant toward NEM in the presence of TDG or delta mu-H+ probably reflects a conformational alteration induced by either substrate binding or delta mu-H+.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2587425>Aplysia brasiliana neurons R3-R14: primary structure of the myoactive histidine-rich basic peptide and its prohormone.</a></h2><p>Neurons R3-R14 of the marine mollusc Aplysia are model neuroendocrine cells thought to regulate cardiovascular activity in vivo. The cells express a gene encoding three peptides--peptides I, II and the histidine-rich basic peptide (HRBP)--each of which has been chemically characterized in Aplysia californica. In the studies presented here, HRBP and its prohormone (proHRBP) were purified from A. brasiliana abdominal ganglion extracts by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and characterized by amino acid compositional and sequence analyses. ProHRBP was an 85-residue peptide whose sequence was: NH2-Glu-Glu-Val--Asp-Asp-Thr-Asp-Val-Gly-Asp-Glu-Leu-Thr--Ala-Leu- Glu-Ser - Val-Leu-Thr-Asp-Leu--Asp--Arg-Asp-Ala-Glu-Glu-Pro-Ser-Ala--Met- Thr-Arg - Leu-Arg-Arg-Gln-Val-Ala-Gln-Met--Ile-Trp-Arg-Ala---Asp-Arg-- -Ser - Thr-Gly-Ser-Gly-Arg--Ser-Arg--Leu-Thr-Arg--Arg-Tyr-Gly-Gly-Gly- -Leu - Ser-Asp-Ala-COOG. It differed from A. californica pro-HRBP at seven of the 85 positions. Compositional and sequence analyses demonstrated that A. brasiliana HRBP was a 43-residue peptide corresponding to residues 43 through 85 of proHRBP, and that a significant proportion of the isolated peptide possessed a blocked NH2 terminus. Although this sequence differed from that of A. californica HRBP at five of 43 residues, the two peptides were approximately equipotent in inducing contractions of A. californica crop muscle in vitro, suggesting that the substituted residues may not be critical for biological activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11912217>Structure of formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase covalently complexed to DNA.</a></h2><p>Formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg) is a DNA repair enzyme that excises oxidized purines from damaged DNA. The Schiff base intermediate formed during this reaction between Escherichia coli Fpg and DNA was trapped by reduction with sodium borohydride, and the structure of the resulting covalently cross-linked complex was determined at a 2.1-A resolution. Fpg is a bilobal protein with a wide, positively charged DNA-binding groove. It possesses a conserved zinc finger and a helix-two turn-helix motif that participate in DNA binding. The absolutely conserved residues -56, -70, -168, and Arg-258 form hydrogen bonds to the phosphodiester backbone of DNA, which is sharply kinked at the lesion site. Residues Met-73, Arg-109, and -110 are inserted into the DNA helix, filling the void created by nucleotide eversion. A deep hydrophobic pocket in the active site is positioned to accommodate an everted base. Structural analysis of the Fpg-DNA complex reveals essential features of damage recognition and the catalytic mechanism of Fpg.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2803320>Isolation of a novel 38 residue-hypothalamic polypeptide which stimulates adenylate cyclase in pituitary cells.</a></h2><p>A novel neuropeptide which stimulates adenylate cyclase in rat anterior pituitary cell cultures was isolated from ovine hypothalamic tissues.

MEN13918 (Ngamma[Nalpha[Nalpha(benzo[b]thiophen-2-yl)carbonyl]-1-aminocyclohexan-1-carboxy]-d-phenylalanyl]-3-cis-aminocyclohexan-1-carboxylic-acid-N-(1S,2R)-2-aminocyclohexyl)amide trifluoroacetate salt) and MEN14268 (Nalpha[Nalpha(benzo[b]thiophen-2-yl)carbonyl)-1-aminocyclopentane-1-carboxyl]-d-phenylalanine-N-[3(morpholin-4-yl)propyl]amide trifluoroacetate salt) were more potent in blocking neurokinin A (NKA, --Thr-Asp-Ser--Val-Gly-Leu-Met-NH(2)) induced contraction in human, which induced greater contraction in human (pK(B) 9.1 and 8.3) than rat (pK(B) 6.8 and <6) urinary bladder smooth muscle preparation in vitro. In agreement with functional data, in membrane preparations of CHO cells stably expressing the human NK(2) receptors, both MEN13918 and MEN14268 potently inhibited the binding of agonist ([(125)I]NKA, K(i) 0.2 and 2.8 nM) and antagonist ([(3)H]nepadutant, K(i) 0.1 and 2.2 nM, [(3)H]SR48968 K(i) 0.4 and 6.9 nM) radioligands. Using site-directed mutagenesis and radioligands binding we identified six residues in the transmembrane (TM) helices that are critical determinants for the studied antagonists affinity. To visualize these experimental findings, we constructed a homology model based on the X-ray crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin and suggested a possible binding mode of these newly discovered antagonist ligands to the human tackykinin NK(2) receptor. Both MEN13918 and MEN14268 bind amongst TM4 (Cys167Gly), TM5 (Tyr206Ala), TM6 (Tyr266Ala, Phe270Ala), and TM7 (Tyr289Phe, Tyr289Thr). MEN13918 and MEN14268 diverging binding profile at Y289 mutations in TM7 (Tyr289Phe, Tyr289Thr) suggests a relation of their different chemical moieties with this residue. Moreover, the different influence on binding of these two ligands by mutations located deep along the inner side of TM6 (Phe270Ala, Tyr266Ala, Trp263Ala) indicates a nonequivalent positioning, although occupying the same binding crevice. Furthermore, binding data indicate the Ile202Phe mutation, which mimics the wild-type rat NK(2) receptor sequence, as a species selectivity determinant. In summary, data with mutant receptors describe, for these new tachykinin NK(2) receptor antagonists, a binding site which is partially overlapping either with that of the cyclized peptide antagonist nepadutant (cyclo-[[(beta-d-GlcNAc)-Asp-Trp--Dpr-Leu]cyclo(2beta-5beta)] or the nonpeptide antagonist SR48968 ((S)-N-methyl-N[4-(4-acetylamino-4-phenylpiperidino)-2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)butyl]benzamide).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24287321>"To serve and protect": enzyme inhibitors as radiopeptide escorts promote tumor targeting.</a></h2><p>Radiolabeled octreotide analogs are most successfully being applied today in clinical cancer imaging and treatment. Propagation of this paradigm to other radiopeptide families has been greatly hampered by the inherent poor  stability of systemically administered peptide analogs. We hypothesized that the in vivo coadministration of specific enzyme inhibitors would improve peptide bioavailability and hence tumor uptake. Through single coinjection of the neutral endopeptidase inhibitor phosphoramidon (PA), we were able to provoke remarkable rises in the percentages of circulating intact somatostatin, gastrin, and bombesin radiopeptides in mouse models, resulting in a remarkable increase in uptake in tumor xenografts in mice.The peptide conjugates [DOTA-Ala(1)]SS14 (DOTA-Ala-Gly-c[Cys-----Trp--Thr--Thr-Ser-Cys]-OH), PanSB1 (DOTA-PEG2-dTyr-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-βAla---Nle-NH2), and DOTA-MG11 (DOTA-dGlu-Ala-Tyr-Gly-Trp-Met-Asp--NH2) were labeled with (111)In by 20 min of heating at an acidic pH.  stability was studied with high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of blood samples collected 5 min after the injection of the test radiopeptide alone or with PA into mice. Biodistribution was studied after injection of each (111)In-labeled radiopeptide alone or after coinjection of PA in tumor-bearing severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice.The amount of intact [(111)In-DOTA-Ala(1)]SS14 detected in the mouse circulation at 5 min after the injection of PA increased impressively-from less than 2% to 86%-whereas the uptake in AR4-2J xenografts rose from less than 1 percentage injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g) to 14 %ID/g at 4 h after injection. Likewise, the coadministration of PA resulted in a marked increase in the amount of circulating intact (111)In-PanSB1-from 12% to 80%-at 5 min after injection, and radioligand uptake in human PC-3 xenografts in SCID mice escalated from less than 4 %ID/g to greater than 21 %ID/g at 4 h after injection. In a similar manner, the coadministration of PA resulted in an equally impressive increase in intact [(111)In-DOTA]MG11 levels in the mouse bloodstream-from less than 5% to 70%-at 5 min after injection, leading to a remarkable increase in radiotracer uptake-from 2 %ID/g to greater than 15 %ID/g-in both AR4-2J tumors and A431(CCKR+) tumors (i.e., tumors induced by A431 cells transfected to stably express the human cholecystokinin subtype 2 receptor) in mice at 4 h after injection. This effect was well visualized by SPECT/CT imaging of AR4-2J tumor-bearing mice at 4 h after injection.The results of this study clearly demonstrate that the coadministration of key enzyme inhibitors can effectively prolong the survival of radiolabeled peptides in the circulation, securing their safe transit to the target. This strategy clearly provoked an unprecedented increase in radiolabel accumulation in tumor xenografts in mice; this increase might translate into higher diagnostic sensitivity or improved therapeutic efficacy of radiopeptide drugs in cancer patients. Hence, our findings provide exciting new opportunities for the application of biodegradable (radio)peptide drugs of either natural or synthetic origin as well as for the rationale design of analogs that are stable in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7694488>Primary structures and effects on gastrointestinal motility of tachykinins from the rainbow trout.</a></h2><p>Purification and structural characterization of tachykinins from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) intestine has demonstrated the presence of three different peptides related to the mammalian tachykinins: substance P, neurokinin A, and neuropeptide-gamma. The substance P- and the neurokinin A-related peptides present in the intestine are identical to the tachykinins previously isolated from the trout brain. The neuropeptide-gamma-related peptide (Ser-Ser-Ala--Pro-Gln-Ile-Thr-Arg--Arg---Ile--Ser-- Val-Gly-Leu-Met-NH2), not previously identified in brain tissue, has the sequence of the neurokinin A-related tachykinin at its COOH-terminus. Both trout substance P and neurokinin A stimulated the motility of isolated trout intestinal muscle [pD2(-log of EC50) values 8.5 +/- 0.15 and 7.35 +/- 0.08, respectively] and the vascularly perfused trout stomach (pD2 values 9.63 +/- 0.23 and 8.18 +/- 0.23, respectively).

The growth kinetics, physiological state, and nutrient requirement profiles of S. thermophilus were analyzed in chemically defined media. The results showed that the intracellular ATP concentration, H -ATPase activity, NADH/NAD , and NH concentrations varied with intracellular pH. The nutrient components with the highest amounts required were Leu and Asp; ascorbic acid and p-amino benzoic acid; K and PO  ; and guanine and uracil. The nutrient components with the largest required ratios were Arg, , and Met; folic acid, cyanocobalamine, biotin, and nicotinic acid; Ca and Mg ; and guanine and uracil. In this study, different nutrient components were primarily used at different phase. Trp, Tyr, calcium pantothenate, thiamine, guanine, and Mg were mainly used from late-lag to midexponential phase. Met, Pro, , Ala, Gly, nicotinic acid, and riboflavin were mainly used from midexponential to late-exponential phase. The highest bioavailabilities of nutrient components were also found at diverse phase. Met, Leu, Ile, , Glu, , Pro, Gly, riboflavin, nicotinic acid, adenine, uracil, inosine, and Ca had the highest bioavailability from late-lag to midexponential phase. Lactose, Glu, Asp, , Trp, Cys, Val, Arg, , Ala, Ser, Thr, Tyr, folate and cobalamin, calcium pantothenate, ascorbic acid, thiamine, biotin, p-amino benzoic acid, vitamin B , K , Mg , guanine, xanthine, and PO  had the highest bioavailability from midexponential to late-exponential phase. This study elucidated the nutrient requirement profiles with culture time and biomass at various average growth rates during the growth of S. thermophilus.

The reaction obeyed first-order kinetics with a rate constant of 0.69 h-1. In order to isolate the peptide containing the diisopropylphosphoryl moiety (DIP), partially purified lipoprotein lipase was covalently labeled with [3H]DFP, and the labeled protein was reduced, carboxymethylated, and further purified to about 90% homogeneity. Cyanogen bromide cleavage followed by gel filtration yielded a radioactive peptide of 6-8 kDa. This peptide was succinylated and then digested with Staphylococcus aureus V8 proteinase. From this digest, a peptide containing 0.95 mol of [3H] DIP/mol of peptide was isolated by gel-permeation chromatography followed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Automated Edman degradation provided the following sequence: Ala-Ile-Gly-Ile--Trp-Gly-Gly- (DIP)Ser-Pro--Gln---Gly-Ala-Val--Ile--(Ser, Leu)-Glu. Analysis of the sequence for secondary structure suggests that the reactive serine of lipoprotein lipase is in a beta-turn, a structure similar to those of the active sites of most other serine proteinases. Lipoprotein lipase appears to share this secondary structure with other serine hydrolases despite significant differences in the primary structure of this domain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19158091>Novel determinants of epithelial sodium channel gating within extracellular thumb domains.</a></h2><p>Activity of the epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC) is modulated by Na(+) self-inhibition, an allosteric down-regulation of channel open probability by extracellular Na(+). We searched for determinants of Na(+) self-inhibition by analyzing changes in this inhibitory response resulting from specific mutations within the extracellular domains of mouse ENaC subunits. Mutations at gammaMet(438) altered the Na(+) self-inhibition response in a substitution-specific manner. Fourteen substitutions (Ala, Arg, Asp, Cys, Gln, Glu, , Ile, , Pro, Ser, Thr, Tyr, and Val) significantly suppressed Na(+) self-inhibition, whereas three mutations (, Gly, and Leu) moderately enhanced the inhibition. Met to  mutation did not alter Na(+) self-inhibition. Mutations at the homologous site in the alpha subunit (G481A, G481C, and G481M) dramatically increased the magnitude and speed of Na(+) self-inhibition. Mutations at the homologous betaAla(422) resulted in minimal or no change in Na(+) self-inhibition. Low, high, and intermediate open probabilities were observed in oocytes expressing alphaG481Mbetagamma, alphabetagammaM438V, and alphaG481M/betagammaM438V, respectively. This pair of residues map to thealpha5 helix in the extracellular thumb domain in the chicken acid sensing ion channel 1 structure. Both residues likely reside near the channel surface because both alphaG481Cbetagamma and alphabetagammaM438C channels were inhibited by an externally applied and membrane-impermeant sulfhydryl reagent. Our results demonstrate that alphaGly(481) and gammaMet(438) are functional determinants of Na(+) self-inhibition and of ENaC gating and suggest that the thumb domain contributes to the channel gating machinery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10375473>Insulin and proglucagon-derived peptides from the horned frog, Ceratophrys ornata (Anura:Leptodactylidae).</a></h2><p>Insulin and peptides derived from the processing of proglucagon have been isolated from an extract of the pancreas of the South American horned frog, Ceratophrys ornata (Leptodactylidae).

Ceratophrys glucagon was isolated in two molecular forms with 29- and 36-amino acid residues in approximately equal amounts. Glucagon-29 is identical to glucagon from B. marinus and from the bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana (Ranidae) and contains only 1 amino acid substitution (Thr29 --> Ser) compared with glucagon from Xenopus laevis (Pipidae). Glucagon-36 comprises glucagon-29 extended from its C-terminus by -Arg-Ser-Gly-Gly-Met-Ser.

Data concerning hpGRF action on cAMP and GH are consistent with the concept of cAMP acting as a second messenger for this releasing factor. hpGRF-stimulated GH release is Ca++ dependent. Exogenous hpGRF40 does not alter the interdigestive gastric motility or secretion of gastrin and motilin in dogs, while large doses of hpGRF stimulate somatostatin release into the hepatic portal blood of the rat. Significant GRF activity as determined by a rat pituitary perifusion system is confined within the median eminence and the arcuate nucleus, though detectable but insignificant GRF activity is present in other area of the hypothalamus and cortex in the rat. GRF activity is present in the ovine brain as well as in the gut. Both tissues contain large (between 4000-5000 daltons) and small (but possibly larger than 1000 daltons) m.w. GRF materials. GRF appears to be structurally different between species and more than one GRF may be present within the same species.

Though many hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity scales have been generated, an "intrinsic" scale has yet to be achieved. "Intrinsic" implies the maximum possible hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of side chains in the absence of nearest-neighbor or conformational effects that would decrease the full expression of the side-chain hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity when the side chain is in a polypeptide chain. Such a scale is the fundamental starting point for determining the parameters that affect side-chain hydrophobicity and for quantifying such effects in peptides and proteins. A 10-residue peptide sequence, Ac-X-G-A-K-G-A-G-V-G-L-amide, was designed to enable the determination of the intrinsic values, where position X was substituted by all 20 naturally occurring amino acids and norvaline, norleucine, and ornithine. The coefficients were determined by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography using six different mobile phase conditions involving different pH values (2, 5, and 7), ion-pairing reagents, and the presence and absence of different salts. The results show that the intrinsic hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of amino acid side chains in peptides (proteins) is independent of pH, buffer conditions, or whether C(8) or C(18) reversed-phase columns were used for 17 side chains (Gly, Ala, Cys, Pro, Val, nVal, Leu, nLeu, Ile, Met, Tyr, , Trp, Ser, Thr, , and Gln) and dependent on pH and buffer conditions, including the type of salt or ion-pairing reagent for potentially charged side chains (Orn, , , Arg, Asp, and Glu).Copyright 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25199845>New layers in understanding and predicting α-linolenic acid content in plants using amino acid characteristics of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase.</a></h2><p>α-linolenic acid (ALA) is the most frequent omega-3 in plants. The content of ALA is highly variable, ranging from 0 to 1% in rice and corn to >50% in perilla and flax. ALA production is strongly correlated with the enzymatic activity of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase. To unravel the underlying mechanisms of omega-3 diversity, 895 protein features of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase were compared between plants with high and low omega-3. Attribute weighting showed that this enzyme in plants with high omega-3 content has higher amounts of , -, and Pro- but lower Aliphatic index, Gly-, and Pro-Leu. The Random Forest model with Accuracy criterion when run on the dataset pre-filtered with Info Gain algorithm was the best model in distinguishing high omega-3 content based on the frequency of - in the structure of fatty acid desaturase. Interestingly, the discriminant function algorithm could predict the level of omega-3 only based on the six important selected attributes (out of 895 protein attributes) of fatty acid desaturase with 75% accuracy. We developed "Plant omega3 predictor" to predict the content of α-linolenic acid based on structural features of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase. The software calculates the 6 key structural protein features from imported Fasta sequence of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase or utilizes the imported features and predicts the ALA content using discriminant function formula. This work unravels an underpinning mechanism of omega-3 diversity via discovery of the key protein attributes in the structure of omega-3 desaturase offering a new approach to obtain higher omega-3 content.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Training did not affect the plasma amino acid levels in the resting state. Plasma concentrations of alanine (Ala), aspartic acid (Asp), asparagine (), arginine (Arg), histidine (), isoleucine (Ile), leucine (Leu), lysine (), methionine (Met), phenylalanine (), proline (Pro), serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), and valine (Val) were significantly lower, whereas glutamate (Glu), glycine (Gly), ornithine (Orn), tryptophan (Trp), tyrosine (Tyr), creatinine, urea, and ammonia levels were unchanged, after one hour of treadmill running in the trained rats. Plasma concentration of glutamine (Glu), the branched-chain keto acids (BCKA) and short-chain acyl carnitines were elevated with exercise. Ratios of plasma BCAA/BCKA were dramatically lowered by exercise in the trained rats. A decrease in plasma-free carnitine levels was also observed. These data suggest that amino acid  is enhanced by exercise even in the trained state. BCAA may only be partially metabolized within muscle and some of their carbon skeletons are released into the circulation in forms of BCKA and short-chain acyl carnitines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8902847>Effect of modification of all loop regions in the alpha- and beta-subunits of human choriogonadotropin on its signal transduction activity.</a></h2><p>Human choriogonadotropin (hCG), according to its three dimensional structure as determined by X-ray diffraction, has three beta-hairpin loops each in the alpha and beta subunit designated as alpha 1, alpha 2 alpha 3 and beta 1 beta 2 and beta 3, respectively. Since similar beta-hairpin loops in NGF and TNF beta have been implicated in their direct interaction with the receptor, it prompted the present investigation to determine the role of such loops in receptor binding and post-receptor signaling events in hCG. Based on the three dimensional structure of hCG, radical mutations were introduced in the alpha loops by replacing hydrophobic alpha 18Phe and alpha 74Phe by hydrophilic Thr residues in the alpha 1 and alpha 3 loops, respectively, and positively charged alpha 45Lys by negatively charged Asp in the helical segment in the alpha 2 loop. The beta loops were mutated by replacement of the beta 1, beta 2 and beta 3 sequences with the corresponding hFSH sequences. These replacements included beta 22Gly, beta 24Pro and beta 25Val with Glu, Arg and  in beta 1, 45Leu Gln Gly Val Leu Pro Ala Leu Pro53 with Tyr   Pro Ala Arg Pro Leu Ile in beta 2 and 73Pro Arg Gly with Ala   in the beta 3 loop. Six mutants, hCG alpha 1 beta, hCG alpha 2 beta and hCG alpha 3 beta and hCG alpha beta 1, hCG alpha beta 2 and h CG alpha beta 3, were obtained by co-infection of the insect High-Five cells with baculovirus containing mutant alpha or beta cDNAs and that containing complimentary wild type beta or alpha cDNAs. The mutants were almost completely secreted in the culture medium and were over expressed at levels ranging between 4.5 to 29 micrograms/ml indicating that mutations had no effect on the secretion or subunit assembly of hCG. In order to remove any contaminating beta-subunit, the culture medium was passed through a column of an hCG beta-specific monoclonal antibody, B158. The receptor binding activity of the mutant hCG alpha 1 beta, in which alpha 18Phe was replaced with Thr, increased almost 200% relative to rehCG. Similarly, increase in the cAMP and progesterone stimulation by the mutant ranged between 150 to 200%. This increase is believed to be due to a short range conformational change in the mutant as a result of the mutation rather than direct involvement of alpha 18Phe in the receptor binding. The evidence in support of this was derived from the fact that the affinity or interaction between the two subunits was impaired as indicated by the first order rate constant of hCG alpha 1 beta (km = 4.1 x 10(-2) min-1) at pH 3.0 at 23 degrees C which is one order of magnitude greater relative to rehCG (kw = 4.6 x 10(-3) min-1). All other mutations had no effect on the receptor binding or signal transduction of hCG indicating that, unlike NGF or TNF beta, beta-hairpin loops in hCG were not directly involved in receptor binding or post-receptor signaling events. However, since the mutation in the alpha 1 loop affects the receptor binding site, its presence in the vicinity of the alpha 1 loop is highly likely.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1480521>Isolation and primary structure of gastrin-releasing peptide from a teleost fish, the trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).</a></h2><p>Immunohistochemical studies have established that fish gastrointestinal tissues contain peptides with gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP)/bombesin-like immunoreactivity, but the molecular nature of this material is unclear. In this study, the most abundant peptide that was immunoreactive towards an antiserum raised against pig GRP was isolated in pure form from an extract of the stomach of the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The primary structure of the peptide was established as: Ser-Glu--Thr-Gly-Ala-Ile-Gly--Val10- -Pro-Arg-Gly---Trp-Ala-Val-Gly20--Leu-Met-NH2. Although this amino acid sequence is shorter than those of mammalian GRPs by four residues, the COOH-terminal dodecapeptide is identical to the corresponding region in pig GRP. The data indicate, therefore, that the predominant molecular form of GRP in the stomach of a teleost fish is structurally more similar to mammalian GRP than to the amphibian skin peptide, bombesin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7997174>Redundancy of the conserved  residue in Azotobacter vinelandii NifL, a histidine autokinase homologue which regulates transcription of nitrogen fixation genes.</a></h2><p>The NifL protein of Azotobacter vinelandii inhibits NifA, the activator of nif (nitrogen fixation) transcription, in response to oxygen and fixed nitrogen. NifL shows strong homology in its C-terminal domain to the histidine autokinase domains of the canonical two-component sensor proteins, including the region around -304, which corresponds to the residue known to be phosphorylated in other systems. To examine the mechanism of sensory transduction by NifL, mutations encoding 10 substitutions for -304 were introduced into the A. vinelandii chromosome. Regulation of nif transcription was measured using acetylene reduction and RNA blots. The substitutions -304-->Arg and -304-->Pro impaired regulation by both fixed nitrogen and oxygen, but substitution of Ala, , Ile, , , Ser, Thr, Val had no effect. None of the mutants, including -304-->Arg and -304-->Pro, excreted ammonium during diazotrophy, a phenotype of nifL deletion mutants, suggesting that the molecular basis of this effect differs from that responsible for the inhibition of nif transcription. The data show conclusively that phosphorylation of -304 is not essential for any of the known functions of A. vinelandii NifL. Homology to the family of histidine autokinases is therefore inadequate evidence for a mechanism of sensory transduction involving phosphorylation of the conserved histidine residue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2441759>A novel vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) from elasmobranch intestine has full affinity for mammalian pancreatic VIP receptors.</a></h2><p>A peptide that cross reacted with N-terminal, but not C-terminal, antisera to vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) was isolated from extracts of intestine from the dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula. Microsequence analysis gave the structure -Ser-Asp-Ala-Val--Thr-Asp--Tyr-Ser-Arg-Ile-Arg--Gln-Met-Ala-Val- - -Tyr-Ile--Ser-Leu-Leu-Ala-NH2. C-terminal amidation was determined by HPLC analysis of phenylthiocarbamyl amino acid derivatives after carboxypeptidase Y digestion. The peptide differs at five positions from the porcine octacosapeptide. Dogfish VIP was equipotent with its porcine counterpart in inhibiting binding of 125I-labelled VIP to guinea pig dispersed pancreatic acini, and in stimulating amylase secretion by the same preparation. The data indicate a strong conservation of VIP during evolution and permit identification of residues crucial for bioactivity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3181138>Isolation and structural analysis of a peptide containing the novel tyrosyl-glucose linkage in glycogenin.</a></h2><p>The glucosylation site on glycogenin, the protein primer required for de novo glycogen synthesis, has been identified. The glucose is attached at position C1 in a glycosidic linkage with a unique tyrosine, and the sequence surrounding this residue was found to be: -Leu-Pro--Ile-Tyr--Leu-Ser-Ser-Ile-Ser-Ile-Tyr(Glc)-Ser-Tyr-Leu -Pro- Ala--. The same tyrosine residue is glycosylated whether glycogenin is isolated as a complex with the catalytic subunit of glycogen synthase, or covalently attached to glycogen. The possibility that insulin and growth factors may enhance glycogen synthesis via stimulation of the priming reaction is discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2670925>Isolation and characterization of lactose permease mutants with an enhanced recognition of maltose and diminished recognition of cellobiose.</a></h2><p>In the present study, lactose permease mutants were isolated which have an enhanced recognition toward maltose (an alpha-glucoside) and diminished recognition for cellobiose (a beta-glucoside). Nine mutants were isolated from a strain encoding a wild-type permease (pTE18) and nine from a strain encoding a mutant permease which recognizes maltose (pB15). All 18 mutants were subjected to DNA sequencing, and it was found that all mutations are single base substitutions within the lac Y gene effecting single amino acid substitutions within the protein. From the pTE18 parent, substitutions involved Tyr-236 to  or ; Ser-306 to Thr; and six independent mutants in which Ala-389 was changed to Pro. From pB15, Tyr-236 was changed to  or , Ser-306 to Thr or Leu, -319 to , and -322 to Tyr, , or Gln. All 18 mutants exhibited enhanced recognition for maltose (compared with the pTE18 strain) and a diminished recognition for cellobiose. In addition, all mutants showed a diminished recognition toward beta-galactosides as well. The -236, -236, Leu-306, -319, Tyr-322, -322, and Gln-322 mutants were completely defective in the uphill accumulation of methyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside whereas the -236, Thr-306, and Pro-389 mutants could effectively accumulate methyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside against a concentration gradient. The mutants obtained in this study, together with previous lactose permease mutants, tend to be found on transmembrane segments, and those which are on the same transmembrane segment are often found three or four amino acids away from each other. This pattern is consistent with a protein structure in which important amino acid side chains project from several transmembrane segments in such a way as to form a hydrophilic channel for the recognition and transport of H+ and galactosides. It is proposed that the mechanism for H+/lactose cotransport is consistent with a "flanking gate" model in which the protein contains a single recognition site for galactosides within the channel which is flanked on either side by gates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10525356>Purification and characterization of insulin from the Australian lungfish, Neoceratodus forsteri (Dipnoi).</a></h2><p>The Australian lungfish Neoceratodus forsteri, a facultative air breather, is considered to be the most primitive of the extant Dipnoi and so occupies a uniquely important evolutionary position in the transition from fish to tetrapods. Insulin was isolated from an extract of the pancreas of N. forsteri and its primary structure established as: A-Chain, Gly-Ile-Val-Glu-Gln-Cys-Cys--Thr-Pro(10)-Cys-Ser-Leu-Tyr-Gln-Leu-G lu--Tyr-Cys(20)--Glu-Thr-Glu; B-Chain, Ala-Ala-Val--Gln--Leu-Cys-Gly-Ser(10)--Leu-Val-Glu-Ala-Leu- Tyr--Val-Cys(20)-Gly-Glu-Arg-Gly---Tyr-Leu-Pro- (30)-Gly. This amino acid sequence is more similar to that of human insulin than to insulins from present-day amphibians. All the residues in human insulin that are considered to be important in receptor binding, dimerization, and hexamerization are conserved in lungfish insulin except for the substitution (Leu --> ) at the position corresponding to B17 in human insulin. Consistent with the assertion that the Dipnoi is a monophyletic group, insulins from N. forsteri and from the African lungfish Protopterus annectens contain extensions to the C-terminus of the A-chain and to the N-terminus of the B-chain that have not been found in other sarcopterygian species. However, the unusual amino acid substitutions found in insulin from P. annectens (e.g., GlyB21 --> Ala, GluB22 --> Asp, and ArgB23 --> ) are not present in N. forsteri insulin, suggesting that they occurred in the Protopterus lineage after divergence of the genera.Copyright 1999 Academic Press.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1744108>Bombinin-like peptides with antimicrobial activity from skin secretions of the Asian toad, Bombina orientalis.</a></h2><p>The structures and hemolytic and bactericidal activities of three bombinin-like peptides, or BLP-1-3, from the skin of Bombina orientalis are described. The peptides were isolated from the skin of B. orientalis and sequenced by tandem mass spectrometry and are amphipathic, cationic peptides of 25-27 amino acids in length. The sequence of the most abundant member (BLP-1) is: Gly-Ile-Gly-Ala-Ser-Ile-Leu-Ser-Ala-Gly--Ser-Ala-Leu--Gly-Leu- Ala--Gly-Leu-Ala-Glu---Ala--NH2. All three peptides were found to share considerable, but not complete, homology with bombinin, an antimicrobial, hemolytic peptide first isolated by Michl and Csordas (Csordas, A., and Michl, A. (1970) Monatsh. Chem. 101, 182-189) from the skin of Bombina variegata. The BLPs have been assayed for antibiotic and hemolytic activity and found to be more potent than magainin 2 (a related antimicrobial peptide from Xenopus laevis) in their ability to kill bacteria. However, no significant hemolytic activity was found for these peptides which suggests a selectivity for prokaryotic over eukaryotic membranes. The molecular basis for antibacterial activity is presumed to be due to their predicted amphipathic alpha-helical structures which is supported by circular dichroism measurements that found significant helical content (63-69% alpha-helix) in 40% trifluoroethanol. Last, a cDNA library was constructed from the skin of B. orientalis and screened with an oligonucleotide probe complementary to the COOH terminus of BLP-1. Several clones were isolated and sequenced that encode BLP-1 and BLP-3, as well as an additional peptide (BLP-4) that differs by two amino acid substitutions from BLP-3.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3110143>Identification of a lysyl residue in antithrombin which is essential for heparin binding.</a></h2><p>Identification of lysyl residue(s) in human plasma antithrombin required for binding of heparin was approached using chemical modification with the amino-group reagent pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. Modification of antithrombin with limiting amounts of reagent yields an average incorporation of the phosphopyridoxyl label into 1 lysine/protein molecule (Pecon, J. M., and Blackburn, M. N. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 935-938). Fractionation of the labeled antithrombin by affinity chromatography on heparin-Sepharose separated a phosphopyridoxylated antithrombin species devoid of heparin binding from modified protein which retained affinity for heparin. To generate peptide maps of the two antithrombin species, the proteins were reductively denatured, S-carboxymethylated, and digested with trypsin. Fractionation of the tryptic digests by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography indicated one peak in the chromatogram of the non-heparin-binding species to be clearly different when compared to the chromatogram of the heparin-binding species. The sequence of the unique peptide, determined by automated Edman degradation, was Thr-Ser-Asp-Gln-Ile-----Ala--Leu--Cys-Arg. This peptide corresponds to a tryptic fragment including residues 115-129 in the sequence of antithrombin, with the modified residue identified as -125. Additionally, phosphopyridoxylation of antithrombin in the presence of added heparin indicated that several other lysyl residues were "protected" from modification. Identification of this critical lysine for heparin binding strongly supports previous data which indicate that the heparin-binding domain of antithrombin is located at the NH2 terminus within one of the disulfide cross-linked loops of the protein.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11023819>Evaluation of the role of two conserved active-site residues in beta class glutathione S-transferases.</a></h2><p>Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) normally use hydroxy-group-containing residues in the N-terminal domain of the enzyme for stabilizing the activated form of the co-substrate, glutathione. However, previous mutagenesis studies have shown that this is not true for Beta class GSTs and thus the origin of the stabilization remains a mystery. The recently determined crystal structure of Proteus mirabilis GST B1-1 (PmGST B1-1) suggested that the stabilizing role might be fulfilled in Beta class GSTs by one or more residues in the C-terminal domain of the enzyme. To test this hypothesis we mutated (106) and (107) of PmGST B1-1 to investigate their possible role in the enzyme's catalytic activity. (106) was mutated to Ala,  and , and (107) to Ala and Arg. The effects of the replacement on the activity, thermal stability and antibiotic-binding capacity of the enzyme were examined. The results are consistent with the involvement of (106) and (107) in interacting with glutathione at the active site but these residues do not contribute significantly to catalysis, folding or antibiotic binding.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2760065>Formation of isoaspartate at two distinct sites during in vitro aging of human growth hormone.</a></h2><p>In vitro aging at pH 7.4, 37 degrees C causes natural sequence recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH), methionyl rhGH, and human pituitary growth hormone to become substrates for bovine brain protein carboxyl methyltransferase, an enzyme that modifies the "side chain" alpha-carboxyl group present at atypical isoaspartyl linkages. The substrate capacity of rhGH increased at a rate of 1.8 methyl-accepting sites/day/100 molecules of hormone. Reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of trypsin digests of aged rhGH revealed two altered peptides not present in digests of control rhGH. These two fragments, which had the amino acid compositions of residues 128-134 (Leu-Glu-Asp-Gly-Ser-Pro-Arg) and 146-158 (-Asp-Thr--Ser---Asp-Asp-Ala-Leu-Leu-), contained the majority of the induced methylation sites, 22 and 58%, respectively. Isoaspartate can result from deamidation of asparagine or isomerization of aspartate. Isomerization of Asp-130, the only candidate site in 128-134, was corroborated by coelution of the altered fragment with the synthetic isoaspartyl peptide upon reversed-phase HPLC. Evidence is presented that the altered 146-158 fragment is a mixture of two peptides resulting from deamidation of -149 to form 70-80% isoaspartate and 20-30% aspartate at this position. The position of isoaspartate in the altered 146-158 fragment was deduced from mass spectrometry, which indicated a single deamidated asparagine; from methylation stoichiometry, which indicated only one methylation site; and from automated Edman degradation, which showed an absence of asparagine and a low yield of aspartate at position 149. These results show that isoaspartate formation from both aspartate and asparagine is a significant, and possibly the major, source of spontaneous covalent alteration of rhGH and that enzymatic carboxyl methylation provides a powerful tool for assessing this type of modification.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9225251>The structures of the frenatin peptides from the skin secretion of the giant tree frog Litoria infrafrenata.</a></h2><p>The granular dorsal glands of the giant tree frog Litoria infrafrenata contain five peptides including caerulein (a known neuropeptide), and four new peptides named franatins 1 (MH+ = 1140 Da), 2 (1423), 3 (2180), 4 (2493).

The human GLTP fold is unique among lipid binding/transfer proteins, defining the GLTP superfamily. Herein, GLTP fold formation by HET-C2, its glycolipid transfer specificity, and the functional role(s) of its two Trp residues have been investigated. X-ray diffraction (1.9 A) revealed a GLTP fold with all key sugar headgroup recognition residues (Asp(66), (70), (73), Trp(109), and (147)) conserved and properly oriented for glycolipid binding. Far-UV CD showed secondary structure dominated by alpha-helices and a cooperative thermal unfolding transition of 49 degrees C, features consistent with a GLTP fold. Environmentally induced optical activity of Trp/Tyr/ (2:4:12) detected by near-UV CD was unaffected by membranes containing glycolipid but was slightly altered by membranes lacking glycolipid. Trp fluorescence was maximal at approximately 355 nm and accessible to aqueous quenchers, indicating free exposure to the aqueous milieu and consistent with surface localization of the two Trps. Interaction with membranes lacking glycolipid triggered significant decreases in Trp emission intensity but lesser than decreases induced by membranes containing glycolipid. Binding of glycolipid (confirmed by electrospray injection mass spectrometry) resulted in a blue-shifted emission wavelength maximum (approximately 6 nm) permitting determination of binding affinities. The unique positioning of Trp(208) at the HET-C2 C terminus revealed membrane-induced conformational changes that precede glycolipid uptake, whereas key differences in residues of the sugar headgroup recognition center accounted for altered glycolipid specificity and suggested evolutionary adaptation for the simpler glycosphingolipid compositions of filamentous fungi.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1908859>Inhibition of subtilisin BPN' by reaction site P1 mutants of Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor.</a></h2><p>It has been shown that the P1 site (the center of the reactive site) of protease inhibitors corresponds to the specificity of the cognate protease, and consequently specificity of Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor (SSI) can be altered by substitution of a single amino acid at the P1 site. In this paper, to investigate whether similar correlation between inhibitory activity of mutated SSI and substrate preference of protease is observed for subtilisin BPN', which has broad substrate specificity, a complete set of mutants of SSI at the reaction site P1 (position 73) was constructed by cassette and site-directed mutagenesis and their inhibitory activities toward subtilisin BPN' were measured. Mutated SSIs which have a polar (Ser, Thr, Gln, ), basic (, Arg), or aromatic amino acid (Tyr, , Trp, ), or Ala or Leu, at the P1 site showed almost the same strong inhibitory activity toward subtilisin as the wild type (Met) SSI. However, the inhibitory activity of SSI variants with an acidic (Glu, Asp), or a beta-branched aliphatic amino acid (Val, Ile), or Gly or Pro, at P1 was decreased. The values of the inhibitor constant (Ki) of mutated SSIs toward subtilisin BPN' were consistent with the substrate preference of subtilisin BPN'. A linear correlation was observed between log(1/Ki) of mutated SSIs and log(1/Km) of synthetic substrates. These results demonstrate that the inhibitory activities of P1 site mutants of SSI are linearly related to the substrate preference of subtilisin BPN', and indicate that the binding mode of the inhibitors with the protease may be similar to that of substrates, as in the case of trypsin and chymotrypsin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11983426>Legumain from bovine kidney: its purification, molecular cloning, immunohistochemical localization and degradation of annexin II and vitamin D-binding protein.</a></h2><p>Legumain (asparaginyl endopeptidase) was purified to homogeneity from bovine kidneys. The molecular mass of the purified enzyme was calculated to be 34000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of beta-mercaptoethanol. The enzyme rapidly hydrolyzed the substrate Z-Ala-Ala--MCA and was strongly inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide, p-chloromercuribenzene-sulfonic acid, Hg(2+) and Cu(2+). The amino acid sequence of the first 26 residues of the enzyme was Gly-Gly---Trp-Val-Val-Ile-Val-Ala-Gly-Ser--Gly-Gln-Tyr--Tyr-Arg--Gln-Ala--Ala-Asp--. This sequence is highly homologous to the sequences in the N-terminal of pig kidney legumain. We screened a bovine kidney cortex cDNA library using a DNA probe that originated from rat legumain, and we determined the bovine kidney cDNA structure and deduced the amino acid sequence. The cDNA is composed 1934 bp and encodes 433 amino acids in the coding region. The enzyme was strongly stained in the proximal tubules of the rat kidney in an immunohistochemical study. Vitamin D-binding protein which is known to be a ligand to megalin existing in the proximal tubules, was cleaved in a limited proteolytic manner by bovine kidney legumain. These results suggested that legumain contributes to the processing of macromolecules absorbed by proximal tubule cells. The enzyme also cleaved an N-terminal synthetic peptide of bovine annexin II (Gly(24)-Ser-Val--Ala-Tyr-Thr(30)---Asp-Ala-Glu(35)-Arg-Asp(37)) at a position between (31) and (32). The amino-terminal domain of annexin II has p11 subunit binding sites and phosphorylation sites for both pp60(src) and protein kinase C. This suggests that legumain plays an important role in inactivation and degradation of annexin II, which is abundant in the receptor-recycling compartments of endosomes/lysosomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9264026>Purification and some properties of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylases/oxygenases from Acinetobacter sp. strain JC1 and Hydrogenophaga pseudoflava.</a></h2><p>Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylases/oxygenases (RuBisCOs) of two carboxydobacteria, Acinetobacter sp. strain JC1 and Hydrogenophaga pseudoflava, grown on carbon monoxide were purified and partially characterized.

The final specific activity of the purified enzyme was 39.5 nmol CO2 incorporated per min per mg protein. The molecular weight of the native enzyme was determined to be 520,000. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis revealed two nonidentical subunits of molecular weights 53,500 and 15,000.

Compositional and sequence analyses of peptide I and proHRBP demonstrated that peptide I was a 26-residue peptide with the following sequence: NH2-Glu-Glu-Val--Asp-Asp-Thr-Asp-Val-Gly-Asp-Glu-Leu-Thr--Ala- Leu-Glu-Ser-Val-Leu-Thr-Asp---Asp-COOH. These results demonstrated that the pro-HRBP sequence predicted by nucleotide sequence analysis of a cDNA clone (24) was in fact synthesized in R3-R14 neurons. Hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity profiles of preproHRBP, combined with charge distribution profiles and predictive secondary structural analysis, showed that cleavage at dibasic sequences was strongly associated with peaks of hydrophilicity in alpha-helical regions of the preprohormone.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3667634>Isolation and characterization of a 60-kilodalton glycoprotein esterase from liver microsomal membranes.</a></h2><p>A glycoprotein having a subunit weight of approximately 60,000 was isolated from rabbit liver microsomes. It is a predominant component of the hepatic microsomal membrane and reacts rapidly with diisopropylphosphorofluoridate (DFP), resulting in the loss of enzymatic activity toward artificial substrates such as acyl esters of o-nitrophenols. Automated Edman degradation of this protein together with sequence analysis of peptides provided the NH2-terminal sequence of some 70 residues as follows: -Pro-Ser- Ala-Pro-Pro-Val-Val-Asp-Thr-Val--Gly--Val- Leu-Gly---Val-Ser-Leu-Glu-Gly--Ala-Gln- Pro-Val-Ala-Val--Leu-Gly-Val-Pro--Ala-- Pro-Pro-Leu-Gly-Ser-Leu-Arg--Ala-Pro-Pro-Gln- Pro-Ala-Glu-Ser-Trp-Ser--Val-- (CHO)- Thr-Thr-Ser-Tyr-Pro-Pro-Met-Cys-Ser-Ser. A carbohydrate attachment was identified at asparaginyl residue 61. The COOH-terminal peptide of the protein was isolated from two independent enzymatic digests, and its sequence was established as Arg-Glu-Thr-Glu--Ile-Glu-Leu. In order to isolate the DFP binding peptide, liver microsomes were labeled with [3H]DFP and the 60-kDa protein containing covalently bound DFP isolated in pure form. Following reduction and carboxymethylation, the DFP-labeled protein was fragmented with trypsin and the digest subjected to gel filtration. Digestion of the labeled peptide preparations with chymotrypsin followed by chromatography of the digest yielded two diisopropylphosphoryl (DIP) peptides. Automated Edman degradation of these peptides provided the following amino acid sequences: Gly-Glu-DIPSer- Ala-Gly-Gly-Gln-Ser-Val-Ser-Ile-Leu-Leu-Leu-Ser- Pro and Thr-Val-Ile-Gly-Asp-DIPHis-Gly-Asp-Glu-Ile-. The active site serine peptide of the 60-kDa protein shows some 70% similarity to the active center region of choline esterases. While the postulated active histidyl residue in choline esterases has not been identified, it is proposed that the DFP binding histidine of the 60-kDa protein corresponds to -438/440 of choline esterases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28844736>Structure and binding studies of proliferating cell nuclear antigen from Leishmania donovani.</a></h2><p>Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) acts as a sliding clamp to support DNA replication and repair. The structure of PCNA from Leishmania donovani (LdPCNA) has been determined at 2.73Å resolution. Structure consists of six crystallographically independent molecules which form two trimeric rings. The pore diameter of the individual trimeric ring is of the order of 37Å. The two rings are stacked through their front to front faces. In order to gain a stable packing, the rings are rotated by 42° about the pore axis and shifted by 7Å and tilted by 16° along the perpendicular direction to pore axis. This form of stacking reduced the effective diameter of the pore to 32Å. The sequence of LdPCNA consists of a long segment of 41 amino acid residues (186-Gly-Val-Ser-Asp-Arg-Ser-Thr--Ser-Glu-Val--Ala-Glu-Val--Ala-Glu-Ala-Arg-Asp-Asp-Asp-Glu-Glu-Pro-Leu-Ser-Arg--Tyr-Gly--Ala-Asp-Ser-Ser-Ala--Ala-Ile-226) whereas the corresponding segments in other PCNAs contain only eight residues corresponding to 186-Gly-Val-Ser-Asp-Arg------224--Ala-Ile-226. The enhanced length of this segment in LdPCNA may influence its mode of interaction with DNA and other proteins. The dissociation constants obtained using real time binding studies with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) for two peptides, -Arg-Arg-Gln-Thr-Ser-Met-Thr-Asp--Tyr- (P1) from human cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-1(CKI-1) and -Thr-Gln-Gly-Arg-Leu-Asp-Ser---Thr-Val (P2) from flap endonuclease 1 (Fen-1) as well as with two small molecule inhibitors, (S)-4-(4-(2-amino-3-hydroxypropyl)-2, 6-diiodophenoxy) phenol hydrochloride (ADPH) and N-(3-methylthiophene-2-carboxylicacid)-N'-((3-hydroxy-2-naphthalenyl) methylene) hydrazide (MCMH) are 0.29±0.09μM, 0.37±0.08μM, 0.35±0.09μM and 1.20±0.08μM respectively.

The molecular weight of the purified enzyme was calculated to be approx. 185,000 and 200,000 on Superdex 200 column chromatography and non-denatured PAGE, respectively, and to be 58,000 and 61,000 on SDS-PAGE in the absence and presence of beta-mercaptoethanol (beta-ME), respectively. These findings suggested that the enzyme is composed of three identical subunits. The enzyme rapidly hydrolyzed the substrates -Ala-MCA and Gly-Pro-MCA at acidic pH. The Km and V(max) values of DPP II at optimal pH (pH 6.0) were 1330 microM and 2.9 mumol/mg per min for Gly-Pro-MCA, and 360 microM and 1.43 mumol/mg per min for -Ala-MCA, respectively. It was strongly inhibited by diisopropylphosphofluoride (DFP), and moderately by 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF). These findings suggest that DPP II is a serine peptidase. Furthermore, the enzyme activity was also strongly inhibited by copper ions. The amino-acid sequence of the first 41 residues of the enzyme was determined as Ala1-Ser-Pro-Pro-Glu-Pro-Gly--Arg- Glu10-Val-Tyr--Glu-Gln-Leu-Leu-Asp--Phe20---Glu- Arg-- Gly---Thr-Phe30-Arg-Gln-Arg--Leu-Val-Ser-Asp--Phe40 -Trp.

The catalytically active enzyme is a heterodimer constituted by a large subunit (LdTopIL) containing a non-conserved N-terminal end and the phylogenetically conserved core domain, whereas the small subunit (LdTopIS) harbors the C-terminal domain with the characteristic tyrosine residue in the active site. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to substitute the basic amino acid (Arg-314, -352, Arg-410 and -453) of the LdTopIL subunit by the neutral amino acid alanine. The expression of these mutants in a topoisomerase-free yeast strain produced inactive proteins. Similarly, when the Tyr-222 from small subunit, involved in DNA cleavage, was substituted by  no topoisomerase activity was detected in yeast overexpressing extracts.

Among the digests, thermolysin digest showed the most potent inhibitory activity. Eight inhibitory peptides were isolated from the digest using HPLC. The amino acid sequences of inhibitory peptides were Ile--Pro-Leu--Tyr, Ile-Val-Gly-Arg-Pro-Arg--Gln-Gly, Ile-Trp---Thr, Ala-Leu-Pro--Ala, -Gln-Pro, Leu--Pro--Met, Ile-Tyr, and Asp-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Tyr-Pro.

Asp-Met-Ile-Pro-Ala-Gln- was obtained from the boiling water extract of dried bonito and this peptide was found in the primary structure of creatine kinase. Fragments of these peptides were prepared by further enzymatic digestion or chemical synthesis and their ACE-inhibitory activities were measured.

Since this peptide occurs naturally in the rodent brain, we determined its effect on appetite, an established central target of cannabinoid signaling. Hemopressin dose-dependently decreases night-time food intake in normal male rats and mice, as well as in obese ob/ob male mice, when administered centrally or systemically, without causing any obvious adverse side effects. The normal, behavioral satiety sequence is maintained in male mice fasted overnight, though refeeding is attenuated. The anorectic effect is absent in CB(1) receptor null mutant male mice, and hemopressin can block CB(1) agonist-induced hyperphagia in male rats, providing strong evidence for antagonism of the CB(1) receptor in vivo. We speculate that hemopressin may act as an endogenous functional antagonist at CB(1) receptors and modulate the activity of appetite  in the brain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8593051>Specificity of an extracellular proteinase from Brevibacterium linens ATCC 9174 on bovine alpha s1-casein.</a></h2><p>The specificity of the extracellular proteinase from Brevibacterium linens ATCC 9174 on bovine alpha s1-casein was studied.

Adding extra protein-bound or free AA to the diet may correct the reduced AA intake of HS pigs. However, extra protein-bound AA may further increase the body heat load, whereas extra free AA does not affect the heat load of HS pigs. Two experiments were conducted. In Exp. 1, the performance depression because of HS, compared with thermal neutrality, was determined with 30 pigs (31.1 ± 1.2 kg BW) fed diets with AA only as protein or as a mix of protein and free AA. Heat stress pigs consumed 18 to 25% less  and Thr than thermal neutral. In Exp. 2, the effect of extra dietary protein-bound or free AA on performance and serum concentration of AA in 25 HS pigs (33.6 ± 0.65 kg BW) was evaluated. Treatments were as follows: CON, wheat-soybean meal-free -Thr-Met diet; xP diet, 26% more protein than the CON diet; xAA diet, 24% or more of each AA than the recommended level. Pigs were fed ad libitum. Blood samples were collected between 1600 and 1700 h, when pigs were exposed to the highest ambient temperature (around 41.3 °C). Body temperature ranged daily from 39.9 to 41.1 °C. The performance data were reported already. Pigs fed the xP diet consumed more of all indispensable AA and dispensable AA than the CON pigs (P < 0.05), and more Arg, Ile, Asp, Glu, Gly, and Ser (P < 0.05) than the xAA pigs. Except for Arg, xAA pigs consumed more indispensable AA than the CON pigs (P < 0.05). Serum Arg, , , , Thr, Trp, and Val, was higher (P < 0.05) in xP than in CON pigs. Except for Ile serum, indispensable AA were higher in xAA than in CON pigs (P < 0.05). Serum Ile, Leu, Thr, and Val were higher (P < 0.05), and Met tended to be higher (P < 0.10) in xAA than in xP pigs. The difference of Ile, Leu, Met, Thr, and Val between the CON and the xAA pigs was larger than that between the CON and the xP pigs (P < 0.05). Serum  and Tyr were higher, and Cys and Glu were lower (P < 0.05) in xP than in CON pigs. Serum Cys tended to be lower in xAA than in CON pigs (P < 0.10). Asp and Glu were higher (P < 0.05) in xAA pigs than in xP pigs. In conclusion, these serum AA results combined with the reported performance data indicate that extra free AA in diets for HS pigs may help to correct the reduced AA availability and performance of HS pigs, although higher levels of specific AA such as Ile and Met might be needed.© The Author(s) 2019.

The lipase showed a pI of 5.3 on isoelectric focusing and a Mr of 29,000 +/- 1,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. With respect to substrate specificity, optimum chain length for acyl moiety varied depending on the type of reaction catalyzed: C18 in monomer lactone formation, C11 or shorter in dimer lactone formation, and C8 in ester hydrolysis. The amino-terminal 19 amino acid residues of the purified lipase were determined as Ser-Thr-Tyr-Thr-Gln-Thr--Tyr-Pro-Ile-Val-Leu-Ala--Gly-Met-Leu-Gly- , and the gene encoding the lipase was identified by hybridization to a synthetic 20-nucleotide probe, cloned, and sequenced. Nucleotide sequence analysis predicted a 311-amino acid open reading frame, a putative ribosome-binding site, and a 26-amino acid sequence at the amino terminus of the sequence that is not found in the mature protein. This 26-amino acid sequence has many of the characteristics common to known signal peptides. The lipase gene encoded a sequence of Val--Leu-Ile-Gly--Ser--Gly-Gly which is very well conserved among lipases, and showed 38-40% overall homology to the amino acid sequences of lipases from Pseudomonas fragie and Pseudomonas cepacia, but showed little homology to those of other lipases, suggesting that some structural features are required for catalyzing macrocyclic lactone synthesis in organic solvents and are restricted to lipases of the Pseudomonas origin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3878521>Region of peptide 125-147 of acetylcholine receptor alpha subunit is exposed at neuromuscular junction and induces experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis, T-cell immunity, and modulating autoantibodies.</a></h2><p>A major antigenic region of native nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AcChoR) has been identified by using a synthetic disulfide-looped peptide corresponding to alpha-subunit residues 125-147 of Torpedo electric organ AcChoR: -Ser-Tyr-Cys-Glu-Ile-Ile-Val-Thr--- Pro--Asp-Gln-Gln--Cys-Thr-Met--Leu-Gly.

Anti-peptide antibodies were more reactive with native than denatured AcChoR and bound to the alpha subunit. Some reacted exclusively with mammalian muscle AcChoR, some induced modulation of AcChoR on cultured myotubes, but none inhibited binding of alpha-bungarotoxin to solubilized or membrane-associated AcChoR. Repeated immunization induced experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis: clinical signs in one rat and electrophysiologic and/or biochemical signs in 10 of 11 rats. Thus, at least part of the corresponding region of the mammalian AcChoR alpha subunit is extracellular at the neuromuscular junction and a potential target for pathogenic autoantibodies in patients with acquired myasthenia gravis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1390778>Postbinding characterization of five naturally occurring mutations in the human insulin receptor gene: impaired insulin-stimulated c-jun expression and thymidine incorporation despite normal receptor autophosphorylation.</a></h2><p>Some patients with extreme insulin resistance have mutations in their insulin receptor gene. We previously identified five such mutations located in the extracellular domain of the insulin receptor (-->Lys15, -->Arg209, -->Val382, -->Glu460, and -->Ser462) and studied the effects of these mutations upon posttranslational processing, insulin binding, and tyrosine autophosphorylation. We now characterize the ability of these mutant receptors to mediate biological actions of insulin in transfected NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. All cell lines expressing mutant receptors showed marked impairment in insulin-stimulated c-jun expression and thymidine incorporation when compared with cells expressing wild-type human insulin receptors. The most severe impairment was seen in cells expressing the Val382 mutant (a mutation which causes an intrinsic defect in receptor autophosphorylation). These cells had insulin responses similar to the untransfected cells (used as a negative control). In contrast, cells expressing the Lys15 mutant have the ability to achieve a normal level of maximal autophosphorylation but require an abnormally high concentration of insulin to do so (as the result of decreased insulin binding affinity). These cells show a higher basal rate and much lower insulin stimulation of both c-jun expression and thymidine incorporation when compared with the cells expressing the wild-type human insulin receptors. This pattern is also seen in the cells expressing the other mutants with normal autophosphorylation (Arg209, Glu460, and Ser462). Although the most severe defects in insulin action are seen with the mutation which has an intrinsic defect in receptor autophosphorylation, the ability to undergo normal autophosphorylation does not seem to preclude mutations from impairing the ability of receptors to mediate some of the actions of insulin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23365313>Effects of dietary supplementation with a protease on the apparent ileal digestibility of the weaned piglet.</a></h2><p>The effects of an acid-stable protease (RONOZYME ProAct) supplemented to a corn (Zea mays)-soybean (Glycine max) meal-based diet on apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of nutrients were evaluated in 120 weaned piglets (28 d old; 8.17 ± 0.90 kg).

The ileal content was collected for the digestibility determination after euthanasia of 35 piglets of each group after 14 d of study and 25 piglets of each group after 29 d. Compared to group Std, AID of CP was increased (P < 0.05) after 29 d of treatment in group ProA. The AID of the indispensable AA, Met + Cys, and branched-chain AA was increased (P < 0.05) at the end of the study.

Sites 44 and 131 in bacteriophage T4 lysozyme.</a></h2><p>To determine the effects of different amino acids on the structure and stability of an alpha-helix in the context of a globular protein, all 19 naturally-occurring amino acids were substituted for Ser44 in phage T4 lysozyme. A more restricted set of nine replacements was also made for Val131. Ser44 and Val131 are two of a very limited number of possible sites in T4 lysozyme that are well within alpha-helices, are solvent-exposed and relatively free of interactions with neighboring residues, and are not involved in crystal contacts. High resolution structures for the majority of the mutants, some of which crystallized non-isomorphously with wild-type, were determined. With the exception of proline, the amino acid substitutions caused little if any perturbation of the alpha-helix backbone. Also the beta-branched residues Thr, Val and Ile show no indication of either side-chain or backbone distortion. Therefore, other than proline, there is no evidence that differences in helix propensities are associated with different amounts of strain introduced into the helix. For reference, and also to allow estimates of side-chain entropy, a survey was made of side-chain conformations in 100 well-refined protein structures. As noted previously all side-chains within alpha-helices strongly avoid the g- conformation (chi 1 approximately 60 degrees). This restricts the beta-branched residues Thr, Val and Ile to a single conformer (g+, chi 1 approximately -60 degrees). Asp, , Met and Ser within helices also overwhelmingly prefer the g+ conformation. For Arg, Cys, Gln, Glu, Leu and  the t (chi 1 approximately 180 degrees) and g+ conformers are populated roughly equally. Only the aromatic residues, , Tyr, Trp and  prefer the t conformation. These preferences are the same whether the side-chain is buried or solvent-exposed. In general, the side-chain conformations adopted by the residues substituted at positions 44 and 131 correspond to the most commonly observed conformation for the same amino acid in helices in known protein structures. The changes in protein stability for the replacements at site 131 in general agree well with those at site 44 (correlation r = 0.97), suggesting that these may be representative of substitutions at fully solvent-exposed sites in the middle of alpha-helices. The free energy values also agree quite well with those observed for equivalent replacements in a number of soluble alpha-helical model peptides and with data from "host-guest" studies and statistical surveys (r = 0.69 to 0.93).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16829127>Revising the proton affinity scale of the naturally occurring alpha-amino acids.</a></h2><p>The proton affinities (PA) of the 20 naturally occurring alpha-amino acids (AA) have been determined computationally by means of density functional theory (DFT) and high-level G2(MP2) calculations.

The sequences of the ftsI gene encoding the transpeptidase domain of PBP 3A and/or PBP 3B and of the dacB gene encoding PBP 4 were determined for these strains and compared to those of AMP-susceptible Rd strains. The BLNAR strains were classified into three groups on the basis of deduced amino acid substitutions in the ftsI gene, which is thought to be involved in septal peptidoglycan synthesis. -517, near the conserved -Thr-Gly (KTG) motif, was substituted for Arg-517 in group I strains (n = 9), and -526 was substituted for -526 in group II strains (n = 12). In group III strains (n = 4), three residues (Met-377, Ser-385, and Leu-389), positioned near the conserved Ser-Ser- (SSN) motif, were replaced with Ile, Thr, and , respectively, in addition to the replacement with -526. The MICs of cephem antibiotics with relatively high affinities for PBP 3A and PBP 3B were higher than those of AMP and meropenem for group III strains. The MICs of beta-lactams for H. influenzae transformants into which the ftsI gene from BLNAR strains was introduced were as high as those for the donors, and PBP 3A and PBP 3B showed decreased affinities for beta-lactams. There was no clear relationship between 7-bp deletions in the dacB gene and AMP susceptibility. Even though mutations in another gene(s) may be involved in beta-lactam resistance, these data indicate that mutations in the ftsI gene are the most important for development of resistance to beta-lactams in BLNAR strains.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15356277>Integrating the universal  into a phylogenetic analysis.</a></h2><p>The darwinian concept of "descent with modification" applies to  :  sharing similarities must have inherited them from an exclusive, hypothetical ancestral pathway. Comparative anatomy of biochemical  is performed using five criteria of homology. Primary homologies of "type I" were defined as several  sharing the same enzyme with high specificity for its substrate. Primary homologies of "type II" were defined as the sharing of similar enzymatic functions, cofactors, functional family, or recurrence of a set of reactions. Standard cladistic analysis is used to infer the evolutionary history of  development and the relative ordering of biochemical reactions through time, from a single matrix integrating the whole basic universal . The cladogram shows that the earliest  to emerge are  of amino acids of groups I and II (Asp, , Glu, and Gln). The earliest enzymatic functions are mostly linked to amino acid catabolism: deamination, transamination, and decarboxylation. For some amino acids, catabolism and biosynthesis occur at the same time (Asp, Glu, , and Met). Catabolism precedes anabolism for , Gln, Arg, Trp, , Tyr, and , and anabolism precedes catabolism for Pro, Ala, Leu, Val, Ile, Cys, Gly, Ser, and Thr. The urea cycle evolves from arginine synthesis.  of fatty acids and sugars develops after the full development of  of amino acids of groups I and II, and they are associated with the anabolism of amino acids of groups III and IV. Syntheses of aromatic amino acids are branched within sugar . The Krebs cycle occurs relatively late after the setting of  of amino acids of groups I and II. One portion of the Krebs cycle has a catabolic origin, whereas the other portion has an anabolic origin in  of amino acids of groups III and IV. It is not possible to order glycolysis and gluconeogenesis with regard to the Krebs cycle, as they all belong to "period 6." Pentose-phosphate and Calvin cycles are later (periods 7 and 8, respectively).

Jararafibrase I and jararafibrase II had single-chain protein compositions, and the amino acid sequence up to the 49th amino acid from the NH2-terminal of jararafibrase II was: Leu-Pro-Glu--Gln-Arg-Tyr-Ile-Glu-Leu--Ile-Val-Val-Asp--Gly-Met- -Met--Tyr--Gly--Ser-Asp--Ile-Arg-Arg-Arg-Ile--Gln- Met-Val--Ile-Met--X-Ala-Tyr-Arg-Tyr-Leu-Tyr-Ile-(X = not confirmed).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7814706>Effect of graded levels of duodenal infusions of casein on mammary uptake in lactating cows. 2. Individual amino acids.</a></h2><p>The experiment examined patterns of mammary uptake of individual AA when graded amounts of calcium caseinate (0, 177, 362, and 762 g/d) were infused duodenally into four lactating cows. Six blood samples were collected over 12 h from the subcutaneous abdominal vein and the carotid. Mammary blood flow was measured by an ultrasonic flow probe implanted around the external pudic artery. Infusions of casein linearly increased the arterial concentrations of all essential AA and several nonessential AA (Pro, Tyr, Orn, and Cit) and increased, or tended to increase, linearly the mammary arteriovenous differences of all AA except Glu and Ala. Absorption ability of the mammary gland was not reduced in vivo. Relationships between mammary arteriovenous differences and arterial concentrations were positive and linear in every cow for all AA except , Ser, Gly, and Ala. Some essential AA (, Arg, and branched-chain AA) were therefore taken up in excess of their output into milk proteins, but others (, Thr, Met, and ) were almost exclusively extracted by the udder in a direct ratio to their output.

One of the yeast ACE inhibitors, YG-3, was GAPDH peptide 79-89 (Pro-Ala--Leu-Pro-Trp-Gly-Ser-Ser--Val, IC50:18 microM), and contained the sequence homologous to vertebrate ACE inhibitors (GAPDH peptides 79-86 or 81-88).

The (human) MBP epitope for MS anti-MBP is: Pro85-Val-Val------Ile-Val-Thr-Pro96. In phase one clinical research, synthetic peptides (p) containing this epitope, namely pMBP86-95 and/or pMBP82-98, were intrathecally administered to MS patients with monosymptomatic or polysymptomatic relapses to determine the dosage, frequency and duration of administration which will immediately neutralize F circulating CSF anti-MBP. Patients with monosymptomatic relapses required 50 mg of peptide administered daily for 4-5 days. In patients with polysymptomatic relapses, F anti-MBP can be neutralized with dosages between 50 mg peptide daily for 4 days up to 100 mg twice a day for 2 days; however due to the prolonged nature of polysymptomatic relapses, antibody neutralization could not be maintained by these short courses of intrathecal peptide administration.

Three types of regions were present in the hydrophobic core of both proteins: stabilizing clusters and destabilizing clusters, defined as three or more consecutive core residues of either stabilizing (Leu, Ile, Val, Met, , and Tyr) or destabilizing (Gly, Ala, Cys, Ser, Thr, , Gln, Asp, Glu, , Arg, , and Trp) residues, and intervening regions that consist of both stabilizing and destabilizing residues in the hydrophobic core but no clusters. Subsequently, we designed a series of two-stranded coiled-coils to determine what defines a destabilizing cluster and varied the length of the destabilizing cluster from 3 to 7 residues to determine the length effect of the destabilizing cluster on protein stability. The results showed a dramatic destabilization, caused by a single Leu to Ala substitution, on formation of a 3-residue destabilizing cluster (DeltaT(m) of 17-21 degrees C) regardless of the stability of the coiled-coil. Any further substitution of Leu to Ala that increased the size of the destabilizing cluster to 5 or 7 hydrophobic core residues in length had little effect on stability (DeltaT(m) of 1.4-2.8 degrees C). These results suggested that the contribution of Leu to protein stability is context-dependent on whether the hydrophobe is in a stabilizing cluster or its proximity to neighboring destabilizing and stabilizing clusters.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1985958>Leukocyte chemoattractant peptides from the serpin heparin cofactor II.</a></h2><p>Heparin cofactor II (HC) is a plasma serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) that inhibits the coagulant proteinase alpha-thrombin. We have recently demonstrated that proteolysis of HC by catalytic amounts of polymorphonuclear leukocyte proteinases (elastase or cathepsin G) generates leukocyte chemotaxins (Hoffman, M., Pratt, C. W., Brown, R. L., and Church, F. C. (1989) Blood 73, 1682-1685). One of four peptides produced when HC is degraded by neutrophil elastase has chemotactic activity for both monocytes and neutrophils with maximal migration comparable to formyl-Met-Leu-, the "gold standard" bacterially derived chemotaxin. The amino-terminal sequence of this HC peptide is Asp----Glu--Thr-Val-... and the peptide corresponds to Asp-39 to Ile-66 of HC. A variety of synthetic peptides derived from this sequence were evaluated for leukocyte migration activity, and a dodecapeptide from Asp-49 to Tyr-60 (Asp-Trp-Ile-Pro-Glu-Gly-Glu-Glu-Asp-Asp-Asp-Tyr) was identified as the active site for leukocyte chemotactic action. The 12-mer synthetic peptide possesses significant neutrophil chemotactic action at 1 nM (60% of the maximal activity of formyl-Met-Leu-), while a peptide with the reverse sequence has essentially no chemotactic activity. Cross-desensitization experiments also show that pretreatment of neutrophils with a 19-mer peptide (-48 to Ile-66) greatly reduces subsequent chemotaxis to HC-neutrophil elastase proteolysis reaction products. When injected intraperitoneally in mice, the HC-neutrophil elastase digest elicits neutrophil migration. Our results demonstrate that not only does HC function as a thrombin inhibitor, but that limited proteolysis of HC near the amino terminus yields biologically active peptide(s) which might participate in inflammation and in wound healing and tissue repair processes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22588483>Structure-based statistical analysis of transmembrane helices.</a></h2><p>Recent advances in determination of the high-resolution structure of membrane proteins now enable analysis of the main features of amino acids in transmembrane (TM) segments in comparison with amino acids in water-soluble helices. In this work, we conducted a large-scale analysis of the prevalent locations of amino acids by using a data set of 170 structures of integral membrane proteins obtained from the MPtopo database and 930 structures of water-soluble helical proteins obtained from the protein data bank. Large hydrophobic amino acids (Leu, Val, Ile, and ) plus Gly were clearly prevalent in TM helices whereas polar amino acids (Glu, , Asp, Arg, and Gln) were less frequent in this type of helix. The distribution of amino acids along TM helices was also examined. As expected, hydrophobic and slightly polar amino acids are commonly found in the hydrophobic core of the membrane whereas aromatic (Trp and Tyr), Pro, and the hydrophilic amino acids (, , and Gln) occur more frequently in the interface regions. Charged amino acids are also statistically prevalent outside the hydrophobic core of the membrane, and whereas acidic amino acids are frequently found at both cytoplasmic and extra-cytoplasmic interfaces, basic amino acids cluster at the cytoplasmic interface. These results strongly support the experimentally demonstrated biased distribution of positively charged amino acids (that is, the so-called the positive-inside rule) with structural data.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9350978>Purification and characterization of islet hormones (insulin, glucagon, pancreatic, polypeptide and somatostatin) from the Burmese python, Python molurus.</a></h2><p>Insulin was purified from an extract of the pancreas of the Burmese python, Python molurus (Squamata:Serpentes) and its primary structure established as: A Chain: Gly-Ile-Val-Glu-Gln-Cys-Cys-Glu--Thr10-Cys-Ser-Leu-Tyr-Glu-Leu- Glu--Tyr-Cys20-.

We now show that an analogous single-residue code (the N-end rule) operates in an in vitro system derived from mammalian reticulocytes. We also show that the N-end rule has a hierarchical structure. Specifically, amino-terminal Glu and Asp (and also Cys in reticulocytes) are secondary destabilizing residues in that they are destabilizing through their ability to be conjugated to primary destabilizing residues such as Arg. Amino-terminal Gln and  are tertiary destabilizing residues in that they are destabilizing through their ability to be converted, via selective deamidation, into secondary destabilizing residues Glu and Asp. Furthermore, in reticulocytes, distinct types of the N-end-recognizing activity are shown to be specific for three classes of primary destabilizing residues: basic (Arg, , ), bulky hydrophobic (, Leu, Trp, Tyr), and small uncharged (Ala, Ser, Thr). Features of the N-end rule in reticulocytes suggest that the exact form of the N-end rule may depend on the cell's physiological state, thereby providing a mechanism for selective destruction of preexisting proteins upon cell differentiation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8374065>Three stages in the evolution of the genetic code.</a></h2><p>A diversification of the genetic code based on the number of codons available for the proteinous amino acids is established. Three groups of amino acids during evolution of the code are distinguished. On the basis of their chemical complexity those amino acids emerging later in a translation process are derived. Codon number and chemical complexity indicate that , , Tyr, Cys and either  or  were introduced in the second stage, whereas the number of codons alone gives evidence that Trp and Met were introduced in the third stage. The amino acids of stage 1 use purine-rich codons, while all the amino acids introduced in the second stage, in contrast, use pyrimidines in the third position of their codons. A low abundance of pyrimidines during early translation is derived. This assumption is supported by experiments on non-enzymatic replication and interactions of hairpin loops with a complementary strand. A back extrapolation concludes a high purine content of the first nucleic acids, which gradually decreased during their evolution. Amino acids independently available from prebiotic synthesis were thus correlated to purine-rich codons. Implications on the prebiotic replication are discussed also in the light of recent codon usage data.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2769267>Isolation and characterization of a rat brain triakontatetraneuropeptide, a posttranslational product of diazepam binding inhibitor: specific action at the Ro 5-4864 recognition site.</a></h2><p>This report describes the purification and characterization from rat brain of triakontatetraneuropeptide (TTN, DBI 17-50), a major biologically active processing product of diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI). Brain TTN was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography with polyclonal octadecaneuropeptide, DBI 33-50) antibodies coupled to CNBr-Sepharose 4B followed by two reverse-phase HPLC steps.

Twenty-four barrows (37.0 +/- 1.5 kg of BW) were fed 1 of 4 diets for 24 d: 16.1% CP with no CAA, or 12.8, 10.1, or 7.8% CP (analyzed values, as-fed) containing CAA. As CP decreased, CAA were gradually increased to meet requirements on a true ileal digestible basis. Pigs were euthanized 2 h postmeal on d 24, and mucosal samples from duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were collected. Reducing dietary CP decreased ADG, G:F, and final weight (linear, P < 0.05). With reduced dietary CP, mucosal protein concentration decreased in the jejunum (quadratic, P < 0.05) and tended to decrease in the ileum (linear, P = 0.062). Reduction of the dietary CP concentration from 16.1 to 7.8% tended to decrease the crypt depth (linear, P < 0.10) and decreased villus width (linear, P < 0.05) in duodenum and jejunum mucosa but did not reduce villus height or villus surface area in any regions of the small intestine. In the duodenum, a reduction in dietary CP increased free , Met, and Thr (linear, P < 0.05) and peptide-bound  and Thr (quadratic, P < 0.10).

The primary structures of rat and bovine Gals were derived from the cDNA sequences of their precursors. To elucidate the structure of human Gal (hGal), we extracted 280 postmortem pituitaries in trifluoroacetic acid and purified hGal binding activity, by three successive HPLC steps, to homogeneity based on a radioreceptor assay. The primary structure of hGal was determined by automatic Edman degradation to be Gly-Trp-Thr-Leu--Ser-Ala-Gly-Tyr-Leu-Leu- Gly-Pro--Ala-Val-Gly---Arg-Ser--Ser-Asp---Gly-Leu-Thr- Ser-COOH. The structure was confirmed by plasma desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry, revealing a mass of 3156.1. Compared to the 29-residue porcine, rat, and bovine Gals, hGal uniquely comprises 30 amino acids possessing an additional nonamidated serine residue as C terminus.

Glycerol induces heme coordination changes in some of the CCP mutants at room temperature. It apparently weakens the binding of the Fe atom to ligands in the distal heme cavity and drives the heme toward the 5-coordinate, high-spin state. At 10 K, native CCP and all the mutants (except -51 which remains 6-coordinate, high-spin) show various distributions of spin and coordination states which differ from those observed at 295 K. Upon cooling in phosphate buffer, pH 7, and to a much lesser extent in 66% glycerol/phosphate, an internal strong-field ligand is coordinated to the Fe. A likely candidate is H2O-595, which could become a strong-field ligand on H-bonding and/or proton transfer to H2O-648, and/or the distal -52. However, distal -52 itself cannot be ruled out as the coordinating ligand considering that the -51 mutant, which binds H2O-595 at room temperature, does not show a large 6-coordinate, low-spin component at 10 K like the other mutants.

Combining biochemical and amino acid variation data with multiple species sequence alignments, structural models, and docking site predictions allows for visualization of how angiotensin peptides may bind and activate the receptors; allowing identification of conserved and variant mechanisms in the receptors. MAS differs from AT1 favoring Ang-(1-7) and not Ang II binding, while AT2 recently has been suggested to preferentially bind Ang III. A new model of Ang peptide binding to AT1 and AT2 is proposed that correlates data from site directed mutagenesis and photolabled experiments that were previously considered conflicting. Ang II binds AT1 and AT2 through a conserved initial binding mode involving amino acids 111 (consensus 325) of AT1 () interacting with Tyr (4) of Ang II and 199 and 256 (consensus 512 and 621, a  and  respectively) interacting with  (8) of Ang II. In MAS these sites are not conserved, leading to differential binding and activation by Ang-(1-7). In both AT1 and AT2, the Ang II peptide may internalize through  (8) of Ang II propagating through the receptors' conserved aromatic amino acids to the final photolabled positioning relative to either AT1 (amino acid 294, , consensus 725) or AT2 (138, Leu, consensus 336). Understanding receptor activation provides valuable information for drug design and identification of other receptors that can potentially bind Ang peptides.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1475012>Isolation and characterization of hypothalamic growth-hormone releasing factor from common carp, Cyprinus carpio.</a></h2><p>A growth hormone-releasing factor (GRF)-like peptide was isolated from the hypothalamus of common carp, Cyprinus carpio, by acid extraction, gel filtration chromatography, immunoaffinity chromatography using antiserum directed against rat GRF, and multiple steps of HPLC using octadecyl columns. Based on Edman degradation and peptide mapping, this teleost GRF was established to be a 45-residue peptide with the following primary structure: -Ala-Asp-Gly-Met----Ala-Tyr-Arg--Ala-Leu-Gly-Gln-Leu-Ser- Ala-Arg - -Tyr-Leu--Thr-Leu-Met-Ala--Arg-Val-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser-Met-Ile-Glu- Asp-Asp--Glu-Pro-Leu-Ser. Carp GRF is closely related structurally to peptides of the glucagon-secretin superfamily, and more particularly to mammalian vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) precursors and the N-terminal portion of mammalian GRFs. A synthetic replicate of this peptide is highly potent [50% effective dose (ED50) approximately 0.08 nM] in stimulating GH release from cultured goldfish pituitary glands and in elevating serum GH levels 30 min after injection (0.1 micrograms/g) in goldfish.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9063869>Structural analysis of the H166G site-directed mutant of galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase complexed with either UDP-glucose or UDP-galactose: detailed description of the nucleotide sugar binding site.</a></h2><p>Galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase plays a key role in galactose  by catalyzing the transfer of a uridine 5'-phosphoryl group from UDP-glucose to galactose 1-phosphate. The enzyme from Escherichia coli is composed of two identical subunits. The structures of the enzyme/UDP-glucose and UDP-galactose complexes, in which the catalytic nucleophile  166 has been replaced with a glycine residue, have been determined and refined to 1.8 A resolution by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Crystals employed in the investigation belonged to the space group P2(1) with unit cell dimensions of a = 68 A, b = 58 A, c = 189 A, and beta = 100 degrees and two dimers in the asymmetric unit. The models for these enzyme/substrate complexes have demonstrated that the active site of the uridylyltransferase is formed by amino acid residues contributed from both subunits in the dimer. Those amino acid residues critically involved in sugar binding include  153 and Gly 159 from the first subunit and  311,  312, Val 314, Tyr 316, Glu 317, and Gln 323 from the second subunit. The uridylyltransferase is able to accommodate both UDP-galactose and UDP-glucose substrates by simple movements of the side chains of Glu 317 and Gln 323 and by a change in the backbone dihedral angles of Val 314. The removal of the imidazole group at position 166 results in little structural perturbation of the polypeptide chain backbone when compared to the previously determined structure for the wild-type enzyme. Instead, the cavity created by the mutation is partially compensated for by the presence of a potassium ion and its accompanying coordination sphere. As such, the mutant protein structures presented here represent valid models for understanding substrate recognition and binding in the native galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11003134>Treatment of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced by guinea pig myelin basic protein epitope 72-85 with a human MBP(87-99) analogue and effects of cyclic peptides.</a></h2><p>Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an inflammatory and demyelinating disease of the central nervous system and is an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). In the present report, a linear analogue and a series of cyclic semi-mimetic peptides were designed and synthesized based on the human myelin basic protein (MBP(87-99)) epitope (Val87------Ile-Val-Thr-Pro-Arg-Thr-Pro90) and on Copolymer I (a mixture of random polymers of Ala, Gln,  and Tyr used to treat MS). These analogues were designed looking for suppressors of EAE induced by guinea pig MBP(72-85) epitope (Gln--Ser-Gln-Arg-Ser-Gln-Asp-Glu--Pro-Val) in Lewis rats. The linear analogue [Arg91,Ala96]MBP(87-99), in which Arg substitutes Lys91 and Ala substitutes Pro96, was found to be a strong inhibitor which when administered to Lewis rats together with the encephalitogenic agonist MBP(72-85) completely prevented the induction of EAE. In contrast, three N- and C-termini amide-linked cyclic semi-mimetic peptides, [cyclo--Arg--Ile-Val-Thr-Ala-Acp (1), cyclo--Ala-Arg-Gln-Acp (2), cyclo-Tyr-Ala--Gln-Acp (3)] as well as a  side chain and C-terminous cyclic semi mimetic peptide cyclo(, Acp)----Ile-Val-Thr-Ala-Acp (4) which contain segments of MBP(87-99) or are constituted from immunophoric residues of copolymer 1, were ineffective in inducing or inhibiting EAE in Lewis rats. However co-injection of cyclic analogues with MBP(72-85) delayed the onset of EAE indicating a modulatory effect on the EAE activity of MBP(72-85). These findings suggest that molecule length, size of cyclic moiety and backbone conformation are important elements for immunogenic activity. Moreover blockade of MBP(72-85) induced EAE by the unrelated peptide [Arg91,Ala56]MBP(87-99) could indicate that the mechanism of inhibition is not due to binding competition but rather due to the delivery of a negative signal by the antagonist which overcomes the agonist response possibly through the activation of antigen specific regulatory T cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2684275>Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate dependent histidine decarboxylase: overproduction, purification, biosynthesis of soluble site-directed mutant proteins, and replacement of conserved residues.</a></h2><p>The hdc gene coding for the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate dependent histidine decarboxylase from Morganella morganii has been expressed in Escherichia coli under control of the lac promoter. The enzyme accumulates to 7-8% of total cell protein and is purified to homogeneity by passage through three columns. Fourteen site-directed mutant enzymes were constructed to explore the roles of residues of interest, especially those in the sequence Ser229-X230-His231-N epsilon-(phosphopyridoxylidene)Lys232, since identical sequences also appear in several other decarboxylases. Most of the overproduced mutant proteins were aggregated into inclusion bodies, but when the late log phase cultures were cooled from 37 to 25 degrees C before induction, the mutant proteins were obtained as soluble products. Ala or Cys in place of Ser-229 yielded mutant enzymes about 7% as active as wild-type, indicating that this serine residue is not essential for catalysis but contributes to activity through conformational or other effects. Of the replacements made for -231 (, Gln, , and Arg), only Gln and  gave partially active enzymes (about 12% and 0.2% of wild-type, respectively). The side-chain amide of Gln may act by mimicking the positionally equivalent tau-nitrogen on the imidazole ring of histidine to provide an interaction (e.g., a hydrogen bond) required for efficient catalysis. The -232 residue that interacts with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate appears central to catalytic efficiency since replacing it with Ala yields a mutant protein that is virtually inactive but retains the ability to bind both pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and histidine efficiently.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2643514>Isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase from baker's yeast. Discrimination of 20 amino acids in aminoacylation of tRNA(Ile)-C-C-3'dA; role of terminal hydroxyl groups aminoacylation of tRNA(Ile)-C-C-A.</a></h2><p>Specificity with regard to amino acids in aminoacylation of tRNA(Ile)-C-C-3'dA by isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase is characterized by discrimination factors (D2) which are calculated from kcat and Km values. The lowest values are observed for Cys, Val, , and Trp (D2 = 180-1700), indicating that at same amino acid concentrations isoleucine is 180-1700 times more attached to tRNA(Ile)-C-C-3'dA. The highest values are observed for Gly, Ala, Ser, Pro, Gln, Leu, Glu, and  (D2 = 10,000-30,000). D2 values of the other amino acids are in the range of 2000-10,000. Recognition of most amino acids is achieved in a four-step process. Two initial discrimination steps are due to different hydrophobic interactions with the binding pockets; two proof-reading steps occur on the pre- and the post-transfer stage. For nine amino acids (Ser, Asp, , Val, Leu, , , , Trp) post-transfer proof-reading is negligible. As a special case in discrimination of valine, one initial discrimination step and the post-transfer proof-reading step are lacking. The role of the terminal hydroxyl groups of the tRNA for post-transfer proof-reading is assigned to a simple neighbouring group effect. No preference for the 2' or 3' position in proof-reading can be postulated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1725302>Separation and purification of 34- and 52-kDa species of bovine lung endothelin receptors and identification of the 34-kDa species as a degradation product.</a></h2><p>We solubilized bovine lung endothelin receptors in a nonaggregated state and identified 34- and 52-kDa species of endothelin receptor by affinity labeling. The ratio of 34-kDa species to 52-kDa species varied widely from sample to sample, suggesting that the 34-kDa species is a proteolytic product; we therefore examined the effect of various proteinase inhibitors and found that EDTA (greater than 50 mM) was very effective in preventing the conversion. These results indicate that the lower Mr species arose from the 52-kDa receptor as a result of limited proteolysis by metal proteinase(s). The resulting 34-kDa species had endothelin-binding activity, was very stable, and was not processed further even in the absence of proteinase inhibitors. We therefore first tried to purify the 34-kDa species by affinity chromatography. Bovine lung extracts were mixed with biotinylated endothelin and the ligand-receptor complexes formed were isolated with avidin-agarose. Starting from 3.5 kg of bovine lung, approximately 200 micrograms of the pure receptor was obtained.

The 3-step purification procedure included: a) dialysis against 5mM NH4-acetate, pH 5.5, in which PLA2 precipitated with euglobulins, followed by extraction with 0.4 M NaCl/0.05 M NH4-acetate, pH 5, b) chromatography on CM-cellulose, c) preparative gel electrophoresis in the presence of 0.1% Na-dodecyl sulfate and electroelution of the band containing the enzyme. Automated sequence analysis has indicated that the protein is pure, with the following NH2-terminal sequence: -Leu-Val----Arg-Met-Ile--Leu-Thr-Thr-. A computer search revealed that all proteins with greater than 75% analogies in NH2-terminal sequences were PLA2's from various snake venoms. When PLA2 was purified from human placental membranes and analyzed, it was found to contain an identical sequence of 13 residues from the NH2-terminus.

By utilizing a specific radioimmunoassay for neuromedin B, we have isolated two novel "big" neuromedin B, designated neuromedin B-32 and B-30, from pig brain and spinal cord, both of which were identified as N-terminally extended forms of neuromedin B.

Using nerve growth factor (NGF)-differentiated PC12 cells, the effects of ET-1 on K(+)-stimulated release of ATP, dopamine (DA), and neuropeptide Y (NPY) were quantified using high-pressure liquid chromatography or radioimmunoassay. ET-1, in a concentration-dependent manner, inhibited the release of ATP, but not DA and NPY. Preincubation with the ET(A/B) antagonist, PD 142893 (N-acetyl-beta-phenyl-D--Leu-Asp-Ile-Ile-Trp), reversed the inhibitory effect of ET-1 on ATP release, which remained unaffected in the presence of the ET(A)-specific antagonist BQ123 [cyclo(D-Asp-Pro-D-Val-Leu-D-Trp)]. The ET(B) agonists, sarafotoxin 6c (Cys-Thr-Cys--Asp-Met-Thr-Asp-Glu-Glu-Cys-Leu---Cys--Gln-Asp-Val-Ile-Trp), BQ 3020 (N-acetyl-[Ala(11,15)]-endothelin 1 fragment 6-21Ac-Leu-Met-Asp--Glu-Ala-Val-Tyr--Ala--Leu-Asp-IIe-IIe-Trp), and IRL 1620 (N-succinyl-[Glu(9), Ala(11,15)]-endothelin 1 fragment 8-21Suc-Asp-Glu-Glu-Ala-Val-Tyr--Ala--Leu-Asp-Ile-Ile-Trp), decreased K(+)-stimulated release of ATP in a dose-dependent manner, and this effect was reversed by the ET(B) antagonists RES 701-1 [cyclic (Gly1-Asp9) (Gly--Trp--Gly-Thr-Ala-Pro-Asp-Trp----Tyr-Tyr-Trp)] and BQ 788 (N-[N-[N-[(2,6-dimethyl-1-piperidinyl)carbonyl]-4-methyl-l-leucyl]-1-(methoxycarbonyl)-D-tryptophyl]-D-norleucine sodium salt). Preincubation of PC12 cells with pertussis toxin reversed the ET-1-induced inhibition of the K(+)-evoked ATP release. Real-time intracellular calcium level recordings were performed on PC-12 cell suspensions, and ET-1 induced a dose-dependent decrease in the K(+)-evoked calcium levels. Nifedipine, the L-type voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channel antagonist, caused inhibition of the K(+)-stimulated ATP release, but the N-type Ca(2+) channel antagonist, omega-conotoxin GVIA, did not reverse the effect on ATP release. These data suggest that ET-1 modulates the release of ATP via the ET(B) receptor and its associated G(i/o) G-protein through attenuation of the influx of extracellular Ca(2+) through L-type channels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6386798>The primary structure of human liver manganese superoxide dismutase.</a></h2><p>The complete amino acid sequence of manganese superoxide dismutase from human liver was determined.

The structure of exendin-3 was analyzed by amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry. Exendin-3 is a 39-amino acid peptide with a mass of 4200. It contains a carboxyl-terminal amide and has a strong homology with secretin at its amino-terminal 12 amino acids.

The new thiourea derivatives showed strong affinities toward isozymes I, II, and IV of carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1). In vitro inhibitory power was good (in the low-nanomolar range) for the derivatives of beta-phenylserine and alpha-phenylglycine, for those incorporating hydroxy and mercapto amino acids (Ser, Thr, Cys, Met), hydrophobic amino acids (Val, Leu, Ile), aromatic amino acids (, , Trp, Tyr, DOPA), and dicarboxylic amino acids as well as di/tri/tetrapeptides among others. Such CA inhibitors displayed very good water solubility (in the range of 2-3%) mainly as sodium (carboxylate) salts, with pH values of the obtained solutions being 6.5-7.0. Some of these preparations (such as the derivatives of Ser, beta-Ph-Ser, Leu, , etc.) strongly lowered intraocular pressure (IOP) when applied topically, directly into the normotensive/glaucomatous rabbit eye, as 2% water solutions. It is interesting to note that not all the powerful CA inhibitors designed in the present study showed topical IOP-lowering effects (such as, for instance, the Cys and  derivatives, devoid of such properties) whereas the Pro, Arg, and oligopeptidyl thiourea derivatives showed reduced efficacy when administered topically. This may be due to the very hydrophilic nature of some of these compounds, whereas inhibitors with balanced hydro- and liposolubility also showed optimal in vivo effects.

Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in ultra-narrow immobilized pH gradient shifted the "Hb fast" band of AA buffalo phenotype haemoglobin into two components which were named Hb1 and Hb3. 2. Urea/Triton electrophoresis and reversed-phase HPLC demonstrated that Hb1 and Hb3 differ in the presence of two structurally distinct alpha chains (alpha 1 and alpha 3), also suggesting that the alpha chains must differ for neutral amino acid substitution. 3. Extensive mass spectrometric analysis on several digests (FAB overlapping) meant to determine the complete sequence of the constituent chains. 4. Two amino acid replacements ( 18---- and  116----) were present in the beta chain with respect to the bovine (A phenotype) chain, whereas the alpha 1 and alpha 3 globins were found to contain four amino acid replacements compared to the bovine alpha, three of which were identical (Glu 23----Asp, Glu 71----Gly and  117----Cys) and, notably, an insertion of Ala at position 123-124. 5.

Illuminated chloroplasts are one of the important sources of hydrogen peroxide (H O ) and are highly sensitive to environmental stimuli, yet a comprehensive view of the oxidation-sensitive chloroplast proteome is still missing. By targeting the sulfenic acid YAP1C-trapping technology to the plastids of light-grown Arabidopsis cells, we identified 132 putatively sulfenylated plastid proteins upon H O pulse treatment. Almost half of the sulfenylated proteins are enzymes of the amino acid . Using metabolomics, we observed a reversible decrease in the levels of the amino acids Ala, , Cys, Gln, Glu, , Ile, Leu, , , Ser, Thr and Val after H O treatment, which is in line with an anticipated decrease in the levels of the glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid metabolites. Through the identification of an organelle-tailored proteome, we demonstrated that the subcellular targeting of the YAP1C probe enables us to study in vivo cysteine sulfenylation at the organellar level. All in all, the identification of these oxidation events in plastids revealed that several enzymes of the amino acid  rapidly undergo cysteine oxidation upon oxidative stress.© 2018 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15618626>Purification and characterization of a co(II)-sensitive alpha-mannosidase from Ginkgo biloba seeds.</a></h2><p>An alpha-mannosidase was purified from developing Ginkgo biloba seeds to apparently homogeneity. The molecular weight of the purified alpha-mannosidase was estimated to be 120 kDa by SDS-PAGE in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol, and 340 kDa by gel filtration, indicating that Ginkgo alpha-mannosidase may function in oligomeric structures in the plant cell. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme was Ala--Met--Tyr-X-Thr-Thr-Gly-Gly-Pro-Val-Ala-Gly--Ile--Val--Leu-. The alpha-mannosidase activity for Man(5)GlcNAc(1) was enhanced by the addition of Co(2+), but the addition of Zn(2+), Ca(2+), or EDTA did not show any significant effect. In the presence of cobalt ions, the hydrolysis rate for pyridylaminated Man(6)GlcNAc(1) was significantly faster than that for pyridylaminated Man(6)GlcNAc(2), suggesting the possibility that this enzyme is involved in the degradation of free N-glycans occurring in developing plant cells (Kimura, Y., and Matsuo, S., J. Biochem., 127, 1013-1019 (2000)). To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that plant cells contain an alpha-mannosidase, which is activated by Co(2+) and prefers the oligomannose type free N-glycans bearing only one GlcNAc residue as substrate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21664994>Recombinant protein purification using complementary peptides as affinity tags.</a></h2><p>Affinity tags have become highly popular tools for purifying recombinant proteins from crude extracts by affinity chromatography. Besides, short peptides are excellent ligands for affinity chromatography, as they are not likely to cause an immune response in case of leakage into the product, they are more stable than antibodies to elution and cleaning conditions and they usually have very acceptable selectivity. Hydropathically complementary peptides designed de novo show enough selectivity to be used successfully as peptide ligands for protein purification from crude extracts. Recognition specificity and selectivity in the interaction between the complementary peptide pair -Leu-Leu--Pro-Ile-Ile-Ile-Ala-Ala-Ser-Leu and --Tyr-Pro----Met-Glu--Arg- have been demonstrated by other authors. In this work, we designed a recombinant protein purification method using a peptide affinity tag that binds to a peptide-binding partner immobilized on a chromatographic matrix. The enhanced green fluorescent protein expressed (EGFP) in Escherichia coli was used as the model. The peptide Gly-Gly-Gly--Leu-Leu--Pro-Ile-Ile-Ile-Ala-Ala-Ser-Leu was synthesized by solid phase using the Fmoc chemistry and immobilized in NHS-Sepharose (PC-Sepharose). Gly residues were added as a spacer arm at the N terminus. The EGFP was expressed either with the fusion tag --Tyr-Pro----Met-Glu--Arg- on the C terminus (EGFP-CPTag) or without any fusion tag. After cell disruption, the extract was directly applied to the PC-Sepharose column equilibrated with 20mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The adsorbed EGFP-CPTag was then eluted with 1M Tris. The yield was 98% and the purification factor 4.6. By contrast, EGFP without tag pass through without interacting with the PC-Sepharose column. The method designed can be applied for the purification of other recombinant proteins.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

It was purified to homogeneity using a combination of ion-exchange chromatography, hydroxyapatite chromatography, and gel filtration. The Mof the proteoglycan was 85, 000 as determined by SDS-PAGE. The protein is rich in aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and leucine. Two internal octapeptides from the proteoglycan contained the sequences Glu-Ile--Leu-Ser--- and Arg-Asp-Leu-Tyr----Ile. These sequences are not previously described, and support the notion that osteoadherin belongs to the family of leucine-rich repeat proteins. A monospecific antiserum was raised in rabbits. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was developed, and showed the osteoadherin content of bone extracts to be 0.4 mg/g of tissue wet weight, whereas none was found in extracts of various other bovine tissues.  labeling of primary bovine osteoblasts followed by immunoprecipitation showed the cells to synthesize and secrete the proteoglycan. Digesting the immunoprecipitated osteoadherin with N-glycosidase reduced its apparent size to 47 kD, thus showing the presence of several N-linked oligosaccharides. Digestion with keratanase indicated some of the oligosaccharides to be extended to keratan sulfate chains. In immunohistochemical studies of the bovine fetal rib growth plate, osteoadherin was exclusively identified in the primary bone spongiosa. Osteoadherin binds to hydroxyapatite. A potential function of this proteoglycan is to bind cells, since we showed it to be as efficient as fibronectin in promoting osteoblast attachment in vitro. The binding appears to be mediated by the integrin alphavbeta3, since this was the only integrin isolated by osteoadherin affinity chromatography of surface-iodinated osteoblast extracts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26339784>Exploring Strong Interactions in Proteins with Quantum Chemistry and Examples of Their Applications in Drug Design.</a></h2><p>Three strong interactions between amino acid side chains (salt bridge, cation-π, and amide bridge) are studied that are stronger than (or comparable to) the common hydrogen bond interactions, and play important roles in protein-protein interactions.Quantum chemical methods MP2 and CCSD(T) are used in calculations of interaction energies and structural optimizations.The energies of three types of amino acid side chain interactions in gaseous phase and in aqueous solutions are calculated using high level quantum chemical methods and basis sets. Typical examples of amino acid salt bridge, cation-π, and amide bridge interactions are analyzed, including the inhibitor design targeting neuraminidase (NA) enzyme of influenza A virus, and the ligand binding interactions in the HCV p7 ion channel. The inhibition mechanism of the M2 proton channel in the influenza A virus is analyzed based on strong amino acid interactions.(1) The salt bridge interactions between acidic amino acids (Glu- and Asp-) and alkaline amino acids (Arg+, + and +) are the strongest residue-residue interactions. However, this type of interaction may be weakened by solvation effects and broken by lower pH conditions. (2) The cation- interactions between protonated amino acids (Arg+, + and +) and aromatic amino acids (, Tyr, Trp and ) are 2.5 to 5-fold stronger than common hydrogen bond interactions and are less affected by the solvation environment.

The emergence of drug-resistant E. aerogenes demands the need for developing new drugs. Peptidoglycan is an important component of the cell wall of bacteria and the peptidoglycan biochemical pathway is considered as the best source of antibacterial targets. Within this pathway, four Mur ligases MurC, MurD, MurE, and MurF are responsible for the successive additions of L-alanine and suitable targets for developing novel antibacterial drugs. As an inference from this fact, we modeled the three-dimensional structure of above Mur ligases using best template structures available in PDB and analyzed its common binding features. Structural refinement and energy minimization of the predicted Mur ligases models is also being done using molecular dynamics studies. The models of Mur ligases were further investigated for in silico docking studies using bioactive plant compounds from the literature. Interestingly, these results indicate that four plant compounds Isojuripidine, Atroviolacegenin, Porrigenin B, and Nummularogenin showing better docking results in terms of binding energy and number of hydrogen bonds. All these four compounds are spirostan-based compounds with differences in side chains and the amino acid such as , , THR, , ARG (polar) and , GLY, VAL, ALA, MET (non-polar) playing active role in binding site of all four Mur ligases. Overall, in the predicted model, the four plant compounds with its binding features could pave way to design novel multi-targeted antibacterial plant-based bioactive compounds specific to Mur ligases for the treatment of Enterobacter infections.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29407909>Dynamics of dehaloperoxidase-hemoglobin A derived from NMR relaxation spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulation.</a></h2><p>Dehaloperoxidase-hemoglobin is the first hemoglobin identified with biologically-relevant oxidative functions, which include peroxidase, peroxygenase and oxidase activities. Herein we report a study of the protein backbone dynamics of DHP using heteronuclear NMR relaxation methods and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to address the role of protein dynamics in switching from one function to another. The results show that DHP's backbone helical regions and turns have average order parameters of S = 0.87 ± 0.03 and S = 0.76 ± 0.08, respectively. Furthermore, DHP is primarily a monomer in solution based on the overall tumbling correlation time τ is 9.49 ± 1.65 ns calculated using the prolate diffusion tensor model in the program relax. A number of amino acid residues have significant R using the Lipari-Szabo model-free formalism. These include , Ile, Leu, Gln, Arg, Ser, Met, Thr, , Arg, Thr Cys, Ala, , Gly, Arg, , Leu and Met, which may experience slow conformational motions on the microseconds-milliseconds time scale according to the model. Caution should be used when the model contains >4 fitting parameters. The program caver3.0 was used to identify tunnels inside DHP obtained from MD simulation snapshots that are consistent with the importance of the Xe binding site, which is located at the central intersection of the tunnels. These tunnels provide diffusion  for small ligands such as O, HO and HO to enter the distal pocket independently of the trajectory of substrates and inhibitors, both of which are aromatic molecules.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Both events involve the central region of the alpha-fodrin subunit, and calmodulin binding enhances the sensitivity of fodrin to CDP-I mediated proteolysis. Fragments of fodrin, generated chemically or proteolytically, which retain calmodulin binding activity have been identified and analyzed by two-dimensional peptide mapping and by direct protein sequencing. Both CDP-I and calmodulin interact with the terminal portion of the eleventh repetitive unit in fodrin, which is at the center of the molecule. CDP-I cleavage occurs between Tyr104 and Gly105 and preserves the calmodulin binding activity of the carboxyl-terminal fragment. In contrast, chymotryptic cleavage at Trp120 reduces the ability of this fragment to bind calmodulin, and tryptic cleavage beyond Trp120 completely eliminates calmodulin binding activity.

These include the bacterial "wild type", CCP(MI), and mutations involving groups on the proximal (Asp-235----, Trp-191----) and distal (Trp-51----, Arg-48----Leu and ) side of the heme. These spectra are used to assess the spin and ligation states of the heme, via the porphyrin marker band frequencies, especially v3, near 1500 cm-1, and, for the FeII forms, the status of the Fe-proximal histidine bond via its stretching frequency. The FeII- frequency is elevated to approximately 240 cm-1 in CCP(MI) and in all of the distal mutants, due to hydrogen-bonding interactions between the proximal -175 N delta and the carboxylate acceptor group on Asp-235. The FeII- RR band has two components, at 233 and 246 cm-1, which are suggested to arise from populations having H-bonded and deprotonated imidazole; these can be viewed in terms of a double-well potential involving proton transfer coupled to protein conformation. The populations shift with changing pH, possibly reflecting structure changes associated with protonation of key histidine residues, and are influenced by the Leu-48 and -191 mutations. A low-spin FeII form is seen at high pH for the -48, Leu-48, -191, and -51 mutants; for the last three species, coordination of the distal -52 is suggested by a approximately 200-cm-1 RR band assignable to Fe(imidazole)2 stretching.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1331655>Isolation and structural characterization of peptides related to alpha- and gamma-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) from the frog brain.</a></h2><p>Peptides that are derived from the processing of proopiomelanocortin were isolated in pure form from the brain of the frog Rana ridibunda. The primary structure of the most abundant of those peptides was established as: Ser-Tyr-Ser-Met-Glu---Arg-Trp-Gly--Pro-Val. This amino acid sequence is identical to that of mammalian and frog pituitary alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) and the peptide co-eluted with synthetic desacetyl alpha-MSH, indicating that it is COOH-terminally alpha-amidated.

This sequence corresponds to -gamma 1-MSH as predicted from the nucleotide sequence of frog proopiomelanocortin.

These mutant enzymes exhibit, in addition to a large decrease in catalytic activity, a change in the substrate-velocity response from a sigmoidal one seen with the native enzyme (Hill coefficient > 2), to a hyperbolic response. With 2-aminobenzoyl-GGFLRKHGQ-N-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)ethylenediamine as substrate, ATP and triphosphate increase the reaction rate of the wild type enzyme some 50-80-fold. This effect is dampened with glutamate mutants to no effect or less than a 3-fold increase in activity and changed to inhibition with the histidine mutants. Sedimentation equilibrium shows the IDE mutants exhibit a similar oligomeric distribution as the wild type enzyme, being predominantly monomeric, with triphosphate having little if any effect on the oligomeric state. Triphosphate did induce aggregation of many of the IDE mutants. Thus, the oligomeric state of IDE does not correlate with kinetic properties. The (112) mutants were shown to bind zinc, but with a lower affinity than the wild type enzyme. The glutamate mutants displayed an altered cleavage profile for the peptide beta-endorphin. Wild type IDE cleaved beta-endorphin at Leu(17)-(18) and (18)-(19), whereas the glutamate mutants cleaved at these sites, but in addition at (19)-(20) and at Met(5)-Thr(6). Thus, active site mutations of IDE are suggested to not only reduce catalytic activity but also cause local conformational changes that affect the allosteric properties of the enzyme.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2564229>Isolation of human tyrosinase from cultured melanoma cells.</a></h2><p>Tyrosinase was isolated from cultured melanoma cells using a procedure involving solubilization of the enzyme by means of Triton X-100, followed by different types of chromatography and tryptic digestion to make the enzyme soluble even in the absence of detergent.

A truncated prepro-alpha-factor gene encoding an alpha-factor precursor with a single alpha-factor repeat was constructed with restriction sites for cassette mutagenesis flanking the single Kex2 cleavage site (-SLDKR downward arrowEAEA-). All of the 19 substitutions for the  (P2) residue in the cleavage site were made. The wild-type and mutant precursors were expressed in a yeast strain lacking the chromosomal genes encoding Kex2 and prepro-alpha-factor. Cleavage of the 20 sites by Kex2, expressed at the wild-type level, was assessed by using a quantitative-mating assay with an effective range greater than six orders of magnitude. All substitutions for  at P2 decreased mating, from 2-fold for Arg to >10(6)-fold for Trp. Eviction of the Kex2-encoding plasmid indicated that cleavage of mutant sites by other cellular proteases was not a complicating factor. Mating efficiencies of strains expressing the mutant precursors correlated well with the specificity (kcat/KM) of purified Kex2 for comparable model peptide substrates, validating the in vivo approach as a quantitative method. The results support the conclusion that KM, which is heavily influenced by the nature of the P2 residue, is a major determinant of cleavage efficiency in vivo.

Competition experiments followed by mutational analysis show that the epitope on hGH for hPRL receptor consists of strong determinants in the middle of helix 1 (comprising residues -18, -21, and -25), a loop region (including Ile-58, Ser-62, and -63), and the central portion of helix 4 (containing residues Arg-167, -168, -172, Glu-174, -176, and Arg-178). When these residues are mapped on a structural model of hGH, they form a patch that overlaps but is not identical to that previously determined for the hGH receptor. Three of these side chains (-18, -21, and Glu-174) are ligands for binding Zn2+, which is required for high-affinity hGH-hPRL receptor complex formation. By introducing pairs of mutations into hGH that exploit the zinc dependency for hPRL receptor binding and remove side chains in the nonoverlapping regions, we have shifted the binding preference toward the hGH receptor by a factor of 34,000 or toward the hPRL receptor by a factor of 150 without substantial loss in binding affinity for the preferred receptor.

The optimum pH and temperature of the proteinase toward the synthetic peptide were 4.0 and 70 degrees C respectively. The proteolytic activity was increased with increasing NaCl concentration in the reaction mixture, the optimum concentration being 2 M. Pepstatin A strongly inhibited the enzyme, with a Ki value of 15 nM at pH 4.0. On the other hand, the active-site residue mutant, in which the putative catalytic aspartic acid residue was mutated to an alanine residue, had no activity. These results show that the Copia proteinase belongs to the family of aspartic proteinases including HIV proteinase. The B-chain of oxidized bovine insulin was hydrolysed at the Leu15-Tyr16 bond fairly selectively. Thus the recombinant Copia proteinase partially resembles HIV proteinase, but is significantly different from it in certain aspects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12732335>Peptidomic analysis of the skin secretions of the pickerel frog Rana palustris identifies six novel families of structurally-related peptides.</a></h2><p>Peptidomics methodology has been used to identify and characterize structurally 26 previously undescribed peptides in the electrically stimulated skin secretions of the North American pickerel frog Rana palustris. Peptides in the secretions were analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry and components in mass range 700-2500 Da, present in major abundance, were purified by reverse-phase HPLC. Cysteine-containing components were identified by treatment with dithiothreitol and 4-vinylpyridine and re-analysis of the derivatizated peptide by mass spectrometry. Application of these techniques led to the identification of six families of structurally-related peptides comprising (a). six peptides containing the consensus sequence Cys-Trp-Xaa-Thr--Ser-Ile-Pro-Pro-/Arg-Xaa-Cys, (b). three peptides containing the consensus sequence Pro-Pro-Gly-Val-Cys-(Xaa)(3)-/Arg-Arg-Cys, (c). two peptides containing the consensus sequence Ser---Val--Pro-Pro-Trp-Met-Cys--Xaa-Leu---Cys, (d). two peptides containing the consensus sequence Arg-Xaa-Cys-Trp--(Xaa)(2)--(Xaa)(3)-Val-Cys-Ser, (e). nine peptides containing the consensus sequence Ser-Leu-Pro-Ala-Gly-Leu-Ser-Pro, and (f). four peptides containing the consensus sequence Asp-Xaa-Gln-Asp-Arg-Trp-Xaa-Pro. The peptides did not inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus and were inactive on hamster vascular or gastric smooth muscle preparations so that their biological functions, if any, remain to be established.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16013872>Radiolytic modification and reactivity of amino acid residues serving as structural probes for protein footprinting.</a></h2><p>Hydroxyl radical-mediated protein footprinting is a convenient and sensitive technique for mapping solvent-accessible surfaces of proteins and examining the structure and dynamics of biological assemblies. In this study, the reactivities and tendencies to form easily detectable products for all 20 (common) amino acid side chains along with cystine are directly compared using various standards. Although we have previously reported on the oxidation of many of these residues, this study includes a detailed examination of the less reactive residues and better defines their usefulness in hydroxyl radical-mediated footprinting experiments. All 20 amino amides along with cystine and a few tripeptides were irradiated by gamma-rays, the products were analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry, and rate constants of modification were measured. The reactivities of amino acid side chains were compared based on their loss of mass spectral signal normalized to the rate of loss for  or Pro that were radiolyzed simultaneously to serve as internal standards. In this way, accurate quantitation of relative rates could be assured. A reactivity order of amino acid side chains was obtained as Cys > Met > Trp > Tyr >  > cystine >  > Leu, Ile > Arg, , Val > Ser, Thr, Pro > Gln, Glu > Asp,  > Ala > Gly. Ala and Gly are far too unreactive to be useful probes in typical experiments and Asp and  are unlikely to be useful as well. Although Ser and Thr are more reactive than Pro, which is known to be a useful probe, their oxidation products are not easily detectable. Thus, it appears that 14 of the 20 side chains (plus cystine) are most likely to be useful in typical experiments. Since these residues comprise approximately 65% of the sequence of a typical protein, the footprinting approach provides excellent coverage of the side-chain reactivity for proteins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28849491>Synthesis of N-Chloroamino Acids and Their Biological Activities in LPS Stimulated RAW 264.7 Cells.</a></h2><p>Amino acids (AAs) are essential for protein synthesis, neurotransmission and macro molecule biosynthesis. Ala, Gln, Gly, , Val and taurine (Tau) are the most abundant free AAs in mammals, and some of these react with hypochlorite (HOCl/OCl) produced by myeloperoxidase in activated phagocytes to form N-chloroamino acids (NCAA). In this study, we reacted 20 AAs and Tau with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), then classified the products into five types (I-V) based on the change in their absorbance. Type I AAs (Ala, Arg, Gln, Gly, Ile, , , Ser, Tau, Thr and Val) generated a typical monochloramine peak at 252 nm, while Type II AAs ( and Tyr) and Type III AAs (Glu and Leu) produced peaks at 275 nm and 225 nm, respectively. The Type IV AAs (, Met and Trp) did not show any distinct absorption peak, and Type V AAs (Asp, Cys and Pro) did not appear to react with NaOCl. The ArgCl and TauCl were stable, while GlnCl, GlyCl, IleCl, LysCl, PheCl and ValCl were less stable and AlaCl, SerCl and ThrCl were the least stable. Tau is the most abundant non-proteinogenic free AA in cellular fluid and has many physiological functions in the nervous, cardiovascular, renal and immune systems. Tau reacts with HOCl to form TauCl, which inhibits the production of proinflammatory mediators such as superoxide, nitric oxide (NO) and interleukins, while increasing the antioxidant proteins in macrophages. We determined the effects of Type I NCAA on cell viability, NO and TNF-α production in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 cells. All Type I NCAA showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity and inhibited LPS-induced NO production. However, only GlnCl, GlyCl, IleCl, LysCl, SerCl and TauCl inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α production. In summary, Type I NCAA showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity and inhibited NO production, while their effects on TNF-α varied. Our results suggest that Type I NCAA may serve as biological regulators similar to TauCl during inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17331770>New variant of quail egg white lysozyme identified by peptide mapping.</a></h2><p>Two lysozymes were purified from quail egg white by cation exchange column chromatography and analyzed for amino acid sequence.

The native-PAGE immunoblot showed one or two lysozymes present in individual egg whites. The established amino acid sequence of quail egg white lysozyme A (QEWL A) was the same as quail lysozyme reported by Kaneda et al. [Kaneda, M., Kato, I., Tominaga, N., Titani, K., Narita, K., 1969.

As such, it can interact with other aromatic residues as well as form hydrogen bonds with polar and charged (both negative and positive) residues. We have analyzed the geometry of interaction of  residues with nine other planar side chains containing aromatic (residues , Tyr, Trp, and ), carboxylate (Asp and Glu), carboxamide ( and Gln) and guanidinium (Arg) groups in 432 polypeptide chains. With the exception of the aspartic (Asp) and glutamic (Glu) acid side-chains, all other residues prefer to interact in a face-to-face or offset-face-stacked orientation with the  ring. Such a geometry is different from the edge-to-face relative orientation normally associated with the aromatic-aromatic interaction. - pair prefers to interact in a face-to-face orientation; however, when both the residues bind the same metal ion, the interplanar angle is close to 90 degrees. The occurrence of different interactions (including the nonconventional N-H...pi and C-H...pi hydrogen bonds) have been correlated with the relative orientations between the interacting residues. Several structural motifs, mostly involved in binding metal ions, have been identified by considering the cases where  residues are in contact with four other planar moieties. About 10% of  residues used here are also found in sequence patterns in PROSITE database. There are examples of the amino end of the  side chain interacting with  residues in such a way that it is located on an arc around a ring nitrogen atom.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8103425>Further study on the specificity of D-amino acid oxidase and D-aspartate oxidase and time course for complete oxidation of D-amino acids.</a></h2><p>1.

The serum concentration (SC) of free AA in pigs can be used as indicators of their availability. This study was conducted with 12 crossbred (Landrace × Hampshire × Duroc) pigs (29.0 ± 2.8 kg initial BW) distributed into 2 groups to analyze the SC of free AA and some AA metabolites in pigs exposed to HS conditions. The treatments were pigs housed under natural HS conditions in a room with no ambient temperature control (23.6 to 37.6°C, HS) and pigs housed at thermoneutral conditions (24 ± 2°C), feed restricted to a level similar to that of their HS counterparts. All pigs received a wheat-soybean meal diet. Blood samples were collected at both the absorptive (2.5 h after a meal) and postabsorptive (10.0 h after a meal) phase. At the absorptive phase, the SC of free Arg, Leu, , , Thr, and Trp were lower ( < 0.05) and the SC of , Val, Ala, Pro, Ser, and Tyr tended to be lower ( < 0.10) in HS pigs. At the postabsorptive phase, the SC of free Arg, , Met, , Gln, and Tyr were higher ( < 0.05) but the SC of Ala was lower ( < 0.01) and the SC of Pro tended to be lower ( < 0.10) in HS pigs. The absorptive SC of carnosine, ornithine (Orn), and Tau were lower ( < 0.05) and of citrulline (Cit), cystathionine, and urea tended to be lower ( < 0.10) in HS pigs. The postabsorptive SC of 3-methyl-, homo-Cys, OH-, and OH-Pro increased ( = 0.05) and of Cit tended to increase ( = 0.10) but that of carnosine and sarcosine ( < 0.05) decreased in HS pigs. The results of this study show a marked and differential effect of HS on the SC of AA. These data indicate that HS negatively affects the digestive and absorptive capacity of pigs and that the  of some AA is modified in pigs to counteract the negative effects of the HS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2421762>Amino acid sequence of bovine brain derived class 1 heparin-binding growth factor.</a></h2><p>The major class 1 heparin-binding growth factor from bovine brain is a single-chain polypeptide of 140 amino acids with a molecular weight of 15 877.

The analysis of side chain flexibility gives insights valuable to improve docking algorithms and can provide an index of amino-acid side-chain flexibility potentially useful in molecular biology and protein engineering studies. In this study we analyzed side-chain rearrangements upon ligand binding. We constructed two non-redundant databases (980 and 353 entries) of "paired" protein structures in complexed (holo-protein) and uncomplexed (apo-protein) forms from the PDB macromolecular structural database. The number and identity of binding pocket residues that undergo side-chain conformational changes were determined. We show that, in general, only a small number of residues in the pocket undergo such changes (e.g., approximately 85% of cases show changes in three residues or less). The flexibility scale has the following order:  > Arg, Gln, Met > Glu, Ile, Leu > , Thr, Val, Tyr, Ser, , Asp > Cys, Trp, ; thus,  side chains in binding pockets flex 25 times more often then do the  side chains. Normalizing for the number of flexible dihedral bonds in each amino acid attenuates the scale somewhat, however, the clear trend of large, polar amino acids being more flexible in the pocket than aromatic ones remains. We found no correlation between backbone movement of a residue upon ligand binding and the flexibility of its side chain. These results are relevant to 1. Reduction of search space in docking algorithms by inclusion of side-chain flexibility for a limited number of binding pocket residues; and 2. Utilization of the amino acid flexibility scale in protein engineering studies to alter the flexibility of binding pockets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2590185>Isolation and characterization of a cDNA clone encoding human aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase.</a></h2><p>The nucleotide sequence of a cDNA clone that includes the entire coding region of human aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase gene is presented.

Native MBP, C1 was treated similarly and the proteolysis products were compared, using electrophoretic, chromatographic and amino acid sequencing techniques. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) revealed differences in the kinetics of proteolysis between the native and the carboxylmethylated MBP, C1 which were confirmed using HPLC. Partial sequencing of the native and carboxylmethylated fragments eluting at about 29 min (P29) revealed cleavage of native MBP, C1 at Gly-127-Gly-128 and of the carboxylmethylated MBP, C1 at -124-Gly-125. Additional evidence including tryptic subdigestion of carboxylmethylated P29 disclosed the following partial sequence for this peptide: Gly-Tyr-Gly-Gly-Arg-Ala-Ser-Asp-Tyr--Ser-Ala---Gly-Leu-- Gly--Asp-Ala-Gln-Gly-Thr-Leu-Ser--Ileu---. This sequence matches MBP residues 125-154. As a result of these findings, Asp-132 and Asp-144 were identified as two of the modified (isomerized or racemized) methyl-accepting L-aspartates in MBP. The results of the proteolysis experiments wherein the sequencing grade staphylococcal V8 proteinase was used at the rarely tested pH of 4.0, rather than at its commonly tested pH of 7.8, also disclose that the proteinase totally failed to recognize and hence cleave the two Glu-X bonds (Glu-82--83 and Glu-118-Gly-119) of MBP, preferring to cleave the protein at a number of hitherto unreported sites.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7830560>Probing the structure-activity relationship of Escherichia coli LT-A by site-directed mutagenesis.</a></h2><p>Computer analysis of the crystallographic structure of the A subunit of Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin (LT) was used to predict residues involved in NAD binding, catalysis and toxicity.

However, these modifications are challenging to control because the low substrate specificity of most GHs often generates undesired by-products. We previously identified a GH2-type fungal β-glucuronidase from  (GUS) exhibiting promiscuous substrate specificity in hydrolysis of triterpenoid saponins. Here, we present the GUS structure, representing the first structure of a fungal β-glucuronidase, and that of an inactive GUS mutant in complex with the native substrate glycyrrhetic acid 3--mono-β-glucuronide (GAMG). GUS displayed a homotetramer structure with each monomer comprising three distinct domains: a sugar-binding, an immunoglobulin-like β-sandwich, and a TIM barrel domain. Two catalytic residues, Glu and Glu, acted as acid/base and nucleophile, respectively. Structural and mutational analyses indicated that the GAMG glycan moiety is recognized by polar interactions with nine residues (Asp, , Asp, Tyr, Tyr, Asp, Arg, , and ) and that the aglycone moiety is recognized by aromatic stacking and by a π interaction with the four aromatic residues Tyr, , Trp, and Tyr Finally, structure-guided mutagenesis to precisely manipulate GUS substrate specificity in the biotransformation of glycyrrhizin into GAMG revealed that two amino acids, Ala and Arg, are critical for substrate specificity. Moreover, we obtained several mutants with dramatically improved GAMG yield (>95%). Structural analysis suggested that modulating the interaction of β-glucuronidase simultaneously toward glycan and aglycone moieties is critical for tuning its substrate specificity toward triterpenoid saponins.© 2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8011636>Prediction and site-specific mutagenesis of residues in transmembrane alpha-helices of proton-pumping nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenases from Escherichia coli and bovine heart mitochondria.</a></h2><p>Nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase from bovine heart consists of a single polypeptide of 109 kD. The complete gene for this transhydrogenase was constructed, and the protein primary structure was determined from the cDNA. As compared to the previously published sequences of partially overlapping clones, three residues differed: Ala591 (previously ), Val777 (previously Glu), and Ala782 (previously Arg). The Escherichia coli transhydrogenase consists of an alpha subunit of 52 kD and a beta subunit of 48 kD. Alignment of the protein primary structure of the bovine trashydrogenase with that of the transhydrogenase from E. coli showed an identity of 52%, indicating similarly folded structures. Prediction of transmembrane-spanning alpha-helices, obtained by applying several prediction algorithms to the primary structures of the revised bovine heart and E. coli transhydrogenases, yielded a model containing 10 transmembrane alpha-helices in both transhydrogenases. In E. coli transhydrogenase, four predicted alpha-helices were located in the alpha subunit and six alpha-helices were located in the beta subunit. Various conserved amino acid residues of the E. coli transhydrogenase located in or close to predicted transmembrane alpha-helixes were replaced by site-specific mutagenesis. Conserved negatively charged residues in predicted transmembrane alpha-helices possibly participating in proton translocation were identified as beta Glu82 (Asp655 in the bovine enzyme) and beta Asp213 (asp787 in the bovine enzyme) located close to the predicted alpha-helices 7 and 9 of the beta subunit. beta Glu82 was replaced by  or Gln and beta Asp213 by  or . However, the catalytic as well as the proton pumping activity was retained. In contrast, mutagenesis of the conserved beta His91 residue (His664 in the bovine enzyme) to Ser, Thr, and Cys gave an essentially inactive enzyme. Mutation of alpha His450 (corresponding to His481 in the bovine enzyme) to Thr greatly lowered catalytic activity without abolishing proton pumping. Since no other conserved acidic or basic residues were predicted in transmembrane alpha-helices regardless of the prediction algorithm used, proton translocation by transhydrogenase was concluded to involve a basic rather than an acidic residue. The only conserved cysteine residue, beta Cys260 (Cys834 in the bovine enzyme), located in the predicted alpha-helix 10 of the E. coli transhydrogenase, previously suggested to function as a redox-active dithiol, proved not to be essential, suggesting that redox-active dithiols do not play a role in the mechanism of transhydrogenase.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4061776>The effect of perinatal anoxia on amino acid  in the developing brain.

These results suggest that perinatal anoxia affected free amino acid patterns in CSF of newborns and infants and that the subsequent disturbance of amino acid  in their brains remained after birth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19640776>Investigation of the interactions between ginsenosides and amino acids by mass spectrometry and theoretical chemistry.</a></h2><p>In order to evaluate the essence of the interactions of ginsenosides and proteins which are composed by alpha-amino acids, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was employed to study the noncovalent interactions between ginsenosides (Rb(2), Rb(3), Re, Rg(1) and Rh(1)) and 18 kinds of alpha-amino acids (Asp, Glu, , , Gln, Thr, Ser, Met, Trp, Val, Gly, Ile, Ala, Leu, Pro, ,  and Arg). The 1:1 and 2:1 noncovalent complexes of ginsenosides and amino acids were observed in the mass spectra. The dissociation constants for the noncovalent complexes were directly calculated based on peak intensities of ginsenosides and the noncovalent complexes in the mass spectra. Based on the dissociation constants, it can be concluded that the acidic and the basic amino acids, Asp, Glu,  and Arg, bound to ginsenosides more strongly than other amino acids. The experimental results were verified by theoretical calculations of parameters of noncovalent interaction between ginsenoside Re and Arg which served as a representative example. Two kinds of binding forms, "head-tail" ("H-T") and "head-head" ("H-H"), were proposed to explain the interaction between ginsenosides and amino acids. And the interaction in "H-T" form was stronger than that in "H-H" form.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3240982>Amino acid composition and NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of human phospholipase A2 purified from rheumatoid synovial fluid.</a></h2><p>The amino acid composition and partial NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of an extracellular phospholipase A2 in human rheumatoid synovial fluid were determined. The predominant amino acids in the phospholipase A2 were cysteine, glycine, arginine, and lysine, suggesting that it is a basic one. The NH2-terminal 34 amino acids were found to be as follows: -Leu-Val----Arg-Met-Ile--Leu-Thr-Thr-Gly--Glu-Ala-Ala-Leu- Ser-Tyr-Gly--Tyr-Gly-Cys-X-Cys-Gly-Val-Gly-Gly-Arg-Gly The enzyme contains -5, Met-8, Ile-9, Tyr-24, Gly-25, Cys-26, Cys-28, Gly-29, Gly-31, Gly-32, and Gly-34 residues, all of which are conserved in most of the sequenced phospholipase A2. The remarkable feature of this enzyme was the absence of Cys-11, which is conserved in the "Group I" enzyme family. This is the first report concerning partial amino acid sequences of human non-pancreatic phospholipase A2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10190575>2,4-toluenediisocyanate and hexamethylene-diisocyanate adducts with blood proteins: assessment of reactivity of amino acid residues in vitro.</a></h2><p>Diisocyanates, reactive compounds used in plastics industry and potent occupational allergens, readily bind to proteins both in vitro and in vivo, however, the pattern of adducts with individual amino acids has not been investigated systematically. In this study, potential of the proteinogenic amino acid residues for carbamoylation with 2,4-toluenediisocyanate (2,4-TDI) and hexamethylenediisocyanate (HDI) was evaluated. The diisocyanates were incubated in an in vitro system (buffer pH 7.4/dioxane 50:50) with: (a) a series of Nalpha-benzyloxycarbonyl amino acids (Z-amino acids) and N-acetylcysteine (Ac-Cys), model compounds for non-N-terminal amino acids of the protein chain; (b) dipeptides Val- and Asp-, model compounds for N-termini of globin and albumin, respectively. Reactivity of the compounds tested, evaluated from their depletion during incubation with the diisocyanates (measured by HPLC), was in the order: Ac-Cys = Asp- > Val- = Nalpha-Z- >> Nalpha-Z- for 2,4-TDI, and Ac-Cys > Asp- > Val- = Nalpha-Z- > Nalpha-Z- > N-Z-Tyr for HDI, however, the adducts with Ac-Cys were unstable. Reactions of other amino acid residues (e.g. Ser, Thr, Met, Trp, Arg, , Gln) with 2,4-TDI and HDI were not observed. Thus, N-terminal amino acids and  residues are likely to produce most abundant adducts with diisocyanates in proteins. Further, three amino compounds with increasing pKa values (Val-, Val and Nalpha-Z-) were incubated with 2,4-TDI and N-acetyl-S-[4-(2-amino)tolylcarbamoyl]cysteine, a 2,4-TDI-derived thiocarbamate with carbamoylating activity, in media with 10% and no dioxane, respectively. Here, reactivity of the amino compounds was decreasing in the order: Val- > Val > Nalpha-Z-, which reflects the mechanism of the amine-isocyanate reaction. The experiments also demonstrate the effect of a solvent (organic phase content) on the yield of the carbamoylation reactions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1376687>Substance-P-related and neurokinin-A-related peptides from the brain of the cod and trout.</a></h2><p>An extract of the brain of the rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss contained high concentrations of both neurokinin A-like immunoreactivity (corresponding to 90 pmol mammalian neurokinin A/g wet tissue) and substance-P-like immunoreactivity (corresponding to 50 pmol mammalian substance P/g wet tissue) measured by radioimmunoassay using antisera directed against the C-terminal regions of the mammalian peptides. In contrast, an extract of the Atlantic cod. Gadus morhua contained only neurokinin-A-like immunoreactivity (151 pmol/g). This apparent paradox was resolved by determination of the primary structures of the fish tachykinins. Trout substance P (-Pro-Arg-Pro--Gln---Gly-Leu-MetNH2) has the same amino acid sequence in its C-terminal region as that in the corresponding region of mammalian substance P. Cod substance P (-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gln-Gln--Ile-Gly-Leu-MetNH2), however, contains a substitution at position 8 (----Ile) that abolishes reactivity with the antiserum to substance P but permits reactivity with the antiserum to neurokinin A. The amino acid sequence of cod and trout neurokinin A is the same (--Ile--Ser--Val-Gly-Leu-MetNH2) and shows two substitutions (Thr3----Ile and Asp4----) compared with mammalian neurokinin A. The data indicate that nervous tissue of teleost fish contain tachykinins that are analogous to the peptides found in mammalian tissues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3926769>The primary structure of thioredoxin from the filamentous cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. 7119.</a></h2><p>Thioredoxin from the cyanobacterium Anabaena 7119 serves as electron donor to ribonucleotide reductase and as a protein disulfide reductase. This small, heat-stable protein was found to have structural and functional similarities to thioredoxins from both bacterial and mammalian sources. We here report the complete primary structure of Anabaena thioredoxin. The structure was determined by analysis of peptides obtained after cleavage with cyanogen bromide, Staphylococcus aureus protease, and trypsin. The protein consists of 106 residues with the following amino acid sequence: Ser-Ala-Ala-Ala-Gln-Val-Thr-Asp- Ser-Thr---Gln-Glu-Val-Leu-Asp-Ser-Asp-Val-Pro-Val-leu-Val-Asp-- Trp-Ala-Pro-Trp-Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys-Arg-Met-Val-Ala-Pro-Val-Val-Asp-Glu- Ile-Ala-Gln-Gln-Tyr-Glu-Gly--Ile--Val-Val--Val--Thr-Asp- Glu--Pro-Gln-Val-Ala-Ser-Gln-Tyr-Gly-Ile-Arg-Ser-Ile-Pro-Thr-Leu- Met-Ile---Gly-Gly-Gln--Val-Asp-Met-Val-Val-Gly-Ala-Val-Pro- -Thr-Thr-Leu-Ser-Gln-Thr-Leu-Glu---Leu. The sequence of Anabaena thioredoxin shows a definite homology to the protein from Escherichia coli, with 49% residue identities occurring in the proteins when aligned at the active site disulfide.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8765516>A single-point slight alteration set as a tool for structure-activity relationship studies of ovine corticotropin releasing factor.</a></h2><p>In order to determine which amino acid side chains of ovine corticotropin releasing factor (oCRF) are most sensitive to alterations with respect to receptor binding and activation, we synthesized a single-point replacement set by replacing each residue by a similar, preferably proteinogenic amino acid, maintaining a minimal change of character at each position (Ser by Thr, Gln by , Glu by Asp, Arg by , and vice versa, Pro by N-MeAla, Ile by Leu, Leu by Nle,  by Trp,  by Ala, Val by Leu, Met by Nle, Ala by Leu). In general, any loss in the biological potency by a single-point substitution in oCRF parallels a decrease in receptor binding, indicating that, in contrast to previous suggestions, there is no specific side chain in the peptide that is more responsible for receptor activation than for receptor binding. In addition to Arg(16), Ala(31), and Arg(35), amino acid residues in the N-terminal sequence (5-14) were found to be sensitive to alteration, demonstrating their particular importance for the receptor interaction of CRF agonists. Most of the analogs tested exhibited agonistic potencies in an in vitro pituitary cell culture assay at a concentration of 0.3 nM, and all analogs showed full agonistic potency at 1 microM. In contrast to the results of an alanine replacement study, the strongest decrease in receptor binding and biological potency was observed for analogs with substitutions of hydrophilic amino acids Ser(7), Arg(16), Glu(17), or (34). In the case of Ser(7) and Arg(16), side chain specific interactions with the receptor may be required for high affinity. Alanine replacements at positions 17 or 34 resulted in analogs that were as potent as oCRF, while replacement of Glu(17) by Asp or (34) by Gln caused a dramatic loss in potency, thereby suggesting an important effect at sterically or conformationally sensitive positions. In contrast to corresponding alanine analogs which exhibited a significant loss in biological potency, slight alterations of lipophilic side chains at positions 6, 12, or 38 did not cause a significant reduction of receptor binding and activation, indicating that it is not specific side chains but rather lipophilicity which is essential at these positions. Indeed, replacement of (12) by Trp provides an agonist with significantly increased receptor binding and biological potency.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11129582>Substrate specificity of cucumisin on synthetic peptides.</a></h2><p>The substrate specificity of cucumisin [EC 3.4.21.25] was identified by the use of the synthetic peptide substrates Leu(m)-Pro-Glu-Ala-Leu(n) (m = 0-4, n = 0-3). Neither Pro-Glu-Ala-Leu (m = 0) nor Leu-Pro-Glu-Ala (n = 0) was cleaved by cucumisin, however other analogus peptides were cleaved between Glu-Ala. The hydrolysis rates of Leu(m)-Pro-Glu-Ala-Leu increased with the increase of m = 1 to 2 and 3, but was however, essentially same with the increase of m = 3 to 4. Similarly, the hydrolysis rates of Leu-Leu-Pro-Glu-Ala-Leu(n) increased with the increase of n = 0 to 1 and 2, but was essentially same with the increase of n = 2 to 3. Then, it was concluded that cucumisin has a S5-S3' subsite length. In order to identify the substrate specificity at P1 position, Leu-Leu-Pro-X-Ala-Leu (X; Gly, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Pro, Asp, Glu, , Arg, , Gln, , Tyr, Ser, Thr, Met, Trp, ) were synthesized and digested by cucumisin. Cucumisin showed broad specificity at the P1 position. However, cucumisin did not cleave the C-terminal side of Gly, Ile, Pro, and preferred Leu, , Gln, Thr, and Met, especially Met. Moreover, the substrates, Leu-Leu-Pro-Glu-Y-Leu (Y; Gly, Ala, Ser, Leu, Val, Glu, , ) were synthesized and digested by cucumisin. Cucumisin did not cleave the N-terminal side of Val but preferred Gly, Ser, Ala, and  especially Ser. The specificity of cucumisin for naturally occurring peptides does not agree strictly with the specificity obtained by synthetic peptides at the P1 or P1' position alone, but it becomes clear that the most of the cleavage sites on naturally occurring peptides by cucumisin contain suitable amino acid residues at P1 and (or) P1' positions. Moreover, cucumisin prefers Pro than Leu at P2 position, indicating that the specificity at P2 position differs from that of papain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19463738>The alyteserins: two families of antimicrobial peptides from the skin secretions of the midwife toad Alytes obstetricans (Alytidae).</a></h2><p>Two families of structurally related C-terminally alpha-amidated antimicrobial peptides have been identified in norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the midwife toad Alytes obstetricans (Alytidae). The alyteserin-1 peptides (Gly-Leu--(Asp/Glu)-Ile---Ala-Gly-Leu-Gly-Ser-Leu-Val--(Gly/)-Ile-Ala-Ala--Val-Ala-(/Ser).NH(2)) show limited structural similarity to the ascaphins from the skins of frogs of the family Leiopelmatidae. Alyteserin-2a (Ile-Leu-Gly--Leu-Leu-Ser-Thr-Ala-Ala-Gly-Leu-Leu-Ser--Leu.NH(2)) and alyteserin-2b and -2c (Ile-Leu-Gly-Ala-Ile-Leu-Pro-Leu-Val-Ser-Gly-Leu-Leu-Ser-(/Ser)--Leu x NH(2)) show limited sequence identity with bombinin H6, present in the skins of frogs of the family Bombinatoridae. The alyteserin-1 peptides show selective growth inhibitory activity against the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli (MIC=25 microM) whereas alyteserin-2a is more potent against the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (MIC=50 microM). The hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes of all peptides tested is relatively weak (LC(50)>100 microM). The data demonstrate that the frogs belonging to the family Alytidae are among those producing dermal antimicrobial peptides that may represent a component of the animal's system of innate .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11018763>Production and characterization of specific antibodies for evaluation of glycated insulin in plasma and biological tissues.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have shown that glycation of insulin occurs in pancreatic beta-cells under conditions of hyperglycaemia and that the site of glycation is the N-terminal (1) of the insulin B-chain. To enable evaluation of glycated insulin in diabetes, specific antibodies were raised in rabbits and guinea-pigs by using two synthetic peptides (A: -Val--Gln--Leu-Cys-Tyr, and B: -Val--Gln--Leu-Tyr-) modified by N-terminal glycation and corresponding closely to the N-terminal sequence of the glycated human insulin B-chain. For immunization, the glycated peptides were conjugated either to keyhole limpet haemocyanin or ovalbumin using glutaraldehyde, m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester or 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino propyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride. Antibody titration curves, obtained using I(125)-tyrosylated tracer prepared from glycated peptide A, revealed high-titre antisera in five groups of animals immunized for 8-28 weeks. The highest titres were observed in rabbits and guinea-pigs immunized with peptide B coupled to ovalbumin using glutaraldehyde. Under radioimmunoassay conditions, these antisera exhibited effective dose (median) (ED(50)) values for glycated insulin of 0.3-15 ng/ml and 0.9-2.5 ng/ml respectively, with negligible cross-reactivity against insulin or other islet peptides. The degree of cross-reaction with glycated proinsulin was approximately 50%. Glycated insulin in plasma of control and hydrocortisone-treated diabetic rats measured using rabbit 3 antiserum (1:10 000 dilution; sensitivity <19 pg/ml) was 0. 08+/-0.01 and 1.5+/-0.6 ng/ml (P<0.01), corresponding to 4 and 16% of total circulating insulin concentration respectively. Immunocytochemistry studies of the pancreas of streptozotocin-treated diabetic rats using a 1:1000 dilution of guinea-pig 2 antiserum revealed clusters of fluorescent positively stained cells in islets. These studies document the successful production of polyclonal antisera specific for glycated insulin and their usefulness in radioimmunoassays and immunocytochemistry. The demonstration of glycated insulin in plasma and islets of animal models of diabetes supports the view that glycation of insulin is involved in the pathogenesis of this disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25726107>Short communication: Evaluation of amino acid consumption and necessary profiles of Streptococcus thermophilus T1C2 in controlled pH batch fermentations.</a></h2><p>The objective of the present study was to elucidate the relationship between amino acid consumption and necessary profiles of Streptococcus thermophilus T1C2 to guide the design of media for high-cell-density culture. The amino acid consumption and necessary patterns of S. thermophilus T1C2 were investigated in the complete chemically defined medium. For amino acid consumption profiles throughout the growth of S. thermophilus T1C2, the most abundantly consumed amino acids were Gln and Arg, which accounted for 19 and 20% of total amino acids consumed, respectively. Asparagine, Thr, Ser, Ala, Val, Met, Leu, and , consumptions of which ranged from 3 to 10% of total amino acids consumed, were the second most intensively consumed amino acids. For necessary amino acid patterns, the amount of Cys, which counted for 11% of total amino acids needed, was significantly higher than the amounts required for other amino acids in growth of S. thermophilus T1C2. The necessary amounts of Asp, , Glu, Gln, Arg, Ala, Met, and Tyr ranked second, ranging from 5 to 8% of total amino acids needed. Compared with necessary amounts, the consumption of , Thr, Ser, Gln, Arg, Ala, Val, Leu, , , and  exceeded the necessary amounts for growth of S. thermophilus T1C2 remarkably. Consumption of Gly, Met, Ile, Trp, and Pro was slightly higher than the necessary amounts. Consumption of Asp, Glu, Tyr, and Cys was lower than the necessary amounts. The overall consumption of amino acids exceeded the required amount for growth of S. thermophilus T1C2 almost 2.43 times, which implied a significant nitrogen wasting.Copyright © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.

Coumarins are important plant secondary metabolites with a variety of biological activities. Ortho-hydroxylation of cinnamates leads to the formation of coumarin lactone ring and is generally thought to be a key step in coumarin biosynthesis. However, ortho-hydroxylases, especially p-coumaroyl CoA 2'-hydroxylase (C2'H) responsible for the biosynthesis of the most common coumarin skeleton, have received insufficient attention. Here, a putative ortho-hydroxylase PpC2'H was isolated from P. praeruptorum Dunn, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb rich in coumarins. Expression profile indicated that PpC2'H exhibited the highest transcript level in roots and could be up-regulated by MeJA elicitation. Subcellular localization of PpC2'H was demonstrated to be cytosol in planta. In order to functionally characterize PpC2'H, the purified recombinant protein was incubated with various potential substrates. HPLC-ESI-MS analysis indicated that PpC2'H catalyzed the conversion of p-coumaroyl CoA into hydroxylated intermediate, which then underwent spontaneous lactonization to generate umbelliferone. Our data also showed that light would promote the spontaneous process. In addition, based on homology modeling and site-directed mutagenesis, amino acid residues -130, -141, -207, -224, Asp-226, -282 and -298 were verified essential for enzymatic activity. These findings provide insight into structure-function relationship of this pivotal ortho-hydroxylase and also contribute to elucidating the biosynthetic mechanism of coumarin skeleton.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8033906>Inhibition of cell adhesion to glycoproteins of the extracellular matrix by peptides corresponding to serum amyloid A. Toward understanding the physiological role of an enigmatic protein.</a></h2><p>Synthetic peptides related to amino acid residues 29-42 of human serum amyloid A (SAA), Tyr-Ile-Gly-Ser-Asp--Tyr---Ala-Arg-Gly--Tyr, were found to inhibit the adhesion of human T-lymphocytes and of mouse M4 melanoma cells to surfaces coated with the major cell adhesive glycoproteins of the extracellular matrix, laminin or fibronectin. Correspondingly inhibitory activity was manifested by the entire 14-residue peptide, by its YIGSD laminin-related domain, and by RGN, the fibronectin-related domain. Intact recombinant SAA (rSAA) and its 1-76 fragment, an amyloid A (AA) protein, also inhibited cell adhesion. The peptides did not inhibit collagen and ADP-induced aggregation of human platelets. Proteolysis of SAA by lysosomal enzymes originating from human neutrophils led to generation of specific peptide segments some of which pertain to the 29-42 domain. It is suggested that the acute-phase protein SAA might be involved, either directly or via its peptide fragments, in inhibition of inflammatory reactions or metastatic processes which depend on integrin and possibly other extracellular-matrix-specific receptors mediated specific recognition and interactions with immobilized components of blood-vessel walls.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1541729>Kinetics of amino acid extraction by lactating mammary glands in control and sometribove-treated Holstein cows.</a></h2><p>Studies of mammary arteriovenous difference were conducted on multiparous lactating Holstein cows (n = 21) on d 35, 70, 105, and 126 of lactation to examine kinetic relationships between arterial concentration and mammary gland extraction of AA. Additionally, these cows were paired by previous lactational performance and assigned to bST-treated or control groups to examine the effect of bST treatment on AA concentration and extraction by lactating mammary glands. Treated cows were injected daily with 40 mg of recombinant bST from d 71 through 126 of lactation. Arterial concentrations of Asp, Ser, , Gly, beta-aminoisobutyrate, and Met were increased. Concentrations of Val, Ile, Leu, , Orn, and  were decreased in bST-treated cows compared with controls. Increased extractions of Asp and Met by mammary glands in treated versus control cows were correlated positively with treatment-induced changes in arterial concentrations of these AA. However, increased mammary extractions of Arg, cystathionine, Leu, and  by bST-treated compared with control cows were not correlated with bST-induced changes in arterial concentrations of these AA. Extractions of , , Thr, Arg, Tyr, Met, cystathionine, cystine, Ile, , Orn, Glu, Gly, Tau, Cit, Leu, and Val were correlated linearly with arterial concentrations (r2 greater than .15) of each AA.
