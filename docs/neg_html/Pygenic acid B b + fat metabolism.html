Up to now, the ability of ThB to interfere with lipid  was studied in mice fed a laboratory chow enriched or not with the synthetic agonist Wy14,643, a pharmacological activator of the nuclear hormone receptor PPARα. The aim of the present study was therefore to determine whether ThB could play a role in obesity and lipid  when mice are chronically fed a synthetic High  Diet (HFD) or a Low  Diet (LFD) as a control diet. To investigate this possibility, wild-type (WT) mice and mice deficient for Thb (Thb(-/-)) were subjected to either a synthetic LFD or a HFD for 25 weeks, and their responses were compared. First, when fed a normal regulatory laboratory chow, Thb(-/-) mice displayed growth retardation as well as a severe reduction in the plasma level of Growth Hormone (GH) and Insulin Growth Factor-I (IGF-I), suggesting alterations in the GH/IGF-1 pathway. When fed the synthetic diets, the corrected energy intake to body mass was significantly higher in Thb(-/-) mice, yet those mice were protected from HFD-induced adiposity. Importantly, Thb(-/-) mice also suffered from hypoglycemia, exhibited reduction in liver glycogen stores and circulating insulin levels under the LFD and the HFD. Thb deficiency was also associated with higher levels of plasma HDL (High Density Lipoproteins) cholesterol and increased liver content of cholesterol under both the LFD and the HFD. As shown by the plasma lathosterol to cholesterol ratio, a surrogate marker for cholesterol biosynthesis, whole body cholesterol de novo synthesis was increased in Thb(-/-) mice. By comparing liver RNA from WT mice and Thb(-/-) mice using oligonucleotide microarray and RT-qPCR, a coordinated decrease in the expression of critical cholesterol synthesizing genes and an increased expression of genes involved in bile  synthesis (Cyp7a1, Cyp17a1, Akr1d1) were observed in Thb(-/-) mice. In parallel, the elevation of the lathosterol to cholesterol ratio as well as the increased expression of cholesterol synthesizing genes were observed in the kidney of Thb(-/-) mice fed the LFD and the HFD. Overall, the data indicate that ThB is not fully interchangeable with the thiolase A isoform. The present study also reveals that modulating the expression of the peroxisomal ThB enzyme can largely reverberate not only throughout fatty   but also cholesterol, bile  and glucose .Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

A subsample of 18 men participated in the kinetic study. Before and after the 6-7 week dietary intervention, kinetic subjects received a primed-constant infusion of [5,5,5-2H3]L-leucine for 12 h under feeding conditions. ApoA-I production rate (PR; -31.5%; P <0.001) and fractional catabolic rate (FCR; -24.3%; P <0.05) were significantly decreased after the low- diet. These changes in apoA-I PR and FCR with the low- diet were also significantly different from those observed with the high-MUFA diet (P <0.01 and P <0.05, respectively). ApoA-II FCR was significantly increased in the high-MUFA group only. No significant within- or between-diet difference was found in VLDL-apoB-100 PR or FCR. These results emphasize the differential impact of the low- diet and high-MUFA diet on HDL .</p></html>
