However, acute effects of NE stimulation have not been described at the transcriptional network level.We used RNA-seq to uncover a broad transcriptional response. The inference of protein-protein and protein-DNA interaction networks allowed us to identify a set of immediate-early genes (IEGs) with high betweenness, validating our approach and suggesting a hierarchical control of transcriptional regulation. In addition, we identified a transcriptional regulatory network with IEGs as master regulators, including HSF1 and NFIL3 as novel NE-induced IEG candidates. Moreover, a functional enrichment analysis and gene clustering into functional modules suggest a crosstalk between metabolic, signaling, and immune responses.Altogether, our network biology approach explores for the first time the immediate-early systems level response of human adipocytes to acute sympathetic activation, thereby providing a first network basis of early cell fate programs and crosstalks between metabolic and transcriptional networks required for proper WAT function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30542047>Differences in the actions of adrenaline and noradrenaline with regard to glucose intolerance in patients with pheochromocytoma.</a></h2><p>Glucose intolerance is often observed in patients with pheochromocytoma. However, it remains controversial issue that glucose intolerance on pheochromocytoma is caused by impaired insulin secretion and/or by increased insulin resistance. We aimed to reveal the mechanism of glucose intolerance on pheochromocytoma with regard to the type and amount of catecholamines released. We evaluated 12 individuals diagnosed with pheochromocytoma and who underwent surgery to remove it. We examined glycemic parameters before and after surgery and investigated the association between the change of parameters of insulin secretion (homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function (HOMA-β)), insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)) and that of urinary levels of metanephrine/normetanephrine before and after surgery. Overall, fasting plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), HOMA-β, and HOMA-IR were improved significantly after surgery. Regression analysis showed that the improvement in HOMA-β from before to after surgery was significantly positively associated with an improvement in urinary levels of metanephrine from before to after surgery and showed a significantly negative association with improvement in urinary levels of normetanephrine from before to after surgery. The improvement in HOMA-IR from before to after surgery was significantly positively associated with an improvement in urinary levels of normetanephrine from before to after surgery. Our results showed that pheochromocytoma extirpation improved glycemic parameters. Furthermore, the different effects elicited by excess amounts of adrenaline and noradrenaline on glucose intolerance were demonstrated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29846720>Neuroendocrine Regulation of Air Pollution Health Effects: Emerging Insights.</a></h2><p>Air pollutant exposures are linked to cardiopulmonary diseases, , metabolic syndrome, neurobehavioral conditions, and reproductive abnormalities. Significant effort is invested in understanding how pollutants encountered by the lung might induce effects in distant organs. The role of circulating mediators has been predicted; however, their origin and identity have not been confirmed. New evidence has emerged which implicates the role of neuroendocrine sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress axes in mediating a wide array of systemic and pulmonary effects. Our recent studies using ozone exposure as a prototypical air pollutant demonstrate that increases in circulating adrenal-derived stress hormones (epinephrine and cortisol/corticosterone) contribute to lung injury/inflammation and metabolic effects in the liver, pancreas, adipose, and muscle tissues. When stress hormones are depleted by adrenalectomy in rats, most ozone effects including lung injury/inflammation are diminished. Animals treated with antagonists for adrenergic and glucocorticoid receptors show inhibition of the pulmonary and systemic effects of ozone, whereas treatment with agonists restore and exacerbate the ozone-induced injury/inflammation phenotype, implying the role of neuroendocrine activation. The neuroendocrine system is critical for normal homeostasis and allostatic activation; however, chronic exposure to stressors may lead to increases in allostatic load. The emerging mechanisms by which circulating mediators are released and are responsible for producing multiorgan effects of air pollutants insists upon a paradigm shift in the field of air pollution and health. Moreover, since these neuroendocrine responses are linked to both chemical and nonchemical stressors, the interactive influence of air pollutants, lifestyle, and environmental factors requires further study.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27411013>Lack of Adipocyte AMPK Exacerbates Insulin Resistance and Hepatic Steatosis through Brown and Beige Adipose Tissue Function.</a></h2><p>Brown (BAT) and white (WAT) adipose tissues play distinct roles in maintaining whole-body energy homeostasis, and their dysfunction can contribute to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and type 2 . The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a cellular energy sensor, but its role in regulating BAT and WAT metabolism is unclear. We generated an inducible model for deletion of the two AMPK β subunits in adipocytes (iβ1β2AKO) and found that iβ1β2AKO mice were cold intolerant and resistant to β-adrenergic activation of BAT and beiging of WAT. BAT from iβ1β2AKO mice had impairments in mitochondrial structure, function, and markers of mitophagy. In response to a high-fat diet, iβ1β2AKO mice more rapidly developed liver steatosis as well as glucose and insulin intolerance. Thus, AMPK in adipocytes is vital for maintaining mitochondrial integrity, responding to pharmacological agents and thermal stress, and protecting against nutrient-overload-induced NAFLD and insulin resistance.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

For this reason, the objective of this work was to study the expression of the orphan receptor GPR135 in brain, heart, kidney, aorta, lung, spleen and liver of diabetic rats, as well as its function by the administration of siRNA (small interfering RNA) and curves to isoproterenol. Our results showed that GPR135 is expressed in all tissues analyzed and its expression is modified due to , we also observed that the responses to isoproterenol increase in diabetic rats administered with siRNA. Therefore, we conclude that the orphan receptor GPR135 is expressed in different tissues and its expression tends to be modified due to , besides that it is functional and that it seems to be coupled to Gi/o protein which has negative chronotropic and inotropic effects, therefore, we do not rule out that it participates in the cardiovascular complications associated with .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29677047>A polymorphism in the noradrenaline transporter gene is associated with increased blood pressure in patients with resistant hypertension.</a></h2><p>Noradrenaline released from sympathetic nerves is rapidly inactivated via the action of the noradrenaline transporter (NET). We aimed to determine whether a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the NET gene, rs7194256, was associated with blood pressure and plasma noradrenaline concentration in patients with resistant hypertension.Ninety-two consecutive patients with resistant hypertension participated in this study (age 62 ± 1.3 years, BMI 32 ± 0.6 kg/m, mean ± SEM). Blood pressure was assessed using 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Genotyping of rs7194256 (C/T) was performed using a predeveloped TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay. Plasma catecholamines were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography.There were no differences in anthropometric measures between those carrying a T allele or the CC genotype. Patients carrying a T allele had significantly higher SBP: 24-h mean 148 ± 2.6 vs. 140 ± 2.4; 24-h max 189 ± 3.2 vs. 179 ± 2.6; 24-h min 114 ± 3.0 vs. 105 ± 2.3; night mean 141 ± 3.0 vs. 131 ± 2.5; night max 170 ± 3.6 vs. 159 ± 3.1; night min 118 ± 3.4 vs. 109 ± 2.4 (all P < 0.05). T-allele carriers had a significantly higher arterial noradrenaline concentration: 573 ± 53 vs. 377 ± 35 pg/ml (P = 0.002) and lower ratio of the intraneuronal noradrenaline metabolite, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol, to noradrenaline (3.01 ± 0.4 vs. 4.08 ± 0.3 pg/ml; P = 0.024).A SNP in the NET gene in patients with resistant hypertension is associated with higher plasma noradrenaline concentration and elevated SBP.

The gene encoding CFAS is present in many bacteria and several Leishmania spp. including Leishmania mexicana, Leishmania infantum and Leishmania braziliensis. In this study, we characterised the CFAS-null and -overexpression mutants in L. mexicana, the causative agent for cutaneous leishmaniasis in Mexico and central America. Our data indicate that L. mexicana CFAS modifies the fatty acid chain of plasmenylethanolamine (PME), the dominant class of  glycerophospholipids in Leishmania, generating CFA-PME. While the endogenous level of CFA-PME is extremely low in wild type L. mexicana, overexpression of CFAS results in a significant increase. CFAS-null mutants (cfas) exhibit altered cell shape, increased sensitivity to acidic pH, and aberrant growth in serum-free media. In addition, the CFAS protein is preferentially expressed during the proliferative stage of L. mexicana and is required for the cell membrane targeting of lipophosphoglycan. Finally, the maturation and localization of CFAS protein are dependent upon the downstream sequence of the CFAS coding region. Without the downstream sequence, the mis-localised CFAS protein cannot fully rescue the defects of cfas. Our data suggest that CFA modification of phospholipids can significantly affect the parasite's response to certain adverse conditions. These findings are distinct from the roles of CFAS in L. infantum, highlighting the functional divergence in lipid modification among Leishmania spp.Copyright © 2017 Australian Society for Parasitology.

In OLETF aortas, we observed the following: (1) Up₄A-induced contractions were lower than those in the LETO aortas under basal conditions, (2) slight relaxation occurred due to Up₄A, but this was not observed in phenylephrine-precontracted LETO aortas, (3) acetylcholine-induced relaxation was reduced (vs. LETO), and (4) prostanoid release (prostaglandin (PG)F, thromboxane (Tx)A₂ metabolite, and PGE₂) due to Up₄A was decreased (vs. LETO). Endothelial denudation suppressed Up₄A-induced contractions in the LETO group, but increased the contractions in the OLETF group. Under nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibition, Up₄A induced contractions in phenylephrine-precontracted aortas; this effect was greater in the LETO group (vs. the OLETF group). The relaxation response induced by Up₄A was unmasked by cyclooxygenase inhibitors, especially in the LETO group, but this effect was abolished by NOS inhibition. These results suggest that the relaxant component of the Up₄A-mediated response was masked by prostanoids in the LETO aortas and that the LETO and OLETF rats presented different contributions of the endothelium to the response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30256679>Improved glucose homeostasis in male obese Zucker rats coincides with enhanced baroreflexes and activation of the nucleus tractus solitarius.</a></h2><p>Young adult male obese Zucker rats (OZR) develop insulin resistance and hypertension with impaired baroreflex-mediated bradycardia and activation of nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). Because type 1 diabetic rats also develop impaired baroreflex-mediated NTS activation, we hypothesized that improving glycemic control in OZR would enhance compromised baroreflexes and NTS activation. Fasting blood glucose measured by telemetry was comparable in OZR and lean Zucker rats (LZR) at 12-17 wk. However, with access to food, OZR were chronically hyperglycemic throughout this age range. By 15-17 wk of age, tail samples yielded higher glucose values than those measured by telemetry in OZR but not LZR, consistent with reports of exaggerated stress responses in OZR. Injection of glucose (1g/kg ip) produced larger rises in glucose and areas under the curve in OZR than LZR. Treatment with metformin (300 mg·kg·day) or pioglitazone (5 mg·kg·day) in drinking water for 2-3 wk normalized fed glucose levels in OZR with no effect in LZR. After metformin treatment, area under the curve for blood glucose after glucose injection was reduced in OZR and comparable to LZR. Hyperinsulinemia was slightly reduced by each treatment in OZR, but insulin was still greatly elevated compared with LZR. Neither treatment reduced hypertension in OZR, but both treatments significantly improved the blunted phenylephrine-induced bradycardia and NTS c-Fos expression in OZR with no effect in LZR. These data suggest that restoring glycemic control in OZR enhances baroreflex control of heart rate by improving the response of the NTS to raising arterial pressure, even in the presence of hyperinsulinemia and hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28414329>Alternatively activated macrophages do not synthesize catecholamines or contribute to adipose tissue adaptive thermogenesis.</a></h2><p>Adaptive thermogenesis is the process of heat generation in response to cold stimulation. It is under the control of the sympathetic nervous system, whose chief effector is the catecholamine norepinephrine (NE). NE enhances thermogenesis through β3-adrenergic receptors to activate brown adipose tissue and by 'browning' white adipose tissue. Recent studies have reported that alternative activation of macrophages in response to interleukin (IL)-4 stimulation induces the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a key enzyme in the catecholamine synthesis pathway, and that this activation provides an alternative source of locally produced catecholamines during the thermogenic process. Here we report that the deletion of Th in hematopoietic cells of adult mice neither alters energy expenditure upon cold exposure nor reduces browning in inguinal adipose tissue. Bone marrow-derived macrophages did not release NE in response to stimulation with IL-4, and conditioned media from IL-4-stimulated macrophages failed to induce expression of thermogenic genes, such as uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1), in adipocytes cultured with the conditioned media. Furthermore, chronic treatment with IL-4 failed to increase energy expenditure in wild-type, Ucp1 and interleukin-4 receptor-α double-negative (Il4ra) mice. In agreement with these findings, adipose-tissue-resident macrophages did not express TH. Thus, we conclude that alternatively activated macrophages do not synthesize relevant amounts of catecholamines, and hence, are not likely to have a direct role in adipocyte metabolism or adaptive thermogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30283093>Evaluation of Hypoglycaemia with Non-Invasive Sensors in People with Type 1  and Impaired Awareness of Hypoglycaemia.</a></h2><p>People with type 1  and impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia (IAH) are prone to severe hypoglycaemia. Previous attempts to develop non-invasive hypoglycaemia alarm systems have shown promising results, but it is not known if such alarms can detect severe hypoglycaemia in people with IAH. We aimed to explore whether a combination of non-invasive sensors could reliably evaluate hypoglycaemia (plasma glucose (PG) minimum 2.5 mmol/L) in people with IAH. Twenty participants with type 1  and IAH underwent randomly ordered, single blinded hyperinsulinemic euglycaemic and hyperinsulinemic hypoglycaemic clamps. Sweating, skin temperature, ECG, counterregulatory hormones and symptoms of hypoglycaemia were assessed. Overall, we were not able to detect clamp-induced hypoglycaemia with sufficient sensitivity and specificity for further clinical use. As a post-hoc analysis, we stratified participants according to their ability to identify hypoglycaemic symptoms during hypoglycaemic clamps. Five out of 20 participants could identify such symptoms. These participants had a significantly higher adrenaline response to hypoglycaemia (p < 0.001) and were reliably identified by sensors. Based on our observations, a non-invasive alarm system based on measurement of sweating responses and ECG changes during hypoglycaemia might provide an alert at a plasma glucose concentration around 2.5 mmol/L if an adequate sympatho-adrenal reaction is elicited.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28050987>Glucose Levels and Hemodynamic Changes in Patients submitted to Routine Dental Extraction under Local Anesthesia with and without Adrenaline.</a></h2><p>In maxillofacial surgery, the simplest procedure that we perform is dental extraction. However, this simple procedure is challenged by the patient's poor medical condition. We generally use local anesthesia in combination with adrenaline; however, as we come across patients with  and cardiovascular diseases who seek dental extraction, we need to be doubly cautious while using adrenaline. In this study, we intend to compare the effects of local anesthesia with adrenaline and local anesthesia without adrenaline on hemodynamic changes (blood pressure and pulse rate) and random blood sugar levels. The comparison is both within the group and between the two groups.Healthy patients between the ages 20 and 60 years were included and randomized into two groups of 50 each. In one group, plain local anesthesia was used, whereas in the other group, local anesthetic solution containing adrenaline was used. Medically compromised patients were excluded from the study. Random blood sugar levels, blood pressures, and pulse rates were recorded in both groups before and 10 minutes after injecting the solutions. The findings were compared.When results are compared within the group, a modest increase in the blood sugar level was noted with the group receiving local anesthetic with adrenaline. However, blood pressure and pulse rate showed no significant difference. Similarly, when between-the-groups comparison was done, not a single variable showed any significant difference.The patients injected with local anesthesia containing adrenaline showed similar results to that observed in the patients injected with local anesthesia without adrenaline. However, there is a statistically significant rise in blood sugar levels when a local anesthetic is injected with adrenaline.Dental extractions in healthy individuals can be safely performed with local anesthetic containing adrenaline. However, in diabetic patients, it should be cautiously used.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28118732>Relationship between PDK1 and contraction in carotid arteries in Goto-Kakizaki rat, a spontaneous type 2 diabetic animal model.</a></h2><p>We studied the relationship between 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) and contractions induced by serotonin, phenylephrine, and thromboxane A mimetic (U46619) in the presence of nitric oxide synthase inhibitor in the carotid arteries of Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats, a spontaneous type 2 diabetic model, in the chronic stage of disease. Serotonin-induced contraction was greater in the GK rats than in the control Wistar rats. A specific PDK1 inhibitor (GSK2334470) decreased the serotonin-induced contraction in the GK rats but not in the Wistar rats, and the difference in such contraction was abolished with this treatment. In GK rats, phenylephrine-induced contraction exhibited a leftward shift and U46619-induced contraction was greater still. Phenylephrine- and U46619-induced contractions were reduced by GSK2334470 in both groups. These results suggest, for the first time, that the contribution of PDK1 is different among 3 vasoconstrictors and that PDK1 contributed to increased serotonin-induced contraction in the carotid arteries of GK rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29235243>A waiting time of 7 min is sufficient to reduce bleeding in oculoplastic surgery following the administration of epinephrine together with local anaesthesia.</a></h2><p>The time taken to reach maximal haemostatic effect following local anaesthesia with epinephrine is generally believed to be <10 min. This is based on clinical experience and indirect measurements of perfusion using methods such as laser Doppler flowmetry and oxygen spectroscopy. However, the only study in which bleeding has been measured quantitatively in an intra-operative setting in humans showed that the full haemostatic effect was not achieved until 30 min after anaesthesia. The aim of this study was to determine the time taken to reach maximum haemostatic effect when using epinephrine for local anaesthesia in oculoplastic surgery.Intra-operative bleeding following infiltration anaesthesia with either lidocaine 20 mg/ml (2%) or lidocaine + epinephrine 12.5 μg/ml (1:80 000) was measured after 7, 15 and 30 min in the eyelids of 16 patients undergoing upper eyelid blepharoplasty.Bleeding was decreased by 74.6% (with 95% CI, 6.16-87.6%) 7 min after the injection of lidocaine + epinephrine (p = 0.0048) compared with lidocaine without epinephrine. There was no further decrease in bleeding after 15 or 30 min (p = n.s.).The optimal time for skin incision in eyelid surgery is within 7 min of injection of lidocaine with epinephrine.

The study groups included diabetic rats receiving vehicle, apigenin (75 mg/kg/day, orally), GW9662 (1 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneally), and a combination of apigenin and GW9662 for 14 days. The MI was induced in all the study groups except the diabetic control group by subcutaneous injection of 100 mg/kg/day of isoproterenol on the two terminal days. The  and isoproterenol-induced MI was evident as a reduction in the maximal positive and negative rate of developed left ventricular pressure and an increase in the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. The activities of creatine kinase on myocardial bundle (CK-MB) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were also reduced. Apigenin treatment prevented the hemodynamic perturbations, restored the left ventricular function and reinstated a balanced redox status. It protected rats against an MI by attenuating myonecrosis, edema, cell death, and oxidative stress. GW9662, a PPAR-γ antagonist reversed the myocardial protection conferred by apigenin. Further, an increase in the PPAR-γ expression in the myocardium of the rats receiving apigenin reinforces the role of PPAR-γ pathway activation in the cardioprotective effects of apigenin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29126873>Dual role of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B in the progression and reversion of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in Western countries. Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a negative modulator of insulin and cytokine signaling, is a therapeutic target for type 2  and obesity. We investigated the impact of PTP1B deficiency during NAFLD, particularly in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).NASH features were evaluated in livers from wild-type (PTP1BWT) and PTP1B-deficient (PTP1BKO) mice fed methionine/choline-deficient diet (MCD) for 8 weeks. A recovery model was established by replacing MCD to chow diet (CHD) for 2-7 days. Non-parenchymal liver cells (NPCs) were analyzed by flow cytometry. Oval cells markers were measured in human and mouse livers with NASH, and in oval cells from PTP1BWT and PTP1BKO mice.PTP1BWT mice fed MCD for 8 weeks exhibited NASH, NPCs infiltration, and elevated Fgf21, Il6 and Il1b mRNAs. These parameters decreased after switching to CHD. PTP1B deficiency accelerated MCD-induced NASH. Conversely, after switching to CHD, PTP1BKO mice rapidly reverted NASH compared to PTP1BWT mice in parallel to the normalization of serum triglycerides (TG) levels. Among NPCs, a drop in cytotoxic natural killer T (NKT) subpopulation was detected in PTP1BKO livers during recovery, and in these conditions M2 macrophage markers were up-regulated. Oval cells markers (EpCAM and cytokeratin 19) significantly increased during NASH only in PTP1B-deficient livers. HGF-mediated signaling and proliferative capacity were enhanced in PTP1BKO oval cells. In NASH patients, oval cells markers were also elevated.PTP1B elicits a dual role in NASH progression and reversion. Additionally, our results support a new role for PTP1B in oval cell proliferation during NAFLD.Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

The effect of prolonged caloric restriction on ECs in relation to fat distribution and cardiac function is still unknown. Therefore, our aim was to investigate this relationship in obese T2D patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).In a prospective intervention study, obese T2D patients with CAD (n = 27) followed a 16 week very low calorie diet (VLCD; 450-1000 kcal/day). Cardiac function and fat accumulation were assessed with MRI and spectroscopy. Plasma levels of lipid species, including ECs, were measured using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.VLCD decreased plasma levels of virtually all measured lipid species of the class of N-acylethanolamines including the EC anandamide (AEA; -15%, p = 0.016), without decreasing monoacylglycerols including the EC 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). Baseline plasma AEA levels strongly correlated with the volume of subcutaneous white adipose tissue (SAT; R = 0.44, p < 0.001). VLCD decreased the volume of SAT (-53%, p < 0.001), visceral white adipose tissue (VAT) (-52%, p < 0.001), epicardial white adipose tissue (-15%, p < 0.001) and paracardial white adipose tissue (-28%, p < 0.001). VLCD also decreased hepatic (-86%, p < 0.001) and myocardial (-33%, p < 0.001) fat content. These effects were accompanied by an increased left ventricular ejection fraction (54.8 ± 8.7-56.2 ± 7.9%, p = 0.016).Caloric restriction in T2D patients with CAD decreases AEA levels, but not 2-AG levels, which is paralleled by decreased lipid accumulation in adipose tissue, liver and heart, and improved cardiovascular function. Interestingly, baseline AEA levels strongly correlated with SAT volume. We anticipate that dietary interventions are worthwhile strategies in advanced T2D, and that reduction in AEA may contribute to the improved cardiometabolic phenotype induced by weight loss.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28736253>Selective ER-α agonist alleviates vascular endothelial dysfunction in ovariectomized type 2 diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>Postmenopausal diabetic women represent a specific risk group with a greater incidence of vascular deficits as compared with age-matched men or non-diabetic women. 17β-estradiol is the mainstay therapy for menopause and associated complications; however, its vasculoprotective effect is lost in women with .

A significant impairment in glycemic and lipid profile, decreased ACh-induced endothelium dependent relaxation, impaired endothelial integrity, and rise in inflammatory and oxidative stress markers were observed in ovariectomized type 2 diabetic rats as compared to sham rats. These markers were further correlated with aortic eNOS levels. Treatment with selective ER-α receptor agonist markedly while 17β-estradiol partially ameliorated these alterations along with enhanced aortic eNOS levels. However, ER-β agonist did not show any effect.

To date, the topic is not fully understood and few studies conducted have used biomarker indicators of health. We investigated whether the association between alcohol abuse and biomarkers of the neuroendocrine system vary between black or African American and White respondents aged 34-84 from the Midlife in the United States Study (MIDUS) II (2004-2006) (n=1129). Alcohol abuse was assessed with a modified version of the Michigan Alcohol Screening Test. Ordinary least squared (OLS) regression was used to evaluate whether race moderated the associations between alcohol abuse and four biomarkers-urinary cortisol and serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), epinephrine and norepinephrine-and two composite summary scores, each consisting of two components that characterize the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA)-axis and sympathetic nervous systems (SNS), respectively. Covariates included age, sex, education, income, current drinking, smoking, exercise, fast food consumption, heart disease, blood pressure, , body mass index, medication use, anxiety/depression, sleep duration, and cholesterol markers. Race significantly moderated the associations between alcohol abuse and norepinephrine concentration (χ [1]=4.48, p=0.034) and the SNS composite score (χ [1]=5.83, p=0.016). Alcohol abuse was associated with higher mean norepinephrine levels (b=0.26, standard error (SE)=0.12, p=0.034) and SNS composite score (b=0.23, SE=0.11, p=0.016) for African Americans compared to Whites. Interestingly, for Whites a paradoxical association between alcohol abuse, norepinephrine and SNS levels was observed; those who abused alcohol had lower mean norepinephrine levels than non-abusers. Race differences in neuroendocrine response could be biological pathways that contribute the excess risk of chronic disease and mortality attributed to alcohol abuse among African Americans compared to Whites.

There is now strong evidence that microbes resident in the human intestine can directly contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity and associated cardiometabolic disorders. In fact, gut microbes represent a filter of our greatest environmental exposure - the foods we consume. It is now clear that we each experience a given meal differently, based on our unique gut microbial communities. Biologically active gut microbe-derived metabolites, such as short chain fatty acids, secondary bile acids, and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), are now uniquely recognized as contributors to obesity and related cardiometabolic disorders. However, mechanistic insights into how microbe-derived metabolites promote obesity are largely unknown. Recent work has demonstrated that the meta-organismal production of the bacterial co-metabolite TMAO is linked to suppression of beiging of white adipose tissue in mice and humans. Furthermore, the TMAO pathway is becoming an increasingly attractive therapeutic target in obesity-associated diseases such as type 2 , kidney failure, and cardiovascular disease. In this commentary we discuss recent findings linking the TMAO pathway to obesity-associated disorders, and provide additional insights into potential mechanisms driving this microbe-host interaction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30359371>N-substituted phenylbenzamides of the niclosamide chemotype attenuate obesity related changes in high fat diet fed mice.</a></h2><p>Obesity and insulin resistance are primary risk factors for Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is generally exhibited by non-progressive simple steatosis. However, a significant subset of patient's progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that is defined by the presence of steatosis, inflammation and hepatocyte injury with fibrosis. Unfortunately, there are no approved therapies for NAFLD or NASH and therefore therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Niclosamide is an U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anthelmintic drug that mediates its effect by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation. Niclosamide and its salt forms, Niclosamide  (NEN), and Niclosamide Piperazine (NPP) have shown efficacy in murine models of diet induced obesity characterized by attenuation of the prominent fatty liver disease phenotype and improved glucose metabolism. While the exact mechanism(s) underlying these changes remains unclear, the ability to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation leading to increased energy expenditure and lipid metabolism or attenuation of PKA mediated glucagon signaling in the liver have been proposed. Unfortunately, niclosamide has very poor water solubility, leading to low oral bioavailability. This, in addition to mitochondrial uncoupling activity and potential genotoxicity have reduced enthusiasm for its clinical use. More recently, salt forms of niclosamide, NEN and NPP, have demonstrated improved oral bioavailability while retaining activity. This suggests that development of safer more effective niclosamide derivatives for the treatment of NAFLD and Type 2  may be possible. Herein we explored the ability of a series of N-substituted phenylbenzamide derivatives of the niclosamide salicylanilide chemotype to attenuate hepatic steatosis using a novel phenotypic in vitro model of fatty liver and the high fat diet-fed mouse model of diet induced obesity. These studies identified novel compounds with improved pre-clinical properties that attenuate hepatic steatosis in vitro and in vivo. These compounds with improved drug properties may be useful in alleviating symptoms and protection against disease progression in patients with metabolic syndrome and NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27940403>Markers of sympathetic nervous system activity associate with complex plasma lipids in metabolic syndrome subjects.</a></h2><p>Plasma sphingolipids including ceramides, and gangliosides are associated with insulin resistance (IR) through effects on insulin signalling and glucose metabolism. Our studies of subjects with metabolic syndrome (MetS) showed close relationships between IR and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity including arterial norepinephrine (NE). We have therefore investigated possible associations of IR and SNS activity with complex lipids that are involved in both insulin sensitivity and neurotransmission.We performed a cross-sectional assessment of 23 lipid classes/subclasses (total 339 lipid species) by tandem mass spectrometry in 94 overweight untreated subjects with IR (quantified by HOMA-IR, Matsuda index and plasma insulin).Independently of IR parameters, several circulating complex lipids associated significantly with arterial NE and NEFA (non-esterified fatty acids) and marginally with heart rate (HR). After accounting for BMI, HOMA-IR, systolic BP, age, gender, and correction for multiple comparisons, these associations were significant (p < 0.05): NE with ceramide, phosphatidylcholine, alkyl- and alkenylphosphatidylcholine and free cholesterol; NEFA with mono- di- and trihexosylceramide, G ganglioside, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine, alkyl- and alkenylphosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol and free cholesterol; HR marginally (p = or <0.1>0.05) with ceramide, G ganglioside, sphingomyelin, lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, lysophosphatidylinositol and free cholesterol. Multiple subspecies of these lipids significantly associated with NE and NEFA. None of the IR biomarkers associated significantly with lipid classes/subclasses after correction for multiple comparisons.This is the first demonstration that arterial norepinephrine and NEFA, that reflect both SNS activity and IR, associate significantly with circulating complex lipids independently of IR, suggesting a role for such lipids in neural mechanisms operating in MetS.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The relative importance of phosphorylation at Ser259/Ser498 versus Ser279 in HDAC5 regulation is also controversial. We aimed to determine the impact of β-AR stimulation on the phosphorylation, localization, and function of cardiomyocyte HDAC5 and delineate underlying molecular mechanisms.A novel 3-dimensional confocal microscopy method that objectively quantifies the whole-cell nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution of green fluorescent protein tagged HDAC5 revealed the β-AR agonist isoproterenol to induce β-AR-mediated and protein kinase A-dependent HDAC5 nuclear accumulation in adult rat cardiomyocytes, which was accompanied by dephosphorylation at Ser259/279/498. Mutation of Ser259/Ser498 to Ala promoted HDAC5 nuclear accumulation and myocyte enhancer factor-2 inhibition, whereas Ser279 ablation had no such effect and did not block isoproterenol-induced nuclear accumulation. Inhibition of the Ser/Thr phosphatase PP2A blocked isoproterenol-induced HDAC5 dephosphorylation. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed a specific interaction of HDAC5 with the PP2A targeting subunit B55α, as well as catalytic and scaffolding subunits, which increased >3-fold with isoproterenol. Knockdown of B55α in neonatal cardiomyocytes attenuated isoproterenol-induced HDAC5 dephosphorylation.β-AR stimulation induces HDAC5 nuclear accumulation in cardiomyocytes by a mechanism that is protein kinase A-dependent but requires B55α-PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of Ser259/Ser498 rather than protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of Ser279.© 2017 The Authors.

This article highlights current literature suggesting the contributory role of intestinal phospholipid metabolism toward cardiometabolic disease manifestation.Group 1b phospholipase A2 (PLA2g1b) catalyzes phospholipid hydrolysis in the intestinal lumen. The digestive product lysophospholipid, particularly lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), has a direct role in mediating chylomicron assembly and secretion. The LPC in the digestive tract is further catabolized into lysophosphatidic acid and choline via autotaxin-mediated and autotaxin-independent mechanisms. The LPC and lysophosphatidic acid absorbed through the digestive tract and transported to the plasma directly promote systemic inflammation and cell dysfunction, leading to increased risk of cardiovascular disease and obesity/. The choline moiety generated in the digestive tract can also be used by gut bacteria to generate trimethylamine, which is subsequently transported to the liver and oxidized into trimethylamine-N-oxide that also enhances atherosclerosis and cardiovascular abnormalities.Products of phospholipid metabolism in the intestine through PLA2g1b and autotaxin-mediated pathways directly contribute to cardiometabolic diseases through multiple mechanisms. The implication of these studies is that therapeutic inhibition of PLA2g1b and autotaxin in the digestive tract may be a viable approach for cardiovascular and metabolic disease intervention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30226996>Insulin regulates GLUT4 in the ventromedial hypothalamus to restore the sympathoadrenal response to hypoglycemia in diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>It is proposed that the impaired counterregulatory response (CRR) to hypoglycemia in insulin-deficient  may be due to chronic brain insulin deficiency. To test this hypothesis, streptozotocin-induced diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats were infused with insulin (3 mU/day) or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) bilaterally into the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) for 2 wk and compared with nondiabetic rats. Rats underwent hyperinsulinemic (50 mU·kg·min)-hypoglycemic (~45 mg/dl) clamps. Diabetic rats demonstrated an impaired CRR to hypoglycemia, noted by a high glucose infusion rate and blunted epinephrine and glucagon responses. The defective sympathoadrenal response was restored by chronic infusion of insulin into the VMH. Diabetic rats had decreased VMH Akt phosphorylation and decreased VMH glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) content, which was also restored by chronic infusion of insulin into the VMH. Separate experiments in nondiabetic rats in which GLUT4 translocation into the VMH was inhibited with an infusion of indinavir were notable for an impaired CRR to hypoglycemia, indicated by increased glucose infusion rate and diminished epinephrine and glucagon responses. Results suggest that, in this model of , VMH insulin deficiency impairs the sympathoadrenal response to hypoglycemia and that chronic infusion of insulin into the VMH is sufficient to normalize the sympathoadrenal response to hypoglycemia via restoration of GLUT4 expression in the VMH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27581577>Dietary Methyl Donors Contribute to Whole-Body Protein Turnover and Protein Synthesis in Skeletal Muscle and the Jejunum in Neonatal Piglets.</a></h2><p>The neonatal methionine requirement must consider not only the high demand for rapid tissue protein expansion but also the demands as the precursor for a suite of critical transmethylation reactions. However, methionine metabolism is inherently complex because upon transferring its methyl group during transmethylation, methionine can be reformed by the dietary methyl donors choline (via betaine) and folate.We sought to determine whether dietary methyl donors contribute to methionine availability for protein synthesis in neonatal piglets.Yucatan miniature piglets aged 4-8 d were fed a diet that provided 38 μg folate/(kg·d), 60 mg choline/(kg·d), and 238 mg betaine/(kg·d) [methyl-sufficient (MS); n = 8] or a diet devoid of these methyl precursors [methyl-deficient (MD); n = 8]. After 5 d, dietary methionine was reduced from 0.30 to 0.20 g/(kg·d) in both groups. On day 6, piglets received a constant [1-C]phenylalanine infusion to measure whole-body protein kinetics, and on day 8 they received a constant [H-methyl]methionine infusion to measure tissue-specific protein synthesis in skeletal muscle, the liver, and the jejunum.Whole-body phenylalanine flux, protein synthesis, and protein breakdown were 13%, 12%, and 22% lower, respectively, in the MD group than in the MS group (P < 0.05). Reduced whole-body protein synthesis in the MD piglets was attributed to 50% lower protein synthesis in skeletal muscle and the jejunum than in the MS piglets (P < 0.05). Furthermore, methionine availability in skeletal muscle was halved in piglets fed the MD diet (P < 0.05), and the specific radioactivity of methionine was doubled in the jejunum of MD piglets (P < 0.05), suggesting lower intestinal remethylation. Liver protein synthesis did not significantly differ between the groups, but secreted proteins were not measured.Dietary methyl donors can affect whole-body and tissue-specific protein synthesis in neonatal piglets and should be considered when determining the methionine requirement.© 2016 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30146176>Molecular reductions in glucokinase activity increase counter-regulatory responses to hypoglycemia in mice and humans with .</a></h2><p>Appropriate glucose levels are essential for survival; thus, the detection and correction of low blood glucose is of paramount importance. Hypoglycemia prompts an integrated response involving reduction in insulin release and secretion of key counter-regulatory hormones glucagon and epinephrine that together promote endogenous glucose production to restore normoglycemia. However, specifically how this response is orchestrated remains to be fully clarified. The low affinity hexokinase glucokinase is found in glucose-sensing cells involved in glucose homeostasis including pancreatic β-cells and in certain brain areas. Here, we aimed to examine the role of glucokinase in triggering counter-regulatory hormonal responses to hypoglycemia, hypothesizing that reduced glucokinase activity would lead to increased and/or earlier triggering of responses.Hyperinsulinemic glucose clamps were performed to examine counter-regulatory responses to controlled hypoglycemic challenges created in humans with monogenic  resulting from heterozygous glucokinase mutations (GCK-MODY). To examine the relative importance of glucokinase in different sensing areas, we then examined responses to clamped hypoglycemia in mice with molecularly defined disruption of whole body and/or brain glucokinase.GCK-MODY patients displayed increased and earlier glucagon responses during hypoglycemia compared with a group of glycemia-matched patients with type 2 . Consistent with this, glucagon responses to hypoglycemia were also increased in I366F mice with mutated glucokinase and in streptozotocin-treated β-cell ablated diabetic I366F mice. Glucagon responses were normal in conditional brain glucokinase-knockout mice, suggesting that glucagon release during hypoglycemia is controlled by glucokinase-mediated glucose sensing outside the brain but not in β-cells. For epinephrine, we found increased responses in GCK-MODY patients, in β-cell ablated diabetic I366F mice and in conditional (nestin lineage) brain glucokinase-knockout mice, supporting a role for brain glucokinase in triggering epinephrine release.Our data suggest that glucokinase in brain and other non β-cell peripheral hypoglycemia sensors is important in glucose homeostasis, allowing the body to detect and respond to a falling blood glucose.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

PREX1 and PREX2 GEF activity is activated by the second messengers PIP3 and Gβγ, and further regulation of PREX GEF activity occurs by phosphorylation. Stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinases by neuregulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) leads to the phosphorylation of PREX1; however, the kinases that phosphorylate PREX1 downstream of these ligands are not known. We recently reported that the p21-activated kinases (PAKs), which are activated by GTP-bound Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1), mediate the phosphorylation of PREX2 after insulin receptor activation. Here we show that certain phosphorylation events on PREX1 after insulin, neuregulin, and IGF1 treatment are PAK-dependent and lead to a reduction in PREX1 binding to PIP3 Like PREX2, PAK-mediated phosphorylation also negatively regulates PREX1 GEF activity. Furthermore, the onset of PREX1 phosphorylation was delayed compared with the phosphorylation of AKT, supporting a model of negative feedback downstream of PREX1 activation. We also found that the phosphorylation of PREX1 after isoproterenol and prostaglandin E2-mediated GPCR activation is partially PAK-dependent and likely also involves protein kinase A, which is known to reduce PREX1 function. Our data point to multiple mechanisms of PREX1 negative regulation by PAKs within receptor tyrosine kinase and GPCR-stimulated signaling pathways that have important roles in diseases such as  and cancer.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825046>Dietary choline and betaine intakes and risk of total and lethal prostate cancer in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study.</a></h2><p>Two prior cohort studies suggested that choline, but not betaine intake, is associated with an increased risk of advanced prostate cancer (PCa). Given that evidence remains limited, we evaluated whether intakes of choline and derivative betaine are associated with total and lethal PCa risk and PCa death in men with PCa.We included 6,528 men (24.4% African American) without a cancer diagnosis at baseline (1987-1989) followed through 2012. Dietary intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire coupled with a nutrient database. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazards ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of total and lethal PCa risk overall and by race.Choline intake was not associated with total (n = 811) or lethal (n = 95) PCa risk overall or by race. Betaine intake was inversely associated with lethal (tertile 3 vs 1, HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.35-1.00, p trend = 0.04), but not total PCa risk; patterns for lethal PCa were similar by race. Neither nutrient was associated with PCa death in men with PCa.Choline intake was not associated with total or lethal PCa or with PCa death in men with PCa. Betaine intake was inversely associated with lethal, but not total PCa risk or with PCa death in men with PCa. Our results do not support the hypothesis that higher choline intake increases lethal PCa risk, but do suggest that higher betaine intake may be associated with lower lethal PCa risk.

Hyper-reactivity did not alter the response of trachea to ACh but affected the response to IP which was further reduced in hyper-reactive animals with . The ASM response to IP after glybenclamide treatment did not alter in hyper-reactive guinea pigs and diabetic guinea pigs with hyper-reactive airways, suggesting damage to the EpDHF pathway.

Time course, Na-dependency, and kinetics of [H]choline uptake were investigated. Effects of cationic drugs on the uptake of [H]choline, cell viability, and caspase-3/7 activity were also examined. Finally, we investigated the influence of choline uptake inhibitor, hemicholinium-3 (HC-3), and choline deficiency on cell viability and caspase-3/7 activity.Choline transporter-like protein 1 (CTL1) and CTL2 mRNA and protein were highly expressed in RASFs and were localized to the plasma membrane. [H]Choline uptake occurred via a Na-independent and pH-dependent transport system. The cells have two different [H]choline transport systems, high- and low-affinity. Various organic cations, HC-3 and choline deficiency inhibited both [H]choline uptake and cell viability, and enhanced the caspase-3/7 activity. The functional inhibition of choline transporters could promote apoptotic cell death. In RASFs, [H]choline uptake was significantly increased compared with that in OASFs without a change in gene expression.These results suggest that CTL1 (high-affinity) and CTL2 (low-affinity) are highly expressed in RASFs and choline may be transported by a choline/Hantiport system.

We first examined whether SNS activity toward discrete adipose depots changes in response to a weight loss diet in mice. We found that SNS activity toward each adipose depot is unique in timing, pattern of activation, and habituation with the most dramatic contrast between visceral and subcutaneous adipose depots. Sympathetic drive toward visceral epididymal adipose is more than doubled early in weight loss and then suppressed later in the diet when weight loss plateaued. Coincident with the decline in SNS activity toward visceral adipose is an increase in activity toward subcutaneous depots indicating a switch in lipolytic sources. In response to calorie restriction, SNS activity toward retroperitoneal and brown adipose depots is unaffected. Finally, pharmacological blockage of sympathetic activity on adipose tissue using the β3-adrenergic receptor antagonist, SR59230a, suppressed loss of visceral adipose mass in response to diet. These findings indicate that SNS activity toward discrete adipose depots is dynamic and potentially hierarchical. This pattern of sympathetic activation is required for energy liberation and loss of adipose tissue in response to calorie-restricted diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28012803>Airway and Pulmonary β-Adrenergic Vasodilatory Function in Current Smokers and Never Smokers.</a></h2><p>Cigarette smoking has been associated with diminished vasodilatory function in the airway circulation. It is possible that cigarette smoking similarly affects the pulmonary circulation before resting pulmonary circulatory abnormalities become manifested. The aim of this study was to compare the acute effect of inhaled albuterol on airway and pulmonary hemodynamic function as an index of β-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilation in smokers and never smokers.In 30 adults, airway and pulmonary vascular function was assessed before and 15 min after albuterol inhalation (270 μg). From mean systemic arterial pressure, cardiac output, airway blood flow, and mean pulmonary arterial pressure, airway vascular resistance (AVR) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) were derived.Albuterol induced a substantial drop in mean (± SE) PVR (-67.2% ± 5%), with no difference between groups. In contrast, the albuterol-induced decrease in AVR was significantly greater in never smokers than in smokers (-28.6% ± 3% vs -3.1% ± 6%; P < .02).These results are consistent with a dysfunction in a β-adrenergic signaling pathway mediating vasorelaxation in the airway circulation of current smokers. The vasodilatory deficit in the airway circulation but not in the pulmonary circulation could be related to local differences in the impact of cigarette smoke on the vascular endothelium.Copyright © 2016 American College of Chest Physicians.

Although diabetic cardiac autonomic neuropathy (DCAN) is the primary cause of death in diabetic patients, its pathogenesis remains to be fully elucidated. Baicalin is a flavonoid extracted from Scutellaria baicalensis root and has antibacterial, diuretic, anti-inflammatory, anti- metamorphotic, and antispasmodic effects. Our study explored the effects of baicalin on enhancing sympathoexcitatory response induced by DCAN via the P2Y12 receptor.A type 2  rat model was induced by a combination of diet and streptozotocin. Serum epinephrine was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured using the indirect tail-cuff method. Heart rate variability was analyzed using the frequency-domain of electrocardiogram recordings. The expression levels of P2Y12, interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and connexin 43 (Cx43) were determined by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. The interaction between baicalin and P2Y12 determined using by molecular docking.Baicalin alleviated elevated blood pressure and heart rate, improved heart rate variability, and decreased the elevated expression levels of P2Y12, IL-1β, TNF-α, and Cx43 in the stellate ganglia of diabetic rats. Baicalin also reduced the elevated concentration of serum epinephrine and the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in diabetic rats.Baicalin decreases sympathetic activity by inhibiting the P2Y12 receptor in stellate ganglia satellite glial cells to maintain the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves and relieves DCAN in the rat.© 2018 The Author(s).

We investigated whether changes in gut microbiota-dependent metabolite of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and its nutrient precursors (choline and L-carnitine) were associated with improvements in glucose metabolism and -related amino acids in a weight-loss diet intervention.We included 504 overweight and obese adults who were randomly assigned to one of four energy-reduced diets varying in macronutrient intake. The 6-month changes (Δ) in TMAO, choline and L-carnitine levels after the intervention were calculated.Greater decreases in choline and L-carnitine were significantly (p<0.05) associated with greater improvements in fasting insulin concentrations and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) at 6 months. The reduction of choline was significantly related to 2-year improvements in glucose and insulin resistance. We found significant linkages between dietary fat intake and ΔTMAO for changes in fasting glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR (p <0.05); a greater increase in TMAO was related to lesser improvements in the outcomes among participants who consumed a high-fat diet. In addition, ΔL-carnitine and Δcholine were significantly related to changes in amino acids (including branched-chain and aromatic amino acids). Interestingly, the associations of ΔTMAO, Δcholine and ΔL-carnitine with -related traits were independent of the changes in amino acids.Our findings underscore the importance of changes in TMAO, choline and L-carnitine in improving insulin sensitivity during a weight-loss intervention for obese patients.

The vasodilator effect of salbutamol, a β-adrenoceptor agonist, on retinal arterioles was significantly diminished 2 weeks after the induction of . In non-diabetic rats, vasodilator responses to salbutamol were significantly reduced after an intravitreal injection of iberiotoxin, a blocker of large-conductance K (BK) channels. However, this effect was not observed in diabetic rats. Probucol had no significant effect on salbutamol-induced changes in diameter of retinal arterioles in non-diabetic rats, whereas it could prevent the attenuation of retinal vasodilator response to salbutamol in diabetic rats. These results suggest that the reduced function of BK channels is involved in the attenuation of β-adrenoceptor-mediated retinal vasodilation in diabetic rats. Probucol preserves the BK channel function in retinal arterioles under diabetic conditions; therefore, it may show beneficial effects on diabetic retinopathy by preventing or slowing the impairment of the retinal circulation in patients with .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27820654>The Consistency in Macronutrient Oxidation and the Role for Epinephrine in the Response to Fasting and Overfeeding.</a></h2><p>In humans, dietary vs intraindividual determinants of macronutrient oxidation preference and the role of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) during short-term overfeeding and fasting are unclear.To understand the influence on metabolic changes of diet and SNS during 24 hours of overfeeding.While residing on a clinical research unit, 64 participants with normal glucose regulation were assessed during energy balance, fasting, and four 24-hour overfeeding diets, given in random order. The overfeeding diets contained 200% of energy requirements and varied macronutrient proportions: (1) standard (50% carbohydrate, 20% protein, and 30% fat); (2) 75% carbohydrate; (3) 60% fat; and (4) 3% protein.Twenty-four-hour energy expenditure (EE) and macronutrient oxidation rates were measured in an indirect calorimeter during the dietary interventions, with concomitant measurement of urinary catecholamines and free cortisol.EE decreased with fasting (-7.7% ± 4.8%; P < 0.0001) and increased with overfeeding. The smallest increase occurred during consumption of the diet with 3% protein (2.7% ± 4.5%; P = 0.001) and the greatest during the diet with 75% carbohydrate (13.8 ± 5.7%; P < 0.0001). Approximately 60% of macronutrient oxidation was determined by diet and 20% by intrinsic factors (P < 0.0001). Only urinary epinephrine differed between fasting and overfeeding diets (Δ = 2.25 ± 2.9 µg/24h; P < 0.0001). During fasting, higher urinary epinephrine concentrations correlated with smaller reductions in EE (ρ = 0.34; P = 0.01).Independent from dietary macronutrient proportions, there is a strong individual contribution to fuel preference that remains consistent across diets. Higher urinary epinephrine levels may reflect the importance of epinephrine in maintaining EE during fasting.ClinicalTrials.gov .Copyright © 2017 by the Endocrine Society</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28430139>The Metalloproteinase ADAM28 Promotes Metabolic Dysfunction in Mice.</a></h2><p>Obesity and  are major causes of morbidity and mortality globally. The current study builds upon our previous association studies highlighting that A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase 28 (ADAM28) appears to be implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity and type 2  in humans. Our novel study characterised the expression of ADAM28 in mice with the metabolic syndrome and used molecular inhibition approaches to investigate the functional role of ADAM28 in the pathogenesis of high fat diet-induced obesity. We identified that ADAM28 mRNA and protein expression was markedly increased in the livers of mice with the metabolic syndrome. In addition, noradrenaline, the major neurotransmitter of the sympathetic nervous system, results in elevated  mRNA expression in human monocytes. Downregulation of ADAM28 with siRNA technology resulted in a lack of weight gain, promotion of insulin sensitivity/glucose tolerance and decreased liver tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels in our diet-induced obesity mouse model as well as reduced blood urea nitrogen, alkaline phosphatase and aspartate aminotransferase. In addition, we show that ADAM28 knock-out mice also displayed reduced body weight, elevated high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and reductions in blood urea nitrogen, alkaline phosphatase, and aspartate aminotransferase. The results of this study provide important insights into the pathogenic role of the metalloproteinase ADAM28 in the metabolic syndrome and suggests that downregulation of ADAM28 may be a potential therapeutic strategy in the metabolic syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28054648>Niclosamide reduces glucagon sensitivity via hepatic PKA inhibition in obese mice: Implications for glucose metabolism improvements in type 2 .</a></h2><p>Type 2  (T2D) is a global pandemic. Currently, the drugs used to treat T2D improve hyperglycemic symptom of the disease but the underlying mechanism causing the high blood glucose levels have not been fully resolved. Recently published data showed that salt form of niclosamide improved glucose metabolism in high fat fed mice via mitochondrial uncoupling. However, based on our previous work we hypothesised that niclosamide might also improve glucose metabolism via inhibition of the glucagon signalling in liver in vivo. In this study, mice were fed either a chow or high fat diet containing two different formulations of niclosamide (niclosamide  salt - NENS or niclosamide - Nic) for 10 weeks. We identified both forms of niclosamide significantly improved whole body glucose metabolism without altering total body weight or body composition, energy expenditure or insulin secretion or sensitivity. Our study provides evidence that inhibition of the glucagon signalling pathway contributes to the beneficial effects of niclosamide (NENS or Nic) on whole body glucose metabolism. In conclusion, our results suggest that the niclosamide could be a useful adjunctive therapeutic strategy to treat T2D, as hepatic glucose output is elevated in people with T2D and current drugs do not redress this adequately.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29935093>Nebivolol ameliorated kidney damage in Zucker diabetic fatty rats by regulation of oxidative stress/NO pathway: Comparison with captopril.</a></h2><p>The aim was to evaluate the effects and mechanisms of nebivolol on renal damage in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, in comparison with those of atenolol and captopril. Animals were divided into: control lean Zucker rats, ZDF rats, ZDF rats orally treated with nebivolol (10 mg/kg), atenolol (100 mg/kg) or captopril (40 mg/kg) for 6 months. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), blood glucose, kidney structure and function, plasma and kidney levels of nitric oxide (NO) and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), and oxidant status were evaluated. Kidney expressions of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), NADPH oxidase (NOX) isoforms 2 and 4 and subunit p22 , nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms, endothelial NOS (eNOS) uncoupling, protein arginine N-methyltransferase (PRMT) 1, and dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) 1 and 2 were tested. All drugs induced a similar control of SBP. Nebivolol did not affect the increased plasma glucose. Unlike atenolol, nebivolol prevented the decrease in plasma insulin, and, like captopril, it reduced plasma lipid contents. Nebivolol ameliorated, to a greater extent than captopril, damages to renal structure and function, which were associated with an improvement in interlobular artery dysfunction. Nebivolol elevated kidney phosphorylation of AMPK, attenuated NOX4 and p22 expression and oxidative stress marker levels. Nebivolol increased plasma and renal NO, enhanced expressions of eNOS, p-eNOS and neuronal NOS, and suppressed eNOS uncoupling and inducible NOS expression. High ADMA in plasma and kidney were decreased by nebivolol through increasing DDAH2 and decreasing protein arginine N-methyltransferase 1. Long-term treatment of nebivolol ameliorated diabetic nephropathy, at least in part, via regulation of renal oxidative stress/NO pathway.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29408994>Impact of C-Peptide Status on the Response of Glucagon and Endogenous Glucose Production to Induced Hypoglycemia in T1DM.</a></h2><p>Complete loss of β-cell function in patients with type 1  (T1DM) may lead to an increased risk of severe hypoglycemia.We aimed to determine the impact of C-peptide status on glucagon response and endogenous glucose production (EGP) during hypoglycemia in patients with T1DM.We conducted an open, comparative trial.Ten C-peptide positive (C-pos) and 11 matched C-peptide negative (C-neg) patients with T1DM were enrolled.Plasma glucose was normalized over the night fast, and after a steady-state (baseline) plateau all patients underwent a hyperinsulinemic, stepwise hypoglycemic clamp with glucose plateaus of 5.5, 3.5, and 2.5 mmol/L and a recovery phase of 4.0 mmol/L. Blood glucagon was measured with a specific and highly sensitive glucagon assay. EGP was determined with a stable isotope tracer technique.Impact of C-peptide status on glucagon response and EGP during hypoglycemia.Glucagon concentrations were significantly lower in C-pos and C-neg patients than previously reported. At baseline, C-pos patients had higher glucagon concentrations than C-neg patients (8.39 ± 4.6 vs 4.19 ± 2.4 pmol/L, P = 0.016, mean ± standard deviation) but comparable EGP rates (2.13 ± 0.2 vs 2.04 ± 0.3 mg/kg/min, P < 0.391). In both groups, insulin suppressed glucagon levels, but hypoglycemia revealed significantly higher glucagon concentrations in C-pos than in C-neg patients. EGP was significantly higher in C-pos patients at hypoglycemia (2.5 mmol/L) compared with C-neg patients.Glucagon concentrations and EGP during hypoglycemia were more pronounced in C-pos than in C-neg patients, which indicates that preserved β-cell function may contribute to counterregulation during hypoglycemia in patients with T1DM.ClinicalTrials.gov .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28418448>β-Blocker Exposure in Pregnancy and Risk of Fetal Cardiac Anomalies.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28586510>A 10-second sprint does not blunt hormonal counter-regulation to subsequent hypoglycaemia.</a></h2><p>To investigate whether a 10-second (s) sprint impairs the counter-regulatory response to subsequent hypoglycaemia.Nine people (five male, four female) with Type 1 , aged 21.1 ± 4.5 years, performed a 10-s rest or a 10-s maximum-effort sprint in random order on different days, while subjected to an euinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp.

We examined respiratory and systemic effects following exposure to a sensory irritant acrolein to elucidate the systemic and pulmonary consequences in healthy and diabetic rat models. Male Wistar and Goto Kakizaki (GK) rats, a nonobese type II diabetic Wistar-derived model, were exposed by inhalation to 0, 2, or 4 ppm acrolein, 4 h/d for 1 or 2 days. Exposure at 4 ppm significantly increased pulmonary and nasal inflammation in both strains with vascular protein leakage occurring only in the nose. Acrolein exposure (4 ppm) also caused metabolic impairment by inducing hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance (GK > Wistar). Serum total cholesterol (GKs only), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (both strains), and free fatty acids (GK > Wistar) levels increased; however, no acrolein-induced changes were noted in branched-chain amino acid or insulin levels. These responses corresponded with a significant increase in corticosterone and modest but insignificant increases in adrenaline in both strains, suggesting activation of the HPA axis. Collectively, these data demonstrate that acrolein exposure has a profound effect on nasal and pulmonary inflammation, as well as glucose and lipid metabolism, with the systemic effects exacerbated in the metabolically impaired GKs. These results are similar to ozone-induced responses with the exception of lung protein leakage and ability to alter branched-chain amino acid and insulin levels, suggesting some differences in neuroendocrine regulation of these two air pollutants.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society of Toxicology 2017.

We sought to define the risks of neonatal hypoglycemia and bradycardia associated with maternal exposure to β blockers at the time of delivery in a large, nationwide cohort of Medicaid beneficiaries.We used a cohort of 2 292 116 completed pregnancies linked to liveborn infants of Medicaid-enrolled women from 2003 to 2007. We examined the risks of neonatal hypoglycemia and neonatal bradycardia associated with maternal exposure to β blockers at the time of delivery. Propensity score matching was used to control for potential confounders including maternal demographics, obstetric and medical conditions, and exposure to other medications.There were 10 585 (0.5%) pregnancies exposed to β blockers at the time of delivery. The risk of neonatal hypoglycemia was 4.3% in the β blocker-exposed neonates versus 1.2% in the unexposed; the risk of neonatal bradycardia was 1.6% in the exposed versus 0.5% in the unexposed. After controlling for confounders, risk remained elevated for both neonatal hypoglycemia and bradycardia among exposed pregnancies versus unexposed (adjusted odds ratio, 1.68, 95% confidence interval, 1.50-1.89 and adjusted odds ratio, 1.29, 95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.55, respectively).Our findings suggest that neonates born to mothers exposed to β blockers in late pregnancy, including labetalol, are at elevated risk for neonatal hypoglycemia and bradycardia.Copyright © 2016 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30100044>Impaired coronary contraction to phenylephrine after cardioplegic arrest in diabetic patients.</a></h2><p>We have previously found that hyperkalemic cardioplegic arrest in the setting of cardiopulmonary bypass (CP/CPB) is associated with impairment of the coronary arteriolar response to phenylephrine in nondiabetic (ND) patients.

Hypoglycemia increased leukocyte numbers in healthy control participants and patients with NAH but not in patients with IAH. Leukocytosis strongly correlated with the adrenaline response to hypoglycemia. Ex vivo, PBMCs and monocytes displayed a more robust cytokine response to microbial stimulation after hypoglycemia compared with euglycemia, although it was less pronounced in patients with IAH. Of note, hypoglycemia increased the expression of markers of demargination and inflammation in PBMCs. We conclude that hypoglycemia promotes mobilization of specific leukocyte subsets from the marginal pool and induces proinflammatory functional changes in immune cells. Inflammatory responses were less pronounced in IAH, indicating that counterregulatory hormone responses are key modulators of hypoglycemia-induced proinflammatory effects.

Here, the authors report the use of a deep eutectic solvent, choline and geranate (CAGE), to enhance topical delivery of proteins such as bovine serum albumin (BSA, molecular weight: ≈66 kDa), ovalbumin (OVA, molecular weight: ≈45 kDa) and insulin (INS, molecular weight: 5.8 kDa). CAGE enhances permeation of BSA, OVA, and insulin into porcine skin ex vivo, penetrating deep into the epidermis and dermis. Studies using tritium-labeled BSA and fluorescein isothiocyanate labeled insulin show significantly enhanced delivery of proteins into and across porcine skin, penetrating the skin in a time-dependent manner. Fourier transform IR spectra of porcine stratum corneum (SC) samples before and after incubation in CAGE show a reduction in peak area attributed to SC lipid content, suggesting lipid extraction from the SC. Circular dichroism confirms that CAGE does not affect insulin's secondary conformation. In vivo studies in rats show that topical application of 10 U insulin dispersed in CAGE (25 U kg insulin dose) leads to a highly significant 40% drop in blood glucose levels in 4 h that is relatively sustained for 12 h.

[F]FCh-PET parameters (maximum standardized uptake value: SUV in early phase (after 2 min) and late phase (after 50 min), metabolic volume, and adenoma-to-background ratio (ABR), preoperative laboratory results (PTH and serum calcium concentration), and postoperative histopathology (location, size, volume, and weight of adenoma) were assessed. Relationship of PET parameters, laboratory parameters, and histopathological parameters was assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman correlation coefficient. MRI characteristics of parathyroid adenomas were also analyzed.The majority of patients underwent a PET/MR scan, 42 patients (80.7 %); 10 patients (19.3 %) underwent PET/CT. We found a strong positive correlation between late-phase SUV and preoperative PTH level (r = 0.768, p < 0.001) and between late-phase ABR and preoperative PTH level (r = 0.680, p < 0.001). The surgical specimen volume was positively correlated with the PET/MR lesion volume (r = 0.659, p < 0.001). No significant association was observed between other [F]FCh-PET parameters, laboratory parameters, and histopathological findings. Cystic adenomas were larger than non-cystic adenomas (p = 0.048).[F]FCh uptake of parathyroid adenomas is strongly correlated with preoperative PTH serum concentration. Therefore, the preoperative PTH level might potentially be able to predict success of [F]FCh-PET imaging in hyperparathyroidism, with higher lesion-to-background ratios being expected in patients with high PTH. PET/MR is accurate in estimating the volume of parathyroid adenomas.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28589447>Cognitive, neurophysiologic and metabolic sequelae of previous hypoglycemic coma revealed by hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamp in type 1 diabetic patients.</a></h2><p>To examine the relationship between electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and hypoglycemia unawareness, we investigated early parameters of vigilance and awareness of various symptom categories in response to hypoglycemia in intensively treated type 1 diabetic (T1DM) patients with different degrees of hypoglycemia unawareness. Hypoglycemia was induced with a hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamp in six T1DM patients with a history of hypoglycemia unawareness previous severe hypoglycemic coma (SH) and in six T1DM patients without (C) history of hypoglycemia unawareness previous severe hypoglycemic coma. Cognitive function tests (four choice reaction time), counterregulatory responses (adrenaline), and symptomatic responses were evaluated at euglycemia (90 mg/dl) and during step-wise plasma glucose reduction (68, 58 and 49 mg/dl). EEG activity was recorded continuously throughout the study and analyzed by spectral analysis. Cognitive function deteriorated significantly at a glucose threshold of 55 ± 1 mg/dl in both groups (p = ns) during hypoglycemia, while the glucose threshold for autonomic symptoms was significantly lower in SH patients than in C patients (49 ± 1 vs. 54 ± 1 mg/dl, p < 0.05, respectively). In SH patients, eye-closed resting EEG showed a correlation between the mean dominance frequency and plasma glucose (r = 0.62, p < 0.001). Theta relative power increased during controlled hypoglycemia compared to euglycemia (21.6 ± 6 vs. 15.5 ± 3% Hz p < 0.05) and was higher than in the C group (21.6 ± 6 vs. 13.8 ± 3%, p < 0.03). The cognitive task beta activity was lower in the SH group than in the C group (14.8 ± 3 Hz, vs. 22.6 ± 4 vs. p < 0.03). Controlled hypoglycemia elicits cognitive dysfunction in both C and SH patients; however, significant EEG alterations during hypoglycemia were detected mainly in patients with a history of hypoglycemia unawareness and previous severe hypoglycemic coma. These data suggest that prior episodes of hypoglycemic coma modulate brain electric activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28270520>Functional Human Beige Adipocytes From Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells.</a></h2><p>Activation of thermogenic beige adipocytes has recently emerged as a promising therapeutic target in obesity and . Relevant human models for beige adipocyte differentiation are essential to implement such therapeutic strategies. We report a straightforward and efficient protocol to generate functional human beige adipocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Without overexpression of exogenous adipogenic genes, our method recapitulates an adipogenic developmental pathway through successive mesodermal and adipogenic progenitor stages. hiPSC-derived adipocytes are insulin sensitive and display beige-specific markers and functional properties, including upregulation of thermogenic genes, increased mitochondrial content, and increased oxygen consumption upon activation with cAMP analogs. Engraftment of hiPSC-derived adipocytes in mice produces well-organized and vascularized adipose tissue, capable of β-adrenergic-responsive glucose uptake. Our model of human beige adipocyte development provides a new and scalable tool for disease modeling and therapeutic screening.© 2017 by the American  Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29519157>Cardioprotective effect of vitamin D on isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>To assess the effect of vitamin D and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms on acute myocardial injury induced by isoproterenol (ISO) in diabetic rats.Rats were divided into control rats, diabetic rats (DM), diabetic rats received ISO (DM-ISO), and diabetic rats pretreated with vitamin D and received ISO (DM-D-ISO).Vitamin D pretreatment significantly decreased fasting glucose and myocardial malondialdehyde, associated with increased insulin, myocardial glutathione and superoxide dismutase in DM-D-ISO versus DM-ISO.

Here we demonstrate that sensory food perception is sufficient to elicit early activation of hepatic mTOR signaling, Xbp1 splicing, increased expression of ER-stress genes, and phosphatidylcholine synthesis, which translate into a rapid morphological ER remodeling. These responses overlap with those activated during refeeding, where they are maintained and constantly increased upon nutrient supply. Sensory food perception activates POMC neurons in the hypothalamus, optogenetic activation of POMC neurons activates hepatic mTOR signaling and Xbp1 splicing, whereas lack of MC4R expression attenuates these responses to sensory food perception. Chemogenetic POMC-neuron activation promotes sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) subserving the liver, and norepinephrine evokes the same responses in hepatocytes in vitro and in liver in vivo as observed upon sensory food perception. Collectively, our experiments unravel that sensory food perception coordinately primes postprandial liver ER adaption through a melanocortin-SNA-mTOR-Xbp1s axis.

The purposes of this study were to examine the effects of ivabradine (IBD) on cardiac function and plasma NE and BNP-45 after chronic ischemic heart failure (CHF) in non-diabetic rats and diabetic rats. We further determined if sympathetic NE uptake-1 (a major pathway to metabolize NE) mechanism is responsible for the role played by IBD.We ligated rat's coronary artery to induce CHF; and injected streptozotocin (STZ) to induce diabetic hyperglycemia. Echocardiography was employed to determine cardiac function. We used ELISA to examine plasma NE and BNP-45; and Western Blot analysis to examine the protein levels of NE uptake-1 in sympathetic nerves.CHF increased the levels of NE and BNP-45 in non-STZ rats and STZ rats. Systemic injection of IBD significantly attenuated the augmented NE and BNP-45 and impaired left ventricular function induced by CHF in those rats. This effect appeared to be less in STZ rats. A liner relation was observed between the NE/BNP-45 levels and left ventricular function after administration of IBD. Also, IBD was observed to have a recovery effect on the downregulated NE uptake-1 evoked by CHF, but to a smaller degree in STZ rats.Our data revealed specific signaling mechanisms by which IBD improves the cardiac function as IBD alleviates impaired NE uptake-1and thereby decreases heightened NE and BNP-45 induced by CHF. Our data also demonstrated that the effects of IBD are weakened after diabetic hyperglycemia likely due to worsen NE uptake-1 pathway. Thus, targeting sympathetic NE uptake-1 signaling molecules has clinical implications for treatment and management of CHF in . Our data were also to shed light on strategies for application of this drug because NE and BNP play an important role in regulation of progression and prognosis of CHF, and in particular, because IBD affects NE uptake-1 pathway in hyperglycemic animals to a less degree.© 2016 The Author(s) Published by S.

However, it is not known whether the nervous system can regulate the production of inflammatory myeloid cells from hematopoietic progenitor cells in disease conditions. Myeloid cell numbers in diabetic patients were strongly correlated with plasma concentrations of norepinephrine, suggesting the role of sympathetic neuronal activation in myeloid cell production. The spleens of diabetic patients and mice contained higher numbers of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-expressing leukocytes that produced catecholamines. Granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMPs) expressed the β adrenergic receptor, a target of catecholamines. Ablation of splenic sympathetic neuronal signaling using surgical, chemical, and genetic approaches diminished GMP proliferation and myeloid cell development. Finally, mice lacking TH-producing leukocytes had reduced GMP proliferation, resulting in diminished myelopoiesis. Taken together, our study demonstrates that catecholamines produced by leukocytes and sympathetic nerve termini promote GMP proliferation and myeloid cell development.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The mTOR signal pathway is closely related to DKD. This study was performed to determine the renal protection of niclosamide  salt (NEN) which was identified as mTOR inhibitor.Type 2  (T2D) db/db mice were used and divided into db/db and db/db + NEN groups. Lean wild type mice served as T2D-control. NEN treatment lasted for 12 weeks. The kidney morphological changes, urine indices, blood glucose and metabolic symptoms were evaluated. In addition, the effects of NEN on kidney mitochondria and mTOR/4E-BP pathway were also measured.NEN could prevent diabetic kidney hypertrophy and alleviate glomerular mesangial expansion, attenuate GBM and TBM thickening in db/db mice. It also restored podocyte dysfunction, reduced urinary albumin, NAG, NGAL, and TGF-β1 excretion. Specifically, it could uncouple kidney mitochondria and significantly inhibit renal cortical activation of mTOR/4E-BP1 pathway.This study demonstrated that NEN could improve kidney injury in db/db mice and has the potential to translate to future clinical studies.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Mitochondrial uncoupling, which reduces intracellular lipid loads and corrects the underlying cause of insulin resistance, has emerged as a promising anti-obese and anti-diabetic intervention. Niclosamide is an anthelmintic drug approved by the US FDA with the mechanism of action that uncouples mitochondria of parasitic worms. Recently, niclosamide  salt (NEN) was found to be a safe and effective hepatic mitochondrial uncoupler for the prevention and treatment of obesity and T2D in mouse models. The striking features of NEN prompt us to examine the anti-obese and anti-diabetic efficacy of other salt forms of niclosamide, with the ultimate goal to identify a suitable salt formulation for future clinical development. Here, we report the study with niclosamide piperazine salt (NPP), another salt form of niclosamide with documented safety profile.Mitochondrial uncoupling activity of NEN and NPP were determined by oxygen consumption assay with Seahorse XF24e Analyzer, as well as by mitochondrial membrane potential measurement in cultured cells. The in vivo anti-diabetic and anti-obesity activities were determined in C57BL/6J mice fed high-fat diet (HFD) or HFD containing 2000 ppm. NPP for 11 weeks.Niclosamide piperazine salt showed a comparable mitochondrial uncoupling activity to NEN. Oral administration of NPP significantly reduced HFD-induced obesity, hyperglycemia and hepatic steatosis, and sensitized the insulin responses in mice.Niclosamide piperazine salt may hold the promise to become an alternative to NEN as a drug lead for the treatment of obesity and T2D.

An upregulation of the early growth response protein-1 (Egr-1) expression has been linked with the development of atherosclerosis and intimal hyperplasia. We have recently demonstrated that angiotensin-II (Ang-II) stimulates Egr-1 expression via Ca/ERK-mediated cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) activation. However, whether Ang-II-induced signaling leading to Egr-1 expression is modulated by cAMP remains unexplored. Therefore, in the present studies, we have examined the effect of cAMP on Ang-II-induced expression of Egr-1 and associated signaling pathways. Isoproterenol (ISO) and forskolin (FSK) attenuated Ang-II-induced Egr-1 expression in a dose-dependent fashion. In addition, dibutyryl-cAMP and benzoyl-cAMP, as well as isobutylmethylxanthine, attenuated Ang-II-induced Egr-1 expression. Moreover, inhibition of Ang-II-induced Egr-1 expression was accompanied by an increase in the phosphorylation of the vasodilator-activated phosphoprotein (VASP), and this was associated with a concomitant decrease in ERK phosphorylation. Blockade of PKA using H89 decreased VASP phosphorylation, restored Ang-II-induced ERK phosphorylation, and abolished ISO- and FSK-mediated inhibition of Ang-II-induced Egr-1 expression. In summary, these results suggest that PKA-mediated suppression of Ang-II-induced Egr-1 expression and phosphorylation of ERK may be among the mechanisms by which cAMP exerts its vasculoprotective effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29567661>Quality Control of Serum and Plasma by Quantification of (4E,14Z)-Sphingadienine-C18-1-Phosphate Uncovers Common Preanalytical Errors During Handling of Whole Blood.</a></h2><p>Nonadherence to standard operating procedures (SOPs) during handling and processing of whole blood is one of the most frequent causes affecting the quality of serum and plasma. Yet, the quality of blood samples is of the utmost importance for reliable, conclusive research findings, valid diagnostics, and appropriate therapeutic decisions.UHPLC-MS-driven nontargeted metabolomics was applied to identify biomarkers that reflected time to processing of blood samples, and a targeted UHPLC-MS analysis was used to quantify and validate these biomarkers.We found that (4E,14Z)-sphingadienine-C18-1-phosphate (S1P-d18:2) was suitable for the reliable assessment of the pronounced changes in the quality of serum and plasma caused by errors in the phase between collection and centrifugation of whole blood samples. We rigorously validated S1P-d18:2, which included the use of practicality tests on >1400 randomly selected serum and plasma samples that were originally collected during single- and multicenter trials and then stored in 11 biobanks in 3 countries. Neither life-threatening disease states nor strenuous metabolic challenges (i.e., high-intensity exercise) affected the concentration of S1P-d18:2. Cutoff values for sample assessment were defined (plasma, ≤0.085 μg/mL; serum, ≤0.154 μg/mL).Unbiased valid monitoring to check for adherence to SOP-dictated time for processing to plasma or serum and/or time to storage of whole blood at 4 °C is now feasible. This novel quality assessment step could enable scientists to uncover common preanalytical errors, allowing for identification of serum and plasma samples that should be excluded from certain investigations. It should also allow control of samples before long-term storage in biobanks.© 2018 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27512975>Interrupting prolonged sitting with brief bouts of light walking or simple resistance activities reduces resting blood pressure and plasma noradrenaline in type 2 .</a></h2><p>Prolonged sitting is increasingly recognized as a ubiquitous cardiometabolic risk factor, possibly distinct from lack of physical exercise. We examined whether interrupting prolonged sitting with brief bouts of light-intensity activity reduced blood pressure (BP) and plasma noradrenaline in type 2  (T2D).In a randomized crossover trial, 24 inactive overweight/obese adults with T2D (14 men; mean ± SD; 62 ± 6 years) consumed standardized meals during 3 × 8 h conditions: uninterrupted sitting (SIT); sitting + half-hourly bouts of walking (3.2 km/h for 3-min) (light-intensity walking); and sitting + half-hourly bouts of simple resistance activities for 3 min (SRAs), each separated by 6-14 days washout. Resting seated BP was measured hourly (mean of three recordings, ≥20-min postactivity). Plasma noradrenaline was measured at 30-min intervals for the first hour after meals and hourly thereafter.Compared with SIT, mean resting SBP and DBP were significantly reduced (P < 0.001) for both light-intensity walking (mean ± SEM; -14 ± 1/-8 ± 1 mmHg) and SRA (-16 ± 1/-10 ± 1 mmHg), with a more pronounced effect for SRA (P < 0.05 versus light-intensity walking). Similarly, mean plasma noradrenaline was significantly reduced for both light-intensity walking (-0.3 ± 0.1 nmol/l) and SRA (-0.6 ± 0.1 nmol/l) versus SIT, with SRA lower than light-intensity walking (P < 0.05). Mean resting heart rate was lowered by light-intensity walking (-3 ± 1 bpm; P < 0.05), but not SRA (-1 ± 1 bpm).Interrupting prolonged sitting with brief bouts of light-intensity walking or SRA reduces resting BP and plasma noradrenaline in adults with T2D, with SRA being more effective.

However, the role of insulin-responsive GLUT4 in the central nervous system has not been well characterized. To assess its importance, a selective knockout of brain GLUT4 (BG4KO) was generated by crossing Nestin-Cre mice with GLUT4-floxed mice. BG4KO mice had a 99% reduction in GLUT4 protein expression throughout the brain. Despite normal feeding and fasting glycemia, BG4KO mice were glucose intolerant, demonstrated hepatic insulin resistance, and had reduced glucose uptake in the brain. In response to hypoglycemia, BG4KO mice had impaired glucose sensing, noted by impaired epinephrine and glucagon responses and impaired  activation in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. Moreover, in vitro glucose sensing of glucose-inhibitory neurons from the ventromedial hypothalamus was impaired in BG4KO mice. In summary, BG4KO mice are glucose intolerant, insulin resistant, and have impaired glucose sensing, indicating a critical role for brain GLUT4 in sensing and responding to changes in blood glucose.© 2017 by the American  Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29626526>Differential modulation of white adipose tissue endocannabinoid levels by n-3 fatty acids in obese mice and type 2 diabetic patients.</a></h2><p>n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) might regulate metabolism by lowering endocannabinoid levels. We examined time-dependent changes in adipose tissue levels of endocannabinoids as well as in parameters of glucose homeostasis induced by n-3 PUFA in dietary-obese mice, and compared these results with the effect of n-3 PUFA intervention in type 2 diabetic (T2DM) subjects. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed for 8, 16 or 24 weeks a high-fat diet alone (cHF) or supplemented with n-3 PUFA (cHF + F). Overweight/obese, T2DM patients on metformin therapy were given for 24 weeks corn oil (Placebo; 5 g/day) or n-3 PUFA concentrate as above (Omega-3; 5 g/day). Endocannabinoids were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass-spectrometry. Compared to cHF-fed controls, the cHF + F mice consistently reduced 2-arachidonoylglycerol (up to ~2-fold at week 24) and anandamide (~2-fold) in adipose tissue, while the levels of endocannabinoid-related anti-inflammatory molecules N-eicosapentaenoyl  (EPEA) and N-docosahexaenoyl  (DHEA) increased more than ~10-fold and ~8-fold, respectively. At week 24, the cHF + F mice improved glucose tolerance and fasting blood glucose, the latter being positively correlated with adipose 2-arachidonoylglycerol levels only in obese cHF-fed controls, like fasting insulin and HOMA-IR. In the patients, n-3 PUFA failed to reduce 2-arachidonoylglycerol and anandamide levels in adipose tissue and serum, but they increased both adipose tissue and serum levels of EPEA and DHEA. In conclusion, the inability of n-3 PUFA to reduce adipose tissue and serum levels of classical endocannabinoids might contribute to a lack of beneficial effects of these lipids on glucose homeostasis in T2DM patients.Copyright © 2018.

However, the precise nature of this association has not been clearly established. We hypothesized that GDM may affect one-carbon nutrients concentrations in the fetus, thus possibly participating in epigenetic programing of the offspring. Maternal blood was collected at recruitment (12-16 weeks). At delivery (28-42 weeks), both maternal and cord blood were collected. Blood concentrations of one-carbon nutrients and their metabolites were compared between the two groups. A total of 368 women were included in the study, of whom 19 (5.6%) were later diagnosed with GDM. No significant differences were found in maternal blood concentrations of one-carbon nutrients and their metabolites between the GDM and control groups at recruitment or at delivery. In cord blood, however, serum folate (87.7 [IQR 70.4-103.9] vs 66.6 [IQR 45.5-80.3] nmol/L, P = .025) and plasma TMAO (2.82 [IQR 1.3-3.2] vs 1.35 [IQR 1.0-2.0] μmol/L, P = .017) concentrations were higher, while plasma betaine concentrations were lower (17.5 [IQR 16.3-19.4] vs 21.1 [IQR 18.0-24.1] μmol/L, P = .019) in infants born to mothers with GDM compared with control. Our data suggest that while maternal blood concentrations of one-carbon nutrients and their metabolites may not affect the risk of GDM, GDM may alter concentrations of serum folate, plasma betaine and TMAO in cord blood. These alterations in one-carbon nutrient concentrations in fetal circulation may impact epigenetic programing, thereby contributing to physiologic changes and disease susceptibility in adulthood associated with GDM offspring.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Increased levels of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a metabolite derived from choline and L-carnitine, correlates with CVD and T2DM. However, the precise role of TMAO and its precursors in MetS remains unclear. We tested the hypothesis that choline, L-carnitine and TMAO in MetS patients without CVD or T2DM would be altered and correlate with inflammatory markers. Materials and methods This was an exploratory study of 30 patients with nascent MetS (without CVD or T2DM) and 20 matched controls. MetS was defined by the Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. TMAO and its precursors were evaluated from each patient's frozen early morning urine samples and quantified using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS). These amines were correlated with a detailed repertoire of biomarkers of inflammation and adipokines. Results L-carnitine was significantly increased (p = 0.0002) compared to controls. There was a trend for a significant increase in TMAO levels (p = 0.08). Choline was not significantly altered in MetS. L-carnitine correlated significantly with soluble tumor necrosis factor 1 (sTNFR1) and leptin, and inversely to adiponectin. TMAO correlated with IL-6, endotoxin and chemerin. Neither choline, nor L-carnitine significantly correlated with TMAO. Conclusion L-carnitine is directly correlated with markers of inflammation in nascent MetS. Cellular L-carnitine could be a biomediator or marker of inflammation in the pathogenesis of MetS, and the sequelae of CVD and T2DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27860160>Effect of one week of CPAP treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea on 24-hour profiles of glucose, insulin and counter-regulatory hormones in type 2 .</a></h2><p>Studies examining the impact of CPAP treatment on glycaemic control have yielded conflicting results, partly because of insufficient nightly CPAP use. We examined the 24-hour profiles of glucose, insulin and counter-regulatory hormones in 12 subjects with type 2  and OSA before and after 1 week of effective in-laboratory CPAP therapy over an entire 8-hour night thus ensuring optimal CPAP compliance. Blood samples were collected every 15 to 30 minutes for 24 hours under controlled conditions. The 24-hour mean glucose decreased from 153.2 ± 33.0 to 139.7 ± 24.2 mg/dL with CPAP (-13.5 ± 13.5 mg/dL; P = .005) without change in insulin levels. Morning fasting glucose levels decreased by 14.6 ± 3 mg/dL (P = .001) and the dawn phenomenon decreased by 7.8 ± 9.8 mg/dL (P = .019). CPAP treatment decreased norepinephrine levels while the 24-hour profiles of growth hormone and cortisol remained unchanged. In conclusion, 1 week of effective treatment of OSA over an entire 8-hour night results in a clinically significant improvement in glycaemic control via an amelioration of evening fasting glucose metabolism and a reduction in the dawn phenomenon, a late-night glucose increase that is not adequately treated by oral medications.

Yet, few studies have examined the relations of different body fat compartments to urinary and serum metabolites. Anthropometric phenotypes (visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), the ratio between VAT and SAT (VSR), body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC)) and urinary and serum metabolite concentrations measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy were measured in a population-based sample of 228 healthy adults. Multivariable linear and logistic regression models, corrected for multiple testing using the false discovery rate, were used to associate anthropometric phenotypes with metabolites. We adjusted for potential confounding variables: age, sex, smoking, physical activity, menopausal status, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinary glucose, and fasting status. In a fully adjusted logistic regression model dichotomized for the absence or presence of quantifiable metabolite amounts, VAT, BMI and WC were inversely related to urinary choline (ß = -0.18, p = 2.73*10-3), glycolic acid (ß = -0.20, 0.02), and guanidinoacetic acid (ß = -0.12, p = 0.04), and positively related to  (ß = 0.18, p = 0.02) and dimethylamine (ß = 0.32, p = 0.02).

Despite its worldwide prevalence, there are no effective drugs for the treatment of NASH. The progression of NASH is mainly accelerated by reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced lipotoxicity. The transcription factor known as nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is pivotal for the elimination of ROS. Accordingly, activators of Nrf2 have been implicated as promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of NASH. Niclosamide ( salt; NEN), a drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), is currently used as an anthelmintic drug for the treatment of parasitic infections. Recently, NEN was shown to improve hepatic steatosis in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. However, the underlying mechanism of its antioxidant function in NASH remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that NEN induces AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of p62 at S351 that can lead to noncanonical Nrf2 activation. We also demonstrate that NEN protects cells and mouse liver from acute lipotoxic stress through activating p62-dependent Keap1-Nrf2 pathway. Taken together, NEN can be used for clinical applications and has the potential to provide a new therapeutic option for NASH.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Generally, glycine is synthesized from choline, serine, hydroxyproline, and threonine through interorgan metabolism in which kidneys and liver are the primarily involved. Generally in common feeding conditions, glycine is not sufficiently synthesized in humans, animals, and birds. Glycine acts as precursor for several key metabolites of low molecular weight such as creatine, glutathione, haem, purines, and porphyrins. Glycine is very effective in improving the health and supports the growth and well-being of humans and animals. There are overwhelming reports supporting the role of supplementary glycine in prevention of many diseases and disorders including cancer. Dietary supplementation of proper dose of glycine is effectual in treating metabolic disorders in patients with cardiovascular diseases, several inflammatory diseases, obesity, cancers, and . Glycine also has the property to enhance the quality of sleep and neurological functions. In this review we will focus on the metabolism of glycine in humans and animals and the recent findings and advances about the beneficial effects and protection of glycine in different disease states.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28543947>β -Adrenoceptor, but not β -adrenoceptor, subtype regulates heart rate in type 2 diabetic rats in vivo.</a></h2><p>What is the central question of the study? The sympathetic system regulates heart rate via β-adrenoceptors; this is impaired during . However, the specific β-adrenoceptor subtype contributions in heart rate regulation in  in vivo are unknown. What is the main finding and its importance? Telemetric recordings in conscious non-diabetic and type 2 diabetic rats demonstrated that the β -adrenoceptor subtype, and not the β -adrenoceptor, regulated the lower resting heart rate and increased β-adrenoceptor responsiveness in  in vivo. This provides new physiological insight into the dysregulation of heart rate in type 2 , which is important for improving therapeutic strategies targeting the diabetic chronotropic incompetence. β-Adrenoceptor blockers are widely used to reduce heart rate, the strongest predictor of mortality in cardiac patients, but are less effective in diabetic patients. This study aimed to determine the specific contributions of β - and β -adrenoceptor subtypes to chronotropic responses in type 2  in vivo, which are currently unknown. Type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic rats were implanted with radiotelemeters to measure arterial blood pressure and derive heart rate in conscious conditions. Vascular access ports were implanted to inject isoprenaline (β - and β -adrenoceptor agonist, 0.1-300 μg kg ) in the presence of atenolol (β -adrenoceptor antagonist, 2000 μg kg ) or nadolol (β - and β -adrenoceptor agonist, 4000 μg kg ) to determine the chronotropic contributions of the β-adrenoceptor subtypes. Resting heart rate was reduced in diabetic rats (388 ± 62 versus 290 ± 37 beats min non-diabetic versus diabetic, P < 0.05, mean ± SD), which remained after atenolol or nadolol administration. Overall β-adrenoceptor chronotropic responsiveness was increased in diabetic rats (change in heart rate at highest dose of isoprenaline: 135 ± 66 versus 205 ± 28 beats min , non-diabetic versus diabetic, P < 0.05), a difference that diminished after β -adrenoceptor blockade with atenolol (change in heart rate at highest dose of isoprenaline: 205 ± 37 versus 195 ± 22 beats min , non-diabetic versus diabetic, P < 0.05). In conclusion, the β -adrenoceptor is the main subtype to modulate chronotropic β-adrenoceptor responses in healthy and diabetic rats. This study provides new insights into the pathological basis of dysregulation of heart rate in type 2 , which could be important for improving the current therapeutic strategies targeting diabetic chronotropic incompetence.© 2017 The Authors.

In streptozotocin-treated mouse ventricular myocardium, which had longer duration of action potential than that in control mice, the negative inotropic response induced by phenylephrine was smaller than that in control mice. 4-Aminopyridine prolonged the action potential duration and decreased the negative inotropy in control mice. Cromakalim shortened the action potential duration and increased the negative inotropy in streptozotocin-treated mice. These results suggest that the reduced α-adrenoceptor-mediated inotropy in the diabetic mouse myocardium is partly due to its prolonged action potential.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a poor trigger of AA mobilization in macrophages but does have the capacity to prime these cells for greatly increased AA release upon subsequent stimulation. In this work, we have studied molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. By using mass spectrometry-based lipidomic analyses, we show in this work that LPS-primed zymosan-stimulated macrophages exhibit an elevated consumption of a particular phospholipid species, i.e., the  plasmalogens, which results from reduced remodeling of phospholipids  coenzyme A-independent transacylation reactions. Importantly however, LPS-primed macrophages show no changes in their capacity to directly incorporate AA into phospholipids  CoA-dependent acylation reactions. The essential role for  plasmalogen hydrolysis in LPS priming is further demonstrated by the use of plasmalogen-deficient cells. These cells, while responding normally to zymosan by releasing quantities of AA similar to those released by cells expressing normal plasmalogen levels under the same conditions, fail to show an LPS-primed response to the same stimulus, thus unambiguously demonstrating a cause-effect relationship between LPS priming and plasmalogen hydrolysis. Collectively, these results suggest a hitherto unrecognized role for  plasmalogen hydrolysis and CoA-independent transacylation reactions in modulating the eicosanoid biosynthetic response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27587548>The effect of hypoxia and re-oxygenation on adipose tissue lipolysis in COPD patients.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29705701>Protective role of AgRP neuron's PDK1 against salt-induced hypertension.</a></h2><p>In the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC), orexigenic agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons regulate feeding behavior and energy homeostasis. The 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) in AgRP neurons serves as a major signaling molecule for leptin and insulin, the hormones regulating feeding behavior, energy homeostasis and circulation. However, it is unclear whether PDK1 in AGRP neurons is also involved in regulation of blood pressure. This study explored it by generating and analyzing AgRP neuron-specific PDK1 knockout (Agrp-Pdk1) mice and effect of high salt diet on blood pressure in KO and WT mice was analyzed. Under high salt diet feeding, systolic blood pressure (SBP) of Agrp-Pdk1 mice was significantly elevated compared to Agrp-Cre mice. When the high salt diet was switched to control low salt diet, SBP of Agrp-Pdk1 mice returned to the basal level observed in Agrp-Cre mice within 1 week. In Agrp-Pdk1 mice, urinary noradrenalin excretion and NUCB2 mRNA expression in hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) were markedly upregulated. Moreover, silencing of NUCB2 in the PVN counteracted the rises in urinary noradrenalin excretions and SBP. These results demonstrate a novel role of PDK1 in AgRP neurons to counteract the high salt diet-induced hypertension by preventing hyperactivation of PVN nesfatin-1 neurons.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Beneficial effects of increased NAD levels and sirtuin activation on mitochondrial homeostasis, organismal metabolism and lifespan have been established across species. Here we show that α-amino-β-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde decarboxylase (ACMSD), the enzyme that limits spontaneous cyclization of α-amino-β-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde in the de novo NAD synthesis pathway, controls cellular NAD levels via an evolutionarily conserved mechanism in Caenorhabditis elegans and mouse. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of ACMSD boosts de novo NAD synthesis and sirtuin 1 activity, ultimately enhancing mitochondrial function. We also characterize two potent and selective inhibitors of ACMSD. Because expression of ACMSD is largely restricted to kidney and liver, these inhibitors may have therapeutic potential for protection of these tissues from injury. In summary, we identify ACMSD as a key modulator of cellular NAD levels, sirtuin activity and mitochondrial homeostasis in kidney and liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27697526>BCKA down-regulates mTORC2-Akt signal and enhances apoptosis susceptibility in cardiomyocytes.</a></h2><p>Diabetic  (DM) portends poor prognosis concerning pressure overloaded heart disease. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), elements of essential amino acids, have been found altered in its catabolism in  decades ago. However, the relationship between BCAAs and DM induced deterioration of pressure overloaded heart disease remains controversial. This study is aimed to investigate the particular effect of BCKA, a metabolite of BCAA, on myocardial injury induced by pressure overloaded. Primary cardiomyocytes were incubated with or without BCKA and followed by treatment with isoproterenol (ISO); then cell viability was detected by CCK8 and apoptosis was examined by TUNNEL stain and caspase-3 activity analysis. Compared to non-BCKA incubated group, BCKA incubation decreased cell survival and increased apoptosis concentration dependently. Furthermore, Western blot assay showed that mTORC2-Akt pathway was significantly inactivated by BCKA incubation. Moreover, overexpression of rictor, a vital component of mTORC2, significantly abolished the adverse effects of BCKA on apoptosis susceptibility of cardiomyocytes. These results indicate that BCKA contribute to vulnerability of cardiomyocytes in stimulated stress via inactivation of mTORC2-Akt pathway.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, few studies have reported its effects of endothelial dysfunction in  and its direct effects on the aorta. Here, we investigated the effects of EPA treatment on impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation of the aorta in KKAy mice, a model of type 2 .Male KKAy mice were fed a high-fat (HF) diet for 8 weeks to induce , after which they were divided into two groups. One group was fed a HF diet, and the other group was fed a HF diet containing EPA ethyl ester (EPA-E, 10 mg/day) for 4 weeks. Then, the vascular reactivities of prepared aortic rings were measured in an organ bath to determine if EPA-E administration changed vascular function in these diabetic mice. In addition, we examined effect of EPA-E and its metabolites to vascular action using aorta separated from C57BL/6 J mice.Although EPA-E administration did not change the plasma glucose and insulin levels in diabetic mice, total cholesterol levels were significantly decreased. The aorta extracted from EPA-E untreated diabetic mice showed impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation in response to acetylcholine (ACh). However, EPA-E administration improved the relaxation response to ACh to the control levels observed in non-diabetic C57BL/6 J mice. On the other hand, endothelium-independent relaxation in response to sodium nitroprusside did not significantly differ among these three groups. The enhanced contractile response by phenylephrine in diabetic mice was not altered by the administration of EPA-E. In addition, the direct administration of EPA-E metabolites such as EPA, docosahexaenoic acid, and docosapentaenoic acid led to vasodilation in the aortic rings of C57BL/6 J mice.These results showed that chronic EPA-E administration prevented the development of endothelial dysfunction in KKAy mice, partly via the direct action of EPA-E metabolites on the aorta.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30413457>Polyglandular endocrine emergency: lessons from a patient, which a book cannot teach.</a></h2><p>A 30-year-old woman with polyglandular autoimmune type 2 syndrome was found collapsed at home with a cardiac arrest, which required direct current cardioversion.

Treatments were: (1) saline control; (2) hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia (HH; i.v. bolus of 0.1 U/kg insulin); and (3) hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemia (HE; i.v. bolus of 0.1 U/kg insulin and 20% glucose). Inclusion criteria were that volunteers were healthy, aged >18 years, had a BMI between 19 and 26 kg/m, and provided both written and oral informed consent. Exclusion criteria were the presence of a known chronic disease (including , epilepsy, ischaemic heart disease and cardiac arrhythmias) and regular use of prescription medication. The data was collected at the medical research facilities at Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark. The primary outcome was palmitic acid flux. Participants were blinded to intervention order, but caregivers were not.Adrenaline (epinephrine) and glucagon concentrations were higher during HH than during both HE and control treatments. NEFA levels and lipid oxidation rates (determined by indirect calorimetry) returned to control levels after 105 min. Palmitate flux was increased to control levels during HH (p = NS) and was more than twofold higher than during HE (overall mean difference between HH vs HE, 114 [95% CI 64, 165 μmol/min]; p < 0.001). In subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies, we found elevated levels of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and perilipin-1 phosphorylation 30 min after insulin injection during HH compared with both control and HE. There were no changes in the levels of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), comparative gene identification-58 (CGI-58) or G/G switch gene 2 (G0S2) proteins. Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR were unaffected by hypoglycaemia. Expression of the G0S2 gene increased during HE and HH compared with control, without changes in ATGL (also known as PNPLA2) or CGI-58 (also known as ABHD5) mRNA levels.These findings suggest that NEFAs become a major fuel source during insulin-induced hypoglycaemia and that lipolysis may be an important component of the counter-regulatory response. These effects appear to be mediated by rapid stimulation of protein kinase A (PKA) and HSL, compatible with activation of the β-adrenergic catecholamine signalling pathway.ClinicalTrials.gov  FUNDING: : The study was funded by Aarhus University, the Novo Nordisk Foundation and the KETO Study Group/Danish Agency for Science Technology and Innovation (grant no. 0603-00479, to NM).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30527255>The combination of luteolin and l-theanine improved Alzheimer disease-like symptoms by potentiating hippocampal insulin signaling and decreasing neuroinflammation and norepinephrine degradation in amyloid-β-infused rats.</a></h2><p>Luteolin and l-theanine have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and possible antidiabetic activities, and they may synergistically protect against dementia. Here, we hypothesized that a combination of luteolin and l-theanine would synergistically act to improve memory function and glucose disturbances in rats infused with amyloid-β, and the mechanisms underlying these actions were investigated. Rats that received an amyloid-β(25-35) infusion into the CA1 region of the hippocampus were fed dextrin (AD-CON), 0.1% luteolin (AD-Lut), 0.2% l-theanine (AD-Thea), or both 0.05% luteolin and 0.1% l-theanine (AD-LuTh) in conjunction with a high-fat diet over 8 weeks. AD-LuTh improved memory function, as determined by water maze and passive avoidance tests, by potentiating the hippocampal insulin signaling and reducing inflammation: Luteolin mainly potentiated insulin signaling via the pAkt➔pGSK➔pTau pathway, and l-theanine primarily reduced tumor necrosis factor-α. In the metabolomics analysis of the hippocampus lysates, the concentration of proline, phenylpyruvic acid, and normetanephrine decreased in the AD-LuTh compared to AD-CON. Norepinephrine contents were lower in the AD-CON than non-AD rats with a high fat diet with 0.2% dextrin, whereas AD-Thea and AD-LuTh inhibited the decrease. Both the AD-Lut and AD-LuTh increased glucose infusion rates and decreased hepatic glucose output under basal and hyperinsulinemic conditions, indicating improved whole-body and hepatic insulin sensitivity. Disturbances in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion during hyperglycemic clamp were most effectively corrected by the AD-Lut and AD-LuTh treatments. In conclusion, the hypothesis of the study was accepted. The combination of luteolin and l-theanine prevented Alzheimer disease-like symptom, possibly by improving hippocampal insulin signaling, norepinephrine metabolisms, and decreasing neuroinflammation. The combination of luteolin and l-theanine may be a useful therapeutic option for preventing and/or delaying the progression of memory dysfunction.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Mitochondrial permeability transition is implicated in necrosis, while pore closure is required for mitochondrial maturation during cardiac development. We show that loss of myocardin function leads to subendocardial necrosis at E9.5, concurrent with elevated expression of the death gene Nix. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that myocardin knockdown reduces microRNA-133a levels to allow Nix accumulation, leading to mitochondrial permeability transition, reduced mitochondrial respiration, and necrosis. Myocardin knockdown elicits calcium release from the endo/sarcoplasmic reticulum with mitochondrial calcium accumulation, while restoration of microRNA-133a function, or knockdown of Nix rescues calcium perturbations. We observed reduced myocardin and elevated Nix expression within the infarct border-zone following coronary ligation. These findings identify a myocardin-regulated pathway that maintains calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial function during development, and is attenuated during ischemic heart disease.

IUGR fetuses with placental insufficiency develop hypoxemia, elevating epinephrine and norepinephrine (NE) concentrations throughout late gestation. To isolate the programming effects of chronically elevated catecholamines, NE was continuously infused into normally grown sheep fetuses for 7 days. High plasma NE concentrations suppress insulin, but after the NE infusion was terminated, persistent hypersecretion of insulin occurred. Our objective was to identify differential gene expression with RNA sequencing (RNAseq) in fetal islets after chronic adrenergic stimulation. After determining the NE-regulated genes, we identified the subset of differentially expressed genes that were common to both islets from NE fetuses and fetuses with IUGR to delineate the adrenergic-induced transcriptional responses. A portion of these genes were investigated in mouse insulinoma (Min6) cells chronically treated with epinephrine to better approximate the β-cell response. In islets from NE fetuses, RNAseq identified 321 differentially expressed genes that were overenriched for metabolic and hormone processes, and the subset of 96 differentially expressed genes common to IUGR islets were overenriched for protein digestion, vitamin metabolism, and cell replication pathways. Thirty-eight of the 96 NE-regulated IUGR genes changed similarly between models with functional enrichment for proliferation. In Min6 cells, chronic epinephrine stimulation slowed proliferation and augmented insulin secretion after treatment. These data establish molecular mechanisms underlying persistent adrenergic stimulation in hyperfunctional fetal islets and identify a subset of genes dysregulated by catecholamines in IUGR islets that may represent programming of β-cell proliferation capacity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27876129>Metabolic syndrome - A truly psychosomatic disorder? A global hypothesis.</a></h2><p>Exact cause of the metabolic syndrome [MS], a global epidemic, is still unclear. Man has same fundamental needs to live as animals but modern man's life-style compels him to acquire certainty of resources for all his needs in a complex social network. Today money has become the sole life essential need. Contrarily none of the animals needs to earn money. Brain is also an organ of the human body with a unique thought process to define logical actions to achieve a person's goals. This way life is a flow of desires followed by logical actions. The person struggles to attain desired goals via the allostatic load but a perceived insurmountable threat can make his flow of life stalled to freeze him. Published data from varied branches of medical science indicates role of hormones in overall homeostasis. Particularly multifaceted role of serotonin is well documented. Adrenalin being the primary mediator of Cori cycle is also well known. From the integration of observations from published data with reference to common human's modern lifestyle, it is hypothesized that a perceived trapped situation in life creates acute chaos of thoughts in brain, which results in acute excess of stress hormones and concurrent depletion of resting hormones, which in turn triggers MS. In global terms, MS indicates an acute imbalance of a few hormones and implies psychosomatic roots of the disorder.

Our previous study reports that low-dose copper nanoparticles (CuNP) can halt the progression of -induced cardiotoxicity as copper has anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative and anti-oxidant potential. In addition, exercise training has also been considered a hallmark for cardiac health.Cardioprotective potential of CuNP (1mg/kg/day, po, 4 weeks) and exercise (swimming, 90min, 5days/4 weeks) either alone or in combination was estimated by measuring the surge in serum nitrite/nitrate concentration and reduction in creatine kinase MB (CKMB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), lipid profile, oxidative stress, structural abnormalities against isproterenol (ISO)-induced MI.ISO significantly increased CKMB, LDH, cTnI, lipid alteration, oxidative stress, structural abnormalities and decrease nitrite/nitrate concentration in serum. Quantitative estimation of total and phosphorylated Akt(SER-473)/GSK-3b(SER-9) indicated the significant reduction in pAkt and pGSK-3b in ISO treated animal. Individual and combined treatment of CuNP and exercise significantly reduce ISO -induced CKMB, cTnI, LDH, and improve nitrite/nitrate concentration and lipid profile. Attenuation of myocardial oxidative stress and serum TBARS revealed the associated preconditioning effect of exercise and CuNP against oxidative stress. Exercise and CuNP also showed the protective potential against structural abnormalities. However, the cardioprotective effect of individual and combined strategy of exercise and CuNP was vanished by wortmannin and also avoid the downregulation of pGSK-3b.Low-dose CuNP and exercise training significantly prevents ISO-induced MI through preconditioning and GSK-3b inhibition.

To better understand the pathophysiology of counterregulation, we aimed to determine if dextrose administration to maintain euglycemia during moderate intensity exercise alters the attenuation of counterregulatory responses to subsequent hypoglycemia in healthy adults : Counterregulatory responses to hypoglycemia were assessed in 18 healthy adults after bed rest and following exercise with (n = 9) and without (n = 9) dextrose infusion. Responses were measured during a stepped euglycemic-hypoglycemic clamp 24 h after either bed rest or two 90-min bouts of exercise at 70% peak oxygen uptake : Hypoglycemia occurred during the second bout of exercise without dextrose infusion. Plasma glucagon and epinephrine responses to stepped hypoglycemia after antecedent exercise without dextrose infusion were significantly lower at the 45 mg/dL glycemic level compared to after bed rest. However, no attenuation of the counterregulatory responses to hypoglycemia was evident after antecedent exercise when dextrose was infused. This study suggests that the attenuation of the counterregulatory responses during hypoglycemia after exercise is likely due to the hypoglycemia that occurs during moderate prolonged exercise and not solely due to exercise or its intensity.© 2016 The Authors.

Purinergic agonist and NANC relaxation responses were assessed in the presence and absence of P2X1 and P2Y1 antagonists. Protein expression of P2X1 and P2Y1 receptors was measured by western blot.Proximal and distal IPA contraction and relaxation were measured during increasing agonist administration and EFS in the presence and absence of antagonists.Proximal and distal IPA concentration response curves to phenylephrine, acetylcholine, and DEA NONOate did no differ. Interestingly, distal IPA exhibited greater EFS-mediated contraction and NANC relaxation compared with proximal IPA. Nitric oxide synthase inhibition completely inhibited distal IPA NANC relaxation but did not affect proximal IPA relaxation. P2X1 or P2Y1 receptor antagonism during NANC relaxation increased distal IPA relaxation but decreased proximal IPA relaxation. Combined P2X1 and P2Y1 receptor antagonism had no effect on proximal IPA relaxation but significantly increased distal IPA NANC relaxation.Understanding neurovascular regulation of IPA vascular tone through nitrergic and purinergic mechanisms could yield new therapeutic targets to improve IPA blood flow and treat vasculogenic erectile dysfunction.This study is the first to illustrate the differences in mechanisms responsible for regulating vascular tone in the proximal and distal IPAs. All presented findings are currently limited to ex vivo vascular function.The regulation of vascular tone differs regionally in the IPA. The distal IPA is controlled through neurotransmitter-mediated NO-dependent mechanisms and increased sensitivity to purinergic P2X1 and P2Y1 receptor inhibition. Odom MR, Pak ES, Brown DA, Hannan JL.

This diet induces a type 2 /metabolic syndrome phenotype with hypertension. In diabetic meriones, body weight increase was associated with hyperglycemia, increased insulinemia, and insulin resistance. Compared to lean meriones, diabetic meriones showed decreased aorta contraction to noradrenaline, which was normalized after NOS inhibition. Endothelium-dependent relaxation to carbachol was enhanced, while relaxing effects of the NO donor SNAP and of diazoxide were unchanged. Insulin-evoked relaxation was depressed in aorta from diabetic meriones, and L-arginine relaxed contracted arteries from diabetic meriones, but not from lean meriones. Urine NOX level and iNOS mRNA muscle expression were significantly higher in diabetic meriones compared to lean animals. These data strongly suggest that iNOS may have a pathogenic role in vascular dysfunction observed in diet-induced diabetic meriones.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28632132>Antagonistic modulation of NPY/AgRP and POMC neurons in the arcuate nucleus by noradrenalin.</a></h2><p>In the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARH) satiety signaling (anorexigenic) pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing and hunger signaling (orexigenic) agouti-related peptide (AgRP)-expressing neurons are key components of the neuronal circuits that control food intake and energy homeostasis. Here, we assessed whether the catecholamine noradrenalin directly modulates the activity of these neurons in mice. Perforated patch clamp recordings showed that noradrenalin changes the activity of these functionally antagonistic neurons in opposite ways, increasing the activity of the orexigenic NPY/AgRP neurons and decreasing the activity of the anorexigenic POMC neurons. Cell type-specific transcriptomics and pharmacological experiments revealed that the opposing effect on these neurons is mediated by the activation of excitatory α - and β- adrenergic receptors in NPY/AgRP neurons, while POMC neurons are inhibited via α - adrenergic receptors. Thus, the coordinated differential modulation of the key hypothalamic neurons in control of energy homeostasis assigns noradrenalin an important role to promote feeding.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29078377>Growth hormone-releasing hormone attenuates cardiac hypertrophy and improves heart function in pressure overload-induced heart failure.</a></h2><p>It has been shown that growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) reduces cardiomyocyte (CM) apoptosis, prevents ischemia/reperfusion injury, and improves cardiac function in ischemic rat hearts. However, it is still not known whether GHRH would be beneficial for life-threatening pathological conditions, like cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure (HF). Thus, we tested the myocardial therapeutic potential of GHRH stimulation in vitro and in vivo, using GHRH or its agonistic analog MR-409. We show that in vitro, GHRH(1-44)NH attenuates phenylephrine-induced hypertrophy in H9c2 cardiac cells, adult rat ventricular myocytes, and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived CMs, decreasing expression of hypertrophic genes and regulating hypertrophic pathways. Underlying mechanisms included blockade of Gq signaling and its downstream components phospholipase Cβ, protein kinase Cε, calcineurin, and phospholamban. The receptor-dependent effects of GHRH also involved activation of Gα and cAMP/PKA, and inhibition of increase in exchange protein directly activated by cAMP1 (Epac1). In vivo, MR-409 mitigated cardiac hypertrophy in mice subjected to transverse aortic constriction and improved cardiac function. Moreover, CMs isolated from transverse aortic constriction mice treated with MR-409 showed improved contractility and reversal of sarcolemmal structure. Overall, these results identify GHRH as an antihypertrophic regulator, underlying its therapeutic potential for HF, and suggest possible beneficial use of its analogs for treatment of pathological cardiac hypertrophy.Copyright © 2017 the Author(s).

We studied changes of choline metabolites after oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and fat tolerance test (OFTT). Eighteen healthy subjects (mean age 54.3 years; BMI 26.8 kg/m²) underwent 2 tests. First, OFTT (80 g fat) was applied and blood was collected at baseline and 4 h after OFTT. Seven days later, 75 g glucose was applied and blood was collected at baseline and 2 h after OGTT. Plasma concentrations of choline, betaine, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), dimethylglycine, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), lipids and glucose were measured. After OFTT, plasma choline declined (10.6 to 9.2 µmol/L;  = 0.004), betaine declined (33.4 to 31.7 µmol/L;  = 0.003), TMAO slightly increased (4.1 to 5.6 µmol/L;  = 0.105), glucose declined (5.39 to 4.98 mmol/L;  < 0.001), and triglycerides increased (1.27 to 2.53 mmol/L;  < 0.001). After OGTT, plasma choline increased (10.1 to 11.1 µmol/L;  < 0.001), TMAO declined (4.0 to 3.5 µmol/L;  = 0.029), dimethylglycine declined (2.0 to 1.7 µmol/L;  = 0.005), SAM declined (103 to 96 nmol/L;  = 0.041), but betaine, glucose, and SAM were unchanged. In conclusion, OFTT lowered plasma betaine and choline and caused heterogeneous changes in plasma TMAO.

Recurrent hypoglycemia alters the cascade of physiological and behavioral responses that maintain euglycemia. The extent to which these responses are normally triggered by decreased whole-brain cerebral glucose metabolism (CMR) has not been resolved by previous studies. We measured plasma counterregulatory hormonal responses and whole-brain CMR (along with blood-to-brain glucose transport rates and brain glucose concentrations) with 1-[C]-d-glucose positron emission tomography during hyperinsulinemic glucose clamps at nominal plasma glucose concentrations of 90, 75, 60, and 45 mg/dL (5.0, 4.2, 3.3, and 2.5 mmol/L) in 18 healthy young adults. Clear evidence of hypoglycemic physiological counterregulation was first demonstrated between 75 mg/dL (4.2 mmol/L) and 60 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L) with increases in both plasma epinephrine ( = 0.01) and glucagon ( = 0.01). In contrast, there was no statistically significant change in CMR ( = 1.0) between 75 mg/dL (4.2 mmol/L) and 60 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L), whereas CMR significantly decreased ( = 0.02) between 60 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L) and 45 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L). Therefore, the increased epinephrine and glucagon secretion with declining plasma glucose concentrations is not in response to a decrease in whole-brain CMR.© 2017 by the American  Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30533579>Synthesis, Purification, and Mass Spectrometric Characterization of Stable Isotope-Labeled Amadori-Glycated Phospholipids.</a></h2><p>Nonenzymatic glycation of lipids plays an important role in several physiological and pathological processes, such as normal aging and complications of . To develop liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometric (LC-MS) methods for accurate analysis of Amadori compound-glycated lipids from biological samples, it is essential to obtain isotope-labeled Amadori-lipid standards. Herein, we report optimized methods for the preparation of six stable isotope-labeled Amadori-glycated lipid standards covering four types of lipids, including [C]Amadori-phosphatidyl  (PE), -phosphatidyl serine (PS), -LysoPE, and -LysoPS. Optimal conditions for the synthesis and purification of these four types of Amadori-glycated lipids were detailed in this study. LC-MS and LC-UV analyses showed that destination products were highly purified (>95%). Accurate mass and MS/MS fragmentation in both positive- and negative-ion modes further validated the identification of these six synthetic [C]Amadori-glycated lipid standards.

The present study evaluated the actions and ability of these small-molecule agonists to counteract experimental  in mice. was induced in NIH Swiss mice by five consecutive daily intraperitoneal injections of 40 mg/(kg body weight) streptozotocin. Diabetic mice received daily oral administration of Abn-CBD or AS-1269574 (0.1 μmol/kg) or saline vehicle (0.9% wt/vol. NaCl) over 28 days. Body weight, food intake, fluid intake, plasma glucose, insulin, glucose tolerance, insulin release, lipid profile and pancreatic morphology were examined. Mechanism of action of agonists was assessed in acute studies using incretin-receptor-knockout mice.Abn-CBD and AS-1269574 decreased plasma glucose (20-26%, p < 0.05) and increased circulating insulin (47-48%, p < 0.05) by 10-28 days, compared with saline-treated diabetic controls. Food intake and polydipsia were reduced by both agonists (21-23%, p < 0.05 and 33-35%, p < 0.01, respectively). After 28 days of treatment, plasma glucagon concentrations were reduced (p < 0.01) and glucose tolerance was enhanced by 19-44% by Abn-CBD (p < 0.05 or p < 0.001) and AS-1269574 (p < 0.05 to p < 0.001). Plasma insulin responses were improved (p < 0.01) and insulin resistance was decreased (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) in both Abn-CBD- and AS-1269574-treated groups. Triacylglycerols were decreased by 19% with Abn-CBD (p < 0.05) and 32% with AS-1269574 (p < 0.01) while total cholesterol was reduced by 17% (p < 0.01) and 15% (p < 0.05), respectively.

Acute studies in Gipr- and Glp1r-knockout mice revealed an important role for the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor in the actions of both agonists, with the glucose-lowering effects of Abn-CBD also partly mediated through the glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) receptor.These data highlight the potential for fatty acid G-protein-coupled receptor-based therapies as novel insulinotropic and glucose-lowering agents acting partly through the activation of incretin receptors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27544303>Anandamide reverses depressive-like behavior, neurochemical abnormalities and oxidative-stress parameters in streptozotocin-diabetic rats: Role of CB1 receptors.</a></h2><p>The pathophysiology associated with increased prevalence of depression in diabetics is not completely understood, although studies have pointed the endocannabinoid system as a possible target. Then, we aimed to investigate the role of this system in the pathophysiology of depression associated with . For this, diabetic (DBT) male Wistar rats were intraperitoneally treated with cannabinoid CB1 (AM251, 1mg/kg) or CB2 (AM630, 1mg/kg) receptor antagonists followed by anandamide (AEA, 0.005mg/kg) and then submitted to the forced swimming test (FST). Oxidative stress parameters, CB1 receptor expression and serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline levels in the hippocampus (HIP) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) were also performed. It was observed that DBT animals presented a more pronounced depressive-like behavior and increase of CB1 receptor expression in the HIP. AEA treatment induced a significant improvement in the depressive-like behavior, which was reversed by the CB1 antagonist AM251, without affecting the hyperglycemia or weight gain. AEA was also able to restore the elevated CB1 expression and also to elevate the reduced level of 5-HT in the HIP from DBT animals. In addition, AEA restored the elevated noradrenaline levels in the PFC and induced a neuroprotective effect by restoring the decreased reduced glutathione and increased lipid hydroperoxides levels along with the decreased superoxide dismutase activity observed in HIP or PFC. Together, our data suggest that in depression associated with , the endocannabinoid anandamide has a potential to induce neuroadaptative changes able to improve the depressive-like response by its action as a CB1 receptor agonist.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.

The ability of bacteria to sense mammalian hormone may have a role in propagation of infection. The present study investigated the effect of norepinephrine on in vitro growth of uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) and the effect of silodosin on norepinephrine-induced changes. The spot urine samples were collected from 56 individuals (14 diabetic patients with UTI, 14 diabetic without UTI, 14 non-diabetic UTI and 14 healthy volunteer controls) for the measurement of urinary norepinephrine concentrations. The concentration of norepinephrine, as found in urine of human subjects, was reproduced in artificial urine medium to study the growth of UPEC. The norepinephrine concentration showing maximum growth response was selected to study the effect of silodosin on the growth inhibition of UPEC. Result showed significantly elevated urinary norepinephrine in diabetic patients with and without UTI and also in nondiabetic UTI groups. The norepinephrine concentration equivalent to that in diabetic UTI patients enhanced the growth of UPEC.

Furthermore, chamber differences in electrophysiology exist between atria and ventricles, yet there have been few direct comparisons. There is substantial literature on ion channel modulation at the single-cell level but less work on how this affects tissue-level parameters. We used a microelectrode array system to explore these issues using murine atrial and ventricular tissue slices. Activation time, conduction velocity and repolarisation were measured, and their modulation by temperature and pharmacological autonomic agonists were assessed. The system recorded reliable measurements under control conditions in the absence of drug/thermal challenge, and significant baseline differences were found in chamber electrophysiology. The sodium channel blocker mexiletine, produced large magnitude changes in all three measured parameters. Carbachol and isoprenaline induced differing effects in atria and ventricles, whereas temperature produced similar effects on activation and repolarisation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29590401>Noradrenergic Activity in the Human Brain: A Mechanism Supporting the Defense Against Hypoglycemia.</a></h2><p>Hypoglycemia, one of the major factors limiting optimal glycemic control in insulin-treated patients with , elicits a brain response to restore normoglycemia by activating counterregulation. Animal data indicate that local release of norepinephrine (NE) in the hypothalamus is important for triggering hypoglycemia-induced counterregulatory (CR) hormonal responses.To examine the potential role of brain noradrenergic (NA) activation in humans during hypoglycemia.A hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamp was performed in conjunction with positron emission tomographic imaging.Nine lean healthy volunteers were studied during the hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamp.Participants received intravenous injections of (S,S)-[11C]O-methylreboxetine ([11C]MRB), a highly selective NE transporter (NET) ligand, at baseline and during hypoglycemia.Hypoglycemia increased plasma epinephrine, glucagon, cortisol, and growth hormone and decreased [11C]MRB binding potential (BPND) by 24% ± 12% in the raphe nucleus (P < 0.01). In contrast, changes in [11C]MRB BPND in the hypothalamus positively correlated with increments in epinephrine and glucagon levels and negatively correlated with glucose infusion rate (all P < 0.05). Furthermore, in rat hypothalamus studies, hypoglycemia induced NET translocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane.Insulin-induced hypoglycemia initiated a complex brain NA response in humans. Raphe nuclei, a region involved in regulating autonomic output, motor activity, and hunger, had increased NA activity, whereas the hypothalamus showed a NET-binding pattern that was associated with the individual's CR response magnitude. These findings suggest that NA output most likely is important for modulating brain responses to hypoglycemia in humans.ClinicalTrials.gov .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27759117>Octopamine controls starvation resistance, life span and metabolic traits in Drosophila.</a></h2><p>The monoamines octopamine (OA) and tyramine (TA) modulate numerous behaviours and physiological processes in invertebrates. Nevertheless, it is not clear whether these invertebrate counterparts of norepinephrine are important regulators of metabolic and life history traits. We show that flies (Drosophila melanogaster) lacking OA are more resistant to starvation, while their overall life span is substantially reduced compared with control flies. In addition, these animals have increased body fat deposits, reduced physical activity and a reduced metabolic resting rate. Increasing the release of OA from internal stores induced the opposite effects. Flies devoid of both OA and TA had normal body fat and metabolic rates, suggesting that OA and TA act antagonistically. Moreover, OA-deficient flies show increased insulin release rates. We inferred that the OA-mediated control of insulin release accounts for a substantial proportion of the alterations observed in these flies. Apparently, OA levels control the balance between thrifty and expenditure metabolic modes. Thus, changes in OA levels in response to external and internal signals orchestrate behaviour and metabolic processes to meet physiological needs.

We previously reported positive associations between plasma free choline and bone mineral density (BMD). Animal studies suggest an impact of dietary choline on bone metabolism, but the role of dietary intake of choline and betaine for human bone health is unknown. The main aims were to examine the associations of dietary choline, choline species, and betaine with BMD and to study the relations between dietary and plasma free choline and betaine. Study subjects were participants in the Hordaland Health Study, including 2649 women and 1983 men (aged 46-49 or 71-74 y). BMD was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and dietary intake was obtained by using a validated 169-item food-frequency questionnaire. Risk associations were assessed by logistic regression and correlations by ρ (Spearman's bivariate rank order correlation). Subjects in the lowest compared with the highest tertile of dietary total choline, free choline, glycerophosphocholine, phosphocholine, phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin had a higher risk of low-femoral neck BMD, defined as the lowest BMD quintile. Particularly strong associations were found among middle-aged men for intake of free choline (OR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.24, 2.69;  = 0.002) and glycerophosphocholine (OR: 2.13; 95% CI: 1.43, 3.16;  < 0.001) and among elderly women for total choline (OR: 1.96; 95% CI: 1.33, 2.88;  = 0.001) and phosphatidylcholine (OR: 1.94; 95% CI: 1.33, 2.84:  = 0.001) intake. No significant associations were observed between dietary betaine and BMD. Dietary total choline, free choline, glycerophosphocholine, phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin correlated weakly with plasma free choline (ρ: 0.07, 0.05, 0.07, 0.07, and 0.05, respectively;  < 0.01).

Although effective if occasionally activated, repeated induction of the CRR leads to a decline in responsiveness and prolonged exposure to hypoglycemia. The mechanism underlying this impairment is not known. We found that the reduction in epinephrine release that characterizes a suppressed CRR involves a long-lasting form of sympatho-adrenal synaptic plasticity. Using optogenetically evoked catecholamine release, we show that recurrent hypoglycemia reduced the secretory capacity of mouse adrenal chromaffin cells. Single activation of the CRR increased the adrenal levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme for catecholamine synthesis, but this was prevented by repeated activation. In contrast, the level of neuropeptide Y (NPY), an adrenal cotransmitter, remained elevated after recurrent hypoglycemia. Inhibition of NPY or Y1 signaling, either transgenically or pharmacologically, prevented the attenuation of both TH expression and epinephrine release. These results indicate that impairment of the CRR involves suppressed activity at the adrenal level. Interfering with the peripheral NPY-dependent negative feedback loop may provide a way to avoid the pathophysiological consequences of recurrent hypoglycemia which are common in the diabetic state.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28763749>Protective effects of ethanolic peel and pulp extracts of Citrus macroptera fruit against isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rats.</a></h2><p>Increases in the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) have aroused strong interest in identifying antioxidants from natural sources for use in preventive medicine. Citrus macroptera (C. macroptera), commonly known as "Satkara", is an important herbal and medicinal plant reputed for its antioxidant, nutritious and therapeutic uses. The aim of the present study was to investigate the cardio-protective effects of ethanol extracts of C. macroptera peel and pulp against isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial infarction (MI) in rats. Male albino Wistar rats (n=36) were pre-treated with peel and pulp extracts (500mg/kg) for 45days. They received a challenge with ISO (85mg/kg) on the 44th and 45th days. Our findings indicated that subcutaneous injection of ISO induced severe myocardial injuries associated with oxidative stress, as confirmed by elevated lipid peroxidation (LPO) and decreased cellular reduced glutathione (GSH) and anti-peroxidative enzymes, including glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and glutathione-S-transferase, compared with levels observed in control animals. Pre-treatment with C. macroptera peel and pulp extracts prior to ISO administration however, significantly improved many of the investigated biochemical parameters, i.e., cardiac troponin I, cardiac marker enzymes, lipid profile and oxidative stress markers. The fruit peel extract showed stronger cardio-protective effects than the pulp extract. The biochemical findings were further confirmed by histopathological examinations. Overall, the increased endogenous antioxidant enzyme activity against heightened oxidative stress in the myocardium is strongly suggestive of the cardio-protective potential of C. macroptera.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, the significance of these signaling pathways for physiological adrenergic functions in β-cells is largely unknown. In the process of glucose-induced insulin secretion, opening of background current through nonselective cation channels (NSCCs) might facilitate membrane depolarization by closure of the ATP-sensitive K channels. Here, we examined whether physiological insulinostatic adrenaline action is mediated via the transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) channel, a type of NSCC, in β-cells. Results showed that physiological concentrations of adrenaline strongly suppressed glucose-induced and incretin-potentiated cAMP production and insulin secretion and inhibited NSCCs current and membrane excitability via the α2A-adrenoceptor in wild-type mice; however, insulin secretion was not attenuated in TRPM2-knockout (KO) mice. Administration of yohimbine, an α2-adrenoceptor antagonist, failed to affect glucose tolerance in TRPM2-KO mice, in contrast to an improved glucose tolerance in wild-type mice receiving the antagonist. The current study demonstrated that a physiological concentration of adrenaline attenuates insulin release via coupling of α2A-adrenoceptor to cAMP/TRPM2 signaling, thereby providing a potential therapeutic tool to treat patients with type 2 .© 2017 by the American  Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28163062>Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies TLL1 Variant Associated With Development of Hepatocellular Carcinoma After Eradication of Hepatitis C Virus Infection.</a></h2><p>There is still a risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development after eradication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with antiviral agents. We investigated genetic factors associated with the development of HCC in patients with a sustained virologic response (SVR) to treatment for chronic HCV infection.We obtained genomic DNA from 457 patients in Japan with a SVR to interferon-based treatment for chronic HCV infection from 2007 through 2015. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS), followed by a replication analysis of 79 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in an independent set of 486 patients in Japan. The study end point was HCC diagnosis or confirmation of lack of HCC (at follow-up examinations until December 2014 in the GWAS cohort, and until January 2016 in the replication cohort). We collected clinical and laboratory data from all patients. We analyzed expression levels of candidate gene variants in human hepatic stellate cells, rats with steatohepatitis caused by a choline-deficient L-amino acid-defined diet, and a mouse model of liver injury caused by administration of carbon tetrachloride. We also analyzed expression levels in liver tissues of patients with chronic HCV infection with different stages of fibrosis or tumors vs patients without HCV infection (controls).We found a strong association between the SNP rs17047200, located within the intron of the tolloid like 1 gene (TLL1) on chromosome 4, and development of HCC; there was a genome-wide level of significance when the results of the GWAS and replication study were combined (odds ratio, 2.37; P = 2.66 × 10). Multivariate analysis showed rs17047200 AT/TT to be an independent risk factor for HCC (hazard ratio, 1.78; P = .008), along with male sex, older age, lower level of albumin, advanced stage of hepatic fibrosis, presence of , and higher post-treatment level of α-fetoprotein. Combining the rs17047200 genotype with other factors, we developed prediction models for HCC development in patients with mild or advanced hepatic fibrosis. Levels of TLL1 messenger RNA (mRNA) in human hepatic stellate cells increased with activation. Levels of Tll1 mRNA increased in liver tissues of rodents with hepatic fibrogenesis compared with controls. Levels of TLL1 mRNA increased in liver tissues of patients with progression of fibrosis. Gene expression levels of TLL1 short variants, including isoform 2, were higher in patients with rs17047200 AT/TT.In a GWAS, we identified the association between the SNP rs17047200, within the intron of TLL1, and development of HCC in patients who achieved an SVR to treatment for chronic HCV infection. We found levels of Tll1/TLL1 mRNA to be increased in rodent models of liver injury and liver tissues of patients with fibrosis, compared with controls. We propose that this SNP might affect splicing of TLL1 mRNA, yielding short variants with high catalytic activity that accelerates hepatic fibrogenesis and carcinogenesis. Further studies are needed to determine how rs17047200 affects TLL1 mRNA levels, splicing, and translation, as well as the prevalence of this variant among other patients with HCC.

We encountered two separate cases of significantly elevated plasma metanephrines in patients taking midodrine, a sympathomimetic drug used in the treatment of severe postural hypotension, in the absence of a diagnosis of phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas. Upon stopping midodrine treatment, plasma metanephrine concentrations returned to normal in both patients. To explore the hypothesis that midodrine or its metabolite desglymidodrine might interfere with the metanephrines assay, we tested the interaction of midodrine with metanephrine assays from two different centres. High-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry on plasma samples and on methanolic extract of midodrine demonstrated co-elution of the metabolite desglymidodrine with metanephrine. We conclude that patients taking midodrine may have falsely elevated plasma metanephrine as a result of analytical interference, and clinicians need to be aware of this problem.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28299957>Enhancing Glycemic Control via Detection of Insulin Using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy.</a></h2><p>Currently, glycemic management for individuals with  involves monitoring glucose only, which is insufficient as glucose metabolism involves other biomarkers such as insulin. Monitoring additional biomarkers alongside glucose has been proposed to improve glycemic control. In this work, the development of a rapid and label-free insulin biosensor with high sensitivity and accuracy is presented. The insulin sensor prototype also serves as a prior study for a multimarker sensing platform technology that can further improve glycemic control in the future.Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to identify an optimal frequency specific to insulin detection on a gold disk electrode with insulin antibody immobilized, which was accomplished by conjugating the primary amines of insulin antibody to the carboxylic bond of the self-assembling monolayer on the gold surface. After blocking with , the insulin physiological concentration gradient was tested. The imaginary impedance was correlated to insulin concentration and the results were compared with standard equivalent circuit analysis and correlation of charge transfer resistance to target concentration.The optimal frequency of insulin is 810.5 Hz, which is characterized by having the highest sensitivity and sufficient specificity. The lower limit of detection was 2.26 [Formula: see text] which is comparable to a standard and better than traditional approaches.An insulin biosensor prototype capable of detecting insulin in physiological range without complex data normalization was developed. This prototype will be the ground works of a multimarker platform sensor technology for future all-in-one glycemic management sensors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28860739>The comparative effectiveness of initiating fluticasone/salmeterol combination therapy via pMDI versus DPI in reducing exacerbations and treatment escalation in COPD: a UK database study.</a></h2><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a complex progressive disease, is currently the third leading cause of death worldwide. One recommended treatment option is fixed-dose combination therapy of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/long-acting β-agonist. Clinical trials suggest pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs) and dry powder inhalers (DPIs) show similar efficacy and safety profiles in COPD. Real-world observational studies have shown that combination therapy has significantly greater odds of achieving asthma control when delivered via pMDIs. Our aim was to compare effectiveness, in terms of moderate/severe COPD exacerbations and long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) prescriptions, for COPD patients initiating fluticasone propionate (FP)/salmeterol xinafoate (SAL) via pMDI versus DPI at two doses of FP (500 and 1,000 μg/d) using a real-life, historical matched cohort study. COPD patients with ≥2 years continuous practice data, ≥2 prescriptions for FP/SAL via pMDI/DPI, and no prescription for ICS were selected from the Optimum Patient Care Research Database. Patients were matched 1:1. Rate of moderate/severe COPD exacerbations and odds of LAMA prescription were analyzed using conditional Poisson and logistic regression, respectively. Of 472 patients on 500 μg/d, we observed fewer moderate/severe exacerbations in patients using pMDI (99 [42%]) versus DPI (115 [49%]) (adjusted rate ratio: 0.71; 95% confidence interval: 0.54, 0.93), an important result since the pMDI is not licensed for COPD in the UK, USA, or China. At 1,000 μg/d, we observed lower LAMA prescription for pMDI (adjusted odds ratio: 0.71; 95% confidence interval: 0.55, 0.91), but no difference in exacerbation rates, potentially due to higher dose of ICS overcoming low lung delivery from the DPI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28137792>Cardiac Autonomic Regulation and Repolarization During Acute Experimental Hypoglycemia in Type 2 .</a></h2><p>Hypoglycemia is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality in trials of intensive therapy in type 2  (T2DM). We previously observed an increase in arrhythmias during spontaneous prolonged hypoglycemia in patients with T2DM. We examined changes in cardiac autonomic function and repolarization during sustained experimental hypoglycemia. Twelve adults with T2DM and 11 age- and BMI-matched control participants without  underwent paired hyperinsulinemic clamps separated by 4 weeks. Glucose was maintained at euglycemia (6.0 mmol/L) or hypoglycemia (2.5 mmol/L) for 1 h. Heart rate, blood pressure, and heart rate variability were assessed every 30 min and corrected QT intervals and T-wave morphology every 60 min. Heart rate initially increased in participants with T2DM but then fell toward baseline despite maintained hypoglycemia at 1 h accompanied by reactivation of vagal tone. In control participants, vagal tone remained depressed during sustained hypoglycemia. Participants with T2DM exhibited greater heterogeneity of repolarization during hypoglycemia as demonstrated by T-wave symmetry and principal component analysis ratio compared with control participants. Epinephrine levels during hypoglycemia were similar between groups. Cardiac autonomic regulation during hypoglycemia appears to be time dependent. Individuals with T2DM demonstrate greater repolarization abnormalities for a given hypoglycemic stimulus despite comparable sympathoadrenal responses. These mechanisms could contribute to arrhythmias during clinical hypoglycemic episodes.© 2017 by the American  Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27800649>Effects of DPP-4 inhibitor linagliptin and GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide on physiological response to hypoglycaemia in Japanese subjects with type 2 : A randomized, open-label, 2-arm parallel comparative, exploratory trial.</a></h2><p>Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia, possibly through augmentation of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) action, but not that of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) on glucagon secretion. To examine this model in Japanese individuals with type 2  (T2D), the effects of the DPP-4 inhibitor linagliptin on glucagon and other counter-regulatory hormone responses to hypoglycaemia were evaluated and compared with those of the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide in a multi-centre, randomized, open-label, 2-arm parallel comparative, exploratory trial. Three-step hypoglycaemic clamp glucose tests preceded by meal tolerance tests were performed before and after 2-week treatment with the drugs. Glucagon levels were increased during the hypoglycaemic clamp test at 2.5 mmol/L. This increase was similar in the linagliptin and liraglutide groups, both before and after the 2-week treatment. Changes in other counter-regulatory hormones (ie, growth hormone, cortisol, epinephrine and norepinephrine) were also similar between the groups, but were suppressed substantially after 2-week treatment compared to baseline. In conclusion, we confirmed that the glucagon response to hypoglycaemia was not affected by linagliptin or liraglutide treatment in Japanese individuals with T2D.© 2016 The Authors. , Obesity and Metabolism published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28283926>Differential Metabolic Effects of Beta-Blockers: an Updated Systematic Review of Nebivolol.</a></h2><p>Blood pressure management in hypertensive patients with metabolic abnormalities is challenging, since many of the antihypertensive drugs adversely affect metabolism. Besides effective control of blood pressure in patients with hypertension, third-generation beta-blockers such as nebivolol offer additional benefits for central hemodynamics and neutral or beneficial effects on metabolism. Emerging clinical data suggest that nebivolol also has similar effects on metabolism in obese hypertensive and hypertensive diabetic patients. The present article will provide a systematic analysis of the pathophysiological links among hypertension, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome. We will also summarize the available clinical evidence regarding the metabolic effects of beta-blockers in hypertensive patients, with an emphasis on nebivolol. Nebivolol exerts neutral or beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism in hypertensive patients, owing to its nitric oxide-mediated vasodilatory and antioxidative properties. Thus, nebivolol could be a favorable therapeutic option for the treatment of hypertension in patients with impaired glucose and lipid metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28177189>Acute physiological effects of glucocorticoids on fuel metabolism in humans are permissive but not direct.</a></h2><p>The effects of glucocorticoids on fuel metabolism are complex. Acute glucocorticoid excess promotes lipolysis but chronic glucocorticoid excess causes visceral fat accumulation. We hypothesized that interactions between cortisol and insulin and adrenaline account for these conflicting results. We tested the effect of cortisol on lipolysis and glucose production with and without insulin and adrenaline in humans both in vivo and in vitro.A total of 20 healthy men were randomized to low and high insulin groups (both n = 10). Subjects attended on 3 occasions and received low (c. 150 nM), medium (c. 400 nM) or high (c. 1400 nM) cortisol infusion in a randomized crossover design. Deuterated glucose and glycerol were infused intravenously along with a pancreatic clamp (somatostatin with replacement of glucagon, insulin and growth hormone) and adrenaline. Subcutaneous adipose tissue was obtained for analysis. In parallel, the effect of cortisol on lipolysis was tested in paired primary cultures of human subcutaneous and visceral adipocytes.In vivo, high cortisol increased lipolysis only in the presence of high insulin and/or adrenaline but did not alter glucose kinetics. High cortisol increased adipose mRNA levels of ATGL, HSL and CGI-58 and suppressed G0S2. In vitro, high cortisol increased lipolysis in the presence of insulin in subcutaneous, but not visceral, adipocytes.The acute lipolytic effects of cortisol require supraphysiological concentrations, are dependent on insulin and adrenaline and are observed only in subcutaneous adipose tissue. The resistance of visceral adipose tissue to cortisol's lipolytic effects may contribute to the central fat accumulation observed with chronic glucocorticoid excess.© 2017 The Authors. , Obesity and Metabolism published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29952104>Outcomes of "-friendly" vs "-unfriendly" β-blockers in older nursing home residents with  after acute myocardial infarction.</a></h2><p>To assess whether nursing home (NH) residents with type 2  (T2D) preferentially received "T2D-friendly" (vs "T2D-unfriendly") β-blockers after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and to evaluate the comparative effects of the two groups of β-blockers.This new-user retrospective cohort study of NH residents with AMI from May 2007 to March 2010 used national data from the Minimum Data Set and Medicare system. T2D-friendly β-blockers were those hypothesized to increase peripheral glucose uptake through vasodilation: carvedilol, nebivolol and labetalol. Primary outcomes were hospitalizations for hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia in the 90 days after AMI. Secondary outcomes were functional decline, death, all-cause re-hospitalization and fracture hospitalization. We compared outcomes using binomial and multinomial logistic regression models after propensity score matching.Of 2855 NH residents with T2D, 29% initiated a T2D-friendly β-blocker vs 24% of 6098 without T2D (P < 0.001). For primary outcomes among residents with T2D, T2D-friendly vs T2D-unfriendly β-blockers were associated with a reduction in hospitalized hyperglycaemia (odds ratio [OR] 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.21-0.97), but unassociated with hypoglycaemia (OR 2.05, 95% CI 0.82-5.10).

Here, we investigated whether contractile response to noradrenaline in femoral arteries would change in type 2 diabetic male Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rat at the chronic stage of disease (1 year old) versus age-matched control Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rat. OLETF rat exhibited hyperglycemia, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypoinsulinemia compared to age-matched LETO rat. Noradrenaline-induced contraction was increased in femoral arteries in OLETF rats compared with LETO rats whereas serotonin- or phenylephrine-induced contractions were similar between these two animals. Acetylcholine- and sodium nitroprusside-induced relaxations were similar between the two groups. Very small relaxations in femoral arteries induced by clonidine and isoprenaline were obtained in LETO but not OLETF group. Noradrenaline-induced contraction was enhanced by treatment with N-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA), a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, and the between-group difference of contraction was eliminated by such treatment. Indomethacin, a non-selective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, reduced noradrenaline-induced contraction in both groups, whereas the contraction was greater in OLETF group versus LETO. Femoral arterial protein expression of endothelial NOS, COX-1, and superoxide dismutases were similar between the two groups, whereas reduction of COX-2 expression was seen in OLETF group compared with LETO. Increased contractile responsiveness to noradrenaline is seen in OLETF rat femoral artery and this may be due to reduction of suppressive effect of NO.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27604432>Choline Fenofibrate Delayed Release Capsules Versus Conventional Fenofibrate Tablets for Dyslipidemia: A Randomized, Non-Inferiority Trial.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30342713>Serum  Plasmalogen and Urine Myo-Inositol as Cognitive Decline Markers.</a></h2><p>Recent studies have suggested that metabolic disorders, particularly type 2  (T2DM), and dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), were linked at the clinical and molecular levels. Brain insulin deficiency and resistance may be key events in AD pathology mechanistically linking AD to T2DM.  plasmalogens (PlsEtns) are abundant in the brain and play essential roles in neuronal function and myelin formation. As such, PlsEtn deficiency may be pathologically relevant in some neurodegenerative disorders such as AD. Decreased brain PlsEtn associated with dementia may reflect serum PlsEtn deficiency. We hypothesized that myo-inositol plays a role in myelin formation through its facilitation of PlsEtn biosynthesis. Excessive urinary myo-inositol (UMI) loss would likely result in PlsEtn deficiency potentially leading to demyelinating diseases such as dementia. Accordingly, measurement of both serum PlsEtn and baseline UMI excretion could improve the detection of cognitive impairment (CI) in a more specific and reliable manner. To verify our hypothesis, we conducted a clinical observational study of memory clinic outpatients (MCO) and cognitively normal elderly (NE) for nearly 4.5years. We demonstrated that serum PlsEtn concentration associated with UMI excretion was useful for predicting advancing dementia in patients with mild CI. Because hyperglycemia and associated insulin resistance might be a leading cause of increased baseline UMI excretion, serum PlsEtn quantitation would be useful in detecting CI among the elderly with hyperglycemia. Our findings suggest that myo-inositol is a novel candidate molecule linking T2DM to AD.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In young and old rats,  resulted in hypertension, weight loss, hyperglycemia, and hypertriglyceridemia, which were partially prevented by SMe1EC2. SMe1EC2 also inhibited the -induced increase in aorta levels of AGEs (advanced glycosylation end-protein adducts), 4-HNE (4-hydroxy-nonenal-histidine), 3-NT (3-nitrotyrosine), and RAGEs (receptors for AGEs). The contractions of the aorta rings to phenylephrine (Phe) and KCL did not significantly change, but acetylcholine (ACh) and salbutamol relaxations were reduced in OC compared to YC rats.  induction increased Phe contractions in YC and OC rats, KCL contractions in YC rats, and did not cause further inhibition in already inhibited ACh and salbutamol relaxations in OC rats. We have achieved the lowest levels of ACh relaxation in YD rats compared to other groups. SMe1EC2 did not change the response of aorta to ACh, salbutamol and Phe in YC rats, and ameliorated ACh relaxations in OC and YD but not in OD rats. In YDT and ODT rats, increased Phe and KCL contractions, high blood pressure, and impaired salbutamol relaxations were amended by SMe1EC2. Phe contractions observed in YD and OD rats as well as KCl contractions observed in OC rats were the lowest levels when the rats were treated with SMe1EC2. When the bath solution was shifted to cyclopiazonic acid (CYP) or CYP plus Ca-free medium, the contraction induced by a single dose of Phe (3 × 10 M) was more inhibited in YD and OD than in YC but not in OC rats. In SMe1EC2-treated rats, neither the presence of CFM nor CFM plus CYP exhibited a significant change in response of aorta to a single dose of Phe. These findings suggest that α1-adrenergic receptor signaling is activated in both age groups of diabetic rats,  activates K-depolarization and calcium mobilization via Ca especially in the aorta of young rats, and sensitizes the aorta of old rats to the regulating effect of SMe1EC2. ACh relaxations were inhibited in YC rats, increased in OC rats and unchanged in YD and OD rats when aortic rings pretreated with TEA, an inhibitor of calcium-activated K channels (K), or 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), an inhibitor of voltage-sensitive K channels (K). ACh relaxations were inhibited in YCT, OCT, and YDT rats in the presence of 4-AP or TEA. In ODT rats, 4-AP did not change ACh relaxation but TEA inhibited. These findings suggest that the contribution of K and K to ACh relaxation is likely upregulated by SMe1EC2 when the relaxations were inhibited by aging or .

Recurrent and/or antecedent hypoglycemia causes blunting of protective counterregulatory responses, known as hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF). To determine whether and how opioid receptor activation induces HAAF in humans, 12 healthy subjects without  (7 men, age 32.3 ± 2.2 years, BMI 25.1 ± 1.0 kg/m) participated in two study protocols in random order over two consecutive days. On day 1, subjects received two 120-min infusions of either saline or morphine (0.1 μg/kg/min), separated by a 120-min break (all euglycemic). On day 2, subjects underwent stepped hypoglycemic clamps (nadir 60 mg/dL) with evaluation of counterregulatory hormonal responses, endogenous glucose production (EGP, using 6,6-D2-glucose), and hypoglycemic symptoms. Morphine induced an ∼30% reduction in plasma epinephrine response together with reduced EGP and hypoglycemia-associated symptoms on day 2. Therefore, we report the first studies in humans demonstrating that pharmacologic opioid receptor activation induces some of the clinical and biochemical features of HAAF, thus elucidating the individual roles of various receptors involved in HAAF's development and suggesting novel pharmacologic approaches for safer intensive glycemic control in T1DM.ClinicalTrials.gov .© 2017 by the American  Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30338679>Observational clinical and nerve conduction study on effects of a nutraceutical combination on painful diabetic distal symmetric sensory-motor neuropathy in patients with  type 1 and type 2.</a></h2><p>Painful distal symmetric polyneuropathy (pDSPN) is one of the most common and invalidating complications of , both of type 1 and type 2.

In this study, we established the cardiac hypertrophy cell model in rat neonatal ventricular cardiomyocytes (RNVMs) with phenylephrine. The cell model was characterized by the increased protein synthesis and cardiomyocyte size, which can be normalized by ARO treatment in both concentration- and time-dependent manner. In transverse aortic constriction (TAC) induced cardiac hypertrophy model, ARO administration improved the impairment of cardiac function and alleviated the cardiac hypertrophy indicators, like ventricular mass/body weight, myocyte cross-sectional area, and the expression of ANP, BNP and Myh7. ARO treatment also suppressed the cardiac fibrosis and the correlated fibrogenic genes. Our further investigation revealed ARO could down-regulate pressure overload-induced Malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-HNE expression, restore the decrease of GSH/GSSG ratio, meanwhile prevent nuclear translocation of NFAT and the activation of MAPKs pathways.

The present study examined whether PMW exhibit augmented postjunctional α-adrenergic receptor vasoconstriction at rest and during forearm exercise compared to young women (YW). Eight YW (24 ± 1 years) and eight PMW (65 ± 1 years) completed a series of randomized experimental trials: (1) at rest, (2) under high flow (adenosine infusion) conditions and (3) during 6 min of forearm exercise at relative (20% of maximum) and absolute (7 kg) intensities. Phenylephrine (α -agonist) or dexmedetomidine (α -agonist) was administered during the last 3 min of each trial to elicit α-adrenergic vasoconstriction. Forearm vascular conductance (FVC) was calculated from blood flow and blood pressure. Vasoconstrictor responsiveness was identified as the change in FVC (%) during α-adrenergic agonist infusions from baseline (resting trial) or from steady-state conditions (high flow and exercise trials). During resting and high flow trials, the %FVC during α - and α -agonist stimulation was similar between YW and PMW. During exercise, α -mediated vasoconstriction was blunted in YW vs. PMW at relative (-6 ± 2% vs. -15 ± 3%) and absolute (-4 ± 2% vs. -14 ± 5%) workloads, such that blood flow and FVC were lower in PMW (P < 0.05 for all). Conversely, α -mediated vasoconstriction was similar between YW and PMW at relative (-22 ± 3% vs. -22 ± 4%; P > 0.05) and absolute (-19 ± 3% vs. -18 ± 4%; P > 0.05) workloads. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that despite similar α-adrenergic vasoconstrictor responsiveness at rest, PMW have a decreased ability to attenuate α -adrenergic vasoconstriction in contracting skeletal muscle.© 2018 The Authors.

However, the gastrointestinal tract presents a formidable barrier to oral delivery of biologics. Here we report the development of a highly effective oral insulin formulation using choline and geranate (CAGE) ionic liquid. CAGE significantly enhanced paracellular transport of insulin, while protecting it from enzymatic degradation and by interacting with the mucus layer resulting in its thinning. In vivo, insulin-CAGE demonstrated exceptional pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic outcome after jejunal administration in rats. Low insulin doses (3-10 U/kg) brought about a significant decrease in blood glucose levels, which were sustained for longer periods (up to 12 hours), unlike s.c. injected insulin. When 10 U/kg insulin-CAGE was orally delivered in enterically coated capsules using an oral gavage, a sustained decrease in blood glucose of up to 45% was observed. The formulation exhibited high biocompatibility and was stable for 2 months at room temperature and for at least 4 months under refrigeration. Taken together, the results indicate that CAGE is a promising oral delivery vehicle and should be further explored for oral delivery of insulin and other biologics that are currently marketed as injectables.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28879656>Variability in responses observed in human white adipose tissue models.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a risk factor for a myriad of diseases including , cardiovascular dysfunction, cirrhosis, and cancer, and there is a need for new systems to study how excess adipose tissue relates to the onset of disease processes. This study provides proof-of-concept patient-specific tissue models of human white adipose tissue to accommodate the variability in human samples. Our 3D tissue engineering approach established lipolytic responses and changes in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake from small volumes of human lipoaspirate, making this methodology useful for patient specific sample source assessments of treatment strategies, drug responses, disease mechanisms, and other responses that vary between patients. Mature unilocular cells were maintained ex vivo in silk porous scaffolds for up to a month of culture and imaged non-invasively with coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering. Interestingly, differences in responsiveness between tissues were observed in terms of magnitude of lipolysis, ability to suppress lipolysis, differences in glucose uptake, and lipid droplet size. Body mass index was not a factor in determining tissue responsiveness; rather, it is speculated that other unknown variables in the backgrounds of different patients (ethnicity, athleticism, disease history, lifestyle choices, etc.) likely had a more significant effect on the observed differences. This study reinforces the need to account for the variability in backgrounds and genetics within the human population to determine adipose tissue responsiveness. In the future, this tissue system could be used to inform individualized care strategies-enhancing therapeutic precision, improving patient outcomes, and reducing clinical costs.Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29932998>Facile synthesis and characterization of tailor-made pectin-gellan gum-bionanofiller composites as intragastric drug delivery shuttles.</a></h2><p>Olive oil-entrapped diethanolamine-modified high-methoxyl pectin (DMP)-gellan gum (GG)-bionanofiller composites were developed for controlled intragastric delivery of metformin HCl (MFM). DMP had a degree of amidation of 48.7% and was characterized further by FTIR, XRD and DSC analyses. MFM-loaded composites were subsequently accomplished by green synthesis via ionotropic gelation technique using zinc acetate as cross-linker. The thermal, X-ray and infrared analyses suggested an environment in the composites compatible with the drug, except certain degree of attenuation in drug's crystallinity. Scanning electron microscopy revealed almost spherical shape of the composites. Depending upon the mass ratios of GG:DMP, types of nanofiller (neusilin/bentonite/Florite) and oil inclusion, the composites exhibited variable drug encapsulation efficiency (DEE, 50-85%) and extended drug release behaviours (Q, 69-94%) in acetate buffer (pH 4.5). The optimized oil-entrapped Florite R NF/GG: DMP (1:1) composites eluted MFM via case-II transport mechanism and its drug release data was best fitted in zero-order kinetic model. The optimized formulation demonstrated excellent gastroretentive properties and substantial hypoglycemic effect in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. These novel hybrid matrices were thus found suitable for controlled intragastric delivery of MFM for the management of type 2 .Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In the first case, a bilateral neck exploration with parathyroidectomy during the second trimester of pregnancy was unsuccessful and the patient remained hypercalcaemic.

We evaluated the association between plasma TMAO and incident atrial fibrillation (AF).Risk associations were explored among 3797 patients with suspected stable angina in the Western Norway Coronary Angiography Cohort (WECAC) and verified in 3143 elderly participants in the community-based Hordaland Health Study (HUSK). Information on endpoints was obtained from nationwide registries.Median follow-up was 7.3 and 10.8 years in the WECAC and HUSK cohorts, respectively, and 412 (10.9%) and 484 (15.4%) subjects were registered with incident AF. The age and gender adjusted HRs were 1.16, 95% CI 1.05-1.28 and 1.10, 95% CI 1.004-1.19 per 1 SD increase in log-transformed plasma TMAO. Adjusting for hypertension, BMI, smoking, , or intake of total choline, a TMAO precursor, did not materially influence the risk associations. Among patients in WECAC, further extensive adjustment for other AF risk factors yielded similar results. Adding TMAO to traditional AF risk factors (age, gender, hypertension, BMI, smoking and ) yielded a continuous net reclassification improvement of 0.108, 95% CI 0.015-0.202 and 0.139, 95% CI 0.042-0.235.Plasma TMAO was associated with and improved reclassification of incident AF in two independent Norwegian cohorts with long-term follow-up. The relationship was independent of traditional AF risk factors, as well as of dietary choline intake. Our findings motivate further studies to explore endogenous metabolic factors influencing the relationship between TMAO and cardiovascular disease.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Studies have shown that GW0742 has off target, non- PPARβ/δ effects in the cell although there are some key questions that remain to be addressed in respect to the significance of this control on vascular tone.Using isometric organ baths, rat aorta rings were exposed to ROCK inhibitors and the changes in contraction and dilation measured.Our data shows that the PPARβ/δ agonist GW0742 (10-7M) inhibits contractile responses to U46619 and phenylephrine, and that these responses are similar in normal and Streptozotocin (STZ) diabetic rat aorta. ROCK inhibitors Fasudil and Y27632 significantly reduced GW0742 mediated dilation of naïve rat aorta, but Fasudil had no effect on GW0742 dilation in STZ diabetic rat aorta. In contrast, STZ diabetic rat aorta pre-contracted with high [K+] Krebs lacked a dilatory response to GW0742, which taken together indicates that the mechanism of action of GW0742 mediated dilation changes in the diabetic state compared to non-diabetic state.This is the first direct evidence demonstrating the non- PPARβ/δ effect of GW0742 on contraction is irrespective to the diabetic state, and that GW0742 has the potential to induce vasodilation via multiple off-target mechanisms.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28915389>Choline prevents fetal overgrowth and normalizes placental fatty acid and glucose metabolism in a mouse model of maternal obesity.</a></h2><p>Maternal obesity increases placental transport of macronutrients, resulting in fetal overgrowth and obesity later in life. Choline participates in fatty acid metabolism, serves as a methyl donor and influences growth signaling, which may modify placental macronutrient homeostasis and affect fetal growth. Using a mouse model of maternal obesity, we assessed the effect of maternal choline supplementation on preventing fetal overgrowth and restoring placental macronutrient homeostasis. C57BL/6J mice were fed either a high-fat (HF, 60% kcal from fat) diet or a normal (NF, 10% kcal from fat) diet with a drinking supply of either 25 mM choline chloride or control purified water, respectively, beginning 4 weeks prior to mating until gestational day 12.5. Fetal and placental weight, metabolites and gene expression were measured. HF feeding significantly (P<.05) increased placental and fetal weight in the HF-control (HFCO) versus NF-control (NFCO) animals, whereas the HF choline-supplemented (HFCS) group effectively normalized placental and fetal weight to the levels of the NFCO group. Compared to HFCO, the HFCS group had lower (P<.05) glucose transporter 1 and fatty acid transport protein 1 expression as well as lower accumulation of glycogen in the placenta. The HFCS group also had lower (P<.05) placental 4E-binding protein 1 and ribosomal protein s6 phosphorylation, which are indicators of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 activation favoring macronutrient anabolism. In summary, our results suggest that maternal choline supplementation prevented fetal overgrowth in obese mice at midgestation and improved biomarkers of placental macronutrient homeostasis.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The present study was designed to determine and compare the effects of articaine, a widely used anaesthetic in dental practice, and lidocaine on the resting and axonal stimulation-evoked release of [H]noradrenaline ([H]NA) in prefrontal cortex slices and the release of [H]NA in spinal cord slices prepared from non-diabetic and streptozocin (STZ)-induced diabetic (glucose level=22.03±2.31mmol/l) rats. The peak of allodynia was achieved 9 weeks after STZ-treatment. Articaine and lidocaine inhibited the stimulation-evoked release in a concentration-dependent manner and increased the resting release by two to six times. These effects indicate an inhibitory action of these anaesthetics on Na- and K-channels. There was no difference in clinically important nerve conduction between non-diabetic and diabetic rats, as measured by the release of transmitter in response to axonal stimulation. The uptake and resting release of NA was significantly higher in the brain slices prepared from diabetic rats, but there were no differences in the spinal cord. For the adverse effects, the effects of articaine on K channels (resting release) are more pronounced compared to lidocaine. In this respect, articaine has a thiophene ring with high lipid solubility, which may present potential risks for some patients.Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

DMP with degree of amidation of 48.72% was initially accomplished and characterized by FTIR, DSC and XRD analyses. MFM-loaded core matrices were then fabricated by ionotropic gelation technique employing zinc acetate as cross-linker. The core matrices were further coated by fenugreek gum (FG)-ALG gel membrane via diffusion-controlled interfacial complexation method. Various formulations demonstrated excellent drug encapsulation efficiency (DEE, 51-70%) and sustained drug eluting behavior (Q, 72-96%), which were extremely influenced by polymer-blend (ALG:DMP) ratios, low density additives (olive oil/magnesium stearate) and FG-ALG coating inclusion. The drug release profile of the core-shell matrices (F-7) was best fitted in zero-order kinetic model with case-II transport driven mechanism. It also portrayed outstanding gastroretentive characteristics. Moreover, the composites were analyzed for surface morphology, drug-excipients compatibility, thermal behavior and drug crystallinity. Thus, the developed composites are appropriate for controlled stomach-specific delivery of MFM for type 2  management.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Despite providing major benefits, sub populations of patients experience adverse effects, including muscle myopathy and development of type II  (T2DM) that may result in premature discontinuation of treatment. There are no reliable biomarkers for predicting clinical side effects in vulnerable individuals. Pharmacometabolomics provides powerful tools for identifying global biochemical changes induced by statin treatment, providing insights about drug mechanism of action, development of side effects and basis of variation of response.To determine whether statin-induced changes in intermediary metabolism correlated with statin-induced hyperglycemia and insulin resistance; to identify pre-drug treatment metabolites predictive of post-drug treatment increased diabetic risk.Drug-naïve patients were treated with 40 mg/day simvastatin for 6 weeks in the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics (CAP) study; metabolomics by gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass-spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) was performed on plasma pre and post treatment on 148 of the 944 participants.Six weeks of simvastatin treatment resulted in 6.9% of patients developing hyperglycemia and 25% developing changes consistent with development of pre-. Altered beta cell function was observed in 53% of patients following simvastatin therapy and insulin resistance was observed in 54% of patients. We identified initial signature of simvastatin-induced insulin resistance, including , hydroxylamine, hydroxycarbamate and isoleucine which, upon further replication and expansion, could be predictive biomarkers of individual susceptibility to simvastatin-induced new onset pre-type II . No patients were clinically diagnosed with T2DM.Within this short 6 weeks study, some patients became hyperglycemic and/or insulin resistant. Diabetic markers were associated with decarboxylated small aminated metabolites as well as a branched chain amino acid directly linked to glucose metabolism and fatty acid biosynthesis.

We performed a comprehensive paired analysis of phospholipids in extracranial carotid endarterectomy (CEA) plaques of matched diabetic and nondiabetic patients and analyzed mass spectrometry-derived profiles of three phospholipids, plasmenyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (pPE), phosphatidylserine (PS), and phosphatidylinositol (PI), in maximally (MAX) and minimally (MIN) diseased CEA segments. We also measured levels of arachidonic acid (AA), produced by pPE hydrolysis, and choline- phosphotransferase 1 (CEPT1), responsible for most pPE de novo biosynthesis. In paired analysis, MIN CEA segments had higher levels than MAX segments of pPE ( < 0.001), PS ( < 0.001), and PI ( < 0.03). MIN diabetic plaques contained higher levels than MAX diabetic plaques of arachidonoyl pPE38:4 and pPE38:5 and CEPT1 was upregulated in diabetic versus nondiabetic plaques.

Maternal nutrition plays a critical role in fetal and placental development, in part by providing the methyl groups required to establish the fetus's genome structure and function, notably through DNA methylation. The goal of this narrative review is to describe the role of maternal dietary methyl donor (methionine, folate, and choline) and cofactor (zinc and vitamins B2, B6, and B12) intake in one-carbon metabolism and DNA methylation in the fetus and placenta, as well as their impacts on fetal growth and lifelong health outcomes, with specific examples in animals and humans.

A cross-sectional subset of the Nutrition, Aging, and Memory in Elders cohort who had undergone MRI of the brain ( = 296; mean ± SD age: 73 ± 8.1 y) was assessed. Plasma concentrations of free choline, betaine, and phosphatidylcholine were measured with the use of liquid-chromatography-stable-isotope dilution-multiple-reaction monitoring-mass spectrometry. A volumetric analysis of MRI was used to determine the cerebrovascular pathology (white-matter hyperintensities and small- and large-vessel infarcts). Multiple linear and logistic regression models were used to examine relations of plasma measures with cardiometabolic risk factors, history of cardiovascular disease, and radiologic evidence of cerebrovascular pathology. Higher concentrations of plasma choline were associated with an unfavorable cardiometabolic risk-factor profile [lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, higher total homocysteine, and higher body mass index (BMI)] and greater odds of large-vessel cerebral vascular disease or history of cardiovascular disease but lower odds of small-vessel cerebral vascular disease. Conversely, higher concentrations of plasma betaine were associated with a favorable cardiometabolic risk-factor profile [lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides] and lower odds of . Higher concentrations of plasma phosphatidylcholine were associated with characteristics of both a favorable cardiometabolic risk-factor profile (higher HDL cholesterol, lower BMI, lower C-reactive protein, lower waist circumference, and lower odds of hypertension and ) and an unfavorable profile (higher LDL cholesterol and triglycerides). Choline and its metabolites have differential associations with cardiometabolic risk factors and subtypes of vascular disease, thereby suggesting differing roles in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and cerebral large-vessel disease compared with that of small-vessel disease.© 2017 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29247240>Genetic and Neurobiological Analyses of the Noradrenergic-like System in Vulnerability to Sugar Overconsumption Using a Drosophila Model.</a></h2><p>Regular overconsumption of sugar is associated with obesity and type-2 , but how genetic factors contribute to variable sugar preferences and intake levels remains mostly unclear. Here we provide evidence for the usefulness of a Drosophila larva model to investigate genetic influence on vulnerability to sugar overconsumption. Using genetic and RNA interference approaches, we show that the activity of the Oamb gene, which encodes a receptor for octopamine (OA, the invertebrate homologue of norepinephrine), plays a major role in controlled sugar consumption. Furthermore, Oamb appears to suppress sugar food intake in fed larvae in an acute manner, and neurons expressing this Oamb receptor do not overlap with neurons expressing Octβ3R, another OA receptor previously implicated in hunger-driven exuberant sugar intake. Together, these results suggest that two separate sub-circuits, defined by Oamb and Octβ3R respectively, co-regulate sugar consumption according to changes in energy needs. We propose that the noradrenergic-like system defines an ancient regulatory mechanism for prevention of sugar overload.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27808173>Metabolic effects of basic fibroblast growth factor in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats: A H NMR-based metabolomics investigation.</a></h2><p>The fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) family shows a great potential in the treatment of , but little attention is paid to basic FGF (bFGF). In this study, to explore the metabolic effects of bFGF on , metabolic changes in serum and feces were analyzed in the normal rats, the streptozocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats and the bFGF-treated diabetic rats using a H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomic approach. Interestingly, bFGF treatment significantly decreased glucose, lipid and low density lipoprotein/very low density lipoprotein (LDL/VLDL) levels in serum of diabetic rats. Moreover, bFGF treatment corrected -induced reductions in citrate, lactate, choline, glycine, creatine, histidine, phenylalanine, tyrosine and glutamine in serum. Fecal propionate was significantly increased after bFGF treatment. Correlation analysis shows that glucose, lipid and LDL/VLDL were significantly negatively correlated with energy metabolites (citrate, creatine and lactate) and amino acids (alanine, glycine, histidine, phenylalanine, tyrosine and glutamine). In addition, a weak but significant correlation was observed between fecal propionate and serum lipid (R = -0.35, P = 0.046). Based on metabolic correlation and pathway analysis, therefore, we suggest that the glucose and lipid lowering effects of bFGF in the STZ-induced diabetic rats may be achieved by activating microbial metabolism, increasing energy metabolism and correcting amino acid metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29563152>Adrenaline Stimulates Glucagon Secretion by Tpc2-Dependent Ca Mobilization From Acidic Stores in Pancreatic α-Cells.</a></h2><p>Adrenaline is a powerful stimulus of glucagon secretion. It acts by activation of β-adrenergic receptors, but the downstream mechanisms have only been partially elucidated. Here, we have examined the effects of adrenaline in mouse and human α-cells by a combination of electrophysiology, imaging of Ca and PKA activity, and hormone release measurements. We found that stimulation of glucagon secretion correlated with a PKA- and EPAC2-dependent (inhibited by PKI and ESI-05, respectively) elevation of [Ca] in α-cells, which occurred without stimulation of electrical activity and persisted in the absence of extracellular Ca but was sensitive to ryanodine, bafilomycin, and thapsigargin. Adrenaline also increased [Ca] in α-cells in human islets. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of the Tpc2 channel (that mediates Ca release from acidic intracellular stores) abolished the stimulatory effect of adrenaline on glucagon secretion and reduced the elevation of [Ca] Furthermore, in Tpc2-deficient islets, ryanodine exerted no additive inhibitory effect. These data suggest that β-adrenergic stimulation of glucagon secretion is controlled by a hierarchy of [Ca] signaling in the α-cell that is initiated by cAMP-induced Tpc2-dependent Ca release from the acidic stores and further amplified by Ca-induced Ca release from the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum.© 2018 by the American  Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27389446>Preservation of CGRP in myocardium attenuates development of cardiac dysfunction in diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) plays an important role in cardiovascular regulation, which was found reduced in serum of diabetic patients.

Approach and results Skin-derived precursors (SKPs) were cultured from biopsies (=164, ∼1 cm) taken from the edges of surgical incisions of older adults (=158; males 72%; mean age 62.7 ± 13 years) undergoing cardiothoracic surgery, and differentiated into VSMCs at high efficiency (>80% yield).

The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate the effects of exogenous adenosine on human BAT perfusion, and to determine the density of A2ARs in human BAT in vivo for the first time, using PET/CT imaging.Healthy, lean men (n = 10) participated in PET/CT imaging with two radioligands. Perfusion of BAT, white adipose tissue (WAT) and muscle was quantified with [O]HO at baseline, during cold exposure and during intravenous administration of adenosine. A2AR density of the tissues was quantified with [C]TMSX at baseline and during cold exposure.Adenosine increased the perfusion of BAT even more than cold exposure (baseline 8.3 ± 4.5, cold 19.6 ± 9.3, adenosine 28.6 ± 7.9 ml/100 g/min, p < 0.01). Distribution volume of [C]TMSX in BAT was significantly lower during cold exposure compared to baseline. In cold, low [C]TMSX binding coincided with high concentrations of noradrenaline.Adenosine administration caused a maximal perfusion effect in human supraclavicular BAT, indicating increased oxidative metabolism. Cold exposure increased noradrenaline concentrations and decreased the density of A2AR available for radioligand binding in BAT, suggesting augmented release of endogenous adenosine. Our results show that adenosine and A2AR are relevant for activation of human BAT, and A2AR provides a future target for enhancing BAT metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29996143>No Protective Effect of Constitutive Activation of AMPK in Endothelial Cells on Vascular Function in Aged Obese Mice but Augmented α1-Adrenergic Contractions in Renal Arteries Reversible by Weight Loss.</a></h2><p>Aging, obesity, and  favor vascular dysfunction. Endothelial activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has protective effects in .Mice with constitutive endothelial activation of AMPK (CA-AMPK) were given a high fat diet to induce obesity or kept on standard chow as lean controls for up to 2 years. A subset of obese animals was changed to standard chow after 30 weeks of high fat feeding. En-dothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent responses were examined by isometric tension recording.Endothelium-dependent nitric oxide (NO)- and apamin plus charybdotoxin-sensitive relaxations were preserved and similar between aortic or renal arterial preparations of lean and obese CA-AMPK mice and their wild-type littermates. Despite comparable release of vasoconstrictor prostanoids, cyclooxygenase-dependent contractions were enhanced during NO synthase inhibition in carotid arterial rings of obese CA-AMPK mice. Contractions to the α1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine were augmented in renal arteries of obese animals, a genotype-independent phenomenon reversible by weight loss. These data indicate a higher α1-adrenergic reactivity in renal arteries of aged mice with obesity. The current results highlight the potential of weight loss to alleviate vascular dysfunction. However, endothelial activation of the AMPK pathway in obesity may not be sufficient to prevent vascular dysfunction without lifestyle changes.© 2018 S.

It impairs the normal counter-regulatory hormonal and behavioral responses to glucose deprivation, a phenomenon known as hypoglycemia associated autonomic failure (HAAF). The molecular mechanisms leading to defective counter-regulation are not completely understood. We hypothesized that both neuronal (excessive cholinergic signaling between the splanchnic nerve fibers and the adrenal medulla) and humoral factors contribute to the impaired epinephrine production and release in HAAF. To gain further insight into the molecular mechanism(s) mediating the blunted epinephrine responses following recurrent hypoglycemia, we utilized a global gene expression profiling approach. We characterized the transcriptomes during recurrent (defective counter-regulation model) and acute hypoglycemia (normal counter-regulation group) in the adrenal medulla of normal Sprague-Dawley rats. Based on comparison analysis of differentially expressed genes, a set of unique genes that are activated only at specific time points after recurrent hypoglycemia were revealed. A complementary bioinformatics analysis of the functional category, pathway, and integrated network indicated activation of the unfolded protein response. Furthermore, at least three additional pathways/interaction networks altered in the adrenal medulla following recurrent hypoglycemia were identified, which may contribute to the impaired epinephrine secretion in HAAF: greatly increased neuropeptide signaling (proenkephalin, neuropeptide Y, galanin); altered ion homeostasis (Na+, K+, Ca2+) and downregulation of genes involved in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of secretory vesicles. Given the pleiotropic effects of the unfolded protein response in different organs, involved in maintaining glucose homeostasis, these findings uncover broader general mechanisms that arise following recurrent hypoglycemia which may afford clinicians an opportunity to modulate the magnitude of HAAF syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28346464>Sympathetic nervous system activity and anti-lipolytic response to iv-glucose load in subcutaneous adipose tissue of obese and obese type 2 diabetic subjects.</a></h2><p>The study aim was to investigate the effect of endogenous insulin release on lipolysis in subcutaneous adipose tissue after adrenergic stimulation in obese subjects diagnosed with type 2  (T2D). In 14 obese female T2D subjects, or 14 obese non-T2D controls, glycerol concentration was measured in response to the α1,2,ß-agonist norepinephrine, the α1-agonist norfenefrine and the ß2-agonist terbutaline (each 10-4 M), using the microdialysis technique. After 60 minutes of stimulation, an intravenous glucose load (0.5 g/kg lean body mass) was given. Local blood flow was monitored by means of the ethanol technique. Norepinephrine and norfenefrine induced a four and three fold rise in glycerol dialysate concentration (p<0.001, each), with a similar pattern in adipose tissue. Following agonist stimulation and glucose infusion, endogenous insulin release inhibited lipolysis in the presence of norepinephrine, which was more rapid and pronounced in healthy obese controls than in T2D subjects (p = 0.024 obese vs T2D subjects). Insulin-induced inhibition of lipolysis in the presence of norfenefrine was similar in all study participants. In the presence of terbutaline the lipolysis rate increased two fold until the effect of endogenous insulin (p<0.001). A similar insulin-induced decrease in lipolysis was observed for each of the norfenefrine groups and the terbutaline groups, respectively. Adipose tissue blood flow remained unchanged after the iv-glucose load. Both norepinephrine and norfenefrine diminished blood flow slightly, but insulin reversed this response (p<0.001 over the entire time). Terbutaline alone and terbutaline plus increased endogenous insulin augmented local blood flow (p<0.001 over the entire time). In conclusion, a difference in insulin-induced inhibition of lipolysis was observed in obese T2D subjects compared to obese healthy controls following modulation of sympathetic nervous system activity and is assumed to be due to ß1-adrenoceptor mediated stimulation by norepinephrine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27471776>Activation of Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors Decreases Apoptosis in Human and Female Murine Pancreatic Islets.</a></h2><p>Type 1  (T1DM) results from destruction of most insulin-secreting pancreatic β-cells. The persistence of β-cells decades after the onset of the disease indicates that the resistance of individual cells to the autoimmune insult is heterogeneous and might depend on the metabolic status of a cell at a given moment. The aim of this study is to investigate whether activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nACh-Rs) could increase β-cell resistance against the adverse environment prevailing at the onset of T1DM. Here, we show that nACh-R activation by nicotine and choline, 2 agonists of the receptor, decreases murine and human β-cell apoptosis induced by proinflammatory cytokines known to be present in the islet environment at the onset of T1DM. The protective mechanism activated by nicotine and choline involves attenuation of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization via modulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress, of the activity of B-cell lymphoma 2 family proteins and cytoplasmic calcium levels. Local inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress being key determinants of β-cell death in T1DM, we conclude that pharmacological activation of nACh-R could represent a valuable therapeutic option in the modulation of β-cell death in T1DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30696927>Mitochondrial uncoupling has no effect on microvascular complications in type 2 .</a></h2><p>Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), diabetic kidney disease (DKD), and diabetic retinopathy (DR) contribute to significant morbidity and mortality in  patients. The incidence of these complications is increasing with the  epidemic, and current therapies minimally impact their pathogenesis in type 2  (T2D). Improved mechanistic understanding of each of the diabetic complications is needed in order to develop disease-modifying treatments for patients. We recently identified fundamental differences in mitochondrial responses of peripheral nerve, kidney, and retinal tissues to T2D in BKS-db/db mice. However, whether these mitochondrial adaptations are the cause or consequence of tissue dysfunction remains unclear. In the current study BKS-db/db mice were treated with the mitochondrial uncoupler, niclosamide  (NEN), to determine the effects of mitochondrial uncoupling therapy on T2D, and the pathogenesis of DPN, DKD and DR. Here we report that NEN treatment from 6-24 wk of age had little effect on the development of T2D and diabetic complications. Our data suggest that globally targeting mitochondria with an uncoupling agent is unlikely to provide therapeutic benefit for DPN, DKD, or DR in T2D. These data also highlight the need for further insights into the role of tissue-specific metabolic reprogramming in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30301853>Octopaminergic Signaling Mediates Neural Regulation of Innate Immunity in Caenorhabditis elegans.</a></h2><p>Upon pathogen infection, the nervous system regulates innate immunity to confer coordinated protection to the host. However, the precise mechanisms of such regulation remain unclear. Previous studies have demonstrated that OCTR-1, a putative G protein-coupled receptor for catecholamine, functions in the sensory neurons designated "ASH" to suppress innate immune responses in  It is unknown what molecules act as OCTR-1 ligands in the neural immune regulatory circuit. Here we identify neurotransmitter octopamine (OA) as an endogenous ligand for OCTR-1 in immune regulation and show that the OA-producing RIC neurons function in the OCTR-1 neural circuit to suppress innate immunity. RIC neurons are deactivated in the presence of pathogens but transiently activated by nonpathogenic bacteria. Our data support a model whereby an octopaminergic immunoinhibitory pathway is tonically active under normal conditions to maintain immunological homeostasis or suppress unwanted innate immune responses but downregulated upon pathogen infection to allow enhanced innate immunity. As excessive innate immune responses have been linked to a myriad of human health concerns, our study could potentially benefit the development of more-effective treatments for innate immune disorders. Insufficient or excessive immune responses to pathogen infection are major causes of disease. Increasing evidence indicates that the nervous system regulates the immune system to help maintain immunological homeostasis. However, the precise mechanisms of this regulation are largely unknown. Here we show the existence of an octopaminergic immunoinhibitory pathway in  Our study results indicate that this pathway is tonically active under normal conditions to maintain immunological homeostasis or suppress unwanted innate immune responses but downregulated upon pathogen infection to allow enhanced innate immunity. As excessive innate immune responses have been linked to human health conditions such as Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, , and Alzheimer's disease, elucidating octopaminergic neural regulation of innate immunity could be helpful in the development of new treatments for innate immune diseases.Copyright © 2018 Sellegounder et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27562792>Dietary methyl donors affect in vivo methionine partitioning between transmethylation and protein synthesis in the neonatal piglet.</a></h2><p>Methionine metabolism is critical during development with significant requirements for protein synthesis and transmethylation reactions. However, separate requirements of methionine for protein synthesis and transmethylation are difficult to define because after transmethylation, demethylated methionine is either irreversibly oxidized to cysteine during transsulfuration, or methionine is regenerated by the dietary methyl donors, choline (via betaine) or folate during remethylation. We hypothesized that remethylation contributes significantly to methionine availability and affects partitioning between protein and transmethylation. 4-8-day-old neonatal piglets were fed a diet devoid (MD-) (n = 8) or replete (MS+) (n = 8) of folate, choline and betaine to limit remethylation. After 5 days, dietary methionine was reduced to 80 % of requirement in both groups of piglets to ensure methionine availability was limited. On day 7, an intragastric infusion of [C]methionine and [H-methyl]methionine was administered to measure methionine cycle flux. In MD- piglets, in vivo remethylation was 60 % lower despite 23-fold greater conversion of choline to betaine (P < 0.05) and transmethylation was 56 % lower (P < 0.05), suggesting dietary methyl donors spared 425 µmol methyl/day for transmethylation. The priority of protein synthesis versus transmethylation was clear during MD- feeding (P < 0.05), as an additional 6 % of methionine flux was for protein synthesis in those piglets (P < 0.05). However, whole body transsulfuration was unaffected in vivo despite reduced in vitro cystathionine-β-synthase capacity in MD- piglets (P < 0.05). Our data show that remethylation contributes significantly to methionine availability and that transmethylation is sacrificed to maintain protein synthesis when methionine is limiting in neonates, which should be considered when determining the methionine requirement.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27986658>Kvβ1.1 (AKR6A8) senses pyridine nucleotide changes in the mouse heart and modulates cardiac electrical activity.</a></h2><p>The present study investigates the physiological role of Kvβ1 subunit for sensing pyridine nucleotide (NADH/NAD+) changes in the heart. We used Kvβ1.1 knockout (KO) or wild-type (WT) mice and established that Kvβ1.1 preferentially binds with Kv4.2 and senses the pyridine nucleotide changes in the heart. The cellular action potential duration (APD) obtained from WT cardiomyocytes showed longer APDs with lactate perfusion, which increases intracellular NADH levels, while the APDs remained unaltered in the Kvβ1.1 KO. Ex vivo monophasic action potentials showed a similar response, in which the APDs were prolonged in WT mouse hearts with lactate perfusion; however, the Kvβ1.1 KO mouse hearts did not show APD changes upon lactate perfusion. COS-7 cells coexpressing Kv4.2 and Kvβ1.1 were used for whole cell patch-clamp recordings to evaluate changes caused by NADH (lactate). These data reveal that Kvβ1.1 is required in the mediated inactivation of Kv4.2 currents, when NADH (lactate) levels are increased. In vivo, isoproterenol infusion led to increased NADH in the heart along with QTc prolongation in wild-type mice; regardless of the approach, our data show that Kvβ1.1 recognizes NADH changes and modulates Kv4.2 currents affecting AP and QTc durations. Overall, this study uses multiple levels of investigation, including the heterologous overexpression system, cardiomyocyte, ex vivo, and ECG, and clearly depicts that Kvβ1.1 is an obligatory sensor of NADH/NAD changes in vivo, with a physiological role in the heart. Cardiac electrical activity is mediated by ion channels, and Kv4.2 plays a significant role, along with its binding partner, the Kvβ1.1 subunit. In the present study, we identify Kvβ1.1 as a sensor of pyridine nucleotide changes and as a modulator of Kv4.2 gating, action potential duration, and ECG in the mouse heart.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29299604>Association of Acylcarnitines With Left Ventricular Remodeling in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.</a></h2><p>Clinical practice guidelines currently endorse a reliance on clinical symptoms of overt left ventricular (LV) failure to time aortic valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis; however, delayed aortic valve replacement can result in irreversible LV injury and adverse outcomes. Blood metabolomic signatures possess prognostic value in heart failure; this study assesses whether they are informative in aortic stenosis.To evaluate the value of metabolomic signatures in reflecting the extent of maladaptive LV remodeling in patients with end-stage aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement, and to assess whether this procedure reverses metabolomic aberrations.This study of 44 patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis who underwent transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement at a single-center tertiary care hospital. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomic profiling was performed on blood samples collected before and 24 hours after the procedure, and analyses were conducted to identify metabolites related to the measures of LV remodeling.We evaluated LV ejection fraction, LV mass index, and relative wall thickness, as well as levels of the acylcarnitines C16, C18:1, C18:2, C18, C26, choline, and kynurenine.We enrolled 44 patients with severe aortic stenosis with a mean (SD) age of 81.9 (8.5) years, of whom 23 (52%) were women. The mean (SD) LV ejection fraction was 56.7% (18.2%), mean (SD) LV mass index was 117.3 (41.4) g/m2, and relative wall thickness was 0.53 (0.14). The mean β values of acylcarnitines C16, C18:1, C18:2, C18, and C26 were independently associated with LV mass index (C16: mean, 19.24; 95% CI, 5.48-33.01; P = .008; C18:1: mean, 26.18; 95% CI, 14.04-38.32; P < 1.0 × 10-4; C18:2: mean, 17.42; 95% CI, 3.40-31.43; P = .02; C18: mean, 25.25; 95% CI, 10.91-39.58; P = .001; C26: mean, 19.93; 95% CI, 4.41-35.45; P = .01), even after adjustments for age, sex,  status, renal function, and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). Circulating levels of C18:2 acylcarnitine were associated with LV ejection fraction before and after multivariable adjustment (mean, -6.11; 95% CI, -10.88 to 1.34; P = .01). Blood metabolite levels did not independently relate to relative wall thickness. Within 24 hours of transcatheter aortic valve replacement, circulating levels of C16 decreased by 30.2% (P = 7.3 × 10-6), C18:1 by 42.7% (P = 3.7 × 10-8), C18:2 by 37.3% (P = 5.1 × 10-6), and C18 by 38.3% (P = 3.4 × 10-5).In symptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement, circulating levels of long-chain acylcarnitines were independently associated with measures of maladaptive LV remodeling, and metabolic perturbations lessened after procedure completion.

We prospectively tested the effects of aspirin administration at commonly prescribed doses (81, 162, and 324 mg/day) on agonist-induced platelet aggregation by rs12041331 genotype in 67 healthy individuals. Prior to aspirin administration, rs12041331 minor allele carriers had significantly reduced adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation compared with noncarriers (P = 0.03) but was not associated with other platelet pathways. In contrast, rs12041331 was significantly associated with on-aspirin platelet aggregation when collagen and epinephrine were used to stimulate platelet aggregation (P < 0.05 for all associations), but not ADP. The influence of PEAR1 rs12041331 on platelet aggregation is pathway-specific and is altered by aspirin at therapeutic doses, but not in a dose-dependent manner.

We sought to correlate clinical and neurochemical findings with sympathetic nerve protein abundances, accessed by way of a forearm vein biopsy, in patients with PAF and in healthy controls and patients with multiple systems atrophy (MSA) in whom sympathetic nerves are considered intact. The abundance of sympathetic nerve proteins, extracted from forearm vein biopsy specimens, in 11 patients with PAF, 8 patients with MSA and 9 age-matched healthy control participants was performed following a clinical evaluation and detailed evaluation of sympathetic nervous system function, which included head-up tilt (HUT) testing with measurement of plasma catecholamines and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) in addition to haemodynamic assessment to confirm the clinical phenotype. PAF participants were found to have normal abundance of the NE transporter (NET) protein, together with very low levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (<0.0001) and reduced vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) (<0.05) protein expression compared with control and MSA participants. These findings were associated with a significantly higher ratio of plasma 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG):NE in PAF participants when compared with controls (<0.05). The finding of normal NET abundance in PAF suggests intact sympathetic nerves but with reduced NE synthesis. The finding of elevated plasma ratio of DHPG:NE and reduced VMAT2 in PAF indicates a shift towards intraneuronal NE metabolism over sequestration in sympathetic nerves and suggests that sympathetic dysfunction may occur ahead of denervation.© 2018 The Author(s).

Earlier we demonstrated that maternal choline supplementation normalizes fetal growth in GDM mice at mid-gestation. In this study, we further assess how choline and its oxidation product betaine influence determinants of placental nutrient transport in GDM mice and human trophoblasts. C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat (HF) diet 4 weeks prior to and during pregnancy to induce GDM or fed a control normal fat (NF) diet. The HF mice also received 25 mM choline, 85 mM betaine, or control drinking water. We observed that GDM mice had an expanded placental junctional zone with an increased area of glycogen cells, while the thickness of the placental labyrinth zone was decreased at E17.5 compared to NF control mice ( < 0.05). Choline and betaine supplementation alleviated these morphological changes in GDM placentas. In parallel, both choline and betaine supplementation significantly reduced glucose accretion ( < 0.05) in in vitro assays where the human choriocarcinoma BeWo cells were cultured in high (35.5 mM) or normal (5.5 mM) glucose conditions. Expression of angiogenic genes was minimally altered by choline or betaine supplementation in either model. In conclusion, both choline and betaine modified some but not all determinants of placental transport in response to hyperglycemia in mouse and in vitro human cell line models.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28512154>Glucose autoregulation is the dominant component of the hormone-independent counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia in the conscious dog.</a></h2><p>The contribution of hormone-independent counterregulatory signals in defense of insulin-induced hypoglycemia was determined in adrenalectomized, overnight-fasted conscious dogs receiving hepatic portal vein insulin infusions at a rate 20-fold basal. Either euglycemia was maintained () or hypoglycemia (≈45 mg/dl) was allowed to occur. There were three hypoglycemic groups: one in which hepatic autoregulation against hypoglycemia occurred in the absence of sympathetic nervous system input (), one in which autoregulation occurred in the presence of norepinephrine (NE) signaling to fat and muscle (), and one in which autoregulation occurred in the presence of NE signaling to fat, muscle, and liver (). Average net hepatic glucose balance (NHGB) during the last hour for  was -0.7 ± 0.1, 0.3 ± 0.1 ( < 0.01 vs. ), 0.7 ± 0.1 ( = 0.01 vs. ), and 0.8 ± 0.1 ( = 0.7 vs. ) mg·kg·min, respectively. Hypoglycemia per se () increased NHGB by causing an inhibition of net hepatic glycogen synthesis. NE signaling to fat and muscle () increased NHGB further by mobilizing gluconeogenic precursors resulting in a rise in gluconeogenesis. Lowering glucose per se decreased nonhepatic glucose uptake by 8.9 mg·kg·min, and the addition of increased neural efferent signaling to muscle and fat blocked glucose uptake further by 3.2 mg·kg·min The addition of increased neural efferent input to liver did not affect NHGB or nonhepatic glucose uptake significantly. In conclusion, even in the absence of increases in counterregulatory hormones, the body can defend itself against hypoglycemia using glucose autoregulation and increased neural efferent signaling, both of which stimulate hepatic glucose production and limit glucose utilization.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30087680>Regulation of Phagocytosis in Macrophages by Membrane  Plasmalogens.</a></h2><p>Macrophages, as professional phagocytes of the immune system, possess the ability to detect and clear invading pathogens and apoptotic cells through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis involves membrane reorganization and remodeling events on the cell surface, which play an essential role in innate immunity and tissue homeostasis and the control of inflammation. In this work, we report that cells deficient in membrane  plasmalogen demonstrate a reduced capacity to phagocytize opsonized zymosan particles. Amelioration of plasmalogen deficiency in these cells by incubation with lysoplasmalogen results in a significant augmentation of the phagocytic capacity of the cells. In parallel with these increases, restoration of plasmalogen levels in the cells also increases the number and size of lipid rafts in the membrane, reduces membrane fluidity down to levels found in cells containing normal plasmalogen levels, and improves receptor-mediated signaling. Collectively, these results suggest that membrane plasmalogen level determines characteristics of the plasma membrane such as fluidity and the formation of microdomains that are necessary for efficient signal transduction leading to optimal phagocytosis by macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31207311>Light at night exacerbates metabolic dysfunction in a polygenic mouse model of type 2 .</a></h2><p>Electric lighting is beneficial to modern society; however, it is becoming apparent that light at night (LAN) is not without biological consequences. Several studies have reported negative effects of LAN on health and behavior in humans and nonhuman animals. Exposure of non-diabetic mice to dim LAN impairs glucose tolerance, whereas a return to dark nights (LD) reverses this impairment. We predicted that exposure to LAN would exacerbate the metabolic abnormalities in TALLYHO/JngJ (TH) mice, a polygenic model of type 2  (T2DM).We exposed 7-week old male TH mice to either LD or LAN for 8-10 weeks in two separate experiments. After 8 weeks of light treatment, we conducted intraperitoneal glucose tolerance testing (ipGTT) followed by intraperitoneal insulin tolerance testing (ipITT). In Experiment 1, all mice were returned to LD for 4 weeks, and ipITT was repeated.The major results of this study are i) LAN exposure for 8 weeks exacerbates glucose intolerance and insulin resistance ii) the effects of LAN on insulin resistance are reversed upon return to LD, iii) LAN exposure results in a greater increase in body weight compared to LD exposure, iv) LAN increases the incidence of mice developing overt T2DM, and v) LAN exposure decreases survival of mice with T2DM.In conclusion, LAN exacerbated metabolic abnormalities in a polygenic mouse model of T2DM, and these effects were reversed upon return to dark nights. The applicability of these findings to humans with T2DM needs to be determined.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In Leishmania parasites, PC synthesis can occur via the choline branch of the Kennedy pathway, the N-methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), or the remodeling of exogenous phospholipids. To investigate the role of de novo PC synthesis in Leishmania major, we focused on the cholinephosphate cytidylyltransferase (CPCT) which catalyzes the formation of CDP-choline, a key intermediate in the choline branch of the Kennedy pathway. Without CPCT, L. major parasites cannot incorporate choline into PC, yet the CPCT-null mutants contain similar levels of PC and PE as wild type parasites. Loss of CPCT does not affect the growth of parasites in complete medium or their virulence in mice. These results suggest that other mechanisms of PC synthesis can compensate the loss of CPCT. Importantly, CPCT-null parasites exhibited severe growth defects when  and exogenous lipids became limited or when they were co-cultured with certain bacteria that are known to be members of sandfly midgut microbiota. These findings suggest that Leishmania employ multiple PC synthesis pathways to utilize a diverse pool of nutrients, which may be crucial for their survival and development in the sandfly.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27591221>Arterial baroreflex control of sympathetic nerve activity and heart rate in patients with type 2 .</a></h2><p>Despite greater blood pressure reactivity to acute cardiovascular stressors and a higher prevalence of hypertension in type 2  (T2D) patients, limited information is available regarding arterial baroreflex (ABR) control in T2D.

Seventeen T2D patients (50 ± 2 yr; 31 ± 1 kg/m), 9 weight-matched controls (WM-CON, 46 ± 2 yr; 32 ± 2 kg/m) and 10 lean controls (Lean-CON, 49 ± 3 yr; 23 ± 1 kg/m), underwent bolus infusions of sodium nitroprusside (100 μg) followed 60 s later by phenylephrine (150 μg) and weighted linear regression performed. No group differences in overall sympathetic baroreflex gain were observed (T2D: -2.5 ± 0.3 vs. WM-CON: -2.6 ± 0.2 vs. Lean-CON: -2.7 ± 0.4 arbitrary units·beat·mmHg, P > 0.05) or in sympathetic baroreflex gain when derived separately during blood pressure (BP) falls (nitroprusside) and BP rises (phenylephrine). In contrast, overall cardiac baroreflex gain was reduced in T2D patients compared with Lean-CON (T2D: 8.2 ± 1.5 vs. Lean-CON: 15.6 ± 2.9 ms·mmHg, P < 0.05) and also tended to be reduced in WM-CON (9.3 ± 1.9 ms·mmHg) compared with Lean-CON (P = 0.059). Likewise, during BP rises, cardiac baroreflex gain was reduced in T2D patients and weight-matched controls compared with lean controls (P < 0.05), whereas no group differences were found during BP falls (P > 0.05). Sympathetic and cardiac ABR gains were comparable between normotensive and hypertensive T2D patients (P > 0.05). These findings suggest preserved ABR control of MSNA in T2D patients compared with both obese and lean age-matched counterparts, with a selective impairment in ABR HR control in T2D that may be related to obesity.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27864387>Increased Trimethylamine N-Oxide Portends High Mortality Risk Independent of Glycemic Control in Patients with Type 2 .</a></h2><p>Recent studies show a mechanistic link between intestinal microbial metabolism of dietary phosphatidylcholine and coronary artery disease pathogenesis. Concentrations of a proatherogenic gut microbe-generated metabolite, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), predict increased incident cardiovascular disease risks in multiple cohorts. TMAO concentrations are increased in patients with type 2  (T2DM), but their prognostic value and relation to glycemic control are unclear.We examined the relationship between fasting TMAO and 2 of its nutrient precursors, choline and betaine, vs 3-year major adverse cardiac events and 5-year mortality in 1216 stable patients with T2DM who underwent elective diagnostic coronary angiography.TMAO [4.4 μmol/L (interquartile range 2.8-7.7 μmol/L) vs 3.6 (2.3-5.7 μmol/L); P < 0.001] and choline concentrations were higher in individuals with T2DM vs healthy controls. Within T2DM patients, higher plasma TMAO was associated with a significant 3.0-fold increased 3-year major adverse cardiac event risk (P < 0.001) and a 3.6-fold increased 5-year mortality risk (P < 0.001). Following adjustments for traditional risk factors and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, glycohemoglobin, and estimated glomerular filtration rate, increased TMAO concentrations remained predictive of both major adverse cardiac events and mortality risks in T2DM patients [e.g., quartiles 4 vs 1, hazard ratio 2.05 (95% CI, 1.31-3.20), P < 0.001; and 2.07 (95% CI, 1.37-3.14), P < 0.001, respectively].Fasting plasma concentrations of the proatherogenic gut microbe-generated metabolite TMAO are higher in diabetic patients and portend higher major adverse cardiac events and mortality risks independent of traditional risk factors, renal function, and relationship to glycemic control.© 2016 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29087480>Myeloid adrenergic signaling via CaMKII forms a feedforward loop of catecholamine biosynthesis.</a></h2><p>Type 2 immune response has been shown to facilitate cold-induced thermogenesis and browning of white fat. However, whether alternatively activated macrophages produce catecholamine and substantially promote adaptive thermogenesis in adipose tissue remains controversial. Here, we show that tyrosine hydroxylase (TyrH), a rate-limiting enzyme of catecholamine biosynthesis, was expressed and phosphorylated in adipose-resident macrophages. In addition, the plasma level of adrenaline was increased by cold stress in mice, and treatment of macrophages with adrenaline stimulated phosphorylation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and TyrH. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of CaMKII or PKA signaling diminished adrenaline-induced phosphorylation of TyrH in primary macrophages. Consistently, overexpression of constitutively active CaMKII upregulated basal TyrH phosphorylation, while suppressing the stimulatory effect of adrenaline on TyrH in macrophages. Myeloid-specific disruption of CaMKIIγ suppressed both the cold-induced production of norepinephrine and adipose UCP1 expression in vivo and the stimulatory effect of adrenaline on macrophage-dependent activation of brown adipocytes in vitro. Lack of CaMKII signaling attenuated catecholamine production mediated by cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, key inducers of type 2 immune response in primary macrophages. Taken together, these results suggest a feedforward mechanism of adrenaline in adipose-resident macrophages, and that myeloid CaMKII signaling plays an important role in catecholamine production and subsequent beige fat activation.© The Author (2017).

Anesthetized preterm fetal lambs were instrumented with ) aortic (AoT) and pulmonary trunk (PT) micromanometers to obtain pressures and the maximal rate of pressure rise (dP/d) as a surrogate measure of ventricular contractility, and ) an AoT catheter to obtain samples for blood gas and catecholamine analyses. After delivery, immediate cord clamping was followed by ventilation ∼40 s ( = 7), ∼60 s ( = 8), ∼90 s ( = 9), or ∼120 s later ( = 8), with frequent blood sampling performed before and after ventilation. AoT O content fell rapidly after immediate cord clamping ( < 0.001), with an asphyxial state evident at ≥60 s. Plasma NE and Epi levels increased progressively with longer cord clamp-to-ventilation intervals, with an exponential relation between falling AoT O content and rising catecholamines ( = 0.64-0.67). Elevated circulating catecholamines persisted for some minutes after ventilation onset, with postbirth surges in heart rate, AoT and PT pressures, and AoT and PT dP/d linearly related to log of catecholamine levels ( = 0.41-0.54, all  < 0.001). These findings suggest that ) a greater degree of asphyxia-induced sympathoadrenal activation (reflected in elevated circulating catecholamine levels) occurs with longer intervals between immediate cord clamping and subsequent ventilation, and ) this activation is a major determinant of hemodynamic fluctuations evident with birth.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27987236>Evaluation of the counter-regulatory responses to hypoglycaemia in patients with type 1  during opiate receptor blockade with naltrexone.</a></h2><p>Hypoglycaemia is the major limiting factor in achieving optimal glycaemic control in people with type 1  (T1DM), especially intensively treated patients with impaired glucose counter-regulation during hypoglycaemia. Naloxone, an opiate receptor blocker, has been reported to enhance the acute counter-regulatory response to hypoglycaemia when administered intravenously in humans. The current study was undertaken to investigate the oral formulation of the long-acting opiate antagonist, naltrexone, and determine if it could have a similar effect, and thus might be useful therapeutically in treatment of T1DM patients with a high risk of hypoglycaemia.We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, cross-over study in which 9 intensively treated subjects with T1DM underwent a 2-step euglycaemic-hypoglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp on 2 separate occasions. At 12 hours and at 1 hour before the clamp study, participants received 100 mg of naltrexone or placebo orally. Counter-regulatory hormonal responses were assessed at baseline and during each step of the hyperinsulinaemic-clamp.Glucose and insulin levels did not differ significantly between the naltrexone and placebo visits; nor did the glucose infusion rates required to keep glucose levels at target. During hypoglycaemia, naltrexone, in comparison with the placebo group, induced an increase in epinephrine levels ( P  = .05). However, no statistically significant differences in glucagon, cortisol and growth hormone responses were observed.In contrast to the intravenous opiate receptor blocker naloxone, overnight administration of the oral long-acting opiate receptor blocker, naltrexone, at a clinically used dose, had a limited effect on the counter-regulatory response to hypoglycaemia in intensively treated subjects with T1DM.© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30253326>Circulating epinephrine is not required for chronic stress to enhance metastasis.</a></h2><p>Signaling through β-adrenergic receptors drives cancer progression and β-blockers are being evaluated as a novel therapeutic strategy to prevent metastasis. Orthotopic mouse models of breast cancer show that β-adrenergic signaling induced by chronic stress accelerates metastasis, and that β-adrenergic receptors on tumor cells are critical for this. Endogenous catecholamines are released during chronic stress: norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla and sympathetic nerves, and epinephrine from the adrenal medulla. β-adrenergic receptors are much more sensitive to epinephrine than to norepinephrine. To determine if epinephrine is necessary in the effects of stress on cancer progression, we used a denervation strategy to eliminate circulating epinephrine, and quantified the effect on metastasis. Using both human xenograft and immune-intact murine models of breast cancer, we show that circulating epinephrine is dispensable for the effects of chronic stress on cancer progression. Measured levels of circulating norepinephrine were sufficiently low that they were unlikely to influence β-adrenergic signaling, suggesting a possible role for norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerve terminals.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Platelets activated by AGEs agonize endothelial responses promoting cardiovascular disease (CVD) development. While it has been established that AGEs can alter platelet functions, little is known about the specific platelet pathways that AGEs modify. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of AGEs on specific salient platelet pathways related to CVDs and whether the effects that AGEs elicit are dependent on glycation extent. To accomplish our objective, platelets were incubated with reversibly or irreversibly glycated albumin. A time course for adhesion and aggregation agonist receptor expression was assessed. Optical platelet aggregometry was used to confirm the functional activity of platelets after AGE exposure. In general, platelets subjected to glycated albumin had a significantly enhanced adhesion and aggregation potential. Furthermore, we observed an enhancement in dense body secretion and intracellular calcium concentration. This was especially prevalent for platelets exposed to irreversibly glycated albumin. Additionally, functional aggregation correlated well with receptor expression, suggesting that AGE-induced altered receptor sensitivity translated to altered platelet functions. Our findings indicate that under diabetic vascular conditions platelets become more susceptible to activation and aggregation due to an overall enhanced receptor expression, which may act to promote CVD development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29962474>[Dapagliflozin, a Sodium-Glucose Co-transporter-2 Inhibitor, Acutely Reduces Energy Expenditure in Brown Adipose Tissue via Neural Signals in Mice].</a></h2><p>　Selective sodium glucose transporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) treatment promotes urinary glucose excretion, thereby reducing blood glucose as well as body weight. However, only limited body weight reductions are achieved with SGLT2i administration. Hyperphagia is reportedly one of the causes of this limited weight loss. However, the effects of SGLT2i on systemic energy expenditure have not been fully elucidated. We investigated the acute effects of dapagliflozin, an SGLT2i, on systemic energy expenditure in mice. Eighteen hours after dapagliflozin administration, oxygen consumption and brown adipose tissue (BAT) expression of ucp1, a thermogenesis-related gene, were significantly decreased as compared with those after vehicle administration. In addition, dapagliflozin significantly suppressed norepinephrine (NE) turnover in BAT and c-fos expression in the rostral raphe pallidus nucleus (rRPa), which contains the sympathetic premotor neurons responsible for thermogenesis. These findings indicate that the dapagliflozin-mediated acute decrease in energy expenditure involves a reduction in BAT thermogenesis via decreased sympathetic nerve activity from the rRPa. Furthermore, common hepatic branch vagotomy abolished the reductions in ucp1 expression, NE contents in BAT, and c-fos expression in the rRPa. In addition, alterations in hepatic carbohydrate metabolism, such as decreases in glycogen contents and upregulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, occurred prior to the suppression of BAT thermogenesis, e.g., 6 h after dapagliflozin treatment. Collectively, these results suggest that SGLT2i acutely suppresses energy expenditure in BAT via regulation of an interorgan neural network consisting of the common hepatic vagal branch and sympathetic nerves.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29593014>Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Leak in Circulating B-Lymphocytes as a Biomarker in Heart Failure.</a></h2><p>Advances in congestive heart failure (CHF) management depend on biomarkers for monitoring disease progression and therapeutic response. During systole, intracellular Ca is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm through type-2 ryanodine receptor/Ca release channels. In CHF, chronically elevated circulating catecholamine levels cause pathological remodeling of type-2 ryanodine receptor/Ca release channels resulting in diastolic sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca leak and decreased myocardial contractility. Similarly, skeletal muscle contraction requires sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca release through type-1 ryanodine receptors (RyR1), and chronically elevated catecholamine levels in CHF cause RyR1-mediated sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca leak, contributing to myopathy and weakness. Circulating B-lymphocytes express RyR1 and catecholamine-responsive signaling cascades, making them a potential surrogate for defects in intracellular Ca handling because of leaky RyR channels in CHF.Whole blood was collected from patients with CHF, CHF following left-ventricular assist device implant, and controls. Blood was also collected from mice with ischemic CHF, ischemic CHF+S107 (a drug that specifically reduces RyR channel Ca leak), and wild-type controls. Channel macromolecular complex was assessed by immunostaining RyR1 immunoprecipitated from lymphocyte-enriched preparations. RyR1 Ca leak was assessed using flow cytometry to measure Ca fluorescence in B-lymphocytes in the absence and presence of RyR1 agonists that empty RyR1 Ca stores within the endoplasmic reticulum.Circulating B-lymphocytes from humans and mice with CHF exhibited remodeled RyR1 and decreased endoplasmic reticulum Ca stores, consistent with chronic intracellular Ca leak. This Ca leak correlated with circulating catecholamine levels. The intracellular Ca leak was significantly reduced in mice treated with the Rycal S107. Patients with CHF treated with left-ventricular assist devices exhibited a heterogeneous response.In CHF, B-lymphocytes exhibit remodeled leaky RyR1 channels and decreased endoplasmic reticulum Ca stores consistent with chronic intracellular Ca leak. RyR1-mediated Ca leak in B-lymphocytes assessed using flow cytometry provides a surrogate measure of intracellular Ca handling and systemic sympathetic burden, presenting a novel biomarker for monitoring response to pharmacological and mechanical CHF therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31370188>Cellular Plasmalogen Content Does Not Influence Arachidonic Acid Levels or Distribution in Macrophages: A Role for Cytosolic Phospholipase Aγ in Phospholipid Remodeling.</a></h2><p>Availability of free arachidonic acid (AA) constitutes a rate limiting factor for cellular eicosanoid synthesis. AA distributes differentially across membrane phospholipids, which is largely due to the action of coenzyme A-independent transacylase (CoA-IT), an enzyme that moves the fatty acid primarily from diacyl phospholipid species to ether-containing species, particularly the  plasmalogens. In this work, we examined the dependence of AA remodeling on plasmalogen content using the murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 and its plasmalogen-deficient variants RAW.12 and RAW.108. All three strains remodeled AA between phospholipids with similar magnitude and kinetics, thus demonstrating that cellular plasmalogen content does not influence the process. Cell stimulation with yeast-derived zymosan also had no effect on AA remodeling, but incubating the cells in AA-rich media markedly slowed down the process. Further, knockdown of cytosolic-group IVC phospholipase Aγ (cPLAγ) by RNA silencing significantly reduced AA remodeling, while inhibition of other major phospholipase A forms such as cytosolic phospholipase Aα, calcium-independent phospholipase Aβ, or secreted phospholipase A had no effect. These results uncover new regulatory features of CoA-IT-mediated transacylation reactions in cellular AA homeostasis and suggest a hitherto unrecognized role for cPLAγ in maintaining membrane phospholipid composition via regulation of AA remodeling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27591224>TNF receptor signaling inhibits cardiomyogenic differentiation of cardiac stem cells and promotes a neuroadrenergic-like fate.</a></h2><p>Despite expansion of resident cardiac stem cells (CSCs; c-kitLin) after myocardial infarction, endogenous repair processes are insufficient to prevent adverse cardiac remodeling and heart failure (HF). This suggests that the microenvironment in post-ischemic and failing hearts compromises CSC regenerative potential. Inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF), are increased after infarction and in HF; whether they modulate CSC function is unknown. As the effects of TNF are specific to its two receptors (TNFRs), we tested the hypothesis that TNF differentially modulates CSC function in a TNFR-specific manner. CSCs were isolated from wild-type (WT), TNFR1-/-, and TNFR2-/- adult mouse hearts, expanded and evaluated for cell competence and differentiation in vitro in the absence and presence of TNF. Our results indicate that TNF signaling in murine CSCs is constitutively related primarily to TNFR1, with TNFR2 inducible after stress. TNFR1 signaling modestly diminished CSC proliferation, but, along with TNFR2, augmented CSC resistance to oxidant stress. Deficiency of either TNFR1 or TNFR2 did not impact CSC telomerase activity. Importantly, TNF, primarily via TNFR1, inhibited cardiomyogenic commitment during CSC differentiation, and instead promoted smooth muscle and endothelial fates. Moreover, TNF, via both TNFR1 and TNFR2, channeled an alternate CSC neuroadrenergic-like fate (capable of catecholamine synthesis) during differentiation. Our results suggest that elevated TNF in the heart restrains cardiomyocyte differentiation of resident CSCs and may enhance adrenergic activation, both effects that would reduce the effectiveness of endogenous cardiac repair and the response to exogenous stem cell therapy, while promoting adverse cardiac remodeling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30261756>Plasma choline, homocysteine and vitamin status in healthy adults supplemented with krill oil: a pilot study.</a></h2><p>Plasma concentrations of metabolites along the choline oxidation and tryptophan degradation pathways have been linked to lifestyle diseases and dietary habits.

The pilot study was conducted as a 28 days intervention in 17 healthy volunteers (18-36 years), who received a supplement of 4.5 g krill oil per day, providing 833 mg ω-3 PUFAs, and 1750 mg phosphatidylcholine. Krill oil supplementation increased fasting plasma choline (+28.4%, p < .001), betaine (+26.6%, p < .001), dimethylglycine (+33.7%, p < .001) and sarcosine (+16.8%, p < .001), whereas no statistically significant changes were seen for plasma glycine, serine, methionine, total homocysteine, cysteine, cystathionine, methionine sulfoxide, folate, cobalamin, B-, B-, and B vitamers, tryptophan, kynurenines, nicotinamide, vitamin A and vitamin E. In summary, krill oil supplementation influenced choline metabolite levels, but not plasma metabolites of the tryptophan-kynurenine-nicotinamide pathways and vitamins.

We have previously shown that chemical inhibition of G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) slightly enhances insulin sensitivity and reduces endothelial dysfunction in type 2 diabetic mice. In this study, we identified GRK2 as a novel therapeutic target of diabetic endothelial dysfunction and investigated the effect on diabetic endothelial dysfunction through the systemic administration of GRK2 siRNA using a hydrodynamic-based procedure, resulting in suppression of increased GRK2 protein levels in the liver. Suppressed GRK2 levels in the liver markedly improved glucose homeostasis, as well as improved the impaired endothelial Akt/eNOS-dependent signal activation (insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS) and vascular responses (clonidine-induced and insulin-induced endothelial-dependent relaxation response and phenylephrine-induced contractile response) in type 2 diabetic aortas. Interestingly, insulin-stimulated Akt/eNOS signaling was increased only by normalizing the glucose concentration in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with GRK2 overexpression, suggesting of an important role of hepatic GRK2. Our results clarified the relationship among hepatic GRK2, glucose homeostasis, and vascular endothelial function. Liver-targeting GRK2 siRNA delivery represents a novel therapeutic tool to restore glucose homeostasis and reduce endothelial dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28213613>ATF4/ATG5 Signaling in Hypothalamic Proopiomelanocortin Neurons Regulates Fat Mass via Affecting Energy Expenditure.</a></h2><p>Although many biological functions of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) have been identified, a role of hypothalamic ATF4 in the regulation of energy homeostasis is poorly understood. In this study, we showed that hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neuron-specific ATF4 knockout (PAKO) mice are lean and have higher energy expenditure. Furthermore, PAKO mice were resistant to high-fat diet-induced obesity, glucose intolerance, and leptin resistance. Moreover, the expression of autophagy protein 5 (ATG5) was increased or decreased by ATF4 knockdown or overexpression, respectively, and ATF4 inhibited the transcription of ATG5 by binding to the basic zipper-containing protein sites on its promoter. Importantly, mice with double knockout of ATF4 and ATG5 in POMC neurons gained more fat mass and reduced energy expenditure compared with PAKO mice under a high-fat diet. Finally, the effect of ATF4 deletion in POMC neurons was possibly mediated via enhanced ATG5-dependent autophagy and α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone production in the hypothalamus. Taken together, these results identify the beneficial role of hypothalamic ATF4/ATG5 axis in the regulation of energy expenditure, obesity, and obesity-related metabolic disorders, which suggests that ATF4/ATG5 axis in the hypothalamus may be a new potential therapeutic target for treating obesity and obesity-related metabolic diseases.© 2017 by the American  Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30352954>Increased FGF21 in brown adipose tissue of tyrosine hydroxylase heterozygous mice: implications for cold adaptation.</a></h2><p>Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) catalyzes the first step in catecholamines synthesis. We studied the impact of reduced TH in brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation. In adult heterozygous ( ) mice, dopamine and noradrenaline (NA) content in BAT decreased after cold exposure. This reduced catecholaminergic response did not impair cold adaptation, because these mice induced uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1) and maintained BAT temperature to a similar extent than controls ( ).

Sestamibi scanning and ultrasound are most often used localization modalities with reported sensitivity of 54-100% for identification of single gland disease. The aim of this study was to analyze the results of pre-operative localization with F-Fluorocholine PET/CT (FCh-PET) in patients with PHP. A retrospective review of 151 patients with PHP who underwent surgery after pre-operative localization with FCh-PET was performed. Only a focused parathyroidectomy without ioPTH testing had been done in patients with single adenoma on FCh-PET. Primary outcome was operative failure, defined as persistent PHP. According to pre-operative FCh-PET 126 (83,4%) patients had single adenoma, 22 (14,5%) multiglandular disease and the test was negative in only two patients. Intraoperative failure experienced 4/126 patients (3,3%) with single adenoma. Removed parathyroid glands were normal in three and hyperplastic in one patient with intraoperative failure. A limited bilateral neck exploration with ioPTH testing was used in 14/22 patients with double adenoma and a classical four-gland exploration without ioPTH testing was used in 8/22 patients with more than two pathological glands according to pre-operative FCh-PET. Intraoperative failure experienced 2/22 patients (9,1%). In two patients with negative FCh-PET a classical four-gland exploration without ioPTH testing was used and one experienced intraoperative failure. A preoperative localization with FCh-PET is a reliable test in patients with PHP.

However, it is difficult to evaluate it due to the lack of non-invasive quantitative assessment. We aimed to establish a novel index to evaluate vascular autonomic function using reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT), a widely performed endothelial function test. Sixty-five subjects were enrolled, including healthy subjects, cases with sympathetic nerve blockers, and diabetic patients. RH-PAT was performed with 5-min blood flow occlusion in unilateral arm. We calculated the reduction ratio of the post-occlusion pulse amplitude to the baseline in the non-occluded arm (RPN), with 1-min sliding window. In healthy subjects, RPN gradually increased with time-dependent manner. However, this phenomenon was eliminated in cases with sympathetic nerve blockers. Plasma concentration of norepinephrine was measured before and after the blood flow occlusion, which showed a significant increase. We then compared RPNs with the change in heart rate variability (HRV) parameters. RPN calculated at 5 min after the reperfusion had the highest correlation with the change in sympathetic HRV parameter, and thus, we named sympathetic hypoemia index (SHI). Finally, we studied the relationship between SHI and . SHI was significantly lower in diabetic patients than matched controls.

The cardioprotective miRNA-133a (miR-133a) is downregulated, and contractility is decreased in diabetic hearts. Norepinephrine (NE) is a key catecholamine that stimulates contractility by activating β-adrenergic receptors (β-AR). NE is synthesized from tyrosine by the rate-limiting enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and tyrosine is catabolized by tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT). However, the cross talk/link between TAT and TH in the heart is unclear. To determine whether miR-133a plays a role in the cross talk between TH and TAT and regulates contractility by influencing NE biosynthesis and/or β-AR levels in diabetic hearts, Sprague-Dawley rats and miR-133a transgenic (miR-133aTg) mice were injected with streptozotocin to induce . The diabetic rats were then treated with miR-133a mimic or scrambled miRNA. Our results revealed that miR-133a mimic treatment improved the contractility of the diabetic rat's heart concomitant with upregulation of TH, cardiac NE, β-AR, and downregulation of TAT and plasma levels of NE. In miR-133aTg mice, cardiac-specific miR-133a overexpression prevented upregulation of TAT and suppression of TH in the heart after streptozotocin was administered. Moreover, miR-133a overexpression in CATH.a neuronal cells suppressed TAT with concomitant upregulation of TH, whereas knockdown and overexpression of TAT demonstrated that TAT inhibited TH. Luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-133a targets TAT. In conclusion, miR-133a controls the contractility of diabetic hearts by targeting TAT, regulating NE biosynthesis, and consequently, β-AR and cardiac function.© 2016 by the American  Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27422990>The von Hippel-Lindau Chuvash mutation in mice alters cardiac substrate and high-energy phosphate metabolism.</a></h2><p>Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) appears to function as a global master regulator of cellular and systemic responses to hypoxia. HIF pathway manipulation is of therapeutic interest; however, global systemic upregulation of HIF may have as yet unknown effects on multiple processes. We used a mouse model of Chuvash polycythemia (CP), a rare genetic disorder that modestly increases expression of HIF target genes in normoxia, to understand what these effects might be within the heart. An integrated in and ex vivo approach was employed. Compared with wild-type controls, CP mice had evidence (using in vivo magnetic resonance imaging) of pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular hypertrophy, and increased left ventricular ejection fraction. Glycolytic flux (measured using [(3)H]glucose) in the isolated contracting perfused CP heart was 1.8-fold higher. Net lactate efflux was 1.5-fold higher. Furthermore, in vivo (13)C-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of hyperpolarized [(13)C1]pyruvate revealed a twofold increase in real-time flux through lactate dehydrogenase in the CP hearts and a 1.6-fold increase through pyruvate dehydrogenase. (31)P-MRS of perfused CP hearts under increased workload (isoproterenol infusion) demonstrated increased depletion of phosphocreatine relative to ATP. Intriguingly, no changes in cardiac gene expression were detected. In summary, a modest systemic dysregulation of the HIF pathway resulted in clear alterations in cardiac metabolism and energetics. However, in contrast to studies generating high HIF levels within the heart, the CP mice showed neither the predicted changes in gene expression nor any degree of LV impairment. We conclude that the effects of manipulating HIF on the heart are dose dependent.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27919425>Takotsubo syndrome: Does it matter if you have ?

There are no effective drugs currently available for treating  and diabetic kidney disease (DKD), especially in type 1  (T1D). Evidence has suggested that niclosamide  salt (NEN) could improve diabetic symptoms in mice of type 2  (T2D). However, its role in T1D and DKD has not been studied to date. Here we report that NEN could protect against  in streptozotocin (STZ) induced T1D mice. It increased serum insulin levels, corrected the unbalanced ratio of α-cells to β-cells, and induced islet morphologic changes under diabetic conditions. In addition, NEN could impede the progression of DKD in T1D. Specifically, it reduced urinary albumin levels, NAG, NGAL and TGF-β1 excretion, ameliorated renal hypertrophy, alleviated podocyte dysfunction, and suppressed the renal cortical activation of mTOR/4E-BP1 signaling pathway. Moreover, it is hepatoprotective and does not exhibit heart toxicity. Therefore, these findings open up a completely novel therapy for  and DKD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29158033>Resident fibroblast expansion during cardiac growth and remodeling.</a></h2><p>Cardiac fibrosis, denoted by the deposition of extracellular matrix, manifests with a variety of diseases such as hypertension, , and myocardial infarction. Underlying this pathological extracellular matrix secretion is an expansion of fibroblasts. The mouse is now a common experimental model system for the study of cardiovascular remodeling and elucidation of fibroblast responses to cardiac growth and stress is vital for understanding disease processes. Here, using diverse but fibroblast specific markers, we report murine fibroblast distribution and proliferation in early postnatal, adult, and injured hearts. We find that perinatal fibroblasts and endothelial cells proliferate at similar rates. Furthermore, regardless of the injury model, fibroblast proliferation peaks within the first week after injury, a time window similar to the period of the inflammatory phase. In addition, fibroblast densities remain high weeks after the initial insult. These results provide detailed information regarding fibroblast distribution and proliferation in experimental methods of heart injury.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We aimed to comprehensively examine how changes induced by a weight-loss diet intervention in gut microbiota-related metabolites, such as trimethylamine -oxide (TMAO) and its precursors (choline and l-carnitine), were associated with improvements in adiposity and regional fat deposition.This study included 510 overweight and obese individuals who were randomly assigned one of four diets varying in macronutrient intake. We examined associations of 6-month changes in blood metabolites (TMAO, choline, and l-carnitine) with improvements in body weight (BW), waist circumference (WC), body fat composition, fat distribution, and resting energy expenditure (REE).Individuals with a greater reduction of choline ( < 0.0001) and l-carnitine ( < 0.01) rather than TMAO showed significant losses of BW and WC at 6 months. The reduction of choline was significantly predictive of decreases in body fat composition, fat distribution, and REE. Results of sensitivity analysis showed that the baseline  risk status, such as the presence of hyperglycemia (31% of the total participants) and fasting glucose levels, did not modify the associations. Early changes in choline and l-carnitine were significantly predictive of weight loss over 2 years ( < 0.05 for all). Individuals with increases in choline or l-carnitine were 2.35-times (95% CI 1.38, 4.00) or 1.77-times (1.06, 2.95) more likely to fail to lose weight (-5% or more loss) at 2 years.Overweight and obese individuals who showed decreases in circulating choline or l-carnitine levels achieved greater improvements of adiposity and energy metabolism by eating a low-calorie weight-loss diet, suggesting that such metabolites are predictive of individuals' response to the treatment. Further investigations are necessary to confirm our findings, particularly in a population with prediabetes that is more representative of the U.S. population with obesity.ClinicalTrials.gov .© 2018 by the American  Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28403937>Glucocorticoids modulate human brown adipose tissue thermogenesis in vivo.</a></h2><p>Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a thermogenic organ with substantial metabolic capacity and has important roles in the maintenance of body weight and metabolism. Regulation of BAT is primarily mediated through the β-adrenoceptor (β-AR) pathway. The in vivo endocrine regulation of this pathway in humans is unknown. The objective of our study was to assess the in vivo BAT temperature responses to acute glucocorticoid administration.We studied 8 healthy male volunteers, not pre-selected for BAT presence or activity and without prior BAT cold-activation, on two occasions, following an infusion with hydrocortisone (0.2mg.kg.min for 14h) and saline, respectively. Infusions were given in a randomized double-blind order. They underwent assessment of supraclavicular BAT temperature using infrared thermography following a mixed meal, and during β-AR stimulation with isoprenaline (25ng.kg fat-free mass.min for 60min) in the fasting state.During hydrocortisone infusion, BAT temperature increased both under fasting basal conditions and during β-AR stimulation. We observed a BAT temperature threshold, which was not exceeded despite maximal β-AR activation. We conclude that BAT thermogenesis is present in humans under near-normal conditions. Glucocorticoids modulate BAT function, representing important physiological endocrine regulation of body temperature at times of acute stress.Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The extent and functional relevance of these abnormalities have not been studied with quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis.To examine white matter microstructure, neural volumes, and central nervous system (CNS) metabolites in CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD) and to determine whether identified abnormalities are associated with cognition, glucocorticoid, and androgen exposure.A cross-sectional study at a tertiary hospital including 19 women (18 to 50 years) with 21OHD and 19 age-matched healthy women.Recruits underwent cognitive assessment and brain imaging, including diffusion weighted imaging of white matter, T1-weighted volumetry, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy for neural metabolites. We evaluated white matter microstructure by using tract-based spatial statistics. We compared cognitive scores, neural volumes, and metabolites between groups and relationships between glucocorticoid exposure, MRI, and neurologic outcomes.Patients with 21OHD had widespread reductions in white matter structural integrity, reduced volumes of right hippocampus, bilateral thalami, cerebellum, and brainstem, and reduced mesial temporal lobe total choline content. Working memory, processing speed, and digit span and matrix reasoning scores were reduced in patients with 21OHD, despite similar education and intelligence to controls. Patients with 21OHD exposed to higher glucocorticoid doses had greater abnormalities in white matter microstructure and cognitive performance.We demonstrate that 21OHD and current glucocorticoid replacement regimens have a profound impact on brain morphology and function. If reversible, these CNS markers are a potential target for treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560943>Chronic intermittent hypoxia-mediated renal sympathetic nerve activation in hypertension and cardiovascular disease.</a></h2><p>In sleep apnea syndrome (SAS), chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) is believed to activate the sympathetic nerve system, and is thus involved in cardiovascular diseases (CVD). However, since patients with SAS are often already obese, and have  and/or hypertension (HT), the effects of CIH alone on sympathetic nerve activation and its impacts on CVD are largely unknown. We, therefore, examined the effects of CIH on sympathetic nerve activation in non-obese mice to determine whether renal sympathetic nerve denervation (RD) could ameliorate CIH-mediated cardiovascular effects. Male C57BL/6 (WT) mice were exposed to normal (FiO 21%) or CIH (10% O, 12 times/h, 8 h/day) conditions for 4 weeks with or without RD treatment. Increased urinary norepinephrine (NE), 8-OHdG, and angiotensinogen levels and elevated serum asymmetric dimethyl arginine levels were observed in the CIH model. Concomitant with these changes, blood pressure levels were significantly elevated by CIH treatment. However, these deleterious effects by CIH were completely blocked by RD treatment. The present study demonstrated that CIH-mediated renal sympathetic nerve activation is involved in increased systemic oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and renin-angiotensin system activation, thereby contributing to the development of HT and CVD, thus could be an important therapeutic target in patients with SAS.</p></html>
