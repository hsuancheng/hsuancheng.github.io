Newer bacteriologic identification techniques (e.g., DNA probes) now exist. In a prospective point prevalence study of oropharyngeal S. pneumoniae carriage rates among outpatients, we compared standard organism identification techniques to DNA probe testing. By standard identification criteria, 35 (4%) of 872 isolates were characterized as presumptive S. pneumoniae. Thirty of 35 presumptive isolates were recoverable for DNA probing; 9 (30%) presumptive isolates were confirmed using a DNA probe. The antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of these DNA probe positive isolates closely paralleled that of clinical blood isolates of S. pneumoniae obtained during the study period. The 21 (70%) DNA probe negative isolates, which may represent phylogenetically related species (such as S. mitis or S. oralis), had significantly reduced antimicrobial susceptibility patterns when compared with the DNA probe positive isolates. In  studies, if classic criteria (optochin disc zone and bile solubility) are the sole means of identification, S. pneumoniae penicillin resistance rates may be over-reported.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24393040>Potential probiotic attributes and antagonistic activity of an indigenous isolate Lactobacillus plantarum DM5 from an ethnic fermented beverage "Marcha" of north eastern Himalayas.</a></h2><p>A novel isolate DM5 identified as Lactobacillus plantarum displayed in vitro probiotic properties as well as antimicrobial activity. It showed adequate level of survival to the harsh conditions of the gastrointestinal tract and survived low acidic pH 2.5 for 5 h. Artificial gastric juice and intestinal fluidic environment decreased the initial viable cell population of isolate DM5 only by 7% and 13%, respectively, while lysozyme (200 µg/ml) and bile salt (0.5%) enhanced its growth. It was found to deconjugate taurodeoxycholic , indicating its potential to reduce hypercholesterolemia. Isolate DM5 demonstrated cell surface hydrophobicity of 53% and autoaggregation of 54% which are the prerequisite for adhesion to epithelial cells and  to host. Bacteriocin activity of isolate was found to be 6400 AU/ml as it inhibited the growth of food borne pathogens Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Alcaligenes faecalis. The bactericidal action of bacteriocin from isolate was analyzed by flow cytometry, rendering its use as prospective probiotic and starter culture in food industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20688821>A ToxR-dependent role for the putative phosphoporin VCA1008 in bile salt resistance in Vibrio cholerae El Tor N16961.</a></h2><p>The putative phosphoporin encoded by vca1008 of Vibrio cholerae O1 is expressed in vivo during infection and is essential for the intestinal  of infant mice. In vitro, its expression is induced under inorganic phosphate (P(i)) limitation in a PhoB/R-dependent manner. In this work we demonstrated that VCA1008 has a strain-specific role in the physiology and pathogenicity of V. cholerae O1. Disruption of vca1008 led to a growth defect, an inability to colonize and a high susceptibility to sodium deoxycholate (DOC; the major bile compound) in the El Tor biotype strain N16961, but did not affect the classical strain O395 in the same way. Furthermore, vca1008 promoter activity was higher in N16961 cells grown under a low P(i) supply in the presence of DOC than in the absence of the detergent. In the P(i)-limited cells, vca1008 was positively regulated by PhoB, but when DOC was added to the medium, it negatively affected the PhoB-mediated activation of the gene, and enhanced vca1008 expression in a ToxR-dependent manner. These findings reveal for the first time a complex strain-specific interplay between ToxR and PhoB/R systems to control porin genes, as well as the influence of DOC on the expression of PhoB- and ToxR-regulated genes and pathogenesis in pandemic strains of V. cholerae.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20562307>Kinetic evidence for the presence of putative germination receptors in Clostridium difficile spores.</a></h2><p>Clostridium difficile is a spore-forming bacterium that causes Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD). Intestinal microflora keeps C. difficile in the spore state and prevents . Following antimicrobial treatment, the microflora is disrupted, and C. difficile spores germinate in the intestines. The resulting vegetative cells are believed to fill empty niches left by the depleted microbial community and establish infection. Thus, germination of C. difficile spores is the first required step in CDAD. Interestingly, C. difficile genes encode most known spore-specific protein necessary for germination, except for germination (Ger) receptors. Even though C. difficile Ger receptors have not been identified, taurocholate (a bile salt) and glycine (an amino ) have been shown to be required for spore germination. Furthermore, chenodeoxycholate, another bile salt, can inhibit taurocholate-induced C. difficile spore germination. In the present study, we examined C. difficile spore germination kinetics to determine whether taurocholate acts as a specific germinant that activates unknown germination receptors or acts nonspecifically by disrupting spores' membranes. Kinetic analysis of C. difficile spore germination suggested the presence of distinct receptors for taurocholate and glycine. Furthermore, taurocholate, glycine, and chenodeoxycholate seem to bind to C. difficile spores through a complex mechanism, where both receptor homo- and heterocomplexes are formed. The kinetic data also point to an ordered sequential progression of binding where taurocholate must be recognized first before detection of glycine can take place. Finally, comparing calculated kinetic parameters with intestinal concentrations of the two germinants suggests a mechanism for the preferential germination of C. difficile spores in antibiotic-treated individuals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29133896>The food-borne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni responds to the bile salt deoxycholate with countermeasures to reactive oxygen species.</a></h2><p>Bile plays an important role in digestion, absorption of fats, and the excretion of waste products, while concurrently providing a critical barrier against  by harmful bacteria. Previous studies have demonstrated that gut pathogens react to bile by adapting their protein synthesis. The ability of pathogens to respond to bile is remarkably complex and still incompletely understood. Here we show that Campylobacter jejuni, a leading bacterial cause of human diarrheal illness worldwide, responds to deoxycholate, a component of bile, by altering global gene transcription in a manner consistent with a strategy to mitigate exposure to reactive oxygen stress. More specifically, continuous growth of C. jejuni in deoxycholate was found to: 1) induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS); 2) decrease succinate dehydrogenase activity (complex II of the electron transport chain); 3) increase catalase activity that is involved in HO breakdown; and 4) result in DNA strand breaks. Congruently, the addition of 4-hydroxy-TEMPO (TEMPOL), a superoxide dismutase mimic that reacts with superoxide, rescued the growth of C. jejuni cultured in the presence of deoxycholate. We postulate that continuous exposure of a number of enteric pathogens to deoxycholate stimulates a conserved survival response to this stressor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20061165>Feasibility, tolerability, and outcomes of nebulized liposomal amphotericin B for Aspergillus infection prevention in lung transplantation.</a></h2><p>Nebulized amphotericin B deoxycholate (n-ABD) is used to prevent Aspergillus infection in lung transplantation. Nebulized liposomal amphotericin B (n-LAB) is another option; however, no clinical data are available on the results of n-LAB for this purpose.In an observational study performed in 2 centers to assess the feasibility, tolerability, and outcomes of n-LAB prophylaxis, 104 consecutive patients undergoing prophylaxis with n-LAB were compared with 49 historical controls who received n-ABD. Patient follow-up lasted 12 months. The n-LAB prophylaxis regimen was 25 mg thrice weekly starting on the first post-operative day and continuing to 60 days, 25 mg once weekly from 60 to 180 days, and the same dose once every 2 weeks thereafter.Aspergillus infection developed in 8 of 104 patients (7.7%) with n-LAB prophylaxis (5 , 1 simple tracheobronchitis, 1 ulcerative tracheobronchitis, and 1 invasive pulmonary infection). Ulcerative tracheobronchitis and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis were regarded as invasive disease; hence, the rate of invasive disease was 1.9% (2 patients). The control group had similar rates of Aspergillus infection (10.2%; p = 0.6) and invasive disease (4.1%; p = 0.43). In 3 patients (2.9%), n-LAB was withdrawn due to bronchospasm in 2 and nausea in 1. In the control group, prophylaxis was stopped in 2 patients (4.1%) because of bronchospasm (p = 0.7).At the dose and frequency described, n-LAB seems effective, safe, and convenient for the prevention of Aspergillus infection in lung transplant patients.Copyright (c) 2010 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

Human plasma, after dilution to 1 % (v/v) with buffer, was found to be a chemoattractant for the motile bacillus. Human gall-bladder bile, after dilution to 2 % (v/v) with buffer, was found to be a chemorepellent, but did not cause the motility of the bacillus to be diminished after prolonged exposure. The basis of the chemoattractant effect of plasma was explored by examining how urea and 12 amino acids found in plasma affected the taxis of H. pylori. Urea and the amino acids histidine, glutamine, glycine and arginine were the strongest chemoattractants. Other amino acids were chemoattractants, with the exceptions of aspartic and glutamic acids, which were chemorepellents. The basis of the chemorepellent effect of bile was explored by examining how the six most abundant conjugated bile acids in human bile affected the taxis of H. pylori. All the bile acids were chemorepellents, with the greatest effects being demonstrated by taurocholic and taurodeoxycholic acids. The implications of these findings for H. pylori  of gastric epithelium are discussed.Copyright 2004 SGM</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28878747> Antibacterial Activity of Unconjugated and Conjugated Bile Salts on .</a></h2><p>Bile salts are potent antimicrobial agents and are an important component of innate defenses in the intestine, giving protection against invasive organisms.

In this study, we investigated the antibacterial effects of the major unconjugated and conjugated bile salts on . Several concentration-dependent antibacterial mechanisms were found. Unconjugated bile salts at their minimum inhibitory concentration (cholic and  at 20 and 1 mM, respectively) killed , and this was associated with increased membrane disruption and leakage of cellular contents. Unconjugated bile salts (cholic and  at 8 and 0.4 mM, respectively) and conjugated bile salts (glycocholic and taurocholic  at 20 mM) at their sub inhibitory concentrations were still able to inhibit growth through disruption of the proton motive force and increased membrane permeability.

The initial stage in its pathogenesis after ingestion is to overcome colonization resistance that is maintained by the human intestinal . But how it overcomes colonization resistance is unknown. Recently developed humanized gnotobiotic mouse models have provided deeper insights into this initial stage and host's immune response. These studies have found that a fat-rich diet modifies the composition of the conventional intestinal  by increasing the Firmicutes and Proteobacteria loads while reducing the Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes loads creating an imbalance that exposes the intestinal epithelial cells to adherence. Upon adherence,  stimulates C. jejuni to synthesize Campylobacter invasion antigens, which invade the epithelial cells. In response, NF- κ B triggers the maturation of dendritic cells. Chemokines produced by the activated dendritic cells initiate the clearance of C. jejuni cells by inducing the actions of neutrophils, B-lymphocytes, and various subsets of T-cells. This immune response causes inflammation. This review focuses on the progress that has been made on understanding the relationship between intestinal  shift, establishment of C. jejuni infection, and consequent immune response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28348052>Bile  Administration Elicits an Intestinal Antimicrobial Program and Reduces the Bacterial Burden in Two Mouse Models of Enteric Infection.</a></h2><p>In addition to their chemical antimicrobial nature, bile acids are thought to have other functions in the homeostatic control of gastrointestinal immunity. However, those functions have remained largely undefined. In this work, we used ileal explants and mouse models of bile  administration to investigate the role of bile acids in the regulation of the intestinal antimicrobial response. Mice fed on a diet supplemented with 0.1% chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) showed an upregulated expression of Paneth cell α-defensins as well as an increased synthesis of the type-C lectins Reg3b and Reg3g by the ileal epithelium. CDCA acted on several epithelial cell types, by a mechanism independent from farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and not involving STAT3 or β-catenin activation. CDCA feeding did not change the relative abundance of major commensal bacterial groups of the ileum, as shown by 16S analyses. However, administration of CDCA increased the expression of ileal  and induced a change in the composition of the mucosal immune cell repertoire, decreasing the proportion of Ly6G and CD68 cells, while increasing the relative amount of IgGκ B cells. Oral administration of CDCA to mice attenuated infections with the bile-resistant pathogens  serovar Typhimurium and , promoting lower systemic  and faster bacteria clearance, respectively.

Such systems are composed of a sensor histidine kinase and a response regulator whose ultimate function is to affect the expression of target genes. Response regulator mutants of Campylobacter jejuni strain F38011 were screened for sensitivity to sodium deoxycholate. A mutation in Cj0643, which encodes a response regulator with no obvious cognate histidine kinase, resulted in an absence of growth on plates containing a subinhibitory concentration of sodium deoxcholate (1%, wt/vol). In broth cultures containing 0.05% (wt/vol) sodium deoxycholate, growth of the mutant was significantly inhibited compared to growth of the C. jejuni F38011 wild-type strain. Complementation of the C. jejuni cbrR mutant in trans restored growth in both broth and plate cultures supplemented with sodium deoxycholate. Based on the phenotype displayed by its mutation, we designated the gene corresponding to Cj0643 as cbrR (Campylobacter bile resistance regulator). While the MICs of a variety of bile salts and other detergents for the C. jejuni cbrR mutant were lower, no difference was noted in its sensitivity to antibiotics or osmolarity. Finally, chicken  studies demonstrated that the C. jejuni cbrR mutant had a reduced ability to colonize compared to the wild-type strain. These data support previous findings that bile resistance contributes to  of chickens and establish that the response regulator, CbrR, modulates resistance to bile salts in C. jejuni.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601882>Microbial metabolite  controls Clostridium perfringens-induced chicken necrotic enteritis through attenuating inflammatory cyclooxygenase signaling.</a></h2><p>Necrotic enteritis (NE) caused by Clostridium perfringens infection has reemerged as a prevalent poultry disease worldwide due to reduced usage of prophylactic antibiotics under consumer preferences and regulatory pressures. The lack of alternative antimicrobial strategies to control this disease is mainly due to limited insight into the relationship between NE pathogenesis, microbiome, and host responses. Here we showed that the microbial metabolic byproduct of secondary bile   (DCA), at as low as 50 µM, inhibited 82.8% of C. perfringens growth in Tryptic Soy Broth (P < 0.05). Sequential Eimeria maxima and C. perfringens challenges significantly induced NE, severe intestinal inflammation, and body weight (BW) loss in broiler chickens. These negative effects were diminished (P < 0.05) by 1.5 g/kg DCA diet. At the cellular level, DCA alleviated NE-associated ileal epithelial death and significantly reduced lamina propria cell apoptosis. Interestingly, DCA reduced C. perfringens invasion into ileum (P < 0.05) without altering the bacterial ileal luminal . Molecular analysis showed that DCA significantly reduced inflammatory mediators of Infγ, Litaf, Il1β, and Mmp9 mRNA accumulation in ileal tissue. Mechanism studies revealed that C. perfringens induced (P < 0.05) elevated expression of inflammatory mediators of Infγ, Litaf, and Ptgs2 (Cyclooxygenases-2 (COX-2) gene) in chicken splenocytes. Inhibiting the COX signaling by aspirin significantly attenuated INFγ-induced inflammatory response in the splenocytes. Consistent with the in vitro assay, chickens fed 0.12 g/kg aspirin diet protected the birds against NE-induced BW loss, ileal inflammation, and intestinal cell apoptosis. In conclusion, microbial metabolic product DCA prevents NE-induced BW loss and ileal inflammation through attenuating inflammatory response. These novel findings of microbiome protecting birds against NE provide new options on developing next generation antimicrobial alternatives against NE.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23289436>Resistance to bile salts and sodium deoxycholate in macrolide- and fluoroquinolone-susceptible and resistant Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli strains.</a></h2><p>Campylobacter are the most commonly reported bacterial causes of human gastroenteritis, and they are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics, including macrolides and fluoroquinolones, those most frequently used for the treatment of campylobacteriosis. Active efflux mechanisms are involved in resistance of Campylobacter to a broad spectrum of antimicrobials, and are also essential for Campylobacter colonization in the animal intestine, through mediation of bile resistance. Acquisition of antibiotic resistance through resistance-conferring mutations can impose a fitness cost of Campylobacter. The aim of the present study was to determine whether macrolide and fluoroquinolone resistance in Campylobacter affects their tolerance to bile salts and sodium deoxycholate through the most frequent resistance-conferring mutations. Antimicrobial efflux was studied on the basis of restored sensitivity in the presence of the efflux-pump inhibitors (EPIs) phenylalanine-arginine beta-naphthylamide (PAβN) and 1-(1-naphthylmethyl)-piperazine. In the 15 Campylobacter jejuni and 23 Campylobacter coli strains examined here, both of these EPIs partially reversed the resistance to bile salts and sodium deoxycholate. Erythromycin-sensitive C. coli strains were more resistant to bile salts and sodium deoxycholate than erythromycin-resistant strains. PAβN had greater effects on bile salt and sodium deoxycholate resistance in these erythromycin-resistant strains compared to erythromycin-sensitive strains.

An isolated segment of rabbit esophagus was perfused at pH 7 with a solution containing the test agent under study, and the severity of mucosal damage was assessed by using as indicators of mucosal integrity transmucosal potential difference, net flux of Na+, and mucosal permeability to two neutral molecules of different sizes, 3H-H2O and 14C-erythritol. The data indicate that the secondary dihydroxy bile salt, deoxycholate, in its deconjugated form was highly injurious to esophageal mucosa; it was the only test agent that caused gross mucosal lesions during the experiment. The respective conjugated bile salt moiety, taurodeoxycholate, had a weaker effect. Also the primary dihydroxy bile salt, chenodeoxycholate, in its deconjugated form caused moderate damage to the mucosa, whereas its conjugated form, taurochenodeoxycholate, had no effect. The effect of the other three bile salts tested--cholate, taurocholate, and taurolithocholate--was negligible. Trypsin also adversely affected the mucosa, but its effect was weaker than that of deoxycholate. The results suggest that the deconjugated bile salts deoxycholate and chenodeoxycholate (which are formed following bacterial  of the upper gastrointestinal tract in the absence of gastric ), the conjugated bile salt taurodeoxycholate, and the proteolytic enzyme trypsin may have significant roles in the pathogenesis of alkaline reflux esophagitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25348856>Safety and efficacy of amphotericin-B deoxycholate inhalation in critically ill patients with respiratory Candida spp. : a retrospective analysis.</a></h2><p>Candida spp. are frequently cultured from the respiratory tract in critically ill patients.

The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of ABDC inhalation for the treatment of respiratory Candida spp.  in critically ill patients.All non-neutropenic patients admitted into the intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital from December 2010-2011, who had positive Candida spp. cultures of the respiratory tract for more than 1 day and required mechanical ventilation >48 h were retrospectively included. The decision to start ABDC inhalation had been made by attending intensivists on clinical grounds in the context of selective decontamination of the digestive tract. Infection characteristics and patient courses were assessed.Hundred and thirteen consecutive patients were studied. Fifty-one of them received ABDC inhalation and their characteristics at baseline and day 1 of respiratory  did not differ from those of colonized patients not receiving treatment (n = 62). The ABDC-treated group had a similar Candida spp. load but did not decolonize more rapidly as compared to untreated patients. The clinical pulmonary infection and lung injury scores did not decrease as in the untreated group. In a Cox proportional hazard model, the duration of mechanical ventilation was increased (P < 0.003) by ABDC treatment independently of other potential determinants and Candida spp. . No differences in ventilator-associated pneumonia or in overall mortality (up to day 90) were observed.Treatment of respiratory Candida spp.  in non-neutropenic critically ill patients by inhaled ABDC may not affect respiratory  but may increase duration of mechanical ventilation, because of direct toxicity of the drug on the lung.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29089630>The food-borne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni depends on the AddAB DNA repair system to defend against bile in the intestinal environment.</a></h2><p>Accurate repair of DNA damage is crucial to ensure genome stability and cell survival of all organisms. Bile functions as a defensive barrier against intestinal  by pathogenic microbes. Campylobacter jejuni, a leading bacterial cause of foodborne illness, possess strategies to mitigate the toxic components of bile. We recently found that growth of C. jejuni in medium with deoxycholate, a component of bile, caused DNA damage consistent with the exposure to reactive oxygen species. We hypothesized that C. jejuni must repair DNA damage caused by reactive oxygen species to restore chromosomal integrity. Our efforts focused on determining the importance of the putative AddAB DNA repair proteins. A C. jejuni addAB mutant demonstrated enhanced sensitivity to deoxycholate and was impaired in DNA double strand break repair. Complementation of the addAB mutant restored resistance to deoxycholate, as well as function of the DNA double strand break repair system. The importance of these findings translated to the natural host, where the AddAB system was found to be required for efficient C. jejuni  of the chicken intestine.

Bile acids are one class of these signaling molecules, synthesized by the host and chemically transformed by the gut microbiota. Among bile  metabolizers, bile  7-dehydroxylating bacteria are commensals of particular importance as they carry out the 7-dehydroxylation of liver-derived primary bile acids to 7-dehydroxylated bile acids.

Here, we detail the bile  transformations carried out by the 7-dehydroxylating bacterium  and  exhibits not only 7α-dehydroxylating capabilities but also, the ability to oxidize other hydroxyl groups and reduce ketone groups in primary and secondary bile acids. This study revealed 12-oxolithocholic  as a major transient product in the 7α-dehydroxylation of cholic . Furthermore, the  study included complementing a gnotobiotic mouse line (devoid of the ability to 7-dehydroxylate bile acids) with  and investigating its  dynamics and bile  transformations.

As a causative agent, Candida albicans is the most common; however, the other Candida species can also cause the same clinical syndromes. Most invasive fungal infections in children occur in the hospital setting. Candidemia is a serious condition associated with high morbidity and mortality and increased healthcare costs in pediatric patients. Children at the highest risk are those with prolonged intensive care unit stays, reduced immune function, recent surgery, prior bacterial infection, prior use of antibiotics and/or corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents, as well as use of a central venous catheter, total parenteral nutrition, mechanical ventilation and dialysis. Positive blood culture is the gold standard of candidemia; it should not be accepted as contamination or  in children with an intravascular catheter. However, in oropharyngeal or vulvovaginal candidiasis, culture of lesions is rarely indicated unless the disease is recalcitrant or recurrent. Recovery of Candida from the sputum should usually be considered as  and should not be treated with antifungal therapy. Antigen and antibody detecting tests are evaluated in invasive Candida infections; however, there are no published results in children, and their roles in diagnosis are also unclear. For the therapy of invasive Candida infections in non-neutropenic patients, fluconazole or an echinocandin is usually recommended. Alternatively, amphotericin B deoxycholate or lipid formulations of amphotericin B can also be used. The recommended therapy of Candida meningitis is amphotericin B combined with flucytosine.

In all these functions their potency is modulated by a variety of chemical modifications catalyzed by bacteria of the healthy gut microbiota, generating a complex variety of secondary bile acids. Intestinal commensal organisms are well-adapted to normal concentrations of bile acids in the gut. In contrast, physiological concentrations of the various intestinal bile  species play an important role in the resistance to intestinal  by pathogens such as . Antibiotic therapy can perturb the gut microbiota and thereby impair the production of protective secondary bile acids. The most important bile  transformation is 7α-dehydroxylation, producing  (DCA) and lithocholic  (LCA). The enzymatic pathway carrying out 7α-dehydroxylation is restricted to a narrow phylogenetic group of commensal bacteria, the best-characterized of which is . Like many other intestinal commensal species, 7-dehydroxylating bacteria are understudied . Conventional animals contain variable and uncharacterized indigenous 7α-dehydroxylating organisms that cannot be selectively removed, making controlled  with a specific strain in the context of an undisturbed microbiota unfeasible. In the present study, we used a recently established, standardized gnotobiotic mouse model that is stably associated with a simplified murine 12-species "oligo-mouse microbiota" (Oligo-MM). It is representative of the major murine intestinal bacterial phyla, but is deficient for 7α-dehydroxylation. We find that the Oligo-MM consortium carries out bile  deconjugation, a prerequisite for 7α-dehydroxylation, and confers no resistance to  infection (CDI).

However, the factors involved in C. albicans gastrointestinal (GI)  remain unclear. We hypothesize that secondary bile acids have direct antifungal activity against C. albicans and may play a critical role in maintaining GI  resistance against C. albicans. In this study, we investigated the effect of secondary bile acids including lithocholic  (LCA) and  (DCA) on C. albicans growth and morphogenesis. Results indicate that LCA and DCA at in vivo cecal micelle concentrations inhibit C. albicans growth in vitro. Interestingly, LCA and DCA also significantly inhibited the germ tube, hyphae and biofilm formation in C. albicans. In addition, pre-treatment of C. albicans with LCA and DCA significantly reduced the percentage of C. albicans cells attached to a colon cancer cell line. Collectively, our results demonstrate that secondary bile acids play an important role in controlling the growth and morphological switching of C. albicans. Results from this study demonstrate that secondary bile  possess direct antifungal activity against C. albicans, explaining a potential mechanism for gastrointestinal  resistance against C. albicans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16804679>Characterization of the Vibrio cholerae vexAB and vexCD efflux systems.</a></h2><p>Vibrio cholerae is an important human pathogen that causes the diarrheal disease cholera.  of the human host is dependent upon coordinated expression of several virulence factors in response to as yet unknown environmental cues. Bile acids have been implicated in the in vitro regulation of several V. cholerae genes, including those involved in motility, chemotaxis, outer membrane protein production, and virulence factor production. Bile is toxic to bacteria and  of the intestinal tract is dependent upon bacterial resistance to bile acids. We have identified and characterized two bile-regulated RND-family efflux systems, named here vexAB and vexCD, that are involved in V. cholerae bile resistance. Mutational analysis revealed that the vexAB system is responsible for in vitro intrinsic resistance of V. cholerae to multiple antimicrobial compounds, including bile acids. In contrast, the vexCD efflux system was specific for certain bile acids and detergents and functioned in conjunction with the vexAB system to provide V. cholerae with high-level bile resistance. Mutants containing deletion of vexB, vexD, and vexB-vexD were able to efficiently colonize the infant mouse suggesting that these efflux systems were dispensable for V. cholerae growth in the small intestines of infant mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12147479>Oxalobacter formigenes and its potential role in human health.</a></h2><p>Oxalate degradation by the anaerobic bacterium Oxalobacter formigenes is important for human health, helping to prevent hyperoxaluria and disorders such as the development of kidney stones. Oxalate-degrading activity cannot be detected in the gut flora of some individuals, possibly because Oxalobacter is susceptible to commonly used antimicrobials. Here, clarithromycin, doxycycline, and some other antibiotics inhibited oxalate degradation by two human strains of O. formigenes. These strains varied in their response to gut environmental factors, including exposure to gastric acidity and bile salts. O. formigenes strains established oxalate breakdown in fermentors which were preinoculated with fecal bacteria from individuals lacking oxalate-degrading activity. Reducing the concentration of oxalate in the medium reduced the numbers of O. formigenes bacteria. Oxalate degradation was established and maintained at dilution rates comparable to colonic transit times in healthy individuals. A single oral ingestion of O. formigenes by adult volunteers was, for the first time, shown to result in (i) reduced urinary oxalate excretion following administration of an oxalate load, (ii) the recovery of oxalate-degrading activity in feces, and (iii) prolonged retention of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21700235>[Scedosporium apiospermum disseminated infection in a single lung transplant recipient].</a></h2><p>Scedosporium spp. are filamentous fungi, and the 2 most important species are Scedosporium prolificans and Scedosporium apiospermum. S. apiospermum accounts for approximately 25% of non-Aspergillus filamentous fungi infections in organ transplant recipients. Scedosporium can colonize the sinuses and airways of lung recipients with underlying pulmonary diseases, such as bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis before transplant, and develop invasive disease after lung transplantation. In fact, invasive diseases caused by S. apiospermum have been reported only rarely, in single lung transplant recipients and cystic fibrosis transplant patients. The treatment of scedosporiasis is complicated due to the difficulty in early diagnosis together with inherent resistance to amphotericin B.A case of disseminated S. apiospermum infection after single lung transplant in a patient with pulmonary fibrosis is reported. Leg mycetoma was the initial sign of this disseminated infection. In this case report, current treatment options are discussed, and a review of the literature of previously published cases of lung transplants is made.One conclusion based on this case is the risk of emergent molds related to antifungal prophylaxis. In addition,  by Scedosporium in transplant recipients should not be ignored, and target prophylaxis or suppressive therapy should be considered in all those cases with residual lesions in native lung or chronic rejection in transplanted lungs.Copyright © 2011 Revista Iberoamericana de Micología.

The signals that initiate C. difficile spore germination are a combination of taurocholic  (a bile ) and glycine. Interestingly, the chenodeoxycholic  class (CDCA) bile acids competitively inhibit taurocholic -mediated germination, suggesting that compounds that inhibit spore germination could be developed into drugs that prophylactically prevent C. difficile infection or reduce recurring disease. However, a recent report called into question the utility of such a strategy to prevent infection by describing C. difficile strains that germinated in the apparent absence of bile acids or germinated in the presence of the CDCA inhibitor. Because the mechanisms of C. difficile spore germination are beginning to be elucidated, the mechanism of germination in these particular strains could yield important information on how C. difficile spores initiate germination. Therefore, we quantified the interaction of these strains with taurocholic  and CDCA, the rates of spore germination, the release of DPA from the spore core, and the abundance of the germinant receptor complex (CspC, CspB, and SleC). We found that strains previously observed to germinate in the absence of taurocholic  correspond to more potent 50% effective concentrations (EC50 values; the concentrations that achieve a half-maximum germination rate) of the germinant and are still inhibited by CDCA, possibly explaining the previous observations. By comparing the germination kinetics and the abundance of proteins in the germinant receptor complex, we revised our original model for CspC-mediated activation of spore germination and propose that CspC may activate spore germination and then inhibit downstream processes.Clostridium difficile forms metabolically dormant spores that persist in the health care environment. In susceptible hosts, C. difficile spores germinate in response to certain bile acids and glycine. Blocking germination by C. difficile spores is an attractive strategy to prevent the initiation of disease or to block recurring infection. However, certain C. difficile strains have been identified whose spores germinate in the absence of bile acids or are not blocked by known inhibitors of C. difficile spore germination (calling into question the utility of such strategies). Here, we further investigate these strains and reestablish that bile  activators and inhibitors of germination affect these strains and use these data to suggest another role for the C. difficile bile  germinant receptor.Copyright © 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

Spores are resistant to heat, radiation, chemicals, and antibiotics, making a contaminated environment difficult to clean. To cause disease, however, spores must germinate and grow out as vegetative cells. The germination of C. difficile spores has not been examined in detail. In an effort to understand the germination of C. difficile spores, we characterized the response of C. difficile spores to bile. We found that cholate derivatives and the amino  glycine act as cogerminants. Deoxycholate, a metabolite of cholate produced by the normal intestinal flora, also induced germination of C. difficile spores but prevented the growth of vegetative C. difficile. A model of resistance to C. difficile  mediated by the normal bacterial flora is proposed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/328394>Parasitism by virulent Treponema pallidum of host cell surfaces.</a></h2><p>The interaction between virulent Treponema pallidum extracted from infected rabbit testes and animal cells in culture was examined. The extent of treponemal attachment to monolayers of normal rabbit testicular and HEp-2 cells was dependent upon the incubation temperature and retained motility of the spirochetes. The specific orientation of treponemes to host cell surfaces was demonstrated by dark-field microscopic examination of wet-mount preparations and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Once attached, T. pallidum organisms remained actively motile yet anchored in place by their terminal tapered structures. After several hours of co-incubation, maximal attachment was attained, and the degree of parasitism seemed regulated not only by available surface sites on individual host cells but also by the proposed membrane response of parasitized cells to continued exposure to treponemes. The avirulent strain, Treponema phagedenis biotype Reiter, did not adhere to monolayer cultures. Characterization of host cell determinants that permitted surface  by T. pallidum was attempted. Also, properties of virulent treponemes that enabled surface parasitism were monitored by measuring the effects of enzymes, detergents, and metabolic inhibitors on the host-parasite interaction. Results reinforced the specific nature of the treponemal attachment mechanism. Furthermore, the ability of convalescent rabbit sera to reduce attachment of treponemes to host cells suggested that surface structures on T. pallidum could be masked or inactivated by host components, thus providing a potentially effective research approach for investigating the pathogenesis of syphilis and screening appropriate vaccine candidates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17544611>[Management of fungal urinary tract infections].</a></h2><p>Fungal urinary tract infections (funguria) are rare in community medicine, but common in hospitals where 10 to 30% of urine cultures isolate Candida species. Clinical features vary from asymptomatic urinary tract  (the most common situation) to cystitis, pyelonephritis, or even severe sepsis with fungemia. The pathologic nature of funguria is closely related to host factors, and management depends mainly on the patient's underlying health status. Microbiological diagnosis of funguria is usually based on a fungal concentration of more than 10(3)/mm(3) in urine. No cutoff point has been defined for leukocyte concentration in urine. Candida albicans is the most commonly isolated species, but previous antifungal treatment and previous hospitalization affect both species and susceptibility to antifungal agents. Treatment is recommended only when funguria is symptomatic or in cases of fungal  when host factors increase the risk of fungemia. The antifungal agents used for funguria are mainly fluconazole and amphotericin B deoxycholate, because other drugs have extremely low concentrations in urine. Primary and secondary preventions are essential. The reduction of risk factors requires removing urinary catheters, limiting antibiotic treatment, and optimizing diabetes mellitus treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22952616>Campylobacter jejuni type VI secretion system: roles in adaptation to , host cell adherence, invasion, and in vivo colonization.</a></h2><p>The recently identified type VI secretion system (T6SS) of proteobacteria has been shown to promote pathogenicity, competitive advantage over competing microorganisms, and adaptation to environmental perturbation. By detailed phenotypic characterization of loss-of-function mutants, in silico, in vitro and in vivo analyses, we provide evidence that the enteric pathogen, Campylobacter jejuni, possesses a functional T6SS and that the secretion system exerts pleiotropic effects on two crucial processes--survival in a bile salt,  (DCA), and host cell adherence and invasion. The expression of T6SS during initial exposure to the upper range of physiological levels of DCA (0.075%-0.2%) was detrimental to C. jejuni proliferation, whereas down-regulation or inactivation of T6SS enabled C. jejuni to resist this effect. The C. jejuni multidrug efflux transporter gene, cmeA, was significantly up-regulated during the initial exposure to DCA in the wild type C. jejuni relative to the T6SS-deficient strains, suggesting that inhibition of proliferation is the consequence of T6SS-mediated DCA influx. A sequential modulation of the efflux transporter activity and the T6SS represents, in part, an adaptive mechanism for C. jejuni to overcome this inhibitory effect, thereby ensuring its survival. C. jejuni T6SS plays important roles in host cell adhesion and invasion as T6SS inactivation resulted in a reduction of adherence to and invasion of in vitro cell lines, while over-expression of a hemolysin co-regulated protein, which encodes a secreted T6SS component, greatly enhanced these processes. When inoculated into B6.129P2-IL-10(tm1Cgn) mice, the T6SS-deficient C. jejuni strains did not effectively establish persistent colonization, indicating that T6SS contributes to colonization in vivo. Taken together, our data demonstrate the importance of bacterial T6SS in host cell adhesion, invasion, colonization and, for the first time to our knowledge, adaptation to DCA, providing new insights into the role of T6SS in C. jejuni pathogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22278765>Role of anionic charges of osmoregulated periplasmic glucans of Salmonella                      enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344 in mice virulence.</a></h2><p>opgB gene of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium was identified earlier in a genome-wide screen for mice virulence (Valentine et al. in Infect Immun 66:3378-3383, 1998). Although mutation in opgB resulted in avirulent Salmonella strain, how this gene contributes to pathogenesis remains unclear. Based on DNA homology, opgB is predicted to be responsible for adding phosphoglycerate residues to osmoregulated periplasmic glucans (OPGs) giving them anionic characteristics. In Escherichia coli, yet another gene, opgC, is also reported to contribute to anionic characteristics of OPGs by adding succinic  residues. We constructed opgB, opgC, and opgBC double mutants of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain SL1344. As predicted opgBC mutant synthesized neutral OPGs that were devoid of any anionic substituents. However, opgB, opgC, and opgBC mutations had no significant impact on mice virulence as well as on competitive organ . In low osmotic conditions, opgB, opgC, and opgBC mutants exhibited delay in growth initiation in the presence of sodium deoxycholate. Anionic substituents of OPGs from Salmonella although appear to be needed to overcome resistance of deoxycholate in hypoosmotic growth media, no evidence was found for their role in mice virulence.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31276498>Microbial metabolite  shapes microbiota against Campylobacter jejuni chicken .</a></h2><p>Despite reducing the prevalent foodborne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni in chickens decreases campylobacteriosis, few effective approaches are available. The aim of this study was to use microbial metabolic product bile acids to reduce C. jejuni chicken . Broiler chicks were fed with  (DCA), lithocholic  (LCA), or ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA). The birds were also transplanted with DCA modulated anaerobes (DCA-Anaero) or aerobes (DCA-Aero). The birds were infected with human clinical isolate C. jejuni 81-176 or chicken isolate C. jejuni AR101. Notably, C. jejuni 81-176 was readily colonized intestinal tract at d16 and reached an almost plateau at d21. Remarkably, DCA excluded C. jejuni cecal  below the limit of detection at 16 and 28 days of age. Neither chicken ages of infection nor LCA or UDCA altered C. jejuni AR101 chicken  level, while DCA reduced 91% of the bacterium in chickens at d28. Notably, DCA diet reduced phylum Firmicutes but increased Bacteroidetes compared to infected control birds. Importantly, DCA-Anaero attenuated 93% of C. jejuni  at d28 compared to control infected birds. In conclusion, DCA shapes microbiota composition against C. jejuni  in chickens, suggesting a bidirectional interaction between microbiota and microbial metabolites.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29215765>Helicobacter pylori induces caudal-type homeobox protein 2 and cyclooxygenase 2 expression by modulating microRNAs in esophageal epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been linked to virulence factors of Helicobacter pylori. The role of H. pylori in esophageal disease has not been clearly defined. We previously reported that H. pylori esophageal  promotes the incidence of Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma in vivo. Here, we studied the direct effects of H. pylori on the transformation of esophageal epithelial cells, with particular focus on whether H. pylori exerts its effects by modulating miRNAs and their downstream target genes. The normal human esophageal cell line HET-1A was chronically exposed to H. pylori extract and/or acidified  for up to 36 weeks. The miRNA profiles of the esophageal epithelial cells associated with H. pylori infection were determined by microarray analysis. We found that chronic H. pylori exposure promoted acidified -induced morphological changes in HET-1A cells, along with aberrant overexpression of intestinal metaplasia markers and tumorigenic factors, including caudal-type homeobox protein 2 (CDX2), mucin 2, and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2). Helicobacter pylori modified the miRNA profiles of esophageal epithelial cells, particularly aberrant silencing of miR-212-3p and miR-361-3p. Moreover, in biopsies from Barrett's esophagus patients, esophageal H. pylori  was associated with a significant decrease in miR-212-3p and miR-361-3p expression. Furthermore, we identified COX2 as a target of miR-212-3p, and CDX2 as a target of miR-361-3p. Helicobacter pylori infection of esophageal epithelial cells was associated with miRNA-mediated upregulation of oncoprotein CDX2 and COX2. Our observations provide new evidence about the molecular mechanisms underlying the association between H. pylori infection and esophageal carcinogenesis.© 2017 The Authors.

However, little is known regarding how the development of the intestinal microbial community is associated with maturation of intestinal BA metabolism. To address this, we monitored the succession of gut bacterial community and its association with fecal BA profile in the first 3 y of ten healthy Japanese infants. The BA profiles were classified into four types, defined by high content of conjugated primary BA (Con type), unconjugated primary BA (chenodeoxycholic  and cholic ) (Pri type), ursodeoxycholic  (Urs type), and  and lithocholic  (Sec type). Most subjects begun with Con type or Pri type profiles during lactation and eventually transited to Sec type through Urs type after the start of solid food intake. Con type and Pri type were associated with -dominant microbiota corresponding to the neonatal type or -dominant microbiota corresponding to lactation type, respectively. Urs type subjects were strongly associated with  , mostly occurring between Pri type and Sec type. Sec type was associated with adult-type complex microbiota dominated by a variety of  and  species. Addressing the link of the common developmental passage of intestinal BA metabolism with infant's health and subsequent host physiology requires further study.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24403598>Methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins 3 and 4 are responsible for Campylobacter jejuni chemotaxis and jejuna  in mice in response to sodium deoxycholate.</a></h2><p>Methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs), also termed transducer-like proteins (Tlps), serve as sensors in bacterial chemotactic signalling, and detect attractants and promote bacterial movement towards suitable sites for .

At the same time, it can be noted that the growth of bacteria can be inhibited by bile acids. We studied 40 patients with chronic gastritis related to Helicobacter pylori in order to determine the effect of ursodeoxycholic  on this infection. Diagnoses of the infection and the inflammatory process were obtained by histologic study of gastric biopsies collected during endoscopy.

The  by Helicobacter pylori and the intensity of the mononuclear and polymorphonuclear inflammatory infiltrate were determined before (time 1) and after (time 2) treatment. Ursodeoxycholic  had no effect on the Helicobacter pylori infection. A significant reduction in the intensity of the mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate of the gastric antrum mucosa was observed in patients from group I, when we compared not only times 1 and 2 but also groups I and II. However, this was not the case with the body mucosa. We concluded that ursodeoxycholic  had no action on the  by Helicobacter pylori or on the polymorphonuclear inflammatory infiltrate, but it caused a significant reduction in the intensity of the mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate of the gastric antrum.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28867623>, resistance to bile, and virulence properties of Escherichia coli strains: Unusual characteristics associated with biliary tract diseases.</a></h2><p>Escherichia coli is the species that is most frequently isolated from bile of patients with biliary tract diseases. This study was aimed to investigate any association between resistance and virulence properties of these isolates with occurrence of the diseases. A total of 102 bile samples were obtained from patients subjected to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for different biliary diseases. Clinical data were collected and culture of the bile samples was done on selective media. Resistance of characterized Escherichia coli isolates to deoxycholate sodium (0-7%) and nineteen antibiotics was determined and PCR using 16 pairs of primers targeting stx1, stx2, exhA, eae, bfp, agg, pcvd432, lt, st, ipaH, pic, pet, ast, set, sen, and cdtB genes was done. Our results showed a statistically significant association between E. coli  and existence of common bile duct and gallbladder stones (p value 0.028). Out of the 22 E. coli strains (22/102) multidrug resistance phenotype was present in 95.45%. None of the strains belonged to common E. coli pathotypes. However, bfp + EhxA-hly, bfp + astA, bfp + EhxA-hly + pic, and EhxA-hly + pic + astA, bfp, and astA genotypes were detected in these strains. bfp (7/22, 31.8%) and astA (5/22, 22.7%) were among most frequent virulence factors in these strains. Results of this study showed significant association between  of E. coli and choledocholithiasis. Unusual existence of virulence gene combinations in these strains and their resistance to DOC and multiple classes of antibiotics could be considered as possible causes of their persistence in this harsh microenvironment.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
