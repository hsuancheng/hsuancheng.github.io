Recent data suggest that faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) using faeces from postbariatric surgery diet-induced obese mice in germ-free mice improves glucose metabolism and intestinal homeostasis. We here investigated whether allogenic FMT using faeces from post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass donors (RYGB-D) compared with using faeces from metabolic syndrome donors (METS-D) has short-term effects on glucose metabolism, intestinal transit time and adipose tissue inflammation in treatment-naïve, obese, insulin-resistant male subjects.Subjects with metabolic syndrome (n=22) received allogenic FMT either from RYGB-D or METS-D. Hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity as well as lipolysis were measured at baseline and 2 weeks after FMT by hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic stable isotope (H-glucose and H-glycerol) clamp. Secondary outcome parameters were changes in resting energy expenditure, intestinal transit time, faecal short-chain   () and bile , and inflammatory markers in subcutaneous adipose tissue related to intestinal microbiota composition. Faecal , bile , glycaemic control and inflammatory parameters were also evaluated at 8 weeks.We observed a significant decrease in insulin sensitivity 2 weeks after allogenic METS-D FMT (median rate of glucose disappearance: from 40.6 to 34.0 µmol/kg/min; p<0.01). Moreover, a trend (p=0.052) towards faster intestinal transit time following RYGB-D FMT was seen. Finally, we observed changes in faecal bile  (increased lithocholic,  and (iso)lithocholic  after METS-D FMT), inflammatory markers (decreased adipose tissue chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) gene expression and plasma CCL2 after RYGB-D FMT) and changes in several intestinal microbiota taxa.Allogenic FMT using METS-D decreases insulin sensitivity in metabolic syndrome recipients when compared with using post-RYGB-D. Further research is needed to delineate the role of donor characteristics in FMT efficacy in human insulin-resistant subjects.NTR4327.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Dietary habits are one of the main causative factors for metabolic syndrome, CVD and type 2 diabetes. The human gut microbiota is emerging as an important player in the interaction between diet and metabolic health. Gut microbial communities contribute to human metabolism through fermentation of dietary fibre and the result of intestinal saccharolytic fermentation is production of . Acetate, propionate and butyrate positively influence satiety, endocrine system, glucose homeostasis, adipogenesis, lipid oxidation, thermoregulation, hepatic gluconeogenesis, endothelial function and gut barrier integrity, and these mechanisms have all been linked to protection from type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular health. The gut microbiota is also involved in bile  metabolism and regulating their cell signalling potential, which has also been shown to modify pathways involved in metabolic health. Similarly, the gut microbiota renders recalcitrant plant polyphenols into biologically active small phenolic compounds which then act systemically to reduce metabolic disease risk. This review summarises how dietary patterns, specific foods and a healthy lifestyle may modulate metabolic health through the gut microbiota and their molecular cross-talk with the host.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27727520>The therapeutic landscape of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterized by lobular inflammation and hepatocellular ballooning, and may be associated with liver fibrosis leading to cirrhosis and its complications. A pharmacological approach is necessary to treat NASH because of failure to change dietary habits and lifestyle in most patients. Insulin resistance with an increased release of free  , oxidative stress and activation of inflammatory cytokines seem to be key features for disease progression. Thiazolidinediones, such as pioglitazone and antioxidant agents, such as vitamin E, were the first pharmacological options to be evaluated for NASH. In recent years, several new molecules that target different pathways related to NASH pathogenesis, such as liver metabolic homeostasis, inflammation, oxidative stress and fibrosis, have been developed. Obeticholic  (INT-747) and elafibranor (GFT-505) have provided promising results in phase IIb, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials and they are being evaluated in ongoing phase III studies. Most of the potential treatments for NASH are under investigation in phase II studies, with some at phase I. This diversity in possible treatments calls for a better understanding of NASH in order to enrich trial populations with patients more susceptible to progress and to respond. This manuscript aims to review the pharmacological NASH treatment landscape.© 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Rat feces were collected from 2 to 4 weeks following exposure and were assessed for gut-microbiota-dependent metabolites. Gut-microbiota-related organic  were quantitated in the feces using 2-nitrophenylhydrazine derivatization coupled HPLC-profiling method which was validated and showed good reliability, accuracy and sensitivity. After 2-week exposure, AFB1 significantly reduced the levels of fecal short-chain   (SCFAs) with an over 70% reduction in the high-dose group (75 μg/kg). Mixed-effects model revealed an inverse correlation between AFB1 dose and fecal levels of SCFAs, but no significant time effect was found. When compared with the control, oral exposure to middle-dose AFB1 (25 μg/kg) resulted in remarkable elevations of fecal cholic  (2.18-fold), linoleic  (cis-9, cis-12-18:2) (11.3-fold), pentadecanoic  (15: 0) (3.68-fold), pyruvic  (4.56-fold), and 3-phenyllactic  (3.74-fold), but  level was reduced by 41% in the low-dose group (5 μg/kg). These results demonstrated the disruptions of several important gut-microbiota metabolic pathways, including the synthesis of SCFAs, pyruvic  related pathways, metabolisms of amino , bile  and long-chain  , which may further affect host digestive efficiency, energy supply, intestinal immunity, production of neurotransmitters, and enterohepatic cross-talk. Our study suggests that the impairment of gut-microbiota-dependent metabolism may contribute to pathological mechanisms of AFB1-induced adverse health effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26026836>Butyrate and  play common and distinct roles in HCT116 human colon cell proliferation.</a></h2><p>Consumption of a high-fat diet causes an increase in bile   (DCA) in colon lumen and colon cancer risk, while butyrate, an intestinal  metabolite of dietary fiber, has been shown to exhibit colon cancer-preventive effects. To distinguish these opposing effects of DCA and butyrate (two major metabolites in colon lumen), we examined the effects of physiologically relevant doses of butyrate (0.5-2 mmol/l) and DCA (0.05-0.3 mmol/l) on colon cell proliferation. We hypothesize that butyrate and DCA each modulates the cell cycle and apoptosis via common and distinct cellular signaling targets. In this study, we demonstrated that both butyrate and DCA inhibited cell proliferation by up to 89% and 92% and increased cell apoptosis rate by up to 3.1- and 4.5-fold, respectively. Cell cycle analyses revealed that butyrate led to an increase in G1 and G2 fractions with a concomitant drop in the S-phase fraction, but DCA induced an increase in only G1 fraction with a concomitant drop in the S-phase fraction when compared with the untreated cells. The examination of early cellular signaling revealed that DCA but not butyrate increased intracellular reactive oxygen species, genomic DNA breakage, the activation of ERK1/2, caspase-3 and PARP. In contrast, DCA decreased activated Rb protein level, and butyrate but not DCA increased p21 expression. Collectively, although both butyrate and DCA inhibit colonic cell proliferation, butyrate increases tumor suppressor gene expression, whereas DCA decreases tumor suppressor activation in cell cycle and apoptosis pathways.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30025704>Inhibiting Growth of Clostridioides difficile by Restoring Valerate, Produced by the Intestinal .</a></h2><p>   (FMT) is effective for treating recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), but there are concerns about its long-term safety. Understanding the mechanisms of the effects of FMT could help us design safer, targeted therapies. We aimed to identify microbial metabolites that are important for C difficile growth.We used a CDI chemostat model as a tool to study the effects of FMT in vitro. The following analyses were performed: C difficile plate counts, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and ultra-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry bile  profiling. FMT mixtures were prepared using fresh  samples provided by donors enrolled in an FMT program in the United Kingdom. Results from chemostat experiments were validated using human stool samples, C difficile batch cultures, and C57BL/6 mice with CDI. Human stool samples were collected from 16 patients with recurrent CDI and healthy donors (n = 5) participating in an FMT trial in Canada.In the CDI chemostat model, clindamycin decreased valerate and  concentrations and increased C difficile total viable counts and valerate precursors, taurocholic , and succinate concentrations. After we stopped adding clindamycin, levels of bile acids and succinate recovered, whereas levels of valerate and valerate precursors did not. In the CDI chemostat model, FMT increased valerate concentrations and decreased C difficile total viable counts (94% decrease), spore counts (86% decrease), and valerate precursor concentrations; concentrations of bile acids were unchanged. In stool samples from patients with CDI, valerate was depleted before FMT but restored after FMT. Clostridioides difficile batch cultures confirmed that valerate decreased vegetative growth, and that taurocholic  was required for germination but had no effect on vegetative growth. Clostridioides difficile total viable counts were decreased by 95% in mice with CDI given glycerol trivalerate compared with phosphate buffered saline.We identified valerate as a metabolite that is depleted with clindamycin and only recovered with FMT. Valerate is a target for a rationally designed recurrent CDI therapy.Copyright © 2018 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In most cases of NAFLD, metabolic stress and cellular apoptosis are often driven by metabolic abnormality, eventually leading to inflammation and fibrosis . Along with a dramatic surge in the obesity epidemic, 10-20% of NAFLD patients ultimately progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a precursor to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as multi-organ systemic diseases. Currently, diet and exercise are chiefly recommended to achieve significant weight loss and improve metabolic dysfunction in patients with NAFLD. However, weight loss remains to be an elusive goal for both clinical practitioners and NAFLD patients. To date, although there has not been any proven pharmacotherapy against NAFLD, numerous promising pipelines with good target engagement are under development. Moreover, given the global landmark phase 3 trials using obeticholic  (a farnesoid X receptor agonist, REGENERATE trial) and elafibranor (a dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α/δ agonist, RESOLVE-IT trial), the era of specific target therapies focusing on molecular and metabolic pathogenesis of NASH and fibrosis is near at hand. In this paper, we briefly cover the current and future therapeutic options in patients with NAFLD across the entire spectrum of diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29375204>Metabolic and hepatic effects of liraglutide, obeticholic  and elafibranor in diet-induced obese mouse models of biopsy-confirmed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the pharmacodynamics of compounds in clinical development for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in obese mouse models of biopsy-confirmed NASH.Male wild-type C57BL/6J mice (DIO-NASH) and Lep  (-NASH) mice were fed a diet high in trans-fat (40%), fructose (20%) and cholesterol (2%) for 30 and 21 wk, respectively. Prior to treatment, all mice underwent liver biopsy for confirmation and stratification of liver steatosis and fibrosis, using the nonalcoholic  liver disease activity score (NAS) and fibrosis staging system. The mice were kept on the diet and received vehicle, liraglutide (0.2 mg/kg, SC, BID), obeticholic  (OCA, 30 mg/kg PO, QD), or elafibranor (30 mg/kg PO, QD) for eight weeks. Within-subject comparisons were performed on changes in steatosis, inflammation, ballooning degeneration, and fibrosis scores. In addition, compound effects were evaluated by quantitative liver histology, including percent fractional area of liver fat, galectin-3, and collagen 1a1.Liraglutide and elafibranor, but not OCA, reduced body weight in both models. Liraglutide improved steatosis scores in DIO-NASH mice only. Elafibranor and OCA reduced histopathological scores of hepatic steatosis and inflammation in both models, but only elafibranor reduced fibrosis severity. Liraglutide and OCA reduced total liver fat, collagen 1a1, and galectin-3 content, driven by significant reductions in liver weight. The individual drug effects on NASH histological endpoints were supported by global gene expression (RNA sequencing) and liver lipid biochemistry.DIO-NASH and -NASH mouse models show distinct treatment effects of liraglutide, OCA, and elafibranor, being in general agreement with corresponding findings in clinical trials for NASH. The present data therefore further supports the clinical translatability and utility of DIO-NASH and -NASH mouse models of NASH for probing the therapeutic efficacy of compounds in preclinical drug development for NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31032975>Microbiome and Metabolome Profiles Associated With Different Types of Short Bowel Syndrome: Implications for Treatment.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiome and metabolome may significantly influence clinical outcomes in patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS). The study aimed to describe specific metagenomic/metabolomics profiles of different SBS types and to identify possible therapeutic targets.Fecal microbiome (FM), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and bile  (BA) spectrum were analyzed in parenteral nutrition (PN)-dependent SBS I, SBS II, and PN-independent (non-PN) SBS patients.FM in SBS I, SBS II, and non-PN SBS shared characteristic features (depletion of beneficial anaerobes, high abundance of Lactobacilaceae and Enterobacteriaceae). SBS I patients were characterized by the abundance of oxygen-tolerant microrganisms and depletion of strict anaerobes. Non-PN SBS subjects showed markers of partial FM normalization. FM  was translated into VOC and BA profiles characteristic for each SBS cohort. A typical signature of all SBS patients comprised high saturated aldehydes and medium-chain fatty acids and reduced short-chain fatty  (SCFA) content. Particularly, SBS I and II exhibited low protein metabolism intermediate (indole, p-cresol) content despite the hypothetical presence of relevant metabolism pathways. Distinctive non-PN SBS marker was high phenol content. SBS patients' BA fecal spectrum was enriched by chenodeoxycholic and  acids and depleted of lithocholic .Environmental conditions in SBS gut significantly affect FM composition and metabolic activity. The common feature of diverse SBS subjects is the altered VOC/BA profile and the lack of important products of microbial metabolism. Strategies oriented on the microbiome/metabolome reconstitution and targeted delivery of key compounds may represent a promising therapeutic strategy in SBS patients.© 2019 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28661219>Feeding of the water extract from Ganoderma lingzhi to rats modulates secondary bile , intestinal microflora, mucins, and propionate important to colon cancer.</a></h2><p>Consumption of reishi mushroom has been reported to prevent colon carcinogenesis in rodents, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate this effect, rats were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with 5% water extract from either the reishi mushroom (Ganoderma lingzhi) (WGL) or the auto-digested reishi G. lingzhi (AWGL) for three weeks. Both extracts markedly reduced fecal secondary bile , such as lithocholic  and  (colon carcinogens). These extracts reduced the numbers of Clostridium coccoides and Clostridium leptum (secondary bile -producing bacteria) in a per g of cecal digesta. Fecal mucins and cecal propionate were significantly elevated by both extracts, and fecal IgA was significantly elevated by WGL, but not by AWGL. These results suggest that the reishi extracts have an impact on colon luminal health by modulating secondary bile , microflora, mucins, and propionate that related to colon cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26997214>Treatment of nonalcoholic  liver disease: Where do we stand? an overview.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  liver disease (NAFLD) is currently the most common liver disease worldwide, the prevalence of which had progressively increased over the past 10 years where other liver diseases remained at the same prevalence rates or are expected to decrease as in the case of hepatitis C virus (HCV). The treatment of NAFLD is of prime concern to health care professionals and patients due to the significant mortality and morbidity it implies; the problem is further escalated by the fact that standard of care medications targeting NAFLD remain experimental and without evidence base. Treatment nowadays is focused on lifestyle modification and managing the comorbid associated diseases, with a possible role for some hepatic protective agents. This review presents all the medications that had been proposed and used for the treatment of NAFLD with or without scientific rationale and includes agents for weight loss, insulin sensitizers, drugs that reduce blood lipids, glucagon-mimetics, drugs that may reduce fibrosis, angiotensin receptor blockers, and medicines believed to reduce endoplasmic reticular stress such as vitamin E, ursodeoxycholic , and S-adenosyl methionine.

This study investigated whether guar gum and pectin-two fibers with distinct functional characteristics-affect BA profiles,  composition, and gut metabolites in rats. Low- (LM) or high-methoxylated (HM) pectin, and low-, medium-, or high-molecular-weight (MW) guar gum were administered to rats that were fed either low- or high-fat diets. Cecal BAs, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and  composition, and plasma lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) levels were analyzed, by using novel methodologies based on gas chromatography (BAs and SCFAs) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Strong correlations were observed between cecal BA and SCFA levels,  composition, and portal plasma LBP levels in rats on a high-fat diet. Notably, guar gum consumption with medium-MW increased the cecal amounts of cholic-, chenodeoxycholic-, and ursodeoxycholic acids as well as α-, β-, and ω-muricholic acids to a greater extent than other types of guar gum or the fiber-free control diet. In contrast, the amounts of cecal - and hyodeoxycholic  were reduced with all types of guar gum independent of chain length. Differences in BA composition between pectin groups were less obvious, but cecal levels of α- and ω-muricholic acids were higher in rats fed LM as compared to HM pectin or the control diet. The inflammatory marker LBP was downregulated in rats fed medium-MW guar gum and HM pectin; these two fibers decreased the cecal abundance of Oscillospira and an unclassified genus in Ruminococcaceae, and increased that of an unclassified family in RF32. These results indicate that the molecular properties of guar gum and pectin are important for their ability to modulate cecal BA formation, gut  composition, and high-fat diet induced inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31058578>Characterization of Radioprotective, Radiomitigative and Bystander Signaling Modulating Effects of Endogenous Metabolites - Phenylacetate, Ursodeoxycholate and Tauroursodeoxycholate - on HCT116 Human Colon Carcinoma Cell Line.</a></h2><p>Exposures to ionizing radiation can cause depletion in stem cell reservoirs and lead to chronic injury processes that exacerbate carcinogenic and inflammatory responses. Therefore, radioprotective measures, against both acute and chronic biological effects of radiation, require frequent intake of nontoxic natural products, which have practical oral administration. The goal of this study was to characterize the radioprotective, radiomitigative and radiation-induced bystander effect-inhibiting properties of endogenous metabolites: phenylacetate, ursodeoxycholate and tauroursodeoxycholate. Compounds were administered pre- and postirradiation as well as in donor and recipient bystander flasks to analyze whether these might adequately protect against radiation injury as well as facilitate recovery from the exposures. The clonogenic HCT116 p53 wild-type cancer cell line in this study shares characteristics of stem cells, such as high reproductive viability, which is an effective marker to demonstrate compound effectiveness. Clonogenic assays were therefore used to characterize radioprotective, radiomitigative and bystander inhibiting properties of treatment compounds whereby cellular responses to radiation were quantified with macroscopic colony counts to measure cell survival in flasks. The results were statistically significant for phenylacetate and tauroursodeoxycholate when administered preirradiation, conferring radioprotection up to 2 Gy, whereas administration postirradiation and in bystander experiments did not confer radioprotection . These findings suggest that phenylacetate and tauroursodeoxycholate might be effective radioprotectors, although they possess no radiomitigative properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26008194>Oral insulin delivery using  conjugated PEGylated polyhydroxybutyrate co-polymeric nanoparticles.</a></h2><p>To develop insulin loaded  conjugated PEGylated polyhydroxybutyrate co-polymeric nanoparticles and carry out in vitro and in vivo testing of enteric coated granules comprising these nanoparticles.Insulin loaded nanoparticles were prepared and characterized in vitro.

After acclimation, the rats were fed with a control diet or a diet supplemented with DFAIII. After 2 weeks, each group was further divided into two groups and was fed diet with or without CA supplementation at 0.5 g/kg diet. BA levels were analyzed in aortic and portal plasma, liver, intestinal content, and feces. As a result, DFAIII ingestion reduced the fecal  level via the partial suppression of deconjugation and 7α-dehydroxylation of BAs following CA supplementation.

Forty-eight Genesus [(Duroc boar × Yorkshire-Landrace sows] barrows (25.0 ± 0.32 kg initial BW) were housed in pairs. Pigs were assigned to 1 of the 3 corn-soybean meal-based diets-a basal corn-soybean meal-containing diet (control), a flaxseed meal-containing diet (FM), or an oat hulls-containing diet (OH)-in a completely randomized design. All diets were formulated to be isoenergetic and to contain similar standardized ileal digestible AA contents and meet other nutrient requirements for growing pigs. The experiment lasted for 28 d. Average daily feed intake; ADG; G:F; ATTD of fat, serum lipids, and digesta; and fecal VFA, BA, and NS concentrations were determined. Pigs fed the control or OH had greater final BW ( < 0.001), ADFI ( = 0.005), and ADG ( < 0.001) than FM-fed pigs. The ATTD of fat in the FM was lowest at 70.1% followed by 79.2% in OH and was greatest at 92.4% in the control ( = 0.020). Total serum cholesterol content was 2.25 and 1.99 mmol/L and lower ( < 0.001) in pigs fed FM and OH, respectively, than the 2.36 mmol/L in pigs fed the control. Pigs fed the FM and OH had greater ileal and cecal total VFA ( < 0.001), ileal  ( < 0.01), and cecal ( < 0.001) and fecal cholesterol ( = 0.002) concentrations than those fed the control. Pigs fed the FM excreted more fecal lithocholic  ( = 0.002) and ursodeoxycholic  ( = 0.001) compared with those that consumed the control and OH. The concentrations of coprostanol in cecal digesta ( < 0.001) and feces ( = 0.011) were higher in pigs fed the FM and OH than in pigs fed the control. In conclusion, feeding flaxseed meal and oat hulls induced intestinal fermentation; however, the former depressed growth performance whereas the latter did not have any effect. Addition of flaxseed meal and oat hulls in growing pig diets reduced fat digestibility and serum cholesterol and stimulated malabsorption of primary BA and excretion of secondary BA and NS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28818518>Seladelpar (MBX-8025), a selective PPAR-δ agonist, in patients with primary biliary cholangitis with an inadequate response to ursodeoxycholic : a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2, proof-of-concept study.</a></h2><p>Many patients with primary biliary cholangitis have an inadequate response to first-line therapy with ursodeoxycholic . Seladelpar is a potent, selective agonist for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-delta (PPAR-δ), which is implicated in bile  homoeostasis. This first-in-class study evaluated the anti-cholestatic effects and safety of seladelpar in patients with an inadequate response to ursodeoxycholic .The study was a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial of patients with alkaline phosphatase of at least 1·67 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) despite treatment with ursodeoxycholic . Patients, recruited at 29 sites in North America and Europe, were randomly assigned to placebo, seladelpar 50 mg/day, or seladelpar 200 mg/day while ursodeoxycholic  was continued. Randomisation was done centrally (1:1:1) by a computerised system using an interactive voice-web response system with a block size of three. Randomisation was stratified by region (North America and Europe). The primary outcome was the percentage change from baseline in alkaline phosphatase over 12 weeks, analysed in the modified intention-to-treat (ITT) population (any randomised patient who received at least one dose of medication and had at least one post-baseline alkaline phosphatase evaluation). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov () and the EU Clinical Trials Registry (EudraCT2015-002698-39).Between Nov 4, 2015, and May 26, 2016, 70 patients were screened at 29 sites in North America and Europe. During recruitment, three patients treated with seladelpar developed fully reversible, asymptomatic grade 3 alanine aminotransferase increases (one on 50 mg, two on 200 mg), ranging from just over five to 20 times the ULN; as a result, the study was terminated after 41 patients were randomly assigned. The modified ITT population consisted of 12 patients in the placebo group, 13 in the seladelpar 50 mg group, and 10 in the seladelpar 200 mg group. Mean changes from baseline in alkaline phosphatase were -2% (SD 16) in the placebo group, -53% (14) in the seladelpar 50 mg group, and -63% (8) in the seladelpar 200 mg group. Changes in both seladelpar groups versus placebo were significant (p<0·0001 for both groups vs placebo), with no significant difference between the two seladelpar groups (p=0·1729). All five patients who received seladelpar for 12 weeks had normal alkaline phosphatase values at the end of treatment, based on a central laboratory ULN for alkaline phosphatase of 116 U/L. The most frequently reported adverse events were pruritus (16%; one patient on placebo, four on seladelpar 50 mg, and one on seladelpar 200 mg), nausea (13%; one patient on placebo, three on seladelpar 50 mg, and one on seladelpar 200 mg), diarrhoea (10%; two patients on placebo, one on seladelpar 50 mg, and one on seladelpar 200 mg), dyspepsia (8%; two patients on seladelpar 50 mg and one on seladelpar 200 mg), muscle spasms (8%; three patients on seladelpar 200 mg), myalgia (8%; one patient on placebo and two on seladelpar 200 mg), and dizziness (8%; one patient on placebo and two on seladelpar 50 mg).Seladelpar normalised alkaline phosphatase levels in patients who completed 12 weeks of treatment. However, treatment was associated with grade 3 increases in aminotransferases and the study was stopped early. The effects of seladelpar should be explored at lower doses.CymaBay Therapeutics.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Primary BAs play critical roles in cholesterol metabolism, lipid digestion, and host⁻microbe interaction. Although BAs are reabsorbed via enterohepatic circulation, primary BAs serve as substrates for bacterial biotransformation to secondary BAs in the colon. High-fat diets increase secondary BAs, such as  (DCA) and lithocholic  (LCA), which are risk factors for colonic inflammation and cancer. In contrast, increased dietary fiber intake is associated with anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. These effects may be due to the increased production of the SCFAs acetate, propionate, and butyrate during dietary fiber fermentation in the colon. Elucidation of the molecular events by which secondary BAs and SCFAs regulate colonic cell proliferation and inflammation will lead to a better understanding of the anticancer potential of dietary fiber in the context of high-fat diet-related colon cancer. This article reviews the current knowledge concerning the effects of secondary BAs and SCFAs on the proliferation of colon epithelial cells, inflammation, cancer, and the associated microbiome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30269035>Cranberries attenuate animal-based diet-induced changes in microbiota composition and functionality: a randomized crossover controlled feeding trial.</a></h2><p>Cranberries have multiple health effects but their impact on gut microbiota has not been examined in randomized controlled feeding trials. We evaluated the relationship between the microbiota and cranberries in the context of an animal-based diet. In a randomized, double-blind, cross-over, controlled design trial, 11 healthy adults consumed for 5 days each a control diet (animal-based diet plus 30 g/day placebo powder) and a cranberry diet (animal-based diet plus 30 g/day freeze-dried whole cranberry powder). The animal-based diet included meats, dairy products, and simple sugars. Stool, urine, and blood samples were obtained before and after each intervention phase. As compared to the pre-control diet, control diet modified 46 taxonomic clades, including an increase in the abundance of Firmicutes and decrease in Bacteroidetes. Moreover, it increased bacteria-derived  and decreased acetate and butyrate in stool. As compared to the post-intervention phase of control diet, the cranberry diet modified 9 taxonomic clades, including a decrease in the abundance of Firmicutes and increase in Bacteroidetes. Further, the cranberry diet attenuated control diet-induced increase in secondary bile  and decrease in short-chain   (), and increased urinary anthocyanins and bacterially derived phenolic . No changes were found in fecal trimethylamine and plasma cytokines. In conclusion, an animal-based diet altered the microbiota composition to a less favorable profile, increased carcinogenic bile , and decreased beneficial . Cranberries attenuated the impact of the animal-based diet on microbiota composition, bile , and , evidencing their capacity to modulate the gut microbiota.Copyright © 2018.

Ursodeoxycholic  and obeticholic  are approved for its treatment. Not all patients respond, some are intolerant, many have ongoing symptoms, and new therapies are required. Herein we describe drugs in development and potential future biological targets. We consider compounds acting on the farnesoid X receptor/fibroblast growth factor 19 pathway, fibrates and other agonists of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor family, transmembrane-G-protein-receptor-5 agonists, and several immunological agents. We also consider the roles of bile  reuptake inhibitors, nalfurafine, and fibrates in pruritus management.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The objective of this study was to establish the relationship between butyrate and dysregulated BA synthesis-induced hepatitis as well as the effect of butyrate in reversing the liver pathology. Wild-type (WT) and FXR knockout (KO) male mice were placed on a control (CD) or western diet (WD) for 15 months. In the presence or absence of butyrate supplementation, feces obtained from 15-month-old WD-fed FXR KO mice, which had severe hepatitis and liver tumors, were transplanted to 7-month-old WD-fed FXR KO for 3 months. Hepatic phenotypes,  profile, and BA composition were analyzed. Butyrate-generating bacteria and colonic butyrate concentration were reduced due to FXR inactivation and further reduced by WD intake. In addition, WD-fed FXR KO male mice had the highest concentration of hepatic β-muricholic  (β-MCA) and bacteria-generated  (DCA) accompanied by serious hepatitis. Moreover, dysregulated BA and reduced SCFA signaling co-existed in both human liver cancers and WD-fed FXR KO mice.  transplantation using butyrate-deficient feces derived from 15-month-old WD-fed FXR KO mice increased hepatic lymphocyte numbers as well as hepatic β-MCA and DCA concentrations. Furthermore, butyrate supplementation reduced hepatic β-MCA as well as DCA and eliminated hepatic lymphocyte infiltration. In conclusion, reduced butyrate contributes to the development of hepatitis in the FXR KO mouse model. In addition, butyrate reverses dysregulated BA synthesis and its associated hepatitis.

Therefore, the formation of fermentation end-products which might exert chemopreventive effects regarding colon cancer was investigated after an in vitro simulated digestion and fermentation of nuts using human fecal .Fermentation supernatants (FS) and pellets (FP) were obtained after an in vitro fermentation of hazelnuts, almonds, macadamia, pistachios and walnuts. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and bile acids (BA) in FS as well as fatty acids in FP were analyzed via gas chromatography. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in FS were determined photometrically.Fermentation of nuts resulted in 1.9- to 2.8-fold higher concentrations of SCFA compared to the control and a shift of molar ratios toward butyrate production. In vitro fermentation resulted in the formation of vaccenic  (C18:1t11, 32.1 ± 3.2 % FAME; fatty  methyl ester) and conjugated linoleic  (c9,t11 CLA, 2.4 ± 0.7 % FAME) exclusively in fermented walnut samples. Concentrations of secondary BA -/iso- (6.8-24.1-fold/4.9-10.9-fold, respectively) and levels of MDA (1.3-fold) were significantly reduced in fermented nut samples compared to the control.This is the first study that demonstrates the ability of the human fecal  to convert polyunsaturated fatty acids from walnuts to c9,t11 CLA as a potential chemopreventive metabolite. In addition, the production of butyrate and reduction in potential carcinogens such as secondary BA and lipid peroxidation products might contribute to the protective effects of nuts regarding colon cancer development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30511198>Disease Progression and Pharmacological Intervention in a Nutrient-Deficient Rat Model of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>There is a marked need for improved animal models of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to facilitate the development of more efficacious drug therapies for the disease.Here, we investigated the development of fibrotic NASH in male Wistar rats fed a choline-deficient L-amino -defined (CDAA) diet with or without cholesterol supplementation for subsequent assessment of drug treatment efficacy in NASH biopsy-confirmed rats. The metabolic profile and liver histopathology were evaluated after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of dieting. Subsequently, rats with biopsy-confirmed NASH were selected for pharmacological intervention with vehicle, elafibranor (30 mg/kg/day) or obeticholic  (OCA, 30 mg/kg/day) for 5 weeks.The CDAA diet led to marked hepatomegaly and fibrosis already after 4 weeks of feeding, with further progression of collagen deposition and fibrogenesis-associated gene expression during the 12-week feeding period. Cholesterol supplementation enhanced the stimulatory effect of CDAA on gene transcripts associated with fibrogenesis without significantly increasing collagen deposition. Pharmacological intervention with elafibranor, but not OCA, significantly reduced steatohepatitis scores, and fibrosis-associated gene expression, however, was unable to prevent progression in fibrosis scores.CDAA-fed rats develop early-onset progressive NASH, which offers the opportunity to probe anti-NASH compounds with potential disease-modifying properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26924312>Effect of Wheat Dietary Fiber Particle Size during Digestion In Vitro on Bile , Faecal Bacteria and Short-Chain   Content.</a></h2><p>The influence of bile  concentration on the growth of Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. bacteria was demonstrated. Exposing these bacteria to the environment containing bile  salts, and very poor in nutrients, leads to the disappearance of these microorganisms due to the toxic effect of bile . A multidimensional analysis of data in the form of principal component analysis indicated that lactic  bacteria bind bile  and show antagonistic effect on E. coli spp. bacteria. The growth in E. coli spp. population was accompanied by a decline in the population of Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. with a simultaneous reduction in the concentration of bile . This is direct proof of  binding ability of the tested lactic  bacteria with respect to cholic , lithocholic  and . This research demonstrated that the degree of fineness of wheat dietary fibre does not affect the sorption of bile  and growth of some bacteria species; however, it has an impact on the profile of synthesized short-chained  . During the digestion of a very fine wheat fibre fraction (WF 90), an increase in the concentration of propionic and butyric , as compared with the wheat fiber fraction of larger particles - WF 500, was observed. Our study suggested that wheat fibre did not affect faecal bacteria growth, however, we observed binding of bile  by Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25788198>New cellular and molecular targets for the treatment of portal hypertension.</a></h2><p>Portal hypertension (PH) is a common complication of chronic liver disease, and it determines most complications leading to death or liver transplantation in patients with liver cirrhosis. PH results from increased resistance to portal blood flow through the cirrhotic liver. This is caused by two mechanisms: (a) distortion of the liver vascular architecture and (b) hepatic microvascular dysfunction. Increment in hepatic resistance is latterly accompanied by splanchnic vasodilation, which further aggravates PH. Hepatic microvascular dysfunction occurs early in the course of chronic liver disease as a consequence of inflammation and oxidative stress and determines loss of the normal phenotype of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC). The cross-talk between LSEC and hepatic stellate cells induces activation of the latter, which in turn proliferate, migrate and increase collagen deposition around the sinusoids, contributing to fibrogenesis, architectural disruption and angiogenesis. Therapy for PH aims at correcting these pathophysiological abnormalities: liver injury, fibrogenesis, increased hepatic vascular tone and splanchnic vasodilatation. Continuing liver injury may be counteracted specifically by etiological treatments, while architectural disruption and fibrosis can be ameliorated by a variety of anti-fibrogenic drugs and anti-angiogenic strategies. Sinusoidal endothelial dysfunction is ameliorated by statins and other drugs increasing NO availability. Splanchnic hyperemia can be counteracted by non-selective beta-blockers (NSBBs), vasopressin analogs and somatostatin analogs. Future treatment of portal hypertension will evolve to use etiological treatments together with anti-fibrotic agents and/or drugs improving microvascular function in initial stages of cirrhosis (pre-primary prophylaxis), while NSBBs will be added in advanced stages of the disease.</p></html>
