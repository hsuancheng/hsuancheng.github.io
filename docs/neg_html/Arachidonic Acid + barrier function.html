Different CYP isoenzymes mediate metabolism of many endogenous substrates such as monoaminergic neurotransmitters, neurosteroids, cholesterol, vitamins and . Therefore, these enzymes may affect brain development, susceptibility to mental and neurodegenerative diseases and may contribute to their pathophysiology. In addition, they can modify the therapeutic effects of psychoactive drugs at the place of their target action in the brain, where the drugs can act by affecting the metabolism of endogenous substrates. The article focuses on the role of cerebral CYP isoforms in the metabolism of neurotransmitters, neurosteroids, and cholesterol, and their possible involvement in animal behavior, as well as in stress, depression, schizophrenia, cognitive processes, learning, and memory. CYP-mediated alternative pathways of dopamine and serotonin synthesis may have a significant role in the local production of these neurotransmitters in the brain regions where the disturbances of these neurotransmitter systems are observed in depression and schizophrenia. The local alternative synthesis of neurotransmitters may be of great importance in the brain, since dopamine and serotonin do not pass the blood-brain  and cannot be supplied from the periphery. In vitro studies indicate that human CYP2D6 catalyzing dopamine and serotonin synthesis is more efficient in these reactions than the rat CYP2D isoforms. It suggests that these alternative pathways may have much greater significance in the human brain but confirmation of these assumptions requires further studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20620762>Healing fats of the skin: the structural and immunologic roles of the omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids.</a></h2><p>Linoleic  (18:2omega6) and alpha-linolenic  (18:3omega3) represent the parent fats of the two main classes of polyunsaturated fatty acids: the omega-6 (n-6) and the omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids, respectively. Linoleic  and alpha-linolenic  both give rise to other long-chain fatty  derivatives, including gamma-linolenic  and  (omega-6 fatty acids) and docosahexaenoic  and eicosapentaenoic  (omega-3 fatty acids). These fatty acids are showing promise as safe adjunctive treatments for many skin disorders, including atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, acne vulgaris, systemic lupus erythematosus, nonmelanoma skin cancer, and melanoma. Their roles are diverse and include maintenance of the stratum corneum permeability , maturation and differentiation of the stratum corneum, formation and secretion of lamellar bodies, inhibition of proinflammatory eicosanoids, elevation of the sunburn threshold, inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, and interleukin-12), inhibition of lipoxygenase, promotion of wound healing, and promotion of apoptosis in malignant cells, including melanoma. They fulfill these functions independently and through the modulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and Toll-like receptors.Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Northern and Western blots indicated that the pancreatic-type, sPLA2-IB represents the predominant form of sPLA2 enzymes present in the gastric mucosa. Both sPLA2-IB mRNA and protein in the gastric mucosa exceeded levels found in the pancreas, and in contrast to the pancreatic enzyme it was present primarily in the active state. The sPLA2-IB gene is not expressed in the murine small intestine and colon. Infection by the gastritis-inducing bacteria, Helicobacterfelis (H. felis) dramatically and time dependently decreased the PLA2 activity in the glandular stomach of the mouse strain, C57BL/6, sensitive to the organism, which appeared to be related to a decrease in the percentage of sPLA2-IB present in the active form. This bacterial-induced reduction in PLA2 activity was not observed in BALB/c mice that fail to develop gastritis in response to H. felis infection. C57BL/6 mice do not, while BALB/c mice express, the PLA2-II enzyme. The H. felis-induced reduction in sPLA2-IB activity may weaken the gastric  by reducing the local concentration of  and linoleic , liberated from membrane phospholipids, the major precursors of 'cytoprotective' prostaglandins. Data presented here suggest that both sPLA2-IB and sPLA2-II enzymes may contribute to the gastric response to Helicobacter infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17420968>[The metabolic regulation of cerebral microcirculation].</a></h2><p>To analyse the mechanisms involved in the microvascular metabolic regulation of cerebral blood flow. The article outlines the neuronal metabolism and mechanisms involved in functional hyperaemia and examines the contractile properties of brain microvasculature. It also discusses the role played by ion channels in pericytes and vascular smooth muscle and describes the signalling pathways involved in arteriolar and capillary vasodilatation or vasoconstriction.The blood-brain  and the close functional relations between neurons and astrocytes give rise to nerve tissue properties such as functional hyperaemia. In this mechanism the astrocytes act as a structural and functional 'bridge' between neurons and brain capillaries, and respond to synaptic activity by releasing vasoactive compounds, above all vasodilators. The metabolites derived from , such as prostaglandins and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, as well as the compounds that have traditionally been involved, such as nitric oxide and prostacyclin, are especially important. These substances are capable of extending to the capillaries and arterioles, where they alter the membrane potential and the contractibility of the pericytes and the smooth muscle of vessels.The functional interaction among neurons, astrocytes and capillaries in the central nervous system (called the 'neurovascular unit') is essential for the regulation of cerebral blood flow, since it links neuron-glial cell metabolic activity to the supply of energetic substrates from the microcirculation. Within this functional unit, astrocytes play a vital role by releasing vasoactive substances that are derived from or produced by neuronal activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12725904>Polyunsaturated fatty acids in the blood of spontaneously or induced muricidal male Wistar rats.</a></h2><p>Serum levels of several n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids were compared in male Wistar muricidal (Mu) and non-Mu rats. The Mu behavior was either spontaneous or induced by long-term isolation, feeding with a starch-enriched polyunsaturated fatty  diet (PUFA+S), water restriction, or adrenalectomy (ADX).  (ARA) levels were lower in diet-induced (PUFA+S) Mu rats than in their non-Mu controls. Total n-6 fatty  levels were also lower in spontaneously Mu rats than in spontaneously non-Mu rats. Docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and total n-3 fatty acids levels were lower in rats with isolation-induced Mu behavior. The n-3/n-6 ratio was higher in spontaneously Mu rats than in spontaneously non-Mu rats. The changes in ARA levels were greater than those in DHA levels, possibly due to the higher blood-brain  passage of .

However surprisingly limited research has been conducted comparing the fatty  composition of central and peripheral lipid stores.The present study compared the distribution of polyunsaturated (PUFA), as well as specific saturated (SFA) and monounsaturated (MUFA) fatty acids in the whole blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of humans. Gas chromatography with flame ionization detection was used to determine the fatty  profiles of twenty-eight matched CSF and whole blood samples. Multiple linear regression modeling, controlling for age, was used to identify significant relationships.A significant positive relationship was seen between whole blood total omega-3 fatty acids and the CSF omega-3 subfractions, docosapentaenoic  (DPA) (P = 0.019) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) (P = 0.015). A direct association was also observed between the whole blood and CSF omega-6 PUFA,  (AA) (P = 0.045). Interestingly an inverse association between central and peripheral oleic  was also found (P = 0.045).These findings indicate a relationship between central and peripheral fatty acids of varying degrees of unsaturation and chain length and support the view that some systemic fatty acids are likely to cross the human blood brain  (BBB) and thereby influence central fatty  concentrations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15988590>TRPV4 and the mammalian kidney.</a></h2><p>Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) was identified as the mammalian homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans osmosensory channel protein, OSM-9. In mammals, TRPV4 is activated by a variety of stimuli including thermal stress, fatty  metabolites, and hypotonicity. Two distinct mechanisms have been described through which TRPV4 may be activated by hypotonicity: one involves the Src family of nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases, whereas a second is mediated via  metabolites. TRPV4 likely plays a role in systemic osmoregulation; accordingly, it is expressed in the blood-brain -deficient osmosensory nuclei of the hypothalamus. TRPV4 is also abundantly expressed in the kidney, and its precisely demarcated distribution along the kidney tubule permits speculation about a physiological role in this tissue. TRPV4-expressing and TRPV4-negative tubule segments co-exist at all levels of the kidney, from the cortex through the inner medulla. It is conceivable that basolaterally expressed TRPV4 transmits signals arising in the interstitium (e.g, changing tonicity) to more-distal tubule segments where "fine-tuning" of the incipient urine takes place.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14585927>Identification and characterization of a cyclooxygenase-like enzyme from Entamoeba histolytica.</a></h2><p>The intestinal protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, almost nothing is known about the molecules secreted by the parasite that modulate host immune responses or epithelial   in the colon. Herein, we describe the isolation and characterization of a cyclooxygenase (COX)-like enzyme in E. histolytica that is responsible for the biosynthesis of prostaglandin (PG)E2. PGE2 produced by ameba was constitutive but highly dependent on exogenous  substrate. COX-like activity and the immunoreactive protein were localized to the nuclear fraction of E. histolytica. The COX-like protein (72 kDa) was microsequenced and cloned by reverse transcriptase PCR. Ameba COX showed little homology with COX-1/2 enzymes from different species at the nucleotide and amino  levels. Surprisingly, the arachidonate-binding domain and heme-coordinating and catalytic sites, which are conserved in other species, were absent in ameba. Ameba COX expressed in Escherichia coli demonstrated COX-like enzyme activity in vitro by converting  into PGE2 but not into PGD2 or PGF2alpha. COX activity was inhibited with 1 mM aspirin but not with indomethacin or COX-1/2-specific inhibitors. Taken together, these studies reveal that E. histolytica produces PGE2, by means of a previously undescribed ancestral COX-like enzyme, which could play a major role in pathogenesis and immune evasion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25366242>Thermally activated TRPV3 channels.</a></h2><p>TRPV3 is a temperature-sensitive transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel. The TRPV3 protein functions as a Ca(2+)-permeable nonselective cation channel with six transmembrane domains forming a tetrameric complex. TRPV3 is known to be activated by warm temperatures, synthetic small-molecule chemicals, and natural compounds from plants. Its  is regulated by a variety of physiological factors including extracellular divalent cations and acidic pH, intracellular adenosine triphosphate, membrane voltage, and . TRPV3 shows a broad expression pattern in both neuronal and non-neuronal tissues including epidermal keratinocytes, epithelial cells in the gut, endothelial cells in blood vessels, and neurons in dorsal root ganglia and CNS. TRPV3 null mice exhibit abnormal hair morphogenesis and compromised skin  . Recent advances suggest that TRPV3 may play critical roles in inflammatory skin disorders, itch, and pain sensation. Thus, identification of selective TRPV3 activators and inhibitors could potentially lead to beneficial pharmacological interventions in several diseases. The intent of this review is to summarize our current knowledge of the tissue expression, structure, , and mechanisms of activation of TRPV3.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30768560>Regulation of Endothelial Cell Permeability by Platelet-Derived Extracellular Vesicles.</a></h2><p>Platelet (Plt) derived-extracellular vesicles (Plt-EVs) have hemostatic properties similar to Plts. In addition to hemostasis, Plts also  to stabilize the vasculature and maintain endothelial cell (EC)  integrity. We hypothesized that Plt-EVs would inhibit vascular endothelial cell permeability, similar to fresh Plts. To investigate this hypothesis we utilized in vitro and in vivo models of vascular endothelial compromise and bleeding.In vitro: Plt-EVs were isolated by ultracentrifugation and characterized for Plt markers and particle size distribution. Effects of Plts and Plt-EVs on endothelial   was assessed by trans - endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements and histological analysis of endothelial junction proteins. Hemostatic potential of Plt-EVs and Plts were assessed by multiple electrode Plt aggregometry. In vivo: The effects of Plts and Plt-EVs on vascular permeability and bleeding were assessed in NOD-SCID mice by an established Miles Assay of vascular permeability and a tail snip bleeding assay.In vitro: Plt-EVs displayed exosomal size distribution and expressed Plt specific surface markers. Plts and Plt-EVs decreased EC permeability and restored EC junctions after thrombin challenge. Multiplate aggregometry revealed that Plt-EVs enhanced Thrombin Receptor Activating Peptide (TRAP) mediated aggregation of whole blood, whereas Plts enhanced TRAP,  (ASPI), Collagen, and Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) mediated aggregation. In vivo: Plt-EVs are equivalent to Plts in attenuating VEGF-A induced vascular permeability and uncontrolled blood loss in a tail snip hemorrhage model.Our study is the first to report that Plt-EVs might provide a feasible product for transfusion in trauma patients to attenuate bleeding, inhibit vascular permeability and mitigate the endotheliopathy of trauma (EOT).Original Article LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: This is a pre-clinical study so it does not confirm to the level of evidence table for all clinical studies and case reports.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20533360>Endocannabinoid system in the adult rat circumventricular areas: an immunohistochemical study.</a></h2><p>Endocannabinoids (ECs) are important neuromodulators involved in a plethora of physiological processes such as modulation of synaptic transmission, neuroprotection, immune , and neurodevelopment, among others. However, still lacking is a detailed study on the presence of this system in the circumventricular areas, brain structures controlling the interaction between cerebrospinal fluid and brain parenchyma. The aim of this work was to provide the anatomical basis supporting a functional role of ECs in the activity of circumventricular areas. To this end, an immunohistochemical study of the EC system in rat brain was performed. Receptors and synthesizing and degrading enzymes for ECs were widely distributed in rat ependyma and subependyma, marginal glia, and circumventricular organs (CVOs) such as the choroid plexus, subfornical organ, subcommissural organ, median eminence, and area postrema. These zones constitute  systems between the brain parenchyma and the ventricular or subarachnoid cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and between the extracellular hemal milieu of CVOs and the brain parenchyma or the CSF. By immunohistochemistry and real-time polymerase chain reaction we found DAGLalpha, DAGLbeta, NAPE-PLD, MAGL, and FAAH in the ependyma. These finding suggest that the ependyma can release and clear ECs from the ventricular CSF. Subependymal astrocytes and tanycytes displayed DAGLalpha immunoreactivity but parenchymal astrocytes did not express EC-synthesizing enzymes, thus establishing a sharp distinction between these two astrocyte populations. CB1 was located in fibers innervating discrete subventricular zones such as the neurogenic striatal subventricular zone and the fourth ventricle. CB1 fibers also innervated some CVOs.(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25797298>Quantitative determination of 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids by chiral liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in a murine atopic dermatitis model.</a></h2><p>Atopic dermatitis, one of the most important skin diseases, is characterized by both skin  impairment and immunological abnormalities. Although several studies have demonstrated the significant relationship between atopic dermatitis and immunological abnormalities, the role of hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETE) in atopic dermatitis remains unknown. To develop chiral methods for characterization of 12-HETE enantiomers in a 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB)-induced atopic dermatitis mouse model and evaluate the effects of 12-HETE on atopic dermatitis, BALB/c mice were treated with either DNCB or acetone/olive oil (AOO) to induce atopic dermatitis, after which 12(R)- and 12(S)-HETEs in the plasma, skin, spleen, and lymph nodes were quantified by chiral liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. 12(R)- and 12(S)-HETEs in biological samples of DNCB-induced atopic dermatitis mice increased significantly compared with the AOO group, reflecting the involvement of 12(R)- and 12(S)-HETEs in atopic dermatitis. These findings indicate that 12(R)- and 12(S)-HETEs could be a useful guide for understanding the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18042368>n-3 Fatty acids modulate brain glucose transport in endothelial cells of the blood-brain .</a></h2><p>We have previously shown that glucose utilization and glucose transport were impaired in the brain of rats made deficient in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). The present study examines whether n-3 PUFA affect the expression of glucose transporter GLUT1 and glucose transport activity in the endothelial cells of the blood-brain . GLUT1 expression in the cerebral cortex microvessels of rats fed different amounts of n-3 PUFA (low vs. adequate vs. high) was studied. In parallel, the glucose uptake was measured in primary cultures of rat brain endothelial cells (RBEC) exposed to supplemental long chain n-3 PUFA, docosahexaenoic (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic (EPA) acids, or to  (AA). Western immunoblotting analysis showed that endothelial GLUT1 significantly decreased (-23%) in the n-3 PUFA-deficient microvessels compared to control ones, whereas it increased (+35%) in the microvessels of rats fed the high n-3 PUFA diet. In addition, binding of cytochalasin B indicated that the maximum binding to GLUT1 (Bmax) was reduced in deficient rats. Incubation of RBEC with 15 microM DHA induced the membrane DHA to increase at a level approaching that of cerebral microvessels isolated from rats fed the high n-3 diet. Supplementation of RBEC with DHA or EPA increased the [(3)H]-3-O-methylglucose uptake (reflecting the basal glucose transport) by 35% and 50%, respectively, while AA had no effect. In conclusion, we suggest that n-3 PUFA can modulate the brain glucose transport in endothelial cells of the blood-brain , possibly via changes in GLUT1 protein expression and activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17608720>The hepoxilin connection in the epidermis.</a></h2><p>The recent convergence of genetic and biochemical evidence on the activities of lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes has implicated the production of hepoxilin derivatives (fatty  epoxyalcohols) in the pathways leading to formation of the water-impermeable  of the outer epidermis.

Despite several clinical studies reported intestinal dysfunction during HIV infection, the mechanisms underlying HIV-induced impairments of mucosal epithelial  are still unclear. It has been postulated that HIV-1 alters enterocytic  and HIV-1 proteins have been detected in several cell types of the intestinal mucosa. In the present study, we analyzed the effect of the accessory HIV-1 Nef protein on human epithelial cell line.We used unstimulated or IFN-γ-stimulated Caco-2 cells, as a model for homeostatic and inflamed gastrointestinal tracts, respectively. We investigated the effect of exogenous recombinant Nef on monolayer integrity analyzing its uptake, transepithelial electrical resistance, permeability to FITC-dextran and the expression of tight junction proteins. Moreover, we measured the induction of proinflammatory mediators. Exogenous Nef was taken up by Caco-2 cells, increased intestinal epithelial permeability and upset the IFN-γ-induced reduction of transepithelial resistance, interfering with tight junction protein expression. Moreover, Nef inhibited IFN-γ-induced apoptosis and up-regulated TNF-α, IL-6 and MIP-3α production by Caco-2 cells while down-regulated IL-10 production. The simultaneous exposure of Caco-2 cells to Nef and IFN-γ did not affect cytokine secretion respect to untreated cells. Finally, we found that Nef counteracted the IFN-γ induced  cascade.Our findings suggest that exogenous Nef, perturbing the IFN-γ-induced impairment of intestinal epithelial cells, could prolong cell survival, thus allowing for accumulation of viral particles.

This study characterized the VC lipid mediator profile, and examined its relationship to gestational period, gender of the newborn and maternal lifestyle. VC collected at birth from 156 newborns within the ALADDIN birth cohort was analyzed and 3 different groups of lipid mediators (eicosanoids and related oxylipin analogs, endocannabinoids and sphingolipids) were screened using LC-MS/MS. A total of 54 compounds were detected in VC. A number of associations between lipid mediators and the gestational period were observed, including increases in the ceramide to sphingomyelin ratio as well as the endocannabinoids anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol. Gender-specific differences in lipid mediator levels were observed for all 3 lipid classes. In addition, levels of the linoleic  oxidation products 9(10)-epoxy-12Z-octadecenoic and 12(13)-epoxy-9Z-octadecenoic  (EpOMEs) as well as 12,13-dihydroxy-9Z-octadecenoic  (DiHOME) were increased in VC of children from mothers with an anthroposophic lifestyle. Accordingly, VC was found to be rich in multiple classes of bioactive lipid mediators, which evidence lifestyle, gender and gestational week dependencies.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that ammonia induces changes in blood-brain  (BBB) permeability by a mechanism coupled to oxidative/nitrosative stress (ONS) evoked in the BBB-forming cerebral capillary endothelial cells. Treatment of a rat brain endothelial cell line with ammonia (5 mmol/L, 24 h) caused accumulation of ONS markers: reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide and peroxidation products of phospholipid-bound , F2-isoprostanes. Concurrently, ammonia increased the activity of extracellular matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2/MMP-9), increased cell permeability to fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (40 kDa), and increased the expression of y+LAT2, a transporter that mediates the uptake to the cells of the nitric oxide precursor, arginine. The increase of cell permeability was ameliorated upon co-treatment with a MMP inhibitor, SB-3CT and with an antioxidant, glutathione diethyl ester, which also reduced F2-isoprostanes. Ammonia-induced ONS was attenuated by cytoprotective agents l-ornithine, phenylbutyrate, and their conjugate l-ornithine phenylbutyrate, an ammonia-trapping drug used to treat hyperammonemia. The results support the concept that ONS and ONS-related activation of MMPs in cerebral capillary endothelial cells contribute to the alterations in BBB permeability and to the vasogenic component of cerebral edema associated with acute liver failure.© 2012 The Authors.

The intestinal epithelium constitutes a permeability  regulating the vectorial transport of ions, water, and solutes. Morphological changes during cell differentiation, as well as changes in the activity of brush-border enzymes and the expression of transport proteins, are well established. However, little is known about the  (AA) cascade underlying epithelial cell differentiation or its role in the development of epithelial  . The main purpose of this study was to examine the activity of the high-molecular-weight phospholipases A(2) (PLA(2)) and cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway during differentiation, with particular emphasis on paracellular permeability. PLA(2) activity, AA release, COX-2 expression, prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) production, and paracellular permeability were studied in preconfluent, confluent, and differentiated Caco-2 cell cultures. Our results show that Caco-2 differentiation induces a decrease in both calcium-independent PLA(2) activity and COX-2 expression and, consequently, a decrease in AA release and PGE(2) synthesis in parallel with a reduction in paracellular permeability. Moreover, the addition of PGE(2) to differentiated cells, at concentrations similar to those detected in nondifferentiated cultures, induces the disruption of epithelial  . These results suggest that AA release by calcium-independent PLA(2), COX-2 expression, and subsequent PGE(2) release are important for the maintenance of paracellular permeability in differentiated Caco-2 cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27412860>Evolutionary alteration of ALOX15 specificity optimizes the biosynthesis of antiinflammatory and proresolving lipoxins.</a></h2><p>ALOX15 (12/15-lipoxygenase) orthologs have been implicated in maturational degradation of intracellular organelles and in the biosynthesis of antiinflammatory and proresolving eicosanoids. Here we hypothesized that lower mammals (mice, rats, pigs) express 12-lipoxygenating ALOX15 orthologs. In contrast, 15-lipoxygenating isoforms are found in higher primates (orangutans, men), and these results suggest an evolution of ALOX15 specificity. To test this hypothesis we first cloned and characterized ALOX15 orthologs of selected Catarrhini representing different stages of late primate evolution and found that higher primates (men, chimpanzees) express 15-lipoxygenating orthologs. In contrast, lower primates (baboons, rhesus monkeys) express 12-lipoxygenating enzymes. Gibbons, which are flanked in evolution by rhesus monkeys (12-lipoxygenating ALOX15) and orangutans (15-lipoxygenating ALOX15), express an ALOX15 ortholog with pronounced dual specificity. To explore the driving force for this evolutionary alterations, we quantified the lipoxin synthase activity of 12-lipoxygenating (rhesus monkey, mouse, rat, pig, humIle418Ala) and 15-lipoxygenating (man, chimpanzee, orangutan, rabbit, ratLeu353Phe) ALOX15 variants and found that, when normalized to their  oxygenase activities, the lipoxin synthase activities of 15-lipoxygenating ALOX15 variants were more than fivefold higher (P < 0.01) [corrected]. Comparative molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations indicated that, for the 15-lipoxygenating rabbit ALOX15, the energy  for C13-hydrogen abstraction (15-lipoxygenation) was 17 kJ/mol lower than for  12-lipoxygenation. In contrast, for the 12-lipoxygenating Ile418Ala mutant, the energy  for 15-lipoxygenation was 10 kJ/mol higher than for 12-lipoxygenation. Taken together, our data suggest an evolution of ALOX15 specificity, which is aimed at optimizing the biosynthetic capacity for antiinflammatory and proresolving lipoxins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17854901>Detrimental effects of post-treatment with fatty acids on brain injury in ischemic rats.</a></h2><p>Studies have illustrated that fatty acids, especially polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), have a role in regulating oxidative stress via the enhancement of antioxidative defense capacity or the augmentation of oxidative burden. Elevated oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of brain injury associated with cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). The objective of this study was to assess whether treatment with fatty acids after focal cerebral I/R induced by occlusion of the common carotid arteries and the middle cerebral artery has effects on brain injury in a rat model. PUFA, including  (AA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), and the saturated fatty , stearic  (SA), were administrated 60 min after reperfusion via intraperitoneal injection. AA and DHA aggravated cerebral ischemic injury, which manifested as enlargement of areas of cerebral infarction and increased impairment of motor activity, in a concentration-dependent manner. However, there were no remarkable differences in post-ischemic alterations between the SA and saline groups. The post-ischemic augmentation of injury in AA and DHA treatment groups was accompanied by increases in the permeability of the blood-brain  (BBB), brain edema, metalloproteinase (MMP) activity, inflammatory cell infiltration, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) expression, caspase 3 activity, and malondialdehyde (MDA) production, and by a decrease in the brain glutathione (GSH) content. Furthermore, we found that either AA or DHA alone had little effect on free radical generation in neuroglia, but they greatly increased the hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative burden. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the detrimental effect of PUFA such as AA and DHA in post-ischemic progression and brain injury after cerebral I/R is associated with augmentation of cerebral I/R-induced alterations, including oxidative changes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17608454>A complex mechanism for inducer mediated tau polymerization.</a></h2><p>The accumulation of polymers of the microtubule associated protein tau is correlative with increased neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease and other related tauopathies. In vitro models have been developed in order to investigate molecular mechanisms that regulate the polymerization of tau.  and heparin have been proposed to induce tau polymerization via a ligand dependent nucleation-elongation mechanism. However, certain aspects of these in vitro results are inconsistent with a classic nucleation-elongation mechanism. Using steady state and kinetic analyses of tau polymerization at a variety of protein and inducer concentrations, we have found that the thermodynamic  for nucleation in the presence of inducers is negligible, which was manifested by increases in protein polymerization at low tau concentrations and very rapid kinetics of polymerization. However, the mechanism of polymerization is complicated by the observation that high concentrations of inducer molecules result in the inhibition of tau fibril formation through different mechanisms for  and heparin. These observations indicate that the molar ratio of inducer to protein is a greater determinant of the rate and extent of tau polymerization than the concentration of tau itself.

We have previously shown that arteriolar sensitivity to vasoactive materials is influenced by a  property of the arteriolar endothelium, and here we test the hypothesis that TNF-alpha might increase intimal permeability and thereby increase the access of circulating arginine-vasopressin (AVP) to vascular smooth muscle. Our objective in the current work was to show that TNF-alpha-mediated modulation of intimal cell permeability may produce both quantitative and qualitative alterations in vascular reactivity to arginine-vasopressin.Hamster cheek pouch arterioles (approximately 65 microm, i.d.) were double-cannulated and perfused. [Arg8]-vasopressin was applied selectively to either the luminal or the adventitial surface of isolated cannulated arterioles. The reactivity of the arterioles to vasopressin was determined in the presence and absence of TNF-alpha (0.625 microg/mL; 1 hour).Adventially applied AVP induced a concentration-dependent vasoconstriction with a threshold of approximately 1 pM, and a maximal constriction at 10 nM. In contrast, luminally applied AVP induced a biphasic response, showing a modest vasodilation in the range of 1 to 100 pM, and constrictions at doses higher than 1 nM. Maximal constrictions were not obtained with luminal doses of AVP as high as 1 microM; (i.e., at doses 100-fold higher than those that produced maximal responses with adventitial application). Dilations induced by luminal application of AVP were significantly attenuated by 10 microM Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), but were not altered by 10 microM indomethacin. After treatment with TNF-alpha, the concentration-response curve for luminally applied AVP showed a more pronounced constriction and the dilator component of the agonist was eliminated. There was no change in the reactivity to adventitially applied AVP or to adventitial applications of acetylcholine. Nonspecific increases in endothelial cell permeability induced by 3-[(3-chloroamino-dopropyl)-dimethylamino]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) also eliminated the potency differences between luminal and adventitial drug application. Following TNF-alpha treatment and loss of the dilator component of the response to AVP, L-NAME was still capable of reducing the arteriolar sensitivity to ACh, thus showing that the endothelial cell machinery for NO production was intact following TNF-alpha treatment.Our findings show that the reactivity of intact resistance vessels to agonists that have both endothelial-dependent and smooth muscle cell-dependent components will be complex. Reactivity is the summation of: 1) the relative sensitivities of smooth muscle and endothelial cells to AVP, 2) the release of nitric oxide or other mediators from endothelium, and 3) the restricted access of intraluminal AVP to arteriolar smooth muscle cells. Thus, cytokines, and perhaps other materials that regulate endothelial cell permeability, can modify arteriolar reactivity by altering transendothelial cell access of luminal stimuli to the smooth muscle cells, as well as by acting directly on smooth muscle or by influencing the production of endothelial cell-derived vasoactive materials. In the case of agonists that have an endothelial cell dilator component as well as a smooth muscle constrictor component, this may result in a qualitative change in response as is shown here with AVP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30680784>Eicosanoids in tissue repair.</a></h2><p>Trauma or infection can result in tissue damage, which needs to be repaired in a well-orchestrated manner to restore tissue  and homeostasis. Lipid mediators derived from  (termed eicosanoids) play central and versatile roles in the regulation of tissue repair. Here, I summarize the current state-of the-art regarding the functional activities of eicosanoids in tissue repair responses during homeostasis and disease. I also describe how eicosanoids are produced during tissue damage and repair in a time-, cell- and tissue-dependent fashion. In particular, recent insights into the roles of eicosanoids in epithelial  repair are reviewed. Furthermore, the distinct roles of different eicosanoids in settings of pathological tissue repair such as chronic wounds, scarring or fibrosis are discussed. Finally, an outlook is provided on how eicosanoids may be targeted by future therapeutic strategies to achieve physiological tissue repair and prevent scarring and loss of tissue  in various disease contexts.© 2019 Australasian Society for Immunology Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23528213>Deficiency of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids is mainly responsible for atopic dermatitis-like pruritic skin inflammation in special diet-fed hairless mice.</a></h2><p>Hairless mice fed a special diet, HR-AD, develop atopic dermatitis (AD)-like skin inflammation with skin  defects and itch-related scratching; however, the ingredient(s) causing the dermatitis remains unclear. In this study, we examined whether deficiency of certain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) is involved in HR-AD-induced AD. High-purity PUFAs were given to HR-AD-fed mice by dietary supplementation or gavage. Fatty  levels in the serum and skin were determined by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In serum from HR-AD-fed mice, linoleic  (LA, 18:2n-6) and α-linolenic  (ALA, 18:3n-3), as well as their metabolites, were markedly decreased. When mice were fed HR-AD supplemented with LA or ALA in an amount equal to that contained in a normal diet, the development of AD-like symptoms was completely prevented by supplementation with LA but not with ALA. Relatively high dose of ALA slightly alleviated skin  defects, but did neither itch-related scratching nor skin inflammation. On the other hand, gavage administration of LA metabolites, such as γ-linolenic  and  (AA), significantly ameliorated established dermatitis without increasing LA in the serum and skin. Moreover, AA-induced amelioration of dermatitis was not affected by pharmacological blockade of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) and cyclooxygenase (COX), suggesting no involvement of 5-LOX- or COX-mediated AA metabolites in the amelioration. In conclusion, our results indicate that deficiency of n-6 PUFAs is mainly responsible for AD-like symptoms by HR-AD feeding. Thus, this model could be useful for studying the pathomechanisms associated with deficiency of n-6 PUFAs in AD.© 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19919823>LC-MS/MS analysis of epoxyalcohols and epoxides of  and their oxygenation by recombinant CYP4F8 and CYP4F22.</a></h2><p>CYP4F22 and CYP4F8 are expressed in epidermis, and mutations of CYP4F22 are associated with lamellar ichthyosis. Epoxyalcohols (HEETs) and epoxides (EETs) of 20:4n-6 appear to be important for the water permeability  of skin. Our aim was to study the MS/MS spectra and fragmentation of these compounds and to determine whether they were oxidized by CYP4F22 or CYP4F8 expressed in yeast. HEETs were prepared from 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic  (15-HPETE), 12-HPETE, and their [(2)H(8)]labeled isotopomers, and separated by normal phase-HPLC with MS/MS analysis. CYP4F22 oxygenated 20:4n-6 at C-18, whereas metabolites of HEETs could not be identified. CYP4F8 formed omega3 hydroxy metabolites of HEETs derived from 12R-HPETE with 11,12-epoxy-10-hydroxy configuration, but not HEETs derived from 15S-HPETE. 8,9-EET and 11,12-EET were also subject to omega3 hydroxylation by CYP4F8. We conclude that CYP4F8 and CYP4F22 oxidize 20:4n-6 and that CYP4F8 selectively oxidizes 8,9-EET, 11,12-EET, and 10,11R,12R-HEET at the omega3 position.Copyright (c) 2010.

AEA is hydrolyzed by fatty  amide hydrolase (FAAH), an enzyme localized on the endoplasmic reticulum. In contrast to most neuromodulators, the hydrophilic cytosol poses a diffusional  for the efficient delivery of AEA to its site of catabolism. Therefore, AEA likely traverses the cytosol with the assistance of an intracellular carrier that increases its solubility and rate of diffusion. To study this process, AEA uptake and hydrolysis were examined in COS-7 cells expressing FAAH restricted to the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, or the Golgi apparatus. AEA hydrolysis was detectable at the earliest measurable time point (3 seconds), suggesting that COS-7 cells, normally devoid of an endocannabinoid system, possess an efficient cytosolic trafficking mechanism for AEA. Three fatty  binding proteins (FABPs) known to be expressed in brain were examined as possible intracellular AEA carriers. AEA uptake and hydrolysis were significantly potentiated in N18TG2 neuroblastoma cells after overexpression of FABP5 or FABP7, but not FABP3. Similar results were observed in COS-7 cells stably expressing FAAH. Consistent with the roles of FABP as AEA carriers, administration of the competitive FABP ligand oleic  or the selective non-lipid FABP inhibitor BMS309403 attenuated AEA uptake and hydrolysis by approximately 50% in N18TG2 and COS-7 cells. Taken together, FABPs represent the first proteins known to transport AEA from the plasma membrane to FAAH for inactivation and may therefore be novel pharmacological targets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23037715>Ligand-independent activation of EphA2 by  induces metastasis-like behaviour in prostate cancer cells.</a></h2><p>High intake of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) has been associated with clinical progression in prostate cancer (CaP).

Ristocetin is an antimicrobial substance that induces vWF-mediated aggregation of platelets. We examined these mechanisms in injured patients by measuring the aggregation response of platelets to stimulating agonists (including ristocetin) via whole-blood multiple-electrode platelet aggregometry. We hypothesized that patients with TBI have an altered platelet aggregation response to ristocetin stimulation compared with patients without TBI.Blood was collected from 233 trauma patients without thrombocytopenia. Platelet aggregation was assessed using multiple-electrode platelet aggregometry (Multiplate). Platelet aggregation response to stimulating agonists collagen, thrombin receptor-activating peptide 6, adenosine diphosphate, , and ristocetin was measured. Factor activity was measured.Of the 233 patients, 23% had TBI. There were no differences in platelet aggregation responses to any agonists between TBI and non-TBI patients except ristocetin. Platelet aggregation response to ristocetin stimulation was significantly lower in TBI patients (p = 0.03). Patients with TBI also had higher factor VIII activity (215% vs. 156%, p = 0.01). In multivariate analysis, there was a significant independent association of impaired platelet aggregation response to ristocetin stimulation with TBI (odds ratio, 3.05; p = 0.04).Given the importance of platelets in hemostasis, understanding the mechanisms of impaired platelet aggregation following injury is critical. The impaired platelet aggregation response to ristocetin stimulation and corresponding increase in factor VIII activity in TBI patients may be secondary to a TBI-induced effect on vWF quantity (due to injury-driven consumption of vWF) or vWF  with resultant increase in circulating factor VIII activity (due to impaired carrying capacity of vWF). Given there are multiple known therapies for vWF deficits including desmopressin, purified and recombinant vWF, and estrogens, these lines of investigation are particularly compelling in patients with TBI and hemorrhage.Prognostic study, level II.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17518991>Role of prostaglandins on mechanical scratching-induced cutaneous  disruption in mice.</a></h2><p>The role of prostaglandins (PGs) on mechanical scratching-induced cutaneous  disruption in mice was investigated by comparing the observed effects of  (AA) application. Scratching of the mouse skin with a stainless-steel wire brush (mechanical scratching) was associated with significant, scratch-count-dependent elevation of the transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and skin PG levels (especially PGD(2) and PGE(2)). Histological evidence of inflammation (crusta, acanthosis and neutrophilic infiltration) in the skin also became evident 24 h after mechanical scratching. On the other hand, while topical application of 0.1% AA to the mouse skin also increased the skin PG levels, but did not produce any increase of TEWL or histological evidence of inflammation in the skin. Topical application of cyclooxygenase inhibitors (indomethacin, piroxicam, aspirin, diclofenac and ketoprofen) decreased the spontaneous recovery rates from cutaneous  disruption. These results suggest that the elevation of cutaneous PG production induced by mechanical scratching is involved in the repair of the skin damage caused by the scratching.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24043219>UVA irradiation of fatty acids and their oxidized products substantially increases their ability to generate singlet oxygen.</a></h2><p>UVA radiation plays an important role for adverse reactions in human tissue. UVA penetrates epidermis and dermis of skin being absorbed by various biomolecules, especially endogenous photosensitizers. This may generate deleterious singlet oxygen ((1)O2) that oxidizes fatty acids in cell membranes, lipoproteins, and other lipid-containing structures such as the epidermal . Indications exist that fatty acids are not only the target of (1)O2 but also act as potential photosensitizers under UVA irradiation, if already oxidized. Five different fatty acids in ethanol solution (stearic, oleic, linoleic, linolenic and ) were exposed to UVA radiation (355 nm, 100 mW) for 30 seconds. (1)O2 luminescence was detected time-resolved at 1270 nm and confirmed in spectrally-resolved experiments. The more double bonds fatty acids have the more (1)O2 photons were detected. In addition, fatty acids were continuously exposed to broadband UVA for up to 240 min. During that time span, UVA absorption and (1)O2 luminescence substantially increased with irradiation time, reached a maximum and decreased again. HPLC-MS analysis showed that the amount of peroxidized fatty acids and the (1)O2 generation increased and decreased in parallel. This indicates the high potential of peroxidized fatty acids to produce (1)O2 under UVA irradiation. In conclusion, fatty acids along with peroxidized products are weak endogenous photosensitizers but become strong photosensitizers under continuous UVA irradiation. Since fatty acids and their oxidized products are ubiquitous in living cells and in skin, which is frequently and long-lasting exposed to UVA radiation, this photosensitizing effect may contribute to initiation of deleterious photooxidative processes in tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21146550>The cPLA2α inhibitor efipladib decreases nociceptive responses without affecting PGE2 levels in the cerebral spinal fluid.</a></h2><p>The contribution of central PGE(2) levels to the nociceptive response in rats was assessed and the effects of the selective cPLA(2)α inhibitor efipladib, and pain therapies of different classes on these responses was determined. An inflammatory pain model was optimized in rats so that PGE(2) levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could be directly correlated to the nociceptive response. Since efipladib appears to have limited permeation of the blood-brain , we used this compound to determine the extent of pain reversal resulting primarily from peripheral, but not central, inhibition of the  (AA) pathway. The nociceptive response was significantly inhibited by orally administered efipladib, yet spinal fluid levels of PGE(2) and temperature measurements were unaffected compared to vehicle-treated animals. Conversely, intrathecal (IT) administration of efipladib reduced PGE(2) levels in the CSF by 45-60%, yet there was no effect on the nociceptive response. With COX-2 selective inhibitors and ibuprofen, a return of the nociceptive response developed over time, despite complete inhibition of PGE(2) in the spinal fluid. The opposite was true with low doses of indomethacin: inhibition of the nociceptive response was observed despite the lack of effect on central PGE(2) levels. Our results demonstrate that levels of PGE(2) in the spinal fluid do not directly correlate with the nociceptive response and that blocking cPLA(2)α in the periphery significantly decreases inflammatory pain.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite its limited access to the CNS, URB937 produces marked antinociceptive effects in rodents. URB937 is actively extruded from the CNS by the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) membrane transporter, Abcg2. Tissue Abcg2 levels are markedly different between males and females, and this transporter is known to limit the access of xenobiotics to the fetoplacental unit in gestating female rodents. In the present study, we investigated the tissue distribution and antinociceptive properties of URB937 in female mice and rats.We studied the systemic disposition of URB937 in female mice and the antinociceptive effects of this compound in models of visceral (acetic -induced writhing) and inflammatory nociception (carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia) in female mice and rats. Furthermore, we evaluated the interaction of URB937 with the blood-placenta  in gestating mice and rats.Abcg2 restricted the access of URB937 to the CNS of female mice and rats. Nevertheless, URB937 produced a high degree of antinociception in female mice and rats in models of visceral and inflammatory pain. Moreover, the compound displayed a restricted access to placental and fetal tissues in pregnant mice and rats.Peripheral FAAH blockade with URB937 reduces nociception in female mice and rats, as previously shown for males of the same species. In female mice and rats, Abcg2 limits the access of URB937, not only to the CNS, but also to the fetoplacental unit. LINKED ARTICLES This article is part of a themed section on Cannabinoids.

Our results suggest that both the holo and the apo forms of human Stable 5-LOX could accommodate AA in a productive form for 5-lipoxygenation. The former, in a tail-first orientation, with the AA carboxylate end interacting with Lys409, gives the desired structures with C7 close to the Fe-OH(-) cofactor and suitable  heights for H7 abstraction. Only when using the apo form structure, a head-first orientation with the AA carboxylate close to His600 (a residue recently proposed as essential for AA positioning) is obtained in the docking calculations. However, the calculated  heights for this head-first orientation are in principle consistent with 5-LOX specificity, but also with 12/8 regioselectivity. Finally, long MD simulations give support to the recent hypothesis that the Phe177 + Tyr181 pair needs to close the active site access during the chemical reaction, and suggest that in the case of a head-first orientation Phe177 may be the residue interacting with the AA carboxylate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22837859>Group V phospholipase A(2) increases pulmonary endothelial permeability through direct hydrolysis of the cell membrane.</a></h2><p>Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by inflammatory disruption of the alveolar-vascular , resulting in severe respiratory compromise. Inhibition of the intercellular messenger protein, Group V phospholipase A(2) (gVPLA(2)), blocks vascular permeability caused by LPS both in vivo and in vitro. In this investigation we studied the mechanism by which recombinant gVPLA(2) increases permeability of cultured human pulmonary endothelial cells (EC). Exogenous gVPLA(2) (500 nM), a highly hydrolytic enzyme, caused a significant increase in EC permeability that began within minutes and persisted for >10 hours. However, the major hydrolysis products of gVPLA(2) (Lyso-PC, Lyso-PG, LPA, ) did not cause EC structural rearrangement or loss of   at concentrations <10 μM. Higher concentrations (≥ 30 μM) of these membrane hydrolysis products caused some increased permeability but were associated with EC toxicity (measured by propidium iodide incorporation) that did not occur with  disruption by gVPLA(2) (500 nM). Pharmacologic inhibition of multiple intracellular signaling pathways induced by gVPLA(2) activity (ERK, p38, PI3K, cytosolic gIVPLA(2)) also did not prevent EC  disruption by gVPLA(2). Finally, pretreatment with heparinase to prevent internalization of gVPLA(2) did not inhibit EC  disruption by gVPLA(2). Our data thus indicate that gVPLA(2) increases pulmonary EC permeability directly through action as a membrane hydrolytic agent. Disruption of EC   does not depend upon membrane hydrolysis products, gVPLA(2) internalization, or upregulation of downstream intracellular signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18987328>Genetic loss of Faah compromises male fertility in mice.</a></h2><p>Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug. Although there is some indication that reproductive functions in males are impaired in chronic marijuana users, the genetic evidence and underlying causes remain largely unknown. Herein we show that genetic loss of Faah, which encodes fatty  amide hydrolase (FAAH), results in elevated levels of anandamide, an endocannabinoid, in the male reproductive system, leading to compromised fertilizing capacity of sperm. This defect is rescued by superimposing deletion of cannabinoid receptor 1 (Cnr1). Retention of Faah(-/-) sperm on the egg zona pellucida provides evidence that the capacity of sperm to penetrate the zona  is hampered by elevated anandamide levels. Collectively, the results show that aberrant endocannabinoid signaling via CNR1 impairs normal sperm .

Using a sensitive and versatile fluorometric method, significant PLA2 activity has been detected in both human skin homogenates and tape strippings of stratum corneum. Based on various properties (resistance to heat and sulphuric  treatment, neutral optimal pH, absolute requirement for millimolar calcium concentrations, inhibition by dithiothreitol and p-bromophenacyl bromide, and resistance to a trifluoromethyl ketone derivative of , AACOCF3, a specific inhibitor of cytosolic PLA2), this enzyme was characterized as a secretory PLA2 (sPLA2). Immunohistochemistry revealed strong labelling of type I pancreatic sPLA2 at the stratum corneum-stratum granulosum junction, type II sPLA2 being undetectable. An increase in PLA2 activity in tape-stripped material from the deepest level of the stratum corneum was correlated with partial morphological disappearance of type I sPLA2 immunolabelling. Our data thus provide the first convincing evidence that pancreatic sPLA2 is significantly expressed in human epidermis, where it might participate in the accumulation of free fatty acids contributing to the permeability . In addition, our method for determining PLA2 activity in easily available tape strippings should allow further clinical studies aimed to explore possible PLA2 abnormalities in various dermatoses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11910577>Monitoring extracellular concentrations of lactate, glutamate, and glycerol by in vivo microdialysis in the brain during liver transplantation in acute liver failure.</a></h2><p>Swelling of cerebral glial cells is a characteristic complication in patients with acute liver failure (ALF). This astrocyte edema may result in high intracranial pressure (ICP) and brain herniation before or during liver transplantation. Metabolic alterations responsible for the development of high ICP in patients with ALF are not fully understood. We describe changes in neurochemistry during liver transplantation using a cerebral microdialysis technique in a young man with severe ALF and cerebral edema. We found that the extracellular content of lactate ([lactate](ec)) gradually increased during the operation. Because cerebral oxygen saturation and [lactate](ec) to [pyruvate](ec) ratio were within normal limits, hypoxia was not likely to be responsible for the increased [lactate](ec) levels. Instead, we found that [lactate](ec) levels correlated in this patient with arterial lactate concentrations during and after grafting (r(2) = 0.96; P <.05), but did not correlate with arterial glucose concentrations (r(2) = 0.20; P = not significant).

Epithelial cell cultures are used to study the mechanisms of  and pathology, but 2D cultures may not reflect the 3D complexity of the epithelium. In this study, a polarised epithelial cell transwell culture was developed, using transepithelial resistance (TER), to monitor epithelial integrity. Polarised epithelial cells were treated with oxytocin and  to test physiological  and with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mimic bacterial infection. Supernatants were analysed for prostaglandin E(2) (PGE), prostaglandin F(2)(α), the chemokine interleukin-8 (IL8) and the ability of supernatants to induce neutrophil migration. Confluent epithelial cells established polarity when TER was >1800  Ω cm(2) and predominantly released prostaglandins basolaterally. In contrast, IL8 from epithelial cells accumulated apically and the supernatants were highly chemotactic for neutrophils. The striking exception was when the epithelial cells were treated with LPS in the apical or basolateral compartment independently, which led to the release of IL8 towards the treated compartment. Although stromal cells also accumulated PGE and IL8 in response to treatment, co-culture of stromal cells in the well below polarised epithelial cells did not influence cellular responses. In conclusion, polarised endometrial epithelial cells vectorially released prostaglandins and chemokines to reflect their respective mechanistic roles in  and pathology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19728990>Modulation of blood-brain  permeability by neutrophils: in vitro and in vivo studies.</a></h2><p>The blood-brain  (BBB) restricts solute permeability across healthy cerebral endothelial cells. However, during inflammation, permeability is increased and can lead to deleterious cerebral edema. Neutrophils are early cellular participants in acute inflammation, but their effect on BBB permeability is unclear. To study this, neutrophils were applied in a resting and activated state to in vitro and in vivo models of the BBB. In vitro, human neutrophils (5 x 10(6)/ml) were activated with tumor necrosis factor (100 U/ml) and leukotriene B(4) (10(-7) mol/l). Untreated neutrophils reduced permeability across the human brain endothelial cell line hCMEC/D3. Activated neutrophils returned permeability to baseline, an effect blocked by the reactive oxygen scavengers superoxide dismutase (10 U/ml) and catalase (1000 U/ml). In vivo, human neutrophils (2.5 x1 0(5) in 4 microl) were injected into the striatum of anesthetized juvenile Wistar rats, and BBB permeability measured 30 min later. This was compared to control injections (4 microl) of vehicle (0.9% saline) and  (10(-3) mol/l). The injection generated a small hematoma around the injection tract (<3 microl). Untreated neutrophils induced significantly lower permeability in their vicinity than activated neutrophils, with a trend to lowered permeability compared to the vehicle control. Neither untreated nor activated neutrophils induced permeability increases, while  increased permeability as a positive control. This study further delineates the effect of neutrophils on the BBB, and demonstrates that resting neutrophils induce acute reductions in permeability while activated neutrophils have a neutral effect. The in vivo model reiterates some aspects of acute intracerebral hemorrhage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11903735>Helicobacter pylori alters n-6 fatty  metabolism and prostaglandin E2 synthesis in rat gastric mucosal cells.</a></h2><p>Little is known about whether Helicobacter pylori infection alters fatty  metabolism in gastric mucosal cells.

Phosphatidylcholine content extracted from whole RGM-1 cells was quantitated by using a densitometer, and its fatty  composition was analyzed by using gas chromatography. Prostaglandin E2 concentration in the culture medium was measured by using radioimmunoassay. The expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 was examined by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In addition, after incubation with [1-14C] linoleic , radioactivities of both linoleic  and  components of the PC fraction were counted. The effects of H. pylori broth culture filtrates on PC content, its fatty  composition and prostaglandin (PG)E2 synthesis were also assessed.Linoleic  addition caused an increase in the composition of , as well as linoleic , and also in PGE2 concentration. Cyclo-oxygenase-2 expression was induced in RGM-1 cells by the addition of linoleic . In addition, [1-14C] linoleic  added to the culture medium was converted to [1-14C]  in RGM-1 cells. Helicobacter pylori broth culture filtrates decreased linoleic  composition and increased  composition. Moreover, after incubation with H. pylori broth culture filtrates, PGE2 concentrations were higher than that of the controls.These findings suggest the presence of fatty  elongase and Delta5- and Delta6-desaturases synthesize  from linoleic  in RGM-1 cells. Thus, H. pylori infection may enhance PGE2 synthesis and accelerate n-6 fatty  metabolism in gastric mucosal cells, which could make the gastric mucosal  more fragile.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27425399>Modulation of TRPV4 by diverse mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Transient receptor potential ion channels (TRP) are a superfamily of non-selective ion channels which are opened in response to a diverse range of stimuli. The TRP vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) ion channel is opened in response to heat, mechanical stimuli, hypo-osmolarity and  metabolites. However, recently TRPV4 has been identified as an ion channel that is modulated by, and opened by intracellular signalling cascades from other receptors and signalling pathways. Although TRPV4 knockout mice show relatively mild phenotypes, some mutations in TRPV4 cause severe developmental abnormalities, such as the skeletal dyplasia and arthropathy. Regulated TRPV4  is also essential for healthy cardiovascular system  as a potent agonist compromises endothelial cell , leading to vascular collapse. A better understanding of the signalling mechanisms that modulate TRPV4  is necessary to understand its physiological roles. Post translational modification of TRPV4 by kinases and other signalling molecules can modulate TRPV4 opening in response to stimuli such as mechanical and hyposmolarity and there is an emerging area of research implicating TRPV4 as a transducer of these signals as opposed to a direct sensor of the stimuli. Due to its wide expression profile, TRPV4 is implicated in multiple pathophysiological states. TRPV4 contributes to the sensation of pain due to hypo-osmotic stimuli and inflammatory mechanical hyperalsgesia, where TRPV4 sensitizaton by intracellular signalling leads to pain behaviors in mice. In the vasculature, TRPV4 is a regulator of vessel tone and is implicated in hypertension and diabetes due to endothelial dysfunction. TRPV4 is a key regulator of epithelial and endothelial   and signalling to and opening of TRPV4 can disrupt these critical protective barriers. In respiratory , TRPV4 is involved in cystic fibrosis, cilary beat frequency, bronchoconstriction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension, acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome and cough.In this review we highlight how modulation of TRPV4 opening is a vital signalling component in a range of tissues and why understanding of TRPV4 regulation in the body may lead to novel therapeutic approaches to treating a range of disease states.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

During late pregnancy there is an accelerated breakdown of fat depots, which plays a key role in fetal development. Besides using placental transferred fatty acids, the fetus benefits from two other products: glycerol and ketone bodies. Although glycerol crosses the placenta in small proportions, it is a preferential substrate for maternal gluconeogenesis, and maternal glucose is quantitatively the main substrate crossing the placenta. Enhanced ketogenesis under fasting conditions and the easy transfer of ketones to the fetus allow maternal ketone bodies to reach the fetus, where they can be used as fuels for oxidative metabolism as well as lipogenic substrates. Although maternal cholesterol is an important source of cholesterol for the fetus during early gestation, its importance becomes minimal during late pregnancy, owing to the high capacity of fetal tissues to synthesize cholesterol. Maternal hypertriglyceridemia is a characteristic feature during pregnancy and corresponds to an accumulation of triglycerides not only in very low-density lipoprotein but also in low- and high-density lipoprotein. Although triglycerides do not cross the placental , the presence of lipoprotein receptors in the placenta, together with lipoprotein lipase, phospholipase A2, and intracellular lipase activities, allows the release to the fetus of polyunsaturated fatty acids transported as triglycerides in maternal plasma lipoproteins. Normal fetal development needs the availability of both essential fatty acids and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, and the nutritional status of the mother during gestation has been related to fetal growth. However, excessive intake of certain long chain fatty acids may cause both declines in  and enhanced lipid peroxidation, reducing antioxidant capacity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19843309>Steroids mediate resistance to the bactericidal effect of phosphatidylcholines against Helicobacter pylori.</a></h2><p>Helicobacter pylori assimilates various steroids as membrane lipid components, but it can also survive in the absence of steroids. It thus remains to be clarified as to why the organism relies on steroid physiologically. In this study, we have found that phosphatidylcholine carrying a linoleic  molecule or  molecule has the potential to kill steroid-free H. pylori. The bactericidal action of phosphatidylcholines against H. pylori was due to the lytic activity of the phosphatidylcholines themselves and not due to the lytic activity of the unsaturated fatty acids or lyso-phosphatidylcholine resulting from the hydrolysis of the phosphatidylcholines. In contrast to the steroid-free H. pylori, the organism that absorbed and glucosylated free cholesterol was unaffected by the bactericidal action of the phosphatidylcholines. Similarly, H. pylori that absorbed estrone without glucosylating it also resisted the bactericidal action of the phosphatidylcholines. The steroids absorbed by H. pylori existed in both the outer and inner membranes, while the glucosyl-steroids produced via the steroid absorption were localized in the outer membrane rather than in the inner membrane. These results indicate that H. pylori absorbs the steroids to reinforce the membrane lipid  and thereby expresses resistance to the bacteriolytic action of hydrophobic compounds such as phosphatidylcholine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26246200>Maternal and neonatal dietary intake of balanced n-6/n-3 fatty acids modulates experimental colitis in young adult rats.</a></h2><p>The imbalance of n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the maternal diet impairs intestinal  development and sensitizes the colon response to inflammatory insults in the young rats. With a view to overcoming this issue, we designed this study to investigate the effect of maternal and neonatal intake of different proportions of n-6/n-3 fatty acids on colon inflammation in the young adult rats.Female Wistar rats were assigned into four groups, and each group fed one of four semisynthetic diets, namely n-6, low n-3, n-6/n-3 and n-3 fatty acids for 8 weeks prior to mating, during gestation and lactation periods. At weaning, the pups were separated from the dams and fed diet similar to the mothers. Colitis was induced on postnatal day 35, by administering 2 % dextran sulfate sodium in drinking water for 10 days. Colitis was assessed based on the clinical and inflammatory markers in the colon. Fatty  analysis was done in liver, RBC, colon and spleen.A balanced n-6/n-3 PUFA diet significantly improved the body weight loss, rectal bleeding and mortality in rats. This was associated with lower myeloperoxidase activity, nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2, TNF-α and IL-6, IL-8, COX-2 and iNOS levels in the colon tissues. Fatty  analysis has shown that the /docosahexaenoic  ratio was significantly lower in liver, RBC, colon and spleen in n-6/n-3 and n-3 diet groups.We demonstrate that balanced n-6/n-3 PUFA supplementation in maternal and neonatal diet alters systemic AA/DHA ratio and attenuates colon inflammation in the young adult rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11694324>Leukotrienes play protective roles early during experimental VSV encephalitis.</a></h2><p>Leukotrienes (LT) are potent lipid mediators of inflammation. 5-Lipoxygenase (5-LO) is the key enzyme in the conversion of  to LT. There are four LT: LTB(4), LTC(4), LTD(4) and LTE(4). LT have been extensively studied in airway inflammation but little is known about their roles in viral infection in the CNS. LTB(4) is a chemoattractant for neutrophils. In this work, we studied the roles of LT in acute vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) encephalitis. Two methods were used to disrupt 5-LO activity: mice were treated with Zileuton, an enzyme antagonist, or 5-LO genetic knockout mice were used. We found that inhibition or deletion of 5-LO resulted in: (a) impaired process of neutrophil infiltration into the CNS early during viral infection; (b) fewer neurons expressed nitric oxide synthase-1 (NOS-1); (c) higher viral titers 1 day after viral infection; and (d) increased disruption of blood brain  (BBB). Our studies suggest that LT are important innate immune players during VSV pathogenesis and are beneficial to the host in early control of viral replication in the CNS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17545313>Endocannabinoid enhancement protects against kainic -induced seizures and associated brain damage.</a></h2><p>Endocannabinoids are released in response to pathogenic insults, and inhibitors of endocannabinoid inactivation enhance such on-demand responses that promote cellular protection. Here, AM374 (palmitylsulfonyl fluoride), an irreversible inhibitor of fatty  amide hydrolase (FAAH), was injected i.p. into rats to test for endocannabinoid enhancement. AM374 caused a prolonged elevation of anandamide levels in several brain regions, including the hippocampus, and resulted in rapid activation of the extracellular signal regulated-kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway that has been linked to survival. To evaluate the neuroprotective nature of the FAAH inhibitor, we tested AM374 in a seizure model involving rats insulted with kainic  (KA). AM374 was injected immediately after KA administration, and seizure scores were significantly reduced throughout a 4-h observation period. The KA-induced seizures were associated with calpain-mediated cytoskeletal breakdown, reductions in synaptic markers, and loss of CA1 hippocampal neurons. FAAH inhibition protected against the excitotoxic damage and neuronal loss assessed 48 h postinsult. AM374 also preserved pre- and postsynaptic markers to levels comparable with those found in noninsulted animals, and the synaptic marker preservation strongly correlated with reduced seizure scores. With regard to behavioral deficits in the excitotoxic rats, AM374 produced nearly complete functional protection, significantly improving balance and coordination across different behavioral paradigms. These data indicate that AM374 crosses the blood-brain , enhances endocannabinoid responses in key neuronal circuitries, and protects the brain against excitotoxic damage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29568904>Roles of elevated 20‑HETE in the breakdown of blood brain  and the severity of brain edema in experimental traumatic brain injury.</a></h2><p>Breakdown of the blood brain  (BBB) is a secondary injury following traumatic brain injury (TBI) and can lead to the development of brain edema. However, the factors that contribute to the disruption of the BBB and increase the severity of brain edema in TBI remain to be elucidated. 20‑hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (20‑HETE) is a metabolite of . The inhibition of 20‑HETEsynthesis by HET0016 has been suggested as a strategy to decrease brain edema. The present study aimed to investigate whether the elevated production of 20‑HETE in cerebral tissue may contribute to BBB breakdown and increase the severity of brain edema in rats with TBI. BBB permeability was quantified using dynamic contrast‑enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and brain edema was measured according to brain water content. Superoxide production in injured tissue was also assessed. Liquid chromatography‑mass spectrometry was used to evaluate 20‑HETE production in injured tissue. Western blot analysis was used to assess the expression of occludin, zonula occludens (ZO)‑1, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)‑9, and proteins of the c‑Jun N‑terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. A total of 3, 24 and 72 h following the induction of TBI, 20‑HETE levels, BBB permeability and brain edema were identified to be increased, accompanied by an increase in superoxide production. Conversely, superoxide dismutase levels, in addition to the total antioxidative capability were decreased. In addition, the expression of MMP‑9 and proteins of the JNK pathway was upregulated, whereas the expression of occludin and ZO‑1 was observed to be suppressed. These results suggested that 20‑HETE may aggravate BBB disruption following TBI, via enhancing the expression of MMP‑9 and tight junction proteins. Furthermore, oxidative stress and the JNK signaling pathway may be involved in BBB dysregulation. In conclusion, the results of the present demonstrated that the production of 20‑HETE was increased in cerebral tissue following traumatic injury, thus suggesting that it may contribute to the compromise of BBB integrity and the development of brain edema.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26433161>Defects in 15-HETE Production and Control of Epithelial Permeability by Human Enteric Glial Cells From Patients With Crohn's Disease.</a></h2><p>Enteric glial cells (EGCs) produce soluble mediators that regulate homeostasis and permeability of the intestinal epithelial  (IEB). We investigated the profile of polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) metabolites produced by EGCs from rats and from patients with Crohn's disease (CD), compared with controls, along with the ability of one of these metabolites, 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (15-HETE), to regulate the permeability of the IEB.We isolated EGCs from male Sprague-Dawley rats, intestinal resections of 6 patients with CD, and uninflamed healthy areas of intestinal tissue from 6 patients who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer (controls). EGC-conditioned media was analyzed by high-sensitivity liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to determine PUFA signatures. We used immunostaining to identify 15-HETE-producing enzymes in EGCs and tissues. The effects of human EGCs and 15-HETE on permeability and transepithelial electrical resistance of the IEB were measured using Caco-2 cells; effects on signal transduction proteins were measured with immunoblots. Levels of proteins were reduced in Caco-2 cells using short-hairpin RNAs or proteins were inhibited pharmacologically. Rats were given intraperitoneal injections of 15-HETE or an inhibitor of 15-lipoxygenase (the enzyme that produces 15-HETE); colons were collected and permeability was measured.EGCs expressed 15-lipoxygenase-2 and produced high levels of 15-HETE, which increased IEB resistance and reduced IEB permeability. 15-HETE production was reduced in EGCs from patients with CD compared with controls. EGCs from patients with CD were unable to reduce the permeability of the IEB; the addition of 15-HETE restored permeability to levels of control tissues. Inhibiting 15-HETE production in rats increased the permeability of the IEB in colon tissues. We found that 15-HETE regulates IEB permeability by inhibiting an adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and increasing expression of zonula occludens-1.Enteric glial cells from patients with CD have reduced production of 15-HETE, which controls IEB permeability by inhibiting adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and increasing expression of zonula occludens-1.Copyright © 2016 AGA Institute.

However, it is not clear whether AA plays some TRPV3-mediated pathological roles in the development of edema. Pharmacological and histological studies using ICR and ICR mice indicated that higher ear edema responses to topical application of AA were observed in ICR mice compared with ICR mice. However, there was no difference in the ear edema response to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, skin histology, and skin   between these mouse strains. Furthermore, oxidized fatty acids from the lesional site were analyzed to elucidate the TRPV3-mediated pathological roles of AA, and the results revealed that there were no differences in the level of COX or LOX metabolites derived from AA between both mouse strains. We concluded that AA plays a role in the development of TRPV3-mediated ear edema and that this result may contribute to better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the development of a certain type of edema.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28663336>Effects of prostaglandin lipid mediators on agonist-induced lung endothelial permeability and inflammation.</a></h2><p>Prostaglandins (PG), the products of cyclooxygenase-mediated conversion of , become upregulated in many situations including allergic response, inflammation, and injury, and exhibit a variety of biological activities. Previous studies described -enhancing and anti-inflammatory effects of PGE and PGI on vascular endothelial cells (EC). Yet, the effects of other PG members on EC  and inflammatory activation have not been systematically analyzed. This study compared effects of PGE, PGI, PGF, PGA, PGJ, and PGD on human pulmonary EC. EC permeability was assessed by measurements of transendothelial electrical resistance and cell monolayer permeability for FITC-labeled tracer. Anti-inflammatory effects of PGs were evaluated by analysis of expression of adhesion molecule ICAM1 and secretion of soluble ICAM1 and cytokines by EC. PGE, PGI, and PGA exhibited the most potent -enhancing effects and most efficient attenuation of thrombin-induced EC permeability and contractile response, whereas PGI effectively suppressed thrombin-induced permeability but was less efficient in the attenuation of prolonged EC hyperpermeability caused by interleukin-6 or bacterial wall lipopolysaccharide, LPS. PGD showed a modest protective effect on the EC inflammatory response, whereas PGF and PGJ were without effect on agonist-induced EC  dysfunction. In vivo, PGE, PGI, and PGA attenuated LPS-induced lung inflammation, whereas PGF and PGJ were without effect. Interestingly, PGD exhibited a protective effect in the in vivo model of LPS-induced lung injury. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of -protective and anti-inflammatory effects of different prostaglandins on lung EC in vitro and in vivo and identifies PGE, PGI, and PGA as prostaglandins with the most potent protective properties.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25480980>Two distinct leukotriene B4 receptors, BLT1 and BLT2.</a></h2><p>Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a potent inflammatory mediator derived from . Two G protein-coupled receptors for LTB4 have been identified: a high-affinity receptor, BLT1, and a low-affinity receptor, BLT2. Both receptors mainly couple to pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi-like G proteins and induce cell migration. 12(S)-hydroxy-5Z,8E,10E-heptadecatrienoic  (12-HHT) was identified to bind BLT2 with higher affinity than LTB4. Expression of BLT1 was confirmed in type 1 helper T cells, type 2 helper T cells, type 17 helper T cells, effector CD8(+) T cells, dendritic cells and osteoclasts in addition to granulocytes, eosinophils and macrophages, and BLT1-deficient mice showed greatly reduced phenotypes in models of various inflammatory diseases, such as peritonitis, bronchial asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis and osteoporosis. In mice, BLT2 expression is restricted to intestinal epithelial cells and epidermal keratinocytes. BLT2-deficient mice showed enhanced colitis after administration of dextran sulfate, possibly due to reduced intestinal  . An aspirin-dependent reduction in 12-HHT production was responsible for delayed skin wound healing, showing that the 12-HHT/BLT2 axis also plays an important role in skin biology. BLT1 and BLT2 are therefore potential targets for the development of novel drugs.© The Authors 2014. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Japanese Biochemical Society.

Breakdown of the blood-brain  (BBB) is frequently observed in patients with HIV-associated dementia (HAD) despite lack of productive infection of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC). Cellular products and viral proteins secreted by HIV-1 infected cells, such as the HIV-1 Gp120 envelope glycoprotein, play important roles in BBB impairment and HIV-associated dementia development. HBMEC are a major component of the BBB. Using cocultures of HBMEC and human astrocytes as a model system for human BBB as well as in vivo model, we show for the first time that cannabinoid agonists inhibited HIV-1 Gp120-induced calcium influx mediated by substance P and significantly decreased the permeability of HBMEC as well as prevented tight junction protein down-regulation of ZO-1, claudin-5, and JAM-1 in HBMEC. Furthermore, cannabinoid agonists inhibited the transmigration of human monocytes across the BBB and blocked the BBB permeability in vivo. These results demonstrate that cannabinoid agonists are able to restore the integrity of HBMEC and the BBB following insults by HIV-1 Gp120. These studies may lead to better strategies for treatment modalities targeted to the BBB following HIV-1 infection of the brain based on cannabinoid pharmacotherapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19783480>Opening the flood-gates: how neutrophil-endothelial interactions regulate permeability.</a></h2><p>Many diseases have an inflammatory component, where neutrophil interactions with the vascular endothelium lead to  dysfunction and increased permeability. Neutrophils increase permeability through secreted products such as the chemokines CXCL1, 2, 3, and 8, through adhesion-dependent processes involving beta(2) integrins interacting with endothelial ICAM-1, and through combinations where beta(2) integrin engagement leads to degranulation and secretion of heparin-binding protein. Some neutrophil products, such as  or the leukotriene LTA4, are further processed by endothelial enzymes via transcellular metabolism before the resulting products thromboxane A2 or LTC4 can activate their cognate receptors.

To examine the role of inflammatory cells in brain edema formation, we studied the expression cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, a key enzyme in  metabolism, by microglia in the C6 rodent glioma model.The expression of COX-2 in primary microglia cultures obtained from intracranial rat C6 gliomas was examined using reverse transcription-PCR, Western analysis, and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) enzyme immunoassay. Blood-tumor  permeability was studied in the same tumor model using magnetic resonance imaging.In contrast to C6 glioma cells, microglia isolated from intracranial C6 tumors produced high levels of PGE(2) through a COX-2-dependent pathway. To test whether the observed microglia COX-2 activity played a role in brain edema formation in gliomas, tumor-bearing rats were treated with rofecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor. Rofecoxib was as effective as dexamethasone in decreasing the diffusion of contrast material into the brain parenchyma (P = 0.01, rofecoxib versus control animals), suggesting a reduction in blood-tumor  permeability.These findings suggest that glioma-infiltrating microglia are a major source of PGE(2) production through the COX-2 pathway and support the use of COX-2 inhibitors as possible alternatives to glucocorticoids in the treatment of peritumoral edema in patients with malignant brain tumors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18322019>Loss of prostaglandin E2 release from immortalized urothelial cells obtained from interstitial cystitis patient bladders.</a></h2><p>Interstitial cystitis (IC) is associated with increased activated mast cell numbers in the bladder and impairment of the   of the urothelium. We stimulated immortalized urothelial cells derived from the inflamed region of IC bladders (SR22A or SM28 abn) or from healthy bladders (PD07i or PD08i) with tryptase and measured phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) activity and the resultant release of  and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)). Tryptase stimulation of either PD07i or SR22A resulted in similar increases in PLA(2) activity and  release. However, tryptase stimulation of SR22A and SM28 abn did not result in a significant increase in PGE(2) release compared with the increase in PGE(2) release from tryptase-stimulated PD07i and PD08i cells. Expression of mRNA for cyclooxygenase-2 and PGE synthase was lower and mRNA for 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase was higher in SR22A compared with PD07i, suggesting that both decreased synthesis and increased metabolism are responsible for the lack of a PGE(2) response in tryptase-stimulated SR22A cells. Since PGE(2) is a cytoprotective eicosanoid, the failure to produce this metabolite in cells isolated from the IC bladder may represent an increased susceptibility to damage by proinfammatory stimuli.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21388747>Postpartum changes in maternal and infant erythrocyte fatty acids are likely to be driven by restoring insulin sensitivity and DHA status.</a></h2><p>Perinatal changes in maternal glucose and lipid fluxes and de novo lipogenesis (DNL) are driven by hormones and nutrients. Docosahexaenoic  (DHA) reduces, whereas insulin augments, nuclear abundance of sterol-regulatory-element-binding-protein-1 (SREBP-1), which promotes DNL, stearoyl-CoA-desaturase (SCD, also Δ9-desaturase), fatty -(FA)-elongation (Elovl) and FA-desaturation (FADS). Decreasing maternal insulin sensitivity with advancing gestation and compensatory hyperinsulinemia cause augmented postprandial glucose levels, adipose tissue lipolysis and hepatic glucose- and VLDL-production. Hepatic VLDL is composed of dietary, body store and DNL derived FA. Decreasing insulin sensitivity increases the contribution of FA from hepatic-DNL in VLDL-triacylglycerols, and consequently saturated-FA and monounsaturated-FA (MUFA) in maternal serum lipids increase during pregnancy. Although other authors described changes in maternal serum and RBC essential-FA (EFA) after delivery, none went into detail about the changes in non-EFA and the mechanisms behind -and/or functions of- the observed changes.Postpartum FA-changes result from changing enzymatic activities that are influenced by the changing hormonal milieu after delivery and DHA-status.We studied FA-profiles and FA-ratios (as indices for enzymatic activities) of maternal and infant RBC at delivery and after 3 months exclusive breastfeeding in three populations with increasing freshwater-fish intakes. DNL-, SCD- and FADS2-activities decreased after delivery. Elongation-6 (Elovl-6)- and FADS1-activities increased. The most pronounced postpartum changes for mothers were increases in 18:0, linoleic (LA),  (AA) and decreases in 16:0, 18:1ω9 and DHA; and for infants increases in 18:1ω9, 22:5ω3, LA and decreases in 16:0 and AA. Changes were in line with the literature.Postpartum increases in 18:0, and decreases in 16:0 and 18:1ω9, might derive from reduced insulin-promoted DNL-activity, with more reduced SCD- than Elovl-activity that leaves more 16:0 to be converted to 18:0 (Elovl-activity) than to MUFA (SCD-activity). Postpartum changes in ΣDNL, saturated-FA and MUFA related negatively to RBC-DHA. This concurs with suppression of both SCD- and Elovl-6 activities by DHA, through its influence on SREBP. Infant MUFA and LA increased at expense of their mothers. Sustained transport might be important for myelination (MUFA) and skin  development (LA). Maternal postpartum decreases in FADS2-, and apparent increases in FADS1-activity, together with increases in LA, AA, and 22:5ω3, but decrease in DHA, confirm that FADS2 is rate limiting in EFA-desaturation. Maternal LA and AA increases might be the result of rerouting from transplacental transfer to the incorporation into milk lipids and discontinued placental AA-utilization.Perinatal changes in maternal and infant FA status may be strongly driven by changing insulin sensitivity and DHA status.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Products of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) pathway of  metabolism are increasingly recognized as playing major roles in renal . We used in vitro albumin permeability (P(alb)) as a measure of injury and puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) as an injurious agent to test the hypothesis that 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (20-HETE) protects the glomerular filtration  from increased P(alb).We determined P(alb) in the following experimental groups: (1) isolated rat glomeruli incubated with PAN (5 microg/mL) for 5, 15, 30 or 60 minutes; (2) isolated glomeruli preincubated with 20-HETE (1.0 nmol/L to 100 nmol/L) for 15 minutes followed by additional incubation with PAN (5 microg/mL) for 15 minutes; (3) isolated glomeruli from rats treated with the CYP450 4A inducer clofibrate, and incubated with PAN (5 microg/mL) for 15 minutes; and (4) appropriate controls for each group. CYP450 4A levels were measured in glomeruli isolated from rats treated with clofibrate or vehicle.PAN increased P(alb) of isolated glomeruli as early as 5 minutes (P(alb) 0.33 +/- 0.21, P < 0.05 vs. control). Maximal effect occurred at 30 minutes (P(alb) 0.75 +/- 0.16, P < 0.001 vs. control). Inclusion of 20-HETE (100 nmol/L) blocked the increased P(alb) caused by PAN (P(alb) 0.05 +/- 0.13). Likewise, glomeruli isolated from rats treated with clofibrate were protected from PAN-induced increase in P(alb) (P(alb) 0.19 +/- 0.03). Treatment with clofibrate significantly increased glomerular CYP450 4A expression.PAN directly and immediately affects the glomerular permeability . Furthermore, exogenous 20-HETE or clofibrate treatment protects glomeruli from increased P(alb) caused by PAN. Relative lack of 20-HETE may be a general characteristic of proteinuric states.

In ECs, the protein level of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 was also enhanced significantly, a finding not observed in cocultured pericytes. The expression of protein kinase C-alpha (PKCalpha) and its phosphorylated form was also enhanced in ECs. Wortmannin, LY294002, and PD98059, used as inhibitors of upstream kinases (the PI3-kinase/Akt/PDK1 or MEK-1 pathway) in cultures, markedly attenuated AA release and the expression of phosphorylated forms of endothelial cPLA(2), PKCalpha, and ERK1/2. By confocal microscopy, activation of PKCalpha in perinuclear regions of ECs grown in coculture as well as strong activation of cPLA(2) in ECs taken from a model of mixed culture were clearly observed. However, no increased expression of both enzymes was found in cocultured pericytes. Our findings indicate that a sequential activation of PKCalpha contributes to endothelial ERK1/2 and cPLA(2) phosphorylation induced by either soluble factors or direct cell-to-cell contact, and that the PKCalpha-cPLA(2) pathway appears to play a key role in the early phase of EC-pericyte interactions regulating blood retina or blood-brain  maturation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30300851>Resolution of inflammation in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders.</a></h2><p>Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) are a spectrum of neuroinflammatory disorders associated with autoimmune antibodies against aquaporin-4 (AQP4). Accumulating evidence suggests that inflammation is involved in NMOSD pathogenesis. Resolution of inflammation, which is a highly regulated process mediated by specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) is important to prevent over-responsive inflammation. Deficiency in resolution of inflammation may lead to or accelerates inflammatory diseases. However, whether resolution of inflammation is impaired in NMOSD is not known. The objective of this study was to analyze the levels of SPMs in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of NMOSD patients, and to explore the roles of SPMs in clinical features of NMOSD.Thirty-five patients with NMOSD, 34 patients with multiple sclerosis, and 36 patients with non-inflammatory neurological diseases were enrolled in this study. Pro-resolving mediators including Annexin A1 (ANXA1) and resolvin D1 (RvD1), as well as pro-inflammatory lipid mediator leukotriene B4 (LTB4) levels were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines as well as chemokine levels were analyzed using cytometric beads array (CBA).Our results showed RvD1 levels were significantly decreased, whereas LTB4 levels were significantly increased in the CSF of NMOSD patients. AQP4-IgG titer was negatively correlated with RvD1 levels in the CSF of NMOSD patients.Decreased RvD1 levels indicate impaired resolution of inflammation in NMOSD patients. AQP4-IgG may contribute to increased inflammation and lead to unresolved inflammation in NMOSD.Copyright © 2018.

Imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) was used to visualize twelve molecular species of phosphatidylcholine (PC) on thin slices of spinal cord with SCI. In addition, twelve species of phospholipids and five species of prostaglandins (PGs) were quantified by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) of lipid extracts from control/injured spinal cords. Unique distribution patterns were observed for phospholipids with different fatty  compositions, and distinct dynamic changes were seen in both their amounts and their distributions in tissue as tissue damage resulting from SCI progressed. In particular, PCs containing docosahexaenoic  localized to the large nucleus in the anterior horn region at one day post-SCI and rapidly decreased thereafter. In contrast, PCs containing  (AA-PCs) were normally found in the posterior horn region and were intensely and temporarily elevated one week after SCI. Lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) also increased at the same SCI stage and in regions with elevated AA-PCs, indicating the release of AA and the production of PGs. Moreover, LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis of lipid extracts from the spinal cord tissue at the impact site demonstrated a peak in PGE2 that reflected the elevation/reduction pattern of AA-PCs and LPC. Although further investigation is required, we suggest that invasive immune cells that penetrated from the impaired blood-brain  at 1-2 weeks post-SCI may have produced LPCs, released AA from AA-PCs, and produced PGs in SCI tissue at sites enriched in AA-PCs/LPC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19144269>Endomorphin-1 inhibits the activation and the development of a hyporesponsive-like phenotype in lipopolysaccharide- stimulated THP-1 monocytes.</a></h2><p>Endomorphin-1 (EM-1) is an endogenous opioid peptide selectively binding to micro opioid receptors (MORs). Besides its analgesic effects on the central nervous system (CNS), it has been recently reported that EM-1 can cross the blood-brain  (BBB) and diffuse into the blood, behaving as an analgesic/anti-inflammatory molecule on peripheral tissues, thus leading to the hypothesis that it could represent a soluble modulator of immune cell functions. Interestingly, nothing is known about its possible effects on monocytes, the main circulating cell-type involved in those systemic responses, such as fever and septic states, involving the release of high amounts of pyrogenic inflammatory factors. The aim of this work is to evaluate possible EM-1effects on lipopolisaccharide (LPS)-stimulated THP-1 monocytes in terms of the production of inflammatory mediators and the instauration of a hyporesponsive-like phenotype which is a main feature of systemic inflammatory responses, and on the development of peripheral monocytes to DC. Our data demonstrate for the first time that EM-1 is able to inhibit both LPS-stimulated monocyte activation, in terms of , PGE2, ROI and NO2 production and instauration of a hyporesponsive phenotype without any macroscopic effect on DC development. These data support the hypothesis that EM-1 could be involved in modulating monocyte functions during systemic inflammatory reactions, also providing new evidence for its eventual clinical application in endotoxic states.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16451000>Electron-transfer oxidation properties of unsaturated fatty acids and mechanistic insight into lipoxygenases.</a></h2><p>Rate constants of photoinduced electron-transfer oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids with a series of singlet excited states of oxidants in acetonitrile at 298 K were examined and the resulting electron-transfer rate constants (k(et)) were evaluated in light of the free energy relationship of electron transfer to determine the one-electron oxidation potentials (E(ox)) of unsaturated fatty acids and the intrinsic  of electron transfer. The k(et) values of linoleic  with a series of oxidants are the same as the corresponding k(et) values of methyl linoleate, linolenic , and , leading to the same E(ox) value of linoleic , methyl linoleate, linolenic , and  (1.76 V vs SCE), which is significantly lower than that of oleic  (2.03 V vs SCE) as indicated by the smaller k(et) values of oleic  than those of other unsaturated fatty acids. The radical cation of linoleic  produced in photoinduced electron transfer from linoleic  to the singlet excited state of 10-methylacridinium ion as well as that of 9,10-dicyanoanthracene was detected by laser flash photolysis experiments. The apparent rate constant of deprotonation of the radical cation of linoleic  was determined as 8.1 x 10(3) s(-1). In the presence of oxygen, the addition of oxygen to the deprotonated radical produces the peroxyl radical, which has successfully been detected by ESR. No thermal electron transfer or proton-coupled electron transfer has occurred from linoleic  to a strong one-electron oxidant, Ru(bpy)3(3+) (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine) or Fe(bpy)3(3+).

The present study utilized the same experimental model to analyse the effect of phagocytosis of: HZ, delipidized HZ, beta-haematin (lipid-free synthetic HZ) and trophozoites on production of IL-1beta and MMP-9 activity and expression. The second aim was to find out which component of HZ was responsible for the effects.Native HZ freshly isolated from Plasmodium falciparum (Palo Alto strain, Mycoplasma-free), delipidized HZ, beta-haematin (lipid-free synthetic HZ), trophozoites and control meals such as opsonized non-parasitized RBCs and inert latex particles, were fed to human monocytes. The production of IL-1beta by differently fed monocytes, in presence or absence of specific MMP-9 inhibitor or anti-hIL-1beta antibodies, was quantified in supernatants by ELISA. Expression of IL-1beta was analysed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. MMP-9 activity and protein expression were quantified by gelatin zymography and Western blotting.Monocytes fed with HZ or trophozoite-parasitized RBCs generated increased amounts of IL-1beta and enhanced enzyme activity (in cell supernatants) and protein/mRNA expression (in cell lysates) of monocyte MMP-9. The latter appears to be causally related to enhanced IL-1beta production, as enhancement of both expression and enzyme activity were abrogated by anti-hIL-1beta Abs. Upregulation of IL-1beta and MMP-9 were absent in monocytes fed with beta-haematin or delipidized HZ, indicating a role for HZ-attached or HZ-generated lipid components. 15-HETE (15(S,R)-hydroxy-6,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic ) a potent lipoperoxidation derivative generated by HZ from  via haem-catalysis was identified as one mediator possibly responsible for increase of both IL-1beta production and MMP-9 activity.Results indicate that specific lipoperoxide derivatives generated by HZ may play a role in modulating production of IL-1beta and MMP-9 expression and activity in HZ/trophozoite-fed human monocytes. Results may clarify aspects of cerebral malaria pathogenesis, since MMP-9, a metalloproteinase able to disrupt the basal lamina is possibly involved in generation of hallmarks of cerebral malaria, such as blood-brain  endothelium dysfunction, localized haemorrhages and extravasation of phagocytic cells and parasitized RBCs into brain tissues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26808080>The endogenous cannabinoid anandamide increases human airway epithelial cell permeability through an  metabolite.</a></h2><p>Injury to the bronchial epithelium in respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD results in the loss of   and an elevated sensitivity to environmental insults. An increased release of the endogenous cannabinoid, anandamide in response to inhalation of allergen in asthmatic patients has been reported. The aim of this study was, therefore, to determine the effects of endocannabinoids on bronchial epithelial cell permeability and to investigate the mechanisms involved. Calu-3 human bronchial epithelial cells were cultured at air-liquid interface to allow development of tight junctions. Changes in Transepithelial Electrical Resistance (TEER), a reflection of epithelial permeability, were measured at various time points post-treatment, and expression of the tight junction proteins, occludin and ZO-1, were determined using Western immunoblotting. Anandamide produced a significant reduction in TEER, which was unaffected by cannabinoid receptor antagonists, but attenuated by URB597, an inhibitor of fatty  amide hydrolase, and by a combination of cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) blockade. The anandamide metabolite, , showed similar TEER decrease that was also prevented in the presence of COX and LOX inhibitor. Expression of occludin and ZO-1 were also reduced by anandamide. These findings indicate a pro-inflammatory-like effect of anandamide on bronchial epithelial permeability, mediated by cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase metabolites, and suggest that inhibition of anandamide degradation might provide a novel approach to treat airway inflammation.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Mechanisms of these effects may include lipid peroxidation. One of the major and biologically active products of peroxidation of n-6 fatty acids, such as linoleic  or , is the aldehyde 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE). To study the hypothesis that HNE may be a critical factor in endothelial cell dysfunction caused by free fatty acids, human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVEC) were treated with up to160 microM of linoleic or . HNE formation was detected by immunocytochemistry in cells treated for 24 h with either fatty , but more markedly with . To study the cellulareffects of HNE, HUVEC were treated with different concentrations of this aldehyde, and several markers of endothelial cell dysfunction were determined. Exposure to HNE for 6 and 9 h resulted in increased cellular oxidative stress. However, short time treatment with HNE did not cause activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). In addition, HUVEC exposure to HNE caused a dose-dependent decrease in production of both interleukin-8 (IL-8) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). On the other hand, HNE exerted prominent cytotoxic effects in cultured HUVEC, manifested by morphological changes, diminished cellular viability, and impaired endothelial  . Furthermore, HNE treatment induced apoptosis of HUVEC. These data provide evidence that HNE does not contribute to NF-kappaB-related mechanisms of the inflammatory response in HUVEC, but rather to endothelial dysfunction, cytotoxicity, and apoptotic cell death.Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10492517> and leukotriene C4: role in transient cerebral ischemia of gerbils.</a></h2><p>Accumulation of  (AA) is greatest in brain regions most sensitive to transient ischemia. Free AA released after ischemia is either: 1) reincorporated into the membrane phospholipids, or 2) oxidized during reperfusion by lipoxygenases and cyclooxygenases, producing leukotrienes (LT), prostaglandins, thromboxanes and oxygen radicals. AA, its metabolite LTC4 and lipid peroxides (generated during AA metabolism) have been implicated in the blood-brain  (BBB) dysfunction, edema and neuronal death after ischemia/reperfusion. This report describes the time course of AA release, LTC4 accumulation and association with the physiological outcome during transient cerebral ischemia of gerbils. Significant amount of AA was detected immediately after 10 min ischemia (0 min reperfusion) which returned to sham levels within 30 min reperfusion. A later release of AA occurred after 1 d. LTC4 levels were elevated at 0-6 h and 1 d after ischemia. Increased lipid peroxidation due to AA metabolism was observed between 2-6 h. BBB dysfunction occurred at 6 h. Significant edema developed at 1 and 2 d after ischemia and reached maximum at 3 d. Ischemia resulted in approximately 80% neuronal death in the CA1 hippocampal region. Pretreatment with a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, AA861 resulted in significant attenuation of LTC4 levels (Baskaya et al. 1996. J. Neurosurg. 85: 112-116) and CA1 neuronal death. Accumulation of AA and LTC4, together with highly reactive oxygen radicals and lipid peroxides, may alter membrane permeability, resulting in BBB dysfunction, edema and ultimately to neuronal death.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14642279>A diacylglycerol-gated cation channel in vomeronasal neuron dendrites is impaired in TRPC2 mutant mice: mechanism of pheromone transduction.</a></h2><p>Vomeronasal sensory neurons play a crucial role in detecting pheromones, but the chemoelectrical transduction mechanism remains unclear and controversial. A major  to the resolution of this question has been the lack of an activation mechanism of a key transduction component, the TRPC2 channel. We have identified a Ca(2+)-permeable cation channel in vomeronasal neuron dendrites that is gated by the lipid messenger diacylglycerol (DAG), independently of Ca(2+) or protein kinase C. We demonstrate that ablation of the TRPC2 gene causes a severe deficit in the DAG-gated channel, indicating that TRPC2 encodes a principal subunit of this channel and that the primary electrical response to pheromones depends on DAG but not Ins(1,4,5)P(3), Ca(2+) stores, or .

Replacement of D(I-132) by its nonprotonatable analogue asparagine (DN(I-132)) has been shown to result in a reduced overall activity of the enzyme and impaired proton pumping. The results from this study show that during oxidation of the fully reduced enzyme the reaction was inhibited after formation of the oxo-ferryl (F) intermediate (tau congruent with 120 microseconds). In contrast to the wild-type enzyme, in the mutant enzyme formation of this intermediate was not associated with proton uptake from solution, which is the reason the DN(I-132) enzyme does not pump protons. The proton needed to form F was presumably taken from a protonatable group in the D-pathway (e.g., E(I-286)), which indicates that in the wild-type enzyme the proton transfer during F formation takes place in two steps: proton transfer from the group in the pathway is followed by faster reprotonation from the bulk solution, through D(I-132). Unlike the wild-type enzyme, in which F formation is coupled to internal electron transfer from CuA to heme a, in the DN(I-132) enzyme this electron transfer was uncoupled from formation of the F intermediate, which presumably is due to the impaired charge-compensating proton uptake from solution. In the presence of  which has been shown to stimulate the turnover activity of the DN(I-132) enzyme (Fetter et al. (1996) FEBS Lett. 393, 155), proton uptake with a time constant of approximately 2 ms was observed. However, no proton uptake associated with formation of F (tau congruent with 120 micros) was observed, which indicates that  can replace the role of D(I-132), but it cannot transfer protons as fast as the Asp. The results from this study show that D(I-132) is crucial for efficient transfer of protons into the enzyme and that in the DN(I-132) mutant enzyme there is a "kinetic " for proton transfer into the D-pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27473185>Dietary  as a risk factor for age-associated neurodegenerative diseases: Potential mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Alzheimer's disease and associated diseases constitute a major public health concern worldwide.

COX has two isoforms: COX-1, the constitutively expressed form, and COX-2, the inducible form. Prostaglandins are mediators of many critical physiological and inflammatory responses, but little is known about their roles during a viral infection in the central nervous system (CNS). We used non-selective inhibitors of COX, aspirin and indomethacin, and a selective antagonist of COX-2, celecoxib, to study the role of prostaglandins in Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) induced encephalitis. We found that the inhibition of COX antagonizes VSV propagation both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, aspirin and celecoxib both prevented the disruption of the blood brain  in VSV-infected mice. In vitro experiments showed that the effect of COX inhibition was at least partially mediated by increased production of Nitric Oxide (NO), a molecule known to inhibit VSV replication. When NO production was inhibited by N(omega)-nitro-L-methyl-arginine-ester (L-NAME), a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, the difference in viral titer between aspirin (or celecoxib)-treated and the control cells was abolished. VSV-infected mice treated with celecoxib expressed more NOS-1 and produced more NO in their CNS compared to the controls. Our data suggest that the product(s) of COX have antagonistic effect(s) on NO production in the mouse CNS.Copyright 2000 Academic Press.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12762838>Lipids in blood-brain  models in vitro II: Influence of glial cells on lipid classes and lipid fatty acids.</a></h2><p>Lipids of brain tissue and brain microvascular endothelial cells contain high proportions of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (long PUFAs). The blood-brain  (BBB) is formed by the brain endothelial cells under the inductive influence of brain cells, especially perivascular glia, and coculture of endothelial cells and glial cells has been used to examine this induction. The objective of this study was to investigate whether C6 glioma cells are able to influence the lipid composition and shift the fatty  (FA) patterns of the BBB model cell lines RBE4 and ECV304 toward the in vivo situation. Lipid classes of the three cell lines were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography and lipid FA patterns by high-performance liquid chromatography. Only ECV304 cells showed altered lipid composition in coculture with C6 cells. The fractions of triglycerides and cholesteryl esters (depending on the support filter) were about twice as high in coculture as when the cells were grown alone. Triglyceride fractions reached 13 to 15% of total lipids in coculture. The three cell lines showed an increase in the percentage of long PUFAs with respect to unsaturated FAs, mainly because of an increase in the percentages of , all cis-7,10,13,16-docosatetraenoic , and all cis-7,10,13,16,19-docosapentaenoic . It is concluded that glioma C6 cells are able to induce a more in vivo-like FA pattern in BBB cell culture models. However, changes were not significant for the individual PUFAs, and their levels did not reach in vivo values.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17219109>Müller cells as players in retinal degeneration and edema.</a></h2><p>Under normal conditions, Müller cells support neuronal activity and the integrity of the blood-retinal , whereas gliotic alterations of Müller cells under pathological conditions may contribute to retinal degeneration and edema formation. A major  of Müller cells is the fluid absorption from the retinal tissue, which is mediated by transcellular water transport coupled to currents through potassium channels.Alterations of retinal Müller cells under pathological conditions were investigated by immunohistochemistry and recording their behavior under osmotic stress.In animal models of various retinopathies, e.g., retinal ischemia, ocular inflammation, retinal detachment, and diabetes, it was found that Müller cells decrease the expression of their major potassium channel (Kir4.1). This alteration is associated with an impairment of the rapid water transport across Müller cell membranes, as recognizable in the induction of cellular swelling under hypoosmolar conditions. Osmotic swelling of Müller cells is also induced by oxidative stress and by inflammatory mediators such as  and prostaglandins.The data suggest that a disturbed fluid transport through Müller cells is (in addition to vascular leakage) a pathogenic factor contributing to the development of retinal edema. Pharmacological re-activation of the retinal water clearance by Müller cells may represent an approach to the development of new edema-resolving drugs. Triamcinolone acetonide, which is clinically used to resolve edema, prevents osmotic swelling of Müller cells as it induces the release of endogenous adenosine and subsequent A1 receptor activation which results in the opening of ion channels. Apparently, triamcinolone resolves edema by both inhibition of vascular leakage and stimulation of retinal fluid clearance by Müller cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25865705>Exogenous  mediates permeability of human brain microvessel endothelial cells through prostaglandin E2 activation of EP3 and EP4 receptors.</a></h2><p>The blood-brain , formed by microvessel endothelial cells, is the restrictive  between the brain parenchyma and the circulating blood.  (ARA; 5,8,11,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic ) is a conditionally essential polyunsaturated fatty  [20:4(n-6)] and is a major constituent of brain lipids. The current study examined the transport processes for ARA in confluent monolayers of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC). Addition of radioactive ARA to the apical compartment of HBMEC cultured on Transwell(®) inserts resulted in rapid incorporation of radioactivity into the basolateral medium. Knock down of fatty  transport proteins did not alter ARA passage into the basolateral medium as a result of the rapid generation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2 ), an eicosanoid known to facilitate opening of the blood-brain . Permeability following ARA or PGE2 exposure was confirmed by an increased movement of fluorescein-labeled dextran from apical to basolateral medium. ARA-mediated permeability was attenuated by specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors. EP3 and EP4 receptor antagonists attenuated the ARA-mediated permeability of HBMEC. The results indicate that ARA increases permeability of HBMEC monolayers likely via increased production of PGE2 which acts upon EP3 and EP4 receptors to mediate permeability. These observations may explain the rapid influx of ARA into the brain previously observed upon plasma infusion with ARA. The blood-brain , formed by microvessel endothelial cells, is a restrictive  between the brain parenchyma and the circulating blood. Radiolabeled  (ARA) movement across, and monolayer permeability in the presence of ARA, was examined in confluent monolayers of primary human brain microvessel endothelial cells (HBMECs) cultured on Transwell(®) plates. Incubation of HBMECs with ARA resulted in a rapid increase in HBMEC monolayer permeability. The mechanism was mediated, in part, through increased prostaglandin E2 production from ARA which acted upon EP3 and EP4 receptors to increase HBMEC monolayer permeability.© 2015 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25307222>Pharmacological significance of prostaglandin E2 and D2 transport at the brain barriers.</a></h2><p>Prostaglandin (PG) E2 and PGD2, which are biosynthesized from  generated by enzymatic cleavage of membrane phospholipid in response to various stimuli, play key roles in multiple brain pathophysiological processes, including modulation of synaptic plasticity, neuroinflammation, and sleep promotion. Concentrations of PGE2 and PGD2 in brain interstitial fluid (ISF) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are maintained at appropriate levels for normal brain  by regulatory systems. The blood-brain  (BBB) and the blood-CSF  (BCSFB) possess ISF/CSF-to-blood efflux transport systems that are the primary cerebral clearance pathways for PGE2 and PGD2. However, regulatory dysfunction at the brain barriers may seriously affect brain . In a mouse inflammation model, significant reduction of PGE2 efflux transport at the BBB has been observed. Several kinds of cephalosporin antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit the BBB- and BCSFB-mediated efflux transport of PGE2 and PGD2. Especially, drugs that inhibit multidrug resistance-associated protein 4 (MRP4)-mediated PGE2 transport are capable of reducing PGE2 efflux at the BBB. Thus, it might be important in the treatment of inflammatory and infectious diseases to use drugs that do not inhibit clearance of PGE2 at the brain barriers, in order to avoid unexpected adverse CNS effects. Further, considering that PGD2 in CSF is a natural sleep-promoting factor, changes in the activity of the PGD2 efflux transport system at the BCSFB may modify the PGD2 level in CSF, thus affecting physiological sleep. These findings indicate that the efflux transport systems at the brain barriers play key roles in the pathophysiology and pharmacology of PGE2 and PGD2.© 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Five criteria have to be fulfilled by an individual autacoid to be considered a mediator candidate of cerebral edema: i) a permeability-enhancing action under physiological conditions, ii) a vasodilatory action, iii) the ability to induce vasogenic brain edema, iv) an increase of concentration in the tissue or interstitial fluid under pathological conditions, and v) a decrease of brain edema by specific interference with the release or action of a given autacoid. Among the mediator candidates considered, bradykinin is the only one to meet all criteria. Histamine,  and free radicals including nitric oxide may also be considered mediators of brain edema, but for each of these compounds evidence is less clear than for bradykinin. Although the concept of mediators inducing brain edema is well established by experimental studies, only a bradykinin receptor antagonist has so far gained entrance into clinical evaluation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21217101>Mammalian soluble epoxide hydrolase is identical to liver hepoxilin hydrolase.</a></h2><p>Hepoxilins are lipid signaling molecules derived from  through the 12-lipoxygenase pathway. These trans-epoxy hydroxy eicosanoids play a role in a variety of physiological processes, including inflammation, neurotransmission, and formation of skin  . Mammalian hepoxilin hydrolase, partly purified from rat liver, has earlier been reported to degrade hepoxilins to trioxilins. Here, we report that hepoxilin hydrolysis in liver is mainly catalyzed by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH): i) purified mammalian sEH hydrolyses hepoxilin A₃ and B₃ with a V(max) of 0.4-2.5 μmol/mg/min; ii) the highly selective sEH inhibitors N-adamantyl-N'-cyclohexyl urea and 12-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido) dodecanoic  greatly reduced hepoxilin hydrolysis in mouse liver preparations; iii) hepoxilin hydrolase activity was abolished in liver preparations from sEH(-/-) mice; and iv) liver homogenates of sEH(-/-) mice show elevated basal levels of hepoxilins but lowered levels of trioxilins compared with wild-type animals. We conclude that sEH is identical to previously reported hepoxilin hydrolase. This is of particular physiological relevance because sEH is emerging as a novel drug target due to its major role in the hydrolysis of important lipid signaling molecules such as epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. sEH inhibitors might have undesired side effects on hepoxilin signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19660237>Effect of COX-2 inhibitor meloxicam against traumatic brain injury-induced biochemical, histopathological changes and blood-brain  permeability.</a></h2><p>The overproduction of reactive oxygen species and resultant damage to cellular proteins or lipids of cell membranes and DNA by free radicals are the underlying mechanisms of many neuropathologies. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors have been suggested to be neuroprotective by reducing prostanoid and free radical synthesis, or by directing  metabolism through alternate pathways. This study investigated the putative neuroprotective effect of the COX-2 inhibitor, meloxicam, in a rat model of diffuse brain injury.Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to traumatic brain injury with a weight-drop device using 300 g(-1) m weight-height impact. The groups were: control, meloxicam (2 mg/kg, i.p.), trauma and trauma + meloxicam (2 mg/kg, i.p.). Forty-eight hours after the injury, neurological examination scores were measured, the animals were decapitated and brain tissues were taken. Brain edema and blood-brain  (BBB) permeability were evaluated by wet-dry weight method and Evans blue (EB) extravasation respectively. In brain tissues, malonedialdehyde, glutathione, myeloperoxidase and Na/K-ATPase levels were measured.The neurological examination scores mildly increased in trauma groups 48 hours after the induction of trauma. Meloxicam treatment improved the altered neurological status. The trauma caused a significant increase in brain water content that was partially reversed by meloxicam. Meloxicam also reduced the EB extravasation indicating the preservation of the BBB integrity. Meloxicam treatment also significantly reduced the increase in malondialdehyde and myeloperoxidase levels and restored glutathione content of the brains that had been significantly increased after trauma.Meloxicam exerts neuroprotective effect by preserving BBB permeability and by reducing brain edema (probably by its anti-inflammatory properties) in the diffuse brain injury model.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30912882>[Markers of endothelial dysfunction: pathogenetic role and diagnostic significance.]</a></h2><p>Endothelial dysfunction (ED) is considered one of the pathogenetic mechanisms of a whole range of diseases. Detection of specific biochemical markers in the blood is an effective way to ED diagnostics that characterize the vascular endothelium state. This review highlights the pathogenetic role of the factors synthesized by endotheliocytes whose level changes in biological fluids reflect violations of the endothelium basic physiological properties: vasomotor , thromboresistance, angiogenesis regulation,  and adhesion functions. In particular, the participation of nitric oxide metabolites, asymmetric dimethylarginine, endothelin-1, metabolic products of , von Willebrand factor, thrombomodulin, vascular endothelial growth factor, vasohibine-1 and adhesion molecules in the onset and development of ED are reviewed. The diagnostic significances of factors damaging endothelium, such as C-reactive protein, homocysteine and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, are discussed. In addition, the literature data of recent years about the prospects of clinical implication the detection of the above-mentioned factors which indicates structural and functional endothelial cells damage are given. Particular attention is paid to the ED markers detection prognostic significance and the possibility of their practical use for the ED diagnosis. The search of literature for the current review was conducted in RSIC, CyberLeninka, Scopus, Web of Science, MedLine and PubMed databases from 2012 to 2018 using the following keywords: endothelial dysfunction, nitric oxide, asymmetric dimethylarginine, endothelin-1, prostacyclin, thromboxane A2, epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, von Willebrand factor, thrombomodulin, vascular endothelial growth factor, vasohibin-1, adhesive molecules, C-reactive protein, homocysteine, and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11159024>Prostaglandin E(2) regulates wound closure in airway epithelium.</a></h2><p>Repair of the airway epithelium after injury is critical for the maintenance of   and the limitation of airway hyperreactivity. Airway epithelial cells (AECs) metabolize  to biologically active eicosanoids via the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX). We investigated whether stimulating or inhibiting COX metabolites would affect wound closure in monolayers of cultured AECs. Inhibiting COX with indomethacin resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of wound closure in human and feline AECs. Specific inhibitors for both COX-1 and COX-2 isoforms impaired wound healing. Inhibitors of 5-lipoxygenase did not affect wound closure in these cells. The addition of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) eliminated the inhibition due to indomethacin treatment, and the exogenous application of PGE(2) stimulated wound closure in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of COX with indomethacin only at initial time points resulted in a sustained inhibition of wound closure, indicating that prostanoids are involved in early wound repair processes such as spreading and migration. These differences in wound closure may be important if  metabolism and eicosanoid concentrations are altered in disease states such as asthma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24334113>Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) from genesis to senescence: the influence of LCPUFA on neural development, aging, and neurodegeneration.</a></h2><p>Many clinical and animal studies demonstrate the importance of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) in neural development and neurodegeneration. This review will focus on involvement of LCPUFA from genesis to senescence. The LCPUFA docosahexaenoic  and  are important components of neuronal membranes, while eicosapentaenoic , docosahexaenoic , and  also affect cardiovascular health and inflammation. In neural development, LCPUFA deficiency can lead to severe disorders like schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Perinatal LCPUFA supplementation demonstrated beneficial effects in neural development in humans and rodents resulting in improved cognition and sensorimotor integration. In normal aging, the effect of LCPUFA on prevention of cognitive impairment will be discussed. LCPUFA are important for neuronal membrane integrity and , and also contribute in prevention of brain hypoperfusion. Cerebral perfusion can be compromised as result of obesity, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, or diabetes mellitus type 2. Last, we will focus on the role of LCPUFA in most common neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. These disorders are characterized by impaired cognition and connectivity and both clinical and animal supplementation studies have shown the potential of LCPUFA to decrease neurodegeneration and inflammation. This review shows that LCPUFA are essential throughout life.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The ability of CDP-choline to alter phospholipid metabolism is an important  in the treatment of ischemic injury. Exogenous treatment with CDP-choline stimulates PtdCho synthesis and prevents release of free fatty acids (FFA), especially  (AA), after ischemia/reperfusion. Phase III clinical trials of CDP-choline in the treatment of stroke are currently underway. Here we report the neuroprotection by CDP-choline in transient forebrain ischemia of gerbils. CDP-choline significantly attenuated the blood-brain  (BBB) dysfunction after ischemia with 6-hr reperfusion, and considerably reduced the increase of AA in FFA and leukotriene C(4) (LTC(4)) synthesis at 1 day. Edema was significantly elevated after 1 and 2 days, but attained maximum at 3-day reperfusion. CDP-choline substantially attenuated edema at 3 days. Ischemia resulted in 80 +/- 8% CA(1) hippocampal neuronal death after 6-day reperfusion, and CDP-choline provided 65 +/- 6% neuroprotection. CDP-choline may act by increasing PtdCho synthesis via two pathways: (1) conversion of 1, 2-diacylglycerol to PtdCho, and (2) biosynthesis of S-adenosyl-L-methionine, thus stabilizing the membrane and reducing AA release and metabolism to leukotriene C(4). This would result in decreased toxicity due to AA, leukotrienes, oxygen radicals, lipid peroxidation, and altered glutamate uptake, thus limiting BBB dysfunction, edema and providing neuroprotection.Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10383730>Basal transepidermal water loss is increased in platelet-type 12-lipoxygenase deficient mice.</a></h2><p>The roles of fatty acids in the skin have been under investigation since early reports of the phenotypic abnormalities of mice fed a diet deficient in essential fatty acids. Little is known about the functional significance of fatty  metabolism by lipoxygenases in epidermis. Here, we have examined the role of platelet-type 12-lipoxygenase which converts  to the oxygenated metabolite 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic , in the skin using platelet-type 12-lipoxygenase-deficient mice generated by gene targeting. Platelet-type 12-lipoxygenase in wild-type mice was localized to the stratum granulosum by immunohistochemical analysis. Platelet-type 12-lipoxygenase-deficient mice lacked immunodetectable platelet-type 12-lipoxygenase in platelets and epidermis, appeared grossly normal, and exhibited an increase in basal transepidermal water loss without alteration in basal mitotic activity. Water loss and mitotic activity in mice with an acetone-disrupted membrane  were normal. No defect in ultrastructural properties or content of major fatty acids in dorsal skin or ear inflammation response was apparent in platelet-type 12-lipoxygenase-deficient mice. These results indicate that the platelet-type 12-lipoxygenase pathway in mice is partly responsible for normal permeability   but the mechanism awaits further elucidation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27062905>Biochemical and biophysical methodologies open the road for effective schistosomiasis therapy and vaccination.</a></h2><p>Schistosomiasis caused by blood-dwelling flukes, namely Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma haematobium is a severe debilitating disease, widespread in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and South America. Developing and adult worms are unscathed by the surrounding immune effectors and antibodies because the parasite is protected by a double lipid bilayer armor which allows access of nutrients, while binding of specific antibodies is denied.Fluorescence recovery after bleaching, extraction of surface membrane cholesterol by methyl-β-cyclodextrin, inhibition and activation of sphingomyelin biosynthesis and hydrolysis, and elastic incoherent and quasi-elastic neutron scattering approaches have helped to clarify the basic mechanism of this immune evasion, and showed that sphingomyelin (SM) molecules in the worm apical lipid bilayer form with surrounding water molecules a tight hydrogen bond . Viability of the parasite and permeability of the outer shield are controlled by equilibrium between SM biosynthesis and activity of a tegument-associated neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase).Excessive nSMase activation by polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), such as  (ARA) leads to disruption of the SM molecules and associated hydrogen bond network, with subsequent access of host antibodies and immune effectors to the outer membrane and eventual parasite death.ARA was predicted and shown to be a potent schistosomicide in vitro and in vivo in experimental animals and in children. Additionally, it was advocated that schistosomiasis vaccine candidates should be selected uniquely among excretory-secretory products of developing worms, as contrary to cytosolic and surface membrane antigens, they are able to activate the effector functions of the host antibodies and toxic molecules.

Previously, we have shown that 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (15(S)-HETE), the major 15-lipoxygenase 1 (15-LO1) metabolite of , by stimulating zona occludens (ZO)-2 tyrosine phosphorylation and its dissociation from claudins 1/5, induces endothelial TJ disruption and its  dysfunction. Here, we have studied the role of serine/threonine phosphorylation of TJ proteins in 15(S)-HETE-induced endothelial TJ disruption and its  dysfunction. We found that 15(S)-HETE enhances ZO-1 phosphorylation at Thr-770/772 residues via PKCε-mediated MEK1-ERK1/2 activation, causing ZO-1 dissociation from occludin, disrupting endothelial TJs and its  , and promoting monocyte transmigration; these effects were reversed by T770A/T772A mutations. In the arteries of WT mice ex vivo, 15(S)-HETE also induced ZO-1 phosphorylation and endothelial TJ disruption in a PKCε and MEK1-ERK1/2-dependent manner. In line with these observations, in WT mice high fat diet feeding induced 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LO) expression in the endothelium and caused disruption of its TJs and  . However, in 12/15-LO(-/-) mice, high fat diet feeding did not cause disruption of endothelial TJs and  .

In awake rats, recycling of fatty acids within brain phospholipids, due to deesterification and reesterification, is very rapid, with half-lives in some cases of minutes to hours. Plasma fatty acids make only a small contribution (2-4%) to the net quantity of fatty acids that are reesterified. This explains why many weeks are necessary to recover normal brain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  concentrations following their prolonged dietary deprivation. Changes in recycling of specific fatty acids in response to centrally acting drugs can help to identify enzyme targets for drug action. For example, recycling of arachidonate is specifically reduced by 80% in rats treated chronically with lithium, a drug effective against bipolar disorder; the effect reflects downregulation of gene expression of an arachidonate-specific phospholipase A2. When combined with neuroimaging (quantitative autoradiography in rodents or positron-emission tomography [PET] in macaques or humans), intravenously injected radiolabeled fatty acids can be used to localize and quantify brain PLA2-mediated signal transduction, and to examine neuroplastic remodeling of brain lipid membranes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15321029>Efficacy of low concentrations of ketorolac tromethamine in animal models of ocular inflammation.</a></h2><p>To determine if topical ophthalmic application of ketorolac tromethamine concentrations below 0.5% can block the biochemical and physiological processes associated with chemically induced ocular inflammation in rabbits.Ocular inflammation was induced in rabbits by intravenous (i.v.) injection of endotoxin (2.5 microg/kg) isolated from Salmonella typhimurium, or by a topical application of  (1.0%). The effect of ketorolac (at concentrations ranging from 0.001%-0.5%) on ocular inflammation was determined by measuring changes in the blood-aqueous , using fluorophotometry (dextran-isothiocyanate-fluorescein; FITC-dextran 2%) and by measuring changes in aqueous humor protein concentrations.

Although cyclooxygenase (COX) expression has been reported in human cerebral ischemia, no information is available on the expression of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) and its topographical correlation to COX induction. The objective of this study was to elucidate the comparative distribution of eicosanoids in ischemic tissues. COX and 5- LO, key enzymes for the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, respectively, were examined in autopsied brains. COX1 was expressed intensely in the microglia but weakly in the neurons in control brains. These COX1-immunoreactive microglia showed a more activated form following ischemic damage and hypoxemia. In contrast, COX2 was absent in the control brains, and was induced robustly in the neuronal cell bodies and dendrites during the acute stages of focal ischemic damage, and then subsided at the subacute stages. These COX2-immunoreactive neurons accumulated in the peri-infarct regions, but were absent from the distant regions. In focal ischemic damage and Binswanger's disease, COX2 was up-regulated in the microglia. Neuronal immunostaining for 5-LO was up-regulated occasionally during hypoxemia and focal ischemic damage. Glial cells immunoreactive for 5-LO appeared in the foci of the ischemic damage, with small blood vessels being infiltrated by 5-LO-immunoreactive mononuclear leukocytes. These findings indicate that the isozymes of COX are differentially regulated depending on the cellular source and the types of ischemic damage, and that vascular 5-LO may accelerate the migration of leukocytes and augment the blood-brain  permeability. The possibility of increased substrate availability for the other should be noticed in specific inhibition of either COX or 5-LO since these two enzymes are accumulated in parallel in ischemic tissues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11484067>Multilateral in vivo and in vitro protective effects of the novel heat shock protein coinducer, bimoclomol: results of preclinical studies.</a></h2><p>Bimoclomol, the recently developed non-toxic heat shock protein (HSP) coinducer, was shown to display multilateral protective activities against various forms of stress or injuries at the level of the cell, tissue or organism. The compound enhanced the transcription, translation and expression of the 70 kD heat shock protein (HSP-70) in myogenic and HeLa cell lines exposed to heat stress, and increased cell survival on exposure to otherwise lethal thermal injury. Bimoclomol increased contractility of the working mammalian heart, this effect was associated with the increased intracellular calcium transients due to increased probability of opening of ryanodine receptors in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). In healthy tissues these cardiac effects were evident only at relatively high concentrations of the drug, while in the ischemic myocardium bimoclomol exerted significant cardioprotective and antiarrhythmic effects at submicromolar concentrations. It decreased ischemia-induced reduction of contractility and of cardiac output, and dramatically decreased the elevation of the ST-segment during ischemia as well as the occurrence of ventricular fibrillation upon reperfusion. Bimoclomol was also active in various pathological animal models subjected to acute or chronic stress. In the spontaneously hypertensive rats chronic pretreatment with bimoclomol restored sensitivity of aortic rings to acetylcholine; this effect was accompanied by accumulation of HSP-70 in the tissues. Bimoclomol pretreatment significantly diminished the consequences of vascular disorders associated with diabetes mellitus. Diabetic neuropathy, retinopathy, and nephropathy were prevented or diminished, while wound healing was enhanced by bimoclomol. Enhancement of wound healing by bimoclomol was observed after thermal injury as well as following ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. In addition to the beneficial effects on peripheral angiopathies, bimoclomol antagonized the increase in permeability of blood-brain  induced by subarachnoid hemorrhager or . A general and very important feature of the above effects of bimoclomol was that the drug failed to cause alterations under physiological conditions (except the enhanced calcium release from cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum). Bimoclomol was effective only under conditions of stress. Consistent with its HSP-coinducer property, bimoclomol alone had very little effect on HSP production. Its protective activity became apparent only in the presence of cell damage. Currently, bimoclomol reached the end of the Phase II clinical trial in a group of 410 patients with diabetic complications. Results of this trial will answer the question, whether a compound with promising in vitro and in vivo preclinical findings will produce the anticipated beneficial effects in humans. In the event of a positive outcome of this trial, the indications for bimoclomol will be substantially extended.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23453388>Effect of eicosapentaenoic -derived prostaglandin E3 on intestinal epithelial  .</a></h2><p>Prostaglandins (PG) are inflammatory mediators derived from  or eicosapentaenoic  giving rise to the 2-series or the 3-series prostanoids, respectively.

The enzyme is capable of binding phospholipids at its active site and physically interacts with model membranes. However, its membrane oxygenase activity has not been quantified. To address this question, we overexpressed PA-LOX as intracellular his-tag fusion protein in Escherichia coli, purified it to electrophoretic homogeneity and compared its biomembrane oxygenase activity with that of rabbit ALOX15. We found that both enzymes were capable of oxygenating mitochondrial membranes to specific oxygenation products and 13S-H(p)ODE and 15S-H(p)ETE esterified to phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine were identified as major oxygenation products. When normalized to similar linoleic  oxygenase activity, the rabbit enzyme exhibited a much more effective mitochondrial membrane oxygenase activity. In contrast, during long-term incubations (24 h) with red blood cells PA-LOX induced significant (50%) hemolysis whereas rabbit ALOX15 was more or less ineffective. These data indicate the principle capability of PA-LOX of oxygenating membrane bound phospholipids which is likely to alter the   of the biomembranes.

Thus, understanding and blocking intravasation may attenuate the metastatic cascade at an early step. As a trigger factor, which causes the retraction of lymph endothelial cells (LECs) and opens entry ports for tumour cell intravasation, MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells secrete the pro-metastatic  metabolite, 12S-hydroxy-5Z,8Z,10E,14Z-eicosatetraenoic  [12(S)-HETE].

Thus, whether they have a role in LEC retraction was determined using a validated intravasation assay, small interfering RNA mediated knockdown of gene expression, and mRNA and protein expression analyses. Specific inhibition of SOX18 or PROX1 significantly attenuated in vitro intravasation of MDA-MB231 spheroids through the LEC  and 12(S)-HETE-triggered signals were transduced by the high and low affinity receptors, 12(S)-HETE receptor and leukotriene B4 receptor 2.

P-GP activity was determined by measuring intracellular calcein accumulation and P-GP expression by Western blotting. The effect of PUFAs on membrane fluidity was assessed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP).Dexamethasone, HC and IL-1β significantly increased P-GP expression and activity. The effect of IL-1β was attenuated by the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA). This is the first report of the combined actions of IL-1β and IL-1RA on P-GP expression and the first evidence of glucocorticoid-mediated P-GP up-regulation in PBECs.  (AA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and eicosapentenoic  (EPA) significantly decreased P-GP activity without affecting expression or membrane fluidity. AA, DHA and EPA counteracted IL-1β-mediated increases in P-GP activity, while AA and EPA, but not DHA, counteracted glucocorticoid-mediated increase in P-GP activity.While glucocorticoids and IL-1β possess opposing actions in inflammation, they demonstrate functional consistency by increasing P-GP expression and activity in PBECs.© 2018 Royal Pharmaceutical Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25166905>Endocannabinoid degradation inhibition improves neurobehavioral , blood-brain  integrity, and neuroinflammation following mild traumatic brain injury.</a></h2><p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an increasingly frequent and poorly understood condition lacking effective therapeutic strategies. Inflammation and oxidative stress (OS) are critical components of injury, and targeted interventions to reduce their contribution to injury should improve neurobehavioral recovery and outcomes. Recent evidence reveals potential protective, yet short-lived, effects of the endocannabinoids (ECs), 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) and N-arachidonoyl-ethanolamine (AEA), on neuroinflammatory and OS processes after TBI. The aim of this study was to determine whether EC degradation inhibition after TBI would improve neurobehavioral recovery by reducing inflammatory and oxidative damage. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a 5-mm left lateral craniotomy, and TBI was induced by lateral fluid percussion. TBI produced apnea (17±5 sec) and a delayed righting reflex (479±21 sec). Thirty minutes post-TBI, rats were randomized to receive intraperitoneal injections of vehicle (alcohol, emulphor, and saline; 1:1:18) or a selective inhibitor of 2-AG (JZL184, 16 mg/kg) or AEA (URB597, 0.3 mg/kg) degradation. At 24 h post-TBI, animals showed significant neurological and -behavioral impairment as well as disruption of blood-brain  (BBB) integrity. Improved neurological and -behavioral  was observed in JZL184-treated animals. BBB integrity was protected in both JZL184- and URB597-treated animals. No significant differences in ipsilateral cortex messenger RNA expression of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2, tumor necrosis factor alpha, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NOX2) and protein expression of COX2 or NOX2 were observed across experimental groups. Astrocyte and microglia activation was significantly increased post-TBI, and treatment with JZL184 or URB597 blocked activation of both cell types. These findings suggest that EC degradation inhibition post-TBI exerts neuroprotective effects. Whether repeated dosing would achieve greater protection remains to be examined.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30186272>Butyrate Protects Mice Against Methionine-Choline-Deficient Diet-Induced Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis by Improving Gut  , Attenuating Inflammation and Reducing Endotoxin Levels.</a></h2><p>Butyrate exerts protective effects against non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We aimed to investigate the role of butyrate-induced gut microbiota and metabolism in NASH development. Sixty-five C57BL/6J mice were divided into four groups ( = 15-17 per group) and were fed either a methionine-choline-sufficient (MCS) diet or methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet with or without sodium butyrate (SoB; 0.6 g/kg body weight) supplementation for 6 weeks. Liver injury, systematic inflammation, and gut   were determined. Fecal microbiome and metabolome were analyzed using 16S rRNA deep sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed that butyrate alleviated the MCD diet-induced microbiome dysbiosis, as evidenced by a significantly clustered configuration separate from that of the MCD group and by the depletion of  and  and enrichment of promising probiotic genera , , , , , , and  genera. The fecal metabolomic profile was also substantially improved by butyrate; several butyrate-responsive metabolites involved in lipid metabolism and other pathways, such as stearic , behenic , oleic , linoleic , squalene, and , were identified. Correlation analysis of the interaction matrix indicated that the modified gut microbiota and fecal metabolites induced by butyrate were strongly correlated with the alleviation of hepatic injury, fibrosis progression, inflammation, and lipid metabolism and intestinal  dysfunction. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that butyrate exerts protective effects against NASH development, and these effects may be driven by the protective gut microbiome and metabolome induced by butyrate. This study thus provides new insights into NASH prevention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16142916>Lipid sulfates and sulfonates are allosteric competitive inhibitors of the N-terminal phosphatase activity of the mammalian soluble epoxide hydrolase.</a></h2><p>The EPXH2 gene encodes for the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), a homodimeric enzyme with each monomer containing two domains with distinct activities. The C-terminal domain, containing the epoxide hydrolase activity (Cterm-EH), is involved in the metabolism of  epoxides, endogenous chemical mediators that play important roles in blood pressure regulation, cell growth, and inflammation. We recently demonstrated that the N-terminal domain contains a Mg2+-dependent lipid phosphate phosphatase activity (Nterm-phos). However, the biological role of this activity is unknown. The inability of known phosphatase inhibitors to inhibit the Nterm-phos constitutes a significant  to the elucidation of its . We describe herein sulfate, sulfonate, and phosphonate lipids as novel potent inhibitors of Nterm-phos. These compounds are allosteric competitive inhibitors with K(I) in the hundred nanomolar range. These inhibitors may provide a valuable tool to investigate the biological role of the Nterm-phos. We found that polyisoprenyl phosphates are substrates of Nterm-phos, suggesting a possible role in sterol synthesis or inflammation. Furthermore, some of these compounds inhibit the C-terminal sEH activity through a noncompetitive inhibition mechanism involving a new binding site on the C-terminal domain. This novel site may play a role in the natural in vivo regulation of epoxide hydrolysis by sEH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17507602>Role of endogenous CYP450 metabolites of  in maintaining the glomerular protein permeability .</a></h2><p>This study examined the metabolism of  (AA) by cytochrome P-450 enzymes in isolated glomeruli and the effects of selective inhibitors of the synthesis of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (20-HETE) and epoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (EETs) on glomerular permeability to albumin (P(alb)). Glomeruli avidly produced 20-HETE, EETs, dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (diHETEs), and HETEs when incubated with exogenous AA. N-hydroxy-N'-(4-butyl-2-methylphenyl)formamidine (HET0016; 10 microM) selectively inhibited the formation of 20-HETE by 95% and increased P(alb) from 0.00 +/- 0.08 to 0.73 +/- 0.10 (n = 43 glomeruli, 4 rats). Addition of a 20-HETE mimetic, 20-hydroxyeicosa-5(Z),14(Z)-dienoic  (20-5,14-HEDE; 1 microM) opposed the effects of HET0016 (10 microM) to increase P(alb) (0.21 +/- 0.10, n = 36 glomeruli, 4 rats). Preincubation of glomeruli with exogenous AA to increase basal production of 20-HETE had a similar effect. We also examined the effect of an epoxygenase inhibitor, N-methylsulfonyl-6-(2-propargyloxyphenyl)hexanamide (MSPPOH; 5 microM), on P(alb). MSPPOH (5 microM) significantly increased P(alb) but had no effect on the synthesis of EETs in glomeruli incubated with AA. However, MSPPOH (5 microM) selectively reduced epoxygenase activity by 50% in glomeruli incubated without added AA. Pretreatment with 8,9-EET (100 nM) attenuated the effects of MSPPOH (5 microM) on P(alb). These results indicate that glomeruli produce 20-HETE, EETs, diHETEs, and HETEs and that endogenously formed 20-HETE and EETs play an essential role in the maintenance of the glomerular permeability  to albumin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16951496>Regulated spatial distribution of cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases in Crohn's ulcer.</a></h2><p> metabolism actively participates in the initiation, climaxing, and resolution phases of inflammation, and its close connection with inflammatory bowel diseases has been only recently discovered. We aimed to clarify the role of different  pathways and the interrelationships between them in Crohn's disease.Seventeen specimens of Crohn's disease dated between 2003/1/1 and 2005/1/1 were collected and underwent immunohistochemical analyses with cylcooxygenase 1, cyclooxygenase 2, 5-lipoxygenase, and 15-lipoxygenase-1 antibodies.(1) The spatial distribution of the three leading enzymes in  pathway--cyclooxygenase 2, 5-lipoxygenase, and 15-lipoxygenase-1--followed sequential arrangement in Crohn's ulcer: neutrophils highly expressing 5-lipoxygenase were in the utmost surface which bordered the band of cyclooxygenase-2 expression that is located just beneath it, and in the lower layers and below the granulation region were eosinophils carrying 15-lipoxygeanse-1. (2) Cyclooxygenase-2 and 15-Lipoxygenase-1-positive cells formed two -like structures that possibly inhibited neutrophil infiltration.The regulated distribution indicated coordinated interplay between inflammatory cells and parenchymal cells, between  pathways, and between innate and adaptive immunity; and the -like structures indicated protective roles for cyclooxygenase 2 and 15-Lipoxygenase-1 in Crohn's disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26844268>White Matter Lipids as a Ketogenic Fuel Supply in Aging Female Brain: Implications for Alzheimer's Disease.</a></h2><p>White matter degeneration is a pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's. Age remains the greatest risk factor for Alzheimer's and the prevalence of age-related late onset Alzheimer's is greatest in females. We investigated mechanisms underlying white matter degeneration in an animal model consistent with the sex at greatest Alzheimer's risk. Results of these analyses demonstrated decline in mitochondrial respiration, increased mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide production and cytosolic-phospholipase-A2 sphingomyelinase pathway activation during female brain aging. Electron microscopic and lipidomic analyses confirmed myelin degeneration. An increase in fatty acids and mitochondrial fatty  metabolism machinery was coincident with a rise in brain ketone bodies and decline in plasma ketone bodies. This mechanistic pathway and its chronologically phased activation, links mitochondrial dysfunction early in aging with later age development of white matter degeneration. The catabolism of myelin lipids to generate ketone bodies can be viewed as a systems level adaptive response to address brain fuel and energy demand. Elucidation of the initiating factors and the mechanistic pathway leading to white matter catabolism in the aging female brain provides potential therapeutic targets to prevent and treat demyelinating diseases such as Alzheimer's and multiple sclerosis.

We identified herein a synthetic fatty , 9E,11Z,14Z-20:3ω6, that was oxygenated by eLOX3 specifically to the 9S-hydroperoxide. Reaction showed a pronounced lag phase, which suggested that eLOX3 is deficient in its activation step. Indeed, we found that high concentrations of hydroperoxide activator (e.g. 65 μM) overcame a prolonged lag phase (>1 h) and unveiled a dioxygenase activity with ; the main products were the 5-, 9-, and 7-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HPETEs). These were R/S mixtures (ranging from ∼50:50 to 73:27), and as the bis-allylic 7-HPETE can be formed only inside the enzyme active site, the results indicate there is oxygen availability along either face of the reacting fatty  radical. That the active site oxygen supply is limited is implied from the need for continuous re-activation, as carbon radical leakage leaves the enzyme in the unactivated ferrous state. An Ala-to-Gly mutation, known to affect the positioning of O(2) in the active site of other lipoxygenase enzymes, led to more readily activated reaction and a significant increase in the 9R- over the 5-HPETE. Activation and cycling of the ferric enzyme are thus promoted using the 9E,11Z,14Z-20:3ω6 substrate, by continuous hydroperoxide activation, or by the Ala-to-Gly mutation. We suggest that eLOX3 represents one end of a spectrum among lipoxygenases where activation is inefficient, favoring hydroperoxide isomerase cycling, with the opposite end represented by readily activated enzymes in which dioxygenase activity is prominent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23589307>12/15-Lipoxygenase mediates high-fat diet-induced endothelial tight junction disruption and monocyte transmigration: a new role for 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  in endothelial cell dysfunction.</a></h2><p>A convincing body of evidence suggests that 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LO) plays a role in atherosclerosis. However, the mechanisms of its involvement in the pathogenesis of this disease are not clear. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to understand the mechanisms by which 12/15-LO mediates endothelial dysfunction. 15(S)-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (15(S)-HETE), the major 12/15-LO metabolite of  (AA), induced endothelial  permeability via Src and Pyk2-dependent zonula occluden (ZO)-2 tyrosine phosphorylation and its dissociation from the tight junction complexes. 15(S)-HETE also stimulated macrophage adhesion to the endothelial monolayer in Src and Pyk2-dependent manner. Ex vivo studies revealed that exposure of arteries from WT mice to AA or 15(S)-HETE led to Src-Pyk2-dependent ZO-2 tyrosine phosphorylation, tight junction disruption, and macrophage adhesion, whereas the arteries from 12/15-LO knock-out mice are protected from these effects of AA. Feeding WT mice with a high-fat diet induced the expression of 12/15-LO in the arteries leading to tight junction disruption and macrophage adhesion and deletion of the 12/15-LO gene disallowed these effects. Thus, the findings of this study provide the first evidence of the role of 12/15-LO and its AA metabolite, 15(S)-HETE, in high-fat diet-induced endothelial tight junction disruption and macrophage adhesion, the crucial events underlying the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28351645>Targeting of 12/15-Lipoxygenase in retinal endothelial cells, but not in monocytes/macrophages, attenuates high glucose-induced retinal leukostasis.</a></h2><p>Our previous studies have established a role for 12/15-lipoxygenase (LO) in mediating the inflammatory response in diabetic retinopathy (DR). However, the extent at which the local or systemic induction of 12/15-LO activity involved is unclear. Thus, the current study aimed to characterize the relative contribution of retinal endothelial versus monocytic/macrophagic 12/15-LO to inflammatory responses in DR.We first generated a clustered heat map for circulating bioactive lipid metabolites in the plasma of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice using liquid chromatography coupled with mass-spectrometry (LC-MS) to evaluate changes in circulating 12/15-LO activity. This was followed by comparing the in vitro mouse endothelium-leukocytes interaction between leukocytes isolated from 12/15-LO knockout (KO) versus those isolated from wild type (WT) mice using the myeloperoxidase (MPO) assay. Finally, we examined the effects of knocking down or inhibiting endothelial 12/15-LO on diabetes-induced endothelial cell activation and ICAM-1 expression.Analysis of plasma bioactive lipids' heat map revealed that the activity of circulating 12/15-LO was not altered by diabetes as evident by no significant changes in the plasma levels of major metabolites derived from 12/15-lipoxygenation of different PUFAs, including linoleic  (13-HODE),  (12- and 15- HETEs), eicosapentaenoic  (12- and 15- HEPEs), or docosahexaenoic  (17-HDoHE). Moreover, leukocytes from 12/15-LO KO mice displayed a similar increase in adhesion to high glucose (HG)-activated endothelial cells as do leukocytes from WT mice. Furthermore, abundant proteins of 12-LO and 15-LO were detected in human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs), while it was undetected (15-LO) or hardly detectable (12-LO) in human monocyte-like U937 cells. Inhibition or knock down of endothelial 12/15-LO in HRECs blocked HG-induced expression of ICAM-1, a well-known identified important molecule for leukocyte adhesion in DR.Our data support that endothelial, rather than monocytic/macrophagic, 12/15-LO has a critical role in hyperglycemia-induced ICAM-1 expression, leukocyte adhesion, and subsequent local retinal  dysfunction.

Correctly regulated hemodynamics and delivery of oxygen and metabolic substrates, as well as intact blood-retinal barriers are necessary requirements for the maintenance of retinal structure and . Retinal blood flow is autoregulated by the interaction of myogenic and metabolic mechanisms through the release of vasoactive substances by the vascular endothelium and retinal tissue surrounding the arteriolar wall. Autoregulation is achieved by adaptation of the vascular tone of the resistance vessels (arterioles, capillaries) to changes in the perfusion pressure or metabolic needs of the tissue. This adaptation occurs through the interaction of multiple mechanisms affecting the arteriolar smooth muscle cells and capillary pericytes. Mechanical stretch and increases in arteriolar transmural pressure induce the endothelial cells to release contracting factors affecting the tone of arteriolar smooth muscle cells and pericytes. Close interaction between nitric oxide (NO), lactate,  metabolites, released by the neuronal and glial cells during neural activity and energy-generating reactions of the retina strive to optimize blood flow according to the metabolic needs of the tissue. NO, which plays a central role in neurovascular coupling, may exert its effect, by modulating glial cell  involved in such vasomotor responses. During the evolution of ischemic microangiopathies, impairment of structure and  of the retinal neural tissue and endothelium affect the interaction of these metabolic pathways, leading to a disturbed blood flow regulation. The resulting ischemia, tissue hypoxia and alterations in the blood  trigger the formation of macular edema and neovascularization. Hypoxia-related VEGF expression correlates with the formation of neovessels. The relief from hypoxia results in arteriolar constriction, decreases the hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries and venules, and relieves endothelial stretching. The reestablished oxygenation of the inner retina downregulates VEGF expression and thus inhibits neovascularization and macular edema. Correct control of the multiple pathways, such as retinal blood flow, tissue oxygenation and metabolic substrate support, aiming at restoring retinal cell metabolic interactions, may be effective in preventing damage occurring during the evolution of ischemic microangiopathies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15548432>Human brain endothelium: coexpression and  of vanilloid and endocannabinoid receptors.</a></h2><p>The  derivative, 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG), was initially isolated from gut and brain; it is also produced and released from blood and vascular cells. Many of the 2-AG-induced cellular responses (i.e., neuromodulation, cytoprotection and vasodilation) are mediated by cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2. The findings presented here demonstrate the expression of CB1, CB2 and TRPV1 receptors on cerebromicrovascular endothelial cells (HBEC). The expression of TRPV1, CB1 and CB2 receptor mRNA and proteins were demonstrated by RT-PCR and polyclonal antibodies, respectively. The endocannabinoid 2-AG, and other related compounds [anandamide (ANA), methanandamide (m-ANA), N-(4-hydroxyphenyl-arachidonyl-ethanolamide) (AM404) and capsaicin] dose-dependently stimulated Ca2+ influx in HBEC. The selective TRPV1 receptor antagonist (capsazepine), CB1 receptor antagonist (SR141716A) and CB2 receptor antagonist (SR144528) inhibited these responses. The effects of capsaicin, a specific agonist for TRPV1 receptors, were inhibited by capsazepine, but only weakly by CB1 or CB2 receptor antagonists. 2-AG also induced phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP); this response was mediated by VR1 receptors. These studies clearly indicate that 2-AG and other related compounds may  as agonists on VR1 receptors, as well as CB1 and CB2 receptors, and implicated these factors in various HBEC functions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16140905>(n-3) polyunsaturated fatty  deficiency reduces the expression of both isoforms of the brain glucose transporter GLUT1 in rats.</a></h2><p>The altered neuron activity of rats deficient in (n-3) PUFAs may be due in part to a decrease in brain glucose utilization and glucose transport. We measured the glucose transporter protein GLUT1 isoforms at the blood-brain  (55-kDa) and in astrocytes (45-kDa) by Western immunoblotting and their mRNA by real time RT-PCR analysis in the cerebral cortex of adult male rats fed diets lacking (n-3) fatty acids (1st generation). The neuron glucose transporter GLUT3 was also assayed. The fatty acids in the phosphatidylcholine (PC), ethanolamine phosphoglycerolipid (EPG), and phosphatidylserine (PS) fractions of isolated microvessels and homogenates of the cerebral cortex were determined. The levels of (n-6) PUFAs [mainly , 20:4(n-6)] in the phospholipid fractions of microvessels were higher and the levels of (n-3) PUFAs [mainly docosahexaenoic , 22:6(n-3)] were lower than in cerebral cortex homogenates. The microvessels and cortex of rats fed the (n-3) PUFA-deficient diet had 50% of the control 22:6(n-3) contents; 22:6(n-3) was replaced by 22:5(n-6). The 55-kDa GLUT1 immunoreactivity in (n-3) PUFA-deficient microvessels was decreased (down 25%, P < 0.01), as was the 45 kDa-GLUT1 in the homogenate (down 30%, P < 0.01). But the amount of immunoreactivity of GLUT3 did not change. The amount of GLUT1 mRNA was not affected by the (n-3) PUFA-deficient diet. These results suggest that the decreased glucose utilization in the cerebral cortex of (n-3) PUFA-deficient rats is due to reduced amounts of the 2 isoforms of GLUT1, indicating post-transcriptional regulation of GLUT1 synthesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11843182>Polyphenols of cocoa: inhibition of mammalian 15-lipoxygenase.</a></h2><p>Some cocoas and chocolates are rich in (-)-epicatechin and its related oligomers, the procyanidins. Fractions of these compounds, isolated from the seeds of Theobroma cacao, caused dose-dependent inhibition of isolated rabbit 15-lipoxygenase-1 with the larger oligomers being more active; the decamer fraction revealed an IC50 of 0.8 microM. Among the monomeric flavanols, epigallocatechin gallate (IC50 = 4 microM) and epicatechin gallate (5 microM) were more potent than (-)-epicatechin (IC50 = 60 microM). (-)-Epicatechin and procyanidin nonamer also inhibited the formation of 15-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic  from  in rabbit smooth muscle cells transfected with human 15-lipoxygenase-1. In contrast, inhibition of the lipoxygenase pathway in J774A.1 cells transfected with porcine leukocyte-type 12-lipoxygenase (another representative of the 12/15-lipoxygenase family) was only observed upon sonication of the cells, suggesting a membrane  for flavanols in these cells. Moreover, epicatechin (IC50 approx. 15 microM) and the procyanidin decamer inhibited recombinant human platelet 12-lipoxygenase. These observations suggest general lipoxygenase-inhibitory potency of flavanols and procyanidins that may contribute to their putative beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system in man. Thus, they may provide a plausible explanation for recent literature reports indicating that procyanidins decrease the leukotriene/prostacyclin ratio in humans and human aortic endothelial cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24687644>18β-glycyrrhetinic  attenuates anandamide-induced adiposity and high-fat diet induced obesity.</a></h2><p>Previous reports suggest that licorice extract has various metabolically beneficial effects and may help to alleviate adiposity and hyperlipidemia. However, underlying anti-obesity mechanisms still remain elusive. Moreover, it is unknown which single ingredient in licorice extract would mediate such effects. We aimed to demonstrate that licorice extract and its active ingredients can inhibit adipocyte differentiation and fat accumulation.18β-glycyrrhetinic  (18β-GA) alleviated the effects of CB1R agonist, anandamide (AEA) on CB1R signaling in a concentration-dependent manner. Consistently, 18β-GA suppressed AEA-induced adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells through the downregulation of AEA-induced MAPK activation and expression of adipogenic genes including C/EBP-α and PPAR-γ. The protein levels of fatty  synthase and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 were also decreased and the phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase was increased in 18β-GA pretreated cells. The supplementation of 18β-GA significantly lowered body weight, fat weight, and plasma lipids levels in obese animal models.These results may provide a novel insight into the molecular mechanism involved in anti-adipogenic and anti-obesity effects of 18β-GA by suppressing the activation of CB1R induced by AEA. Thus, 18β-GA may exert beneficial effects against obesity-related metabolic disorders.© 2014 The Authors. Molecular Nutrition & Food Research published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We have previously shown that activation of protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1) and PAR-2 on the surface of human coronary artery endothelial cells by tryptase or thrombin increases group VIA phospholipase A(2) (iPLA(2)β) activity and results in production of multiple phospholipid-derived inflammatory metabolites. We isolated cardiac endothelial cells from hearts of iPLA(2)β-knockout (iPLA(2)β-KO) and wild-type (WT) mice and measured  (AA), prostaglandin I(2) (PGI(2)), and platelet-activating factor (PAF) production in response to PAR stimulation. Thrombin (0.1 IU/ml) or tryptase (20 ng/ml) stimulation of WT endothelial cells rapidly increased AA and PGI(2) release and increased PAF production. Selective inhibition of iPLA(2)β with (S)-bromoenol lactone (5 μM, 10 min) completely inhibited thrombin- and tryptase-stimulated responses. Thrombin or tryptase stimulation of iPLA(2)β-KO endothelial cells did not result in significant PAF production and inhibited AA and PGI(2) release. Stimulation of cardiac endothelial cells from group VIB (iPLA(2)γ)-KO mice increased PAF production to levels similar to those of WT cells but significantly attenuated PGI(2) release. These results indicate that cardiac endothelial cell PAF production is dependent on iPLA(2)β activation and that both iPLA(2)β and iPLA(2)γ may be involved in PGI(2) release.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27708579>Pharmacogenomics of Prostaglandin and Leukotriene Receptors.</a></h2><p>Individual genetic background together with environmental effects are thought to be behind many human complex diseases. A number of genetic variants, mainly single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have been shown to be associated with various pathological and inflammatory conditions, representing potential therapeutic targets. Prostaglandins (PTGs) and leukotrienes (LTs) are eicosanoids derived from  and related polyunsaturated fatty acids that participate in both normal homeostasis and inflammatory conditions. These bioactive lipid mediators are synthesized through two major multistep enzymatic pathways: PTGs by cyclooxygenase and LTs by 5-lipoxygenase. The main physiological effects of PTGs include vasodilation and vascular leakage (PTGE2); mast cell maturation, eosinophil recruitment, and allergic responses (PTGD2); vascular and respiratory smooth muscle contraction (PTGF2), and inhibition of platelet aggregation (PTGI2). LTB4 is mainly involved in neutrophil recruitment, vascular leakage, and epithelial  , whereas cysteinyl LTs (CysLTs) (LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4) induce bronchoconstriction and neutrophil extravasation, and also participate in vascular leakage. PTGs and LTs exert their biological functions by binding to cognate receptors, which belong to the seven transmembrane, G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. SNPs in genes encoding these receptors may influence their functionality and have a role in disease susceptibility and drug treatment response. In this review we summarize SNPs in PTGs and LTs receptors and their relevance in human diseases. We also provide information on gene expression.

Additionally, using the same techniques, we determined the fatty  composition of N43 hypothalamic cells following exposure to palmitic and linoleic , alone or in combination.Our data demonstrate there is a sexual dimorphism in brain fatty  content both following the consumption of the chow diet, as well as the WD, with males having an increased percentage of saturated fatty acids and reductions in ω6-polyunsaturated fatty acids when compared to females. Interestingly, we did not observe a sexual dimorphism in fatty  content in the plasma of the same mice. Furthermore, exposure of N43 cells to the ω6-PUFA linoleic , which is higher in female brains when compared to males, reduces palmitic -induced inflammation.Our data suggest male and female brains, and not plasma, differ in their fatty  profile. This is the first time, to our knowledge, lipidomic analyses has been used to directly test the hypothesis there is a sexual dimorphism in brain and plasma fatty  composition following consumption of the chow diet, as well as following exposure to the WD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11323116>Amyloid beta(1-42) and its beta(25-35) fragment induce in vitro phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis in bovine retina capillary pericytes.</a></h2><p>We describe the inhibitory effect of full-length Abeta(1-42) and Abeta(25-35) fragment of amyloid-beta peptide on phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) metabolism in bovine retina capillary pericytes. Cell cultures were incubated with Abetas for 24 h. Peroxidation indices (malondialdehyde and lactate dehydrogenase release) significantly increased after 20-50 microM Abeta(1-42) or Abeta(25-35) treatment. In addition, [Me-3H]choline incorporation into PtdCho strongly decreased while either 3H-choline or 14C- release from prelabeled cells increased, indicating PtdCho hydrolysis. The effect was very likely due to prooxidant action of both Abeta peptides. Reversed-sequence Abeta(35-25) peptide did not depress 3H-choline incorporation nor stimulate PtdCho breakdown. With addition of Abetas at low concentrations (2-20 microM) to pericytes, marked ultrastructural changes, well connected to metabolic alterations, emerged including shrinkage of cell bodies, retraction of processes, disruption of the intracellular actin network. Cells treated with higher concentrations (50-200 microM) displayed characteristics of necrotic cell death. The data suggest that: (a) Abeta(1-42) and Abeta(25-35) peptides may modulate phospholipid turnover in microvessel pericytes; (b) together with endothelial cells, pericytes could be the target of vascular damage during processes involving amyloid accumulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16819372>Nutritional approach to restore impaired intestinal   and growth after neonatal stress in rats.</a></h2><p>Psychological stress during the neonatal period results in intestinal  dysfunction and growth alterations later in life. We aimed to restore impaired   and growth rate by a nutritional intervention.Male rat pups (n = 84) were assigned to 1 of 2 rearing conditions from postnatal day (PND) 2 to PND14: S, separated 3 h/d from their mothers, or H, 15 min/d handled controls. From PND15 to PND35, rats received a control diet or a similar diet adapted to contain  and docosahexaenoic acids, galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides and Lactobacillus paracasei NCC2461.Maternal separation had only a minor impact on the measured gut  parameters at PND15, whereas it severely affected them at PND35. At this age, intestinal permeability to macromolecules was higher, mucin content in small intestinal tissues was lower and microbiota composition was altered in S compared with H animals. Feeding the adapted diet normalized the intestinal permeability, although it did not restore intestinal mucin content or microbiota. In addition, the adapted diet improved the growth rate recovery of the S animals after weaning and resulted in increased villus length in small intestine.Our results suggest that an adapted diet containing specific long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, prebiotics and probiotics can revert the negative imprinting of neonatal stress on both intestinal   and growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18086569>Hepoxilin A3 (HXA3) synthase deficiency is causative of a novel ichthyosis form.</a></h2><p>Non-bullous congenital ichthyosis erythroderma (NCIE) and lamellar ichthyosis (LI) are characterized by mutations in 12R-lipoxygenase (12R-LOX) and/or epidermal lipoxygenase 3 (eLOX3) enzymes. The eLOX3 lacks oxygenase activity, but is capable of forming hepoxilin-type products from -derived hydroperoxide from 12R-LOX, termed 12R-hydroperoxyeicosa-5,8,10,14-tetraenoic  (12R-HpETE). Mutations in either of two enzymes lead to NCIE or LI. Moreover, 12R-LOX-deficient mice exhibit severe phenotypic water  dysfunctions. Here, we demonstrate that 12R-HpETE can also be transformed to 8R-HXA(3) by hepoxilin A(3) (HXA(3)) synthase (12-lipoxygenase), which exhibits oxygenase activity.

Although both conditions are characterized by epidermal  impairment, AD also exhibits signs of inflammation. This work was aimed at delineating the role of FLG loss-of- mutations on eicosanoid metabolism in IV and AD. Using human epidermal equivalents (HEEs) generated with keratinocytes isolated from nonlesional skin of patients with FLG wild-type AD (WT/WT), FLG-mutated AD (FLG/WT), IV (FLG/FLG), or FLG WT control skin, we assessed the potential autocrine role of epidermal-derived eicosanoids in FLG-associated versus FLG-WT AD pathogenesis. Ultrastructural analyses demonstrated abnormal stratum corneum lipid architecture in AD and IV HEEs, independent of FLG genotype. Both AD (FLG/WT) and IV (FLG/FLG) HEEs showed impaired late epidermal differentiation. Only AD (FLG/WT) HEEs exhibited significantly increased levels of inflammatory cytokines. Analyses of lipid mediators revealed increased  and 12-lipoxygenase metabolites. Whereas treatment of control HEEs with  increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, 12-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic  attenuated expression of late differentiation markers. Thus, FLG mutations lead to alterations in epidermal eicosanoid metabolism that could serve as an autocrine trigger of inflammation and impaired late epidermal differentiation in AD.Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

In the central nervous system, cPLA activation is implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases that involves neuroinflammation, thus making it an important pharmacological target. In this paper, a new class of  (AA) analogues was synthesized and evaluated for their ability to inhibit cPLA. Several compounds were found to inhibit cPLA more strongly than arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF), an inhibitor that is commonly used in the study of cPLA-related neurodegenerative diseases. Subsequent experiments concluded that one of the inhibitors was found to be cPLA-selective, non-cytotoxic, cell and brain penetrant and capable of reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) production in stimulated microglial cells. Computational studies were employed to understand how the compound interacts with cPLA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26918937>Understanding the Mechanism of the Hydrogen Abstraction from  Catalyzed by the Human Enzyme 15-Lipoxygenase-2. A Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics Free Energy Simulation.</a></h2><p>Lipoxygenases (LOXs) are a family of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of several lipid mediators. In the case of human 15-LOX, the 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2 isoforms show slightly different reaction regiospecificity and substrate specificity, indicating that substrate binding and recognition may be different, a fact that could be related to their different biological role. Here, we have used long molecular dynamics simulations, QM(DFT)/MM potential energy and free energy calculations (using the newly developed DHAM method), to investigate the binding mode of the  (AA) substrate into 15-LOX-2 and the rate-limiting hydrogen-abstraction reaction 15-LOX-2 catalyzes. Our results strongly indicate that hydrogen abstraction from C13 in 15-LOX-2 is only consistent with the "tail-first" orientation of AA, with its carboxylate group interacting with Arg429, and that only the pro-S H13 hydrogen will be abstracted (being the pro-R H13 and H10 too far from the acceptor oxygen atom). At the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level the potential and free energy barriers for the pro-S H13 abstraction of AA by 15-LOX-2 are 18.0 and 18.6 kcal/mol, respectively. To analyze the kinetics of the hydrogen abstraction process, we determined a Markov model corresponding to the unbiased simulations along the state-discretized reaction coordinate. The calculated rates based on the second largest eigenvalue of the Markov matrices agree well with experimental measurements, and also provide the means to directly determine the pre-exponential factor for the reaction by comparing with the free energy  height. Our calculated pre-exponential factor is close to the value of kBT/h. On the other hand, our results suggest that the spin inversion of the complete system (including the O2 molecule) that is required to happen at some point along the full process to lead to the final hydroperoxide product, is likely to take place during the hydrogen transfer, which is a proton coupled electron transfer. Overall, a different binding mode from the one accepted for 15-LOX-1 is proposed, which provides a molecular basis for 15-LOX-2 exclusive 15-HPETE production in front of the double (although highly 15-) 12/15 regiospecificity of 15-LOX-1. Understanding how these different isoenzymes achieve their regiospecificity is expected to help in specific inhibitor design.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20514017>Transgenic expression of 15-lipoxygenase 2 (15-LOX2) in mouse prostate leads to hyperplasia and cell senescence.</a></h2><p>15-Lipoxygenase 2 (15-LOX2), a lipid-peroxidizing enzyme, is mainly expressed in the luminal compartment of the normal human prostate, and is often decreased or lost in prostate cancer. Previous studies from our lab implicate 15-LOX2 as a functional tumor suppressor. To better understand the biological role of 15-LOX2 in vivo, we generated prostate-specific 15-LOX2 transgenic mice using the ARR2PB promoter. Unexpectedly, transgenic expression of 15-LOX2 or 15-LOX2sv-b, a splice variant that lacks -metabolizing activity, resulted in age-dependent prostatic hyperplasia and enlargement of the prostate. Prostatic hyperplasia induced by both 15-LOX2 and 15-LOX2sv-b was associated with an increase in luminal and Ki-67(+) cells; however, 15-LOX2-transgenic prostates also showed a prominent increase in basal cells. Microarray analysis revealed distinct gene expression profiles that could help explain the prostate phenotypes. Strikingly, 15-LOX2, but not 15-LOX2sv-b, transgenic prostate showed upregulation of several well-known stem or progenitor cell molecules including Sca-1, Trop2, p63, Nkx3.1 and Psca. Prostatic hyperplasia caused by both 15-LOX2 and 15-LOX2sv-b did not progress to prostatic intraprostate neoplasia or carcinoma and, mechanistically, prostate lobes (especially those of 15-LOX2 mice) showed a dramatic increase in senescent cells as revealed by increased SA-betagal, p27(Kip1) and heterochromatin protein 1gamma staining. Collectively, our results suggest that 15-LOX2 expression in mouse prostate leads to hyperplasia and also induces cell senescence, which may, in turn,  as a  to tumor development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28923362>Human retinal endothelial cells and astrocytes cultured on 3-D scaffolds for ocular drug discovery and development.</a></h2><p>Topical ocular ketorolac improves the outcomes of severe retinopathy of prematurity and when administered with systemic caffeine, decreases the severity of oxygen-induced retinopathy. We tested the hypothesis that co-cultures of human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) and human retinal astrocytes (HRAs) on 3-dimensional (3-D) hydrogel scaffolds is a more representative biomimetic paradigm of the blood-retinal- (BRB) than 2-D cultures, and should be utilized for preclinical drug discovery and development. Mono- and co-cultures of HRECs and HRAs were treated with standard doses of ketorolac, ibuprofen, and/or caffeine, and exposed to hyperoxia, intermittent hypoxia (IH), or normoxia on 2-D surfaces or 3-D biodegradable hydrogel scaffolds (AlgiMatrix or Geltrex). Media and cells were collected at 72h post treatment for  metabolites. Cells cultured on 3-D scaffolds exhibited less oxidative stress and variability in drug responses. HRAs enhanced the responses of HRECs to drugs and changes in oxygen environment. PGE and PGI were the predominant prostanoids produced in response to IH, reflecting COX-2 immunoreactivity. We conclude that HRECs and HRAs co-cultured on 3-D scaffolds may recapitulate drug responses of the dynamic BRB and therefore should be implemented for preclinical ocular drug discovery and development.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10935890>The blood-brain  and its role in inflammation.</a></h2><p>The unique microenvironment within the central nervous system (CNS) relies upon the integrity of the blood-brain  (BBB). This selectively permeable  comprises interendothelial tight junctions located at the capillaries and postcapillary venules. Cells and structures in the local environment are required to maintain normal BBB . When inflammation is present, the BBB itself plays an integral role in the inflammatory response by either producing or expressing a variety of cytokines, adhesion molecules, metalloproteinases, serine proteases, products of  metabolism, and nitric oxide. Understanding the role of the BBB during inflammation is essential when creating and employing a therapeutic regime for animals with CNS disease. This review focusses on recent discoveries about the BBB and its role in inflammation, and applies this knowledge to our current understanding of inflammatory CNS disease in dogs and cats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27559173>β-Catenin Is Required for Endothelial Cyp1b1 Regulation Influencing Metabolic  .</a></h2><p>The canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is crucial for blood-brain  (BBB) formation in brain endothelial cells. Although glucose transporter 1, claudin-3, and plasmalemma vesicular-associated protein have been identified as Wnt/β-catenin targets in brain endothelial cells, further downstream targets relevant to BBB formation and  are incompletely explored. By Affymetrix expression analysis, we show that the cytochrome P450 enzyme Cyp1b1 was significantly decreased in β-catenin-deficient mouse endothelial cells, whereas its close homolog Cyp1a1 was upregulated in an aryl hydrocarbon receptor-dependent manner, hence indicating that β-catenin is indispensable for Cyp1b1 but not for Cyp1a1 expression. Functionally, Cyp1b1 could generate retinoic  from retinol leading to cell-autonomous induction of the -related ATP-binding cassette transporter P-glycoprotein. Cyp1b1 could also generate 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  from , decreasing endothelial   in vitro In mice in vivo pharmacological inhibition of Cyp1b1 increased BBB permeability for small molecular tracers, and Cyp1b1 was downregulated in glioma vessels in which BBB  is lost. Hence, we propose Cyp1b1 as a target of β-catenin indirectly influencing BBB properties via its metabolic activity, and as a potential target for modulating   in endothelial cells.Wnt/β-catenin signaling is crucial for blood-brain  (BBB) development and maintenance; however, its role in regulating metabolic characteristics of endothelial cells is unclear. We provide evidence that β-catenin influences endothelial metabolism by transcriptionally regulating the cytochrome P450 enzyme Cyp1b1 Furthermore, expression of its close homolog Cyp1a1 was inhibited by β-catenin. Functionally, Cyp1b1 generated retinoic  as well as 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  that regulated P-glycoprotein and junction proteins, respectively, thereby modulating BBB properties. Inhibition of Cyp1b1 in vivo increased BBB permeability being in line with its downregulation in glioma endothelia, potentially implicating Cyp1b1 in other brain pathologies. In conclusion, Wnt/β-catenin signaling regulates endothelial metabolic   through Cyp1b1 transcription.Copyright © 2016 the authors 0270-6474/16/368921-15$15.00/0.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29890256>In vitro/in vivo investigation on the potential of Pluronic® mixed micelles for pulmonary drug delivery.</a></h2><p>In this paper, we shed light on the potential of Pluronic® mixed micelles in lung delivery of poorly water-soluble drugs. To this purpose, Pluronic® P123/F127 mixed micelles (PMM), exhibiting superior stability in biological fluids, were loaded with budesonide (BUD), a model hydrophobic corticosteroid, and fully investigated focusing on their stability in pulmonary-relevant media, transport through the mucus  and aerodynamic behaviour in vitro. Then, lung bio-distribution and efficacy were evaluated in vivo, after intra-tracheal administration in rats. PMM showed excellent stability in saline, mucin, artificial airway mucus and simulated interstitial lung fluid. Likely due to their small size coupled with the hydrophilic biofouling shell, PMM did not interact with mucin and consequently diffused through artificial mucus. BUD was loaded with high efficiency in PMM and released at sustained rate in artificial mucus. BUD-PMM dispersion in saline was efficiently delivered through a common jet nebulizer without aggregation. After intratracheal administration in rats, PMM labelled with Rhodamine B persisted in the lung up to 24 h, while serum levels rapidly dropped. Finally, the effects of BUD-PMM in a rat model of lung inflammation induced by intra-tracheal aerosolization of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from E. coli were investigated. Of note, a single intra-tracheal aerosolization of BUD-PMM significantly reduced bronchoalveolar neutrophil infiltration and the expression of protein/enzymes derived from the  cascade induced by LPS, whereas a control BUD aqueous suspension showed a weaker effect. Overall, this study demonstrates that inhalable formulations of PMM can be considered as a platform for local delivery of hydrophobic drugs at lungs worth of further consideration.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In addition to hemostasis, Plts also  to stabilize the vasculature and maintain endothelial cell (EC)  integrity. We hypothesized that Plt-EVs would inhibit vascular EC permeability, similar to fresh Plts. To investigate this hypothesis, we used in vitro and in vivo models of vascular endothelial compromise and bleeding.In the vitro model, Plt-EVs were isolated by ultracentrifugation and characterized for Plt markers and particle size distribution. Effects of Plts and Plt-EVs on endothelial   were assessed by transendothelial electrical resistance measurements and histological analysis of endothelial junction proteins. Hemostatic potential of Plt-EVs and Plts was assessed by multiple electrode Plt aggregometry. Using an in vivo model, the effects of Plts and Plt-EVs on vascular permeability and bleeding were assessed in non-obese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficient (NOD-SCID) mice by an established Miles assay of vascular permeability and a tail snip bleeding assay.In the in vitro model, Plt-EVs displayed exosomal size distribution and expressed Plt-specific surface markers. Platelets and Plt-EVs decreased EC permeability and restored EC junctions after thrombin challenge. Multiplate aggregometry revealed that Plt-EVs enhanced thrombin receptor-activating peptide-mediated aggregation of whole blood, whereas Plts enhanced thrombin receptor-activating peptide-, -, collagen-, and adenosine diphosphate-mediated aggregation. In the in vivo model, Plt-EVs are equivalent to Plts in attenuating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A-induced vascular permeability and uncontrolled blood loss in a tail snip hemorrhage model.Our study is the first to report that Plt-EVs might provide a feasible product for transfusion in trauma patients to attenuate bleeding, inhibit vascular permeability, and mitigate the endotheliopathy of trauma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16525189>Uptake and metabolism of plasma-derived erucic  by rat brain.</a></h2><p>We examined the ability of erucic  (22:1n-9) to cross the blood-brain  (BBB) by infusing [14-14C]22:1n-9 (170 microCi/kg, iv and icv) into awake, male rats. [1-14C] (20:4n-6) [intravenous (i.v.)] was the positive control. After i.v. infusion, 0.011% of the plasma [14-14C]22:1n-9 was extracted by the brain, compared with 0.055% of the plasma [1-14C]20:4n-6. The [14-14C]22:1n-9 was extensively beta-oxidized (60%), compared with 30% for [1-14C]20:4n-6. Although 20:4n-6 was targeted primarily to phospholipid pools, 22:1n-9 was targeted to cholesteryl esters, triglycerides, and phospholipids. When [14-14C]22:1n-9 was infused directly into the fourth ventricle of the brain [intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.)] for 7 days, 60% of the tracer entered the phospholipid pools, similar to the distribution observed for [1-14C]20:4n-6. This demonstrates plasticity in the ability of the brain to esterify 22:1n-9 in an exposure-dependent manner. In i.v. and i.c.v. infused rats, a significant amount of tracer found in the phospholipid pools underwent sequential rounds of chain shortening and was found as [12-14C]20:1n-9 and [10-14C]oleic . These results demonstrate for the first time that intact 22:1n-9 crosses the BBB, is incorporated into specific lipid pools, and is chain-shortened.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23397617>Regulation of permeability across the blood-brain .</a></h2><p>The blood-brain  refers to the very low permeability across microvessels in the Central Nervous System (CNS), created by the interaction between vascular endothelial cells and surrounding cells of the neurovascular unit. Permeability can be modulated (increased and decreased) by a variety of factors including inflammatory mediators, inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and through alterations in the phenotype of blood vessels during angiogenesis and apoptosis.

Certain chemical functionality such as the carboxylic  is a general liability for BBB permeability preventing significant CNS distribution of a drug from a systemic dose. Here, we report a strategy for CNS-selective distribution of the carboxylic  containing thyromimetic sobetirome using prodrugs targeted to fatty- amide hydrolase (FAAH), which is expressed in the brain. Two amide prodrugs of sobetirome were shown to be efficient substrates of FAAH with V/K values comparable to the natural endocannabinoid FAAH substrate anandamide. In mice, a systemic dose of sobetirome prodrug leads to a substantial ∼60-fold increase in brain distribution (K) of sobetirome compared to an equimolar systemic dose of the parent drug. The increased delivery of sobetirome to the brain from the prodrug was diminished by both pharmacological inhibition and genetic deletion of FAAH in vivo. The increased brain exposure of sobetirome arising from the prodrug corresponds to ∼30-fold increased potency in brain target engagement compared to the parent drug. These results suggest that FAAH-targeted prodrugs can considerably increase drug exposure to the CNS with a concomitant decrease in systemic drug levels generating a desirable distribution profile for CNS acting drugs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25090924>Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor (CysLT) antagonists decrease pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures and blood-brain  dysfunction.</a></h2><p>Current evidence suggests that inflammation plays a role in the pathophysiology of seizures. In line with this view, selected pro-inflammatory  derivatives have been reported to facilitate seizures. Kainate-induced seizures are accompanied by leukotriene formation, and are reduced by inhibitors of LOX/COX pathway. Moreover, LTD4 receptor blockade and LTD4 synthesis inhibition suppress pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced kindling and pilocarpine-induced recurrent seizures. Although there is convincing evidence supporting that blood-brain- (BBB) dysfunction facilitates seizures, no study has investigated whether the anticonvulsant effect of montelukast is associated with its ability to maintain BBB integrity. In this study we investigated whether montelukast and other CysLT receptor antagonists decrease PTZ-induced seizures, as well as whether these antagonists preserve BBB during PTZ-induced seizures. Adult male albino Swiss mice were stereotaxically implanted with a cannula into the right lateral ventricle, and two electrodes were placed over the parietal cortex along with a ground lead positioned over the nasal sinus for electroencephalography (EEG) recording. The effects of montelukast (0.03 or 0.3 μmol/1 μL, i.c.v.), pranlukast (1 or 3 μmol/1 μL, i.c.v.), Bay u-9773 (0.3, 3 or 30 nmol/1 μL, i.c.v.), in the presence or absence of the agonist LTD4 (0.2, 2, 6 or 20 pmol/1 μL, i.c.v.), on PTZ (1.8 μmol/2 μL)-induced seizures and BBB permeability disruption were determined. The animals were injected with the antagonists, agonist or vehicle 30 min before PTZ, and monitored for additional 30 min for the appearance of seizures by electrographic and behavioral methods. BBB permeability was assessed by sodium fluorescein method and by confocal microscopy for CD45 and IgG immunoreactivity. Bay-u9973 (3 and 30 nmol), montelukast (0.03 and 0.3 μmol) and pranlukast (1 and 3 μmol), increased the latency to generalized seizures and decreased the mean amplitude of EEG recordings during seizures. LTD4 (0.2 and 2 pmol) reverted the anticonvulsant effect of montelukast (0.3 μmol). Montelukast (0.03 and 0.3 μmol) prevented PTZ-induced BBB disruption, an effect that was reversed by LTD4 at the dose of 6 pmol, but not at the doses 0.2 and 2 pmol. Moreover, the doses of LTD4 (0.2 and 2 pmol) that reverted the effect of montelukast on seizures did not alter montelukast-induced protection of BBB, dissociating BBB protection and anticonvulsant activity. Confocal microscopy analysis revealed that 1. PTZ increased the number of CD45+ and double-immunofluorescence staining for CD45 and IgG cells in the cerebral cortex, indicating BBB leakage with leukocyte infiltration; 2. while LTD4 (6 pmol) potentiated, montelukast decreased the effect of PTZ on leukocyte migration and BBB, assessed by double-immunofluorescence staining for CD45 and IgG cells in the cannulated hemisphere. Our data do not allow us ruling out that mechanisms unrelated and related to BBB protection may co-exist, resulting in decreased seizure susceptibility by montelukast. Notwithstanding, they suggest that CysLT1 receptors may be a suitable target for anticonvulsant development.Copyright © 2014 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) is the inducible key enzyme of  metabolism and is a central mediator in inflammation and cancer. Expression of the Cox-2 gene is up-regulated in the gastric mucosa during H. pylori infection but the pathobiological consequences of this enhanced Cox-2 expression are not yet characterized. The aim of this study was to identify novel genes down-stream of Cox-2 in an in vivo model, thereby identifying potential targets for the study of the role of Cox- 2 in H. pylori pathogenesis and the initiation of pre- cancerous changes.Gene expression profiles in the gastric mucosa of mice treated with a specific Cox-2 inhibitor (NS398) or vehicle were analysed at different time points (6, 13 and 19 wk) after H. pylori infection. H. pylori infection affected the expression of 385 genes over the experimental period, including regulators of gastric , proliferation, apoptosis and mucosal defence. Under conditions of Cox-2 inhibition, 160 target genes were regulated as a result of H. pylori infection. The Cox-2 dependent subset included those influencing gastric  (Gastrin, Galr1), epithelial   (Tjp1, connexin45, Aqp5), inflammation (Icam1), apoptosis (Clu) and proliferation (Gdf3, Igf2). Treatment with NS398 alone caused differential expression of 140 genes, 97 of which were unique, indicating that these genes are regulated under conditions of basal Cox-2 expression.This study has identified a panel of novel Cox-2 dependent genes influenced under both normal and the inflammatory conditions induced by H. pylori infection.

Here, we discuss possible pathways for this Ca2+ entry. The superfamily of cation channels derived from the "transient receptor potential" (TRP) channels is introduced. Several members of this family are expressed in ECs, and they provide pathways for Ca2+ entry. All TRP subfamilies may contribute to the Ca2+ entry channels or to the regulation of Ca2+ entry in EC. Members of Ca2+ entry channels in endothelium probably belong to the canonical TRP subfamily, TRPC. All TRPC1-6 have been discussed as Ca2+ entry channels that might be store-operated and/or receptor-operated. More importantly, knockout models of TRPC4 have proven that this channel is functionally involved in the regulation of endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation and in the control of EC  . TRPC1 might be an important candidate for involvement of endothelial growth factors. TRPC3 is unequivocally important for a sustained EC Ca2+ entry. ECs express different patterns of TRPCs, which may increase the variability of TRPC channel  by formation of different multiheteromers. Among the two other TRP subfamilies, TRPMV and TRPM, at least TRPV4 and TRPM4 are EC channels. TRPV4 is a Ca2+ entry channel that is activated by an increase in cell volume, which might be involved in mechano-sensing, by an increase in temperature, and perhaps by ligand-activation. TRPM4 is a nonselective cation channel, which is not Ca2+ permeable. It is probably modulated by NO and might be essential for regulating the inward driving force for Ca2+ entry. Possible modes of TRP channel regulation are described, involving (a) activation via the phospholipase (PL)Cbeta and PLC-gamma pathways; (b) activation by lipids (diacylglycerol [DAG], ); (c) Ca2+ depletion of Ca2+ stores in the endoplasmic reticulum; (d) shear stress; and (e) radicals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175943>Long-term exposure to fluoride as a factor promoting changes in the expression and activity of cyclooxygenases (COX1 and COX2) in various rat brain structures.</a></h2><p>Sixty percent of the mammalian brain is composed of lipids including  (AA). AA released from cell membranes is metabolised in the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway to prostanoids - biologically active substances involved in the regulation of many processes including inflammation. It has been shown that long-term exposure to fluoride in pre and neonatal period is dangerous because this element is able to penetrate through the placenta and to cross the blood-brain . Exposure to fluoride during the development affects metabolism and  of neurons and glia which results in the impairment of cognitive functions but the exact mechanisms of fluoride neurotoxicity are not clearly defined.The aim of this study was to determine whether exposure to fluoride during the development affects COXes activity and the synthesis of prostanoids.Pre- and postnatal toxicity model in Wistar rats was used. Experimental animals received 50 mg/L of NaF in drinking water ad libitum, while control animals received tap water. In cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum and striatum were measured fluoride concentration, COX1 and COX2 genes expression, immunolocalization of the enzymatic proteins and concentration of PGE2 and TXB2.of this study showed statistically significant changes in the concentration of fluoride in brain structures between study group and control animals. Moreover, significant changes in the expression level of COX1 and COX2, and in the concentration of PGE2 and TXB2 were observed.Exposure to fluoride in the prenatal and neonatal period result in the increase in COX2 activity and increase in PGE2 concentration in rats brain, which may lead to disturbances in central nervous system homeostasis.‬‬.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Asp-132 is surrounded by residues from both subunits I and III. In the absence of subunit III, CcO retains activity, but the functional characteristics of the D-pathway are significantly altered such that the transfer of protons from Asp-132 into the pathway becomes the rate-limiting step. Determination of the pH-dependence of the rate constant for D-pathway proton uptake during the single-turnover of CcO indicates that the pKa of Asp-132 in the absence of subunit III is approximately 7. The removal of subunit III also allows for alternative surface proton donor/acceptors other than Asp-132. With Asp-132 altered to alanine, the rate constant for D-pathway proton uptake is very slow (5 s(-1)) in the presence of subunit III. Once subunit III is removed, the proton uptake rate constant increases 80-fold, to 400 s(-1). The pKa associated with this uptake is >10, and the initial proton donor/acceptor in D132A III (-) is proposed to be a water of the D-pathway rather than an amino  residue.  (Aa), which stimulates the activity of several D-pathway mutant CcOs, appears to become the initial proton donor/acceptor in the absence of subunit III, whether or not Asp-132 is altered. Aa shifts the pKa of the initial proton donor to 7.6 for both wild-type (WT) III (-) and D132A III (-). The results indicate that subunit III creates a  that helps prevent protons from donors other than Asp-132 from directly accessing the internal waters of the D-pathway, while the subunit also provides an environment that increases the rate at which Asp-132 transfers protons into the D-pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19678934>Reduction of lipoxidative load by secretory phospholipase A2 inhibition protects against neurovascular injury following experimental stroke in rat.</a></h2><p>In animal models, ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury triggers membrane lipid degradation and accumulation of lipoxidative exacerbations in neurovascular unit, leading to blood brain  (BBB) damage and neurologic deficits. In this study, we investigated whether impeding membrane lipid breakdown by inhibiting secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) activity reduces BBB leakage, leading to neuroprotection and functional recovery.Focal cerebral IR injury was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in adult male rats. A sPLA2 inhibitor, 7,7-dimethyleicosadienoic  (DEDA), was administered following IR injury. DEDA-treated animals were compared with vehicle-treated in terms of BBB leakage, edema, infarct volume, and neurological deficit. Membrane lipid degradation and the expression/activity of sPLA2 were also assessed. The role of one of the sPLA2 products,  (AA), on the morphology of the differentiated neuronal cell PC12 was examined by light microscopy.Treatment with DEDA after IR injury not only reduced BBB leakage but also decreased infarct volume and improved neurologic . The treatment attenuated both the activity of sPLA2 and the levels of sPLA2-derived oxidized products. The metabolites of lipid oxidation/peroxidation, including the protein carbonyl, were reduced as well. The treatment also restored the levels of glutathione, indicating attenuation of oxidative stress. In vitro treatment of PC12 cells with DEDA did not restore the AA-mediated inhibition of neurite formation and the levels of glutathione, indicating that effect of DEDA is up stream to AA release.sPLA2-derived oxidative products contribute to significant neurovascular damage, and treatment with sPLA2 inhibitor DEDA ameliorates secondary injury by reducing exacerbations from lipoxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18545259>Role of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase/cytosolic phospholipase A2 signaling pathway in blood-brain  disruption after focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion.</a></h2><p>Cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) is a key enzyme that mediates  metabolism, which causes cerebral ischemia-induced oxidative injury, blood-brain  (BBB) dysfunction, and edema. Recent reports have shown that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is related to phosphorylation and activation of cPLA(2) and release of . However, involvement of the p38 MAPK pathway in cPLA(2) activation and of reactive oxygen species in expression of p38 MAPK/cPLA(2) after ischemia-reperfusion injury in the brain remains unclear. To address these issues, we used a model of transient focal cerebral ischemia (tFCI) in rats. Western blot analysis showed a significant increase in expression of phospho-p38 MAPK and phospho-cPLA(2) in rat brain cortex after tFCI. Activity assays showed that both p38 MAPK and cPLA(2) activation markedly increased 1 day after reperfusion. Intraventricular administration of SB203580 significantly suppressed activation and phosphorylation of cPLA(2) and attenuated BBB extravasation and subsequent edema. Moreover, overexpression of copper/zinc-superoxide dismutase remarkably diminished activation and phosphorylation of both p38 MAPK and cPLA(2) after reperfusion. These findings suggest that the p38 MAPK/cPLA(2) pathway may promote BBB disruption with secondary vasogenic edema and that superoxide anions can stimulate this pathway after ischemia-reperfusion injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18035561>Coordinating cell proliferation and migration in the lens and cornea.</a></h2><p>Migration is a complex process for epithelial tissues, because the epithelium must move as an intact sheet to preserve its  . The requirement for structural integrity is met by coupling cell-to-matrix and cell-to-cell adhesion at the cellular level, and by coordinating cell proliferation and cell migration in the tissue as a whole. Proliferation is suppressed at the migrating cell front, allowing cells in this region to remain tightly packed while advancing rapidly. At the same time, proliferation is enhanced in a region behind the advancing cell front to expand the epithelial cell sheet.

AD pathogenesis remains elusive, but may involve complex interplays among skin  dysfunction, Th2 inflammation, and pruritus. Current treatments for AD are still limited to symptomatic therapies. We previously showed that HR-1 hairless mice fed a special diet (HR-AD) develop AD-like symptoms; however, the ingredient(s) causing dermatitis remain unclear. In this study, we examined whether the deficiency of certain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) was involved in the diet-induced AD pathogenesis. In the serum of HR-AD-fed mice, levels of linoleic  (LA, 18:2n-6) and α-linolenic  (ALA, 18:3n-3), as well as their metabolites, were markedly decreased. HR-AD-induced AD symptoms were significantly ameliorated by LA supplementation, and to a lesser extent by ALA supplementation. In addition, LA metabolites, such as γ-linolenic  and , had effects similar to those of LA. Further, using semi-purified custom diets, we attempted to reproduce HR-AD-induced AD symptoms. Unexpectedly, a deficiency in unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) alone caused mild symptoms. However, several modifications of fat and carbohydrate components in the diet revealed that dietary deficiencies of UFA and cornstarch were required to fully induce severe AD symptoms. Furthermore, we examined the influence of genetic background on the development of diet-induced AD and found that a hypomorphic mutation in the hairless gene Hr, encoding a nuclear receptor (NR) corepressor, was essential for the complete development of diet-induced pruritic atopic skin. Thus, our findings suggest that certain PUFAs and NRs are new, potential therapeutic targets for treating AD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11379794>Regulation of blood-brain  permeability.</a></h2><p>The blood-brain  minimizes the entry of molecules into brain tissue. This restriction arises by the presence of tight junctions (zonulae occludens) between adjacent endothelial cells and a relative paucity of pinocytotic vesicles within endothelium of cerebral arterioles, capillaries, and venules. Many types of stimuli can alter the permeability characteristics of the blood-brain . Acute increases in arterial blood pressure beyond the autoregulatory capacity of cerebral blood vessels, application of hyperosmolar solutions, application of various inflammatory mediators known to be elevated during brain injury, and/or activation of blood-borne elements such as leukocytes can produce changes in permeability of the blood-brain . The second messenger systems that account for increases in permeability of the blood-brain  during pathophysiologic conditions, however, remain poorly defined.

Cocoa (Theobroma cacao) is a polyphenol-rich food with putative anti-inflammatory activities. Here, we examined the impact and underlying mechanisms of action of cocoa on AT inflammation in high fat-fed mice. In the present study, male C57BL/6 J mice were fed a high fat diet (HF), a HF diet with 8% (w/w) unsweetened cocoa powder (HFC), or a low-fat diet (LF) for 18 weeks. Cocoa supplementation decreased AT mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and EGF-like module-containing mucin-like hormone receptor-like 1 by 40-60% compared to HF group, and this was accompanied by decreased nuclear protein levels of nuclear factor-κB. Cocoa treatment reduced the levels of  in the AT by 33% compared to HF controls. Moreover, cocoa treatment also reduced protein levels of the eicosanoid-generating enzymes, adipose-specific phospholipase A2 and cyclooxygenase-2 by 53% and 55%, respectively, compared to HF-fed mice. Finally, cocoa treatment ameliorated metabolic endotoxemia (40% reduction in plasma endotoxin) and improved gut   (as measured by increased plasma levels of glucagon-like peptide-2). In conclusion, the present study has shown for the first time that long-term cocoa supplementation can reduce AT inflammation in part by modulating eicosanoid metabolism and metabolic endotoxemia.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In a compromised epithelium, topical phenylephrine will cause drug-induced stromal edema and endothelial vacuolization. Contact lenses are capable of stimulating the epithelial  cascade to release 12(R)hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (12(R)HETE) and 8(R)hydroxy-hexadecatrienoic  (8(R)HHDTrE) to cause endothelial Na+/K+ adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase)-inhibition and polymegethism. Specular microscopy of the corneal endothelial cells after refractive surgery (photorefractive keratectomy [PRK], laser in situ keratomileusis [LASIK], intrastromal rings [INTACs]) has shown that there is minimal effect. However, laser ablation of the stroma within 200 microm of the corneal endothelium will result in endothelial cell structural changes and the formation of the amorphous substance deposited onto Descemet's membrane. Phacoemulsification with a high flow of the irrigation solution can alter the endothelial surface glycoprotein layer. Lidocaine hydrochloride (1%) used as intracameral anesthesia readily diffuses through the corneal endothelium, resulting in stromal uptake and endothelial cell swelling. With phacoemulsification, however, the washout of lidocaine from the cornea (T1/2, 5 minutes) and iris (T1/2, 9 minutes) occurs quickly. Corneal endothelial wound healing after keratoplasty occurs in the following sequence: migration of endothelial cells, development of tight junctions, and the formation of Na+/K+ ATPase pump sites.Corneal endothelial resiliency is due to the increased peripheral endothelial cell number for migration, the ability of endothelial cells to form tight junctions to maintain the endothelial , the increase in endothelial Na+/K+ ATPase pump sites under stress, and the ability of the corneal endothelial cells to shift their metabolism of glucose to the hexose monophosphate shunt for the production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and membrane repair. All of these factors are important, along with the aqueous humor sodium concentration, which establishes the osmotic gradient for corneal deturgescence and transparency.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10696506>Inflammatory mediators and modulation of blood-brain  permeability.</a></h2><p>1. Unlike some interfaces between the blood and the nervous system (e.g., nerve perineurium), the brain endothelium forming the blood-brain  can be modulated by a range of inflammatory mediators. The mechanisms underlying this modulation are reviewed, and the implications for therapy of the brain discussed. 2. Methods for measuring blood-brain  permeability in situ include the use of radiolabeled tracers in parenchymal vessels and measurements of transendothelial resistance and rate of loss of fluorescent dye in single pial microvessels. In vitro studies on culture models provide details of the signal transduction mechanisms involved. 3. Routes for penetration of polar solutes across the brain endothelium include the paracellular tight junctional pathway (usually very tight) and vesicular mechanisms. Inflammatory mediators have been reported to influence both pathways, but the clearest evidence is for modulation of tight junctions. 4. In addition to the brain endothelium, cell types involved in inflammatory reactions include several closely associated cells including pericytes, astrocytes, smooth muscle, microglia, mast cells, and neurons. In situ it is often difficult to identify the site of action of a vasoactive agent. In vitro models of brain endothelium are experimentally simpler but may also lack important features generated in situ by cell:cell interaction (e.g. induction, signaling). 5. Many inflammatory agents increase both endothelial permeability and vessel diameter, together contributing to significant leak across the blood-brain  and cerebral edema. This review concentrates on changes in endothelial permeability by focusing on studies in which changes in vessel diameter are minimized. 6. Bradykinin (Bk) increases blood-brain  permeability by acting on B2 receptors. The downstream events reported include elevation of [Ca2+]i, activation of phospholipase A2, release of , and production of free radicals, with evidence that IL-1 beta potentiates the actions of Bk in ischemia. 7. Serotonin (5HT) has been reported to increase blood-brain  permeability in some but not all studies. Where  opening was seen, there was evidence for activation of 5-HT2 receptors and a calcium-dependent permeability increase. 8. Histamine is one of the few central nervous system neurotransmitters found to cause consistent blood-brain  opening. The earlier literature was unclear, but studies of pial vessels and cultured endothelium reveal increased permeability mediated by H2 receptors and elevation of [Ca2+]i and an H1 receptor-mediated reduction in permeability coupled to an elevation of cAMP. 9. Brain endothelial cells express nucleotide receptors for ATP, UTP, and ADP, with activation causing increased blood-brain  permeability. The effects are mediated predominantly via a P2U (P2Y2) G-protein-coupled receptor causing an elevation of [Ca2+]i; a P2Y1 receptor acting via inhibition of adenyl cyclase has been reported in some in vitro preparations. 10.  is elevated in some neural pathologies and causes gross opening of the blood-brain  to large molecules including proteins. There is evidence that  acts via generation of free radicals in the course of its metabolism by cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways. 11. The mechanisms described reveal a range of interrelated pathways by which influences from the brain side or the blood side can modulate blood-brain  permeability. Knowledge of the mechanisms is already being exploited for deliberate opening of the blood-brain  for drug delivery to the brain, and the pathways capable of reducing permeability hold promise for therapeutic treatment of inflammation and cerebral edema.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20457139>Role of eicosanoids on intestinal epithelial homeostasis.</a></h2><p>The intestinal epithelium is a highly dynamic system that is continuously renewed by a process involving cell proliferation and differentiation. Moreover, it is the main interface with the external environment, and maintenance and regulation of the epithelial structure and epithelial   are key determinants of digestive health and host well being. The tight junction, a multiprotein complex composed of transmembrane proteins associated with the cytoskeletal peri-junctional ring of actin and myosin, is an essential component of this  that is strictly regulated in a spatio-temporal manner by a complex signaling network. Defects in the intestinal epithelial   have been observed in inflammatory bowel disease, and a classic example of the connection between inflammation and cancer is the increased risk of colorectal cancer in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. In recent years, several molecules have emerged as critical players contributing to inflammation-associated colorectal cancer. For example, eicosanoids derived from  are proposed as mediators involved in the regulation of epithelial structure/. Interestingly, the tissue concentration of eicosanoids increases during mucosal inflammation and colorectal cancer development. This overview focuses on the physiological and physiopathological roles of eicosanoids in cell growth/cell differentiation/apoptosis and in the paracellular permeability of the intestinal epithelium. A better understanding of these processes will foster new ideas for the development of therapies for these chronic disorders.2010 Elsevier Inc.

However, it is not yet clear how AEA can be metabolized at the neurovascular interface, and how it can move through the vascular and the cerebral compartments. The results reported in this article show that isolated bovine brain microvessels, an ex vivo model of the blood-brain , have detectable levels of endogenous AEA and possess the biochemical machinery to bind and metabolize it, i.e. type-1 and type-2 cannabinoid receptors (CB1R and CB2R), a selective AEA membrane transporter (AMT), an AEA-degrading fatty  amide hydrolase, and the AEA-synthesizing enzymes N-acyltransferase and N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamines-specific phospholipase D. We also show that activation of CB1R enhances AMT activity through increased nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity and subsequent increase of NO production. AMT activity is instead reduced by activation of CB2R, which inhibits NOS and NO release. In addition, binding experiments and immunoelectronmicroscopy demonstrate that different endothelial cells vary in the expression of CB1R and CB2R on the luminal and/or abluminal sides. The different localization of CBRs can lead to a diverse effect on AMT activity on the luminal and abluminal membranes, suggesting that the distribution of these receptors may drive AEA directional transport through the blood-brain  and other endothelial cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26383055>Blood-brain  and brain fatty  uptake: Role of  and PGE2.</a></h2><p>How do fatty acids enter the brain and what role, if any, do membrane and cytosolic fatty  binding proteins have on facilitating this process?

Such food components are fatty acids or carbohydrates. Nevertheless, little is known about the impact of oral administration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and non-digestible oligosaccharides on allergen-induced dermatitis.In this pilot study, skin inflammation was induced by serial epicutaneous OVA applications in OVA-sensitized mice. In parallel, mice were fed with solid food containing /docosahexaenoic  (AA/DHA), galactooligosaccharide/polydextrose (GOS/PDX) or their combination. Skin lesions were assessed by clinical skin score, but also skin  parameters, immunohistochemical analyses, and local cytokine expression profile.Both dietary AA/DHA and GOS/PDX significantly ameliorated the severity of allergen-induced dermatitis. The clinical improvement upon oral AA/DHA and GOS/PDX supplementation was associated with a reduction in transepidermal water loss and reduced KI-67 expression in the skin. Lesional CD8+ and mast cells were reduced in all treatment groups, but appeared to be most pronounced in combined AA/DHA/GOS/PDX-treated mice. Moreover, in GOS/PDX-treated mice, IFNγ and TGFβ expression was increased in skin lesions.Dietary supplementation with DHA/AA and GOS/PDX ameliorates symptoms of allergen-induced dermatitis and may thus be beneficial in the dietary management of human atopic eczema.© 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

In this study, we investigated interactions that may occur between human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC), the main constituent of the blood-brain , and S. suis. We show that S. suis acquires plasmin activity in a time-dependent manner when in contact with cultured HBMEC. Cell-associated plasmin activity reached a plateau following a 48h co-incubation period. Zymography analysis revealed that HBMEC produce urokinase, which is probably involved in activation of plasminogen bound to S. suis. We also show that a S. suis culture supernatant which possesses both phospholipase C and haemolysin (suilysin) activities was able to induce the release of  from the membrane of HBMEC. Evidence suggests that the action of suilysin on HBMEC may be a prerequisite for the action of additional molecules such as phospholipase C.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are formed during these cerebrovascular accidents, have a key role in this disruption. ROS are formed constitutively by mitochondria and also by the activation of cell receptors that transduce signals from inflammatory mediators, e.g., activated phospholipase A₂ forms  that interacts with cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase to generate ROS. Endothelial NADPH oxidase, activated by cytokines, also contributes to ROS. There is a surge in ROS following reperfusion after cerebral ischemia and the interaction of the signaling pathways plays a role in this. This review critically evaluates the literature and concludes that the ischemic penumbra is a consequence of the initial edema resulting from the ROS surge after reperfusion.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

These stresses include amphiphilic molecules involved in metabolism and signaling, highly charged polyamines, membrane-permeating peptides, and mechanical and osmotic stresses. As annexins are known to bind to lipid headgroups in the presence of calcium and increase the order of the bilayer lipids, this study addressed whether this activity of annexins provides a potential benefit to the membrane by protecting the bilayer against disruptions of this nature or can promote restoration of the permeability  after damage by such agents. The release of carboxyfluorescein from large unilamellar vesicles composed of lipids characteristically present in the inner leaflet of cell membranes (phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and cholesterol) was used to measure membrane permeability. It was determined that in the presence of calcium, annexin A5 reduced the level of baseline leakage from vesicles and reduced or reversed damage due to , lysophosphatidic , lysophosphatidylcholine, diacylglycerol, monoacylglycerol, spermidine, amyloid-β, amylin, and osmotic shock. Annexin A6 was also able to provide membrane protection in many but not all of these cases. In a cell, it is likely annexins would move to sites of breakdown of the permeability  because of the calcium-dependent promotion of the binding of annexins to membranes at sites of calcium entry. Because of the fundamental importance to life of maintaining the permeability  of the cell membrane, it is proposed here that this property of annexins may represent a critical, primordial activity that explains their great evolutionary conservation and abundant expression in most cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23757306>Effects on varying intravenous lipid emulsions on the small bowel epithelium in a mouse model of parenteral nutrition.</a></h2><p>Injectable fat emulsions (FEs) are a clinically dependable source of essential fatty acids (FA). ω-6 FA is associated with an inflammatory response.

To address this, we used a mouse model of parenteral nutrition (PN) and hypothesized that a decrease in intestinal inflammation would be seen when either fish oil and MCT or olive oil were added.Three FEs were studied in adult C57BL/6 mice via intravenous cannulation: standard soybean-based FE (SBFE), 80% olive oil -supplemented FE (OOFE), or a combination of a soybean oil, MCT, olive oil, and fish oil emulsion (SMOF). PN was given for 7 days, small bowel mucosa-derived cytokines, animal survival rate, epithelial cell (EC) proliferation and apoptosis rates, intestinal   and mucosal FA composition were analyzed.Compared to the SBFE and SMOF groups, the best survival, highest EC proliferation and lowest EC apoptosis rates were observed in the OOFE group; and associated with the lowest levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β expression. Jejunal FA content showed higher levels of eicosapentaenoic and docosapentaenoic  in the SMOF group and the highest  in the OOFE group.The study showed that PN containing OOFE had beneficial effects to small bowel health and animal survival. Further investigation may help to enhance bowel integrity in patients restricted to PN.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29920917>Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG increases cyclooxygenase-2 expression and prostaglandin E2 secretion in colonic myofibroblasts via a MyD88-dependent mechanism during homeostasis.</a></h2><p>Prostaglandin E2 (PGE ) plays a critical role in intestinal mucosal tolerance and barrier integrity. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-dependent PGE production involves mobilisation of . Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LbGG) is one of the most widely used  reported to colonise the colonic mucosa. LbGG contributes to the protection of the small intestine against radiation injury through the repositioning of mucosal COX-2 expressing cells. However, it is unknown if LbGG modulates PGE production in the colonic mucosa under homeostasis and the major cellular elements involved in these processes. Colonic epithelial and CD90 mesenchymal stromal cells, also known as (myo) fibroblasts (CMFs), are abundant innate immune cells in normal colonic mucosa able to produce PGE . Herein, we tested the hypothesis that under colonic mucosal homeostasis, LbGG modulates the eicosanoid pathway resulting in increased PGE production in both epithelial and stromal cells. Among the five tested human colonic epithelial cell lines, only exposure of Caco-2 to LbGG for 24 hr led to the mobilisation of  with concomitant increase in the components within the leukotriene and COX-2-dependent PGE pathways. By contrast, CMFs isolated from the normal human colonic mucosa responded to LbGG with increased expression of COX-2 and PGE in the prostaglandin pathway, but not 5-LO in the leukotriene pathway. Oral gavage of C57BL/6 mice for 5 days with LbGG (5 × 10 Colony-Forming Unit (CFU)/dose) increased COX-2 expression in the colonic mucosa. The majority of cells upregulating COX-2 protein expression were located in the colonic lamina propria and colocalised with α-SMA cells corresponding to the CMF phenotype. This process was myeloid differentiation factor-88-dependent, because silencing of myeloid differentiation factor-88 expression in CMFs abrogated LbGG-induced upregulation of COX-2 in culture and in vivo. Taken together, our data suggest that LbGG increases release of COX-2-mediated PGE , contributing to the maintenance of mucosal homeostasis in the colon and CMFs are among the major contributors to this process.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24725939>Exposure of human astrocytes to leukotriene C4 promotes a CX3CL1/fractalkine-mediated transmigration of HIV-1-infected CD4⁺ T cells across an in vitro blood-brain  model.</a></h2><p>Eicosanoids, including cysteinylleukotrienes (cysLTs), are found in the central nervous system (CNS) of individuals infected with HIV-1. Few studies have addressed the contribution of cysLTs in HIV-1-associated CNS disorders. We demonstrate that conditioned medium from human astrocytes treated with leukotriene C4 (LTC4) increases the transmigration of HIV-1-infected CD4(+) T cells across an in vitro blood-brain  (BBB) model using cultured brain endothelial cells. Additional studies indicate that the higher cell migration is linked with secretion by astrocytes of CX3CL1/fractalkine, a chemokine that has chemoattractant activity for CD4(+) T cells. Moreover, we report that the enhanced cell migration across BBB leads to a more important CD4(+) T cell-mediated HIV-1 transfer toward macrophages. Altogether data presented in the present study reveal the important role that LTC4, a metabolite of , may play in the HIV-1-induced neuroinvasion, neuropathogenesis and disease progression.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we explored a time-dependent modulation of the gut mucosal  by delivering diets enriched with the green microalga (Lobosphaera incisa) either in a time-restricted regime or randomly to zebrafish (Danio rerio). The basal diet was enriched with microalgal biomass through two inclusion levels (i.e., 10% and 15% w/w), and the feeding trial lasted for six weeks. The control group was fed with the basal diet. After collection of tissue samples at week 6, the remaining fish were challenged by intraperitoneal injection of Streptococcus inaie. A histological analysis of the gut structure revealed that the fish that received the microalgae randomly exhibited shorter villi length. Genes coding for immunity were modulated in the gut by dietary treatments. Notably, the transcript levels of lysozyme, β-defensin and hepcidin were significantly higher in the group subjected to the time-restricted feeding regime. Dietary microalgae affected the fatty  content in the gut, particularly the level of  (ARA), and the time-restricted feeding influenced its accumulation. Groups that received diets enriched with 15% microalgae, regardless of the feeding strategy, displayed a significantly higher resistance to S. inaie 16 days post-infection, though differences between the delivery strategies were pronounced during the early stage of infection. In conclusion, the dietary inclusion of L. incisa modulated some of the features of the gut mucosal  of zebrafish, and the time of delivery appeared to have a considerable influence on immunomodulatory functions.Copyright © 2019.

Effects of ethanol, role of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) or of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (20-HETE) in podocytes of the glomerular filtration  have not been reported. We found that mouse podocytes at baseline generate 20-HETE and express ADH but not CYP2e1. Ethanol at high concentrations altered the actin cytoskeleton, induced CYP2e1, increased superoxide production and inhibited ADH gene expression. Ethanol at low concentrations upregulated the expression of ADH and CYP4a12a. 20-HETE, an  metabolite generated by CYP4a12a, blocked the ethanol-induced cytoskeletal derangement and superoxide generation. Ethanol at high concentration or ADH inhibitor increased glomerular albumin permeability in vitro. 20-HETE and its metabolite produced by ADH activity, 20-carboxy-, protected the glomerular permeability  against an ADH inhibitor, puromycin or FSGS permeability factor.

CM mortality has been associated with increased brain volume, seen on neuroimaging studies.To examine the potential role of blood metabolites and inflammatory mediators in increased brain volume in Malawian children with CM, an association study was performed between plasma metabolites, cytokine levels and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity with brain volume.The metabolomics analysis demonstrated  and other lysophospholipids to be positively associated with brain swelling. These lipids are products of the PLA2 enzyme and an association of plasma PLA2 enzymatic activity with brain swelling was confirmed. TNFα, which can upregulate PLA2 activity, was associated with brain volume. In addition, CCL2 and IL-8 were also associated with brain volume. Some of these cytokines can alter endothelial cell tight junction proteins and increase blood brain  permeability.Taken together, paediatric CM brain volume was associated with products of the PLA2 pathway and inflammatory cytokines. Their role in causality is unknown. These molecules will need to undergo testing in vitro and in animal models to understand their role in processes of increased brain volume.

In cultured keratinocytes, CYP2B19 mRNAs are up-regulated coordinately with those of profilaggrin, another granular cell-specific marker. We investigated effects of the CYP2B19 metabolites 11,12- and 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) on keratinocyte transglutaminase activities and cornified cell envelope formation. Keratinocytes were differentiated in vitro in the presence of biotinylated cadaverine. Transglutaminases cross-linked this substrate into endogenous proteins in situ; an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to quantify the biotinylated proteins. Exogenously added or endogenously formed 14,15-EET increased transglutaminase cross-linking activities in cultured human and mouse epidermal keratinocytes in a modified in situ assay. Transglutaminase activities increased approximately 8-fold (p < or = 0.02 versus mock control) in human keratinocytes transduced with adenovirus particles expressing a 14S,15R-EET epoxygenase (P450 BM3v). The physiological transglutaminase substrate involucrin was preferentially biotinylated in situ, determined by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry. P450 BM3v-induced transglutaminase activation was associated with increased 14,15-EET formation (p = 0.002) and spontaneous cell cornification (p < or = 0.001). Preferential involucrin biotinylation and the increased cornified cell envelope formation provided evidence that transglutaminases mediated the P450 BM3v-induced cross-linking activities. These results support a physiological role for 14,15-EET epoxygenases in regulating epidermal cornification, and they have important implications for epidermal  functions in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14597911>In vivo approaches to quantifying and imaging brain  and docosahexaenoic  metabolism.</a></h2><p>A novel in vivo fatty  method has been developed to quantify and image brain metabolism of nutritionally essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). In unanesthetized rodents, a radiolabeled PUFA is injected intravenously, and its rate of incorporation into brain phospholipids is determined by chemical analysis or quantitative autoradiography. Results indicate that about 5% of brain  (20:4 n-6) and of docosahexaenoic  (22:6 n-3)  are lost daily by metabolism and are replaced from dietary sources through the plasma. Calculated turnover rates of PUFAs in brain phospholipids, due to deesterification by phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) followed by reesterification, are very rapid, consistent with active roles of PUFAs in signal transduction and other processes. Turnover rates of arachidonate and docosahexaenoate are independent of each other and probably are regulated by independent sets of enzymes. Brain incorporation of radiolabeled arachidonate can be imaged in response to drugs that bind to receptors coupled to PLA(2) through G proteins, thus measuring PLA(2)-initiated signal transduction. The in vivo fatty method is being extended for human studies using positron emission tomography.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12878209>Expression of leukotriene C4 synthase mRNA by the choroid plexus in mouse brain suggests novel neurohormone functions of cysteinyl leukotrienes.</a></h2><p>Leukotriene C(4) is a potent mediator of allergic and inflammatory reactions, and is formed from  and glutathione through the sequential action of 5-lipoxygenase and leukotriene C(4) synthase (LTCS).

Molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this activation were examined. Role of a four-amino  PKA activation site, RGET, of hClC-2 was investigated using wild-type (WT) and mutant (AGET, RGEA, and AGAA) hClC-2 expressed in 293EBNA cells as well as involvement of PKA, intracellular cAMP concentration ([cAMP]), EP, or EP receptor agonist activity. All fatty acids [lubiprostone, cobiprostone, eicosatetraynoic  (ETYA), oleic , and elaidic ] caused significant rightward shifts in concentration-dependent Cl current activation (increasing ECs) with mutant compared with WT hClC-2 channels, without changing time and voltage dependence, current-voltage rectification, or methadone inhibition of the channel. As with lubiprostone, cobiprostone activation of hClC-2 occurred with PKA inhibitor (myristoylated protein kinase inhibitor) present or when using double PKA activation site (RRAA/RGEA) mutant. Cobiprostone did not activate human CFTR. Fatty acids did not increase [cAMP] in hClC-2/293EBNA or T84 cells. Using T84 CFTR knockdown cells, cobiprostone increased hClC-2 Cl currents without increasing [cAMP] while PGE and forskolin-IBMX increased both. Fatty acids were not agonists of EP or EP receptors. L-161,982, a supposed EP-selective inhibitor, had no effect on lubiprostone-activated hClC-2 Cl currents but significantly decreased T84 cell   measured by transepithelial resistance and fluorescent dextran transepithelial movement. The present findings show that RGET of hClC-2 (possible binding site) plays an important functional role in fatty  activation of hClC-2. PKA, [cAMP], and EP or EP receptors are not involved.

This was shown by our demonstration that pharmacological inhibition and gene deletion of cPLA₂α significantly decreased GBS invasion of the HBMEC monolayer and penetration into the brain. cPLA₂α releases  from membrane phospholipids, and we showed that the contribution of cPLA₂α to GBS invasion of HBMEC involved lipoxygenated metabolites of , cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTs). In addition, type III GBS invasion of the HBMEC monolayer involves protein kinase Cα (PKCα), as shown by time-dependent PKCα activation in response to GBS as well as decreased GBS invasion in HBMEC expressing dominant-negative PKCα. PKCα activation in response to GBS, however, was abolished by inhibition of cPLA₂α and cysteinyl LTs, suggesting that cPLA₂α and cysteinyl LTs contribute to type III GBS invasion of the HBMEC monolayer via PKCα.

The purpose of this study was to clarify the cellular uptake and binding processes of free and protein-bound unesterified DHA in retinal pigment epithelial cell (RPE) line ARPE-19 as a model of the human outer blood-retinal  and isolated porcine RPE cell fractions. Uptake of free [C]DHA by ARPE-19 cells was saturable with a Michaelis-Menten constant of 283 µM, and was significantly inhibited by eicosapentaenoic , , and linoleic , but not by oleic . Further, the uptakes of [C]DHA associated with retinol-binding protein ([C]DHA-RBP), [C]DHA associated with low-density lipoprotein ([C]DHA-LDL) and [C]DHA associated with bovine serum albumin ([C]DHA-BSA) in ARPE-19 cells increased time-dependently at 37°C, and were significantly reduced at 4°C, suggesting the involvement of energy-dependent transport processes. [C]DHA-LDL uptake by ARPE-19 cells was significantly inhibited by excess unlabeled LDL, but not by an inhibitor of scavenger receptor B type I. Fatty  transport protein (FATP) 2 and 4 mRNAs were expressed in ARPE-19 cells, and [C]DHA uptake was observed in FATP2- and FATP4-expressing Xenopus oocytes.

Understanding the mechanisms by which lipids cross the blood brain  and how they are utilized by neurons and glia is critical to understanding normal brain development and , for the diagnosis and therapy of human diseases, and for the planning and delivery of optimal human nutrition throughout the world. Two particularly important fatty acids, both of which are abundant in neuronal membranes are: (a) the omega3 polyunsaturated fatty  docosahexaenoic , deficiencies of which can impede brain development and compromise optimal brain , and (b) the omega6 polyunsaturated fatty  , which yields essential, but potentially toxic, metabolic products. There is an exciting emerging evidence that modulating dietary intake of these fatty acids could have a beneficial effect on human neurological health.

It was revealed that H2O2 at concentrations of 2 x 10(-3)--2 x 10(-2) mol/l induced disturbance of the neutrophil membrane  properties and lactate dehydrogenase release. The incubation of the neutrophils with the addition of 10(-4)--10(-7) mol/l H2O2 led to an increase in the cell ability to generate ROCS during phagocytosis and decreased neutrophil ability to secrete MPO and ROCS in extracellular medium during adhesion. The mechanisms of H2O2 effect are coupled with  metabolism. Inhibition of metabolic pathways of 5-lipoxygenase or cyclooxygenase increased the destructive effect of H2O2 on the cells. Five-lipoxygenase way prohibition led to cancellation of H2O2 influence on MPO and ROCS secretion and to enhancement of H2O2 effect on neutrophil ability to generate ROCS during phagocytosis.

Their metabolism to bioactive compounds is often up-regulated in response to cutaneous toxins thus providing them with functional roles. Some metabolites of , such as 15S-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (HETE), also serve functional roles as direct ligands for peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs). 15S-HETE, produced by 15-lipoxygenase type 2 (15-LOX-2), is an endogenous ligand for PPARgamma. This report demonstrates epidermal keratinocyte expression of both 15-LOX-2 and PPARgamma and provides evidence for a relationship beyond that of ligand-producer and -user, namely in vivo association of the two proteins at the molecular level making the enzyme a candidate nuclear receptor coregulator. Such close physical approximation of the 15S-HETE-producing enzyme and PPARgamma could potentiate the receptor response to a short-lived ligand. 15-LOX-2 may exemplify a class of enzymatically active nuclear receptor coactivator proteins distinct from those previously described but sharing their ability to promote expression from nuclear receptor-regulated promoters.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27140063>The  metabolite 11β-ProstaglandinF2α controls intestinal epithelial healing: deficiency in patients with Crohn's disease.</a></h2><p>In healthy gut enteric glial cells (EGC) are essential to intestinal epithelial  (IEB) functions.

Actually, it was labeled as a reminiscence of human development ("a living fossil with a past but no future"), and was thought to solely act as a producer of sebum, a lipid-enriched oily substance which protects our skin (and hence the body) against various insults. However, due to emerging research activities of the past two decades, it has now become evident that the sebaceous gland is not only a "passive" cutaneous "relic" to establish the physico-chemical   of the skin against constant environmental challenges, but it rather functions as an "active" neuro-immuno-endocrine cutaneous organ.

Genetic and pharmacological data point to a protective role of CB(1) and CB(2) cannabinoid receptor activation in IBD experimental models. Therefore, increasing the endogenous levels of 2-arachidonoylglycerol, the main full agonist of these receptors, should have beneficial effects on colitis. 2-Arachidonoylglycerol levels were raised in the trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS)-induced colitis mouse model by inhibiting monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), the primary enzyme responsible for hydrolysis of 2-arachidonoylglycerol, using the selective inhibitor JZL184. MAGL inhibition in diseased mice increased 2-arachidonoylglycerol levels, leading to a reduction of macroscopic and histological colon alterations, as well as of colonic expression of proinflammatory cytokines. The restored integrity of the intestinal   after MAGL inhibition resulted in reduced endotoxemia as well as reduced peripheral and brain inflammation. Coadministration of either CB(1) (SR141716A) or CB(2) (AM630) selective antagonists with JZL184 completely abolished the protective effect of MAGL inhibition on TNBS-induced colon alterations, thus demonstrating the involvement of both cannabinoid receptors. In conclusion, increasing 2-arachidonoylglycerol levels resulted in a dramatic reduction of colitis and of the related systemic and central inflammation. This could offer a novel pharmacological approach for the treatment of IBD based on the new protective role of 2-arachidonoylglycerol described here.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25939986>Modulation of stratum corneum lipid composition and organization of human skin equivalents by specific medium supplements.</a></h2><p>Our in-house human skin equivalents contain all stratum corneum (SC)  lipid classes, but have a reduced level of free fatty acids (FAs), of which a part is mono-unsaturated. These differences lead to an altered SC lipid organization and thereby a reduced   compared to human skin. In this study, we aimed to improve the SC FA composition and, consequently, the SC lipid organization of the Leiden epidermal model (LEM) by specific medium supplements. The standard FA mixture (consisting of palmitic, linoleic and  acids) supplemented to the medium was modified, by replacing protonated palmitic  with deuterated palmitic  or by the addition of deuterated arachidic  to the mixture, to determine whether FAs are taken up from the medium and are incorporated into SC of LEM. Furthermore, supplementation of the total FA mixture or that of palmitic  alone was increased four times to examine whether this improves the SC FA composition and lipid organization of LEM. The results demonstrate that the deuterated FAs are taken up into LEMs and are subsequently elongated and incorporated in their SC. However, a fourfold increase in palmitic  supplementation does not change the SC FA composition or lipid organization of LEM. Increasing the concentration of the total FA mixture in the medium resulted in a decreased level of very long chain FAs and an increased level of mono-unsaturated FAs, which lead to deteriorated SC lipid properties. These results indicate that SC lipid properties can be modulated by specific medium supplements.© 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Neutrophil homing to airspaces involve multiple factors produced by several distinct cell types. Hepoxilin A(3) is a neutrophil chemoattractant produced by pathogen-infected epithelial cells that is hypothesized to facilitate neutrophil breach of mucosal barriers. Using a Transwell model of lung epithelial barriers infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we explored the role of hepoxilin A(3) in neutrophil transepithelial migration. Pharmacological inhibitors of the enzymatic pathways necessary to generate hepoxilin A(3), including phospholipase A(2) and 12-lipoxygenase, potently interfere with P. aeruginosa-induced neutrophil transepithelial migration. Both transformed and primary human lung epithelial cells infected with P. aeruginosa generate hepoxilin A(3) precursor . All four known lipoxygenase enzymes capable of synthesizing hepoxilin A(3) are expressed in lung epithelial cell lines, primary small airway epithelial cells, and human bronchial epithelial cells. Lung epithelial cells produce increased hepoxilin A(3) and lipid-derived neutrophil chemotactic activity in response to P. aeruginosa infection. Lipid-derived chemotactic activity is soluble epoxide hydrolase sensitive, consistent with hepoxilin A(3) serving a chemotactic role. Stable inhibitory structural analogs of hepoxilin A(3) are capable of impeding P. aeruginosa-induced neutrophil transepithelial migration. Finally, intranasal infection of mice with P. aeruginosa promotes enhanced cellular infiltrate into the airspace, as well as increased concentration of the 12-lipoxygenase metabolites hepoxilin A(3) and 12-hydroxyeicosa-5Z,8Z,10E,14Z-tetraenoic . Data generated from multiple models in this study provide further evidence that hepoxilin A(3) is produced in response to lung pathogenic bacteria and functions to drive neutrophils across epithelial barriers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10391363>Severity of experimental brain injury on lactate and free fatty  accumulation and Evans blue extravasation in the rat cortex and hippocampus.</a></h2><p>Lactate and free fatty acids (FFAs) were extracted from the cortices and hippocampi of rats subjected to sham operation, or mild (1.25 atm) or moderate (2.0 atm) fluid percussion (FP) injury, and their total tissue concentrations were measured. The elevation of lactate in the injured left cortex (IC) and ipsilateral hippocampus (IH) was significantly greater in the moderate-injury than in the mild-injury group at most test times between 5 min and 48 h after injury. Levels of total FFAs were elevated in the IC and IH to a greater extent and for a longer period after injury in the moderate-injury (up to 48 h) than in the mild-injury group (up to 20 min). In general, the extent and duration of the elevation of most of the individual FFAs (palmitic, stearic, oleic, and  acids) in the IC and IH were also greater in the moderate-injury group than in the mild-injury group. In the contralateral cortex (CC) and hippocampus (CH), the elevation of lactate and total FFAs (and individual stearic and  acids) were also greater in the moderate-injury group than in the low-injury group at 5 min after injury. The extravasation of Evans blue in the IC and IH from 3 to 6 h after injury was also the greatest in the moderate-injury group. The hippocampal CA3 neuronal cell loss, but not cortical lesion volume, also increased with the severity of injury. These findings suggest that certain neurochemical, physiological (blood-brain  permeability), and morphologic responses increase with the severity of FP brain injury, and such relationships are consistent with the increased behavioral deficits observed with the increase of severity of brain injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15662832>Biochemical aspects of neurodegeneration in human brain: involvement of neural membrane phospholipids and phospholipases A2.</a></h2><p>Neural membrane phospholipids are hydrolyzed by a group of enzymes known as phospholipases. This process results in the generation of second messengers such as , eicosanoids, platelet activating factor, and diacylglycerols. High levels of these metabolites are neurotoxic and are associated with neurodegeneration. The collective evidence from many studies suggests that neural membrane phospholipid metabolism is disturbed in neural trauma and neurodegenerative diseases. This disturbance is caused by the stimulation of phospholipases A2. Stimulation of these enzymes produces changes in membrane permeability, fluidity, and alteration in ion homeostasis. Low calcium influx produces mild oxidative stress and results in neurodegeneration promoted by apoptosis, whereas a calcium overload generates high oxidative stress and causes neurodegeneration associated with necrosis. Alterations in phospholipid metabolism along with the accumulation of lipid peroxides and compromised energy metabolism may be responsible for neurodegeneration in ischemia, spinal cord trauma, head injury, and Alzheimer disease. The synthesis of phospholipases A2 inhibitors that cross the blood-brain  without harm may be useful for the treatment of acute neural trauma and neurodegenerative diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28899689>Enhanced Expression of Genes Related to Xenobiotic Metabolism in the Skin of Patients with Atopic Dermatitis but Not with Ichthyosis Vulgaris.</a></h2><p>Previous transcriptome analyses underscored the importance of immunological and skin  abnormalities in atopic dermatitis (AD). We sought to identify pathogenic pathways involved in AD by comparing the transcriptomes of AD patients stratified for filaggrin (FLG)-null mutations to those of both healthy donors and patients with ichthyosis vulgaris. We applied RNA sequencing to analyze the whole transcriptome of nonlesional skin. We found that 607 genes (476 up-regulated and 131 down-regulated by >2-fold) and 193 genes (172 up-regulated and 21 down-regulated by >2-fold) were differentially expressed when all AD or ichthyosis vulgaris patients were compared with healthy donors, respectively. Expression of genes involved in RNA/protein turnover and adenosine triphosphate synthesis, as well as genes involved in cell death, response to oxidative stress, DNA damage/repair, and autophagy, were significantly enriched in AD skin and, to a lesser extent, in ichthyosis vulgaris skin. FLG-null mutations appear to hardly interfere with current observations. Genes related to xenobiotic metabolism were up-regulated in AD skin only, as were genes related to , linoleic, and α-linolenic  metabolism. Thus, this work newly links AD pathogenesis to aberrant expression of genes related to xenobiotic metabolism.Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Although generically labeled as an "antioxidant," poor understanding of its site(s) of action is a  to its use in neurological practice. Here, we examined the efficacy and mechanism of action of NAC in rodent models of hemorrhagic stroke.Hemin was used to model ferroptosis and hemorrhagic stroke in cultured neurons. Striatal infusion of collagenase was used to model intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in mice and rats. Chemical biology, targeted lipidomics, arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5) knockout mice, and viral-gene transfer were used to gain insight into the pharmacological targets and mechanism of action of NAC.NAC prevented hemin-induced ferroptosis by neutralizing toxic lipids generated by arachidonate-dependent ALOX5 activity. NAC efficacy required increases in glutathione and is correlated with suppression of reactive lipids by glutathione-dependent enzymes such as glutathione S-transferase. Accordingly, its protective effects were mimicked by chemical or molecular lipid peroxidation inhibitors. NAC delivered postinjury reduced neuronal death and improved functional recovery at least 7 days following ICH in mice and can synergize with clinically approved prostaglandin E (PGE ).NAC is a promising, protective therapy for ICH, which acted to inhibit toxic  products of nuclear ALOX5 that synergized with exogenously delivered protective PGE in vitro and in vivo. The findings provide novel insight into a target for NAC, beyond the generic characterization as an antioxidant, resulting in neuroprotection and offer a feasible combinatorial strategy to optimize efficacy and safety in dosing of NAC for treatment of neurological disorders involving ferroptosis such as ICH.

The inflammatory mediator bradykinin (1 microM) was studied and found to induce a fall in TEER; the link between this change and intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) was then examined. 1 microM bradykinin produced a peak-plateau increase in [Ca(2+)](i). The peak showed desensitization and was dose dependent (over 0.1 nM to 1 microM). The [Ca(2+)](i) increase was blocked by the B(2) antagonist HOE 140 (1 microM) without effect from a B(1) agonist and antagonist. The plateau response was abolished in Ca(2+)-free solution containing 2 mM EDTA, and also by the Ca(2+) channel blockers lanthanum, La(3+) (10 microM), and SKF 96365 (100 microM). The store Ca(2+)ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (1 microM) abolished the peak response. The putative phospholipase C inhibitors, U73122 (20 microM) and ETH-18-OCH(3) (100 microM), unexpectedly increased [Ca(2+)](i); after their application, bradykinin was ineffective. Agents without effect on Ca(2+) responses to bradykinin included the phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) inhibitor aristolochic  (0.5 mM), cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (100 microM), 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic , NDGA (100 microM), calphostin C (0.5 microM), L-NAME (1 mM) and nifedipine (10 microM). The fall in TEER from bradykinin was blocked by HOE 140, U73122 and thapsigargin combined with La(3+), and also by aristolochic  and NDGA, but not indomethacin, calphostin C or L-NAME. U73122 increased TEER while ETH-18-OCH(3) reduced it. Thus bradykinin reduced TEER through B(2) receptor-linked release of Ca(2+) from thapsigargin-sensitive stores, leading to activation of PLA(2) and metabolism of  by 5-lipoxygenase.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21775525>Ingestion of (n-3) fatty acids augments basal and platelet activating factor-induced permeability to dextran in the rat mesenteric vascular bed.</a></h2><p>Loss of intestinal   and subsequent edema formation remains a serious clinical problem leading to hypoperfusion, anastomotic leakage, bacterial translocation, and inflammatory mediator liberation. The inflammatory mediator platelet activating factor (PAF) promotes eicosanoid-mediated edema formation and vasoconstriction. Fish oil-derived (n-3) fatty acids (FA) favor the production of less injurious eicosanoids but may also increase intestinal paracellular permeability. We hypothesized that dietary (n-3) FA would ameliorate PAF-induced vasoconstriction and enhance vascular leakage of dextran tracers. Rats were fed either an (n-3) FA-rich diet (EPA-rich diet; 4.0 g/kg EPA, 2.8 g/kg DHA) or a control diet (CON diet; 0.0 g/kg EPA and DHA) for 3 wk. Subsequently, isolated and perfused small intestines were stimulated with PAF and arterial pressure and the translocation of fluid and macromolecules from the vasculature to lumen and lymphatics were analyzed. In intestines of rats fed the EPA-rich diet, intestinal phospholipids contained up to 470% more EPA and DHA at the expense of  (AA). The PAF-induced increase in arterial pressure was not affected by the EPA-rich diet. However, PAF-induced fluid loss from the vascular perfusate was higher in intestines of rats fed the EPA-rich diet. This was accompanied by a greater basal loss of dextran from the vascular perfusate and a higher PAF-induced transfer of dextran from the vasculature to the lumen (P = 0.058) and lymphatics. Our data suggest that augmented intestinal  permeability to fluid and macromolecules is a possible side effect of (n-3) FA-rich diet supplementation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19116146>sPLA2-IIa is an inflammatory mediator when the ocular surface is compromised.</a></h2><p>sPLA2-IIa is an enzyme at high concentration in tears that has been known as an innate  of the ocular surface against microbial infection. sPLA2-IIa and other enzymes in the same protein family are known to hydrolyze fatty acids resulting in the generation of free  (AA) and lysophospholipids, which are the precursors of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators, such as PGE(2). sPLA2-IIa has been shown to be an inflammatory mediator in non-ocular inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It was also found to be increased in the tears of the patients with dry eye disease, chronic blepharitis and contact lens intolerance. However, the role of sPLA2-IIa in chronic ocular surface inflammation has yet to be determined. In the current study, we examined the potential role of sPLA2-IIa in inflammation of ocular surface diseases. Our results show that the activity of sPLA2-IIa was significantly increased in tears from dry eye disease patients compared with that from normal subjects. Also, sPLA2-IIa stimulated the production of PGE(2) in ocular surface epithelial cell cultures. The stimulating effect was markedly enhanced when the cells or tissues were pre-compromised with TNF-alpha, IL-1beta or desiccation. Furthermore, sPLA2-IIa stimulated inflammatory cytokine production in the ocular surface epithelial cell cultures in vitro. To our knowledge, this is the first report regarding the role of sPLA2-IIa as an inflammatory mediator in ocular surface inflammation. These findings indicate that sPLA2-IIa may play an important role in chronic ocular surface inflammation, especially when the ocular surface is compromised.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17719569>Role of Pterocarpus santalinus against mitochondrial dysfunction and membrane lipid changes induced by ulcerogens in rat gastric mucosa.</a></h2><p>Free radicals produced by ulcerogenic agents affect the TCA cycle enzymes located in the outer membrane of the mitochondria. Upon induction with ulcerogens, peroxidation of membrane lipids bring about alterations in the mitochondrial enzyme activity. This indicates an increase in the permeability levels of the mitochondrial membrane. The ability of PSE to scavenge the reactive oxygen species results in restoration of activities of TCA cycle enzymes. NSAIDs interfere with the mitochondrial beta-oxidation of fatty acids in vitro and in vivo, resulting in uncoupling of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation process. This usually results in diminished cellular ATP production. The recovery of gastric mucosal   through maintenance of energy metabolism results in maintenance of ATP levels, as observed in this study upon treatment with PSE. Membrane integrity altered by peroxidation is known to have a modified fatty  composition, a disruption of permeability, a decrease in electrical resistance, and increase in flip-flopping between monolayers and inactivated cross-linked proteins. The severe depletion of  in ulcer induced groups was prevented upon treatment with PSE. The  inhibitory property of the herbal extract enables the maintenance of GL activity upon treatment with PSE. The ability to prevent membrane peroxidation has been traced to the presence of active constituents in the PSE. In essence, PSE has been found to prevent mitochondrial dysfunction, provide mitochondrial cell integrity, through the maintenance of lipid bilayer by its ability to provide a hydrophobic character to the gastric mucosa, further indicating its ability to reverse the action of NSAIDs and mast cell degranulators in gastric mucosa.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11849393>Indomethacin protects permeability  from focal segmental glomerulosclerosis serum.</a></h2><p>Eicosanoids are believed to play a role in the pathophysiology of several models of glomerular disease. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin reduces proteinuria in patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) or other glomerular diseases. We have shown that sera of some patients with FSGS significantly increase glomerular albumin permeability (Palb) in an in vitro assay.To determine the role of eicosanoids in the increased Palb caused by the FSGS factor, glomeruli were isolated from normal rats, preincubated with indomethacin, then incubated with FSGS serum or normal serum and Palb was calculated. To study the direct effect of individual eicosanoids on Palb, glomeruli were incubated with prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2alpha or a thromboxane A2 mimetic, and Palb was calculated. In the final set of experiments, normal glomeruli were preincubated with the thromboxane synthase inhibitor furegrelate, incubated with FSGS serum, and Palb was calculated.Preincubation of isolated glomeruli with either the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin or the thromboxane synthase inhibitor furegrelate protected glomeruli from the increase in Palb caused by FSGS serum. Each of the three principal glomerular eicosanoids significantly increased Palb of isolated glomeruli.These studies implicate a product of the cyclooxygenase pathway of  metabolism as mediating the increased Palb caused by FSGS serum in our in vitro assay and possibly the proteinuria seen in patients with FSGS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23151067>Selective inhibition of alpha/beta-hydrolase domain 6 attenuates neurodegeneration, alleviates blood brain  breakdown, and improves functional recovery in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury.</a></h2><p>2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) is the most abundant endocannabinoid in the central nervous system and is elevated after brain injury. Because of its rapid hydrolysis, however, the compensatory and neuroprotective effect of 2-AG is short-lived. Although inhibition of monoacylglycerol lipase, a principal enzyme for 2-AG degradation, causes a robust increase of brain levels of 2-AG, it also leads to cannabinoid receptor desensitization and behavioral tolerance. Alpha/beta hydrolase domain 6 (ABHD6) is a novel 2-AG hydrolytic enzyme that accounts for a small portion of 2-AG hydrolysis, but its inhibition is believed to elevate the levels of 2-AG within the therapeutic window without causing side effect. Using a mouse model of traumatic brain injury (TBI), we found that post-insult chronic treatment with a selective ABHD6 inhibitor WWL70 improved motor coordination and working memory performance. WWL70 treatment reduced lesion volume in the cortex and neurodegeneration in the dendate gyrus. It also suppressed the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 and enhanced the expression of arginase-1 in the ipsilateral cortex at 3 and 7 days post-TBI, suggesting microglia/macrophages shifted from M1 to M2 phenotypes after treatment. The blood-brain  dysfunction at 3 and 7 days post-TBI was dramatically reduced. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of WWL70 involved up-regulation and activation of cannabinoid type 1 and type 2 receptors and were attributable to the phosphorylation of the extracellular signal regulated kinase and the serine/threonine protein kinase AKT. This study indicates that the fine-tuning of 2-AG signaling by modulating ABHD6 activity can exert anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in TBI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17233610>TRP channels activated by extracellular hypo-osmoticity in epithelia.</a></h2><p>TRP (transient receptor potential) channels comprise a superfamily of non-selective cation channels with at least seven subfamilies. The variety of subfamilies corresponds to the differences in the activation mechanisms and functions. TRPM3 (TRP melastatin 3) and TRPV4 (TRP vanilloid 3) have been characterized as cation channels activated by extracellular hypo-osmoticity. In addition, TRPV4 is activated by metabolites of  as well as alpha-isomers of phorbol esters known to be ineffective in stimulating proteins of the protein kinase C family. TRPM3 is responsive to sphingosine derivatives. The detection of splice variants with probably different activation mechanisms supports the idea that TRPM3 may have diverse cellular functions depending on the expression of a particular variant. The expression of TRPV4 in many epithelial cell types raised the question of the role of TRPV4 in epithelial . Single-cell experiments as well as approaches using epithelial layers show that multiple cellular responses are triggered by TRPV4 activation and subsequent elevation of intracellular calcium. The TRPV4-induced responses increasing transcellular ion flux as well as paracellular permeability may allow the cells to adjust to changes in extracellular osmolarity. In summary, TRPV4 plays a central role in epithelial homoeostasis by modulating epithelial  .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20106645>The very low density lipoprotein receptor is not necessary for maintaining brain polyunsaturated fatty  concentrations.</a></h2><p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), especially docosahexaenoic and  acids, as well as cholesterol are important for neural development and maintaining brain . However, in contrast to cholesterol, the brain is unable to synthesize the required amounts of these PUFA de novo and requires a constant supply from plasma. Suggested pools of uptake include plasma unesterified PUFA or the uptake of PUFA-containing lipoproteins via lipoprotein receptors into endothelial cells of the blood brain . Our study tested whether the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLr) is necessary for maintaining brain PUFA and cholesterol concentrations. Moreover, since VLDLr knockout (VLDLr(-/-)) mice have been reported to have behavioural deficits, this study asked the question whether altered brain PUFA and cholesterol concentrations might be related to these deficits. VLDLr(-/-) and wild-type mice had ad libitum access to chow. At 7 weeks of age the mice were sacrificed, and the cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, and the remainder of the brain were isolated for total fatty  and cholesterol analyses. There were no differences in total lipid PUFA or cholesterol concentrations in any of the four brain regions between VLDLr(-/-) and wild-type mice. These findings demonstrate that the VLDLr is not necessary for maintaining brain PUFA concentrations and suggest that other mechanisms to transport PUFA into the brain must exist.Copyright  2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It interacts with specific receptors in the nucleus, the retinoic  receptors (RARs). The molecular mechanism by which retinoic  mediates cellular differentiation and growth suppression in neural cells remains unknown. However, retinoic -induced release of  and its metabolites may play an important role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In brain tissue,  is mainly released by the action of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and phospholipase C (PLC)/diacylglycerol lipase pathways. We have used the model of differentiation in LA-N-1 cells induced by retinoic . The treatment of LA-N-1 cells with retinoic  produces an increase in phospholipase A2 activity in the nuclear fraction. The pan retinoic  receptor antagonist, BMS493, can prevent this increase in phospholipase A2 activity. This suggests that retinoic -induced stimulation of phospholipase A2 activity is a retinoic  receptor-mediated process. LA-N-1 cell nuclei also have phospholipase C and phospholipase D (PLD) activities that are stimulated by retinoic . Selective phospholipase C and phospholipase D inhibitors block the stimulation of phospholipase C and phospholipase D activities. Thus, both direct and indirect mechanisms of  release exist in LA-N-1 cell nuclei.  and its metabolites markedly affect the neurite outgrowth and neurotransmitter release in cells of neuronal and glial origin. We propose that retinoic  receptors coupled with phospholipases A2, C and D in the nuclear membrane play an important role in the redistribution of  in neuronal and non-nuclear neuronal membranes during differentiation and growth suppression. Abnormal retinoid metabolism may be involved in the downstream transcriptional regulation of phospholipase A2-mediated signal transduction in schizophrenia and Alzheimer disease (AD). The development of new retinoid analogs with diminished toxicity that can cross the blood-brain  without harm and can normalize phospholipase A2-mediated signaling will be important in developing pharmacological interventions for these neurological disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20826314>Neuronal activity drives localized blood-brain- transport of serum insulin-like growth factor-I into the CNS.</a></h2><p>Upon entry into the central nervous system (CNS), serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I) modulates neuronal growth, survival, and excitability. Yet mechanisms that trigger IGF-I entry across the blood-brain  remain unclear. We show that neuronal activity elicited by electrical, sensory, or behavioral stimulation increases IGF-I input in activated regions. Entrance of serum IGF-I is triggered by diffusible messengers (i.e., ATP,  derivatives) released during neurovascular coupling. These messengers stimulate matrix metalloproteinase-9, leading to cleavage of the IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3). Cleavage of IGFBP-3 allows the passage of serum IGF-I into the CNS through an interaction with the endothelial transporter lipoprotein related receptor 1. Activity-dependent entrance of serum IGF-I into the CNS may help to explain disparate observations such as proneurogenic effects of epilepsy, rehabilitatory effects of neural stimulation, and modulatory effects of blood flow on brain activity.2010 Elsevier Inc.

Adhesion molecules, cytokines and leukocyte chemoattractants released/presented at the site of blood-brain  (BBB) play an important role in mobilizing peripheral inflammatory cells into the brain. Cerebral endothelial cells (CEC) are actively engaged in processes of microvascular stasis and leukocyte infiltration by producing a plethora of pro-inflammatory mediators. When challenged by external stimuli including cytokines and hypoxia, CEC have been shown to release/express various products of  cascade with both vasoactive and pro-inflammatory properties, including prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and platelet-activating factor (PAF). These metabolites induce platelet and neutrophil activation and adhesion, changes in local cerebral blood flow and blood rheology, and increases in BBB permeability. Ischemic CEC have also been shown to express and release bioactive inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IL-1beta, IL-8 and MCP-1. Many of these mediators and ischemia in vitro and in vivo have been shown to up-regulate the expression of both selectin and Ig-families of adhesion molecules in CEC and to facilitate leukocyte adhesion and transmigration into the brain. Collectively, these studies demonstrate a pivotal role of CEC in initiating and regulating inflammatory responses in cerebral ischemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22623387>Dietary long-chain PUFA enhance acute repair of ischemia-injured intestine of suckling pigs.</a></h2><p>Infant formula companies have been fortifying formulas with long-chain PUFA for 10 y. Long-chain PUFA are precursors of prostanoids, which stimulate recovery of intestinal  . Supplementation of milk with PUFA increases the content of  (ARA) in enterocyte membranes; however, the effect of this enrichment on intestinal repair is not known. The objective of these experiments was to investigate the effect of supplemental ARA on intestinal  repair in ischemia-injured porcine ileum. One-day-old pigs (n = 24) were fed a milk-based formula for 10 d. Diets contained no PUFA (0% ARA), 0.5% ARA, 5% ARA, or 5% EPA of total fatty acids. Following dietary enrichment, ilea were subjected to in vivo ischemic injury by clamping the local mesenteric blood supply for 45 min. Following the ischemic period, control (nonischemic) and ischemic loops were mounted on Ussing chambers. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) was measured over a 240-min recovery period. Ischemia-injured ileum from piglets fed 5% ARA (61.0 ± 14%) exhibited enhanced recovery compared with 0% ARA (16 ± 14) and 0.5% ARA (22.1 ± 14)-fed pigs. Additionally, ischemia-injured ileum from 5% EPA (51.3 ± 14)-fed pigs had enhanced recovery compared with 0% ARA-fed pigs (P < 0.05). The enhanced TER recovery response observed with ischemia-injured 5% ARA supplementation was supported by a significant reduction in mucosal-to-serosal flux of (3)H-mannitol and (14)C-inulin compared with all other ischemia-injured dietary groups (P < 0.05). A histological evaluation of ischemic ilea from piglets fed the 5% ARA showed reduced histological lesions after ischemia compared with the other dietary groups (P < 0.05).

TRPV4 is a nonselective, calcium-permeable cation channel present in CP epithelia reported to be activated by cytokines and inflammatory mediators. Utilizing the PCP-R (porcine choroid plexus-Riems) cell line, we investigated the effects of various cytokines and inflammatory mediators on TRPV4-mediated activity. Select proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, TGF-β1) had inhibitory effects on TRPV4-stimulated transepithelial ion flux and permeability changes, whereas anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-4, and IL-6) had none. Quantitative mRNA analysis showed that these cytokines had no effect on TRPV4 transcription levels. Inhibition of the transcription factor NF-κB, involved in the production and regulation of several inflammatory cytokines, inhibited TRPV4-mediated activity, suggesting a link between TRPV4 and cytokine production. Contrary to published studies, the proinflammatory mediator  (AA) had inhibitory rather than stimulatory effects on TRPV4-mediated responses. However, inhibition of AA metabolism also caused inhibitory effects on TRPV4, suggesting a complex interaction of AA and its metabolites in the regulation of TRPV4 activity. Together these data imply that TRPV4 activity is involved in the inflammatory response; it is negatively affected by proinflammatory mediators. Furthermore,  metabolites, but not  itself, are positive regulators of TRPV4.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12600828>Heterogeneity of claudin expression by alveolar epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>Claudins are proteins that participate in epithelial   and regulate paracellular permeability. By immunohistochemistry of adult rat lung sections, claudin-3, claudin-4, and claudin-5 were found to be co-expressed by type II alveolar epithelial cells. Claudin-3 and claudin-4 were also co-expressed by some alveolar epithelial cells adjacent to type II cells. In contrast, claudin-5 was expressed throughout the alveolus. Isolated primary rat alveolar epithelial cells in culture also expressed claudin-3, claudin-4, and claudin-5, but showed little claudin-1 and claudin-2 expression. Claudin expression by isolated cells at both the mRNA and protein level varied with time in culture. In particular, claudin-3 and claudin-5 co-localized and were distributed around the alveolar cell periphery, but claudin-4 expression was heterogeneous. We also found that paracellular permeability was increased when cultured alveolar epithelial cells were treated with a fatty  amide, methanandamide. Methanandamide did not alter cell viability. Claudin-3, claudin-4, claudin-5, occludin, and zona occludens 1 remained localized to cell-cell contact sites at the plasma membrane in methanandamide-treated cells, suggesting that plasma membrane localization of these junction proteins is not sufficient for maintaining  . However, methanandamide-treated cells showed a 12-fold increase in claudin-5 expression and a 2- to 3-fold increase in claudin-3, consistent with the notion that specific changes in claudin expression levels may correlate with changes in alveolar epithelial  .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19371577>Prevention of seizure-induced up-regulation of endothelial P-glycoprotein by COX-2 inhibition.</a></h2><p>In the epileptic brain, seizure activity induces expression of the blood-brain  efflux transporter, P-glycoprotein, thereby limiting brain penetration and therapeutic efficacy of antiepileptic drugs. We recently provided the first evidence that seizures drive P-glycoprotein induction through a pathway that involves glutamate-signaling through the NMDA receptor and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Based on these data, we hypothesized that selective inhibition of COX-2 could prevent seizure-induced P-glycoprotein up-regulation. In the present study, we found that the highly selective COX-2 inhibitors, NS-398 and indomethacin heptyl ester, blocked the glutamate-induced increase in P-glycoprotein expression and transport  in isolated rat brain capillaries. Importantly, consistent with this, the COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, blocked seizure-induced up-regulation of P-glycoprotein expression in brain capillaries of rats in vivo. To explore further the role of COX-2 in signaling P-glycoprotein induction, we analyzed COX-2 protein expression in capillary endothelial cells in brain sections from rats that had undergone pilocarpine-induced seizures and in isolated capillaries exposed to glutamate and found no change from control levels. However, in isolated rat brain capillaries, the COX-2 substrate, , significantly increased P-glycoprotein transport activity and expression indicating that enhanced substrate flux to COX-2 rather than increased COX-2 expression drives P-glycoprotein up-regulation. Together, these results provide the first in vivo proof-of-principle that specific COX-2 inhibition may be used as a new therapeutic strategy to prevent seizure-induced P-glycoprotein up-regulation at the blood-brain  for improving pharmacotherapy of drug-resistant epilepsy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24066055>Eicosapentaenoic  enhances heat stress-impaired intestinal epithelial   in Caco-2 cells.</a></h2><p>Dysfunction of the intestinal epithelial tight junction (TJ)  is known to have an important etiologic role in the pathophysiology of heat stroke. N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), including eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), play a role in maintaining and protecting the TJ structure and . This study is aimed at investigating whether n-3 PUFAs could alleviate heat stress-induced dysfunction of intestinal tight junction.Human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells were pre-incubated with EPA, DHA or  (AA) and then exposed to heat stress. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP) permeability were measured to analyze  integrity. Levels of TJ proteins, including occludin, ZO-1 and claudin-2, were analyzed by Western blot and localized by immunofluorescence microscopy. Messenger RNA levels were determined by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR). TJ morphology was observed by transmission electron microscopy.EPA effectively attenuated the decrease in TEER and impairment of intestinal permeability in HRP flux induced by heat exposure. EPA significantly elevated the expression of occludin and ZO-1, while DHA was less effective and AA was not at all effective. The distortion and redistribution of TJ proteins, and disruption of morphology were also effectively prevented by pretreatment with EPA.This study indicates for the first time that EPA is more potent than DHA in protecting against heat-induced permeability dysfunction and epithelial  damage of tight junction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15561417>Edema and brain trauma.</a></h2><p>Brain edema leading to an expansion of brain volume has a crucial impact on morbidity and mortality following traumatic brain injury (TBI) as it increases intracranial pressure, impairs cerebral perfusion and oxygenation, and contributes to additional ischemic injuries. Classically, two major types of traumatic brain edema exist: "vasogenic" due to blood-brain  (BBB) disruption resulting in extracellular water accumulation and "cytotoxic/cellular" due to sustained intracellular water collection. A third type, "osmotic" brain edema is caused by osmotic imbalances between blood and tissue. Rarely after TBI do we encounter a "hydrocephalic edema/interstitial" brain edema related to an obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid outflow. Following TBI, various mediators are released which enhance vasogenic and/or cytotoxic brain edema. These include glutamate, lactate, H(+), K(+), Ca(2+), nitric oxide,  and its metabolites, free oxygen radicals, histamine, and kinins. Thus, avoiding cerebral anaerobic metabolism and acidosis is beneficial to control lactate and H(+), but no compound inhibiting mediators/mediator channels showed beneficial results in conducted clinical trials, despite successful experimental studies. Hence, anti-edematous therapy in TBI patients is still symptomatic and rather non-specific (e.g. mannitol infusion, controlled hyperventilation). For many years, vasogenic brain edema was accepted as the prevalent edema type following TBI. The development of mechanical TBI models ("weight drop," "fluid percussion injury," and "controlled cortical impact injury") and the use of magnetic resonance imaging, however, revealed that "cytotoxic" edema is of decisive pathophysiological importance following TBI as it develops early and persists while BBB integrity is gradually restored. These findings suggest that cytotoxic and vasogenic brain edema are two entities which can be targeted simultaneously or according to their temporal prevalence.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25898179>Glutamate-Mediated Down-Regulation of the Multidrug-Resistance Protein BCRP/ABCG2 in Porcine and Human Brain Capillaries.</a></h2><p>Breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) functions as a major molecular gatekeeper at the blood-brain . Considering its impact on access to the brain by therapeutic drugs and harmful xenobiotics, it is of particular interest to elucidate the mechanisms of its regulation. Excessive glutamate concentrations have been reported during epileptic seizures or as a consequence of different brain insults including brain ischemia. Previously, we have demonstrated that glutamate can trigger an induction of the transporter P-glycoprotein. These findings raised the question whether other efflux transporters are affected in a comparable manner. Glutamate exposure proved to down-regulate BCRP transport  and expression in isolated porcine capillaries. The reduction was efficaciously prevented by coincubation with N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist MK-801. The involvement of the NMDA receptor in the down-regulation of BCRP was further confirmed by experiments showing an effect of NMDA exposure on brain capillary BCRP transport  and expression. Pharmacological targeting of cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 (COX-1 and -2) using the nonselective inhibitor indomethacin, COX-1 inhibitor SC-560, and COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib revealed a contribution of COX-2 activity to the NMDA receptor's downstream signaling events affecting BCRP. Translational studies were performed using human capillaries isolated from surgical specimens of epilepsy patients. The findings confirmed a glutamate-induced down-regulation of BCRP transport activity in human capillaries, which argued against major species differences. In conclusion, our data reveal a novel mechanism of BCRP down-regulation in porcine and human brain capillaries. Moreover, together with previous data sets for P-glycoprotein, the findings point to a contrasting impact of the signaling pathway on the regulation of BCRP and P-glycoprotein. The effect of glutamate and  signaling on BCRP  might have implications for brain drug delivery and for radiotracer brain access in epilepsy patients and patients with other brain insults.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27362730>Cancer cell-derived 12(S)-HETE signals via 12-HETE receptor, RHO, ROCK and MLC2 to induce lymph endothelial  breaching.</a></h2><p>The  metabolite 12(S)-HETE is suspected to enhance metastatic spread by inducing cancer cell- and lymph endothelial cell (LEC) motility. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to 12(S)-HETE-triggered cell migration are still elusive.To delineate the signalling pathways involved in 12(S)-HETE-mediated migration, inhibitors against RHO and ROCK, and specific siRNAs downregulating 12(S)-HETE receptor (12-HETER) and myosin light chain 2 (MLC2) were used. The breaching of the endothelial  was investigated by an assay measuring tumour spheroid-triggered 'circular chemorepellent-induced defects' (CCIDs), and respective signal transduction was elucidated by western blotting.We provide evidence that 12(S)-HETE phosphorylated (and activated) MLC2, which regulates actin/myosin-based contraction. MLC2 activation was found to be essential for LEC retraction and CCID formation. Furthermore, we show that 12(S)-HETE activated a 12-HETER-RHO-ROCK-MYPT signalling cascade to induce MLC2 .Signalling via this pathway is described for this metabolite for the first time. This may provide potential targets for the intervention of metastatic colonisation.</p></html>
