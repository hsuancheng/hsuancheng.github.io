We measured changes in the proteome associated with bacterially induced intestinal inflammation in the interleukin 10 gene-deficient (Il10(-/-)) mouse model of IBD, established effects of the dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) n-3 eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and n-6  (AA) on protein expression (using oleic  as a control fatty ), and compared these changes with previously observed transcriptome changes in the same model. Ingenuity pathways analysis of proteomics data showed bacterially induced inflammation was associated with reduced expression of proteins from pathways of metabolism and digestion/absorption/excretion of nutrients/ions, and increased expression of cellular stress and immune response proteins. Both PUFA treatments showed anti- activity; EPA appeared to act via the PPARα pathway, whereas AA appeared to increase energy metabolism and cytoskeletal organization and reduce cellular stress responses, possibly enabling a more robust response to inflammation. While there was agreement between proteomic and transcriptomic data with respect to pathways, there was limited concordance between individual gene and protein data, reflecting the importance of having both gene and protein data to better understand complex  such as IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15662752>[Cytokines, prostaglandins, nutritive and non-nuitritive factors in ].</a></h2><p>Therapeutic interventions in the case of gastrointestinal  are based on the understanding of the role of different  mediators. Reactive O2 and N2 metabolites are involved in IBD. Pro- cytokines, apoptosis signalling and redox-response transcription factors are depended on free radicals. NO activates COX enzymes. PGE2 negatively modulates induction of NO synthase by interleukins and therefore regulation of gastric mucosal integrity by endogenous NO depends on  cascade. PG-s have pro- and anti- effects on the immune system. Dietary PUFA-s and eicosanoids have potential effects on the modulation of  processes and immune cells. The cholesterol level lowering activity of several cytokines and colony stimulating factor can be observed. Therapeutic efficacy of N-3 PUFA is described in cases of patients with chronic gastrointestinal disorders, but N-3 PUFA-s only delay early relapse of ulcerative colitis in remission. TNF is known as a pleiotropic cytokine. Strategies for TNF in IBD is very important part of therapeutical approaches. Therapy with infliximab and related ones are encouraging in critical cases. It is also believed recently, that NF-kappaB also may be a target of IBD treatment. It became known, that oxidized LDL can inhibit LPS-induced binding of the NF-kappaB to DNA and the subsequent expression of TNF-alpha and interleukin-1beta in macrophages as well as oxidized LDL modulates activation of NF-kappaB in mononuclear phagocytes by altering the degradation of I-kappaBs. 15-d-PGJ2 inhibits multiple steps in the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. 15-d-PGJ2 metabolite binds PPAR-gamma promotes adipocyte differentiation. PPAR-gamma ligand inhibits growth of cells through induction of apoptosis. Several nutritional polyphenols (the secondary metabolites of plants) are COX2 and/or LOX inhibitors and iNOS activators. The moderate nutritional customs with natural antioxidants can help restore to normal function of gastrointestinal tract, but the immoderate consumption of vitamins and polyphenol type antioxidant molecules is contraindicated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22765297>Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and  processes: nutrition or pharmacology?</a></h2><p>Eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) are n-3 fatty acids found in oily fish and fish oil supplements. These fatty acids are able to inhibit partly a number of aspects of inflammation including leucocyte chemotaxis, adhesion molecule expression and leucocyte-endothelial adhesive interactions, production of eicosanoids like prostaglandins and leukotrienes from the n-6 fatty  , production of  cytokines and T cell reactivity. In parallel, EPA gives rise to eicosanoids that often have lower biological potency than those produced from arachidonioc  and EPA and DHA give rise to anti- and inflammation resolving resolvins and protectins. Mechanisms underlying the anti- actions of n-3 fatty acids include altered cell membrane phospholipid fatty  composition, disruption of lipid rafts, inhibition of activation of the pro- transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B so reducing expression of  genes, activation of the anti- transcription factor NR1C3 (i.e. peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ) and binding to the G protein coupled receptor GPR120. These mechanisms are interlinked. In adult humans, an EPA plus DHA intake greater than 2 g day⁻¹ seems to be required to elicit anti- actions, but few dose finding studies have been performed. Animal models demonstrate benefit from n-3 fatty acids in rheumatoid arthritis (RA),  (IBD) and asthma. Clinical trials of fish oil in patients with RA demonstrate benefit supported by meta-analyses of the data. Clinical trails of fish oil in patients with IBD and asthma are inconsistent with no overall clear evidence of efficacy.© 2012 The Author.

Large retrospective and prospective population-based studies have shown that the use of both nonselective, nonsteroidal anti- drugs and selective COX-2 inhibitors are associated with decreased colorectal cancer incidence and mortality rate. A majority of animal studies provide strong evidence that prevention of intestinal tumors is more efficiently accomplished by COX-2 selective inhibition rather than by COX-1 suppression. The inducible COX-2 isoform is overexpressed in colorectal tissues and is associated with critical events of tumorigenesis. COX-2 expression correlates with expression of angiogenic factors and new blood vessel formation. Inhibition of COX-2 favors apoptosis and causes a dose-dependent decline of tumor growth and metastasis in these models. These data, together with the fact that COX-2 inhibitors cause less toxic side effects compared with nonselective nonsteroidal anti- drugs, render these new compounds promising candidates in chemoprevention and treatment of colorectal cancer. Results from initial clinical trials suggest that COX-2 inhibitors may be able to reduce the polyp burden in patients with familial polyposis coli. However, further clinical studies are needed to evaluate whether COX-2 inhibition will be effective in all types of colorectal tumor tissues. This is especially true for neoplastic lesions that express COX-2 at a lower level (eg, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer) and for colorectal tumors of patients with . In summary, COX-2 inhibitors represent a new and very promising group of chemotherapeutic agents with great potential for both colorectal cancer prevention and treatment.Copyright 2003 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study, accordingly, was to investigate the role of phospholipid metabolism in the intestinal mucosa in  (IBD). Surgically resected specimens from patients with Crohn's  (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and colrectal cancer (non-cancerous tissue; as a control) were submitted to phospholipid analysis and a PLase A2 assay, which measures the degradation of endogenous mucosal phospholipids. A high percentage of plasmenylethanolamine (plas.E) was detected in the glycerophospholipid fraction of CD mucosa. The  content of the phosphatidylethanolamine plus plas.E subfraction was higher in inflamed than in intact mucosa in CD. PLaseA2 activity, resulting in lysophosphatidyl ethanolamine production, was detected only in inflamed mucosa from CD and UC patients, but not in normal mucosa from controls. PLaseA2 activity was highest in moderately inflamed mucosa adjacent to a severely ulcerated area. The PLaseA2 that reacts with endogenous phosphatidylcholine (PC) to form lysoPC was found irrespective of the presence of inflammation. The PLaseA2 that reacts with ethanolamine-containing phospholipids is more closely related to inflammation than other PLaseA2 isoenzymes in IBD mucosa.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16437657>Usefulness of omega-3 fatty  supplementation in addition to mesalazine in maintaining remission in pediatric Crohn's : a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.</a></h2><p>To assess the value of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) supplementation in addition to amino-salicylic- (5-ASA) in pediatric patients with Crohn's  (CD).Thirty-eight patients (20 males and 18 females, mean age 10.13 years, range 5-16 years) with CD in remission were randomized into two groups and treated for 12 mo. Group I (18 patients) received 5-ASA (50 mg/kg/d)+ omega-3 FAs as triglycerides in gastro-resistant capsules, 3 g/d (eicosapentanoic , EPA, 400 mg/g, docosahexaenoic , DHA, 200 mg/g).

We present here a genetic deficiency of eicosanoid biosynthesis that illuminates the mechanism of NSAID-induced ulcers of the small intestine.Eicosanoids and metabolites were measured by isotope dilution with mass spectrometry. cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription and sequenced following amplification with RT-PCR.We investigated the cause of chronic recurrent small intestinal ulcers, small  perforations, and gastrointestinal blood loss in a 45-year-old man who was not taking any cyclooxygenase inhibitor. Prostaglandin metabolites in urine were significantly depressed. Serum thromboxane B2 (TxB2) production was 4.6% of normal controls (P<0.006), and serum 12-HETE was 1.3% of controls (P<0.005).

LTB4 biosynthesis by ionophore-activated leukocytes was only 3% of controls, and urinary LTE4 was undetectable. These findings suggested deficient AA release from membrane phospholipids by cytosolic phospholipase A2-alpha (cPLA2-alpha), which regulates cyclooxygenase- and lipoxygenase-mediated eicosanoid production by catalyzing the release of their substrate, AA. Sequencing of cPLA2-alpha cDNA demonstrated two heterozygous nonsynonymous single-base-pair mutations: Ser111Pro (S111P) and Arg485His (R485H), as well as a known single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), Lys651Arg (K651R).Characterization of this cPLA2-alpha deficiency provides support for the importance of prostaglandins in protecting small intestinal integrity and indicates that loss of prostaglandin biosynthesis is sufficient to produce small intestinal ulcers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18048478>5-Lipoxygenase-derived lipid mediators are not required for the development of NSAID-induced  in IL-10-/- mice.</a></h2><p>Leukotrienes are potent lipid mediators derived from the metabolism of  by the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO). Elevated levels of the proinflammatory leukotriene LTB(4) have been found in preclinical models of  (IBD) as well as in colon tissue from individuals with IBD. We therefore determined the extent to which absence of 5-LO-derived lipid mediators would alter the colitis in IL-10(-/-) mice, a model of human IBD. IL-10(-/-)/5-LO(-/-) mice were generated and were healthy. Absence of 5-LO did not alter the development of spontaneous colitis in IL-10-deficient mice. We then evaluated the extent to which absence of 5-LO would alter the development of NSAID-induced colitis in IL-10(-/-) mice. Absence of 5-LO did not delay the onset or alter the severity of inflammation in NSAID-treated IL-10(-/-) mice. At an early time point, 3 days after NSAID treatment was initiated, a qualitative increase in the number of dendritic cells and CD4(+) T cells was noted in the colons of IL-10(-/-)/5-LO(-/-); however, this difference was no longer present after 14 days of NSAID treatment. Absence of 5-LO did not alter the degree of neutrophil infiltration into the in this model. Absence of 5-LO does not alter the development of IFN-gamma producing Th1-type CD4(+) T cells or IL-17 producing CD4(+) T cells. Absence of 5-LO-derived mediators did not alter the expression of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and P-selectin. Development of colitis in IL-10(-/-) mice was associated with increased levels of the 5-LO-derived anti- lipoxin LXA(4).

ToF-SIMS was used to obtain mass spectra and chemical maps from the mucosal surface of human normal (NC), inflamed (IC), and dysplastic (DC) colon tissues. Chemical mapping with a lateral resolution of ≈ 1 μm allowed to evaluate zonation of fatty acids and amino acids as well as the morphological condition of the intestinal glands. High mass resolution ToF-SIMS spectra showed chemical differences in lipid and amino  composition as a function of pathological state. In positive ion mode, mono- (MAG), di- (DAG), and triacylglycerol (TAG) signals were detected in NC tissues, while in IC and DC tissues, the only cholesterol was present as lipid class representative. Signals from fatty acids, collected in negative ion mode, were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA). PCA showed a strict correlation between IC and DC samples, due to an increase of stearic, , and linoleic . In the same way, differences in the amino  composition were highlighted through multivariate analysis. PCA revealed that glutamic , leucine/isoleucine, and valine fragments are related to IC tissues. On the other hand, tyrosine, methionine, and tryptophan peaks contributed highly to the separation of DC tissues. Finally, a classification of NC, IC, and DC patients was also achieved through hierarchical cluster analysis of amino  fragments. In this case, human colonic inflammation showed a stronger relationship with normal than dysplastic condition.

COX-1 is constitutively expressed and is a critical housekeeping gene, whereas COX-2 is rapidly upregulated by growth factors and cytokines and thus responsible for inflammation. COX-2 is frequently overexpressed in colonic adenoma and carcinoma. Specific inhibitors of COX-2 have been shown to induce apoptosis in tumor cells and to inhibit tumor growth in animal models and in humans. Long-standing IBD patients have increased risk of developing colorectal cancer compared to general population. IBD-associated colorectal carcinogenesis is probably promoted by chronic inflammation and closely related to COX-2. In a recent study, powerful chemopreventive ability of selective COX-2 inhibitor was observed in colitis-related colon carcinogenesis in mouse model. But it was reported that even selective COX inhibitors aggravated the DSS-induced colonic inflammation. It is assumed that endogenous PGs are involved in the mucosal defense against DSS-induced colonic ulcerations which are produced by COX-1 at early phase and by COX-2 at late phase. Long-term use of COX-2 inhibitors for the chemoprevention of colitic cancer is needed to define their mechanism of action, that reduce side effects and have specific tumor target.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24151379>Concepts of oxidative stress and antioxidant defense in Crohn's .</a></h2><p>Oxygen free radical and lipid peroxides (oxidative stress) are highly reactive and represent very damaging compounds. Oxidative stress could be a major contributing factor to the tissue injury and fibrosis that characterize Crohn's . An imbalance between increased reactive oxygen species levels and decreased antioxidant defenses occurs in Crohn's patients. Decreased blood levels of vitamins C and E and decreased intestinal mucosal levels of CuZn superoxide dismutase, glutathione, vitamin A, C, E, and β-carotene have been reported for Crohn's patients. Increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1 and -8 and tumor necrosis factor, have been detected in . Oxidative stress significantly increased the production of neutrophils, chemokines, and interleukin-8. These effects were inhibited by antioxidant vitamins and  metabolite inhibitors in human intestinal smooth muscle cells isolated from the bowels of Crohn's  patients. The main pathological feature of Crohn's  is an infiltration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils and mononuclear cells into the affected part of the intestine. Activated neutrophils produce noxious substances that cause inflammation and tissue injury. Due to the physiological and biochemical actions of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxides, many of the clinical and pathophysiological features of Crohn's  might be explained by an imbalance of increased reactive oxygen species and a net decrease of antioxidant molecules. This review describes the general concepts of free radical, lipid peroxide and antioxidant activities and eventually illustrates their interferences in the development of Crohn's strictures.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21425210>Enteral feeding therapy for newly diagnosed pediatric Crohn's : a double-blind randomized controlled trial with two years follow-up.</a></h2><p>This study compared the efficacy of an elemental formula (EF) to a polymeric formula (PF) in inducing remission for pediatric Crohn's  (CD).Newly diagnosed CD children were randomized to EF or PF for 6 weeks.

Lower rates of production of PGE2 and IFN-gamma by PBMC were noted in quiescent and active CD, respectively, compared to controls.CD is associated with a greater availability, and not a deficiency, of n-3 PUFA in PBMC, but lower concentrations of AA, and lower rates of production of PGE2 and IFN-gamma, compared to healthy controls.Copyright 2003 Elsevier Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18340649>Role for epithelial dysregulation in early-onset colitis-associated colon cancer in Gi2-alpha-/- mice.</a></h2><p> (IBD) is a risk factor for developing colorectal cancer but the mechanisms are poorly characterized. Mice lacking the G-protein alpha subunit Gi2-alpha spontaneously develop colitis and colon cancer with high penetrance. Compared to canonical Wnt/APC signaling-based animal models of colon cancer, the tumors in Gi2-alpha-/- mice more closely recapitulate the features of IBD-associated cancers seen in humans. They are predominantly right-sided, multifocal, mucinous, and arise from areas of flat dysplasia.In evaluating the potential contribution of epithelial Gi2-alpha signaling to this phenotype, we found that Gi2-alpha-/- colonic epithelium is hyperproliferative even before the onset of colitis, and resistant to the induction of apoptosis. We generated colon cancer cell lines overexpressing dominant-negative Gi2-alpha.Like other cells lacking Gi2-alpha, these cells release less , an important antiinflammatory and epithelial growth regulator. They are also hyperproliferative and resistant to camptothecin-induced apoptosis and caspase-3 activation.The colitis-associated cancers in Gi2-alpha-/- mice appear very similar to those seen in human IBD patients, and Gi2-alpha is a direct negative regulator of colonic epithelial cell growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11805219>Pharmacological characterization of SC-57461A (3-[methyl[3-[4-(phenylmethyl)phenoxy]propyl]amino]propanoic  HCl), a potent and selective inhibitor of leukotriene A(4) hydrolase I: in vitro studies.</a></h2><p>Leukotriene (LT) B(4) is an  mediator that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various , including  and psoriasis.

We therefore genotyped this single-nucleotide polymorphism in the Nurses' Health Study 2 and Harvard Women's Health Study. Similar results were observed in these subsequent analyses, with no statistically significant heterogeneity in risk estimates between studies.

We investigated the profile of polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) metabolites produced by EGCs from rats and from patients with Crohn's disease (CD), compared with controls, along with the ability of one of these metabolites, 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (15-HETE), to regulate the permeability of the IEB.We isolated EGCs from male Sprague-Dawley rats, intestinal resections of 6 patients with CD, and uninflamed healthy areas of intestinal tissue from 6 patients who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer (controls). EGC-conditioned media was analyzed by high-sensitivity liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to determine PUFA signatures. We used immunostaining to identify 15-HETE-producing enzymes in EGCs and tissues. The effects of human EGCs and 15-HETE on permeability and transepithelial electrical resistance of the IEB were measured using Caco-2 cells; effects on signal transduction proteins were measured with immunoblots. Levels of proteins were reduced in Caco-2 cells using short-hairpin RNAs or proteins were inhibited pharmacologically. Rats were given intraperitoneal injections of 15-HETE or an inhibitor of 15-lipoxygenase (the enzyme that produces 15-HETE); colons were collected and permeability was measured.EGCs expressed 15-lipoxygenase-2 and produced high levels of 15-HETE, which increased IEB resistance and reduced IEB permeability. 15-HETE production was reduced in EGCs from patients with CD compared with controls. EGCs from patients with CD were unable to reduce the permeability of the IEB; the addition of 15-HETE restored permeability to levels of control tissues. Inhibiting 15-HETE production in rats increased the permeability of the IEB in colon tissues. We found that 15-HETE regulates IEB permeability by inhibiting an adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and increasing expression of zonula occludens-1.Enteric glial cells from patients with CD have reduced production of 15-HETE, which controls IEB permeability by inhibiting adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and increasing expression of zonula occludens-1.Copyright © 2016 AGA Institute.

Seal and fish oils are rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and possibly therefore high doses of nasoduodenally administered seal oil rapidly relieved  (IBD)-associated joint pain in two recent studies. In the present study, we compared the effects of short-term oral administration of seal oil and cod liver oil on IBD-related joint pain, leucotriene B(4) level, serum fatty  profile and IBD activity.Thirty-eight patients with IBD-related joint pain were included in the study; 21 had Crohn's  and 17 ulcerative colitis. Ten milliters of seal oil (n=18) or cod liver oil (n=20) was self-administered orally 3 times a day for 14 days before meals in a double-blind setting.There were no significant differences between the two intervention groups or between Crohn's  and ulcerative colitis patients. There was a tendency toward improvement in several joint pain parameters after both seal oil and cod liver oil administration. Further, plasma leucotriene B(4) concentration, serum Sigma n-6 to Sigma n-3, and  (20:4n-6) to eicosapentaenoic  (20:5n-3) ratios were similarly reduced after administration of seal oil and cod liver oil.No significant differences in the two treatment groups were seen; in both groups, the changes in several joint pain parameters, leucotriene B(4) level of plasma, and serum fatty  profile were putatively favourable.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9215866>Production of  metabolites by the colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT29 cl.19A and their effect on chloride secretion.</a></h2><p>Eicosanoids were found in large amounts in the colonic mucosa of patients suffering from  and colonic adenocarcinoma.

Nutrients are able to elicit and affect both systemic and mucosal immune responses. Enteral diet therapy has long been known to be efficacious in  (IBD), particularly in childhood Crohn's . However, the mechanisms of action of these diets are not clear. Nutritional repletion, direct effects on the gut mucosa or decreased intestinal permeability have all been postulated as being important in nutritional therapy. There is some evidence that the enteral diet has a direct effect on the gut mucosa by reducing cytokine production and the accompanying inflammation, thus leading to decreased intestinal permeability. Modifications of enteral diet composition have been evaluated in many studies. Such modifications include fat and/or protein content and the addition of bioactive peptides. The fatty  composition of the enteral diet seems to have a much greater impact on its efficacy than modification of the N source. As specific fatty acids are precursors of  mediators derived from , the reduction in these components may be beneficial in nutritional therapy for IBD. Addition of bioactive peptides to enteral diet formulas may also have a role; such peptides may have specific growth factor or anti- actions. There is still much work to be done to define -specific enteral diet formulas that are effective as therapies for both Crohn's  and ulcerative colitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18493729>Targeting endocannabinoid degradation protects against experimental colitis in mice: involvement of CB1 and CB2 receptors.</a></h2><p>The endocannabinoid (EC) system mediates protection against intestinal inflammation. In this study, we investigated the effects of blocking EC degradation or cellular reuptake in experimental colitis in mice. Mice were treated with trinitrobenzene-sulfonic  in presence and absence of the fatty  amide hydrolase (FAAH) blocker URB597, the EC membrane transport inhibitor VDM11, and combinations of both. Inflammation was significantly reduced in the presence of URB597, VDM11, or both as evaluated by macroscopic damage score, myeloperoxidase levels, and colon length. These effects were abolished in CB(1)- and CB(2)-receptor-gene-deficient mice. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction after induction of experimental colitis by different pathways showed that expression of FAAH messenger RNA (mRNA) is significantly reduced in different models of inflammation early in the expression of colitis, and these return to control levels as the  progresses. Genomic DNA from 202 patients with Crohn's  (CD) and 206 healthy controls was analyzed for the C385A polymorphism in the FAAH gene to address a possible role in humans. In our groups, the C385A polymorphism was equally distributed in patients with CD and healthy controls. In conclusion, drugs targeting EC degradation offer therapeutic potential in the treatment of .

Recent studies have shown that the polymorphism locus in the promoter region of  gene affects LTB4 expression level and the susceptibility to extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Thus, we identified a total of 148 patients with intestinal tuberculosis, 145 with Crohn's disease, and 700 normal controls in this study.All the study participants were local Han people from Jiangxi Province in the past eleven years. DNA was extracted from the paraffin-embedded specimens or the whole blood. The  promoter SNP (rs17525495) was genotyped with TaqMan assay.The T-alleles frequency was not significantly increased in patients with intestinal tuberculosis compared with healthy control group (=0.630; OR=1.07; 95%CI=0.81-1.41), while patients with Crohn's disease have significantly increased T allele frequency compared with healthy population (=0.032; OR=1.34; 95%CI=1.03-1.75). During treatment, the presence of the T allele significantly increased the proportion of Crohn's patients requiring glucocorticoids (<0.05).The T allele of  gene SNP (rs17525495) is a risk factor for Crohn's disease instead of intestinal tuberculosis.

The events induced by  mediators lead to dysregulated activation and induction of  genes such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). COX-2 is involved in the conversion of  to biologically active prostanoids and is highly upregulated in colon cancer. Since inflammation-induced changes to the extracellular matrix could affect integrin activities, we here investigated the effect of integrin signalling on the level of COX-2 expression in the non-transformed intestinal epithelial cell lines, Int 407 and IEC-6. Adhesion of these cells to a collagen I- or IV-coated surface, increased surface expression of alpha2beta1 integrin. Activation of integrins with collagen caused an increased cox-2 promoter activity, with a subsequent increase in COX-2 expression. The signalling cascade leading to this increased expression and promoter activity of cox-2, involves PKCalpha, the small GTPase Ras and NFkappaB but not Erk1/2 or Src activity. The integrin-induced increase in cellular COX-2 activity is responsible for an elevated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased cell migration. This signalling pathway suggests a mechanism whereby inflammation-induced modulations of the ECM, can promote cancer transformation in the intestinal epithelial cells.(c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19954361>Fatty acids and immune function: relevance to .</a></h2><p>Fatty acids may influence immune function through a variety of mechanisms; many of these are associated with changes in fatty  composition of immune cell membranes.

A Review.</a></h2><p>Chronic inflammation takes part in the pathogenesis of some malignancies of the gastrointestinal tract including colorectal (CRC), gastric, and esophageal cancers. The use of ω3 polyunsaturated fatty  (ω3-PUFA) supplements for chemoprevention or adjuvant therapy of gastrointestinal cancers is being investigated in recent years. Most evidence has been reported in CRC, although their protective role has also been reported for -induced gastric cancer or Barrett's esophagus-derived adenocarcinoma. Studies based on ω3-PUFA supplementation in animal models of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and CRC revealed positive effects on cancer prevention, reducing the number and size of tumors, down-regulating -derived eicosanoids, upregulating anti-oxidant enzymes, and reducing lipid peroxidation, whereas contradictory results have been found in induced  and -associated cancer. Beneficial effects have also been found in FAP and ulcerative  patients. Of special interest is their positive effect as adjuvants on radio- and chemo-sensitivity, specificity, and prevention of treatment complications. Some controversial results obtained in CRC might be justified by different dietary sources, extraction and preparation procedures of ω3-PUFAs, difficulties on filling out food questionnaires, daily dose and type of PUFAs, adenoma subtype, location of CRC, sex differences, and genetic factors.

Thus, it has been postulated that control of lipid mediators production by inhibition of PLA2 would be useful for the treatment of IBD. This hypothesis has been tested in the present study by examining the therapeutic effect of a novel natural probitic Bacillus subtilis PB6 (ATCC- PTA 6737). B. subtilis PB6 is found to secrete surfactins (cyclic lipopeptides) which have anti-bacterial potential. These surfactins inhibit PLA2, a rate-limiting enzyme involved in the  associated  pathway and could downregulate the  response by regulating the eicosanoid and cytokine pathways. With this concept, an experimental animal trial has been conducted in a rat model of 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS)-induced colitis. The oral administration of PB6 suppresses the colitis as measured by mortality rate, changes in the weight gain, colon morphology and the levels of plasma cytokines. The animals treated orally with PB6 at 1.5 x 10(8) CFU/kg thrice daily from day 4 to 10 significantly improve gross pathology of the colon and regain the colon weight to normal (p < 0.05), compared to TNBS-induced positive control. The plasma levels of pro- cytokines (TNF-alpha, 1L-1beta, IL-6 and IFN-gamma) are also significantly lowered (p < 0.05) and anti- cytokine (IL-I0 and TGF-beta) significantly (p < 0.05) increased after the oral administration of PB6 on day 11. The present study supports the concept that PB6 inhibits PLA2 by the secreting surfactins.

This overview focuses on the role of eicosanoid receptors in the maintenance of intestinal epithelium physiology through the control of proliferation/differentiation/apoptosis processes. Furthermore, it is reported that the role of these receptors on the regulation of the barrier function of the intestinal epithelium have arisen through the regulation of absorption/secretion processes, tight-junction state and the control of the intestinal immune response.

Currently, biopsies are the most used diagnostic tests for these diseases and metabolomics could represent a less invasive approach to identify biomarkers of disease presence and progression.The lipid and the polar metabolite profile of plasma samples of patients affected by inflammatory bowel disease have been compared with healthy individuals with the aim to find their metabolomic differences. Also, a selected sub-set of samples was analysed following solid phase extraction to further characterise differences between pathological samples.A total of 200 plasma samples were analysed using drift tube ion mobility coupled with time of flight mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography for the lipid metabolite profile analysis, while liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry was used for the polar metabolite profile analysis.Variations in the lipid profile between inflammatory bowel disease and healthy individuals were highlighted. Phosphatidylcholines, lyso-phosphatidylcholines and fatty acids were significantly changed among pathological samples suggesting changes in phospholipase A and  metabolic pathways. Variations in the levels of cholesteryl esters and glycerophospholipids were also found.

The contributions of both nitric oxide (NO) and endothelial-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) are decreased. We hypothesized that the remaining dilation results from products of cyclooxygenase.High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to isolate eicosanoid vasodilator products and videomicroscopy was used to examine vasomotor responses in human mucosal arterioles from subjects with or without IBD undergoing  resection surgeries. In subjects without IBD, Ach constricted (-52%+/-10%) arterioles devoid of endothelium. Indomethacin (INDO) (cyclooxygenase inhibitor) had no effect. In contrast, Ach dose-dependently dilated both intact and endothelial denuded arterioles from patients with IBD. The dilation was converted to constriction by INDO (-54%+/-9%; P<0.05 versus non-IBD) or by BWA868C (PGD2 receptor antagonist). Only in arterioles from subjects with IBD did Ach produce an  metabolite that comigrated on HPLC with PG D2 (PGD2). Exogenous PGD2 dilated (max=66%+/-4%) IBD arterioles.In arterioles from IBD patients, Ach-mediated dilation shifts from endothelial production of NO and EDHF to nonendothelial generation of a PG, likely PGD2.

However, it is not known whether endocannabinoids are up-regulated during IBDs in animals or humans, nor whether pharmacological elevation of endocannabinoid levels can be exploited therapeutically in these disorders. In this study we addressed these questions. Colon inflammation was induced in mice and rats with 2,4-dinitrobenzene- and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acids (DNBS and TNBS), respectively. DNBS-treated mice were treated chronically (for 3 or 7 days) with inhibitors of anandamide enzymatic hydrolysis (N-arachidonoyl-serotonin, AA-5-HT) or reuptake (VDM11), 10 or 5 mg/kg, s.c., or with 5-amino-salicilic  (5-ASA, 1.4 mg/kg, i.r.). Endocannabinoids (anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol, 2-AG) were quantified in mouse colon, or in rat colon mucosa and submucosa, and in bioptic samples from the colon of patients with untreated ulcerative colitis, by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. A strong elevation of anandamide, but not 2-AG, levels was found in the colon of DNBS-treated mice, in the colon submucosa of TNBS-treated rats, and in the biopsies of patients with ulcerative colitis. VDM-11 significantly elevated anandamide levels in the colon of DNBS-treated mice and concomitantly abolished inflammation, whereas AA-5-HT did not affect endocannabinoid levels and was significantly less efficacious at attenuating colitis. 5-ASA also increased anandamide levels and abolished colitis. Thus, anandamide is elevated in the inflamed colon of patients with ulcerative colitis, as well as in animal models of IBDs, to control inflammation, and elevation of its levels with inhibitors of its cellular reuptake might be used in the treatment of IBDs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20950616>An association between dietary , measured in adipose tissue, and ulcerative colitis.</a></h2><p>Dietary , an n-6 polyunsaturated fatty  (n-6 PUFA), might be involved in the etiology of ulcerative colitis (UC).

In the analysis,  levels were divided into quartiles; relative risks (RR) were calculated and adjusted for smoking, use of aspirin and nonsteroidal anti- drugs, and levels of n-3 PUFAs.A total of 34 subjects (56% men) developed incident UC at a median age of 58.8 years (range, 50.0-69.0 years). Those in the highest quartile for  concentrations in adipose tissue had an RR for UC of 4.16 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.56-11.04); a trend per 0.1% increase in  of 1.77 in RR was observed (95% CI: 1.38-2.27). The fraction attributed the highest levels of  was 40.3%.Individuals with the highest relative concentrations of  in adipose tissue have a significantly greater risk of developing UC. Dietary modifications might therefore prevent UC or reduce  symptoms.Copyright © 2010 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The hypothesis developed from experiments on rodents that perinodal adipocytes are specialized to provision adjacent lymphoid tissues was tested by comparing the composition of triacylglycerol fatty acids in homologous samples of mesenteric adipose tissue and lymph nodes from patients with or without Crohn's . Mesenteric perinodal and other adipose tissue, and lymph nodes, were collected during elective surgery for Crohn's  and other conditions. Fatty acids were extracted, identified, and quantified by thin-layer and gas-liquid chromatography. Perinodal adipose tissue contained more unsaturated fatty acids than other adipose tissue in controls, as reported for other mammals, but site-specific differences were absent in Crohn's . Lipids from adipose and lymphoid tissues had more saturated fatty acids, but fewer polyunsaturates in Crohn's  patients than controls. In adipose tissue samples, depletion of n-3 polyunsaturates was greatest, but n-6 polyunsaturates, particularly , were preferentially reduced in lymphoid cells. Ratios of n-6/n-3 polyunsaturates were higher in adipose tissue but lower in lymphoid cells in Crohn's  patients than in controls. Site-specific differences in fatty  composition in normal human mesentery are consistent with local interactions between lymph node lymphoid cells and adjacent adipose tissue. But these site-specific properties are absent in Crohn's , causing anomalies in composition of lymphoid cell fatty acids, which may explain the efficacy of elemental diets containing oils rich in n-6 polyunsaturates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22970191>Analysis of candidate colitis genes in the Gdac1 locus of mice deficient in glutathione peroxidase-1 and -2.</a></h2><p>Mice that are deficient for glutathione peroxidases 1 and 2 (GPX) show large variations in the penetrance and severity of colitis in C57BL/6J and 129S1/SvImJ backgrounds. We mapped a locus contributing to this difference to distal chromosome 2 (∼119-133 mbp) and named it glutathione peroxidase-deficiency-associated colitis 1 (Gdac1). The aim of this study was to identify the best gene candidates within the Gdac1 locus contributing to the murine colitis phenotype.We refined the boundaries of Gdac1 to 118-125 mbp (95% confidence interval) by increasing sample size and marker density across the interval. The narrowed region contains 128 well-annotated protein coding genes but it excludes Fermt1, a human  candidate that was within the original boundaries of Gdac1. The locus we identified may be the Cdcs3 locus mapped by others studying IL10-knockout mice. Using in silico analysis of the 128 genes, based on published colon expression data, the relevance of pathways to colitis, gene mutations, presence of non-synonymous-single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) and whether the nsSNPs are predicted to have an impact on protein function or expression, we excluded 42 genes. Based on a similar analysis, twenty-five genes from the remaining 86 genes were analyzed for expression-quantitative-trait loci, and another 15 genes were excluded.Among the remaining 10 genes, we identified Pla2g4f and Duox2 as the most likely colitis gene candidates, because GPX metabolizes PLA2G4F and DUOX2 products. Pla2g4f is a phospholipase A2 that has three potentially significant nsSNP variants and showed expression differences across mouse strains. PLA2G4F produces , which is a substrate for lipoxygenases and, in turn, for GPXs. DUOX2 produces H(2)O(2) and may control microbial populations. DUOX-1 and -2 control microbial populations in mammalian lung and in the gut of several insects and zebrafish. Dysbiosis is a phenotype that differentiates 129S1/SvImJ from C57BL/6J and may be due to strain differences in DUOX2 activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21471961>The endogenous cannabinoid system in the gut of patients with .</a></h2><p>Activation of cannabinoid receptors (CBs) by endocannabinoids impacts on a number of gastrointestinal functions. Recent data indicate that CB1 agonists improve 2,4-dinitrobenzene sulfonic -induced colitis in mice, thus suggesting a role for the endocannabinoid agonist anandamide (AEA) in protecting the gut against inflammation. We here examined the gut endocannabinoid system in  (IBD) patients, and investigated the ex vivo and in vitro effects of the non-hydrolysable AEA analog methanandamide (MAEA) on the mucosal proinflammatory response. The content of AEA, but not of 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol and N-palmitoylethanolamine, was significantly lower in inflamed than uninflamed IBD mucosa, and this was paralleled by lower activity of the AEA-synthesizing enzyme N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine-specific phospholipase D and higher activity of the AEA-degrading enzyme fatty  amide hydrolase. MAEA significantly downregulated interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α secretion by both organ culture biopsies and lamina propria mononuclear cells. Although these results are promising, further studies are needed to determine the role of cannabinoid pathways in gut inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29756563>Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors as a Therapeutic Target in Inflammatory Diseases.</a></h2><p>Inflammation plays a crucial role in the development of many complex diseases and disorders including autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, neurodegenerative diseases, and cardiovascular pathologies. Prostaglandins play a regulatory role in inflammation. Cyclooxygenases are the main mediators of inflammation by catalyzing the initial step of  metabolism and prostaglandin synthesis. The differential expression of the constitutive isoform COX-1 and the inducible isoform COX-2, and the finding that COX-1 is the major form expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, lead to the search for COX-2-selective inhibitors as anti-inflammatory agents that might diminish the gastrointestinal side effects of traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). COX-2 isoform is expressed predominantly in inflammatory cells and decidedly upregulated in chronic and acute inflammations, becoming a critical target for many pharmacological inhibitors. COX-2 selective inhibitors happen to show equivalent efficacy with that of conventional NSAIDs, but they have reduced gastrointestinal side effects. This review would elucidate the most recent findings on selective COX-2 inhibition and their relevance to human pathology, concretely in inflammatory pathologies characterized by a prolonged pro-inflammatory status, including autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, , atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, arthritis, chronic inflammatory bowel disease and cardiovascular pathologies.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15531659>Fish oil and antioxidants alter the composition and function of circulating mononuclear cells in Crohn .</a></h2><p>Crohn  (CD) is associated with osteoporosis and other extraintestinal manifestations that might be mediated by cytokines from circulating (peripheral blood) mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Fish oil rich in eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) reduces  activity in patients with CD with raised laboratory markers of inflammation and in healthy subjects alters PBMC function.We investigated the effect of fish oil plus antioxidants on cytokine production by PBMCs from patients with CD with raised C-reactive protein concentrations (>/=6.9 mg/L) or erythrocyte sedimentation rates (>/=18 mm/h).A randomized placebo-controlled trial of fish oil (2.7 g EPA and DHA/d; n = 31) or placebo (olive oil; n = 31) for 24 wk was conducted in patients with CD. The fish-oil group additionally received an antioxidant preparation (vitamins A, C, and E and selenium). Exclusion criteria included corticosteroid use. Fatty  composition was measured by gas chromatography. Production of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays after stimulation with mitogen and endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide).Fish-oil plus antioxidant dietary supplementation was associated with higher EPA and DHA incorporation into PBMCs (P < 0.001) and lower  (P = 0.006) and lower production of IFN-gamma by mitogen-stimulated PBMCs (P = 0.012) and of PGE(2) by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated PBMCs (P = 0.047).Dietary supplementation with fish oil plus antioxidants is associated with modified PBMC composition and lower production of PGE(2) and IFN-gamma by circulating monocytes or macrophages. The response of extraintestinal manifestations of CD should be investigated in a randomized controlled trial.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26234346>Effects of  intake on inflammatory reactions in dextran sodium sulphate-induced  in rats.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the administration of oral  (AA) in rats with or without dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced inflammatory bowel disease. Male Wistar rats were administered AA at 0, 5, 35 or 240 mg/kg daily by gavage for 8 weeks. Inflammatory bowel disease was induced by replacing drinking water with 3 % DSS solution during the last 7 d of the AA dosing period. These animals passed loose stools, diarrhoea and red-stained faeces. Cyclo-oxygenase-2 concentration and myeloperoxidase activity in the colonic tissue were significantly increased in the animals given AA at 240 mg/kg compared with the animals given AA at 0 mg/kg. Thromboxane B2 concentration in the medium of cultured colonic mucosae isolated from these groups was found to be dose-dependently increased by AA, and the increase was significant at 35 and 240 mg/kg. Leukotriene B4 concentration was also significantly increased and saturated at 5 mg/kg. In addition, AA at 240 mg/kg promoted DSS-induced colonic mucosal oedema with macrophage infiltration. In contrast, administration of AA for 8 weeks, even at 240 mg/kg, showed no effects on the normal rats. These results suggest that in rats with bowel disease AA metabolism is affected by oral AA, even at 5 mg/kg per d, and that excessive AA may aggravate inflammation, whereas AA shows no effects in rats without inflammatory bowel disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10690587>Immunopharmacology of 5-aminosalicylic  and of glucocorticoids in the therapy of .</a></h2><p>Glucocorticoids as well as 5-aminosalicylic  have been used successfully in different formulations during the past 40 years for the treatment of both acute and chronic inflammation in . The mechanism by which the drugs exert their actions are only partially known. Recent studies of the immunoregulation in the lamina propria provide evidence that numerous therapeutic mechanisms contribute to the efficacy of these drugs including the inhibition of  metabolism, a decrease in radical formation by oxygen radical scavenging, an inhibition of both in vivo and in vitro activation of peripheral and intestinal lymphocytes. Moreover direct immunoregulatory effects exerted by the drug may be important in influencing the complex balance of pro- mechanisms during active intestinal inflammation. Such effects are the inhibition of both peripheral and intestinal B lymphocyte immunoglobulin secretion as well as the inhibition of pro- cytokine production and their binding to receptors. Some of these immunoregulatory effects appear to be mediated by an inhibition of the activation of the nuclear factor kappa B transcription factor family by steroids and (less potent) aminosalicylic . Activation of nuclear factor kappa B appears to be pivotal for the sustained upregulation of inflammation molecule expression in many  . It seems, therefore, most likely that the enormous therapeutic potency of steroids, as well as the anti- properties of 5-aminosalicylic , are not achieved by a single action of the drug. The complex orchestration of numerous inhibitory interactions with pro- principles will add to the therapeutic potential of steroids and of 5-aminosalicylic  in the treatment of both acute and chronic intestinal inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12468364>Colonic anti- mechanisms of conjugated linoleic .</a></h2><p>Conjugated linoleic  (CLA) is a mixture of positional (e.g. 7,9; 9,11; 10,12; 11,13) and geometric (cis or trans) isomers of octadecadienoic . This compound was first shown to prevent mammary carcinogenesis in murine models. Later investigations uncovered a number of additional health benefits, including decreasing atherosclerosis and inflammation while enhancing immune function. The mechanisms of action underlying these biological properties are not clearly understood. The aim of this review is to highlight recent advances in CLA research related to experimental . In addition, two possible mechanisms of action (i.e. endoplasmic and nuclear) were discussed in detail in the context of enteric  disorders. Conjugated linoleic  was first implicated in down-regulating the generation of inducible eicosanoids (i.e. PGE(2) and LTB(4)) involved in early micro- events (endoplasmic). More recently, CLA has been shown to modulate the expression of genes regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs; nuclear). In pigs, prolonged dietary CLA treatment stimulated the expression of PPAR-gamma in the muscle. Thus, evidence supporting both mechanistic theories of CLA acting through eicosanoid synthesis and PPAR activity is available. The further understanding of the anti- mechanisms of action of CLA may yield novel nutritional therapies for enteric inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11724453>Polyunsaturated fatty acids, inflammation, and immunity.</a></h2><p>The fatty  composition of  and immune cells is sensitive to change according to the fatty  composition of the diet. In particular, the proportion of different types of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in these cells is readily changed, and this provides a link between dietary PUFA intake, inflammation, and immunity. The n-6 PUFA  (AA) is the precursor of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and related compounds, which have important roles in inflammation and in the regulation of immunity. Fish oil contains the n-3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic  (EPA). Feeding fish oil results in partial replacement of AA in cell membranes by EPA. This leads to decreased production of AA-derived mediators. In addition, EPA is a substrate for cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase and gives rise to mediators that often have different biological actions or potencies than those formed from AA. Animal studies have shown that dietary fish oil results in altered lymphocyte function and in suppressed production of proinflammatory cytokines by macrophages. Supplementation of the diet of healthy human volunteers with fish oil-derived n-3 PUFA results in decreased monocyte and neutrophil chemotaxis and decreased production of proinflammatory cytokines. Fish oil feeding has been shown to ameliorate the symptoms of some animal models of autoimmune . Clinical studies have reported that fish oil supplementation has beneficial effects in rheumatoid arthritis, , and among some asthmatics, supporting the idea that the n-3 PUFA in fish oil are anti- and immunomodulatory.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20801099>Microparticles mediate enzyme transfer from platelets to mast cells: a new pathway for lipoxin A4 biosynthesis.</a></h2><p>The inflammation-resolving lipid mediator lipoxin A4 (LXA4), which is derived from  in the context of inflammation, can be generated physiologically in vivo. However, the mechanism of physiologic formation of LXA4 remains elusive. In this report, we provide evidence that platelet-derived microparticles contain lipoxygenase 12 (12-LO) protein and act as a mediator in transferring 12-LO to mast cells, leading to the production of LXA4 by mast cells. Absence of either leukotriene, the precursor for LXA4, in mast cells or 12-LO in microparticles abolished LXA4 production. Using a mouse model, we demonstrated that platelet-derived microparticles were taken up by peritoneal mast cells in vivo and triggered LXA4 production. We also found that similar to LXA4, platelet-derived microparticles attenuated LPS- or dextran sulfate sodium-induced inflammation by regulating  cytokines. Together, these data suggest a critical role of platetlet-derived microparticles as a signal mediator, at least in LXA4 production, resulting in significant immunoregulatory consequences.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Salmon fillet contains n-3 PUFAs and bioactive peptides that may improve its effects compared to fish oil alone. We assessed the efficacy of a salmon-rich diet in patients with mild ulcerative colitis.An 8-week intervention pilot study was designed to assess the effects of 600 grams Atlantic salmon consumption weekly in 12 UC patients. Simple clinical colitis activity index (SCCAI), a dietary questionnaire, sigmoidoscopy, selected serum  markers, fecal calprotectin, and plasma and rectal biopsy fatty  profiles were assessed before and after intervention.The levels of C20:4n-6  in biopsies after dietary intervention were correlated with histology and endoscopy scores. The concentrations of n-3 PUFAs, C20:5n-3 eicosapentaenoic , C22:6n-3 docosahexaenoic , and the n-3/n-6 ratio increased in plasma and rectal biopsies. The anti- fatty  index (AIFAI) increased both in biopsies and plasma accompanied with a significantly reduced SCCAI.Based on evidence of SCCAI and AIFAI and a tendency of decreased levels of CRP and homocysteine, intake of Atlantic salmon may have beneficial effects on  activity in patients with mild ulcerative colitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24061802>Multivariate data analysis of erythrocyte membrane phospholipid Fatty  profiles in the discrimination between normal blood tissue and various  States.</a></h2><p>The investigation presented here aims to compare the fatty  composition of red blood cells of patients with different  states and to test the hypothesis that the changes in fatty  profiles derived from erythrocyte phospholipids might be relevant to various . The study sample consisted of 342 blood donors, among them 135 with , 53 with uterine leiomyoma, 14 with verified absence of uterine leiomyoma, 52 with asthma, 18 with colon adenomas, and 70 blood samples without any of mentioned  that was used as a control group. After the isolation of erythrocytes from blood samples, total extracted lipids were separated by solid-phase extraction (SPE) into non polar lipids and polar phospholipids. After the saponification of phospholipid fraction, the esterification process followed with boron trifluoride-methanol reagent. The fatty  methyl ester (FAME) composition of the total red blood cell phospholipid fraction was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) with flame ionization detector (FID). Additionally two fatty aldehyde dimethyl acetals (hexadecanal and octadecanal dimethyl acetals; 16:0 DMA and 18:0 DMA) derived from erythrocyte membrane plasmalogen phospholipids were also determined. The resulting fatty  and plasmalogen linked fatty  composition was evaluated by the principal component analysis (PCA). We demonstrated decreased levels of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) in red blood cell membrane of patients with colon adenomas. Also, a large negative correlation was observed among all samples between the quantity of saturated acids and  (20:4n6)  as well as saturated acids and adrenic (22:4n6) . In PCA score plot a group of female donors is distinguished mainly by the content of linoleic (18:2n6) ; a small subgroup shows its concentration highly above the average value. At the same time, the same subgroup has both dimethyl acetals below the average concentrations. The study demonstrates feasibility of multivariate data analysis in discrimination of patients with different  according to fatty  profile and suggests considerable differences in membrane fatty  profiles in patients with various  states.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11094054>Prostaglandin levels in stimulated macrophages are controlled by phospholipase A2-activating protein and by activation of phospholipase C and D.</a></h2><p>Prostaglandins (PG), which are responsible for a large array of biological functions in eukaryotic cells, are produced from  by phospholipases and cyclooxygenase enzymes COX-1 and COX-2. We demonstrated that PG levels in cells were partly controlled by a regulatory protein, phospholipase A2 (PLA2)-activating protein (PLAA). Treatment of murine macrophages with lipopolysaccharide, interleukin-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha increased PLAA levels at early time points (2-30 min), which correlated with an up-regulation in cytosolic PLA2 and PGE2 levels. Both COX-2 and secretory PLA2 were also increased in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages, however, at later time points of 4-24 h. The role of PLAA in eicosanoid formation in macrophages was confirmed by the use of an antisense plaa oligonucleotide. Within amino  residues 503-538, PLAA exhibited homology with melittin, and increased PGE(2) production was noted in macrophages stimulated with melittin. In addition to PLA2, we demonstrated that activation of phospholipase C and D significantly controlled PGE2 production. Finally, increased antigen levels of PLAA, COX-2, and phospholipases were demonstrated in biopsy specimens from patients with varying amounts of intestinal mucosal inflammation, which corresponded to increased levels of phospholipase activity.

Moreover,  patients have elevated colonic  (AA) proportions. So far, effects of dietary AA v. FO on colitis have never been examined. We therefore designed three isoenergetic diets, which were fed to mice for 6 weeks preceding and during 7 d dextran sodium sulfate colitis induction. The control diet was rich in oleic  (OA). For the other two diets, 1.0 % (w/w) OA was exchanged for EPA+DHA (FO group) or AA. At 7 d after colitis induction, the AA group had gained weight (0.46 (sem 0.54) g), whereas the FO and OA groups had lost weight (- 0.98 (SEM 0.81) g and - 0.79 (SEM 1.05) g, respectively; P < 0.01 v. AA). The AA group had less diarrhoea than the FO and OA groups (P < 0.05). Weight and length of the colon, histological scores and cytokine concentrations in colon homogenates showed no differences. Myeloperoxidase concentrations in plasma and polymorphonuclear cell infiltration in colon were decreased in the FO group as compared with the OA group. We conclude that in this mice model an AA-enriched diet increased colonic AA content, but did not result in more colonic inflammation as compared with FO- and OA-enriched diets. As we only examined effects after 7 d and because the time point for evaluating effects seems to be important, the present results should be regarded as preliminary.

The mediators formed from the different PUFA have different potencies. We hypothesised that metabolic changes associated with colonic mucosal inflammation would modify the bioavailability of the eicosanoid precursors AA and EPA.Colonic mucosa biopsies were obtained from patients with ulcerative colitis and from matched controls. Inflammation was graded endoscopically and histologically. Esterified and non-esterified fatty acids were determined within the biopsies using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively.Biopsy samples were collected from 69 UC patients (54 providing both inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa) and 69 controls. Inflamed mucosa had higher AA (p<0.001) and lower EPA (p<0.010) contents and a higher AA:EPA ratio (p<0.001). Inflamed mucosa also had higher docosapentaenoic  (DPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and lower linoleic  (LA) and α-linolenic  (α-LNA) contents (all p<0.001), compared to non-inflamed and controls. There were significant correlations between severity of inflammation and contents of AA, DPA and DHA (positive correlations) and of LA, α-LNA and EPA (negative correlations).Higher AA, AA:EPA ratio, DPA and DHA and lower LA, α-LNA and EPA are seen in inflamed mucosa in UC and correlate with severity of inflammation. This suggests an alteration in fatty  metabolism in the inflamed gut mucosa, which may offer novel targets for intervention and should be considered if nutritional strategies are used.Copyright © 2013 European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation.

The best-studied AEs are the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA), the anti- compound palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), and the potent anorexigenic molecule oleoylethanolamide (OEA). AEs are biosynthesized in the gastrointestinal tract, and their levels may change in response to noxious stimuli, food deprivation or diet-induced obesity. The biological actions of AEs within the gut are not limited to the modulation of food intake and energy balance. For example, AEs exert potential beneficial effects in the regulation of intestinal motility, secretion, inflammation and cellular proliferation. Molecular targets of AEs, which have been identified in the gastrointestinal tract, include cannabinoid CB(1) and CB(2) receptors (activated by AEA), transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1, activated by AEA and OEA), the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha, activated by OEA and, to a less extent, by PEA), and the orphan G-coupled receptors GPR119 (activated by OEA) and GPR55 (activated by PEA and, with lower potency, by AEA and OEA).

Metabolites of  have pro- properties and are increased in the mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis. The aim of this investigation was to conduct the first prospective cohort study investigating if a high dietary intake of linoleic  increases the risk of developing incident ulcerative colitis.Dietary data from food frequency questionnaires were available for 203 193 men and women aged 30-74 years, resident in the UK, Sweden, Denmark, Germany or Italy and participating in a prospective cohort study, the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). These participants were followed up for the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis.

The highest quartile of intake of linoleic  was associated with an increased risk of ulcerative colitis (odds ratio (OR) = 2.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.23 to 5.07, p = 0.01) with a significant trend across quartiles (OR = 1.32 per quartile increase, 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.66, p = 0.02 for trend).The data support a role for dietary linoleic  in the aetiology of ulcerative colitis.

TRPV1 is a member of a distinct subgroup of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion channels. The neuronally expressed TRPV1 is a non-selective, Ca(2+)-preferring, cation channel. In addition to capsaicin, this channel is activated by a number of different stimuli including heat, , certain  derivatives and direct phosphorylation via protein kinase C (PKC). Moreover, there is also evidence that various  mediators such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), bradykinin, nerve growth factor (NGF) or prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) may indirectly lead to activation of the TRPV1 channel via activation of their respective receptors. There is strong experimental evidence that the combination of direct and indirect mechanisms finely tune the TRPV1 activity. Each of the different known modes of direct TRPV1 activation (protons, heat and vanilloids) is capable of sensitising the channel to other agonists. Similarly,  mediators from the external milieu found in  conditions can indirectly sensitise the receptor. It is this sensitisation of the TRPV1 receptor in   that could hold the key and contribute to the transduction of noxious signalling for normally innocuous stimuli, i.e. either hyperalgesia in the case of chronic pain or airway hyperresponsivness/hypertussive responses in patients with chronic cough. It seems reasonable to suggest that the various mechanisms for sensitisation provide a scenario for TRPV1 to be tonically active and this activity may contribute to the underlying pathology -- providing an important convergence point of multiple pain producing stimuli in the somatosensory system and multiple cough-evoking irritants in the airways. The complex mechanisms and pathways that contribute to the pathophysiology of chronic pain and chronic cough have made it difficult for clinicians to treat patients with current therapies. There is an increasing amount of evidence supporting the hypothesis that the expression, activation and modulation of TRPV1 in sensory neurones appears to be an integral component of pain and cough pathways, although the precise contribution of TRPV1 to human  has yet to be determined. So the question remains open as to whether TRPV1 therapeutics will be efficacious and safe in man and represent a much needed novel pain and cough therapeutic.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27990120>Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids and Their Derivatives: Therapeutic Value for Inflammatory, Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders, and Colorectal Cancer.</a></h2><p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are bioactive lipids which modulate inflammation and immunity. They gained recognition in nutritional therapy and are recommended dietary supplements. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting the usefulness of PUFAs in active therapy of various gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. In this review we briefly cover the systematics of PUFAs and their metabolites, and elaborate on their possible use in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) with focus on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and colorectal cancer (CRC). Each section describes the latest findings from  and  studies, with reports of clinical interventions when available.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29580941>Increased epoxyeicosatrienoic acids may be part of a protective mechanism in human ulcerative , with increased CYP2J2 and reduced soluble epoxide hydrolase expression.</a></h2><p>Previous preclinical evidence has suggested that the elevation of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) derived from the cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenases-dependent metabolism of  has important anti-inflammatory effects. However, the levels of EETs and their synthetic and metabolic enzymes in human ulcerative  has not been evaluated.To evaluate EETs and the expression of relevant CYP isoforms and the metabolizing enzyme, soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), tissue biopsies were collected from 16 pairs of ulcerative  patients' tissues and matched with adjacent non-inflamed tissues. EETs were extracted from tissue homogenates and analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry.The concentration of EETs was higher in ulcerative  tissues compared with matched adjacent non-inflamed tissues (1.91 ± 0.98 ng/mg vs. 0.96 ± 0.77 ng/mg, mean ± SD, P < 0.01). As shown by immunohistochemistry, sEH was present in the cytoplasm and intestinal mucosa and showed a decline in ulcerative  tissues compared with matched adjacent non-inflamed tissues. Western blot analyses showed reduced sEH expression in ulcerative  tissues compared with matched adjacent non-inflamed tissues, whereas CYP2J2 increased in ulcerative  tissues (P < 0.05). However, there was no statistically significant difference observed in CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 protein expression between them (P > 0.05).Our data suggest that the increase in EET levels may be part of a protective mechanism in ulcerative .

Several studies have pinpointed the initiating role of longstanding/relapsing inflammatory insult on the intestinal mucosa, with the activation of different pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ), chemokines and metabolites of  resulting in the activation of key transcription factors such as NF-κB. Longstanding inflammation may also modify the intestinal microbiota, prompting the overgrowth of genotoxic microorganisms, which may act as further cancer promoters. Most of the molecular dysregulation occurring in sporadic colorectal carcinogenesis is documented in -associated adenocarcinoma too, but marked differences have been established in both their timing and prevalence. Unlike sporadic cancers, TP53 alterations occur early in IBD-related carcinogenesis, while APC dysregulation emerges mainly in the most advanced stages of the oncogenic cascade. From the therapeutic standpoint, -associated cancers are associated with a lower prevalence of KRAS mutations than the sporadic variant. Epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNAs, are significantly involved in -associated cancer development and progression. The focus now is on identifying diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, with a view to ultimately designing patient-tailored therapies.Copyright © 2016 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.

The leukotrienes have a role in   such as allergic rhinitis,  and asthma. Montelukast, a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist, is claimed to be effective in asthma. The present study aimed to assess the role of cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist on peripheral inflammation and whether montelukast treatment enhances the anti- effect of indomethacin. Anti- response was measured using a plethysmometer. Histopathologic examination for leukocyte accumulation was done. Montelukast (0.5-2mg/kg, i.p.) produced a significant anti- effect in dose dependent manner against formalin-induced rat paw oedema at 1h but not in 3 and 5 h. When indomethacin (5 mg/kg, i.p) was co-administered with montelukast (1 mg/kg, i.p), the anti- effects of indomethacin were significantly increased as compared to the per se effect at 3 and 5 hour after formalin challenge. In histopathology it has been found that combination therapy significantly decreased migration of leucocytes into the site of inflammation. These results show that montelukast has anti- properties in peripheral tissue and markedly potentiates the anti- activity of indomethacin at 3 and 5 h. It is expected that combination of montelukast with cyclooxygenase inhibitor would prove to be a novel approach to manage complex  conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16712837>Targeting cytosolic phospholipase A2 by arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone prevents chronic inflammation in mice.</a></h2><p>Cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) plays a pivotal role in inflammation by catalyzing the release of , a substrate for lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase enzymes, from membrane phospholipids. In the present study we examined the role of cPLA(2) in  responses through the use of a specific inhibitor of the enzyme, cPLA(2), arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3). Interestingly, we observed that AACOCF3 is an inhibitor of chronic but not acute  responses. Specifically, AACOCF3 inhibited phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced chronic ear edema in mice. Additionally, oral treatment of ovalbumin-sensitized/ovalbumin-challenged BALB/c mice with 20 mg/kg AACOCF3 prevented the development of airway hyper-responsiveness in a model of asthma. Furthermore, AACOCF3 decreased cellular recruitment in the airway lumen and airway inflammation after the ovalbumin challenge.

They are potent pro- agents, as well as causing bronchoconstriction, and undoubtedly have a role in asthma. The cysLTs are products of  metabolism and have been shown to have effects via a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor (CysLTR1) on vascular permeability, mucus production, chemotaxis and bronchial smooth muscle. Their detection in certain body fluids in allergic, aspirin-sensitive and exercise-induced asthma is well documented and potential roles in pathogenesis, proposed. The development of agents affecting production or action offers an exciting new approach to the treatment of asthma. Two approaches to antileukotriene therapy have been developed: blocking their production by inhibiting the action of 5-lipoxygenase enzyme or blocking the CysLTR1. Both approaches have been tried in studies in asthma and overall the results are encouraging, with a decrease in both daytime and nocturnal symptoms, a decrease in additional beta 2 agonist usage and improvement in lung function. The changes, however, are small in some studies. This may be a reflection of  severity in the study subjects, but of note is a heterogeneity of response to these treatments that may be genetically determined. Antileukotriene therapy has been shown to have an effect in specific types of asthma where the role of cysLTs seems well established--aspirin-sensitive/intolerant asthma and exercise-induced asthma. Longer term studies are needed in other areas such as severe asthma and chronic persistent asthma in both children and adults to provide evidence for the appropriate placement of antileukotriene treatment in current asthma guidelines, in comparison with other established treatments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16216483>Eugenol--the active principle from cloves inhibits 5-lipoxygenase activity and leukotriene-C4 in human PMNL cells.</a></h2><p>Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) play an important role in the modulation of  conditions in humans. PMNL cells recruited at the site of inflammation, release  mediators such as leukotrienes, proteolytic enzymes and reactive oxygen species. Among these, leukotrienes are implicated in pathophysiology of allergic and  disorders like asthma, allergic rhinitis, arthritis,  and psoriasis. 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) is the key enzyme in biosynthetic pathway of leukotrienes. Our earlier studies showed that spice phenolic active principles significantly inhibit 5-LO enzyme in human PMNLs. In this study we have further characterized the inhibitory mechanism of eugenol, the active principle of spice-clove on 5-LO enzyme and also its effect on leukotriene C((4)) (LTC(4)). Substrate dependent enzyme kinetics showed that the inhibitory effect of eugenol on 5-LO was of a non-competitive nature. Further, eugenol was found to significantly inhibit the formation of LTC(4) in calcium ionophore A23187 and  (AA) stimulated PMNL cells. These data clearly suggest that eugenol inhibits 5-LO by non-competitive mechanism and also inhibits formation of LTC(4) in human PMNL cells and thus may have beneficial role in modulating 5-LO pathway in human PMNL cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10453341>Lipid treatment of .</a></h2><p>The aetiology of  remains unclear.

Established therapy of  with 5-aminosalicylic  compounds has been shown to reduce local leukotriene B4 formation by inhibiting lipoxygenases. This therapeutic mechanism formed one rationale for examining the effect of n-3 fatty acids, which also inhibit leukotriene B4 formation, on the course of these . In the first study, published in 1989, we found no beneficial effects of n-3 fatty acids in patients with Crohn's ; however, there was clinical improvement, just falling short of significance, in patients with ulcerative colitis. Since then two uncontrolled and five controlled studies have further investigated the therapeutic effect of n-3 fatty acids in patients with ulcerative colitis. The size of the patient population in the controlled studies ranged from 10 to 96 patients in the largest study. Two of these studies showed a significant improvement in clinical activity and a steroid-sparing effect, respectively. Another study found only a trend towards improvement and one trial, which also included a treatment group receiving evening primrose oil, found no beneficial effect in the 16 patients receiving n-3 fatty acids. A large, 2 year trial of n-3 fatty acids in patients with ulcerative colitis off steroids, which was recently completed at the Universities of Munich and Mainz, showed a delay of the first episode of relapse, but no reduction in the cumulative relapse rate at 2 years.

The disease is characterized by chronic or recurring inflammation of the gut. Because of the localization of the endocannabinoid system in the gastrointestinal tract, it may be a potential pharmacologic target for the treatment of IBD and other diseases. Fatty  amide hydrolase (FAAH) is a potential candidate because it is upregulated in IBD. FAAH hydrolyzes and, as a consequence, inactivates anandamide (AEA), a prominent endocannabinoid. Inhibition of FAAH would lead to increases in the amount of AEA oxidized by cytochrome P450s (P450s). CYP2J2, the major P450 epoxygenase expressed in the heart, is also expressed in the intestine and has previously been reported to oxidize AEA. We have investigated the possibility that it may play a role in AEA metabolism in the gut and have demonstrated that purified human CYP2J2 metabolizes AEA to form the 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  ethanolamide (HETE-EA) and several epoxygenated products, including the 5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic  ethanolamides (EET-EAs), in the reconstituted system. Kinetic studies suggest that the KM values for these products range from approximately 10 to 468 μM and the kcat values from 0.2 to 23.3 pmol/min per picomole of P450. Human intestinal microsomes, which express CYP2J2, metabolize AEA to give the 5,6-, 8,9-, and 11,12-EET-EAs, as well as 20-HETE-EA. Studies using specific P450 inhibitors suggest that although CYP2J2 metabolizes AEA, it is not the primary P450 responsible for AEA metabolism in human intestines.Copyright © 2016 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28797636>Modulating effect of inositol hexaphosphate on -dependent pathways in colon cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) are key enzymes of  metabolism. Their products, prostaglandins and leukotrienes, are involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases and colorectal cancer. The aim of the study was to examine the influence of inositol hexaphosphate (IP6), a naturally occurring phytochemical, on the expression of genes encoding COX and LOX isoforms and synthesis of their products (PGE and LTB) in colon cancer cell line Caco-2 stimulated with pro-inflammatory agents (IL-1β/TNFα). Real-time RT-qPCR was used to validate mRNAs level of examined genes. The concentrations of COX-2 and 5-LOX proteins as well as PGE2 and LTB4 were determined by the ELISA method. Based on these studies it may be concluded that IP6 may limit inflammatory events in the colonic epithelium and prevent colon carcinomas by modulating the expression of genes encoding COX and LOX isoforms at both mRNA and protein levels as well as by affecting the synthesis and secretion of prostaglandins and leukotrienes.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Previous studies have demonstrated that 12-LO, but not 5- or 15-lipoxygenase (5-LO, 15-LO respectively), is specifically expressed in pancreatic -cells and is involved in regulating glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Lipoxygenase products also have been linked with  pathways in endothelial cells, kidney mesangial cells, , and corneal epithelial cells. Therefore, 12-LO may play a role in cytokine mediated inflammation in pancreatic beta-cells (i.e. beta -cell dysfunction and cytotoxicity). Cytokines such as IL-1 stimulate both de novo 12-LO protein synthesis and enzyme activity in pancreatic beta-cells. The products generated by 12-LO may ultimately be involved in cellular events that lead to lipid peroxidation. Hydroperoxide and free radical production in beta-cells can activate intracellular signaling pathways that lead to cell death or may directly damage mitochondrial and plasma membranes. Increased 12-LO expression has also been found in islets from prediabetic Zucker fatty rats, a model that demonstrates insulin secretory defects similar to human type 2 diabetes. In this review, we present an overview of the 12-LO pathway in regulating glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in beta-cells as well as more recent data which supports the hypothesis that the 12-LO pathway participates in cytokine mediated beta-cell dysfunction and cytotoxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20440721>Dietary -mediated effects on colon inflammation using transcriptome analysis.</a></h2><p>Increased levels of n-6  (AA), a precursor of pro- eicosanoids, have been found in the colon mucosa of  patients when compared with healthy subjects.

Effects of AA on gene expression profiles during colitis were examined using whole genome microarray analysis. Dietary AA decreased the expression levels of some colonic genes in ER stress, complement system, nuclear respiratory factor 2-mediated oxidative stress and positive acute phase response pathways compared with Il10-/- mice fed an oleic  diet. AA increased the expression levels of fatty  catabolism genes, but decreased that of lipid synthesis genes during colitis, likely by sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 and target gene regulation. A link has been suggested between AA and reduction of intestinal fibrosis by down-regulating the expression levels of pro- and fibrotic marker genes. Contrary to the hypothesis, these findings suggest that dietary AA, in the present experimental conditions, is not pro-, reduces ER stress and protects colonocytes from oxidative stress in Il10-/- mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25187657>Crucial role of macrophage selenoproteins in experimental .</a></h2><p>Inflammation is a hallmark of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that involves macrophages.

Acute  was induced using 4% dextran sodium sulfate in wild-type mice maintained on Se-deficient (<0.01 ppm Se), Se-adequate (0.08 ppm; sodium selenite), and two supraphysiological levels in the form of Se-supplemented (0.4 ppm; sodium selenite) and high Se (1.0 ppm; sodium selenite) diets. Selenocysteinyl transfer RNA knockout mice (Trsp(fl/fl)LysM(Cre)) were used to examine the role of selenoproteins in macrophages on disease progression and severity using histopathological evaluation, expression of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory genes, and modulation of PG metabolites in urine and plasma. Whereas Se-deficient and Se-adequate mice showed increased  and exhibited poor survival, Se supplementation at 0.4 and 1.0 ppm increased survival of mice and decreased -associated inflammation with an upregulation of expression of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory genes. Metabolomic profiling of urine suggested increased oxidation of PGE2 at supraphysiological levels of Se that also correlated well with Se-dependent upregulation of 15-hydroxy-PG dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) in macrophages. Pharmacological inhibition of 15-PGDH, lack of selenoprotein expression in macrophages, and depletion of infiltrating macrophages indicated that macrophage-specific selenoproteins and upregulation of 15-PGDH expression were key for Se-dependent anti-inflammatory and proresolving effects. Selenoproteins in macrophages protect mice from dextran sodium sulfate- by enhancing 15-PGDH-dependent oxidation of PGE2 to alleviate inflammation, suggesting a therapeutic role for Se in IBD.Copyright © 2014 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16951496>Regulated spatial distribution of cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases in Crohn's ulcer.</a></h2><p> metabolism actively participates in the initiation, climaxing, and resolution phases of inflammation, and its close connection with  has been only recently discovered.

At sufficiently high intakes, long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), as found in oily fish and fish oils, decrease the production of  eicosanoids, cytokines, and reactive oxygen species and the expression of adhesion molecules. Long-chain n-3 PUFAs act both directly (e.g., by replacing  as an eicosanoid substrate and inhibiting  metabolism) and indirectly (e.g., by altering the expression of  genes through effects on transcription factor activation). Long-chain n-3 PUFAs also give rise to a family of antiinflammatory mediators termed resolvins. Thus, n-3 PUFAs are potentially potent antiinflammatory agents. As such, they may be of therapeutic use in a variety of acute and chronic  settings. Evidence of their clinical efficacy is reasonably strong in some settings (e.g., in rheumatoid arthritis) but is weak in others (e.g., in  and asthma).

To validate the gene-disease link, we tested a pre-clinical tool EPHX2i (GSK1910364) in a mouse disease model, where it showed improved outcomes comparable to or better than the positive control Cyclosporin A. Up-regulation of cytoprotective genes and down-regulation of proinflammatory cytokine production were observed in colon samples obtained from EPHX2i-treated mice.

Analysis of lipid mediators showed sustained formation of lipoxin A4 and an increase of DHA-derived 17-hydroxydocosahexaenoic  (17-HDHA) after treatment with ASA. Furthermore, in vitro experiments in RAW264.7 murine macrophages demonstrated significantly increased phagocytosis activity after incubation with 17-HDHA, supporting its proresolution effect. These results show a protective effect of ASA in a murine colitis model and could give a rationale for a careful reassessment of ASA therapy in patients with  and particularly ulcerative colitis, possibly combined with DHA supplementation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31527366>[Physiological and pathophysiological roles of TRPV4 channel in gastrointestinal tract].</a></h2><p>Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) is a non-selective cation channel that responds to mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli in addition to various endogenous ligands, such as  metabolites. The present study aimed to elucidate the expression of TRPV4 in the gastrointestinal tract and the pathogenic roles of TRPV4 in dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced . TRPV4-immunoreactivity was detected in epithelial-like cells of the mouse tongue, esophagus, stomach, ileum, and colon; TRPV4 expression in the tongue was higher than other gastrointestinal tracts. TRPV4 colocalized with a type IV cell marker sonic hedgehog in circumvallate papillae. These findings suggest that TRPV4 contributes to sour taste sensing by regulating type III taste cell differentiation in mice. DSS-induced  was significantly attenuated in TRPV4-knockout (TRPV4KO) mice when compared to wild-type mice. DSS treatment upregulated TRPV4 expression in vascular endothelia of colonic mucosa and submucosa. DSS treatment increased vascular permeability, which was abolished in TRPV4KO mice. The activation of TRPV4 decreased VE-cadherin expression in mouse aortic endothelial cells exposed to TNF-α. These findings indicate that the upregulation of TRPV4 in vascular endothelial cells contributes to the progression of colonic inflammation via the activation of vascular permeability.

The activation of  cells, the release of their mediators, and the excessive production of free radicals may affect circulating lipids.We examined the lipid profile, lipoprotein composition, and oxidant-antioxidant status of children with CD.We studied 22 pediatric CD patients and 10 healthy control subjects.The proportion of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids in plasma of CD patients was higher but that of polyunsaturated fatty acids was lower than in control subjects. This resulted in higher ratios in CD patients of palmitoleic  to linoleic  (P < 0. 05) and of eicosatrienoic  to  (P < 0.04), 2 established indexes of essential fatty  deficiency. Hypocholesterolemia was noted in CD patients as a result of lower LDL-cholesterol concentrations than in control subjects (P < 0.02). Plasma apolipoproteins B (P < 0.02) and A-I (P < 0.02) were also lower in CD patients, whereas plasma triacylglycerols were higher (P < 0.005). Lipoprotein composition was altered in CD patients, with relative triacylglycerol depletion and protein enrichment in VLDL. In contrast, intermediate-density lipoprotein of CD patients was characterized by an increased percentage of triacylglycerol and protein (P < 0.005) and a reduced proportion of phospholipids (P < 0. 01). Additional abnormalities were observed in the chemical distribution of HDL(2) and HDL(3) moieties. Lipid peroxidation was documented by higher plasma malondialdehyde concentrations in CD patients (P < 0.05), accompanied by lower retinol concentrations (P < 0.02).Disturbances in the lipid profile, in lipoprotein concentrations and composition, and in oxidant-antioxidant status occur in CD patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17955308>Restorative proctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis: impact on lipid metabolism and adipose tissue and serum fatty acids.</a></h2><p>The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the changes of the metabolism of circulating and storage lipids in patients with ulcerative colitis after restorative proctocolectomy.

In ulcerative colitis patients, total cholesterol and docosahexaenoic  were lower than in healthy subjects (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05). The median interval between colectomy and ileostomy closure was 6 (range 2-9) months. During that interval, the  parameters improved, high-density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol increased (p < 0.01), and low-density (LDL) cholesterol decreased (p = 0.01). At ileostomy closure, serum  levels were increased (p = 0.04), whereas serum oleic  level was decreased (p = 0.02). In this interval, no significant alteration, either in serum n-3 FA precursors or in the FA of subcutaneous adipose tissue, was observed. The increase of serum  after colectomy might suggest a lower utilization for  process. The reduction of LDL cholesterol is an index of malabsorption probably due to the accelerated transit and to the exclusion of the terminal ileum caused by the covering ileostomy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11686836>FR167653, a potent suppressant of interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha production, ameliorates colonic lesions in experimentally induced acute colitis.</a></h2><p>Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) are believed to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of  (IBD).

FR167653 (C24H18FN5O2-H2SO4-H2O) is a newly synthesized organic compound with a potent inhibitory effect on IL-1beta and TNF-alpha production. We hypothesized that the suppression of IL-1 and TNF-alpha induced by FR167653 could effectively attenuate experimentally induced colonic damage.Colonic lesions were induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) by intrarectal instillation of 4% acetic . The effect of FR167653 administration at 1.0, 1.5, 2.5 mg/kg per 6 h subcutaneously on acetic -induced colonic damage was assessed. The lesion area, microscopic findings, colonic and serum levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta were also evaluated.Treatment with FR167653 at 1.5 and 2.5 mg/kg per 6 h was able to ameliorate the gross macroscopic appearance of colonic lesions significantly, as well as ameliorate the lesion area induced by acetic . Colonic mucosal TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels of rats treated with FR167653 showed significant decrease in a dose-dependent fashion compared with the control group. In the same manner, serum TNF-alpha of rats treated with FR167653 was significantly lower than that of respective controls.Subcutaneous administration of FR167653 was able to ameliorate the acute changes induced by acetic  instillation in a dose-dependent manner.

LTB4 is a potent chemotactic factor for neutrophils and has been postulated to play an important role in a variety of pathological conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and . To investigate the role of LTB4 in dermatitis, we used S-(4-dimethylaminobenzyl)-N-[(2S)-3-mercapto-2-methylpropionyl]-L- cysteine (SA6541), a potent leukotriene A4 (LTA4) hydrolase inhibitor. SA6541 inhibited LTB4 production with an IC50 value of 270 nM in vitro. 5-Hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic  (5-HPETE) or AA injection induced LTB4 production and neutrophil influx in mouse ear. SA6541 inhibited 5-HPETE- and AA-induced LTB4 production and neutrophil influx in mouse ear when administered orally at a dose of 50 mg/kg. SA6541 also inhibited 5-HPETE-induced prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production, probably by an indirect effect through the inhibition of LTB4 production.

The aim of this study was to compare the qualitative and quantitative fat intake and fatty  composition of plasma phospholipids and adipose tissue in a defined population of CD patients with those in matched controls.Dietary fat intake and fatty  profile of plasma phospholipids and adipose tissue were assessed in two patient populations: 20 patients with recently diagnosed CD and 32 patients with longstanding (> 10 yr) CD clinically in remission, matched for age and gender with healthy controls.We observed no significant differences in quantitative or qualitative fat intake between CD patients and controls. Percentages of linoleic  and alpha-linolenic  in plasma phospholipids or adipose tissue were not significantly different between patients and controls. However, we observed a significantly (p < 0.05) lower percentage of the sum of the n-3 fatty acids, with significantly (p < 0.01) higher levels of clupanodonic  (22:5n-3) and significantly (p < 0.05) lower levels of docosahexaenoic (22:6n-3) and  (20:4n-6). The aberrant fatty  profile was more evident in patients with longstanding CD than in patients with recently diagnosed CD.The aberrant fatty  profile found in these CD patients is a result of altered metabolism rather than of essential fatty  malabsorption.

Circulating polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have recently attracted attention as being altered in a variety of  states.  (AA), in particular, has been implicated in the development of a pro- profile in a number of immune-related disorders. AA is the precursor of a number of important immunomodulatory eicosanoids, including prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)). We investigated the hypothesis that elevated plasma AA concentrations in plasma contribute to the proposed pro- profile in IBS. Plasma AA and related PUFA were quantified by gas chromatography analysis in IBS patients and controls. Both PGE(2) and LTB(4) were measured in serum using commercially available ELISA assays. AA concentrations were elevated in our patient cohort compared with healthy controls. Moreover, we demonstrated that this disturbance in plasma AA concentrations leads to downstream elevations in eicosanoids.

Several studies suggest an association between dietary factors and the onset of ulcerative colitis; however, only few studies have examined the relationship between dietary intake and relapse of ulcerative colitis. The aim of this study was to assess the dietary intake and antioxidative capacity of ulcerative colitis patients and to elucidate the efficacy of dietary therapy for ulcerative colitis.

Accumulating evidence suggests that up-regulation of COX-2 is associated with carcinogenesis in multiple organ systems including the large , lung, breast, and prostate. In this report, we examine the expression of COX-2 protein and mRNA in prostate tissue containing various lesions and in prostate cancer cell lines. In the cell lines, LNCaP, DU145, PC-3, and TSU, COX-2 protein expression was undetectable under basal conditions but could be induced transiently by phorbol ester treatment in PC-3 and TSU cells, but not in DU145 and LNCaP cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of 144 human prostate cancer cases suggested that, in contrast to several previous reports, there was no consistent overexpression of COX-2 in established prostate cancer or high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, as compared with adjacent normal prostate tissue. Positive staining was seen only in scattered cells (<1%) in both tumor and normal tissue regions but was much more consistently observed in areas of proliferative  atrophy, lesions that have been implicated in prostatic carcinogenesis. Staining was also seen at times in macrophages. Western blotting and quantitative RT-PCR analyses confirmed these patterns of expression. These results suggest that if nonsteroidal anti- drugs are indeed chemopreventive and/or chemotherapeutic for prostate cancer, their effects are likely to be mediated by modulating COX-2 activity in non-PCa cells (either  cells or atrophic epithelial cells) or by affecting a COX-2-independent pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17604003>13-Oxo-ODE is an endogenous ligand for PPARgamma in human colonic epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>The ligand activated nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) induces transcriptional repression of pro- factors.

Using the Ussing-chamber voltage clamp technique, histamine was found to cause a transient concentration-dependent increase in short-circuit current, a measure of total ion transport across the epithelial tissue. This increase was not affected by amiloride pretreatment, but was significantly inhibited by bumetanide and completely inhibited when chloride was substituted in the bathing buffer by gluconate. A histamine-induced increase in short-circuit current was also significantly reduced by inhibitors of the cyclooxygenase pathway indicating the involvement of prostaglandin E2 in its action.

The role of CYP2J2 in phagocytosis is not known and its regulation in human   is poorly understood. Here we investigated the role of CYP2J2 in bacterial phagocytosis and its expression in monocytes from healthy controls and Crohns  patients. CYP2J2 is anti- in human peripheral blood monocytes. Bacterial LPS induced CYP2J2 mRNA and protein. The CYP2J2  products 11,12-EET and 14,15-EET inhibited LPS induced TNFα release. THP-1 monocytes were transformed into macrophages by 48h incubation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Epoxygenase inhibition using a non-selective inhibitor SKF525A or a selective CYP2J2 inhibitor Compound 4, inhibited E. coli particle phagocytosis, which could be specifically reversed by 11,12-EET. Moreover, epoxygenase inhibition reduced the expression of phagocytosis receptors CD11b and CD68. CD11b also mediates L. monocytogenes phagocytosis. Similar, to E. coli bioparticle phagocytosis, epoxygenase inhibition also reduced intracellular levels of L. monocytogenes, which could be reversed by co-incubation with 11,12-EET. Disrupted bacterial clearance is a hallmark of Crohn's . Unlike macrophages from control donors, macrophages from Crohn's  patients showed no induction of CYP2J2 in response to E. coli. These results demonstrate that CYP2J2 mediates bacterial phagocytosis in macrophages, and implicates a defect in the CYP2J2 pathway may regulate bacterial clearance in Crohn's .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19347299>: a model of chronic inflammation-induced cancer.</a></h2><p>Chronic inflammation is a well-recognized risk factor for the development of human cancer.

Microbiological, immunological and toxic agents can initiate the  response by activating a variety of humoral and cellular mediators. In the early phase of inflammation, excessive amounts of cytokines and  mediators are released. These factors activate, in addition to other signaling pathways, the lipid synthesis pathways, which play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of organ dysfunction.  (AA), the precursor of pro- eicosanoids, is released from membrane phospholipids by the action of phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)), and is metabolized to prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes (LTs) by the action of cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LO) enzymes, respectively. Disordered activation of PLA(2), LO and COX enzymes have been implicated in many  . PLA(2) is activated by phospholipase-A(2)-activating protein (PLAP) and LO by 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP). The inducible form of COX-2 enzyme, which is usually not present under basal conditions, is induced in inflammation. In this article the function of these enzymes in eicosanoid synthesis, their regulation, and their implication in  disorders will be reviewed. The properties, function and regulation of the protein activators PLAP and FLAP will also be discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27227540>Serum Fatty Acids Are Correlated with Inflammatory Cytokines in Ulcerative .</a></h2><p>Ulcerative  (UC) is associated with increased dietary intake of fat and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Modification of fat metabolism may alter inflammation and disease severity. Our aim was to assess differences in dietary and serum fatty  levels between control and UC subjects and associations with disease activity and inflammatory cytokines.Dietary histories, serum, and colonic tissue samples were prospectively collected from 137 UC subjects and 38 controls. Both histologic injury and the Mayo Disease Activity Index were assessed. Serum and tissue cytokines were measured by Luminex assay. Serum fatty acids were obtained by gas chromatography.UC subjects had increased total fat and oleic  (OA) intake, but decreased  (AA) intake vs controls. In serum, there was less percent saturated fatty  (SFA) and AA, with higher monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), linoleic , OA, eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and docosapentaenoic  (DPA) in UC. Tissue cytokine levels were directly correlated with SFA and inversely correlated with PUFA, EPA, and DPA in UC subjects, but not controls. 5-aminosalicylic  therapy blunted these associations.In summary, we found differences in serum fatty acids in UC subjects that correlated with pro-inflammatory tissue cytokines.

Moreover, it is the main interface with the external environment, and maintenance and regulation of the epithelial structure and epithelial barrier function are key determinants of digestive health and host well being. The tight junction, a multiprotein complex composed of transmembrane proteins associated with the cytoskeletal peri-junctional ring of actin and myosin, is an essential component of this barrier that is strictly regulated in a spatio-temporal manner by a complex signaling network. Defects in the intestinal epithelial barrier function have been observed in , and a classic example of the connection between inflammation and cancer is the increased risk of colorectal cancer in patients with . In recent years, several molecules have emerged as critical players contributing to inflammation-associated colorectal cancer. For example, eicosanoids derived from  are proposed as mediators involved in the regulation of epithelial structure/function. Interestingly, the tissue concentration of eicosanoids increases during mucosal inflammation and colorectal cancer development. This overview focuses on the physiological and physiopathological roles of eicosanoids in cell growth/cell differentiation/apoptosis and in the paracellular permeability of the intestinal epithelium.

COX-2 is mainly induced at sites of inflammation in response to proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1α/β, interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α produced by  cells.The aim of this study was to investigate the possible modulating effect of the functional COX-2 polymorphisms -1195 A→G and -765G→C on the risk for development of  (IBD) in a Dutch population.Genomic DNA of 525 patients with Crohn's  (CD), 211 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 973 healthy controls was genotyped for the -1195 A→G (rs689466) and -765G→C (rs20417) polymorphisms. Distribution of genotypes in patients and controls were compared and genotype-phenotype interactions were investigated.The genotype distribution of the -1195A→G polymorphism was not different between the patients with CD or UC and the control group. The -765GG genotype was more prevalent in CD patients compared to controls with an OR of 1.33 (95%CI 1.04-1.69, p<0.05).

Combining homozygous and heterozygous patients with the -765C allele showed a reduced risk for developing CD, with an OR of 0.75 (95%CI: 0.59-0.96). In the context of this, the G(-1195)G(-765)/A(-1195)C(-765) diplotype was significantly less common in patients with CD compared to controls, with an OR of 0.62 (95%CI: 0.39-0.98).

The recent development of ultrasensitive methods has made it possible to detect these epsilon-adducts in vivo and to study their formation and role in experimental and human carcinogenesis. The promutagenic epsilon-DNA modifications can be detected by immunoaffinity/32P-postlabelling or by immunohistochemistry. When epsilon-adducts are excised from tissue DNA, the modified nucleosides can be quantified in urine by an immunoaffinity-HPLC-fluorescence method. Highly variable background levels of epsilon-adducts were detected in tissues from unexposed humans and rodents, suggesting an endogenous pathway of formation from reaction of trans-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (via its 2,3-epoxide) with DNA bases. Several known cancer risk factors increased the level of these DNA lesions: Elevated epsilon-adducts were found in hepatic DNA from patients with excess metal storage (haemochromatosis, Wilson's ), resulting in oxidative stress and high risk of liver cancer. Reactive O/N-intermediates generated during  processes, for example in patients with  (IBD) and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) led to the formation of epsilon-adducts likely through peroxynitrite-mediated LPO and/or increased oxidative  metabolism. A high omega-6-polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) diet increased epsilon-DNA adducts in white blood cells (WBC), particularly in female subjects (about 40-fold), while the level of adducted malondialdehyde in deoxyguanosine of WBC-DNA was only moderately elevated. In conclusion, there is now growing evidence that epsilon-adducts were elevated in cancer-prone patients and in rodents (liver, pancreas, colon, skin), suggesting that promutagenic epsilon-adducts, when formed as a consequence of persistent oxidative stress, can drive cells to malignancy. Therefore, biomonitoring of exocyclic DNA adducts offers useful tools: (i) to evaluate the etiological contributions of dietary fats, oxidative stress, and chronic /infectious processes; (ii) to verify the efficacy of chemopreventive agents on endogenous DNA damage and cancer risk; and (iii) to gain mechanistic insights into the role of oxidative stress/LPO-derived lesions in the initiation and progression of human cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23660296>Anti- mechanisms of bioactive milk proteins in the intestine of newborns.</a></h2><p>The human newborn infant is susceptible to gut  disorders. In particular, growth-restricted infants or infants born prematurely may develop a severe form of intestinal inflammation known as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), which has a high mortality. Milk provides a multitude of proteins with anti- properties and in this review we gather together some recent significant advances regarding the isolation and proteomic identification of these minor constituents of both human and bovine milk. We introduce the process of inflammation, with a focus on the immature gut, and describe how a multitude of milk proteins act against the  process according to both in vitro and in vivo studies. We highlight the effects of milk proteins such as caseins, and of whey proteins such as alpha-lactalbumin, beta-lactoglobulin, lactoferrin, osteopontin, immunoglobulins, trefoil factors, lactoperoxidase, superoxide dismutase, platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase, alkaline phosphatase, and growth factors (TGF-β, IGF-I and IGF-II, EGF, HB-EGF). The effects of milk fat globule proteins, such as TLR-2, TLR-4, sCD14 and MFG-E8/lactadherin, are also discussed.

We recently reported that PLA2 mediates hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) to lysophosphatidylcholine (L-PC) when both are applied to the apical surface of cultured EC monolayers, resulting in increased bacterial translocation (BT) and decreased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Free fatty acids (FFA) are the other products of this reaction, however, their effect on Caco-2 cell permeability has not been reported. In addition to PC, other luminal phospholipids are present at the surface of the enterocyte. PLA2 may also mediate the hydrolysis of luminal phospholipids other than PC. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of phospholipids other than PC and common FFA on intestinal epithelial permeability and BT. Human Caco-2 enterocytes were grown to confluence on porous filters in the apical chamber of a two-chamber cell-culture system. Monolayer integrity and tight-junction permeability were measured as TEER. First, common FFA released by PC hydrolysis were determined using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). In separate experiments, monolayers were treated with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (L-PE), or palmitoleic , oleic acids, linoleic acids, and  solubilized in solution with PC. The magnitude of BT was determined 2 h after treatment by adding Escherichia coli C25 to the apical chamber followed by quantitatively culturing basal-chamber samples. Statistical analysis was by the Kurosaki-Wallis test. TLC of PC samples incubated with PLA2 on the apical surface of Caco-2 monolayers demonstrated the production of palmitoleic , oleic acids, linoleic acids, and . L-PE significantly decreased TEER compared to controls, but to a lesser degree than L-PC alone. L-PE had no effects on BT. Palmitoleic  and oleic  likewise significantly decreased TEER compared to controls, however, less than L-PC. All FFA tested had no effect on BT. Phospholipids applied to the apical surface of enterocytes, such as those found in vivo in mucus, can be hydrolyzed by the enzyme PLA2 resulting in lysophospholipid and FFA species that can alter enterocyte monolayer permeability. However, FFA and L-PL, other than L-PC, appear to have no effect to stimulate BT. This observation may have clinical implications in the pathogenesis and treatment strategies for IBD patients in whom enterocyte PLA2 activity has been shown to be elevated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24837228>The universe of  metabolites in : can we tell the good from the bad?</a></h2><p>This review summarizes recent developments in the role of soluble mediators of inflammation, particularly  metabolites, in  (IBD).The role of prostaglandin E2 in immune regulation has been better defined. Prostaglandin E2 promotes not only immune tolerance and epithelial homeostasis but also the proinflammatory Th17 pathway. Prostaglandin D2 has been established as promoting the resolution of inflammation in the gastrointestinal mucosa.

In a rabbit model of chronic intestinal inflammation, B0AT1 is inhibited secondary to a decrease in the number of co-transporters in the brush border membrane (BBM). This inhibition can be reversed by treatment with a broad-spectrum immune modulator such as glucocorticoid suggesting that immune inflammatory mediators may regulate B0AT1 during chronic intestinal inflammation.  (AA) metabolites (AAM) are increased during chronic intestinal inflammation. However, whether AAM may regulate B0AT1 during chronic intestinal inflammation is unknown. Treatment of rabbits with ATK, to prevent the release of AAM reversed the inhibition of B0AT1. AAM are products of cyclooxygenase (COX) and/or lipoxygenase (LOX) pathways. Inhibition of COX with piroxicam, therefore reduction of prostaglandin formation in the chronically inflamed intestine, reversed the inhibition of B0AT1 to its normal levels. In contrast, inhibition of LOX with MK886, thus reduction of leukotriene formation during chronic enteritis, did not affect the inhibition of B0AT1. Kinetic studies showed that the mechanism of restoration of B0AT1 by ATK or piroxicam was secondary to the restoration of BBM co-transporter numbers. Western Blot analysis also demonstrated restoration of BBM B0AT1 co-transporter numbers. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that Na-glutamine co-transport mediated by B0AT1 in villus cells is regulated by prostaglandins rather than leukotrienes in the chronically inflamed intestine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12494894>COX-2, NSAIDs and human neoplasia. Part I: Colorectal neoplasms.</a></h2><p>Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), the inducible cyclooxygenase isozyme involved in the conversion of  (AA) to biologically active prostanoids, has become the subject of intense interest during the last few years. The recent surge of interest stems from seminal studies that correlated elevated expression of COX-2 with tumor induction and progression, and epidemiological studies that correlated reduced risk of developing certain types of cancers with chronic use of non-steroidal anti- agents (NSAIDs). Although these observations were first reported with colorectal cancer (CRC), similar findings have subsequently been made with other types of cancers. A wide spectrum of studies continue to be undertaken in both laboratory and clinical settings to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these anti-tumor effects of COX-2 for potential translation into cancer chemoprevention and therapy. The aim of this article is to present a review of COX genes, the prostaglandin-cyclooxygenase relationship, the role of COX-2 in carcinogenesis and the rationale for targeting COX-2 with NSAIDs for cancer chemoprevention. Special emphasis is given to the role of COX-2 expression in the genesis and progression of colorectal neoplasia, and its correlation with other pathological characteristics of CRC.

It has been shown that nutritional support not only improves the nutritional condition of the patients, but in Crohn's  it also has an effect on the activity of the , although this effect is smaller than that of steroids. Elemental diets are no more efficient than polymeric diets except under very special circumstances, but they are more expensive and patients tolerate them worse. A digestive pause is not recommended unless there is an absolute contraindication for the use of the digestive tract. Therefore, parenteral nutrition, which is more expensive and can cause serious complications, will be reserved for very specific indications. The use of fish oil supplements, either because it competes with  and prevents the initiation of the  cascade, or because it decreases the production of cytokines, has shown to be potentially useful in  intestinal , and this must be confirmed by further studies. Short chain fatty acids enemas have shown promising results in distal ulcerative colitis but the lack of homogeneity in the studies makes it necessary for these results to be consolidated in new studies.

The hypothesis developed from experiments on rodents that perinodal adipocytes are specialized to provision adjacent lymphoid tissues was tested by comparing the composition of triacylglycerol and phospholipid fatty acids in homologous samples of mesenteric adipose tissue and lymph nodes from patients with or without CD.Mesenteric perinodal and other adipose tissue and lymph nodes were collected during elective surgery for CD and other conditions. Fatty acids were extracted, identified, and quantified by thin-layer and gas-liquid chromatography.Perinodal adipose tissue contained more unsaturated fatty acids than other adipose tissue in controls, as reported for other mammals, but site-specific differences were absent in CD. Lipids from adipose and lymphoid tissues had more saturated fatty acids but fewer polyunsaturates in patients with CD than controls. In adipose tissue samples, depletion of n-3 polyunsaturates was greatest, but n-6 polyunsaturates, particularly , were preferentially reduced in lymphoid cells. Ratios of n-6/n-3 polyunsaturates were higher in adipose tissue but lower in lymphoid cells in patients with CD than in controls.Site-specific differences in fatty  composition in normal human mesentery are consistent with local interactions between lymph node lymphoid cells and adjacent adipose tissue. These site-specific properties are absent in CD, causing anomalies in composition of lymphoid cell fatty acids, which may explain the efficacy of elemental diets containing oils rich in n-6 polyunsaturates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19212003>Ulcerative colitis in AKR mice is attenuated by intraperitoneally administered anandamide.</a></h2><p>Anti- and anti-nociceptive properties of endocannabinoids and synthetic cannabinoid compounds were described previously.

PN was given for 7 days, small  mucosa-derived cytokines, animal survival rate, epithelial cell (EC) proliferation and apoptosis rates, intestinal barrier function and mucosal FA composition were analyzed.Compared to the SBFE and SMOF groups, the best survival, highest EC proliferation and lowest EC apoptosis rates were observed in the OOFE group; and associated with the lowest levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β expression. Jejunal FA content showed higher levels of eicosapentaenoic and docosapentaenoic  in the SMOF group and the highest  in the OOFE group.The study showed that PN containing OOFE had beneficial effects to small  health and animal survival.

Recently we reported that one of the serotonin-fatty  conjugates, docosahexaenoyl serotonin (DHA-5-HT), previously found in gut tissue of mouse and pig, attenuates the IL-23-IL-17 signaling axis in LPS-stimulated mice macrophages. However, its presence and effects in humans remained to be elucidated. Here, we report for the first time its identification in human intestinal (colon) tissue, along with a series of related N-acyl serotonins. Furthermore, we tested these fatty  conjugates for their ability to inhibit the release of IL-17 and CCL-20 by stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Serotonin conjugates with palmitic  (PA-5-HT), stearic  (SA-5-HT) and oleic  (OA-5-HT) were detected in higher levels than arachidonoyl serotonin (AA-5-HT) and DHA-5-HT, while eicosapentaenoyl serotonin (EPA-5-HT) could not be quantified. Among these, DHA-5-HT was the most potent in inhibiting IL-17 and CCL-20, typical Th17 pro-inflammatory mediators, by Concanavalin A (ConA)-stimulated human PBMCs. These results underline the idea that DHA-5-HT is a gut-specific endogenously produced mediator with the capacity to modulate the IL-17/Th17 signaling response.

Thirty-five oxylipins and 11 eCBs were quantified by means of ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Levels of mRNA for 10 cytokines were measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.Levels of ω-6-related oxylipins were significantly elevated in treatment-naïve patients with respect to controls, whereas the levels of ω-3 eCBs were lower. 15S-Hydroxy-eicosatrienoic  (15S-HETrE) was significantly upregulated in UC deep remission patients compared with controls. All investigated cytokines had significantly higher mRNA levels in the inflamed mucosa of treatment-naïve UC patients. Cytokine gene expression was positively correlated with several ω-6 -related oxylipins, whereas negative correlation was found with lipoxin, prostacyclin, and the eCBs.Increased levels of ω-6-related oxylipins and decreased levels of ω-3-related eCBs are associated with the debut of UC.

While LTB4 was once thought to be a chemoattractant and activator only of leukocytes mediating acute, innate  responses, LTB4 receptors have since been discovered on multiple cell types, including T-lymphocytes and antigen-presenting dendritic cells. Thus, the inhibition of LTB4 synthesis demonstrates potential for targeting chronic, autoimmune-driven inflammation. In addition to genetic data in animals and humans linking the LTB4 pathway to cardiovascular , variants in the LTA4H gene have been linked with susceptibility to asthma. Several companies have initiated drug discovery efforts to identify potent, selective LTA4H inhibitors. Selected molecules have demonstrated oral efficacy in preclinical models of asthma,  and arthritis, suggesting therapeutic potential for multiple indications. This review focuses on developments with therapeutic relevance for inhibitors of LTA4H as anti- drugs, and particularly in the treatment of respiratory .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19035968>Plasma lipids and inflammation in active .</a></h2><p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's  (CD) can cause metabolic and  alterations.To evaluate the relationships between  parameters, plasma lipids and phospholipid fatty  (FA) composition in patients with active UC and CD.Diet, the Harvey-Bradshaw Activity Index (HBAI),  parameters, lipoproteins and FA composition were assessed in 60 CD and 34 UC.No differences in clinical parameters were observed in the two groups. Total cholesterol correlated inversely with the number of  movements in both groups and directly with BMI in UC.  correlated inversely with HBAI in UC and total and HDL cholesterol were inversely related to C-reactive protein (CRP) in CD while HDL correlated with CRP in UC. Docosapentaenoic  was the only polyunsaturated n-3 FA that was correlated to CRP in both groups. Total cholesterol was independently associated in the multiple regression analysis with the number of  movements and systemic inflammation.Total and LDL cholesterol were lower in the active UC and CD than in the healthy subjects and were correlated with the systemic  status. Phospholipid FA composition was correlated to the systemic  status, but was unrelated to dietary intake and intestinal  activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18504706>Polyunsaturated fatty acids,  processes and .</a></h2><p>With regard to  processes, the main fatty acids of interest are the n-6 PUFA  (AA), which is the precursor of  eicosanoids like prostaglandin E(2) and leukotriene B(4), and the n-3 PUFAs eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA). EPA and DHA are found in oily fish and fish oils. EPA and DHA inhibit AA metabolism to  eicosanoids. They also give rise to mediators that are less  than those produced from AA or that are anti-. In addition to modifying the lipid mediator profile, n-3 PUFAs exert effects on other aspects of inflammation like leukocyte chemotaxis and  cytokine production. Some of these effects are likely due to changes in gene expression, as a result of altered transcription factor activity. Fish oil has been shown to decrease colonic damage and inflammation, weight loss and mortality in animal models of colitis. Fish oil supplementation in patients with  results in n-3 PUFA incorporation into gut mucosal tissue and modification of  mediator profiles. Clinical outcomes have been variably affected by fish oil, although some trials report improved gut histology, decreased  activity, use of corticosteroids and relapse.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25747113>Zileuton, 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, acts as a chemopreventive agent in intestinal polyposis, by modulating polyp and systemic inflammation.</a></h2><p>Leukotrienes and prostaglandins, products of  metabolism, sustain both systemic and lesion-localized inflammation. Tumor-associated Inflammation can also contribute to the pathogenesis of colon cancer. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have increased risk of developing colon cancer. The levels of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), the key enzyme for leukotrienes production, are increased in colon cancer specimens and colonic dysplastic lesions. Here we report that Zileuton, a specific 5-LO inhibitor, can prevent polyp formation by efficiently reducing the tumor-associated and systemic inflammation in APCΔ468 mice.In the current study, we inhibited 5-LO by dietary administration of Zileuton in the APCΔ468 mouse model of polyposis and analyzed the effect of in vivo 5-LO inhibition on tumor-associated and systemic inflammation.Zileuton-fed mice developed fewer polyps and displayed marked reduction in systemic and polyp-associated inflammation. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and pro-inflammatory innate and adaptive immunity cells were reduced both in the lesions and systemically. As part of tumor-associated inflammation Leukotriene B4 (LTB4), product of 5-LO activity, is increased focally in human dysplastic lesions. The 5-LO enzymatic activity was reduced in the serum of Zileuton treated polyposis mice.This study demonstrates that dietary administration of 5-LO specific inhibitor in the polyposis mouse model decreases polyp burden, and suggests that Zileuton may be a potential chemo-preventive agent in patients that are high-risk of developing colon cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24213461>Preclinical cancer chemoprevention studies using animal model of inflammation-associated colorectal carcinogenesis.</a></h2><p>Inflammation is involved in all stages of carcinogenesis. , such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's  is a longstanding   of intestine with increased risk for colorectal cancer (CRC). Several molecular events involved in chronic  process are reported to contribute to multi-step carcinogenesis of CRC in the inflamed colon. They include over-production of free radicals, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, up-regulation of  enzymes in  biosynthesis pathway, up-regulation of certain cytokines, and intestinal immune system dysfunction. In this article, firstly I briefly introduce our experimental animal models where colorectal neoplasms rapidly develop in the inflamed colorectum.

Chronic inflammation, which is detrimental to tissues, is the basic pathogenic mechanism of hypersensitivity reactions against xenobiotics. Other frequent pathologies, for instance atherosclerosis, chronic hepatitis,  (IBD), liver cirrhosis, lung fibrosis, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis are also chronic  . Chemical mediators of inflammation are derived from blood plasma or different cell-type activity. Biogenic amines, eicosanoids and cytokines are within the most important mediators of  processes. The different activities of eicosanoids derived from  (20:4 n-6) versus those derived from eicosapentaenoic  (20:5 n-3) are one of the most important mechanisms to explain why n-3, or omega-3, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) exhibit anti- properties in many  . Dietary supplements ranging 1-8 g per day of n-3 PUFA have been reportedly beneficial in the treatment of IBD, eczema, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, recent experimental studies in rats with experimental ulcerative colitis, induced by intrarectal injection of trinitrobenzene sulphonic , have documented that treatment with n-3 long-chain PUFA reduces mucosal damage as assessed by biochemical and histological markers of inflammation. Moreover, the defence antioxidant system in this model is enhanced in treated animals, provided that the n-3 PUFA supply is adequately preserved from oxidation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20500789>Fatty acids from fish: the anti- potential of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids.</a></h2><p>Omega-6 (n-6) and omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are precursors of potent lipid mediators, termed eicosanoids, which play an important role in the regulation of inflammation. Eicosanoids derived from n-6 PUFAs (e.g., ) have proinflammatory and immunoactive functions, whereas eicosanoids derived from n-3 PUFAs [e.g., eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA)] have anti- properties, traditionally attributed to their ability to inhibit the formation of n-6 PUFA-derived eicosanoids. While the typical Western diet has a much greater ratio of n-6 PUFAs compared with n-3 PUFAs, research has shown that by increasing the ratio of n-3 to n-6 fatty acids in the diet, and consequently favoring the production of EPA in the body, or by increasing the dietary intake of EPA and DHA through consumption of fatty fish or fish-oil supplements, reductions may be achieved in the incidence of many chronic  that involve  processes; most notably, these include cardiovascular ,  (IBD), cancer, and rheumatoid arthritis, but psychiatric and neurodegenerative illnesses are other examples.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18406516>Pro- prostaglandins and progression of colorectal cancer.</a></h2><p>Chronic inflammation is a risk factor for several gastrointestinal malignancies, including esophageal, gastric, hepatic, pancreatic and colorectal cancer. It has long been known that long-term use of nonsteroidal anti- drugs (NSAIDs) reduces the relative risk of developing colorectal cancer. NSAIDs exert their anti- and anti-tumor effects primarily by inhibiting activity of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. Cyclooxygenase enzymes catalyze the conversion of  into prostanoids, including prostaglandins (PGs) and thromboxanes (TXs). Emerging evidence demonstrates that prostaglandins play an important role in inflammation and cancer. In this review, we highlight recent breakthroughs in our understanding of the roles of the different prostaglandins in colorectal cancer (CRC) and  (IBD). These findings may provide a rationale for the development of new anti- therapeutic approaches to cancer prevention and/or treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27140063>The  metabolite 11β-ProstaglandinF2α controls intestinal epithelial healing: deficiency in patients with Crohn's disease.</a></h2><p>In healthy gut enteric glial cells (EGC) are essential to intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB) functions. In Crohn's Disease (CD), both EGC phenotype and IEB functions are altered, but putative involvement of EGC in CD pathogenesis remains unknown and study of human EGC are lacking. EGC isolated from CD and control patients showed similar expression of glial markers and EGC-derived soluble factors (IL6, TGF-β, proEGF, GSH) but CD EGC failed to increase IEB resistance and healing. Lipid profiling showed that CD EGC produced decreased amounts of 15-HETE, 18-HEPE, 15dPGJ2 and 11βPGF2α as compared to healthy EGC. They also had reduced expression of the L-PGDS and AKR1C3 enzymes. Produced by healthy EGC, the 11βPGF2 activated PPARγ receptor of intestinal epithelial cells to induce cell spreading and IEB wound repair. In addition to this novel healing mechanism our data show that CD EGC presented impaired ability to promote IEB functions through defect in L-PGDS-AKR1C3-11βPGF2α dependent pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21551239>Increasing endogenous 2-arachidonoylglycerol levels counteracts colitis and related systemic inflammation.</a></h2><p> (IBDs) are chronic  conditions for which new therapeutic approaches are needed. Genetic and pharmacological data point to a protective role of CB(1) and CB(2) cannabinoid receptor activation in IBD experimental models. Therefore, increasing the endogenous levels of 2-arachidonoylglycerol, the main full agonist of these receptors, should have beneficial effects on colitis. 2-Arachidonoylglycerol levels were raised in the trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS)-induced colitis mouse model by inhibiting monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), the primary enzyme responsible for hydrolysis of 2-arachidonoylglycerol, using the selective inhibitor JZL184. MAGL inhibition in diseased mice increased 2-arachidonoylglycerol levels, leading to a reduction of macroscopic and histological colon alterations, as well as of colonic expression of proinflammatory cytokines. The restored integrity of the intestinal barrier function after MAGL inhibition resulted in reduced endotoxemia as well as reduced peripheral and brain inflammation. Coadministration of either CB(1) (SR141716A) or CB(2) (AM630) selective antagonists with JZL184 completely abolished the protective effect of MAGL inhibition on TNBS-induced colon alterations, thus demonstrating the involvement of both cannabinoid receptors. In conclusion, increasing 2-arachidonoylglycerol levels resulted in a dramatic reduction of colitis and of the related systemic and central inflammation. This could offer a novel pharmacological approach for the treatment of IBD based on the new protective role of 2-arachidonoylglycerol described here.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28800645>Analysis of endogenous lipids during intestinal wound healing.</a></h2><p>Intestinal wound healing is a new therapeutic goal for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as complete healing of the mucosa is the key element of clinical remission in IBD. Previous studies showed that termination of inflammation can be achieved by adding pro-resolving lipids like DHA and EPA exogenously. However, the roles of these lipids in mucosal healing have not been investigated. To recapitulate intestinal healing process, mice were received dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) for 7 days in the drinking water followed by regular tap water for 5 additional days. DSS-induced intestinal inflammation featuring body weight loss, histological tissue damage, increased cytokine production and infiltration of inflammatory cells was gradually reduced upon switching to water. To investigate whether endogenous lipids play a role in mucosal healing, the lipidomics analysis of mouse serum was performed. Reduced levels of , the biosynthetic precursor of prostaglandin F (PGF)2α, 19H-PGF1α, the metabolite of prostacyclin, and 20H-PGF2α, the metabolite of PGF2α, suggest subsiding inflammation. In contrast, increased levels of an active metabolite of resolvin D1 along with decreased levels of its precursor DHA as well as decreased levels of the precursor of resolvin E, 18-hydroxy-eicosapentaenoic , suggest inauguration of mucosal healing by endogenous lipids. Furthermore, exogenously supplied fish oil enhanced the process even further. These results suggest the presence of mucosal healing regulated by endogenous pro-healing lipids and also indicate that the remission state of IBD could be prolonged by enhancing the levels of these lipids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22570770>Health implications of high dietary omega-6 polyunsaturated Fatty acids.</a></h2><p>Omega-6 (n-6) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (e.g.,  (AA)) and omega-3 (n-3) PUFA (e.g., eicosapentaenoic  (EPA)) are precursors to potent lipid mediator signalling molecules, termed "eicosanoids," which have important roles in the regulation of inflammation. In general, eicosanoids derived from n-6 PUFA are proinflammatory while eicosanoids derived from n-3 PUFA are anti-. Dietary changes over the past few decades in the intake of n-6 and n-3 PUFA show striking increases in the (n-6) to (n-3) ratio (~15 : 1), which are associated with greater metabolism of the n-6 PUFA compared with n-3 PUFA. Coinciding with this increase in the ratio of (n-6) : (n-3) PUFA are increases in chronic   such as nonalcoholic fatty liver  (NAFLD), cardiovascular , obesity,  (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis, and Alzheimer's  (AD).

Through its metabolism of the EETs and other lipid mediators, sEH contributes to the regulation of vascular tone, nociception, angiogenesis and the  response. Because of its central physiological role in  states such as cardiac hypertrophy, diabetes, hypertension, and pain sEH is being investigated as a therapeutic target. This review begins with a brief introduction to sEH protein structure and function. sEH evolution and gene structure are then discussed before human small nucleotide polymorphisms and mammalian gene expression are described in the context of several  models.

Epoxidation of  by cytochrome P450 enzymes during inflammation yields epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs). EETs have a variety of biological effects including modulation of inflammation, vascular smooth muscle migration and platelet aggregation. The EETs levels are regulated by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), the major enzyme responsible for their degradation and conversion to inactive dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs); thereby limiting many of the biological actions of EETs. The molecular and pharmacological inhibition of sEH has been studied extensively for benefits on the cardiovascular system. More recent studies suggest the importance of EETs and sEH in pain and inflammation. This review will discuss the current status and emerging evidence on the role of sEH and sEH inhibitors in chronic  conditions such as atherosclerosis, colitis and arthritis. Although steroids and non-steroidal anti- drugs are effective, their chronic use is limited by the metabolic and cardiovascular side effects. Currently there are no small molecule drugs for treatment of chronic inflammation and associated pain and sEH inhibitors with their intrinsic cardiovascular protective effects can potentially fill this void.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10833065>Nutritional supplementation with N-3 fatty acids and antioxidants in patients with Crohn's  in remission: effects on antioxidant status and fatty  profile.</a></h2><p>In patients with Crohn's  (CD), malnutrition is frequently observed and is generally accepted to be an important issue. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 3 months of supplementation with a liquid formula containing either antioxidants (AO) or n-3 fatty acids plus AO on the antioxidant status and fatty  profile of plasma phospholipids and adipose tissue, respectively, in patients with long-standing CD currently in remission. In a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study, CD patients received either placebo, AO, or n-3 fatty acids plus AO for 3 months in addition to their regular diet. In all, 25/37 CD patients completed the study. AO status was assessed by blood biochemical parameters. A statistical per-protocol analysis was performed. Serum concentrations of selenium, vitamin C, and vitamin E, the activity of superoxide dismutase and total antioxidant status were significantly (p < 0.05) increased after AO supplementation. Furthermore, compared with controls, serum concentrations of beta-carotene, selenium, and vitamin C and the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were significantly (p < 0.05) lower before supplementation; however, after AO supplementation these levels were not significantly different from controls (except for GPx). N-3 fatty acids plus AO supplementation significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the proportion of , and increased the proportion of eicosapentanoic  and docosahexanoic  in both plasma phospholipids and adipose tissue. Supplementation with antioxidants improved antioxidant status in patients with CD in remission. In addition, supplementation with n-3 fatty acids plus antioxidants significantly changed the eicosanoid precursor profile, which may lead to the production of eicosanoids with attenuated proinflammatory activity. This study indicates that an immunomodulating formula containing n-3 fatty acids and/or AO may have the potential to play a role in the treatment of CD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23306839>The fatty  profile of the erythrocyte membrane in initial-onset  patients.</a></h2><p>The sudden change in the dietary habits of the Japanese population towards a European/American-style diet since the 1960s is thought to be responsible for the recent increase in the incidence of  (IBD) in Japan. Dietary fatty  intake influences the fatty  profiles of vital cell membranes, which might be a source of  mediators.We investigated the fatty  composition of the erythrocyte membrane in 90 healthy Japanese and 43 initial-onset IBD patients (ulcerative colitis, UC: 25; Crohn's , CD: 18) who had not undergone any dietary intervention to examine the role fatty acids play in the onset of IBD.The erythrocyte membrane n-3/n-6 ratio of the initial-onset IBD patients was 0.42 ± 0.13, which was not significantly different from that of the healthy Japanese subjects (0.41 ± 0.13). However, the CD patients displayed a significantly lower mean percentage weight (MPW) of linoleic  (LA) than the healthy subjects (8.25 ± 1.75 vs. 9.90 ± 1.29; p < 0.001), while their MPW of  (AA) was significantly higher than those of the healthy subjects and UC patients (11.22 ± 2.18 vs. 9.76 ± 1.64, p < 0.01; vs. 9.58 ± 1.97, p < 0.01, respectively). The mean delta 6-desaturation index of the CD patients was significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects (1.61 ± 0.65 vs. 1.11 ± 0.26; p < 0.001).The CD patients displayed significantly higher and lower MPW of AA and LA, respectively, than the healthy subjects, suggesting that delta 6-desaturase is hyperactivated in CD.

Inflammation is the cause of several diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, multiple sclerosis, and asthma. The search for agents inhibiting inflammation is a great challenge as the inflammatory response plays an important role in the defense of the host to infections. Marine invertebrates are exceptional sources of new natural products, and among those diterpenoids secondary metabolites exhibit notable anti-inflammatory properties. Novel anti-inflammatory diterpenoids, exclusively produced by marine organisms, have been identified and synthetic molecules based on those structures have been obtained. The anti-inflammatory activity of marine diterpenoids has been attributed to the inhibition of Nuclear Factor-κB activation and to the modulation of  metabolism. However, more research is necessary to describe the mechanisms of action of these secondary metabolites. This review is a compilation of marine diterpenoids, mainly isolated from corals, which have been described as potential anti-inflammatory molecules.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20888819>Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 activated  signals by intestinal epithelial cells and colitis in mice.</a></h2><p>Ligand-gated calcium channels have been reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of . One family member, transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4), is activated by  derivatives that might be released on inflammation, yet its role in gastrointestinal inflammation has not been characterized. We investigated whether TRPV4 activation participates in intestinal inflammation and its expression and functions in the gastrointestinal tract.TRPV4 expression was studied in human colon samples, human intestinal epithelial cell lines (Caco-2 and T84), and inflamed colons of mice. Calcium mobilization and cytokine release were analyzed in intestinal epithelial cells exposed to the selective TRPV4 agonist 4α-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate (4αPDD). Mice were killed 3, 6, or 24 hours after intracolonic administration of 4αPDD;  parameters were measured in their colon tissues, and paracellular colonic permeability was measured by the passage of (51)Cr-EDTA from the colon lumen to the blood.High levels of TRPV4 were detected in Caco-2 cells and in epithelial cells of human colon tissue samples; its expression was up-regulated in colons from inflamed mice compared with noninflamed control mice. Administration of 4αPDD to Caco-2 and T84 cells caused a dose-dependent increase in intracellular calcium concentration and chemokine release. In mice, intracolonic administration of 4αPDD caused colitis to develop 3 to 6 hours later; inflammation resolved by 24 hours. Increased colonic permeability was observed in vivo 3 hours after intracolonic administration of 4αPDD.TRPV4 is expressed and functional in intestinal epithelial cells; its activation in the gastrointestinal tract causes increases in intracellular calcium concentrations, chemokine release, and colitis.Copyright © 2011 AGA Institute.

Diet and genetics influence fatty  profiles. Abnormalities of fatty  profiles have been observed in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), a group of complex diseases defined by chronic gastrointestinal inflammation. IBD associated fatty  profile abnormalities were observed independently of nutritional status or disease activity, suggesting a common genetic background. However, no study so far has attempted to look for overlap between IBD loci and fatty  associated loci or investigate the genetics of fatty  profiles in IBD. To this end, we conducted a comprehensive genetic study of fatty  profiles in IBD using iCHIP, a custom microarray platform designed for deep sequencing of immune-mediated disease associated loci. This study identifies 10 loci associated with fatty  profiles in IBD. The most significant associations were a locus near CBS (p = 7.62 × 10) and a locus in LRRK2 (p = 1.4 × 10). Of note, this study replicates the FADS gene cluster locus, previously associated with both fatty  profiles and IBD pathogenesis.

The actions of PEA are terminated following hydrolysis by 2 enzymes: fatty  amide hydrolase (FAAH), and the less-studied N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing  amidase (NAAA). This study aims to investigate the effects of inhibiting the enzymes responsible for PEA hydrolysis in colon inflammation in order to propose a potential therapeutic target for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Two murine models of IBD were used to assess the effects of NAAA inhibition, FAAH inhibition, and PEA on macroscopic signs of colon inflammation, macrophage/neutrophil infiltration, and the expression of proinflammatory mediators in the colon, as well as on the -related systemic inflammation. NAAA inhibition increases PEA levels in the colon and reduces colon inflammation and systemic inflammation, similarly to PEA. FAAH inhibition, however, does not increase PEA levels in the colon and does not affect the macroscopic signs of colon inflammation or immune cell infiltration. This is the first report of an anti-inflammatory effect of a systemically administered NAAA inhibitor. Because NAAA is the enzyme responsible for the control of PEA levels in the colon, we put forth this enzyme as a potential therapeutic target in chronic inflammation in general and IBD in particular.© FASEB.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22518340>Development of an inflammation-associated colorectal cancer model and its application for research on carcinogenesis and chemoprevention.</a></h2><p>Chronic inflammation is a well-recognized risk factor for development of human cancer in several tissues, including large . , including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's , is a longstanding   of intestine with increased risk for colorectal cancer development.

On this basis, we aimed to investigate anandamide metabolism in celiac  by analyzing transcript levels (through quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction), protein concentration (through immunoblotting) and activity (through radioassays) of enzymes responsible for anandamide synthesis (N-acylphosphatidyl-ethanolamine specific phospholipase D, NAPE-PLD) and degradation (fatty  amide hydrolase, FAAH) in the duodenal mucosa of untreated celiac patients, celiac patients on a gluten-free diet for at least 12 months and control subjects. Also, treated celiac biopsies cultured ex vivo with peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin were investigated. Our in vivo experiments showed that mucosal NAPE-PLD expression and activity are higher in untreated celiac patients than treated celiac patients and controls, with no significant difference between the latter two groups. In keeping with the in vivo data, the ex vivo activity of NAPE-PLD was significantly enhanced by incubation of peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin with treated celiac biopsies. On the contrary, in vivo mucosal FAAH expression and activity did not change in the three groups of patients, and accordingly, mucosal FAAH activity was not influenced by treatment with peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin. In conclusion, our findings provide a possible pathophysiological explanation for the increased anandamide concentration previously shown in active celiac mucosa.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Subsequent enzymatic conversion of LTA (4) yields LTB (4) and the cysteinyl-LTs C (4), D (4) and E (4). LTs have prominent functions in pathophysiology and are connected to numerous disorders including bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis,   and skin , rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, osteoporosis and cardiovascular . Pharmacological and genetic interruption of the 5-LO pathway or blockade of LT receptors, serving as means for intervention with LTs, may be of therapeutic value for certain related disorders. Natural or plant-derived substances were among the first 5-LO inhibitors identified in the early 1980 s. To date, a huge number of diverse plant-derived compounds have been reported to interfere with 5-LO product synthesis. However, many investigations have addressed the efficacy of a given compound solely in cellular test systems and analysis of direct interference with 5-LO has been neglected. In the first part of this review, the biology and molecular pharmacology of the 5-LO pathway is summarized in order to understand its overall regulation and complexity as well as to comprehend the possible points of attack of compounds that eventually lead to inhibition of 5-LO product formation in intact cells. In the second part, natural compounds that interfere with 5-LO product formation are compiled and grouped into structural classes, and the underlying molecular mechanisms and structure-activity relationships are discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15545167>Reduced joint pain after short-term duodenal administration of seal oil in patients with : comparison with soy oil.</a></h2><p>Rheumatic joint pain is a common extra-intestinal complication of  (IBD). Because the high ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids (FAs) of the Western diet might promote rheumatic disorders, we sought to compare the effects of short-term duodenal administration of n-3-rich seal oil and n-6-rich soy oil on IBD-related joint pain.Nineteen patients with IBD-related joint pain were included in the study; 9 had Crohn  and 10 had ulcerative colitis. Ten millilitres seal oil (n = 10) or soy oil (n = 9) was self-administered through a nasoduodenal feeding tube 3 times daily for 10 days.Compared with soy oil treatment, seal oil significantly reduced the duration of morning stiffness (P = 0.024), number of tender joints (P = 0.035), intensity of pain (P = 0.025) and the doctor's scoring of rheumatic  activity (P = 0.025) at the end of the 10-day treatment period. Analysis of the effects as area under the curve (area between the curve and baseline, zero) for the entire period from start of treatment until 6 months' post-treatment suggested a long-lasting beneficial effect of seal oil administration on joint pain, whereas soy oil tended (not significantly) to aggravate the condition. Consistently, the serum ratios of n-6 to n-3 FAs (P < 0.01) and  to eicosapentaenoic  (P < 0.01) were reduced after treatment with seal oil.The results suggest distinctive, differential prolonged effects on IBD-related joint pain of short-term duodenal administration of n-3-rich seal oil (significant improvement) and n-6-rich soy oil (tendency to exacerbation).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27459113>Preventive and curative effect of Pistacia lentiscus oil in experimental .</a></h2><p>to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of the Pistacia lentiscus oil in experimental  model. was induced in male rats by instillation of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS) in all groups. The experimental groups consisted of: 5 rats received Lentisc oil 2months before  induction (preventive group), 5 rats received the oil on the day of  induction (curative group) and 5 control rats. Lentisc oil was extracted from the ripe fruit of the plant by the cold press method and was analyzed by spectro-chromatography. Lentisc oil has been inserted with a standard diet at the dose of 30mg oil/100g of food/rat.The lentisc oil sample is composed mainly by Oleic  (47.96%), Palmitic  (27.94%) and Linoleic  (20.22%).There was a significant difference between control rats and treated rats with lentisc oil concerned body mass (p=0.009), bleeding index (p=0.005 and p=0.018) and diarrhea (p=0.012). Histological examination revealed a clear difference between the control and preventive groups with disappearance of erosion, decreased of cryptitis, irregular crypts and crypt loss in the preventive group. Curative group showed a significant decrease of ulceration, hyperplasia, cryptitis, irregular crypts and crypt loss compared to the control group. There was an attenuation of inflammation in the preventive group compared to the curative group without statistically significant.Lentisc oil administration could provide a protective effect on intestinal inflammation in  rats induced by TNBS mainly when it is administered at a young age in preventive mode. This beneficial effect would involve a modification of  metabolism.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Moreover, colonic  (ARA) proportions are increased and oleic  (OA) proportions are decreased. Fish oils are protective in IBD patients however, a side-by-side comparison between effects of fish oils, ARA and OA has not been made. We therefore, compared effects of eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) versus ARA and OA on ICAM-1 expression in Caco-2 enterocytes. To validate our model we showed that dexamethasone, sulfasalazine and PPARalpha (GW7647) or PPARgamma (troglitazone) agonists significantly lowered ICAM-1 expression. ICAM-1 expression of non-stimulated and cytokine stimulated Caco-2 cells cultured for 22 days with ARA was significant higher as compared to EPA and OA. Furthermore, ARA increased NF-kappaB activation in a reporter cell-line as compared to EPA. Antibody array analysis of multiple  proteins particularly showed an increased monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 and angiogenin production and a decreased interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 production by ARA as compared to EPA. Our results showed that ARA but not EPA and OA activates NF-kappaB and elevates ICAM-1 expression in Caco-2 enterocytes. It suggests that replacement of ARA by EPA or OA in the colon mucosa might have beneficial effects for IBD patients. Finally, we suggest that the pro- effects of ARA versus EPA and OA are not related to PPARgamma activation and/or eicosanoid formation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14656710>Linoleic  induces interleukin-8 production by Crohn's human intestinal smooth muscle cells via  metabolites.</a></h2><p>Previously we reported that linoleic  (LA), but not oleic , caused a marked increase in the secretion of IL-8 by Crohn's human intestinal smooth muscle (HISM) cells. Antioxidants inhibited this response, implicating a role for oxidative stress and NF-kappaB, a transcription factor for IL-8 that is activated by oxidative stress. In this study, we examined two mechanisms whereby LA, the dietary precursor for  (AA), could increase the production of IL-8 via activation of AA pathways: 1) by generation of reactive oxygen species by the AA-pathway enzymes to activate NF-kappaB or 2) by AA metabolites. Normal and Crohn's HISM cells were exposed to LA, oxidizing solution (Ox), or oxidizing solution enriched with LA (OxLA). Exposure of cells to Ox or OxLA induced oxidative stress as determined by thiobarbituric  reactive substances. In normal cells, Ox but not LA activated NF-kappaB as determined by transfection experiments and Western blot. In Crohn's cells, NF-kappaB was spontaneously activated and was not further activated by Ox or LA. In contrast, TNF-alpha markedly increased activation of NF-kappaB in both normal and Crohn's cells. These results indicated that LA did not increase IL-8 by activating NF-kappaB, so we evaluated the second mechanism of an effect of AA metabolites. In normal cells, OxLA, but not LA, markedly stimulated IL-8, whereas in Crohn's cells, both OxLA and LA stimulated IL-8. OxLA, also stimulated production of AA metabolites leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)), PGE(2), and thromboxane B(2) (TXB(2)) by normal and Crohn's cells. To determine whether AA metabolites mediated the IL-8 response, cells were treated with OxLA plus indomethacin (Indo), a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, and nordihydroguaiaretic  (NDGA), a lipoxygenase inhibitor. Both Indo and NDGA blocked the IL-8 response to OxLA. To determine more specifically a role for AA metabolites, AA was used. Similar to OxLA, OxAA stimulated production of IL-8 and AA metabolites. Pinane thromboxane, a selective thromboxane synthase inhibitor and receptor blocker, inhibited OxAA stimulation of TXB(2) and IL-8 in a dose-response manner. MK886, a selective 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, inhibited OxAA stimulation of LTB(4) and IL-8 also in a dose-response manner. Analysis of specific gene products by RT-PCR demonstrated that HISM cells expressed receptors for both thromboxane and LTB(4). We conclude that AA metabolites mediated the IL-8 response to LA in HISM cells. Both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways were involved. LA did not increase IL-8 by activating NF-kappaB, but NF-kappaB appeared to be involved, because LA increased IL-8 only in situations where NF-kappaB was activated, either spontaneously in Crohn's cells or by Ox in normal cells. We speculate that AA metabolites increased IL-8 production by enhancing NF-kappaB-dependent transcription of IL-8.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16771071>Importance of lipids in the nutritional treatment of  .</a></h2><p>Over the last decades, scientific advances in the knowledge of anti- properties of lipids have lead to the development of new formulas for enteral and parenteral nutrition. These products have been utilised as a treatment for a variety of  . In this review we expose the effects of lipids used in enteral nutriton on different  pathologies such as , atherosclerosis, lung fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and others. During  , eicosanoids are produced from polyunsaturated fatty acids present in cellular membranes.  activity of these molecules depends on the nature of their precursors: when  (n-6) is present, pro- molecules are released, whereas eicosapentaenoic  (n-3)-derived eicosanoids are weakly . In this way, fish oils, rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, increase the content of eicosapentaenoic-eicosanoids and decrease  in immune and endothelial cells leading to a lower  activity. Likewise, oleic  exhibits anti- effects by preventing the release of particular chemotactic molecules. In summary, enteral diets supplemented with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and oleic  benefits the treatment of patients with  pathologies, leading to better outcomes, and decreasing the doses of anti- drugs, which exhibit important secondary effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21380759>Perinodal adipose tissue and mesenteric lymph node activation during reactivated TNBS-colitis in rats.</a></h2><p>Colitis induced by trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS) with reactivation is a good experimental model for studying  pathogenesis and appropriate therapeutics. This experimental model allows the induction of colitis relapse and remission periods and the establishment of chronic  features, such as the mesenteric adipose tissue alterations observed in Crohn's . Lymph node activation and the role of perinodal adipose tissue (PAT) have been poorly studied in this model. Thus, a study of the interactions of lymph nodes and PAT could help to elucidate the mechanisms behind IBD pathogenesis.The purpose of this study was to examine lymph nodes and PAT alterations during reactivated TNBS-colitis in Wistar rats.In this study, the alterations of PAT and lymph node cells during experimental colitis, induced by repeated intracolonic TNBS instillations, were evaluated, focusing on fatty  and adipocytokine profile analysis and cytokines production, respectively.Fatty  analysis of PAT reveals an increase of ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids during colits, such as linoleic , gamma-linolenic  and . ω-6  was not increased in lymph node cells or serum. PAT also produces elevated levels of pro- and anti- adipokines during colitis. Lymph node cells release high levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α but not IL-10, characterizing the predominant Th-1 response associated with this . Nevertheless, T cells from animals with colitis demonstrated increased IFN-γ production via a COX-2-dependent mechanism after supplementation with ω-6 , suggesting that PAT modification could contribute to the lymph node cell activation observed during colitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25149823>Marine omega-3 fatty acids and inflammatory processes: Effects, mechanisms and clinical relevance.</a></h2><p>Inflammation is a condition which contributes to a range of human diseases. It involves a multitude of cell types, chemical mediators, and interactions. Eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) are omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids found in oily fish and fish oil supplements. These fatty acids are able to partly inhibit a number of aspects of inflammation including leukocyte chemotaxis, adhesion molecule expression and leukocyte-endothelial adhesive interactions, production of eicosanoids like prostaglandins and leukotrienes from the n-6 fatty  , production of inflammatory cytokines, and T-helper 1 lymphocyte reactivity. In addition, EPA gives rise to eicosanoids that often have lower biological potency than those produced from  and EPA and DHA give rise to anti-inflammatory and inflammation resolving mediators called resolvins, protectins and maresins. Mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory actions of marine n-3 fatty acids include altered cell membrane phospholipid fatty  composition, disruption of lipid rafts, inhibition of activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B so reducing expression of inflammatory genes, activation of the anti-inflammatory transcription factor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ and binding to the G protein coupled receptor GPR120. These mechanisms are interlinked, although the full extent of this is not yet elucidated. Animal experiments demonstrate benefit from marine n-3 fatty acids in models of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and asthma. Clinical trials of fish oil in RA demonstrate benefit, but clinical trials of fish oil in IBD and asthma are inconsistent with no overall clear evidence of efficacy.

The biopsy specimens of CM from 10 patients with the irritable  syndrome were used for comparison. A proportional severity of the  and increased synthesis of CO and LO metabolites in CM was ascertained in a phase of UC. In the early phase of clinical remission (on the average, following 4 weeks of therapy), there was a comparative reduction in the level of eicosanoids with the preserved high production of TB2 and LO derivatives (LTB4 and HETEA). At the same time, in patients with severe UC, a higher synthesis of LTB4 and HETEA and PG was preserved. The predominance of CM production of eicosanoids having aggregative, vasoconstrictor, and proinflammatory effects (less coefficients of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha/TB2 and PG/LTB4 + ETEA), which had been detected in a phase of UC exacerbation, was preserved in a phase of remission development, by forming the metabolic basis for recurrence of the process.</p></html>
