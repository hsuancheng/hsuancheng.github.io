High-molecular-weight (HMW)-HA inhibits the activation of  cells and their access into tumour tissues, whereas, low-molecular-weight oligo-HA is known to potentially activate dendritic cells (DCs). In this paper, we investigated whether small extracellular vesicle (EVs)-PH20 hyaluronidase induces tumour HA degradation, which, in turn, activates DCs to promote anti-cancer  responses. Informed by our previous work, we used a small EV carrying GPI-anchored PH20 hyaluronidase (Exo-PH20) that could deeply penetrate into tumour foci via HA degradation. We found that Exo-PH20-treatment successfully activates the maturation and migration of DCs , particularly CD103 DCs leading to the activation of tumour-specific CD8 T cells, which work together to inhibit tumour growth. Moreover, combination with anti-PD-L1 antibody provided potent tumour-specific CD8 T   responses as well as elicited prominent tumour growth inhibition both in syngenic and spontaneous breast cancer models, and this anti-tumour immunity was durable. Together, these results present new insights for HA degradation by Exo-PH20, providing a better understanding of oligo HA-triggered  responses to cancer.© 2019 The Author(s).

Therefore, new therapeutic interventions are needed to increase the immunogenicity of tumors and overcome the resistance to these immunotherapies. Oncolytic properties of common viruses can be exploited for the priming of antitumor immunity, and such oncolytic viruses are currently in active clinical development in combination with  -targeted therapies. However, the routine implementation of these therapies is limited by their manufacturing constraints, the risk of exposure of clinical staff, and the ongoing regulations on genetically modified organisms. We sought to determine whether anti-infectious disease vaccines could be used as a commercially available source of immunostimulatory agents for cancer immunotherapy. We found that rotavirus vaccines have both immunostimulatory and oncolytic properties. In vitro, they can directly kill cancer cells with features of immunogenic  death. In vivo, intratumoral rotavirus therapy has antitumor effects that are dependent on the  system. In several immunocompetent murine tumor models, intratumoral rotavirus overcomes resistance to and synergizes with  -targeted therapy. Heat- and UV-inactivated rotavirus lost their oncolytic activity but kept their synergy with  -targeted antibodies through the up-regulation of the double-stranded RNA receptor retinoic acid-induced gene 1 (RIG-I). Rotavirus vaccines are clinical-grade products used in pediatric and adult populations. Therefore, in situ immunization strategies with intratumoral-attenuated rotavirus could be implemented quickly in the clinic.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Pharmacodynamic effects relative to copanlisib dose and plasma exposure were evaluated. Patients with lymphoma or solid tumors received copanlisib 0.4 mg/kg or 0.8 mg/kg on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day . Primary variables were maximum changes in phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) levels in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and plasma glucose. Other evaluations included PI3K signaling markers and T-lymphocytes in paired tumor biopsies, the relationship between estimated plasma exposure and pharmacodynamic markers, response, and safety. Sixty-three patients received copanlisib. PRP pAKT levels showed sustained reductions from baseline following copanlisib (median inhibition: 0.4 mg/kg, 73.8% [range -94.9 to 144.0]; 0.8 mg/kg, 79.6% [range -96.0 to 408.0]). Tumor pAKT was reduced vs. baseline with copanlisib 0.8 mg/kg in paired biopsy samples (P < 0.05). Dose-related transient plasma glucose elevations were observed. Estimated copanlisib plasma exposure significantly correlated with changes in plasma pAKT and glucose metabolism markers. There were 2 complete responses and 6 partial responses; 7 of 8 responders received copanlisib 0.8 mg/kg. Adverse events (all grade) included hyperglycemia (52.4%), fatigue (46.0%), and hypertension (41.3%). Copanlisib demonstrated dose-dependent pharmacodynamic evidence of target engagement and PI3K pathway modulation/inhibition in tumor and  cells. Results support the use of copanlisib 0.8 mg/kg (or flat-dose equivalent of 60 mg) in solid tumors and lymphoma, and provide a biomarker hypothesis for studies of copanlisib combined with   inhibitors ().Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633473>Genomic profiles and current therapeutic agents in neuroendocrine neoplasms.</a></h2><p>Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are rare tumors that mainly occur in the gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) tract and lungs. According to the current World Health Organization classification for GEP-NENs and lung NENs, treatment strategies differ for well-differentiated and poorly differentiated subtypes. For well-differentiated GEP-NENs, somatostatin analogues (SSA), peptide receptor radionuclide therapy, and molecular-targeted agents are approved as the standards of care based on phase III clinical trial data. Promising data regarding the use of everolimus and the novel SSA pasireotide for lung NENs are emerging, though additional studies are required to confirm these effects. For poorly differentiated tumors from the GEP tract and lung, a platinum-based cytotoxic regimen is widely used. Genomic analysis has recently revealed a diverse pattern of primary organ-dependent mutations, and the use of traditional treatment strategies versus organ-specific strategies is currently under discussion. In addition, clinical trials for several molecular-targeted agents and   inhibitors for the treatment of NENs are currently underway. Accumulating genomic information is expected to contribute to the development of novel therapies for other organ-derived NENs or poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs).

Several viruses, either naturally occurring or developed through genetic engineering, are currently under investigation in clinical studies. Emerging reports suggesting the -stimulatory property of OVs against tumor cells further support the clinical use of OVs for the treatment of lesions lacking effective therapies. Poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC) and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), have a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Therefore, several groups investigated the therapeutic potential of OVs in PDTC/ATC models producing experimental data sustaining the potential clinical efficacy of OVs in these cancer models. Moreover, the presence of an immunosuppressive microenvironment further supports the potential use of OVs in ATC. In this review, we present the results of the studies evaluating the efficacy of OVs alone or in combination with other treatment options. In particular, their potential therapeutic combination with multiple kinases inhibitors (MKIs) or   inhibitors are discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649889>Vitiligo Adverse Event Observed in a Patient With Durable Complete Response After Nivolumab for Metastatic Renal  Carcinoma.</a></h2><p> Renal  carcinoma is the third most prevalent urological cancer worldwide and about 30% of patients present with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Systemic treatments for metastatic renal  carcinoma have improved recently. Vascular endothelial growth factor targeting therapies were the previous standard of care. However,   inhibitors used in second line therapy have now been shown to improve patient survival. We report a case of metastatic renal  carcinoma with nivolumab as a second-line therapy after progression with tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Unusual adverse events in metastatic renal  carcinoma, such as vitiligo, were observed in this patient who developed a remarkable documented pathological complete response to his renal tumor.  A 60-year-old caucasian male was diagnosed with a pulmonary metastatic clear  renal  carcinoma. Sunitinib was used as first line treatment without success. He received nivolumab in second-line treatment. He developed several -related adverse events, most notably vitiligo. The patient had a radiological complete response on metastatic sites, with a significant decrease of renal tumor volume and underwent cytoreductive nephrectomy after 2 years of treatment, confirming the pathological complete response. The patient remains disease-free for 10 months without further systemic therapy after nivolumab discontinuation.  Pathological complete response with nivolumab in metastatic renal  carcinoma is rare. This case further highlights the potentially predictive role of -related adverse events during nivolumab therapy for metastatic renal  carcinoma and raises questions concerning the role of nephrectomy after   inhibitor therapy. Further studies are needed to better identify predictive factors for treatment response to immunotherapy in metastatic renal  carcinoma, and to better understand the role of nephrectomy after nivolumab treatment.Copyright © 2019 Billon, Walz, Brunelle, Thomassin, Salem, Guerin, Vicier, Dermeche, Albiges, Tantot, Nenan, Pignot and Gravis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654628>Cervical cancer patients that respond to chemoradiation therapy display an intense tumor infiltrating  profile before treatment.</a></h2><p>Cervical cancer (CC) is a major cause of death and suffering to women globally with 570,000 new cases in 2017. It disproportionately affects those living in resource-constrained countries such as Brazil, with 90% of the deaths from CC happening in low and middle-income countries. Early detection is still the best strategy for improving response to therapy and survival and cases detected in advanced stages show variable response rates to the standard chemoradiation therapy protocols. Both the genetic landscape and the  status of patients can dramatically affect cancer progression and response to therapy, as well as disease recurrence. Here we performed a comprehensive sequencing analysis using the cancer gene panel - Ion AmpliSeq™ Cancer hotspot Panel V2 CHPv2, as well as determined the  infiltrate composition of a group of locally advanced CC patients with the goal of identifying genetic and  characteristics associated with a clinical response to therapy. The expression levels of CD68 tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and CD8 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), as well as the   molecules PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2 in stroma and in tumor regions were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The HPV infection status with high-risk strains was also determined. Twenty-one samples from patients with squamous  carcinoma segregated into responder (11) and non-responder (10) groups according to standard chemoradiation therapy response were studied. Our findings indicate that responder patients showed an increase in an inflammatory tumor environment as indicated by higher numbers of CD8 and PD-L2 TILs, as well as higher expression of PD-L1 immunoreactive area, as compared to the non-responder group. Additionally, our results demonstrate a correlation between the number of gene mutations and PD-L2 TILs in the responder group. The genes PIK3CA and KDR/VEGFR were the most mutated genes, corroborating past findings. Together, these findings indicate an inflammatory tumor microenvironment present in patients that will respond to future chemoradiation treatment as compared to those that will not. This points to possible future predictors of response to therapy in CC patients.Copyright © 2019.

We demonstrated the concept for a sensitive method to determine Ag-reactive T  clones based on clonal expansion using model neoantigens (NeoAgs) rather than cytokine production. Sequential increase in T  clonal frequencies following Ag stimulation was detected by next generation sequencing (NGS) of T  receptor β (TCR β) complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3), with a higher sensitivity than that of enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) by 100-fold.

After primary infection of the cornea, the virus enters latency within the trigeminal ganglion (TG), from which it can reactivate throughout the life of the host. Viral latency is maintained, in part, by virus-specific CD8 T cells that nonlethally interact with infected neurons. When CD8 T  responses are inhibited, HSV-1 can reactivate and these recurrent reactivation events can lead to blinding scarring of the cornea. In the C57BL/6 mouse, CD8 T cells specific to the immunodominant epitope from glycoprotein B maintain functionality throughout latency while CD8 T cells specific to subdominant epitopes undergo functional impairment that is associated with the expression of the inhibitory  molecule programmed death 1 (PD-1). Here, we investigate the  molecule, T- immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (Tim-3), which has traditionally been associated with CD8 T  exhaustion. Unexpectedly, we found that Tim-3 was preferentially expressed on highly functional ganglionic CD8 T cells during acute and latent HSV-1 infection. This, paired with data that show that Tim-3 expression on CD8 T cells in the latently infected TG is influenced by viral gene expression, suggests that Tim-3 is an indicator of recent T  stimulation, rather than functional compromise, in this model. We conclude that Tim-3 expression is not sufficient to define functional compromise during latency; however, it may be useful in identifying activated cells within the TG during HSV-1 infection. Without an effective means of eliminating HSV-1 from latently infected neurons, efforts to control the virus have centered on preventing viral reactivation from latency. Virus-specific CD8 T cells within the infected TG have been shown to play a crucial role in inhibiting viral reactivation and with a portion of these cells exhibiting functional impairment,  molecule immunotherapies have presented a potential solution to enhancing the anti-viral response of these cells. In pursuing this potential treatment strategy, we found that Tim-3 (often associated with CD8 T  functional exhaustion) is not upregulated on impaired cells but is instead upregulated on highly functional cells that have recently received antigenic stimulation. These findings support a role for Tim-3 as a marker of activation rather than exhaustion in this model, and we provide additional evidence for the hypothesis that there is persistent viral gene expression in the HSV-1 latently infected TG.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622621>Therapeutic Targeting of the Colorectal Tumor Stroma.</a></h2><p>Colorectal tumors have been classified based on histologic factors, genetic factors, and consensus molecular subtypes, which all affect the tumor microenvironment (TME).

Typically, monoclonal antibodies are used to target the radionuclides to cancer  surface antigens. However, antibodies face limitations due to their poor tumor penetration and suboptimal pharmacokinetics, while the expression of their target on the cancer  surface may be gradually lost. In addition, most antigens are expressed in a limited number of tumor types. To circumvent these problems, we developed a Nanobody (Nb)-based RIT against a prominent stromal  (stromal-targeting radioimmunotherapy or STRIT) present in nearly all tumors, the tumor-associated macrophage (TAM). Macrophage Mannose Receptor (MMR) functions as a stable molecular target on TAM residing in hypoxic areas, further allowing the delivery of a high radiation dose to the more radioresistant hypoxic tumor regions. Since MMR expression is not restricted to TAM, we first optimized a strategy to block extra-tumoral MMR to prevent therapy-induced toxicity. A 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled bivalent Nb largely blocks extra-tumoral binding of Lu-labeled anti-MMR Nb and prevents toxicity, while still allowing the intra-tumoral binding of the monovalent Nb. Interestingly, three doses of Lu-labeled anti-MMR Nb resulted in a significantly retarded tumor growth, thereby outcompeting the effects of anti-PD1, anti-VEGFR2, doxorubicin and paclitaxel in the TS/A mammary carcinoma model. Together, these data propose anti-MMR STRIT as a valid new approach for cancer treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Nevertheless, there are heterogeneous response rates to ICI among different cancer types, and even in the context of patients affected by a specific cancer. Thus, it becomes crucial to identify factors that predict the response to immunotherapeutic approaches. A comprehensive investigation of the mutational and immunological aspects of the tumor can be useful to obtain a robust prediction. By performing a pan-cancer analysis on gene expression data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, 8055 cases and 29 cancer types), we set up and validated a machine learning approach to predict the potential for positive response to ICI. Support vector machines (SVM) and extreme gradient boosting (XGboost) models were developed with a 10×5-fold cross-validation schema on 80% of TCGA cases to predict ICI responsiveness defined by a score combining tumor mutational burden and TGF- β signaling. On the remaining 20% validation subset, our SVM model scored 0.88 accuracy and 0.27 Matthews Correlation Coefficient.

Until 2006, non-specific immunotherapy with high dose interleukin-2 (HD IL-2) was considered as standard therapy of mccRCC. The transition from cytokine to targeted therapy, and now to novel immunotherapeutic agents, significantly increased the overall survival (OS) of patients with mccRCC. Currently, 7 targeted agents and the combination of nivolumab/ipilimumab (  inhibitors, ICIs) have been approved as first-line therapy for mccRCC. Based on evidence from randomized phase III clinical trials, sunitinib and pazopanib (Tyrosine kinase inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGF-TKIs) are the most effective first-line options, especially in favorable and indermediate risk patients. Nivolumab/ipilimumab (dual  inhibitors) seem to be the preferred first-line therapy in poor-risk patients, although cabozantinib, temsirolimus, sunitinib and pazopanib are also recommended. HD IL-2 remains a reasonable first-line treatment option in selected, favorable-risk younger patients with good performance status. Based on data of previous phase I and II studies, several phase III trials investigating the efficacy and safety of the combination of ICI/VEGF-TKI versus sunitinib in untreated mccRCC are currently underway.

Inspired by the capability of fever-like heat in inducing an -favorable tumor microenvironment, mild photothermal therapy (PTT) is proposed to sensitize tumors to   inhibition and turn "cold" tumors "hot." Here we present a combined all-in-one and all-in-control strategy to realize a local symbiotic mild photothermal-assisted immunotherapy (SMPAI). We load both a near-infrared (NIR) photothermal agent IR820 and a programmed death-ligand 1 antibody (aPD-L1) into a lipid gel depot with a favorable property of thermally reversible gel-to-sol phase transition. Manually controlled NIR irradiation regulates the release of aPD-L1 and, more importantly, increases the recruitment of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and boosts T- activity against tumors. In vivo antitumor studies on 4T1 and B16F10 models demonstrate that SMPAI is an effective and promising strategy for treating "cold" tumors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634647>Haematological -related adverse events with   inhibitors, how to manage?</a></h2><p>  inhibitors (ICIs) are changing the treatments of many patients with cancer. These immunotherapies are generally better tolerated than chemotherapy, and their adverse events are -related mimicking autoimmune or inflammatory conditions. Although these -related adverse events mainly affect the skin, endocrine glands, digestive tract, joints, liver or lungs, all the organs can be theoretically affected, and the haematopoietic system is not spared. This review of the literature will focus on the haematological -related adverse events (Haem-irAEs). By reviewing the largest clinical trials of ICIs, we estimate the frequency of Haem-irAEs at 3.6% for all grades and 0.7% for grades III-IV. Frequency of Haem-irAEs of all grades was found to be higher with anti-programmed  death 1 (4.1%) or anti-programmed  death ligand 1 (4.7%) than with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (0.5%) (p < 0.0001). From the 63 cases with Haem-irAEs reported in the literature, the mean time to the onset was found to be 10 weeks after ICI initiation, and the large range for occurrence (1-84 weeks) and the regular incidence suggest that Haem-irAEs could occur at any time after ICI therapy. Among the 63 reported cases with Haem-irAEs, the distribution was  thrombocytopenia (n = 18, 29%), pancytopenia or  aplastic anaemia (n = 12, 19%), neutropenia (n = 11, 17%), haemolytic anaemia (n = 10, 16%), cytokine release syndrome with haemophagocytic syndrome (n = 7, 11%) and other Haem-irAEs including bicytopenia or pure red  aplasia (n = 5, 8%). Haem-irAEs are generally highly severe adverse reactions with a mortality rate of Haem-irAEs reported to be 14% (9 deaths among the 63 cases reported). The more severe and life-threatening Haem-irAEs were both cytokine release syndrome with haemophagocytic syndrome and pancytopenia or aplastic anaemia. Haem-irAEs induced by ICIs are potentially life-threatening.

However, a major challenge in the process of ICB treatment is when tumors do not have enough infiltrating T cells. Antiangiogenic drugs targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors have been approved for the treatment of various malignant solid tumors alone or in combination with other therapies. Our review mainly discusses the preclinical rationale and clinical efficacy of antiangiogenic and ICB combination therapy in urogenital tumors.We reviewed relevant literature on preclinical research and clinical trial results regarding antiangiogenic and ICB combination therapy in urogenital tumors from PubMed. In addition, we searched ongoing clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov to collect information related to this specific topic.Antiangiogenesis therapy could enhance T  recruitment and increase T  infiltration into the tumor microenvironment by blocking VEGF-VEGF receptor 2 binding and downstream signaling pathways to normalize tumor blood vessels. The combination of ICB and antiangiogenesis therapy could improve antitumor activity according to subsequent preclinical experiments and several phase I/II/III clinical trials on urogenital tumors.Combined therapy has shown some antitumor efficacy in several urogenital tumors, such as metastatic renal  carcinoma, metastatic urothelial and genitourinary tumors, endometrial carcinoma, ovarian cancer, and fallopian tube cancer.

Therefore, development of an HIV cure has become one of the main priorities of the HIV research field. The main obstacle for an HIV cure is the formation of latent viral reservoirs, where the virus is able to "hide" despite decades of therapy, just to reignite active replication once therapy is stopped. Revealing HIV hiding places is thus central to HIV cure research, but the absence of markers of these reservoir cells greatly complicates the search for a cure. Identification of one or several marker(s) of latently infected cells would represent a significant step forward toward a better description of the  types involved and improved understanding of HIV latency. Moreover, it could provide a "handle" for selective therapeutic targeting of the reservoirs. A number of cellular markers of HIV reservoir have recently been proposed, including   molecules, CD2, and CD30. CD32a is perhaps the most promising of HIV reservoir markers as it is reported to be associated with a very prominent enrichment in HIV DNA, although this finding has been challenged. In this review, we provide an update on the current knowledge about HIV reservoir markers.

In addition, higher numbers of both CTLA-4 CD244+ and CTLA-4 CD57 CD3 T cells were detected. Interestingly, the increased CTLA-4 CD244 T cells were predominantly CD4 T cells.

The relevant RCTs in cancer patients receiving ICIs were searched and the systematic evaluation was performed. PubMed, MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for studies published till January 2019.  A total of 27 RCTs included 17,546 patients were available for this meta-analysis. ICIs significantly improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in both of the younger (<65 years) and the older cancer patients (≥65 years). No significantly prolonged OS and PFS was observed among patients older than 75 years.

Growing evidence points to a link between DNA methylation and anti-tumor immunity, while clinical data on the association of genomic alterations in DNA methylation-related genes and ICI response are lacking.Clinical cohorts with annotated response and survival data and matched mutational data from published studies were collected and consolidated. The predictive function of specific mutated genes was first tested in the discovery cohort and later validated in the validation cohort. The association between specific mutated genes and tumor immunogenicity and anti-tumor immunity was further investigated in the Cancer Genome Altas (TCGA) dataset.Among twenty-one key genes involving in the regulation of DNA methylation, TET1-mutant (TET1-MUT) was enriched in patients responding to ICI treatment in the discovery cohort (P < 0.001). TET1 was recurrently mutated across multiple cancers and more frequently seen in skin, lung, gastrointestinal, and urogenital cancers. In the discovery cohort (n = 519), significant differences were observed between TET1-MUT and TET1-wildtype (TET1-WT) patients regarding objective response rate (ORR, 60.9% versus 22.8%, P < 0.001), durable clinical benefit (DCB, 71.4% versus 31.6%, P < 0.001), and progression-free survival (PFS, hazard ratio = 0.46 [95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 0.82], P = 0.008). In the validation cohort (n = 1395), significant overall survival (OS) benefit was detected in the TET1-MUT patients compared to TET1-WT patients (hazard ratio = 0.47 [95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 0.88], P = 0.019), which was, importantly, independent of tumor mutational burden and high microsatellite instability; as well as not attributed to the prognostic impact of TET1-MUT (P > 0.05 in both two non-ICI-treated cohorts). In TCGA dataset, TET1-MUT was strongly associated with higher tumor mutational burden and neoantigen load, and inflamed pattern of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes,  signatures and -related gene expressions.TET1-MUT was strongly associated with higher ORR, better DCB, longer PFS, and improved OS in patients receiving ICI treatment, suggesting that TET1-MUT is a novel predictive biomarker for   blockade across multiple cancer types.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640266>Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies Targeting   for the Treatment of Solid Tumors.</a></h2><p>Recently, modulation of   has risen to prominence as a means to treat a number of solid malignancies, given the durable response seen in many patients and improved side effect profile compared to conventional chemotherapeutic agents.

There are no validated imaging biomarkers associated with outcomes in patients with melanoma brain metastases receiving ICIs. We hypothesized that radiomic analysis of magnetic resonance images (MRIs) could identify higher-order features associated with survival.Between 2010 and 2019, we retrospectively reviewed patients with melanoma brain metastases who received ICI. After volumes of interest were drawn, several texture and edge descriptors, including first-order, Haralick, Gabor, Sobel, and Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) features were extracted. Progression was determined using Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases. Univariate Cox regression was performed for each radiomic feature with adjustment for multiple comparisons followed by Lasso regression and multivariate analysis.Eighty-eight patients with 196 total brain metastases were identified. Median age was 63.5 years (range, 19-91 y). Ninety percent of patients had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 and 35% had elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Sixty-three patients (72%) received ipilimumab, 11 patients (13%) received programmed  death protein 1 blockade, and 14 patients (16%) received nivolumab plus ipilimumab. Multiple features were associated with increased overall survival (OS), and LoG edge features best explained the variation in outcome (hazard ratio: 0.68, P = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, a similar trend with LoG was seen, but no longer significant with OS. Findings were confirmed in an independent cohort.Higher-order MRI radiomic features in patients with melanoma brain metastases receiving ICI were associated with a trend toward improved OS.© The Author(s) 2019.

Computed tomography evaluations were analyzed using response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST, version 1.1). Kaplan-Meier analyses were conducted to calculate progression-free (PFS) and overall (OS) survival; the impact of influencing variables was evaluated using uni- and multivariate Cox-regression analyses.Among 153 patients (59% men, mean age 66 years), median PFS was 4 months [mo; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 3-5], OS was 13 mo (10-17), and objective response rate (ORR) was 22%. Therapy line ≥ 3 was associated with significantly inferior PFS (p = 0.003) and OS (p = 0.001). In first-line therapy PFS, OS, and ORR were 7 mo (3-11), 17 mo [9-not evaluable (n.e.)], and 36%; in second-line 4 mo (3-7), 18 mo (13-n.e.) and 19%, and in ≥ third-line 2 mo (1-3), 9 mo (4-12), and 13%. PFS was significantly influenced by PD-L1 expression in first-line therapy (p = 0.006). In ≥ third-line patients, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status significantly affected PFS and OS (both p < 0.001).Third- or later-line single-agent anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy is less efficacious as compared to first- and second-line treatment. In that setting, ECOG performance status predominates known predictors like PD-L1 expression or presence of an alteration in EGFR or ALK.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646161>Nonbullous pemphigoid secondary to PD-1 inhibition.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613799>Targeting tumor-intrinsic hexosamine biosynthesis sensitizes pancreatic cancer to anti-PD1 therapy.</a></h2><p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is considered to be a highly immunosuppressive and heterogenous neoplasm. Despite improved knowledge regarding the genetic background of the tumor and better understanding of the tumor microenvironment,   inhibitor therapy (targeting CTLA4, PD1, PDL1) has not been very successful against PDAC. The robust desmoplastic stroma, along with an extensive extracellular matrix (ECM) that is rich in hyaluronan, plays an integral role in this  evasion. Hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP), a shunt pathway of glycolysis, is a metabolic node in cancer cells that can promote survival pathways on one hand and influence the hyaluronan synthesis in the ECM on the other. The rate-limiting enzyme of the pathway, glutamine-fructose amidotransferase (GFAT1), uses glutamine and fructose 6-phosphate to eventually synthesize UDP-GlcNAc. In the current manuscript, we targeted this glutamine-utilizing enzyme by a small molecule glutamine analog (6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine or DON). Our results showed that DON decreased the self-renewal potential and metastatic ability of tumor . Further, treatment with DON decreased hyaluronan and collagen in the tumor microenvironment, leading to an extensive remodeling of the ECM, and an increased infiltration CD8+ T-cells. Additionally, treatment with DON sensitized pancreatic tumors to anti-PD1 therapy resulting in tumor regression and prolonged survival.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635548>Safe use of nivolumab in a patient with renal  carcinoma and hepatitis B.</a></h2><p>Immunotherapy with  inhibitors gains a major role in bladder cancer. Because of the treatment's  modulatory effects, patients may develop hepatitis. Hepatitis B was an exclusion criterion in clinical trials that investigated nivolumab. Therefore, its effects and risk of hepatitis B reactivation in nivolumab are not clinically investigated in renal  carcinoma patients with hepatitis B.In this case report, we presented a metastatic renal  carcinoma patient who was treated with anti-viral treatment for hepatitis reactivation caused by previous sunitinib therapy. After progression, nivolumab was commenced and the patient was closely monitored with hepatic function tests.Nivolumab was well tolerated and no treatment-related adverse effect occurred. Hepatitis or viral hepatitis reactivation was not detected.This case supports the safety of nivolumab in patients with renal  carcinoma and viral hepatitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623302>Real-World Impact of   Inhibitors in Metastatic Uveal Melanoma.</a></h2><p>Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common intraocular malignancy in adults and shows a high rate of metastatic spread. As randomized clinical trials with   inhibitors (ICI) have not been performed in patients with metastatic UM, we analyzed the real-world outcomes in a nationwide population-based study. Clinical data of patients with UM were extracted from the Danish Metastatic Melanoma database, a nationwide database containing unselected records of patients diagnosed with metastatic melanoma in Denmark. Survival before (pre-ICI,  = 32) and after (post-ICI,  = 94) the approval of first-line treatment with ICI was analyzed. A partial response to first-line treatment was observed in 7% of patients treated with anti-programmed  death protein (PD)-1 monotherapy and in 21% with combined anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)-4 plus anti-PD-1 therapy. Median progression-free survival was 2.5 months for patients treated in the pre-ICI era compared to 3.5 months in the post-ICI era (hazard ratio (HR) 0.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28-0.67;  < 0.001). The estimated one-year overall survival rate increased from 25.0% to 41.9% and the median overall survival improved from 7.8 months to 10.0 months, respectively (HR 0.52; 95% CI 0.34-0.79;  = 0.003). Thus, the introduction of ICI as first-line treatment appears to have significantly improved the real-world survival of patients with metastatic UM, despite relatively low response rates compared to cutaneous melanoma. With the lack of therapies proven effective in randomized trials, these data support the current treatment with ICI in patients with metastatic UM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630381>Occurrences and Outcomes of   Inhibitors-Induced Vitiligo in Cancer Patients: A Retrospective Cohort Study.</a></h2><p>The use of   inhibitors (ICI) in melanoma and non-small  lung cancer patients is associated with the onset of vitiligo. However, previous studies have suggested conflicting results on the conditions of occurrence of ICI-induced vitiligo.The aim of this study was to describe the occurrences and outcomes of several cases of ICI-induced vitiligo.A retrospective study was carried out using the French Pharmacovigilance Database (FPD) between the beginning of the commercialization of ICI in France and 1 January 2019, selecting for analysis the vitiligo reactions of patients due to treatment with ICI.Among the 95 case patients identified in the FPD, the median times to onset of vitiligo after the start of pembrolizumab, nivolumab and ipilimumab therapies were 5.4, 5.0, and 3.8 months, respectively. Furthermore, 37 patients (45%) discontinued ICI treatment due to disease progression. The median follow-up time of all patients was 33 months (interquartile range 2-56).This study provided an overall picture of ICI-induced vitiligo in daily medical practice on a large number of pharmacovigilance observations of case patients. Among the observations of ICI-induced vitiligo, the diagnosed cancer was melanoma for almost all patients. Most patients in the study experienced other associated adverse drug reactions (ADRs), such as colitis, pruritus, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, thyroiditis, pancreatitis, and gastritis. Furthermore, our data suggest that the resolution of pembrolizumab- or nivolumab-induced vitiligo could be a marker of disease progression. Future studies evaluating vitiligo outcomes are warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642059>Single peptides and combination modalities for triple negative breast cancer.</a></h2><p>Unlike other types of breast cancers (BCs), no specific therapeutic targets have been established for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Therefore, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are the only available adjuvant therapeutic choices for TNBC. New emerging reports show that TNBC is associated with higher numbers of intratumoral tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. This is indicative of host anti-TNBC  surveillance and suggesting that immunotherapy can be considered as a therapeutic approach for TNBC management. Recent progress in molecular mechanisms of tumor- system interaction and cancer vaccine development studies, fast discoveries and FDA approvals of   inhibitors, chimeric antigen receptor T-cells, and oncolytic virotherapy have significantly attracted attention and research directions toward the immunotherapeutic approach to TNBC.

Immunotherapy-related hepatitis and cholangitis present a diagnostic and management challenge, being rare and incompletely characterised. We aim to report the incidence, features and treatments used for this in a real-world setting and to identify useful biomarkers, which can be used to predict effective use of steroids.Retrospective review of 453 patients started on immunotherapy over 7 years.Tertiary hepatology and oncology centre.21 patients identified with immunotherapy-related hepatotoxicity.Hepatitis was most common in those receiving dual therapy (incidence 20%), with 75% of Grade 4 hepatitis cases occurring with ipilimumab-containing regimens. Corticosteroid monotherapy is first line treatment, but doses above 60 mg OD prednisolone do not demonstrate any additional benefit in time to hepatitis resolution. The alanine transaminase (ALT) reduction in steroid-responsive hepatitis is typically rapid (with a halving of ALT within 11 days). The commencement of additional immunosuppression (typically mycophenolate) appears safe and prompts a more rapid fall in ALT than corticosteroid use alone. Infliximab was safely used twice as hepatitis treatment. We also describe one patient with rare immunotherapy-induced biliary disease.Vigilance is required for detection of immunotherapy-associated liver disease as, other than dual immunotherapy, we can identify no predictive factors for its development. Our data suggest that corticosteroid response is not dependent on the higher dosing regimens.

Neurological irAEs are rare compared to the more typical skin, gastrointestinal, and endocrine toxicities, and are often underrecognized and challenging to diagnose. Here, we report a case of seronegative autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy (AAG) induced by dual   inhibitor therapy (ICI) in a patient with metastatic melanoma.A patient with metastatic melanoma was treated with ipilimumab and nivolumab. He developed a constellation of new symptoms including nausea, fatigue, and severe orthostatic hypotension refractory to fluid resuscitation. An infectious, cardiac, neurologic, and endocrine workup were unrevealing. Cardiovascular autonomic testing revealed poor sympathetic nervous system responses. He was diagnosed with seronegative AAG and significantly improved with immunomodulatory therapies including IVIG and steroids as well as varying doses of midodrine and fludrocortisone. He was able to restart nivolumab without recurrence of his symptoms. However, the AAG reoccurred when he was re-challenged with ipilimumab and nivolumab due to disease progression. While the AAG was manageable with steroids at that time, unfortunately his melanoma became resistant to ICI.  inhibitors can have a wide range of unusual, rare irAEs, including neurotoxicity such as AAG. Clinicians should maintain suspicion for this toxicity so that treatment can be rapidly provided to avoid disability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616186>Prospect of immunotherapy combined with anti-angiogenic agents in patients with advanced non-small  lung cancer.</a></h2><p>In the latest years, some drugs have been approved by European Medicines Agency (EMA) and/or the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with advanced non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly for the treatment of those who have no targeted gene mutations or who have progressed on previously targeted therapy or platinum-containing dual-agent chemotherapy. In general, these drugs fall into two categories: anti-angiogenic agents and   inhibitors (ICIs). Anti-angiogenic agents currently approved by the FDA and/or EMA for advanced NSCLC treatment include bevacizumab, nintedanib, and ramucirumab. Anlotinib has been approved in advanced NSCLC by Chinese Food and Drug Administration (CFDA). These anti-angiogenic agents can induce anti-angiogenesis by targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF2 or inhibiting multiple small molecules involved in angiogenic and proliferative pathways such as platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) and fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs). Although these drugs show significant therapeutic efficacy, most patients inevitably experience disease progression resulting in death. ICIs approved by the FDA and/or EMA for advanced NSCLC treatment include nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab. These ICIs can significantly improve efficacy compared with standard chemotherapy by targeting programmed  death protein 1 (PD-1) receptor or PD-2 receptor with longer response duration and acceptable toxicity. However, the response rate of ICIs is suboptimal, and only a few patients ultimately benefit from immunotherapy. So current efforts have focused on exploring new potential combinatorial strategies with synergistic antitumor activity. Here, we summarized the theoretical basis, current clinical data, and potential future perspective of immunotherapy combined with anti-angiogenic agents for advanced NSCLC.© 2019 Liang and Wang.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646612>Immunotoxicity from  inhibitor therapy: clinical features and underlying mechanisms.</a></h2><p>  inhibition with monoclonal antibodies is becoming increasingly commonplace in cancer medicine, having contributed to a widening of therapeutic options across oncological indications. Disruption of  tolerance is the key mechanism of action of  inhibitors and, whilst -related adverse events are a typical class effect of these compounds, the relationship between toxicity and response is not fully understood.

However,   blockade is still suboptimal in HCC treatment and more  modifications are needed to achieve an efficient therapeutic goal. Here, we investigated the combined administration of a Listeria-based HCC vaccine, Lmdd-MPFG, and the anti-PD-1   blockade antibody. We found that Lmdd-MPFG promoted the expression of PD-L1 in HCC cells but resensitized the tumor local T  to respond to the anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Mechanistically, the Lmdd-MPFG vaccine activates the NF-κB pathway in the tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) through the TLR2 and MyD88 pathway, and recruits p62 to activate the autophagy pathway. The overall effect is skewing the TAMs from M2-polarized TAMs into the M1-polarized TAMs. Most importantly, it skewed the cytokine profiles into antitumor one in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This change restores the T- reactivity to the anti-PD-1 blockade. Our results suggested that Lmdd-MPFG combined with PD-1 blockade exerted synergistic antitumor effects through modifying TAMs in the TME and removing T- inhibitory signals, thereby providing a new potential strategy for HCC treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612928>Treatment with pembrolizumab after hypersensitivity reaction to nivolumab in a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h2><p>The options for immunotherapy treatment are limited for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. In this case study, we report a case of successful alternation of one PD-1 inhibitor for another after a hypersensitivity reaction.Nivolumab (Opdivo, Bristol-Myers Squibb) has been Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for a variety of malignancies, including a recent approval for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Infusion-related reactions occur in less than 1% of patients, and although such reactions are rare, recognition of infusion-related reactions induced by nivolumab is an important aspect of its usage. The PD-1  inhibitor pembrolizumab is also FDA approved for subsequent-line therapy in treatment of HCC. Thus far, approximately 0.2% of patients experienced severe infusion-related reaction in studies using pembrolizumab. A 70-year-old male with HCC had an infusion reaction to nivolumab that presented as facial flushing, dyspnea, and back pain. The patient received prompt administration of diphenhydramine and hydrocortisone, which led to the amelioration of symptoms and allowed the patient to complete his immunotherapy treatment. For the third dose of nivolumab, the patient received premedications prior to treatment, including diphenhydramine, hydrocortisone, and famotidine. During his infusion, the patient experienced facial flushing, coughing, chest tightness, and an itchy throat. The patient again received diphenhydramine and hydrocortisone to treat infusion-related symptoms and his therapy was discontinued. Because of the nivolumab infusion-related reaction, nivolumab was discontinued, and the patient was started on pembrolizumab. The patient tolerated pembrolizumab without any subsequent infusion-related reactions. Prompt recognition and attention to immunotherapy infusion-related reactions could potentially prevent the fatal complication of anaphylaxis with   inhibitors. In this report, we describe the successful transition from one anti-PD-1 therapy to another for continued immunotherapy treatment without any subsequent infusion reactions.A patient with HCC was successfully treated with pembrolizumab after experiencing adverse effects with nivolumab.© American Society of Health-System Pharmacists 2019.

However, the majority of cancer types, including high-risk neuroblastoma remain immunologically unresponsive. High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive technique that can mechanically fractionate tumors, transforming immunologically 'cold' tumors into responsive 'hot' tumors.We treated <2% of tumor volume in previously unresponsive, large, refractory murine neuroblastoma tumors with mechanical HIFU, and assessed systemic  response using flow-cytometry, ELISA, and gene sequencing. In addition, we combined this treatment with αCTLA-4 and αPD-L1 to study its effect on the  response and long-term survival.Combining HIFU with αCTLA-4 and αPD-L1 significantly enhances anti-tumor response, improving survival from 0 to 62.5%. HIFU alone causes upregulation of splenic and lymph node NK cells and circulating IL-2, IFN-Ɣ, and DAMPs, whereas  regulators like CD4+Foxp3+, IL-10, and VEGF-A are significantly reduced. HIFU combined with  inhibitors induced significant increases in intratumoral CD4+, CD8ɑ+, and CD8α+CD11c+ cells, CD11c+ in regional lymph nodes, and decrease in circulating IL-10 compared to untreated group. We also report significant abscopal effect following unilateral treatment of mice with large, established bilateral tumors using HIFU and  inhibitors compared to tumors treated with HIFU or  inhibitors alone (61.1% survival, p<0.0001). This combination treatment significantly also induces CD4+CD44+CD62L+ and, CD8α+CD44+CD62L+ population and are adoptively transferable imparting immunity, slowing subsequent  tumor engraftment.Mechanical fractionation of tumors using HIFU can effectively induce  sensitization in a previously unresponsive murine neuroblastoma model, and promises a novel yet efficacious immuno-adjuvant modality to overcome therapeutic resistance.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624532>Suppressing immunotherapy by organ-specific tumor microenvironments: what is in the brain?</a></h2><p>Recent breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy have led to curative efficacy and significantly prolonged survival in a subset of patients of multiple cancer types; and immunotherapy has become the newest pillar of cancer treatment in addition to surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and precision targeted therapies. In the metastatic disease setting, responses to immunotherapy are heterogeneous depending on the metastatic organ sites. The tissue-specific immuno-biology in the tumor microenvironments (TMEs) contributes to the differential therapeutic responses. Herein, we review the impact of tissue-specific tumor microenvironment on the efficacy of immunotherapy, with a focus on historically under-represented central nervous system (CNS) metastasis, which was excluded from most clinical trials. Retrospective examination of patient specimens and prospective clinical studies with   blockade (ICB) have established that brain can harbor an "active"  microenvironment for effective immunotherapy. Regulation by the innate  microglial cells and remodeling of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may contribute to immunotherapeutic responses mediated by T lymphocytes. How to convert an "inactive" (cold) brain microenvironment into an "active" (hot) brain TME should be the focus of future efforts. Thus, procurement and complete examination of clinical specimens from brain metastases as well as development of appropriate preclinical brain metastasis models susceptible to external manipulation of the TME are critical steps towards that goal. A deeper understanding of the immuno-biology in distinct organ microenvironments will help to expand the benefits of immunotherapy to more needed patients.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641355>Inflammatory Biomarkers as Predictors of Response to Immunotherapy in Urological Tumors.</a></h2><p>Immunotherapy represents the new era of cancer treatment because of its promising results in various cancer types.

Patient- and tumor-related factors may be involved in primary and secondary resistance to immunotherapy: tumor-derived protein and cytokines, tumor mutational burden, and patient performance status and comorbidities can condition tumor response to ICIs. Recently, some of these factors have been evaluated as potential biomarkers of response, with conflicting results. To date, the expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and the presence of deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) in tumor tissue are the only biomarkers capable of guiding the clinician's decision in urothelial cancer and prostate cancer, respectively. In this review, we performed a comprehensive search of the main publications on biomarkers that are predictive of response to ICIs in urological cancers. Our aim was to understand whether existing data have the potential to drive clinical decision-making in the near future.Copyright © 2019 Giuseppe Schepisi et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650066>First-in-human phase I clinical trial of a combined  modulatory approach using TetMYB vaccine and Anti-PD-1 antibody in patients with advanced solid cancer including colorectal or adenoid cystic carcinoma: The MYPHISMO study protocol (NCT03287427).</a></h2><p>MYB is a transcription factor that is overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) and also a driver mutation in adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC). Therefore, the MYB protein is an ideal target to vaccinate against to aid recruitment of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) against these tumours. The Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre (Melbourne, Australia) has engineered a DNA vaccine, TetMYB, based on the pVAX1 plasmid vector carrying a fusion construct consisting of the universal tetanus toxin T- epitopes flanking an inactivated  gene.This prospective first-in-human phase I single-arm multi-centre clinical trial involves patients with metastatic CRC or AdCC. Stage 1 will evaluate the safety profile of escalating doses of TetMYB vaccine, given sequentially and in combination with an anti-PD-1 inhibitory antibody, to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Stage 2 will assess the MTD in an expanded cohort. The calculated sample size is 32 patients: 12 in Stage 1 and 20 in Stage 2. The expected total duration of the trial is 3 years with 15 months of recruitment followed by a minimum of 18 months follow-up.MYB transcription factor is aberrantly overexpressed in a range of epithelial cancers, not limited to the above tumour types. Based on promising pre-clinical data of vaccine-induced tumour clearance and establishment of anti-tumour memory, we are embarking on this first-in-human trial. If successful, the results from this trial will allow progression to a Phase II trial and validation of this breakthrough immunotherapeutic approach, not only in CRC and AdCC, but other MYB over-expressing cancers.ClinicalTrials.gov ID: .

Therefore, a better stratification of patients and the development of novel therapeutic protocols are crucially needed. The importance of tumor-infiltrating B cells (TIL-Bs) in shaping antitumor immunity remains unclear; therefore, we analyzed frequency, phenotype, prognostic value and possible roles of TIL-Bs in OPSCC.We utilized transcriptomic analysis of  response-related genes in 18 OPSCC samples with respect to human papillomavirus (HPV) status. The density and localization of CD20, CD8 and DC-LAMP cells were subsequently analyzed in 72 tissue sections of primary OPSCC samples in relation to patients' prognosis. The immunohistochemical approach was supplemented by flow cytometry-based analysis of phenotype and functionality of TIL-Bs in freshly resected primary OPSCC tissues.We observed significantly higher expression of B -related genes and higher densities of CD20 B cells in HPV-associated OPSCC samples. Interestingly, CD20 TIL-Bs and CD8 T cells formed non-organized aggregates with interacting cells within the tumor tissue. The densities of both intraepithelial CD20 B cells and B /CD8 T  interactions showed prognostic significance, which surpassed HPV positivity and CD8 TIL density in stratification of OPSCC patients. High density of TIL-Bs was associated with an activated B  phenotype, high CXCL9 production and high levels of tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells. Importantly, the abundance of direct B /CD8 T  interactions positively correlated with the frequency of HPV16-specific CD8 T cells, whereas the absence of B cells in tumor-derived  cultures markedly reduced CD8 T  survival.Our results indicate that high abundance of TIL-Bs and high density of direct B /CD8 T  interactions can predict patients with excellent prognosis, who would benefit from less invasive treatment. We propose that in extensively infiltrated tumors, TIL-Bs might recruit CD8 T cells via CXCL9 and due to a highly activated phenotype contribute by secondary costimulation to the maintenance of CD8 T cells in the tumor microenvironment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651542>Identification of Different Form Tim-3 Proteins by a Unique Set of Tim-3 Monoclonal Antibodies.</a></h2><p>T- immunoglobulin and mucin domain-3 (Tim-3) has been suggested to be a critical   target for cancer immunotherapy. However, limited progress with Tim-3 immunotherapy has been achieved over the last decade due to the lack of specific Tim-3 monoclonal antibodies. In this study, we have successfully developed a unique set of Tim-3 antibodies that are able to detect different molecular weights (by Western blot mobility) of Tim-3 proteins ectopically expressed in the same CHO cells. Some of the antibody clones detect only 33 or 55 kDa bands, the rest can recognize both 33 and 55 kDa bands on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. Antibody clones with 55 kDa specificity uniquely bind to the membrane form of Tim-3 on macrophage, which colocalizes with the CD68, and could be used as a specific marker for tumor-associated macrophage, whereas other clones showed cytoplasmic staining in tumor cells. The membrane form of Tim-3 on tumor-associated macrophages may bear significant roles for clinical application of Tim-3, but less likely for cytoplasmic one. The availability of this unique set of antibodies will be critical for an ultimate understanding of Tim-3 function in tumor microenvironment and potential clinical applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628526>Antisense targeting of CD47 enhances human cytotoxic T- activity and increases survival of mice bearing B16 melanoma when combined with anti-CTLA4 and tumor irradiation.</a></h2><p>Antibodies targeting the T-   cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA4) enhance the effectiveness of radiotherapy for melanoma patients, but many remain resistant. To further improve response rates, we explored combining anti-CTLA4 blockade with antisense suppression of CD47, an inhibitory receptor on T cells that limit T- receptor signaling and killing of irradiated target cells. Human melanoma data from The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed positive correlations between CD47 mRNA expression and expression of T- regulators including CTLA4 and its counter receptors CD80 and CD86. Antisense suppression of CD47 on human T cells in vitro using a translational blocking morpholino (CD47 m) alone or combined with anti-CTLA4 enhanced antigen-dependent killing of irradiated melanoma cells. Correspondingly, the treatment of locally irradiated B16F10 melanomas in C57BL/6 mice using combined blockade of CD47 and CTLA4 significantly increased the survival of mice relative to either treatment alone. CD47 m alone or in combination with anti-CTLA4 increased CD3 T- infiltration in irradiated tumors. Anti-CTLA4 also increased CD3 and CD8 T- infiltration as well as markers of NK cells in non-irradiated tumors. Anti-CTLA4 combined with CD47 m resulted in the greatest increase in intratumoral granzyme B, interferon-γ, and NK- marker mRNA expression. These data suggest that combining CTLA4 and CD47 blockade could provide a survival benefit by enhancing adaptive T- and NK- immunity in irradiated tumors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628651>Structures of  : An Overview on the CD28-B7 Family.</a></h2><p>The co-stimulation and co-inhibition signal pathways,  , are among the central mechanisms to regulate the T- immunity. Optimal signals involve intricate interactions of numerous ligands and receptors. Manipulation of these signals offers great clinical opportunities and has revolutionized the cancer treatment therapies. The 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to James P. Allison and Tasuku Honjo in recognition of their discovery of cancer immunotherapy by inhibition of   molecules. Despite the landmark discovery in cancer immunotherapy, the efforts to harness immunity against cancer are also restricted by the limited knowledge on the co-stimulation and co-inhibition signaling networks. Understanding the structures of these molecules, in particular, tackling the interaction paradigms from the structural perspective, help to provide more accurate insights into the signaling mechanisms, which may further facilitate the development of novel biologics and improve the efficacy of the existing biologics against these targets. Here we review our current understanding on the structures of these co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory molecules. Specifically, we focus on the structural basis of several  molecules among the CD28-B7 family and discuss the therapeutic drugs against these targets for the treatment of human cancers, autoimmune disorders, and transplantation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618962>Microsatellite Instability: Diagnosis, Heterogeneity, Discordance, and Clinical Impact in Colorectal Cancer.</a></h2><p>Tumor DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency testing is important to the identification of Lynch syndrome and decision making regarding adjuvant chemotherapy in stage II colorectal cancer (CRC) and has become an indispensable test in metastatic tumors due to the high efficacy of   inhibitor (ICI) in deficient MMR (dMMR) tumors. CRCs greatly benefit from this testing as approximately 15% of them are dMMR but only 3% to 5% are at a metastatic stage. MMR status can be determined by two different methods, microsatellite instability (MSI) testing on tumor DNA, and immunohistochemistry of the MMR proteins on tumor tissue. Recent studies have reported a rate of 3% to 10% of discordance between these two tests. Moreover, some reports suggest possible intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity of MMR and MSI status. These issues are important to know and to clarify in order to define therapeutic strategy in CRC. This review aims to detail the standard techniques used for the determination of MMR and MSI status, along with their advantages and limits. We review the discordances that may arise between these two tests, tumor heterogeneity of MMR and MSI status, and possible explanations. We also discuss the strategies designed to distinguish sporadic versus germline dMMR/MSI CRC.

One rare adverse effect that is emerging is eosinophilic fasciitis, a fibrosing disorder causing inflammatory infiltration of subcutaneous fascia. It is characterized clinically by edema and subsequent induration and tightening of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. The condition is rare, yet at our institutions we have seen four cases in the past 3 years. We describe our 4 cases and review 11 other cases reported in the literature.We present four cases of eosinophilic fasciitis following treatment with programmed  death protein 1 or programmed  death-ligand 1 blockade. All patients had extremity involvement with characteristic skin changes ranging from peripheral edema to induration, tightening, and joint limitation. The patients had varying degrees of peripheral eosinophilia. In two of our patients, the diagnosis was made by full-thickness skin biopsy showing lymphocytic infiltration of the subcutaneous fascia, with CD4+ T cells predominating in one case and CD8+ T cells in the other. In the other two cases, the diagnosis was made on the basis of characteristic imaging findings in the context of clinical features consistent with the diagnosis. All four patients were treated with glucocorticoids with varying degrees of success; immunotherapy had to be discontinued in all four. Patients with advanced melanoma who experienced this adverse effect had either a partial response or a complete response to therapy.Eosinophilic fasciitis can occur as a result of  inhibitor therapy. Although a tissue diagnosis is the gold standard, imaging studies may facilitate the diagnosis in the presence of consistent clinical features, but a degree of suspicion is key to recognizing the condition early. Therapy requires a collaborative approach by oncology, rheumatology, and dermatology; physical therapy is an important adjunct in treatment. For advanced melanoma, it may be a good prognostic indicator.It is important for clinicians to recognize that eosinophilic fasciitis is a potential -related adverse event (irAE) as a consequence of   inhibitor therapy. The presentation is quite stereotypical; the diagnosis can be made by imaging in the absence of a full-thickness skin biopsy. Early intervention is important to limit morbidity. This irAE may be a good prognostic sign among patients with melanoma.© AlphaMed Press 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653079>Neurological  Related Adverse Events Associated with Nivolumab, Ipilimumab, and Pembrolizumab Therapy-Review of the Literature and Future Outlook.</a></h2><p>  inhibitor (ICI) therapy has revolutionized the management of various cancers with previously poor prognosis. Despite its great efficacy, the therapy is associated with a wide spectrum of -related adverse events (irAE) including neurological symptoms which can affect all parts of the central and peripheral nervous system. Even though these events are rare, they are of high relevance as the rate of residual symptoms or even fatal outcomes is remarkable. To provide a detailed overview of neurological adverse events associated with  -inhibitor therapy we conducted a literature search. While focusing on ipilimumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab therapy, all available case reports as well as larger case series and clinical trials have been considered. Eighty-two case reports about -inhibitor therapy induced symptoms of the peripheral nervous system have been published, while only 43 case reports addressed central nervous system abnormalities. The frequency of  -inhibitor therapy inducing neurological adverse events is about 1% in larger studies. Especially neuromuscular adverse events exhibit distinct clinical and diagnostic characteristics. Additionally, several affected patients presented with overlap-syndromes, which means that symptoms and diagnostic findings indicating myositis, myasthenia gravis, and neuropathy were present in one individual patient at the same time. Thus, neurological and particularly neuromuscular adverse events of  -inhibitor therapy may constitute a new disease entity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650941>[Diagnosis and Treatment Recommendation and Exploration for Critical and Refractory Adverse Effects Related to Immunocheckpoint Inhibitors].</a></h2><p>The application of immunological  inhibitors (ICIs) has modified many treatment strategies of malignant tumors, which has become a milestone in cancer therapy. The principle of action can be explained as "brake theory". After releasing the brakes by ICIs, unprecedented systemic toxicities, even some refractory and fatal -related adverse effects (irAEs) may develop. In this article, we summarized the recommended treatments of grade 3-4 severe irAEs in the latest European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)/American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) and Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO) guidelines and consensus. We also performed a systemic review of case reports and reviews of irAEs up to May 20, 2019 in PubMed and Chinese journals. Successful applications of specific immunosuppressive drugs and stimulating factors beyond the above guidelines and consensus were supplemented and highlighted, including agents blocking interleukin 6 (IL-6), rituximab, anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) monoclonal antibody (mAb), anti-integrin 4 mAb, Janus kinase inhibitors, thrombopoietin receptor agonists and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) etc. We put some concerns of using high-dose steroids for long-term, and emphasize the secondary infections, tumor progression, and unavailability of ICI re-challenge during steroid treatment. We propose the "De-escalation Therapy" principle for severe and refractory irAEs, and suggest that immunosuppressive drugs specifically targeting cytokines should be used as early as possible. Many irAEs in the era of immunotherapy are unprecedented compared with traditional chemotherapy and small-molecule targeted therapy, which is a big challenge to oncologists. Therefore, the establishment of multidisciplinary system is very important for the management of cancer patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628024>DNA methylation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) in head and neck squamous  carcinomas correlates with IDO1 expression, HPV status, patients' survival,   infiltrates, mutational load, and interferon γ signature.</a></h2><p>The  , indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1, is under investigation as target of novel immunotherapies for cancers, including head and neck squamous  carcinomas (HNSCC). The aim of our study was to analyze DNA methylation of the encoding gene (IDO1) in HNSCC.Methylation of three CpG sites within the promoter, promoter flank, and gene body was investigated and correlated with mRNA expression,   infiltration, mutational burden, human papillomavirus (HPV)-status, and overall survival in a cohort of N = 528 HNSCC patients obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas. In addition, IDO1 immunohistochemistry and DNA methylation analysis was performed in an independent cohort of N = 138 HNSCC samples.Significant inverse correlations of IDO1 methylation and IDO1 mRNA expression were found in the promoter and promoter flank region (Spearman's ρ = -0.163 and ρ = -0.377, respectively) while a positive correlation was present in the gene body (ρ = 0.502; all P < 0.001). IDO1 DNA methylation significantly correlated with IDO1 protein expressing  cells as well as tumor cells. IDO1 promoter flank hypermethylation was significantly associated with poor overall survival (P < 0.001). In addition, we discovered significant correlations between IDO1 methylation and expression with RNA signatures of   infiltrates and with HPV-status, mutational load (methylation only), and interferon γ signature.Our results suggest IDO1 expression levels are epigenetically regulated by DNA methylation. This study provides rationale to test IDO1 methylation as potential biomarker for prediction of response to IDO1   inhibitors in HNSCC.Crown Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Herein we report an integrated nanoplatform that combines PDT with immunotherapy to enhance photodynamic therapeutic effects and simultaneously inhibit tumor cells resistance/evasion. To achieve this, we fabricated Mn@CaCO/ICG nanoparticles and loaded them with PD-L1-targeting siRNA.  Thanks to the protection of CaCO on the loaded ICG and the oxygen produced by MnO, an enhanced photodynamic therapeutic effect  was observed.  experiments demonstrated that the nanoplatform could efficiently deliver the loaded drug to the tumor tissues and significantly improve tumor hypoxia, which further contributes to the therapeutic effect of PDT . Moreover, the synergistic benefits derived from the siRNA, which silenced the  gene PD-L1 that mediates the  resistance/evasion, resulted in a surprising therapeutic effect to rouse the  system.

One aspect of  death is the potential to release antigens that initiate adaptive  responses. Here, a diffusion enhanced formulation, INT230-6, containing potent anti-cancer cytotoxic agents, was administered intratumorally into large (approx. 300mm) subcutaneous murine Colon26 tumors. Treatment resulted in regression from baseline in 100% of the tumors and complete response in up to 90%. CD8 or CD8/CD4 T  double-depletion at treatment onset prevented complete responses, indicating a critical role of T cells in promoting complete tumor regression. Mice with complete response were protected from subcutaneous and intravenous re-challenge of Colon26 cells in a CD4/CD8 dependent manner. Thus, immunological T  memory was induced by INT230-6. Colon26 tumors express the endogenous retroviral protein gp70 containing the CD8 T- AH-1 epitope. AH-1-specific CD8 T cells were detected in peripheral blood of tumor-bearing mice and their frequency increased 14 days after treatment onset. AH-1-specific CD8 T cells were also significantly enriched in tumors of untreated mice. These cells had an activated phenotype and highly expressed Programmed -death protein-1 (PD-1) but did not lead to tumor regression. CD8 T  tumor infiltrate also increased 11 days after treatment. INT230-6 synergized with  blockade, inducing a complete remission of the primary tumors and shrinking of untreated contralateral tumors, which demonstrates not only a local but also systemic immunological effect of the combined therapy.

In advanced gastric cancer (AGC) patients, there have been few reports about the correlation between irAEs and efficacy of   inhibitors. In this study, we retrospectively investigated the correlation between irAEs and efficacy in AGC patients treated with nivolumab.The subjects of this study were AGC patients received nivolumab monotherapy between January 2015 and August 2018. IrAEs were defined as those AEs having a potential immunological basis that required close follow-up, or immunosuppressive therapy and/or endocrine therapy. We divided the patients who received nivolumab into two groups based on occurrence of irAEs; those with irAEs (irAE group) or those without (non-irAE group). We assessed the efficacy in both groups.Of the 65 AGC patients that received nivolumab monotherapy, 14 developed irAEs. The median time to onset of irAEs was 30.5 days (range 3-407 days). Median follow-up period for survivors was 32 months (95% CI, 10.8 to 34.5). The median progression-free survival was 7.5 months (95% CI, 3.6 to 11.5) in the irAE group and 1.4 months (95% CI, 1.2 to 1.6) in the non-irAE group (HR = 0.11, p < 0.001).

The frequently used immunotherapy agents are   inhibitors, such as antibodies specific to PD1, PD-L1, or CTLA-4. However, these drugs are highly expensive, and most people in the world cannot access the treatment. The development of recombinant protein production platforms that are cost-effective, scalable, and safe is needed. Plant platforms are attractive because of their low production cost, speed, scalability, lack of human and animal pathogens, and post-translational modifications that enable them to produce effective monoclonal antibodies. In this study, an anti-PD1 IgG4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) was transiently produced in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. The plant-produced anti-PD1 mAb was compared to the commercial nivolumab produced in CHO cells. Our results showed that both antibodies have similar protein structures, and the N-glycans on the plant-produced antibody lacks plant-specific structures. The PD1 binding affinity of the plant-produced and commercial nivolumab, determined by two different techniques, that is, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), are also comparable. Plant-produced nivolumab binds to human PD1 protein with high affinity and specificity, blocks the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction, and enhances T  function, comparable to commercial nivolumab.

Alongside, CASP3 regulates stress-responsive immunomodulatory pathways, including secretion of type I interferon (IFN). Here, we report that mouse mammary carcinoma TSA cells lacking  or subjected to chemical caspase inhibition were as sensitive to the cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of radiation therapy (RT)  as their control counterparts, yet secreted increased levels of type I IFN. This effect originated from the accrued accumulation of irradiated cells with cytosolic DNA, likely reflecting the delayed breakdown of cells experiencing mitochondrial permeabilization in the absence of CASP3.  TSA cells growing in immunocompetent syngeneic mice were more sensitive to RT than their CASP3-proficient counterparts, and superior at generating  abscopal responses in the presence of an   blocker. Finally, multiple genetic signatures of apoptotic proficiency were unexpectedly found to have robust negative (rather than positive) prognostic significance in a public cohort of breast cancer patients. However, these latter findings were not consistent with genetic signatures of defective type I IFN signaling, which were rather associated with improved prognosis. Differential gene expression analysis on patient subgroups with divergent prognosis (as stratified by independent signatures of apoptotic proficiency) identified  as a new biomarker with independent prognostic value in breast cancer patients. With the caveats associated with the retrospective investigation of heterogeneous, public databases, our data suggest that apoptotic caspases may influence the survival of breast cancer patients (or at least some subsets thereof) via mechanisms not necessarily related to type I IFN signaling as they identify a novel independent prognostic biomarker that awaits prospective validation.© 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655421>Lymphocytic ganglionitis leading to megacolon in lymphocyte-rich glioblastoma.</a></h2><p>T-  attack of cancer cells underlies the efficacy of   inhibitors in many cancer subtypes, but is not yet well established in the primary brain cancer glioblastoma.   inhibitor treatments that disinhibit the  system to enhance  clearance of cancer have in rare cases resulted in T- attack of peripheral ganglia causing lymphocytic ganglionitis.

Comprised of dinuclear W VI secondary building units and photosensitizing 5,10,15,20-tetra( p -benzoato)porphyrin (TBP) ligands, cationic W-TBP mediates PDT to release tumor associated antigens and delivers immunostimulatory CpG oligodeoxynucleotides to DCs. The enhanced antigen presentation synergizes with CBI to expand and reinvigorate cytotoxic T cells, leading to superb anticancer efficacy and robust abscopal effects with >97% tumor regression in a bilateral breast cancer model.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Until recently, beclin-1 was a protein known mainly for its role as a critical regulator of autophagy. In this issue of the JCI, Tan et al. describe the effects of the beclin-1 conditional myeloid -specific deletion in mice, in which immunostimulation resulted in hypersensitive neutrophils. The chronic proinflammatory effect of these neutrophils triggered spontaneous B  malignancies to develop. Such tumorigenic effects were mediated primarily by IL-21 and CD40 signaling, leading to the upregulation of tolerogenic molecules, such as IL-10 and PD-L1. The authors went on to examine samples derived from patient lymphoid malignancies and showed that beclin-1 expression in neutrophils positively correlated with pre-B  leukemia/lymphoma. Overall, the study provides an elegant model for neutrophil-driven carcinogenesis and identifies potential targets for immunotherapy of B  malignancies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650942>[The Use of Glucocorticoid in the Management of Adverse Effects Related to Immunocheckpoint Inhibitors].</a></h2><p>Immunocheckpoint inhibitors (ICIs) activated the patients' tumor immunity to kill the tumor , and brought new hope to patients with tumor.

Multimodal therapies employing agents that can affect different arms of the  system and/or tumor microenvironment might increase clinical responses.We demonstrate that entinostat, a class I histone deacetylase inhibitor, enhances the anti-tumor efficacy of the IL-15 superagonist, N-803 plus vaccine in 4T1 triple-negative breast and MC38-CEA colon murine carcinoma models. A comprehensive  and gene expression analysis was performed in the periphery and/or tumor microenvironment (TME) of MC38-CEA tumor-bearing mice.Although N-803 plus vaccine induced peripheral CD8 T  activation and cytokine production, there was no reduction in tumor burden and poor tumor infiltration of CD8 T cells with minimal levels of granzyme B. For the first time, we demonstrate that the addition of entinostat to N-803 plus vaccine promoted significant tumor control, correlating with increased expression of genes associated with tumor inflammation, enhanced infiltration of activated CD8 T cells with maximal granzyme B, T- responses to multiple tumor-associated antigens, increased serum IFNg, reduction of regulatory T cells in the TME, and decreased expression of the  V-domain Ig Suppressor of T  Activation (VISTA) on multiple  subsets.Collectively, these data demonstrate that the synergistic combination of entinostat, N-803, and vaccine elicits potent anti-tumor activity by generating a more inflamed TME.

Here, we show that the blockade of the CD11b-dependent extravasation of myeloid cells blocks such a combination effect as well. Based on the characterization of the myeloid and lymphoid  infiltrates, including the expression pattern of   proteins (and noting a chemotherapy-induced overexpression of programmed death-ligand 1, PD-L1, on both cancer cells and leukocytes, as well as a reduced frequency of exhausted CD8 T cells positive for programmed  death 1 protein, PD-1), we then evaluated the possibility to combine ICD inducers, CRMs and targeting of the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. While fasting or CRMs failed to improve tumor growth control by PD-1 blockade, ICD inducers alone achieved a partial sensitization to treatment with a PD-1-specific antibody. However, definitive cure of most of the tumor-bearing mice was only achieved by a tritherapy combining (i) ICD inducers exemplified by mitoxantrone and oxaliplatin, (ii) CRMs exemplified by hydroxycitrate and spermidine and substitutable for by fasting, and (iii)   inhibitors (ICIs) targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction.

Functional enrichment analysis was carried out of the miRNAs included in the miRNA-based signature classifier. : Twenty-five differentially expressed miRNAs were used to establish a miRNA-based signature classifier for predicting TMB level. The accuracy of the 25-miRNA-based signature classifier was 0.850 in the training set, 0.810 in the test set and 0.840 in the total set. This miRNA-based signature classifier index showed a low correlation with PD-1 and PD-L1, and no correlation with CTLA-4.

The substantial risks and cost associated with this procedure render it unfeasible on a large scale. This strategy also indicates that a common pathway toward a cure for both HIV and cancer may exist. Successful approaches to curing both diseases should ideally possess three components, i.e., (1) direct targeting of pathological cells (neoplastic cells in cancer and the HIV-infected reservoir cells), (2) subsequent impediment to reconstitution of the pool of pathological cells and (3) sustained, immunologic control of the disease (both diseases are characterized by detrimental  hyper-activation that hinders successful establishment of immunity).

While it is effective as an anti-emetic and in preventing hypersensitivity reactions, dexamethasone depletes peripheral blood lymphocytes and impacts  responses. The effect of dexamethasone on the number and quality of tumour-infiltrating leukocytes has not been reported. To address this, we calibrated the dose in two different strains of mice to achieve the same extent of peripheral blood lymphocyte depletion observed in patients with cancer. Doses that caused analogous depletion of T and B lymphocytes and NK cells from the peripheral blood, elicited no change in these populations within the tumour. The expression of   molecules PD-1, OX40, GITR and TIM3 on tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes was not altered. We found that dexamethasone had a small but significant deleterious impact on weakly efficacious chemoimmunotherapy but had no effect when the protocol was highly efficacious.

Combination anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 blockade therapy has enhanced efficacy, but it remains unclear through what mechanisms such effects are mediated. A critical question is whether combination therapy targets and modulates the same T  populations as monotherapies. Using a mass cytometry-based systems approach, we comprehensively profiled the response of T  populations to monotherapy and combination anti-CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-1 therapy in syngeneic murine tumors and clinical samples. Most effects of monotherapies were additive in the context of combination therapy; however, multiple combination therapy-specific effects were observed. Highly phenotypically exhausted cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) T cells expand in frequency following anti-PD-1 monotherapy but not combination therapy, while activated terminally differentiated effector CD8 T cells expand only following combination therapy. Combination therapy also led to further increased frequency of T helper type 1 (Th1)-like CD4 effector T cells even though anti-PD-1 monotherapy is not sufficient to do so. Mass cytometry analyses of peripheral blood from melanoma patients treated with   blockade therapies similarly revealed mostly additive effects on the frequencies of T  subsets along with unique modulation of terminally differentiated effector CD8 T cells by combination ipilimumab plus nivolumab therapy. Together, these findings indicate that dual blockade of CTLA-4 and PD-1 therapy is sufficient to induce unique cellular responses compared with either monotherapy.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

Poor DC development can limit the efficacy of   blockade and  vaccination approaches. Interference in intracellular signaling cascades downstream from the receptors of major tumor-associated suppressive cytokines like IL-10 and IL-6, might improve DC development and activation, and thus enhance immunotherapy efficacy. We performed exploratory functional screens on arrays consisting of >1000 human kinase peptide substrates to identify pathways involved in DC development and its inhibition by IL-10 or IL-6. The resulting alterations in phosphorylation of the kinome substrate profile pointed to glycogen-synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) as a pivotal kinase in both DC development and suppression. GSK3β inhibition blocked human DC differentiation , which was accompanied by decreased levels of IL-12p70 secretion, and a reduced capacity for T  priming. More importantly, adenoviral transduction of monocytes with a constitutively active form of GSK3β induced resistance to the suppressive effects of IL-10 and melanoma-derived supernatants alike, resulting in improved DC development, accompanied by up-regulation of co-stimulatory markers, an increase in CD83 expression levels in mature DC, and diminished release of IL-10. Moreover, adenovirus-mediated intratumoral manipulation of this pathway in an  melanoma model resulted in DC activation and recruitment, and in improved  surveillance and tumor control. We propose the induction of constitutive GSK3β activity as a novel therapeutic means to bolster DC functionality in the tumor microenvironment.© 2019 The Author(s).

The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of the CONUT score in NSCLC patients treated with pembrolizumab.We conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical data of 32 patients with advanced NSCLC who received pembrolizumab monotherapy. A cut-off CONUT score of 2 was used to categorize patients into low and high CONUT groups. We evaluated the relation between the clinicopathological factors including CONUT score and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the prognosis.Twenty-two patients were classified into the low CONUT score group, while 10 were classified into the high CONUT score group. In the univariate and multivariate analyses, the number of prior treatments and the CONUT score were found to independently predict progression-free survival (PFS) (P<0.05), while the CONUT score as well as NLR was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (P<0.05). In addition, in patients who received pembrolizumab as a first-line treatment, a high CONUT score was associated with a significantly worse PFS and overall survival in comparison to a low CONUT score.The CONUT score has potential application as a predictor of the therapeutic effect and the prognosis of NSCLC patients treated with pembrolizumab.

In contrast, tumor cells highly express PD-L1, which binds to receptor PD-1 expressed on activated T cells, leading to  escape. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1   therapy blocks the binding of PD-1/PD-L1 to reinvigorate the exhausted T cells, thereby inhibiting tumor growth. Exosomes are biologically active lipid-bilayer nanovesicles secreted by various  types that mediate intercellular signal communication. Numerous studies have shown that tumor cells are able to promote tumor epithelial-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, and  escape by releasing exosomes. Recent studies imply that tumor-derived exosomes could carry PD-L1 in the same membrane topology as the  surface, thereby resisting   therapy. In this review, we mainly discuss the role of exosomes in the regulation of tumor progression and the potential resistance mechanism to immunotherapy via exosomal PD-L1. In addition, we propose that exosomal PD-L1 may have the potential to be a target to overcome resistance to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623599>Development of a novel human phage display-derived anti-LAG3 scFv antibody targeting CD8 T lymphocyte exhaustion.</a></h2><p>Lymphocyte-activation gene (LAG)3 is a 498 aa transmembrane type I protein acting as an  inhibitory receptor. It is expressed on activated lymphocytes, natural killer cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. In activated lymphocytes, LAG3 expression is involved in negative control of  activation/proliferation to ensure modulation and control of  responses. In view of its deregulated expression in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, LAG3, together with the additional   inhibitors CTLA4 and PD1, is considered a major target in order to reverse the immunosuppression typically mounting in oncologic diseases. Since many patients still fail to respond to current  -based therapies, the identification of new effective  inhibitors is a priority in the ongoing fight against cancer.We identified a novel human single-chain variable fragment (scFv) Ab against a conformational epitope of LAG3 by in vitro phage display technology using the recombinant antigen as a bait. This scFv (referred to as F7) was characterized in terms of binding specificity to both recombinant antigen and human LAG3-expressing cells. It was then rebuilt into an IgG format pre-optimized for clinical usage, and the resulting bivalent construct was shown to preserve its ability to bind LAG3 on human cells. Next, we analyzed the activity of the anti-LAG3 scFvF7 using two different antigen-specific CD8 T lymphocyte clones as target cells. We proved that the reconstituted anti-LAG3 F7 Ab efficiently binds the  membrane of both  clones after peptide-activation. Still more significantly, we observed a striking increase in the peptide-dependent  activation upon Ab treatment as measured in terms of IFN-γ release by both ELISA and ELISPOT assays.Overall, the biotechnological strategy described herein represents a guiding development model for the search of novel useful   inhibitors. In addition, our functional data propose a novel candidate reagent for consideration as a cancer treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657540>Task-Specific Design of -Augmented Nanoplatform to Enable High-Efficiency Tumor Immunotherapy.</a></h2><p>Potentiating systemic immunity against breast cancer is in the most urgent demand as breast cancer is low sensitive to   blockade (ICB). Although phototherapy and some chemotherapy can trigger immunogenic  death (ICD) for T -mediated antitumor  response, their immunotherapy efficacy is severely restricted by insufficient phototherapeutic capability and severe multidrug resistance (MDR). Inspired by both the hypersensitivity to phototherapy and the key role in MDR for mitochondria, a rationally engineered immunity amplifier via mitochondria-targeted photo-chemotherapeutic nanoparticles was, for the first time, achieved to fight against low-immunogenic breast cancer without additional  agent. The newly synthesized task-specific mitochondria-targeted IR780 derivative (T780) was integrated with chemotherapeutic doxorubicin (DOX) to form multifunctional nanoparticles via assembling strategy along with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as biomimetic corona (BSA@T780/DOX NPs). The in situ enhancement in both phototherapy and MDR reversal by targeting mitochondria with BSA@T780/DOX NPs boosted high-efficient ICD toward excellent antitumor  response. The newly developed strategy not only eradicated the primary tumor, but also eliminated the bilateral tumors efficiently, as well as preventing metastasis and postsurgical recurrence, demonstrating great interest for fighting against low-immunogenic breast cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660663>Mucous membrane pemphigoid and lichenoid reactions after   inhibitors: common pathomechanisms.</a></h2><p>  inhibitor (ICI) therapy has demonstrated impressive antitumor activity.

The remarkable efficacy of   blockade has been confirmed in various solid tumors. However, the correlation between PD-L1 expression and host immunological landscape remains of considerable controversy in non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC). In the present study, PD-L1 expression and CD8 tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) infiltration levels were determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in tumor sections of 138 NSCLC patients. The expression level of PD-L1 was positively correlated with the abundance of CD8  TILs ( < 0.0001). Furthermore, no constitutive expression of PD-L1 was observed in the majority of six NSCLC  lines detected by Western blot; but exposure to interferon-γ (IFN-γ), a primary cytokine secreted by activated CD8 T cells, prominently increased PD-L1 expression. Notably, a significantly positive association was determined within PD-L1, CD8 and IFN-γ gene expression by qRT-PCR, which was corroborated by RNA-sequencing from TCGA lung cancer dataset. These findings demonstrate that PD-L1 expression indicates an adaptive  resistance mechanism adopted by tumor cells in the aversion of immunogenic destruction by CD8 TILs. Both higher expression of PD-L1 and infiltration of CD8 TILs were correlated with superior prognosis ( = 0.044 for PD-L1;  = 0.002 for CD8). Moreover, Cox multivariate regression analysis showed that the combination of PD-L1 and CD8 were independent prognostic factors, which was more accurate in prediction of prognosis in NSCLC than individually. Finally, we found that IFN-γ induced the upregulation of PD-L1 in NSCLC cells, mainly through the JAK/STAT1 signaling pathway. In conclusion, PD-L1 expression is mainly induced by activated CD8 TILs via IFN-γ in the  milieu and indicates pre-existing adaptive  response in NSCLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650944>[Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment Recommendations for Cardiac Adverse Reactions Related to   Inhibitor].</a></h2><p>Immunotherapy of malignant tumors has become a hot spot in the field of cancer research and treatment, bringing new hope to patients with advanced cancer.

The improvement of prognostic tools and systemic therapy are urgently needed. Targeting the  system using  inhibitors such as PD1/PDL1 inhibitors is an attractive novel therapeutic strategy for poor-prognosis tumors. Multiple clinical trials are ongoing, including in advanced ACC. However, PDL1 expression has been studied in ACC in only one heterogeneous series of 28 clinical samples. Here, we have retrospectively analyzed  mRNA expression in 146 clinical ACC samples and searched for correlations between expression and biological and clinicopathological data, including post-operative disease-free survival (DFS).  mRNA expression was heterogeneous across samples. "PDL1-high" tumors were not associated with the classical prognostic variables but were associated with longer DFS in both uni- and multivariate analyses. High PDL1 mRNA expression was associated with biological signs of the cytotoxic local  response. Supervised analysis between "PDL1-high" and "PDL1-low" tumors identified a robust 370-gene signature whose ontology analysis suggested the existence in "PDL1-high" tumors of a cytotoxic T- response, however, associated with some degree of T- exhaustion. In conclusion,  mRNA expression refines the prognostication in ACC and high expression is associated with longer DFS. Clinical validation at the protein level and functional validation are required to fully understand the role of PDL1 in ACC. Reactivation of dormant tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes by PDL1-inhibitors could represent a promising strategy in "PDL1-high" ACCs, supporting the ongoing clinical trials.© 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645352>Neoadjuvant PD-1   blockade reverses functional immunodominance among tumor-antigen specific T cells.</a></h2><p>Surgical resection of primary tumor with regional lymphadenectomy remains the treatment of choice for patients with advanced human papillomavirus-negative head and neck squamous  carcinoma. However, even when pathologic disease-free margins can be achieved, locoregional and/or distant disease relapse remains high. Perioperative immunotherapy may improve outcomes, but mechanistic data supporting the use of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment clinically is sparse.Two syngeneic models of oral cavity carcinoma with defined T  antigens were treated with PD-1 mAb before or after surgical resection of primary tumors, and antigen-specific T  responses were explored with functional and challenge assays.We demonstrated that functional immunodominance developed among T cells targeting multiple independent tumor antigens. T cells specific for subdominant antigens expressed greater levels of PD-1. Neoadjuvant, but not adjuvant, PD-1   blockade broke immunodominance and induced T  responses to dominant and subdominant antigens. Using tumors lacking the immunodominant antigen as a model of antigen escape, neoadjuvant PD-1   blockade induced effector T  immunity against tumor cells lacking immunodominant but retaining subdominant antigen. When combined with complete surgical excision, neoadjuvant PD-1   blockade led to formation of immunologic memory capable of preventing engraftment of tumors lacking the immunodominant but retaining subdominant antigen.Together, these results implicate PD-1 expression by T cells in the mechanism of functional immunodominance among independent T  clones within a progressing tumor, and support the use of neoadjuvant PD-1   blockade in patients with surgically resectable carcinomas.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643657>Ipilimumab.</a></h2><p>Ipilimumab is a human monoclonal antibody to cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 which acts as an   inhibitor increases  reactivity and is used to treat metastatic malignant melanoma.

We examined the association between time to publication and drug type using a multilevel Cox regression model that was adjusted for clustering within drug indications and individual covariates.Between 2011 and 2014, 36 anticancer drugs including 3 ICPis were newly approved by the FDA. Of 19 trials investigating the 3 ICPis, 11 (58%) were published within 2 years post-approval. We randomly selected 10 of the 33 remaining anticancer drugs; 68 of 101 trials investigating these drugs (67%) were published. Overall, the publication rate was 66% at 2 years post-approval with a median time to publication of 2.3 years. There was no significant difference in the time to trial publication between ICPis and other anticancer drugs (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.8-1.7; P = 0.55). However, findings related to non-ICPis investigated specifically in randomized phase 2 or phase 3 trials were significantly more likely to be published earlier than those related to ICPis (adjusted HR, 7.4; 95% CI, 1.8-29.5; P = 0.005).One in 3 sponsor-submitted trials of the most recently approved anticancer drugs remained unpublished 2 years post-FDA approval. We found no evidence that the drug type was associated with the time to overall trial publication.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646079>Clinical evidence that immunogenic  death sensitizes to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade.</a></h2><p>In preclinical in vivo models of cancer, the induction of immunogenic  death (ICD) sensitizes to subsequent immunotherapy.

Yet, the sensitive detection of multiple   from small volumes of liquid biopsy samples is challenging. In this study, we develop a multiplexed   biosensor (MICB) for parallel detection of soluble   PD-1, PD-L1, and LAG-3. MICB integrates a microfluidic sandwich immunoassay using engineered single chain variable fragments and alternating current electrohydrodynamic in situ nanofluidic mixing for promoting biosensor-target interaction and reducing non-specific non-target binding. MICB provides advantages of simultaneous analysis of up to 28 samples in <2 h, requires as little as a single sample drop (i.e., 20 μL) per target  , and applies high-affinity yeast -derived single chain variable fragments as a cost-effective alternative to monoclonal antibodies. We investigate the assay performance of MICB and demonstrate its capability for accurate   detection in simulated patient serum samples at clinically-relevant levels. MICB provides a dynamic range of 5 to 200 pg mL-1 for PD-1 and PD-L1, and 50 to 1000 pg mL-1 for LAG-3 with a coefficient of variation <13.8%. Sensitive   detection was achieved with limits of detection values of 5 pg mL-1 for PD-1, 5 pg mL-1 for PD-L1, and 50 pg mL-1 for LAG-3. The multiplexing capability, sensitivity, and relative assay simplicity of MICB make it capable of serving as a bioanalytical tool for   therapy monitoring.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619019>Technological and Therapeutic Advances in Advanced Small  Lung Cancer.</a></h2><p>Small  lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for approximately 10-15% of all lung cancers. The prognosis is poor with median survival in the advanced stage remaining at around 12 months. Despite applying every known therapeutic approach, no major breakthrough has improved the overall survival in the last 30 years. Historically, experiments performed on conventional  lines may have limitations of not accurately reflecting the complex biological and genomic heterogeneity of this disease. However, additional knowledge gained from recently developed genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) and patient derived xenografts (PDXs) have made encouraging inroads. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) data reveals a high mutational burden and a number of genetic alterations but low frequency of targetable mutations. Despite several failures, considerable therapeutic opportunities have recently emerged. Potentially promising therapies include those targeting DNA damage repair, stem /renewal and drug resistant mechanisms. Modest success has also been achieved with   inhibitors while therapeutic exploration of various other components of the  system is underway. However, the complex heterogeneities reflect the need for accurate bio-markers to translate novel discoveries into clinical benefit. Additionally, the molecular mechanisms that differentiate chemo-sensitive from chemo-refractory disease remain unknown. Obtaining reliable tumour samples by utilising novel techniques such as endobronchial ultrasound guided needle aspiration or adopting to liquid biopsies are becoming popular.

We aimed at thoroughly characterizing the  infiltrate and expression of   PD-L1/CTLA-4 and mismatch repair (MMR) proteins in these neoplasms, seeking for associations with patient outcome.  A total of 162 consecutively diagnosed patients (2005-2018) were included. Immunostaining for PD-L1, CTLA-4 and MMR proteins was independently assessed both in  cells (ICs) and tumor cells (TCs) of primary tumors and metastases, and characterization of IC populations was pursued.  PD-L1 and CTLA-4 positivity in ICs was frequent (85.5% and 96.3%). Patients with absent PD-L1 positive ICs exhibited significantly worse relapse-free survival (hazard ratio = 4.481, 95% CI 1.366-14.697,  = 0.013), both in univariable and multivariable analysis. Lower CD20 and CD3 IC infiltration in seminomas associated with higher disease stage ( = 0.0216,  = 0.0291). CTLA-4 TC intensity was significantly higher in yolk sac tumor, choriocarcinoma and teratoma, while PD-L1 TC positivity was significantly more frequent in choriocarcinoma.

Links to defects in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system are well established in early onset colorectal, urothelial and gynaecological malignancies. MMR deficient patients treated with   inhibitors have demonstrated improved response rates. Studies exploring MMR status in head and neck squamous  carcinoma (HNSCC) demonstrate conflicting results. This study explores the incidence of MMR protein loss and its association with clinicopathological features and outcome in oSCC. Immunohistochemical staining using tissue microarrays to assess the expression of MMR proteins (hMLH1, hMSH2, hMSH6, and hPMS2) was performed on 285 consecutive oSCC cases between 2000 and 2016. Data on smoking, alcohol and metachronous malignancies were retrospectively collected. Proportional hazards regression models were used to compare survival in MMR intact and deficient patients. MMR deficiency was seen in 21 patients (7.4%). MMR deficient tumours were associated with bone invasion (52% vs 32%, p=0.05), higher pT stage (pT4 in 57% vs 35%, p<0.001) and a higher number of metachronous malignancies (p=0.05). MMR deficiency was not associated with younger age at presentation or absence of smoking or alcohol. There was no significant association between MMR status and survival (overall survival hazard ratio 1.36; p=0.32). The incidence of MMR loss in oSCC is low and is not associated with young age at presentation. MMR deficiency in oSCC is associated with an increase in the number of metachronous malignancies and more advanced primary tumours.Copyright © 2019.

DC-based anticancer vaccination relies on patient-derived DCs pulsed with a source of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) in the context of standardized maturation-cocktails, followed by their reinfusion. Extensive evidence has confirmed that DC-based vaccines can generate TAA-specific, cytotoxic T cells. Nonetheless, clinical efficacy of DC-based vaccines remains suboptimal, reflecting the widespread immunosuppression within tumors.

Recent studies have revealed that IGV SHM creates neoantigens that activate T- responses against B- lymphoma.To determine the clinical relevance of IGV SHM in DLBCL treated with standard immunochemotherapy, we performed next-generation sequencing of the immunoglobulin variable regions and complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) for 378 patients with de novo DLBCL. The prognostic effects of IGV SHM and ongoing SHM or intra-clonal heterogeneity were analyzed in the training (192 patients), validation (186 patients), and overall DLBCL cohorts. To gain mechanistic insight, we analyzed the predicted IG-derived neoantigens' immunogenicity potential, determined by the major histocompatibility complex-binding affinity and the frequency-of-occurrence of T -exposed motifs (TCEMs) in a TCEM repertoire derived from human proteome, microbiome, and pathogen databases. Furthermore, IGV SHM was correlated with molecular characteristics of DLBCL and PD-1/L1 expression in the tumor microenvironment assessed by fluorescent multiplex immunohistochemistry.SHM was commonly found in IGHV and less frequently in IGK/LV. High levels of clonal IGHV SHM (SHM) were associated with prolonged overall survival in DLBCL patients, particularly those without BCL2 or MYC translocation. In contrast, long heavy chain CDR3 length, the presence of IGHV ongoing SHM in DLBCL, and high clonal IGK/LV SHM in germinal center B--like (GCB)-DLBCL were associated with poor prognosis. These prognostic effects were significant in both the training and validation sets. By prediction, the SHM groups harbored more potentially -stimulatory neoantigens with high binding affinity and rare TCEMs. PD-1/L1 expression in CD8 T cells was significantly lower in IGHV SHM than in SHM patients with activated B--like DLBCL, whereas PD-1 expression in CD4 T cells and PD-L1 expression in natural killer cells were higher in IGK/LV SHM than in SHM patients with GCB-DLBCL. PD-L1/L2 (9p24.1) amplification was associated with high IGHV SHM and ongoing SHM.These results show for the first time that IGV SHM and ongoing SHM have prognostic effects in DLBCL and potential implications for PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and neoantigen-based immunotherapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627733>Immunotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma: the complex interface between inflammation, fibrosis, and the  response.</a></h2><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide and confers a poor prognosis.

Many patients also have concomitant cirrhosis which is associated with both local and systemic  deficiency. Furthermore, the liver is an immunologic organ in itself, which may enhance or suppress the  response to cancer arising within it.

The overall incidence of renal  carcinoma appears to be increasing but death rates have been declining. Patients with poor risk, advanced disease have a two-year survival rate of approximately 7%. Prior to the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, and  inhibitors, IFN-α and high-dose IL-2, were standard of care treatment options but, conversely, their use is now limited to select patients. Immunotherapies have played a significant role in the treatment of various cancers and have continued to expand. It is of utmost importance that practitioners include  inhibitors as treatment options for renal  carcinoma as they mark a new era in the treatment of advanced or relapsed setting. Nivolumab, pembrolizumab, avelumab, ipilimumab, and atezolizumab all play a role in management of disease as either monotherapy or in combination with other agents.

With the aim of simultaneously improving both PDT-mediated intracellular ROS production and ICD levels, we designed a serum albumin (SA)-coated boehmite ("B"; aluminum hydroxide oxide) organic-inorganic scaffold that could be loaded with chlorin e6 (Ce6), a photosensitizer, and a honey bee venom melittin (MLT) peptide, denoted Ce6/MLT@SAB. Ce6/MLT@SAB was anchored by a boehmite nanorod structure and exhibited particle size of approximately 180 nm. Ce6/MLT@SAB could significantly reduce hemolysis relative to that of free MLT, while providing MLT-enhanced PDT antitumor effects . Compared with Ce6@SAB, Ce6/MLT@SAB improved Ce6 penetration of cancer cells both  and , thereby providing enhanced intracellular ROS generation with 660 nm light treatment. Following phototreatment, Ce6/MLT@SAB-treated cells displayed significantly improved levels of ICD and abilities to activate dendritic cells. In the absence of laser irradiation, multidose injection of Ce6/MLT@SAB could delay the growth of subcutaneous murine tumors by more than 60%, compared to controls. When combined with laser irradiation, a single injection and phototreatment with Ce6/MLT@SAB eradicated one-third of subcutaneous tumors in treated mice.

However, factors predicting the patient subtypes that are responsive to PD-1/PD-L1inhibitors have not been fully understood yet. Biomarkers, like PD-L1 expression, tumor mutational burden(TMB), DNA mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR), and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), have been utilized to select patients responsive to PD-1/PD-L1inhibitors in the clinic, but each of them has limited use. Lung adenocarcinoma patients with a mutation of TP53 or KRAS, particularly those with co-mutations of TP53 and KRAS, can benefit from anti-PD-1 treatment.In this study, the co-mutations of TP53 and KRAS in a 64-year-old non-smoking man with squamous- NSCLC patient was described using the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. The patient was treated with the pembrolizumab combined with gemcitabine as the salvage therapy, and a marked partial response could be attained, which had persisted for over 7 months.In addition to testing common driving genes, like EGFR, ALK, ROS1 and BRAF, both TP53, and KRAS should also be considered in advanced or metastatic squamous- NSCLC.TP53 and KRAS co-mutations in squamous- NSCLC can be a potential factor to assess possible response to PD-1 blockade immunotherapy, but further studies with more cases are needed to confirm the prediction power.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612562>Drug-induced sarcoidosis: an overview of the WHO pharmacovigilance database.</a></h2><p>There is a documented association between drug exposure and sarcoidosis-like reactions.

Proportion of T lymphocytes with CD69 or PD-1, memory T  marked with CD45RO, and number of Foxp3+ T regulatory cells (Tregs) were significantly higher in body fluid than those in blood of mGC. Proportion of CD8 T lymphocyte with memory marker (CD45RO) and activation marker (HLA-DR), CD3 T lymphocyte with PD-1, and number of FoxP3+ Tregs were identified as independent prognostic factors. When patients were classified by molecular subgroups of primary tumor, VEGF-A was significantly higher in genomically stable (GS)-like group than that in chromosomal instability (CIN)-like group while PD-L1 positive tumor cells (%) showed opposite results. Monitoring  dynamics using body fluid was also feasible.

In this study, we sought to understand the gene-expression signature of patients with primary prostate tumors by investigating the co-expression profiles of patient samples and their corresponding clinical outcomes, in particular "disease-free months" and "disease reoccurrence". We tested the hypothesis that the CXCL13-CXCR5 axis is co-expressed with factors supporting TIME and PCa progression. Gene expression counts, with clinical attributes from PCa patients, were acquired from TCGA. Profiles of PCa patients were used to identify key drivers that influence or regulate CXCL13-CXCR5 signaling.

Despite encouraging and sometimes durable responses in a subset of patients, most patients do not respond. Tumors have adopted the PD-1/PD-L1 axis for  escape to facilitate tumor growth, which can be leveraged as a potential target for   inhibitors. On this basis, PD-L1 protein expression on tumor or  cells emerged as the first potential predictive biomarker for sensitivity to   blockade. The goal of our study was to evaluate PD-L1 as a predictive biomarker based on all US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug approvals of   inhibitors. We evaluated the primary studies associated with 45 FDA drug approvals from 2011 until April 2019. In total, there were approvals across 15 tumor types. Across all approvals, PD-L1 was predictive in only 28.9% of cases, and was either not predictive (53.3%) or not tested (17.8%) in the remaining cases. There were 9 FDA approvals linked to a specific PD-L1 threshold and companion diagnostic: bladder cancer (N = 3), non-small  lung cancer (N = 3), triple-negative breast cancer (N = 1), cervical cancer (N = 1), and gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer (N = 1) with 8 of 9 (88.9%) with   inhibitor monotherapy. The PD-L1 thresholds were variable both within and across tumor types using several different assays, including approvals at the following PD-L1 thresholds: 1, 5, and 50%. PD-L1 expression was also measured in a variable fashion either on tumor cells, tumor-infiltrating  cells, or both. In conclusion, our findings indicate that PD-L1 expression as a predictive biomarker has limitations and that the decision to pursue testing must be carefully implemented for clinical decision-making.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627442>Verification of 5-Aminolevurinic Radiodynamic Therapy Using a Murine Melanoma Brain Metastasis Model.</a></h2><p>Melanoma is a highly aggressive cancer with a propensity for brain metastases. These can be treated by radiotherapy, but the radiation-resistant nature of melanoma makes the prognosis for melanoma patients with brain metastases poor. Previously, we demonstrated that treatment of mice with subcutaneous melanoma with 5-aminolevurinic acid (5-ALA) and X-rays in combination, ("radiodynamic therapy (RDT)"), instead of with 5-ALA and laser beams ("photodynamic therapy"), improved tumor suppression in vivo. Here, using the B16-Luc melanoma brain metastasis model, we demonstrate that 5-ALA RDT effectively treats brain metastasis. We also studied how 5-ALA RDT damages cells in vitro using a B16 melanoma culture.  culture preincubated with 5-ALA alone increased intracellular photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX. On X-ray irradiation, the cells enhanced their ∙OH radical generation, which subsequently induced γH2AX, a marker of DNA double-strand breaks in their nuclei, but decreased mitochondrial membrane potential.

So far, little is known about the clinical significance of B7-H3 expression in meningiomas. Thus, we conducted the present study to address this issue in a cohort of 242 patients from a single institution.Expression profiles of   proteins (PD-L1, B7-H3, LAG3, PD-1 and VISTA) were explored by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a meningioma test-cohort (n = 8). The roles of B7-H3 expression was further assessed in an expanded patient cohort (n = 234) using immunohistochemical tissue microarray analysis.B7-H3 expression was significantly greater than all   proteins studied in tested cohort. B7-H3 was detected with different degrees in all meningioma specimens, predominantly on tumor  membranes and in cytoplasm. The tumors were classified as B7-H3 high or low group pending on IHC histoscore (median histoscore = 111.06; range, 7.313-212.008). B7-H3 expression was statistically correlated with patient gender (p = .0297), tumor histopathological subtypes (p = .0262) and radiotherapy after surgery (p = .0028). However, no significant differences were observed in patient age, tumor location, grade and extent of resection between these two groups. Similarly, there was no significant difference in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) between patients of B7-H3 high or low group.Our study indicates variable expression and clinical role of B7-H3 in meningiomas, suggesting its potential as an immunotherapeutic target in the future.Copyright © 2019.

Immunotherapies such as those that target   molecules can be used to augment -mediated elimination of tumours and have resulted in durable responses in patients with cancer that did not respond to previous treatments. However, only a subset of patients benefit from immunotherapy and more knowledge about what is required for successful treatment is needed. Although the role of tumour neoantigen-specific CD8 T cells in tumour rejection is well established, the roles of other subsets of T cells have received less attention. Here we show that spontaneous and immunotherapy-induced anti-tumour responses require the activity of both tumour-antigen-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells, even in tumours that do not express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. In addition, the expression of MHC class II-restricted antigens by tumour cells is required at the site of successful rejection, indicating that activation of CD4 T cells must also occur in the tumour microenvironment. These findings suggest that MHC class II-restricted neoantigens have a key function in the anti-tumour response that is nonoverlapping with that of MHC class I-restricted neoantigens and therefore needs to be considered when identifying patients who will most benefit from immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634167>Global PD-L1 Signals and Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes: Markers of Immunogenicity in Different Subsets of Merkel  Carcinoma and Potential Therapeutic Implications.</a></h2><p>We previously studied the genetic and immunohistochemical profiles of subsets of Merkel  carcinoma (MCC) stratified by morphology and Merkel  polyomavirus (MCPyV) status.

The observed clinical responses to  inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway have not correlated with PD-L1 expression by MCC cells, and recent evidence suggests that functions of this pathway within the  tumor microenvironment may be relevant. We conducted a semiquantitative (high, moderate, and minimal) immunohistochemical evaluation of the global PD-L1 signal in 52 cases of MCC, segregated in 3 subsets [pure MCPyV-positive (n = 28), pure MCPyV-negative (n = 9), and combined MCPyV-negative (n = 15)]. TILS were categorized as brisk, nonbrisk, or absent. Intersubset comparisons revealed that high global PD-L1 signals were exclusively associated with pure MCPyV-positive MCCs contrasted with virus-negative cases (P = 0.0003). Moderate signals were seen across all 3 groups. Brisk TILS were significantly associated with MCPyV-positive MCCs compared with MCPyV-negative cases (P = 0.029). Neither parameter (PD-L1 or TILS) was significantly different between the MCPyV-negative groups. Of potential clinical relevance, MCPyV seems to convey greater immunogenicity to MCCs than the high mutational burden/greater neoantigen load of MCPyV-negative cases. Interesting too is the fact that subset-related profiles of these markers mirrored those noted at genetic and immunohistochemical levels, separating pure MCPyV-positive MCCs from the virus-negative subsets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623180>Relationship between Microsatellite Instability,  Cells Infiltration, and Expression of   Molecules in Ovarian Carcinoma: Immunotherapeutic Strategies for the Future.</a></h2><p>Ovarian cancer has the worst prognosis among gynecological cancers. Thus, new ovarian cancer treatment strategies are needed. Currently,   inhibitors such as anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody are attracting attention worldwide. The Food and Drug Administration approved the use of the PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab for solid cancers with microsatellite instability (MSI)-H or mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency in 2017. However, few studies on ovarian carcinoma have evaluated the relationship among MSI status, lymphocyte infiltration into the tumor, and the expression of   molecules by histologic type. We evaluated the expression of MMR proteins, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (CD8+), and   molecules (PD-L1/PD-1) by immunohistochemistry in 136 ovarian cancer patients (76, 13, 23, and 24 cases were high-grade serous, mucinous, endometrioid, and clear  carcinoma, respectively) to investigate the effectiveness of   inhibitors. Only six cases (4.4%) had loss of MMR protein expression. There was no significant relationship between MSI status and age ( = 0.496), FIGO stage ( = 0.357), initial treatment (primary debulking surgery [PDS] or neoadjuvant chemotherapy) ( = 0.419), residual tumor after PDS or interval debulking surgery ( = 0.202), and expression of CD8 ( = 0.126), PD-L1 ( = 0.432), and PD-1 ( = 0.653). These results suggest that only a small number of MSI cases in ovarian cancer can be effectively treated with   inhibitor monotherapy. Therefore, to improve the prognosis of ovarian carcinoma, a combination therapy of   inhibitors and other anticancer drugs is necessary.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660091>Immunomodulatory aspects in the progression and treatment of oral malignancy.</a></h2><p>Inflammation substantially affects the risk of oral malignancy. Pro-inflammatory cytokine, interferon (IFN)-γ, confers anti-tumor activity using several different mechanisms. Conversely, higher expression of interleukin (IL)-17 is associated with worse prognosis. Monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 correlates positively with poor long-term survival of head and neck squamous  carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. IL-1α affects cancer associated fibroblasts and macrophages, and promote several malignant phenotypes including  suppression. Some anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, relate to pro-tumoral activities. Among   modulators, programmed death (PD-)1 and PD-ligand (L)1 facilitate oral squamous  carcinoma (OSCC)  evasion from  surveillance, and the expression status of these has a prognostic value. OSCCs contain tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) as major stromal cells of their tumor microenvironment. Among the two distinctive states, M2 macrophages support tumor invasion, metastasis and  suppression. Crosstalk between TAMs and OSCC or cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) plays an important role in the progression of OSCC. Clinical trials with blocking antibodies against IL-1α or melanoma-associated antigens have been reported as therapeutic approaches against OSCCs. The most promising approach activating antitumor immunity is the blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 axis. Manipulating the polarization of pro-tumorigenic macrophages has been reported as a novel therapeutic approach.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646095>Blockade of ErbB2 and PD-L1 using a bispecific antibody to improve targeted anti-ErbB2 therapy.</a></h2><p>A significant proportion of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2/ErbB2)-positive metastatic breast cancer patients are refractory to Her2-targeted trastuzumab-like therapy. Some of this resistance has been attributed to the upregulation of   such as programmed  death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand, PD-L1 in Her2-positive breast cancer patients. Therefore, therapies targeting both the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction and oncogenic Her2 signaling are of significant clinical interest. Here, we constructed a mouse bispecific antibody targeting PD-L1 and rat Her2 (referred to as BsPD-L1xrErbB2) aiming to redirect the anti-PD-L1 response toward Her2-expressing tumor cells. BsPD-L1xrErbB2 demonstrated additive binding to interferon (IFN)-γ treated Her2 TUBO tumor cells, but it did not affect the proliferation of tumor cells . BsPD-L1xrErbB2 also blocked the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. This bispecific antibody was constructed with a mouse IgG2a Fc backbone and interacted with Fcγ receptors and resulted in complement deposition (C3). ADCC and complement action could be potential mechanisms of action of this molecule. BsPD-L1xrErbB2 successfully reduced TUBO tumor growth and increased tumor rejection rate compared to the monovalent anti-PD-L1, monovalent anti-ErbB2 or the combination of anti-PD-L1 and anti-ErbB2 monotherapies. The enhanced anti-tumor effect of BsPD-L1xrErbB2 was dependent on CD8 T lymphocytes and IFN-γ, as depletion of CD8 T lymphocytes and neutralization of IFN-γ completely abolished the antitumor activity of the bispecific antibody. Consistently, BsPD-L1xrErbB2 treatment also increased the frequency of intratumor CD8 T lymphocytes. Taken together, our data support a bispecific antibody approach to enhance the anti-tumor efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1  blockade in Her2-positive metastatic breast cancers.© 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612573>Immunotherapy: The end of the "dark age" for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer?</a></h2><p>The lack of effective therapies for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) highlights the need for the development of novel treatment strategies.

Currently, the increase of cancer therapies will involve new mechanisms such as cancer immunotherapies, also called   inhibitors (PD-1, PD-L1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors). These treatments have shown long-term remissions in subgroup of cancers, including melanomas, non-small- lung cancer, urothelial carcinoma, renal  carcinoma, squamous  carcinoma of the head and neck and colorectal cancer. Although these treatments will change the natural course of these cancers, they may sometimes induce cardiovascular complications, which has been reported as about 1 % in the literature. Currently, the physicians must keep in mind one uncommon but severe cardiac complication: auto- myocarditis. The clinical presentation may include various symptoms like chest pain, heart failure or rhythm disorders. In this situation, a baseline cardiologic check-up before starting cancer immunotherapy may be very helpful. Cardiac biomarkers (troponin and brain natriuretic peptide) and 12-lead resting electrocardiogram must be promptly performed when myocarditis is suspected. A cardiologist's opinion must be requested in emergency to discuss both a transthoracic echocardiography and the appropriate treatment (stopping immunotherapy, adding immunosuppressive treatment such as corticoids) and the monitoring in an intensive care unit. Cardiac MRI and endomyocardial biopsies may help to approach the final diagnosis. In this situation, other cancer therapies may be discussed.Copyright © 2019 Société Française du Cancer.

Compared with cytotoxic T lymphocytes, NK cells take a unique position targeting tumor cells that evade the host  surveillance by down-regulating self-antigen presentation. Recent findings highlighted that NK cells can even target cancer stem cells. The efficacy of allogeneic NK cells has been widely investigated in the treatment of hematologic malignancies. In solid tumors, both autologous and allogeneic NK cells have demonstrated potential efficacy. In allogeneic NK  therapy, the mismatch between the killer  immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) can be harnessed to increase the antitumor activity. However, the allogeneic NK cells cause more adverse events and can be rejected by the host  system after repeated injections. In this regard, the autologous NK  therapy is safer. This article reviews the published results of clinical trials and discusses strategies to enhance the efficacy of the NK  therapy. The difference in immunophenotype of the ex vivo expanded NK cells resulted from different culture methods may affect the final efficacy. Furthermore, currently available standard anticancer therapy, molecularly targeted agents, and  inhibitors may directly or indirectly enhance the efficacy of NK  therapy. A recent study discovered that NK  specific genetic defects are closely associated with the tumor  microenvironment that determines clinical outcomes. This finding warrants future investigations to find the implication of NK  specific genetic defects in cancer development and treatment, and NK  deficiency syndrome should be revisited to enhance our understanding. Overall, it is clear that NK  therapy is safe and promises a new paradigm for the treatment of solid tumors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612217>Engineering of a novel subnanomolar affinity fibronectin III domain binder targeting human programmed death-ligand 1.</a></h2><p>The programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a major  protein that helps cancer cells evade the  system. A non-invasive imaging agent with rapid clearance rate would be an ideal tool to predict and monitor the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy. The aim of this research was to engineer a subnanomolar, high-affinity fibronectin type 3 domain (FN3)-based small binder targeted against human PD-L1 (hPD-L1) present on tumor cells. A naive yeast G4 library containing the FN3 gene with three binding loop sequences was used to isolate high-affinity binders targeted to purified full-length hPD-L1. The selected binder clones displayed several mutations in the loop regions of the FN3 domain. One unique clone (FN3hPD-L1-01) with a 6x His-tag at the C-terminus had a protein yield of >5 mg/L and a protein mass of 12 kDa. In vitro binding assays on six different human cancer  lines (MDA-MB-231, DLD1, U87, 293 T, Raji and Jurkat) and murine CT26 colon carcinoma cells stably expressing hPD-L1 showed that CT26/hPD-L1 cells had the highest expression of hPD-L1 in both basal and IFN-γ-induced states, with a binding affinity of 2.38 ± 0.26 nM for FN3hPD-L1-01. The binding ability of FN3hPD-L1-01 was further confirmed by immunofluorescence staining on ex vivo CT26/hPD-L1 tumors sections. The FN3hPD-L1-01 binder represents a novel, small, high-affinity binder for imaging hPD-L1 expression on tumor cells and would aid in earlier imaging of tumors. Future clinical validation studies of the labeled FN3hPD-L1 binder(s) have the potential to monitor   inhibitors therapy and predict responders.© The Author(s) 2019.

Upregulation of PD-L1 in tumor cells contributes to malignancy through suppression of the T -mediated antitumor response. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), a glycolytic gate-keeping enzyme, is also known to promote tumor development. Here, we have uncovered a mechanism of regulation of PD-L1 by PDK1 through activation of c-Jun-NH-kinase (JNK)-c-Jun in ovarian cancer cells. Elevated PDK1 expression was correlated with that of PD-L1 in the TCGA ovarian cancer dataset and ovarian cancer tissue array. Overexpression of PDK1 in ovarian cancer cells impaired CD8 T  function by suppressing IFN-γ secretion through the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. Conversely, knockdown of PDK1 in ovarian cancer cells relieved suppression of CD8 T  function. CD8 T  apoptosis induced by binding of PD-1 with PD-L1 was increased after co-culture with ovarian cancer cells overexpressing PDK1, while depletion of PDK1 exerted the opposite effect.  experiments revealed synergistic improved overall survival and enhanced inhibition of tumor growth upon co-treatment with dichloroacetate (DCA), a PDK inhibitor, and PD-L1 antibody, accompanied by increased IFN-γ secretion by monocytes infiltrating tumor islets. Moreover, PDK1 expression and CD8 T  infiltration were inversely correlated in the ovarian cancer tissue array. Our collective findings provide a novel explanation of how PDK1 contributes to upregulation of PD-L1 in ovarian cancer and highlight its potential as a target therapeutic molecule that cooperates with the   blockade.© 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640814>Discovery of low-molecular weight anti-PD-L1 peptides for cancer immunotherapy.</a></h2><p>Immunotherapy using  inhibitors, especially PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, has now evolved into the most promising therapy for cancer patients. However, most of these inhibitors are monoclonal antibodies, and their large size may limit their tumor penetration, leading to suboptimal efficacy. As a result, there has been a growing interest in developing low-molecular-weight  inhibitors.We developed a novel biopanning strategy to discover small peptide-based anti-PD-L1 inhibitors. The affinity and specificity of the peptides to PD-L1 were examined using various assays. Three-dimensional (3D) spheroid penetration study was performed to determine the tumor penetration capability of the peptides. Anti-tumor activity of the peptides was evaluated in mice bearing CT26 tumor cells.We discover several anti-PD-L1 peptide inhibitors to block PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. The peptides exhibit high affinity and specificity to human PD-L1 protein as well as PD-L1-overexpressing human cancer cells MDA-MB-231 and DU-145. Molecular docking studies indicate that the peptide CLP002 specifically binds to PD-L1 at the residues where PD-L1 interacts with PD-1. The peptide also blocks the CD80/PD-L1 interaction, which may further enhance the  response of tumor-infiltrating T cells. Compared to antibody, the peptide CLP002 exhibits better tumor penetration in a 3D tumor spheroid model. The peptide CLP002 restores proliferation and prevents apoptosis of T cells that are co-cultured with cancer cells. The peptide CLP002 also inhibits tumor growth and increases survival of CT26 tumor-bearing mice.This study demonstrated the feasibility of using phage display to discover small peptide-based  inhibitors.

Vaccination against neoepitopes derived from patient tumor material can generate tumor-specific T  immunity, which could reinforce the efficacy of  inhibitor therapies such as anti-PD-1 treatment. DNA vaccination is a versatile platform that allows the inclusion of multiple neoantigen-coding sequences in a single formulation and therefore represents an ideal platform for neoantigen vaccination. We developed an anti-tumor vaccine based on a synthetic DNA vector designed to contain multiple cancer-specific epitopes in tandem. The DNA vector encoded a fusion gene consisting of three neoepitopes derived from the mouse colorectal tumor MC38 and their natural flanking sequences as 40 amino acid stretches. In addition, we incorporated as reporter epitopes the helper and CTL epitope sequences of ovalbumin. The poly-neoantigen DNA vaccine elicited T  responses to all three neoantigens and induced functional CD8 and CD4 T  responses to the reporter antigen ovalbumin after intradermal injection in mice. The DNA vaccine was effective in preventing outgrowth of B16 melanoma expressing ovalbumin in a prophylactic setting. Moreover, the combination of therapeutic DNA vaccination and anti-PD-1 treatment was synergistic in controlling MC38 tumor growth whereas individual treatments did not succeed. These data demonstrate the potential of DNA vaccination to target multiple neoepitopes in a single formulation and highlight the cooperation between vaccine-based and  blockade immunotherapies for the successful eradication of established tumors.© 2019 The Author(s).

Inducible T- co-stimulator ligand (ICOSLG) is a member of the B7 family of  regulatory ligands, expression of which in cancer is implicated in disease progression due to regulation of anti-tumor adaptive immunity. Although aberrant ICOSLG expression has been reported in glioma cells, the underlying mechanisms that promote glioblastoma (GBM) progression remain elusive.Here, we investigated a causal role for ICOSLG in GBM progression by analyzing ICOSLG expression in both human glioma tissues and patient-derived GBM sphere cells (GSCs). We further examined its  modulatory effects and the underlying molecular mechanisms.Bioinformatics analysis and GBM tissue microarray showed that upregulation of ICOSLG expression was associated with poor prognosis in patients with GBM. ICOSLG expression was upregulated preferentially in mesenchymal GSCs but not in proneural GSCs in a tumor necrosis factor-α-/NF-ĸB-dependent manner. Furthermore, ICOSLG expression by mesenchymal GSCs promoted expansion of T cells that produced interleukin-10. Knockdown of the gene encoding ICOSLG markedly reduced GBM tumor growth in  competent mice, with a concomitant downregulation of interleukin-10 levels in the tumor microenvironment.Inhibition of the ICOSLG-ICOS axis in GBM may provide a promising immunotherapeutic approach for suppressing a subset of GBM with an elevated mesenchymal signature.© The Author(s) 2019.

IFNa2b affects many  intrinsic features of tumor cells and modulates the host innate and cognate  responses. To better understand the biological traits associated with ulceration that could explain the efficacy of prophylactic type 1 IFN, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of various molecules (major histocompatibility complex class I and class II, MX Dynamin Like GTPase 1 (MX1), inducible Nitric-Oxide Synthase (iNOS) or CD47) in two retrospective cohorts of melanoma patients, one diagnosed with a primary cutaneous melanoma (1995-2013, N = 172, among whom 49% were ulcerated melanoma (UM)) and a second one diagnosed with metastatic melanoma amenable to lymph node resection (EORTC 18952 and 18991 trials, N = 98, among whom 44% were UM). We found that primary and metastatic UM exhibit higher basal expression of MHC class I molecules, independently of Breslow thickness, histology and lymphocytic infiltration compared with NUM and that primary UM harbored higher constitutive levels of the antiviral protein Mx1 at the border of tumor beds than NUM.

Programmed  death ligand 1(PD-L1), a member of the B7 family of molecules, plays a crucial role in tumor immunobiology. However, the prognostic significance of PD-L1 in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) patients remains controversial. This study aimed to inquire into the prognostic and clinicopathological significance of PD-L1 in CCA via a meta-analysis.  We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science and Google Scholar up to April 2019, regardless of the region or language, for studies on the correlation between clinicopathology/prognosis and PD-L1 in patients with CCA. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to investigate the prognostic significance of PD-L1 expression in cholangiocarcinoma. The odds ratios (ORs) were also determined to explore the association between PD-L1 expression and clinicopathological features.  Our meta-analysis included 11 studies with 1,066 patients. The meta-analysis of these studies indicated a trend that high PD-L1 expression indicated a poor OS, but the result was not statistically significant (HR = 1.62, 95% CI [0.98-2.68],  = 0.063). For DFS, although the pooled result is not statistically significant, it trends toward being significant that high PD-L1 expression indicated improved DFS (HR = 0.80, 95% CI [0.62, 1.04],  = 0.092). In subgroup analyses, the results were not consistent across the subgroups that were divided based on the publication year (before 2018: HR = 1.92, 95% CI [1.34-2.75],  < 0.001; after 2018: HR = 1.42, 95% CI [0.70-2.89],  = 0.335). Moreover, PD-L1 expression in TCs significantly correlated with the AJCC TNM stage of CCA (OR = 0.52, 95% CI [0.27, 0.99],  = 0.09).  Our meta-analyses revealed that PD-L1 expressed in TCs was significantly correlated with the AJCC TNM stage of CCA. Based on the included studies, we found that PD-L1 indeed expressed in both TCs and ICs in CCA patients, raising the possibility of the use of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy for CCA patients. In contrast, expression of PD-L1 did not seem to be associated with patient outcome in our study. The prognostic role of PD-L1 in CCA demands further investigation.Copyright © 2019 Xu, Sun, Li, Xie, Zhou, Yang, Du, Xu and Mao.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614774>NK -Fc Receptors Advance Tumor Immunotherapy.</a></h2><p>Immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of cancer patients.

The most common side effects of these agents are -mediated phenomena such as itching, skin rash, arthralgias, mild transaminitis and asymptomatic thyroid dysfunction. We describe herein a case of facial angioedema occurring 20 weeks after initiating adjuvant nivolumab therapy for melanoma. The patient had full resolution of symptoms with cessation of nivolumab and a short steroid course. As the causality of an association between nivolumab and angioedema seems legitimate, we expect further similar cases to surface in patients treated with   inhibitors. Prompt drug withdrawal and steroids are crucial to ensure favorable clinical outcomes in these patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636098>Macrophage derived CXCL9 and CXCL10 are required for anti-tumor  responses following   blockade.</a></h2><p>Response rates to   blockade (ICB; anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4) correlate with the extent of tumor  infiltrate but the mechanisms underlying the recruitment of T cells following therapy are poorly characterized. A greater understanding of these processes may see the development of therapeutic interventions that enhance T  recruitment and, consequently, improved patient outcomes. We therefore investigated the chemokines essential for   recruitment and subsequent therapeutic efficacy of these immunotherapies.The chemokines upregulated by dual PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade were assessed using nanosting-based analysis with results confirmed at the protein level by flow cytometry and cytometric bead array. Blocking/neutralizing antibodies confirmed the requirement for key chemokines/cytokines and  effector cells. Results were confirmed in patients treated with   inhibitors using single- RNAseq and paired survival analyses.The CXCR3 ligands, CXCL9 and CXCL10, were significantly upregulated following dual PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade and both CD8 T  infiltration and therapeutic efficacy were CXCR3 dependent. In both murine models and patients undergoing immunotherapy, macrophages were the predominant source of CXCL9 and their depletion abrogated CD8 T  infiltration and the therapeutic efficacy of dual   blockade. Single  RNA-seq analysis of patient TILs revealed that CXCL9/10/11 was predominantly expressed by macrophages following ICB and we identified a distinct macrophage signature that was associated with positive responses to   blockade.These data underline the fundamental importance of macrophage-derived CXCR3 ligands for the therapeutic efficacy of ICB and highlight the potential of manipulating this axis to enhance patient responses.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648585>Serum 5-S-cysteinyl-dopa levels as a predictive marker for the efficacy of nivolumab in advanced malignant melanoma.</a></h2><p>With the recent developments in novel molecular targeted therapy such as - blockades, serine/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf, and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitors, the prognosis of advanced malignant melanoma has been improving. 5-S-cysteinyl-dopa (5-S-CD), a precursor of pheomelanin, has been previously revealed to be a useful biomarker for advanced-stage malignant melanoma, especially in patients with distant metastases. Here, we aimed to assess and compare the utility of serum 5-S-CD and lactate dehydrogenase levels as markers for predicting the effects of nivolumab in advanced malignant melanoma.Baseline serum 5-S-CD and lactate dehydrogenase levels in patients with unresectable stage IIIC and IV malignant melanoma treated with nivolumab ( = 21) were analyzed to determine their utility as predictive markers for survival. We also analyzed the prognostic value of these markers among patients with only stage IV malignant melanoma ( = 17).Our analysis showed that patients with baseline serum 5-S-CD levels >25.0 nmol/L had significantly poor prognosis. In contrast, serum lactate dehydrogenase levels at the upper limit of the normal range did not exhibit such changes.Serum 5-S-CD levels have the potential to be an excellent predictive marker for the efficacy of nivolumab therapy in patients with advanced malignant melanoma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656546>Imaging of T-cells and their responses during anti-cancer immunotherapy.</a></h2><p>Immunotherapy has proven to be an effective approach in a growing number of cancers. Despite durable clinical responses achieved with antibodies targeting   molecules, many patients do not respond. The common denominator for immunotherapies that have successfully been introduced in the clinic is their potential to induce or enhance infiltration of cytotoxic T-cells into the tumour. However, in clinical research the molecules, cells and processes involved in effective responses during immunotherapy remain largely obscure. Therefore,  imaging technologies that interrogate T- responses in patients represent a powerful tool to boost further development of immunotherapy. This review comprises a comprehensive analysis of the  imaging technologies that allow the characterisation of T- responses induced by anti-cancer immunotherapy, with emphasis on technologies that are clinically available or have high translational potential.

The function of T cells usually decreased and even exhausted in severe TB such as multiple drug resistant TB (MDR-TB), which might lead to the failure of treatment in return. The mechanism of T  dysfunction in TB is still not clear. In this study we set up a mouse model of T  dysfunction by persistent  antigen stimulation and investigated the therapeutic role of interleukin 2 (IL-2) in it. C57BL/6 mice were primed with  Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and boosted repeatedly with a combination of  fusion proteins Mtb10.4-HspX (MH) plus ESAT6-Ag85B-MPT64 -Mtb8.4-Rv2626c (LT70) or MH plus ESAT6 and CFP10 with adjuvant of N, N'-dimethyl-N, N'-dioctadecylammonium bromide (DDA) plus polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C). Following persistent antigen stimulation, the mice were treated with IL-2 and the therapeutic effects were analyzed. The results showed that compared with the mice that received transient antigen stimulation (boost twice), persistent antigen stimulation (boost more than 10 times) resulted in decrease of antigen specific IFN-γ and IL-2 production, reduction of memory CD8 T cells, over-expression of   programmed  death protein 1 (PD-1), and impaired the protective immunity against bacterial challenge. Treating the T  functionally exhausted mice with IL-2 restored antigen-specific T  responses and protective efficacy. In conclusion, persistent stimulation with  antigens induced T  dysfunction, which could be restored by complement of IL-2.Copyright © 2019 Liu, Li, Niu, Ma, Chen, Zhang, Peng, Gan, Ma and Zhu.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656801>- inhibitors in brain metastases from renal  carcinoma: a battle was lost but not the war.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621445>The emerging use of   blockade in the adjuvant setting for solid tumors: a review.</a></h2><p>The use of   inhibitors has been approved in the advanced and metastatic setting for many types of solid tumors.

Eligibility criteria included histologically or citologically confirmed NSCLC, stage IIIB and IV, evaluable disease, sufficient organ function and at least one prior line of chemotherapy. The endpoints included Overall Response Rate (ORR), Disease Control Rate (DCR), Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS). Safety analysis was performed with the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0, and -related Adverse Events (irAEs) were treated according to protocol treatment guidelines. Tumour response was assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1. Data was analysed using SPSS, version 21.0 (IBM Statistics).From June 2015 to December 2016, a total of 229 patients with advanced NSCLC were enrolled at 30 Portuguese centres. Clinical data were collected up to the end of July 2018. The baseline median age was 64 years (range 37-83) and the majority of patients were males (70.3%) and former/current smokers (69.4%). Patients with non-squamous histology predominated (88.1%), and 67.6% of the patients had received 2 or more prior lines of chemotherapy. Out of 229 patients, data was available for 219 patients (3 patients did not start treatment, while data was unavailable in 7 patients); of the 219 patients, 15.5% were not evaluated for radiological tumour assessment, 1.4% had complete response (CR), 21% partial response (PR), 31% stable disease (SD) and 31.1% progressive disease (PD). Thus, the ORR was 22.4% and DCR was 53.4% in this population. At the time of survival analysis the median PFS was 4.91 months (95% CI, 3.89-6.11) and median OS was 13.21 months (95% CI, 9.89-16.53).

Tumor microenvironment (TME)  phenotypes play crucial roles in predicting clinical outcomes and therapeutic efficacy.  In this study, we depict the  landscape of IDC by using transcriptome profiling and clinical characteristics retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data portal.   infiltration was evaluated via single-sample gene set enrichment (ssGSEA) analysis and systematically correlated with genomic characteristics and clinicopathological features of IDC patients. Furthermore, an  signature was constructed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression algorithm. A random forest algorithm was applied to identify the most important somatic gene mutations associated with the constructed  signature. A nomogram that integrated clinicopathological features with the  signature to predict survival probability was constructed by multivariate Cox regression.  The IDC were clustered into low  infiltration, intermediate  infiltration, and high  infiltration by the  landscape. The high infiltration group had a favorable survival probability compared with that of the low infiltration group. The low-risk score subtype identified by the  signature was characterized by T -mediated  activation. Additionally, activation of the interferon-α response, interferon-γ response, and TNF-α signaling via the NFκB pathway was observed in the low-risk score subtype, which indicated T  activation and may be responsible for significantly favorable outcomes in IDC patients. A random forest algorithm identified the most important somatic gene mutations associated with the constructed  signature. Furthermore, a nomogram that integrated clinicopathological features with the  signature to predict survival probability was constructed, revealing that the  signature was an independent prognostic biomarker. Finally, the relationship of VEGFA, PD1, PDL-1, and CTLA-4 expression with the  infiltration landscape and the  signature was analyzed to interpret the responses of IDC patients to immunotherapy.  Taken together, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of the  landscape of IDC and constructed an  signature related to the  landscape. This analysis of TME  infiltration landscape has shed light on how IDC respond to immunotherapy and may guide the development of novel drug combination strategies.Copyright © 2019 Bao, Shi, Zhang, Xin, Li, Zhao and Wang.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651559>Combination Therapy of Ipilimumab and Nivolumab-associated Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) in a Patient With Metastatic Melanoma: A Case Report and Literature Review.</a></h2><p>Ipilimumab and nivolumab are   inhibitors used in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. The authors report the case of a 62-year-old white male individual with metastatic choroidal melanoma who had commenced adjuvant systemic treatment with combination  inhibitor therapy of intravenous ipilimumab (anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4) and nivolumab (anti-programmed  death-1) at 3-week  intervals. On day 4 after the second , he developed an acute widespread rash. On examination there was confluent erythema with bullae and epidermal loss over 60% of the body surface area, with severe oral mucosal ulceration. A clinical diagnosis of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) was made and he was transferred to the intensive care unit. Despite active treatment, he deteriorated systemically and died from multiorgan failure. This is the first reported case of TEN associated with nivolumab and ipilimumab dual therapy for metastatic uveal melanoma. Monotherapy improves survival in metastatic melanoma, but dual therapy has shown a greater mortality benefit at 3 years. Although the literature demonstrates case reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and TEN in association with nivolumab, ipilimumab has generally been regarded as a "safe" treatment with regard to severe cutaneous adverse reactions. With the increased use of immunotherapies, it is important to plan the management and early recognition of drug-related skin toxicity. This is of greatest concern during treatment initiation and with the higher risk associated with combination therapy. Reporting of adverse events and infrequently encountered complications with systemic biologic treatments will augment pharmacovigilance and improve the stratification of patients to treatments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659111>The Activity of   Inhibition in KRAS Mutated Non-small  Lung Cancer: A Single Centre Experience.</a></h2><p>KRAS mutation is the most frequent molecular alteration found in advanced non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC). It is associated with a poor prognosis without available targeted therapy. Treatment options for NSCLC have been recently enriched by the development of   inhibitors (ICIs), and data about their efficacy in patients with KRAS-mutant NSCLC are discordant. This study assessed the routine efficacy of ICIs in advanced KRAS-mutant NSCLC.All stage IV NSCLC patients treated in our institution from January 2016 to December 2017 with immunotherapy were included in our analysis. We collected the status of KRAS and other mutations, as well as the type of ICI administered. We assessed four clinical outcomes: i) disease control rate (DCR), ii) partial response (PR), iii) progression-free survival (PFS) and iv) overall survival (OS).A total of 45 patients were initially identified but 7 were excluded due to insufficient clinical data, so 38 were included in the end. In the KRAS wild-type cohort, the DCR was 59% with 49% PR, while the PFS was 8.4 months and OS 16.8 months. Among KRAS mutated patients, results were more favourable, the DCR was 81%, with 62% PR. PFS was 13.6 months and OS was 18.5 months. The median follow-up was 24 months (17 to 34 months) and 7 patients were still on treatment at the time of analysis.Our data suggest that KRAS mutation is predictive of a superior response to immunotherapy. Furthermore, the lack of response of STK11 and KRAS co-mutated NSCLC patients to ICIs, is indeed negated by an additional TP53 mutation.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

In this study, we aim to pinpoint the metabolic pathway altered and assess its therapeutic potential.In silico reproduction of TCGA ovarian cancer dataset and functional annotation using GSEA was performed. Candidate metabolic pathway was validated using in vitro and in vivo assays.From TCGA database, we found that polyamine metabolism was significantly enriched in Cyclin E1-driven OvCa. Expressions of SMS, SRM, and ODC1 were positively correlated with that of CCNE1, respectively. ODC1 and SMS expressions were significantly correlated with decreased  infiltrates. PGC-1α silencing significantly decreased invasion and migration in both OvCa  lines. Both spermidine and spermine levels were significantly increased when PGC-1α was silenced. Targeting SRM significantly decreased spermine level in OVCAR3 cells, which was rescued when PGC-1α was silenced. Silencing of PGC-1α resulted in increased SRM in both OvCa cells. Dinaciclib significantly decreased invasion and migration of OVCAR3 cells. Expressions of PD-L1 and PD-L2 were predominantly in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Dinaciclib showed no notable effect of PD-1 yet substantially induced the increased levels of PD-L1 and PD-L2.Cyclin E1-driven OvCa is characterized with activated polyamine synthesis, which is associated with decreased cancer immunity.

Therefore, despite the significant therapeutic efficacy of monoclonal antibodies to  check-point(s) across a wide range of tumor types, patients with brain disease were invariably excluded from clinical trials with these agents. Recent insights on the  landscape of the central nervous system, as well as of the brain tumor microenvironment, are shedding light on the -biology of brain metastases.Interestingly, retrospective analyses, case series, and initial prospective clinical trials have recently investigated the role of different  check-point inhibitors in brain metastases, reporting a significant clinical activity also in this subset of patients. These findings, and their swift translation in the daily practice, are driving fundamental changes in the clinical management of patients with brain metastases, and raise important neuroradiologic challenges. Along this line, neuro-oncology undoubtedly represents an additional area of active investigation and of growing interest to support medical oncologists in the evaluation of clinical responses of brain metastases to ICI treatment, and in the management of neurologic -related adverse events.Aim of this review is to summarize the most recent findings on brain metastases immunobiology, on the evolving scenario of clinical efficacy of ICI therapy in patients with brain metastases, as well as on the increasing relevance of neuroradiology in this therapeutic setting.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639551>  protein and cytokine expression by T lymphocytes in pleural effusion of cancer patients receiving anti-PD-1 therapy.</a></h2><p>Pleural effusion (PE) occasionally develops in cancer patients during treatment with antibodies to programmed  death-1 (PD-1) or to its ligand PD-L1 (hereafter, αPD-1 therapy). Such effusion often contains infiltrated mononuclear cells, although the types of   present as well as the outcome of such patients have remained unclear.We performed a multi-institutional, observational study to examine the clinical outcome of patients who develop PE after the onset of αPD-1 therapy. We compared the   profiles and the  status of lymphocytes in PE as determined by flow cytometry between nine patients who developed effusion during αPD-1 therapy (αPD-1 group) and 15 patients who developed PE during treatment with other anticancer agents (control group).Most mononuclear cells in PE were lymphocytes in both the αPD-1 and control groups. The frequency of both CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes expressing the   proteins TIM-3 or TIGIT as well as that of CD8 T lymphocytes expressing PD-L1 were increased in the αPD-1 group compared with the control group. αPD-1 therapy continued for a substantial period after the emergence of PE in six of the nine patients in the αPD-1 group, and the frequency of CD4 T lymphocytes in PE expressing the   protein LAG-3 or the cytokine interkeukin-17 was lower for these patients than for those who did not receive a sustained treatment benefit.Our results suggest a clinical benefit of continuing αPD-1 therapy in some patients who develop PE. We found that infiltrating T lymphocytes in PE manifest a more exhausted phenotype during αPD-1 therapy than during treatment with other cancer drugs, with subpopulations of these cells characterized by specific   protein and cytokine expression profiles possibly contributing to the antitumor  response.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Foremost among these successful immunotherapies are monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) which target   inhibitor (ICI) molecules, most prominently cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein (CTLA-4) and programmed  death protein-1 (PD-1) and its major ligand, PD-L1. These immunotherapeutic agents are, however, often associated with the occurrence of -mediated toxicities known as -related adverse events (IRAEs). The incidence of severe toxicities increases substantially when these agents are used together, particularly with CTLA-4 in combination with PD-1 or PD-L1 antagonists. Accordingly, dissociating the beneficial anti-tumor therapeutic activity of these agents from the emergence of IRAEs represents a significant challenge to attaining the optimum efficacy of ICI-targeted immunotherapy of cancer. This situation is compounded by an increasing awareness, possibly unsurprising, that both the beneficial and harmful effects of ICI-targeted therapies appear to result from an over-reactive  system. Nevertheless, this challenge may not be insurmountable. This contention is based on acquisition of recent insights into the role of the gut microbiome and its products as determinants of the efficacy of ICI-targeted immunotherapy, as well as an increasing realization of the enigmatic involvement of Th17 cells in both anti-tumor activity and the pathogenesis of some types of IRAEs. Evidence linking the beneficial and harmful activities of ICI-targeted immunotherapy, recent mechanistic insights focusing on the gut microbiome and Th17 cells, as well as strategies to attenuate IRAEs in the setting of retention of therapeutic activity, therefore represent the major thrusts of this review.Copyright © 2019 Anderson, Theron and Rapoport.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648568>Updates and advancements in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma patients after hepatectomy.</a></h2><p>: The 5-year recurrence rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after hepatic resection or local ablation is up to 70%.

We performed genomic and immunohistochemical profiling of tumors from eight patients who have completed multiple rounds of neoadjuvant trastuzumabb to identify predictive biomarkers for trastuzumab-elicited tumor  responses. Immunohistochemistry showed that all tumors had an activated tumor  microenvironment positive for nuclear NF-κB/p65RelA, CD4, and CD8 T  markers, but only four out of eight tumors were positive for the PD-1   molecule, which is indicative of an exhausted  environment. Exome sequencing showed no specific driver mutations correlating with PD-1 positivity. Hierarchical clustering of the RNA sequencing data revealed two distinct groups, of which Group 2 represented the PD-1 positive tumors. A gene expression signature that was derived from this clustering composed of 89 genes stratified HER2+ breast cancer patients in the TCGA dataset and it was named PD-1-Associated Gene Expression Signature in HER2+ Breast Cancer (PAGES-HBC). Patients with the Group 2 PAGES-HBC composition had significantly more favorable survival outcomes with mortality reduced by 83% (hazard ratio 0.17; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.60;  = 0.011). Analysis of three longitudinal samples from a single patient showed that PAGES-HBC might be transiently induced by trastuzumab, independent of clonal tumor expansion over time. We conclude that PAGES-HBC could be further developed as a prognostic predictor of trastuzumab response in HER2+ breast cancer patients and be potentially used as an alternative biomarker for anti-PD-1 therapy trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612048>PD-L1 expression levels on tumor cells affect their immunosuppressive activity.</a></h2><p>Programmed  death 1 (PD-1) is an immuno- receptor which is primarily expressed on T cells, monocytes, natural killer cells and macrophages. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is the primary ligand of PD-1 and is constitutively expressed on antigen presenting cells, mesenchymal stem cells and bone marrow-derived mast cells. In addition, PD-L1 is also expressed on a wide range of tumor cells, including lung cancer, breast cancer and melanoma. PD-1 and PD-L1 are important members of the immunoglobulin super-family and participate in  regulation. In the present study, the -suppressive effects of a number of tumor  lines were determined. The breast tumor  lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 displayed the largest inhibitory effects on T- activation and cytokine secretion in a co-culture system. The HepG2, A549 and A375 cells displayed limited inhibitory effects. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells expressed the highest level of PD-L1 among the cells used, which may explain their higher immuno-suppressive effects. Compound A0-L, a small molecule inhibitor of the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction, restored T  functions. Additionally, it was demonstrated that the tumor cells with higher levels of PD-L1 expression suppressed signaling pathways involved in T- activation, such as the T- receptor- zeta chain of T  receptor associated protein kinase ZAP70-RAS-GTPase-extracellular-signal-regulated kinases and CD28-PI3K-Akt serine/threonine kinases pathways. These findings suggest that tumor cells with higher expression levels of PD-L1 may exhibit higher immuno-suppressive activity, and that drugs targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction may have improved therapeutic effects on tumors expressing higher levels of PD-L1.Copyright: © Zheng et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645892>Treatment effect and safety profile of salvage chemotherapy following   inhibitors in lung cancer.</a></h2><p>To assess the relationship of treatment effects between   inhibitor (ICI) and salvage chemotherapy, with the safety profile of salvage chemotherapy.18 patients with advanced NSCLC treated using salvage chemotherapy following ICI treatment were retrospectively included. We assessed the overall response rate to and adverse events of salvage chemotherapy.The overall response rate to salvage chemotherapy was 33.3% and that of ICI responders was significantly higher than that of ICI nonresponders (66.7 vs 16.7%, respectively, p = 0.03).

PD-1/PD-L1  inhibitors have emerged as a promising treatment strategy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, only a minority of HCC patients benefit from this therapy. To find a niche for   inhibition in HCC patients, future strategies might require predictive factor-based patient selection, to identify patients who are likely to respond to the said therapy and combination strategies in order to enhance anti-tumor efficacy and clinical success.

However, treatment with ICIs is often accompanied by -related adverse events (irAEs), and a clear understanding of the precise indications and management of irAEs is important for harnessing the full potential of these agents. While skin- or gastrointestinal-associated irAEs have been relatively well studied, there are few reports regarding nivolumab-induced cholangitis. We retrospectively reviewed data from patients with advanced or recurrent non-small  lung cancer who were treated with nivolumab between December 2015 and December 2018 at Tottori University in Japan. Among the 59 patients, we identified four patients who experienced nivolumab-induced cholangitis. Of these four patients, stable disease (SD) was observed in two patients (50%), while partial response (PR) was achieved in two patients (50%) under nivolumab treatment. Patients were treated with corticosteroid alone (n=2) or in combination with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (n=2); these treatments resulted in improvements in nivolumab-induced cholangitis in three patients. In conclusion, the present retrospective study identified four cases of nivolumab-induced cholangitis. The combination of corticosteroid and MMF was effective in two cases with grade 4 nivolumab-induced cholangitis. Further reports are needed to establish the optimal management of patients with this irAE.Copyright: © Izumi et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627742>Pericardial effusion under nivolumab: case-reports and review of the literature.</a></h2><p>Nivolumab, a programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor, is an   inhibitor particularly used in the treatment of malignant melanoma, non-small  lung cancer and renal  carcinoma. -related adverse events are frequent under immunotherapies. Cardiotoxic side effects, initially thought to be rare, are more often encountered paralleling the expanding use of   blockade. Among them, pericardial effusion and tamponade deserve attention as they may present with unusual symptomatology.We report three cases of pericardial effusion under nivolumab for lung adenocarcinoma. Two cases of early and late-onset pericardial effusion were symptomatic with tamponade and one case occurred without any symptoms. Pericardiocentesis with pericardial biopsy was performed in symptomatic pericardial effusion followed by the administration of a corticotherapy. Pericardial biopsies showed infiltration of T-lymphocytes, mostly CD4. Nivolumab was stopped in two cases and resumed for one patient. Pericardial effusion evolved positively in all cases with or without treatment.We review the literature on pericardial effusion under nivolumab to further discuss the hallmarks of pericardial effusion under nivolumab and the management of nivolumab therapy in this situation. In conclusion, pericardial effusion as an -related adverse event under nivolumab appears less rare than initially thought and may require particular attention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631122>[Current Topics of Cancer Antigen].</a></h2><p>Cancer antigens are classified into shared antigens and tumor-specific antigens based on their expression pattern or immunogenicity. Neo-antigens are defined as a subset of tumor-specific antigens generated by non-synonymous mutations, Indel gene mutation or gene fusions, presented by major histocompatibility complex molecules that were recognized by effector CD8+ T cells. Cancer cells with inherent genetic instability form abnormal proteins that have not been previously recognized by the  system and these proteins become highly immunogenic antigens(neo-antigens)that can spontaneously trigger CD8+ T  responses. Cancer cells that present extremely immunogenic neo-antigens are eliminated from the host through the process of carcinogenesis. Therefore, recognition of neo-antigens could be an important subject of the clinical utility of both neo-antigen cancer vaccine and adoptive TCR-T  therapy as cancer immunotherapies. Furthermore, monitoring the quantity and quality of the neo-antigen derived in each patient could deduce the clinical response to   inhibitors such as anti-PD-1 therapy in various cancers. Here we review the evidence for the relevance of tumor neo-antigens and host  response. We discuss the utility as a biomarker for cancer immunotherapy using the neoantigen expression in tumor tissues and the development of neo-antigen-targeted cancer vaccine and T  mediated therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616210>Principles of prophylactic and therapeutic management of skin toxicity during treatment with  inhibitors.</a></h2><p>The introduction of immunotherapy into the treatment of cancer patients has revolutionised the oncological approach and significantly improved patient survival. The key drugs are   inhibitors (CPIs), whose mechanism of action is to elicit  response against cancer  antigens. Three types of CPIs are currently used and approved: an anti-CTLA-4 antibody, ipilimumab; anti-PD-1 antibodies, nivolumab and pembrolizumab; and anti-PD-L1 antibodies: atezolizumab, avelumab and durvalumab. CPIs have been widely used in metastatic and adjuvant melanoma settings, metastatic lung cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, renal cancer, bladder cancer, head and neck tumours, and Merkel  carcinoma. However, side effects of CPIs differ from toxicities of other oncological drugs. According to literature data, in 10-30% of patients CPIs are responsible for -related adverse events (irAE) associated with excessive activation of the  system. Systemic irAEs include enterocolitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, nephritis, hypophysitis, and autoimmune thyroid disease. However, the most common irAEs of  inhibitors are dermatologic toxicities ranging from pruritus and mild dermatoses to severe reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Each irAE can become serious if not early diagnosed and appropriately treated. In the article we present different types of skin irAEs related to CPIs together with the recommended therapies.Copyright: © 2019 Termedia Sp. z o. o.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653980> subtyping of extranodal NK/T- lymphoma: a new biomarker and an  shift during disease progression.</a></h2><p>Extranodal NK/T- lymphoma is an aggressive lymphoma that is strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection. Although some extranodal NK/T- lymphoma patients have shown responses to   blockade, biomarkers for predicting extranodal NK/T- lymphoma patient response to immunotherapy have not yet been defined. To understand the tumor  microenvironment, we analyzed the expression of 579 -related genes and characterized the  cells using immunohistochemistries and in situ hybridization for EBER. Based on comprehensive analyses, we developed an  subtyping model that classifies extranodal NK/T- lymphoma patients into four tumor  microenvironment subgroups using three immunohistochemical markers (FoxP3, PD-L1, and CD68). The four tumor  microenvironment subgroups were named  tolerance,  evasion-A,  evasion-B, and  silenced. The  tolerance group was characterized by high-Treg counts and was frequently observed in early stage, and nasal extranodal NK/T- lymphoma. The  evasion group showed high cytotoxic T- counts and high PD-L1 expression but low Treg counts. In the -silenced group, almost all  responses were exhausted, most patients were at an advanced stage, and had the poorest disease prognosis among the tumor  microenvironment subgroups. In some patients (n = 3), a shift in the tumor  microenvironment subgroup classification was observed in sequential biopsies. The response rate to pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, was 100% (1/1) in the  tolerance group, 60% (3/5) in the  evasion group, and 0% (0/5) in the -silenced group. We classified extranodal NK/T- lymphoma into four tumor  microenvironment subgroups using a new classification system. In conclusion, we propose that the tumor  microenvironment of extranodal NK/T- lymphoma may change during disease progression and may serve as a useful biomarker for immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652644>MPT0G612, a Novel HDAC6 Inhibitor, Induces Apoptosis and Suppresses IFN-γ-Induced Programmed Death-Ligand 1 in Human Colorectal Carcinoma Cells.</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer-associated death worldwide. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) have been implicated in regulating complex cellular mechanisms to influence tumor biology and immunogenicity in various types of cancer. The potential of selective inhibition of HDAC6 has been widely discussed for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. We previously identified that MPT0G612 is a novel HDAC6 inhibitor exhibiting a promising antitumor activity against several solid tumors. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility and pharmacological mechanisms of MPT0G612 as a potential therapy for CRC patients. Results revealed that MPT0G612 significantly suppresses the proliferation and viability, as well as induces apoptosis in CRC cells. Autophagy activation with LC3B-II formation and p62 degradation was observed, and the inhibition of autophagy by pharmacological inhibitor or Atg5 knockdown enhances MPT0G612-induced  death. In addition, HDAC6 knockdown reduces MPT0G612-mediated autophagy and further potentiates apoptotic  death. Furthermore, MPT0G612 downregulates the expression of PD-L1 induced by IFN-γ in CRC cells. These results suggest that MPT0G612 is a potent  death inducer through inhibiting HDAC6-associated pathway, and a potential agent for combination strategy with   inhibitors for the treatment of CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635973>  inhibitors: For how long do we need to release the brakes to achieve the optimum acceleration of -mediated anti-tumor response?</a></h2><p>In recent years, cancer immunotherapy has emerged as the fourth pillar of cancer therapy alongside surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

After the first indication of melanoma, an increasing list of additional cancer types are now treated with  system targeting antibodies to PD-1, PD-L1 and CTLA-4, alleviating inhibition signals on T cells. Recently, we published proof-of-concept results on a novel  inhibitor, NKG2A. This receptor is expressed on cytotoxic lymphocytes, including NK cells and subsets of activated CD8 T cells. Blocking antibodies to NKG2A unleashed the reactivity of these effector cells resulting in tumor control in multiple mouse models and an early clinical trial. Monalizumab is inhibiting this  in human beings and future clinical trials will have to reveal its potency in combination with other cancer treatment options.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652269>Monitoring and characterizing soluble and membrane-bound ectonucleotidases CD73 and CD39.</a></h2><p>The success of immunotherapy treatment in oncology ushered a new modality for treating a wide variety of cancers. However, lack of effect in some patients made it imperative to identify other pathways that are exploited by cancer cells to circumvent  surveillance, and possibly synergize   treatment in those cases. It has been recently recognized that adenosine levels increase significantly in the tumor microenvironment and that adenosine/adenosine receptors play a powerful role as immunosuppressive and attenuating several effector T  functions. The two main enzymes responsible for generating adenosine in the microenvironment are the ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73, the former utilizes both ATP and ADP and produces AMP while the latter utilizes AMP and generates adenosine. Thus, these two enzymes combined are the major source for the bulk of adenosine produced in the microenvironment. They were shown to be validated targets in oncology leading to several clinical trials that include small molecules as well as antibodies, showing positive and encouraging results in the preclinical arena. Towards the development of novel drugs to target these enzymes, we have developed a platform that can be utilized to monitor the activities of both enzymes in vitro (biochemical) as well as in cells ( based) assays. We have developed very sensitive and homogenous assays that enabled us to monitor the activity of both enzymes and demonstrate selectivity of known inhibitors as well as monoclonal antibodies. This should speed up screening for novel inhibitors that might lead to more effective cancer therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628506>[Erratum to: Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like uveitis under   inhibitor treatment for metastasized malignant melanoma].</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656782>Biomarkers in metastatic renal  carcinoma in the era of   inhibitors.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612329>Perioperative chemotherapy for locally advanced gastric cancer in Japan: current and future perspectives.</a></h2><p>The standard treatment for locally advanced gastric cancer differs across the world.

In Japan, adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 is the standard treatment for pStage II gastric cancer, whereas adjuvant chemotherapy with a doublet regimen is preferred for pStage III gastric cancer. The efficacy of preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy using S-1 plus cisplatin, has been investigated in selected patients with expected poor survival outcomes. To expand the indications for neoadjuvant chemotherapy, a clinical trial investigating the efficacy of preoperative S-1 plus oxaliplatin in patients with cStage III (cT3-4N1-3) gastric cancer (JCOG1509) is ongoing in Japan. The addition of   inhibitors to cytotoxic chemotherapy also seems promising and is being investigated in international randomized clinical trials.

Nearly 80% of the lower-grade gliomas and secondary glioblastomas harbor recurrent mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (). Mutant IDH generates high levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) that inhibit various components of the epigenetic machinery, including histone and DNA demethylases. The encouraging results from current epigenetic therapies in hematological malignancies have reinvigorated the interest in solid tumors and gliomas, both preclinically and clinically. Here, we summarize the recent advancements in epigenetic therapy for lower-grade gliomas and discuss the challenges associated with current treatment options. A particular focus is placed on therapeutic mechanisms underlying favorable outcome with epigenetic-based drugs in basic and translational research of gliomas. This review also highlights emerging bridges to combination treatment with respect to epigenetic drugs. Given that epigenetic therapies, particularly DNA methylation inhibitors, increase tumor immunogenicity and antitumor  responses, appropriate drug combinations with   inhibitors may lead to improvement of treatment effectiveness of immunotherapy, ultimately leading to tumor  eradication.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648184>  inhibitor-associated thyroid dysfunction: a disproportionality analysis using the WHO adverse drug reaction database VigiBase.</a></h2><p>Our study aimed to identify and characterize thyroid dysfunctions associated with immume  inhibitors (ICIs).Data were obtained from VigiBase, between January 1, 2011 to March 6, 2019.All thyroid drug-adverse events are classified by group queries according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Information component (IC) and reporting odds ratio (ROR) were considered as measures of disproportionality for the assessment of association between ICIs and thyroid dysfunctions. We used IC to identify meaningful drug-adverse events while using ROR to compare differences in the reporting of drug-adverse events caused by different ICI subgroups. Positive IC values are deemed significant.Compared with the full database, the following ICI-associated thyroid dysfunctions were over-reported: hypothyroidism (1125 reports for ICIs vs 12495 for all drugs; Information Component 4.28 [95% CI 4.18-4.35]), hyperthyroidism (926 vs 7538; 4.66 [95% CI 4.55-4.74]), thyroiditis (294 vs 1237; 5.40 [95% CI 5.21-5.54]), thyrotoxic crisis (11 vs 288; 3.55 [95% CI 2.61-4.20]). Hypothyroidism was over-reported for patients treated with ICI combination therapy versus those treated with ICI monotherapy (ROR 1.3 [95% CI 1.1-1.7]), and the same was observed for hyperthyroidism (ROR 1.9 [95% CI 1.5-2.4]), thyroiditis (ROR 3.3 [95% CI 2.3-4.8]), thyrotoxic crisis (ROR 11.5 [95% CI 2.4-53.8]).

The PD-L1 expression in tumor cells as detected by immunohistochemistry is a predictive biomarker in some solid tumors, but appears insufficient as prognostic or predictive factor of response to ICIs in metastatic melanomas.We investigated whether the presence and the features of pretreatment CD8+ tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs) could be a complementary prognostic or predictive biomarker in patients with metastatic melanoma.In this retrospective study, we evaluated the association of PD-L1 expression ≥5% of tumor cells combined with TILs features (CD8, CD28, Ki67) with the overall survival (OS) among 51 patients treated with ICIs and 54 patients treated with other treatment options (non-ICIs).PD-L1 positivity was observed in 33% and 39% of primary melanomas and matched metastases, respectively, with, however, poor concordance between the primary and the matched metastatic site (κ=0.283). No significant association was noted between PD-L1 expression and CD8+TILs profile analyzed as single markers and OS or response to immunotherapy. Instead, their combined analysis in primary melanoma samples showed that the PD-L1-/CD8+ status was significantly associated with prolonged OS in the whole population (P=0.04) and in the subgroup treated with non-ICIs (P=0.009). Conversely, the PD-L1+/CD8+ status was a good prognostic factor in patients treated with ICIs (P=0.022), whereas was significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients treated with non-ICIs (P=0.014). While the expression of CD28 was not related to outcome, the Ki67 expression was significantly associated to poor OS in the subgroup CD8+TIL+/PD-L1- (P=0.02).The pre-treatment combination of PD-L1 expression with the level of CD8+TILs could better assess OS and predict therapeutic response of patients with metastatic melanoma treated either by immunotherapy or other treatments regimens.© 2019 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.</p></html>
