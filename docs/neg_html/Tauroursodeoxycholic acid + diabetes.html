ER stress induces the unfolded protein response, which involves activation of three transmembrane receptors, ATF6, PERK and IRE1α. Once activated, IRE1α recruits TRAF2 to the ER membrane to initiate inflammatory responses via the NF-κB pathway. Inflammation is commonly triggered when pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors or nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors, detect tissue damage or microbial infection. However, it is not clear which PRRs have a major role in inducing inflammation during ER stress. Here we show that NOD1 and NOD2, two members of the NOD-like receptor family of PRRs, are important mediators of ER-stress-induced inflammation in mouse and human cells. The ER stress inducers thapsigargin and dithiothreitol trigger production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in a NOD1/2-dependent fashion. Inflammation and IL-6 production triggered by infection with Brucella abortus, which induces ER stress by injecting the type IV secretion system effector protein VceC into host cells, is TRAF2, NOD1/2 and RIP2-dependent and can be reduced by treatment with the ER stress inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholate or an IRE1α kinase inhibitor. The association of NOD1 and NOD2 with pro-inflammatory responses induced by the IRE1α/TRAF2 signalling pathway provides a novel link between innate immunity and ER-stress-induced inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27214655>Calorie-induced ER stress suppresses uroguanylin satiety signaling in diet-induced .</a></h2><p>The uroguanylin-GUCY2C gut-brain axis has emerged as one component regulating feeding, energy homeostasis, body mass and metabolism. Here, we explore a role for this axis in mechanisms underlying diet-induced  (DIO).Intestinal uroguanylin expression and secretion, and hypothalamic GUCY2C expression and anorexigenic signaling, were quantified in mice on high-calorie diets for 14 weeks. The role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in suppressing uroguanylin in DIO was explored using tunicamycin, an inducer of ER stress, and  (TUDCA), a chemical chaperone that inhibits ER stress. The impact of consumed calories on uroguanylin expression was explored by dietary manipulation. The role of uroguanylin in mechanisms underlying  was examined using Camk2a-Cre-ER(T2)-Rosa-STOP(loxP/loxP)-Guca2b mice in which tamoxifen induces transgenic hormone expression in brain.DIO suppressed intestinal uroguanylin expression and eliminated its postprandial secretion into the circulation. DIO suppressed uroguanylin through ER stress, an effect mimicked by tunicamycin and blocked by TUDCA. Hormone suppression by DIO reflected consumed calories, rather than the pathophysiological milieu of , as a diet high in calories from carbohydrates suppressed uroguanylin in lean mice, whereas calorie restriction restored uroguanylin in obese mice. However, hypothalamic GUCY2C, enriched in the arcuate nucleus, produced anorexigenic signals mediating satiety upon exogenous agonist administration, and DIO did not impair these responses. Uroguanylin replacement by transgenic expression in brain repaired the hormone insufficiency and reconstituted satiety responses opposing DIO and its associated comorbidities, including visceral adiposity, glucose intolerance and hepatic steatosis.These studies reveal a novel pathophysiological mechanism contributing to  in which calorie-induced suppression of intestinal uroguanylin impairs hypothalamic mechanisms regulating food consumption through loss of anorexigenic endocrine signaling. The correlative therapeutic paradigm suggests that, in the context of hormone insufficiency with preservation of receptor sensitivity,  may be prevented or treated by GUCY2C hormone replacement.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28336924>Rtn1a-Mediated Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Podocyte Injury and Diabetic Nephropathy.</a></h2><p>We previously reported a critical role of reticulon (RTN) 1A in mediating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in kidney tubular cells and the expression of RTN1A correlates with the renal function and the severity of kidney injury in patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN). Here, we determined the roles of RTN1A and ER stress in podocyte injury and DN. We used db/db mice with early unilateral nephrectomy (Unx) as a murine model of progressive DN and treated mice with  (TUDCA), a specific inhibitor of ER stress. We found increased expression of RTN1A and ER stress markers in the kidney of db/db-Unx mice. Treatment of TUDCA not only attenuated proteinuria and kidney histological changes, but also ameliorated podocyte and glomeruli injury in diabetic mice, which were associated with reduction of RTN1A and ER stress marker expression in the podocytes of TUDCA-treated mice. In vitro, we showed RTN1A mediates albumin-induced ER stress and apoptosis in human podocytes. A positive feedback loop between RTN1A and CHOP was found leading to an enhanced ER stress in podocytes. Our data suggest that ER stress plays a major role in podocyte injury in DN and RTN1A might be a key regulator of ER stress in podocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27406815>Placental endoplasmic reticulum stress in gestational : the potential for therapeutic intervention with chemical chaperones and antioxidants.</a></h2><p>The aim of this work was to determine whether placental endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress may contribute to the pathophysiology of gestational  (GDM) and to test the efficacy of chemical chaperones and antioxidant vitamins in ameliorating that stress in a trophoblast-like cell line in vitro.Placental samples were obtained from women suffering from GDM and from normoglycaemic controls and were frozen immediately. Women with GDM had 2 h serum glucose levels > 9.0 mmol/l following a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test and were treated with diet and insulin when necessary. Western blotting was used to assess markers of ER stress. To test the effects of hyperglycaemia on the generation of ER stress, a new trophoblast-like cell line, BeWo-NG, was generated by culturing in a physiological glucose concentration of 5.5 mmol/l (over 20 passages) before challenging with 10 or 20 mmol/l glucose.All GDM patients were well-controlled (HbA1c 5.86 ± 0.55% or 40.64 ± 5.85 mmol/mol, n = 11). Low-grade ER stress was observed in the placental samples, with dilation of ER cisternae and increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 subunit α. Challenge of BeWo-NG with high glucose activated the same pathways, but this was as a result of acidosis of the culture medium rather than the glucose concentration per se. Addition of chemical chaperones 4-phenylbutyrate and  and vitamins C and E ameliorated the ER stress.This is the first report of placental ER stress in GDM patients.

The interplay between hyperglycemia and endothelial activation in inducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways and visual deficits in DR is not fully understood. To address this, we used a mouse model of chronic vascular activation using endothelial-specific tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-expressing (tie2-TNF) mice to induce  with streptozotocin. At 4 weeks post streptozotocin, a significant 2-fold to 10-fold increase in retinal neurovascular inflammatory gene transcript response in tie2-TNF mice was further increased in diabetic tie2-TNF mice. A decrease in visual acuity and scotopic b-wave amplitude in tie2-TNF mice was further accentuated in diabetic tie2-TNF mice and these changes correlated with a multi-fold increase in retinal ER stress markers and a reduction in adherens junctions. Cultured retinal endothelial cells showed a significant decrease in trans-endothelial resistance as well as VE-cadherin expression under TNF-α and high glucose stress. These changes were partly rescued by , a potent ER stress inhibitor. Taken together, constant endothelial activation induced by TNF-α further exacerbated by hyperglycemia results in activation of ER stress and chronic proinflammation in a feed forward loop ultimately resulting in endothelial junction protein alterations leading to visual deficits in the retina. Inhibition of ER stress and endothelial activation may prove to be a novel therapeutic target in DR.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653687>Deficiency of Mitochondrial Glycerol 3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Contributes to Hepatic Steatosis.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mGPDH) is an integral component of the respiratory chain, and recent studies have suggested that it plays an important role in hepatic glucose homeostasis. However, its function in hepatic lipid metabolism is unclear. Here, we identified a role for mGPDH in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Specifically, mGPDH expression and activity were lower in fatty livers from patients and mice with NAFLD (ob/ob, high-fat diet [HFD] and db/db). Liver-specific depletion of mGPDH in mice or mGPDH knockdown in cultured hepatocytes exacerbated diet-induced triglyceride accumulation and steatosis through enhanced lipogenesis. RNA-sequencing revealed that mGPDH regulated endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-related proteins and processes. mGPDH deletion exacerbated tunicamycin (ER stress inducer)-induced hepatic steatosis, whereas  (ER stress inhibitor) rescued mGPDH depletion-induced steatosis on an HFD. Moreover, ER stress induced by mGPDH depletion could be abrogated by the intracellular Ca chelator 1,2-bis (2-aminophenoxy) ethane N,N,N´,N´-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester, mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) inhibitor cyclosporine A, or cyclophilin-D (Cyp-D) knockdown. mGPDH promoting Cyp-D ubiquitination was also observed. Finally, liver-specific mGPDH overexpression attenuated hepatic steatosis in ob/ob and HFD mice. Conclusion: mGPDH is a pivotal regulator of hepatic lipid metabolism. Its deficiency induces ER stress by suppressing Cyp-D ubiquitination, a key regulator of the mitochondrial Ca conductance channel mPTP, and results in hepatic steatosis. mGPDH may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of NAFLD.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28348018>Synergistic Interaction of Hypertension and Diabetes in Promoting Kidney Injury and the Role of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress.</a></h2><p>Diabetes mellitus and hypertension are major risk factors for chronic kidney injury, together accounting for >70% of end-stage renal disease. In this study, we assessed interactions of hypertension and diabetes mellitus in causing kidney dysfunction and injury and the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Hypertension was induced by aorta constriction (AC) between the renal arteries in 6-month-old male Goto-Kakizaki (GK) type 2 diabetic and control Wistar rats. Fasting plasma glucose averaged 162±11 and 87±2 mg/dL in GK and Wistar rats, respectively. AC produced hypertension in the right kidney (above AC) and near normal blood pressure in the left kidney (below AC), with both kidneys exposed to the same levels of glucose, circulating hormones, and neural influences. After 8 weeks of AC, blood pressure above the AC (and in the right kidney) increased from 109±1 to 152±5 mm Hg in GK rats and from 106±4 to 141±5 mm Hg in Wistar rats. The diabetic-hypertensive right kidneys in GK-AC rats had much greater increases in albumin excretion and histological injury compared with left kidneys (diabetes mellitus only) of GK rats or right kidneys (hypertension only) of Wistar-AC rats. Marked increases in ER stress and oxidative stress indicators were observed in diabetic-hypertensive kidneys of GK-AC rats. Inhibition of ER stress with  for 6 weeks reduced blood pressure (135±4 versus 151±4 mm Hg), albumin excretion, ER and oxidative stress, and glomerular injury, while increasing glomerular filtration rate in hypertensive-diabetic kidneys. These results suggest that diabetes mellitus and hypertension interact synergistically to promote kidney dysfunction and injury via ER stress.© 2017 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27859785>Increased monocyte-derived reactive oxygen species in type 2 : role of endoplasmic reticulum stress.</a></h2><p>What is the central question of this study? Patients with type 2  exhibit increased oxidative stress in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, including monocytes; however, the mechanisms remain unknown. What is the main finding and its importance? The main finding of this study is that factors contained within the plasma of patients with type 2  can contribute to increased oxidative stress in monocytes, making them more adherent to endothelial cells. We show that these effects are largely mediated by the interaction between endoplasmic reticulum stress and NADPH oxidase activity. Recent evidence suggests that exposure of human monocytes to glucolipotoxic media to mimic the composition of plasma of patients with type 2  (T2D) results in the induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers and formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The extent to which these findings translate to patients with T2D remains unclear. Thus, we first measured ROS (dihydroethidium fluorescence) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from whole blood of T2D patients (n = 8) and compared the values with age-matched healthy control subjects (n = 8). The T2D patients exhibited greater basal intracellular ROS (mean ± SD, +3.4 ± 1.4-fold; P < 0.05) compared with control subjects. Next, the increase in ROS in PBMCs isolated from T2D patients was partly recapitulated in cultured human monocytes (THP-1 cells) exposed to plasma from T2D patients for 36 h (+1.3 ± 0.08-fold versus plasma from control subjects; P < 0.05). In addition, we found that increased ROS formation in THP-1 cells treated with T2D plasma was NADPH oxidase derived and led to increased endothelial cell adhesion (+1.8 ± 0.5-fold; P < 0.05) and lipid uptake (+1.3 ± 0.3-fold; P < 0.05). Notably, we found that T2D plasma-induced monocyte ROS and downstream functional effects were abolished by treating cells with , a chemical chaperone known to inhibit ER stress. Collectively, these data indicate that monocyte ROS production with T2D can be attributed, in part, to signals from the circulating environment. Furthermore, an interplay between ER stress and NADPH oxidase activity contributes to ROS production and may be a mechanism mediating endothelial cell adhesion and foam cell formation in T2D.© 2016 The Authors.

The present study assessed the effects and mechanisms of action of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which play an important role in the development of  complications, on testosterone secretion by rat Leydig cells. Primary rat Leydig cells were cultured and treated with AGEs (25, 50, 100 and 200 µg/ml). Testosterone production induced by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was determined by ELISA. The mRNA and protein expression levels of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc) and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD), which are involved in testosterone biosynthesis, were measured by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blot analyssi, respectively. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in Leydig cells was measured using the dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) probe. The expression levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related proteins [C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78)] in the Leydig cells were measured by western blot analysis. We found that the AGEs markedly suppressed testosterone production by rat Leydig cells which was induced by hCG in a concentration-dependent manner compared with the control (P<0.01). The mRNA and protein expression levels of StAR, 3β-HSD and P450scc were downregulated by the AGEs in a dose-dependent manner compared with the control (P<0.01). The antioxidant agent, N-acetyl‑L‑cysteine (NAC), and the endoplasmic reticulum stress inhibitor,  (TUDCA), reversed the inhibitory effects of AGEs. In addition, the content of ROS in Leydig cells treated with AGEs increased significantly. The expression levels of CHOP and GRP78 were markedly upregulated by the AGEs in the Leydig cells. From these findings, it can be concluded that AGEs inhibit testosterone production by rat Leydig cells by inducing oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26282527>Effect of  and 4-Phenylbutyric Acid on Metabolism of Copper and Zinc in Type 1 Diabetic Mice Model.</a></h2><p>Alternations of copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) status in  have received a great attention.

Determination of Cu and Zn in tissues and serum by acid digestion was followed by ICP-MS. The renal and serum Cu levels were significantly higher, while the hepatic Cu and Zn levels were significantly decreased in the diabetic mice at 2 weeks and 2 months after  onset. The increase of cardiac Cu together with the decrease of muscular Zn was found in the diabetic mice only at 2 months. Cu levels were positively correlated with Zn in the heart, liver, kidney, muscle, spleen, and serum of diabetic and control mice at both 2 weeks and 2 months. Both PBA and TUDCA reduced serum Zn, and PBA reduced hepatic Cu to normal levels in the diabetic mice at two time points, while PBA normalized serum Cu in the diabetic mice only at 2 months. PBA increased hepatic Zn to normal levels in the diabetic mice at 2 weeks, while it partially increased hepatic Zn in the same group at 2 months. Therefore, maintaining homeostasis of Cu and Zn by TUDCA and PBA in  needs to be received with special attention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26748055> prevents hearing loss and hair cell death in Cdh23(erl/erl) mice.</a></h2><p>Sensorineural hearing loss has long been the subject of experimental and clinical research for many years. The recently identified novel mutation of the Cadherin23 (Cdh23) gene, Cdh23(erl/erl), was proven to be a mouse model of human autosomal recessive nonsyndromic deafness (DFNB12).  (TUDCA), a taurine-conjugated bile acid, has been used in experimental research and clinical applications related to liver disease, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, and other diseases associated with apoptosis. Because hair cell apoptosis was implied to be the cellular mechanism leading to hearing loss in Cdh23(erl/erl) mice (erl mice), this study investigated TUDCA's otoprotective effects in erl mice: preventing hearing impairment and protecting against hair cell death. Our results showed that systemic treatment with TUDCA significantly alleviated hearing loss and suppressed hair cell death in erl mice. Additionally, TUDCA inhibited apoptotic genes and caspase-3 activation in erl mouse cochleae.

We have reported that sustained treatment with N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) results in apoptotic β-cell death and impairs insulin secretion. However, the molecular mechanism responsible for NMDA-induced β-cell dysfunction remains largely obscure. Thus, this study aimed to determine whether sustained activation of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) causes β-cell dysfunction through ER stress.Primary mouse islets and MIN6 mouse pancreatic β-cells were treated with NMDA for 24 h or high-glucose for 72 h. After the treatment, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and the expression of ER stress markers were measured, respectively. In vivo, the expression of ER stress markers was measured in the pancreas of diabetic mice treated with or without NMDARs inhibitor Memantine.NMDA treatment caused an increase in the expression of ER stress markers (ATF4, CHOP, GRP78, and Xbp1s) in primary islets. While,  (TUDCA), an inhibitor of ER stress, significantly attenuated NMDA-induced β-cell dysfunction, including the loss of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and reduction of pancreas duodenum homeobox factor-1 (Pdx-1) mRNA expression, a transcription factor regulating insulin synthesis. Besides, NMDA-induced ER stress strongly promoted pro-inflammatory cytokines synthesis (IL-1β and TNF-α) in β cells. Interestingly, knockdown of CHOP attenuated β-cell dysfunction evoked by NMDA. Furthermore, we demonstrated that blockade of NMDARs ameliorated high-glucose-induced ER stress in vitro and in vivo.This study confirms that ER stress is actively involved in the activation of NMDARs-related β-cell dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The shortage of established therapies may reflect the inability to target the tubular compartment. The chemical chaperone  (TUDCA) ameliorates maladaptive endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling and experimental dNP. Additionally, TUDCA activates the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), which is highly expressed in tubular cells. We hypothesized that TUDCA ameliorates maladaptive ER signaling  FXR agonism specifically in tubular cells. Indeed, TUDCA induced expression of FXR-dependent genes ( and ) in tubular cells but not in other renal cells. , TUDCA reduced glomerular and tubular injury in db/db and diabetic endothelial nitric oxide synthase-deficient mice. FXR inhibition with Z-guggulsterone or vivo-morpholino targeting of FXR diminished the ER-stabilizing and renoprotective effects of TUDCA. Notably, these  approaches abolished tubular but not glomerular protection by TUDCA. Combined intervention with TUDCA and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril in 16-week-old db/db mice reduced albuminuria more efficiently than did either treatment alone. Although both therapies reduced glomerular damage, only TUDCA ameliorated tubular damage. Thus, interventions that specifically protect the tubular compartment in dNP, such as FXR agonism, may provide renoprotective effects on top of those achieved by inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme.Copyright © 2017 by the American Society of Nephrology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30224065>ERp44 depletion exacerbates ER stress and aggravates diabetic nephropathy in db/db mice.</a></h2><p>Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a major complication of , and the dysfunction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays an important role in its pathogenesis. ERp44, an ER resident chaperone protein, has been implicated in the modulation of ER stress, however, its role and mechanism in DN are not determined. Here, we show that ERp44 expression is upregulated in the glomeruli of db/db mice, a rodent model of type 2 . When ERp44 is depleted by in vivo shRNA-mediated knockdown, the features associated with DN including albuminuria level and glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickness are aggravated, therefore suggesting a detrimental role of ERp44 depletion in DN progression. We further show that ERp44 depletion exacerbates ER stress in DN in db/db mice, and that attenuating ER stress with the chemical chaperone TUDCA remarkably diminishes the aggravated DN features caused by ERp44 depletion. These results suggest that the exacerbated ER stress is a critical factor for the detrimental effect of ERp44 depletion on DN progression in db/db mice. Thus, our study links the role of ERp44 in DN with ER stress regulation and may offer a potential therapeutic strategy to interfere DN progression.Copyright © 2018.

Therefore, we studied the influence of UDCA on BA enterohepatic circulation in vivo and the mechanisms by which UDCA affects the BA kinetics.Mice were treated with UDCA and other BAs to observe changes in BA pool and BA transporters involved in enterohepatic circulation. Isotope dilution techniques and biochemical analyses were applied to study BA kinetics after oral administration of UDCA, and the mechanism involved.Oral administration of UDCA in mice reduced the overall BA pool and produced a unique BA profile with high-abundance conjugated UDCA species, including  (TUDCA) and GUDCA. We found increased expression of several main BA transporters in the ileum and liver. BA kinetic experiment showed that feeding UDCA shortened cycling time of BA and accelerated BA enterohepatic circulation. Additionally, we found evidence that the effect of UDCA administration on accelerating BA enterohepatic circulation was due to the inhibition of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signalling in the ileum and FGF15/19 in the liver.Oral administration of UDCA produced a unique BA profile with high-abundance TUDCA and GUDCA and significantly accelerated BA enterohepatic circulation through the inhibition of intestinal FXR signalling and reduced level of FGF15/19, which in turn, induced the expression of BA transporters in the liver.

Although atrial natriuretic peptide and C-type natriuretic peptide reduce the myocardial ischemia-reperfusion damage in nondiabetic rats, whether vasonatrin peptide (VNP), the artificial synthetic chimera of atrial natriuretic peptide and C-type natriuretic peptide, confers cardioprotective effects against ischemia-reperfusion injury, especially in diabetic patients, is still unclear. This study was designed to investigate the effects of VNP on ischemia-reperfusion injury in diabetic rats and to further elucidate its mechanisms. The high-fat diet-fed streptozotocin-induced diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to ischemia-reperfusion operation. VNP treatment (100 μg/kg iv, 10 min before reperfusion) significantly improved the instantaneous first derivation of left ventricle pressure (±LV dP/dtmax) and LV systolic pressure and reduced LV end-diastolic pressure, apoptosis index, caspase-3 activity, plasma creatine kinase (CK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities. Moreover, VNP inhibited endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by suppressing glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). These effects were mimicked by 8-bromine-cyclic guanosinemonophosphate (8-Br-cGMP), a cGMP analog, whereas they were inhibited by KT-5823, the selective inhibitor of PKG. In addition, pretreatment with  (TUDCA), a specific inhibitor of ER stress, could not further promote the VNP's cardioprotective effect in diabetic rats. In vitro H9c2 cardiomyocytes were subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation and incubated with or without VNP (10(-8) mol/l). Gene knockdown of PKG1α with siRNA blunted VNP inhibition of ER stress and apoptosis, while overexpression of PKG1α resulted in significant decreased ER stress and apoptosis. VNP protects the diabetic heart against ischemia-reperfusion injury by inhibiting ER stress via the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. These results suggest that VNP may have potential therapeutic value for the diabetic patients with ischemic heart disease.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796972>Bile acid signaling in lipid metabolism: metabolomic and lipidomic analysis of lipid and bile acid markers linked to anti- and anti-diabetes in mice.</a></h2><p>Bile acid synthesis is the major pathway for catabolism of cholesterol.

OLA and two well-established TGR5 agonists, RG239 and  (TUDCA), acutely promoted stimulus-secretion coupling (SSC). OLA reduced K current and elevated current through Ca channels. Accordingly, in mouse and human β-cells, TGR5 ligands increased the cytosolic Ca concentration by stimulating Ca influx. Higher OLA concentrations evoked a dual reaction, probably due to activation of a counterregulating pathway. Protein kinase A (PKA) was identified as a downstream target of TGR5 activation. In contrast, inhibition of phospholipase C and phosphoinositide 3-kinase did not prevent stimulating effects of OLA. Involvement of exchange protein directly activated by cAMP 2 (Epac2) or farnesoid X receptor (FXR2) was ruled out by experiments with knockout mice. The proposed pathway was not influenced by local glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) secretion from α-cells, shown by experiments with MIN6 cells, and a GLP-1 receptor antagonist. In summary, these data clearly demonstrate that activation of TGR5 in β-cells stimulates insulin secretion via an AC/cAMP/PKA-dependent pathway, which is supposed to interfere with SSC by affecting K and Ca currents and thus membrane potential.© 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31402868>Ursodeoxycholic Acid Alters Bile Acid and Fatty Acid Profiles in a Mouse Model of Diet-Induced .</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is a bile acid (BA) approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis. It is also the major active component of bear bile used in traditional Chinese medicine to reduce fever, remove toxins, and treat liver and eye ailments. In addition, UDCA and its conjugated form have been evaluated for their potential to improve symptoms of metabolic diseases, but the results have been inconclusive. To address this issue, in this study, we investigated the effects of orally administered UDCA on mice with diet-induced , including the BA and free fatty acid (FFA) profiles of serum, liver, and epididymis and brown adipose tissues. We found that UDCA treatment significantly improved most metabolic indices;  (TUDCA) and taurolithocholic acid (TLCA) contents were increased in all examined tissues, whereas saturated FA levels were decreased, and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) levels were increased in most tissues. A correlation analysis showed that the concentrations of UDCA and its derivatives were positively correlated with that of n-3 PUFA. To clarify the mechanism by which UDCA alters FFA profiles, we analyzed the expression levels of genes involved in FFA biosynthesis, uptake, and oxidation and found that FFA biosynthesis and uptake were inhibited while FFA oxidation was stimulated by UDCA treatment. Additionally, amino acid-conjugated derivatives of UDCA, such as TUDCA and TLCA, altered FFA profiles by modulating FFA biosynthesis, uptake, and oxidation. These findings provide evidence that UDCA can alleviate metabolic dysfunction and could therefore be effective in the treatment of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30171596>Effect of 4-Phenylbutyric Acid and  on Magnesium and Calcium Metabolism in Streptozocin-Induced Type 1 Diabetic Mice.</a></h2><p>Recent evidence has identified a role of micronutrients, such as magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca), in glycemic control. 4-Phenylbutyric acid (PBA) and  (TUDCA) are molecular chaperones that can improve protein folding and alleviate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Increasingly, research is focusing on the association between molecular chaperones and micronutrients. This study established and characterized a mouse model of type 1  (T1D) and investigated the effect of PBA and TUDCA on Mg and Ca metabolism in these mice. T1D was established in Friend virus B-type mice using multiple low doses of streptozotocin. Mice were administered chaperones. Mgand Ca levels in tissues and serum were detected using acid digestion and ICP-MS. At 2 weeks and 2 months after chaperone administration was initiated, Mg levels in the heart, liver, kidney, and serum and Ca levels in spleen and serum of T1D mice were significantly decreased compared with controls; Ca levels in the kidney and muscle of T1D mice were significantly increased; Mg and Ca levels in the heart, liver, kidney, muscle, spleen, and serum were positively correlated in control and T1D mice; and PBA restored renal Mg levels to normal values and TUDCA restored hepatic, renal, and serum Mg levels and renal and serum Ca levels to normal values in T1D mice. PBA restored muscular Ca levels to normal values in T1D mice at 2 months after chaperone or vehicle administration was initiated.

Currently, other than supportive care and antibiotics, there are no treatments for this condition. We developed an in vitro assay to understand the role of the ER-stress-mediated apoptosis process in lymphocyte death during polymicrobial sepsis, which was reproducible in in vivo mouse models. Modulating ER stress using chemical chaperones significantly reduced the induction of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim both in vitro and in mice. Furthermore, in a 'two-hit' pneumonia model in mice, we have been able to demonstrate that administration of the chemical chaperone TUDCA helped to maintain lymphocyte homeostasis by significantly reducing lymphocyte apoptosis and this correlated with four-fold improvement in survival.

Copper(ii)-phenanthroline complexes are promising compounds that were shown previously to induce an immediate cytotoxic response over a panel of tumor cell lines in vitro. The molecular mechanism, however, remained unresolved. In this work we performed a thorough study of the copper(ii)-phenanthroline complexes containing different imidazolidine-2-thione ligands in ovarian cancer cells, and revealed that these complexes induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and subsequently cell death mediated by the unfolded protein response. Alleviation of the ER-stress by  (TUDCA) attenuated the cytotoxic effects. In summary, we have identified a novel, ER-dependent, molecular mechanism mediating cytotoxic effects of copper(ii)-phenanthroline complexes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28029143>Troxerutin Attenuates Enhancement of Hepatic Gluconeogenesis by Inhibiting NOD Activation-Mediated Inflammation in High-Fat Diet-Treated Mice.</a></h2><p>Recent evidence suggests that troxerutin, a trihydroxyethylated derivative of natural bioflavonoid rutin, exhibits beneficial effects on diabetes-related symptoms. Here we investigated the effects of troxerutin on the enhancement of hepatic gluconeogenesis in high-fat diet (HFD)-treated mice and the mechanisms underlying these effects. Mice were divided into four groups: Control group, HFD group, HFD + Troxerutin group, and Troxerutin group. Troxerutin was treated by daily oral administration at doses of 150 mg/kg/day for 20 weeks.  (TUDCA) was used to inhibit endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress). Our results showed that troxerutin effectively improved  and related metabolic parameters, and liver injuries in HFD-treated mouse. Furthermore, troxerutin significantly attenuated enhancement of hepatic gluconeogenesis in HFD-fed mouse. Moreover, troxerutin notably suppressed nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 transcriptional activation and release of inflammatory cytokines in HFD-treated mouse livers. Mechanismly, troxerutin dramatically decreased Nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD) expression, as well as interaction between NOD1/2 with interacting protein-2 (RIP2), by abating oxidative stress-induced ER stress in HFD-treated mouse livers, which was confirmed by TUDCA treatment. These improvement effects of troxerutin on hepatic glucose disorders might be mediated by its anti- effect. In conclusion, troxerutin markedly diminished HFD-induced enhancement of hepatic gluconeogenesis via its inhibitory effects on ER stress-mediated NOD activation and consequent inflammation, which might be mediated by its anti- effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26902174>Endoplasmic reticulum stress regulates inflammation and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle from pregnant women.</a></h2><p>Sterile inflammation and infection are key mediators of inflammation and peripheral insulin resistance associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Studies have shown endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress to induce inflammation and insulin resistance associated with  and type 2 diabetes, however is paucity of studies investigating the effects of ER stress in skeletal muscle on inflammation and insulin resistance associated with GDM. ER stress proteins IRE1α, GRP78 and XBP-1s were upregulated in skeletal muscle of obese pregnant women, whereas IRE1α was increased in GDM women. Suppression of ER stress, using ER stress inhibitor  (TUDCA) or siRNA knockdown of IRE1α and GRP78, significantly downregulated LPS-, poly(I:C)- or IL-1β-induced production of IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β and MCP-1. Furthermore, LPS-, poly(I:C)- or TNF-α-induced insulin resistance was improved following suppression of ER stress, by increasing insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IR-β, IRS-1, GLUT-4 expression and glucose uptake. In summary, our inducible  and GDM-like models suggests that the development of GDM may be involved in activating ER stress-induced inflammation and insulin resistance in human skeletal muscle.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In this study, we investigated whether G0S2 is regulated by branch of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and contributes to ER stress-induced hepatic steatosis.We first analyzed G0S2 expression and the state of the three canonical UPR branches in several hepatic steatosis models, tunicamycin-treated C57BL/6J mice and HepG2 cells, where ER homeostasis was perturbed. We pretreated HepG2 cells with  (TUDCA) to validate whether G0S2 was the downstream target of ER stress. Loss or gain function analysis was conducted to identify which UPR branch specifically linked to G0S2 transcription. The transcription mechanism was estimated by luciferase reporter assay and ChIP assay.Here we showed that the activation of ER stress was accompanied by elevation of G0S2 expression in the occurrence of fatty liver disease. Furthermore, G0S2 was found to be a novel target gene of activating transcription factor 4(ATF4). We also localized one conserved ATF4-binding sequence in the 5' regulatory region of G0S2, which was responsible for transcriptional activating G0S2 by ATF4.G0S2 is regulated by the PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 branch of the UPR and mediates ER stress-induced hepatic steatosis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

As 3',4'-dihydroxyflavonol (DiOHF) 4 reduces vascular injury caused by ischaemia/reperfusion or , and flavonols have been demonstrated to attenuate ER stress, we investigated whether DiOHF can protect mice from ER stress-induced endothelial dysfunction. Male C57BLK/6 J mice were injected with tunicamycin to induce ER stress in the presence or absence of either DiOHF or  (TUDCA), an inhibitor of ER stress. Tunicamycin elevated blood pressure and impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation. Moreover, in aortae there was evidence of ER stress, oxidative stress and reduced NO production. This was coincident with increased NOX2 expression and reduced phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) on Ser1176. Importantly, the effects of tunicamycin were significantly ameliorated by DiOHF or TUDCA. DiOHF also inhibited tunicamycin-induced ER stress and apoptosis in cultured human endothelial cells (HUVEC). These results provide evidence that ER stress is likely an important initiator of endothelial dysfunction through the induction of oxidative stress and a reduction in NO synthesis and that DiOHF directly protects against ER stress- induced injury. DiOHF may be useful to prevent ER and oxidative stress to preserve endothelial function, for example in hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26234558> and Age-Related Differences in Vascular Function of Renal Artery: Possible Involvement of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress.</a></h2><p>To study the time-course relationship between vascular functions and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in type 2 , we investigated vascular function and associated protein expression, including cyclo-oxygenase (COX), ER stress, and apoptotic markers, in renal arteries (RA) from type 2 diabetic Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima fatty (OLETF) rats at the young adult (4 months old) and aged (18 months old) stages. In the RA of aged OLETF (vs. young OLETF), we found: (1) Increased contractions induced by uridine adenosine tetraphosphate (Up4A) and phenylephrine, (2) decreased relaxation and increased contraction induced by acetylcholine (ACh) at lower and higher concentrations, respectively, and (3) increased expression of COX-1 and C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP, a pro-apoptotic protein). In aged rats, the expression of COX-1, COX-2, PDI (an ER protein disulfide isomerase), Bax (a proapoptotic marker), and CHOP were increased in RA from OLETF rats (vs. age-matched control Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka [LETO] rats). Up-regulation of PDI and Bax were seen in the RA from young OLETF (vs. young LETO) rats. No age-related alterations were apparent in the above changes in RA from LETO rats, excluding ACh-induced contraction. Short-term treatment with the ER stress inhibitor  (TUDCA, 100 mg/kg per day, intraperitoneally for 1 week) to OLETF rats at the chronic stage of the disease (12 months old) could suppress renal arterial contractions induced by Up4A and ACh. These results suggest that a long-term duration of disease may be important for the development of vascular dysfunction rather than aging per se. The early regulation of ER stress may be important against the development of -associated vascular dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26099855>Cytokines induce endoplasmic reticulum stress in human, rat and mouse beta cells via different mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Proinflammatory cytokines contribute to beta cell damage in type 1  in part through activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In rat beta cells, cytokine-induced ER stress involves NO production and consequent inhibition of the ER Ca(2+) transporting ATPase sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) pump 2 (SERCA2B). However, the mechanisms by which cytokines induce ER stress and apoptosis in mouse and human pancreatic beta cells remain unclear. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the role of ER stress on cytokine-induced beta cell apoptosis in these three species and thus solve ongoing controversies in the field.Rat and mouse insulin-producing cells, human pancreatic islets and human EndoC-βH1 cells were exposed to the cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α and IFN-γ, with or without NO inhibition. A global comparison of cytokine-modulated gene expression in human, mouse and rat beta cells was also performed. The chemical chaperone  (TUDCA) and suppression of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) were used to assess the role of ER stress in cytokine-induced apoptosis of human beta cells.NO plays a key role in cytokine-induced ER stress in rat islets, but not in mouse or human islets. Bioinformatics analysis indicated greater similarity between human and mouse than between human and rat global gene expression after cytokine exposure. The chemical chaperone TUDCA and suppression of CHOP or c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) protected human beta cells against cytokine-induced apoptosis.These observations clarify previous results that were discrepant owing to the use of islets from different species, and confirm that cytokine-induced ER stress contributes to human beta cell death, at least in part via JNK activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28190264>Inflammatory stress of pancreatic beta cells drives release of extracellular heat-shock protein 90α.</a></h2><p>A major obstacle in predicting and preventing the development of autoimmune type 1 diabetes (T1D) in at-risk individuals is the lack of well-established early biomarkers indicative of ongoing beta cell stress during the pre-clinical phase of disease. Recently, serum levels of the α cytoplasmic isoform of heat-shock protein 90 (hsp90) were shown to be elevated in individuals with new-onset T1D. We therefore hypothesized that hsp90α could be released from beta cells in response to cellular stress and inflammation associated with the earliest stages of T1D. Here, human beta cell lines and cadaveric islets released hsp90α in response to stress induced by treatment with a combination of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1β, tumour necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ. Mechanistically, hsp90α release was found to be driven by cytokine-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress mediated by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), a pathway that can eventually lead to beta cell apoptosis. Cytokine-induced beta cell hsp90α release and JNK activation were significantly reduced by pre-treating cells with the endoplasmic reticulum stress-mitigating chemical chaperone . The hsp90α release by cells may therefore be a sensitive indicator of stress during inflammation and a useful tool in assessing therapeutic mitigation of cytokine-induced cell damage linked to autoimmunity.© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30273669>Chemical chaperone-conjugated exendin-4 as a cytoprotective agent for pancreatic β-cells.</a></h2><p>Endoplasmic reticulum stress has been considered a major cause of pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis leading to diabetes. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor activation and chemical chaperones have been known to reduce endoplasmic reticulum stress and improve β-cell function and survival. The purpose of this study was to prepare and evaluate the chemical chaperone -conjugated exendin-4 as a protective agent for pancreatic β-cells. Mono--Lys-exendin-4 conjugate (TUM1-Ex4) showed better receptor binding affinity than other conjugates with strong in vitro insulinotropic activity in rat pancreatic β-cells and in vivo hypoglycemic activity in type 2 diabetic db/db mice. In INS-1 cells under endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by thapsigargin, TUM1-Ex4 promoted cell survival in a dose-dependent manner. In western blot analysis, TUM1-Ex4 reduced the expression of the endoplasmic reticulum stress marker GRP78 and phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α. These results reveal that TUM1-Ex4 accelerates translational recovery and contributes to β-cell protection and survival. The present study indicates that the chemical chaperone-coupled glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist is a feasible therapeutic strategy to enhance β-cell function and survival.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, whether UDCA has improving effects on diabetic retinopathy (DR) is not known. This study aims to observe the amelioration of UDCA on DR and its engaged mechanisms. The results of Evans blue permeation assay showed that UDCA (15, 30 mg/kg) reversed the breakdown of blood-retinal barrier (BRB) and the decreased expression of claudin-1 and claudin-19 in STZ-induced diabetic mice. UDCA reversed the reduced thickness of both inner nuclear layer (INL) and outer nuclear layer (ONL) in STZ-induced diabetic mice. UDCA reduced retinal ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) expression in STZ-induced diabetic mice. UDCA reduced the expression of phosphorylated the inhibitor of nuclear factor κB kinase (IKK) and the nuclear translocation of p65 subunit of nuclear factor κB (NFκB) in retinas from STZ-induced diabetic mice. UDCA also reduced retinal expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in STZ-induced diabetic mice.

Experiments in rodents with trained exercise have shown that exercise improves vascular function and reduces vascular inflammation by modulating the balance between nitric oxide (NO) and oxidative stress. However, the upstream regulator of exercise-induced vascular benefits is unclear. We aimed to investigate the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ) in exercise-induced vascular functional improvement. We show that PPARδ is a crucial mediator for exercise to exert a beneficial effect on the vascular endothelium in diabetic mice. In db/db mice and high-fat diet-induced obese mice, 4 weeks of treadmill exercise restored endothelium-dependent vasodilation of aortas and flow-mediated vasodilation in mesenteric resistance arteries, whereas genetic ablation of Ppard abolished such improvements. Exercise induces AMPK activation and subsequent PPARδ activation, which help to reduce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and oxidative stress, thus increasing NO bioavailability in endothelial cells and vascular tissues. Chemical chaperones 4-phenylbutyric acid and  decrease ER stress and protect against endothelial dysfunction in diabetic mice. The results demonstrate that PPARδ-mediated inhibition of ER stress contributes to the vascular benefits of exercise and provides potentially effective targets for treating diabetic vasculopathy.© 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30501003> (TUDCA) abolishes chronic high salt-induced renal injury and inflammation.</a></h2><p>Chronic high salt intake exaggerates renal injury and inflammation, especially with the loss of functional ET receptors.

Our aim was to determine whether TUDCA is reno-protective in a model of ET receptor deficiency with chronic high salt-induced renal injury and inflammation.ET -deficient and transgenic control rats were placed on normal (0.8% NaCl) or high salt (8% NaCl) diet for 3 weeks, receiving TUDCA (400 mg/kg/d; ip) or vehicle. Histological and biochemical markers of kidney injury, renal cell death and renal inflammation were assessed.In ET -deficient rats, high salt diet significantly increased glomerular and proximal tubular histological injury, proteinuria, albuminuria, excretion of tubular injury markers KIM-1 and NGAL, renal cortical cell death and renal CD4 T cell numbers. TUDCA treatment increased proximal tubule megalin expression as well as prevented high salt diet-induced glomerular and tubular damage in ET -deficient rats, as indicated by reduced kidney injury markers, decreased glomerular permeability and proximal tubule brush border restoration, as well as reduced renal inflammation. However, TUDCA had no significant effect on blood pressure.TUDCA protects against the development of glomerular and proximal tubular damage, decreases renal cell death and inflammation in the renal cortex in rats with ET receptor dysfunction on a chronic high salt diet.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. This study explores whether BNP exerts its cardioprotection against hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury under high glucose/high fat (HG/HF) conditions in cardiac H9c2 cells and uncovers the underlying mechanisms. Our data revealed that BNP significantly increased the cell viability and decreased the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK), with a maximal effect at the BNP concentration of 10 mol/L. In addition, by analyzing the activation of cleaved caspase-3 and by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining, we showed that BNP attenuated H/R-induced cell apoptosis in HG/HF conditions. Western blot analysis showed enhanced phosphorylation of protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like endoplastmic reticulum (ER) kinase (PERK) and eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α)(one of the three main signaling pathways in endoplastmic reticulum (ER) stress), and increased expression of GRP78 and CHOP proteins (ER stress-related proteins) in H9c2 cells which underwent H/R in HG/HF conditions. Treatment with BNP or 8-Br-cGMP (an analog of cGMP) reversed this activation. However, this effect was significantly weakened by KT-5823, a selective cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitor. In addition, similar to BNP, treatment with a specific inhibitor of ER stress  (TUDCA) protected the cells against H/R injury exposed to HG/HF conditions. In conclusion, these findings demonstrated that BNP effectively protected cells against H/R injury under HG/HF conditions by inhibiting the ER stress via activation of the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We hypothesized in this study that interferon alpha (IFNα) participates in the early stages of T1D development by triggering endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. To verify our hypothesis, human islets and human EndoC-βH1 cells were exposed to IFNα and tested for ER stress markers, glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and insulin content. IFNα treatment induced upregulation of ER stress markers including Binding immunoglobulin Protein, phospho-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α, spliced- X-box binding protein-1, C/EBP homologous protein and activating transcription factor 4. Intriguingly, IFNα treatment did not impair GSIS but significantly decreased insulin production in both human islets and EndoC-βH1 cells. Furthermore, IFNα decreased the expression of both proinsulin convertase 1 and proinsulin convertase 2, suggesting an altered functional state of the beta cells characterized by a slower proinsulin-insulin conversion. Pretreatment of both human islets and EndoC-βH1 cells with chemical chaperones 4-phenylbutyric acid and  completely prevented IFNα effects, indicating an ER stress-mediated impairment of insulin production. We demonstrated for the first time that IFNα elicits ER stress in human beta cells providing a novel mechanistic role for this virus-induced cytokine in the development of T1D.

In the present study, we determined the in vivo contribution of EGFRtk and ER stress in acute myocardial infarction induced by acute ischemia (40 min)-reperfusion (24 h) (I/R) injury in T2D (db/db) mice. We treated db/db mice with EGFRtk inhibitor (AG1478, 10 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks. Mice were then subjected to myocardial I/R injury. The db/db mice developed a significant infarct after I/R injury. The inhibition of EGFRtk significantly reduced the infarct size and ER stress induction. We also determined that the inhibition of ER stress (, TUDCA, 150 mg/kg per day) in db/db significantly decrease the infarct size indicating that ER stress is a downstream mechanism to EGFRtk. Moreover, AG1478 and TUDCA reduced myocardium p38 and ERK1/2 MAP-kinases activity, and increased the activity of the pro-survival signaling cascade Akt. Additionally, the inhibition of EGFRtk and ER stress reduced cell apoptosis and the inflammation as indicated by the reduction in macrophages and neutrophil infiltration. We determined for the first time that the inhibition of EGFRtk protects T2D heart against I/R injury through ER stress-dependent mechanism.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is involved in diabetic nephropathy.  (TUDCA) is an effective inhibitor of ER stress. Here, we investigated the role of TUDCA in the progression of tubular injury in DN. For eight weeks, being treated with TUDCA at 250 mg/kg intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) twice a day, diabetic db/db mice had significantly reduced blood glucose, albuminuria and attenuated renal histopathology. These changes were associated with a significant decreased expression of ER stress markers. At the same time, diabetic db/db mice had more TUNEL-positive nuclei in the renal tubule, which were attenuated by TUDCA treatment, along with decreases in ER stress-associated apoptotic markers in the kidneys. In summary, the effect of TUDCA on tubular injury, in part, is associated with inhibition of ER stress in the kidneys of diabetic db/db mice.

These results demonstrate the potential of the NTFs as axoprotectants in AGEs exposed retinal neurons.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26522062>Toll-like receptor 4-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress contributes to impairment of vasodilator action of insulin.</a></h2><p>Impairment of vasodilator action of insulin is associated with endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance. Activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) induces proinflammatory response and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Saturated fatty acids (SFA) activate TLR4, which induces ER stress and endothelial dysfunction. Therefore, we determined whether TLR4-mediated ER stress is an obligatory step mediating SFA-induced endothelial dysfunction. Palmitate stimulated proinflammatory responses and ER stress, and this was suppressed by knockdown of TLR4 in primary human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC). Next, we examined the role of TLR4 in vasodilatory responses in intact vessels isolated from wild-type (WT, C57BL/6) and TLR4-KO mice after feeding high-fat (HFD) or normal chow diet (NCD) for 12 wk. Arterioles isolated from HFD WT mice exhibited impaired insulin-stimulated vasodilation compared with arterioles isolated from NCD WT mice. Deficiency of TLR4 was protective from HFD-induced impairment of insulin-stimulated vasodilation. There were no differences in acetylcholine (Ach)- or sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-stimulated vasodilation between the two groups. Furthermore, we examined whether ER stress is involved in SFA-induced impairment of vasodilator actions of insulin. Infusion of palmitate showed the impairment of vasodilatory response to insulin, which was ameliorated by coinfusion with  (TUDCA), an ER stress suppressor. Taken together, the results suggest that TLR4-induced ER stress may be an obligatory step mediating the SFA-mediated endothelial dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31150794>Amelioration of dry eye syndrome in db/db mice with diabetes mellitus by treatment with Tibetan Medicine Formula Jikan Mingmu Drops.</a></h2><p>Jikan Mingmu Drops (JMD), a traditional Tibetan medicine containing six herbs, has been used to treat dry eye syndrome (DES) in individuals with diabetes mellitus.However, the activity of JMD ameliorates DES with diabetes mellitus has not been previously examined. The aim of the study is to investigate the molecular mechanism of JMD on db/db mice.The main chemical constituents of JMD were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. DES was then induced in db/db mice by applying 0.2% benzalkonium chloride to the ocular surface for 7 days. Eye drops containing JMD (0.25, 0.5, or 1 g/mL) or vehicle subsequently were administered three times daily for another 7 days, and the therapeutic effects were evaluated by phenol red thread tear and sodium fluorescein tests. Conjunctival specimens were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining and periodic acid-Schiff staining to examine pathological changes and number of goblet cells. ELISA was performed to assess the levels of various inflammatory cytokines.JMD contains hydroxysafflor yellow A, magnoflorine, jatrorrhizine hydrochloride, palmatine hydrochloride, berberine hydrochloride, gallic acid, ellagic acid, , camphor, isoborneol, borneol, trans-cinnamic acid, and muscone. JMD treatment significantly increased the tear volume, decreased the corneal fluorescein staining score, restored the morphology and structure of conjunctival epithelial cells, and markedly downregulated the levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17α, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and vascular endothelial growth factor in the conjunctiva. Further data showed that these protective effects were accompanied by inhibition of inflammation in a dose-dependent manner.Amelioration of DES in db/db mice with diabetes mellitus by treatment with Tibetan medicine formula JMD maybe related to its anti-inflammatory effects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we investigated the effects of the conjugated bile acid TUDCA on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) from pancreatic β-cells.Pancreatic islets were isolated from 90-day-old male mice. Insulin secretion was measured by radioimmunoassay, protein phosphorylation by western blot, Ca(2+) signals by fluorescence microscopy and ATP-dependent K(+) (KATP) channels by electrophysiology.TUDCA dose-dependently increased GSIS in fresh islets at stimulatory glucose concentrations but remained without effect at low glucose levels. This effect was not associated with changes in glucose metabolism, Ca(2+) signals or KATP channel activity; however, it was lost in the presence of a cAMP competitor or a PKA inhibitor. Additionally, PKA and CREB phosphorylation were observed after 1-hour incubation with TUDCA. The potentiation of GSIS was blunted by the Gα stimulatory, G protein subunit-specific inhibitor NF449 and mimicked by the specific TGR5 agonist INT-777, pointing to the involvement of the bile acid G protein-coupled receptor TGR5.Our data indicate that TUDCA potentiates GSIS through the cAMP/PKA pathway.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, the importance of ER stress in diabetic vascular dysfunction is unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of the ER stress inhibitor,  (TUDCA), on arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction in type 2 diabetic mice.Carotid and mesenteric artery endothelial function were assessed via ex vivo pressure myography, and arterial stiffness was measured by aortic pulse wave velocity. The effects of TUDCA were examined both acutely (ex vivo) and chronically (250 mg/kg/day; i.p., 4 weeks).Compared to control C57BL/6J mice, db/db (DB) mice did not display carotid artery endothelial dysfunction; however, mesenteric artery endothelial function was markedly impaired. Acute incubation and chronic administration of TUDCA improved endothelium-dependent dilation in DB mesenteric arteries, without affecting endothelium-independent dilation. Chronic TUDCA administration also reduced arterial stiffness and was associated with reductions in ER stress markers in aortic and perivascular adipose tissue.These results suggest that ER stress may represent a novel cause of, and therapeutic target for, diabetic vascular dysfunction.© 2017 S.

We hypothesized that the hypothalamic opioid system might also control energy metabolism in peripheral tissues. Mice lacking the kappa opioid receptor (κOR) and adenoviral vectors overexpressing or silencing κOR were stereotaxically delivered in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) of rats. Vagal denervation was performed to assess its effect on liver metabolism. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was inhibited by pharmacological () and genetic (overexpression of the chaperone glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa) approaches. The peripheral effects on lipid metabolism were assessed by histological techniques and western blot. We show that in the LHA κOR directly controls hepatic lipid metabolism through the parasympathetic nervous system, independent of changes in food intake and body weight. κOR colocalizes with melanin concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCH-R1) in the LHA, and genetic disruption of κOR reduced melanin concentrating hormone-induced liver steatosis. The functional relevance of these findings was given by the fact that silencing of κOR in the LHA attenuated both methionine choline-deficient, diet-induced and choline-deficient, high-fat diet-induced ER stress, inflammation, steatohepatitis, and fibrosis, whereas overexpression of κOR in this area promoted liver steatosis. Overexpression of glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa in the liver abolished hypothalamic κOR-induced steatosis by reducing hepatic ER stress.This study reveals a novel hypothalamic-parasympathetic circuit modulating hepatic function through inflammation and ER stress independent of changes in food intake or body weight; these findings might have implications for the clinical use of opioid receptor antagonists.

However, the limited information of TUDCA on protecting diabetic retinopathy (DR) has been known. The present study was conducted to evaluate the protection of TUDCA on high glucose-induced human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs) dysfunction and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic retinopathy (DR) rats and the possible mechanism underlying was also explored.The proliferation of high glucose-induced HRMECs was determined by MTT assay. DR rats' model was established by an administration of high-glucose-fat diet and an intraperitoneal injection of STZ (30mg/kg). The cell supernatant and rats' serum were collected for the assays of NO content by ELISA kits. Retinas were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) to observe pathological changes. Immunohistochemical assay was applied to examine the protein expression of ICAM-1, NOS, NF-κB p65 and VEGF in rat retinas. Furthermore, western blot analysis was carried out to examine the protein expression of ICAM-1, NOS, NF-κB p65 and VEGF in high glucose-induced HRMECs.After treating with TUDCA, high glucose-induced HRMECs proliferation could be significantly inhibited. TUDCA (5.0μM, 25.0μM and 125.0μM) could decrease NO content in high glucose-induced HRMECs. Furthermore, TUDCA (500mg/kg/d and 250mg/kg/d) also decrease NO content in serum of DR rats. Additionally, both immunocytochemistry analysis and western blot analysis showed that the over-expression of ICAM-1, NOS, NF-κB p65 and VEGF were significantly decreased by TUDCA.The data indicated that TUDCA could ameliorate DR by decreasing NO content and down-regulating the protein expression of ICAM-1, NOS, NF-κB p65 and VEGF. Thus, our experimental results suggested that TUDCA might be a potential drug for the prevention and treatment of DR.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, the physiological and functional roles of RNF186 in peripheral tissues remain largely unknown. In the current study, we investigate the physiological function of RNF186 in the regulation of ER stress with respect to its biological roles in regulating insulin sensitivity in mouse primary hepatocytes. RNF186 expression is induced in the livers of diabetic, obese and diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Mouse primary hepatocytes were isolated and treated with Ad-RNF186 or Ad-GFP. The results suggest that overexpression of RNF186 increases the protein levels of the ER stress sensors inositol requiring kinase 1 (IRE1) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) protein, as well as the phosphorylation level of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), in mouse primary hepatocytes. This effect impedes the action of insulin through c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1). Furthermore, overexpression of RNF186 also significantly increases the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNFα, IL-6 and MCP1. In addition,  (TUDCA), an ER stress inhibitor, alleviates the expression of ER stress markers induced by RNF186 overexpression. Taken together, the results of the present study show that overexpression of RNF186 induces ER stress and impairs insulin signalling in mouse primary hepatocytes, suggesting that RNF186 merits further investigation as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of insulin-resistance-associated metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2018.

This study investigated the role of hypothalamic GRP78 on energy balance, with particular interest in thermogenesis and browning of white adipose tissue (WAT). For this purpose, we used diet-induced obese rats and rats administered thapsigargin, and by combining metabolic, histologic, physiologic, pharmacologic, thermographic, and molecular techniques, we studied the effect of genetic manipulation of hypothalamic GRP78. Our data showed that rats fed a high-fat diet or that were centrally administered thapsigargin displayed hypothalamic ER stress, whereas genetic overexpression of GRP78 specifically in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus was sufficient to alleviate ER stress and to revert the obese and metabolic phenotype. Those effects were independent of feeding and leptin but were related to increased thermogenic activation of brown adipose tissue and induction of browning in WAT and could be reversed by antagonism of β3 adrenergic receptors. This evidence indicates that modulation of hypothalamic GRP78 activity may be a potential strategy against  and associated comorbidities.© 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.</p></html>
