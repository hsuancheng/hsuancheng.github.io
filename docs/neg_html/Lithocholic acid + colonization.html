Divalent cations reversed this LCA-induced switch to chaining and biofilm formation. Experimental evolution in the presence of LCA yielded mutations in the essential two-component kinase yycG/walK and three-component response regulator liaR that locked VRE in diplococcal mode, impaired biofilm formation, and increased susceptibility to the antibiotic daptomycin. These mutant VRE strains were deficient in host colonization because of their inability to compete with intestinal microbiota. This morphotype switch presents a potential non-bactericidal therapeutic target that may help clear VRE from the intestines of dominated patients, as occurs frequently during hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

N. gonorrhoeae high-level azithromycin resistance has been associated with an A2059G mutation in 23S rRNA. Here we investigated the specific contribution of this 23S rRNA A2059G mutation to high-level azithromycin resistance and its impact on biological fitness.A2059G/G2059A alleles were specifically cloned into all four genomic copies of 23S rDNA of an azithromycin-susceptible isolate and a high-level azithromycin-resistant isolate. WT and mutant strains were subsequently investigated for azithromycin susceptibility using the agar dilution method. In addition, their biological fitness was studied by comparative liquid growth in the presence of hydrophobic and amphipathic compounds, by competition assays in a mouse vaginal tract infection model and by competition assays for invasion and intracellular survival.Azithromycin susceptibility analyses showed that the 23S rRNA A2059G mutation is the only genetic determinant required for N. gonorrhoeae to display the high-level azithromycin resistance phenotype. Further analysis of biological fitness showed that strains containing 2059G outcompeted isogenic strains containing 2059A for  in the mouse vaginal tract infection model and for invasion of HeLa cervical epithelial cells. Furthermore, the A2059G mutation enhanced growth in the presence of  or Triton X-100.Our findings that the 23S rRNA A2059G mutation is sufficient for high-level azithromycin resistance and that this mutation generally enhanced the biological fitness of N. gonorrhoeae have important implications for the currently recommended treatment policies and antimicrobial stewardship programmes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6836507>Role of bile salts and trypsin in the pathogenesis of experimental alkaline esophagitis.</a></h2><p>The pathogenesis of alkaline reflux esophagitis was investigated in an experimental model by assessing individually the influence of different bile salt moieties and trypsin on esophageal mucosa. An isolated segment of rabbit esophagus was perfused at pH 7 with a solution containing the test agent under study, and the severity of mucosal damage was assessed by using as indicators of mucosal integrity transmucosal potential difference, net flux of Na+, and mucosal permeability to two neutral molecules of different sizes, 3H-H2O and 14C-erythritol. The data indicate that the secondary dihydroxy bile salt, deoxycholate, in its deconjugated form was highly injurious to esophageal mucosa; it was the only test agent that caused gross mucosal lesions during the experiment. The respective conjugated bile salt moiety, taurodeoxycholate, had a weaker effect. Also the primary dihydroxy bile salt, chenodeoxycholate, in its deconjugated form caused moderate damage to the mucosa, whereas its conjugated form, taurochenodeoxycholate, had no effect. The effect of the other three bile salts tested--cholate, taurocholate, and taurolithocholate--was negligible. Trypsin also adversely affected the mucosa, but its effect was weaker than that of deoxycholate. The results suggest that the deconjugated bile salts deoxycholate and chenodeoxycholate (which are formed following bacterial colonization of the upper gastrointestinal tract in the absence of gastric ), the conjugated bile salt taurodeoxycholate, and the proteolytic enzyme trypsin may have significant roles in the pathogenesis of alkaline reflux esophagitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30589376> and  characterization of  bile  transformations.</a></h2><p>The human gut hosts trillions of microorganisms that exert a profound influence on human biology. Gut bacteria communicate with their host by secreting small molecules that can signal to distant organs in the body. Bile acids are one class of these signaling molecules, synthesized by the host and chemically transformed by the gut . Among bile  metabolizers, bile  7-dehydroxylating bacteria are commensals of particular importance as they carry out the 7-dehydroxylation of liver-derived primary bile acids to 7-dehydroxylated bile acids. The latter represents a major fraction of the secondary bile  pool. The microbiology of this group of gut microorganisms is understudied and warrants more attention. Here, we detail the bile  transformations carried out by the 7-dehydroxylating bacterium  and  exhibits not only 7α-dehydroxylating capabilities but also, the ability to oxidize other hydroxyl groups and reduce ketone groups in primary and secondary bile acids. This study revealed 12-oxolithocholic  as a major transient product in the 7α-dehydroxylation of cholic . Furthermore, the  study included complementing a gnotobiotic mouse line (devoid of the ability to 7-dehydroxylate bile acids) with  and investigating its colonization dynamics and bile  transformations. Using NanoSIMS (Nanoscale Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry), we demonstrate that the large intestine constitutes a niche for , where it efficiently 7-dehydroxylates cholic  to deoxycholic . Overall, this work reveals a novel transient species during 7-dehydroxylation as well as provides direct evidence for the colonization and growth of 7-dehydroxylating bacteria in the large intestine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28066726>Functional Intestinal Bile  7α-Dehydroxylation by  Associated with Protection from  Infection in a Gnotobiotic Mouse Model.</a></h2><p>Bile acids, important mediators of lipid absorption, also act as hormone-like regulators and as antimicrobial molecules. In all these functions their potency is modulated by a variety of chemical modifications catalyzed by bacteria of the healthy gut microbiota, generating a complex variety of secondary bile acids. Intestinal commensal organisms are well-adapted to normal concentrations of bile acids in the gut. In contrast, physiological concentrations of the various intestinal bile  species play an important role in the resistance to intestinal colonization by pathogens such as . Antibiotic therapy can perturb the gut microbiota and thereby impair the production of protective secondary bile acids. The most important bile  transformation is 7α-dehydroxylation, producing deoxycholic  (DCA) and  (LCA). The enzymatic pathway carrying out 7α-dehydroxylation is restricted to a narrow phylogenetic group of commensal bacteria, the best-characterized of which is . Like many other intestinal commensal species, 7-dehydroxylating bacteria are understudied . Conventional animals contain variable and uncharacterized indigenous 7α-dehydroxylating organisms that cannot be selectively removed, making controlled colonization with a specific strain in the context of an undisturbed microbiota unfeasible. In the present study, we used a recently established, standardized gnotobiotic mouse model that is stably associated with a simplified murine 12-species "oligo-mouse microbiota" (Oligo-MM). It is representative of the major murine intestinal bacterial phyla, but is deficient for 7α-dehydroxylation. We find that the Oligo-MM consortium carries out bile  deconjugation, a prerequisite for 7α-dehydroxylation, and confers no resistance to  infection (CDI). Amendment of Oligo-MM with  normalized the large intestinal bile  composition by reconstituting 7α-dehydroxylation. These changes had only minor effects on the composition of the native Oligo-MM, but significantly decreased early large intestinal  colonization and pathogenesis. The delayed pathogenesis of  in -colonized mice was associated with breakdown of cecal microbial bile  transformation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29648597>Secondary bile acids inhibit Candida albicans growth and morphogenesis.</a></h2><p>Candida albicans is one of the most common causes of fungal infections in humans with a significant mortality rate. However, the factors involved in C. albicans gastrointestinal (GI)  remain unclear. We hypothesize that secondary bile acids have direct antifungal activity against C. albicans and may play a critical role in maintaining GI  resistance against C. albicans. In this study, we investigated the effect of secondary bile acids including  (LCA) and deoxycholic  (DCA) on C. albicans growth and morphogenesis. Results indicate that LCA and DCA at in vivo cecal micelle concentrations inhibit C. albicans growth in vitro. Interestingly, LCA and DCA also significantly inhibited the germ tube, hyphae and biofilm formation in C. albicans. In addition, pre-treatment of C. albicans with LCA and DCA significantly reduced the percentage of C. albicans cells attached to a colon cancer cell line. Collectively, our results demonstrate that secondary bile acids play an important role in controlling the growth and morphological switching of C. albicans. Results from this study demonstrate that secondary bile  possess direct antifungal activity against C. albicans, explaining a potential mechanism for gastrointestinal  resistance against C. albicans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109795>Shape Follows Function: Gastrointestinal Signals for Enterococcal Colonization.</a></h2><p>Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) is a major cause of nosocomial infections.

The aim of this study was to use microbial metabolic product bile acids to reduce C. jejuni chicken colonization. Broiler chicks were fed with deoxycholic  (DCA),  (LCA), or ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA). The birds were also transplanted with DCA modulated anaerobes (DCA-Anaero) or aerobes (DCA-Aero). The birds were infected with human clinical isolate C. jejuni 81-176 or chicken isolate C. jejuni AR101. Notably, C. jejuni 81-176 was readily colonized intestinal tract at d16 and reached an almost plateau at d21. Remarkably, DCA excluded C. jejuni cecal colonization below the limit of detection at 16 and 28 days of age. Neither chicken ages of infection nor LCA or UDCA altered C. jejuni AR101 chicken colonization level, while DCA reduced 91% of the bacterium in chickens at d28. Notably, DCA diet reduced phylum Firmicutes but increased Bacteroidetes compared to infected control birds. Importantly, DCA-Anaero attenuated 93% of C. jejuni colonization at d28 compared to control infected birds. In conclusion, DCA shapes microbiota composition against C. jejuni colonization in chickens, suggesting a bidirectional interaction between microbiota and microbial metabolites.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31550982>The association between gut  development and maturation of intestinal bile  metabolism in the first 3 y of healthy Japanese infants.</a></h2><p>The gut microbial community greatly changes in early life, influencing infant health and subsequent host physiology, notably through its collective metabolism, including host- interplay of bile  (BA) metabolism. However, little is known regarding how the development of the intestinal microbial community is associated with maturation of intestinal BA metabolism. To address this, we monitored the succession of gut bacterial community and its association with fecal BA profile in the first 3 y of ten healthy Japanese infants. The BA profiles were classified into four types, defined by high content of conjugated primary BA (Con type), unconjugated primary BA (chenodeoxycholic  and cholic ) (Pri type), ursodeoxycholic  (Urs type), and deoxycholic and  (Sec type). Most subjects begun with Con type or Pri type profiles during lactation and eventually transited to Sec type through Urs type after the start of solid food intake. Con type and Pri type were associated with -dominant  corresponding to the neonatal type or -dominant  corresponding to lactation type, respectively. Urs type subjects were strongly associated with  colonization, mostly occurring between Pri type and Sec type. Sec type was associated with adult-type complex  dominated by a variety of  and  species. Addressing the link of the common developmental passage of intestinal BA metabolism with infant's health and subsequent host physiology requires further study.</p></html>
