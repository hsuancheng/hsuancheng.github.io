The consequences of intestinal dysbiosis, such as increased intestinal permeability and altered microbial metabolites, are suspected to contribute to the host inflammatory state and peripheral insulin resistance. Human diabetics have been shown to have changes in bile  (BA) metabolism which may be detrimental to glycemic control. The purpose of this study was to examine BA metabolism in dogs with naturally-occurring, insulin-dependent DM and to relate these findings to changes in the intestinal microbiota. A prospective observational study of adult dogs with a clinical diagnosis of DM ( = 10) and healthy controls (HC,  = 10) was performed. The fecal microbiota were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene next-generation (Illumina) sequencing. Concentrations of fecal unconjugated BA (fUBA) were measured using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Analysis of bacterial communities showed no significant difference for any of the alpha-diversity measures between DM vs. HC dogs. Principal coordinate analysis based on unweighted Unifrac distance metric failed to show significant clustering between dog groups (ANOSIM:  = 0.084;  = 0.114). However, linear discriminate analysis effects size (LEfSe) detected differentially abundant bacterial taxa (α = 0.01, LDA score >2.0) on various phylogenetic levels. While  was overrepresented in dogs with DM, the proportions of Erysipelotrichia, , and  were increased in HC dogs. Dogs with DM had increased concentration of total primary fUBA compared to HC dogs ( = 0.028). The concentrations of cholic  and the cholic  percentage of the total fUBA were increased ( = 0.028 and  = 0.035, respectively) in the feces of DM dogs relative to HC dogs. The levels of  (both absolute value and percentage of the total fUBA) were decreased ( = 0.043 and  < 0.01, respectively) in DM dogs vs. HC dogs. Results indicate that dogs with DM have both intestinal dysbiosis and associated fUBA alterations. The pattern of dysbiosis and altered BA composition is similar to that seen in humans with Type 2 DM. The dog represents a novel large animal model for advancing translational medicine research efforts (e.g., investigating pathogenesis and therapeutics) in DM affecting humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069691>Serum Bile  Levels Before and After Sleeve Gastrectomy and Their Correlation with -Related Comorbidities.</a></h2><p>The rising prevalence of morbid  is increasing the demand for bariatric surgery. The benefits observed after bariatric surgery seems to be not fully explained by surgery-induced weight loss or traditional cardiovascular risk factors regression or improvement. Some evidences suggest that bile  (BA) levels change after bariatric surgery, thus suggesting that BA concentrations could influence some of the metabolic improvement induced by bariatric surgery. In this report, we have characterized circulating BA patterns and compared them to metabolic and vascular parameters before and after sleeve gastrectomy (SG).Seventy-nine subjects (27 males, 52 females, aged 45 ± 12 years, mean BMI 45 ± 7 kg/m) SG candidates were included in the study. Before and about 12 months after SG, all subjects underwent a clinical examination, blood tests (including lipid profile, plasma glucose and insulin, both used for calculating HOMA-IR, and glycated hemoglobin), ultrasound visceral fat area estimation, ultrasound flow-mediated dilation evaluation, and determination of plasma BA concentrations.Before SG, both primary and secondary BA levels were higher in insulin-resistant obese subjects than in non-insulin resistant obese, and BA were positively associated with the markers of insulin-resistance. After SG, total (conjugated and unconjugated) cholic acids significantly decreased (p 0.007), and total  acids significantly increased (p 0.017). SG-induced total cholic and chenodeoxycholic  changes were directly associated with surgery-induced glycemia (p 0.011 and 0.033 respectively) and HOMA-IR (p 0.016 and 0.012 respectively) changes.Serum BA are associated with glucose metabolism and particularly with markers of insulin-resistance. SG modifies circulating BA pool size and composition. SG-induced BA changes are associated with insulin-resistance amelioration. In conclusion, an interplay between glucose metabolism and circulating BA exists but further studies are needed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819989>Bile acids are nutrient signaling hormones.</a></h2><p>Bile salts play crucial roles in allowing the gastrointestinal system to digest, transport and metabolize nutrients. They function as nutrient signaling hormones by activating specific nuclear receptors (FXR, PXR, Vitamin D) and G-protein coupled receptors [TGR5, sphingosine-1 phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2), muscarinic receptors]. Bile acids and insulin appear to collaborate in regulating the metabolism of nutrients in the liver. They both activate the AKT and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Bile  induction of the FXR-α target gene, small heterodimer partner (SHP), is highly dependent on the activation PKCζ, a branch of the insulin signaling pathway. SHP is an important regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism in the liver. One might hypothesize that chronic low grade inflammation which is associated with insulin resistance, may inhibit bile  signaling and disrupt lipid metabolism. The disruption of these signaling pathways may increase the risk of fatty liver and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Finally, conjugated bile acids appear to promote cholangiocarcinoma growth via the activation of S1PR2.Copyright © 2014.

The objective of the present study was to investigate whether the type and level of fiber had an effect on cecal BA composition when included in low- and high-fat diets. Groups of rats were fed two barley varieties, which resulted in three test diets containing three levels of β-glucans and two levels of dietary fiber. BAs were preconcentrated using hollow fiber liquid-phase microextraction and quantified by gas chromatography. The amount of the secondary BAs, -, deoxycholic- and hyodexycholic acids was generally higher in groups fed high-fat diets compared with corresponding acids in groups fed low-fat diets (P<.05). In contrast, most of the primary and the secondary BAs, ursodeoxycholic  and β- and ω-muricholic acids, were two to five times higher (P<.05) in groups fed low-fat diets than in groups fed high-fat diets. This was particularly true for groups fed the highest level of β-glucans and in some cases also the medium level. The BA profile in the gut was strongly dependent on the amount and type of dietary fiber in the diet, which may be useful in the prevention/treatment of diseases associated with changes in BA profiles.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

The modulation of gut microbiota, bile acids and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) axis is correlated with -induced insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in mice. However, the interactions among the gut microbiota, bile acids and FXR in metabolic disorders remained largely unexplored in hamsters. In the current study, hamsters fed a 60% high-fat diet (HFD) were administered vehicle or an antibiotic cocktail by gavage twice a week for four weeks. Antibiotic treatment alleviated HFD-induced glucose intolerance, hepatic steatosis and inflammation accompanied with decreased hepatic lipogenesis and elevated thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT). In the livers of antibiotic-treated hamsters, cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily B member 1 (CYP7B1) in the alternative bile  synthesis pathway was upregulated, contributing to a more hydrophilic bile  profile with increased tauro--muricholic  (TMCA). The intestinal FXR signaling was suppressed but remained unchanged in the liver. This study is of potential translational significance in determining the role of gut microbiota-mediated bile  metabolism in modulating diet-induced glucose intolerance and hepatic steatosis in the hamster.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18209481>Taurolithocholic -3 sulfate impairs  signaling in cultured rat hepatocytes and perfused rat liver.</a></h2><p>The role of bile acids for  in cholestatic liver disease is unknown.The effect of taurolithocholic -3 sulfate (TLCS) on  signaling was studied in cultured rat hepatocytes and perfused rat liver.TLCS induced  at the level of  receptor (IR) beta Tyr(1158) phosphorylation, phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase activity and protein kinase (PK)B Ser(473) phosphorylation in cultured hepatocytes. Consistently, the  stimulation of the PI 3-kinase-dependent K(+) uptake, hepatocyte swelling and proteolysis inhibition was blunted by TLCS in perfused rat liver. The PKC inhibitor Go6850 and tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDC) counteracted the suppression of -induced IRbeta and PKB phosphorylation by TLCS. Rapamycin and dibutyryl-cAMP, which inhibited basal signaling via mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), restored -induced PKB- but not IRbeta phosphorylation. In livers from 7 day bile duct-ligated rats PKB Ser(473) phosphorylation was decreased by about 50%.TLCS induces  by a PKC-dependent suppression of -induced IRbeta phosphorylation and the PI 3-kinase/PKB path. This can in part be compensated by a decrease of mTOR activity, which may release -sensitive components downstream of the  receptor from tonic inhibition. The data suggest that retention of hydrophobic bile acids confers  on the cholestatic liver.</p></html>
