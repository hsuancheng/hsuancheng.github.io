<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22210717>Non-invasive monitoring of immunization progress in mice via IgG from feces.</a></h2><p>A non-invasive method to monitor the humoral immune response in mice after immunization is described. From fecal pellets of an individual mouse, a sufficient amount of active immunoglobulins or their fragments can be extracted to perform a regular examination of the status of the immune response by immunoassay. Hapten-specific antibodies from the feces of mice from three immunization trials showed very similar characteristics to those obtained from serum at a given date. Therefore, it can be suspected that some serum IgG enters the intestinal lumen and ends up in the feces, where they appear to be considerably stable. Hapten-specific IgAs were not found in the feces. Being able to analyze antibody titers in feces could be an interesting animal welfare refinement to standard practice that does not entail repeated blood sampling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/929102>Radioimmunoassay of serum-conjugated deoxycholic .</a></h2><p>A specific, sensitive, and reliable radioimmunoassay for serum-conjugated deoxycholic  has been developed with antiserum obtained after immunization of rabbits with deoxycholic --bovine serum albumin conjugate. The displacement curve of glyco [3H] deoxycholic  was linear on a logit-log plot from 7.5 to 320 pmol of unlabeled glycodeoxycholic . At 50% displacement of bound label, the cross-reactivity of taurodeoxycholic  was 100%, deoxycholic  30%, taurocholic  3%, and glycocholic  2%. No cross-reactivity was observed with free cholic , conjugated or free chenodeoxycholic acids and conjugated or free  acids. Fasting serum-conjugated deoxycholic  concentrations in 10 healthy volunteers ranged from 0.18 to 0.92 mumol/1. Over a period of 5 hours following 0.5 g oral cholate administration the serum-conjugated deoxycholic  concentration did not change in 5 fasting healthy persons, whereas an initial increase of serum cholic  was observed.</p></html>
