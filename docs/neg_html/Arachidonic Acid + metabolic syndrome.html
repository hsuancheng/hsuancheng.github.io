Control (C), glucomannan (G) and glucomannan/spirulina (GS)-RP; HC (cholesterol-enriched control), HG and HGS (cholesterol-enriched glucomannan and glucomannan/spirulina-RP) experimental diets were tested. Increased  markers were found in C, G and GS rats. Cholesterol feeding increased liver size, fat, and cholesterol and reduced antioxidant enzyme levels and expressions. Cholesterolemia was lower in HG and HGS than in HC. GS vs. G showed higher stearic but lower oleic levels. SFA and PUFA decreased while MUFA increased by cholesterol feeding. The /linoleic and docosahexaenoic/alpha-linolenic ratios were lower in HC, HG, and HGS vs. C, G, and GS, respectively, suggesting a delta-6-elongase-desaturase system inhibition. Moreover, cholesterol feeding, mainly in HGS, decreased low-density-lipoprotein receptor expression and the delta-5-desaturase activity and increased the delta-9-desaturase activity. In conclusion, the liver production of highly unsaturated fatty acids was limited to decrease their oxidation in presence of hypercholesterolaemia. Glucomannan or glucomannan/spirulina-RP has added new attributes to their functional properties in meat, partially arresting the negative effects induced by high-fat-high-cholesterol feeding on the liver fatty  and antioxidant statuses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27155920>The role of free fatty acids in the inflammatory and cardiometabolic profile in adolescents with  engaged in interdisciplinary therapy.</a></h2><p>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate if interdisciplinary therapy can influence the cardiometabolic and serum free fatty  profile. The second aim was to evaluate if there is an association between serum free fatty acids, inflammation and cardiometabolic biomarkers in obese adolescents with and without  submitted to a long-term interdisciplinary therapy. The study involved 108 postpuberty obese adolescents, who were divided according to  (MetS) diagnosis: MetS (n=32) and Non-MetS (n=76). The interdisciplinary therapy consisted of a 1-year period of nutrition, psychology, physical exercise and clinical support. After therapy, both groups improved , inflammatory (leptin, adiponectin, leptin/adiponectin ratio, adiponectin/leptin ratio and C-reactive protein) and cardiometabolic profile (PAI-1 and ICAM).  prevalence reduced from 28.70% to 12.96%. Both groups reduced myristic  (C14:0) and increased docosahexaenoic  (DHA, C22:6n3), heneicosapentaenoic  (HPA, C21:5n3) and  (C20:4n6). After adjustment for  and the number of  parameters, multiple regression analysis showed that changes in VCAM and PAI-1 were negatively associated with changes in cis-linoleic  (C18:2n6c). Additionally, changes in trans-linoleic  (C18:2n6t) were also positively associated with these biomarkers. Moreover, leptin and leptin/adiponectin ratio were negatively associated with changes in docosapentaenoic  (DPA, C22:5n3) and stearidonic  (SDA, C18:4n3). Adiponectin/leptin ratio was positively associated with docosapentaenoic  (DPA, C22:5n3). Changes in adiponectin were positively correlated with changes in omega 3, such as heneicosapentaenoic  (HPA, C21:5n3) and docosapentaenoic  (DPA, C22:5n3). Results support that interdisciplinary therapy can control inflammatory and cardiometabolic profile in obese adolescents. Moreover, serum fatty acids can be influenced by lifestyle changes and are able to modulate these biomarkers.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we investigated how the increased circulating estrogen-to-androgen ratio (E/A) alters liver lipid metabolism in males. The cytochrome P450 aromatase (P450arom) is an enzyme converting androgens to estrogens. Male mice overexpressing human aromatase enzyme (AROM+ mice), and thus have high circulating E/A, were used as a model in this study. Proteomics and gene expression analyses indicated an increase in the peroxisomal β-oxidation in the liver of AROM+ mice as compared with their wild type littermates. Correspondingly, metabolomic analysis revealed a decrease in the amount of phosphatidylcholines with long-chain fatty acids in the plasma. With interest we noted that the expression of Cyp4a12a enzyme, which specifically metabolizes  (AA) to 20-hydroxy AA, was dramatically decreased in the AROM+ liver. As a consequence, increased amounts of phospholipids having AA as a fatty  tail were detected in the plasma of the AROM+ mice. Overall, these observations demonstrate that high circulating E/A in males is linked to indicators of higher peroxisomal β-oxidation and lower AA metabolism in the liver. Furthermore, the plasma phospholipid profile reflects the changes in the liver lipid metabolism.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of our work was to assess the fatty , oxylipin and phenolic composition using gas chromatography (GC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS), ultra- high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to MS and HPLC coupled to diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). Additionally, various antioxidant activities were assessed. The inhibition of α-glucosidase, α-amylase, lipase, cyclooxygenases-1 and -2 (COX-1/COX-2), and lipoxygenase was determined. The main fatty acids were oleic and 7-hexadecenoic acids. Eight phytoprostanes and three phytofurans were identified and quantified. Hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids were the main phenolic compounds. Oils showed antioxidant activity determined by EPR, and inhibition of COX-1/COX-2. The statistical analysis showed that the roasting does not affect the composition of the samples. The occurrence of oxylipins in this species is reported for the first time.

Due to a key role in the metabolism of unsaturated fatty acids such as , one of the most important precursors of immunity mediators, fatty  desaturase (FADS) genes could have an important impact in the development of type 2 diabetes.This study aimed to determine the relationship between polymorphisms rs174537 in FADS1 gene and rs174575 in FADS2 gene with type 2 diabetes in Iranian population. After extracting genomic DNA, the locations of mutations and allele types were identified with high-resolution melting (HRM)-polymerase chain reaction method. Then, association between these mutations with , dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes was investigated using χ correlation coefficients for variables and logistic regression.The results showed that among 50 diabetic participants, 68% of patients have the mutant allele for rs174537 in FADS1 gene. This rate is 26% for rs174575 in FADS2 gene. Based on the results, it seems that participants having rs174537 mutant allele are more prone to become diabetic but it has a beneficial effect on total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and participants having rs174575 mutant are less prone to become diabetic, and also, it leads to higher triglycerides and body mass index (obesity).Detecting FADS1 and FADS2, gene polymorphisms using HRM can be an anticipating tool for making decision on initiating lifestyle modifications to prevent type 2 diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27555877>The effects of prenatal metformin on obesogenic diet-induced alterations in maternal and fetal fatty  metabolism.</a></h2><p>Maternal obesity may program the fetus and increase the susceptibility of the offspring to adult diseases. Metformin crosses the placenta and has been associated with decreased inflammation and reversal of fatty liver in obese leptin-deficient mice. We investigated the effects of metformin on maternal and fetal lipid metabolism and hepatic inflammation using a rat model of diet-induced obesity during pregnancy.Female Wistar rats (6-7 weeks old) were fed normal or high calorie diets for 5 weeks. After mating with normal-diet fed males, half of the high calorie-fed dams received metformin (300 mg/kg, daily); dams (8 per group) continued diets through gestational day 19. Maternal and fetal livers and fetal brains were analyzed for fatty acids and for fatty  metabolism-related gene expression. Data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by Dunnett's post hoc testing.When compared to control-lean maternal livers, obesogenic-diet-exposed maternal livers showed significantly higher saturated fatty acids (14:0 and 16:0) and monounsaturated fatty acids (16:1n7 and 18:1n9) and lower polyunsaturated (18:2n6 and 20:4n6 []) and anti-inflammatory n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (18:3n3 and 22:6n3 [docosahexaenoic ]) (p < 0.05). Metformin did not affect diet-induced changes in maternal livers. Fetal livers exposed to the high calorie diet showed significantly increased saturated fatty acids (18:0) and monounsaturated fatty acids (18:1n9 and 18:1n7) and decreased polyunsaturated fatty acids (18:2n6, 20:4n6 and 22:6n3) and anti-inflammatory n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, along with increased gene expression of fatty  metabolism markers (Fasn, D5d, D6d, Scd1, Lxrα). Metformin significantly attenuated diet-induced inflammation and 18:1n9 and 22:6n3 in fetal livers, as well as n3 fatty acids (p < 0.05). Prenatal obesogenic diet exposure significantly increased fetal liver IFNγ levels (p < 0.05), which was reversed by maternal metformin treatment (p < 0.05).Consumption of a high calorie diet significantly affected maternal and fetal fatty  metabolism. It reduced anti-inflammatory polyunsaturated fatty acids in maternal and fetal livers, altered gene expression of fatty  metabolism markers, and induced inflammation in the fetal livers. Prenatal metformin attenuated some diet-induced fatty  changes and inflammation in the fetal livers without affecting maternal livers, suggesting that maternal metformin may impact fetal/neonatal fatty /lipid metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24355403>Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids during gestation and lactation to a vitamin B12-deficient or -supplemented diet improves pregnancy outcome and  variables in Wistar rats.</a></h2><p>Maternal vitamin B12 deficiency leads to an adverse pregnancy outcome and increases the risk for developing diabetes and  in mothers in later life. Our earlier studies have demonstrated that vitamin B12 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are interlinked in the one carbon cycle. The present study for the first time examines the effect of maternal n-3 PUFA supplementation to vitamin B12 deficient or supplemented diets on pregnancy outcome, fatty- status and  variables in Wistar rats. Pregnant dams were assigned to one of the following groups: control, vitamin B12 deficient, vitamin B12 supplemented, vitamin B12 deficient + n-3 PUFA or vitamin B12 supplemented + n-3 PUFA. The amount of vitamin B12 in the supplemented group was 0.50 μg kg(-1) diet and n-3 PUFA was alpha linolenic  (ALA) 1.68, eicosapentaenoic  5.64, docosahexaenoic  (DHA) 3.15 (g per 100g fatty acids per kg diet). Our findings indicate that maternal vitamin B12 supplementation did not affect the weight gain of dams during pregnancy but reduced litter size and weight and was ameliorated by n-3 PUFA supplementation. Vitamin B12 deficiency or supplementation resulted in a low percentage distribution of plasma  and DHA. n-3 PUFA supplementation to these diets improved the fatty- status. Vitamin B12 deficiency resulted in higher homocysteine and insulin levels, which were normalised by supplementation with either vitamin B12 or n-3 PUFA. Our study suggests that maternal vitamin B12 status is critical in determining pregnancy outcome and  variables in dams and that supplementation with n-3 PUFA is beneficial.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30594827>Comparative analysis of the compatibility effects of Danggui-Sini Decoction on a blood stasis  rat model using untargeted metabolomics.</a></h2><p>Danggui-Sini Decoction (DSD) is one of the most widely used traditional Chinese medicine formulae (TCMF) for treating various diseases caused by cold coagulation and blood stasis due to its effect of nourishing blood to warm meridians in clinical use. However, studies of the mechanism of how it dispels blood stasis and its compatible regularity are challenging because of the complex pathophysiology of blood stasis  (BSS) and the complexity of DSD, with multiple active ingredients acting on different targets. Observing variations of endogenous metabolites in rats with BSS after administering DSD may further our understanding of the mechanism of BSS and the compatible regularity of DSD. In this study, to understand the pathogenesis of BSS and assess the compatibility effects of DSD, an ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics approach was used. Serum  profiles in rats with BSS that was induced by an ice water bath associated with subcutaneous injection of epinephrine hydrochloride were compared with the intervention groups which were administered with DSD or its compatibility. Using pattern recognition analysis, a clear separation between the BSS model and control group was observed; DSD and its compatibility intervention groups were clustered closer toward the control than the model group, which corroborates results of hemorheology studies. In addition, 20 metabolites were considered as potential biomarkers associated with the development of BSS. Nine metabolites were regulated by DSD in intervening blood stasis, they were considered to be correlated with the effect of nourishing blood to warm meridians. Additionally, the results suggested that the intervention effect of DSD on BSS may involve regulating four pathways, namely,  metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, bile  biosynthesis, and pyruvate metabolism. Moreover, each functional unit (monarch, minister, and assistant) in DSD regulates different metabolites and  pathways to achieve different effects on dispelling blood stasis; however, their intervention efficacies are inferior to the holistic formula, which may be due to the synergism of the bioactive ingredients in seven herbs of DSD. This study demonstrated that metabolomics is a powerful tool for evaluating the efficacy and compatibility effects of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We aimed to reveal the correlation between the endocannabinoid system and PCOS, which may provide a new therapeutic target for PCOS treatment.Serum levels of anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol andexpression of cannabinoid receptors and fatty  amide hydrolase (FAAH) in the endometrium were compared between women with PCOS and infertile women without PCOS, as well as women with PCOS before and after treatment with Diane-35 and metformin. Cannabinoid receptors and FAAH in the endometrium were stained using the immunohistochemical method. Results were analyzed by calculating integrated optical density.Plasma anandamide was increased significantly in women with PCOS compared with infertile women without PCOS. Treatment with Diane-35 and metformin reversed this increase in women with PCOS. No significant difference in 2-arachidonoylglycerol was observed between the infertile women with or without PCOS. The women with PCOS had lower endometrial expression of FAAH compared with infertile women without PCOS, whereas no significant difference in endometrial expression of cannabinoid receptors was observed between the women with PCOS and infertile women without PCOS. We found that after treatment with Diane-35 and metformin, FAAH expression tended toward a significant increase compared with women before the treatment.Endocannabinoid system may be involved in the progression of PCOS, and serum anandamide could serve as a potential biomarker of clinical diagnosis of PCOS.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

Ultra performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) was conducted on plasma metabolites of normal and model rats. Principal component analysis (PCA), differentiation analysis of supervised partial least squares method (PLS-DA), and orthogonal to partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) on metabolomics data for multidimensional statistical analysis were employed, and the resulting biomarkers were screened. Compared to the normal group, there were 46 endogenous metabolites in blood stasis-rat plasma. Of these, 21 metabolites were significantly upregulated, such as acetylcholine, 6,6,6-trimethyl-L-lysine, cytosine, and acetylcarnitine, while 25 metabolites were reduced, including indoleacrylic , and lysoPC(14:0). These metabolites were mainly related to  pathways, including lipid metabolism, galactose metabolism, linoleic  metabolism, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, glycolysis, and  metabolism. In conclusion, these results indicated that metabolites could be used as important biomarkers for blood stasis , and could help in revealing the mechanism of blood stasis disease and provide a reference network to determine the disease development stage and appropriate follow-up treatment.

Acute blood stasis  was induced by placing the rats in ice-cold water following two injections with epinephrine. The hemorheological indicators [whole blood viscosity (WBV) and plasma viscosity (PV)] and the blood coagulation indicators [thrombin time (TT), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and fibrinogen (FIB)] were detected. The nonparametric univariate method and multivariate statistical analysis were performed for determining the potential biomarkers. A correlation map was structured between biochemical indicators and hub metabolites to explain the effects mechanism of THSWD. After the administration of THSWD, the levels of WBV, PV, TT, APTT and FIB returned to levels observed in the control group. According to metabolomics coupled with  network analysis, the intervention of THSWD in rats with acute blood stasis  induced substantial and characteristic changes in their  profiles. Fifteen metabolites were screened, which mainly involved 10 pathways and five hub metabolites, namely, l-glutamate, l-phenylalanine, N-acylsphingosine,  and phosphatidate. The biochemical indicators and hub metabolites could be adjusted to close to normal levels by THSWD. Therefore, combining metabolomics and  network helped to evaluate the effects of THSWD on acute blood stasis.Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29581223>Beneficial Pleiotropic Antidepressive Effects of Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factor Interventions in the .</a></h2><p>Although the increased prevalence and severity of clinical depression and elevated cardiovascular disease risk represent 2 vexing public health issues, the growing awareness of their combined presentation compounds the challenge. The obese Zucker rat, a model of the , spontaneously develops significant depressive symptoms in parallel with the progression of the  and, thus, represents a compelling model for study. The primary objective was to assess the impact on both cardiovascular outcomes, specifically vascular structure and function, and depressive symptoms in obese Zucker rats after aggressive treatment for cardiovascular disease risk factors with long-term exercise or targeted pharmacological interventions.We chronically treated obese Zucker rats with clinically relevant interventions against cardiovascular disease risk factors to determine impacts on vascular outcomes and depressive symptom severity. While most of the interventions (chronic exercise, anti-hypertensive, the interventions (long-term exercise, antihypertensive, antidyslipidemia, and antidiabetic) were differentially effective at improving vascular outcomes, only those that also resulted in a significant improvement to oxidant stress, inflammation,  metabolism (prostacyclin versus thromboxane A), and their associated sequelae were effective at also blunting depressive symptom severity. Using multivariable analyses, discrimination between the effectiveness of treatment groups to maintain behavioral outcomes appeared to be dependent on breaking the cycle of inflammation and oxidant stress, with the associated outcomes of improving endothelial metabolism and both cerebral and peripheral vascular structure and function.This initial study provides a compelling framework from which to further interrogate the links between cardiovascular disease risk factors and depressive symptoms and suggests mechanistic links and potentially effective avenues for intervention.© 2018 The Authors.

Cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenases metabolize  into bioactive epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which have potent anti-inflammatory and protective effects. However, the functional relevance of the CYP epoxyeicosanoid metabolism pathway in the pathogenesis of NASH remains poorly understood. Our studies demonstrate that both mice with methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet-induced NASH and humans with biopsy-confirmed NASH exhibited significantly higher free EET concentrations compared to healthy controls. Targeted disruption of Ephx2 (the gene encoding for soluble epoxide hydrolase) in mice further increased EET levels and significantly attenuated MCD diet-induced hepatic steatosis, inflammation and injury, as well as high fat diet-induced adipose tissue inflammation, systemic glucose intolerance and hepatic steatosis. Collectively, these findings suggest that dysregulation of the CYP epoxyeicosanoid pathway is a key pathological consequence of NASH in vivo, and promoting the anti-inflammatory and protective effects of EETs warrants further investigation as a novel therapeutic strategy for NASH.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We characterized the pharmacodynamics of a novel dual-antiplatelet-therapy regimen consisting of very-low-dose twice-daily (BD) aspirin with standard-dose ticagrelor. A total of 20 ticagrelor-treated ACS patients entered a randomized crossover to take aspirin 20 mg BD (12-hourly) during one 14-day period and 75 mg once-daily (OD) in the other. After 14 days of treatment, serum thromboxane (TX)B and light-transmittance aggregometry were assessed pre- and 2 h post-morning-dose, bleeding time was measured post-dose, and TXA and prostacyclin stable metabolites were measured in urine collected 2 h post-morning-dose. Data are expressed as mean ± SD. After 14 days treatment, serum TXB levels were significantly greater 2 h post-dosing with aspirin 20 mg BD vs. 75 mg OD (3.0 ± 3.6 ng/mL vs. 0.8 ± 1.9 ng/mL; p = 0.018) whereas pre-dosing levels were not significantly different (3.5 ± 4.1 ng/mL vs. 2.5 ± 3.1 ng/mL, p = 0.23). 1-mmol/L -induced platelet aggregation was similarly inhibited by both regimens pre-dose (8.5 ± 14.3% vs. 5.1 ± 3.6%, p = 0.24) and post-dose (8.7 ± 14.2% vs. 6.6 ± 5.3%; p = 0.41). Post-dose bleeding time was shorter with 20 mg BD (680 ± 306 s vs. 834 ± 386 s, p = 0.02). Urinary prostacyclin and TX metabolite excretion were not significantly different. In conclusion, compared to aspirin 75 mg OD, aspirin 20 mg BD provided consistent inhibition of platelet TXA release and aggregation, and improved post-dose hemostasis, in ticagrelor-treated ACS patients.

NAFLD is the most common cause of liver disease in the United States, affecting up to a third of the general population. It is commonly associated with features of , particularly insulin resistance. NAFLD shares the basic pathogenic mechanisms with obesity and insulin resistance, such as mitochondrial, oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Lipoxygenases catalyze the conversion of poly-unsaturated fatty acids in the plasma membrane-mainly  and linoleic -to produce oxidized pro-inflammatory lipid intermediates. 12-Lipoxygenase (12-LOX) has been studied extensively in setting of inflammation and insulin resistance. As insulin resistance is closely associated with development of NAFLD, the role of 12-LOX in pathogenesis of NAFLD has received increasing attention in recent years.

However, limited information exists on how the response to dietary intake of linoleic  (LA; 18:2n-6) is modified by polymorphisms in the fatty  desaturase (FADS) gene cluster.The aim of the current study was to test the hypothesis that the FADS1 rs174550 genotype modifies the effect of dietary LA intake on the fatty  composition of plasma lipids, fasting glucose, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP).Associations were investigated between genotype, plasma PUFAs, fasting glucose, and hsCRP concentrations in the cross-sectional, population-based  in Men cohort (n = 1337). In addition, 62 healthy men from the cohort who were homozygotes for the TT or CC genotype of the FADS1 rs174550 were recruited to a 4-wk intervention (FADSDIET) with an LA-enriched diet. The fatty  composition of plasma PUFAs and concentrations of plasma fasting glucose, serum hsCRP, and plasma lipid mediators (eicosanoids and related analogs) were measured at the beginning and end of the 4-wk intervention period.In the FADSDIET trial, the plasma LA proportion increased in both genotype groups in response to an LA-enriched diet. Responses in concentrations of serum hsCRP and plasma fasting glucose and the proportion of  (20:4n-6) in plasma phospholipids and cholesteryl esters differed between genotype groups (interaction of diet × genotype, P < 0.05).

The aim of this study was to compare both profiles and to highlight the differences that could influence the improvement of the treatment of patients in both groups. The study involved 73 women, including 24 patients with chronic kidney disease treated with haemodialysis, 19 patients with  (MetS), and 30 healthy women in the control group. A total of 35 fatty acids and derivatives were identified and quantified by gas chromatography. Intensified elongation processes from  C10:0 to C16:0 were noted in both groups (more intense in MetS), as well as an increased synthesis of  (C20:4n6), which was more intense in CKD. Significant correlations of oleic  (C18:1n9), gamma linoleic  (C18:3n6), and docosatetraenoate  (C22:4n6) with parameters of CKD patients were observed. In the MetS group, auxiliary  pathways of oleic  were activated, which simultaneously inhibited the synthesis of eicosapentanoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) from alpha lipoic  (ALA). On the other hand, in the group of female patients with CKD, the synthesis of EPA and DHA was intensified. Activation of the synthesis of oleic  (C18: 1n9 ct) and trans-vaccinic  (C18:1) is a protective mechanism in kidney diseases and especially in MetS due to the increased concentration of saturated fatty  (SFA) in plasma. The cause of the increased amount of all FAs in plasma in the CKD group, especially in the case of palmitic (C16:0) and derivatives stearic (C18:0) acids, may be the decomposition of adipose tissue and the progressing devastation of the organism, whereas, in the MetS group, dietary intake seems to be the main reason for the increase in SFA. Moreover, in MetS, auxiliary  pathways are activated for oleic , which cause the simultaneous inhibition of EPA and DHA synthesis from ALA, whereas, in the CKD group, we observe an increased synthesis of EPA and DHA. The higher increase of nervonic  (C24:1) in CKD suggests a higher degree of demyelination and loss of axons.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29138692>Transcriptomics-driven lipidomics (TDL) identifies the microbiome-regulated targets of ileal lipid metabolism.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiome and lipid metabolism are both recognized as essential components in the maintenance of  health.

Their immunomodulatory effects are numerous and are not always mediated by cannabinoid receptors, reflecting the presence of an  (AA) molecule in their structure, the latter being the precursor of numerous bioactive lipids that are pro- or anti-inflammatory. 2-AG and AEA can thus serve as a source of AA but can also be metabolized by most eicosanoid biosynthetic enzymes, yielding additional lipids. In this regard, enhancing endocannabinoid levels by using endocannabinoid hydrolysis inhibitors is likely to augment the levels of these lipids that could regulate inflammatory cell functions.

Cardiac EETs reduce infarct size after ischemia-reperfusion injury and decrease fibrosis and inflammation in heart failure. In diabetes, EETs improve insulin sensitivity, increase glucose tolerance, and reduce the renal injury. These actions of EETs emphasize their therapeutic potential. To minimize  inactivation, 14,15-EET agonist analogs with stable epoxide bioisosteres and carboxyl surrogates were developed. In preclinical rat models, a subset of agonist analogs, termed EET-A, EET-B, and EET-C22, are orally active with good pharmacokinetic properties. These orally active EET agonists lower blood pressure and reduce cardiac and renal injury in spontaneous and angiotensin hypertension. Other beneficial cardiovascular actions include improved endothelial function and cardiac antiremodeling actions.

However, the role of 20-HETE in the regulation of large artery remodeling in  has not been investigated. We hypothesized that elevated 20-HETE in  increases matrix metalloproteinase 12 (MMP12) activation leading to increased degradation of elastin, increased large artery stiffness and increased systolic blood pressure. 20-HETE production was increased ~7 fold in large, conduit arteries of  (JCR:LA-cp, JCR) vs. normal Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. This correlated with increased elastin degradation (~7 fold) and decreased arterial compliance (~75% JCR vs. SD). 20-HETE antagonists blocked elastin degradation in JCR rats concomitant with blocking MMP12 activation. 20-HETE antagonists normalized, and MMP12 inhibition (pharmacological and MMP12-shRNA-Lnv) significantly improved (~50% vs. untreated JCR) large artery compliance in JCR rats. 20-HETE antagonists also decreased systolic (182 ± 3 mmHg JCR, 145 ± 3 mmHg JCR + 20-HETE antagonists) but not diastolic blood pressure in JCR rats.

The present cross-sectional study has been conducted to evaluate platelet reactivity and the expression of platelet activation markers (8-iso-prostaglandin F2α[8-iso-PGF2α] and 11-dehydro-thromboxane-B₂[11-dehydro-TXB2]) in KS patients and healthy controls. Twenty-three consecutive KS patients under testosterone replacement therapy have been included as case group and 46 age-matched healthy males recruited among hospital staff served as controls. Light transmission aggregometry was performed in both cases and controls and maximal platelet aggregation (max-A%) was defined as maximal light transmittance reached within 5 min after the addition of 0.2 or 0.4 mm  (AA). A ≥ 50% irreversible light transmittance (LT-50%) following platelet stimulation defined an adequate platelet aggregation and AC-50% was defined as the minimal agonist concentration needed to achieve LT-50%. The AC-50% was 0.26 mm AA for KS and 0.36 mm for controls (p < 0.001). Whereas AA (0.2 mm) induced LT-50% in 69.6% of KS and in 15.2% of controls (p < 0.001), the stimulation with AA (0.4 mm) determined LT-50% in all cases and controls. However, max-A% was higher in KS than in controls both after AA (0.2 mm) (65.61% vs. 46.30%, p = 0.002,) and after AA (0.4 mm) (96.43% vs. 81.04%, p < 0.001). 8-iso-PGF2α and 11-dehydro-TXB2 were higher in KS than in controls (446.54 pg/mg creatinine vs. 230.00 pg/mg creatinine, p < 0.001 and 1278.36 pg/mg creatinine vs. 595.08 pg/mg creatinine, p = 0.001, respectively) and AC-50% inversely correlated with 8-iso-PGF2α (ρ = -0.548, p < 0.001) and with 11-dehydro-TXB2 (ρ = -0.523, p < 0.001). In a linear regression model, KS independently predicted a lower AC-50% (β = -0.597, p < 0.001) and higher levels of 8-iso-PGF2α (β = 0.709, p < 0.001) and 11-dehydro-TXB2 (β = 0.605, p < 0.001). In contrast, no correlation has been found between max-A%, testosterone and estradiol levels in KS. We observed increased platelet reactivity in KS.

Conversion of  epoxides to diols by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) diminishes the beneficial cardiovascular properties of these epoxyeicosanoids. We therefore examined the possible biochemical consequences of sEH deletion on vascular responses in male and female mice. Through the use of the sEH KO mouse, we provide evidence of differences in the compensatory response in the balance between nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), EETs and the vasoconstrictor 20-HETE in male and female KO mice. Serum levels of adiponectin, TNFα, IL-1b and MCP1 and protein expression in vascular tissue of p-AMPK, p-AKT and p-eNOS were measured. Deletion of sEH caused a significant (p<0.05) decrease in body weight, and an increase in adiponectin, pAMPK and pAKT levels in female KO mice compared to male KO mice. Gene deletion resulted in a higher production of renal EETs in female KO compared to male KO mice and, concomitantly, we observed an increase in renal 20-HETEs levels and superoxide anion production only in male KO mice. sEH deletion increased p-AKT and p-eNOS protein expression but decreased p-AMPK levels in female KO mice. Increased levels of p-eNOS at Thr-495 were observed only in KO male mice. While p-eNOS at 1177 were not significantly different between male and female. Nitric oxide production was unaltered in male KO mice. These results provide evidence of gender differences in the preservation of vascular homeostasis in response to sEH deletion which involves regulation of phosphorylation of eNOS at the 495 site.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Non-polar lipids were measured with high-performance liquid chromotography followed by mass spectrometry.All non-polar lipids increased in RBCs after 21 days of storage compared to baseline. The non-polar lipid concentration in plasma increased significantly, and the increase was even more pronounced in products stored at 20°C. In platelets, baseline levels of 5-HETE and 15-HETE were higher than in RBCs or plasma. However, the non-polar lipids did not change significantly during storage of PLT products. Infusion of RBCs with increased levels of non-polar lipids did not induce TRALI in LPS-primed human volunteers.We conclude that non-polar lipids accumulate in RBC and plasma transfusion products and that accumulation is temperature dependent.

A combined antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and a P2Y antagonist) is commonly used to prevent re-infarction in ACS patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Clopidogrel, a P2Y antagonist, plays an important role in the inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA). However, it is a pro-drug requiring biotransformation by cytochrome P450 (CYP450). The aim of this study is to unravel the effect of clopidogrel-associated genetic variants on inhibition of platelet activity and clinical outcomes in ACS patients. In our study, a total of 196 patients with  gene polymorphism of clopidogrel were enrolled, and their antiplatelet effect as well as their cardiovascular events were collected. Approximately 2 mL of venous blood samples were used for genotype detection and another 4 mL were collected for platelet reactivity with thrombelastography. The primary clinical end-point was defined as a combination of cardiovascular mortality and revascularization for targeted vascular lesion. Based on the results of IPA, the prevalence of high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HPR) was 17.3% and the majority of patients (82.7%) obtained normal on-treatment platelet reactivity (NPR). The HPR group had significantly higher body mass index (BMI) and lower  (AA) induced IPA (P < 0.05). Therapy including Glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa antagonist increased IPA (P < 0.05).

Fatty  translocase (FAT/CD36), whose expression is inducible in obesity, is known for its function in fatty  uptake. Previous work by us and others suggested that CD36 plays an important role in hepatic lipid homeostasis, but the results have been conflicting and the mechanisms were not well understood. In this study, by using CD36-overexpressing transgenic (CD36Tg) mice, we uncovered a surprising function of CD36 in regulating glycogen homeostasis. Overexpression of CD36 promoted glycogen synthesis, and as a result, CD36Tg mice were protected from fasting hypoglycemia. When challenged with a high-fat diet (HFD), CD36Tg mice showed unexpected attenuation of hepatic steatosis, increased very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion, and improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. The HFD-fed CD36Tg mice also showed decreased levels of proinflammatory hepatic prostaglandins and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (20-HETE), a potent vasoconstrictive and proinflammatory  metabolite.

The omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) may ameliorate , but it is unknown whether they have direct actions on adrenal CYP steroidogenic enzymes. The aim of this study was to determine whether PUFA modify adrenal glucocorticoid synthesis using isolated porcine microsomes. The enzyme activities of CYP17, CYP21, 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1, hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PDH), and CYP2E1 were measured in intact microsomes treated with fatty acids of disparate saturated bonds. Cortisol production was measured in a cell-free in vitro model. Microsomal lipid composition after  (AA) exposure was determined by sequential window acquisition of all theoretical spectra-mass spectrometry. Results showed that adrenal microsomal CYP21 activity was decreased by docosapentaenoic  (DPA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA), eicosapentaenoic , α-linolenic , AA, and linoleic , and CYP17 activity was inhibited by DPA, DHA, eicosapentaenoic , and AA. Inhibition was associated with the number of the PUFA double bonds. Similarly, cortisol production in vitro was decreased by DPA, DHA, and AA. Endoplasmic enzymes with intraluminal activity were unaffected by PUFA. In microsomes exposed to AA, the level of AA or oxidative metabolites of AA in the membrane was not altered. In conclusion, these observations suggest that omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA, especially those with 2 or more double bonds (DPA, DHA, and AA), impede adrenal glucocorticoid production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30048707>20-HETE in the regulation of vascular and cardiac function.</a></h2><p>20-HETE, the ω-hydroxylation product of  catalyzed by enzymes of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 4A and 4F gene families, is a bioactive lipid mediator with potent effects on the vasculature including stimulation of smooth muscle cell contractility, migration and proliferation as well as activation of endothelial cell dysfunction and inflammation.

Body weight was not significantly altered. In HFF, production of PGE2 , PGF2 alpha and TXB2 was elevated. The increased BP in HF and HFF could be partly attributed to the imbalance in vascular PR production towards vasoconstrictors. On the other hand, this dietary modification could induce inflammation, which would explain the elevation of PGE2 . In the F group, hypertension could be related to decreased vasodilator PRs. The simultaneous administration of HF and F in the rat produces deleterious effects greater than observed when treatments are applied separately.© 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009738>A pilot metabolomics study of tuberculosis immune reconstitution inflammatory .</a></h2><p>Diagnosis of paradoxical tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory  (TB-IRIS) is challenging and new tools are needed for early diagnosis as well as to understand the biochemical events that underlie the pathology in TB-IRIS.Plasma samples were obtained from participants from a randomized HIV/TB treatment strategy study (AIDS Clinical Trials Group [ACTG] A5221) with (n = 26) and without TB-IRIS (n = 22) for an untargeted metabolomics pilot study by liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry. The  profile of these participants was compared at the study entry and as close to the diagnosis of TB-IRIS as possible (TB-IRIS window). Molecular features with p < 0.05 and log fold change ≥0.58 were submitted for pathway analysis through MetaboAnalyst. We also elucidated potential  signatures for TB-IRIS using a LASSO regression model.At the study entry, we showed that the  and glycerophospholipid metabolism were altered in the TB-IRIS group. Sphingolipid and linoleic  metabolism were the most affected pathways during the TB-IRIS window. LASSO modeling selected a set of 8 and 7 molecular features with the potential to predict TB-IRIS at study entry and during the TB-IRIS window, respectively.This study suggests that the use of plasma metabolites may distinguish HIV-TB patients with and without TB-IRIS.Copyright © 2019.

The ω-hydroxylation of AA generates significant levels of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (20-HETE) in various tissues. In the current review, we discussed the role of 20-HETE in the kidney, liver, lung, and brain during physiological and pathophysiological states. Moreover, we discussed the role of 20-HETE in tumor formation,  and diabetes. In the kidney, 20-HETE is involved in modulation of preglomerular vascular tone and tubular ion transport. Furthermore, 20-HETE is involved in renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and polycystic kidney diseases. The role of 20-HETE in the liver is not clearly understood although it represents 50%-75% of liver CYP-dependent AA metabolism, and it is associated with liver cirrhotic ascites. In the respiratory system, 20-HETE plays a role in pulmonary cell survival, pulmonary vascular tone and tone of the airways. As for the brain, 20-HETE is involved in cerebral I/R injury. Moreover, 20-HETE has angiogenic and mitogenic properties and thus helps in tumor promotion. Several inhibitors and inducers of the synthesis of 20-HETE as well as 20-HETE analogues and antagonists are recently available and could be promising therapeutic options for the treatment of many disease states in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29756563>Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors as a Therapeutic Target in Inflammatory Diseases.</a></h2><p>Inflammation plays a crucial role in the development of many complex diseases and disorders including autoimmune diseases, , neurodegenerative diseases, and cardiovascular pathologies. Prostaglandins play a regulatory role in inflammation. Cyclooxygenases are the main mediators of inflammation by catalyzing the initial step of  metabolism and prostaglandin synthesis. The differential expression of the constitutive isoform COX-1 and the inducible isoform COX-2, and the finding that COX-1 is the major form expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, lead to the search for COX-2-selective inhibitors as anti-inflammatory agents that might diminish the gastrointestinal side effects of traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). COX-2 isoform is expressed predominantly in inflammatory cells and decidedly upregulated in chronic and acute inflammations, becoming a critical target for many pharmacological inhibitors. COX-2 selective inhibitors happen to show equivalent efficacy with that of conventional NSAIDs, but they have reduced gastrointestinal side effects. This review would elucidate the most recent findings on selective COX-2 inhibition and their relevance to human pathology, concretely in inflammatory pathologies characterized by a prolonged pro-inflammatory status, including autoimmune diseases, , obesity, atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, arthritis, chronic inflammatory bowel disease and cardiovascular pathologies.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31392628>Alterations of HDL particle phospholipid composition and role of inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis.</a></h2><p>The increased cardiovascular risk in RA (rheumatoid arthritis) cannot be explained by common quantitative circulating lipid parameters. The objective of the study was to characterize the modifications in HDL phosphosphingolipidome in patients with RA to identify qualitative modifications which could better predict the risk for CVD. Nineteen patients with RA were compared to control subjects paired for age, sex, BMI, and criteria of . The characterization of total HDL phosphosphingolipidome was performed by LC-MS/MS. RA was associated with an increased HDL content of lysophosphatidylcholine and a decreased content of PC (phosphatidylcholine), respectively, positively and negatively associated with cardiovascular risk. A discriminant molecular signature composed of 18 lipids was obtained in the HDL from RA patients. The detailed analysis of phospholipid species showed that molecules carrying omega-3 FA (fatty acids), notably docosahexaenoic  (C22:6 n-3), were depleted in HDL isolated from RA patients. By contrast, two PE (phosphatidylethanolamine) species carrying  (C20:4 n-6) were increased in HDL from RA patients. Furthermore, disease activity and severity indexes were associated with altered HDL content of 4 PE and 2 PC species. In conclusion, the composition of HDL phosphosphingolipidome is altered during RA. Identification of a lipidomic signature could therefore represent a promising biomarker for CVD risk. Although a causal link remains to be demonstrated, pharmacological and nutritional interventions targeting the normalization of the FA composition of altered phospholipids could help to fight against RA-related inflammation and CVD risk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28699199>Omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, serum zinc, delta-5- and delta-6-desaturase activities and incident .</a></h2><p>The associations of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) with  have been poorly explored. We investigated the associations of the serum n-6 PUFA and the activities of enzymes involved in the PUFA metabolism, delta-5-desaturase (D5D) and delta-6-desaturase (D6D) with risk of incident . We also investigated whether zinc, a cofactor for these enzymes, modifies these associations.A prospective follow-up study was conducted on 661 men who were aged 42-60 years old at baseline in 1984-1989 and who were re-examined in 1998-2001.Men in the highest versus the lowest serum total omega-6 PUFA tertile had a 70% lower multivariate-adjusted risk of incident  [odds ratio (OR) = 0.30; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.18-0.51, P < 0.001]. Inverse associations were also observed for linoleic ,  and D5D activity. By contrast, men in the highest tertile of D6D activity had an 84% higher risk (OR = 1.84; 95% CI = 1.15-2.94, P = 0.008). Similar associations were observed with many of the  components at the re-examinations. Most associations were attenuated after adjustment for body mass index. Finally, the associations of D6D and LA were stronger among those with a higher serum zinc concentration.Higher serum total n-6 PUFA, linoleic  and  concentrations and D5D activity were associated with a lower risk of developing  and higher D6D activity was associated with a higher risk.

Although some physiological and pathological function parameters of the acute blood stasis have been investigated, little information about the changes of small metabolites in biofluids has been reported. In present study, global  profiling with ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF/MS) combined with pattern recognition method was performed to discover the underlying blood-activating regulation mechanisms of DG, HH and GH on the acute blood stasis rats induced by subcutaneous injection of adrenaline hydrochloride and ice water bath. The total 14 metabolites (10 in urine and 4 in plasma), up regulated or down regulated (P<0.05 or 0.01), were identified and contributed to the acute blood stasis progress. These promising identified biomarkers underpin the  pathway including phenylalanine metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism,  metabolism and arginine and proline metabolism are disturbed in the acute blood stasis rats, which identified by using pathway analysis with MetPA. The altered metabolites and hemorheological indexes could be regulated closer to normal level after DG, HH and GH intervention. In term of activate blood circulation function, GH was the most effective as shown by the relative distance in PLS-DA score plots and relative intensity of metabolomics trategy, reflecting the synergic action between Danggui and Honghua.

Lipoxins are endogenously generated from , and exhibit anti-inflammatory actions. Currently, there is no available cohort study identifying the association between serum lipoxins level and MetS. Here we investigate the relationship between serum lipoxin A4 (LXA4) level and the risk of incident MetS in a middle-aged Chinese population. A total 624 participants aged 40-65 years were enrolled at baseline, with 417 (including 333 MetS absence) of them were followed up at 2.5 years. Abdominal visceral fat area (VFA) and abdominal subcutaneous fat area (SFA) were determined using MRI. Serum lipoxin A4 levels were measured by ELISA. At baseline, serum LXA4 levels were significantly correlated with a cluster of traditional MetS risk factors related to obesity (P ≤ 0.05). A higher incidence of new Mets was found in the participants of the lowest tertile of LXA4 levels as compared with that in participants of the highest tertile (P = 0.025). Low serum LXA4 levels [OR 2.607(1.151-5.909), P = 0.022] and high VFA [OR 2.571(1.176-5.620), P = 0.018] were associated with an increased incident Mets, respectively, which remained statistically significant after adjustment for age, gender, current smoking, and alcohol drinking status. Logistic regression analysis suggested a combination of low serum LXA4 levels and high WC/VFA might optimize the prediction of incident Mets in middle-aged Chinese population [OR 4.897/4.967, P = 0.009/0.003]. Decrease in serum LXA4 level and increase in VFA are independent predictors of incident Mets in a population-based cohort, and a combination of them enhances the prognostic value of incident Mets. Taken together, our data suggest that serum LXA4 levels might be useful for early detection and prevention of Mets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31493746>An integrated metabolomics strategy to reveal dose-effect relationship and therapeutic mechanisms of different efficacy of rhubarb in constipation rats.</a></h2><p>The ambiguity of dose-effect relationship of many traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) has always influenced their rational use in TCM clinic. Rhubarb, a preferred representative of cathartic TCM, is currently widely used that results in a diversity of its dosage. The aim of this study was to use an integrated metabolomics strategy to simultaneously reveal dose-effect relationship and therapeutic mechanisms of different efficacy of rhubarb in constipation rats. Six doses of rhubarb (0.135, 0.27, 0.81, 1.35, 4.05, and 8.1 g/kg) were examined to elucidate the laxative and fire-purging effects by pathological sections and UPLC-Q-TOF/MS. The results showed that there existed serious lesions in the stomach and colon of model rats. And conditions were basically improved to some extent in rhubarb-treated groups. Through relative distance calculation based on metabolomics score plots, it suggested that the effective dose threshold (EC-EC range) of rhubarb was from 0.31 to 4.5 g/kg (corresponding to 3.44-50.00 g in the clinic) in rat serum and 0.29-2.1 g/kg (corresponding to 3.22-23.33 g in the clinic) in feces. Then, 33 potential biomarkers were identified in total. Functional pathway analysis revealed that the alterations of these biomarkers were associated with 15  pathways, mainly including  metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, steroid biosynthesis, primary bile  biosynthesis and sphingolipid metabolism. Of note, different doses of rhubarb could alleviate endogenous disorders to varying degrees through regulating multiple perturbed pathways to the normal state, which might be in a dose-dependent manner and involved in therapeutic mechanisms. To sum up, integrated serum and fecal metabolomics obtained that rhubarb ranging from 0.31 to 2.1 g/kg is safe and effective for constipation treatment. Also, our findings showed that the robust metabolomics techniques would be promising to be more accurately used in the dose-effect studies of complex TCM, and to clarify  pathogenesis and action mechanisms in Chinese medicine.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed to identify serum metabolites that are relevant to MS.This study involved 40 patients with MS and 28 healthy adults, and the following data were statistically analyzed: basic clinical data, blood lipids, fasting blood glucose, blood pressure, waist circumference, and visceral fat coefficient. Serum samples from both groups were collected and analyzed by liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF/MS); multivariate and univariate statistical methods were used to identify potential MS biomarkers and MS-related  pathways. In addition, leucine and valine levels in serum from MS patients and normal subjects were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs).In this study, 23 potential biomarkers were identified in the plasma of MS patients. These biomarkers were mainly related to metabolism; the tricarboxylic  cycle; galactose metabolism;  metabolism; valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation; and valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis. ELISAs were utilized to verify serum leucine and valine levels, and the results supported the experimental metabolomics results.In total, 23 MS-related metabolites were identified in the serum; these differential metabolites were mainly associated with lipid metabolism, amino  metabolism, glucose metabolism, purine metabolism, and other related  pathways.

In contrast to open repair (OR), endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) seems to decrease the postoperative stress by offering less extensive incisions, dissection, and tissue manipulation. However, these beneficial effects may be offset by the release of cytokines and  metabolites during intra-luminal manipulation of the thrombus using catheters in endovascular repair, resulting in systemic inflammatory response (SIR), which is clinically called post-implantation . In this systematic review we compared OR with EVAR in terms of the post-interventional inflammatory response resulting from alterations in the circulating cytokine levels. We sought to summarize all the latest evidence regarding post-implantation  after EVAR. We searched Medline (PubMed), ClinicalTrials.gov and the Cochrane library for clinical studies reporting on the release of cytokines as part of the inflammatory response after both open/conventional and endovascular repair of the AAA. We identified 17 studies examining the cytokine levels after OR versus EVAR. OR seemed to be associated with a greater SIR than EVAR, as evidenced by the increased cytokine levels, particularly IL-6 and IL-8, whereas IL-1β, IL-10 and TNF-α showed conflicting results or no difference between the two groups. Polyester endografts appear to be positively correlated with the incidence of post-implantation  after EVAR. Future large prospective studies are warranted to delineate the underlying mechanisms of the cytokine interaction in the post-surgical inflammatory response setting.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25765514>Maternal fructose-intake-induced renal programming in adult male offspring.</a></h2><p>Nutrition in pregnancy can elicit long-term effects on the health of offspring. Although fructose consumption has increased globally and is linked to , little is known about the long-term effects of maternal high-fructose (HF) exposure during gestation and lactation, especially on renal programming. We examined potential key genes and pathways that are associated with HF-induced renal programming using whole-genome RNA next-generation sequencing (NGS) to quantify the abundance of RNA transcripts in kidneys from 1-day-, 3-week-, and 3-month-old male offspring. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats received regular chow or chow supplemented with HF (60% diet by weight) during the entire period of pregnancy and lactation. Male offspring exhibited programmed hypertension at 3 months of age. Maternal HF intake modified over 200 renal transcripts from nephrogenesis stage to adulthood. We observed that 20 differentially expressed genes identified in 1-day-old kidney are related to regulation of blood pressure. Among them, Hmox1, Bdkrb2, Adra2b, Ptgs2, Col1a2 and Tbxa2r are associated with endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF). NGS also identified genes in  metabolism (Cyp2c23, Hpgds, Ptgds and Ptges) that may be potential key genes/pathways contributing to renal programming and hypertension. Collectively, our NGS data suggest that maternal HF intake elicits a defective adaptation of interrelated EDHFs during nephrogenesis which may lead to renal programming and hypertension in later life. Moreover, our results highlight genes and pathways involved in renal programming as potential targets for therapeutic approaches to prevent -related comorbidities in children with HF exposure in early life.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The impact of statin treatment on the capacity of HDL to inactivate LDL-derived, redox-active phospholipid hydroperoxides (PCOOHs) in MetS is indeterminate. Insulin-resistant, hypertriglyceridemic, hypertensive, obese males were treated with pitavastatin (4 mg/day) for 180 days, resulting in marked reduction in plasma TGs (-41%) and LDL-cholesterol (-38%), with minor effects on HDL-cholesterol and apoAI. Native plasma LDL (baseline vs. 180 days) was oxidized by aqueous free radicals under mild conditions in vitro either alone or in the presence of the corresponding pre- or poststatin HDL2 or HDL3 at authentic plasma mass ratios.

Infections by human-pathogenic coronaviruses result in diverse clinical outcomes, ranging from self-limiting flu-like symptoms to severe pneumonia with extrapulmonary manifestations. Understanding how cellular lipids may modulate the pathogenicity of human-pathogenic coronaviruses remains poor. To this end, we utilized the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) as a model coronavirus to comprehensively characterize the host cell lipid response upon coronavirus infection with an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC⁻MS)-based lipidomics approach.

Next, a broad range metabolomics strategy based on RPLC-Q-TOF/MS and HILIC-Q-TOF/MS has been developed to find the possible significant metabolites in the serum and urine of LKYDS rats. Then, network analysis was applied to visualize the relationships between identified serum and urine metabolites and in detail to find hub metabolites, which might be responsible for the effect of EZW on rats of LKYDS. Furthermore, the shortest path of "disease gene-pathway protein-metabolite" was built to investigate the possible intervention path of EZW from the systematic perspective.Five hub metabolites, namely, , L-arginine, testosterone, taurine and oxoglutaric , were screened out and could be adjusted to recover by EZW. After that, the shortest path starting from disease genes and ending in metabolites were identified and disclosed, and the genes of aging such as CAV1 and ACO1 were selected to explain the pathological mechanism of LKYDS.Broad range metabolomics coupled with network analysis could provide another perspective on systematically investigating the molecular mechanism of EZW in treating LKYDS at metabolomics level. In addition, EZW might prevent the pathological process of LKYDS through regulating the disturbed  pathway and the aging genes such as CAV1 and ACO1, which may be potential targets for EZW in the treatment of LKYDS.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated whether VA could influence tissue endocannabinoids (ECs) by altering the availability of their biosynthetic precursor,  (AA), in membrane phospholipids (PLs). JCR:LA-cprats were assigned to a control diet with or without VA (1% w/w),cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic  (CLA) (1% w/w) or VA+CLA (1% + 0.5% w/w) for 8 weeks. VA reduced the EC, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), in the liver and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) relative to control diet (P< 0.001), but did not change AA in tissue PLs. There was no additive effect of combining VA+CLA on 2-AG relative to VA alone (P> 0.05). Interestingly, VA increased jejunal concentrations of anandamide and those of the noncannabinoid signaling molecules, oleoylethanolamide and palmitoylethanolamide, relative to control diet (P< 0.05). This was consistent with a lower jejunal protein abundance (but not activity) of their degrading enzyme, fatty  amide hydrolase, as well as the mRNA expression of TNFα and interleukin 1β (P< 0.05). The ability of VA to reduce 2-AG in the liver and VAT provides a potential mechanistic explanation to alleviate ectopic lipid accumulation. The opposing regulation of ECs and other noncannabinoid lipid signaling molecules by VA suggests an activation of benefit via the EC system in the intestine.Copyright © 2016 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28821830>Disease- combination modeling: metabolomic strategy for the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease.</a></h2><p>Conventional disease animal models have limitations on the conformity to the actual clinical situation. Disease- combination (DS) modeling may provide a more efficient strategy for biomedicine research. Disease model and DS model of renal fibrosis in chronic kidney disease were established by ligating the left ureter and by ligating unilateral ureteral combined with exhaustive swimming, respectively. Serum metabolomics was conducted to evaluate disease model and DS model by using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Potential endogenous biomarkers were identified by multivariate statistical analysis. There are no differences between two models regarding their clinical biochemistry and kidney histopathology, while metabolomics highlights their difference.

Middle-aged women are at a greater risk of MetS, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease than men because they have more subcutaneous fat and larger waist circumferences compared with men with equal visceral fat levels. In this study, we investigated the effects of calorie restriction (CR) and fish oil supplementation (CRF) on middle-aged Taiwanese women with MetS. An open-label, parallel-arm, controlled trial was conducted for 12 weeks. A total of 75 eligible participants were randomly assigned to the CR or CRF group. Both the dietary intervention groups were further divided into two age groups: ≤45 and >45 years. Changes in MetS severity, inflammatory status, iron status, and red blood cell fatty  profile were evaluated. A total of 71 participants completed the trial. Both dietary interventions significantly ameliorated MetS and improved the participants' inflammatory status. CR significantly increased the total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) whereas CRF increased hepcidin levels in women aged >45 years. Furthermore, CRF significantly increased the n-6/n-3 and /docosahexaenoic  ratios. Both interventions improved the anthropometric and MetS characteristics, including body weight, blood glucose and triglyceride levels, and the score of the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index. In conclusion, the 12-week dietary interventions improved the abnormal  status of middle-aged obese women. CRF was demonstrated to be more effective in ameliorating postprandial glucose level and TIBC in women aged >45 years than in those aged ≤45 years.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26491436>17β Estradiol Modulates Perfusion Pressure and Expression of 5-LOX and CYP450 4A in the Isolated Kidney of  Female Rats.</a></h2><p>Prevalence of  and progression of nephropathy depend on sex. We examined a protective effect of estradiol against nephropathy in  through the modulation of the  metabolism by activating the 5-lipoxygenase and cytochrome p450 4A pathways. 28 female Wistar rats were divided into four groups of seven animals each: control, intact , ovariectomized , and  ovariectomized plus estradiol. Blood pressure, body weight, body fat, triglycerides, insulin, HOMA-index, albuminuria, and TNF-α were increased in ovariectomized  rats (p < 0.001). The perfusion pressure in isolated kidneys of ovariectomized  rats in presence of 4 μg of  was increased. The inhibitors of the  metabolism Baicalein, Miconazole, and Indomethacin in these rats decreased the perfusion pressure by 57.62%, 99.83%, and 108.5%, respectively and they decreased creatinine clearance and the  percentage. Phospholipase A2 expression in the kidney of ovariectomized  rats was not modified. 5-lipoxygenase was increased in  ovariectomized rats while cytochrome p450 4A was decreased. In conclusion, the loss of estradiol increases renal damage while the treatment with estradiol benefits renal function by modulating  metabolism through the 5-lipoxygenase and cytochrome p450 4A pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26639852>The Frequency of Fish-Eating Could Negatively Associate with Visceral Adiposity in Those Who Eat Moderately.</a></h2><p>Visceral fat accumulation is regarded as one of the major phenotypes of . There have not been enough data on the relationship between the fish-eating habit and visceral adiposity. A total of 94 male participants received abdominal CT for the measurement of the visceral fat area (VFA), serum sampling for the fatty  composition and questionnaires about their life-style. We divided the participants into two groups: whether they ate their fill (group F, n=70) or they ate in moderation (group M, n=24). Stepwise multiple linear regression analyses showed that usual alcohol consumption and lower daily physical activity in group F, and infrequent fish-eating and frequent fat-rich deserts in group M were the significant positive correlates with the VFA. The serum eicosapentaenoic  (EPA)/ (AA) ratio showed significant correlation with the frequency of fish-eating in both groups. Interestingly, in group M, the serum EPA/AA ratio negatively correlated with the VFA, while it failed in group F. In conclusion, the present data suggest that the fish-eating habit might negatively associate with visceral fat accumulation only in those who are moderate in eating in the general population.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27900261>Targeting the endocannabinoid/CB1 receptor system for treating obesity in Prader-Willi .</a></h2><p>Extreme obesity is a core phenotypic feature of Prader-Willi  (PWS). Among numerous  regulators, the endocannabinoid (eCB) system is critically involved in controlling feeding, body weight, and energy metabolism, and a globally acting cannabinoid-1 receptor (CBR) blockade reverses obesity both in animals and humans. The first-in-class CBR antagonist rimonabant proved effective in inducing weight loss in adults with PWS. However, it is no longer available for clinical use because of its centrally mediated, neuropsychiatric, adverse effects.We studied eCB 'tone' in individuals with PWS and in the -null mouse model that recapitulates the major  phenotypes of PWS and determined the efficacy of a peripherally restricted CBR antagonist, JD5037 in treating obesity in these mice.Individuals with PWS had elevated circulating levels of 2-arachidonoylglycerol and its endogenous precursor and breakdown ligand, . Increased hypothalamic eCB 'tone', manifested by increased eCBs and upregulated CBR, was associated with increased fat mass, reduced energy expenditure, and decreased voluntary activity in -null mice. Daily chronic treatment of obese -null mice and their littermate wild-type controls with JD5037 (3 mg/kg/d for 28 days) reduced body weight, reversed hyperphagia, and improved  parameters related to their obese phenotype.Dysregulation of the eCB/CBR system may contribute to hyperphagia and obesity in -null mice and in individuals with PWS. Our results demonstrate that treatment with peripherally restricted CBR antagonists may be an effective strategy for the management of severe obesity in PWS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30662340>Lipopolysaccharide promoted proliferation and adipogenesis of preadipocytes through JAK/STAT and AMPK-regulated cPLA2 expression.</a></h2><p>The proliferation and adipogenesis of preadipocytes played important roles in the development of adipose tissue and contributed much to the processes of obesity. On the other hand, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), also known as endotoxin, is a key outer membrane component of gram-negative bacteria in the gut microbiota, and has a dominant role in linking inflammation to high-fat diet-induced . Studies suggested the potential roles of LPS in hepatic steatosis and in obese mice models. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying LPS-regulated obesity remained largely unknown. Here we reported that LPS stimulated expression of cyosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), one of inflammation regulators of obesity, in the preadipocytes. Pretreatment the inhibitors of JAK2, STAT3, STAT5 or AMPK significantly reduced LPS-increased mRNA and protein expression of cPLA2 together with phosphorylation of JAK2, STAT3, STAT5 and AMPK, separately. Similarly, transfection of siRNA against JAK2 or AMPK abolished expression of cPLA2 and phosphorylation of JAK2 or AMPK together with downregulated expression of JAK2 and AMPK protein. LPS enhanced activation of STAT3 and STAT5 via JAK2-dependent manner in the preadipocytes. Transfection of JAK2 or AMPK siRNA further proofed the independence of JAK2 and AMPK in LPS-treated preadipocytes. In addition, LPS-increased DNA synthesis, cell numbers and cell viability of preadipocytes were attenuated by AACOCF3, AG490, BML-275, cPLA2 siRNA, JAK2 siRNA or AMPK siRNA. Attenuation JAK2/STAT or AMPK-dependent cPLA2 expression reduced LPS-mediated adipogenesis of preadipocytes. Stimulation of  or AMPK activator, A-769662, increased cell numbers and cell viability and promoted differentiation of preadipocytes. Collectively, these results indicated that LPS increased preadipocytes proliferation and adipogenesis via JAK/STAT and AMPK-dependent cPLA2 expression. The mechanisms of LPS-stimulated cPLA2 expression may be a link between bacteria and obesity and provides the molecular basis for preventing  or hyperplasic obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27878278>Alteration of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids in the liver and kidney of cytochrome P450 4F2 transgenic mice.</a></h2><p> (AA) can be metabolized into 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (20-HETE) by ω-hydroxylases, and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) by epoxygenases. The effects of EETs in cardiovascular physiology are vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory and anti‑apoptotic, which are opposite to the function to 20‑HETE. However, EETs are not stable in vivo, and are rapidly degraded to the biologically less active metabolites, dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids, via soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). Western blotting, reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry were performed in order to determine target RNA and protein expression levels. In the present study, it was demonstrated that the disturbed renal 20‑HETE/EET ratio in the hypertensive cytochrome P450 4F2 transgenic mice was caused by the activation of sEH and the repression of epoxygenase activity. In addition, 20‑HETE showed an opposite regulatory effect on the endogenous epoxygenases in the liver and kidney. Given that 20‑HETE and EETs have opposite effects in multiple disease, the regulation of their formation and degradation may yield therapeutic benefits.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25471593>Roles of lipid-modulating enzymes diacylglycerol kinase and cyclooxygenase under pathophysiological conditions.</a></h2><p>Lipid not only represents a constituent of the plasma membrane, but also plays a pivotal role in intracellular signaling. Lipid-mediated signaling system is strictly regulated by several enzymes, which act at various steps of the lipid metabolism. Under pathological conditions, prolonged or insufficient activation of this system results in dysregulated signaling, leading to diseases such as cancer or . Of the lipid-modulating enzymes, diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) and cyclooxygenase (COX) are intimately involved in the signaling system. DGK consists of a family of enzymes that phosphorylate a second messenger diacylglycerol (DG) to produce phosphatidic  (PA). Both DG and PA are known to activate signaling molecules such as protein kinase C. COX catalyzes the committed step in prostanoid biosynthesis, which involves the metabolism of  to produce prostaglandins. Previous studies have shown that the DGK and COX are engaged in a number of pathological conditions.

Exposure to high sugar diets during gestation and/or lactation affects susceptibility to  or hypertension in adulthood. The effect of a high sugar diet for shorter time lapses remains unclear. Here we studied the effect of short-term sucrose ingestion near weaning (postnatal days 12 and 28) (STS) and its effect after long-term ingestion, for a period of seven months (LTS) in rats. Rats receiving sucrose for seven months develop  (MS). The mechanisms underlying hypertension in this model and those that underlie the effects of short-term exposure have not been studied. We explore NO and endothelin-1 concentration, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression, fatty  participation and the involvement of oxidative stress (OS) after LTS and STS. Blood pressure increased to similar levels in adult rats that received sucrose during short- and long-term glucose exposure. The endothelin-1 concentration increased only in LTS rats. eNOS and SOD2 expression determined by Western blot and total antioxidant capacity were diminished in both groups. Saturated fatty acids and  were only decreased in LTS rats. In conclusion, a high-sugar diet during STS increases the hypertension predisposition in adulthood to as high a level as LTS, and the mechanisms involved have similarities (participation of OS and eNOS and SOD expression) and differences (fatty acids and  only participate in LTS and an elevated level of endothelin-1 was only found in LTS) in both conditions. Changes in the diet during short exposure times in early developmental stages have long-lasting effects in determining hypertension susceptibility.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26982448>Fatty  Content of Plasma Triglycerides May Contribute to the Heterogeneity in the Relationship Between Abdominal Obesity and the .</a></h2><p>About one-third of the people with abdominal obesity do not exhibit the  (MetS). Fatty acids in plasma triglycerides (TGs) may help to explain part of this heterogeneity. This study compared TG fatty  profile of adults with and without abdominal obesity and examined the associations of these fatty acids with MetS components.Fifty-four abdominally obese subjects were matched by age and sex with 54 adults without abdominal obesity. People were classified with MetS according to the harmonizing criteria for MetS. Fatty acids in plasma TGs were analyzed by gas chromatography.There were no differences in fatty acids of plasma TGs between people with and without abdominal obesity. However, there were differences between abdominally obese people with and without MetS. The abdominally obese group with MetS had higher palmitic (+2.9%; P = 0.012) and oleic (+4.0%; P = 0.001) acids and lower linoleic (-6.4%; P = 0.018) and  (-1.2%; P = 0.004) acids. After adjustment for abdominal obesity, age, and sex, a stepwise regression analysis showed that palmitic  positively contributed to the variance in insulin (β = +1.08 ± 1.01; P = 0.000) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index (β = +1.09 ± 1.01; P = 0.000) and myristic  positively contributed to the variance in systolic blood pressure (β = +1.09 ± 1.03; P = 0.006). In contrast, linoleic  negatively contributed to the variance in glucose (β = -0.321 ± 0.09; P = 0.001) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP; β = -1.05 ± 1.01; P = 0.000).There were no differences in the plasma TG fatty  profile between people with and without abdominal obesity. Likewise, fatty acids in plasma TGs associated with many of the MetS variables independently of abdominal obesity. These results suggest that the plasma TG fatty  profile may help to explain part of the heterogeneity between abdominal obesity and the MetS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31080589>Addition of milk fat globule membrane-enriched supplement to a high-fat meal attenuates insulin secretion and induction of soluble epoxide hydrolase gene expression in the postprandial state in overweight and obese subjects.</a></h2><p>CVD and associated  diseases are linked to chronic inflammation, which can be modified by diet. The objective of the present study was to determine whether there is a difference in inflammatory markers, blood  and lipid panels and lymphocyte gene expression in response to a high-fat dairy food challenge with or without milk fat globule membrane (MFGM). Participants consumed a dairy product-based meal containing whipping cream (WC) high in saturated fat with or without the addition of MFGM, following a 12 h fasting blood draw. Inflammatory markers including IL-6 and C-reactive protein, lipid and  panels and lymphocyte gene expression fold changes were measured using multiplex assays, clinical laboratory services and TaqMan real-time RT-PCR, respectively. Fold changes in gene expression were determined using the Pfaffl method. Response variables were converted into incremental AUC, tested for differences, and corrected for multiple comparisons. The postprandial insulin response was significantly lower following the meal containing MFGM ( < 0·01). The gene encoding soluble epoxide hydrolase () was shown to be more up-regulated in the absence of MFGM ( = 0·009). Secondary analyses showed that participants with higher baseline cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol ratio (Chol:HDL) had a greater reduction in gene expression of cluster of differentiation 14 () and lymphotoxin  receptor () with the WC+MFGM meal. The protein and lipid composition of MFGM is thought to be anti-inflammatory.

CYP2C and CYP2J epoxygenases convert  to anti-inflammatory epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, which have protective effects in a variety of disorders including cardiovascular disease and . CYP4A and CYP4F hydroxylases have the ability to metabolize multiple substrates related to the regulation of inflammation and lipid homeostasis, and it is a challenge to determine which substrates are physiologically relevant for each enzyme; the best-characterized activities include generation of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  and inactivation of leukotriene B4. The expression of hepatic drug-metabolizing cytochrome P450s is modulated by cytokines during inflammation, resulting in changes to the pharmacokinetics of prescribed medications. Cytochrome P450s are therefore the focus of intersecting challenges in the pharmacology of inflammation: not only do they represent targets for development of new anti-inflammatory drugs but they also contribute to variability in drug efficacy or toxicity in inflammatory disease. Animal models and primary hepatocytes have been used extensively to study the effects of cytokines on cytochrome P450 expression and activity. However, it is difficult to predict changes in drug exposure in patients because the response to inflammation varies depending on the disease state, its time course, and the cytochrome P450 involved. In these circumstances, the development of endogenous markers of cytochrome P450 metabolism might provide a useful tool to reevaluate drug dosage and choice of therapy.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) metabolism is modulated in obesity. However, it has yet to be fully elucidated whether a serum PUFA profile is associated with hepatic steatosis.We aimed to clarify the relationship between a serum PUFA profile and liver lipid content.A cross-sectional study was conducted on 288 patients with dyslipidemia, diabetes, or coronary artery disease on statin therapy. Several PUFAs were measured, including eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA), dihomo-γ-linolenic  (DGLA) and  (AA) in serum lipids, and Δ-5 desaturase (D5D) activity was estimated by AA to DGLA ratio. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) measured visceral fat area (VFA) and the ratio of CT attenuation for liver to spleen (L/S).The L/S ratio showed significant correlations with serum DGLA level and D5D activity (p<0.0001 for both). Serum DGLA level and D5D activity were significantly correlated with body mass index (BMI) or VFA, and with Homeostasis Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) (p<0.0001 for all). Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that a high DGLA level or low D5D activity was a significant determinant for hepatic steatosis (p<0.0001 for both) independent of BMI and HOMA-IR. ROC analysis revealed that they significantly enhanced the value of MetS-related factors in predicting hepatic steatosis (p<0.05 for both).A high DGLA level and low D5D activity in serum lipids may be useful markers predicting hepatic steatosis incrementally to MetS-related conventional factors.Copyright © 2016 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity.

The biosynthesis of the two main endocannabinoids, N-arachidonoylethanolamine and 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol, which derive from , is influenced by dietary fatty acids (FAs). We investigated whether exposure to n-3 FA at a young age may decrease tissue endocannabinoid levels and prevent  disorders induced by a later high-fat diet (HFD) challenge. Three-week-old mice received a 5% lipid diet containing lard, lard plus safflower oil, or lard plus linseed oil for 10 weeks. Then, mice were challenged with a 30% lard diet for 10 additional weeks. A low n-6/n-3 FA ratio in the early diet induces a marked decrease in liver endocannabinoid levels. A similar reduction was observed in transgenic Fat-1 mice, which exhibit high tissue levels of n-3 FA compared with wild-type mice. Hepatic expression of key enzymes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism was concomitantly changed. Interestingly, some gene modifications persisted after HFD challenge and were associated with improved glycemic control.

Simultaneously, this fat excess promotes the appearance of insulin resistance. All this contributes to the development of atherosclerosis and increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). On the other hand, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic  (omega 3), and  (omega 6) have shown anti-inflammatory properties.

In this study cohort, the percentage of students who exercised regularly was significantly higher among males than females. Body fat in males with well-exercised was lower than that in males with no exercise. In addition, serum level of high-density cholesterol in males with well-exercised was higher.

The impaired dilator reactivity in OZR reflects a loss in venular nitric oxide and PGI bioavailability, associated with the chronic elevation in oxidant stress. Additionally, with the impaired dilator responses, a modest increase in adrenergic constriction combined with an elevated thromboxane A production may contribute to impaired functional dilator and hyperaemic responses at the venular level. For the shift in skeletal muscle venular function with development of the , issues such as aggregate microvascular perfusion resistance, mass transport and exchange within with capillary networks, and fluid handling across the microcirculation are compelling avenues for future investigation.While research into vascular outcomes of the  has focused on arterial/arteriolar and capillary levels, investigation into venular function and how this impacts responses has received little attention. Using the in situ cremaster muscle of obese Zucker rats (OZR; with lean Zucker rats (LZR) as controls), we determined indices of venular function. At ∼17 weeks of age, skeletal muscle post-capillary venular density was reduced by ∼20% in LZR vs. OZR, although there was no evidence of remodelling of the venular wall. Venular tone at ∼25 μm (post-capillary) and ∼75 μm (collecting) diameter was elevated in OZR vs. LZR. Venular dilatation to acetylcholine was blunted in OZR vs. LZR due to increased oxidant stress-based loss of nitric oxide bioavailability (post-capillary) and increased α - (and α -) mediated constrictor tone (collecting). Venular constrictor responses in OZR were comparable to LZR for most stimuli, although constriction to α -adrenoreceptor stimulation was elevated. In response to field stimulation of the cremaster muscle (0.5, 1, 3 Hz), venular dilator and hyperaemic responses to lower frequencies were blunted in OZR, but responses at 3 Hz were similar between strains.

A PCOS rat model was used to validate results of the human studies.Serum lipid profiles, including phospholipids, free fatty acids (FFAs), and bioactive lipids, were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS) and liquid chromatography-MS.Elevation in phosphatidylcholine and a concomitant decrease in lysophospholipid were found in obese patients with PCOS vs lean controls. Obese patients with PCOS had decreased PUFA levels and increased levels of long-chain saturated fatty acids vs lean controls. Serum bioactive lipids downstream of  were increased in obese controls, but reduced in both obese and lean patients with PCOS vs their respective controls.Patients with PCOS showed abnormal levels of phosphatidylcholine, FFAs, and PUFA metabolites.
