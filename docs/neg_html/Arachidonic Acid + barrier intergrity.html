In addition to hemostasis, Plts also function to stabilize the vasculature and maintain endothelial cell (EC)  . We hypothesized that Plt-EVs would inhibit vascular endothelial cell permeability, similar to fresh Plts. To investigate this hypothesis we utilized in vitro and in vivo models of vascular endothelial compromise and bleeding.In vitro: Plt-EVs were isolated by ultracentrifugation and characterized for Plt markers and particle size distribution. Effects of Plts and Plt-EVs on endothelial  function was assessed by trans - endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements and histological analysis of endothelial junction proteins. Hemostatic potential of Plt-EVs and Plts were assessed by multiple electrode Plt aggregometry. In vivo: The effects of Plts and Plt-EVs on vascular permeability and bleeding were assessed in NOD-SCID mice by an established Miles Assay of vascular permeability and a tail snip bleeding assay.In vitro: Plt-EVs displayed exosomal size distribution and expressed Plt specific surface markers. Plts and Plt-EVs decreased EC permeability and restored EC junctions after thrombin challenge. Multiplate aggregometry revealed that Plt-EVs enhanced Thrombin Receptor Activating Peptide (TRAP) mediated aggregation of whole blood, whereas Plts enhanced TRAP,  (ASPI), Collagen, and Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) mediated aggregation. In vivo: Plt-EVs are equivalent to Plts in attenuating VEGF-A induced vascular permeability and uncontrolled blood loss in a tail snip hemorrhage model.Our study is the first to report that Plt-EVs might provide a feasible product for transfusion in trauma patients to attenuate bleeding, inhibit vascular permeability and mitigate the endotheliopathy of trauma (EOT).Original Article LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: This is a pre-clinical study so it does not confirm to the level of evidence table for all clinical studies and case reports.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29568904>Roles of elevated 20‑HETE in the breakdown of blood brain  and the severity of brain edema in experimental traumatic brain injury.</a></h2><p>Breakdown of the blood brain  (BBB) is a secondary injury following traumatic brain injury (TBI) and can lead to the development of brain edema. However, the factors that contribute to the disruption of the BBB and increase the severity of brain edema in TBI remain to be elucidated. 20‑hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (20‑HETE) is a metabolite of . The inhibition of 20‑HETEsynthesis by HET0016 has been suggested as a strategy to decrease brain edema. The present study aimed to investigate whether the elevated production of 20‑HETE in cerebral tissue may contribute to BBB breakdown and increase the severity of brain edema in rats with TBI. BBB permeability was quantified using dynamic contrast‑enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and brain edema was measured according to brain water content. Superoxide production in injured tissue was also assessed. Liquid chromatography‑mass spectrometry was used to evaluate 20‑HETE production in injured tissue. Western blot analysis was used to assess the expression of occludin, zonula occludens (ZO)‑1, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)‑9, and proteins of the c‑Jun N‑terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. A total of 3, 24 and 72 h following the induction of TBI, 20‑HETE levels, BBB permeability and brain edema were identified to be increased, accompanied by an increase in superoxide production. Conversely, superoxide dismutase levels, in addition to the total antioxidative capability were decreased. In addition, the expression of MMP‑9 and proteins of the JNK pathway was upregulated, whereas the expression of occludin and ZO‑1 was observed to be suppressed. These results suggested that 20‑HETE may aggravate BBB disruption following TBI, via enhancing the expression of MMP‑9 and tight junction proteins. Furthermore, oxidative stress and the JNK signaling pathway may be involved in BBB dysregulation. In conclusion, the results of the present demonstrated that the production of 20‑HETE was increased in cerebral tissue following traumatic injury, thus suggesting that it may contribute to the compromise of BBB  and the development of brain edema.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28881620>EETs reduces LPS-induced hyperpermeability by targeting GRP78 mediated Src activation and subsequent Rho/ROCK signaling pathway.</a></h2><p> of endothelial  is a determinant of the prognosis in the acute lung injury caused by sepsis. The epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), metabolites of , exhibit protective effects in various pathogenic states, however, whether EETs play a role in endothelial  enhancement and the involved mechanisms remain to be investigated. Here, we show that increased EETs level by endothelial specific cytochrome P450 epoxygenase 2J2 over-expression and soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitor TPPU reduced lipopolysaccharide-induced endothelial hyper-permeability , accompanied by improved survival of septic mice. In addition, sEH inhibitor AUDA and 11,12-EET also decreased endothelial hyper-permeability in the  study. Importantly, the relative mechanisms were associated with reduced GRP78-Src interaction and ROS production, and subsequently reduced RhoA/ROCK activation, and eventually decreased VE-cadherin and myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation. Thus CYP2J2-EETs is crucial for RhoA-dependent regulation of cytoskeletal architecture leading to reversible changes in vascular permeability, which may contribute to the development of new therapeutic approaches for pulmonary edema and other diseases caused by abnormal vascular permeability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25166905>Endocannabinoid degradation inhibition improves neurobehavioral function, blood-brain  , and neuroinflammation following mild traumatic brain injury.</a></h2><p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an increasingly frequent and poorly understood condition lacking effective therapeutic strategies. Inflammation and oxidative stress (OS) are critical components of injury, and targeted interventions to reduce their contribution to injury should improve neurobehavioral recovery and outcomes. Recent evidence reveals potential protective, yet short-lived, effects of the endocannabinoids (ECs), 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) and N-arachidonoyl-ethanolamine (AEA), on neuroinflammatory and OS processes after TBI. The aim of this study was to determine whether EC degradation inhibition after TBI would improve neurobehavioral recovery by reducing inflammatory and oxidative damage. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a 5-mm left lateral craniotomy, and TBI was induced by lateral fluid percussion. TBI produced apnea (17±5 sec) and a delayed righting reflex (479±21 sec). Thirty minutes post-TBI, rats were randomized to receive intraperitoneal injections of vehicle (alcohol, emulphor, and saline; 1:1:18) or a selective inhibitor of 2-AG (JZL184, 16 mg/kg) or AEA (URB597, 0.3 mg/kg) degradation. At 24 h post-TBI, animals showed significant neurological and -behavioral impairment as well as disruption of blood-brain  (BBB) . Improved neurological and -behavioral function was observed in JZL184-treated animals. BBB  was protected in both JZL184- and URB597-treated animals. No significant differences in ipsilateral cortex messenger RNA expression of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2, tumor necrosis factor alpha, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NOX2) and protein expression of COX2 or NOX2 were observed across experimental groups. Astrocyte and microglia activation was significantly increased post-TBI, and treatment with JZL184 or URB597 blocked activation of both cell types. These findings suggest that EC degradation inhibition post-TBI exerts neuroprotective effects. Whether repeated dosing would achieve greater protection remains to be examined.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31124890>Regulation of endothelial cell permeability by platelet-derived extracellular vesicles.</a></h2><p>Platelet (Plt)-derived extracellular vesicles (Plt-EVs) have hemostatic properties similar to Plts.

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-dependent PGE production involves mobilisation of . Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LbGG) is one of the most widely used probiotics reported to colonise the colonic mucosa. LbGG contributes to the protection of the small intestine against radiation injury through the repositioning of mucosal COX-2 expressing cells. However, it is unknown if LbGG modulates PGE production in the colonic mucosa under homeostasis and the major cellular elements involved in these processes. Colonic epithelial and CD90 mesenchymal stromal cells, also known as (myo) fibroblasts (CMFs), are abundant innate immune cells in normal colonic mucosa able to produce PGE . Herein, we tested the hypothesis that under colonic mucosal homeostasis, LbGG modulates the eicosanoid pathway resulting in increased PGE production in both epithelial and stromal cells. Among the five tested human colonic epithelial cell lines, only exposure of Caco-2 to LbGG for 24 hr led to the mobilisation of  with concomitant increase in the components within the leukotriene and COX-2-dependent PGE pathways. By contrast, CMFs isolated from the normal human colonic mucosa responded to LbGG with increased expression of COX-2 and PGE in the prostaglandin pathway, but not 5-LO in the leukotriene pathway. Oral gavage of C57BL/6 mice for 5 days with LbGG (5 × 10 Colony-Forming Unit (CFU)/dose) increased COX-2 expression in the colonic mucosa. The majority of cells upregulating COX-2 protein expression were located in the colonic lamina propria and colocalised with α-SMA cells corresponding to the CMF phenotype. This process was myeloid differentiation factor-88-dependent, because silencing of myeloid differentiation factor-88 expression in CMFs abrogated LbGG-induced upregulation of COX-2 in culture and in vivo. Taken together, our data suggest that LbGG increases release of COX-2-mediated PGE , contributing to the maintenance of mucosal homeostasis in the colon and CMFs are among the major contributors to this process.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p></html>
