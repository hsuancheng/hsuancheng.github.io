Two hundred forty-two patients, 232 with malignant disease, were randomized to receive (n = 123) or not to receive (n = 119) UDCA from the beginning of the conditioning until 90 days post-transplantation. The results were reported after 1-year follow-up. UDCA administration reduced significantly the proportion of patients developing high serum bilirubin levels as well as the incidence of severe acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), liver GVHD, and intestinal GVHD. In the UDCA prophylaxis group, nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was lower and overall survival better than in the control group. After a 10-year follow-up, the difference in the survival and NRM in favor of the UDCA-treated group, seen at 1 year, was maintained (survival 48% versus 38%, P = .037; NRM 28% versus 41%, P = .01). A landmark analysis in patients surviving at 1 year post-transplantation showed no significant differences between the study groups in the long-term follow-up in chronic GVHD, relapse rate, NRM, disease-free survival, or overall survival. These long-term results continue to support the useful role of UDCA in the prevention of transplant-related complications in allogeneic transplantation.Copyright © 2014 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.

In the present study we evaluated whether enteral administration of UDCA has an effect on bile flow and protects the liver from injury related to transplantation. Wistar rats were used in liver perfusion (LP) and transplantation (LTx) models. Rats were enterally administered UDCA (800 mg/kg) 3 h before cold perfusion. In LP, bile flow and bile  composition were analysed. In LTx, serum ALT and liver histology were analysed. LP showed biliary UDCA enrichment up to 36+/-13% in pre-treated rats, causing higher bile flow (P = 0.026) compared with control rats. LTx showed lower ALT and TUNEL positive hepatocytes in the UDCA group (P < 0.02 and P < 0.05). In conclusion, augmented bile salt-dependent bile flow is preserved in the liver after cold storage. Enteral donor pre-treatment with UDCA protects the liver against ischaemia-reperfusion injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28994348>From pathogenesis to novel therapies in the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis.</a></h2><p>Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an immune-mediated liver disease characterized by chronic inflammation of the intrahepatic bile ducts, causing progressive ductopenia, cholestasis and fibrosis, and leading to liver failure. Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is the first-line therapy for the treatment of PBC patients. This is effective in majority of patients; however, up to 20 percent of patients have an incomplete response to UDCA therapy and have a reduced prognosis as compared to healthy individuals. Obeticholic  (OCA) has been recently registered as second-line therapy for patients with incomplete response to UDCA, with plans to demonstrate the long-term clinical efficacy. Areas covered: Recent evolution in our understanding of disease mechanisms is leading to the advent of new and re-purposed therapeutic agents targeting key processes in the etiopathogenesis. Several therapeutic targets have been proposed which can be categorized into three compartments: immune, biliary and fibrosis. In this review we describe the main biological mechanisms underpinning disease development and progression in PBC and the new targeted therapies on the horizon. Expert commentary: Testing new drugs towards hard clinical endpoints is challenging in PBC due to its low prevalence and the slow progression of the disease. Novel promising biomarkers are under study and should be evaluated as surrogate endpoints in clinical trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15984974>Clinical course and outcome of autoimmune hepatitis/primary sclerosing cholangitis overlap syndrome.</a></h2><p>Autoimmune hepatitis/primary sclerosing cholangitis (AIH/PSC) overlap syndrome is a relatively uncommon variant of PSC.To evaluate the natural history of AIH/PSC overlap syndrome compared to a group of "classical" PSC.Forty-one consecutive PSC patients, with a regular follow-up of at least 2 years, were prospectively included in the study. Among these, 7 fulfilled the criteria for AIH/PSC overlap syndrome.The AIH/PSC overlap group significantly differed from the "classical" PSC group in the following parameters: mean age at presentation (21.4 +/- 5.0 vs 32.3 +/- 10 years, p < 0.01), AST 191.0 +/- 14.8 vs 48.9 +/- 34.5 U/L, p < 0.005), ALT (357.0 +/- 26.5 vs 83.7 +/- 60.7 U/L, p < 0.005) and serum IgG (25.6 +/- 4.7 vs 12.9 +/- 6.0 mg/dl, p < 0.0001). The mean follow-up was similar in the 2 groups (93.3 +/- 65.9 vs 98.1 +/- 65.9 months respectively). Treatment included immunosuppression + ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) in the AIH/PSC overlap patients, and UDCA in the "classical" PSC group. Deaths were recorded only in the classical PSC group. The median survival in the latter group was 207 months (95% C.I. 87.6-326.4). The major events during the follow-up included: OLTx (1/7 vs 6/34), and neoplasms (only in the group of "classical" PSC). The new Mayo score prognostic index only increased significantly during follow-up in the "classical" PSC group (r2 0.8117, p < 0.01)Patients with AIH/PSC overlap syndrome seem to benefit from immunosuppression + UDCA therapy, survival is apparently better than in "classical" PSC condition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22421244>Adjunctive interferon-γ  for the treatment of HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis:  a randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>Interferon-gamma (IFNγ) is of key importance in the immune response to Cryptococcus neoformans. Mortality related to cryptococcal meningitis remains high, and novel treatment strategies are needed. We performed a randomized controlled trial to determine whether addition of IFNγ to standard therapy increased the rate of clearance of cryptococcal infection in HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis.Patients were randomized to amphotericin B 1 mg/kg per day and 5FC 100 mg/kg per day for 2 weeks (standard therapy), standard therapy and IFNγ1b 100 μg days 1 and 3 (IFNγ two doses), or standard therapy and IFNγ1b 100 μg days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10 and 12 (IFNγ six doses). Primary outcome was rate of clearance of cryptococcus from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (early fungicidal activity, EFA) calculated from serial quantitative cultures, previously shown to be independently associated with survival.Rate of fungal clearance was significantly faster in IFNγ containing groups than with standard treatment. Mean EFA [log colony forming unit (CFU)/ml per day] was -0.49 with standard treatment, -0.64 with IFNγ two doses, and -0.64 with IFNγ six doses. Difference in EFA was -0.15 [confidence interval (95% CI) -0.02 to -0.27, P=0.02] between standard treatment and IFNγ two doses, and -0.15 (95% CI -0.05 to -0.26, P=0.006) between standard treatment and IFNγ six doses. Mortality was 16% (14/88) at 2 weeks and 31% (27/87) at 10 weeks, with no significant difference between groups. All treatments were well tolerated.Addition of short-course IFNγ to standard treatment significantly increased the rate of clearance of cryptococcal infection from the CSF, and was not associated with any increase in adverse events. Two doses of IFNγ are as effective as six doses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28067240>CD8 T cells stimulate Na-Cl co-transporter NCC in distal convoluted tubules leading to salt-sensitive hypertension.</a></h2><p>Recent studies suggest a role for T lymphocytes in hypertension. However, whether T cells contribute to renal sodium retention and salt-sensitive hypertension is unknown. Here we demonstrate that T cells infiltrate into the kidney of salt-sensitive hypertensive animals. In particular, CD8 T cells directly contact the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) in the kidneys of DOCA-salt mice and CD8 T cell-injected mice, leading to up-regulation of the Na-Cl co-transporter NCC, p-NCC and the development of salt-sensitive hypertension. Co-culture with CD8 T cells upregulates NCC in mouse DCT cells via ROS-induced activation of Src kinase, up-regulation of the K channel Kir4.1, and stimulation of the Cl channel ClC-K. The last event increases chloride efflux, leading to compensatory chloride influx via NCC activation at the cost of increasing sodium retention. Collectively, these findings provide a mechanism for adaptive immunity involvement in the kidney defect in sodium handling and the pathogenesis of salt-sensitive hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3241102>[Medical treatment of cholelithiasis and bile duct cancer].</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20383205>Addition of aerosolized deoxycholate amphotericin B to systemic prophylaxis to prevent airways invasive fungal infections in allogeneic hematopoietic SCT: a single-center retrospective study.</a></h2><p>Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) still pose major challenges in allogeneic hematopoietic SCT (HSCT), and effective antifungal prophylaxis remains a matter of debate. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the toxicity and the impact of aerosolized deoxycholate amphotericin B (aero-d-AmB) on respiratory tract IFIs (airways IFIs) in a homogeneous cohort of allogeneic HSCT patients, transplanted at one institution. Since 1999, 102 consecutive patients were transplanted from matched related (N = 71) or unrelated donor (MUD). Aero-d-AmB was administered for a median time of 16 days (range 2-45), in addition to systemic antifungal prophylaxis. Prolonged administration was neither associated with increased severe bacterial infections, nor with severe adverse events. In 16 patients in whom aero-d-AmB was delivered for less than 8 days, due to worsened clinical conditions or poor compliance, proven or probable airways IFIs were diagnosed in three cases (one mucormycosis and one fusariosis and one probable aspergillosis), whereas in 84 patients receiving aero-d-AmB for ≥ 8 days, one possible and one probable aspergillosis were diagnosed. A shortened administration (< 8 days) of aero-d-AmB was therefore associated with an increased risk of both total airways IFIs (P = 0.027) and proven/probable IFIs (P = 0.012). At multivariate analysis prolonged aero-d-AmB administration retained an independent protective effect on airways IFIs (P = 0.026) whereas a MUD transplant was associated with a borderline increase of IFIs risk (P=0.052). Overall, 95.1% of patients did not experience airways IFIs and no patient died due to IFIs. In this cohort of patients, prolonged aero-d-AmB seems to have a role in preventing respiratory tract IFIs, but a randomized controlled trial is recommended to verify the impact of this prophylaxis in the setting of allogeneic HSCT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7076383>Immunization of mice against Taenia taeniaeformis using solubilized oncospheral antigens.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7872764>Efficacy of escalating doses of liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) against hematogenous Candida lusitaniae and Candida krusei infection in neutropenic mice.</a></h2><p>Immunosuppressed CF1 mice were infected intravenously with two strains of Candida krusei and four strains of Candida lusitaniae (two of which were resistant to amphotericin B). Mice were treated with 1 or 2 mg of amphotericin B desoxycholate per kg of body weight per day or escalating doses of liposomal amphotericin B (8 to 30 mg/kg/day) or were left untreated. Higher doses of liposomal amphotericin B were as effective as standard dose of amphotericin B desoxycholate in prolonging survival but were significantly more effective in reducing the fungal burden in the kidneys of animals infected with both C. krusei strains and the C. lusitaniae strains that were susceptible to amphotericin B desoxycholate.

These conditions are important differential diagnoses of elevated liver function tests as about 10 % of liver transplantations in Europe and North America are for these indications. The diagnosis is often difficult but can be facilitated by sequential measurement of relevant autoantibodies, exclusion of other liver disease, ultrasound, ERCP and liver histology. In AIH immunosuppressive therapy has been shown to prevent or stop the development of cirrhosis and improve the prognosis of the patients decisively. In other autoimmune liver diseases this evidence is missing making individual therapeutic decisions necessary. Ursodesoxycholic  (UDCA) seems to slow disease progression in particular in early stages of PBC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9514993>Pregnancy and liver disease.</a></h2><p>Liver disease in pregnancy should be considered in 3 categories: pre-existing disease, disease peculiar to pregnancy and coincident acute liver or gall-stone disease. In addition the time of onset of diagnosis in terms of the trimester of gestation must be verified, as the diseases peculiar to pregancy have a characteristic time of onset. In the last trimester closes obstetric management is required for the constellation of abnormal liver function tests, nausea and/or vomiting and abdominal pain. This may be due to severe pre-eclampsia, HELLP (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets) syndrome or acute fatty liver of pregnancy with or without sub-capsular hepatic haematomas, amongst which there is an overlap. Early delivery is curative. A molecular basis consisting of long chain 3-hydroxyl CoA dehydroxegenase deficiency in heterozygote mothers underlies this clinical syndrome. Ursodeoxycholic  is now established treatment for intra-hepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and appears to improve foetal outcome.

The acute LD50 of amphotericin B-deoxycholate was 5.1 mg/kg versus 20 mg/kg for the amphotericin/cholesterol-sulfate complexes. Amphotericin B-deoxycholate given iv at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg was more effective in sterilizing liver and kidney than the amphotericin/cholesterol-sulfate complexes given iv at 1.5-4.5 mg/kg, but infection persisted in the lungs of all rabbits treated with those doses. Infection persisted even when the rabbits were given a lethal dose of amphotericin B-deoxycholate (4.5 mg/kg), but a dose of 15 mg/kg of the amphotericin/cholesterol-sulfate complexes sterilized tissues and was associated with no acute lethality. Equivalent doses of the amphotericin/cholesterol-sulfate complexes were less effective than amphotericin B-deoxycholate, but a fourfold decrease in acute lethality improved the therapeutic index of amphotericin B. The amphotericin/cholesterol-sulfate complexes appear to be an improved means of amphotericin B delivery and may improve therapy for invasive aspergillosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25111172>Long-term outcome in PSC/AIH "overlap syndrome": does immunosuppression also treat the PSC component?</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6171602>Analysis of immunosuppressor cells induced by immunization of solubilized tumor-associated antigens prepared from a rat fibrosarcoma.</a></h2><p>Soluble tumor antigens were prepared from chemically-induced rat fibrosarcoma KMT-17 cells by sodium deoxycholate (DOC) extraction. Significant responses detected by the footpad assay and Winn assay were demonstrated in rats immunized with DOC extract. However, rats previously immunized with DOC extract showed a significant enhancement of tumor growth when challenged with KMT-17 cells. This enhancement was specific for the tumor line used. The tumor-neutralizing ability of KMT-17 immune spleen cells was abrogated when DOC extract immune spleen cells were added to a mixture of KMT-17 cells and KMT-17 immune spleen cells. This suppressive activity of the spleen cells was diminished by the treatment with anti T serum and complement. After fractionation of DOC extract immune spleen cells by the Ficoll density gradient, the cells in the light layer showed an enhancing effect on tumor growth, whereas the cells in the heavier region of the gradient had an inhibiting effect. These results suggested that both immunosuppressor cells and cytotoxic cells were induced in rats immunized with DOC extract.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23649186>B-cell depletion with rituximab in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis refractory to ursodeoxycholic .</a></h2><p>Rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that selectively depletes B cells, has shown promise in autoantibody-associated, immune-mediated disorders. As ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is not successful in all patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), additional treatment options are necessary. The objective of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of rituximab in patients with PBC refractory to UDCA.Fourteen PBC patients refractory to UDCA received two rituximab infusions (1,000 mg) 2 weeks apart. The primary efficacy outcome was normalization and/or 25% improvement in serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) concentration at 6 months.The median age was 53 years, and 92% were female and antimitochondrial antibody (AMA) positive. The median UDCA dosage was 15.3 mg/kg/day (interquartile range 14.5-17.8). Although rituximab was well tolerated, one patient withdrew due to an asthma exacerbation during the first infusion. Effective B-cell depletion was observed in the remaining 13 patients, including three that developed human anti-chimeric antibodies. ALP normalization and/or ≥ 25% improvement was observed in three patients (23%) at 6, 12, and 18 months. Significant reductions in median ALP (from 259 U/l at baseline to 213 U/l at 6 months; median decrease 16%), and serum IgM and AMA levels were observed at 6 months. Although fatigue was stable, pruritus improved in 60% of patients at 12 months (vs. 8% with worsening pruritus).Selective B-cell depletion with rituximab was safe and associated with a significant decrease in autoantibody production, but had limited biochemical efficacy in PBC patients with an incomplete response to UDCA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16184542>Recurrent primary biliary cirrhosis: peritransplant factors and ursodeoxycholic  treatment post-liver transplant.</a></h2><p>Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) recurs after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) in up to one-third of patients. These patients are typically asymptomatic, can be identified by abnormal liver biochemistries, and have evidence of histologic recurrence on liver biopsy. The effect of treatment on recurrence has not been determined. This pilot study evaluates the factors associated with recurrent PBC and describes our experience using ursodeoxycholic  treatment in this patient population. Forty-eight patients with PBC were followed for at least 1 yr post-OLT, and 27 patients (56%) developed abnormal serum alkaline phosphatase. Seventeen patients (35%) had evidence of recurrent PBC by liver biopsy. Patients with recurrent PBC had a trend toward longer warm ischemia times and more episodes of acute cellular rejection in the first year posttransplant, but this was not significant in multivariate analysis. Donor or recipient age, donor and recipient cytomegalovirus status, and dose of immunosuppression did not correlate with recurrence of PBC. Those patients diagnosed with recurrent PBC were placed on ursodeoxycholic , 15 mg/kg daily, with improvement in serum alkaline phosphatase in the majority. In conclusion, recurrent PBC is not infrequent post-OLT, and ursodeoxycholic  can be used with some benefit post-OLT.

Timely intervention with ursodeoxycholic  is associated with excellent survival, although approximately one-third of all patients fail to achieve biochemical response, signifying a critical need for additional therapeutic strategies. Obeticholic  (OCA) is a potent ligand of the nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR). Activation of FXR inhibits bile  synthesis and protects against toxic accumulation in models of cholestasis and facilitates hepatic regeneration in preclinical studies. Data from recent Phase II and III controlled trials suggest a therapeutic impact of OCA in PBC biochemical nonresponders, as evidenced by change in proven laboratory surrogates of long-term outcome. Dose-dependent pruritus is a common adverse effect, but may be overcome through dose-titration.

We studied toxicity, drug concentrations and localization, and quantitative infection concurrently, using a 4-day model of central nervous system (CNS) aspergillosis to assess early events. Mice given Aspergillus fumigatus conidia intracerebrally, under a cyclophosphamide immunosuppressive regimen, were treated for 3 days (AmBisome at 3 or 10 mg/kg of body weight, Abelcet at 10 mg/kg, amphotericin B deoxycholate at 1 mg/kg, caspofungin at 5 mg/kg, or voriconazole at 40 mg/kg). Sampling 24 h after the last treatment showed that AmBisome at 3 but not at 10 mg/kg, as well as Abelcet, caspofungin, and voriconazole, reduced brain CFU. All regimens reduced renal infection. Minor renal tubular changes occurred with AmBisome or Abelcet therapy, whereas heart, lung, and brain showed no drug toxicity. Amphotericin B tissue and serum concentrations did not correlate with efficacy. Endothelial cell activation (ICAM-1 and P-selectin in cerebral capillaries) occurred during infection. Amphotericin B derived from AmBisome and Abelcet localized in activated endothelium and from Abelcet in intravascular monocytes. In 10-day studies dosing uninfected mice, minor renal tubular changes occurred after AmBisome or Abelcet at 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg with or without cyclophosphamide treatment; nephrosis occurred only with Abelcet in cyclophosphamide-treated mice. Hepatotoxicity occurred with AmBisome and Abelcet but was reduced in cyclophosphamide-treated mice. Marked CFU reduction by AmBisome at 3 mg/kg occurred in association with relatively more intense inflammation. Abelcet renal localization appears to be a precursor to late nephrotoxicity. Hepatotoxicity may contribute to high-dose Abelcet and AmBisome failures. Our novel observation of endothelial amphotericin localization during infection may contribute to amphotericin mechanism of efficacy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24372568>Review article: controversies in the management of primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis.</a></h2><p>Despite considerable advances over the last two decades in the molecular understanding of cholestasis and cholestatic liver disease, little improvement has been made in diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies.To critically review controversial aspects of the scientific basis for common clinical practice in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and to discuss key ongoing challenges to improve patient management.We performed a literature search using PubMed and by examining the reference lists of relevant review articles related to the clinical management of PBC and PSC. Articles were considered on the background of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) practice guidelines and clinical experience of the authors.Ongoing challenges in PBC mainly pertain to the improvement of medical therapy, particularly for patients with a suboptimal response to ursodeoxycholic . In PSC, development of medical therapies and sensitive screening protocols for cholangiocarcinoma represent areas of intense research. To rationally improve patient management, a better understanding of pathogenesis, including complications like pruritis and fatigue, is needed and there is a need to identify biomarker end-points for treatment effect and prognosis. Timing of liver transplantation and determining optimal regimens of immunosuppression post-liver transplantation will also benefit from better appreciation of pre-transplant disease mechanisms.Controversies in the management of PBC and PSC relate to topics where evidence for current practice is weak and further research is needed.© 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4660539>The effect of deoxycholate on cholera vaccine.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15816485>Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) suppresses liver interleukin 2 mRNA in the cholangitis model.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is used globally as the drug of first choice for the treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). The mechanism by which UDCA exerts its effect has been clarified mainly by in vitro studies. However, no other studies have so far been successful in defining the expression profiles of relevant cytokines in experimental PBC models.In this study, we established an immune-mediated cholangitis mouse model by immunizing mice with an intraperitoneal injection of carbonic anhydrase (CA)-II every other week, for a total of three injections. After the administration of UDCA, the animals were examined for the hepatic histopathology and liver enzyme levels in the serum, as well as the cytokine mRNA contents in the liver.After the administration of UDCA, peribiliary cell invasion decreased, but the change of hepatic enzyme was not observed. The quantities of interleukin (IL)-2 mRNA in the liver were all elevated in the CA-II group as compared with the control group in a semiquantitative assay. The quantities of IL-2 mRNA were significantly decreased in the CA-II+UDCA group compared with the CA-II group. UDCA suppressed the production of IL-2 and had the tendency to suppress the production of IL-4, and the suppression of IL-2 was predominant, compared to the suppression of IL-4, but UDCA did not significantly effect the expression of interferon (IFN)-gamma mRNA, IL-6 mRNA, IL-10 mRNA.UDCA predominantly suppressed IL-2 mRNA compared to IL-4 mRNA in the liver of the cholangitis model.

A proteoliposome-derived adjuvant from Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B (AFPL1, Adjuvant Finlay Proteoliposome 1) and its derived cochleate form (Co, AFCo1) contain multiple pathogen-associated molecular patterns as immunopotentiators, and can also serve as delivery systems to elicit a Th1-type immune response. The present studies demonstrate the ability of AFPL1and AFCo1 to induce mucosal and systemic immune responses by different mucosal immunizations routes and significant adjuvant activity for antibody responses of both structures: a microparticle and a nanoparticle with a heterologous antigen. Therefore, we used female mice immunized by intragastric, intravaginal, intranasal or intramuscular routes with both structures alone or incorporated with ovalbumin (OVA). High levels of specific IgG antibody were detected in all sera and in vaginal washes, but specific IgA antibody in external secretions was only detected in mucosally immunized mice. Furthermore, antigen specific IgG1 and IgG2a isotypes were all induced. AFPL1 and AFCo1 are capable of inducing IFN-gamma responses, and chemokine secretions, like MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta. However, AFCo1 is a better alternative to induce immune responses at mucosal level. Even when we use a heterologous antigen, the AFCo1 response was better than with AFPL1 in inducing mucosal and systemic immune responses. These results support the use of AFCo1 as a potent Th1 inducing adjuvant particularly suitable for mucosal immunization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4613135>Oral immunization with an extract of Escherichia coli enteritidis.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/873130>Radioimmunoassay of bile acids: development, validation, and preliminary application of an assay for conjugates of chenodeoxycholic .</a></h2><p>A rapid, sensitive, precise radioimmunoassay for conjugates of chenodeoxycholic (chenic)  has been developed and validated. Immunogen was prepared with chenylglycine couples to bovine serum albumin, emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant, and injected intracutaneously in rabbits. Antibodies of moderate titer (used at 1:7500 final dilution) were obtained. Tracer of high specific activity was prepared by reductive tritiation of delta11-chenylglycine. The binding step required 1 hr at room temperature; separation of bound tracer was achieved by addition of ammonium sulfate. The limit of sensitivity of the assay was about 20 nmoles per liter, and the lower limit of the working range was 0.4 mumole per liter. The assay was validated by measuring levels in samples of fasting state serum to which known amounts of chenylglycine had been added; the assay was also validated by means of gas-liquid chromatography on sera from jaundiced patients. The median fasting state serum level in 56 Caucasians and blacks was 0.9 mumole per liter (upper limit of normal (95% confidence) being 2.3), which is in the same range as that reported by others using gas-liquid chromatography.

To date, fusogenic protein-incorporated liposomes and pH-responsive polymer-modified liposomes have been used to achieve cytoplasmic delivery of antigen via membrane rupture or fusion with endosomes. However, a more versatile cytoplasmic delivery system is desired for practical use. For this study, we developed pH-responsive micelles composed of dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine (DLPC) and  and investigated their cytoplasmic delivery performance and immunity-inducing capability. (2) Methods: Interaction of micelles with fluorescence dye-loaded liposomes, intracellular distribution of micelles, and antigenic proteins were observed. Finally, antigen-specific cellular immune response was evaluated in vivo using ELIspot assay. (3) Results: Micelles induced leakage of contents from liposomes via lipid mixing at low pH. Micelles were taken up by dendritic cells mainly via macropinocytosis and delivered ovalbumin (OVA) into the cytosol. After intradermal injection of micelles and OVA, OVA-specific cellular immunity was induced in the spleen. (4) Conclusions: pH-responsive micelles composed of DLPC and  are promising as enhancers of cytosol delivery of antigens and the induction capability of cellular immunity for the treatment of cancer  and infectious diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4570987>Degree of immunity induced by killed vaccines to experimental salmonellosis in mice.</a></h2><p>Killed vaccines, deoxycholate-extracted or heated, were shown to induce an effective degree of immunity which protected against death (100%), prevented extensive multiplication, and left the mice with low residual salmonella populations in spleen and liver after intravenous (iv) or intraperitoneal (ip) challenge with virulent Salmonella typhimurium. Protection was most effective against the ip challenge route and less effective against the iv route. A study of the kinetics of the population of bacteria in the spleens and livers of immunized animals showed that after ip challenge there was an initial reduction of 99% at 6 hr after challenge, maintenance of levels of less than 10(3) bacteria per organ, and a final population of 10(2) to 10(3) per organ at 21 days. With iv challenge, after an initial reduction of 90% at 6 hr, growth ensued to levels above 10(6) bacteria per organ until 8 days, followed by a steady decline yielding residual populations of 10(3) to 10(4) in some cases. Organ hypertrophy correlated with bacterial population. Morbidity was prevented (as measured by gain in body weight) by immunization against ip challenge but not against iv challenge. Killed vaccines protected by their ability to induce an immune state which reduced the initial challenge population, prevented extensive multiplication, yet allowed "cellular immunity" to develop due to response to the living challenge infection itself. The consequence was a low-level carrier state similar to that induced by recovery from sublethal virulent infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16313328>Ursodeoxycholic  treatment in isolated chronic graft-vs.-host disease of the liver.</a></h2><p>Data regarding the long-term treatment of ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) in individuals of chronic graft-vs.-host disease (cGVHD) of the liver are limited. The aims of this prospective study were to determine whether, (i) UDCA treatment is useful as a long-term treatment for individuals with limited cGVHD of the liver following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, and (ii) the tolerability of UDCA treatment in such individuals.Fifteen consecutive patients with de novo isolated cGVHD of the liver were included. All individuals were treated with UDCA at a dose of 13 mg/kg/d for 1 yr. Clinical evaluation and laboratory testing were assessed at 30-d intervals during UDCA therapy and every 30 d after discontinuation of UDCA for a total of 3 months.At the end of the treatment, 60% of patients with cGVHD of the liver had normal liver tests, the remaining 40% of patients demonstrated improvement in their abnormal liver tests (partial responders), whereas none of the patients had worsening of the liver tests. When compared with baseline, there was a significant decrease in the serum aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels after completion of the UDCA treatment at 12 months (p < 0.01). No significant increase in serum liver enzyme tests was observed at the third month after the completion of therapy. Pruritus in seven of nine patients resolved after UDCA treatment. All patients completed their assigned treatment with no major adverse event.Long-term UDCA therapy appears to be effective, safe and tolerable in individuals with cGVHD presenting with isolated liver involvement.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16143950>Future Treatment Options in PBC.</a></h2><p>Because the etiopathogenesis of PBC is incompletely defined, curative therapies have not been identified, and the focus has been on prevention of disease progression. Ursodeoxycholic  retards progression and is likely to be combined with newer therapies in future trials. Advances in our understanding of the roles of retroviral infection and autoimmune responses of T and B cells to PBC-specific autoantigens provides rationales for studies of the safety and efficacy of antiretroviral, immunosuppressive, and immunomodulatory agents in PBC. Promising options include inhibition of (1) T-cell activation and proliferation; (2) transendothelial migration and activation of effector cells; (4) cytokine and immunoglobulin effector mechanisms; and (5) inflammation and oxidation. Depletion and immunomodulation of T and B cells may provide opportunities to thwart re-emergence of effector mechanisms. Induction of tolerance in susceptible people before onset of disease or of hyporesponsiveness in established disease is increasingly feasible, as is prevention of biliary fibrosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29593060>The British Society of Gastroenterology/UK-PBC primary biliary cholangitis treatment and management guidelines.</a></h2><p>Primary biliary cholangitis (formerly known as primary biliary cirrhosis, PBC) is an autoimmune liver disease in which a cycle of immune mediated biliary epithelial cell injury, cholestasis and progressive fibrosis can culminate over time in an end-stage biliary cirrhosis. Both genetic and environmental influences are presumed relevant to disease initiation. PBC is most prevalent in women and those over the age of 50, but a spectrum of disease is recognised in adult patients globally; male sex, younger age at onset (<45) and advanced disease at presentation are baseline predictors of poorer outcome. As the disease is increasingly diagnosed through the combination of cholestatic serum liver tests and the presence of antimitochondrial antibodies, most presenting patients are not cirrhotic and the term cholangitis is more accurate. Disease course is frequently accompanied by symptoms that can be burdensome for patients, and management of patients with PBC must address, in a life-long manner, both disease progression and symptom burden. Licensed therapies include ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) and obeticholic  (OCA), alongside experimental new and re-purposed agents. Disease management focuses on initiation of UDCA for all patients and risk stratification based on baseline and on-treatment factors, including in particular the response to treatment. Those intolerant of treatment with UDCA or those with high-risk disease as evidenced by UDCA treatment failure (frequently reflected in trial and clinical practice as an alkaline phosphatase >1.67 × upper limit of normal and/or elevated bilirubin) should be considered for second-line therapy, of which OCA is the only currently licensed National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended agent. Follow-up of patients is life-long and must address treatment of the disease and management of associated symptoms.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

Confirmative diagnosis of this disorder can prove difficult early post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, as a broad differential diagnosis exists and no definitive diagnostic test is available. Incidence of VOD has decreased in recent years, with especially dramatic declines in severe and fatal VOD. This improvement is attributed to less toxic and reduced-intensity conditioning regimens, and more appropriate patient selection. When severe VOD does occur, current treatments have been largely ineffective. Prevention remains the primary tool in the clinician's arsenal for managing VOD. Our institution pursues aggressive preventative measures for VOD, including appropriate conditioning regimen selection, avoiding hepatotoxic drugs, early prophylactic use of ursodiol, and aggressive fluid management. With appropriate management steps, we believe the incidence of VOD and related deaths can be further decreased.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12054701>Immunoaffinity-isolated antigens induce protective immunity against larval Strongyloides stercoralis in mice.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to identify soluble protein antigens that would induce protective immunity against infective-stage larvae (L-3) of Strongyloides stercoralis in mice. Deoxycholate (DOC)-soluble proteins derived from L-3, adsorbed to aluminum hydroxide, induced protective immunity in BALB/c mice. The immunized mice generated parasite-specific IgG that could transfer passive immunity to naïve animals. The protective antibodies bound to parasite antigens found in the muscles and nerve cords of the L-3. An IgG affinity chromatography column generated with IgG from the sera of DOC-immunized mice was used to purify specific larval antigens. Proteins were eluted from the affinity column with sizes of 80, 75, 61, 57, 43, and 32 kDa. This antigen pool stimulated both proliferation and IL-5 production by splenocytes recovered from mice immunized with live L-3. Vaccination of mice with the immunoaffinity-isolated antigens led to significant protective immunity, with 83% of challenge larvae killed. This study demonstrates that IgG-isolated proteins are candidate antigens for a vaccine against larval S. stercoralis.(c) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1505915>Differential effects of chenodeoxycholic and ursodeoxycholic acids on interleukin 1, interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha production by monocytes.</a></h2><p>Cell-mediated immunity and macrophage activity, especially that of Kupffer cells, are impaired during cholestasis. Some evidence exists that bile acids play a role in these immune defects. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of individual bile acids on immunity and to determine whether monocytes could be a target. We assessed the effects of chenodeoxycholic , an endogenous bile , ursodeoxycholic , which has been shown to partially correct the immunological abnormalities observed in primary biliary cirrhosis, and their tauroconjugates on the production of interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Chenodeoxycholic  had a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on interleukin-1 (inhibitory concentration 50% = 60 mumol/L), interleukin-6 (inhibitory concentration 50% = 80 mumol/L) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (inhibitory concentration 50% = 80 mumol/L) production; inhibition was almost complete at 250 mumol/L. In contrast, ursodeoxycholic  had lesser or minimal inhibitory effects (inhibitory concentration 50% = 100 mumol/L for interleukin-1 and above 200 mumol/L for interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha). The inhibitory effects of taurochenodeoxy-cholic  and tauroursodeoxycholic  were similar to those of chenodeoxycholic  and ursodeoxycholic , respectively. Ursodeoxycholic  did not reverse the chenodeoxycholic -induced inhibition of interleukin-6 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha production. In conclusion, chenodeoxycholic  exerts strong inhibitory effects on monocyte activity in vitro, whereas the effects of ursodeoxycholic  are minor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24979350>Bet v 1--a Trojan horse for small ligands boosting allergic sensitization?</a></h2><p>Birch pollen allergy represents the main cause of winter and spring pollinosis in the temperate climate zone of the northern hemisphere and sensitization towards Bet v 1, the major birch pollen allergen, affects over 100 million allergic patients. The major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 has been described as promiscuous acceptor for a wide variety of hydrophobic ligands.In search of intrinsic properties of Bet v 1, which account responsible for the high allergenic potential of the protein, we thought to investigate the effects of ligand-binding on immunogenic as well as allergenic properties.As surrogate ligand of Bet v 1 sodium deoxycholate (DOC) was selected. Recombinant and natural Bet v 1 were characterised physico-chemically as well as immunologically in the presence or absence of DOC, and an animal model of allergic sensitization was established. Moreover, human IgE binding to Bet v 1 was analysed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.Ligand-binding had an overall stabilizing effect on Bet v 1. This translated in a Th2 skewing of the immune response in a mouse model. Analyses of human IgE binding on Bet v 1 in mediator release assays revealed that ligand-bound allergen-induced degranulation at lower concentrations; however, in basophil activation tests with human basophils ligand-binding did not show this effect. For the first time, human IgE epitopes on Bet v 1 were determined using antibodies isolated from patients' sera. The IgE epitope mapping of Bet v 1 demonstrated the presence of multiple binding regions.Deoxycholate binding stabilizes conformational IgE epitopes on Bet v 1; however, the epitopes themselves remain unaltered. Therefore, we speculate that humans are exposed to both ligand-bound and free Bet v 1 during sensitization, disclosing the ligand-binding cavity of the allergen as key structural element.© 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30259849>Work in Progress: Drugs in Development.</a></h2><p>Primary biliary cholangitis is an archetypal autoimmune disease that causes cholestasis, fibrosis, and liver failure.

IPE was found to be induced by a lipid-solvent-sensitive, filterable replicating agent present in line Ib leukemic cell suspensions. IPE was serially transmitted in immunosuppressed mice with filtered extracts of spleens from diseased animals. The IPE-inducing activity of Ib cell extracts was abolished by chloroform or deoxycholate. Gel filtration of Ib cell extracts showed that the IPE agent has a molecular weight of at least 10(7). Electron microscopy of the active fractions from columns and of spinal cord extracts from mice with IPE revealed a virus-like particle, 40 nm in diameter, which is probably the IPE revealed a virus-like particle, 40 nm in diameter, which is probably the IPE agent. Administration of cyclophosphamide at various times after challenge increased the incidence of IPE in mice, suggesting that IPE is not autoimmune mediated. Immunosuppression resulted in maintenance of high levels of IPE agent in the central nervous system tissue, while immunization resulted in low levels. Moreover, immunized mice produced neutralizing antibodies. These data suggest that antibodies help restrict the amount of IPE agent in the nervous tissue, and that this restriction is required for resistance to IPE induction in C58 mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/239847>Some properties of adenovirus 12-induced transplantation antigen, as measured by the macrophage migration inhibition test.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21929484>Adverse events associated with 2010 CSL and other inactivated influenza vaccines.</a></h2><p>The 2010 trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) manufactured by CSL Biotherapies (CSL) was associated with increased febrile reactions, including febrile convulsions, among Australian children.

Neither group showed any significant difference in magnitude of the increases in serum transaminases and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase following the conditioning regimen that included chemotherapy and total body irradiation. In the 6 months after transplantation, serum enzymes decreased in both groups, but were consistently higher in the placebo treated patients, indicating that ursodeoxycholic enhances normalization of liver. Faecal bile  showed that following chemotherapy and irradiation in which intestinal bacteria are ablated, secondary bile  formation was practically abolished and faeces contained mainly cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids.

Theories of the PBC etiopathogenesis assume that the disease develops secondarily as an improper immunological reaction to undefined environmental and/or infectious factors in genetically predisposed individuals. Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is the only drug recommended to treat PBC; it delays the progression of liver disease, but remains only a symptomatic treatment. In the advanced stage of PBC, the treatment of choice is liver transplantation (LTx). Nowadays, PBC is the third indication for LTx, after viral-related and alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Unfortunately, PBC recurs in 21-37% of patients at 10 years after LTx, and in 43% at 15 years after LTx, with the median time to recurrence of 3-5.5 years. Diagnosis of recurrent PBC (rPBC) is based on the liver histopathology. Although various risk factors of rPBC have been investigated, the cause of the recurrence is not clear. There is no specific treatment of rPBC. Together with immunosuppression after LTx, UDCA remains the treatment of choice. New diagnostic technologies (e.g., genomics, proteomics, cell-based therapy, and clinical study of the rPBC patients) may be helpful in understanding the pathogenesis of PBC and the development of new treatment modalities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7824880>A possible role of ursodeoxycholic  in liver transplantation.</a></h2><p>There are many different causes of graft dysfunction and cholestasis after liver transplantation. These include non-primary function, preservation and reperfusion injury, acute rejection, artery thrombosis, drug toxicity, bile leakage, and bile duct stenosis. Medication with ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) has beneficial effects in different cholestatic conditions. The initial rationale for its use after liver transplantation was to alter the bile  pool to a more atoxic composition, as liver transplantation can be associated with cholestasis and can stimulate the initial bile production. We have consecutively treated 41 patients with primary graft function with UDCA. During the first postoperative month, 17% of the UDCA treated patients had an episode of acute rejection compared with 75% of a historical control group of 8 patients. The results suggest that adjuvant treatment with UDCA reduces acute liver graft rejection. This has to be confirmed by controlled prospective trials; one is presently being carried out in the Nordic countries. Several studies have indicated an immunomodulating capacity of this bile  and we have recently reported our results from a heart transplant model in the rat, where treatment with UDCA prolonged graft survival. Improvement in surgical technique and postoperative care as well as immunosuppressive treatment has improved the results of liver transplantation. Acute rejection is nowadays a dominating problem after liver transplantation and the inclusion of UDCA may reduce morbidity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31496690>Intestinal transport mechanism and in vivo anticancer efficacy of a solid oral formulation incorporating an ion-pairing complex of pemetrexed with  derivative.</a></h2><p>The rational combination of  with standard chemotherapy shows synergistic clinical activities in cancer treatment. In the present study, an oral powder formulation of pemetrexed (PMX) was developed to enhance intestinal membrane permeability and investigate its application in metronomic chemotherapy in combination with .PMX was ionically complexed with a bile  derivative (N-deoxycholyl-l-lysyl-methylester; DCK) as a permeation enhancer and mixed with dispersing agents, such as poloxamer 188 (P188) and Labrasol, to form an amorphous oral powder formulation of PMX/DCK (PMX/DCK-OP).The apparent permeability (P) of PMX/DCK-OP across a Caco-2 cell monolayer was 2.46- and 8.26-fold greater than that of PMX/DCK and free PMX, respectively, which may have been due to the specific interaction of DCK with bile  transporters, as well as the alteration of membrane fluidity due to Labrasol and P188. Furthermore, inhibition of bile  transporters by actinomycin D in Caco-2 cell monolayers decreased the P of PMX/DCK-OP by 75.4%, suggesting a predominant role of bile  transporters in the intestinal absorption of PMX/DCK-OP. In addition, caveola/lipid raft-dependent endocytosis, macropinocytosis, passive diffusion, and paracellular transport mechanisms significantly influenced the permeation of PMX/DCK-OP through the intestinal membrane. Therefore, the oral bioavailability of PMX/DCK-OP in rats was 19.8%±6.93%, which was 294% higher than that of oral PMX. Moreover, an in vivo anticancer efficacy study in B16F10 cell-bearing mice treated with a combination of oral PMX/DCK-OP and intraperitoneal anti-PD1 exhibited significant suppression of tumor growth, and the tumor volume was maximally inhibited by 2.03- and 3.16-fold compared to the oral PMX/DCK-OP and control groups, respectively.These findings indicated the therapeutic potential of a combination of low-dose oral chemotherapy and  for synergistic anticancer efficacy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15457969>[Cholestatic liver diseases].</a></h2><p>Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), autoimmune cholangitis (AIC = AMA-negative PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) are autoimmune cholestatic liver diseases.

All PBC patients with abnormal liver biochemistry should be considered for therapy. Ursodeoxycholic  (URSO) treatment reduces intracellular hydrophobic bile  levels and thereby may have a cytoprotective effect on cell membranes. URSO may also act as an immunomodulating agent.

The treatment was well tolerated by all patients.In PBC, combined treatment with UDCA and prednisone appears to improve symptoms and biochemical parameters to a larger extent than either treatment alone; randomized controlled trials should be performed to establish the benefit/risk ratio of this combination therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4208619>Capsular and somatic antigens of Pasteurella multocida, types B and E.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17446015>Cationic transfersomes based topical genetic vaccine against hepatitis B.</a></h2><p>DNA vaccines have been shown to elicit both cellular and humoral immune responses and to be effective in a variety of preclinical bacterial, viral, and parasitic animal models. We have recently described a needle-free method of vaccination, transcutaneous immunization, based on topical application of vaccine antigens on intact skin using a novel carrier system, namely transfersomes. In the present study, a novel modified version of transfersomes, i.e., cationic transfersomes for topical DNA vaccine delivery has been developed. Cationic transfersomes composed of cationic lipid DOTMA and sodium deoxycholate as constitutive lipids were prepared and optimized for their size, shape, zeta potentials, deformability and loading efficiency. Plasmid DNA encoding hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was loaded in the cationic transfersomes using charge neutralization method. The immune stimulating activity was studied by measuring serum anti-HBsAg titer and cytokines level (IL-2 and IFN-gamma) following topical applications of plasmid DNA loaded cationic transfersomes in Balb/c mice and results were compared with naked DNA applied topically as well as naked DNA and pure recombinant HBsAg administered intramuscularly. Results revealed that DNA loaded cationic transfersomes elicited significantly (*P<0.05) higher anti-HBsAg antibody titer and cytokines level as compared to naked DNA. It was also observed that topical application of DNA loaded cationic transfersomes elicited a comparable serum antibody titer and endogenous cytokines levels as produced after intramuscular recombinant HBsAg administration. The study signifies the potential of cationic transfersomes as DNA vaccine carriers for effective topical immunization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30017646>Pretreatment prediction of response to ursodeoxycholic  in primary biliary cholangitis: development and validation of the UDCA Response Score.</a></h2><p>Treatment guidelines recommend a stepwise approach to primary biliary cholangitis: all patients begin treatment with ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) monotherapy and those with an inadequate biochemical response after 12 months are subsequently considered for second-line therapies. However, as a result, patients at the highest risk can wait the longest for effective treatment. We determined whether UDCA response can be accurately predicted using pretreatment clinical parameters.We did logistic regression analysis of pretreatment variables in a discovery cohort of patients in the UK with primary biliary cholangitis to derive the best-fitting model of UDCA response, defined as alkaline phosphatase less than 1·67 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), measured after 12 months of treatment with UDCA. We validated the model in an external cohort of patients with primary biliary cholangitis and treated with UDCA in Italy. Additionally, we assessed correlations between model predictions and key histological features, such as biliary injury and fibrosis, on liver biopsy samples.2703 participants diagnosed with primary biliary cholangitis between Jan 1, 1998, and May 31, 2015, were included in the UK-PBC cohort for derivation of the model. The following pretreatment parameters were associated with lower probability of UDCA response: higher alkaline phosphatase concentration (p<0·0001), higher total bilirubin concentration (p=0·0003), lower aminotransferase concentration (p=0·0012), younger age (p<0·0001), longer interval from diagnosis to the start of UDCA treatment (treatment time lag, p<0·0001), and worsening of alkaline phosphatase concentration from diagnosis (p<0·0001). Based on these variables, we derived a predictive score of UDCA response. In the external validation cohort, 460 patients diagnosed with primary biliary cholangitis were treated with UDCA, with follow-up data until May 31, 2016. In this validation cohort, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the score was 0·83 (95% CI 0·79-0·87). In 20 liver biopsy samples from patients with primary biliary cholangitis, the UDCA response score was associated with ductular reaction (r=-0·556, p=0·0130) and intermediate hepatocytes (probability of response was 0·90 if intermediate hepatocytes were absent vs 0·51 if present).We have derived and externally validated a model based on pretreatment variables that accurately predicts UDCA response. Association with histological features provides face validity. This model provides a basis to explore alternative approaches to treatment stratification in patients with primary biliary cholangitis.UK Medical Research Council and University of Milan-Bicocca.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

A major problem is how to manage patients who had invasive aspergillosis during remission induction and consolidation therapy and then undergo SCT. Indeed in these patients the mortality rate related to invasive aspergillosis recurrence remains unacceptably high. We report two cases of patients who underwent remission induction for AML, developed invasive aspergillosis during antifungal prophylaxis with itraconazole, failed amphotericin B deoxycholate and liposomal amphotericin B treatment, were successfully treated with voriconazole and eventually underwent SCT with voriconazole prophylaxis without reactivation of invasive aspergillosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11530998>Suppression of renal disease and mortality in the female NZB x NZW F1 mouse model of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) by chenodeoxycholic .</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to examine the effects of ursodeoxycholic (UDCA) and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) on autoimmune disease in the NZB x NZW F1 (B/W) mouse model of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The development of murine lupus was assessed in female B/W mice given UDCA or CDCA. At 6 week intervals mice were examined for weight change, albuminuria, anti-DNA antibody and total IgG levels. Morbidity and mortality were assessed daily. UDCA- and CDCA-treated mice were examined at 24 weeks of age for serum cytokines, lymphocyte phenotype, and in vitro cytokine production after immunization with DNP-KLH. Liver and kidneys were examined histopathologically. The administration of UDCA and CDCA was tolerated without side effects. Weight gain in UDCA- or CDCA-treated and control mice was identical through 24 weeks of age. CDCA, but not UDCA, suppressed the development of renal disease. CDCA-treated B/W mice also had improved survival compared to UDCA-treated or control B/W mice. There were no significant effects of CDCA on anti-DNA antibodies, serum total IgG, or other immunologic parameters. CDCA-treated mice had lower serum IFN-gamma concentrations compared to control and UDCA-treated mice. The bile , CDCA, significantly inhibited the development of renal disease and modestly prolonged lifespan in the female B/W mouse model of SLE. Suppression of glomerulonephritis was associated with lower serum IFNgamma concentrations. Further investigation is needed to verify potential mechanisms of action, but these findings suggest that bile acids may alter the development or progression of autoimmunity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3996524>Taenia pisiformis: protective immunization of rabbits with solubilized oncospheral antigens.</a></h2><p>Antigens were derived from hatched and activated oncospheres of Taenia pisiformis which had been separated from embryophoric debris by centrifugation on Percoll. Crude oncospheral antigen was prepared by freeze-thawing and sonication of oncospheres at 4 C, and a supernatant of crude antigen was collected following centrifugation at 100,000g. Other antigens tested were the supernatants collected after 100,000g centrifugation of crude antigen solubilized in Triton X-100, butanol, lithium diiodosalicylic , KCl, sodium dodecyl sulfate, or sodium deoxycholate. When groups of rabbits were immunized with the various antigens and challenged with T. pisiformis eggs, both sodium deoxycholate- and Triton X-100-solubilized antigens stimulated a level of protection similar to the crude antigen. All other antigens failed to stimulate significant protective immunity. When sodium deoxycholate-solubilized antigen was fractionated using high-performance liquid chromatography, the major host-protective components were in the fractions with molecular weight greater than 140,000. Levels of the enzyme, glutamate dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.2), in the serum of rabbits challenged with T. pisiformis eggs closely reflected the degree of liver damage caused by migrating larvae, and were not markedly elevated in those rabbits effectively immunized using the crude or sodium deoxycholate-solubilized antigens.</p></html>
