Screening skin metabolites could unravel the pathophysiology of  and provide new diagnostic approaches. Due to the lack of suitable methodologies for collecting scarce amounts of skin excretions, the psoriatic skin metabolome has not been extensively studied.We implemented biocompatible hydrogel micropatch probes combined with mass spectrometry to investigate the skin metabolome. This noninvasive approach was applied to examine samples obtained from 100 psoriatic patients and 100 healthy individuals. We also developed custom data treatment tools and used chemometric and statistical tools to reveal the alterations in the skin metabolome caused by .The proposed methodology enabled us to capture alterations in the composition of skin excretions caused by the disease. Chemometric analysis revealed the major differences between the metabolomes of psoriatic skin and healthy skin. Several polar metabolites were positively (choline and glutamic ) or negatively ( and citrulline) correlated with the plaque severity scores. The amounts of these metabolites in the excretions sampled from psoriatic skin were significantly different (P < 0.001) from the excretions sampled from healthy skin. The role of biological variability and various confounding factors, which might affect the skin metabolome, was also investigated.Sampling lesional and healthy skin with the hydrogel micropatch probes and subsequent direct mass spectrometry scanning provided information on the alterations in the skin metabolome caused by , increasing the understanding of the complex pathophysiology of this disease.Â© 2016 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25539991>Current knowledge in Polypodium leucotomos effect on skin protection.</a></h2><p>This article provides an overview of pharmacology, toxicity, pharmacokinetics and clinical data of Polypodium leucotomos L. (PL). PL aerial part has proven to exert antioxidant, photoprotective and immunomodulatory activities; its mechanism of action is complex and includes several activities: (1) PL diminishes the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS, RNS); (2) PL inhibits the photoisomerization of trans- (t-UCA); (3) PL inhibits apoptosis induced by ultraviolet radiation; (4) PL prevents damage to genetic material and (5) PL enhances DNA repair. PL is not mutagenic and does not induce acute or chronic toxicity. Its biological effects have been proved in cell cultures, animal models, murine models and in human beings. Photoprotective activity has been assessed in healthy volunteers as well as in patients suffering from several cutaneous diseases such as vitiligo, , idiopathic photodermatosis or melasma. PL results to be an efficient treatment especially for sensitive cutaneous phototypes and adds extra protection when ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure cannot be avoided, such as wide or narrow band UVB phototherapy or treatment with psoralens plus UVA exposure radiation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25842770>Benefits of controlled ultraviolet radiation in the treatment of dermatological diseases.</a></h2><p>Phototherapy is a second-line treatment modality for the most common dermatoses that is safe and effective. Most phototherapy regimens denote the use of ultraviolet (UV) radiation of different wavelengths in the management of several dermatoses. Currently, irradiations with broadband UVB (290-320 nm), narrowband UVB (311-313 nm), 308 nm excimer laser, UVA 1 (340-400 nm), UVA with psoralen (PUVA), and extracorporeal photochemotherapy (photopheresis) are being used. Beneficial effects of UV radiation are far from being completely understood. Dermatoses that may benefit from such approach are numerous, with , parapsoriasis, atopic dermatitis, cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, morphea, and vitiligo vulgaris as main indications. UVB radiation primarily acts on cells at the epidermis and the epidermodermal junction, while UVA radiation affects epidermal and dermal components, especially blood vessels. UVradiation has im- mediate and delayed effects. Immediate effects are the formation of DNA photoproducts and DNA damage leading to apoptosis of heratinocytes, Langerhans cells, activated T-lymphocytes, neutrophils, macrophages, NK cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and mast-cells, cell membrane damage by lipid peroxidation, and isomerization of chromophores such as . Delayed effects include synthesis of prostaglandins and cytokines that play important roles in immune suppression. Systemic and local immune suppression, alteration in cytokine expression (induction of interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist, decrease in IL-2, increase in IL-IO, IL-15), and cell cycle arrest may all contribute to the suppression of disease activity. PUVA is a form of controlled and repeated induction of phototoxic reactions which uses UVA light to activate chemicals known as psoralens. The conjunction of psoralens with epidermal DNA inhibits DNA synthesis and causes cell apoptosis. PUVA also causes an alteration in the expression of cytokines and cytokine receptors. Psoralens interact with RNA, proteins and other cellular components and indirectly modify proteins and lipids via singlet oxygen-mediated reactions or by generating of free radicals. Psoralens and UV radiation also stimulate melanogenesis with variable effects in patients with vitiligo vulgaris. Extracorporealphotopheresis is treatment modality used in management of erythrodermic cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. It is very potent in induction of lymphocyte apoptosis. Despite the introduction of numerous potent bioengineered systemic medications in the field of dermatology, phototherapy remains established, and often preferred, option for the most common dermatoses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30250844>From Early Immunomodulatory Triggers to Immunosuppressive Outcome: Therapeutic Implications of the Complex Interplay Between the Wavebands of Sunlight and the Skin.</a></h2><p>Phototherapy is an efficient treatment for many cutaneous diseases that involve the activation of inflammatory pathways or the overgrowth of cells with aberrant phenotype. In this review, we discuss recent advances in photoimmunology, focusing on the effects of UV-based therapies currently used in dermatology. We describe the molecular responses to the main forms of photo(chemo)therapy such as UVB, UVA-1, and PUVA that include the triggering of apoptotic or immunosuppressive pathways and help to clear diseased skin. The early molecular response to UV involves DNA photoproducts, the isomerization of , the secretion of biophospholipids such as platelet activating factor (PAF), the activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor and inflammasome, and vitamin D synthesis. The simultaneous and complex interaction of these events regulates the activity of the immune system both locally and systemically, resulting in apoptosis of neoplastic and/or benign cells, reduction of cellular infiltrate, and regulation of cytokines and chemokines. Regulatory T-cells and Langerhans cells, among other skin-resident cellular populations, are deeply affected by UV exposure and are therefore important players in the mechanisms of immunomodulation and the therapeutic value of UV in all its forms. We weigh the contribution of these cells to the therapeutic application of UV and how they may participate in transferring the direct impact of UV on the skin into local and systemic immunomodulation. Moreover, we review the therapeutic mechanisms revealed by clinical and laboratory animal investigations in the most common cutaneous diseases treated with phototherapy such as , atopic dermatitis, vitiligo, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Better understanding of phototherapeutic mechanisms in these diseases will help advance treatment in general and make future therapeutic strategies more precise, targeted, personalized, safe, and efficient.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25412785>Phototherapy and photochemotherapy for .</a></h2><p>Phototherapy is a first-line option for the treatment of moderate to severe .
