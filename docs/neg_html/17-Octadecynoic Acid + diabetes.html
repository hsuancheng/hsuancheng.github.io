The cellular mechanisms underlying the increased contribution of EDCF were explored in 16 and 30-week-old male TH and age-matched male C57BL/6J mice (n=4-9). Blood glucose and serum lipid profiles were markedly increased in the TH mice. Superoxide generation, assessed with a lucigenin chemiluminescence assay, was markedly increased in the aortae of TH mice. Endothelium-dependent vascular relaxations and contractions to acetylcholine (ACh), but not endothelium-independent relaxations to sodium nitroprusside, were impaired and vascular contractions to phenylephrine were significantly enhanced in aortae from TH mice. Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester markedly increased the ACh-induced contractions in TH mice, whereas SQ29548, a thromboxane receptor antagonist, and cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibitors  and sulfaphenazole, the latter being specific for CYP2C6 and 2C9, decreased and (or) normalized the contractile response to ACh in TH mice. The present study indicates that enhanced contribution of prostaglandin H2/thromboxane A2 receptor and CYP, likely CYP2C6 and 2C9, play a critical role in the pathogenesis of increased EDCF in the aortae of type 2 diabetic TH mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17027963>Pharmacological characteristics of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor-mediated relaxation of small mesenteric arteries from db/db mice.</a></h2><p>Endothelial dysfunction is considered as a major risk factor of cardiovascular complications of type I and type II . Our previous studies have demonstrated that endothelial dysfunction in the small mesenteric arteries from 12-16 week old type II diabetic mice was associated with decreased bio-availability of nitric oxide whereas endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF)-mediated relaxation was preserved. The objective of the present study was to characterize EDHF-mediated relaxations of small mesenteric arteries from db/db mice. A depolarizing concentration of KCl or tetraethylammonium (TEA, 10 mM) significantly inhibited the EDHF-mediated relaxation to acetylcholine and bradykinin in small mesenteric arteries from both db/+ and db/db mice. Charybdotoxin or iberiotoxin alone and a combination of ouabain and barium significantly reduced the maximal relaxation to acetylcholine in small mesenteric arteries from db/db mice and charybdotoxin or iberiotoxin either alone or in combination with apamin reduced the sensitivity to the EDHF-mediated component of the relaxation response to bradykinin. , but not catalase, significantly reduced the sensitivity to EDHF-mediated responses to bradykinin in db/db mice;  had no effect on acetylcholine-mediated relaxations. No differences were, however, detected for mRNA expression levels of calcium-activated potassium channels or connexins 37, 40, 43 and 45. Collectively, these data suggest that bradykinin-induced, EDHF-dependent relaxation in small mesenteric arteries from db/db mice is mediated via cytochrome P450 product that activates the large conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK(Ca) or Slo) channel, whereas the acetylcholine-induced, EDHF-mediated relaxation involves neither cytochrome P450 product nor hydrogen peroxide.</p></html>
