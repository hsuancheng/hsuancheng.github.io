Ripening in goat's skin caused the differences in chemical compositions of Tulum cheese. Moisture loss, salt-in-moisture, fat and protein contents increased. No residual lactose was observed after 90 day. Lactic acid was principal organic acid, followed by propionic acid, acetic acid, formic acid, succinic acid and citric acid. The majority of amino acids were composed of , Pro, Tyr, Met, Leu, Trp, ,  and Glu. Hexadecanoic acid was the most abundant free fatty acid in the cheeses, which followed by cis-9-octadecenoic, octadecanoic, tetradecanoic, decanoic and trans-9-octadecenoic acids. The levels of total FFA and total OA were higher in GST-cheese in comparison to PBT-cheese but total FAAs were lower.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Comparative anatomy of biochemical pathways is performed using five criteria of homology. Primary homologies of "type I" were defined as several pathways sharing the same enzyme with high specificity for its substrate. Primary homologies of "type II" were defined as the sharing of similar enzymatic functions, cofactors, functional family, or recurrence of a set of reactions. Standard cladistic analysis is used to infer the evolutionary history of metabolic development and the relative ordering of biochemical reactions through time, from a single matrix integrating the whole basic universal metabolism. The cladogram shows that the earliest pathways to emerge are metabolism of amino acids of groups I and II (Asp, Asn, Glu, and Gln). The earliest enzymatic functions are mostly linked to amino acid catabolism: deamination, transamination, and decarboxylation. For some amino acids, catabolism and biosynthesis occur at the same time (Asp, Glu, , and Met). Catabolism precedes anabolism for Asn, Gln, Arg, Trp, His, Tyr, and , and anabolism precedes catabolism for Pro, Ala, Leu, , Ile, Cys, Gly, Ser, and Thr. The urea cycle evolves from arginine synthesis. Metabolism of fatty acids and sugars develops after the full development of metabolism of amino acids of groups I and II, and they are associated with the anabolism of amino acids of groups III and IV. Syntheses of aromatic amino acids are branched within sugar metabolism. The Krebs cycle occurs relatively late after the setting of metabolism of amino acids of groups I and II. One portion of the Krebs cycle has a catabolic origin, whereas the other portion has an anabolic origin in pathways of amino acids of groups III and IV. It is not possible to order  and gluconeogenesis with regard to the Krebs cycle, as they all belong to "period 6." Pentose-phosphate and Calvin cycles are later (periods 7 and 8, respectively). Cladistic analysis of the structure of biochemical pathways makes hypotheses in biochemical evolution explicit and parsimonious.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25575595>Characterization of the pivotal carbon metabolism of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 under ex vivo and chemically defined in vitro conditions by isotopologue profiling.</a></h2><p>Streptococcus suis is a neglected zoonotic pathogen that has to adapt to the nutritional requirements in the different host niches encountered during infection and establishment of invasive diseases. To dissect the central metabolic activity of S. suis under different conditions of nutrient availability, we performed labeling experiments starting from [(13)C]glucose specimens and analyzed the resulting isotopologue patterns in amino acids of S. suis grown under in vitro and ex vivo conditions. In combination with classical growth experiments, we found that S. suis is auxotrophic for Arg, Gln/Glu, His, Leu, and Trp in chemically defined medium. De novo biosynthesis was shown for Ala, Asp, Ser, and Thr at high rates and for Gly, , , Tyr, and  at moderate or low rates, respectively. Glucose degradation occurred mainly by  and to a minor extent by the pentose phosphate pathway. Furthermore, the exclusive formation of oxaloacetate by phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylation became evident from the patterns in de novo synthesized amino acids. Labeling experiments with S. suis grown ex vivo in blood or cerebrospinal fluid reflected the metabolic adaptation to these host niches with different nutrient availability; however, similar key metabolic activities were identified under these conditions. This points at the robustness of the core metabolic pathways in S. suis during the infection process. The crucial role of PEP carboxylation for growth of S. suis in the host was supported by experiments with a PEP carboxylase-deficient mutant strain in blood and cerebrospinal fluid.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30394608>In vivo detection of protein cysteine sulfenylation in plastids.</a></h2><p>Protein cysteine thiols are post-translationally modified under oxidative stress conditions. Illuminated chloroplasts are one of the important sources of hydrogen peroxide (H O ) and are highly sensitive to environmental stimuli, yet a comprehensive view of the oxidation-sensitive chloroplast proteome is still missing. By targeting the sulfenic acid YAP1C-trapping technology to the plastids of light-grown Arabidopsis cells, we identified 132 putatively sulfenylated plastid proteins upon H O pulse treatment. Almost half of the sulfenylated proteins are enzymes of the amino acid metabolism. Using metabolomics, we observed a reversible decrease in the levels of the amino acids Ala, Asn, Cys, Gln, Glu, His, Ile, Leu, , , Ser, Thr and  after H O treatment, which is in line with an anticipated decrease in the levels of the  and tricarboxylic acid metabolites. Through the identification of an organelle-tailored proteome, we demonstrated that the subcellular targeting of the YAP1C probe enables us to study in vivo cysteine sulfenylation at the organellar level. All in all, the identification of these oxidation events in plastids revealed that several enzymes of the amino acid metabolism rapidly undergo cysteine oxidation upon oxidative stress.© 2018 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p></html>
