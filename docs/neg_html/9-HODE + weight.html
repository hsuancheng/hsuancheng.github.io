Although secondary products generated from peroxidized PUFAs have been relatively well studied, the role of primary lipid hydroperoxides in mediating early intracellular oxidative events is not well understood.Live cell imaging was used to monitor changes in glutathione (GSH) oxidation in HAEC expressing the fluorogenic sensor roGFP during exposure to 9-hydroperoxy-10E,12Z-octadecadienoic acid (9-HpODE), a biologically important long chain lipid hydroperoxide, and its secondary product 9-hydroxy-10E,12Z-octadecadienoic acid (). The role of hydrogen peroxide (HO) was examined by direct measurement and through catalase interventions. shRNA-mediated knockdown of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) was utilized to determine its involvement in the relay through which 9-HpODE initiates the oxidation of GSH.Exposure to 9-HpODE caused a dose-dependent increase in GSH oxidation in HAEC that was independent of intracellular or extracellular HO production and was exacerbated by NADPH depletion. GPx4 was involved in the initiation of GSH oxidation in HAEC by 9-HpODE, but not that induced by exposure to HO or the low molecular  alkyl tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBH).Long chain lipid hydroperoxides can directly alter cytosolic E independent of secondary lipid oxidation products or HO production. NADPH has a protective role against 9-HpODE induced E changes. GPx4 is involved specifically in the reduction of long-chain lipid hydroperoxides, leading to GSH oxidation.These results reveal a previously unrecognized consequence of lipid peroxidation, which may provide insight into disease states involving lipid peroxidation in their pathogenesis.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Adequate glutathione peroxidase activity could be important for the maintenance of prostacyclin synthesis by blood vessels, since hydroperoxides can inhibit the formation of this substance. We have investigated the effects of dietary selenium deficiency on glutathione peroxidase activity and the synthesis of 6-oxoprostaglandin F1 alpha and monohydroxy and trihydroxy metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids by aorta. The latter products can be formed either by the actions of cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase or by  peroxidation. Aortic glutathione peroxidase activity was reduced by over 80% by feeding rats a selenium-deficient diet for 4 weeks, and to undetectable levels after 6 weeks. There were no appreciable differences in the levels of free and esterified oxygenated metabolites of linoleic acid or arachidonic acid between the control and treated groups after 4 weeks. However, after 6 weeks, there were modest, but statistically significant reductions in the formation of 6-oxoprostaglandin F1 alpha and monohydroxy products formed by cyclooxygenase. On the other hand, the amounts of esterified 18:2 metabolites appeared to be higher in aortae from animals on the selenium-deficient diet, although only the increase in esterified  was statistically significant. These results suggest that selenium deficiency can affect the formation of prostacyclin and other oxygenated metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids by aorta, possibly by increasing  peroxidation. However, the differences between control and selenium-deficient rats after 6 weeks were not very dramatic, in spite of the fact that glutathione peroxidase activity was undetectable. It would therefore appear that additional mechanisms are also involved in controlling the levels of  hydroperoxides in aorta.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18842110>Rapid sample preparation and simultaneous quantitation of prostaglandins and lipoxygenase derived fatty acid metabolites by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry from small sample volumes.</a></h2><p>Fatty acid metabolites play a key role in numerous physiological and pathological processes. A rapid liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry assay for the simultaneous determination of prostanoids, isoprostane and lipoxygenase (LOX) derived fatty acid metabolites in a small biological sample of only 20 microL was developed.Human plasma samples were applied to a filter spot, extracted without prior derivatization and analyzed within 13 min. Detection of metabolites was performed on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer in negative multiple-reaction monitoring detection mode. Application of this assay to various biological matrices was performed.The validated assay was linear over the concentration range of 5-500 nmol/L for prostanoids and isoprostane, 50-5000 nmol/L for LOX-derived metabolites and 400-40,000 nmol/L for fatty acids. Limits of quantitation were 0.4-233 nmol/L, depending on the metabolite. Plasma samples from diabetic patients and controls showed significant increases in (+/-) and 15(S)-HETE with p-values of 0.019 and 0.024, respectively.The small amount of 20 microL sample volume used in this assay and the demonstrated application to various sample types makes it an ideal routine analysis method for fatty acid metabolites. The resulting values for LOX-derived metabolites in diabetes mellitus type 2 samples support earlier findings about the role of lipid oxidation products in diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9825542>Strong increase of  in low density lipoprotein after a hemorrhagic shock.</a></h2><p> () is generated by  peroxidation (LPO) processes in comparison to other marker compounds in at least 10 fold amount. A 10-25 fold increase of this new marker compound in relation to age matched healthy individuals was observed in the low density lipoprotein (LDL) fraction of ten patients suffering from a hemorrhagic shock. The  values dropped to normal levels after recovery.

Because these effects are thought to be mediated through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors alpha and gamma (PPARalpha and PPARgamma), we have now examined the possibility that troglitazone may modulate the expression of PPARalpha and PPARgamma. Seven obese hyperinsulinemic subjects were administered 400 mg troglitazone daily for 4 weeks. Fasting blood samples were obtained before and during troglitazone therapy at 1, 2, and 4 weeks. Fasting insulin concentrations fell at week 1 and persisted at lower levels till 4 weeks. PPARgamma expression fell significantly at week 1 and fell further at weeks 2 and 4. In contrast, PPARalpha expression increased significantly at week 2 and further at week 4. 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid, products of linoleic acid peroxidation and agonists of PPARgamma, decreased during troglitazone therapy. We conclude that troglitazone, an agonist for both PPARalpha and PPARgamma, has significant but dramatically opposite effects on PPARalpha and PPARgamma. These effects may be relevant to its insulin sensitizing and anti-inflammatory effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9933972>Increased levels of  oxidation products in rheumatically destructed bones of patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis.</a></h2><p>The new indicator for  peroxidation (LPO) processes-- ()--was used to investigate, whether LPO processes are increased in destructed bone material of patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in comparison to surrounded non destructed bone material. The HODE content in destructed bones exceeded that of non destructed ones of the same patient for a factor of about 3.

We previously have shown that ethanol increases mammary epithelial density through increased branching after dietary exposure during puberty in CD2/F1 mice. To extend these studies to parous mice in a breast cancer model, we used a transgenic mouse model of human parity-associated breast cancer, the FVB-MMTV-Her2/Neu mouse, which overexpresses wildtype EGFR2, resulting in constitutive activation of growth signaling in the mammary epithelium. Here we describe the short-term effects of ethanol feeding on progression through involution. Mice were fed diets supplemented with 0%, 0.5%, 1%, or 2% ethanol for 4, 9, or 14 d starting on day 21 of lactation (that is, at the start of natural postlactational involution). Unlike peripubertal mice exposed to ethanol, postlactational dams showed no changes in body weight; liver, spleen, and kidney weights; and pathology. Ethanol exposure had no effect on mammary gland lobular density and adipocyte size throughout involution. Likewise, the infiltration of inflammatory cells and serum oxidized  species were unchanged by diet, suggesting that ethanol feeding had no effect on local inflammation (leukocyte infiltration) or systemic inflammation (oxidized lipids). In conclusion, ethanol exposure of parous dams had no effect on mammary gland structure or the regression of the lactating mammary gland to a resting state. The period of involution that follows natural lactation appears to be refractory to developmental effects of ethanol on mammary epithelium.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23595524>Nutrigenomics approach elucidates health-promoting effects of high vegetable intake in lean and obese men.</a></h2><p>We aimed to explore whether vegetable consumption according to guidelines has beneficial health effects determined with classical biomarkers and nutrigenomics technologies. Fifteen lean (age 36Â Â±Â 7Â years; BMI 23.4Â Â±Â 1.7Â kgÂ m(-2)) and 17 obese (age 40Â Â±Â 6Â years; BMI 30.3Â Â±Â 2.4Â kgÂ m(-2)) men consumed 50- or 200-g vegetables for 4Â weeks in a randomized, crossover trial. Afterward, all subjects underwent 4Â weeks of energy restriction (60Â % of normal energy intake). Despite the limited  loss of 1.7Â Â±Â 2.4Â kg for the lean and 2.1Â Â±Â 1.9Â kg for the obese due to energy restriction, beneficial health effects were found, including lower total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and HbA1c concentrations. The high vegetable intake resulted in increased levels of plasma amino acid metabolites, decreased levels of  and prostaglandin D3 and decreased levels of ASAT and ALP compared to low vegetable intake. Adipose tissue gene expression changes in response to vegetable intake were identified, and sets of selected genes were submitted to network analysis. The network of inflammation genes illustrated a central role for NFkB in (adipose tissue) modulation of inflammation by increased vegetable intake, in lean as well as obese subjects. In obese subjects, high vegetable intake also resulted in changes related to energy metabolism, adhesion and inflammation. By inclusion of sensitive omics technologies and comparing the changes induced by high vegetable intake with changes induced by energy restriction, it has been shown that part of vegetables' health benefits are mediated by changes in energy metabolism, inflammatory processes and oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11861298>Defects in leukocyte-mediated initiation of  peroxidation in plasma as studied in myeloperoxidase-deficient subjects: systematic identification of multiple endogenous diffusible substrates for myeloperoxidase in plasma.</a></h2><p>More than a decade ago it was demonstrated that neutrophil activation in plasma results in the time-dependent formation of  hydroperoxides through an unknown, ascorbate-sensitive pathway. It is now shown that the mechanism involves myeloperoxidase (MPO)-dependent use of multiple low-molecular-weight substrates in plasma, generating diffusible oxidant species. Addition of activated human neutrophils (from healthy subjects) to plasma (50%, vol/vol) resulted in the peroxidation of endogenous plasma lipids by catalase-, heme poison-, and ascorbate-sensitive pathways, as assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with on-line electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometric analysis of free and -bound 9-HETE and . In marked contrast, neutrophils isolated from multiple subjects with MPO deficiency failed to initiate peroxidation of plasma lipids, but they did so after supplementation with isolated human MPO. MPO-dependent use of a low-molecular-weight substrate(s) in plasma for initiating  peroxidation was illustrated by demonstrating that the filtrate of plasma (10-kd MWt cutoff) could supply components required for low-density lipoprotein  peroxidation in the presence of MPO and H(2)O(2). Subsequent HPLC fractionation of plasma filtrate (10-kd MWt cutoff) by sequential column chromatography identified nitrite, tyrosine, and thiocyanate as major endogenous substrates and 17 beta-estradiol as a novel minor endogenous substrate in plasma for MPO in promoting peroxidation of plasma lipids. These results strongly suggest that the MPO-H(2)O(2) system of human leukocytes serves as a physiological mechanism for initiating  peroxidation in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25201082>Effect of conjugated linoleic acid mixture supplemented daily after carcinogen application on linoleic and arachidonic acid metabolites in rat serum and induced tumours.</a></h2><p>Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is thought to exert anticarcinogenic, antiatherogenic, anti-inflammatory and weight loss effects. The impact on eicosanoid biosynthesis may be one of the mechanisms of its action. The aim of this study was to establish whether CLA mixture supplemented daily after administration of carcinogen (7, 12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, DMBA) influenced the concentration of linoleic and arachidonic acid metabolites: 13- or 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (13-, ) and 15-, 12- or 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (15-, 12- or 5-HETE) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in rat serum and DMBA-induced tumours. The correlations between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and HETE and HODE contents in serum were also investigated. Female Sprague-Dawley rats divided into three groups according to the diet (1% Bio-C.L.A., 2% Bio-C.L.A. and plant oil in the control group) were used in the study. On the 50th day of life some of the animals in every dietary group were administered DMBA to induce tumours. Since that day, the rats were fed one of the above-mentioned diets. After 15weeks the animals were sacrificed and blood and tumours were collected. HETE and HODE were extracted using a solid-phase extraction (SPE) method on C18 columns and analysed with LC-MS/MS. The results of our study showed that CLA daily supplementation after carcinogen administration influence LA and AA metabolite levels in serum and tumours. However, the ratios of eicosanoids having opposite effects (e.g. 12-HETE/15-HETE), not concentrations of particular compounds, appear to be better indicators of pathological processes.Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Metabolic complications in malaria are recognized contributors to severe and fatal malaria, but the impact of malaria infection on the production of small  derived signalling molecules is unknown. Knowledge of immunoregulatory patterns of these molecules in malaria is of great value for better understanding of the disease and improvement of treatment regimes, since the action of these classes of molecules is directly connected to the inflammatory response of the organism.Detection of oxylipins and endocannabinoids from plasma samples from forty children with uncomplicated and severe malaria as well as twenty controls was done after solid phase extraction followed by chromatography mass spectrometry analysis. The stable isotope dilution method was used for compound quantification. Data analysis was done with multivariate (principal component analysis (PCA), orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and univariate approaches (receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, t tests, correlation analysis).Forty different oxylipin and thirteen endocannabinoid metabolites were detected in the studied samples, with one oxylipin (thromboxane B2, TXB) in significantly lower levels and four endocannabinoids (OEA, PEA, DEA and EPEA) at significantly higher levels in infected individuals as compared to controls according to t test analysis with Bonferroni correction. Three oxylipins (13-HODE,  and 13-oxo-ODE) were higher in severe compared to uncomplicated malaria cases according to the results from multivariate analysis. Observed changes in oxylipin levels can be connected to activation of cytochrome P450 (CYP) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) metabolic pathways in malaria infected individuals compared to controls, and related to increased levels of all linoleic acid oxylipins in severe patients compared to uncomplicated ones. The endocannabinoids were extremely responsive to malaria infection with majority of this class of molecules found at higher levels in infected individuals compared to controls.It was possible to detect oxylipin and endocannabinoid molecules that can be potential biomarkers for differentiation between malaria infected individuals and controls and between different classes of malaria. Metabolic pathways that could be targeted towards an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of malaria were also pinpointed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26408952>Metabolites of arachidonic acid and linoleic acid in early stages of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease--A pilot study.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum of liver conditions related to  infiltration. The role of liver triacylglycerol accumulation in NAFLD is not fully understood.Twenty-four patients, 12 in the first and 12 in the second stage of NAFLD, were prospectively enrolled in this study. Biochemical parameters and eicosanoids (HETE and HODE) were compared between the first and the second stage of hepatic steatosis and the effect of a 6-month dietary intervention on these parameters was evaluated. Eicosanoid profiles were extracted from 0.5 ml of plasma using solid-phase extraction RP-18 SPE columns. The HPLC separations were performed on a 1260 liquid chromatograph.Patients with stage I NAFLD had a significantly higher level of HDL cholesterol and a lower level of 5-HETE. Patients with grade II steatosis had higher concentrations of . Following the six-month dietary intervention, hepatic steatosis resolved completely in all patients. This resulted in a significant decrease in the concentrations of all eicosanoids (LX4, 16-HETE, 13-HODE, , 15-HETE, 12-HETE, 5-oxoETE, 5-HETE) and key biochemical parameters (BMI, insulin, HOMA-IR, liver enzymes).A significant reduction in the analyzed eicosanoids and a parallel reduction in fatty liver confirmed the usefulness of HETE and HODE in the assessment of NAFLD.Copyright Â© 2015.

One major metabolic fate of 13-HODE is oxidation to the 2,4-dienone, 13-oxooctadecadienoic acid by an NAD(+)-dependent dehydrogenase (13-HODE dehydrogenase). The present work describes the partial purification and characterization of 13-HODE dehydrogenase from rat liver cytosol. The enzyme was purified using a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation, as well as hydroxylapatite, gel permeation, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Analysis of the most purified preparation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicates two subunits of approximately 55 kDa, suggesting the possibility of a heterodimeric enzyme. However, due to aggregation in the purified preparation, an accurate molecular mass for the native enzyme has not yet been obtained. Using 13-HODE as a substrate, the purified enzyme has a Km of 6.3 microM and a Vmax of 5.7 nmol/min/mg. More importantly, the enzyme has a narrow substrate specificity with 13-HODE being the preferred substrate. From a series of 17 potential substrates, only  (53% the activity of 13-HODE) and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (64% the activity of 13-HODE) showed significant activity as substrates. A number of other unsaturated hydroxy fatty acids, including several eicosanoids, are not substrates. The narrow substrate specificity displayed by the enzyme suggests that it could play a key role in modulating the effects of oxidized derivatives of linoleic acid.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9409317>Prostaglandin F2-like compounds, F2-isoprostanes, are present in increased amounts in human atherosclerotic lesions.</a></h2><p>Oxidative modification of LDL is believed to play a major role in atherogenesis. As major  peroxidation products oxygenated linoleic acid derivatives and oxysterols have been described in human atherosclerotic lesions. Here we report that human lesions contain isoprostanes as peroxidation products of arachidonic acid at a level of 27.1 +/- 21.2 pg/mg wet weight (n = 10), which corresponds to 75.9 +/- 59.3 pg/mg dry weight, n contrast, human umbilical veins (n = 10), which were used as nonatherosclerotic control vessels, contain much smaller amounts of isoprostanes (1.4 +/- 0.7 pg/mg wet weight, which corresponds to 11.7 +/- 6.2 pg/mg dry weight), and there are significant differences between the two types of vessels. As major products of linoleic acid oxidation, racemic hydroxy linoleate isomers were detected in the lesional ester lipids. In human lesions, the hydroxy linoleic acid/linoleic acid ratio was about 0.5%, a result indicating that 5 out of 1000 linoleate residues are present as hydroxylated derivatives. In umbilical veins, no hydroxy linoleic acid could be detected. These data show that human atherosclerotic lesions contain increased amounts of hydroxy linoleic acid isomers and isoprostanes when compared with nonatherosclerotic vessel wall and suggest a link between local  peroxidation and progression of atherosclerosis. For evaluation of the degree of  peroxidation, the determination of the hydroxy linoleic acid/linoleic acid ratio appears to be more suitable than the isoprostane content.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12172844>Metabolic profiling of oxylipins in germinating cucumber seedlings--lipoxygenase-dependent degradation of triacylglycerols and biosynthesis of volatile aldehydes.</a></h2><p>A particular isoform of lipoxygenase (LOX) localized on  bodies was shown by earlier investigations to play a role in initiating the mobilization of triacylglycerols during seed germination. Here, further physiological functions of LOXs within whole cotyledons of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) were analyzed by measuring the endogenous amounts of LOX-derived products. The -body LOX-derived esterified (13 S)-hydroperoxy linoleic acid was the dominant metabolite of the LOX pathway in this tissue. It accumulated to about 14 micromol/g fresh weight, which represented about 6% of the total amount of linoleic acid in cotyledons. This LOX product was not only reduced to its hydroxy derivative, leading to degradation by beta-oxidation, but alternatively it was metabolized by fatty acid hydroperoxide lyase leading to formation of hexanal as well. Furthermore, the activities of LOX forms metabolizing linolenic acid were detected by measuring the accumulation of volatile aldehydes and the allene oxide synthase-derived metabolite jasmonic acid. The first evidence is presented for an involvement of a -body LOX form in the production of volatile aldehydes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11232024>The suppressive effect of dietary restriction and weight loss in the obese on the generation of reactive oxygen species by leukocytes,  peroxidation, and protein carbonylation.</a></h2><p>Increased reactive oxygen species generation by the leukocytes of the obese may be responsible for increased oxidative injury to lipids and proteins and, hence, atherosclerosis. We have investigated whether reactive oxygen species generation by leukocytes and other indexes of oxidative damage in the body fall with short-term dietary restriction and weight loss. Nine nondiabetic obese subjects (body mass index, 32.5-64.4 kg/m(2)), not taking any antioxidants, were put on a 1000-Cal diet. Fasting blood samples were taken at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks and at 12 weeks after the cessation of dietary restriction. Blood samples were also obtained at 1 and 2 h after administration of 75 g oral glucose at 0 and 4 weeks. Mononuclear cells (MNC) and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) were isolated, and reactive oxygen species generation was measured. Plasma concentrations of thiobarbituric acid-reactive species (TBARS), 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE), 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (), carbonylated proteins, o-tyrosine, and m-tyrosine as indexes of oxidative damage to lipids, proteins and amino acids, respectively, were measured. Antioxidant vitamins were measured as indexes of antioxidant reserves. Plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentrations were also measured. Mean weight loss was 2.4 +/- 0.6 kg at week 1, 2.5 +/- 1.7 kg at week 2, 3.9 +/- 0.8 kg at week 3, and 4.5 +/- 2.8 kg at week 4 (P < 0.05). Reactive oxygen species generation by PMN fell from 236.4 +/- 95.8 to 150.9 +/- 69.0, 125.9 +/- 24.3, 96.0 +/- 39.9, and 103.1 +/- 35.7 mV at weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively (P < 0.001). It increased 3 months after the cessation of dietary restriction to 270.0 +/- 274.3 mV. Reactive oxygen species generation by MNC fell from 187.8 +/- 75.0 to 101.7 +/- 64.5, 86.9 +/- 42.8, 63.8 +/- 14.3, and 75.1 +/- 32.2 mV and increased thereafter to 302.0 +/- 175.5 mV at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 16 weeks, respectively (P < 0.005). Reactive oxygen species generation by PMN and MNC increased in response to glucose; the relative increase was greater at 4 weeks than that at week 0 due to a fall in the basal levels of reactive oxygen species generation. Consistent with the fall in reactive oxygen species generation, there was a reduction in plasma TBARS from 1.68 +/- 0.17 micromol/L at week 0 to 1.47 micromol/L at 4 weeks (P < 0.05). The 13-HODE to linoleic acid ratio fell from a baseline of 100% to 56.4 +/- 36.1% at 4 weeks (P < 0.05), and the  to linoleic acid ratio fell from a baseline of 100% to 60.5 +/- 37.7% at 4 weeks (P < 0.05). Carbonylated proteins fell from 1.39 +/- 0.27 microgram/mg protein at week 0 to 1.17 +/- 0.12 microgram/mg protein at week 4 (P < 0.05); o-tyrosine fell from 0.42 +/- 0.03 mmol/mol phenylalanine at week 0 to 0.36 +/- 0.02 mmol/mol phenylalanine at 4 weeks (P < 0.005), and m-tyrosine fell from 0.45 +/- 0.04 mmol/mol phenylalanine at week 0 to 0.40 +/- 0.03 mmol/mol phenylalanine at 4 weeks (P < 0.05). The basal concentrations of TBARS, , 13-HODE, carbonylated proteins, o-tyrosine, and m-tyrosine in the obese were significantly greater than those in normal subjects. On the other hand, tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentrations did not change during this 4-week period, nor was there any change in antioxidant vitamins. This is the first demonstration of 1) an increase in reactive oxygen species-induced damage in lipids, proteins, and amino acids in the obese compared with normal subjects; and 2) a decrease in reactive oxygen species generation by leukocytes and oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and amino acids after dietary restriction and weight loss in the obese over a short period.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26186333>Profiling the Oxylipin and Endocannabinoid Metabolome by UPLC-ESI-MS/MS in Human Plasma to Monitor Postprandial Inflammation.</a></h2><p>Bioactive lipids, including oxylipins, endocannabinoids, and related compounds may function as specific biochemical markers of certain aspects of inflammation. However, the postprandial responsiveness of these compounds is largely unknown; therefore, changes in the circulating oxylipin and endocannabinoid metabolome in response to a challenge meal were investigated at six occasions in a subject who freely modified her usual diet. The dietary change, and especially the challenge meal itself, represented a modification of precursor fatty acid status, with expectedly subtle effects on bioactive  levels. To detect even the slightest alteration, highly sensitive ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to electrospray ionization (ESI) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) methods for bioactive  profiling was employed. A previously validated UPLC-ESI-MS/MS method for profiling the endocannabinoid metabolome was used, while validation of an UPLC-ESI-MS/MS method for oxylipin analysis was performed with acceptable outcomes for a majority of the parameters according to the US Food and Drug Administration guidelines for linearity (0.9938 < R2 < 0.9996), limit of detection (0.0005-2.1 pg on column), limit of quantification (0.0005-4.2 pg on column), inter- and intraday accuracy (85-115%) and precision (< 5%), recovery (40-109%) and stability (40-105%). Forty-seven of fifty-two bioactive lipids were detected in plasma samples at fasting and in the postprandial state (0.5, 1, and 3 hours after the meal). Multivariate analysis showed a significant shift of bioactive  profiles in the postprandial state due to inclusion of dairy products in the diet, which was in line with univariate analysis revealing seven compounds (NAGly, , 13-oxo-ODE, 9(10)-EpOME, 12(13)-EpOME, 20-HETE, and 11,12-DHET) that were significantly different between background diets in the postprandial state (but not at fasting). The only change in baseline levels at fasting was displayed by TXB2. Furthermore, postprandial responsiveness was detected for seven compounds (POEA, SEA, 9(10)-DiHOME, 12(13)-DiHOME, 13-oxo-ODE, , and 13-HODE). Hence, the data confirm that the UPLC-ESI-MS/MS method performance was sufficient to detect i) a shift, in the current case most notably in the postprandial bioactive  metabolome, caused by changes in diet and ii) responsiveness to a challenge meal for a subset of the oxylipin and endocannabinoid metabolome. To summarize, we have shown proof-of-concept of our UPLC-ESI-MS/MS bioactive  protocols for the purpose of monitoring subtle shifts, and thereby useful to address -mediated postprandial inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22505276>Pentoxifylline decreases oxidized  products in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: new evidence on the potential therapeutic mechanism.</a></h2><p>Pentoxifylline (PTX) improved the histological features of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in a recent randomized placebo-controlled trial. However, the underlying mechanism responsible for the beneficial effects of PTX in NASH remains unidentified. A key role of  oxidation in the pathogenesis and progression of NASH has been established. PTX is known to decrease free-radical-mediated oxidative stress and inhibit  oxidation. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of PTX on levels of  oxidation products in patients with NASH. Levels of multiple structurally specific oxidized fatty acids including hydroxy-octadecadienoic acids (HODEs), oxo-octadecadienoic acids (oxoODEs), and hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) were quantified by mass spectrometry in plasma obtained at baseline and at study completion in patients who completed 1 year of therapy with PTX or placebo in a randomized controlled trial. Therapy with PTX resulted in significant decreases in  and 13-oxoODE, oxidized  products of linoleic acid (LA) linked to histological severity in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Similarly, PTX therapy was associated with significant decreases in 8-HETE, 9-HETE, and 11-HETE compared to placebo. Statistically significant correlations were demonstrated between the decrease in HODEs and oxoODEs and improved histological scores of fibrosis and between the decrease in HETEs and improved lobular inflammation.Therapy with PTX compared to placebo was associated with a significant reduction of oxidized fatty acids. This novel evidence supports that the beneficial effects of PTX in patients with NASH are likely partly mediated through decreasing  oxidation, largely free-radical-mediated  oxidation. Additionally, this is the first report on the link between decreased oxidized  products and improved histological disease in the setting of a therapeutic trial in NASH.Copyright Â© 2012 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10342328>Oxysterols in cap and core of human advanced atherosclerotic lesions.</a></h2><p>Different parts of the advanced atherosclerotic lesion have characteristic differences in  content, but the distribution of  oxidation products has not been reported. This study provides novel data on oxysterol and hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids quantification in core versus cap. It compares the  composition of core and cap to assess the topographical distribution of evidence of  oxidation.Lipids and oxidised lipids were analysed by gas chromatography (GC) and GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in samples of human atheromatous  core and fibrous cap of individual advanced atherosclerotic plaques (Stary, Type V) in necropsy samples.The total  was of course massively greater in the core than in the cap. The oxidation products, cholest-5-en-3beta,26-diol (26-OH-CHOL) and cholest-5-en-3beta,7beta-diol (7beta-OH-CHOL) were detected in all the samples. 26-OH-CHOL was more abundant in the core than in the cap when related both to wet weight and to cholesterol. 7Beta-OH-CHOL levels were significantly higher in the core than in the cap when related to wet weight but not when related to cholesterol. Because the processing included a sodium borohydride reduction step, the 7beta-OH-CHOL detected could partly originate from 7-ketocholesterol or 7-hydroperoxycholesterol. Several isomeric hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids were detected in both core and cap, more in the cap when related to cholesterol content. Most of the components of the cap showed a high degree of cross-correlation on linear regression analysis, but cross-correlations were weaker for the core. The core samples contained a larger proportion of linoleate relative to oleate than the fibrous cap.The findings suggest that the different  and oxidised  contents of cap and core may be due to variations in oxidative activity in different parts of the lesion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11443197>Nuclear factor-kappaB suppressive and inhibitor-kappaB stimulatory effects of troglitazone in obese patients with type 2 diabetes: evidence of an antiinflammatory action?</a></h2><p>It has been shown recently that troglitazone exerts an anti-inflammatory effect, in vitro, and in experimental animals. To test these properties in humans, we investigated the effect of troglitazone on the proinflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB and its inhibitory protein IkappaB in mononuclear cells (MNC) and plasma soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and C-reactive protein. We also examined the effect of troglitazone on reactive oxygen species generation, p47(phox) subunit expression, 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (), 13-HODE, o-tyrosine, and m-tyrosine in obese patients with type 2 diabetes. Seven obese patients with type 2 diabetes were treated with troglitazone (400 mg/day) for 4 weeks. Blood samples were obtained at weekly intervals. Nuclear factor-kappaB binding activity in MNC nuclear extracts was significantly inhibited after troglitazone treatment at week 1 and continued to be inhibited up to week 4. On the other hand, IkappaB protein levels increased significantly after troglitazone treatment at week 1, and this increase persisted throughout the study. Plasma monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 concentrations did not decrease significantly after troglitazone treatment, although there was a trend toward inhibition. Reactive oxygen species generation by polymorphonuclear cells and MNC, p47(phox) subunit protein quantities, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and C-reactive protein levels decreased significantly after troglitazone intake. 13-HODE/linoleic acid and /linoleic acid ratios also decreased after troglitazone intake. However, o-tyrosine/phenylalanine and m-tyrosine/phenylalanine ratios did not change significantly. These data show that troglitazone has profound antiinflammatory effects in addition to antioxidant effects in obese type 2 diabetics; these effects may be relevant to the recently described beneficial antiatherosclerotic effects of troglitazone at the vascular level.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10563421>Rapid reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic determination of the regiospecificity of lipoxygenase products on linoleic acid.</a></h2><p>A new reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography method for the separation of regioisomeric products from lipoxygenase acting on linoleic acid was studied. The addition of salts to the mobile phase improved the retention and separation behaviour of 13-hydroperoxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid and 9-hydroperoxy-10,12-octadecadienoic acid with respect to the results obtained with other mobile phases reported in the literature. The effect of the pH and ionic strength of the buffer on the retention times, capacity factor and separation factor of these lipoxygenase products were also studied. The pH optimum coincided with the pKa of linoleic acid (close to 7 depending on the fatty acid concentration). Phosphate concentrations close to 100 mM considerably reduced the retention times and led to better separation of the mixture of both products. Finally, this method was applied to the identification and separation of two linoleic acid hydroxides (13-hydroxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid and ) obtained by the reduction of their corresponding hydroperoxides.</p></html>
