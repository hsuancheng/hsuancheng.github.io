In the absence of calcium, the reaction was remarkably reduced. Statistically significant increase of 13-KODE was observed 1 min after the reaction was started by adding calcium. Calcium chloride at concentrations as low as 30 microM caused statistically significant increase of 13-KODE production in the presence of 1 microM cytochrome c, and cytochrome c at concentrations as low as 10 nM caused statistically significant increase of 13-KODE production in the presence of 2 mM calcium. The addition of bleomycin enhanced the reaction, and the addition of adriamycin attenuated the reaction. The same oxidized linoleic acid products were found in the submitochondrial particles which were hydrolyzed by phospholipase-A2 in the presence of calcium. Lipoxygenase activity potentiated by calcium may be involved in the lipid peroxidation in the submitochondrial particles hydrolyzed by phospholipase-A2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17848084>Lipoxygenase distribution in coffee (Coffea arabica L.) berries.</a></h2><p>In this paper lipoxygenase (LOX) presence was investigated in coffee berries to determine its involvement in lipid degradative metabolism of plants grown in organic and conventional cultivations. An immunochemical analysis has evidenced a ca. 80 kDa protein, cross-reacting with an anti-LOX antibody, only in the pulp fraction of berries obtained from plants of both cultivations. LOX activity in this fraction could be monitored either as conjugated diene formation or reaction products (determined by HPLC) and was mainly associated with a heavy membrane fraction (HMF, enriched in tonoplast, endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane, and ) and a light membrane fraction (LMF, enriched in plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum, with low levels of tonoplast and ). The LOX activity of LMF from berries of both cultivations showed an optimum at pH 8.0. The HMF exhibited a different activity peak in samples from conventional (pH 8.0) and organic (pH 5.5) cultures, suggesting the presence of different isoenzymes. These findings were also confirmed by variation of the ratio of 9- and 13-hydroperoxides in organic (1:1) and conventional cultivations (1:10), indicating that the organic one was subjected to an oxidative stress in the coffee pulp fraction leading to the expression of an acidic LOX. Such de novo synthesized LOX activity could be responsible for the production of secondary metabolites, which may interfere with the organoleptic profile of coffee.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8304966>Lipid hydroperoxide induced mitochondrial dysfunction following acute ethanol intoxication in rats. The critical role for mitochondrial reduced glutathione.</a></h2><p>It has been found that acute ethanol (EtOH) intoxication of rats caused depletion of mitochondrial reduced glutathione (GSH) of approximately 40%. A GSH reduction of similar extent was also observed after the administration to rats of buthionine sulphoximine (BSO), a specific inhibitor of GSH synthesis. Combined treatment with BSO plus EtOH further decreased mitochondrial GSH up to 70% in comparison to control. Normal functional efficiency was encountered in BSO-treated , as evaluated by membrane potential measurements during a complete cycle of phosphorylation. In contrast a partial loss of coupled functions occurred in  from EtOH- and BSO plus EtOH-treated rats. The presence in the incubation system of either GSH methyl monoester (GSH-EE), which normalizes GSH levels, or of EGTA, which chelates the available Ca2+, partially restores the mitochondrial phosphorylative efficiency. Following EtOH and BSO plus EtOH intoxication, the presence of fatty-acid-conjugated diene hydroperoxides, such as octadecadienoic acid hydroperoxide (HPODE), was detected in the mitochondrial membrane. Exogenous HPODE, when added to BSO-treated , induced, in a concentration-dependent system, membrane potential derangement. The presence of either GSH-EE or EGTA fully prevented a drop in membrane potential. The results obtained suggest that fatty acid hydroperoxides, endogenously formed during EtOH metabolism, brought about non-specific permeability changes in the mitochondrial inner membrane whose extent was strictly dependent on the level of mitochondrial GSH.</p></html>
