This study aimed to evaluate the roles of p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 in the TPN-induced loss of intestinal   and liver disease.A rodent model of TPN was used to analyze the roles of SB203580 in TPN-associated complications.Intestinal   was evaluated by transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and paracellular permeability in Caco-2 cells. The  (PA) was used to induce hepatic lipoapoptosis in vitro. The lipoapoptosis was detected using Caspase-3/7 and lipid staining.In the present study, we showed that SB203580 treatment significantly suppressed TPN-mediated intestinal permeability in rats. SB203580 treatment significantly inhibited IL-1β-induced an increase in tight junction permeability of Caco-2 cells via repressing the p38/ATF-2 signaling. Unexpectedly, SB203580 treatment enhanced hepatic lipoapoptosis in the model of TPN.  (PA)-induced hepatic lipoapoptosis in human liver cells was significantly augmented by the SB203580 treatment.We demonstrate that the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203508 ameliorates intestinal   but promotes hepatic lipoapoptosis in model of TPN.© 2017 The Author(s)Published by S.

A translational study.</a></h2><p>Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) is a chronic bladder condition characterized by frequent urination, bladder inflammation and pain. It is a particular challenging disease and a clear unmet medical need in terms of identifying new therapeutic strategies. The aim of study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of intravesical Vessilen (a new formulation of 2% adelmidrol (the diethanolamide derivative of azelaic ) + 0.1% sodium hyaluronate) administration in rodent models of IC/BPS and in IC/BPS patients or other bladder disorders. Acute and chronic animal models of cystitis were induced by a single or repetitive intraperitoneal injections of cyclophosphamide (CYP); patients with IC/BPS or with bladder pain syndrome associated with symptoms of the lower urinary tract treated once weekly by bladder instillation of Vessilen for 8 weeks. CYP instillation caused macroscopic and histological bladder alterations, inflammatory infiltrates, increased mast cell numbers, bladder pain, increased expression of nitrotyrosine, decreased expression of endothelial  zonula occludens-1. Intravesical Vessilen® treatment was able to ameliorate CYP induced bladder inflammation and pain by inhibiting nuclear factor-κB pathway and inflammatory mediator levels as well as reduced mechanical allodynia and nerve growth factor levels. A significant improvement in quality of life and symptom intensity were evident in patients with IC/BPS or other bladder disorders treated with Vessilen. Vessilen could be a new therapeutic approach for human cystitis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

JAM-C has been implicated in leukocyte transendothelial migration, angiogenesis, cell adhesion, cell polarity, spermatogenesis, and metastasis. Here, we show that JAM-C undergoes -palmitoylation on two juxtamembrane cysteine residues, Cys-264 and Cys-265. We have identified DHHC7 as a JAM-C palmitoylating enzyme by screening all known palmitoyltransferases (DHHCs). Ectopic expression of DHHC7, but not a DHHC7 catalytic mutant, enhances JAM-C -palmitoylation. Moreover, DHHC7 knockdown decreases the -palmitoylation level of JAM-C. Palmitoylation of JAM-C promotes its localization to tight junctions and inhibits transwell migration of A549 lung cancer cells. These results suggest that -palmitoylation of JAM-C can be potentially targeted to control cancer metastasis.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30623851>Alterations to the microbiota-colon-brain axis in high-fat-diet-induced obese mice compared to diet-resistant mice.</a></h2><p>Obesity is underpinned by both genetic and environmental factors, including a high-saturated-fat diet. Some mice develop diet-induced obesity (DIO), but others remain diet resistant (DR) despite intake of the same high-saturated-fat diet, a phenomenon that mimics characteristics of the human obese phenotype. Microbiota-colon-brain axis regulation is important for energy metabolism and cognition. Using DIO and DR mouse models, this study aimed to examine gut microbiota, colonic inflammation and cognitive function to elucidate the role of microbiota-gut-brain regulation in DIO. C57Bl6/J mice fed a chronic saturated- diet for 22 weeks showed significant body weight gain differences, with the top one third gaining 48% heavier body weight than the lower one third. There was significant reduction in gut microbiota richness and diversity in DIO mice but not in DR mice. At the phylum level, DIO mice had increased abundance of Firmicutes and Antinobacteria, and decreased abundance of Bacterioides and Proteobacteria in gut microbiota. DIO mice exhibited reduced  proteins, increased plasma endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and increased inflammation in the colon and liver. Recognition memory and spatial memory were impaired in DIO mice, associated with decreased Bacteroidetes. Further examination showed that hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor was significantly decreased in DIO mice (vs. DR). Conversely, DR mice showed no changes in the above parameters measured. Therefore, gut microbiota, colon inflammation and circulating LPS may play a major role in the development of the obese phenotype and cognitive decline associated with a chronic high-saturated- diet.Copyright © 2018.

AgNP exposure can increase amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition in neuronal cells to potentially induce Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. However, the mechanism through which AgNPs alter BBB permeability in endothelial cells and subsequently lead to AD progression remains unclear. This study investigated whether AgNPs disrupt the tight junction proteins of brain endothelial cells, and alter the proteomic metabolism of neuronal cells underlying AD progression in a triple cell coculture model constructed using mouse brain endothelial (bEnd.3) cells, mouse brain astrocytes (ALT), and mouse neuroblastoma neuro-2a (N2a) cells. The results showed that AgNPs accumulated in ALT and N2a cells because of the disruption of tight junction proteins, claudin-5 and ZO-1, in bEnd.3 cells. The proteomic profiling of N2a cells after AgNP exposure identified 298 differentially expressed proteins related to fatty  metabolism. Particularly, AgNP-induced  production was observed in N2a cells, which might promote Aβ generation. Moreover, AgNP exposure increased the protein expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Aβ generation-related secretases, PSEN1, PSEN2, and β-site APP cleaving enzyme for APP cleavage in ALT and N2a cells, stimulated Aβ40 and Aβ42 secretion in the culture medium, and attenuated the gene expression of Aβ clearance-related receptors, P-gp and LRP-1, in bEnd.3 cells. Increased Aβ might further aggregate on the neuronal cell surface to enhance the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, MCP-1 and IL-6, thus inducing apoptosis in N2a cells. This study suggested that AgNP exposure might cause Aβ deposition and inflammation for subsequent neuronal cell apoptosis to potentially induce AD progression.© The Author 2017.

Transduction of bovine foetal hepatocytes with SV40 large T-antigen was performed using the vector pRetro-E2 SV40. Phase contrast microscopy was carried out to evaluate morphology. Immunofluorescence staining was conducted to study expression of keratins, tight junction proteins zona occludens-1 and claudin-1, glucose transporter-2 and P-glycoprotein as well as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. Urea and triglyceride production was quantified photometrically. Histochemical staining of glycogen by Periodic -Schiff stain and of lipids with Oil red O was performed after 24 h incubation with 20 mM glucose and 85 μM , respectively. Gene expression analysis of hepatocyte-typical genes was conducted by reverse transcription PCR. We obtained a SV40LTAg-transduced extended passage cell line, referred to as BFH12. Polygonal growth, keratins, tight junction proteins zona occludens-1 and claudin-1 and glucose transporter-2 as well as P-glycoprotein and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase were attested positively. Urea production calculated as cell-specific rate was 14.2 ± 2.0 fmol/h (early passage) and 17.6 ± 3.7 fmol/h (late passage). Cell-specific triglyceride production was 1.6 ± 0.5 fmol/h (early passage) and 2.1 ± 0.3 fmol/h (late passage). Additionally, cells were positive for glycogen and lipid storage and showed a gene expression pattern resembling foetal hepatocytes. With the properties described here, the novel cell line BFH12 is a hepatocyte-derived cell line which can be used as an in vitro whole cell model.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31411504>High-fat diet promotes experimental colitis by inducing oxidative stress in the colon.</a></h2><p>Diets high in animal fats are associated with increased risks of inflammatory bowel disease, but the mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of high-fat diet (HFD) on the development of experimental colitis in mice. Relative to mice fed low-fat diet (LFD), HFD feeding for 4 wk increased the levels of triglyceride, cholesterol, and free fatty acids in the plasma as well as within the colonic mucosa. In an experimental colitis model induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS), mice on 4-wk HFD exhibited more severe colonic inflammation and developed more severe colitis compared with the LFD counterparts. HFD feeding resulted in higher production of mucosal pro-inflammatory cytokines, greater activation of the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK)  regulatory pathway, and greater increases in mucosal barrier permeability in mice following TNBS induction. HFD feeding also induced gp91, an NADPH oxidase subunit, and promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in both colonic epithelial cells and lamina propria cells. In HCT116 cell culture,  or  and TNF-α combination markedly increased ROS production and induced the MLCK pathway, and these effects were markedly diminished in the presence of a ROS scavenger. Taken together, these data suggest that HFD promotes colitis by aggravating mucosal oxidative stress, which rapidly drives mucosal inflammation and increases intestinal mucosal barrier permeability. This study demonstrates high-fat diet feeding promotes colitis in a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic -induced experimental colitis model in mice. The underlying mechanism is that high-fat diet induces oxidative stress in the colonic mucosa, which increases colonic epithelial barrier permeability and drives colonic mucosal inflammation. These observations provide molecular evidence that diets high in saturated fats are detrimental to patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634462>Time-Dependent alteration to the  structure of distal intestinal epithelia in type 2 prediabetic mice.</a></h2><p>High-fat diet (HFD) intake has been associated with changes in intestinal microbiota composition, increased intestinal permeability, and onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of this work was twofold: 1) to investigate the structural and functional alterations of the  (TJ)-mediated intestinal epithelial barrier of ileum and colon, that concentrate most of the microbiota, after exposure to a HFD for 15, 30 and 60 days, and 2) to assess the effect of in vitro exposure to free fatty acids (FFAs), one of the components of HFD, on paracellular barrier of colon-derived Caco-2 cells.HFD exposure induced progressive metabolic changes in male mice that culminated in prediabetes after 60d. Morphological analysis of ileum and colon mucosa showed no signs of epithelial rupture or local inflammation but changes in the junctional content/distribution and/or cellular content of TJ-associated proteins (claudins-1, -2, -3, and occludin) in intestinal epithelia were seen mainly after a prediabetes state has been established. This impairment in TJ structure was not associated with significant changes in intestinal permeability to FITC-dextran. Exposure of Caco-2 monolayers to  or linoleic acids seems to induce a reinforcement of TJ structure while treatment with oleic  had a more diverse effect on TJ protein distribution.TJ structure in distal intestinal epithelia can be specifically impaired by HFD intake at early stage of T2DM, but not by FFAs in vitro. Since the TJ change in ileum/colon was marginal, probably it does not contribute to the disease onset.Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier Inc.</p></html>
