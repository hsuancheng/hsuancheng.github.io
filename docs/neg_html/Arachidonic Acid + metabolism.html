This study elucidated the mechanisms contributing to tumor development induced by the HBV X (HBx) gene of predominantly Asian genotype B HBV and its common HBx variants. To compare the potential tumorigenic effects of K130M/V131I (Mut) and wild-type (WT) HBx on HCC, the  () transposon system was used to deliver HBx Mut and WT into the livers of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase ()-deficient mice and in the context of  () deficiency. From our results, HBx Mut had a stronger tumorigenic effect than its WT variant. Also, inflammation, necrosis, and fibrosis were evident in HBx experimental animals. Reduction of forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) with increased phosphorylation of upstream serine/threonine kinase (AKT) was detected under HBx Mut overexpression. Thus, it is proposed that HBx Mut enhances disease progression by reducing FOXO1 via phosphorylation of AKT. At the metabolomic level, HBx altered the expression of genes that participated in  (AA) , as a result of inflammation via accumulation of proinflammatory factors such as prostaglandins and leukotriene in liver. Taken together, the increased rate of HCC observed in chronic hepatitis B patients with K130M/V131I-mutated X protein, may be due to changes in AA  and AKT/FOXO1 signaling. IMPLICATIONS: Our findings suggested that HBx-K130M/V131I-mutant variant promoted HCC progression by activating AKT/FOXO1 pathway and inducing stronger inflammation in liver via AA .©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31191470>Dynamic Alterations in Yak Rumen Bacteria Community and Metabolome Characteristics in Response to Feed Type.</a></h2><p>Current knowledge about the relationships between ruminal bacterial communities and metabolite profiles in the yak rumen is limited. This is due to differences in the nutritional and  features between yak and other ordinary cattle combined with difficulties associated with farm-based research and a lack of technical guidance. A comprehensive analysis of the composition and alterations in ruminal metabolites is required to advance the development of modern yak husbandry. In the current study, we characterized the effect of feed type on the ruminal fluid microbiota and metabolites in yak using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).  and  were the predominant bacterial phyla in the yak rumen. At the genus level, the relative abundance of  and  was significantly ( < 0.01) higher in the forage group compared to that in the concentrate group, while the concentrate group harbored higher proportions of  and . Yak rumen metabolomics analysis combined with enrichment analysis revealed that feed type altered the concentrations of ruminal metabolites as well as the  pattern, and significantly ( < 0.01) affected the concentrations of ruminal metabolites involved in protein digestion and absorption (e.g., L-arginine, ornithine, L-threonine, L-proline and β-alanine), purine  (e.g., xanthine, hypoxanthine, deoxyadenosine and deoxyadenosine monophosphate) and fatty  biosynthesis (e.g., stearic , myristic  and ). Correlation analysis of the association of microorganisms with metabolite features provides us with a comprehensive understanding of the composition and function of microbial communities. Associations between utilization or production were widely identified between affected microbiota and certain metabolites, and these findings will contribute to the direction of future research in yak.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31058102>Advances in Cardiovascular Disease Lipid Research Can Provide Novel Insights Into Mycobacterial Pathogenesis.</a></h2><p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in industrialized nations and an emerging health problem in the developing world. Systemic inflammatory processes associated with alterations in lipid  are a major contributing factor that mediates the development of CVDs, especially atherosclerosis. Therefore, the  promoting alterations in lipid  and the interplay between varying cellular types, signaling agents, and effector molecules have been well-studied. Mycobacterial species are the causative agents of various infectious diseases in both humans and animals. Modulation of host lipid  by mycobacteria plays a prominent role in its survival strategy within the host as well as in disease pathogenesis. However, there are still several knowledge gaps in the mechanistic understanding of how mycobacteria can alter host lipid . Considering the in-depth research available in the area of cardiovascular research, this review presents an overview of the parallel areas of research in host lipid-mediated immunological changes that might be extrapolated and explored to understand the underlying basis of mycobacterial pathogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642261>[Metabolomic network analysis of umbilical cord blood of gestational diabetes mellitus patients via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry].</a></h2><p>The global increase in the prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus(GDM)in recent years has prompted the study of the effect of GDM on the  between mother and fetus.

Inflammation and abnormal redox status are believed to be key pathogenic mechanisms for AAA. In light of evidence correlating inflammation with aberrant fatty  profiles, this study compared erythrocyte fatty  content in 43 AAA patients (diameter 3.0-4.5 cm) and 52 healthy controls. In addition, the effect of omega-3 PUFA (n-3 PUFA) supplementation on erythrocyte fatty  content was examined in a cohort of 30 AAA patients as part of a 12 week randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial. Blood analyses identified associations between AAA and decreased linoleic  (LA), and AAA and increased Δ6-desaturase activity and biosynthesis of  (AA) from LA. Omega-3 PUFA supplementation (1.5 g DHA + 0.3 g EPA/day) decreased red blood cell distribution width (14.8 ± 0.4% to 13.8 ± 0.2%;  = 0.003) and levels of pro-inflammatory n-6 PUFAs (AA, 12.46 ± 0.23% to 10.14 ± 0.3%,  < 0.001; adrenic , 2.12 ± 0.13% to 1.23 ± 0.09%;  < 0.001). In addition, Δ-4 desaturase activity increased (DHA/docosapentaenoic  ratio, 1.85 ± 0.14 to 3.93 ± 0.17;  < 0.001) and elongase 2/5 activity decreased (adrenic /AA ratio, 0.17 ± 0.01 to 0.12 ± 0.01;  < 0.01) following supplementation.

In the present study, we investigated the roles of the intrinsic mevalonate cascade and Rho-dependent pathway in LCPUFA synthesis, especially focusing on fatty  desaturases (Fads) 2, using the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2. Cell number and the activity of caspase-3 and 7 (caspase-3/7) was measured using a commercial kit. Gene expression was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Protein expression was detected by Western blot analysis. Atorvastatin decreased cell viability and increased caspase-3/7 activity in a dose-dependent manner. At lower concentrations, atorvastatin stimulated both mRNA and protein expression of Fads2, and increased mRNA expression of FADS1 and ELVOL5. Both mevalonate and geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate (GGPP), but not cholesterol, fully reversed atorvastatin-induced upregulation of Fads2, and mevalonate-effected reversal was inhibited by treatment with the Rho-associated protein kinase inhibitor Y-27632. These data clearly demonstrated that in human HepG2 cells, statins affect the endogenous synthesis of LCPUFAs by regulation of not only Fads2, but also Fads1 and Elovl5, through the GGPP-dependent Rho kinase pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31260961>Phenolic, oxylipin and fatty  profiles of the Chilean hazelnut (Gevuina avellana): Antioxidant activity and inhibition of pro-inflammatory and  syndrome-associated enzymes.</a></h2><p>Roasted cotyledons of the Chilean hazelnut (Gevuina avellana) are appreciated as snacks. The aim of our work was to assess the fatty , oxylipin and phenolic composition using gas chromatography (GC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS), ultra- high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to MS and HPLC coupled to diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). Additionally, various antioxidant activities were assessed. The inhibition of α-glucosidase, α-amylase, lipase, cyclooxygenases-1 and -2 (COX-1/COX-2), and lipoxygenase was determined. The main fatty acids were oleic and 7-hexadecenoic acids. Eight phytoprostanes and three phytofurans were identified and quantified. Hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids were the main phenolic compounds. Oils showed antioxidant activity determined by EPR, and inhibition of COX-1/COX-2. The statistical analysis showed that the roasting does not affect the composition of the samples. The occurrence of oxylipins in this species is reported for the first time.

Elevated Hg exposure with the growing release of atmospheric pollutant Hg and rising accumulations of mono-methylmercury (highly neurotoxic) in seafood products have increased its toxic potential for humans. This review aims to highlight the potential relationship between Hg exposure and Alzheimer's disease (AD), based on the existing literature in the field. Recent reports have hypothesized that Hg exposure could increase the potential risk of developing AD. Also, AD is known as a complex neurological disorder with increased amounts of both extracellular neuritic plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, which may also be related to lifestyle and genetic variables. Research reports on AD and relationships between Hg and AD indicate that neurotransmitters such as serotonin, acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, and glutamate are dysregulated in patients with AD. Many researchers have suggested that AD patients should be evaluated for Hg exposure and toxicity. Some authors suggest further exploration of the Hg concentrations in AD patients. Dysfunctional signaling  in AD and Hg exposure appear to be interlinked with some driving factors such as , homocysteine, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) sulfate, hydrogen peroxide, glucosamine glycans, glutathione, acetyl-L carnitine, melatonin, and HDL. This evidence suggests the need for a better understanding of the relationship between AD and Hg exposure, and potential mechanisms underlying the effects of Hg exposure on regional brain functions. Also, further studies evaluating brain functions are needed to explore the long-term effects of subclinical and untreated Hg toxicity on the brain function of AD patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31284588>Effects of LC-PUFA Supplementation in Patients with Phenylketonuria: A Systematic Review of Controlled Trials.</a></h2><p>Evidence suggests a role of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), in which animal foods are especially rich, in optimal neural development. The LC-PUFAs docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and , found in high concentrations in the brain and retina, have potential beneficial effects on cognition, and motor and visual functions. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is the most common inborn error of amino  . The treatment of PKU consists of a phenylalanine-free diet, which limits the intake of natural proteins of high biological value. In this systematic review, we summarize the available evidence supporting a role for LC-PUFA supplementation as an effective means of increasing LC-PUFA levels and improving visual and neurocognitive functions in PKU patients. Data from controlled trials of children and adults (up to 47 years of age) were obtained by searching the MEDLINE and SCOPUS databases following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. For each selected study, the risk of bias was assessed applying the methodology of the Cochrane Collaboration. The findings indicate that DHA supplementation in PKU patients from 2 weeks to 47 years of age improves DHA status and decreases visual evoked potential P100 wave latency in PKU children from 1 to 11 years old.

This study aimed to investigate the hepatoprotective effect of LR on mice with CCl-induced acute liver injury through conventional assays and metabolomics analysis. This study consisted of male mice ( = 23) in four groups (i.e., control, model, positive control, and LR). The extract of whole plant of LR was used to treat mice in the LR group. Biochemical and histological assays (i.e., serum levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), and histological changes of liver tissue) were used to evaluate LR efficacy, and metabolomics analysis based on GC-MS and LC-MS was conducted to reveal metabolic changes. The conventional analysis and metabolomic profiles both suggested that LR treatment could protect mice against CCl-induced acute liver injury. The affected metabolic pathways included linoleic  metabolism, α-linolenic  metabolism,  metabolism, CoA biosynthesis, glycerophospholipid metabolism, the TCA cycle, and purine metabolism. This study identified eight metabolites, including phosphopantothenic , succinic , AMP, choline, glycerol 3-phosphate, linoleic , , and DHA, as potential biomarkers for evaluating hepatoprotective effect of LR.

The heart has  capability for energy production and homeostasis. This homeostatic machinery can also process xenobiotics. Cardiac  includes the expression of numerous organic anion transporters, organic cation transporters, organic carnitine (zwitterion) transporters, and ATP-binding cassette transporters. Expression and distribution of the transporters within the heart may vary, depending on the patient's age, disease, endocrine status, and various other factors. Several cytochrome P450 (P450) enzyme classes have been identified within the heart. The P450 hydroxylases and epoxygenases within the heart produce hydroxyeicosatetraneoic acids and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, metabolites of , which are critical in regulating homeostatic processes of the heart. The susceptibility of the cardiac P450 system to induction and inhibition from exogenous materials is an area of expanding knowledge, as are the  processes of glucuronidation and sulfation in the heart. The susceptibility of various transcription factors and signaling  of the heart to disruption by xenobiotics is not fully characterized but is an area with implications for disruption of normal postnatal development, as well as modulation of adult cardiac health.

Several reports have indicated the presence of specific fatty  alterations in CF patients, most notably decreased levels of plasmatic and tissue docosahexaenoic  (DHA), the precursor of specialized pro-resolving mediators. We hypothesized that DHA supplementation could restore the production of DHA-derived products and possibly contribute to a better control of the chronic pulmonary inflammation observed in CF subjects. Sputum samples from 15 CF and 10 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) subjects were collected and analyzed by LC/MS/MS, and blood fatty  were profiled by gas chromatography upon lipid extraction and transmethylation. Interestingly, CF subjects showed increased concentrations of leukotriene B (LTB), prostaglandin E (PGE), and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (15-HETE), when compared with COPD patients, whereas the concentrations of DHA metabolites did not differ between the two groups. After DHA supplementation, not only DHA/ (AA) ratio and highly unsaturated fatty  index were significantly increased in the subjects completing the study ( < 0.05) but also a reduction in LTB and 15-HETE was observed, together with a tendency for a decrease in PGE and an increase in 17-hydroxy-docosahexaenoic  (17OH-DHA) levels. At the end of the washout period, LTB, PGE, 15-HETE, and 17OH-DHA showed a trend to return to baseline values. In addition, 15-HETE/17OH-DHA ratio in the same sample significantly decreased after DHA supplementation ( < 0.01) when compared with baseline. In conclusion, our results show here that in CF patients, an impairment in fatty  , characterized by increased AA-derived metabolites and decreased DHA-derived metabolites, could be partially corrected by DHA supplementation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31292301>Changes in plasma lipids predict pravastatin efficacy in secondary prevention.</a></h2><p>BACKGROUNDStatins have pleiotropic effects on lipid .

We characterized the changes in lipids upon pravastatin treatment and defined the relationship with risk reduction for future cardiovascular events.METHODSPlasma lipids (n = 342) were measured in baseline and 1-year follow-up samples from a Long-Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease (LIPID) study subcohort (n = 4991). The associations of changes in lipids with treatment and cardiovascular outcomes were investigated using linear and Cox regression. The effect of treatment on future cardiovascular outcomes was examined by the relative risk reduction (RRR).RESULTSPravastatin treatment was associated with changes in 206 lipids. Species containing  were positively associated while phosphatidylinositol species were negatively associated with pravastatin treatment. The RRR from pravastatin treatment for cardiovascular events decreased from 23.5% to 16.6% after adjustment for clinical risk factors and change in LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and to 3.0% after further adjustment for the change in the lipid ratio PI(36:2)/PC(38:4). Change in PI(36:2)/PC(38:4) mediated 58% of the treatment effect. Stratification of patients into quartiles of change in PI(36:2)/PC(38:4) indicated no benefit of pravastatin in the fourth quartile.CONCLUSIONThe change in PI(36:2)/PC(38:4) predicted benefit from pravastatin, independent of change in LDL-C, demonstrating its potential as a biomarker for monitoring the clinical benefit of statin treatment in secondary prevention.TRIAL REGISTRATIONAustralian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry identifier ACTRN12616000535471.FUNDINGBristol-Myers Squibb; NHMRC grants 211086, 358395, and 1029754; NHMRC program grant 1149987; NHMRC fellowship 108026; and the Operational Infrastructure Support Program of the Victorian government of Australia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31470888>Exploring the microvascular impact of red blood cell transfusion in intensive care unit patients.</a></h2><p>Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is a common treatment for hospitalized patients.

This study aimed to examine whether eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and  (ARA) supplementation can protect fish cells against the negative impact of chlorpyrifos (CPF). Atlantic salmon hepatocytes were exposed to either 100 μM CPF, 200 μM EPA, 200 μM ARA, or combinations of these for 48 h, and endpoints included lipid droplet formation, gene expression, and global metabolomic analysis. The results showed that polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) supplementation modified the cell lipid composition, reduced uptake of CPF and increased the cellular number and size of lipid droplets. CPF exposure induced the transcription of ppara and fabp3, and reduced the levels of several PUFAs, and lead to accumulation of monoacylglycerols (MAGs) in the cells. Supplementation of EPA or ARA did not prevent CPF-induced accumulation of MAGs and only to a limited degree rescued the response on other lipids. CPF exposure further reduced energy , a response partly restored by PUFA supplementation. Reduced levels of glutathione indicated oxidative stress; an effect not ameliorated by the PUFAs. Altogether, this study shows that PUFA supplementation only modestly protects Atlantic salmon hepatocytes against the negative impact of CPF.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Fatty acids (FA) of Penaeid shrimps have been largely explored in the literature, and although they are unable to discriminate shrimps geographical origin or species, they might provide an interesting tool to distinguish their production method (wild vs. farmed). The present study is based on a literature compilation of Penaeid shrimp FA profiles encompassing all continents and 28 species. It reveals that the ratio of FA 18:2ω6 + FA 18:3ω3 / FA 16:1ω7 can differentiate wild vs. farmed Penaeid shrimps with 100% accuracy within the 207 FA profiles of the dataset considered. Assuming a normal distribution of the dataset, 94.4% of the farmed shrimps population is expected to exhibit a ratio above 2.92, and 99.7% of the wild shrimps population is expected to fall below 2.92.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to its clinical and genetic heterogeneity, the cellular and molecular processes in asthma are highly complex and relatively unknown. To discover novel biomarkers and the molecular mechanisms underlying asthma, several studies have been conducted by focusing on gene expression patterns in epithelium through microarray analysis. However, few robust specific biomarkers were identified and some inconsistent results were observed. Therefore, it is imperative to conduct a robust analysis to solve these problems. Herein, an integrated gene expression analysis of ten independent, publicly available microarray data of bronchial epithelial cells from 348 asthmatic patients and 208 healthy controls was performed. As a result, 78 up- and 75 down-regulated genes were identified in bronchial epithelium of asthmatics. Comprehensive functional enrichment and pathway analysis revealed that response to chemical stimulus, extracellular region,  in cancer, and   were the four most significantly enriched terms. In the protein-protein interaction network, three main communities associated with cytoskeleton, response to lipid, and regulation of response to stimulus were established, and the most highly ranked 6 hub genes (up-regulated , , , and down-regulated  and ) were identified and should be considered as new biomarkers. Pathway cross-talk analysis highlights that signaling  mediated by IL-4/13 and transcription factor HIF-1α and FOXA1 play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of asthma.

GO, KEGG, and Reactome pathway enrichment analyses indicated that upregulated genes were significantly enriched in ECM-receptor, focal adhesion, TGFβ signaling, and syndecan interactions, while downregulated genes were mainly involved in cell cycle regulation,  , oxidative phosphorylation, and folate biosynthesis (p < .05). The top upregulated (SATB1 (p < .0001), EYA2 (p < .0001) and KPNA7 (p < .0027)) and downregulated (PITX2 (p < .0007), PDLIM4 (p < .0020) and FABP5 (p < .0007)) genes were further validated via qRT-PCR analysis. In conclusion, the present study profiled DEGs in RWPE-1 and CTPE cells and identified gene  that may be associated with malignant transformation and tumor progression.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Studies on variations in the  genecluster provided some of the first examples for marked gene-diet interactions in modulating complex phenotypes, such as eczema, asthma, and cognition. Genotype distribution differs markedly among ethnicities, apparently reflecting an evolutionary advantage of genotypes enabling active long-chain PUFA synthesis when the introduction of agriculture provided diets rich in linoleic  but with little  and eicosapentaenoic acids. Discovering differential effects of PUFA supply that depend on variation of  genotypes could open new opportunities for developing precision nutrition strategies based either on an individual's genotype or on genotype distributions in specific populations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31595424>Untargeted metabolomics reveals alterations in metabolites of lipid  and immune  in the serum of rats after long-term oral administration of Amalaki rasayana.</a></h2><p>Amalaki rasayana, a traditional preparation, is widely used by Ayurvedic physicians for the treatment of inflammatory conditions, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer.  alterations induced by Amalaki rasayana intervention are unknown. We investigated the modulations in serum metabolomic profiles in Wistar rats following long-term oral administration of Amalaki rasayana. Global  profiling was performed of the serum of rats administered with either Amalaki rasayana (AR) or ghee + honey (GH) for 18 months and control animals which were left untreated. Amalaki rasayana components were confirmed from AR extract using HR-LCMS analysis. Significant reductions in prostaglandin J2, 11-dehydrothromboxane B2, and higher levels of reduced glutathione and glycitein metabolites were observed in the serum of AR administered rats compared to the control groups. Eleven different metabolites classified as phospholipids, glycerophospholipids, glucoside derivatives, organic acids, and glycosphingolipid were exclusively observed in the AR administered rats. Pathway analysis suggests that altered metabolites in AR administered rats are those associated with different biochemical  of  , fatty  , leukotriene , G-protein mediated events, phospholipid , and the immune system. Targeted metabolomics confirmed the presence of gallic , ellagic , and  components in the AR extract. The known activities of these components can be correlated with the altered  profile following long-term AR administration. AR also activates IGF1R-Akt-Foxo3 signaling axis in heart tissues of rats administered with AR.

This study aimed to investigate the role of intestinal flora and serum  induced by HD against hypertension. 16 spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHRs) were divided into HD group (5.9 g/kg) and model group (M) (normal saline), with eight Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats as control group (W) (normal saline). Rats were fed by gavage once a day for 28 days. The changes of intestinal flora and serum  were analyzed by 16S rDNA sequencing and LC-MS/MS assay. HD decreased blood pressure steadily, improved the structure and composition of imbalance flora in SHRs, increased the abundance and diversity of flora, and decreased flora Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio.  sp.  increased remarkably in M group.  and  increased significantly in HD group, which were functionally related to the significant increase of ,  and  in W group, which were all probiotics producing butyric , lactic , and regulating inflammation and other antihypertensive related factors. HD also changed the serum  pattern of SHRs. 16 potential biomarkers related to inflammation, vasodilation, steroid hormones, oxidative stress, and etc. changed significantly, mainly enriched in  , tryptophan , steroid hormone biosynthesis, and glutathione . The correlation analysis demonstrated that the dominant genius and species in three groups were highly correlated with steroid hormone biosynthesis,  , tryptophan , and vitamin B6 . Our research indicated that HD had a good antihypertensive effect, which may be driven by the protective intestinal flora and beneficial metabolites induced by it, and the metabolites were closely related to the changes of intestinal flora.

Laying broiler breeder (LBB) hens were supplemented with 40 mg/kg genistein (GEN), while the control group was fed with the low-soybean meal diet. The offspring chicks were grouped according to the mother generation with 8 replicates each. Hepatic transcriptome data revealed 3915 differentially expressed genes (DEGs,  adjusted < 0.05, fold change > 1.5 or fold change < 0.67) between chicks in the two groups. Maternal GEN activated the GH-IGF1-PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which promoted the developmental processes and cellular amino   processes, as well as inhibited the apoptotic process. GEN treatment significantly increased the weight gain, breast muscle percentage, and liver index in chicks. PANTHER clustering analysis suggested that maternal GEN enhanced the antioxidant activity of chicks by the upregulation of gene (SOD3, MT1, and MT4) expression. Accordingly, the activities of T-AOC and T-SOD in the liver were increased after GEN treatment. The overrepresentation tests revealed that maternal GEN influenced the glycolysis, unsaturated fatty  biosynthesis, acyl-coenzyme A , lipid transport, and cholesterol  in the chick livers. Hepatic cholesterol and long-chain fatty  were significantly decreased after GEN treatment. However, the level of  was higher in the livers of the GEN-treated group compared with the CON group. Moreover, GEN treatment enhanced fatty  -oxidation and upregulated PPAR expression in the chick liver. ChIP-qPCR analysis indicated that maternal GEN might induce histone H3-K36 trimethylation in the promoter region of PPAR gene (PPARD) through Iws1, methyltransferases. It also induced histone H4-K12 acetylation at the PPARD promoter through MYST2, which activated the PPAR signaling  in the chick livers. In summary, supplementing LBB hens with GEN can alter lipid  in the offspring chicks through epigenetic modification and improve the antioxidative capability as well as growth performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914513>Biphasic Dynamics of Macrophage Immunometabolism during  Infection.</a></h2><p>Macrophages are the primary targets of  infection; the early events of macrophage interaction with  define subsequent progression and outcome of infection.  can alter the innate immunity of macrophages, resulting in suboptimal Th1 immunity, which contributes to the survival, persistence, and eventual dissemination of the pathogen. Recent advances in immunometabolism illuminate the intimate link between the  states of immune cells and their specific functions. In this review, we describe the little-studied biphasic  dynamics of the macrophage response during progression of infection by  and discuss their relevance to macrophage immunity and  pathogenicity. The early phase of macrophage infection, which is marked by M1 polarization, is accompanied by a  switch from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α)-mediated aerobic glycolysis (also known as the Warburg effect in cancer cells), as well as by an upregulation of  involving oxidative and antioxidative defense responses, arginine , and synthesis of bioactive lipids. These early  changes are followed by a late adaptation/resolution phase in which macrophages transition from glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative , with a consequent dampening of macrophage proinflammatory and antimicrobial responses. Importantly, the identification of upregulated   and/or  regulatory mechanisms with immunomodulatory functions during M1 polarization has revealed novel mechanisms of  pathogenicity. These advances can lead to the development of novel host-directed therapies to facilitate bacterial clearance in tuberculosis by targeting the  state of immune cells.Copyright © 2019 Shi et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30992005>Intake of -containing lipids in adult humans: dietary surveys and clinical trials.</a></h2><p>Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) have important roles in physiological homeostasis.

We found that stimulation of dendritic cells with the fungal surrogate zymosan causes decreases of pyruvate, citrate, itaconate, and α-ketoglutarate, while increasing oxaloacetate, succinate, lactate, oxygen consumption, and pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. Expression of IL10 and IL23A (the gene encoding the p19 chain of IL-23) depended on pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. Mechanistically, pyruvate reinforced histone H3 acetylation, and acetate rescued the effect of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier inhibition, most likely because it is a substrate of the acetyl-CoA producing enzyme ACSS2. Mice lacking the receptor of the lipid mediator platelet-activating factor (PAF; 1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) showed reduced production of IL-10 and IL-23 that is explained by the requirement of acetyl-CoA for PAF biosynthesis and its ensuing autocrine function. Acetyl-CoA therefore intertwines fatty  remodeling of glycerophospholipids and energetic  during cytokine induction.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Oligodendrocytes are derived from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), which populate the adult central nervous system, but their physiological capability to myelin synthesis is limited. The low intake of essential lipids for sphingomyelin synthesis in the human diet may account for increased demyelination and the reduced efficiency of the remyelination process. In our study on lipid profiling in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis brain, we revealed that during acute inflammation, nervonic  synthesis is silenced, which is the effect of shifting the lipid  pathway of common substrates into proinflammatory  production. In the experiments on the human model of maturating oligodendrocyte precursor cells (hOPCs) in vitro, we demonstrated that fish oil mixture (FOM) affected the function of hOPCs, resulting in the improved synthesis of myelin basic protein, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, and proteolipid protein, as well as sphingomyelin. Additionally, FOM reduces proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and enhances fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) synthesis by hOPCs was also demonstrated. Based on these observations, we propose that the intake of FOM rich in the nervonic  ester may improve OL function, affecting OPC maturation and limiting inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31065079>High-throughput metabolomics and ingenuity pathway approach reveals the pharmacological effect and targets of Ginsenoside Rg1 in Alzheimer's disease mice.</a></h2><p>Ginsenoside Rg1, a natural triterpenoid saponins compound isolated from the Panax species, has been found to possess neuroprotective properties in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, its pharmacological mechanism on AD has not been studied. In this study, an ultra-performance liquid chromatography combined with quadrupole time of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q/TOF-MS) based non-targeted metabolomics strategy was performed to explore the mechanism of Ginsenoside Rg1 protecting against AD mice by characterizing  biomarkers and regulation  changes. A total of nineteen potential metabolites in serum were discovered and identified to manifest the difference between wild-type mice and triple transgenic mice in control and model group, respectively. Fourteen potential metabolites involved in ten   such as linoleic  ,  , tryptophan  and sphingolipid  were affected by Rg1.

But the exact mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenase-derived metabolites of , protecting against diabetes and DN. Herein, we hypothesized that activation of VDR attenuated high glucose-induced cellular injury in renal tubular epithelial cells partially through up-regulating CYP2J5 expression.Streptozotocin (STZ) was injected to induce diabetic in wild type and Vdr mice. The effects of VDR knockout and an activator of VDR, paricalcitol, on the renal injury were detected. In vitro, a murine kidney proximal tubule epithelial cell line BU.MPT induced by high glucose were treated with or without paricalcitol (30 mM) for 12 h or 24 h.The expression of CYP2J5 was significantly decreased both in wild type and Vdr diabetic mice induced by STZ. The STZ-induced kidney architecture damage and apoptosis rate in Vdr mice were more severe. In vitro, high glucose treatment strongly reduced the CYP2J5 expression and the synthesis of 14,15-EET in BU.MPT cells. Supplement of 14,15-EET significantly reduced the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release induced by high glucose in BU.MPT cells. Furthermore, treatment with paricalcitol attenuated cellular injury and restored the expression of CYP2J5 reduced by high glucose in BU.MPT cells.We conclude that activation of VDR attenuates high glucose-induced cellular injury partially dependent on CYP2J5 in murine renal tubule epithelial cells and paricalcitol may represent a potential therapy for DN.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Anti-inflammatory effects for high-molecular-weight (HMW) HA and pro-inflammatory effects for low-molecular-weight (LMW) HA effects were found for various myeloid cells, including microglia. Astrocytes are cells of ectodermal origin that play a pivotal role in brain inflammation, but the link between HA with different molecular weights and an inflammatory response in these cells is not clear. We tested the effects of LMW and HMW HA in rat primary astrocytes, stimulated with Poly:IC (PIC, TLR3 agonist) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS, TLR4 agonist).

Increasing evidences suggest that the alterations in tumor , including metabolite abundance and accumulation of  products, lead to local immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. An integrated analysis of lipid  in cancers from different tissues using multiple omics data may provide novel insight into the understanding of tumorigenesis and progression.Through systematic analysis of the multiple omics data from TCGA, we found that the most-widely altered lipid   in pan-cancer are fatty  ,  , cholesterol  and PPAR signaling. Gene expression profiles of fatty   show commonalities across pan-cancer, while the alteration in cholesterol  and   differ with tissue origin, suggesting tissue specific lipid  features in different tumor types.

In this study, an analytical method based on bio-affinity ultrafiltration coupled with ultra performance liquid chromatography and quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (BAUF-UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) was established for rapidly screening and identifying COX-2 ligands. Meanwhile, the specificity of the method was verified by denatured COX-2 and inactive compound. Next, the biological activity of ligands screened was proved by enzyme inhibition assay. The preferred binding modes for these COX-2 inhibitors were then determined by molecular docking. Finally, network pharmacology was used to explore the  involved anti-inflammatory effects. As a result, five COX-2 inhibitors were selected in the extract of Andrographis Herba (AH), including andrographolide (1), 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographiside (2), andrographidine E (3), andrographidine D (4), and deoxyandrographolide (5). Among them, compounds 2, 3, 4 and 5 were reported to have COX-2 inhibitory activity for the first time. The result of COX-2 inhibition assay showed that compound 3 had an IC of 19 μM, compounds 2 and 5 had an IC of >200 μM.

Thus, there is an urgent need to identify the underlying mechanisms and develop strategies to overcome them.A homology model of human CYP4A11 was constructed using SYBYL-X 2.0. Structure-based virtual screening against COX-2, mPGES-1 and CYP4A11was performed using the Surflex-Dock of the SYBYL suite. The candidates were further evaluated their antiangiogenic activities in a zebrafish embryo and rabbit corneal angiogenesis model. Laser doppler analysis was used to measure tumor perfusion. The expression of CD31 and α-SMA was measured by immunofluorescence. Western blot was used to measure the expression of HIF-1, Akt and p-Akt. The gene expression of FGF-2, G-CSF, PDGF, TGF-β, Tie-2, VEGF, lncRNA NEAT1 and miR-194-5p were determined using qPCR. The production of FGF-2, TGF-β and VEGF were analyzed using ELISA.

In zebrafish screening, isoliquiritigenin (ISL) exhibited the most potent antiangiogenic activities with the EC values of 5.9 μM. Conversely, the antiangiogenic effects of ISL in the zebrafish and rabbit corneal models were partly reversed by 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (20-HETE) or prostaglandin E2 (PGE). ISL normalized glioma vasculature and improved the efficacy of temozolomide therapy in the rat C6 glioma model. Inhibition of COX-2, mPGES-1 and CYP4A by ISL decreased FGF-2, TGF-β and VEGF production in the C6 and U87 glioma cells with p-Akt downregulation, which was reversed by Akt overexpression. Furthermore, ISL downregulated lncRNA NEAT1 but upregulated miR-194-5p in the U87 glioma cell.

EETs elicit endothelial angiogenic activity linked to tumor growth in various cancer models that can be attenuated in vivo by COX-2 inhibitors. This study further defines the relationship between endothelial EET  and COX-2 in promoting angiogenesis. Using human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs), we quantified 8,9-EET-induced tube formation and cell migration as indicators of angiogenic potential, in the presence and absence of a COX-2 inducer (PDBu). Although PDBu itself was potent in increasing angiogenic markers, 8,9-EET in combination with PDBu elicited a 1.3-fold larger response than 8,9-EET alone, and compared to PDBu. Contributing to this response were 8,9-EET metabolites formed from COX-2, the 11-hydroxy-8,9-EET (8,9,11-EHET) and 15-hydroxy-8,9-EET (8,9,15-EHET). When exogenously dosed into HAEC, synthetic 8,9,11-EHET enhanced angiogenesis at all concentrations tested, whereas 8,9,15-EHET was inactive. Tube formation by 8,9,11-EHET was independent of PI3K-Akt, p38 MAPK, and MEK signaling. These results indicate that 8,9-EET-stimulated angiogenesis is enhanced by COX-2  in endothelium through formation of 8,9,11-EHET. This lipid mediator may play a role in regulating physiological angiogenesis, and it may be especially important under circumstances where COX-2 is induced, such as in cancer tumor growth and inflammation. Finally, the generation of 8, 9, 11-EHET from 8, 9-EET may help explain why EETs are weakly angiogenic under some conditions yet block tumor growth under other conditions.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31140173> and Nitroarachidonic: Effects on NADPH Oxidase Activity.</a></h2><p> (AA) is a polyunsaturated fatty  that participates in the inflammatory response mainly through bioactive-lipids formation in macrophages and also in the phagocytic NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) activation. NOX2 is the enzyme responsible for a huge superoxide formation in macrophages, essential to eliminate pathogens inside the phagosome. The oxidase is an enzymatic complex comprised of a membrane-bound flavocytochrome b  (gp91/p22), three cytosolic subunits (p47, p40 and p67) and a Rac-GTPase. The enzyme becomes active when macrophages are exposed to appropriate stimuli that trigger the phosphorylation of cytosolic subunits and its migration to plasmatic membrane to form the active complex. It is proposed that AA stimulates NOX2 activity through AA interaction with different components of the NADPH oxidase complex. In inflammatory conditions, there is an increase in reactive oxygen and nitrogen species that results in the production of nitrated derivatives of AA, such as nitroarachidonic  (NO-AA). NO-AA is capable to inhibit NOX2 activity by interfering with p47 migration to the membrane without affecting phosphorylation of cytosolic proteins. Also, NO-AA is capable to interact with protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), which is involved on NOX2 active complex formation. It has been demonstrated that NO-AA forms a covalent adduct with PDI that could prevent the interaction with NOX2 and it would explain the inhibitory effects of the fatty  upon NOX2. Together, current data indicate that AA is an important activator of NOX2 formed in the early events of the inflammatory response, leading to a massive production of oxidants that may, in turn, promote NO-AA formation and shutting down the oxidative burst.

Platelet function in patients 50 years or older with coronary artery disease on 100 mg/day aspirin was measured by light transmission aggregometry (LTA) of  (AA)-induced platelet aggregation. The expression of eight candidate genes-PTGS1/COX1, PLA2G4A, PLA2G6, PLA2G7, TBXAS1, TBXA2R, PTGIR, and ITGA2B-and the ingredients involved in AA  were analyzed. Our data showed that the expressions of thromboxane A synthase 1 (TBXAS1), thromboxane synthase (TXS), and thromboxane B (TXB) were increased in the upper quartile of platelet aggregation (LTA-AA_Q4) group compared with the lower quartile of platelet aggregation (LTA-AA_Q1) group. Our bioinformatics analysis suggested that TBXAS1 was targeted by miR-34b-3p via binding to its 3'-UTR, which was subsequently verified experimentally. Although overexpression of miR-34b-3p exhibited no apparent effect on cell proliferation, inhibition of miR-34b-3p promoted megakaryocyte viability. Our data demonstrated that the expression of TBXAS1 was higher in the aspirin hyporesponsiveness group than that in the hyperresponsiveness group, suggesting that high expression of TBXAS1 may be associated with aspirin hyporesponsiveness. miR-34b-3p may regulate the platelet and aspirin response by suppressing TBXAS1 expression and megakaryocyte proliferation.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31191306>High-Throughput Metabolomics Evaluate the Efficacy of Total Lignans From Acanthophanax Senticosus Stem Against Ovariectomized Osteoporosis Rat.</a></h2><p>Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) is a common clinical illness in postmenopausal women, but there is no effective drug at present.

Recent studies have shown that the polymorphism locus in the promoter region of  gene affects LTB4 expression level and the susceptibility to extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Thus, we identified a total of 148 patients with intestinal tuberculosis, 145 with Crohn's disease, and 700 normal controls in this study.All the study participants were local Han people from Jiangxi Province in the past eleven years. DNA was extracted from the paraffin-embedded specimens or the whole blood. The  promoter SNP (rs17525495) was genotyped with TaqMan assay.The T-alleles frequency was not significantly increased in patients with intestinal tuberculosis compared with healthy control group (=0.630; OR=1.07; 95%CI=0.81-1.41), while patients with Crohn's disease have significantly increased T allele frequency compared with healthy population (=0.032; OR=1.34; 95%CI=1.03-1.75). During treatment, the presence of the T allele significantly increased the proportion of Crohn's patients requiring glucocorticoids (<0.05).The T allele of  gene SNP (rs17525495) is a risk factor for Crohn's disease instead of intestinal tuberculosis. More importantly, there may be a potential association of the different genotypes of rs17525495 with the treatment efficacy of 5-ASA and glucocorticoids in patients with Crohn's disease.

ECs interact with the blood and lymph. The endothelium fulfils functions such as vasodilatation, regulation of adhesion, infiltration of leukocytes, inhibition of platelet adhesion, vessel remodeling and lipoprotein . ECs synthesize and release compounds such as nitric oxide (NO), metabolites of , reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enzymes that degrade the extracellular matrix. Endothelial dysfunction represents a phenotype prone to atherogenesis and may be used as a marker of atherosclerotic risk. Such dysfunction includes impaired synthesis and availability of NO and an imbalance in the relative contribution of endothelial-derived relaxing factors and contracting factors such as endothelin-1 and angiotensin. This dysfunction appears before the earliest anatomic evidence of atherosclerosis and could be an important initial step in further development of atherosclerosis. Endothelial dysfunction was historically treated with vitamin C supplementation and L-arginine supplementation. Short term improvement of the expression of adhesion molecule and endothelial function during antioxidant therapy has been observed. Statins are used in the treatment of hyperlipidaemia, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Future studies should focus on identifying the mechanisms involved in the beneficial effects of statins on the endothelium. This may help develop drugs specifically aimed at endothelial dysfunction.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959940>Comparison of Fatty  Profiles in a Group of Female Patients with Chronic Kidney Diseases (CKD) and  Syndrome (MetS)⁻Similar Trends of Changes, Different Pathophysiology.</a></h2><p>Fatty  (FA) profiles in the plasma of patients with  syndrome and chronic kidney disease (CKD) seem to be identical despite their different etiology (dietary mistakes vs. cachexia). The aim of this study was to compare both profiles and to highlight the differences that could influence the improvement of the treatment of patients in both groups. The study involved 73 women, including 24 patients with chronic kidney disease treated with haemodialysis, 19 patients with  syndrome (MetS), and 30 healthy women in the control group. A total of 35 fatty acids and derivatives were identified and quantified by gas chromatography. Intensified elongation processes from  C10:0 to C16:0 were noted in both groups (more intense in MetS), as well as an increased synthesis of  (C20:4n6), which was more intense in CKD. Significant correlations of oleic  (C18:1n9), gamma linoleic  (C18:3n6), and docosatetraenoate  (C22:4n6) with parameters of CKD patients were observed. In the MetS group, auxiliary   of oleic  were activated, which simultaneously inhibited the synthesis of eicosapentanoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) from alpha lipoic  (ALA). On the other hand, in the group of female patients with CKD, the synthesis of EPA and DHA was intensified. Activation of the synthesis of oleic  (C18: 1n9 ct) and trans-vaccinic  (C18:1) is a protective mechanism in kidney diseases and especially in MetS due to the increased concentration of saturated fatty  (SFA) in plasma. The cause of the increased amount of all FAs in plasma in the CKD group, especially in the case of palmitic (C16:0) and derivatives stearic (C18:0) acids, may be the decomposition of adipose tissue and the progressing devastation of the organism, whereas, in the MetS group, dietary intake seems to be the main reason for the increase in SFA. Moreover, in MetS, auxiliary   are activated for oleic , which cause the simultaneous inhibition of EPA and DHA synthesis from ALA, whereas, in the CKD group, we observe an increased synthesis of EPA and DHA. The higher increase of nervonic  (C24:1) in CKD suggests a higher degree of demyelination and loss of axons.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927246>Sodium Orthovanadate Changes Fatty  Composition and Increased Expression of Stearoyl-Coenzyme A Desaturase in THP-1 Macrophages.</a></h2><p>Vanadium compounds are promising antidiabetic agents. In addition to regulating glucose , they also alter lipid . Due to the clear association between diabetes and atherosclerosis, the purpose of the present study was to assess the effect of sodium orthovanadate on the amount of individual fatty acids and the expression of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD or Δ-desaturase), Δ-desaturase, and Δ-desaturase in macrophages. THP-1 macrophages differentiated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were incubated in vitro for 48 h with 1 μM or 10 μM sodium orthovanadate (NaVO). The estimation of fatty  composition was performed by gas chromatography. Expressions of the genes SCD, fatty  desaturase 1 (FADS1), and fatty  desaturase 2 (FADS2) were tested by qRT-PCR. Sodium orthovanadate in THP-1 macrophages increased the amount of saturated fatty acids (SFA) such as palmitic  and stearic , as well as monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)-oleic  and palmitoleic . Sodium orthovanadate caused an upregulation of SCD expression. Sodium orthovanadate at the given concentrations did not affect the amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) such as linoleic , , eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosapentaenoic  (DPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA). In conclusion, sodium orthovanadate changed SFA and MUFA composition in THP-1 macrophages and increased expression of SCD. Sodium orthovanadate did not affect the amount of any PUFA. This was associated with a lack of influence on the expression of FADS1 and FADS2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306767>Role of acyl-CoA synthetase ACSL4 in  .</a></h2><p>The activation of long-chain free fatty acids is the first step reaction of their usage in the cells and tissues, which are catalyzed by a family of enzymes called acyl-coenzyme A synthetases long-chain isoform (ACSL).

To address this uncertainty and inform international recommendations, we evaluated how in vivo circulating and tissue levels of linoleic  (LA) and  (AA) relate to incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) across multiple international studies.We performed harmonized, de novo, individual-level analyses in a global consortium of 30 prospective observational studies from 13 countries. Multivariable-adjusted associations of circulating and adipose tissue LA and AA biomarkers with incident total CVD and subtypes (coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, cardiovascular mortality) were investigated according to a prespecified analytic plan. Levels of LA and AA, measured as the percentage of total fatty acids, were evaluated linearly according to their interquintile range (ie, the range between the midpoint of the first and fifth quintiles), and categorically by quintiles. Study-specific results were pooled using inverse-variance-weighted meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was explored by age, sex, race, diabetes mellitus, statin use, aspirin use, omega-3 levels, and fatty  desaturase 1 genotype (when available).In 30 prospective studies with medians of follow-up ranging 2.5 to 31.9 years, 15 198 incident cardiovascular events occurred among 68 659 participants. Higher levels of LA were significantly associated with lower risks of total CVD, cardiovascular mortality, and ischemic stroke, with hazard ratios per interquintile range of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.88-0.99), 0.78 (0.70-0.85), and 0.88 (0.79-0.98), respectively, and nonsignificantly with lower coronary heart disease risk (0.94; 0.88-1.00). Relationships were similar for LA evaluated across quintiles. AA levels were not associated with higher risk of cardiovascular outcomes; in a comparison of extreme quintiles, higher levels were associated with lower risk of total CVD (0.92; 0.86-0.99). No consistent heterogeneity by population subgroups was identified in the observed relationships.In pooled global analyses, higher in vivo circulating and tissue levels of LA and possibly AA were associated with lower risk of major cardiovascular events.

Very-low-carbohydrate diets have been shown to improve glucose control and the inflammatory response. We aimed to determine the effects of a eucaloric ketogenic diet (EKD) enriched with ω-3 fatty acids (O3KD) on glucose levels and inflammation in mice with endotoxemia.Adult mice were fed 1 of 3 diets (control diet [CD], EKD, or O3KD). After 4 weeks, each group received saline or Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (5 mg/kg) intraperitoneally during the postprandial (PPP) or postabsorptive (PAP) periods. Blood glucose was measured at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 minutes. Serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL) 6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Distribution of serum fatty acids was determined by gas liquid chromatography. Hepatic expression of genes involved in inflammation, as well as glucose and lipid , were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.During the PPP, glucose curves were comparable among the experimental groups. During the PAP, EKD showed a more pronounced increase in glucose levels at the first hour after LPS challenge compared with the CD-LPS group. During the PAP, IL6 was lower in O3KD-LPS compared with CD-LPS and EKD-LPS groups. These differences disappeared in the PPP. Similarly, TNF-α was lower in the O3KD-LPS group compared with the EKD-LPS group. The O3KD significantly increased the serum levels of the ω-3 eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids and decreased the ω-6 .An O3KD leads to reduced inflammation and maintains glucose homeostasis in mice with endotoxemia.© 2019 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31295355>Growth and fatty  profiles of Halophytophthora vesicula and Salispina spinosa from Philippine mangrove leaves.</a></h2><p>Studies on marine-sourced fatty acids have gathered significant interest recently as an important component of aquaculture feeds and of biofuel production.

This study explored the protective effects of GEB against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion using Information-Dependent Acquisition (IDA)-mediated UPLC-Q/TOF-MS-based plasma metabolomics. Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury was induced in male Wistar rats using the Zea Longa method. Biochemical and histological assays were performed to evaluate the therapeutic effects of GEB on IR rats. We found that the neurobehavioral scores and infarction areas of GEB and nimodipine treated groups were dramatically lower than those of the IR groups. Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) staining and TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) showed that GEB significantly improved neuronal injury and prevented neuronal apoptosis. Biochemical analysis revealed that GEB prevented cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by regulating inflammation and oxidative injury. Through ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry-metabolomics-based approaches, 43 plasma metabolites related to GEB treatment were detected, 6 of which significantly differed (p < 0.05) between the model and GEB groups. The levels of l-histidine, sphinganine, thymine, spermidine and deoxycytidine in the IR group were significantly higher than those in the sham group, but decreased following GEB treatment.  levels were lower in the IR group, but dramatically increased in response to GEB. Pharmacodynamics and metabolomics confirmed that the mechanism of GEB in the treatment of cerebral ischemia was not only related to the reduction of inflammation, oxidation, neurotoxicity, and apoptosis, but also mediated through  , histidine , pyrimidine , arginine and proline , sphingolipid , and glycerophospholipid  in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480463>Molecular Functionality of Cytochrome P450 4 (CYP4) Genetic Polymorphisms and Their Clinical Implications.</a></h2><p>Enzymes in the cytochrome P450 4 (CYP4) family are involved in the  of fatty acids, xenobiotics, therapeutic drugs, and signaling molecules, including eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and prostanoids.

Based on these three  , AA could be converted into various metabolites that trigger different inflammatory responses. In the kidney, prostaglandins (PG), thromboxane (Tx), leukotrienes (LTs) and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) are the major metabolites generated from AA. An increased level of prostaglandins (PGs), TxA and leukotriene B4 (LTB) results in inflammatory damage to the kidney. Moreover, the LTB-leukotriene B4 receptor 1 (BLT1) axis participates in the acute kidney injury via mediating the recruitment of renal neutrophils. In addition, AA can regulate renal ion transport through 19-hydroxystilbenetetraenoic  (19-HETE) and 20-HETE, both of which are produced by cytochrome P450 monooxygenase. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) generated by the CYP450 enzyme also plays a paramount role in the kidney damage during the inflammation process. For example, 14 and 15-EET mitigated ischemia/reperfusion-caused renal tubular epithelial cell damage. Many drug candidates that target the AA   are being developed to treat kidney inflammation.

Evidenced by the molecular dynamic studies and the use of Y385F COX-2, it was observed that the breakage of the pentapeptide has probably been taken place through H-bond activation of the peptide bond by the side chains of Y385 and S530.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30971474>Replication of Marek's Disease Virus Is Dependent on Synthesis of  Fatty  and Prostaglandin E.</a></h2><p>Marek's disease virus (MDV) causes deadly lymphoma and induces an imbalance of the lipid  in infected chickens. Here, we discovered that MDV activates the fatty  synthesis (FAS) pathway in primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs). In addition, MDV-infected cells contained high levels of fatty acids and showed increased numbers of lipid droplets (LDs). Chemical inhibitors of the FAS pathway (TOFA and C75) reduced MDV titers by approximately 30-fold. Addition of the downstream metabolites, including malonyl-coenzyme A and palmitic , completely restored the inhibitory effects of the FAS inhibitors. Furthermore, we could demonstrate that MDV infection activates the COX-2/prostaglandin E (PGE) pathway, as evident by increased levels of , COX-2 expression, and PGE synthesis. Inhibition of the COX-2/PGE pathway by chemical inhibitors or knockdown of COX2 using short hairpin RNA reduced MDV titers, suggesting that COX-2 promotes virus replication. Exogenous PGE completely restored the inhibition of the COX-2/PGE pathway in MDV replication. Unexpectedly, exogenous PGE also partially rescued the inhibitory effects of FAS inhibitors on MDV replication, suggesting that there is a link between these two  in MDV infection. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the FAS and COX-2/PGE  play an important role in the replication of this deadly pathogen. Disturbances of the lipid  in chickens infected with MDV contribute to the pathogenesis of disease. However, the role of lipid  in MDV replication remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate that MDV infection activates FAS and induces LD formation. Moreover, our results demonstrate that MDV replication is highly dependent on the FAS pathway and the downstream metabolites. Finally, our results reveal that MDV also activates the COX-2/PGE pathway, which supports MDV replication by activating PGE/EP2 and PGE/EP4 signaling .Copyright © 2019 Boodhoo et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31061331>Analysis on the Substrate Specificity of Recombinant Human Acyl-CoA Synthetase ACSL4 Variants.</a></h2><p>Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family members (ACSLs) are a family of enzymes that convert long-chain free fatty acids into their acyl-CoAs. ACSL4 is an ACSL isozyme with a strong preference for  (AA) and has been hypothesized to modulate the  fates of AA. There are two ACSL4 splice variants: ACSL4V1, which is the more abundant transcript, and ACSL4V2, which is believed to be restricted to the brain. In the present study, we expressed recombinant human ACSL4V1 and V2 in Spodoptera frugiperda 9 (Sf9) cells using the baculovirus expression system and then partially purified both variants by cobalt affinity column chromatography. We then established a novel ACSL assay system with LC-MS/MS, which is highly sensitive and applicable to various kinds of fatty acids, and used it to investigate the substrate specificity of recombinant human ACSL4V1 and V2. The results showed that both ACSL4 variants preferred various kinds of highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs), including docosahexaenoic  (DHA), adrenic  (docosatetraenoic ) and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), as well as AA as a substrate. Moreover, our kinetic studies revealed that the two variants had similar relative affinities for AA, EPA and DHA but different reaction rates for each HUFA. These results confirmed the importance of both of ACSL4 variants in the maintenance of membrane phospholipids bearing HUFAs. Structural analysis of these variants might reveal the molecular mechanism by which they maintain membrane phospholipids bearing HUFAs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31072371>Integrated omics-based pathway analyses uncover CYP epoxygenase-associated  as theranostic targets for metastatic triple negative breast cancer.</a></h2><p>Current prognostic tools and targeted therapeutic approaches have limited value for metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Building upon current knowledge, we hypothesized that epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and related CYP450 epoxygenases may have differential roles in breast cancer signaling, and better understanding of which may uncover potential directions for molecular stratification and personalized therapy for TNBC patients.We analyzed the oxylipin metabolome of paired tumors and adjacent normal mammary tissues from patients with pathologically confirmed breast cancer (N = 62). We used multivariate statistical analysis to identify important metabolite contributors and to determine the predictive power of tumor tissue metabolite clustering. In vitro functional assays using a panel of breast cancer cell lines were carried out to further confirm the crucial roles of endogenous and exogenous EETs in the metastasis transformation of TNBC cells. Deregulation of associated downstream signaling  associated with EETs/CYPs was established using transcriptomics datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC). Comparative TNBC proteomics using the same tissue specimens subjected to oxylipin metabolomics analysis was used as validation set.Metabolite-by-metabolite comparison, tumor immunoreactivity, and gene expression analyses showed that CYP epoxygenases and -epoxygenation products, EET metabolites, are strongly associated with TNBC metastasis. Notably, all the 4 EET isomers (5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-EET) was observed to profoundly drive the metastasis transformation of mesenchymal-like TNBC cells among the TNBC (basal- and mesenchymal-like), HER2-overexpressing and luminal breast cancer cell lines examined. Our pathway analysis revealed that, in hormone-positive breast cancer subtype, CYP epoxygenase overexpression is more related to immune cell-associated signaling, while EET-mediated Myc, Ras, MAPK, EGFR, HIF-1α, and NOD1/2 signaling are the molecular vulnerabilities of metastatic CYP epoxygenase-overexpressing TNBC tumors.This study suggests that categorizing breast tumors according to their EET metabolite ratio classifiers and CYP epoxygenase profiles may be useful for prognostic and therapeutic assessment. Modulation of CYP epoxygenase and EET-mediated signaling  may offer an effective approach for personalized treatment of breast cancer, and may be an effective intervention option for metastatic TNBC patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31257613>Camelina sativa Oil, Fatty Fish, and Lean Fish Do Not Markedly Affect Urinary Prostanoids in Subjects with Impaired Glucose .</a></h2><p>Dietary fatty acids are suggested to affect oxidative stress; however, results from interventions have been inconclusive. The aim was to examine if fatty fish, lean fish, and Camelina sativa oil (CSO) affect the urinary prostanoid levels in subjects with impaired glucose . Altogether 79 participants aged 43-72 years completed a randomized controlled study lasting 12 weeks. There were four parallel groups, fatty fish, lean fish (four fish meals/week in both), CSO providing 10 g/day alpha-linolenic  (ALA), and control diet with limited fish and ALA containing oil consumption. Urinary prostanoids (prostaglandin F , 5-F -isoprostanes and 15-F -isoprostane metabolites, isofuran, 8-F -isoprostanes, and 4-(RS)-4-F -neuroprostane) of 72 participants (age: mean (±SD) 58.9 ± 6.5 years; body mass index: 29.3 ± 2.5 kg/m ) collected over 12-h were measured using liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry. Plasma phospholipid fatty acids were determined using gas chromatography. Our study showed that the proportion of ALA in plasma phospholipids increased in the CSO group (overall difference among the groups p-value <0.001). In the fatty fish group, proportions of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids increased (overall p-value <0.001 for both). Prostaglandin F was higher in the CSO group than in the control group (p < 0.05), however, there were no other significant changes in urinary excretion of other prostanoids among the study groups. At baseline,  in plasma phospholipids was positively (r = 0.247, p < 0.05) and ALA negatively (r = -0.326, p < 0.05) associated with urinary total isoprostanes. In conclusion, CSO, fatty fish, and lean fish consumption do not cause major changes in oxidative stress markers in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance.© 2019 AOCS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128719>Metabolomic foundation for differential responses of lipid  to nitrogen and phosphorus deprivation in an -producing green microalga.</a></h2><p>The green oleaginous microalga Lobosphaera incisa accumulates storage lipids triacylglycerols (TAG) enriched in the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty   under nitrogen (N) deprivation. In contrast, under phosphorous (P) deprivation, the production of the monounsaturated oleic  prevails. We compared physiological responses, ultrastructural, and  consequences of L. incisa acclimation to N and P deficiency to provide novel insights into the key determinants of ARA accumulation. Differential responses to nutrient deprivation on growth performance, carbon-to-nitrogen stoichiometry, membrane lipid composition and TAG accumulation were demonstrated. Ultrastructural analyses suggested a dynamic role for vacuoles in sustaining cell homeostasis under conditions of different nutrient availability and their involvement in autophagy in L. incisa. Paralleling ARA-rich TAG accumulation in lipid droplets, N deprivation triggered intensive chloroplast dismantling and promoted catabolic processes. Metabolome analysis revealed depletion of amino acids and pyrimidines, and repression of numerous biosynthetic hubs to favour TAG biosynthesis under N deprivation. Under P deprivation, despite the relatively low growth penalties, the presence of the endogenous P reserves and the characteristic lipid remodelling,  signatures of energy deficiency were revealed. Metabolome adjustments to P deprivation included depletion in ATP and phosphorylated nucleotides, increased levels of TCA-cycle intermediates and osmoprotectants. We conclude that characteristic cellular and metabolome adjustments tailor the adaptive responses of L. incisa to N and P deprivation modulating its LC-PUFA production.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ALD stems from the production of toxic-reactive metabolites, oxidative stress and fat accumulation in hepatocytes which ultimately results in hepatocyte death promoting hepatitis and fibrosis deposition. Monocyte-derived infiltrating Ly6C and Ly6C macrophages are instrumental in perpetuating and resolving the hepatitis and fibrosis associated with ALD pathogenesis. In the present study we isolated liver infiltrating macrophages from mice on an ethanol diet and subjected them to metabolomic and proteomic analysis to provide a broad assessment of the cellular metabolite and protein differences between infiltrating macrophage phenotypes. We identified numerous differentially regulated metabolites and proteins between Ly6C and Ly6C macrophages. Bioinformatic analysis for pathway enrichment of the differentially regulated metabolites showed a significant number of metabolites involved in the processes of glycerophospholipid ,   and phospholipid biosynthesis. From analysis of the infiltrating macrophage proteome, we observed a significant enrichment in the biological processes of antigen presentation, actin polymerization and organization, phagocytosis and apoptotic regulation. The data presented herein could yield exciting new research avenues for the analysis of signaling  regulating macrophage polarization in ALD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029017>The effects of omega-3 fatty  deficiency during development on oxidative fatty  degradation during maturity in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.</a></h2><p> conditions during brain development may have long-term consequences on brain , thereby influencing the risk of neurodegenerative disease in later life. To ascertain the long-term consequences of omega-3 (ω3) fatty  deficiency during brain development on oxidative fatty  degradation in the brain and the development of Alzheimer-like pathology, wild-type (WT) female mice were fed diets that were either replete or deficient in ω3 fatty acids for 5 weeks. These females were then mated with hemizygous 5xFAD male transgenic (TG) mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, and the progeny were continued on diets that were either ω3-replete or ω3-deficient. When the progeny were 6 months of age, they received radiolabeled  (ARA) by intracerebroventricular injection. Five days after these injections, the brains were harvested and oxidative degradation of the radiolabeled ARA was characterized. Among the progeny of female mice on an ω3-replete diet, TG progeny had lower PSD-95 expression and higher oxidative ARA degradation than WT progeny. Progeny on an ω3-deficient diet, however, had no significant differences in PSD-95 expression between TG and WT mice, or in the extent of ARA degradation. In TG mice, an ω3-deficient diet reduced oxidative ARA degradation to a greater extent than in WT mice. The reductions in oxidative ARA degradation occurred even if the progeny of female mice on an ω3-deficient diet resumed an ω3-replete diet immediately on weaning. These results demonstrate that dietary ω3 fatty  deficiency during development can cause long-term changes in the expression of a synaptic marker and long-term reductions in the rate of ARA degradation in the WT brain, which are not completely alleviated by an ω3-replete diet after weaning. The elimination of differences between TG and WT mice by an ω3-deficient diet suggests that mechanisms regulating PSD-95 expression and the oxidative degradation of ARA are related and that the timing of dietary ω3 intake during development may influence Alzheimer's disease-related pathological changes later in life.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

While the mechanisms regulating macrophage recruitment in obesity have been delineated, the signals directing macrophage persistence in VAT are poorly understood. We previously showed that the neuroimmune guidance cue netrin-1 is expressed in the VAT of obese mice and humans, where it promotes macrophage accumulation. To better understand the source of netrin-1 and its effects on adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) fate and function in obesity, we generated mice with myeloid-specific deletion of netrin-1 (   ; Ntn1). Interestingly, Ntn1 mice showed a modest decrease in HFD-induced adiposity and adipocyte size, in the absence of changes in food intake or leptin, that was accompanied by an increase in markers of adipocyte beiging (, UCP-1). Using single cell RNA-seq, combined with conventional histological and flow cytometry techniques, we show that myeloid-specific deletion of netrin-1 caused a 50% attrition of ATMs in HFD-fed mice, particularly of the resident macrophage subset, and altered the phenotype of residual ATMs to enhance lipid handling. Pseudotime analysis of single cell transcriptomes showed that in the absence of netrin-1, macrophages in the obese VAT underwent a phenotypic switch with the majority of ATMs activating a program of genes specialized in lipid handling, including fatty  uptake and intracellular transport, lipid droplet formation and lipolysis, and regulation of lipid localization. Furthermore, Ntn1 macrophages had reduced expression of genes involved in  , and targeted LCMS/MS metabololipidomics analysis revealed decreases in proinflammatory eicosanoids (5-HETE, 6- LTB, TXB, PGD) in the obese VAT. Collectively, our data show that targeted deletion of netrin-1 in macrophages reprograms the ATM phenotype in obesity, leading to reduced adipose inflammation, and improved lipid handling and  function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880507>Metformin inhibits both oleic -induced and CB1R receptor agonist-induced lipid accumulation in Hep3B cells: The preliminary report.</a></h2><p>Fatty liver is characterized by excessive accumulation of triglycerides within hepatocytes. Recent findings indicate that natural history of nonalcoholic fatty liver is regulated, in part, by endogenous cannabinoids. Metformin is an oral hypoglycemic medication which inhibits gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in hepatocytes and limits lipid storage in the liver through the inhibition of free fatty  formation via induction of activated protein kinase activity (AMPK). Both endocannabinoids and metformin may modulate hepatosteatosis; therefore, it was interesting to examine whether metformin may affect lipid accumulation in hepatocytes by acting on cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, in in vitro study. Hep3B cells were incubated with or without metformin (Met), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and oleic  (OA). Cells without any of the examined substances served as negative control. Cells treated only with OA served as positive control. The quantity of intracellular lipids was assessed using Oil-Red-O staining. Selective CB1R agonist, arachidonyl-2-chloromethylamide (ACEA), and CB2R agonist, AM1241 (2-iodo-5-nitrophenyl)-[1-(methylpiperidin-2-ylmethyl)-1 H-indol-3-yl]methanone, were also used to treat Hep3B cells. In some experiments, antagonist for CB1R, AM6545, or SR144528 as selective antagonist of CB2R were used. In the study, Met decreased lipid accumulation in cells treated with OA and inhibited CB1R agonist-induced lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. The CB2R agonist-induced hepatic lipid accumulation was not inhibited by metformin. The results indicate that metformin may interact with endocannabinoid system in the liver by inhibiting CB1R agonist-stimulated fat accumulation in hepatocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009660>LC-MS/MS assay for the simultaneous determination of tocopherols, polyunsaturated fatty acids and their metabolites in human plasma and serum.</a></h2><p>The role of vitamin E in both enzymatic and free radical-dependent  of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) has been well demonstrated.

Clinically, GA is characterized by acute episodes of joint inflammation, which is most frequently encountered in the major joints, and also has a significant impact on quality of life. Pulchinenoside b4(P-b4) has a wide range of biological activities, including antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antiviral and immunomodulatory activities. Currently, the anti-GA activity and metabolomic profiles after being treated by P-b4 have not been reported. In this paper, for the first time, we have performed a non-targeted metabolomics analysis of serum obtained from an MSU crystal-induced GA rat model intervened by P-b4, using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry. In this study, the main pharmacodynamics of different dosing methods and dosages of P-b4 was firstly investigated. Results have shown that P-b4 possesses high anti-inflammatory activity.

The sequencing results and target mutation genes were analyzed and screened, respectively, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) signal pathway enrichment analysis was carried out. Finally, the expression of target genes was detected in 22 PNH (including seven cases with thrombus) and 20 normal controls, and the correlation between the expression of mRNA and the clinical thrombus-related indexes was analyzed.The mutation genes screened from 4 PNH with thrombus were BMPR2, F8, ITGA2B, THBD, and THBS1. The  enriched by these genes included Notch, Wnt, and   signaling , which may be related to the pathogenesis of thrombosis in PNH. The BMPR2, THBD, and THBS1 gene expression was significantly different between PNH with and without thrombus group, and the THBS1 gene expression was positively correlated with D-Dimer and su-PAR levels.Genetic defects have a non-negligible effect on the incidence of thrombosis, and therefore, gene mutations maybe a genetic risk factor in PNH, which increase the incidence of thrombosis.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946391>Effects of honey-extracted polyphenols on serum antioxidant capacity and  phenotype in rats.</a></h2><p>It is generally known that honey polyphenols have antioxidant capacity and numerous biological functions.

However, when uncontrolled, the overzealous response leads to tissue damage and malaise. Indeed, this process is now appreciated to be at the center of many chronic inflammatory diseases including vascular disease and arthritis. Studies investigating the mechanisms through which acute inflammation is actively turned off allowing tissues to regain function demonstrated that the essential fatty acids,  (AA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) are enzymatically converted to bioactive mediators. These autacoids carry distinct structures and biological actions, actively reprogramming the inflammatory reaction to promote its termination by counter-regulating the production of pro-inflammatory mediators and regulate leukocyte trafficking as well as phenotype. Recently we found that n-3 docosapentaenoic  (DPA), which was until then only regarded as a biosynthetic intermediate in the formation of DHA from EPA, is also converted to structurally distinct bioactive mediators that reprogram the host immune response.

We identified twenty-two articles from fourteen RCT. Most studies were conducted in adults. These used between 80 and 2000 mg ARA per d and were of 1-12 weeks duration. Supplementation with ARA doses as low as 80 mg/d increased the content of ARA in different blood fractions. Overall there seem to be few marked benefits for adults of increasing ARA intake from the typical usual intake of 100-200 mg/d to as much as 1000 mg/d; the few studies using higher doses (1500 or 2000 mg/d) also report little benefit. However, there may be an impact of ARA on cognitive and muscle function which could be particularly relevant in the ageing population. The studies reviewed here suggest no adverse effects in adults of increased ARA intake up to at least 1000-1500 mg/d on blood lipids, platelet aggregation and blood clotting, immune function, inflammation or urinary excretion of ARA metabolites. However, in many areas there are insufficient studies to make firm conclusions, and higher intakes of ARA are deserving of further study.

The flavonols were more active than the flavones against LDL oxidation, suggesting that hydroxyl group at C-3 and the catechol moiety at B-ring may play important roles in protecting LDL from oxidation. Most tested flavonoids showed stronger inhibition towards AA-induced than the ADP-induced platelet aggregation with apigenin exhibiting the strongest effect (IC 52.3 and 127.4 µM, respectively) while quercetin and kaempferol showed moderate activity.

However, the molecules that contribute to these changes remain largely unknown.We have investigated the impact of T. gondii infection on the overall  of mouse cerebral cortex. Mass-spectrometry-based metabolomics and multivariate statistical analysis were employed to discover metabolomic signatures that discriminate between cerebral cortex of T. gondii-infected and uninfected control mice.Our results identified 73, 67 and 276 differentially abundant metabolites, which were involved in 25, 37 and 64  at 7, 14 and 21 days post-infection (dpi), respectively. Metabolites in the unsaturated fatty  biosynthesis pathway were upregulated as the infection progressed, indicating that T. gondii induces the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids to promote its own growth and survival. Some of the downregulated metabolites were related to , such as steroid hormone biosynthesis and  . Nine metabolites were identified as T. gondii responsive metabolites, namely galactosylsphingosine, , LysoSM(d18:1), L-palmitoylcarnitine, calcitetrol, 27-Deoxy-5b-cyprinol, L-homophenylalanine, oleic  and ceramide (d18:1/16:0).Our data provide novel insight into the dysregulation of the  of the mouse cerebral cortex during T. gondii infection and have important implications for studies of T. gondii pathogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30930941>Genomic, Transcriptomic, and Epigenomic Features Differentiate Genes That Are Relevant for Muscular Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in the Common Carp.</a></h2><p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are a set of important nutrients that mainly include  (ARA4), docosahexaenoic  (DHA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and α-linolenic  (ALA). Recently, fish-derived PUFAs have been associated with cardiovascular health, fetal development, and improvement of brain functions. Studies have shown that fish muscular tissues are rich in PUFAs, which are influenced by various factors, including genetic variations, regulatory profiles, and methylation status of desaturase genes during fatty  desaturation and elongation processes. However, the genetic mechanism and the  involved in fatty   in fishes remain unclear. The overall aim of this study was to assess differences in gene expression responses among fishes with different fatty  levels. To achieve this goal, we conducted genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) using a 250K SNP array in a population of 203 samples of common carp () and identified nine SNPs and 15 genes associated with muscular PUFA content. Then, RNA-Seq and whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) of different groups with high and low EPA, DHA, ARA4, and ALA contents in muscle, liver and brain tissues were conducted, resulting in 6,750 differentially expressed genes and 5,631 genes with differentially methylated promoters. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses of RNA-Seq and WGBS results identified enriched  for fatty  , which included the adipocytokine signaling pathway, ARA4 and linoleic   pathway, and insulin signaling pathway. Integrated analysis indicated significant correlations between gene expression and methylation status among groups with high and low PUFA contents in muscular tissues. Taken together, these multi-level results uncovered candidate genes and  that are associated with fatty   and paved the way for further genomic selection and carp breeding for PUFA traits.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616913>Analysis of the Uterine Lumen in Fertility-Classified Heifers: I. Glucose, Prostaglandins and Lipids.</a></h2><p>Survival and growth of the bovine conceptus (embryo and associated extraembryonic membranes) is dependent on endometrial secretions or histotroph found in the uterine lumen. Previously, serial embryo transfer was used to classify heifers as high fertile (HF), subfertile (SF), or infertile (IF). Here, we investigated specific histotroph components (glucose, prostaglandins (PGs) and lipids) in the uterine lumen of day 17 pregnant and open fertility-classified heifers. Concentrations of glucose in the uterine lumen were increased by pregnancy, but did not differ among fertility-classified heifers. Differences in expression of genes encoding glucose transporters and involved with  and gluconeogenesis were observed between conceptuses collected from HF and SF heifers. In the uterine lumen, PGE2 and PGF2α were increased by pregnancy, and HF heifers had higher concentrations of PGE2, PGF2α and 6-keto-PFG1α than SF heifers. Differences were found in expression of genes regulating PG signaling,  metabolism, and PPAR signaling among conceptuses and endometrium from fertility-classified heifers. Lipidomics was conducted exclusively in samples from HF heifers, and phosphatidylcholine was the main lipid class that increased in the uterine lumen by pregnancy. Expression of several lipid metabolism genes differed between HF and SF conceptuses, and a number of fatty acids were differentially abundant in the uterine lumen of pregnant HF and SF heifers. These results support the ideas that uterine luminal histotroph impacts conceptus survival and programs its development and is a facet of dysregulated conceptus-endometrial interactions that result in loss of the conceptus in SF cattle during the implantation period of pregnancy establishment.© The Author(s) 2019.

Infants with specific genotypes may require different amounts of these fatty acids (FAs) to maintain an adequate status. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of an infant formula supplemented with AA and DHA on FAs of infants with different FADS genotypes. In total, 176 infants from the COGNIS study were randomly allocated to the Standard Formula (SF; n = 61) or the Experimental Formula (EF; n = 70) group, the latter supplemented with AA and DHA. Breastfed infants were added as a reference group (BF; n = 45). FAs and FADS polymorphisms were analyzed from cheek cells collected at 3 months of age. FADS minor allele carriership in formula fed infants, especially those supplemented, was associated with a declined desaturase activity and lower AA and DHA levels. Breastfed infants were not affected, possibly to the high content of AA and DHA in breast milk. The supplementation increased AA and DHA levels, but mostly in major allele carriers. In conclusion, infant FADS genotype could contribute to narrow the gap of AA and DHA concentrations between breastfed and formula fed infants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302749>Impact of 17β-HSD12, the 3-ketoacyl-CoA reductase of long-chain fatty  synthesis, on breast cancer cell proliferation and migration.</a></h2><p> reprogramming of tumor cells involves upregulation of fatty  (FA) synthesis to support high bioenergetic demands and membrane synthesis. This has been shown for cytosolic synthesis of FAs with up to 16 carbon atoms. Synthesis of long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs), including ω-6 and ω-3 polyunsaturated FAs, takes place at the endoplasmic reticulum. Despite increasing evidence for an important role of LCFAs in cancer, the impact of their synthesis in cancer cell growth has scarcely been studied. Here, we demonstrated that silencing of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 12 (17β-HSD12), essentially catalyzing the 3-ketoacyl-CoA reduction step in LCFA production, modulates proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells in a cell line-dependent manner. Increased proliferation and migration after 17β-HSD12 knockdown were partly mediated by  of  towards COX2 and CYP1B1-derived eicosanoids. Decreased proliferation was rescued by increased glucose concentration and was preceded by reduced ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation and spare respiratory capacity. In addition, 17β-HSD12 silencing was accompanied by alterations in unfolded protein response, including a decrease in CHOP expression and increase in eIF2α activation and the folding chaperone ERp44. Our study highlights the significance of LCFA biosynthesis for tumor cell physiology and unveils unknown aspects of breast cancer cell heterogeneity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597284>Anti-Platelet Properties of Phenolic Extracts from the Leaves and Twigs of  (L.)

However, there is no data on the effect of sea buckthorn leaves and twigs on the properties of blood platelets. The aim of the study was to analyze the biological activity of phenolic extracts from leaves and twigs of sea buckthorn in blood platelets in vitro. Two sets of extracts were used: (1) phenolic compounds from twigs and (2) phenolic compounds from leaves. Their biological effects on human blood platelets were studied by blood platelet adhesion, platelet aggregation,   and the generation of superoxide anion. Cytotoxicity was also evaluated against platelets. The action of extracts from sea buckthorn twigs and leaves was compared to activities of the phenolic extract (a commercial product from the berries of  (Aronox) with antioxidative and antiplatelet properties. This study is the first to demonstrate that extracts from sea buckthorn leaves and twigs are a source of bioactive compounds which may be used for the prophylaxis and treatment of cardiovascular pathologies associated with blood platelet hyperactivity. Both leaf and twig extracts were found to display anti-platelet activity in vitro.

The aim was to find out the potential biomarkers and possible blood enriching mechanism of steamed notoginseng on hemolytic anemia rats. In the experiment,steamed notoginseng medicine pair( steamed notoginseng-ginseng)and compound medicines( Sanqi Yangxue Capsules) were used respectively to intervene in APH-induced hemolytic anemia model rats.Then blood routine indexes such as red blood cells( RBC),hemoglobin( Hb) and related organ indexes were determined. As compared with the blank group,the RBC and Hb levels in the model group were substantially decreased( P< 0. 01),while the liver and spleen organ indexes were increased( P< 0. 05). The results of blood routine and organ index demonstrated that the blood deficiency model was successfully established. Steamed notoginseng can significantly increase the RBC level of rats( P<0. 01),and the related indicators of each drug group had a trend of returning to normal levels,verifying the blood enriching effect of steamed notoginseng. The UPLC-Q-TOF-MS technique,principal component analysis( PCA) and partial least squares-discrimination analysis( PLS-DA) were used to analyze the  profiles between the normal group and the model group. Twenty-six potential biomarkers for hemolytic anemia were screened in plasma. Nine metabolites such as retinol,L-valine,and  were down-regulated in the blood deficiency rats,and 17 metabolites such as protoporphyrin Ⅸ and niacinamide were up-regulated. The  level of biomarkers could be changed to a normal state after rats were given with steamed notoginseng,drug pairs,and compound prescriptions.

The aim of our present work was to investigate changes in the cardiac metabolome following relaxin-2 treatment.Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with human recombinant relaxin-2 using osmotic minipumps at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks. Body composition was measured with a nuclear magnetic resonance imaging system seven days after surgery and on the final day of the experiment. The last two days of treatment, respiratory quotient, locomotor activity and energy expenditure were measured with a calorimetric system. The plasma levels of relaxin-2, total cholesterol, high- and low- density lipoproteins (HDL, LDL), triglycerides and the hepatic enzymes glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GTP) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels were analyzed. The  profiling of both atria from relaxin-2-treated and control rats was carried out using two separate ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-Time of Flight-MS based platforms analyzing methanol and chloroform/methanol extracts combined with a UHPLC-single quadrupole-MS based platform used to analyze aminoacids and with a methanol/water extract platform that covered polar metabolites. Identified ion features in the methanol extract platform included fatty acids, acyl carnitines, bile acids, monoacylglycerophospholipids, monoetherglycerophospholipids, free sphingoid bases, and oxidized fatty acids. The chloroform / methanol extract platform provided coverage over glycerolipids, cholesterol esters, sphingolipids, diacylglycerophospholipids, and acyl-ether-glycerophospholipids. Gene expression levels of the adipokines adiponectin, leptin and nesfatin-1 in visceral adipose tissue and cardiac gene expression levels of key enzymes of desaturation and elongation of n-6 and n-3 PUFAs were assessed by Real Time-PCR.Twenty-eight metabolites out of three hundred sixty-two were significantly altered by human relaxin-2. These included fifteen glycerophospholipids: three phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) and twelve phosphatidylcholines (PC); eight sphingolipids: three ceramides (Cer) and five sphingomyelins (SM); and also five aminoacids and one carboxylic . Interestingly, the majority of changes correspond to lipid classes, twelve of them polyunsaturated diacylglycerophosphatidylcholines with long acyl chains, containing mainly docosahexaenoic  (22:6) and  (20:4). Atrial levels of Elovl5 (Elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 5), Fads1 (Δ5-fatty  desaturase) and Fads2 (Δ6-fatty  desaturase), key enzymes of elongation and desaturation of n-6 and n-3 PUFAs like  and DHA, respectively, were significantly increased by relaxin-2 treatment. Atrial tissues from rats treated with relaxin-2 showed a significant increase in the mRNA levels of Srebf1, a transcription factor that activates the gene expression of Elovl5, Fads1 and Fads2. The treatment with relaxin-2 significantly decreased the visceral fat mRNA expression levels of adiponectin, leptin and nesfatin-1, adipokines known to exert an important influence on the regulation of cardiovascular function.Serelaxin (human recombinant relaxin-2) treatment induces significant changes in cardiac major components of the membrane lipid bilayer such as glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids, known to have structural roles but also very relevant regulatory effects in cardiac function. Serelaxin induced also modifications in several aminoacids of high influence in cardiac energy  regulation. Our results highlight the need to further understand the role of relaxin-2 in the regulation of cardiac energy , in the context of the therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cardiometabolic pathologies as heart failure.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

It has been related to multiple toxicological effects, and it causes high cytotoxicity through oxidative stress. The present study aimed to investigate the potential effect of ACR toxicity administered at different concentrations (5, 10, and 20 mg/L), during 5 days, in order to evaluate the fatty  (FA) composition and redox state in the digestive gland of Mactra corallina. The results showed, in ACR-treated clams, a significant increase in malondialdehyde, hydrogen peroxide, protein carbonyl, and metallothionein levels, as well as an alteration of the enzymatic (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase) and non-enzymatic (reduced glutathione and ascorbic ) antioxidant status. However, acetylcholinesterase activity was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner. In our experiment, the n-3 (Omega-3) and n-6 (Omega-6) polyunsaturated fatty  levels were significantly changed in all ACR-treated groups. A decrease in eicosapentaenoic  (C20:5n-3, EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (C22:6n-3, DHA) was observed in 10-mg/L and 20-mg/L ACR-treated groups.

Several lines of evidence support a role for oxidative stress in atherogenesis and NADPH oxidase-2 (NOX-2) is considered a major source of O2 in human. Furthermore, oxidative stress regulates   via activation of platelet phospholipase-A2. The aim of this study was to address NOX-2 activity as well as serum thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and 8-isoPGF2-alpha in offspring of patients with premature myocardial infarction.Ninety-two consecutive subjects, including 46 offspring of patients with premature myocardial infarction and 46 healthy subjects (HS) matched for age and gender, were recruited. A cross sectional study was performed to compare serum activity of soluble NOX-2-dp (sNOX-2-dp), blood levels of isoprostanes and serum TXB2 in these two groups.Compared with HS, offspring of patients with early myocardial infarction had higher values of serum TxB2, isoprostanes and sNOX-2-dp. Bivariate analysis in the overall population showed that serum sNOX-2-dp levels were significantly associated with serum isoprostanes and TXB2. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to define the independent predictors of sNOX-2-dp. Serum isoprostanes (SE: 0.07; standardized coefficient β: 0.579; P < 0.001) and TXB2 levels (SE: 0.06; standardized coefficient β: 0.211; P < 0.001) were significantly associated to sNOX-2-dp (R2: 0.42).This study shows that Nox-2 activation is a key determinant of oxidative stress and platelet activation in offspring of patients with premature myocardial infarction.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Rhubarb, a preferred representative of cathartic TCM, is currently widely used that results in a diversity of its dosage. The aim of this study was to use an integrated metabolomics strategy to simultaneously reveal dose-effect relationship and therapeutic mechanisms of different efficacy of rhubarb in constipation rats. Six doses of rhubarb (0.135, 0.27, 0.81, 1.35, 4.05, and 8.1 g/kg) were examined to elucidate the laxative and fire-purging effects by pathological sections and UPLC-Q-TOF/MS. The results showed that there existed serious lesions in the stomach and colon of model rats. And conditions were basically improved to some extent in rhubarb-treated groups. Through relative distance calculation based on metabolomics score plots, it suggested that the effective dose threshold (EC-EC range) of rhubarb was from 0.31 to 4.5 g/kg (corresponding to 3.44-50.00 g in the clinic) in rat serum and 0.29-2.1 g/kg (corresponding to 3.22-23.33 g in the clinic) in feces. Then, 33 potential biomarkers were identified in total. Functional pathway analysis revealed that the alterations of these biomarkers were associated with 15  , mainly including  , glycerophospholipid , steroid biosynthesis, primary bile  biosynthesis and sphingolipid . Of note, different doses of rhubarb could alleviate endogenous disorders to varying degrees through regulating multiple perturbed  to the normal state, which might be in a dose-dependent manner and involved in therapeutic mechanisms. To sum up, integrated serum and fecal metabolomics obtained that rhubarb ranging from 0.31 to 2.1 g/kg is safe and effective for constipation treatment. Also, our findings showed that the robust metabolomics techniques would be promising to be more accurately used in the dose-effect studies of complex TCM, and to clarify syndrome pathogenesis and action mechanisms in Chinese medicine.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

These environmental shifts sometimes portend more severe changes; e.g., chilly north winds precede the onset of winter. Such telltale signs may be indicators for animals to prepare for such a shift. Here we show that HEK293A cells, cultured under starvation conditions, can "memorize" a short exposure to cold temperature (15 °C), which was evidenced by their higher survival rate compared to cells continuously grown at 37 °C. We refer to this phenomenon as "cold adaptation". The cold-exposed cells retained high ATP levels, and addition of etomoxir, a fatty  oxidation inhibitor, abrogated the enhanced cell survival. In our standard protocol, cold adaptation required linoleic  (LA) supplementation along with the activity of Δ-6-desaturase (D6D), a key enzyme in LA . Moreover, supplementation with the LA metabolite  (AA), which is a high-affinity agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARα), was able to underpin the cold adaptation, even in the presence of a D6D inhibitor. Cold exposure with added LA or AA prompted a surge in PPARα levels, followed by the induction of D6D expression; addition of a PPARα antagonist or a D6D inhibitor abrogated both their expression, and reduced cell survival to control levels. We also found that the brief cold exposure transiently prevents PPARα degradation by inhibiting the ubiquitin proteasome system, and starvation contributes to the enhancement of PPARα activity by inhibiting mTORC1. Our results reveal an innate adaptive positive-feedback mechanism with a PPARα-D6D-AA axis that is triggered by a brief cold exposure in cells.

These cells contribute to the failure of cancer therapies and are associated with poor clinical outcomes. Despite recent advances in the understanding of PMN-MDSC biology, the mechanisms responsible for the pathological activation of neutrophils are not well defined, and this limits the selective targeting of these cells. Here we report that mouse and human PMN-MDSCs exclusively upregulate fatty  transport protein 2 (FATP2). Overexpression of FATP2 in PMN-MDSCs was controlled by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, through the activation of the STAT5 transcription factor. Deletion of FATP2 abrogated the suppressive activity of PMN-MDSCs. The main mechanism of FATP2-mediated suppressive activity involved the uptake of  and the synthesis of prostaglandin E. The selective pharmacological inhibition of FATP2 abrogated the activity of PMN-MDSCs and substantially delayed tumour progression. In combination with checkpoint inhibitors, FATP2 inhibition blocked tumour progression in mice. Thus, FATP2 mediates the acquisition of immunosuppressive activity by PMN-MDSCs and represents a target to inhibit the functions of PMN-MDSCs selectively and to improve the efficiency of cancer therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31237701>The whole transcriptional profiling of cellular  during adipogenesis from hMSCs.</a></h2><p> homeostasis plays an important role in progenitor-cell differentiation to adipocytes, but less is known about the whole transcriptional profiling of cellular  during adipogenesis. We got the first insight into the whole transcriptional profiling of cellular  during adipogenesis from human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) by the RNA-Seq technique. There were 1,998, 2,629, 3,112, and 3,054 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at Days 7, 14, 21, and 28, respectively, during adipogenesis.

Vascular pain during intravenous L-OHP administration can be inhibited by taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In this study, we investigated the involvement of the  cascade and prostaglandin (PG) E and 15d-PGJ in vascular pain sensation during intravenous delivery of L-OHP.Cultured normal human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with L-OHP or L-OHP + NSAID flurbiprofen for 2 h and analyzed for the release of PGE and 15d-PGJ into culture supernatant by ELISA.The results showed that L-OHP significantly and dose-dependently increased PGE secretion by HUVECs; however, flurbiprofen effectively prevented PGE increase. On the other hand, cisplatin, another platinum anticancer drug, did not stimulate PGE production. Other PGs, including 15d-PGJ, 6-keto PGF, PGF, and PGD were not increased by L-OHP or cisplatin. Protein expression analysis revealed that cyclooxygenase 1 and cytoplasmic PGE synthase involved in constitutive PG  were expressed in HUVECs but not affected by L-OHP exposure.This study indicates that L-OHP treatment specifically upregulated PGE secretion by vascular endothelial cells, which may contribute to vascular pain, and that NSAIDs can be used to inhibit PGE release and attenuate L-OHP-induced hyperalgesia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062425>Toll/IMD signal  mediate cellular immune responses via induction of intracellular PLA  expression.</a></h2><p>Phospholipase A (PLA ) hydrolyzes fatty acids from phospholipids at the sn-2 position. Two intracellular PLA s, iPLA A and iPLA B, have been found in Spodoptera exigua. Both are calcium-independent cellular PLA . Their orthologs have been found in other insects. These two iPLA s are different in ankyrin motif of N terminal region. The objective of this study was to determine whether Toll/immune deficiency (IMD) signal  could mediate cellular immune responses via induction of iPLA expression. Both iPLA  s were expressed in all developmental stages of S. exigua, showing the highest expression in the adult stage. During larval stage, hemocyte is the main tissue showing expression of these iPLA s. Both iPLA s exhibited similar expression patterns after immune challenge with different microbial pathogens such as virus, bacteria, and fungi. Promoter component analysis of orthologs encoded in S. frugiperda indicated nuclear factor-κB- and Relish-responsible elements on their promoters, suggesting their expression in S. exigua under Toll/IMD immune signaling . RNA interference (RNAi) of MyD88 or Pelle under Toll pathway suppressed inducible expression levels of both iPLA s in response to Gram-positive bacteria containing Lys-type peptidoglycan or fungal infection. In contrast, RNAi against Relish under IMD pathway suppressed both iPLA s in response to infection with Gram-negative bacteria. Under RNAi conditions, hemocytes significantly lost cellular immune response measured by nodule formation. However, addition of  (a catalytic product of PLA ) rescued such immunosuppression. These results suggest that Toll/IMD signal  can mediate cellular immune responses via eicosanoid signaling by inducing iPLA expression.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063920>Maternal short and medium chain fatty acids supply during early pregnancy improves embryo survival through enhancing progesterone synthesis in rats.</a></h2><p>Exploring strategies to prevent miscarriage in women or early pregnancy loss in mammals is of great importance. Manipulating maternal lipid  to maintain sufficient progesterone level is an effective way. To investigated the embryo loss and progesterone synthesis impacts of short and medium chain fatty acids on the lipid , pregnancy outcome and embryo implantation were investigated in rats fed the pregnancy diets supplemented without or with 0.1% sodium butyrate (SB), 0.1% sodium hexanoate (SH), or 0.1% sodium caprylate (SC) during the entire pregnancy and early pregnancy, respectively, followed with evaluation of potential mechanisms. Maternal SB, SH, or SC supply significantly improved live litter size and embryo implantation in rats. Serum progesterone, , and phospholipid metabolites levels were significantly increased in response to maternal SB, SH, and SC supply. The expression of key genes involved in ovarian steroidogenesis and granulosa cell luteinization were elevated in ovaries and primary cultured granulosa cells, including cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), and cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A1). Additionally, the expression of lysophosphatidic  receptor 3 (LPA) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX) related with phospholipid  were enhanced in uterus in vivo and in in vitro cultured uterine tissue. In conclusion, maternal SB, SH and SC supply reduced early pregnancy loss through modulating maternal phospholipid  and ovarian progesterone synthesis in rats. Our results have important implications that short or medium chain fatty acids have the potential to prevent miscarriage in women or early pregnancy loss in mammals.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

We hypothesized, that alternations of AA  in human airway epithelial cells (ECs) - induced by Parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3) - may be modified by concomitant treatment with NSAIDs.Nasal (RPMI 2650) and bronchial (BEAS-2B) epithelial cells were cultured into confluence and then infected with PIV3. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (15-HETE) levels in cell supernatants were measured by ELISA and expression of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) and 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO) mRNA in cells was evaluated after reverse transcription with real-time polymerase chain reactions.PGE2 generation was decreased by PIV3 infection in the upper airway epithelial cells, and increased in the lower airway epithelial cells. Both naproxen and celecoxib induced significant reduction in PGE2 release in both infected and non-infected upper and lower airway epithelial cells. However, in PIV3-infected epithelial cells celecoxib inhibited PGE2 release and COX-2 expression to significantly higher degree as compared to non-infected cells. 15-HETE generation or COX-1, 5-LO and 15-LO expression were not affected by the virus infection or by NSAIDs.Virus infection in airway epithelial cells enhances inhibitory effect of NSAIDs on prostaglandin E2 generation.Copyright © 2019.

Eighty-four lambs blocked on liveweight were randomly allocated to four dietary treatments, lucerne pasture (Lucerne), annual ryegrass pasture (Ryegrass), feedlot pellets (Feedlot) or annual ryegrass plus feedlot pellets (RyeFeedlot). After six weeks of feeding, lambs were slaughtered and within 30 min post-mortem, samples collected from the  (LL) muscle for RNA isolation and measurement of antioxidant enzyme activities. At 24 h post-mortem, LL samples were collected for determination of fatty  concentrations. Feedlot treatment decreased ALA, eicosapentaenoic (EPA), docosapentaenoic (DPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) concentrations compared with other treatments and increased linoleic  (LA) and  (AA) compared with Lucerne and Ryegrass ( < 0.001). The activity of Glutathione peroxidase (GPX1,  < 0.001) and Superoxide dismutase (SOD2,  < 0.001) enzymes in the muscle increased with Lucerne compared to other treatments. Lucerne increased muscle  mRNA expression by 1.74-fold ( = 0.01) and 1.68-fold ( = 0.05) compared with Feedlot and other diets, respectively. The GPX1 (² = 0.319,  = 0.002) and SOD2 (² = 0.244,  = 0.009) enzyme activities were positively related to ALA. There was a positive linear relationship between muscle  (² = 0.102,  = 0.017) or  (² = 0.049,  = 0.09) mRNA expressions and ALA concentration.

Recent interest has focused on using microRNAs (miRNAs) as a novel treatment method for various cancers. miRNAs negatively regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally, and have become attractive candidates for cancer treatment because they often simultaneously target multiple genes of similar biological function. One such miRNA is miR-146a-5p, which has been described as a tumor suppressive miRNA in NSCLC cell lines and tissues. In this study, we performed RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis following transfection of synthetic miR-146a-5p in an NSCLC cell line, A549, and validated our data with Gene Ontology and qRT-PCR analysis of known miR-146a-5p target genes. Our transcriptomic data revealed that miR-146a-5p exerts its tumor suppressive function beyond previously reported targeting of EGFR and NF-κB signaling. miR-146a-5p mimic transfection downregulated   genes, the RNA-binding protein HuR, and many HuR-stabilized pro-cancer mRNAs, including TGF-β, HIF-1α, and various cyclins. miR-146a-5p transfection also reduced expression and cellular release of the chemokine CCL2, and this effect was mediated through the 3' untranslated region of its mRNA.

In general, all epoxy PUFAs including ω-3 epoxides are quickly metabolized/inactivated by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) to form diol products. The aims of this study were to determine the effect and mechanism of fat-1 transgene, and ω-3 PUFA combined with sEH gene knockout or inhibitor on inhibiting pancreatic cancer and the related mechanisms involved.PK03-mutant Kras murine pancreatic carcinoma cells were inoculated into mouse models including fat-1, sEH and C57BL/6J mice. The mice were fed with AIN-76A diet with or without ω-3 PUFA supplementation or treated with sEH inhibitor. In addition to tumor growth (tumor size and weight), cell proliferation, mutant Kras-mediated signaling, inflammatory reaction and angiogenesis were analyzed immunohisto-chemically and by western blot assay. ω-3 PUFA , particularly focusing on ω-3 epoxy fatty acids (ω-3 epoxides), was measured using a liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) approach.Significant decreases of weight and size of the PK03 pancreatic carcinoma were observed in the fat-1 transgenic mice treated with sEH inhibitor compared to those of C57BL/6J control mice fed with AIN-76A diet (weight: 0.28±0.04 g vs. 0.58±0.06 g; size: 187.0±17.5 mm vs. 519.3±60.6 mm). In a separate experiment, sEH mice fed ω-3 PUFA supplement and C57BL/6J mice treated with sEH inhibitor and fed ω-3 PUFA supplement exhibited a significant reduction in the weight and size of the pancreatic carcinoma compared to C57BL/6J control mice (weight: 0.26±.26 g and 0.39±.39 g vs. 0.69±0.11 g, respectively; size: 274.2±36.2 mm and 296.4±99.8 mm vs. 612.6±117.8 mm, respectively). Moreover, compared to the pancreatic tumors in C57BL/6J control mice, the tumors in fat-1 transgenic mice treated with sEH inhibitor showed a significant less inflammatory cell infiltrate (62.6±9.2/HPF (high power field) vs. 8.0±1.2/HPF), tumor cell proliferation (48.5±1.7% vs. 16.5±1.6%), and angiogenesis (micro-vessel density (MVD): 35.0±1.0 vs. 11.1±0.5) immunohistochemically, as well as significantly increased caspase-3 labeled apoptosis (0.44±0.06% vs. 0.69±0.06%, respectively). Using western blot approach, significant inhibition of mutant Kras-activated signals including phosphorylated Serine/threonine kinases (cRAF), Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were identified in pancreatic carcinoma of fat-1 transgenic mice treated with sEH inhibitor. Eicosanoic   profiling of the serum specimens detected a significant increase of the ratios of epoxides to dihydroxy fatty  (DiHDPE) for docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and epoxides/dihydroxy octadecenoic  (DiHOME) for  (ARA) and linoleic  (LA), as well as a significant increase of epoxy metabolites of DHA, EPA, ARA and LA in fat-1 transgenic mice treated with a sEH inhibitor.ω-3 epoxy products from ω-3 PUFA  play a crucial role in inhibiting pancreatic cancer growth, and use of ω-3 PUFAs combined with sEH inhibition is a strategy with high potential for pancreatic cancer treatment and prevention.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

It is believed that animals live longer at lower body temperatures. However, the precise mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we report that autophagy serves as a boost mechanism for longevity at low temperature in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The adiponectin receptor AdipoR2 homolog PAQR-2 signaling detects temperature drop and augments the biosynthesis of two ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, γ-linolenic  and . These two polyunsaturated fatty acids in turn initiate autophagy in the epidermis, delaying an age-dependent decline in collagen contents, and extending the lifespan. Our findings reveal that the adiponectin receptor PAQR-2 signaling acts as a regulator linking low temperature with autophagy to extend lifespan, and suggest that such a mechanism may be evolutionally conserved among diverse organisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31126500>Thermal stability and bioavailability of inclusion complexes of perilla oil with γ-cyclodextrin.</a></h2><p>Perilla oil is abundant in α-linolenic , which is metabolized to long-chain n-3 fatty acids. This study aimed to determine thermal stability and bioavailability of perilla oil that was powdered by inclusion complexation with γ-cyclodextrin. Fatty  analysis revealed that the relative abundance of α-linolenic and linoleic acids in the complexes was not affected by heating at 40 °C for six days but decreased after heating at 60 °C for three days. No adverse events occurred in rats fed with an experimental diet containing the complexes for two weeks. Plasma α-linolenic and eicosapentaenoic acids in rats fed with diets containing complexes and liquid perilla oil were equally high, indicating the preserved bioavailability of perilla oil in the complexes. Plasma  decreased only in rats fed with a diet containing the complexes. Results suggest that the complexes have potential as a useful source of α-linolenic  to increase plasma n-3 fatty acids.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this study is to compare erythrocyte membrane fatty  (FA) content between patients with PAD and controls. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 179 vascular surgery outpatients (controls, 34; PAD, 145). A blood sample was drawn and the erythrocyte FA content was assayed using capillary gas chromatography. We calculated the ratio of the n-3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) to the n-6 PUFA  (ARA) as well as the omega-3 index (O3I), a measure of erythrocyte content of the n-3 PUFA, EPA, and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), expressed as a percentage of total erythrocyte FA. Compared with controls, patients with PAD smoked more and were more likely to have hypertension and hyperlipidemia (p < 0.05). Patients with PAD had a lower mean O3I (5.0 ± 1.7% vs 6.0 ± 1.6%, p < 0.001) and EPA:ARA ratio (0.04 ± 0.02 vs 0.05 ± 0.05, p < 0.001), but greater mean total saturated fats (39.5 ± 2.5% vs 38.5 ± 2.6%, p = 0.01). After adjusting for several patient characteristics, comorbidities, and medications, an absolute decrease of 1% in the O3I was associated with 39% greater odds of PAD (odds ratio [OR] 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.86, and p = 0.03). PAD was associated with a deficiency of erythrocyte n-3 PUFA, a lower EPA:ARA ratio, and greater mean total saturated fats. These alterations in FA content may be involved in the pathogenesis or development of poor outcomes in PAD.© 2019 AOCS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200184>Lipid  and Calcium signaling in epithelial ovarian cancer.</a></h2><p>Epithelial Ovarian cancer (EOC) is the deadliest gynecologic malignancy and represents the fifth leading cause of all cancer-related deaths in women. The majority of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage of the disease that has spread beyond the ovaries to the peritoneum or to distant organs (stage FIGO III-IV) with a 5-year overall survival of about 29%. Consequently, it is necessary to understand the pathogenesis of this disease. Among the factors that contribute to cancer development, lipids and ion channels have been described to be associated to cancerous diseases particularly in breast, colorectal and prostate cancers. Here, we reviewed the literature data to determine how lipids or lipid metabolites may influence EOC risk or progression. We also highlighted the role and the expression of the calcium (Ca) and calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channels in EOC and how lipids might regulate them. Although lipids and some subclasses of nutritional lipids may be associated to EOC risk, lipid  of LPA (lysophosphatidic ) and AA () emerges as an important signaling network in EOC. Clinical data showed that they are found at high concentrations in EOC patients and in vitro and in vivo studies referred to them as triggers of the Caentry in the cancer cells inducing their proliferation, migration or drug resistance. The cross-talk between lipid mediators and Ca and/or KCa channels needs to be elucidated in EOC in order to facilitate the understanding of its outcomes and potentially suggest novel therapeutic strategies including treatment and prevention.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, a 66-yr-old female presented with nil requirement for postoperative analgesia after a normally painful orthopaedic hand surgery (trapeziectomy). Further investigations revealed a lifelong history of painless injuries, such as frequent cuts and burns, which were observed to heal quickly. We report the causative mutations for this new pain insensitivity disorder: the co-inheritance of (i) a microdeletion in dorsal root ganglia and brain-expressed pseudogene, FAAH-OUT, which we cloned from the fatty- amide hydrolase (FAAH) chromosomal region; and (ii) a common functional single-nucleotide polymorphism in FAAH conferring reduced expression and activity. Circulating concentrations of anandamide and related fatty- amides (palmitoylethanolamide and oleoylethanolamine) that are all normally degraded by FAAH were significantly elevated in peripheral blood compared with normal control carriers of the hypomorphic single-nucleotide polymorphism. The genetic findings and elevated circulating fatty- amides are consistent with a phenotype resulting from enhanced endocannabinoid signalling and a loss of function of FAAH. Our results highlight previously unknown complexity at the FAAH genomic locus involving the expression of FAAH-OUT, a novel pseudogene and long non-coding RNA. These data suggest new routes to develop FAAH-based analgesia by targeting of FAAH-OUT, which could significantly improve the treatment of postoperative pain and potentially chronic pain and anxiety disorders.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Metabolomic researches focused on global and dynamic changes of the organism could shed some light on mechanism investigation. In order to characterize and validate metabolite alterations of alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT) induced CLI in C57BL/6 mice, a systemic metabolomic approach combining nontargeted HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS and targeted UFLC-ESI-MS/MS technologies were developed innovatively. Multivariate data analysis was applied to determine the changes of metabolites in processed plasma and liver samples between control and model groups.

Based on correlation analysis, BA biosynthesis played the most important role in ANIT induced CLI, thereinto, major BAs were carried out with quantitative analysis. Targeted metabolomic results showed that the increase of BAs might have an impact on intestinal microbial ecology which could aggravate liver injury probably, among which cholic  (CA) and taurocholic  (TCA) were the most sensitive indicators of ANIT induced CLI in both plasma and liver.

(AA) is used for the main precursor for the production of various eicosanoids. However, most terrestrial insects possess relatively low AA levels. Insects are presumed to be evolved since the Paleozoic era, at which oxygen levels might be much higher than current conditions. Compared with other animals, they exhibit relatively high  rates with the well-developed tracheal system, which directly supply enough oxygen to active tissues like flight muscles. This might allow insects to be susceptible to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from high oxidative catabolism. Long-chain PUFAs including AA is usually reacted with ROS and become peroxidized. Peroxidized PUFAs cause various cellular damage.

Using an UPLC-MS/MS-based method, the concentration of selected eicosanoids was measured in cardiac effluents collected from isolated perfused mice hearts according to the Langendorff technique in Tgαq*44 and FVB mice (8- and 12-month-old) in basal conditions and in response to bolus injection of  (AA), a major substrate for eicosanoids. In basal conditions, only some eicosanoids were detected in the coronary effluents, with 6-keto-PGF, PGD, 12-HETE detected at the highest concentration. In response to AA, a wide range of its metabolites was detected, including not only prostanoids and HETEs, but also EETs and DHETs. Cardiac production of 6-keto-PGF, PGD, PGE, PGF, TXB in basal conditions was unchanged at the transition phase of HF, whereas it was increased at the end-stage of disease in Tgαq*44 mice as compared with age-matched FVB mice. In response to AA, the synthesis of PGE, 12-, 15-HETEs, 8,9-, 11,12-DHETs were also elevated at the end-stage phase of HF in Tgαq*44 mice as compared to healthy animals.

In conclusion, eicosanoid profiling in isolated perfused heart pointed to PGI, PGD and 12-HETE as the most abundant AA metabolites of the isolated murine heart. In Tgαq*44 mice, the end-stage phase of heart failure was accompanied by major activation of cyclooxygenase  (PGI, TXA, PGD, PGE, PGF), 8,9-, 11,12-EET/DHETs  and 12-, 15-HETEs  in the heart.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547875>Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis of molting-related proteins of Trichinella spiralis intestinal infective larvae.</a></h2><p>Molting is a key step for body-size expansion and environmental adaptation of parasitic nematodes, and it is extremely important for Trichinella spiralis growth and development, but the molting mechanism is not fully understood. In this work, label-free LC-MS/MS was used to determine the proteome differences between T. spiralis muscle larvae (ML) at the encapsulated stage and intestinal infective larvae (IIL) at the molting stage. The results showed that a total of 2885 T. spiralis proteins were identified, 323 of which were differentially expressed. These proteins were involved in cuticle structural elements, regulation of cuticle synthesis, remodeling and degradation, and hormonal regulation of molting. These differential proteins were also involved in diverse intracellular , such as fatty  biosynthesis,  , and mucin type O-glycan biosynthesis. qPCR results showed that five T. spiralis genes (cuticle collagen 14, putative DOMON domain-containing protein, glutamine synthetase, cathepsin F and NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase) had significantly higher transcriptional levels in 10 h IIL than ML (P < 0.05), which were similar to their protein expression levels, suggesting that they might be T. spiralis molting-related genes.

The enzymatic activity of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), the key enzyme in EET signaling, was selectively increased in the mPFC of susceptible mice after chronic social defeated stress and was negatively correlated with the social interaction ratio, which is an indicator of depressive-like behavior. The specific deletion of  (encode sEH) in adult astrocytes induced resilience to stress, whereas the impaired EET signaling in the mPFC evoked depressive-like behaviors in response to stress. sEH was mainly expressed on lysosomes of astrocytes. Using pharmacological and genetic approaches performed on C57BL/6J background adult male mice, we found that EET signaling modulated astrocytic ATP release  and  Moreover, astrocytic ATP release was required for the antidepressant-like effect of  deletion in adult astrocytes. In addition, sEH inhibitors produced rapid antidepressant-like effects in multiple animal models of depression, including chronic social defeated stress and chronic mild stress. Together, our results highlight that EET signaling in astrocytes in the mPFC is essential for behavioral adaptation in response to psychiatric stress. Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells of the brain, play a vital role in the pathophysiology of depression. Astrocytes secrete adenosine ATP, which modulates depressive-like behaviors. Notably, astrocytes are enriched for  . In the present study, we explored the hypothesis that epoxyeicosatrienoic  signaling, an   pathway, modulates astrocytic ATP release and the expression of depressive-like behaviors. Our work demonstrated that epoxyeicosatrienoic  signaling in astrocytes in the mPFC is essential for behavioral homeostatic adaptation in response to stress, and the extent of astrocyte functioning is greater than expected based on earlier reports.Copyright © 2019 the authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31039437>Reengineering lipid biosynthetic  of Aspergillus oryzae for enhanced production of γ-linolenic  and dihomo-γ-linolenic .</a></h2><p>Biological significance of 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids, γ-linolenic  (GLA; C18:3 n-6) and dihomo-γ-linolenic  (DGLA; C20:3 n-6) has gained much attention in the systematic development of optimized strains for industrial applications. In this work, a n-6 PUFAs-producing strain of Aspergillus oryzae was generated by manipulating  reactions in fatty  modification and triacylglycerol biosynthesis. The codon-optimized genes coding for Δ-desaturase and Δ-elongase of Pythium sp., and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (mMaDGAT2) of Mortierella alpina were co-transformed in a single vector into A. oryzae BCC14614, yielding strain TD6E6-DGAT2. Comparative phenotypic analysis showed that a 70% increase of lipid titer was found in the engineered strain, which was a result of a significant increase in triacylglycerol (TAG) content (52.0 ± 1.8% of total lipids), and corresponded to the increased size of lipid particles observed in the fungal cells. Interestingly, the proportions of GLA and DGLA in neutral lipids of the engineered strain were similar, with the highest titers obtained in the high C:N culture (29:0; 6% glucose) during the lipid-accumulating stage of growth. Time-course expression analysis of the engineered strain revealed transcriptional control of TAG biosynthesis through a co-operation between the native DGAT2 of A. oryzae and the transformed mMaDGAT2.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, an untargeted metabolomics approach was firstly applied to study the serum  differences in mice. Metabolomics analysis was performed using ultra performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS) together with multivariate statistical data analysis. The results showed that Plantaginis semen can mainly improve blood lipids, some degree in blood glucose and insulin levels in high-fat mice, in addition, the phenotype of liver and fat stained sections demonstrated remarkable results. A total of 22 metabolites involved in , glycerophospholipid, glycosphingolipid, linoleate, Omega-3 fatty , phosphatidylinositol phosphate and tyrosine metabolisms were identified.

We determined wall mechanics and vascular reactivity in ex vivo middle cerebral arteries (MCA) from male Goto-Kakizaki rats (GK; ~17 wk old) versus control Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) to test the hypothesis that the diabetic environment in GK, in the absence of obesity and other comorbidities, leads to endothelial dysfunction and impaired vascular tone regulation. Dilation of MCA following challenge with acetylcholine and hypoxia was blunted in MCA from GK versus WKY, due to lower nitric oxide bioavailability and altered  , whereas myogenic activation and constrictor responses to serotonin were unchanged. MCA wall distensibility and cross-sectional area were not different between GK and WKY, suggesting that wall mechanics were unchanged at this age, supported by the determination that MCA dilation to sodium nitroprusside was also intact. With the use of ex vivo aortic rings as a bioassay, altered vascular reactivity determined in MCA was paralleled by relaxation responses in artery segments from GK, whereas measurements of vasoactive metabolite production indicated a loss of nitric oxide and prostacyclin bioavailability and an increased thromboxane A production with both methacholine challenge and hypoxia. These results suggest that endothelium-dependent dilator reactivity of MCA in GK is impaired with T2DM, and that this impairment is associated with the genesis of a prooxidant/pro-inflammatory condition with diabetes mellitus. The restriction of vascular impairments to endothelial function only, at this age and development, provide insight into the severity of multimorbid conditions of which T2DM is only one constituent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31251486>Changes in Lipids During the Ovary Maturation Process of .</a></h2><p> is a large cold-water acorn barnacle distributed around the northern coast of the Pacific Ocean.

Knowledge of the physiology of  reproduction is important for the development of more efficient aquaculture methods. Previous studies have suggested that fatty acids and their metabolites play an important role in barnacle reproduction and development; however, few studies have analyzed lipids, particularly during ovary maturation. Here we analyzed lipid content, lipid class, and fatty  composition of  ovary throughout the year. The clutch in the present study was observed once per year at the end of November. The lipid content increased as the ovary underwent maturation. The proportion of triacylglycerol increased with increasing lipid content. The proportions of myristic , , EPA and DHA significantly decreased in December. By contrast, the proportion of these fatty acids in lipid extracted from larvae was high relative to lipid extracted from  ovary in December.

However, the effects of IA on colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CRC) and its mechanisms are still unknown.The study was designed to evaluate the effect of IA on CRC and explore its underlying mechanisms.The effect of IA on colitis related CRC were evaluated in azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mice and the underlying mechanisms were revealed by metabolomics, which were further validated in vivo and in vitro.The Balb/c mice were treated with AOM/DSS to induce CRC model and fed with normal diet with or without 0.02% IA. After the experimental period, samples of plasma were collected and analyzed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time off light mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF). Multivariate statistical tools were used to identify the changes of serum metabolites associated with CRC and responses to IA treatment. HT 29 and HCT 116 cells were stimulated by palmitate (PA) and cultured under hypoxia. Western blot, Q-PCR, and Immunofluorescence staining were performed to confirm the molecular pathway in vivo and in vitro.Our results showed IA significantly inhibited the inflammatory colitis symptoms such as disease activity index score, shortening of colon tissues and the increase of inflammatory cytokines. In metabolomic study, 31 potential metabolites associated with CRC were identified and 24 of them were reversed by IA treatment. Most of biomarkers were associated with  , glycerophospholipid catabolism, and phospholipid , suggesting lipid  might be involved in the beneficial effect of IA on CRC.

This pathological event is partly facilitated by the presence of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), including . The intracellular transport and  of LC-PUFAs are mediated by fatty -binding proteins (FABPs). We previously reported that heart-type FABP (FABP3) interacts with αSyn, thereby promoting αSyn oligomerization in DAergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) following 1-methyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treatment. This αSyn oligomerization is prevented in Fabp3 gene knock out mice. We document a novel FABP3 ligand, MF1 (4-(2-(1-(2-chlorophenyl)-5-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)phenoxy)butanoic ), that inhibits αSyn accumulation in DA neurons, thereby inhibiting the oligomerization of αSyn, loss of DAergic neurons, and PD-like motor deficits in MPTP-treated mice. Chronic oral administration of MF1 (0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg/day) significantly improved motor impairments and inhibited MPTP-induced accumulation and oligomerization of αSyn in the SNpc, and in turn prevented loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive cells in the SNpc. MF1 administration (0.1, 0.3, or 1.0 mg/kg/day) also restored MPTP-induced cognitive impairments. Although chronic administration of l-DOPA (3,4-dihydroxl-l-phenylalanine; 25 mg/kg/day, i.p.) also improved motor deficits, it failed to improve the cognitive impairments. In addition, l-DOPA failed to inhibit DAergic neuronal loss and αSyn pathologies in the SNpc.

This study aimed to determine the effect of AA on bone mass, quality, and adiposity in diet-induced obesity during growth. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=42, 4-week) were randomized into groups fed a control diet (CTRL, AIN-93G), high-fat diet (HFD, 35% kcal fat) or HFD + AA (1% w/w diet) for 6 weeks. Body composition, bone mineral density and microarchitecture were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and micro-computed tomography. Red blood cell fatty  profile was measured with gas chromatography. Group differences were evaluated using repeated measures two-way analysis of variance with Tukey-Kramer post hoc testing. Total energy intake did not differ among diet groups. At week 6, HFD + AA had significantly greater body fat % (12%), body weight (6%) and serum leptin concentrations (125%) than CTRL, whereas visceral fat (mass and %, assessed with micro-computed tomography) was increased in both HFD and HFD + AA groups. HFD + AA showed reduced whole body bone mineral content and femur mid-diaphyseal cortical bone cross-sectional area than HFD and CTRL, without impairment in bone strength. Contrarily, HFD + AA had greater femur metaphyseal trabecular vBMD (35%) and bone volume fraction (5%) compared to controls. Inclusion of AA elevated leptin concentrations in male rats.

Among them, 2560 proteins and 1701 metabolites were significantly up-regulated in testes, whereas 221 proteins and 992 metabolites were significantly up-regulated in ovaries. Venn diagram analysis showed 513 proteins were differentially regulated at both protein and metabolite levels. Correlation analysis of differentially-regulated proteins and metabolites were identified by Gene Ontology annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis. The results showed lipid  plays an important role in sex determination. The metabolites decanoyl-CoA, leukotriene, 3-dehydrosphinganine, and arachidonate were the biomarkers in testes, whereas estrone and taurocholate were the biomarkers in ovaries.

Systemic anti-inflammatory activity was determined from carrageenan and dextran-induced paw edema models and the animals were orally treated (p.o.) with EHFLR at doses of 25, 50, 100 mg/kg, indomethacin (10 mg/kg) for carrageenan-induced paw edema and promethazine (6 mg/kg) for dextran-induced paw edema. The possible mechanisms involved in the anti-inflammatory action of the extract were evaluated by the paw edema models induced by histamine and , and by the model of carrageenan-induced peritonitis, where vascular permeability and leukocyte migration to the peritoneal cavity were evaluated.The results of the HPLC identified the presence of phenolic acids and flavonoids, with chlorogenic  (1.16%) and Caempferol (0.81%) as the main constituents. From the results, it was concluded that the extract has an LD ≥5000 mg/kg when administered orally in mice as this dose did not trigger deaths in any of the observed groups. EHFLR (25 mg/kg) showed a significant antiderematogenic effect on histamine and -induced paw edema at the third hour of the tests, with a percentage of inhibition of 46.64% and 18.33%, respectively. The extract (25 mg/kg, p.o.) also significantly reduced vascular permeability and leukocyte migration in the peritoneal cavity.It is concluded that EHFLR exerts a systemic anti-inflammatory action, which seems to depend, at least in part, on the inhibition of   and the action of vasoactive amines. In addition, the extract reduced the leukocyte migration in the peritoneal cavity, indicating that its action may be linked to the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we observed a disorder in the cyclooxygenase-2/cytochrome P450 (COX-2/CYP)  of ARA in the lungs of PF mice induced by bleomycin (BLM). Therefore, we aimed to explore the role of COX-2/CYP-derived ARA  disorders in PF.

Although it has been shown that MBOAT7 is associated to membranes, the MBOAT7 topology remains unknown. To solve the topological organization of MBOAT7, we performed: A) solubilization of the total membrane fraction of cells overexpressing the recombinant MBOAT7-V5, which revealed MBOAT7 is an integral protein strongly attached to endomembranes; B) in silico analysis by using 22 computational methods, which predicted the number and localization of transmembrane domains of MBOAT7 with a range between 5 and 12; C) in vitro analysis of living cells transfected with GFP-tagged MBOAT7 full length and truncated forms, using a combination of Western Blotting, co-immunofluorescence and Fluorescence Protease Protection (FPP) assay; D) in vitro analysis of living cells transfected with FLAG-tagged MBOAT7 full length forms, using a combination of Western Blotting, selective membrane permeabilization followed by indirect immunofluorescence. All together, these data revealed that MBOAT7 is a multispanning transmembrane protein with six transmembrane domains. Based on our model, the predicted catalytic dyad of the protein, composed of the conserved asparagine in position 321 (Asn-321) and the preserved histidine in position 356 (His-356), has a lumenal localization.

Exposure to fluoride during the development affects  and physiology of neurons and glia which results in the impairment of cognitive functions but the exact mechanisms of fluoride neurotoxicity are not clearly defined.The aim of this study was to determine whether exposure to fluoride during the development affects COXes activity and the synthesis of prostanoids.Pre- and postnatal toxicity model in Wistar rats was used. Experimental animals received 50 mg/L of NaF in drinking water ad libitum, while control animals received tap water.

In the N1 group, 185 DEGs were generated and enriched in six Gene Ontology (GO) terms, including oxidoreductase activity, heme binding, tetrapyrrole binding, iron ion binding, metal binding and cation binding. The DEGs in the N1 group were also enriched in two Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) , e.g.,   and ovarian steroidogenesis. In the N7 group, 81 DEGs were generated without any GO enrichment but were enriched in five KEGG , including protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, protein export, prion diseases, thyroid hormone synthesis and  . This suggested that nitrite exposure might cause adverse effects to the clams in several aspects, including oxidative damage, depressed immunity, and disorders in cell proliferation, hormone  and tissue regeneration. Evaluation of oxidative stress indicated that nitrite exposure actually induced redox state imbalance by enhancing the contents of thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARSs) and glutathione (GSH), and the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) but not superoxide dismutase (SOD). These results will provide valuable gene references for further study on the toxicology mechanism of bivalves under environmental nitrite stress.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

PUFAs are constitutive elements of membrane architecture and precursors of lipid signaling molecules. EFAs and long-chain (LC)-PUFAs are precursors in the synthesis of endocannabinoid ligands of G protein-coupled cannabinoid receptor (CB)1 and CB2 in the endocannabinoid system, which critically regulate energy homeostasis as the  signaling system in hypothalamic neuronal circuits and behavioral parameters. We utilized the auxotrophic fatty  desaturase 2-deficient ( ) mouse, deficient in LC-PUFA synthesis, to follow the age-dependent dynamics of the PUFA pattern in the CNS-phospholipidome in unbiased dietary studies of three cohorts on sustained LC-PUFA-free ω6-- and DHA-supplemented diets and their impact on the precursor pool of CB1 ligands. We discovered the transformation of eicosa-all -5,11,14-trienoic , uncommon in mammalian lipidomes, into two novel endocannabinoids, 20:3-ethanolamide and 2-20:3-glycerol. Their function as ligands of CB1 has been characterized in HEK293 cells. Labeling experiments excluded Δ8-desaturase activity and proved the position specificity of FADS2. The   mutant might serve as an unbiased model in vivo in the development of novel CB1 agonists and antagonists.Copyright © 2019 Hammels et al.

A total of 80 C57BL/6J Narl mice were randomly divided into five groups: 3-month-old group, 9-month-old group, 14-month-old group, 20-month-old group, and FTZ treatment group (20 months old). The mice in the treatment group received a therapeutic dose of oral FTZ extract (1.0 g/kg, on raw material weight basis) once daily during the experiment. The other groups received the corresponding volume of oral normal saline solution. Liver samples of all five groups were collected after 12 weeks, and UPLC-Q-TOF/MS was used to analyze  changes. Orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was used to analyze the resulting data. Additionally, cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), secretion levels of TNF-α, IL-6, 5-LOX, and COX-2, as well as their relative mRNA expression in the liver were determined.  The levels of TC, TG, AST, and ALT were increased, and liver tissue structure was damaged. The secretion levels of TNF-α, IL-6, 5-LOX, and COX-2, as well as their relative mRNA expression in the liver also increased with aging. FTZ administration reduced the symptoms of liver aging. The OPLS-DA score plot illustrated the effect of FTZ against liver aging, with N-acetyl-leukotriene E4, 20-hydroxy-leukotriene E4, leukotriene E4, and  among the key biomarkers. The pivotal  revealed by pathway analysis included   and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. The mechanism by which FTZ reduces the symptoms of liver aging in mice might be related to disorders of the abovementioned .  A metabolomic approach based on UPLC-Q-TOF/MS and multivariate statistical analysis was successfully applied to investigate the  trajectory of liver aging. FTZ has a protective effect against liver aging, which may be mediated  interference with the  of , biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, and downregulation of pro-inflammatory factors in the liver in mice .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635131>Impact of High Salt Diet on Cerebral Vascular Function and Stroke in C57BL/6N Knockout and WT (C57BL/6N) Control Mice.</a></h2><p>High salt (HS) dietary intake leads to impaired vascular endothelium-dependent responses to various physiological stimuli, some of which are mediated by  (AA) metabolites. Transgenic  gene knockout mice (C57BL/6N) have changes in lipid  which may affect vascular function and outcomes of stroke. We aimed to study the effects of one week of HS diet (4% NaCl) on vascular function and stroke induced by transient occlusion of middle cerebral artery in  and wild type (WT/C57BL/6N) mice. Flow-induced dilation (FID) of carotid artery was reduced in WT-HS mice, but not affected in HS mice. Nitric oxide (NO) mediated FID. NO production was decreased with HS diet. On the contrary, acetylcholine-induced dilation was significantly decreased in  mice on both diets and WT-HS mice. HS intake and  gene depletion affected the structural components of the vessels. Proteomic analysis revealed a significant effect of  gene deficiency on HS diet-induced changes in neuronal structural proteins and acute innate immune response proteins' expression and  depletion, but HS diet did not increase the stroke volume, which is related to proteome modification and upregulation of genes involved mainly in cellular antioxidative defense. In conclusion,  depletion seems to partially impair vascular function and worsen the outcomes of stroke, which is moderately affected by HS diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31105530>Fatty  Signaling Mechanisms in Neural Cells: Fatty  Receptors.</a></h2><p>Fatty acids (FAs) are typically associated with structural and  roles, as they can be stored as triglycerides, degraded by β-oxidation or used in phospholipids' synthesis, the main components of biological membranes. It has been shown that these lipids exhibit also regulatory functions in different cell types. FAs can serve as secondary messengers, as well as modulators of enzymatic activities and substrates for cytokines synthesis. More recently, it has been documented a direct activity of free FAs as ligands of membrane, cytosolic, and nuclear receptors, and cumulative evidence has emerged, demonstrating its participation in a wide range of physiological and pathological conditions. It has been long known that the central nervous system is enriched with poly-unsaturated FAs, such as  (C20:4ω-6) or docosohexaenoic (C22:6ω-3) acids. These lipids participate in the regulation of membrane fluidity, axonal growth, development, memory, and inflammatory response. Furthermore, a whole family of low molecular weight compounds derived from FAs has also gained special attention as the natural ligands for cannabinoid receptors or key cytokines involved in inflammation, largely expanding the role of FAs as precursors of signaling molecules. Nutritional deficiencies, and alterations in lipid  and lipid signaling have been associated with developmental and cognitive problems, as well as with neurodegenerative diseases. The molecular mechanism behind these effects still remains elusive. But in the last two decades, different families of proteins have been characterized as receptors mediating FAs signaling. This review focuses on different receptors sensing and transducing free FAs signals in neural cells: (1) membrane receptors of the family of G Protein Coupled Receptors known as Free Fatty  Receptors (FFARs); (2) cytosolic transport Fatty -Binding Proteins (FABPs); and (3) transcription factors Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors (PPARs). We discuss how these proteins modulate and mediate direct regulatory functions of free FAs in neural cells. Finally, we briefly discuss the advantages of evaluating them as potential targets for drug design in order to manipulate lipid signaling. A thorough characterization of lipid receptors of the nervous system could provide a framework for a better understanding of their roles in neurophysiology and, potentially, help for the development of novel drugs against aging and neurodegenerative processes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880051>Effect of Cu and Zn ions on human serum albumin interaction with plasma unsaturated fatty acids.</a></h2><p>Human serum albumin (HSA) serves as a depot and carrier of multiple unrelated ligands including several participants of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), such as amyloid β peptide (Aβ), Zn/Cu ions, docosahexaenoic (DHA), linoleic (LA), and oleic (OA) acids. To explore the interplay between HSA interaction with Zn/Cu and the plasma unsaturated fatty acids (DHA, LA, OA, and  (ArA)), we have studied the metal dependence of the fatty  (FA) binding capacity of HSA (n) and structural consequences of the HSA-FA interactions. HSA loading with Zn decreases n value by 0.3-1.5, while its saturation with Cu causes the FA-dependent n changes by up to 0.9. The Cu-induced decline in n value for DHA is due to conformational rearrangements in HSA molecule. In other cases, the changes in n are attributed to steric hindarance/facilitation of the HSA-FA interaction because of the protein multimerization/monomerization, as confirmed by chemical crosslinking. The surface hydrophobicity of HSA is Cu-, Zn-, and FA-dependent and decreases upon the FA binding, according to bis-ANS fluorescence data. Overall, Zn or Cu binding selectively affect HSA interaction with the FAs studied, in part due to changes in quaternary structure of the protein.Copyright © 2019.

Anaemia disease-related protein target and compound of DBT databases were constructed. The TCMSP, ChemMapper and STITCH databases were used to predict the protein targets of DBT. Using the Cytoscape 3.2.1 to establish a phytochemical component-target protein interaction network and establish a component, protein and hub metabolite protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and merging the three PPI  basing on BisoGenet. The gene enrichment analysis was used to analyse the relationship between proteins based on the relevant genetic similarity by ClueGO. The results shown DBT effectively treated anaemia in vivo. 11   are involved in the therapeutic effect of DBT in vivo; S-adenosyl-l-methionine, glycine, l-cysteine,  (AA) and phosphatidylcholine(PC) were screened as hub metabolites in APH-and CTX-induced anaemia. A total of 288 targets were identified as major candidates for anaemia progression. The gene-set enrichment analysis revealed that the targets are involved in iron ion binding, haemopoiesis, reactive oxygen species production, inflammation and apoptosis. The results also showed that these targets were associated with iron ion binding, haemopoiesis, ROS production, apoptosis, inflammation and related signalling . DBT can promote iron ion binding and haemopoiesis activities, restrain inflammation, production of reactive oxygen, block apoptosis, and contribute significantly to the DBT treat anaemia.Copyright © 2019 China Pharmaceutical University.

Based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we analyzed serum  profiles of offspring rats before and after birth in IUGR model induced by prenatal caffeine exposure (PCE). We discovered that differential metabolites in PCE fetuses mainly manifested as amino acids and lipid . In adulthood, PCE offspring showed less and inconsistent types of differential metabolites compared to those in utero, which still exhibited gender differences. The main differential metabolites induced by PCE, including phospholipids, platelet-activating factor, , bile , sphingosine-1-phosphoric , indoxyl sulfuric , and cortexolone, may participate in the pathological and physiological processes of organ toxicities.

Forty NMRI female mice were divided into control (mated with intact male) and seminal vesicle excised (SVX)-mated (mated with SVX-male) groups. The phospholipid fatty acids composition was monitored during the fi rst fi ve days of pregnancy using gas chromatography and also implantation rate was evaluated on fi fth day of pregnancy.We found that levels of linoleic  (LNA) and  (ARA) showed a decreasing trend from the fi rst to the third day of pregnancy and then started to increase on the fourth day and peaked on the fi fth day. In contrast, the level of saturated FA (SFA) increased on the second and third day of pregnancy compared to the fi rst (p<0.05) and then decreased on the fourth and fi fth. We also found that the seminal vesicle secretion could affect the levels of LNA, ARA, SFA, and PUFA in uterine phospholipids especially on second and third day. Moreover, there was a positive correlation between ARA level and implantation rate in control but not SVX-mated groups.It can be concluded that several uterus FA that have important roles in early pregnancy could be affected by seminal vesicle secretion.Copyright® by the International Brazilian Journal of Urology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31125596>Mass spectrometry-based urinary metabolomics for the investigation on the mechanism of action of Eleutherococcus senticosus (Rupr. & Maxim.)

However, both arthritis and many NSAIDs increase cardiovascular (CV) risks. The dose-dependency of the elevated CV risks of NSAIDs has not been well-studied. We tested the hypothesis that low but still effective doses of these drugs are void of CV side effects. As the model drug, we chose diclofenac because of its known high CV toxicity, as markers of CV risks, we assessed concentrations of cytochrome P450-mediated metabolites of  (ArA), and we used adjuvant arthritis as an experimental model of arthritis. Following 7 daily doses (2.5-15 mg/kg), the effective dosage range of diclofenac was identified (> 5 mg/kg/day). While 7 consecutive days of low therapeutic doses did not alter the CYP-mediated ArA , the highest dose of 15 mg/kg/day caused imbalances in ArA  profiles toward cardiotoxicity by increasing the ratio of cardiotoxic 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  over cardioprotective epoxyeicosatrienoic acids.

We aimed to explore the role of MGL in the development of cholestatic liver and bile duct injury in mouse models of sclerosing cholangitis (SC), a disease so far lacking effective pharmacological therapy. To this aim we analyzed the effects of 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) feeding to induce SC in wild type (WT) and knockout (MGL ) mice and tested pharmacological inhibition with JZL184 in the Mdr2 mouse model of SC. Cholestatic liver injury and fibrosis were assessed by serum biochemistry, liver histology, gene expression and western blot characterization of BA and FA synthesis/transport. Moreover, intestinal FAs and fecal microbiome were analyzed. Transfection and silencing were performed in Caco2 cells. MGL mice were protected from DDC-induced biliary fibrosis and inflammation with reduced serum liver enzymes, increased FA/BA  and β-oxidation. Notably, pharmacological (JZL184) inhibition of MGL ameliorated cholestatic injury in DDC-fed WT mice and protected Mdr2 from spontaneous liver injury, with improved liver enzymes, inflammation and biliary fibrosis. In vitro experiments confirmed that silencing of MGL decreases prostaglandin E2 accumulation in the intestine upregulating peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) -α and -γ activity, thus reducing inflammation. Conclusions: Collectively, our study unravels MGL as a novel  target, demonstrating that MGL inhibition may be considered as potential therapy for SC.© 2019 The Authors.

We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization study to explore these relationships.Summary-level data from up to 426 824 individuals in UK Biobank for estimated bone mineral density (eBMD) derived from heel quantitative ultrasound and bone fractures were used in this study. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with plasma phospholipid FA levels at genome-wide significance were exploited as instrumental variables. Analyses were conducted using the inverse-variance weighted method.Eight of ten FAs were associated with eBMD and fracture risk. Specifically, genetic predisposition to higher plasma α-linolenic , linoleic , palmitoleic , and oleic  levels was positively associated with eBMD and inversely associated with the odds of fracture, whereas the opposite directions were observed for plasma , eicosapentaenoic , docosapentanenoic , and stearic  levels. Most of the associations were driven by single-nucleotide polymorphisms within or nearby the FADS1 and FADS2 genes, which explained the largest proportion of variance in FA levels. The associations of  and palmitoleic  with eBMD remained after exclusion of the variants in the FADS1-FADS2 gene regions. FADS encodes fatty  desaturases, which have a major role in FA .Genetic variations in plasma levels of several FAs were associated with eBMD and fracture risk.

We conducted a randomized, double-blinded study in current heavy smokers to compare modulating effects of intermittent versus continuous low-dose ASA on nasal epithelium gene expression and  (ARA) . Fifty-four participants were randomized to intermittent (ASA 81 mg daily for one week/placebo for one week) or continuous (ASA 81 mg daily) for 12 weeks. Low-dose ASA suppressed urinary prostaglandin E2 metabolite (PGEM; change of -4.55 ± 11.52 from baseline 15.44 ± 13.79 ng/mg creatinine for arms combined,  = 0.02), a surrogate of COX-mediated ARA , but had minimal effects on nasal gene expression of nasal or bronchial gene-expression signatures associated with smoking, lung cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Suppression of urinary PGEM correlated with favorable changes in a smoking-associated gene signature ( < 0.01). Gene set enrichment analysis (GESA) showed that ASA intervention led to 1,079 enriched gene sets from the Canonical  within the Molecular Signatures Database. In conclusion, low-dose ASA had minimal effects on known carcinogenesis gene signatures in nasal epithelium of current smokers but results in wide-ranging genomic changes in the nasal epithelium, demonstrating utility of nasal brushings as a surrogate to measure gene-expression responses to chemoprevention. PGEM may serve as a marker for smoking-associated gene-expression changes and systemic inflammation.

However, the therapeutic mechanism has yet not be clearly elucidated.This study was designed to investigate the protective activity of the extract of WP in a high-molecular-weight dextran-induced blood hyperviscosity rat model, and to explore the role of WP in improving blood hyperviscosity related  disorders and to clarify the possible mechanism of  regulation.The hemorheological parameters were measured with an automated blood rheology analyzer. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used to observe the pathological changes in aortic tissues samples. Further, a liquid chromatography-mass-spectrometry (LC-MS)-based untargeted metabolomics approach was applied to characterize the  alterations.WP has evident attenuating effects on blood hyperviscosity and related  disorders, and the influences are distinct from those of aspirin. The results showed that WP had good effects in reducing blood viscosity and ameliorating histopathological changes in the thoracic aorta in a high molecular weight dextran-induced blood hyperviscosity rat model. The middle dose (2.5 g raw material/kg body weight) of WP exhibited effects equivalent to aspirin (100 mg/kg) on hemorheological and histopathological parameters (P > 0.05). However, when using metabolomics profiling, we found that WP could significantly improve blood hyperviscosity-related  disorders and restore metabolites to normal levels; while aspirin showed little effect. With principal component analysis and orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis, WP regulated many more endogenous metabolites than aspirin. With pathway enrichment analysis, the differential endogenous metabolites were involved in cysteine and methionine , TCA cycle,  , etc., highlighting the  reprogramming potential of WP against blood hyperviscosity-induced  disorders.The study suggest that WP has a more potent effect, but a different mechanism, than aspirin in improving either blood hyperviscosity or related  disorders associated with cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Bioactive agents such as acetylsalicylic  (ASA) and vitamin E (vE) may affect enzyme activities and could be used in poultry production to control the magnitude of acute phase inflammation. Here, we characterized COX, LOX, and CYP450 mRNA expression levels in chicken immune tissues in response to Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge and investigated whether ASA and vE could alter gene expression. Additionally, for the first time in chickens, we evaluated oxygen consumption by platelet mitochondria as a biomarker of mitochondria function in response to ASA- and vE. LPS challenge compromised bird growth rates, but neither dietary ASA nor vE significantly ameliorated this effect; however, gradually increasing dietary vE levels were more effective than basal levels. ASA regulated  , providing an eicosanoid synthesis substrate, whereas gradually increasing vE levels evoked aspirin resistance during challenge. Gene expression in immune tissues was highly variable, indicating a complex regulatory network controlling inflammatory . However, unlike COX-1, COX-2 and CYP450 exhibited increased mRNA expression in some cases, suggesting an initiation of novel anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving signals during challenge. Measuring oxygen consumption rate, we revealed that neither the ASA nor vE levels applied here exerted toxic effects on platelet mitochondria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31241743>A Genome-Wide Functional Genomics Approach Identifies Susceptibility  to Fungal Bloodstream Infection in Humans.</a></h2><p>Candidemia, one of the most common causes of fungal bloodstream infection, leads to mortality rates up to 40% in affected patients. Understanding genetic mechanisms for differential susceptibility to candidemia may aid in designing host-directed therapies.We performed the first genome-wide association study on candidemia, and we integrated these data with variants that affect cytokines in different cellular systems stimulated with Candida albicans.We observed strong association between candidemia and a variant, rs8028958, that significantly affects the expression levels of PLA2G4B in blood. We found that up to 35% of the susceptibility loci affect in vitro cytokine production in response to Candida. Furthermore, potential causal genes located within these loci are enriched for lipid and  . Using an independent cohort, we also showed that the numbers of risk alleles at these loci are negatively correlated with reactive oxygen species and interleukin-6 levels in response to Candida. Finally, there was a significant correlation between susceptibility and allelic scores based on 16 independent candidemia-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms that affect monocyte-derived cytokines, but not with T cell-derived cytokines.Our results prioritize the disturbed lipid homeostasis and oxidative stress as potential mechanisms that affect monocyte-derived cytokines to influence susceptibility to candidemia.© The Author(s) 2019.

The canonical pathway for the synthesis of oxidized phospholipids is through the release of  by cytosolic phospholipase Aα (cPLAα) followed by its enzymatic oxidation, activation of the carboxylate anion by acyl-CoA synthetase(s), and re-esterification to the -2 position by -2 acyltransferase activity ( the Lands cycle). However, recent studies have demonstrated the unanticipated significance of -1 hydrolysis of arachidonoyl-containing choline and ethanolamine glycerophospholipids by other phospholipases to generate the corresponding 2-arachidonoyl-lysolipids. Herein, we identified a pathway for oxidized phospholipid synthesis comprising sequential -1 hydrolysis by a phospholipase A ( by patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 8 (PNPLA8)), direct enzymatic oxidation of the resultant 2-arachidonoyl-lysophospholipids, and the esterification of oxidized 2-arachidonoyl-lysophospholipids by acyl-CoA-dependent -1 acyltransferase(s). To circumvent ambiguities associated with acyl migration or hydrolysis, we developed a synthesis for optically active (d- and l-enantiomers) nonhydrolyzable analogs of 2-arachidonoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine (2-AA-LPC). -1 acyltransferase activity in murine liver microsomes stereospecifically and preferentially utilized the naturally occurring l-enantiomer of the ether analog of lysophosphatidylcholine. Next, we demonstrated the high selectivity of the -1 acyltransferase activity for saturated acyl-CoA species. Importantly, we established that 2-15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (HETE) ether-LPC -1 esterification is markedly activated by thrombin treatment of murine platelets to generate oxidized PC. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the enantiomeric specificity and saturated acyl-CoA selectivity of microsomal -1 acyltransferase(s) and reveal its participation in a previously uncharacterized pathway for the synthesis of oxidized phospholipids with cell-signaling properties.© 2019 Liu et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31376663>Metabolomic changes and polyunsaturated fatty  biosynthesis during gonadal growth and development in the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus intermedius.</a></h2><p>Strongylocentrotus intermedius is an important commercial species of sea urchin distributed in the coastal waters of China. However, the metabolomic changes that accompany its gonadal growth and development stages remain unclear. In this study, we have histologically observed gonad growth stages, analyzed the fatty  composition, and employed an untargeted metabolomic approach to investigate the metabolites associated with the gonadal growth and development of S. intermedius, as well as the biosynthesis and  of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) at different stages and in different sexes. The gonad mass of sea urchin increased from 0.70 ± 0.18 g in January (at the recovering stage) to 8.78 ± 2.89 g in July (the reproductive stage), with the GSI increasing from 4.02 ± 0.88% to 16.86 ± 2.79%. We have analyzed 34 types of fatty acids, such as , eicosapentaenoic , etc., of which PUFAs were the dominant fatty  class in this species, accounting for >48.55% of the total. In the metabolomic analysis, linolelaidic , sciadonic , cis-8,11,14,17-eicosatetraenoic , adrenic , docosapentaenoic , and tetracosapentaenoic  were detected in the differentially expressed metabolites of the unsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis pathway. We found that the most significant functional  during gonadal growth and development were " ", "alpha-linolenic  " and "linoleic  ", which are all related to fatty  . These results will provide valuable information on the possible presence of both exogenous and endogenous fatty acids in sea urchin gonads and the metabolomic changes in S. intermedius during gonadal growth periods, and will further our understanding of the intermediary  and the molecular bases of growth traits in this species.Copyright © 2019.

We previously reported that diesel engine exhaust (DE) could lead to structural changes in the placenta of in utero exposed rabbits (first generation, F1). The effects of maternal exposure to DE were further studied on second-generation (F2) rabbits. Pregnant F0 females were exposed to filtered, diluted DE (1 mg/m, median particle diameter: 69 nm) or clean filtered air (controls) for 2 h/day, 5 days/week by nose-only exposure during days 3-27 post-conception (dpc). Adult female offspring (F1) were mated to control males: F1 tissues and F2 foeto-placental units were collected at 28 dpc and placental structure and gene expression (microarray) analysed. Fatty  profiles were determined in foetal and maternal plasma, maternal liver and placenta. In F1, compared to controls, hepatic neutral lipid contents were increased in exposed animals without change in the blood biochemistry. In F2, the placental lipid contents were higher, with higher monounsaturated fatty acids and reduced pro-inflammatory  (AA), without placental structural changes. Conversely, the proportion of anti-inflammatory n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in F2 plasma was increased while that of AA was decreased. Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) of F2 placenta transcriptomic data identified that the proteasome complex and ubiquitin  genes were over-represented and ion channel function and inflammation  genes were under-represented in exposed animals. These preliminary results demonstrate that diesel engine exhaust exposure and in utero indirect exposure should be considered as a programming factor within the context of the DOHaD (Developmental Origins of Health and Disease) with a probable intergenerational transmission.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644022>Leukotriene Receptor Antagonists.</a></h2><p>The leukotriene receptor antagonists are among the most prescribed drugs for the management of asthma, used both for treatment and prevention of acute asthmatic attacks. This class of drugs acts by binding to cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) receptors and blocking their activation and the subsequent inflammatory cascade which cause the symptoms commonly associated with asthma and allergic rhinitis. The cysteinyl leukotrienes (C4, D4 and E4) are products of   and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. These eicosanoids bind to CysLT receptors. The CysLT type-1 receptor is found in the human airway smooth muscle cells and airway macrophages and on other proinflammatory cells. In asthmatic patients, leukotriene mediated effects include airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process. In allergic rhinitis, CysLTs are released from the nasal mucosa after allergen exposure and precipitate the symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Two leukotriene receptor antagonists are available in the United States, zafirlukast (1996) and montelukast (1998). Both are oral agents used in management of asthma and allergic rhinitis. Both have been associated with rare cases of acute liver injury. While they have similar mechanisms of action, these two agents are structurally distinct, and the liver injury they cause does not appear to be similar in pattern of presentation or outcome. Indeed, several instances of hepatotoxicity due to one agent have been described in which the patient has tolerated the other agent without recurrence.

Lipid mediators are signaling molecules which coordinately and intricately modulate inflammation. They are produced from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the cellular membrane via several enzymes including cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX). In the present study, we performed comprehensive analysis of lipid production in milk obtained from clinical or subclinical mastitic cows using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. We detected 26, 24, and 40 kinds of lipid constantly in healthy, subclinical, and clinical mastitic milk, respectively. In clinical mastitic milk, the amount of a major n-6 PUFA,  (AA), tended to increase, whereas amounts of major n-3 PUFAs, eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic , tended to decrease. The amounts of several AA-derived lipids including COX-catalyzed prostaglandin (PG) D and PGE , and LOX-catalyzed leukotriene (LT) B were increased in clinical mastitic milk. Although subclinical mastitic milk represented similar trend of lipid production to healthy milk, amounts of several lipids such as LTD , 14,15-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic , and 14-epoxyeicosatrienoic  changed.

The one-target one-drug paradigm has been the dominating drug discovery approach in the past decades. Compared to single target-based drugs, combination drug targets may overcome many limitations of single drug target and achieve a more effective and safer control of the disease. Most of existing combination drug targets are developed based on clinical experience or text-and-trial strategy, which cannot provide theoretical guidelines for designing and screening effective drug combinations. Therefore, systematic identification of multiple drug targets and optimal intervention strategy needs to be developed.We developed a strategy to screen the synergistic combinations of two drug targets in disease  based on the classification of single drug targets. The method tried to identify the sensitivity of single intervention and then the combination of multiple interventions that can restore the disease network to a desired normal state. In our strategy of screening drug target combinations, we first classified all drug targets into sensitive and insensitive single drug targets. Then, we identified the synergistic and antagonistic of drug target combinations, including the combinations of sensitive drug targets, the combinations of insensitive drug target and the combination of sensitive and insensitive targets. Finally, we applied our strategy to  (AA)  network and found 18 pairs of synergistic drug target combinations, five of which have been proven to be viable by biological or medical experiments.Different from traditional methods for judging drug synergy and antagonism, we propose the framework of how to enhance the efficiency by perturbing two sensitive targets in a combinatorial way, how to decrease the drug dose and therefore its side effect and cost by perturbing combinatorially a main sensitive target and an auxiliary insensitive target, and how to perturb two insensitive targets to realize the transition from a disease state to a healthy one which cannot be realized by perturbing each insensitive target alone. Although the idea is mainly applied to an AA  network, the strategy holds for more general molecular  such as combinatorial regulation in gene regulatory .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31500169>Long-Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Are Associated with Blood Pressure and Hypertension over 10-Years in Black South African Adults Undergoing Nutritional Transition.</a></h2><p>Nutritional transition in Africa is linked with increased blood pressure (BP). We examined 10-year fatty  status and longitudinal associations between individual long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), BP and status of hypertension (≥140/90 mmHg and/or medication use) in black South Africans. We included 300 adults (>30 years) participating in the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology study, and analysed data from three consecutive examinations (2005, 2010 and 2015 study years). Fatty acids in plasma phospholipids were analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We applied sequential linear mixed models for continuous outcomes and generalized mixed models for the hypertension outcome, in the complete sample and separately in urban and rural subjects. Mean baseline systolic/diastolic BP was 137/89 mmHg. Ten-year hypertension status increased among rural (48.6% to 68.6%,  = 0.001) and tended to decrease among urban subjects (67.5% to 61.9%,  = 0.253). Regardless of urbanisation, -6 PUFA increased and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, C20:5 -3) decreased over the 10-years. Subjects in the highest tertile of  (C20:4 -6) had 3.81 mmHg lower systolic (95% confidence interval (CI): -7.07, -0.54) and 3.82 mmHg lower diastolic BP (DBP) (95% CI: -5.70, -1.95) compared to the reference tertile, irrespective of lifestyle and clinical confounders. Similarly, osbond  (C22:5 -6) was inversely associated with DBP. Over the 10-years, subjects in the highest EPA tertile presented with +2.92 and +1.94 mmHg higher SBP and DBP, respectively, and with 1.46 higher odds of being hypertensive.

Oxidative stress induced by chronic ethanol consumption or cancer transformation has been implicated in changing the levels of phospholipids and fatty acids in the cell membrane. In this study, we used high-performance liquid chromatography to quantitate the effects of alcohol and malignant transformation on membrane components, namely phospholipids and free fatty acids. Ethanol increased the phospholipid levels. Moreover, the process of malignant transformation was accompanied by increased levels of phospholipids and  as well as decreased levels of linoleic  and α-linolenic .

Conversely, the omega-6 fatty ,  (AA) is a precursor to a number of pro-inflammatory/pro-aggregatory mediators. EPA acts competitively with AA for the key cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase enzymes to form less inflammatory products. As a result, the EPA:AA ratio may be a marker of chronic inflammation, with a lower ratio corresponding to higher levels of inflammation. It is now well established that inflammation plays an important role in cardiovascular disease. This review examines the role of the EPA:AA ratio as a marker of cardiovascular disease and the relationship between changes in the ratio (mediated by EPA intake) and changes in cardiovascular risk. Epidemiological studies have shown that a lower EPA:AA ratio is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic heart failure, peripheral artery disease, and vascular disease. Increasing the EPA:AA ratio through treatment with purified EPA has been shown in clinical studies to be effective in primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease and reduces the risk of cardiovascular events following percutaneous coronary intervention. The EPA:AA ratio is a valuable predictor of cardiovascular risk. Results from ongoing clinical trials will help to define thresholds for EPA treatment associated with better clinical outcomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31399511>Acyl-CoA synthetase 6 enriches seminiferous tubules with the ω-3 fatty  docosahexaenoic  and is required for male fertility in the mouse.</a></h2><p>Docosahexaenoic  (DHA) is an ω-3 dietary-derived polyunsaturated fatty  of marine origin enriched in testes and necessary for normal fertility, yet the mechanisms regulating the enrichment of DHA in the testes remain unclear.

The current study found that gender was a significant determinant of the effects of exhaustive exercise on the cortisol, blood urea nitrogen, creatine kinase, and the ratio of reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione, whereas, no significant interaction effects between gender and exhaustive exercise were found on the levels of testosterone, malonaldehyde, reduced glutathione, oxidized glutathione and lactic dehydrogenase. In male rats, the altered metabolites within exhaustive exercise included increased tricarboxylic  cycle intermediates (citric , fumaric , butanedioic ), branch-chain amino acids (valine, leucine), fatty acids and metabolite (oleic , linoleic , 3-hydroxybutyric ), phosphate and decreased glucose, lactic , serine, and glutamic .

Endocannabinoids and endocannabinoid-like compounds [endocannabinoid metabolome (ECM)] are endogenous lipid mediators derived from long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. Based on animal models, it has been proposed that endocannabinoid arachidonoyl glycerol (AG) plays a role in establishing the suckling response during lactation. In addition, endocannabinoid ethanolamides have been shown to stimulate food intake. The mechanisms of action and the role of the ECM in human milk are not fully understood.The present study aimed to characterize and quantify the ECM in human milk samples from an underserved population in Guatemala.Human milk samples were collected from lactating women ( = 26) for ECM characterization and quantification. Samples were taken at 3 different time points between 4 and 6 mo of lactation during maternal fasting. Human milk samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Identified members of the ECM were: arachidonoyl ethanolamide, palmitoyl ethanolamide (PEA), oleoyl ethanolamide, docosahexaenoyl ethanolamide, eicoapentaenoyl ethanolamide, eicosenoyl ethanolamide, AG, palmitoyl glycerol, oleoyl glycerol, docosahexaenoyl glycerol, eicosapentaenoyl glycerol, eicosenoyl glycerol,  (ARA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA), and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA).Overall, concentrations in the ethanolamide group were lower than the glycerols.

Women with an omega-3 index <5% had a 5-fold increased risk of depressive episode than did those with an omega-3 index ≥5% (OR 5.22 (95%CI 1.24-21.88)). A low n-3 PUFA status, alone and combined with high n-6 PUFA status, in early pregnancy was associated with a greater risk of PPD. Management of maternal n-3 PUFA deficiency can be a simple, safe and cost-effective strategy for the prevention of this major public health issue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31287882>Fatty acids modulate the expression of pyruvate kinase and arachidonate-lipoxygenase through PPARγ/CYP2C45 pathway: a link to goose fatty liver.</a></h2><p>Cytochrome P-450 2C45 (CYP2C45) is the most highly expressed cytochrome P-450 isoform in chicken liver, and may play an important role in avian liver biology. However, information regarding the function of CYP2C45 in fatty liver is generally limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of CYP2C45 during the development of goose fatty liver. Our result indicated that the transcription of CYP2C45, together with PK and ALOX5, was increased in goose liver upon overfeeding for 19 D (P < 0.05). In goose primary hepatocytes, CYP2C45 RNA expression was also upgraded by the treatment with various chemicals like insulin, the fatty acids, and PPAR agonists (P < 0.05). We also found that both CYP2C45 overexpression and troglitazone treatment could increase the expression of pyruvate kinase (PK) and arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5), and furthermore, showed that the up-regulation of PK and ALOX5 induced by troglitazone could be suppressed by small interfering RNAs targeting CYP2C45 (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that fatty acids treatment and the overfeeding can induce the up-regulation of CYP2C45 expression possibly via PPARγ and that the induction of PK and ALOX5 in goose fatty liver is at least partially attributed to fatty -induced expression of CYP2C45. Thus, our data provides an insight into the mechanism by which glycolysis and   are modulated in goose fatty liver.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083889>Antischistosomal Properties of Sclareol and Its Heck-Coupled Derivatives: Design, Synthesis, Biological Evaluation, and Untargeted Metabolomics.</a></h2><p>Sclareol, a plant-derived diterpenoid widely used as a fragrance and flavoring substance, is well-known for its promising antimicrobial and anticancer properties. However, its activity on helminth parasites has not been previously reported. Here, we show that sclareol is active against larval (IC ≈ 13 μM), juvenile (IC = 5.0 μM), and adult (IC = 19.3 μM) stages of , a parasitic trematode responsible for the neglected tropical disease schistosomiasis. Microwave-assisted synthesis of Heck-coupled derivatives improved activity, with the substituents choice guided by the Matsy decision tree. The most active derivative  showed improved potency and selectivity on larval (IC ≈ 2.2 μM, selectivity index (SI) ≈ 22 in comparison to HepG2 cells), juvenile (IC = 1.7 μM, SI = 28.8), and adult schistosomes (IC = 9.4 μM, SI = 5.2). Scanning electron microscopy studies revealed that compound  induced blebbing of the adult worm surface at sublethal concentration (12.5 μM); moreover, the compound inhibited egg production at the lowest concentration tested (3.13 μM). The observed phenotype and data obtained by untargeted metabolomics suggested that compound  affects membrane lipid homeostasis by interfering with  . The same methodology applied to praziquantel (PZQ)-treated worms revealed sugar  alterations that could be ascribed to the previously reported action of PZQ on serotonin signaling and/or effects on glycolysis. Importantly, our data suggest that compound  and PZQ exert different antischistosomal activities. More studies will be necessary to confirm the generated hypothesis and to progress the development of more potent antischistosomal sclareol derivatives.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31542371>Comparative serum metabolomics between SCID mice and BALB/c mice with or without Schistosoma japonicum infection: Clues to the abnormal growth and development of schistosome in SCID mice.</a></h2><p>The small blood flukes of genus Schistosoma, which cause one of the most prevalent and serious parasitic zoonosis schistosomiasis, are dependent on immune-related factors of their mammalian host to facilitate their growth and development, and the formation of granulomatous pathology caused by eggs deposited in host's liver and intestinal wall. Schistosome development is hampered in the mice lacking just T cells, and is even more heavily retarded in the severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice lacking both T and B lymphocytes. Nevertheless, it's still not clear about the underlying regulatory molecular mechanisms of schistosome growth and development by host's immune system. This study, therefore, detected and compared the serum  profiles between the immunodeficient mice and immunocompetent mice (SCID mice vs. BALB/c mice) before and after S. japonicum infection (on the thirty-fifth day post infection using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Totally, 705 ion features in electrospray ionization in positive-ion mode (ESI+) and 242 ion features in ESI- mode were identified, respectively. First, distinct serum  profiles were identified between SCID mice and BALB/c mice without S. japonicum worms infection. Second, uniquely perturbed serum metabolites and their enriched  were also obtained between SCID mice and BALB/c mice after S. japonicum infection, which included differential metabolites due to both species differences and differential responses to S. japonicum infection. The   analysis revealed that  , biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, linoleic  , glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor biosynthesis, alpha-linolenic  , glycerophospholipid , sphingolipid  and purine  were enriched based on the differential serum metabolites between SCID mice and BALB/c mice after S. japonicum infection, which was addressed to be related to the retarded growth and development of S. japonicum in SCID mice. These findings provide new clues to the underlying molecular events of host's systemic  changes on the growth and development of S. japonicum worms, and also provide quite promising candidates for exploitation of drugs or vaccines against schistosome and schistosomiasis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Although anti-carcinogenic activities of certain 5-LO inhibitors have been reported, the role of zileuton, a well known 5-LO inhibitor, on the endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis has not been fully elucidated. Here, we report that zileuton has an anti-angiogenic effect, and the underlying mechanisms involved activation of the large-conductance Ca-activated K (BK) channel. Our results show that zileuton significantly prevented vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro, as well as in vivo. However, such anti-angiogenic effect of zileuton was abolished by iberiotoxin (IBTX), a BK channel blocker, suggesting zileuton-induced activation of BK channel was critical for the observed anti-angiogenic effect of zileuton. Furthermore, the anti-angiogenic effect of zileuton was, at least, due to the activation of pro-apoptotic signaling cascades which was also abolished by IBTX. Additionally, zileuton suppressed the expression of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, ETS related gene (Erg) and the production of nitric oxide (NO). Taken together, our results show that zileuton prevents angiogenesis by activating the BK channel dependent-apoptotic pathway, thus highlighting its therapeutic capacity in angiogenesis-related diseases, such as cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31371090>M2-like cells from the macrophage lineage might play a central role in closure of the embryonic neural tube.</a></h2><p>Herein it is hypothesized that M2-like macrophages or pre-macrophages of fetal origin might play a central role in development and closure of the neural tube. Early in embryonic development, pre-macrophages arise from the fetal yolk sac and track through the bloodstream to reach diverse embryonic tissues, where they mature. Most of these macrophages exhibit an M2-like phenotype. The critical period for neural tube closure is contained within the period of yolk sac-derived pre-macrophage tracking and distribution, which poses a question: might these pre-macrophages or macrophages exert an influence on the closing neural tube? Evidence suggests that perturbations in macrophage polarization or M2 macrophage function might contribute to the failure of neural tube closure associated with diabetes mellitus, one carbon  (including folic  deficit), inositol, , and sphingosine-1-phosphate, as well as in the teratogenicity of nitric , valproic , and fumonisin. The influence of each of these factors is interpreted in light of potential interactions with M2-like macrophages or macrophage progenitors on the developing neural tube. By placing these anti inflammatory macrophages at the center of various epigenetic, neurochemical, and signaling processes suspected to be involved in neural tube closure, potential associations are revealed between macrophages and embryonic structural developmental processes such as collagen and actin dynamics. The choice of this model is also an attempt to explain why some etiologies for failure of neural tube closure are rescued by folic , whereas other etiologies are rescued only by formate, inositol, or not at all.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Platycodins Folium (PF) is the dried leaf of Platycodon grandiflorum, with anti-inflammatory and antioxidative activities. Our previous research suggested that PF was rich in flavonoids, phenols, organic acids, triterpenoid saponins, coumarins and terpenoids. This study aimed to investigate the antidepressant effect of PF using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depressive mice. Several behavior tests (sucrose preference test (SPT), forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST)) and biochemical parameters (IL-6, TNF-α and SOD levels) were used to evaluate the antidepressive effect of PF on LPS-induced depression model. Furthermore, a UPLC-Q/TOF-MS-based metabolomics approach was applied to explore the latent mechanism of PF in attenuating depression. As a result, a total of 21 and 11 metabolites that potentially contribute to MDD progress and PF treatment were identified in serum and hippocampus, respectively. The analysis of   revealed that lipid , amino  , energy ,  , glutathione  and inositol phosphate  were disturbed in a model of mice undergoing MDD and PF treatment. These results help us to understand the pathogenesis of depression in depth, and to discover targets for clinical diagnosis and treatment.

In summer, compared with the dredged area including neither zoobenthos nor submerged macrophytes, the algal biomass and density were significantly lower in the area filled with the submerged macrophytes. Interestingly, the minimum algal bloom was observed in the combined area containing submerged macrophytes and zoobenthos, which was due to the synergistic interaction between the zoobenthos and the macrophytes. The metabolite extracts from the numerically dominant zoobenthos Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri had significant algal inhibitory effects of Microcystis aeruginosa, and displayed stimulatory effects on seed germination, seedling growth, and peroxidase activity of the prevalent submerged macrophyte Potamogeton malaianus. 27 active compounds in the worm metabolites were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Among these compounds three chemicals , eicosapentaenoic , and linoleic  with concentrations of 13.92 ± 1.11, 10.57 ± 2.52, 2.75 ± 0.73 mg/kg dry weight, respectively, were confirmed as the typical allelochemicals with algal inhibition potential. In short, the metabolites allelopathy of L. hoffmeisteri can form and assist the synergistic effect between L. hoffmeisteri and P. malaianus on algal suppression.

Previous studies have indicated that neurodevelopment may also be impaired through alternative , including reduction of cAMP catalyzed downstream events. The upstream initiating events that underlie non-cholinergic neurological actions of chlorpyrifos and other organophosphorus compounds remain unclear. To investigate the potential role of disruption of fatty  signaling as a mechanism of toxicity, lipid  and fatty  profiles were examined to identify alterations that may play a critical role in upstream signaling in the CNS. Juvenile rainbow trout were treated for 7 days with nominal chlorpyrifos concentrations previously reported to diminish olfactory responses (10, 20, and 40 μg/L). While lethality was noted higher doses, measured chlorpyrifos concentrations of 1.38 μg/L (nominal concentration 10 μg/L) significantly reduced the activity of AChE and two serine lipases, monoacylglycerol lipase and fatty  amide hydrolase in the brain. Reductions in lysophosphatidylethanolamines (16:0; 18:0, 18:1, and 22:6) derived from the phosphatidylethanolamines and free fatty acids (Palmitic acid16:0; Linolenic acid18:3; Eicosadienoic  20:2;  20:4; and Docosahexaenoic  22:6) were also noted, suggesting that chlorpyrifos inhibited the  of selected phospholipid signaling precursors at sublethal concentrations. These results indicate that in addition to AChE inhibition, environmentally relevant chlorpyrifos exposure alters serine lipase activity and lipid metabolites in the trout brain, which may compromise neuronal signaling and impact neurobehavioral responses in aquatic animals.© The Author(s) 2019.

Besides providing physical properties to cell membranes, these PUFAs are metabolically active and undergo turnover through the "deacylation-reacylation (Land's) cycle". Recent studies suggest a Yin-Yang mechanism for  of ARA and DHA, largely due to different phospholipases A (PLAs) mediating their release. ARA and DHA are substrates of cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases resulting in an array of lipid mediators, which are pro-inflammatory and pro-resolving. The PUFAs are susceptible to peroxidation by oxygen free radicals, resulting in the production of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) from ARA and 4-hydroxyhexenal (4-HHE) from DHA. These alkenal electrophiles are reactive and capable of forming adducts with proteins, phospholipids and nucleic acids. The perceived cytotoxic and hormetic effects of these hydroxyl-alkenals have impacted cell signaling , glucose  and mitochondrial functions in chronic and inflammatory diseases. Due to the high levels of DHA and ARA in brain phospholipids, this review is aimed at providing information on the Yin-Yang mechanisms for regulating these PUFAs and their lipid peroxidation products in the CNS, and implications of their roles in neurological disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31105590>Relationship Between Distance Run Per Week, Omega-3 Index, and  (AA)/Eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) Ratio: An Observational Retrospective Study in Non-elite Runners.</a></h2><p> Tissue availability of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) depends on several factors, including dietary intake, physical exercise, genetic variation, and  turnover.

The whole blood samples were collected by finger sticks, stored on absorbent filter paper, and then PUFA were quantified by gas chromatography (GC) and ω-3 index and AA/EPA ratio measured.  In a multivariate linear regression model, a gradual decrease of the ω-3 index was observed with higher weekly running distance (β = -0.033; 95% CI -0.039 to -0.026; R = 0.447;  < 0.0001). We also found a progressive increase of the AA/EPA ratio in subjects who ran greater weekly distances (β = 0.092; 95% CI 0.038 to 0.146; R = 0.320;  = 0.001). No other significant associations were observed with other variables, including years of running training and weekly training frequency (hours/week). Finally, as expected, a significant inverse correlation between ω-3 index and AA/EPA ratio (β = -2.614; 95% CI -3.407 to -1.821; R = 0.336;  < 0.0001) was detected.  These findings suggest that distance running training and its weekly volume may negatively contribute to changes of the ω-3 index and AA/EPA ratio. Further studies with greater sample size will be required to replicate and extend these data.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31411921>Cytokine and inflammatory mediator effects on TRPV4 function in choroid plexus epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>The choroid plexus (CP), composed of capillaries surrounded by a barrier epithelium, is the main producer of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The CP epithelium regulates the transport of ions and water between the blood and the ventricles, contributing to CSF production and composition. Several studies suggest a connection between the cation channel transient receptor potential vanilloid-4 (TRPV4) and transepithelial ion movement. TRPV4 is a nonselective, calcium-permeable cation channel present in CP epithelia reported to be activated by cytokines and inflammatory mediators. Utilizing the PCP-R (porcine choroid plexus-Riems) cell line, we investigated the effects of various cytokines and inflammatory mediators on TRPV4-mediated activity. Select proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, TGF-β1) had inhibitory effects on TRPV4-stimulated transepithelial ion flux and permeability changes, whereas anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-4, and IL-6) had none. Quantitative mRNA analysis showed that these cytokines had no effect on TRPV4 transcription levels. Inhibition of the transcription factor NF-κB, involved in the production and regulation of several inflammatory cytokines, inhibited TRPV4-mediated activity, suggesting a link between TRPV4 and cytokine production. Contrary to published studies, the proinflammatory mediator  (AA) had inhibitory rather than stimulatory effects on TRPV4-mediated responses. However, inhibition of AA  also caused inhibitory effects on TRPV4, suggesting a complex interaction of AA and its metabolites in the regulation of TRPV4 activity. Together these data imply that TRPV4 activity is involved in the inflammatory response; it is negatively affected by proinflammatory mediators. Furthermore,  metabolites, but not  itself, are positive regulators of TRPV4.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31065462>CYP2C11 played a significant role in down-regulating rat blood pressure under the challenge of a high-salt diet.</a></h2><p> (AA) is oxidized by cytochrome P450s (CYPs) to form epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), compounds that modulate ion transport, gene expression, and vasorelaxation. Both CYP2Cs and CYP2Js are involved in kidney EET epoxidation.In this study, we used a -null rat model to explore the in vivo effects of CYP2C11 on vasorelaxation. For 2 months, -null and wild-type (WT) Sprague-Dawley rats were either fed normal lab (0.3% (w/w) sodium chloride) or high-salt (8% (w/w) sodium chloride) diets. Subsequently, an invasive method was used to determine blood pressure. Next, western blots, quantitative PCR, and immunohistochemistry were used to determine renal expression of CYPs involved in AA .Among -null rats, a high-salt diet (females: 156.79 ± 15.89 mm Hg, males: 130.25 ± 16.76 mm Hg,  = 10) resulted in significantly higher blood pressure than a normal diet (females: 118.05 ± 8.43 mm Hg,  < 0.01; males: 115.15 ± 11.45 mm Hg,  < 0.05,  = 10). Compared with WT rats under the high-salt diet, western blots showed that -null rats had higher renal expression of CYP2J2 and CYP4A. This was consistent with the results of immunohistochemistry and the qPCR, respectively. The two rat strains did not differ in the renal expression of CYP2C23 or CYP2C24.Our findings suggested that CYP2C11 plays an important role in lowering blood pressure under the challenge of a high-salt diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31438579>Isolation of a Novel Metalloproteinase from Agkistrodon Venom and Its Antithrombotic Activity Analysis.</a></h2><p>Snake venom contains large amounts of active proteins and peptides. In this study, a novel snake protein, metalloproteinase SP, was successfully isolated from the venom of   by multi-gel chromatography. The isolated protein exhibits anti-platelet aggregation activity. Animal experiments showed that it exhibited defibration, anticoagulation, and antithrombotic effects and contributes to improved blood rheology and antiplatelet aggregation. In vivo experiments demonstrated that it prolonged clotting time, partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, thrombin time, fibrinogen time and reduced fibrinogen content of mice. Also, metalloproteinase SP inhibited carrageenan-induced tail thrombosis, ADP-induced acute pulmonary embolism, and ADP,  (AA), or collagen-induced platelet aggregation. In vitro experiments showed that the protein cleaved the α, β, and γ chains of fibrinogen. Metabolomic analysis upon metalloproteinase SP treatment revealed that 14 metabolites, which are mainly involved in phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis, responded to metalloproteinase SP treatment. In summary, the isolated snake venom protein inhibits formation of acute pulmonary embolism probably through regulating and restoring perturbed energy, lipid, and amino  .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30891260>Metabolomics analysis of baicalin on ovalbumin-sensitized allergic rhinitis rats.</a></h2><p>Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a global health problem that appears in all age groups and affects approximately 15-30% of people. Baicalin has been used for the treatment of various allergic diseases, including AR. However, the  mechanisms of AR and baicalin against AR have not been systematically studied. Here, ovalbumin-sensitized AR rats were used as a model, and animal behaviour, histological analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and metabolomics were used to elucidate the mechanism of baicalin for AR. The results indicated that baicalin has a protective effect on AR rats by inhibiting the release of immunoglobulin E (IgE), histamine, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). In addition, ovalbumin-induced AR included modulation of , leukotriene A4 (LTA4), leukotriene B4 (LTB4), α-ketoglutaric , phosphatidylcholine PC (20 : 4/0 : 0), PC (16 : 0/0 : 0), citric , fumarate, malate, 3-methylhistidine, histamine and other amino acids that are involved in , histidine , the TCA cycle and amino  . Thus, AR could be alleviated or reversed by baicalin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30890432>Lipid droplets participate in modulating innate immune genes in Ctenopharyngodon idella kidney cells.</a></h2><p>Lipid droplets (LDs) are increasingly being recognized as important immune modulators in mammals, in additional to their function of lipid ester deposition. However, the role of LDs in fish immunity remains poorly understood. In this study, the function of LDs in the innate immune response of Ctenopharyngodon idella kidney (CIK) cells, which are the equivalent of myeloid cells in vertebrates, was investigated. LD number and TG content significantly increased in the CIK cells following exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN), and polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic  (Poly [I: C]) for 24 h, accompanied by increases in the relative expression of several innate immune genes. However, fatty  compositions of the triglycerides were not changed after treatment with these three pathogenic mimics. LPS, PGN, and Poly (I: C) did not alter the relative expressions of lipogenic (FAS, SCD, and DGAT) and lipid catabolic (PPARα, ATGL, and CPT-1) genes. However, these treatments did increase the mRNA levels of lipid transportation genes (FATP/CD36, ACSL1, and ACSL4), and also decreased the non-esterified fatty  level in the medium. To further explore the role of LDs in the immune response, CIK cells were incubated with different concentrations (0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 μM) of exogenous lipid mix (LM; oleic  [OA]:linoleic  [LA]:linolenic  [LNA] = 2:1:1), and were then transferred to a lipid-free medium and incubated for 24 h. LD size and number increased with the increase in lipid levels, and this was accompanied by increased expression of innate immune genes, including MyD88, IRF3, and IL-1β, which were expressed at their highest levels in 300 μM exogenous lipid mix. Interestingly, after incubating with different fatty acids (LM, OA, LA, LNA,  [ARA], and docosahexaenoic  [DHA]; 300 μM), ARA and DHA were more potent in inducing LD formation and innate immune gene expression in the CIK cells. Finally, atglistatin, an ATGL inhibitor, effectively attenuated the expression of most genes upregulated by ARA or DHA, suggesting that lipolysis may be involved in the regulation of immune genes at the transcriptional level. Overall, the findings of this study demonstrate that LDs are functional organelles that could act as modulators in the innate immune response of CIK cells. Additionally, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty  enriched LDs play a unique role in regulating this process.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

During two meal challenge test visits subjects received standardized isocaloric (450 kcal) liquid meals: high-carbohydrate (HC, carbohydrates: 89% of energy) and normo-carbohydrate (NC, carbohydrates: 45% of energy). Fasting (0 min) and postprandial (30, 60, 120, 180 min) plasma samples were analyzed for metabolite profiles through untargeted metabolomics.  fingerprinting was performed on an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) system connected to an iFunnel quadrupole-time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometer.In HR-genotype men, after the intake of an HC-meal, we noted a significantly lower area under the curves (AUCs) of postprandial plasma concentrations of most of the phospholipids (-37% to -53%, variable importance in the projection (VIP) = 1.2-1.5), lysophospholipids (-29% to -86%, VIP = 1.1-2.6), sphingolipids (-32% to -47%, VIP = 1.1-1.3), as well as  (-36%, VIP = 1.4) and oleic (-63%, VIP = 1.3) acids, their metabolites: keto- and hydoxy-fatty acids (-38% to -78%, VIP = 1.3-2.5), leukotrienes (-65% to -83%, VIP = 1.4-2.2), uric  (-59%, VIP = 1.5), and pyroglutamic  (-65%, VIP = 1.8). The AUCs of postprandial sphingosine concentrations were higher (125-832%, VIP = 1.9-3.2) after the NC-meal, AUCs of acylcarnitines were lower (-21% to -61%, VIP = 1.1-2.4), and AUCs of fatty  amides were higher (51-508%, VIP = 1.7-3.1) after the intake of both meals.In nondiabetic men carrying the TCF7L2 HR genotype, subtle but detectable modifications in intermediate lipid  are induced by an HC-meal.

Previous study demonstrated that there was an exactly therapeutic effect of SCG on autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) by improving liver function and alleviating the clinical symptoms. However, studies of the mechanism by which SCG alleviates Con A-induced liver injury (CILI) should be complemented.An ultraperformance liquid chromatography with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF/MS)-based metabolomics approach combined with principle component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminate analysis (OPLS-DA) were integrated applied to obtain metabolites for clarifying mechanisms of disease.In accordance with previously study, the present study demonstrated that SCG could obviously improve the liver injury in mouse induced by Con A via downregulating serum biochemical indexes, alleviating the histological damage and inhibiting the neutrophil infiltration in liver tissues. Different expression of 9 metabolites related to 8 , including fatty  biosynthesis,  metabolisms, linoleic  metabolisms, sphingolipid metabolisms, fatty  elongation in mitochondria, glycerophospholipid , fatty  , pyrimidine  were demonstrated responsible for the efficacy of SCG in treating CILI.In sum up, SCG has been indicated favorable therapeutic effect on Con A induced liver injury.

Although the differential  of the main n-3PUFA eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) could lead to distinct activities, there are no clinical studies comparing their relative efficacy in human skin. Following a 10-wk oral supplementation of healthy volunteers and using mass spectrometry-based lipidomics, we found that n-3PUFA mainly affected the epidermal mediator lipidome. EPA was more efficient than DHA in reducing production of -derived lipids, and both n-3PUFA lowered -acyl ethanolamines. In UV radiation-challenged skin (3 times the minimum erythemal dose), EPA attenuated the production of proinflammatory lipids, whereas DHA abrogated the migration of Langerhans cells, as assessed by immunohistochemistry. Interestingly, n-3PUFA increased the infiltration of CD4 and CD8 T cells but did not alter the erythemal response, either the sunburn threshold or the resolution of erythema, as assessed by spectrophotometric hemoglobin index readings. As EPA and DHA differentially impact cutaneous inflammation through changes in the network of epidermal lipids and dendritic and infiltrating immune cells, they should be considered separately when designing interventions for cutaneous disease.-Kendall, A.
