However, the role of AR in the development of these diseases remains unclear. We performed this current study to determine whether and how AR might be involved in the development of diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Our results showed that the level of AR protein expression was significantly higher in db/db mice fed the methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet than in mice fed the control diet. In parallel with the elevation in AR, steatohepatitis was observed in MCD diet-fed mice, and this diet-induced steatohepatitis was significantly attenuated by lentiviral-mediated knock-down of the AR gene. This suppressive effect of AR knock-down was associated with repressed levels of serum alanine aminotransferase and hepatic lipoperoxides, reduced mRNA and protein expression of hepatic cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), and decreased mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Moreover, AR-induced elevations on the level of CYP2E1 expression, reactive oxygen species, mRNA expression of TNF-α and IL-6 were confirmed in AML12 hepatocytes. Further, lentiviral-mediated knock-down of AR ameliorated MCD diet-induced collagen deposition in the livers of db/db mice. With the improvement in  fibrosis, the mRNA levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), two genes involved in hepatic fibrogenesis, were found to be significantly suppressed, while TIMP-2 and MMP-13 were unaffected. Together these data indicate that inhibition of AR alleviates the MCD diet-induced  inflammation and fibrosis in db/db mice, probably through dampening CYP2E1 mediated-oxidative stress and ameliorating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25513727>Single injection of the β2-adrenergic receptor agonist, clenbuterol, into newly hatched chicks alters abdominal fat pad mass in growing birds.</a></h2><p>Excessive energy is stored in white adipose tissue as triacylglycerols in birds as well as in mammals. Although β2-adrenergic receptor agonists reduce adipose tissue mass in birds, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The aim of the current study was to examine the effects of a single intraperitoneal injection of the β2-adrenergic receptor agonist, clenbuterol, on the abdominal fat pad tissue development. Thirty-three chicks at 1-day-old were given a single intraperitoneal injection of clenbuterol (0.1mg/kg body weight) or phosphate-buffered saline. At 2 weeks post-dose, the weight of the abdominal fat tissue was decreased in the clenbuterol-injected chicks, and small adipocyte-like cells were observed in the abdominal fat pad tissue of the clenbuterol-injected chicks. Then, the expression of mRNAs encoding genes related to avian adipogenesis was examined in the abdominal fat pat tissue. The expression of mRNAs encoding Krüppel-like zinc finger transcription factor 5 (KLF-5), KLF-15, and zinc finger protein 423 in the abdominal fat pad tissue of the clenbuterol-injected chicks was significantly lower (P<0.05) than that of the control chicks, while the expression of mRNA encoding peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma was not affected. In addition, both mRNA expression (P<0.05) and enzymatic activity (P<0.05) of  acid synthase (FAS) were decreased in the abdominal fat pad tissue of the clenbuterol-injected chicks, while clenbuterol injection did not affect FAS activity in . These results suggested that a single injection with clenbuterol into newly hatched chicks reduces their abdominal fat pad mass possibly via disrupting adipocyte development during later growth stages.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a cellular energy sensor, but its role in regulating BAT and WAT metabolism is unclear. We generated an inducible model for deletion of the two AMPK β subunits in adipocytes (iβ1β2AKO) and found that iβ1β2AKO mice were cold intolerant and resistant to β-adrenergic activation of BAT and beiging of WAT. BAT from iβ1β2AKO mice had impairments in mitochondrial structure, function, and markers of mitophagy. In response to a high-fat diet, iβ1β2AKO mice more rapidly developed  steatosis as well as glucose and insulin intolerance. Thus, AMPK in adipocytes is vital for maintaining mitochondrial integrity, responding to pharmacological agents and thermal stress, and protecting against nutrient-overload-induced NAFLD and insulin resistance.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

NASH is known to alter hepatic membrane transporter expression and drug disposition similarly in humans and rodent models of NASH. Metformin is almost exclusively eliminated through the kidney primarily through active secretion mediated by Oct1, Oct2, and Mate1. The purpose of this study was to determine how NASH affects kidney transporter expression and metformin pharmacokinetics. A single oral dose of [(14)C]metformin was administered to C57BL/6J (wild type [WT]) and diabetic ob/ob mice fed either a control diet or a methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet. Metformin plasma concentrations were slightly increased in the WT/MCD and ob/control groups, whereas plasma concentrations were 4.8-fold higher in ob/MCD mice compared with WT/control. The MCD diet significantly increased plasma half-life and mean residence time and correspondingly decreased oral clearance in both genotypes. These changes in disposition were caused by ob/ob- and MCD diet-specific decreases in the kidney mRNA expression of Oct2 and Mate1, whereas Oct1 mRNA expression was only decreased in ob/MCD mice. These results indicate that the diabetic ob/ob genotype and the MCD disease model alter kidney transporter expression and alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, potentially increasing the risk of drug toxicity.© 2015 by the American Diabetes Association.

It is a direct response to fat mobilization due to negative energy balance. Accumulation of lipids in the  occurs if the uptake of non-esterified  acids by the  exceeds the capacity of lipid oxidation or secretion by the . Currently, the diagnosis of  disease requires confirmation through biopsies to determine the hepatic lipid content. In view of this lack of a practical diagnostic tool, we compared the plasma lipidome of diseased dairy cows using liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Multivariate data analysis yielded 20 m/z values that were able to distinguish between dairy cows with no hepatic lipidosis and those exhibiting different stages of the disease. Based on the chromatography retention time and m/z ratios, we identified phosphatidylcholines with reduced plasma abundances in cows with  disease. The abundances of different bile acids tended to be increased. In addition, we detected two metabolites related to inflammation, resolvin E1 and palmitoyl- (PEA), which need to be further investigated in cattle. These results indicate that the measurement of specific representatives of phosphatidylcholines in plasma may provide a novel diagnostic biomarker of  disease in dairy cows.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent studies have shown that SIRT3 expression is decreased in nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD). Moreover, SIRT3 is a key regulator of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate. Increased succinate concentrations and the specific G protein-coupled receptor 91 (GPR91) are involved in the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). In this study, we aimed to establish whether SIRT3 regulated the SDH activity, succinate, and GPR91 expression in HSCs and an animal model of NAFLD. Our goal was also to determine whether succinate released from hepatocytes regulated HSC activation. Inhibiting SIRT3 using SIRT3 siRNA exacerbated HSC activation via the SDH-succinate-GPR91 pathway, and SIRT3 overexpression or honokiol treatment attenuated HSC activation in vitro In isolated  and HSCs from methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet-induced NAFLD, the expression of SIRT3 and SDH activity was decreased, and the succinate concentrations and GPR91 expression were increased. Moreover, we found that GPR91 knockdown or resveratrol treatment improved the steatosis in MCD diet-fed mice. This investigation revealed a novel mechanism of the SIRT3-SDH-GPR91 cascade in MCD diet-induced HSC activation in NAFLD. These findings highlight the biological significance of novel strategies aimed at targeting SIRT3 and GPR91 in HSCs with the goal of improving NAFLD treatment.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30796899>Composition of plasmalogens in serum lipoproteins from patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and their susceptibility to oxidation.</a></h2><p>Plasmalogens are ether phospholipids (PL) with an alkenyl group including vinyl ether bound at the sn-1 position and a polyunsaturated  acid bound at the sn-2 position, and are susceptible to oxidation. To date, there are no reports on the relationship between plasmalogen in serum lipoproteins and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), caused by multiple factors including oxidative stress. Here, we have investigated the distribution of plasmalogens in serum lipoproteins isolated from NASH patients and healthy volunteers.Serum lipoproteins were separated by gel-filtration chromatography, and analyzed for  and choline plasmalogens using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.Both plasmalogen levels were higher in HDL than in VLDL or LDL. The plasmalogens/PL ratio was significantly lower in NASH than controls, for all lipoprotein fractions.  plasmalogens containing 20:4 and 22:6 at the sn-2 position and choline plasmalogens containing 16:0 at the sn-1 position were predominant in each group. In oxidation test using LDL from healthy serum, both types of plasmalogens were decreased during the early stages of oxidation.Plasmalogens could be a potential biomarker for evaluating the early stages of oxidation in NASH.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Phosphatidylcholine is the most abundant phospholipid in the surfactant monolayer that coats and stabilizes lipid droplets within cells, and choline is required for its major biosynthetic pathway. Phosphatidylcholine-transfer protein (PC-TP), which exchanges phosphatidylcholines among membranes, is enriched in hepatocytes. PC-TP also regulates  acid metabolism through interactions with thioesterase superfamily member 2. We investigated the contribution of PC-TP to steatohepatitis induced by the MCD diet.  and wild-type control mice were fed the MCD diet for 5 wk and were then euthanized for histopathologic and biochemical analyses, as well as determinations of mRNA and protein expression. Whereas all mice developed steatohepatitis, plasma alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities were only elevated in wild-type mice, indicating that  mice were protected from MCD diet-induced hepatocellular injury. Reduced hepatotoxicity due to the MCD diet in the absence of PC-TP expression was further evidenced by decreased activation of c-Jun and reduced plasma concentrations of fibroblast growth factor 21. Despite similar total hepatic concentrations of phosphatidylcholines and other lipids, the relative abundance of microvesicular lipid droplets within hepatocytes was reduced in  mice. Considering that the formation of larger lipid droplets may serve to protect against lipotoxicity in NASH, our findings suggest a pathogenic role for PC-TP that could be targeted in the management of this condition. Phosphatidylcholine-transfer protein (PC-TP) is a highly specific phosphatidylcholine-binding protein that we previously showed to regulate hepatocellular nutrient metabolism through its interacting partner thioesterase superfamily member 2 (Them2). This study identifies a pathogenic role for PC-TP, independent of Them2, in the methionine- and choline-deficient diet model of experimental steatohepatitis. Our current observations suggest that PC-TP promotes  injury by mediating the intermembrane transfer of phosphatidylcholines, thus stabilizing more pathogenic microvesicular lipid droplets.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23864684>Coordinated regulation of hepatic energy stores by leptin and hypothalamic agouti-related protein.</a></h2><p>Like obesity, prolonged food deprivation induces severe hepatic steatosis; however, the functional significance of this phenomenon is not well understood. In this study, we show that the fall in plasma leptin concentration during fasting is required for the development of hepatic steatosis in mice. Removal of leptin receptors from AGRP neurons diminishes fasting-induced hepatic steatosis. Furthermore, the suppressive effects of leptin on fasting-induced hepatic steatosis are absent in mice lacking the gene encoding agouti-related protein (Agrp), suggesting that this function of leptin is mediated by AGRP. Prolonged fasting leads to suppression of hepatic sympathetic activity, increased expression of acyl CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase-2 in the , and elevation of hepatic triglyceride content and all of these effects are blunted in the absence of AGRP. AGRP deficiency, despite having no effects on feeding or body adiposity in the free-fed state, impairs triglyceride and ketone body release from the  during prolonged fasting. Furthermore, reducing CNS Agrp expression in wild-type mice by RNAi protected against the development of hepatic steatosis not only during starvation, but also in response to consumption of a high-fat diet. These findings identify the leptin-AGRP circuit as a critical modulator of hepatic triglyceride stores in starvation and suggest a vital role for this circuit in sustaining the supply of energy from the  to extrahepatic tissues during periods of prolonged food deprivation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22734967>Kupffer cell depletion attenuates leptin-mediated methoxamine-stimulated portal perfusion pressure and thromboxane A2 release in a rodent model of NASH-cirrhosis.</a></h2><p>Cirrhotic portal hypertension is characterized by increased hepatic oxidative stress, AA (arachidonic acid)-derived TXA(2) (thromboxane A(2)) release and exaggerated hepatic response to the α-adrenergic agonist MTX (methoxamine). Besides promoting hepatic fibrosis, the role of hyperleptinaemia in the modulation of vascular response in NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis) rat livers remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to explore the possible links between hyperleptinaemia and the disarrangement in the hepatic microcirculation. NASH-cirrhosis with hyperleptinaemia was induced in lean rats by feeding with an HF/MCD (high-fat/methionine-choline-deficient) diet. Portal haemodynamics, various substances, protein and mRNA expression and PUFA (polyunsaturated  acid) composition were measured. Finally, the effects of leptin pre-infusion on TXA(2) release and concentration-PPP (portal perfusion pressure) curves in response to MTX were evaluated by simultaneously pre-treatment with the Kupffer cell inactivators GdCl(3) (gadolinium chloride) or EC (encapsulated clodronate), the TXS (TXA(2) synthase) inhibitor furegrelate, the TP receptor (TXA(2) receptor) antagonist SQ29548 and the dual TXS/TP receptor antagonist BM567. In HF/MCD+leptin-lean rats, cirrhosis-induced PPP and MTX hyper-responsiveness were associated with increased hepatic TXA(2) production, TBARS (thiobarbituric acid-reacting substances) levels and the AA (arachidonic acid)/n-3 PUFA ratio, and up-regulation of hepatic leptin, FAS ( acid synthase), NADPH oxidase subunits, TXS, TP receptor, TGFβ(1) (transforming growth factor β(1)) proteins and mRNAs. Pre-infusion of leptin significantly enhanced MTX-stimulated PPP elevation and TXA(2) release, which were attenuated by GdCl(3) and EC pre-treatment. Concomitantly pre-incubation with BM567, but not furegrelate or SQ29548, significantly abolished the leptin-enhanced MTX-stimulated increase in PPP in NASH-cirrhotic rats. Hyperleptinaemia plays an important role in hyper-responsiveness to MTX in NASH-cirrhotic rat livers with portal hypertension. The leptin-enhanced MTX-stimulated increase in PPP is mediated by increased oxidative stress and Kupffer-cell-activated AA-derived TXA(2) release in NASH-cirrhotic rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24714086> acid elongation in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) represents a risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is characterized by quantitative and qualitative changes in hepatic lipids. Since elongation of  acids from C16 to C18 has recently been reported to promote both hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation we aimed to investigate whether a frequently used mouse NASH model reflects this clinically relevant feature and whether C16 to C18 elongation can be observed in HCC development. Feeding mice a methionine and choline deficient diet to model NASH not only increased total hepatic  acids and cholesterol, but also distinctly elevated the C18/C16 ratio, which was not changed in a model of simple steatosis (ob/ob mice). Depletion of Kupffer cells abrogated both quantitative and qualitative methionine-and-choline deficient (MCD)-induced alterations in hepatic lipids. Interestingly, mimicking inflammatory events in early hepatocarcinogenesis by diethylnitrosamine-induced carcinogenesis (48 h) increased hepatic lipids and the C18/C16 ratio. Analyses of human  samples from patients with NASH or NASH-related HCC showed an elevated expression of the elongase ELOVL6, which is responsible for the elongation of C16  acids. Taken together, our findings suggest a detrimental role of an altered  acid pattern in the progression of NASH-related  disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29126873>Dual role of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B in the progression and reversion of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic  disease in Western countries. Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a negative modulator of insulin and cytokine signaling, is a therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes and obesity. We investigated the impact of PTP1B deficiency during NAFLD, particularly in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).NASH features were evaluated in livers from wild-type (PTP1BWT) and PTP1B-deficient (PTP1BKO) mice fed methionine/choline-deficient diet (MCD) for 8 weeks. A recovery model was established by replacing MCD to chow diet (CHD) for 2-7 days. Non-parenchymal  cells (NPCs) were analyzed by flow cytometry. Oval cells markers were measured in human and mouse livers with NASH, and in oval cells from PTP1BWT and PTP1BKO mice.PTP1BWT mice fed MCD for 8 weeks exhibited NASH, NPCs infiltration, and elevated Fgf21, Il6 and Il1b mRNAs. These parameters decreased after switching to CHD. PTP1B deficiency accelerated MCD-induced NASH. Conversely, after switching to CHD, PTP1BKO mice rapidly reverted NASH compared to PTP1BWT mice in parallel to the normalization of serum triglycerides (TG) levels. Among NPCs, a drop in cytotoxic natural killer T (NKT) subpopulation was detected in PTP1BKO livers during recovery, and in these conditions M2 macrophage markers were up-regulated. Oval cells markers (EpCAM and cytokeratin 19) significantly increased during NASH only in PTP1B-deficient livers. HGF-mediated signaling and proliferative capacity were enhanced in PTP1BKO oval cells. In NASH patients, oval cells markers were also elevated.PTP1B elicits a dual role in NASH progression and reversion. Additionally, our results support a new role for PTP1B in oval cell proliferation during NAFLD.Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

Currently, no drug treatment has been licensed for steatosis; thus, only nutritional guidelines are indicated to reduce its progression. The aim of this study is to combine different nutraceutical compounds in order to evaluate their synergistic effects on a steatosis in vitro model compared to their separate use. In particular, three different formulations based on silymarin, curcumin, vitamin E, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), choline, and phosphatidylcholine were assayed.Human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2 cell line) were treated with a mixture of  acids in order to induce an in vitro model of steatosic cells, and then the amount of intracellular fat was evaluated by Oil Red O staining. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors α and γ (PPARα and γ) expression, closely correlated to lipid metabolism, was evaluated. The efficiency of these receptors was evaluated through the study of LPL mRNA expression, a marker involved in the lipolysis mechanism. Superoxide dismutase (SOD-2) and malondialdehydes (MDA) in lipid peroxidation were assayed as specific biomarkers of oxidative stress. In addition, experiments were performed using human  cells stressed to obtain a steatosis model. In particular, the content of the intracellular fat was assayed using Oil Red O staining, the activation of PPARα and γ was evaluated through western blotting analyses, and the LPL mRNA expression level was analyzed through qRT-PCR.All formulations proved effective on lipid content reduction of about 35%. The oxidative stress damage was reduced by all the substances separately and even more efficiently by the same in formulation (i.e. Formulation 1 and Formulation 3, which reduced the SOD-2 expression and induced the PPARs activation). Lipid peroxidation, was reduced about 2 fold by foormulation2 and up to 5 fold by the others compared to the cells pretreated with HO.Formulation 1, was more effective on PPARγ expression (2.5 fold increase) respect to the other compounds on FA treated hepathocytes. Beside, LPL was activated also by Formulation 3 and resulted in a 5 to 9 fold-increase respect to FA treated control.Our results proved that the formulations tested could be considered suitable support to face steatosis disease beside the mandatory dietetic regimen.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24325457>The effects of α-lipoic acid on  oxidative stress and free  acid composition in methionine-choline deficient diet-induced NAFLD.</a></h2><p>Development of nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) occurs through initial steatosis and subsequent oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of α-lipoic acid (LA) on methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet-induced NAFLD in mice. Male C57BL/6 mice (n=21) were divided into three groups (n=7 per group): (1) control fed with standard chow, (2) MCD2 group--fed with MCD diet for 2 weeks, and (3) MCD2+LA group--2 weeks on MCD receiving LA i.p. 100 mg/kg/day. After the treatment,  samples were taken for pathohistology, oxidative stress parameters, antioxidative enzymes, and  free  acid (FFA) composition. Mild microvesicular hepatic steatosis was found in MCD2 group, while it was reduced to single fat droplets evident in MCD2+LA group. Lipid peroxidation and nitrosative stress were increased by MCD diet, while LA administration induced a decrease in  malondialdehyde and nitrates+nitrites level. Similary, LA improved  antioxidative capacity by increasing total superoxide dismutase (tSOD), manganese SOD (MnSOD), and copper/zinc-SOD (Cu/ZnSOD) activity as well as glutathione (GSH) content.  FFA profile has shown a significant decrease in saturated acids, arachidonic, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), while LA treatment increased their proportions. It can be concluded that LA ameliorates lipid peroxidation and nitrosative stress in MCD diet-induced hepatic steatosis through an increase in SOD activity and GSH level. In addition, LA increases the proportion of palmitic, stearic, arachidonic, and DHA in the . An increase in DHA may be a potential mechanism of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of LA in MCD diet-induced NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26242921>Choline supplementation restores substrate balance and alleviates complications of Pcyt2 deficiency.</a></h2><p>Choline plays a critical role in systemic lipid metabolism and hepatic function. Here we conducted a series of experiments to investigate the effect of choline supplementation on metabolically altered Pcyt2(+/-) mice. In Pcyt2(+/-) mice, the membrane phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) turnover is reduced and the formation of  acids (FA) and triglycerides (TAG) increased, resulting in hypertriglyceridemia,  steatosis and obesity. One month of choline supplementation reduced the incorporation of FA into TAG and facilitated TAG degradation in Pcyt2(+/-) adipocytes, plasma and . Choline particularly stimulated adipocyte and  TAG lipolysis by specific lipases (ATGL, LPL and HSL) and inhibited TAG formation by DGAT1 and DGAT2. Choline also activated the  AMPK and mitochondrial FA oxidation gene PPARα and reduced the FA synthesis genes SREBP1, SCD1 and FAS.  (HPLC) and plasma (tandem mass spectroscopy and (1)H-NMR) metabolite profiling established that Pcyt2(+/-) mice have reduced membrane cholesterol/sphingomyelin ratio and the homocysteine/methionine cycle that were improved by choline supplementation. These data suggest that supplementary choline is beneficial for restoring FA and TAG homeostasis under conditions of obesity caused by impaired PE synthesis.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

A gold disk modified with a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (11-MUA) was functionalised via covalent immobilization of monoclonal anti-ET-1 antibodies using EDC-NHS (1-(3-(dimethylamine)-propyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride, N-hydroxy succinimide) chemistry. This immunosensing platform (/anti-ET-1/11-MUA/Au) was characterized via atomic force microscopy (AFM), contact angle (CA) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic techniques.

NAFLD is generally exhibited by non-progressive simple steatosis. However, a significant subset of patient's progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that is defined by the presence of steatosis, inflammation and hepatocyte injury with fibrosis. Unfortunately, there are no approved therapies for NAFLD or NASH and therefore therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Niclosamide is an U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anthelmintic drug that mediates its effect by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation. Niclosamide and its salt forms, Niclosamide  (NEN), and Niclosamide Piperazine (NPP) have shown efficacy in murine models of diet induced obesity characterized by attenuation of the prominent  disease phenotype and improved glucose metabolism. While the exact mechanism(s) underlying these changes remains unclear, the ability to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation leading to increased energy expenditure and lipid metabolism or attenuation of PKA mediated glucagon signaling in the  have been proposed. Unfortunately, niclosamide has very poor water solubility, leading to low oral bioavailability. This, in addition to mitochondrial uncoupling activity and potential genotoxicity have reduced enthusiasm for its clinical use. More recently, salt forms of niclosamide, NEN and NPP, have demonstrated improved oral bioavailability while retaining activity. This suggests that development of safer more effective niclosamide derivatives for the treatment of NAFLD and Type 2 Diabetes may be possible. Herein we explored the ability of a series of N-substituted phenylbenzamide derivatives of the niclosamide salicylanilide chemotype to attenuate hepatic steatosis using a novel phenotypic in vitro model of  and the high fat diet-fed mouse model of diet induced obesity. These studies identified novel compounds with improved pre-clinical properties that attenuate hepatic steatosis in vitro and in vivo.

Looking for prodrugs that could progressively release PEA to maintain effective plasma concentrations, we prepared carbonates, esters and carbamates at the hydroxyl group of PEA. Chemical stability (pH 7.4) and stability in rat plasma and  homogenate were evaluated by in vitro assays. Carbonates and carbamates resulted too labile and too resistant in plasma, respectively. Ester derivatives, prepared by conjugating PEA with various amino acids, allowed to modulate the kinetics of PEA release in plasma and stability in  homogenate. L-Val-PEA, with suitable PEA release in plasma, and D-Val-PEA, with high resistance to hepatic degradation, were orally administered to rats and plasma levels of prodrugs and PEA were measured at different time points. Both prodrugs showed significant release of PEA, but provided lower plasma concentrations than those obtained with equimolar doses of PEA.

The lipid assay showed a rise in  free cholesterol content anda significant reduction in cholesterol esters level. Analyzing   acid composition, a decrease in polyunsaturated of  acid (PUFA) level and an increase in monounsaturated  acid (MUFA) content was found.  acid imbalance with high content of MUFA was associated with elevated level ofprotein carbonylation. The NSE administration (50 mg/kg of body weight) for 2 weeks decreased free cholesterol content, increased cholesterol esters level and reduced free oleic  acid content in the  of rats with IR. The effect of NSE on lipid imbalance led to a decrease in protein carbonylation level that may result in improvement of transmembrane protein function under obesity-induced insulin resistance state.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27438910>Fenofibrate nanoliposome: Preparation and its inhibitory effects on nonalcoholic  disease in mice.</a></h2><p>The aim was to prepare fenofibrate nanoliposome (FNB-Nanolipo) and investigate its characterizations, oral pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles as well as preventive and therapeutic effects on nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) induced by a methionine choline deficient (MCD) diet in mice. The prepared FNB-Nanolipo showed high drug loading capacity and sustained in vitro FNB release profile. Compared to FNB crude drug at equal doses, the FNB-Nanolipo given at 20 mg/kg/day (beginning on the same day when the MCD diet feeding started and lasted for 7 days) or 40 mg/kg/day (beginning after 7 days of the MCD diet feeding and lasting for another 7 days together with the MCD diet) increased plasma FNB concentration of the mice by 11.8-fold (P<0.05) or 57.3-fold (P<0.001), respectively, and reduced 54.7% (P<0.05) or 35.5% (P<0.05) of excessive hepatic lipid, respectively. The results suggest that the FNB-Nanolipo could not only significantly prevent but also efficiently treat NAFLD.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The growing rates of HCC may be partially attributable to increased numbers of people with non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, details of the -specific molecular mechanisms responsible for the NAFLD-NASH-HCC progression remain unclear, and mouse models that can be used to explore the exact factors that influence the progression of NAFLD/NASH to the more chronic stages of  disease and subsequent HCC are not yet fully established. We have previously reported a choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet (CDAHFD) as a dietary NASH model with rapidly progressive  fibrosis in mice. The current study in C57BL/6J mice fed CDAHFD provided evidence for the chronic persistence of advanced hepatic fibrosis in NASH and disease progression towards HCC in a period of 36 weeks. When mice fed CDAHFD were switched back to a standard diet, hepatic steatosis was normalized and NAFLD activity score improved, but HCC incidence increased and the phenotype of fibrosis-associated HCC development was observed. Moreover, when mice continued to be fed CDAHFD for 60 weeks, HCC further developed without severe body weight loss or carcinogenesis in other organs. The autochthonous tumours showed a variety of histological features and architectural patterns including trabecular, pseudoglandular and solid growth. The CDAHFD mouse model might be a useful tool for studying the development of HCC from NAFLD/NASH, and potentially useful for better understanding pathological changes during hepatocarcinogenesis.© 2017 The Authors.

Several studies have shown that wheatgrass extract Triticum aestivum (TA) improves lipid metabolism. In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of GM-T (an ethanolic TA extract) in a murine NAFLD model. Mice were separated into 12 groups (n = 10): two groups of normal diet, choline-deficient diet (CDD) or high-fat diet (HFD) with vehicle, CCD or HFD with silymarin (400 mg kg day ), and CCD or HFD with GM-T (100, 200 or 400 mg kg day ). The study was performed for 8 weeks for the CDD groups and 12 weeks for the HFD groups.In the CDD-fed mice, GM-T improved serum  enzyme activities and  inflammation score compared to vehicle. In the HFD-fed mice, GM-T improved blood lipid profiles,  inflammation score, steatosis score and obesity compared to vehicle.The present study demonstrated that GM-T effectively improved NAFLD in mice via a mechanism that improved insulin resistance and lipid metabolism, suggesting the possibility of a functional dietary supplement to improve  health, overall metabolic syndrome and obesity. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25670825>Free  acid availability is closely related to myocardial lipid storage and cardiac function in hypoglycemia counterregulation.</a></h2><p>Hypoglycemia, a major side effect of intensive glucose-lowering therapy, was recently linked to increased cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes. Whether increased circulating free  acids (FFA) owing to catecholamine-induced lipolysis affect myocardial energy metabolism and thus link hypoglycemia to cardiac vulnerability is unclear. Therefore, this study investigated the impact of hypoglycemia counterregulation (± inhibition of lipolysis) on myocardial lipid content (MYCL) and left ventricular function in healthy subjects. Nine healthy men were studied in randomized order: 1) insulin/hypoglycemia test (IHT; ins+/aci-), 2) IHT during inhibition of adipose tissue lipolysis by acipimox (ins+/aci+), 3) normoglycemia with acipimox (ins-/aci+), and 4) normoglycemia with placebo (ins-/aci-). MYCL and cardiac function were assessed by employing magnetic resonance spectroscopy/imaging at baseline and at 2 and 6 h. In response to acute hypoglycemia, plasma FFA (P<0.0001) and ejection fraction (EF; from 63.2±5.5 to 69.6±6.3%, P=0.0001) increased significantly and were tightly correlated with each other (r=0.68, P=0.0002); this response was completely blunted by inhibition of adipose tissue lipolysis. In the presence of normoglycemia, inhibition of lipolysis was associated with a drop in EF (from 59.2±5.5 to 53.9±6.9%,P=0.005) and a significant decrease in plasma FFA, triglycerides, and MYCL (by 48.5%, P=0.0001). The present data indicate that an intact interorgan cross-talk between adipose tissue and the heart is a prerequisite for catecholamine-mediated myocardial contractility and preservation of myocardial lipid stores in response to acute hypoglycemia.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29111158>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis induces transient changes within the  macrophage pool.</a></h2><p>Kupffer cells (KCs) and monocyte-derived macrophages are implicated in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) pathogenesis but their functions remain unclear due to the lack of specific markers to distinguish between the different cell types. Additionally, it is unclear if multiple subsets of KCs are present during NASH. Here, we characterized the  macrophage subsets during methionine/choline deficient (MCD) diet-induced NASH and recovery. We observed a significant reduced contribution of Ly6CClec4FTim4KCs to the hepatic macrophage pool in MCD fed mice, which normalized during recovery. Ly6CClec4FTim4 monocyte-derived macrophages increased during MCD feeding and returned to baseline during recovery. Ly6CClec4FTim4 monocyte-derived KCs developed during initial recovery but did not self-renew as their numbers were reduced after full recovery. Initial recovery from MCD diet feeding was further characterized by increased proportions of Ki-67 proliferating KCs. In conclusion, the hepatic macrophage pool undergoes substantial albeit transient changes during NASH and recovery, with the KC pool being maintained by proliferation and differentiation of short-lived monocyte-derived KCs.Copyright © 2017.

PC is also required for the secretion of lipoprotein particles from  and intestine. Choline requirements are increased during lactation when maternal choline is supplied to the offspring through breast milk. To investigate the effect of dietary choline on intestinal lipid metabolism during lactation, choline-supplemented (CS), phosphatidylcholine-supplemented (PCS) or choline-deficient (CD) diets were fed to dams during the suckling period. CD dams had lower plasma triacylglycerol, cholesterol and apoB in the fasted state and following a fat-challenge (P < .05). There was a higher content of neutral lipids and lower content of PC in the intestine of CD dams, compared with CS and PCS fed animals (P < .05). In addition, there was lower (P < .05) villus height in CD dams, which indicated a reduced absorptive surface area in the intestine. Choline is critical for the absorption of fat in lactating rats and choline deficiency alters intestinal morphology and impairs chylomicron secretion by limiting the supply of PC.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Detailed characterization and comparison of the complete set of metabolites of these two species are critical for their objective identification and quality control. In this study, a rapid, simple and comprehensive (1)H NMR-based metabolomics method was first developed to differentiate the two species. A broad range of metabolites, including iridoid glycosides, xanthones, triterpenoids, flavonoids, carbohydrates, and amino acids, were identified. Statistical analysis showed evident differences between the two species, and the major markers responsible for the differences were screened. In addition, quantitative (1)H NMR method (qHNMR) was used for the target analysis of the discriminating metabolites. The results showed that S. mussotii had significantly higher contents of gentiopicrin, isoorientin, glucose, loganic acid, and choline, whereas S. chirayita exhibited higher levels of swertiamarin, oleanolic acid, valine, and  acids. These findings indicate that (1)H NMR-based metabolomics is a reliable and effective method for the metabolic profiling and discrimination of the two Swertia species, and can be used to verify the genuine origin of Zangyinchen.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we investigated the effect of PPAR activation on circulating and urinary one-carbon metabolites as well as markers of B-vitamin status. Male Wistar rats (n = 20) received for 50 weeks either a high-fat control diet or a high-fat diet with tetradecylthioacetic acid (TTA), a modified  acid and pan-PPAR agonist with high affinity towards PPARα. Hepatic gene expression of PPARα, PPARβ/δ and the enzymes involved in the choline oxidation pathway were analyzed and concentrations of metabolites were analyzed in plasma and urine. TTA treatment altered most biomarkers, and the largest effect sizes were observed for plasma concentrations of dimethylglycine, nicotinamide, methylnicotinamide, methylmalonic acid and pyridoxal, which were all higher in the TTA group (all p < 0.01).

Adolph Strecker noted in 1862 that when lecithin from bile was heated, it generated a new nitrogenous chemical that he named 'choline'. Three years later, Oscar Liebreich identified a new substance, 'neurine', in the brain. After a period of confusion, neurine and choline were found to be the same molecule, and the name choline was adapted. Lecithin was eventually characterized chemically as being phosphatidylcholine. In 1954, Eugene Kennedy described the cytidine 5-dihphosphocholine pathway by which choline is incorporated into phosphatidylcholine. A second route, the phosphatidylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase pathway, was identified by Jon Bremer and David Greenberg in 1960. The role of choline as part of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine was established by Otto Loewi and Henry Dale. Working in the 1930s at the University of Toronto, Charles Best showed that choline prevented  in dogs and rats. The importance of choline as an essential nutrient for human health was determined in the 1990s through controlled feeding studies in humans.

Dietary 100 ppm PFOS fed to male mice and rats for 4 weeks caused hepatic steatosis through an unknown mechanism. Choline deficient diets can cause hepatic steatosis. A hepatic choline:PFOS ion complex was hypothesized to cause this effect in mice. This study tested whether dietary choline supplementation attenuates PFOS-induced hepatic steatosis in rats. Sprague Dawley rats (12/sex/group) were fed control, choline supplemented (CS), 100 ppm PFOS, or 100 ppm PFOS + CS diets for 3 weeks. Male rats fed both PFOS-containing diets had decreased serum cholesterol and triglycerides (TGs) on days 9, 16, and/or 23 and increased hepatic free  acids and TG (ie, steatosis). Female rats fed both PFOS diets had decreased serum cholesterol on days 9 and 16 and decreased hepatic free  acid and TG at termination (ie, no steatosis).  PFOS concentrations were similar for both sexes.  choline concentrations were increased in male rats fed PFOS (±CS), but the increase was lower in the PFOS + CS group. Female  choline concentrations were not altered by any diet. These findings demonstrate a clear sex-related difference in PFOS-induced hepatic steatosis in the rat. Additional evaluated mechanisms (ie, nuclear receptor activation, mRNA upregulation, and choline kinase activity inhibition) did not appear to be involved in the hepatic steatosis. Dietary PFOS (100 ppm) induced hepatic steatosis in male, but not female, rats that was not attenuated by choline supplementation. The mechanism of lipid accumulation and the sex-related differences warrant further investigation.© The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society of Toxicology.

The  and the muscles appear to be the major organs for methyl group metabolism. Choline can be synthesized from phosphatidylcholine via the cytidine-diphosphate (CDP) pathway.

Studies that simulated methyl-deficient diets reported disturbances in energy metabolism and protein synthesis in the , , or muscle disorders. Changes in plasma concentrations of total homocysteine (tHcy) reflect one aspect of the metabolic consequences of methyl group deficiency or nutrient supplementations. Folic acid supplementation spares betaine as a methyl donor. Betaine is a significant determinant of plasma tHcy, particularly in case of folate deficiency, methionine load, or alcohol consumption. Betaine supplementation has a lowering effect on post-methionine load tHcy. Hypomethylation and tHcy elevation can be attenuated when choline or betaine is available.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051256>Protective effects and mechanisms of total alkaloids of Rubus alceaefolius Poir on non‑alcoholic  disease in rats.</a></h2><p>The plant Rubus alceaefolius Poir is used as a hepatic protectant in Traditional Chinese Medicine.

To generate the NAFLD model, Sprague-Dawley rats were administered a high‑fat diet and following 12 weeks of model construction, rats were orally treated with a positive control drug and different doses of TARAP daily for 28 days. The rats were then sacrificed and the livers were collected to evaluate the  index (LI) and observe histological changes by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. The secretion levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in serum were examined by ELISA. Finally, the expression levels of leptin (LEP), resistin and adiponectin (APN) in  tissues were determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The results demonstrated that, in the group treated with methionine and choline bitartrate tablets and in the groups treated with different doses of TARAP, there was a significant reduction in the LI (P<0.05 or P<0.01), a downregulation of the secretion levels of ALT and AST, reduced levels of LEP and resistin and an increased expression of APN in the  of NAFLD rats compared with the model group. Furthermore, the effect of TARAP treatment of NAFLD rats was dose dependent. In conclusion, TARAP is a potential agent for downregulating LEP and resistin and upregulating APN expression in rats with NAFLD.

Fibrosis is the consequence of chronic tissue damage and inflammation. We hypothesized that deficiency of miR-155, a master regulator of inflammation, attenuates steatohepatitis and fibrosis.Wild type (WT) and miR-155-deficient (KO) mice were fed methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) or -supplemented (MCS) control diet for 5 weeks.  injury, inflammation, steatosis and fibrosis were assessed.MCD diet resulted in steatohepatitis and increased miR-155 expression in total , hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. Steatosis and expression of genes involved in  acid metabolism were attenuated in miR-155 KO mice after MCD feeding. In contrast, miR-155 deficiency failed to attenuate inflammatory cell infiltration, nuclear factor κ beta (NF-κB) activation and enhanced the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1) in MCD diet-fed mice. We found a significant attenuation of apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3) and reduction in collagen and α smooth muscle actin (αSMA) levels in miR-155 KO mice compared to WTs on MCD diet.

To determine whether circulating  acids could serve as diagnostic markers of NAFLD severity and whether specific  acids could contribute to the pathogenesis of NASH, we analyzed two independent NAFLD patient cohorts and used the methionine- and choline-deficient diet (MCD) NASH mouse model. We identified six  acids that could serve as non-invasive markers of NASH in patients with NAFLD. Serum levels of 15:0, 17:0 and 16:1n7t negatively correlated with NAFLD activity scores and hepatocyte ballooning scores, while 18:1n7c serum levels strongly correlated with fibrosis stage and  inflammation. Serum levels of 15:0 and 17:0 also negatively correlated with fasting glucose and AST, while 16:1n7c and 18:1n7c levels positively correlated with AST and ferritin, respectively. Inclusion of demographic and clinical parameters improved the performance of the  acid panels in detecting NASH in NAFLD patients. The panel [15:0, 16:1n7t, 18:1n7c, 22:5n3, age, ferritin and APRI] predicted intermediate or advanced fibrosis in NAFLD patients, with 82% sensitivity at 90% specificity [AUROC = 0.92]. 15:0 and 18:1n7c were further selected for functional studies in vivo.

We explored its function in regulating adipose tissue lipolysis, which influences fat accumulation by  and muscle and overall metabolism. Knockdown of CD36 in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes decreased lipolysis in response to 10 μM of the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (by 42%), 10 μM of the adenyl cyclase activator forskolin (by 32%), and 500 μM of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine (by 33%). All three treatments in the knockdown adipocytes were associated with significant decreases of cAMP levels and of the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and perilipin phosphorylation. An important role for PDE was supported by the lack of inhibition of the lipolysis induced by the poorly hydrolyzable dibutyryl cAMP analog. An additional contributory mechanism was diminished activation of the Src-ERK1/2 pathway. Regulation of lipolysis and lipolytic signaling by CD36 was reproduced with adipose tissue from CD36(-/-) mice. The importance of surface CD36 in this regulation was suggested by the finding that the plasma membrane-impermeable CD36 inhibitor sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate (20 μM) decreased lipolysis. Interestingly, isoproterenol induced CD36 internalization, and this process was blocked by HSL inhibition, suggesting feedback regulation of adipocyte lipolysis via CD36 trafficking.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26013469>Platelet-activating factor modulates fat storage in the  induced by a high-refined carbohydrate-containing diet.</a></h2><p>Hepatic diseases are comorbidities caused by obesity and are influenced by diet composition.

Signal intensity ratios for phosphomonoesters (PME) including phosphoethanolamine (PE), phosphodiesters (PDE) including glycerophosphocholine (GPC), total nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) including α-NTP, and inorganic phosphate (Pi), expressed relative to total phosphate (TP) or [PME+PDE] and converted to percentage, were obtained.Compared to controls, both NAFLD groups had increased PDE/TP (p<0.001) and decreased Pi/TP (p=0.011). Non-NASH patients showed decreased PE/[PME+PDE] (p=0.048), increased GPC/[PME+PDE] (p<0.001), and normal NTP/TP and α-NTP/TP. Whereas, NASH patients had normal PE/[PME+PDE] and GPC/[PME+PDE], but decreased NTP/TP (p=0.004) and α-NTP/TP (p<0.001). The latter was significantly different between non-NASH and NASH (p=0.047) and selected as discriminating parameter, with area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve of 0.71 (95% confidence interval, 0.62-0.79). An α-NTP/TP cutoff of 16.36% gave 91% sensitivity and cutoff of 10.57% gave 91% specificity for NASH.(31)P-MRS shows distinct biochemical changes in different NAFLD states, and has fair diagnostic accuracy for NASH.Copyright © 2013 European Association for the Study of the .

Adrenergic signalling also is an important regulator of hepatic metabolism and function. However, currently little is known about the potential role of adrenergic signaling on hepatic autophagy, and whether the β-adrenergic receptor itself may be a key regulator of autophagy. To address these issues, we investigated the actions of the β2-adrenergic receptor agonist, clenbuterol on hepatic autophagy. Surprisingly, we found that clenbuterol stimulated autophagy and autophagic flux in hepatoma cells, primary hepatocytes and in vivo. Similar effects also were observed with epinephrine treatment. Interestingly, propranolol caused a late block in autophagy in the absence and presence of clenbuterol, both in cell culture and in vivo. Thus, our results demonstrate that the β2-adrenergic receptor is a key regulator of hepatic autophagy, and that the β-blocker propranolol can independently induce a late block in autophagy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24368431>Choline supplementation protects against  damage by normalizing cholesterol metabolism in Pemt/Ldlr knockout mice fed a high-fat diet.</a></h2><p>Dietary choline is required for proper structure and dynamics of cell membranes, lipoprotein synthesis, and methyl-group metabolism. In mammals, choline is synthesized via phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (Pemt), which converts phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine. Pemt(-/-) mice have impaired VLDL secretion and developed  when fed a high-fat (HF) diet. Because of the reduction in plasma lipids, Pemt(-/-)/low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout (Ldlr(-/-)) mice are protected from atherosclerosis. The goal of this study was to investigate the importance of dietary choline in the metabolic phenotype of Pemt(-/-)/Ldlr(-/-) male mice. At 10-12 wk of age, Pemt(+/+)/Ldlr(-/-) (HF(+/+)) and half of the Pemt(-/-)/Ldlr(-/-) (HF(-/-)) mice were fed an HF diet with normal (1.3 g/kg) choline. The remaining Pemt(-/-)/Ldlr(-/-) mice were fed an HF diet supplemented (5 g/kg) with choline (HFCS(-/-) mice). The HF diet contained 60% of calories from fat and 1% cholesterol, and the mice were fed for 16 d. HF(-/-) mice lost weight and developed hepatomegaly, steatohepatitis, and  damage. Hepatic concentrations of free cholesterol, cholesterol-esters, and triglyceride (TG) were elevated by 30%, 1.1-fold and 3.1-fold, respectively, in HF(-/-) compared with HF(+/+) mice. Choline supplementation normalized hepatic cholesterol, but not TG, and dramatically improved  function. The expression of genes involved in cholesterol transport and esterification increased by 50% to 5.6-fold in HF(-/-) mice when compared with HF(+/+) mice. Markers of macrophages, oxidative stress, and fibrosis were elevated in the HF(-/-) mice. Choline supplementation normalized the expression of these genes. In conclusion, HF(-/-) mice develop  failure associated with altered cholesterol metabolism when fed an HF/normal choline diet. Choline supplementation normalized cholesterol metabolism, which was sufficient to prevent nonalcoholic steatohepatitis development and improve  function. Our data suggest that choline can promote  health by maintaining cholesterol homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24196353>Adrenergic metabolic and hemodynamic effects of octopamine in the .</a></h2><p>The fruit extracts of Citrus aurantium (bitter orange) are traditionally used as weight-loss products and as appetite suppressants. A component of these extracts is octopamine, which is an adrenergic agent. Weight-loss and adrenergic actions are always related to metabolic changes and this work was designed to investigate a possible action of octopamine on  metabolism. The isolated perfused rat  was used to measure catabolic and anabolic pathways and hemodynamics. Octopamine increased glycogenolysis, glycolysis, oxygen uptake, gluconeogenesis and the portal perfusion pressure. Octopamine also accelerated the oxidation of exogenous  acids (octanoate and oleate), as revealed by the increase in ¹⁴CO₂ production derived from ¹⁴C labeled precursors. The changes in glycogenolysis, oxygen uptake and perfusion pressure were almost completely abolished by α₁-adrenergic antagonists. The same changes were partly sensitive to the β-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. It can be concluded that octopamine accelerates both catabolic and anabolic processes in the  via adrenergic stimulation. Acceleration of oxygen uptake under substrate-free perfusion conditions also means acceleration of the oxidation of endogenous  acids, which are derived from lipolysis. All these effects are compatible with an overall stimulating effect of octopamine on metabolism, which is compatible with its reported weight-loss effects in experimental animals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24708244>GH administration rescues  regeneration impairment by restoring GH/EGFR pathway deficiency.</a></h2><p>GH pathway has been shown to play a major role in  regeneration through the control of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation. This pathway is down-regulated in nonalcoholic  disease. Because regeneration is known to be impaired in  livers, we wondered whether a deregulation of the GH/EGFR pathway could explain this deficiency. Hepatic EGFR expression and triglyceride levels were quantified in  biopsies of 32 obese patients with different degrees of steatosis. We showed a significant inverse correlation between  EGFR expression and the level of hepatic steatosis. GH/EGFR down-regulation was also demonstrated in 2 steatosis mouse models, a genetic (ob/ob) and a methionine and choline-deficient diet mouse model, in correlation with  regeneration defect. ob/ob mice exhibited a more severe  regeneration defect after partial hepatectomy (PH) than methionine and choline-deficient diet-fed mice, a difference that could be explained by a decrease in signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 phosphorylation 32 hours after PH. Having checked that GH deficiency accounted for the GH signaling pathway down-regulation in the  of ob/ob mice, we showed that GH administration in these mice led to a partial rescue in hepatocyte proliferation after PH associated with a concomitant restoration of  EGFR expression and signal transducer and activator of trnascription 3 activation. In conclusion, we propose that the GH/EGFR pathway down-regulation is a general mechanism responsible for  regeneration deficiency associated with steatosis, which could be partially rescued by GH administration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27604106>Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Modulates Membrane Protein Retrieval and Insertion Processes.</a></h2><p>Interindividual variability in drug response in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) can be mediated by altered regulation of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters. Among these is the mislocalization of multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP2)/Mrp2 away from the canalicular membrane, which results in decreased transport of MRP2/Mrp2 substrates. The exact mechanism of this mislocalization is unknown, although increased activation of membrane retrieval processes may be one possibility. The current study measures the activation status of various mediators implicated in the active membrane retrieval or insertion of membrane proteins to identify which processes may be important in rodent methionine and choline deficient diet-induced NASH. The mediators currently known to be associated with transporter mislocalization are stimulated by oxidative stressors and choleretic stimuli, which play a role in the pathogenesis of NASH. The activation of protein kinases PKA, PKCα, PKCδ, and PKCε and substrates radixin, myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate, and Rab11 were measured by comparing the expression, phosphorylation, and membrane translocation between control and NASH. Many of the mediators exhibited altered activation in NASH rats. Consistent with membrane retrieval of Mrp2, NASH rats exhibited a decreased phosphorylation of radixin and increased membrane localization of PKCδ and PKCε, thought to be mediators of radixin dephosphorylation. Altered activation of PKCδ, PKA, and PKCα may impair the Rab11-mediated active insertion of Mrp2. Overall, these data suggest alterations in membrane retrieval and insertion processes that may contribute to altered localization of membrane proteins in NASH.Copyright © 2016 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23200476>Effect of rumen-protected choline supplementation on  and adipose gene expression during the transition period in dairy cattle.</a></h2><p>We previously reported that supplementation of rumen-protected choline (RPC) reduces the hepatic triacylglycerol concentration in periparturient dairy cows during early lactation. Here, we investigated the effect of RPC on the transcript levels of lipid metabolism-related genes in  and adipose tissue biopsies, taken at wk -3, 1, 3, and 6 after calving, to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this RPC-induced reduction of hepatic lipidosis. Sixteen multiparous cows were blocked into 8 pairs and randomly allocated to either 1 of 2 treatments, with or without RPC. Treatments were applied from 3 wk before to 6 wk after calving. Both groups received a basal diet and concentrate mixture. One group received RPC supplementation, resulting in an intake of 14.4 g of choline per day, whereas controls received an isoenergetic mixture of palm oil and additional soybean meal.  and adipose tissue biopsies were taken at wk -3, 1, 3, and 6 to determine the mRNA abundance of 18 key genes involved in  and adipose tissue lipid and energy metabolism. Milk samples were collected in wk 1, 2, 3, and 6 postpartum for analysis of milk  acid (FA) composition. The RPC-induced reduction in hepatic lipidosis could not be attributed to altered lipolysis in adipose tissue, as no treatment effect was observed on the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, lipoprotein lipase, or FA synthase in adipose tissue, or on the milk FA composition. Rumen-protected choline supplementation increased the expression of FA transport protein 5 and carnitine transporter SLC22A5 in the , suggesting an increase in the capacity of FA uptake and intracellular transport, but no treatment effect was observed on carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A, transporting long-chain FA into mitochondria. In the same organ, RPC appeared to promote apolipoprotein B-containing lipoprotein assembly, as shown by elevated microsomal triglyceride transfer protein expression and apolipoprotein B100 expression. Cows supplemented with RPC displayed elevated levels of glucose transporter 2 mRNA and a reduced peak in pyruvate carboxylase mRNA immediately after calving, showing that supplementation also resulted in improved carbohydrate metabolism. The results from this study suggest that RPC supplementation reduces  triacylglycerol by improved FA processing and very-low-density lipoprotein synthesis, and RPC also benefits hepatic carbohydrate metabolism.Copyright © 2013 American Dairy Science Association.

C57BL/6 Gadd45a-null and wild-type (WT) mice were treated with a methionine and choline-deficient diet (MCD) for eight weeks and phenotypic changes examined. Gadd45a-null mice had more severe hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, higher levels of mRNAs encoding pro-inflammatory, pro-fibrotic, and pro-apoptotic proteins, and greater oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress compared with WT mice. Indeed, Gadd45a mRNA was induced in response to ER stress in primary hepatocytes. Lipidomic analysis of NASH livers demonstrated decreased triacylglycerol (TG) in MCD-treated Gadd45a-null mice, which was associated with increased mRNAs encoding phospholipase D (Pld1/2), phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2A, and choline/ phosphotransferase 1 (Cept1), involved in the phosphatidylcholine-phosphatidic acid-diacylglycerol cycle, and decreased mRNAs encoding  acid (FA)-binding protein 1 (Fabp1) and FA transport protein 5. Treatment of cultured primary hepatocytes with tumor necrosis factor α, transforming growth factor β, and hydrogen peroxide led to the corresponding induction of Fabp1, Pld1/2, and Cept1 mRNAs. Collectively, Gadd45α plays protective roles against MCD-induced NASH likely due to attenuating cellular stress and ensuing inflammatory signaling. These results also suggest an interconnection between hepatocyte injury, inflammation and disrupted glycerophospholipid/FA metabolism that yields a possible mechanism for decreased TG accumulation with NASH progression (i.e., "burned-out" NASH).Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24019886>Sympathetic nervous system catecholamines and neuropeptide Y neurotransmitters are upregulated in human NAFLD and modulate the fibrogenic function of hepatic stellate cells.</a></h2><p>Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) signalling regulates murine hepatic fibrogenesis through effects on hepatic stellate cells (HSC), and obesity-related hypertension with SNS activation accelerates progression of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD), the commonest cause of chronic  disease. NAFLD may lead to cirrhosis.

The effects of NE/EPI/NPY and adrenoceptor antagonists prazosin (PRZ)/propranolol (PRL) on hHSC fibrogenic functions and the involved kinases and interleukin pathways were examined. Human livers with proven NAFLD were then assessed for upregulation of SNS signalling components.Activated hHSC express functional α/β-adrenoceptors and NPY receptors, which are upregulated in the livers of patients with cirrhotic NAFLD. hHSC in culture synthesize and release NE/EPI, required for their optimal basal growth and survival. Exogenous NE/EPI and NPY dose-dependently induced hHSC proliferation, mediated via p38 MAP, PI3K and MEK signalling. NE and EPI but not NPY increased expression of collagen-1α2 via TGF-β without involvement of the pro-fibrogenic cytokines leptin, IL-4 and IL-13 or the anti-fibrotic cytokine IL-10.hHSC synthesize and require cathecholamines for optimal survival and fibrogenic functionality. Activated hHSC express directly fibrogenic α/β-adrenoceptors and NPY receptors, upregulated in human cirrhotic NAFLD.

In this study, we investigated the effects of choline (5, 35 and 70 μM) on DNA methylation modifications, mRNA expression of the critical genes and their enzyme activities involved in hepatic lipid metabolism, mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in C3A cells exposed to excessive energy substrates (lactate, 10 mM; octanoate, 2 mM and pyruvate, 1 mM; lactate, octanoate and pyruvate-supplemented medium (LOP)). Thirty five micromole or 70 μM choline alone, instead of a low dose (5 μM), reduced hepatocellular triglyceride (TG) accumulation, protected Δψm from decrement and increased GSH-Px activity in C3A cells. The increment of TG accumulation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and Δψm disruption were observed under LOP treatment in C3A cells after 72 h of culture, which were counteracted by concomitant treatment of choline (35 μM or 70 μM) partially via reversing the methylation status of the peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) gene promoter, upregulating PPARα, carnitine palmitoyl transferase-I (CPT-I) and downregulating  acid synthase (FAS) gene expression, as well as decreasing FAS activity and increasing CPT-I and GSH-Px activities.

But its mechanism remains unclear. Hepatic steatosis is associated with abnormal expression of genes involved in hepatic lipid metabolism. DNA methylation contributes to the disregulation of gene expression. Here we hypothesized that betaine supplement and subsequent DNA methylation modifications alter the expression of genes that are involved in hepatic lipid metabolism and hence alleviate hepatic triglyceride accumulation.Male wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice (n = 6) were fed with the AIN-93 G diet. ApoE-/- mice (n = 12), weight-matched with the WT mice, were divided into two groups (n = 6 per group), and fed with the AIN-93 G diet and AIN-93 G supplemented with 2% betaine/100 g diet. Seven weeks after the intervention, mice were sacrificed.  betaine, choline, homocysteine concentration were measured by HPLC.  oxidants activity and triglyceride level were assessed by ultraviolet spectrophotometry. Finally, hepatic PPAR alpha gene and its target genes expression levels and the methylation status of the PPAR alpha gene were determined.ApoE-/- mice had higher hepatic triglyceride and lower GSH-Px activity when compared with the WT mice. Betaine intervention reversed triglyceride deposit, enhanced SOD and GSH-Px activity in the . Interestingly, mice fed on betaine-supplemented diet showed a dramatic increase of hepatic choline concentration and a decrease of betaine and homocysteine concentration relative to the WT mice and the ApoE-/- mice absent with betaine intervention. Expression of PPAR alpha and CPT1 were decreased and expression of FAS was markedly increased in ApoE-/- mice. In parallel, PPAR alpha promoter methylation level were slightly increased in ApoE-/- mice though without significance. Betaine supplement upregulated expression of PPAR alpha and its target genes (CPT1, CYP2E1) and reversed hypermethylation of PPAR alpha promoter of ApoE-/- mice. Furthermore, PPAR alpha methylation was positively correlated with hepatic betaine concentration.Our findings indicate that betaine supplement could alleviate hepatic triglyceride accumulation and improve antioxidant capacity by decreasing PPAR alpha promoter methylation and upregulating PPAR alpha and its target genes mRNA expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23439292>Influence of rumen-protected choline on  composition and blood variables indicating energy balance in periparturient dairy cows.</a></h2><p>Rumen-protected choline (RPC) was evaluated for effects on the lipid and glycogen content of the  and metabolic variables in the blood plasma of dairy cows.

The catechins activate adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and thereby increase  acid oxidation in  and skeletal muscles. Green tea catechins have also been shown to reduce body fat in humans. However, the effect of the catechins on lipolysis in adipose tissue has not been fully understood. The aim of this study was to clarify the effect of green tea catechins on lipolysis in adipocytes and to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Differentiated mouse adipocyte cell line (3T3-L1) was stimulated with green tea catechins in the presence or absence of norepinephrine. Glycerol and free  acids in the media were measured. Phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) was determined by Western blotting, and the mRNA expression levels of HSL, adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), and perilipin were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. The cells were treated with inhibitors of protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), protein kinase G (PKG), or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) to determine the responsible pathway. Treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with green tea catechins increased the level of glycerol and free  acids released into the media in the presence, but not absence, of norepinephrine, and increased the level of phosphorylated HSL in the cells. The catechins also increased mRNA and protein levels of HSL and ATGL. PKA inhibitor (H89) attenuated the catechin-induced increase in glycerol release and HSL phosphorylation. The results demonstrate that green tea catechins enhance lipolysis in the presence of norepinephrine via a PKA-dependent pathway in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, providing a potential mechanism by which green tea catechins could reduce body fat.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

It is well established that genetic and gender-specific variations in one-carbon metabolism contribute to the vulnerability to NAFLD in humans. To examine the role of one-carbon metabolism dysregulation in the pathogenesis and individual susceptibility to NAFLD, we used a "population-based" mouse model where male mice from 7 inbred were fed a choline- and folate-deficient (CFD) diet for 12 wk. Strain-dependent down-regulation of several key one-carbon metabolism genes, including methionine adenosyltransferase 1α (Mat1a), cystathionine-β-synthase (Cbs), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (Mthfr), adenosyl-homocysteinase (Ahcy), and methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1 (Mthfd1), was observed. These changes were strongly associated with interstrain variability in  injury (steatosis, necrosis, inflammation, and activation of fibrogenesis) and hyperhomocysteinemia. Mechanistically, the decreased expression of Mat1a, Ahcy, and Mthfd1 was linked to a reduced level and promoter binding of transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β (CEBPβ), which directly regulates their transcription. The strain specificity of diet-induced dysregulation of one-carbon metabolism suggests that interstrain variation in the regulation of one-carbon metabolism may contribute to the differential vulnerability to NFLD and that correcting the imbalance may be considered as preventive and treatment strategies for NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30591150>n-3 polyunsaturated N-acylethanolamines are CB cannabinoid receptor-preferring endocannabinoids.</a></h2><p>Anandamide, the first identified endogenous cannabinoid and TRPV1 agonist, is one of a series of endogenous N-acylethanolamines, NAEs.

This range of NAEs was also tested in rapid response assays of CB, CB cannabinoid and TRPV1 receptors. The data indicate that PEA, SEA and OEA are not endocannabinoids or endovanilloids, and that the higher endogenous levels of these metabolites compared to polyunsaturated analogues are a correlate of their slow rates of hydrolysis. The n-6 NAEs (AEA, docosatetraenoyl and docosapentaenoyl derivatives) activated both CB and CB receptors, as well as TRPV1 channels, suggesting them to be 'genuine' endocannabinoids and 'endovanilloids'. The n-3 NAEs (eicosapentaenoyl, docosapentaenoyl and docosahexaenoyl derivatives) activated CB receptors and some n-3 NAEs (docosapentaenoyl and docosahexaenoyl derivatives) also activated TRPV1 channels, but failed to activate the CB receptor. We hypothesise that the preferential activation of CB receptors by n-3 PUFA NAEs contributes, at least in some part, to their broad anti-inflammatory profile.Copyright © 2018.

Hence, our study was designed to examine whether different one-carbon donors; betaine, choline, and folic acid would possess beneficial effects in NAFLD treatment. Rats were fed with high fat diet and NAFLD rats were orally treated with different doses of betaine or choline or folic acid for 28 days. All used one-carbon donors had dose-dependent ameliorating effects on NAFLD as they succeeded to reduce body and relative  weights, serum lipids and  enzymes. These were accompanied by decreasing hepatic fat accumulation and amending hepatic histological structure. They also improved serum and hepatic redox systems (total glutathione (tGSH), reduced GSH, oxidized GSSG, and GSH/GSSG ratio), hepatic S-adenosylmethionine/S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAM/SAH) ratio and increased hepatic global DNA methylation. There were some discrepancies in the dose and the extent of their effect, where folic acid showed the most prominent effects that could be mediated through the significant surge in hepatic SAM/SAH ratio and better efficient correction of one-carbon metabolism than the other donors. Thus, one-carbon donors can be strongly considered in NAFLD management and might influence the whole therapeutic approaches of  diseases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

N-trans-coumaroyloctopamine (1) and N-trans-feruloyloctopamine (2) were identified as the primary antioxidant constituents of garlic skin with high antioxidant activities. The aim of this study was to elucidate the protective effect and mechanism of the antioxidants on NASH in rats. The results provide morphological and molecular biological evidences for the protective role of the antioxidant 2 in ameliorating oxidative stress and hepatic apoptosis in experimental NASH for the first time. Mechanism study indicated that the antioxidant 2 significantly reduced the expression of COX-2 mRNA and protein by western blot, RT-PCR and immunohistochemical techniques.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

Previous studies have reported that genistein, a soy phytoestrogen, attenuates steatohepatitis induced in obese and type 2 diabetic models. Here we investigated the effect of dietary genistein supplementation (0.05%) on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) development induced by a methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet in db/db mice. MCD-diet-fed mice exhibited a significantly lower body weight and a higher degree of steatohepatitis with increased oxidative stress, steatosis, inflammation, stellate cell activation, and mild fibrosis. Although genistein did not inhibit hepatic steatosis, we observed that oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and AMP-dependent kinase inactivation were alleviated by genistein. Genistein also down-regulated the augmented gene expressions associated with hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. Therefore, these results suggest that genistein may protect MCD-diet-mediated NASH development by suppressing lipid peroxidation, inflammation, and even  fibrosis in db/db mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27423516>PEA and luteolin synergistically reduce mast cell-mediated toxicity and elicit neuroprotection in cell-based models of brain ischemia.</a></h2><p>The combination of palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), an endogenous  acid amide belonging to the family of the N-acylethanolamines, and the flavonoid luteolin has been found to exert neuroprotective activities in a variety of mouse models of neurological disorders, including brain ischemia. Indirect findings suggest that the two molecules can reduce the activation of mastocytes in brain ischemia, thus modulating crucial cells that trigger the inflammatory cascade. Though, no evidence exists about a direct effect of PEA and luteolin on mast cells in experimental models of brain ischemia, either used separately or in combination. In order to fill this gap, we developed a novel cell-based model of severe brain ischemia consisting of primary mouse cortical neurons and cloned mast cells derived from mouse fetal  (MC/9 cells) subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). OGD exposure promoted both mast cell degranulation and the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in a time-dependent fashion. MC/9 cells exacerbated neuronal damage in neuron-mast cells co-cultures exposed to OGD. Likewise, the conditioned medium derived from OGD-exposed MC/9 cells induced significant neurotoxicity in control primary neurons. PEA and luteolin pre-treatment synergistically prevented the OGD-induced degranulation of mast cells and reduced the neurotoxic potential of MC/9 cells conditioned medium. Finally, the association of the two drugs promoted a direct synergistic neuroprotection even in pure cortical neurons exposed to OGD. In summary, our results indicate that mast cells release neurotoxic factors upon OGD-induced activation. The association PEA-luteolin actively reduces mast cell-mediated neurotoxicity as well as pure neurons susceptibility to OGD.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

One aspect of hepatic alterations is caused by increased fecal loss of the essential nutrient choline, following enterohepatic bile phosphatidylcholine (PC) cycle impairment. Hepatic PC synthesis, both de novo and via phosphatidylethanolamine-N-methyl-transferase (PEMT), is essential for very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion. VLDL-PC in particular contributes to the organism's supply with polyunsaturated  acids (LC-PUFA), namely arachidonic (C20:4) and docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6). Consequently, choline deprivation and altered hepatic PC metabolism may affect plasma PC homeostasis and extrahepatic organ function.To investigate relationships between altered plasma choline and PC homeostasis and markers of lung function and inflammation in CF. To assess alterations in hepatic choline and PC metabolism of CF patients.Quantification of plasma/serum choline and PC species in adult CF patients compared to controls. Correlation of PC with forced expiratory vital capacity (FEV1) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) concentrations. Analysis of choline and PC metabolism in CF compared to controls, using deuterated choline ([D₉-methyl]-choline) labeling in vivo.Mean choline and PC concentrations in CF patients were lower than in controls. Choline and PC concentrations as well as fractions of C22:6-PC and C20:4-PC correlated directly with FEV1, but inversely with IL-6. Plasma concentrations of deuterated PC were decreased for both pathways, whereas only in PC synthesized via PEMT precursor enrichment was decreased.In CF patients, hepatic and plasma homeostasis of choline and PC correlate with lung function and inflammation. Impaired hepatic PC metabolism, exemplarily shown in three CF patients, provides an explanation for such correlations. Larger studies are required to understand the link between hepatic PC metabolism and overall clinical performance of CF patients, and the perspective of choline substitution of these patients.© 2015 S.

The control diet (CTRL) contained these essential nutrients in adequate amounts. Each diet was allocated to triplicate groups of juvenile gilthead sea bream fed to satiety over an 11-week feeding trial period. Weight gain of n-3 LC-PUFA, P-Vit and PL-Min-SAA groups was 50, 60-75 and 80-85 % of the CTRL group, respectively. Fat retention was decreased by all nutrient deficiencies except by the Min diet. Strong effects on N retention were found in n-3 LC-PUFA and P fish. Combined anaemia and increased blood respiratory burst were observed in n-3 LC-PUFA fish. Hypoproteinaemia was found in SAA, n-3 LC-PUFA, PL and Vit fish. Derangements of lipid metabolism were also a common disorder, but the lipodystrophic phenotype of P fish was different from that of other groups. Changes in plasma levels of electrolytes (Ca, phosphate), metabolites (creatinine, choline) and enzyme activities (alkaline phosphatase) were related to specific nutrient deficiencies in PL, P, Min or Vit fish, whereas changes in circulating levels of growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor I primarily reflected the intensity of the nutritional stressor. Histopathological scoring of the  and intestine segments showed specific nutrient-mediated changes in lipid cell vacuolisation, inflammation of intestinal submucosa, as well as the distribution and number of intestinal goblet and rodlet cells.

Rats were fed an MCD diet for 8 weeks to induce non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. CoQ10 (10 mg/(kg·day)) was orally administered for 2 consecutive weeks. Twenty-four hours after the last dose of the drug, the behavioral test, namely the activity cage test, was performed and the activity counts were recorded. Serum alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, total/direct bilirubin, and albumin were valued to assess  function. Moreover, hepatic cytokines interleukin-6 as well as its modulator nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells were determined. In addition, brain biomarkers, viz ammonia, nitric oxide, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), were measured as they are reliable indices to assess brain damage. Histopathological and immunohistochemical examination of brain proliferating cell nuclear antigen in brain and  tissues were also evaluated. Results revealed that MCD-induced NASH showed impairment in the  functions with an increase in the  inflammatory markers. Moreover, NASH resulted in pronounced brain dysfunction as evidenced by hyper-locomotor activity, a decrease in the BDNF level, as well as an increase in the brain nitric oxide and ammonia contents. Oral treatment of MCD-diet-fed rats with CoQ10 for 14 days showed a marked improvement in all the assigned parameters. Finally, it can be concluded that CoQ10 has a hepatoprotective and neuroprotective role in MCD-diet-induced NASH in rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22869015>Maternal high-fat diet induces obesity and adrenal and thyroid dysfunction in male rat offspring at weaning.</a></h2><p>Maternal nutritional status affects the future development of offspring. Both undernutrition and overnutrition in critical periods of life (gestation or lactation) may cause several hormonal changes in the pups and programme obesity in the adult offspring. We have shown that hyperleptinaemia during lactation results in central leptin resistance, higher adrenal catecholamine secretion, hyperthyroidism, and higher blood pressure and heart rate in the adult rats. Here, we evaluated the effect of a maternal isocaloric high-fat diet on breast milk composition and its impact on leptinaemia, energy metabolism, and adrenal and thyroid function of the offspring at weaning. We hypothesised that the altered source of fat in the maternal diet even under normal calorie intake would disturb the metabolism of the offspring. Female Wistar rats were fed a normal (9% fat; C group) or high-fat diet (29% fat as lard; HF group) for 8 weeks before mating and during pregnancy and lactation. HF mothers presented increased total body fat content after 8 weeks (+27%, P < 0.05) and a similar fat content at the end of lactation. In consequence, the breast milk from the HF group had higher concentration of protein (+18%, P < 0.05), cholesterol (+52%, P < 0.05) and triglycerides (+86%, P < 0.05). At weaning, HF offspring had increased body weight (+53%, P < 0.05) and adiposity (2 fold, P < 0.05), which was associated with lower β3-adrenoreceptor content in adipose tissue (-40%, P < 0.05). The offspring also presented hyperglycaemia (+30%, P < 0.05) and hyperleptinaemia (+62%, P < 0.05). In the leptin signalling pathway in the hypothalamus, we found lower p-STAT3/STAT3 (-40%, P < 0.05) and SOCS3 (-55%, P < 0.05) content in the arcuate nucleus, suggesting leptin resistance. HF offspring also had higher adrenal catecholamine content (+17%, P < 0.05),  glycogen content (+50%, P < 0.05) and hyperactivity of the thyroid axis at weaning. Our results suggest that a high fat diet increases maternal body fat and this additional energy is transferred to the offspring during lactation, since at weaning the dams had normal fat and the pups were obese. The higher fat and protein concentrations in the breast milk seemed to induce early overnutrition in the HF offspring. In addition to storing energy as fat, the HF offspring had a larger reserve of glycogen and hyperglycaemia that may have resulted from increased gluconeogenesis. Hyperleptinaemia may stimulate both adrenal medullary and thyroid function, which may contribute to the development of cardiovascular diseases. These early changes induced by the maternal high-fat diet may contribute to development of metabolic syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26465792>Choline Supplementation With a Structured Lipid in Children With Cystic Fibrosis: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial.</a></h2><p>Choline depletion is seen in cystic fibrosis (CF) and pancreatic insufficiency in spite of enzyme treatment and may result in ,  acid, and muscle abnormalities.

Dietary choline intake, plasma cholines, plasma and fecal phospholipids, coefficient of fat absorption, pulmonary function, growth status, body composition, and safety measures were assessed. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy for calf muscle choline and  fat were assessed in a subgroup and compared with a healthy comparison group matched for age, sex, and body size.A total of 110 subjects were enrolled (age 10.4 ± 3.0 years). Baseline dietary choline, 88% recommended, increased 3-fold in the LXS group. Plasma choline, betaine, and dimethylglycine increased in the LXS but not placebo (P = 0.007).

Children with CF had higher  fat than healthy children and depleted calf muscle choline at baseline. Muscle choline concentration increased in LXS and was associated with improvement in plasma choline status. No relevant changes in safety measures were evident.LXS had improved choline intake, plasma choline status, and muscle choline stores compared with placebo group.

Pregnant, nonlactating multiparous Holstein cows (n = 77) were blocked by body condition score (3.59 ± 0.33) and assigned to treatment at 64 ± 10 d before calculated calving date. Dietary treatments were top-dressing of 0, 30, 60, 90, or 120 g/d of ruminally protected choline (RPC; Balchem Corp., New Hampton, NY) ions to supply the equivalent of 0, 6.5, 12.9, 19.4, and 25.8 g/d of choline ions. Diets were formulated to exceed nutrient requirements for maintenance and pregnancy and fed in ad libitum amounts for the first 5 d. From d 6 to 15, cows were restricted to consume approximately 31% of their net energy requirements to simulate early lactating cows in negative energy balance. Methionine intake was maintained throughout each 15-d period.  was biopsied at 5 and 14 d and analyzed for TAG and glycogen. Blood was sampled on d 5 and 14 and plasma analyzed for glucose, insulin, cholesterol, β-hydroxybutyrate, long-chain  acids, and haptoglobin. On d 14, a mixture of saturated long-chain  acids, ground corn, and dried molasses (50:37:13) was offered (908 g, as-is basis) 10 h after the single daily feeding. Blood samples were collected for 19 h and plasma analyzed for TAG and cholesterol to assess apparent absorption of dietary fat. Mean dry matter intake and energy balance decreased from means of 9.5 to 3.3 kg/d and from 0.6 to -9.2 Mcal of net energy for lactation/d during the ad libitum and restricted feeding periods, respectively. Plasma concentrations of the lipid-soluble choline biomolecules, namely total phosphatidylcholines, total lysophosphatidylcholines, and sphingomyelin, increased with choline supplementation. Feed restriction increased plasma concentrations of β-hydroxybutyrate and free long-chain  acids, whereas those of glucose, insulin, and total cholesterol decreased. During feed restriction, concentration of hepatic TAG and plasma haptoglobin decreased linearly, whereas concentration of hepatic glycogen tended to increase quadratically with increasing intake of RPC. After fat supplementation, mean plasma concentration of TAG increased by an average of 21% with intake of RPC ions, peaking at intakes of ≥6.5 g/d of RPC ion. In summary, feeding RPC ions to cows in negative energy balance had increasing lipotropic effects on the  when consumed up to 25.8 g/d, whereas feeding only 6.5 g/d increased concentrations of hepatic glycogen and TAG in the blood.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

Peroxisome matrix proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm. Targeting signals (PTS or peroxisomal targeting signal) at the C-terminus (PTS1) or N-terminus (PTS2) of peroxisomal matrix proteins mediate their import into the organelle. In the case of PTS2-containing proteins, the PTS2 signal is cleaved from the protein when transported into peroxisomes. The functional mechanism of PTS2 processing, however, is poorly understood. Previously we identified Tysnd1 (Trypsin domain containing 1) and biochemically characterized it as a peroxisomal cysteine endopeptidase that directly processes PTS2-containing prethiolase Acaa1 and PTS1-containing Acox1, Hsd17b4, and ScpX. The latter three enzymes are crucial components of the very-long-chain  acids β-oxidation pathway. To clarify the in vivo functions and physiological role of Tysnd1, we analyzed the phenotype of Tysnd1(-/-) mice. Male Tysnd1(-/-) mice are infertile, and the epididymal sperms lack the acrosomal cap. These phenotypic features are most likely the result of changes in the molecular species composition of choline and  plasmalogens. Tysnd1(-/-) mice also developed  dysfunctions when the phytanic acid precursor phytol was orally administered. Phyh and Agps are known PTS2-containing proteins, but were identified as novel Tysnd1 substrates. Loss of Tysnd1 interferes with the peroxisomal localization of Acaa1, Phyh, and Agps, which might cause the mild Zellweger syndrome spectrum-resembling phenotypes.

The integrated area of [1-(14)C]20:4n-6 in plasma was significantly increased in C57BL/6 mice, but [1-(14)C]16:0 and [1-(14)C]22:6n-3 were not different between groups. In heart, uptake of [1-(14)C]20:4n-6 was increased 1.7-fold in C57BL/6 mice. However, trafficking of [1-(14)C]22:6n-3 into the organic fraction of heart was significantly decreased 33 % in C57BL/6 mice. Although there were limited differences in  acid tracer trafficking in  or brain, [1-(14)C]16:0 incorporation into  neutral lipids was decreased 18 % in C57BL/6 mice. In heart, the amount of [1-(14)C]16:0 and [1-(14)C]22:6n-3 incorporated into total phospholipids were decreased 45 and 49 %, respectively, in C57BL/6 mice.

In choline deficiency, the  accretes choline/PC at the expense of lung tissue, thereby impairing pulmonary PC homoeostasis. In cystic fibrosis (CF), exocrine pancreas insufficiency results in impaired cleavage of bile PC and subsequent fecal choline loss. In these patients, the plasma choline concentration is low and correlates with lung function. We therefore investigated the effect of choline supplementation on plasma choline/PC concentration and metabolism, lung function, and  fat.10 adult male CF patients were recruited (11/2014⁻1/2016), and orally supplemented with 3 × 1 g choline chloride for 84 (84⁻91) days. Pre-/post-supplementation, patients were spiked with 3.6 mg/kg [methyl-D₉]choline chloride to assess choline/PC metabolism. Mass spectrometry, spirometry, and hepatic nuclear resonance spectrometry served for analysis.Supplementation increased plasma choline from 4.8 (4.1⁻6.2) µmol/L to 10.5 (8.5⁻15.5) µmol/L at d84 ( < 0.01). Whereas plasma PC concentration remained unchanged, D₉-labeled PC was decreased (12.2 [10.5⁻18.3] µmol/L vs. 17.7 [15.5⁻22.4] µmol/L,  < 0.01), indicating D₉-tracer dilution due to higher choline pools. Supplementation increased Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second percent of predicted (ppFEV1) from 70.0 (50.9⁻74.8)% to 78.3 (60.1⁻83.9)% ( < 0.05), and decreased  fat from 1.58 (0.37⁻8.82)% to 0.84 (0.56⁻1.17)% ( < 0.01). Plasma choline returned to baseline concentration within 60 h.Choline supplementation normalized plasma choline concentration and increased choline-containing PC precursor pools in adult CF patients. Improved lung function and decreased  fat suggest that in CF correcting choline deficiency is clinically important. Choline supplementation of CF patients should be further investigated in randomized, placebo-controlled trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24671709>Identification of new genetic polymorphisms that alter the dietary requirement for choline and vary in their distribution across ethnic and racial groups.</a></h2><p>Effect alleles (alleles with a polymorphism that is associated with the effect being measured) in a small number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are known to influence the dietary requirement for choline. In this study, we examined a much larger number of SNPs (n=200) in 10 genes related to choline metabolism for associations with development of organ dysfunction ( or muscle) when 79 humans were fed a low-choline diet. We confirmed that effect alleles in SNPs such as the C allele of PEMT rs12325817 increase the risk of developing organ dysfunction in women when they consume a diet low in choline, and we identified novel effect alleles, such as the C allele of CHKA SNP rs7928739, that alter dietary choline requirements. When fed a low-choline diet, some people presented with muscle damage rather than  damage; several effect alleles in SLC44A1 (rs7873937, G allele; rs2771040, G; rs6479313, G; rs16924529, A; and rs3199966, C) and one in CHKB (rs1557502, A) were more common in these individuals. This suggests that pathways related to choline metabolism are more important for normal muscle function than previously thought. In European, Mexican, and Asian Americans, and in individuals of African descent, we examined the prevalence of the effect alleles in SNPs that alter choline requirement and found that they are differentially distributed among people of different ethnic and racial backgrounds. Overall, our study has identified novel genetic variants that modulate choline requirements and suggests that the dietary requirement for choline may be different across racial and ethnic groups.-Da Costa, K.-A., Corbin, K.

Here, we report that these animals develop metabolic syndrome under chow diet. However, they show protection from metabolic syndrome and obesity under  diets. These effects are elicited by α1-adrenergic- and diet-dependent metabolic changes in  and the α1/β3 adrenergic-mediated stimulation of brown adipocyte thermogenesis. These responses seem to be engaged by the local action of noradrenaline in target tissues rather than by long-range effects of adrenaline. By contrast, they are not triggered by low parasympathetic drive or the hypertensive state present in Vav3-deficient mice.

At both 2 and 4 wk, feeding the MCD diet resulted in  steatosis, inflammatory cell accumulation, oxidative stress evaluated by the concentration of TBARS, and fibrosis evidenced by the staining of α-smooth muscle actin-positive cells in the . At both 2 and 4 wk, the MCD diet induced an increase in the mRNA levels of Il6, Tnf, Ptgs2, and Hmgb1 and increased the protein concentrations of Toll-like receptor-4, c-Jun terminal kinase, and p65 NFκB subunit compared with control rats. Feeding the mice the MCD diet also triggered an increase of Col1a1, Col3a1, Plod3, Tgfb1, Smad3, Smad7, Pdgfb, Ctgf, Areg, Mmp9, and Timp1 mRNA levels. These effects were totally or partially prevented by treatment with quercetin. The data obtained suggest that attenuation of multiple profibrotic and proinflammatory gene pathways contributes to the beneficial effects of quercetin in mice with MCD diet-induced steatohepatitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30266645>Lycium barbarum polysaccharides improve hepatic injury through NFkappa-B and NLRP3/6 pathways in a methionine choline deficient diet steatohepatitis mouse model.</a></h2><p>Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBP) are major bioactive constituents of wolfberry which possess several pharmacological effects such as antioxidant and immunomodulatory activities. We aimed to evaluate how LBP attenuated the hepatic injury in a non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) methionine-choline deficient (MCD) mouse model. NASH was induced in C57BL/6N mice by feeding with MCD diet for 6 weeks. During the experiments, 1 mg/kg LBP was intragastrically fed on a daily basis with or without MCD diet lasting from the 4th to 6th week. Control and vehicle-control (LBP + PBS) were fed with a regular animal chow. LBP significantly ameliorated NASH-induced injuries, including the increase of serum ALT and AST levels, hepatic oxidative stress, fibrosis, inflammation, and apoptosis. The hepatoprotective effects of LBP were accompanied by the attenuation of thioredoxin interacting protein, nod-like receptor protein 3/6 (NLRP3/6) and reduced NF-κB (nuclear factor-kappa B) activity. Vehicle LBP fed mice showed no adverse effect on the . In conclusion, the suppression of the NLRP3/6 inflammasome pathway and NF-κB activation may partly contribute to the reduction of the hepatic injury during the progression of NASH by therapeutic LBP treatment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Complete deletion of the mouse Pcyt2 gene is embryonic lethal, and the single-allele deficiency leads to development of the metabolic syndrome phenotype, including  steatosis, hypertriglyceridemia, obesity, and insulin resistance. This study aimed to specifically elucidate the mechanisms of hypertriglyceridemia in Pcyt2 heterozygous mice (Pcyt2(+/-)). Evidence here shows that unlike 8 week-old mice, 32 week- and 42 week-old Pcyt2(+/-) mice experience increased VLDL secretion and  microsomal triglyceride transfer protein activity. Older Pcyt2(+/-) mice also demonstrate increased levels of postprandial plasma TAGs, increased stimulation of genes responsible for intestinal lipid absorption, transport and chylomicron secretion, and dramatically elevated plasma Angptl4, apoB-100, and apoB-48 content. In addition, plasma HL and LPL activities and TAG clearance following a lipid challenge were significantly reduced in Pcyt2(+/-) mice relative to control littermates. Collectively, these results establish that the hypertriglyceridemia that accompanies Pcyt2 deficiency is the result of multiple metabolic adaptations, including elevated hepatic and intestinal lipoprotein secretion and stimulated expression and/or activity of genes involved in lipid absorption and transport and lipoprotein assembly, together with reduced plasma TAG clearance and utilization with peripheral tissues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26707345>Single injection of clenbuterol into newly hatched chicks decreases abdominal fat pad weight in growing broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>The aim of the current study was to examine the effects of clenbuterol injection into newly hatched chicks on both the abdominal fat pad tissue weight and the skeletal muscle weight during subsequent growth. Twenty-seven 1-day-old chicks were divided into two groups, receiving either a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of clenbuterol (0.1 mg/kg body weight) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Body weight gain, feed intake and feed conversion ratio were not affected by clenbuterol injection during the 5-week experimental period, while the abdominal fat pad tissue weight of the clenbuterol-injected chicks was lower than that of the control chicks at 5 weeks post-injection. Plasma non-esterified  acid concentrations were significantly increased in the clenbuterol-injected chicks, while plasma triacylglycerol concentrations did not differ. Additionally, the enzymatic activity of  acid synthase was lower in the  of the clenbuterol-injected chicks. Conversely, the skeletal muscle weights were not affected by clenbuterol injection. These results suggest that a single clenbuterol injection into 1-day-old chicks decreases the abdominal fat pad tissue weight, but may not affect skeletal muscle weights during growth.© 2015 Japanese Society of Animal Science.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28724959>Hepatic metabolic effects of Curcuma longa extract supplement in high-fructose and saturated fat fed rats.</a></h2><p>The metabolic effects of an oral supplementation with a Curcuma longa extract, at a dose nutritionally relevant with common human use, on hepatic metabolism in rats fed a high fructose and saturated  acid (HFS) diet was evaluated. High-resolution magic-angle spinning NMR and GC/MS in combination with multivariate analysis have been employed to characterize the NMR metabolite profiles and  acid composition of  tissue respectively.

Renin knockout mice manifest decreased hepatic steatosis. Aliskiren is the first direct renin inhibitor to be approved for clinical use. Our study aims to evaluate the possible therapeutic effects and mechanism of the chronic administration of aliskiren in a dietary steatohepatitis murine model.Male C57BL/6 mice were fed with a methionine and choline-deficient (MCD) diet to induce steatohepatitis. After 8 weeks of feeding, the injured mice were randomly assigned to receive aliskiren (50 mg·kg(-1) per day) or vehicle administration for 4 weeks. Normal controls were also administered aliskiren (50 mg·kg(-1) per day) or a vehicle for 4 weeks.In the MCD mice, aliskiren attenuated hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. Aliskiren did not change expression of lipogenic genes but increase turnover of hepatic fat by up-regulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a, cytochrome P450-4A14 and phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase. Furthermore, aliskiren decreased the hepatic expression of angiotensin II and nuclear factor κB. The levels of oxidative stress, hepatocyte apoptosis, activation of Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells, and pro-fibrotic markers were also reduced in the livers of the MCD mice receiving aliskiren.Aliskiren attenuates steatohepatitis and fibrosis in mice fed with a MCD diet. Thus, the noted therapeutic effects might come from not only the reduction of angiotensin II but also the up-regulation of  acid oxidation-related genes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24518880>[Influence of feeding rumen-protected choline to transition dairy cows.

Blood metabolites were determined for either all cows (glucose, β-hydroxybutyrate [BHB]) or randomly (insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1 [IGF-1], non-esterified  acids [NEFA]) during the periparturient period. An index for insulin sensitivity (RQUICKI) was calculated and milk production data (dairy herd improvement tests, 100-days-, 305-days-, milk peak yield, colostrum quality) was analyzed. In the statistical analysis, a distinction was made between the feeding groups and between the parity, and their interactions were analyzed.With the exception of a lower 305-day-milk yield in the treatment group (p < 0.05), the evaluated variables did not show statistically significant differences between the feeding groups and no interactions could be found. In comparison to heifers, multiparous cows had less cases of subclinical ketosis a. p. and p. p.

The CDD diet was AIN-93 without choline.The CDD significantly increased plasma homocysteine and TNFα concentration, as well as ALT activity. In , the CDD enhanced concentrations of total fat (55%), cholesterol (25%), triglycerides (87%), MDA (30%), TNFα (241%) and decreased SAM concentrations (25%) and the SAM/SAH ratio (33%). Cr supplementation prevented all these metabolic changes, except for hepatic SAM and the SAM/SAH ratio. However, no changes in PEMT gene expression or  phosphatidylcholine levels were observed among the three experimental groups, and there were no changes in hepatic triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) mRNA level. On the contrary, Cr supplementation normalized expression of the transcription factors PPARα and PPARγ that were altered by the CDD. Further, the downstream targets and  acids metabolism genes, UCP2, LCAD and CPT1a, were also normalized in the Cr group as compared to CDD-fed rats.Cr supplementation prevented fat  accumulation and hepatic injures in rats fed with a CDD for 4 weeks. Our results demonstrated that one-carbon metabolism may have a small role in mitigating hepatic fat accumulation by Cr supplementation.

Investigations have suggested that oxidative stress may play an important role in the progress of NAFLD to NASH. To provide further insights into beneficial effects of antioxidants in NASH prevention, we employed two manganese-superoxide dismutase/catalase mimetics, manganese N,N`-bis(salicyldene) ethylene diamine chloride (EUK-8) and manganese-3-methoxy N,N`-bis(salicyldene)ethylenediamine chloride (EUK-134), as two salen representatives and vitamin C as the standard antioxidant.Experimental NASH was induced in Male N-Mary rats by feeding a methionine/choline-deficient (MCD) diet to rats for 10 weeks. The rats (n = 5, 30 mg/kg/day) were randomly assigned to receive vitamin C, EUK-8, EUK-134 or vehicle orally.Administration of salens together with the MCD diet reduced the serum aminotransferases, glutathione transferase and alkaline phosphatase, cholesterol, and LDL contents.

C57BL/6 mice were fed for 4 weeks with one of the following diets: control diet (Cont), MCD diet (MCD), MCD diet supplemented with EDL at 200 mg/kg body weight·daily (MCD+D200), and MCD diet supplemented with EDL at 500 mg/kg body weight·daily (MCD+D500). Hepatic function was assessed by evaluating the following parameters:  histology; plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), triglyceride (TG), malondialdehyde (MDA), and reduced glutathione (GSH); expression levels of TNF-α and IL-6; and levels of caspase-3 and pJNK/JNK protein. Histopathological evaluations revealed that addition of EDL to the MCD diet dampens the severity of the clinical signs of NASH. Moreover, EDL led to a significant decrease in the serum levels of ALT, hepatic TG, and MDA, and in the expression levels of TNF-α, and IL-6; on the contrary, the levels of reduced GSH increased. At the post-transcriptional level, EDL significantly decreased the activation of procaspase-3 to active caspase-3, and the phosphorylation of JNK. These results suggest that the beneficial effects of EDL on NASH are mainly due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25886887>Fluvastatin attenuates hepatic steatosis-induced fibrogenesis in rats through inhibiting paracrine effect of hepatocyte on hepatic stellate cells.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is associated with hepatic fibrogenesis. Despite well-known cholesterol-lowering action of statins, their mechanisms against NASH-mediated fibrogenesis remain unclear. This study aimed at investigating the in vitro and in vivo anti-fibrotic properties of fluvastatin (Flu).Palmitate (PA)-induced changes in intracellular hydrogen peroxide levels in primary rat hepatocytes (PRHs) and human hepatoma cell line (HepG2) were quantified by dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) dye assay, whereas changes in expressions of NADPH oxidase gp91 (phox) subunit, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and NFκB p65 nuclear translocation were quantified with Western blotting. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) was used to investigate mRNA expressions of pro-inflammatory genes (ICAM-1, IL-6, TNF-α). Conditioned medium (CM) from PA-treated PRHs was applied to cultured rat hepatic stellate cell line, HSC-T6, with or without Flu-pretreatment for 2 h. Pro-fibrogenic gene expressions (COL1, TIMP-1, TGF-β1, α-SMA) and protein expression of α-SMA were analyzed. In vivo study using choline-deficient L-amino acid defined (CDAA) diet-induced rat NASH model was performed by randomly assigning Wistar rats (n = 28) to normal controls (n = 4), CDAA diet with vehicles, and CDAA diet with Flu (5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg) (n = 8 each) through gavage for 4 or 8 weeks. Livers were harvested for histological, Western blot (α-SMA), and q-PCR analyses for expressions of pro-inflammatory (IL-6, iNOS, ICAM-1) and pro-fibrogenic (Col1, α-SMA, TIMP-1) genes.In vitro, Flu (1-20 μM) inhibited PA-induced free-radical production, gp91 (phox) expression, and NFκB p65 translocation in HepG2 and PRHs, while CM-induced α-SMA protein expression and pro-fibrogenic gene expressions in HSC-T6 were suppressed in Flu-pretreated cells compared to those without pretreatment. Moreover, α-SMA protein expression was significantly decreased in HSC-T6 cultured with CM from PA-Flu-treated PRHs compared to those cultured with CM from PA-treated PRHs. Flu also reduced steatosis and fibrosis scores, α-SMA protein expression, mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrogenic genes in livers of CDAA rats.We demonstrated PA-induced HSC activation through paracrine effect of hepatocyte in vitro that was significantly suppressed by pre-treating HSC with Flu.

Beneficial effects of increased NAD levels and sirtuin activation on mitochondrial homeostasis, organismal metabolism and lifespan have been established across species. Here we show that α-amino-β-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde decarboxylase (ACMSD), the enzyme that limits spontaneous cyclization of α-amino-β-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde in the de novo NAD synthesis pathway, controls cellular NAD levels via an evolutionarily conserved mechanism in Caenorhabditis elegans and mouse. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of ACMSD boosts de novo NAD synthesis and sirtuin 1 activity, ultimately enhancing mitochondrial function. We also characterize two potent and selective inhibitors of ACMSD. Because expression of ACMSD is largely restricted to kidney and , these inhibitors may have therapeutic potential for protection of these tissues from injury. In summary, we identify ACMSD as a key modulator of cellular NAD levels, sirtuin activity and mitochondrial homeostasis in kidney and .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22877991>Physiological roles of phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase.</a></h2><p>Phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) catalyzes the methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine (PC). This 22.3 kDa protein is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria associated membranes of . The supply of the substrates AdoMet and phosphatidylethanolamine, and the product AdoHcy, can regulate the activity of PEMT. Estrogen has been identified as a positive activator, and Sp1 as a negative regulator, of transcription of the PEMT gene. Targeted inactivation of the PEMT gene produced mice that had a mild phenotype when fed a chow diet. However, when Pemt(-/-) mice were fed a choline-deficient diet steatohepatitis and  failure developed after 3 days. The steatohepatitis was due to a decreased ratio of PC to phosphatidylethanolamine that caused leakage from the plasma membrane of hepatocytes. Pemt(-/-) mice exhibited attenuated secretion of very low-density lipoproteins and homocysteine. Pemt(-/-) mice bred with mice that lacked the low-density lipoprotein receptor, or apolipoprotein E were protected from high fat/high cholesterol-induced atherosclerosis. Surprisingly, Pemt(-/-) mice were protected from high fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance compared to wildtype mice. If the diet were supplemented with additional choline, the protection against obesity/insulin resistance in Pemt(-/-) mice was eliminated. Humans with a Val-to-Met substitution in PEMT at residue 175 may have increased susceptibility to nonalcoholic  disease.

The aim of this work was to investigate whether treatment with baicalein prevented nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced by methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet. Rats were divided into four experimental groups and fed for 8 weeks as follows: (1) control rats; (2) control rats treated with baicalein (intraperitoneal injection of 10mg/kg); (3) MCD-diet-fed rats; (4) MCD-diet-fed rats treated with baicalein. Treatment with baicalein prevented MCD-diet-induced NASH, as evidenced by reduced histological scores, apoptosis, activities of ALT and AST, and hepatic fat accumulation in rats. Treatment with baicalein abated MCD-diet-induced oxidative stress through enhancing Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and activities of SOD and catalase in livers. Treatment with baicalein preserved hepatic mitochondrial function in MCD-diet fed rats. Treatment with baicalein reduced hepatic NO formation through suppressing MCD-diet-induced iNOS activation, and suppressed MCD-diet-induced inflammation through suppressing NFκB activation and reducing IL-6 and TNFα expressions in livers. Treatment of MCD-diet fed rats with baicalein had a beneficial modulation on expression profiles of  acid metabolism genes in livers. The results support the investigation of baicalein as a therapeutic candidate for NASH induced by MCD diet in rats.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A proper diet should include vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, proteins, and fats that have to be optimally balanced in order to exert their physiological functions. The endogenous ligands of type-1 and type-2 cannabinoid receptors, N-arachidonoyl- and 2-arachidonoylglycerol, are arachidonic acid (AA) derivatives whose levels are regulated by the activity of metabolic enzymes, as well as by AA availability. Since the only sources of AA in mammals are diet and the enzymatic production in the  from shorter-chain essential  acids like linoleic acid, it is realistic to hypothesize that endocannabinoid levels might be modulated by  acid composition of food. Therefore, in this review we summarize literature data indicating that endocannabinoid levels, and hence their activity at cannabinoid receptors, might be modulated by food composition. We focused our attention on dietary  acid content, and on type and esterified form of  acids in the different diets.© 2014 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25281898>3, 3'-Diindolylmethane alleviates steatosis and the progression of NASH partly through shifting the imbalance of Treg/Th17 cells to Treg dominance.</a></h2><p>This study was designed to discuss the effects of 3, 3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) on methionine-choline-deficient (MCD)-diet induced mouse nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and the potential mechanisms. NASH mice were administrated with or without DIM at different concentrations for 8 weeks. Both the in-vivo and in-vitro effects of DIM on Treg/Th17 imbalance during NASH progression were analyzed. The in-vivo blocking of CD25 or IL-17 was performed to respectively deplete respective function of Treg or Th17 subset. Besides, with the assistance of AhR antagonist CH223191 and anti-TLR4 neutralizing antibody, we designed the in-vitro DIM-incubation experiments to discuss the roles of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) (CYP1A1, CYP1B1) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on DIM's effects when shifting Treg/Th17 imbalance. Notably, in NASH mouse models, DIM alleviated hepatic steatosis and inflammation, and shifted the Treg/Th17 imbalance from MCD diet-induced Th17 dominance to Treg dominance. In-vitro, DIM not only significantly up-regulated the mRNAs of Foxp3 (Treg-specific) in purified spleen CD4(+) T cells, but also enhanced the immunosuppressive function of these Treg cells. Besides, DIM significantly up-regulated the proteins of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 whereas down-regulated those of TLR4 on CD4(+) T cells from MCD-diet mice. Moreover, blocking AhR attenuated while blocking TLR4 enhanced the effects of DIM when regulating Treg/Th17 imbalance. Conclusively, DIM could be used as a potential therapeutic candidate to treat NASH based on its dramatic induction of Treg dominance to alleviate intra-hepatic inflammation, suggesting us a clue that the dietary cruciferous vegetables (containing abundant DIM) might exist as a protective factor for patients with NASH-related  diseases.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is a variable in drug disposition, yet the impact on renal transport processes has yet to be fully understood. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis on the pharmacokinetics of adefovir in rats given a control or methionine and choline deficient diet to induce nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.Animals received a bolus dose of 7mg/kg (35μCi/kg) [(3)H] adefovir with consequent measurement of plasma and urine concentrations. Inulin clearance was used to determine glomerular filtration rate.Methionine and choline deficient diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis prolonged the elimination half-life of adefovir. This observation occurred in conjunction with reduced distribution volume and hepatic levels of adefovir. Notably, despite these changes, renal clearance and overall clearance were not changed, despite markedly reduced glomerular filtration rate in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Alteration of glomerular filtration rate was fully compensated for by a significant increase in tubular secretion of adefovir. Analysis of renal transporters confirmed transcriptional up-regulation of Mrp4, the major transporter for adefovir tubular secretion.This study demonstrates changes to glomerular filtration and tubular secretion that alter pharmacokinetics of adefovir in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-induced changes in renal drug elimination processes could have major implications in variable drug response and the potential for toxicity.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We conducted a randomized controlled clinical trial on children with biopsy-proven NASH based on a combinatorial nutritional approach compared with placebo. Participants were assigned to lifestyle modification plus placebo or lifestyle modification plus a mix containing docosahexaenoic acid, choline, and vitamin E (DHA-CHO-VE). Forty children and adolescents participated in the entire trial. The primary outcome was the improvement of  hyperechogenicity. Secondary outcomes included alterations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and other metabolic parameters. Furthermore, changes of serum bile acids (BA) and plasma fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) levels were evaluated as inverse biomarkers of disease severity. At the end of the study, we observed a significant decrease in severe steatosis in the treatment group (50% to 5%, p = 0.001). Furthermore, although the anthropometric and biochemical measurements in the placebo and DHA-CHO-VE groups were comparable at baseline, at the end of the study ALT and fasting glucose levels improved only in the treatment group. Finally, we found that BA levels were not influenced whereas FGF19 levels were significantly increased by DHA-CHO-VE.

Some rats developed hypoproteinemia (HPO). HPO rats also exhibited decreases in plasma palmitoleic acid and oleic acid. Diabetes caused almost absence of palmitoleic acid in HPO rats. Choline treatment exerted no effect on the plasma  acid composition of diabetic HPO rats.Choline treatment affected hepatic reticuloendothelial function and plasma  acid composition, but not hepatobiliary function, in diabetic rats.

Other OATP uptake transporters can participate in the transport of pravastatin, partially compensating for the loss of OATP1B1 in patients carrying the polymorphism. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in humans and in a diet-induced rodent model alter the expression of multiple OATP transporters.To determine how genetic alteration in one Oatp transporter can interact with NASH-associated changes in Oatp expression we measured the disposition of intravenously administered pravastatin in Slco1b2 knockout (Slco1b2(-/-)) and wild-type (WT) mice fed either a control or a methionine and choline deficient (MCD) diet to induce NASH.Genetic loss of Oatp1b2, the rodent ortholog of human OATP1B transporters, caused a modest increase in pravastatin plasma concentrations in mice with healthy livers. Although a diet-induced model of NASH decreased the expression of multiple hepatic Oatp transporters, it did not alter the disposition of pravastatin compared to WT control mice. In contrast, the combination of NASH-associated decrease in compensatory Oatp transporters and Oatp1b2 genetic loss caused a synergistic increase in plasma area under the curve (AUC) and tissue concentrations in kidney and muscle.Our data show that NASH alters the expression of multiple hepatic uptake transporters which, due to overlapping substrate specificity among the OATP transporters, may combine with the pharmacogenetic loss of OATP1B1 to increase the risk of statin-induced adverse drug reactions.Copyright © 2014 European Association for the Study of the .

The animals were divided into 6 groups (n = 10) and submitted to different diets over 30 days: AIN-93 diet (standard, St), AIN-93 choline deficient (CD) diet and AIN-93 choline and cystine deficient (CCD) diet, in the pellet (pl) and powder (pw) diet forms. Independently of the diet form, AIN-93 diet already led to hepatic steatosis and CD/CCD diets provoked hepatic damage. The increase of lipid peroxidation, represented by the evaluation of thiobarbituric acid reactive species, associated with the decrease of levels of antioxidant enzymes, were the parameters with higher significance toward redox profile in this model of hepatic injury. Regarding inflammation, in relation to TNF-α, higher levels were evidenced in CD(pl), while, for IL-1β, no significant alteration was detected. RAGE expression was practically the same in all groups, with exception of CCD(pw) versus CCD(pl). These results together confirm that AIN-93 causes hepatic steatosis and choline and/or cysteine deficiencies produce important hepatic injury associated with oxidative stress and inflammatory profiles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28873429>CD18 deficiency improves  injury in the MCD model of steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Neutrophils and macrophages are important constituents of the hepatic inflammatory infiltrate in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. These innate immune cells express CD18, an adhesion molecule that facilitates leukocyte activation. In the context of , activation of infiltrated leukocytes is believed to enhance hepatocellular injury. The objective of this study was to determine the degree to which activated innate immune cells promote steatohepatitis by comparing hepatic outcomes in wild-type and CD18-mutant mice fed a methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet. After 3 weeks of MCD feeding, hepatocyte injury, based on serum ALT elevation, was 40% lower in CD18-mutant than wild-type mice. Leukocyte infiltration into the  was not impaired in CD18-mutant mice, but leukocyte activation was markedly reduced, as shown by the lack of evidence of oxidant production. Despite having reduced hepatocellular injury, CD18-mutant mice developed significantly more hepatic steatosis than wild-type mice after MCD feeding. This coincided with greater hepatic induction of pro-inflammatory and lipogenic genes as well as a modest reduction in hepatic expression of adipose triglyceride lipase. Overall, the data indicate that CD18 deficiency curbs MCD-mediated  injury by limiting the activation of innate immune cells in the  without compromising intrahepatic cytokine activation. Reduced  injury occurs at the expense of increased hepatic steatosis, which suggests that in addition to damaging hepatocytes, infiltrating leukocytes may influence lipid homeostasis in the .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30166404>Gene-by-Environment Interaction of Bcrp and Methionine- and Choline-Deficient Diet-Induced Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Alters SN-38 Disposition.</a></h2><p>Disease progression to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has profound effects on the expression and function of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters, which provide a mechanistic basis for variable drug response. Breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), a biliary efflux transporter, exhibits increased  mRNA expression in NASH patients and preclinical NASH models, but the impact on function is unknown. It was shown that the transport capacity of multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) is decreased in NASH. SN-38, the active irinotecan metabolite, is reported to be a substrate for Bcrp, whereas SN-38 glucuronide (SN-38G) is a Mrp2 substrate. The purpose of this study was to determine the function of Bcrp in NASH through alterations in the disposition of SN-38 and SN-38G in a  knockout (Bcrp KO) and methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) model of NASH. Sprague Dawley [wild-type (WT)] rats and Bcrp rats were fed either a methionine- and choline-sufficient (control) or MCD diet for 8 weeks to induce NASH. SN-38 (10 mg/kg) was administered i.v., and blood and bile were collected for quantification by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In Bcrp rats on the MCD diet, biliary efflux of SN-38 decreased to 31.9%, and efflux of SN-38G decreased to 38.7% of control, but WT-MCD and KO-Control were unaffected. These data indicate that Bcrp is not solely responsible for SN-38 biliary efflux, but rather implicate a combined role for BCRP and MRP2. Furthermore, the disposition of SN-38 and SN-38G is altered by Bcrp and NASH in a gene-by-environment interaction and may result in variable drug response to irinotecan therapy in polymorphic patients.Copyright © 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27913996>Altered Gut Microbiota Composition and Immune Response in Experimental Steatohepatitis Mouse Models.</a></h2><p>Although several types of diet have been used in experimental steatohepatitis models, comparison of gut microbiota and immunological alterations in the gut among diets has not yet been performed.We attempted to clarify the difference in the gut environment between mice administrated several experimental diets.Male wild-type mice were fed a high-fat (HF) diet, a choline-deficient amino acid-defined (CDAA) diet, and a methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet for 8 weeks. We compared the severity of steatohepatitis, the composition of gut microbiota, and the intestinal expression of interleukin (IL)-17, an immune modulator.Steatohepatitis was most severe in the mice fed the CDAA diet, followed by the MCD diet, and the HF diet. Analysis of gut microbiota showed that the composition of the Firmicutes phylum differed markedly at order level between the mice fed the CDAA and HF diet. The CDAA diet increased the abundance of Clostridiales, while the HF diet increased that of lactate-producing bacteria. In addition, the CDAA diet decreased the abundance of lactate-producing bacteria and antiinflammatory bacterium Parabacteroides goldsteinii in the phylum Bacteroidetes. In CDAA-fed mice, IL-17 levels were increased in ileum as well as portal vein. In addition, the CDAA diet also elevated hepatic expression of chemokines, downstream targets of IL-17.The composition of gut microbiota and IL-17 expression varied considerably between mice administrated different experimental diets to induce steatohepatitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28711489>Time-course microarrays reveal early activation of the immune transcriptome in a choline-deficient mouse model of  injury.</a></h2><p>Choline-deficient diet is extensively used as a model of nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD).

To better the situation, we systematically analyzed the metabolic phenotypes of multiple non-involved mouse organ tissues (heart, , spleen, lung and kidney) in an A549 lung cancer xenograft model at two different tumor-growth stages using the NMR-based metabonomics approaches. We found that tumor growth caused significant metabonomic changes in multiple non-involved organ tissues involving numerous metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, TCA cycle and metabolisms of amino acids,  acids, choline and nucleic acids. Amongst these, the common effects are enhanced glycolysis and nucleoside/nucleotide metabolisms.

The traditional Chinese formula Salvia-Nelumbinis naturalis (SNN) is effectively applied to improve the symptoms of nonalcoholic simple  (NAFL) patients. Previous studies have confirmed that SNN could reduce the  lipid deposition and serum transaminases of NAFL experimental models. This study aims to determine whether SNN is effective for murine NASH model and investigate the underlying pharmacological mechanisms.C57BL/6 J mice were fed with methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet for six weeks to induce NASH. Simultaneously, SNN or saline was intragastrically administered daily to the mice in the SNN or model group, respectively. A standard diet was given to the control mice. Serum biochemical indices and tumor necrosis factor-α were measured.  histopathology was observed, and the contents of triglycerides and lipid peroxide malondialdehyde (MDA) in  homogenates were evaluated. The hepatic expression and/or activation of genes associated with inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress were determined by quantitative RT-PCR or Western blot analysis.The prominent  steatosis displayed in the NASH model was prevented by SNN. The  injury of NASH mice was obviously manifested by the increased levels of serum transaminases and bilirubin, as well as the lobular inflammation, elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines, and upregulated apoptosis in  tissues. SNN administration improved the aforementioned pathological changes. The increased hepatic levels of MDA and cytochrome P450 2E1 of the model confirmed the unregulated balance of oxidative stress. The hepatic expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 and its target genes decreased, whereas c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation in the model mice increased. Treating the mice with SNN significantly improved oxidative stress-related harmful factors.This study shows that SNN can protect the  from severe steatosis and damage induced by MCD diet, which suggests the potential use of SNN on the treatment of NASH patient.

Since the brain EC system of females differs significantly from that of males, it was important to determine if LKO differently impacted the brain EC system. LKO did not alter brain levels of arachidonic acid (ARA)-containing EC, i.e. arachidonoylethanolamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), but decreased non-ARA-containing N-acylethanolamides (OEA, PEA) and 2-oleoylglycerol (2-OG) that potentiate the actions of AEA and 2-AG. These changes in brain potentiating EC levels were not associated with: (1) a net decrease in levels of brain membrane proteins associated with  acid uptake and EC synthesis; (2) a net increase in brain protein levels of cytosolic EC chaperones and enzymes in EC degradation; or (3) increased brain protein levels of EC receptors (CB1, TRVP1). Instead, the reduced or opposite responsiveness of female brain EC levels to loss of FABP1 (LKO) correlated with intrinsically lower FABP1 level in livers of WT females than males. These data show that female mouse brain endocannabinoid levels were unchanged (AEA, 2-AG) or decreased (OEA, PEA, 2-OG) by complete loss of FABP1 (LKO).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26773011>Choline, Its Potential Role in Nonalcoholic  Disease, and the Case for Human and Bacterial Genes.</a></h2><p>Our understanding of the impact of poor hepatic choline/phosphatidylcholine availability in promoting the steatosis characteristic of human nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) has recently advanced and possibly relates to phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylethanolamine concentrations in various, membranes as well as cholesterol dysregulation. A role for choline/phosphatidylcholine availability in the progression of NAFLD to  injury and serious hepatic consequences in some individuals requires further elucidation. There are many reasons for poor choline/phosphatidylcholine availability in the , including low intake, estrogen status, and genetic polymorphisms affecting, in particular, the pathway for hepatic de novo phosphatidylcholine synthesis. In addition to free choline, phosphatidylcholine has been identified as a substrate for trimethylamine production by certain intestinal bacteria, thereby reducing host choline bioavailability and providing an additional link to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease faced by those with NAFLD. Thus human choline requirements are highly individualized and biomarkers of choline status derived from metabolomics studies are required to predict those at risk of NAFLD induced by choline deficiency and to provide a basis for human intervention trials.© 2016 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28414763>Enhanced offspring predisposition to steatohepatitis with maternal high-fat diet is associated with epigenetic and microbiome alterations.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is an important co-morbidity associated with obesity and a precursor to steatohepatitis. However, the contributions of gestational and early life influences on development of NAFLD and NASH remain poorly appreciated.Two independent studies were performed to examine whether maternal over-nutrition via exposure to high fat diet (HFD) leads to exacerbated hepatic responses to post-natal HFD and methionine choline deficient (MCD) diets in the offspring. Offspring of both control diet- and HFD-fed dams were weaned onto control and HFD, creating four groups.When compared to their control diet-fed littermates, offspring of HF-dams weaned onto HFD gained greater body weight; had increased relative  weight and showed hepatic steatosis and inflammation. Similarly, this group revealed significantly greater immune response and pro-fibrogenic gene expression via RNA-seq. In parallel, 7-8 week old offspring were challenged with either control or MCD diets for 3 weeks. Responses to MCD diets were also exacerbated due to maternal HFD as seen by gene expression of classical pro-fibrogenic genes. Quantitative genome-scale DNA methylation analysis of over 1 million CpGs showed persistent epigenetic changes in key genes in tissue development and metabolism (Fgf21, Ppargc1β) with maternal HFD and in cell adhesion and communication (VWF, Ephb2) in the combination of maternal HFD and offspring MCD diets. Maternal HFD also influenced gut microbiome profiles in offspring leading to a decrease in α-diversity. Linear regression analysis revealed association between serum ALT levels and Coprococcus, Coriobacteriacae, Helicobacterioceae and Allobaculum.Our findings indicate that maternal HFD detrimentally alters epigenetic and gut microbiome pathways to favor development of  disease and its progressive sequelae.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26934227>NAFLD causes selective CD4(+) T lymphocyte loss and promotes hepatocarcinogenesis.</a></h2><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second most common cause of cancer-related death. Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) affects a large proportion of the US population and is considered to be a metabolic predisposition to  cancer. However, the role of adaptive immune responses in NAFLD-promoted HCC is largely unknown. Here we show, in mouse models and human samples, that dysregulation of lipid metabolism in NAFLD causes a selective loss of intrahepatic CD4(+) but not CD8(+) T lymphocytes, leading to accelerated hepatocarcinogenesis. We also demonstrate that CD4(+) T lymphocytes have greater mitochondrial mass than CD8(+) T lymphocytes and generate higher levels of mitochondrially derived reactive oxygen species (ROS). Disruption of mitochondrial function by linoleic acid, a  acid accumulated in NAFLD, causes more oxidative damage than other free  acids such as palmitic acid, and mediates selective loss of intrahepatic CD4(+) T lymphocytes. In vivo blockade of ROS reversed NAFLD-induced hepatic CD4(+) T lymphocyte decrease and delayed NAFLD-promoted HCC.

Knowing that a mouse with triple β-receptor knockout (KO) is cold intolerant and obese, we evaluated the independent role played by the β(1) isoform in energy homeostasis. First, the 30  min i.v. infusion of norepinephrine (NE) or the β(1) selective agonist dobutamine (DB) resulted in similar interscapular BAT (iBAT) thermal response in WT mice. Secondly, mice with targeted disruption of the β(1) gene (KO of β(1) adrenergic receptor (β(1)KO)) developed hypothermia during cold exposure and exhibited decreased iBAT thermal response to NE or DB infusion. Thirdly, when placed on a high-fat diet (HFD; 40% fat) for 5 weeks, β(1)KO mice were more susceptible to obesity than WT controls and failed to develop diet-induced thermogenesis as assessed by BAT Ucp1 mRNA levels and oxygen consumption. Furthermore, β(1)KO mice exhibited fasting hyperglycemia and more intense glucose intolerance, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertriglyceridemia when placed on the HFD, developing marked non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. In conclusion, the β(1) signaling pathway mediates most of the SNS stimulation of adaptive thermogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23592516>Nrf2 activators attenuate the progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-related fibrosis in a dietary rat model.</a></h2><p>Oxidative stress is considered to be a key mechanism of hepatocellular injury and disease progression in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The transcription factor Nrf2 (nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2) plays a central role in stimulating expression of various antioxidant-associated genes in the cellular defense against oxidative stress. As the cytosolic repressor kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) negatively regulates Nrf2, activation of Nrf2 facilitated by its release from Keap1 may represent a promising strategy in the treatment of NASH. To test this hypothesis, we used two chemically distinct types of Nrf2 activator. One is the thiol-reactive agent oltipraz (OPZ), a typical Nrf2 activator, and the other is a novel biaryl urea compound, termed NK-252 (1-(5-(furan-2-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-3-(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)urea). NK-252 exhibits a greater Nrf2-activating potential than OPZ. Furthermore, in vitro binding studies revealed that NK-252 interacts with the domain containing the Nrf2-binding site of Keap1, whereas OPZ does not. This finding indicates that NK-252 is more potent than OPZ due to its unique mechanism of action. For in vivo animal model studies, we used rats on a choline-deficient L-amino acid-defined (CDAA) diet, which demonstrate pathologic findings similar to those seen in human NASH. The administration of OPZ or NK-252 significantly attenuated the progression of histologic abnormalities in rats on a CDAA diet, especially hepatic fibrosis. In conclusion, by using Nrf2 activators with independent mechanisms of action, we show that, in a rat model of NASH, the activation of Nrf2 is responsible for the antifibrotic effects of these drugs. This strategy of Nrf2 activation presents new opportunities for treatment of NASH patients with hepatic fibrosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29178411>Increased plasma oleoylethanolamide and palmitoleoylethanolamide levels correlate with inflammatory changes in alcohol binge drinkers: the case of HMGB1 in women.</a></h2><p>Alcohol binge drinking is a heavy pattern of alcohol consumption increasingly used by young people. In a previous study, we reported that young drinkers with a 2-year history of binge alcohol consumption had an overactivation of the innate immune system and peripheral inflammation when compared with controls. In the present study, we measured several biolipids that are  acid derivatives belonging to the acylethanolamide or 2-acylglycerol families in the plasma of the same subjects (n = 42; 20 men and 22 women). We found that during abstinence, alcohol binge drinkers had elevated plasma levels of oleoylethanolamide, palmitoleoylethanolamide, arachidonoylethanolamide, dihomo-γ-linolenoyl ethanolamide and linoleoyl ethanolamide, which positively correlated with changes in the mRNA expression of key inflammatory markers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, such as toll-like receptors (TLR4), pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and cyclooxygenase-2. Additionally, plasma oleoylethanolamide positively correlated with plasma levels of high mobility group box-1, which is a danger-associated molecular pattern and an endogenous TLR4 agonist, specifically in female alcohol binge drinkers. No changes were observed in 2-acylglycerols in alcohol binge drinkers, although sex-related differences in these bioactive lipids as well as in palmitoleoylethanolamide and docosatetraenoylethanolamide levels were detected. These results extend the previous clinical findings observed in patients diagnosed with long-term alcohol use disorder to young users and suggest a prominent role for these lipids in the response to acute alcohol exposure.© 2017 Society for the Study of Addiction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25445671>The YhhN protein of Legionella pneumophila is a Lysoplasmalogenase.</a></h2><p>Lysoplasmalogenase catalyzes hydrolytic cleavage of the vinyl-ether bond of lysoplasmalogen to yield  aldehyde and glycerophospho- or glycerophospho-choline. We recently purified lysoplasmalogenase from rat  microsomes and identified the protein as TMEM86B, an integral membrane protein that is a member of the YhhN family found in numerous species of eukaryotes and bacteria. To test the hypothesis that bacterial YhhN proteins also function as lysoplasmalogenase enzymes, we cloned the Lpg1991 gene of Legionella pneumophila, which encodes a 216 amino acid YhhN protein (LpYhhN), and expressed it in Escherichia coli as a C-terminal-GFP-His8-fusion. Membranes were solubilized and the fusion protein was purified by nickel-affinity chromatography, cleaved with Tobacco Etch Virus protease, and subjected to a reverse nickel column to purify the un-tagged LpYhhN. Both the fusion protein and un-tagged LpYhhN exhibit robust lysoplasmalogenase activity, cleaving the vinyl-ether bond of lysoplasmalogen with a Vmax of 12 µmol/min/mg protein and a Km of 45 μM. LpYhhN has no activity on diradyl plasmalogen, 1-alkenyl-glycerol, and monoacylglycerophospho- or monoacylglycerophospho-choline; the pH optimum is 6.5-7.0. These properties are very similar to mammalian TMEM86B. Sequence analysis suggests that YhhN proteins contain eight transmembrane helices, an N-in/C-in topology, and about 5 highly conserved amino acid residues that may form an active site. This work is the first to demonstrate a function for a bacterial YhhN protein, as a vinyl ether bond hydrolase specific for lysoplasmalogen. Since L. pneumophila does not contain endogenous plasmalogens, we hypothesize that LpYhhN may serve to protect the bacterium from lysis by lysoplasmalogen derived from plasmalogens of the host.Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23771152>Fibroblast growth factor 21 protects against cardiac hypertrophy in mice.</a></h2><p>Fibroblast growth factor 21 is an endocrine factor, secreted mainly by the , that exerts metabolic actions that favour glucose metabolism.

Here we show that Fgf21(-/-) mice exhibit an increased relative heart weight and develop enhanced signs of dilatation and cardiac dysfunction in response to isoproterenol infusion, indicating eccentric hypertrophy development. In addition, Fgf21(-/-) mice exhibit enhanced induction of cardiac hypertrophy markers and pro-inflammatory pathways and show greater repression of  acid oxidation. Most of these alterations are already present in Fgf21(-/-) neonates, and treatment with fibroblast growth factor 21 reverses them in vivo and in cultured cardiomyocytes. Moreover, fibroblast growth factor 21 is expressed in the heart and is released by cardiomyocytes.

Therefore, quantitative determination of choline is important in the biological and clinical analysis. So far, several methods have been investigated for measuring choline in the body fluids, each of which has disadvantages such as the need for specialist ability, complexity, and high cost. For this purpose, a facile and sensitive colorimetric biosensor based on DNAzyme-choline oxidase coupling used for the determination of choline. In this method, the first, choline oxidase produces HO and betaine in the presence of choline and oxygen, then, the DNAzyme converts colorless ABTS into green ABTS radicals. Compared to the previous methods, the linear range and the limit of detection of this talented biosensor were 0.1-25 μM and 22 nM. Choline measurement using this biosensor has shown satisfactory selectivity and repeatability. Its recovery was 96.9-103.7%, which shows the reliability of biosensor assay in biological samples. Simplicity, low cost, naked eye, high sensitivity, and precision are the benefits of this biosensor. Taken to gather, the proposed system can be considered as a great biosensor for measuring choline levels especially in point of care diagnostic.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Biosynthetic and degradative enzymes of endocannabinoids revealed a significant change in human fibrotic . Meanwhile, we showed dynamic changes of these enzymes and CBs (CB1 and CB2) from 1 to 56 d in carbon tetrachloride-induced murine  injury. Biosynthetic enzymes (N-acylphosphatidyl- selective phospholipase D and diacylglycerol lipase-α) and CBs were markedly increased, whereas degradative enzymes ( acid amidohydrolase and monoacylglycerol lipase) were downregulated. Moreover, these enzymes intimately correlated with the fibrosis parameter [procollagen α1(III)]. Bone marrow-derived monocytes/macrophages (BMM) expressed CBs. Interestingly, CB1 but not CB2 mediated BMM migration through a Boyden chambers assay, and the effect depended on the G(α)i/o/RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway. ICR mice were lethally irradiated and received BM transplants from enhanced GFP transgenic mice. Four weeks later, mice of BM reconstruction were subjected to carbon tetrachloride-induced  injury. In the chimeric murine model, we found that blockade of CB1 by administration of a CB1 antagonist inhibited the recruitment of BMM into injured  using immunofluorescence staining and FACS, but it did not have effects on migration of T cells and dendritic cells without CB1 expression. Furthermore, activation of CB1 enhanced cytokine expression of BMM. In vivo, inhibition of CB1 attenuated the inflammatory cytokine level through real-time RT-PCR and cytometric bead array, ameliorating hepatic inflammation and fibrosis.

Fibrosis tended to be resolved within 12 weeks of a recovery period after 12 weeks of feeding, and the expression of miR-21, Timp-1, and Mmp-9 decreased in . Comprehensive analyses of miRNA and mRNA expression in the  using samples acquired at week 4 detected 16 miRNAs and 11 mRNAs that are mutually-interacting fibrosis-related factors. We therefore conclude that miR-21 was closely associated with fibrosis in a rat model of NASH and has potential as a plasma biomarker for hepatic fibrosis.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Phloretin, a dihydrochalcone flavonoid usually present in apples, possesses a variety of biological activities including vascular nutrition. This study was designed to investigate whether phloretin could alleviate or prevent high choline-induced vascular endothelial dysfunction and  injury in mice. Mice were provided with 3% high choline water and given phloretin orally daily for 10 weeks. The high choline-treated mice showed the significant dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia with the impaired  and vascular endothelium (p < 0.01). Administration of phloretin at 200 and 400 mg/kg bw significantly reduced the choline-induced elevation of serum TC, TG, LDL-C, AST, ALT, ET-1 and TXA2 (p < 0.01), and markedly antagonized the choline-induced decrease of serum PGI2, HDL-C and NO levels. Furthermore, phloretin elevated hepatic SOD and GSH-Px activities and decreased hepatic MDA levels of the mice exposed to high choline water. Moreover, histopathological test with the H&E and Oil Red O staining of  sections confirmed the high choline diet-caused  steatosis and the hepatoprotective effect of phloretin. These findings suggest that high choline causes oxidative damage, and phloretin alleviate vascular endothelial dysfunction and  injury.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To determine the relationship between hypertension and hepatic fibrosis in NAFLD, we examined whether long-term CD diet leads to hepatic fibrosis through oxidative stress.Eight-week-old male SHR and normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKYs) were fed a CD diet for 5 or 20 weeks, then  histology and hepatic expression of genes related to lipid metabolism, fibrosis, and oxidative stress were assessed. Oxidative stress was assessed by hepatic thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) levels.After 5 weeks on CD diet, prominent hepatic steatosis and decrease in expression of genes for lipid metabolism were observed in SHRs as compared with WKYs. SHRs on a CD diet demonstrated a downregulated expression of genes for antioxidants, along with significant increases in hepatic TBARS. After 20 weeks on CD diet, SHRs demonstrated severe  fibrosis and upregulated expressions of genes for fibrosis when compared with WKY.Hypertension precipitated hepatic steatosis, and further, acts as an enhancer in NAFLD progression to  fibrosis through oxidative stress.© 2016 Japanese Society of Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic Surgery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28052917>A mutation of EPT1 (SELENOI) underlies a new disorder of Kennedy pathway phospholipid biosynthesis.</a></h2><p>Mutations in genes involved in lipid metabolism have increasingly been associated with various subtypes of hereditary spastic paraplegia, a highly heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative motor neuron disorders characterized by spastic paraparesis. Here, we report an unusual autosomal recessive neurodegenerative condition, best classified as a complicated form of hereditary spastic paraplegia, associated with mutation in the ethanolaminephosphotransferase 1 (EPT1) gene (now known as SELENOI), responsible for the final step in Kennedy pathway forming phosphatidylethanolamine from CDP-. Phosphatidylethanolamine is a glycerophospholipid that, together with phosphatidylcholine, constitutes more than half of the total phospholipids in eukaryotic cell membranes. We determined that the mutation defined dramatically reduces the enzymatic activity of EPT1, thereby hindering the final step in phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis. Additionally, due to central nervous system inaccessibility we undertook quantification of phosphatidylethanolamine levels and species in patient and control blood samples as an indication of  phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis. Although this revealed alteration to levels of specific phosphatidylethanolamine  acyl species in patients, overall phosphatidylethanolamine levels were broadly unaffected indicating that in blood EPT1 inactivity may be compensated for, in part, via alternate biochemical pathways. These studies define the first human disorder arising due to defective CDP- biosynthesis and provide new insight into the role of Kennedy pathway components in human neurological function.© The Author (2017).

Citrate is imported from the circulation across the plasma membrane into  cells mainly by the sodium-dependent citrate transporter (NaCT; SLC13A5). Deletion of NaCT from mice led to metabolic changes similar to caloric restriction; therefore, NaCT has been proposed as an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. In this study, we expressed mouse and human NaCT into Xenopus oocytes and examined some basic functional properties of those transporters. Interestingly, striking differences were found between mouse and human NaCT with respect to their sensitivities to citric acid cycle intermediates as substrates for these transporters. Mouse NaCT had at least 20- to 800-fold higher affinity for these intermediates than human NaCT. Mouse NaCT is fully active at physiologic plasma levels of citrate, but its human counterpart is not. Replacement of extracellular sodium by other monovalent cations revealed that human NaCT was markedly less dependent on extracellular sodium than mouse NaCT. The low sensitivity of human NaCT for citrate raises questions about the translatability of this target from the mouse to the human situation and raises doubts about the validity of this transporter as a therapeutic target for the treatment of metabolic diseases in humans.Copyright © 2015 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30249323>Effect of Phyllanthus emblica L. fruit on methionine and choline-deficiency diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Phyllanthus emblica L. fruit contains abundant bioactive components and exhibits a variety of biological activities. In this study, the hepatoprotective effect of water extract of P. emblica (WEPE) on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) was evaluated. C57BL/6 mice were fed methionine and choline-deficiency diet (MCD diet) for 4 or 8 weeks to induce NASH. Results showed that administration of WEPE could significantly reduce serum AST and ALT as compared to MCD diet-alone group. Administration of WEPE could significantly decrease lipid peroxidation and CYP2E1 mRNA expression, and elevate the antioxidant activities in mice livers. In addition, administration of WEPE after 8 weeks could significantly decrease the mRNA expressions of TNF-α and IL-1β in mice livers, but have less improving effect of hepatic steatosis and mononuclear cell infiltration. Taken together, MCD diet might cause serious hepatic steatosis and mild inflammation in mice livers, but administration of WEPE could ameliorate the rapid progression of NASH.Copyright © 2018.

Given the therapeutic importance and conflicting findings regarding the potential for healing the histopathologic features of NASH in humans, particularly fibrosis, we investigated the reversibility of NASH-related findings in Wistar rats fed a choline-deficient and iron-supplemented l-amino acid-defined (CDAA) diet for 12weeks, with a recovery period of 7weeks, during which the diets were switched to a choline-sufficient and iron-supplemented l-amino acid-defined (CSAA) one. Analysis showed that steatosis and inflammation were significantly resolved by the end of the recovery period, along with decreases in AST and ALT activities within 4weeks. In contrast, fibrosis remained even after the recovery period, to an extent similar to that in continuously CDAA-fed animals. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and immunohistochemical investigations revealed that expression of some factors indicating oxidative stress (CYP2E1, 4-HNE, and iNOS) were elevated, whereas catalase and SOD1 were decreased, and a hypoxic state and CD34-positive neovascularization were evident even after the recovery period, although the fibrogenesis pathway by activated α-SMA-positive hepatic stellate cells via TGF-β and TIMPs decreased to the CSAA group level. In conclusion, persistent fibrosis was noted after the recovery period of 7weeks, possibly due to sustained hypoxia and oxidative stress supposedly caused by capillarization. Otherwise, histopathological features of steatosis and inflammation, as well as serum AST and ALT activities, were recovered.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We investigated genetic factors associated with the development of HCC in patients with a sustained virologic response (SVR) to treatment for chronic HCV infection.We obtained genomic DNA from 457 patients in Japan with a SVR to interferon-based treatment for chronic HCV infection from 2007 through 2015. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS), followed by a replication analysis of 79 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in an independent set of 486 patients in Japan. The study end point was HCC diagnosis or confirmation of lack of HCC (at follow-up examinations until December 2014 in the GWAS cohort, and until January 2016 in the replication cohort). We collected clinical and laboratory data from all patients. We analyzed expression levels of candidate gene variants in human hepatic stellate cells, rats with steatohepatitis caused by a choline-deficient L-amino acid-defined diet, and a mouse model of  injury caused by administration of carbon tetrachloride. We also analyzed expression levels in  tissues of patients with chronic HCV infection with different stages of fibrosis or tumors vs patients without HCV infection (controls).We found a strong association between the SNP rs17047200, located within the intron of the tolloid like 1 gene (TLL1) on chromosome 4, and development of HCC; there was a genome-wide level of significance when the results of the GWAS and replication study were combined (odds ratio, 2.37; P = 2.66 × 10). Multivariate analysis showed rs17047200 AT/TT to be an independent risk factor for HCC (hazard ratio, 1.78; P = .008), along with male sex, older age, lower level of albumin, advanced stage of hepatic fibrosis, presence of diabetes, and higher post-treatment level of α-fetoprotein. Combining the rs17047200 genotype with other factors, we developed prediction models for HCC development in patients with mild or advanced hepatic fibrosis. Levels of TLL1 messenger RNA (mRNA) in human hepatic stellate cells increased with activation. Levels of Tll1 mRNA increased in  tissues of rodents with hepatic fibrogenesis compared with controls. Levels of TLL1 mRNA increased in  tissues of patients with progression of fibrosis. Gene expression levels of TLL1 short variants, including isoform 2, were higher in patients with rs17047200 AT/TT.In a GWAS, we identified the association between the SNP rs17047200, within the intron of TLL1, and development of HCC in patients who achieved an SVR to treatment for chronic HCV infection. We found levels of Tll1/TLL1 mRNA to be increased in rodent models of  injury and  tissues of patients with fibrosis, compared with controls. We propose that this SNP might affect splicing of TLL1 mRNA, yielding short variants with high catalytic activity that accelerates hepatic fibrogenesis and carcinogenesis. Further studies are needed to determine how rs17047200 affects TLL1 mRNA levels, splicing, and translation, as well as the prevalence of this variant among other patients with HCC. Tests for the TLL1 SNP might be used to identify patients at risk for HCC after an SVR to treatment of HCV infection.Copyright © 2017 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The hypothesis that PFOS causes steatosis and other hepatic effects by forming an ion pair with choline was examined. C57BL/6 mice were fed either a control diet or a marginal methionine/choline-deficient (mMCD) diet, with and without 0.003, 0.006, or 0.012% potassium PFOS. Dietary PFOS caused a dose-dependent decrease in body weight, and increases in the relative  weight, hepatic triglyceride concentration and serum markers of  toxicity and oxidative stress. Some of these effects were exacerbated in mice fed the mMCD diet supplemented with 0.012% PFOS compared with those fed the control diet supplemented with 0.012% PFOS. Surprisingly, serum PFOS concentrations were higher while  PFOS concentrations were lower in mMCD-fed mice compared with corresponding control-fed mice. To determine if supplemental dietary choline could prevent PFOS-induced hepatic effects, C57BL/6 mice were fed a control diet, or a choline supplemental diet (1.2%) with or without 0.003% PFOS. Lipidomic analysis demonstrated that PFOS caused alterations in hepatic lipid metabolism in the PFOS-fed mice compared with controls, and supplemental dietary choline prevented these PFOS-induced changes. Interestingly, dietary choline supplementation also prevented PFOS-induced oxidative damage. These studies are the first to suggest that PFOS may cause hepatic steatosis and oxidative stress by effectively reducing the choline required for hepatic VLDL production and export by forming an ion pair with choline, and suggest that choline supplementation may prevent and/or treat PFOS-induced hepatic steatosis and oxidative stress.© The Author 2016.

MCLR toxicity is dependent on cellular uptake through the organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) transporters. Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) progresses through multiple stages, alters expression of hepatic OATPs, and is associated with chronic kidney disease. The purpose of this study was to determine whether NAFLD increases systemic exposure to MCLR and influences acute  and kidney toxicities. Rats were fed a control diet or two dietary models of NAFLD; methionine and choline deficient (MCD) or high fat/high cholesterol (HFHC). Two studies were performed in these groups: 1) a single dose intravenous toxicokinetic study (20 μg/kg), and 2) a single dose intraperitoneal toxicity study (60 μg/kg). Compared to control rats, plasma MCLR area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) in MCD rats doubled, whereas biliary clearance (Cl) was unchanged; in contrast, plasma AUC in HFHC rats was unchanged, whereas Cl approximately doubled. Less MCLR bound to PP2A was observed in the  of MCD rats. This shift in exposure decreased the severity of  pathology only in the MCD rats after a single toxic dose of MCLR (60 μg/kg). In contrast, the single toxic dose of MCLR increased hepatic inflammation, plasma cholesterol, proteinuria, and urinary KIM1 in HFHC rats more than MCLR exposed control rats. In conclusion, rodent models of NAFLD alter MCLR toxicokinetics and acute toxicity and may have implications for  and kidney pathologies in NAFLD patients.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We therefore fed ob/ob mice with control or MCD diet for 5 weeks. MCD-feeding increased adipose triglyceride lipase and hormone sensitive lipase activities in all adipose depots which may be attributed to increased systemic FGF21 levels. The highest lipase enzyme activity was exhibited by visceral WAT. Non-esterified  acid (NEFA)-18:2n6 was the predominantly elevated FA species in serum and  of MCD-fed ob/ob mice, while overall serum total  acid (TFA) composition was reduced.

Autophagy has emerged as a critical lysosomal pathway that maintains cell function and survival through the degradation of cellular components such as organelles and proteins. The goal of this study was to elucidate the role of autophagy in MCD-induced steatosis, fibrosis, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in mice. Mice were fed with MCD diet and treated with rapamycin (an autophagy enhancer) or chloroquine (an autophagy inhibitor) for 10 weeks.  injury was evaluated biochemically and histologically together with hepatic gene expression analysis. Autophagic flux was impaired in livers of mice fed with MCD diet, evidenced by reduced ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I and increased protein expression of p62. It was found that autophagy activation by rapamycin attenuated MCD-induced steatosis, fibrosis, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ER stress. By contrast, MCD mice treated with chloroquine developed more  injury. In conclusions, the autophagic pathway plays an important protective role in MCD-induced advanced NASH.

In this study, we evaluated adaptive thermogenesis and metabolic profile of a mouse with Arβ2 knockout (ARβ2KO). At room temperature, ARβ2KO mice have normal core temperature and, upon acute cold exposure (4 °C for 4 h), ARβ2KO mice accelerate energy expenditure normally and attempt to maintain body temperature. ARβ2KO mice also exhibited normal interscapular BAT thermal profiles during a 30-min infusion of norepinephrine or dobutamine, possibly due to marked elevation of interscapular BAT (iBAT) and of Arβ1, and Arβ3 mRNA levels. In addition, ARβ2KO mice exhibit similar body weight, adiposity, fasting plasma glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides when compared with WT controls, but exhibit marked fasting hyperinsulinemia and elevation in hepatic Pepck (Pck1) mRNA levels. The animals were fed a high-fat diet (40% fat) for 6 weeks, ARβ2KO mice doubled their caloric intake, accelerated energy expenditure, and induced Ucp1 expression in a manner similar to WT controls, exhibiting a similar body weight gain and increase in the size of white adipocytes to the WT controls. However, ARβ2KO mice maintain fasting hyperglycemia as compared with WT controls despite very elevated insulin levels, but similar degrees of  steatosis and hyperlipidemia. In conclusion, inactivation of the ARβ2KO pathway preserves cold- and diet-induced adaptive thermogenesis but disrupts glucose homeostasis possibly by accelerating hepatic glucose production and insulin secretion.

In the current study we assessed the therapeutic effect of butein administration on  function tests, oxidative stress, antioxidants, lipid abnormalities, serum inflammatory cytokines, and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species levels, in rats with methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet induced NAFLD. Male Wistar rats were treated with MCD diet with/without butein (200 mg/kg body wt. orally) for 6 weeks. The protective effect of butein, were evident from decreased transaminase activities, restoration of albumin, globulin, albumin/globulin ratio, and oxidants in serum (P < 0.01), further it improved  antioxidant status (P < 0.01). Butein significantly lowered lipid profile parameters (P < 0.01), suppressed inflammatory cytokines (P < 0.01), and improved  histology. Further to understand the possible mechanism behind the hepatoprotective and lipid lowering effect of butein, the activities of heme oxygenase (HO1), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured. We found that butein supplementation significantly decreased the activity of HO1 (P < 0.001), and increased the activity of MPO (P < 0.001).

Cows fed RPC in transition tended to produce more milk (43.5 vs. 41.3 kg/d) and energy-corrected milk (44.2 vs. 42.0 kg/d) without increasing DM intake (23.8 vs. 23.2 kg/d) during the first 15 wk PP, and tended to produce more milk over the first 40 wk PP (37.1 vs. 35.0 kg/d). Energy balance of cows fed RPC was more negative at wk 2, 3, and 6 PP, but mean circulating concentrations of  acids and β-hydroxybutyrate did not differ from those of cows not fed RPC. Despite differences in energy balance at 2 and 3 wk PP, mean concentration of hepatic triacylglycerol did not differ between RPC treatments. Feeding RPC reduced the daily prevalence of subclinical hypocalcemia from 25.5 to 10.5%, as defined by concentrations of total Ca of <8.0 mg/dL in serum in the first 7 d PP. Pregnancy at first artificial insemination tended to be greater for cows fed RPC (41.3 vs. 23.6%), but the proportion of pregnant cows did not differ by 40 wk PP. Heifers born from singleton calvings from cows fed RPC tended to experience greater daily gain between birth and 50 wk of age than heifers from cows not supplemented with RPC. Feeding RPC for approximately 38 d during the transition period tended to increase yield of milk for 40 wk regardless of amount of energy consumed during the pregnant, nonlactating period.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

In addition to the classical "Two-hit" theory, NAFLD has been recognized as a typical gut microbiota-related disease because of the intricate role of gut microbiota in maintaining human health and disease formation. Moreover, gut microbiota is even regarded as a "metabolic organ" that play complementary roles to that of  in many aspects. The mechanisms underlying gut microbiota-mediated development of NAFLD include modulation of host energy metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and bile acid and choline metabolism. As a result, gut microbiota have been emerging as a novel therapeutic target for NAFLD by manipulating it in various ways, including probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, antibiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, and herbal components. In this review, we summarized the most recent advances in gut microbiota-mediated mechanisms, as well as gut microbiota-targeted therapies on NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26895034>Regulation of Inflammation by IL-17A and IL-17F Modulates Non-Alcoholic  Disease Pathogenesis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) has become the most common chronic  disease worldwide. While it is well-accepted that inflammation is central to NAFLD pathogenesis, the immune pathway(s) orchestrating disease progression are poorly defined. Notably, IL-17RA signaling, via IL-17A, plays an important role in obesity-driven NAFLD pathogenesis. However, the role of the IL-17F, another IL-17RA ligand, in NAFLD pathogenesis has not been examined. Further, the cell types expressing IL-17RA and producing IL-17RA ligands in the pathogenesis of NAFLD have not been defined. Here, IL-17RA-/-, IL-17A-/-, IL-17F-/- and wild-type (WT) mice were fed either standard chow diet or methionine and choline deficient diet (MCDD)--a diet known to induce steatosis and hepatic inflammation through beta-oxidation dysfunction--and hepatic inflammation and NAFLD progression were subsequently quantified. MCDD feeding augmented hepatic IL-17RA expression and significantly increased hepatic infiltration of macrophages and IL-17A and IL-17F producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in WT mice. In contrast, IL-17RA-/-, IL-17A-/-, and IL-17F-/- mice, despite increased steatosis, exhibited significant protection from hepatocellular damage compared to WT controls. Protection from hepatocellular damage correlated with decreased levels of hepatic T-cell and macrophage infiltration and decreased expression of inflammatory mediators associated with NAFLD. In sum, our results indicate that the IL-17 axis also plays a role in a MCDD-induced model of NAFLD pathogenesis. Further, we show for the first time that IL-17F, and not only IL-17A, plays an important role in NAFLD driven inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26891736>Vaccenic acid suppresses intestinal inflammation by increasing anandamide and related N-acylethanolamines in the JCR:LA-cp rat.</a></h2><p>Vaccenic acid (VA), the predominant ruminant-derivedtransfat in the food chain, ameliorates hyperlipidemia, yet mechanisms remain elusive. We investigated whether VA could influence tissue endocannabinoids (ECs) by altering the availability of their biosynthetic precursor, arachidonic acid (AA), in membrane phospholipids (PLs). JCR:LA-cprats were assigned to a control diet with or without VA (1% w/w),cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) (1% w/w) or VA+CLA (1% + 0.5% w/w) for 8 weeks. VA reduced the EC, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), in the  and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) relative to control diet (P< 0.001), but did not change AA in tissue PLs. There was no additive effect of combining VA+CLA on 2-AG relative to VA alone (P> 0.05). Interestingly, VA increased jejunal concentrations of anandamide and those of the noncannabinoid signaling molecules, oleoylethanolamide and palmitoylethanolamide, relative to control diet (P< 0.05). This was consistent with a lower jejunal protein abundance (but not activity) of their degrading enzyme,  acid amide hydrolase, as well as the mRNA expression of TNFα and interleukin 1β (P< 0.05). The ability of VA to reduce 2-AG in the  and VAT provides a potential mechanistic explanation to alleviate ectopic lipid accumulation. The opposing regulation of ECs and other noncannabinoid lipid signaling molecules by VA suggests an activation of benefit via the EC system in the intestine.Copyright © 2016 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26496771>A modified choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented diet reduces morbidity and retains a  progenitor cell response in mice.</a></h2><p>The choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented (CDE) dietary model induces chronic  damage, and stimulates  progenitor cell (LPC)-mediated repair. Long-term CDE administration leads to hepatocellular carcinoma in rodents and lineage-tracing studies show that LPCs differentiate into functional hepatocytes in this model. The CDE diet was first modified for mice by our laboratory by separately administering choline-deficient chow and ethionine in the drinking water (CD+E diet). Although this CD+E diet is widely used, concerns with variability in weight loss, morbidity, mortality and LPC response have been raised by researchers who have adopted this model. We propose that these inconsistencies are due to differential consumption of chow and ethionine in the drinking water, and that incorporating ethionine in the choline-deficient chow, and altering the strength, will achieve better outcomes. Therefore, C57Bl/6 mice, 5 and 6 weeks of age, were fed an all-inclusive CDE diet of various strengths (67% to 100%) for 3 weeks. The LPC response was quantitated and cell lines were derived. We found that animal survival, LPC response and  damage are correlated with CDE diet strength. The 67% and 75% CDE diet administered to mice older than 5 weeks and greater than 18 g provides a consistent and acceptable level of animal welfare and induces a substantial LPC response, permitting their isolation and establishment of cell lines. This study shows that an all-inclusive CDE diet for mice reproducibly induces an LPC response conducive to in vivo studies and isolation, whilst minimizing morbidity and mortality.© 2015.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have emerged as effective therapies in treating cancer by exploiting this kinase dependency. The TKI erlotinib targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), whereas sunitinib targets primarily vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR).TKIs that impact the function of non-malignant cells and have on- and off-target toxicities, including cardiotoxicities. Cardiotoxicity is very rare in patients treated with erlotinib, but considerably more common after sunitinib treatment. We hypothesized that the deleterious effects of TKIs on the heart were related to their impact on cardiac metabolism.  Female FVB/N mice (10/group) were treated with therapeutic doses of sunitinib (40 mg/kg), erlotinib (50 mg/kg), or vehicle daily for two weeks. Echocardiographic assessment of the heart in vivo was performed at baseline and on Day 14. Heart, skeletal muscle,  and serum were flash frozen and prepped for non-targeted GC-MS metabolomics analysis.  Compared to vehicle-treated controls, sunitinib-treated mice had significant decreases in systolic function, whereas erlotinib-treated mice did not. Non-targeted metabolomics analysis of heart identified significant decreases in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), arachidonic acid (AA)/ eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), O-phosphocolamine, and 6-hydroxynicotinic acid after sunitinib treatment. DHA was significantly decreased in skeletal muscle (quadriceps femoris), while elevated cholesterol was identified in  and elevated  identified in serum. In contrast, erlotinib affected only one metabolite (spermidine significantly increased).  Mice treated with sunitinib exhibited systolic dysfunction within two weeks, with significantly lower heart and skeletal muscle levels of long chain omega-3  acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), arachidonic acid (AA)/eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and increased serum O-phosphocholine phospholipid. This is the first link between sunitinib-induced cardiotoxicity and depletion of the polyunsaturated  acids (PUFAs) and inflammatory mediators DHA and AA/EPA in the heart. These compounds have important roles in maintaining mitochondrial function, and their loss may contribute to cardiac dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25379695>p-Synephrine suppresses glucose production but not lipid accumulation in H4IIE  cells.</a></h2><p>p-Synephrine, the primary protoalkaloid in the extract of bitter orange and other citrus species, has gained interest due to its lipolytic activity in adipose tissues. We previously found that p-synephrine stimulates glucose consumption via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in L6 skeletal muscle cells. This study investigated the effect of p-synephrine on glucose production and lipid accumulation in H4IIE rat  cells. Glucose production was increased in H4llE cells that were incubated in glucose-free medium but decreased dose dependently (1-100 μM) with p-synephrine treatment. Protein levels of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) were also decreased by treatment (4 h) with p-synephrine. Antagonists against α- and β-adrenergic receptors (phentolamine and propranolol) and other inhibitors against signaling molecules did not interrupt p-synephrine-induced suppression in glucose production. However, H7 (an inhibitor of serine/threonine kinases PKA, PKC, and PKG) significantly blocked p-synephrine-induced suppression of glucose production and further increased basal glucose production. Unlike the suppressive effect on glucose production, p-synephrine failed to affect palmitic acid-induced cytoplasmic lipid accumulation. Protein levels of  acid synthase (FAS) and phosphorylation levels of AMPK and ACC were not changed by p-synephrine. Altogether, p-synephrine can suppress glucose production but does not affect lipid accumulation in H4IIE  cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22777615>Hepatic injury due to combined choline-deprivation and thioacetamide administration: an experimental approach to  diseases.</a></h2><p>The induction of prolonged choline-deprivation (CD) in rats receiving thioacetamide (TAA) is an experimental approach of mild hepatotoxicity that could resemble commonly presented cases in clinical practice (in which states of malnutrition and/or alcoholism are complicated by the development of other -associated diseases).The present study aimed to investigate the time-dependent effects of a 30-, a 60- and a 90-day dietary CD and/or TAA administration on the adult rat  histopathology and the serum markers of hepatic functional integrity.Rats were divided into four main groups: (a) control, (b) CD, (c) TAA and (d) CD + TAA. Dietary CD was provoked through the administration of choline-deficient diet, while TAA administration was performed ad libitum through the drinking water (300 mg/l of drinking water).Histological examination of the CD + TAA  sections revealed micro- and macro-vesicular steatosis with degeneration and primary fibrosis at day 30, to extensive steatosis and fibrosis at day 90. Steatosis was mostly of the macrovesicular type, involving all zones of the lobule, while inflammatory infiltrate consisted of foci of acute and chronic inflammatory cells randomly distributed in the lobule. These changes were accompanied by gradually increasing mitotic activity, as well as by a constantly high alpha-smooth muscle actin immunohistochemical staining. The determination of hepatocellular injury markers such as the serum enzyme levels' of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase demonstrated a decrease at day 30 (they returned to control levels at days 60 and 90). However, the determination of those serum enzymes used for the assessment of cholestatic  injury (gamma-glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase) revealed a constant (time-independent) statistically-significant increase versus control values.Long-term combined dietary CD and TAA administration could be a more realistic experimental approach to human  diseases involving severe steatosis, fibrosis, stellate cell activation and significant regenerative hepatocellular response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24941342>Standardized Salvia miltiorrhiza extract suppresses hepatic stellate cell activation and attenuates steatohepatitis induced by a methionine-choline deficient diet in mice.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to examine the effect of standardized extract of Salvia miltiorrhiza (SME) on gene and protein expression of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-related factors in activated human hepatic stellate cells (HSC), and in mice with steatohepatitis induced by a methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet. Male C57BL/6J mice were placed on an MCD or control diet for 8 weeks and SME (0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg body weight) was administered orally every other day for 4 or 6 weeks. HSCs from the LX-2 cell line were treated with transforming growth factor β-1 (TGF-β1) or TGF-β1 plus SME (0.1-10 μg/mL). To investigate the effect of SME on reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced condition, LX-2 cells were treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or H2O2 plus SME (0.1-100 μg/mL). MCD administration for 12 weeks increased mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), TGF-β1, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), C-reactive protein (CRP), α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), type I collagen, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9. TGF-β1-induced LX-2 cells exhibited similar gene expression patterns. SME treatment significantly reduced the mRNA and protein expression of NASH-related factors in the mouse model and HSCs. Histopathological  analysis showed improved non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) activity and fibrosis score in SME-treated mice. The in vivo studies showed that SME had a significant effect at low doses. These results suggest that SME might be a potential therapeutic candidate for NAFLD treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27321734>Effects of Nonalcoholic  Disease on Hepatic CYP2B1 and in Vivo Bupropion Disposition in Rats Fed a High-Fat or Methionine/Choline-Deficient Diet.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) refers to hepatic pathologies, including simple  (SFL), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, and cirrhosis, that may progress to hepatocellular carcinoma. These  disease states may affect the activity and expression levels of drug-metabolizing enzymes, potentially resulting in an alteration in the pharmacokinetics, therapeutic efficacy, and safety of drugs. This study investigated the hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B1-modulating effect of a specific NAFLD state in dietary rat models. Sprague-Dawley rats were given a methionine/choline-deficient (MCD) or high-fat (HF) diet to induce NASH and SFL, respectively. The induction of these disease states was confirmed by plasma chemistry and  histological analysis. Both the protein and mRNA levels of hepatic CYP2B1 were considerably reduced in MCD diet-fed rats; however, they were similar between the HF diet-fed and control rats. Consistently, the enzyme-kinetic and pharmacokinetic parameters for CYP2B1-mediated bupropion metabolism were considerably reduced in MCD diet-fed rats; however, they were also similar between the HF diet-fed and control rats. These results may promote a better understanding of the influence of NAFLD on CYP2B1-mediated metabolism, which could have important implications for the safety and pharmacokinetics of drug substrates for the CYP2B subfamily in patients with NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27014939>Bisphenol A Induces  by an Endocannabinoid-Mediated Positive Feedback Loop.</a></h2><p>The xenoestrogen bisphenol A (BPA) is a widespread plasticizer detectable within several ecosystems. BPA is considered a metabolic disruptor, affecting different organs; however, little is known about its mechanism of action in the , in which it triggers triglyceride accumulation. Adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to BPA developed hepatosteatosis, which was associated with an increase in the  levels of the obesogenic endocannabinoids 2-arachidonoylglycerol and anandamide and a concomitant decrease in palmitoylethanolamide. These changes were associated with variations in the expression of key endocannabinoid catabolic and metabolic enzymes and an increase in the expression of the endocannabinoid receptor cnr1. Acute and chronic in vitro treatments with nano- and micromolar BPA doses showed increased anandamide levels in line with decreased activity of  acid amide hydrolase, the main anandamide hydrolytic enzyme, and induced triglyceride accumulation in HHL-5 cells in a CB1-dependent manner. We conclude that BPA is able to produce hepatosteatosis in zebrafish and human hepatocytes by up-regulating the endocannabinoid system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30283798> rs139051 is associated with phospholipid metabolite profile and hepatic inflammation in nonalcoholic  disease.</a></h2><p>To investigate the effect of  polymorphisms on serum lipidomics and pathological characteristics in nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD).Thirty-four biopsy-proven NAFLD patients from Northern, Central, and Southern China were subjected to stratification by genotyping their single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in .

In succession, correlation analysis revealed the association of -related lipid profile and hepatic pathological characteristics on a basis of steatosis, activity, and fibrosis assessment. The variant-based scoring of hepatocyte steatosis, ballooning, lobular inflammation, and  fibrosis was finally performed so as to uncover the actions of lipidomics-affecting  SNPs in NAFLD-specific pathological alterations.

In particular, the increase of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and significant decrease of other phospholipids: lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine and diphosphaglicerol were observed. The levels of monounsaturated (erucic, nervonic, oleic) and polyunsaturated (eicosatrienoic, docosatrienoic, arachidonic)  acids were increased; meanwhile the content of diunsaturated acids was decreased. The NSE administration (50 mg/kg of body weight) caused restoration of the phospholipids content in the  of rats with diet-induced IR that highly correlated with the decrease in plasma insulin level and the improvement of insulin sensitivity. Moreover, the effect of NSE was accompanied by the normalization of  acids composition of phospholipids that could be related to modulating influence of NSE on the activity of the main  acid desaturases.

Mice were subsequently exposed to either PCB126 (4.9mg/kg) or the PCB mixture, Arcolor1260 (20mg/kg) and analyzed for inflammatory, calorimetry and metabolic parameters. Consistent with the literature, MCD diet-fed mice demonstrated steatosis, indicative of a compromised . Mice fed the MCD-diet and subsequently exposed to PCB126 showed observable wasting syndrome leading to mortality. PCB126 and Aroclor1260 exposure worsened hepatic fibrosis exhibited by the MCD groups. Interestingly, PCB126 but not Aroclor1260 induced steatosis and inflammation in CD-fed mice. Mice with  injury and subsequently exposed to PCBs also manifested metabolic disturbances due to alterations in hepatic gene expression. Furthermore, PCB exposure in MCD-fed mice led to extra-hepatic toxicity such as upregulated circulating inflammatory biomarkers, implicating endothelial cell dysfunction.

It is still unknown how only limited patients with  develop NASH. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α is one of the key molecules in initiating the vicious circle of inflammations. Nardilysin (N-arginine dibasic convertase; Nrd1), a zinc metalloendopeptidase of the M16 family, enhances ectodomain shedding of TNF-α, resulting in the activation of inflammatory responses. In this study, we aimed to examine the role of Nrd1 in the development of NASH. Nrd1+/+ and Nrd1-/- mice were fed a control choline-supplemented amino acid-defined (CSAA) diet or a choline-deficient amino acid-defined (CDAA) diet.  deposits were accumulated in the livers of both Nrd1+/+ and Nrd1-/- mice by the administration of the CSAA or CDAA diets, although the amount of  triglyceride in Nrd1-/- mice was lower than that in Nrd1+/+ mice. Serum alanine aminotransferase levels were increased in Nrd1+/+ mice but not in Nrd1-/- mice fed the CDAA diet. mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines were decreased in Nrd1-/- mice than in Nrd1+/+ mice fed the CDAA diet. While TNF-α protein was detected in both Nrd1+/+ and Nrd1-/- mouse livers fed the CDAA diet, secretion of TNF-α in Nrd1-/- mice was significantly less than that in Nrd1+/+ mice, indicating the decreased TNF-α shedding in Nrd1-/- mouse .

The inhibition of eCBs degradation by  acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) blockade, is the best-known option to increase -acyl--(NAEs)-mediated signaling. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that intranasal delivery is an effective route for different FAAH inhibitors, such as URB597 and PF-04457845. URB597 and PF-04457845 were subchronically administered in C57BL/6 male mice every other day for 20 days for overall 10 drug treatment, and compared for their ability to inhibit FAAH activity by the way of three different routes of administration: intranasal (i.n.), intraperitoneal (i.p.) and oral (p.o.). Lastly, we compared the efficacy of the three routes in terms of URB597-induced increase of NAEs levels in  and in different brain areas. Results: We show that PF-04457845 potently inhibits FAAH regardless the route selected, and that URB597 was less effective in the brain after p.o. administration while reached similar effects by i.n. and i.p. routes. Intranasal URB597 delivery always increased NAEs levels in brain areas, whereas a parallel increase was not observed in the . By showing the efficacy of intranasal FAAH inhibition, we provide evidence that nose-to-brain delivery is a suitable alternative to enhance brain eCB tone for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders and improve patients' compliance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28875318>Influence of gut microbiota on the development and progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterized by the presence of steatosis, inflammation, and ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes, with or without fibrosis. The prevalence of NASH has increased with the obesity epidemic, but its etiology is multifactorial. The current studies suggest the role of gut microbiota in the development and progression of NASH. The aim is to review the studies that investigate the relationship between gut microbiota and NASH. These review also discusses the pathophysiological mechanisms and the influence of diet on the gut- axis.The available literature has proposed mechanisms for an association between gut microbiota and NASH, such as: modification energy homeostasis, lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-endotoxemia, increased endogenous production of ethanol, and alteration in the metabolism of bile acid and choline. There is evidence to suggest that NASH patients have a higher prevalence of bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine and changes in the composition of the gut microbiota. However, there is still a controversy regarding the microbiome profile in this population. The abundance of Bacteroidetes phylum may be increased, decreased, or unaltered in NASH patients. There is an increase in the Escherichia and Bacteroides genus. There is depletion of certain taxa, such as Prevotella and Faecalibacterium.Although few studies have evaluated the composition of the gut microbiota in patients with NASH, it is observed that these individuals have a distinct gut microbiota, compared to the control groups, which explains, at least in part, the genesis and progression of the disease through multiple mechanisms. Modulation of the gut microbiota through diet control offers new challenges for future studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26881047>In Situ Evaluation of Oxidative Stress in Rat  Induced by a Methionine- and Choline-Deficient Diet.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is a serious health problem in developed countries. We documented the effects of feeding with a NAFLD-inducing, methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet, for 1-4 weeks on rat  oxidative stress, with respect to a control diet. Glycogen, neutral lipids, ROS, peroxidated proteins, and SOD2 were investigated using histochemical procedures; ATP, GSH, and TBARS concentrations were investigated by biochemical dosages, and SOD2 expression was investigated by Western Blotting. In the 4-week-diet period, glycogen stores decreased whereas lipid droplets, ROS, and peroxidated proteins expression (especially around lipid droplets of hepatocytes) increased. SOD2 immunostaining decreased in poorly steatotic hepatocytes but increased in the thin cytoplasm of macrosteatotic cells; a trend towards a quantitative decrease of SOD expression in homogenates occurred after 3 weeks. ATP and GSH values were significantly lower for rats fed with the MCD diet with respect to the controls. An increase of TBARS in the last period of the diet is in keeping with the high ROS production and low antioxidant defense; these TBARS may promote protein peroxidation around lipid droplets. Since these proteins play key roles in lipid mobilization, storage, and metabolism, this last information appears significant, as it points towards a previously misconsidered target of NAFLD-associated oxidative stress that might be responsible for lipid dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25282357>Niclosamide -induced mild mitochondrial uncoupling improves diabetic symptoms in mice.</a></h2><p>Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has reached an epidemic level globally. Most current treatments ameliorate the hyperglycemic symptom of the disease but are not effective in correcting its underlying cause. One important causal factor of T2D is ectopic accumulation of lipids in metabolically sensitive organs such as  and muscle. Mitochondrial uncoupling, which reduces cellular energy efficiency and increases lipid oxidation, is an appealing therapeutic strategy. The challenge, however, is to discover safe mitochondrial uncouplers for practical use. Niclosamide is an anthelmintic drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration that uncouples the mitochondria of parasitic worms. Here we show that niclosamide  salt (NEN) uncouples mammalian mitochondria at upper nanomolar concentrations. Oral NEN increases energy expenditure and lipid metabolism in mice. It is also efficacious in preventing and treating hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance induced by a high-fat diet. Moreover, it improves glycemic control and delays disease progression in db/db mice. Given the well-documented safety profile of NEN, our study provides a potentially new and practical pharmacological approach for treating T2D.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28044208>Hepatic vagus nerve regulates Kupffer cell activation via α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease ranges from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Kupffer cells play a central role in promoting hepatic inflammation, which leads to the development of NASH. We investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of hepatic vagus-mediated stimulation of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) on Kupffer cells in NASH pathogenesis.Wild-type (WT) mice undergoing hepatic vagotomy (HV) were fed a methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet for 1 week. α7nAChR knockout (α7KO) chimeric mice were generated by transplanting α7KO bone marrow cells into irradiated and Kupffer cell-deleted WT recipients. Kupffer cells were isolated from WT mice and treated with α7nAChR agonist under stimulation by lipopolysaccharide and/or palmitic acid.HV aggravated MCD diet-induced NASH in both steatosis and inflammation. The hepatic inflammatory response, including the upregulation of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukin (IL)-12, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), was accelerated in HV mice, accompanied by the downregulation of PPARα pathway genes. Kupffer cells were highly activated via the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) in MCD diet-fed HV mice. The α7nAchR agonist suppressed the inflammatory response of primary Kupffer cells induced by lipopolysaccharide and palmitic acid by attenuating the NF-κB cascade. α7KO chimeric mice fed an MCD diet for 1 week developed advanced NASH with highly activated Kupffer cells. The hepatic expression of TNFα, IL-12, and MCP-1 was upregulated in α7KO chimeric mice, accompanied by abnormal lipid metabolism.Hepatic vagus activity regulates the inflammatory response of Kupffer cells via α7nAChR in NASH development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25775474>Dietary triacylglycerols with palmitic acid in the sn-2 position modulate levels of N-acylethanolamides in rat tissues.</a></h2><p>Several evidences suggest that the position of palmitic acid (PA) in dietary triacylglycerol (TAG) influences different biological functions. We aimed at evaluating whether dietary fat with highly enriched (87%) PA in sn-2 position (Hsn-2 PA), by increasing PA incorporation into tissue phospholipids (PL), modifies  acid profile and biosynthesis of  acid-derived bioactive lipids, such as endocannabinoids and their congeners.Rats were fed for 5 weeks diets containing Hsn-2 PA or fat with PA randomly distributed in TAG with 18.8% PA in sn-2 position (Lsn-2 PA), and similar total PA concentration.  acid profile in different lipid fractions, endocannabinoids and congeners were measured in intestine, , visceral adipose tissue, muscle and brain.Rats on Hsn-2 PA diet had lower levels of anandamide with concomitant increase of its congener palmitoylethanolamide and its precursor PA into visceral adipose tissue phospholipids. In addition, we found an increase of oleoylethanolamide, an avid PPAR alpha ligand, in , muscle and brain, associated to higher levels of its precursor oleic acid in  and muscle, probably derived by elongation and further delta 9 desaturation of PA. Changes in endocannabinoids and congeners were associated to a decrease of circulating TNF alpha after LPS challenge, and to an improved feed efficiency.Dietary Hsn-2 PA, by modifying endocannabinoids and congeners biosynthesis in different tissues may potentially concur in the physiological regulation of energy metabolism, brain function and body fat distribution.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26017539>Mouse models of diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis reproduce the heterogeneity of the human disease.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the potentially progressive form of nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD), is the pandemic  disease of our time. Although there are several animal models of NASH, consensus regarding the optimal model is lacking. We aimed to compare features of NASH in the two most widely-used mouse models: methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet and Western diet.Mice were fed standard chow, MCD diet for 8 weeks, or Western diet (45% energy from fat, predominantly saturated fat, with 0.2% cholesterol, plus drinking water supplemented with fructose and glucose) for 16 weeks.  pathology and metabolic profile were compared.The metabolic profile associated with human NASH was better mimicked by Western diet. Although hepatic steatosis (i.e., triglyceride accumulation) was also more severe,  non-esterified  acid content was lower than in the MCD diet group. NASH was also less severe and less reproducible in the Western diet model, as evidenced by less  cell death/apoptosis, inflammation, ductular reaction, and fibrosis. Various mechanisms implicated in human NASH pathogenesis/progression were also less robust in the Western diet model, including oxidative stress, ER stress, autophagy deregulation, and hedgehog pathway activation.Feeding mice a Western diet models metabolic perturbations that are common in humans with mild NASH, whereas administration of a MCD diet better models the pathobiological mechanisms that cause human NAFLD to progress to advanced NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25316683>Branched-Chain Amino Acid-Rich Supplements Containing Microelements Have Antioxidant Effects on Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis in Mice.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether the administration of antioxidant-rich nutrients, including branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), microelements, and vitamins, both alone and in combination, has a positive impact on  function in a nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) mouse model and identify the mechanisms underlying these effects.Seven-week-old male KKAy mice fed a methionine- and choline-deficient diet (MCD) for 4 weeks were divided into 7 groups and fed the following planned diets for another 4 weeks: group A (normal diet), group B (MCD; control), group C (MCD with rich microelements), group D (MCD with rich BCAAs), group E (MCD with rich microelements and BCAAs), and group F (MCD with rich microelements, BCAAs, and vitamins). We then conducted biochemical assays, histological analyses, immunohistochemistry for 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and 4-hydroxy-2'-nonenal (4-HNE), and Western blotting for insulin glucose signaling, lipid metabolism, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related signaling in  specimens obtained from mice in each group.The morphometric grades of all NASH-related findings and the mean degree of 8-OHdG immunolocalization in groups D-F were significantly lower than those observed in group B. The expression levels of insulin receptor β subunit (IRβ) and p-elF in groups E and F and those of phosphatidyl-inositol 3 kinase (PI3K85), p-AcelCoA, and PERK in group F were similar to those noted in group A.The administration of a combination of antioxidant-rich nutrients, including BCAAs and microelements, is likely to suppress the progression of NASH by reducing oxidative stress, primarily via the downregulation of the ER stress pathway.© 2014 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22860113>Serum levels of choline-containing compounds are associated with aerobic fitness level: the HUNT-study.</a></h2><p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death worldwide, and the number of people at risk is continuously growing. New methods for early risk prediction are therefore needed to actuate prevention strategies before the individuals are diagnosed with CVD. Several studies report that aerobic fitness level, measured as maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2max)), is the single best predictor of future CVD mortality in healthy people. Based on this, we wanted to study differences between healthy individuals with a large difference in VO(2max)-level to identify new biomarkers of low aerobic fitness that may also have potential as early biomarkers of CVD risk.Serum samples from 218 healthy individuals with a low VO(2max) (n = 108, 63 women) or high VO(2max) (n = 110, 64 women) were analysed with MR metabolomics. In addition, standard clinical-chemical analyses for glucose, lipids,  enzymes, micro-CRP, and colorimetric analysis on circulating choline were performed. Individuals in the low VO(2max)-group had increased serum levels of free choline, decreased phosphatidylcholine, increased glucosę and decreased unsaturated  acids compared to the individuals in the high VO(2max)-group.Aerobic fitness dependent differences in serum levels of free choline and phosphatidylcholine are observed. They should be further studied as potential early markers of CVD risk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23598120>Validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for determination of totally nine probe metabolites of cytochrome P450 enzymes and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases.</a></h2><p>A simplified, rapid, and selective liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for the determination of the activities of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) in two separate settings was developed and successfully applied to 8 CYP isoenzymes and UGT2B7 enzyme activities in rat  microsomes. The triple-quadrupole mass spectrometric detection was operated in positive mode for the probe metabolites: CYP1A2 (resorufin), CYP2B6 (hydroxybupropion), CYP2C19 (5-hydroxyomeprazole), CYP2D6 (dextrophan), CYP3A4 (6β-hydroxytestosterone), and UGT2B7 (morphine-3-glucuronide); also in negative mode for CYP2C9 (4-hydroxytolbutamide), CYP2E1 (6-hydroxychloroxazone), and CYP4A (hydroxylauric acid). The metabolic reactions were terminated with acetonitrile, containing metoprolol and acetaminophen as the internal standard for positive and negative ion electrospray ionization, respectively. The method was validated over the concentration range of 25-2500 ng/mL for 5-hydroxyomeprazole, dextrophan, hydroxylauric acid, and morphine-3-glucuronide; 5-500 ng/mL for resorufin; 3-300 ng/mL for hydroxybupropion; 10-1000 ng/mL for 4-hydroxytolbutamide; 40-4000 ng/mL for 6-hydroxychloroxazone; and 63-6300 ng/mL for 6β-hydroxytestosterone. All of the extraction recoveries of these analytes were greater than 85%, except for hydroxylauric acid at mid-concentration with a recovery of 83.2% ± 3.2%. The matrix effects were between 85.8% and 119.9%; the respective within- and between-run precisions were 0.9-12.0% and 2.0-13.9%; and the within- and between-run accuracy levels were 0.6-17.2% and 0.1-15.1%, respectively, for all these analytes. All of the analytes were stable during the assay and storage in the  microsomes of Sprague-Dawley rats. The measurement activity of multiple enzymes was feasible using a cocktail approach. This method proved to be a robust, fast, accurate, specific and sensitive assay, and was successfully used to investigate in vivo enzyme activities of 8 major CYP isoenzymes and UGT2B7 in Sprague-Dawley rats with  livers. By the end of the eighth week, the CD-fed induced  rats showed a significant decrease in the activities of CYP1A2 and UGT2B7 as compared to the standard diet group.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A randomized controlled trial in 3 commercial dairy herds (n = 1,346 cows with group as the experimental unit; experiment 1) and a university research herd (n = 50 cows with cow as the experimental unit; experiment 2) evaluated the use of 100 g/cow per d of commercially available proprietary RPBC supplement (Transition VB, Jefo, St. Hyacinthe, Quebec, Canada), or a placebo, fed 3 wk before to 3 wk after calving. In experiment 2  biopsies were taken at 4 and 14 ± 1 d in milk to measure triacylglycerol concentrations and expression of 28 genes selected to represent relevant aspects of  metabolism. Treatment effects were assessed using multivariable mixed logistic regression models for binary health and reproductive outcomes; linear regression models for milk yield, dry matter intake, and  outcomes; and survival analysis for time insemination and pregnancy. In experiment 1, treatment did not have an effect on the incidence of hyperketonemia (blood β-hydroxybutyrate ≥ 1.2 mmol/L; cumulative incidence to 3 wk postpartum of 28 to 30%), clinical health disorders, or udder edema. The prevalence of anovulation at 8 wk postpartum was 11% in the treatment group and 23% in the control but did not differ statistically given group-level randomization. Pregnancy at first insemination (33 and 35%) and median time to pregnancy to 200 d in milk (96 and 97 d) were not different between treatment and control, respectively. No difference was observed between treatment groups in milk yield or components through the first 3 Dairy Herd Improvement Association test days (44 kg/d in both groups, accounting for parity and components). In experiment 2, there were no differences between treatment groups in feed intake. Mean blood β-hydroxybutyrate was lower at wk 3 in RPBC (0.6 vs. 0.9 ± 0.12 mmol/L) with no difference between treatments for mean blood concentrations of  acids (wk -1 or 1) and β-hydroxybutyrate at wk 1 or 2. The gene for acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1) had lower mRNA abundance in RPBC with no difference between treatments for the other genes, but the expression of half of the genes assessed differed with days in milk.  triacylglycerol was lower in primiparous cows at 4 d in milk in RPBC (2.0 vs. 4.4 ± 1.2%) but not at 14 d in milk (2.2 vs. 3.2 ± 0.97%) with no treatment effect in multiparous cows (4.6 ± 0.8%). Accounting for parity, days in milk, fat and protein percentages, repeated test days, and a random effect of cow, no significant difference was observed between treatments in milk yield across the first 3 Dairy Herd Improvement Association tests (41.2 ± 1.3 in RPBC vs. 38.0 ± 1.4 kg/d in control). Under the diet and management conditions of the field study including low prevalence of clinical health disorders, in experiment 1 we did not detect a benefit of RPBC, but in experiment 2  fat content decreased in primiparous cows.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

Here, we report that hepatocyte Notch activity tracks with disease severity and treatment response in patients with NASH and is similarly increased in a mouse model of diet-induced NASH and  fibrosis. Hepatocyte-specific Notch loss-of-function mouse models showed attenuated NASH-associated  fibrosis, demonstrating causality to obesity-induced  pathology. Conversely, forced activation of hepatocyte Notch induced fibrosis in both chow- and NASH diet-fed mice by increasing Sox9-dependent Osteopontin (Opn) expression and secretion from hepatocytes, which activate resident hepatic stellate cells. In a cross-sectional study, we found that OPN explains the positive correlation between  Notch activity and fibrosis stage in patients. Further, we developed a Notch inhibitor [ antisense oligonucleotide ( ASO)] that reduced fibrosis in NASH diet-fed mice. In summary, these studies demonstrate the pathological role and therapeutic accessibility of the maladaptive hepatocyte Notch response in NASH-associated  fibrosis.Copyright © 2018 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

The effect however, of β-AR blockade in non-cirrhotic NASH is unknown and is as such investigated here. In the presence of the β-blocker propranolol (PRL), mice fed normal chow or a half methionine and choline deficient diet, supplemented with ethionine (HMCDE), to induce NASH, showed significantly enhanced  injury, as evidenced by higher hepatic necrosis scores and elevated serum aminotransferases (ALT). Mechanistically, we showed that murine hepatocytes express α and β adrenoceptors; that PRL directly induces hepatocyte injury and death as evidenced by increased release of lactate dehydrogenase, FASL and TNF-α from hepatocytes in the presence of PRL; and that PRL activated the apoptotic pathway in primary hepatocyte cultures, as indicated by upregulation of Fas receptor and caspase-8 proteins. The β-AR antagonist PRL therefore appears to enhance  injury through induction of hepatocyte death via the death pathway. Further studies are now required to extrapolate these findings to humans but meanwhile, β-AR antagonists should be avoided or used with caution in patients with non-cirrhotic NASH as they may worsen  injury.Copyright © 2013.

It has been shown in both human and animal studies that choline deficiencies contribute to diseases such as nonalcoholic  disease and various neurodegenerative diseases. An adequate supply of dietary choline is important for optimum development, highlighted by the increased maternal requirements during fetal development and in breast-fed infants. We discuss recent studies investigating variants in PEMT and MTHFR1 that are associated with a variety of birth defects. In addition to genetic interactions, we discuss several recent studies that uncover changes in fetal global methylation patterns in response to maternal dietary choline intake that result in changes in gene expression in the offspring. In contrast to the developmental role of adequate choline, there is now an appreciation of the role choline has in cardiovascular disease through the gut microbiota-mediated metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide. This pathway highlights some of our understanding of how the microbiome affects nutrient processing and bioavailability. Finally, to better characterize the genetic architecture regulating choline requirements, we discuss recent results focused on identifying polymorphisms that regulate choline and its derivative products.Here we discuss recent studies that have advanced our understanding of how specific alleles in key choline metabolism genes are related to dietary choline requirements and human disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27368153>Systemic metabolic derangement, pulmonary effects, and insulin insufficiency following subchronic ozone exposure in rats.</a></h2><p>Acute ozone exposure induces a classical stress response with elevated circulating stress hormones along with changes in glucose, protein and lipid metabolism in rats, with similar alterations in ozone-exposed humans. These stress-mediated changes over time have been linked to insulin resistance. We hypothesized that acute ozone-induced stress response and metabolic impairment would persist during subchronic episodic exposure and induce peripheral insulin resistance. Male Wistar Kyoto rats were exposed to air or 0.25ppm or 1.00ppm ozone, 5h/day, 3 consecutive days/week (wk) for 13wks. Pulmonary, metabolic, insulin signaling and stress endpoints were determined immediately after 13wk or following a 1wk recovery period (13wk+1wk recovery). We show that episodic ozone exposure is associated with persistent pulmonary injury and inflammation, fasting hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, as well as, elevated circulating adrenaline and cholesterol when measured at 13wk, however, these responses were largely reversible following a 1wk recovery. Moreover, the increases noted acutely after ozone exposure in non-esterified  acids and branched chain amino acid levels were not apparent following a subchronic exposure. Neither peripheral or tissue specific insulin resistance nor increased hepatic gluconeogenesis were present after subchronic ozone exposure. Instead, long-term ozone exposure lowered circulating insulin and severely impaired glucose-stimulated beta-cell insulin secretion. Thus, our findings in young-adult rats provide potential insights into epidemiological studies that show a positive association between ozone exposures and type 1 diabetes. Ozone-induced beta-cell dysfunction may secondarily contribute to other tissue-specific metabolic alterations following chronic exposure due to impaired regulation of glucose, lipid, and protein metabolism.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25881982>Myricetin derived from Hovenia dulcis Thunb. ameliorates vascular endothelial dysfunction and  injury in high choline-fed mice.</a></h2><p>The present study was conducted to explore the protective effects of myricetin (MYR) purified from Hovenia dulcis Thunb. against vascular endothelial dysfunction and  injury in mice fed with 3% dietary choline water. MYR was shown to possess strong scavenging activities against DPPH˙, HO˙, and O2˙(-) and ferric-reducing antioxidant power in vitro. Mice fed 3% dietary choline water for 8 weeks significantly displayed vascular endothelial dysfunction and  oxidative stress (p < 0.01). Furthermore, continuous administration of MYR at 400 and 800 mg per kg bw in choline-fed mice could significantly decrease the high choline diet-induced elevation of serum total cholesterol (TC), total triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), endothelin 1 (ET-1) and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) levels as well as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities, while the choline-induced decline of serum high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), endothelin nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) levels could be markedly elevated in mice (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). Meanwhile, MYR at 400 and 800 mg per kg bw also increased hepatic total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities and decreased hepatic malonaldehyde (MDA) and non-esterified  acid (NEFA) levels in mice, relative to choline-treated mice (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). These results together with conventional haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Oil Red O staining observation of the  and vascular tissues suggested that MYR exerted a significant protective role against high choline diet-induced endothelial dysfunction and  injury in mice.

There are no studies reported on the protective effects of sinapic acid on changes in electrocardiogram, lipids and lipoproteins in myocardial infarction. This study aims to evaluate the protective effects of sinapic acid on cardiac hypertrophy, dyslipidaemia and alterations in lipoproteins and electrocardiogram in isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarcted rats. Rats were pre- and co-treated with sinapic acid (12 mg/kg body weight) daily for a period of 10 days and were induced myocardial infarction with isoproterenol (100mg/kg body weight) on 9th and 10th day. Isoproterenol induced rats showed an increased level of serum cardiac troponin-T and elevated ST-segments. Increased levels of serum and heart cholesterol, triglycerides and free  acids were observed in isoproterenol induced rats. Isoproterenol also increased serum low density and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol and decreased high density lipoprotein cholesterol. The activity of  3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl-coenzyme-A-reductase was elevated in isoproterenol induced rats. The in vitro study revealed the potent antioxidant activity of sinapic acid. Pre- and co-treatment with sinapic acid ameliorated cardiac hypertrophy, dyslipidemia and elevated ST-segments in isoproterenol induced myocardial infarcted rats. Thus, sinapic acid prevented the alterations in the levels of lipids and lipoproteins by virtue of its antilipidaemic effect in isoproterenol induced myocardial infarcted rats.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

To develop a non-invasive means of assessing the disease, 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) has been explored, but the severe spectral overlaps and low signal-to-noise-ratio in 31P-MRS spectra at clinical field strength are clearly limiting factors.To investigate potential advantages of high resolution in vivo 31P-MRS in assessing NAFLD.The study was conducted at 9.4T in control and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-treated rats. Rats were divided according to histopathologic findings into a control group (n = 15), a non-alcoholic steatohepatitis group (n = 17), and a cirrhosis group (n = 12). Data were presented with different reference peaks that are commonly used for peak normalization such as total phosphorous signal, phosphomonoester + phosphodiester (PME + PDE), and nucleotide triphosphate (NTP). Then, multivariate analyses were performed.In all spectra PME and PDE were well resolved into phosphoethanolamine (PE) and phosphocholine (PC), and into glycerophosphorylethanolamine (GPE) and glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC), respectively. Those MRS measures quantifiable only in highly resolved spectra had higher correlations with histology than those conventional MRS measures such as PME, PDE, and NTP. The optimized partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model correctly classified 79% (22/28) of the rats in the training set and correctly predicted 69% (11/16) of the rats in the test set.PE, PC, GPE, GPC, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) that can be separately quantifiable in highly resolved spectra may further improve the potential efficacy of 31P-MRS in the diagnosis of NAFLD.© The Foundation Acta Radiologica 2014.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25716573>Excess intake of fat and sugar potentiates epinephrine-induced hyperglycemia in male rats.</a></h2><p>Over the past five decades, per capita caloric intake has increased significantly, and diet- and stress-related diseases are more prevalent. The stress hormone epinephrine stimulates hepatic glucose release during a stress response. The present experiment tested the hypothesis that excess caloric intake alters this ability of epinephrine to increase blood glucose.Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a high-energy cafeteria-style diet (HED). Weight gain during the first 5 days on the diet was used to divide the rats into an HED-lean group and HED-obese group. After 9 weeks, the rats were injected with epinephrine, and blood glucose was measured.HED-obese rats gained body and fat mass, and developed insulin resistance (IR) and hepatic steatosis. HED-lean and control rats did not differ. Epinephrine produced larger increases in blood glucose in the HED-obese rats than in the HED-lean and control rats. Removing the high-energy components of the diet for 4 weeks reversed the potentiated effects of epinephrine on glucose and corrected the IR but not the steatosis or obesity.Consumption of a high-energy cafeteria diet potentiates epinephrine-induced hyperglycemia. This effect is associated with insulin resistance but not adiposity or steatosis and is reversed by 4 weeks of standard chow.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

NAFLD includes a spectrum of pathological hepatic changes, such as steatosis, steatohepatitis, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Bisdemethoxycurcumin (BDMC) is polyphenolic compounds with a diarylheptanoid skeleton, curcumin close analogues, which is derived from the Curcumae Longae Rhizoma. While the rich bioavailability research of curcumin, BDMC is the poor studies. We investigated whether BDMC has the hepatoprotective effect and combinatory preventive effect with silymarin on methionine choline deficient (MCD)-diet-induced NAFLD in C57BL/6J mice. C57BL/6J mice were divided into five groups of normal (normal diet without any treatment), MCD diet (MCD diet only), MCD + silymarin (SIL) 100 mg/kg group, MCD + BDMC 100 mg/kg group, MCD + SIL 50 mg/kg + BDMC 50 mg/kg group. Body weight,  weight,  function tests, histological changes were assessed and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses were conducted after 4 weeks. Mice lost body weight on the MCD-diet, but BDMC did not lose less than the MCD-diet group.  weights decreased from BDMC, but they increased significantly in the MCD-diet groups. All  function test values decreased from the MCD-diet, whereas those from the BDMC increased significantly. The MCD- diet induced severe hepatic  accumulation, but the  change was reduced in the BDMC. The BDMC showed an inhibitory effect on  lipogenesis by reducing associated gene expression caused by the MCD-diet. In all experiments, the combinations of BDMC with SIL had a synergistic effect against MCD-diet models. In conclusion, our findings indicate that BDMC has a potential suppressive effect on NAFLD. Therefore, our data suggest that BDMC may act as a novel and potent therapeutic agent against NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24795036>Caspase 3 inactivation protects against hepatic cell death and ameliorates fibrogenesis in a diet-induced NASH model.</a></h2><p>Hepatocyte cell death is a key feature of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). As the contribution of specific caspases remains unclear, our aim was to ascertain the effect of caspase 3 suppression on  injury and fibrogenesis.C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) and caspase 3 knock out (Casp3 (-/-)) mice were placed on a methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet for 6 weeks to induce steatohepatitis and  fibrosis. Thereafter,  injury,  fibrosis and hepatocellular apoptosis were quantified in  sections. Additionally, expression of proteins associated with  inflammation and fibrogenesis was analyzed.WT mice fed MCD diet showed marked activation of caspase 3 in hepatocytes, in conjunction with steatohepatitis and increased hepatic triglyceride levels, hepatocyte ballooning, inflammation and fibrosis. Casp3 (-/-) mice fed the MCD diet showed similar serum aminotransferase levels and NAFLD activity scores (NAS) compared with WT MCD-fed mice. However, Casp3 (-/-) mice on the MCD diet showed a marked reduction in expression of transcripts for profibrogenic genes, which translated into reduced hepatic collagen deposition. These changes were associated with decreased levels of apoptosis, and a significant reduction in the expression of cytokines involved in inflammatory signaling. Casp3 (-/-) mice on the MCD showed a reduction in expression of chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) leading to ameliorated infiltration of inflammatory lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus C1 (Ly6c) positive monocytes.These findings support a prominent role for hepatocyte caspase 3 activation in NASH-related apoptosis, fibrogenesis and fibrosis which in part is mediated via CCR2-dependent infiltration of Ly6c positive monocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26921863>Insulin receptor sensitizer, dicholine succinate, prevents both Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) upregulation and affective changes induced by a high-cholesterol diet in mice.</a></h2><p>High cholesterol intake in mice induces hepatic lipid dystrophy and inflammation, signs of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD), depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors, and the up-regulation of brain and  Toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4). Here, we investigated whether dicholine succinate (DS), an insulin receptor sensitizer and mitochondrial complex II substrate would interact with these effects.C57BL/6J mice were given a 0.2%-cholesterol diet for 3 weeks, alone or along with oral DS administration, or a control feed. Outcomes included behavioral measures of anxiety/depression, and Tlr4 and peroxisome-proliferator-activated-receptor-gamma coactivator-1b (PPARGC1b) expression.50mg/kg DS treatment for 3 weeks partially ameliorated the cholesterol-induced anxiety- and depressive-like changes. Mice were next treated at the higher dose (180mg/kg), either for the 3-week period of dietary intervention, or for the last two weeks. Three-week DS administration normalized behaviors in the forced swim and O-maze tests and abolished the Tlr4 up-regulation in the brain and . The delayed, 2-week DS treatment had similar effects on Tlr4 expression and largely rescued the above-mentioned behaviors. Suppression of PPARGC1b, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, by the high cholesterol diet, was prevented with the 3-week administration, and markedly diminished by the a 2-week administration of DS. None of treatments prevented hepatic dystrophy and triglyceride accumulation.Other conditions have to be tested to define possible limitations of reported effects of DS.DS treatment did not alter the patho-morphological substrates of NAFLD syndrome in mice, but ameliorated its molecular and behavioral consequences, likely by activating mitochondrial functions and anti-inflammatory mechanisms.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

E2Fs are master regulators of cellular proliferation. We have recently shown that E2F2 activity facilitates the completion of  regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PH) by regulating the expression of genes required for S-phase entry. Our study also revealed that E2F2 determines the duration of hepatectomy-induced hepatic steatosis. A transcriptomic analysis of normal adult  identified "lipid metabolism regulation" as a major E2F2 functional target, suggesting that E2F2 has a role in lipid homeostasis. Here we use wild-type (E2F2+/+) and E2F2 deficient (E2F2-/-) mice to investigate the in vivo role of E2F2 in the composition of  lipids and  acids in two metabolically different contexts: quiescence and 48-h post-PH, when cellular proliferation and anabolic demands are maximal. We show that  regeneration is accompanied by large triglyceride and protein increases without changes in total phospholipids both in E2F2+/+ and E2F2-/- mice. Remarkably, we found that the phenotype of quiescent  tissue from E2F2-/- mice resembles the phenotype of proliferating E2F2+/+  tissue, characterized by a decreased phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidylethanolamine ratio and a reprogramming of genes involved in generation of choline and  derivatives. The diversity of  acids in total lipid, triglycerides and phospholipids was essentially preserved on E2F2 loss both in proliferating and non-proliferating  tissue, although notable exceptions in inflammation-related  acids of defined phospholipid classes were detected. Overall, our results indicate that E2F2 activity sustains the hepatic homeostasis of major membrane glycerolipid components while it is dispensable for storage glycerolipid balance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31132306>Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids alleviate methionine-choline-deficient diet-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in mice.</a></h2><p>The epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are products of cytochrome P450 epoxygenases and have recently been found to have an anti-inflammatory activity. However, the role of EETs in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis has not been fully understood. In this study, we investigated the protective role of EETs in methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in mice and the potential mechanisms. We used 1-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1-propionylpiperidin-4-yl)urea(TPPU), a soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor, to increase the endogenous EET level in mice. Upon TPPU treatment, the  steatosis and inflammatory damage were significantly ameliorated in mice with steatohepatitis, paralleled by the downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) as well as chemokines (CXCL1, MCP-1). Compared with untreated NASH mice, mRNA levels of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) and inflammation relevant adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1) were downregulated, whereas mRNA level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α(PPAR-α) was elevated in TPPU-treated mice. In vitro, 11,12-EET treatment remarkably attenuated free  acid (FFA)-induced inflammation in HepG2 and THP-1 cells. Further, 11,12-EET inhibited the activation of NF-κB signalling pathway in macrophages from mice with steatohepatitis. Collectively, these results suggest that EETs play a protective role and alleviate the MCD diet-induced steatohepatitis in mice mainly by downregulating activation of NF-κB pathway in macrophages.© 2019 The Foundation for the Scandinavian Journal of Immunology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646522>Intestinal Microbiota Protects against MCD Diet-Induced Steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is the most common  disease in western countries, with a continuously rising incidence. Gut- communication and microbiota composition have been identified as critical drivers of the NAFLD progression. Hence, it has been shown that microbiota depletion can ameliorate high-fat diet or western-diet induced experimental Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, its functional implications in the methionine-choline dietary model, remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigated the physiological relevance of gut microbiota in methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet induced NASH. Experimental  disease was induced by 8 weeks of MCD feeding in wild-type (WT) mice, either with or without commensal microbiota depletion, by continuous broad-spectrum antibiotic (AB) treatment. MCD diet induced steatohepatitis was accompanied by a reduced gut microbiota diversity, indicating intestinal dysbiosis. MCD treatment prompted macroscopic shortening of the intestine, as well as intestinal villi in histology. However, gut microbiota composition of MCD-treated mice, neither resembled human NASH, nor did it augment the intestinal barrier integrity or intestinal inflammation. In the MCD model, AB treatment resulted in increased steatohepatitis activity, compared to microbiota proficient control mice. This phenotype was driven by pronounced neutrophil infiltration, while AB treatment only slightly increased monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMF) abundance. Our data demonstrated the differential role of gut microbiota, during steatohepatitis development. In the context of MCD induced steatohepatitis, commensal microbiota was found to be hepatoprotective.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22872676>Interstrain differences in the severity of  injury induced by a choline- and folate-deficient diet in mice are associated with dysregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is a major health problem and a leading cause of chronic  disease in the United States and developed countries. In humans, genetic factors greatly influence individual susceptibility to NAFLD. The goals of this study were to compare the magnitude of interindividual differences in the severity of  injury induced by methyl-donor deficiency among individual inbred strains of mice and to investigate the underlying mechanisms associated with the variability. Feeding mice a choline- and folate-deficient diet for 12 wk caused  injury similar to NAFLD. The magnitude of  injury varied among the strains, with the order of sensitivity being A/J ≈ C57BL/6J ≈ C3H/HeJ < 129S1/SvImJ ≈ CAST/EiJ < PWK/PhJ < WSB/EiJ. The interstrain variability in severity of NAFLD  damage was associated with dysregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism, primarily with a down-regulation of the peroxisome proliferator receptor α (PPARα)-regulated lipid catabolic pathway genes. Markers of oxidative stress and oxidative stress-induced DNA damage were also elevated in the livers but were not correlated with severity of  damage. These findings suggest that the PPARα-regulated metabolism network is one of the key mechanisms determining interstrain susceptibility and severity of NAFLD in mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23539666>3.0 T proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the : quantification of choline.</a></h2><p>To investigate the normal hepatic magnetic resonance spectroscopy findings choline/lipid2 (Cho/Lip2) associated with age and body mass index (BMI).A total of 58 single-voxel proton spectra of the  were acquired at 3.0 T using the eight-channel phased array abdominal coil as the receiver coil. Consecutive stacks of breath-hold spectra were acquired using the point resolved spectroscopy technique at a short echo time of 30 ms and a repetition time of 1500 ms.

We examined the association of circulating TMAO, choline and betaine with the presence and severity of NAFLD in Chinese adults. We performed a hospital-based case-control study (CCS) and a cross-sectional study (CSS). In the CCS, we recruited 60 biopsy-proven NAFLD cases and 35 controls (18-60 years) and determined serum concentrations of TMAO, choline and betaine by HPLC-MS/MS. For the CSS, 1,628 community-based adults (40-75 years) completed the blood tests and ultrasonographic NAFLD evaluation. In the CCS, analyses of covariance showed adverse associations of ln-transformed serum levels of TMAO, choline and betaine/choline ratio with the scores of steatosis and total NAFLD activity (NAS) (all P-trend <0.05). The CSS revealed that a greater severity of NAFLD was independently correlated with higher TMAO but lower betaine and betaine/choline ratio (all P-trend <0.05). No significant choline-NAFLD association was observed. Our findings showed adverse associations between the circulating TMAO level and the presence and severity of NAFLD in hospital- and community-based Chinese adults, and a favorable betaine-NAFLD relationship in the community-based participants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28285648>Branched-chain amino acids alleviate hepatic steatosis and  injury in choline-deficient high-fat diet induced NASH mice.</a></h2><p>For successful treatment for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), it may be important to treat the individual causative factors. At present, however, there is no established treatment for this disease. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) have been used to treat patients with decompensated cirrhosis.In order to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the effects of BCAAs on hepatic steatosis and disease progression, we investigated the effects of BCAA supplementation in mice fed a choline-deficient high-fat diet (CDHF), which induces NASH.Male mice were divided into four groups that received (1) choline-sufficient high fat (HF) diet (HF-control), (2) HF plus 2% BCAA in drinking water (HF-BCAA), (3) CDHF diet (CDHF-control), or (4) CDHF-BCAA for 8weeks. We monitored  injury, hepatic steatosis and cholesterol, gene expression related to lipid metabolism, and hepatic fat accumulation.Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and hepatic triglyceride (TG) were significantly elevated in CDHF-control relative to HF-control.  histopathology revealed severe steatosis, inflammation, and pericellular fibrosis in CDHF-control, confirming the NASH findings. Serum ALT levels and hepatic TG and lipid droplet areas were significantly lower in CDHF-BCAA than in CDHF-control. Gene expression and protein level of  acid synthase (FAS), which catalyzes the final step in  acid biosynthesis, was significantly decreased in CDHF-BCAA than in CDHF-control (P<0.05). Moreover, hepatic total and free cholesterol of CDHF-BCAA was significantly lower than those of CDHF-control.BCAA can alleviate hepatic steatosis and  injury associated with NASH by suppressing FAS gene expression and protein levels.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

To define the ability of methyl donor supplementation (MDS) to reduce hepatic lipid content and modify the plasma lipidome, 30 multiparous Holstein cows (2.04 ± 0.69 lactations; 689 ± 58 kg of body weight; 3.48 ± 0.10 units of body condition score) were fed a ration with or without rumen-protected methyl donors (22 g/d of Met, 10 g/d of choline chloride, 3 g/d of betaine, 96 mg/d of riboflavin, and 1.4 mg/d of vitamin B) from d -28 before expected calving through d 14 postpartum. Cows were randomly enrolled based on predefined selection criteria (body condition score and parity). Base diets without MDS were formulated for gestation (15.4% crude protein with a predicted Lys-to-Met ratio of 3.25; 1.44 Mcal of net energy for lactation/kg of dry matter) and lactation (16.6% crude protein with a predicted Lys-to-Met ratio of 3.36; 1.64 Mcal of net energy for lactation/kg of dry matter). Blood sampling occurred from d -28 relative to expected calving through d 14 postpartum.  tissue was biopsied at d -28 relative to expected calving and on d 5 and 14 postpartum. In addition to routine analyses, serum AA concentrations on d 10 and 12 were quantified using mass spectrometry. Plasma triacylglycerol (TAG) and cholesteryl esters (CE) were qualitatively measured using time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Data were analyzed using a mixed model with repeated measures. Dry matter intake and milk yield were not modified by MDS. The transition from d -28 relative to expected parturition to d 14 postpartum was characterized by increased plasma  acid (0.15 to 0.71 mmol/L) and β-hydroxybutyrate (0.34 to 0.43 mmol/L) levels and  lipid content (3.91 to 9.16%). Methyl donor supplementation increased the serum Met level by 26% and decreased the serum Lys-to-Met ratio by 21% on d 10 and 12, respectively. Moreover, the increase in hepatic lipid content from d 5 through 14 postpartum was suppressed with MDS relative to control (3.57 vs. -0.29%). Dietary MDS modified the TAG and CE lipidome. For example, MDS increased plasma TAG 46:3 (carbon number:double bond) by 116% relative to control cows on d 5 postpartum. Moreover, MDS tended to increase plasma CE 34:6. In contrast, MDS lowered plasma TAG 54:8 by 39% relative to control cows on d 5 postpartum. We concluded that in the absence of gains in dry matter intake and milk and milk protein yields, dietary MDS slows the progression of hepatic lipid accumulation and modifies the plasma TAG lipidome in transition cows.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) has been investigated extensively in the context of cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the role of mTORC1 in NASH remains largely unknown.mTORC1 activity in macrophages in human mild and severe NASH  was compared. Mice with macrophage-specific deletion of the regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (Raptor) subunit and littermate controls were fed a high-fructose, palmitate, and cholesterol diet for 24 weeks or a methionine- and choline-deficient diet for 4 weeks to develop NASH.We report that in human beings bearing NASH, macrophage mTORC1 activity was lower in livers experiencing severe vs mild NASH . Moreover, macrophage mTORC1 disruption exacerbated the inflammatory response in 2 diet-induced NASH mouse models. Mechanistically, in response to apoptotic hepatocytes (AHs), macrophage polarization toward a M2 anti-inflammatory phenotype was inhibited in Raptor-deficient macrophages. During the digestion of AHs, macrophage mTORC1 was activated and coupled with dynamin-related protein 1 to facilitate the latter's phosphorylation, leading to mitochondrial fission-mediated calcium release. Ionomycin or A23187, calcium ionophores, prevented Raptor deficiency-mediated failure of lysosome acidification and subsequent lipolysis. Blocking dynamin-related protein 1-dependent mitochondria fission impaired lysosome function, resulting in reduced production of anti-inflammatory factors such as interleukins 10 and 13.Persistent mTORC1 deficiency in macrophages contributes to the progression of NASH by causing lysosome dysfunction and subsequently attenuating anti-inflammatory M2-like response in macrophages during clearance of AHs.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Rats were pretreated with p-coumaric acid (8 mg/kg body weight) daily for a period of 7 days and then injected with isoproterenol (100mg/kg body weight) on 8th and 9th day to induce myocardial infarction. Myocardial infarction induced by isoproterenol was indicated by increased level of cardiac sensitive marker and elevated ST-segments in the electrocardiogram. Also, the levels/concentrations of serum and heart cholesterol, triglycerides and free  acids were increased in myocardial infarcted rats. Isoproterenol also increased the levels of serum low density and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol and decreased the levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol. It also enhanced the activity of  3-hydroxy-3 methyl glutaryl-Coenzyme-A reductase. p-Coumaric acid pretreatment revealed preventive effects on all the biochemical parameters and electrocardiogram studied in myocardial infarcted rats.

The silencing of TNFα in myeloid cells reduces NASH progression.Increase of TNFα-producing Kupffer cells is crucial for triggering NASH via monocyte recruitment.Myeloid cells-targeted silencing of TNFα might be a tenable therapeutic approach. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), characterized by lipid deposits within hepatocytes (steatosis), is associated with hepatic injury and inflammation and leads to the development of fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocarcinoma. However, the pathogenic mechanism of NASH is not well understood. To determine the role of distinct innate myeloid subsets in the development of NASH, we examined the contribution of  resident macrophages (i.e. Kupffer cells) and blood-derived monocytes in triggering  inflammation and hepatic damage. Employing a murine model of NASH, we discovered a previously unappreciated role for TNFα and Kupffer cells in the initiation and progression of NASH. Sequential depletion of Kupffer cells reduced the incidence of  injury, steatosis, and proinflammatory monocyte infiltration. Furthermore, our data show a differential contribution of Kupffer cells and blood monocytes during the development of NASH; Kupffer cells increased their production of TNFα, followed by infiltration of CD11b(int)Ly6C(hi) monocytes, 2 and 10 days, respectively, after starting the methionine/choline-deficient (MCD) diet. Importantly, targeted knockdown of TNFα expression in myeloid cells decreased the incidence of NASH development by decreasing steatosis,  damage, monocyte infiltration, and the production of inflammatory chemokines.

Our objective was to develop a mouse model of childhood undernutrition in order to test the hypothesis that feeding a maize vegetable diet (MVD), like that consumed by children at risk for kwashiorkor, will cause hepatic steatosis which is prevented by supplementation with choline. A MVD was developed with locally sourced organic ingredients, and fed to weanling mice ( = 9) for 6 or 13 days. An additional group of mice ( = 4) were fed a choline supplemented MVD. Weight, body composition, and  changes were compared to control mice ( = 10) at the beginning and end of the study. The MVD resulted in reduced weight gain and hepatic steatosis. Choline supplementation prevented hepatic steatosis and was associated with increased hepatic concentrations of the methyl donor betaine. Our findings show that (1) feeding a MVD to weanling mice rapidly induces hepatic steatosis, which is a hallmark disturbance of kwashiorkor; and that (2) hepatic steatosis associated with feeding a MVD is prevented by choline supplementation. These findings support the concept that insufficient choline intake may contribute to the pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis in kwashiorkor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135054>Impaired plasmalogen synthesis dysregulates  X receptor-dependent transcription in cerebellum.</a></h2><p>Synthesis of  plasmalogen (PlsEtn) is regulated by modulating the stability of  acyl-CoA reductase 1 (Far1) on peroxisomal membrane, a rate-limiting enzyme in plasmalogen synthesis. Dysregulation of plasmalogen homeostasis impairs cholesterol biosynthesis in cultured cells by altering the stability of squalene epoxidase. However, regulation of PlsEtn synthesis and physiological consequences of plasmalogen homeostasis in tissues remain unknown. In the present study, we found that the protein but not the transcription level of Far1 in the cerebellum of the Pex14 mutant mouse expressing Pex14p lacking its C-terminal region (Pex14ΔC/ΔC) is higher than that from wild-type mouse, suggesting that Far1 is stabilized by the lowered level of PlsEtn. The protein level of squalene epoxidase was increased, whereas the transcriptional activity of the  X receptors (LXRs), ligand-activated transcription factors of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is lowered in the cerebellum of Pex14ΔC/ΔC and the mice deficient in dihydroxyacetonephosphate acyltransferase, the initial enzyme for the synthesis of PlsEtn. These results suggest that the reduction of plasmalogens in the cerebellum more likely compromises the cholesterol homeostasis, thereby reducing the transcriptional activities of LXRs, master regulators of cholesterol homeostasis.© The Author(s) 2019.

CTC clusters, which contain fibroblasts, indicate poor prognosis. In the present study, we used our malignant lymphoma metastatic mouse model to compare the effect of a choline-deficient-diet (CDD) and the control diet (CD) on fibroblasts in CTCs.We compared the number and morphology of CTCs in CDD and CD mice using color-coded imaging with fluorescent proteins. Malignant lymphoma EL4 cells expressing RFP were injected in the spleen of transgenic C57B/6-GFP mice, which were fed a CDD or CD. Two weeks later, we harvested and observed the number of CTCs and fibroblast-like cells both in heart blood and portal blood. Imaging of CTC morphology was performed with smeared glass slides and in culture.There was no significant difference in the number of CTCs between CDD and CD mice. The number of fibroblast-like cells in the CTC microenvironment in CD mouse portal blood was significantly larger than in CDD mouse portal blood. These differences may be caused by deficiency in choline that leads to less metastasis in choline-deficient-diet-induced .Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

We studied the impact of reduced TH in brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation. In adult heterozygous ( ) mice, dopamine and noradrenaline (NA) content in BAT decreased after cold exposure. This reduced catecholaminergic response did not impair cold adaptation, because these mice induced uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1) and maintained BAT temperature to a similar extent than controls ( ). Possible compensatory mechanisms implicated were studied.  and  expression, key genes in BAT activation, were elevated in  mice at thermoneutrality from day 18.5 of embryonic life. Likewise, plasma FGF21 and   mRNA were increased. Analysis of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a process that triggers elevations in FGF21, showed higher phospho-IRE1, phospho-JNK, and CHOP in BAT of  mice at thermoneutrality. Also, increased lipolysis in BAT of cold-exposure  mice was demonstrated by increased phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), as well as diacylglycerol (DAG) and FFA content. Overall, these results indicate that the mild effects of  haploinsufficiency on BAT function are likely due to compensatory mechanisms involving elevations in  and  and through adaptive changes in the lipid profile.Copyright © 2018 Vázquez et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25940288>[Emodin worsens methionine-choline-deficient diet-induced non-alcoholic  disease in mice].</a></h2><p>To investigate the influence of emodin on methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet-induced non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) in mice.C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into three groups: methionine-choline-supplemented (MCS) diet group, MCD diet plus DMSO injection group (MCD), MCD diet plus emodin injection group (MCD-emodin). The mice were fed with MCS or MCD diet for 10 days, and then peritoneally injected with DMSO or emodin for 20 days consecutively. HE staining was performed to observe pathologic changes of livers. The levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), glucose (GLU) were measured by automatic biochemical analyzer. The mRNA levels of interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were determined by real-time quantitative PCR.HE staining showed that there were more lipid accumulation and leukocyte infiltration in the livers of the MCD group compared with the MCS group. The above manifestations were more severe in the MCD-emodin group. Moreover, compared with the MCD group, emodin injection remarkably raised serum AST and ALT levels and greatly increased IL-1β and IL-6 mRNA levels.Emodin worsened MCD diet-induced NAFLD in mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29032410>Relationship Between Circulating  Acids and  Acid Ethanolamide Levels After a Single 2-h Dietary Fat Feeding in Male Sprague-Dawley Rats : Elevated levels of oleoylethanolamide, palmitoylethanolamide, linoleoylethanolamide, arachidonoylethanolamide and docosahexanoylethanolamide after a single 2 h dietary fat feeding in male Sprague Dawley rats.</a></h2><p>Previous studies show that long term variations in dietary fat consumption impact circulating  acid ethanolamide (FAE) concentrations, however, few studies have investigated short term effects of dietary fat feeding on FAE levels. The trial's objective was to explore the effect of acute feeding of varying amounts of dietary n-9 and n-3  acids on plasma and organ levels of FAE. Sixty-four rats were assigned to four groups fed meals containing 40% of energy as either safflower oil (control), canola oil (CO), or DHA rich oil (DRO), each consumed as a bolus within a 2-h window. Plasma and tissue FAE levels were measured at 3, 6, 12 and 24 h following the bolus. FAE profiles over time exhibited patterns that were specific both to FAE and to dietary fat type provided. At 3 h, plasma and  OEA levels were higher (p < 0.05) in the 95% CO:5% DRO compared with other groups. At 12 h, plasma PEA levels were lower (p < 0.05) in the 50% CO:50% DRO group compared to the 95% CO group. Plasma DEA levels showed an increase (p < 0.05) only after 24 h of feeding. All four dietary groups manifested increased DEA levels in a dose-dependent manner. Data demonstrate that a single meal feeding of diets with different ratios of fat types impacts tissue levels of FAE within a short time frame, which could further influence the physiological roles of FAE on appetite regulation and energy expenditure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28063004>Tubulin alpha 8 is expressed in hepatic stellate cells and is induced in transformed hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Tubulin alpha 8 (TUBA8) is highly abundant in murine  tumors suggesting a role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a risk factor for HCC. In mice that are fed with a methionine-choline deficient diet for two weeks to induce advanced murine NASH, we do see increased hepatic levels of TUBA8 protein. In animals given a high-fat diet for 14 weeks or an atherogenic diet for 12 weeks, hepatic TUBA8 is unchanged. TUBA8 is highly expressed in human hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and co-localizes with the HSC marker desmin in the murine . Inflammatory (TNF, LPS, IL-6) and profibrotic mediators (TGF-beta) do not regulate TUBA8 in HepG2 cells, primary HSC and the HSC cell line LX-2, when stimulated for 24 h. Agonists of the farnesoid X receptor and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma, which are nuclear receptors involved in NASH and HCC pathophysiology, have no effect on TUBA8 in HepG2 and LX-2 cells. In human HCC tissues of 18 patients TUBA8 is significantly upregulated when compared to the corresponding non-tumorous tissues. Compared to non-transformed hepatocytes, TUBA8 protein is strongly expressed in transformed cells. Thus, TUBA8 is a marker of HSC whose cell number is increased in NASH, while higher levels in HCC may be related to induction of TUBA8 in parenchymal cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25320186>Higher dietary choline intake is associated with lower risk of nonalcoholic  in normal-weight Chinese women.</a></h2><p>Choline deficiency has been shown to induce  fat accumulation in both rodent and human studies.

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which represents advanced stage NAFLD, is increasingly being recognized as a major cause of -related morbidity and mortality. However, no effective drugs against NASH have yet been developed. Therefore, we searched for candidate therapeutic agents based on the changes in levels of hepatic metabolites via gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS)-based metabolome analysis of livers from methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet-fed mice, a mouse model of NASH.The metabolites were extracted from the livers of the MCD diet-fed mice and then analyzed using GC/MS. Subsequently, the MCD diet-fed mice were supplemented with hypotaurine, and the therapeutic effects of hypotaurine against steatohepatitis were evaluated.Ninety-nine metabolites were detected in the livers of the MCD diet-induced steatohepatitis model mice. Among these metabolites, hypotaurine exhibited the greatest decrease in its concentration in the mice. Supplementation with 2 mmol/kgBW hypotaurine attenuated  injuries and fat accumulation caused by the MCD diet-induced steatohepatitis. Furthermore, 10 mmol/kgBW hypotaurine supplementation ameliorated fibrosis and oxidative stress induced by the MCD diet.The present metabolome analysis-based study demonstrated that hypotaurine is a novel candidate therapeutic agent for NASH.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Male Wistar rats underwent NASH induced by 8-week feeding with an MCD diet. Serum and hepatic biopsies at 2, 4 and 8 weeks were taken, and serum enzymes, ADMA and nitrate/nitrite (NOx), were evaluated. Hepatic biopsies were used for mRNA and protein expression analysis of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-1 (DDAH-1) and protein methyltransferases (PRMT-1), enzymes involved in ADMA metabolism and synthesis, respectively, and ADMA transporters (CAT-1, CAT-2A and CAT-2B). Lipid peroxides (TBARS), glutathione, ATP/ADP and DDAH activity were quantified. An increase in serum AST and ALT was detected in MCD animals. A time-dependent decrease in serum and tissue ADMA and increase in mRNA expression of DDAH-1 and PRMT-1 as well as higher rates of mRNA expression of CAT-1 and lower rates of CAT-2A and CAT-2B were found after 8-week MCD diet. An increase in serum NOx and no changes in protein expression in DDAH-1 and CAT-1 and higher content in CAT-2 and PRMT-1 were found at 8 weeks. Hepatic DDAH activity decreased with a concomitant increase in oxidative stress, as demonstrated by high TBARS levels and low glutathione content. In conclusion, a decrease in serum and tissue ADMA levels in the MCD rats was found associated with a reduction in DDAH activity due to the marked oxidative stress observed. Changes in ADMA levels and its transporters are innovative factors in the onset and progression of hepatic alterations correlated with MCD diet-induced NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23292069>Genetic signatures in choline and 1-carbon metabolism are associated with the severity of hepatic steatosis.</a></h2><p>Choline metabolism is important for very low-density lipoprotein secretion, making this nutritional pathway an important contributor to hepatic lipid balance. The purpose of this study was to assess whether the cumulative effects of multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across genes of choline/1-carbon metabolism and functionally related pathways increase susceptibility to developing hepatic steatosis. In biopsy-characterized cases of nonalcoholic  disease and controls, we assessed 260 SNPs across 21 genes in choline/1-carbon metabolism. When SNPs were examined individually, using logistic regression, we only identified a single SNP (PNPLA3 rs738409) that was significantly associated with severity of hepatic steatosis after adjusting for confounders and multiple comparisons (P=0.02). However, when groupings of SNPs in similar metabolic pathways were defined using unsupervised hierarchical clustering, we identified groups of subjects with shared SNP signatures that were significantly correlated with steatosis burden (P=0.0002). The lowest and highest steatosis clusters could also be differentiated by ethnicity. However, unique SNP patterns defined steatosis burden irrespective of ethnicity. Our results suggest that analysis of SNP patterns in genes of choline/1-carbon metabolism may be useful for prediction of severity of steatosis in specific subsets of people, and the metabolic inefficiencies caused by these SNPs should be examined further.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27138530>The role of rumen-protected choline in hepatic function and performance of transition dairy cows.</a></h2><p>High-producing dairy cows enter a period of negative energy balance during the first weeks of lactation. Energy intake is usually sufficient to cover the increase in energy requirements for fetal growth during the period before calving, but meeting the demand for energy is often difficult during the early stages of lactation. A catabolic state predominates during the transition period, leading to the mobilisation of energy reserves (NEFA and amino acids) that are utilised mainly by the  and muscle. Increased uptake of mobilised NEFA by the , combined with the limited capacity of hepatocytes to either oxidise  acids for energy or to incorporate esterified  acids into VLDL results in  syndrome and ketosis. This metabolic disturbance can affect the general health, and it causes economic losses. Different nutritional strategies have been used to restrict negative effects associated with the energy challenge in transition cows. The provision of choline in the form of rumen-protected choline (RPC) can potentially improve  function by increasing VLDL exportation from the . RPC increases gene expression of microsomal TAG transfer protein and APOB100 that are required for VLDL synthesis and secretion. Studies with RPC have looked at gene expression, metabolic hormones, metabolite profiles, milk production and postpartum reproduction. A reduction in  fat and enhanced milk production has been observed with RPC supplementation. However, the effects of RPC on health and reproduction are equivocal, which could reflect the lack of sufficient dose-response studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23044079>The pro-inflammatory action of tumour necrosis factor-α in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is independent of the NSMAF gene product.</a></h2><p>The role of tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis remains unclear.We evaluated the role of TNF-α and NSMAF gene product factor associated with neutral sphingomyelinase activation, a protein adaptor of the TNF-α receptor-1, in a mouse model of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.Mice deficient either for TNF-α or factor associated with neutral sphingomyelinase activation, as well as control animals, were fed a methionine and choline-deficient diet for 5 weeks.  histology, serum glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and alanine aminotransferase levels were compared between groups.Weight loss, decrease of serum triglyceride and glucose levels and increase of alanine aminotransferase levels were attenuated in TNF(-/-) mice. Similarly, we found a significantly lower lobular inflammation in TNF(-/-) mice.  expression of transforming growth factor-β, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ(1, 2) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 was attenuated in TNF(-/-) mice. In addition, the phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylethanolamine  ratio decrease was less important in TNF(-/-) mice. The increase in hepatic sphingomyelin and ceramide levels was less pronounced in TNF(-/-) animals.Whereas TNF-α modulates the inflammatory process that underlies methionine and choline-deficient diet-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, its effects are not mediated by factor associated with neutral sphingomyelinase activation. Whether changes in  lipids, like phosphatidylcholine and ceramide, are causally involved in tumour necrosis factor-mediated  inflammation remains an open issue.Copyright © 2012 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.

Therefore, we studied milk production, feed intake, and body condition as well as metabolic and endocrine changes in high-yielding dairy cows to identify variable strategies in metabolic and endocrine adaptation to overcome postpartum metabolic load attributable to milk production. Cows used in this study varied in fat mobilization around calving, as classified by mean total  fat concentrations (LFC) postpartum. German Holstein cows (n=27) were studied from dry off until d 63 postpartum in their third lactation. All cows were fed the same total mixed rations ad libitum during the dry period and lactation. Plasma concentrations of metabolites and hormones were measured in blood samples taken at d 56, 28, 15, and 5 before expected calving and at d 1 and once weekly up to d 63 postpartum.  biopsies were taken on d 56 and 15 before calving, and on d 1, 14, 28, and 49 postpartum to measure LFC and glycogen concentrations. Cows were grouped accordingly to mean total LFC on d 1, 14, and 28 in high, medium, and low fat-mobilizing cows. Mean LFC (±SEM) differed among groups and were 351±14, 250±10, and 159±9 mg/g of dry matter for high, medium, and low fat-mobilizing cows, respectively, whereas hepatic glycogen concentrations postpartum were the highest in low fat-mobilizing cows. Cows in the low group showed the highest dry matter intake and the least negative energy balance postpartum, but energy-corrected milk yield was similar among groups. The decrease in body weight postpartum was greatest in high fat-mobilizing cows, but the decrease in backfat thickness was greatest in medium fat-mobilizing cows. Plasma concentrations of nonesterified  acids and β-hydroxybutyrate were highest around calving in high fat-mobilizing cows. Plasma triglycerides were highest in the medium group and plasma cholesterol concentrations were lowest in the high group at calving. During early lactation, the decrease in plasma glucose concentrations was greatest in the high group, and plasma insulin concentrations postpartum were highest in the low group. The revised quantitative insulin sensitivity check index values decreased during the transition period and postpartum, and were highest in the medium group. Plasma cortisol concentrations during the transition period and postpartum period and plasma leptin concentrations were highest in the medium group. In conclusion, cows adapted differently to the metabolic load and used variable strategies for homeorhetic regulation of milk production. Differences in fat mobilization were part of these strategies and contributed to the individual adaptation of energy metabolism to milk production.Copyright © 2013 American Dairy Science Association.

Herein, we examined whether Nrf2 (Nfe2l2) activation occurs at early steps of rat hepatocarcinogenesis, to assess critical contributions of Nrf2 to the onset of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).We used wild-type (WT) and Nrf2 knockout (Nrf2KO) rats treated with a single injection of diethylnitrosamine (DENA) followed by choline-devoid methionine-deficient (CMD) diet. This experimental model causes massive  and steatohepatitis with fibrosis and enables identification of early stages of hepatocarcinogenesis.We found that Nrf2 activation takes place in early preneoplastic lesions identified by the marker glutathione S-transferase placental form (GSTP). Nrf2 missense mutations, known to disrupt the Keap1-Nrf2 binding, were present in 65.7% of GSTP-positive foci. Nrf2KO rats were used to directly investigate whether Nrf2 is critical for initiation and/or clonal expansion of DENA-damaged hepatocytes. While Nrf2 genetic inactivation did not alter DENA-induced initiation, it led to increased  injury and chronic compensatory hepatocyte regeneration when rats were fed a CMD diet. However, in spite of such a permissive environment, the livers of Nrf2KO rats did not display any preneoplastic lesion unlike those of WT rats.These results demonstrate that, in a model of hepatocarcinogenesis resembling human non-alcoholic  disease: i) Nrf2 is activated at early steps of the tumorigenic process and ii) Nrf2 is mandatory for the clonal expansion of initiated cells, indicating that Nrf2 is critical in the onset of HCC.Dysregulation of the Keap1-Nrf2 molecular pathway has been observed in human tumors. In a nutritional model of hepatocarcinogenesis, the protein Nrf2 is frequently mutated/activated at early steps of the tumorigenic process. Herein, we show that Nrf2 is mandatory for the development of preneoplastic lesions.
