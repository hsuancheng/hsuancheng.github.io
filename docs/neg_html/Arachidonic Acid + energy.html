Gamma-tocotrienol (γT3) is an unsaturated vitamin E that has been demonstrated to attenuate NLRP3-inflammasome. However, the role of γT3 in regulating eicosanoid formation is unknown. We hypothesized that γT3 abolishes the eicosanoid production by modulating the macrophage lipidome. LPS-primed bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) were stimulated with saturated fatty acids (SFA) along with γT3, and the effects of γT3 in modulating macrophage lipidome were quantified by using mass spectrometry based-shotgun lipidomic approaches. The SFA-mediated inflammasome activation induced robust changes in lipid species of glycerolipids (GL), glycerophospholipids (GPL), and sphingolipids in BMDM, which were distinctly different in the γT3-treated BMDM. The γT3 treatment caused substantial decreases of lysophospholipids (LysoPL), diacylglycerol (DAG), and free  (AA, C20:4), indicating that γT3 limits the availability of AA, the precursor for eicosanoids. This was confirmed by the pulse-chase experiment using [H]-AA, and by diminished prostaglandin E (PGE) secretion by ELISA. Concurrently, γT3 inhibited LPS-induced cyclooxygenases 2 (COX2) induction, further suppressing prostaglandin synthesis. In addition, γT3 attenuated ceramide synthesis by transcriptional downregulation of key enzymes for de novo synthesis. The altered lipid metabolism during inflammation is linked to reduced ATP production, which was partly rescued by γT3. Taken together, our work revealed that γT3 induces distinct modification of the macrophage lipidome to reduce AA release and corresponding lipid mediator synthesis, leading to attenuated cellular lipotoxicity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

A total of 40 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to four groups, namely: control; low-dose (0.13 mg/kg·body weight [bw]); middle-dose (0.80 mg/kg·bw); and high-dose (4.89 mg/kg·bw). The rats received CdCl daily via drinking water for 24 weeks. Rat kidneys were collected for metabonomics analysis. Principal components analysis and partial least-squares discriminant analysis were used to investigate the metabonomics profile changes in the kidney samples and to screen the potential biomarkers. Ten metabolites were identified in the positive and negative ion modes. Compared with the control group, the intensities of tetranor 12-HETE, uric , hypoxanthine, phenylacetylglycine, guanidinosuccinic  and xanthosine significantly increased (P < 0.01), and those of imidazolelactic , lactose 6-phosphate, l-urobilinogen and  significantly decreased (P < 0.01) in the high-dose group. Results showed that exposure to Cd in rats induced oxidative stress to the kidneys and disrupted amino  metabolism, fatty  metabolism and  metabolism.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30217553>CB1 receptors in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus modulate the release of 5-HT and GABA to stimulate food intake in rats.</a></h2><p>Endocannabinoids and their receptors not only contribute to the control of natural processes of appetite regulation and  balance but also have an important role in the pathogenesis of obesity. CB1 receptors (CB1R) are expressed in several hypothalamic nuclei, including the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), where induce potent orexigenic responses. Activation of CB1R in the PVN induces hyperphagia by modulating directly or indirectly orexigenic and anorexigenic signals; however, interaction among these mediators has not been clearly defined. CB1R mRNA is expressed in serotonergic neurons that innervate the PVN, and activation of 5-HT receptors in the PVN constitutes an important satiety signal. Some GABAergic terminals are negatively influenced by 5-HT, suggesting that the hyperphagic effect of CB1R activation could involve changes in serotonergic and GABAergic signaling in the PVN. Accordingly, the present study was aimed to characterize the neurochemical mechanisms related to the hyperphagic effects induced by activation of CB1R in the PVN, studying in vitro and in vivo changes induced by direct activation these receptors. Here, we have found that the neurochemical mechanisms activated by stimulation of CB1 receptors in the PVN involve inhibition of 5-HT release, resulting in a decrease of serotonergic activity mediated by 5-HT and 5-HT receptors and inducing disinhibition of GABA release to stimulate food intake. In conclusion, these neurochemical changes in the PVN are determinant to the cannabinoid-induced stimulation of food intake. Our findings provide evidence of a functional connection among CB1R and serotonergic and GABAergic systems on the control of appetite regulation mediated by endocannabinoids.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. and European College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

However, the extent of food changes needed to achieve these effects is less explored. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of exchanging a few commercially available, regularly consumed key food items (e.g. spread on bread, fat for cooking, cheese, bread and cereals) with improved fat quality on total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and inflammatory markers in a double-blind randomised, controlled trial. In total, 115 moderately hypercholesterolaemic, non-statin-treated adults (25-70 years) were randomly assigned to an experimental diet group (Ex-diet group) or control diet group (C-diet group) for 8 weeks with commercially available food items with different fatty  composition (replacing SFA with mostly n-6 PUFA). In the Ex-diet group, serum total cholesterol (P<0·001) and LDL-cholesterol (P<0·001) were reduced after 8 weeks, compared with the C-diet group. The difference in change between the two groups at the end of the study was -9 and -11 % in total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, respectively. No difference in change in plasma levels of inflammatory markers (high-sensitive C-reactive protein, IL-6, soluble TNF receptor 1 and interferon-γ) was observed between the groups. In conclusion, exchanging a few regularly consumed food items with improved fat quality reduces total cholesterol, with no negative effect on levels of inflammatory markers. This shows that an exchange of a few commercially available food items was easy and manageable and led to clinically relevant cholesterol reduction, potentially affecting future CVD risk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30208088>The effect of exposure to high altitude and low oxygen on intestinal microbial communities in mice.</a></h2><p>This experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of exposure to high altitude and low oxygen on intestinal microbial communities using mice as an animal model. Fecal microbiota from mice housed in a control environment representing 2,200 meters (NC group) above sea level with 16% Oxygen and mice that were placed in a hypobaric chamber representing 5000 meters (HC group) above sea level with 11% Oxygen for 30 days, were analyzed by the HiSeq Illumina sequencing platform. The results showed a significant difference in beta diversity observed between the two groups, while no significant difference was observed in alpha diversity. Compared with the NC group, the relative abundance of class Epsilonproteobacteria, phlym Actinobacteria, class Erysipelotrichia and genus Helicobacter were significantly lower (P<0.05), while the relative abundance of genus Alistipes was increased in the HC group; Phenotypic analysis showed no significant difference in aerobic, anaerobic, facultatively anaerobic, potentially pathogenic, stress tolerant, mobile element, biofilms formation, gram negative and gram positive between HC group and NC group; Functional analysis results showed significant differences in 34 gene functional metabolic pathways (carbohydrate digestion and absorption,  metabolism,  metabolism, flavonoid biosynthesis, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, etc) between HC group and NC group. Together, these findings suggest that exposure to high altitude and low oxygen had the potential to change the intestinal microbial communities, which potentially may modulate metabolic processes in mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27269709>Dietary fat intake and red blood cell fatty  composition of children and women from three different geographical areas in South Africa.</a></h2><p>Dietary fat intake, particularly the type of fat, is reflected in the red blood cell (RBC) fatty  (FA) profile and is vital in growth, development and health maintenance. The FA profile (%wt/wt) of RBC membrane phospholipids (as determined by gas chromatography) and dietary intake (as determined by 24h recall) was assessed in 2-6y old South African children and their caregivers randomly selected from three communities, i.e. an urban Northern Cape community (urban-NC; n=104), an urban coastal Western Cape community (urban-WC; n=93) and a rural Limpopo Province community (rural-LP; n=102). Mean RBC FA values across groups were compared using ANOVA and Bonferroni post-hoc test while controlling for age and gender (children); median dietary intake values were compared using a Kruskal-Wallis test. Dietary intakes for total fat, saturated FAs and polyunsaturated FAs were higher in the two urban areas compared to the rural area. Total fat intake in rural-LP, and omega-3 FA dietary intake in all three areas were lower than the South African adopted guidelines. Dietary SFA intake in both urban areas was higher than recommended by South African guidelines; this was reflected in the RBC membrane FA profile. Rural-LP children had the lowest intake of omega-3 and omega-6 FAs yet presented with the highest RBC docosahexaenoic  (DHA) profile and highest  percentage. Although differences observed in dietary fat intake between the two urban and the rural area were reflected in the RBC membrane total phospholipid FA profile, the lowest total fat and α-linolenic  (ALA) intake by rural children that presented with the highest RBC DHA profile warrants further investigation.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Brain AA metabolism is activated in rodents by the bacterial endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This study tested the hypothesis that dietary LA lowering, which limits plasma supply of AA to the brain, reduces LPS-induced upregulation in brain AA metabolism. Male Fischer CDF344 rats fed an adequate LA (5.2 %  (en)) or low LA (0.4 % en) diet for 15 weeks were infused with LPS (250 ng/h) or vehicle into the fourth ventricle for 2 days using a mini-osmotic pump. The incorporation rate of intravenously infused unesterified C-AA into brain lipids, eicosanoids, and activities of phospholipase A and COX-1 and 2 enzymes were measured. Dietary LA lowering reduced the LPS-induced increase in prostaglandin E concentration and COX-2 activity (P < 0.05 by two-way ANOVA) without altering phospholipase activity. The C-AA incorporation rate into brain lipids was decreased by dietary LA lowering (P < 0.05 by two-way ANOVA). The present findings suggest that dietary LA lowering reduced LPS-induced increase in brain markers of AA metabolism. The clinical utility of LA lowering in brain disorders should be explored in future studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28790443>Endocannabinoid tone is higher in healthy lean South Asian than white Caucasian men.</a></h2><p>South Asians have a higher risk to develop obesity and related disorders compared to white Caucasians. This is likely in part due to their lower resting  expenditure (REE) as related with less -combusting brown adipose tissue (BAT). Since overactivation of the endocannabinoid system is associated with obesity and low BAT activity, we hypothesized that South Asians have a higher endocannabinoid tone. Healthy lean white Caucasian (n = 10) and South Asian (n = 10) men were cold-exposed to activate BAT. Before and after cooling, REE was assessed and plasma was collected for analysis of endocannabinoids and lipids. At thermoneutrality, South Asians had higher plasma levels of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG; 11.36 vs 8.19 pmol/mL, p < 0.05), N-arachidonylethanolamine (AEA; 1.04 vs 0.89 pmol/mL, p = 0.05) and  (AA; 23.24 vs 18.22 nmol/mL, p < 0.001). After pooling of both ethnicities, plasma 2-AG but not AEA positively correlated with triglycerides (R = 0.32, p < 0.05) and body fat percentage (R = 0.18, p < 0.05). Interestingly, AA negative correlated with REE (R = 0.46, p < 0.001) and positively with body fat percentage (R = 0.33, p < 0.01). Cooling increased endocannabinoids. In conclusion, South Asian compared to white Caucasian men have higher endocannabinoid tone. This suggests that endocannabinoids may, at least in part, underlie the disadvantageous metabolic phenotype of South Asians later in life.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27914508>Determinants of plasma phospholipid  and docosahexaenoic acids among adolescent girls in central Mozambique - possible roles of iron and zinc.</a></h2><p>We explored if linoleic  (LA) and alpha-linolenic  (ALA) will be efficiently converted to  (AA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) in the adolescent girls (aged 15-18 years, n=145) in Mozambique consuming habitually low fat diet and if low iron and/or zinc status predicts the conversion. Total fat, LA and ALA intakes were 15-19%, 1.2-3.5% and 0.2-0.3% of , respectively in three areas. Iron and zinc intake varied between 9.6-12.3mg/day and 3.6-5.0mg/day. Significant negative association of plasma AA was found with plasma LA and ALA and significant positive association with serum ferritin. Plasma DHA associated, negatively with plasma LA and ALA. We showed that in a population with low intakes of LA and ALA, the proportions of phospholipid LA and ALA determines the relative proportions of AA and DHA and low iron status probably attenuates the conversion of LA to AA.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aimed to investigate the hepatoprotective effect of LR on mice with CCl-induced acute liver injury through conventional assays and metabolomics analysis. This study consisted of male mice ( = 23) in four groups (i.e., control, model, positive control, and LR). The extract of whole plant of LR was used to treat mice in the LR group. Biochemical and histological assays (i.e., serum levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), and histological changes of liver tissue) were used to evaluate LR efficacy, and metabolomics analysis based on GC-MS and LC-MS was conducted to reveal metabolic changes. The conventional analysis and metabolomic profiles both suggested that LR treatment could protect mice against CCl-induced acute liver injury. The affected metabolic pathways included linoleic  metabolism, α-linolenic  metabolism,  metabolism, CoA biosynthesis, glycerophospholipid metabolism, the TCA cycle, and purine metabolism. This study identified eight metabolites, including phosphopantothenic , succinic , AMP, choline, glycerol 3-phosphate, linoleic , , and DHA, as potential biomarkers for evaluating hepatoprotective effect of LR.

The heart has metabolic capability for  production and homeostasis. This homeostatic machinery can also process xenobiotics. Cardiac metabolism includes the expression of numerous organic anion transporters, organic cation transporters, organic carnitine (zwitterion) transporters, and ATP-binding cassette transporters. Expression and distribution of the transporters within the heart may vary, depending on the patient's age, disease, endocrine status, and various other factors. Several cytochrome P450 (P450) enzyme classes have been identified within the heart. The P450 hydroxylases and epoxygenases within the heart produce hydroxyeicosatetraneoic acids and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, metabolites of , which are critical in regulating homeostatic processes of the heart. The susceptibility of the cardiac P450 system to induction and inhibition from exogenous materials is an area of expanding knowledge, as are the metabolic processes of glucuronidation and sulfation in the heart. The susceptibility of various transcription factors and signaling pathways of the heart to disruption by xenobiotics is not fully characterized but is an area with implications for disruption of normal postnatal development, as well as modulation of adult cardiac health. There are knowledge gaps in the timelines of physiologic maturation and deterioration of cardiac metabolism. Cross-species characterization of cardiac-specific metabolism is needed for nonclinical work of optimum translational value to predict possible adverse effects, identify sensitive developmental windows for the design and conduct of informative nonclinical and clinical studies, and explore the possibilities of organ-specific therapeutics.Copyright © 2019 by The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30668373>Potential target-related proteins in rabbit platelets treated with active monomers dehydrocorydaline and canadine from Rhizoma corydalis.</a></h2><p>Dehydrocorydaline (DHC) and canadine (THB) are two active alkaloid compounds in Corydalis yanhusuo (Y.H. Chou & Chun C. Hsu) W.T. Wang ex Z.Y. Su & C.Y. Wu (Papaveraceae) (Rhizoma Corydalis). DHC and THC were previously shown to exert anti-platelet aggregation effect dose-dependently, but their exact mechanisms had not yet been addressed. Therefore, it is essential to study the mechanisms of DHC and THB affecting on platelet's function.To investigate the anti-platelet effects and corresponding signal cascades of DHC and THB on platelet aggregation.Firstly, in vitro anti-platelet aggregation of DHC and THB induced by different agonists including thrombin (THR), adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and  (AA) were determined through turbidimetry method. Then the possible target-related platelet proteins after treated with DHC/THB were separated and identified by two dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and MALDI-TOF-MS/MS analysis, respectively. Finally, the signal cascades network induced by DHC/THB were predicted through functional analysis of these proteins along with the determination of platelet DAG concentration.The platelet aggregation stimulated by THR, ADP and AA were inhibited by DHC and THB dose-dependently to a certain degree. Meanwhile, DHC and THB had the strongest effect on ADP- and THR-induced platelet aggregation respectively. In addition, treatment of these two compounds caused regulations of about sixty proteins in platelet, including cytoskeleton proteins, cell signaling proteins, proteins related to material  metabolism, etc. CONCLUSIONS: Using proteomic analysis combined with platelet aggregation test and ELISA, this study was successful in exploring the possible mechanisms of DHC/THB on platelet aggregation. DHC might inhibit platelet aggregation by a mechanism involving the ADP receptors P2Y1 and P2Y12, and the effect of THB on platelet function may be related to its binding to THR receptor PAR1 for mediated Gi signaling pathway.

They play an important role in mediating neurovascular coupling (NVC) via several astrocytic Ca -dependent signalling pathways such as K release through B channels, and the production and release of  metabolites. They are also involved in maintaining the resting tone of the cerebral vessels by releasing ATP and COX-1 derivatives. Evidence also supports a role for astrocytes in maintaining blood pressure-dependent change in cerebrovascular tone, and perhaps also in blood vessel-to-neuron signalling as posited by the 'hemo-neural hypothesis'. Thus, astrocytes are emerging as new stars in preserving the intricate balance between the high  demand of active neurons and the supply of oxygen and nutrients from the blood by maintaining both resting blood flow and activity-evoked changes therein. Following neuropathology, astrocytes become reactive and many of their key signalling mechanisms are altered, including those involved in NVC. Furthermore, as they can respond to changes in vascular pressure, cardiovascular diseases might exert previously unknown effects on the central nervous system by altering astrocyte function. This review discusses the role of astrocytes in neurovascular signalling in both physiology and pathology, and the impact of these findings on understanding BOLD-fMRI signals.© 2016 The Authors.

The model utilized serum eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, ω-3): (AA, ω-6) ratios as biomarkers of colonic mucosal PGE concentration. Normal human volunteers were given low and high ω-3 fatty  test doses for 2 weeks. This established a slope and intercept of the line for dose versus serum EPA:AA ratio in each individual. The slope and intercept was utilized to calculate a personalized target dose that was given for 12 weeks. This target dose was calculated on the basis of a model, initially derived from lean rodents, showing a log-linear relationship between serum EPA:AA ratios and colonic mucosal PGE reduction. Bayesian methods allowed addition of human data to the rodent model as the trial progressed. The dosing model aimed to achieve a serum EPA:AA ratio that is associated with a 50% reduction in colonic PGE Mean colonic mucosal PGE concentrations were 6.55 ng/mg protein (SD, 5.78) before any supplementation and 3.59 ng/mg protein (SD, 3.29) after 12 weeks of target dosing. In secondary analyses, the decreases in PGE were significantly attenuated in overweight and obese participants. This occurred despite a higher target dose for the obese versus normal weight participants, as generated by the pharmacodynamic predictive model. Large decreases also were observed in 12-hydroxyicosatetraenoic acids, and PGE increased substantially. Future biomarker-driven dosing models for cancer prevention therefore should consider  balance as well as overall eicosanoid homeostasis in normal tissue. .©2017 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27412860>Evolutionary alteration of ALOX15 specificity optimizes the biosynthesis of antiinflammatory and proresolving lipoxins.</a></h2><p>ALOX15 (12/15-lipoxygenase) orthologs have been implicated in maturational degradation of intracellular organelles and in the biosynthesis of antiinflammatory and proresolving eicosanoids. Here we hypothesized that lower mammals (mice, rats, pigs) express 12-lipoxygenating ALOX15 orthologs. In contrast, 15-lipoxygenating isoforms are found in higher primates (orangutans, men), and these results suggest an evolution of ALOX15 specificity. To test this hypothesis we first cloned and characterized ALOX15 orthologs of selected Catarrhini representing different stages of late primate evolution and found that higher primates (men, chimpanzees) express 15-lipoxygenating orthologs. In contrast, lower primates (baboons, rhesus monkeys) express 12-lipoxygenating enzymes. Gibbons, which are flanked in evolution by rhesus monkeys (12-lipoxygenating ALOX15) and orangutans (15-lipoxygenating ALOX15), express an ALOX15 ortholog with pronounced dual specificity. To explore the driving force for this evolutionary alterations, we quantified the lipoxin synthase activity of 12-lipoxygenating (rhesus monkey, mouse, rat, pig, humIle418Ala) and 15-lipoxygenating (man, chimpanzee, orangutan, rabbit, ratLeu353Phe) ALOX15 variants and found that, when normalized to their  oxygenase activities, the lipoxin synthase activities of 15-lipoxygenating ALOX15 variants were more than fivefold higher (P < 0.01) [corrected]. Comparative molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations indicated that, for the 15-lipoxygenating rabbit ALOX15, the  barrier for C13-hydrogen abstraction (15-lipoxygenation) was 17 kJ/mol lower than for  12-lipoxygenation. In contrast, for the 12-lipoxygenating Ile418Ala mutant, the  barrier for 15-lipoxygenation was 10 kJ/mol higher than for 12-lipoxygenation.

Therefore, the effects of phytohormones on lipid and  (ARA) biosynthesis in Mortierella alpina were investigated in this study. At proper concentrations, the stimulatory effects of phytohormones on lipid production were determined to be as follows: 6-benzyl adenine (BA) > indole-3-acetic  (IAA) > furfuryl adenine (KT) > gibberellin (GA) > indole-3-butyric  (IBA) > abscisic  (ABA). The results show that in the presence of 15 mg L BA, the best positive effect was obtained, in which the lipid and ARA yields of M. alpina increased by 20.34% and 29.17%, respectively. Surprisingly, there was no synergy between the addition of two cytokinins (KT and BA), while adding cytokinins (KT or BA) and auxin (IAA) inhibited the growth of M. alpina and the ARA yield decreased by approximately 64%. Additional studies, such as those involving enzyme activity detection and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction were carried out to check the fatty  and lipid biosynthesis when the phytohormones were present. The activity of the main NADPH-supplying enzyme, 6-phosphoglucose dehydrogenase (G6PDH), increased by 19.52%. Moreover, the transcription levels of fatty  synthase (FAS), Δ9-desaturase, and diacylglycerolacyltransferase (DGAT) increased by 9.3, 9.6 and 7.7 times, respectively, when only one type of phytohormone was present, indicating the enhancement of fatty  and lipid biosynthesis in M. alpina. This study demonstrates the potential application of phytohormones for improving ARA yields of M. alpina.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This study aimed to examine whether eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and  (ARA) supplementation can protect fish cells against the negative impact of chlorpyrifos (CPF). Atlantic salmon hepatocytes were exposed to either 100 μM CPF, 200 μM EPA, 200 μM ARA, or combinations of these for 48 h, and endpoints included lipid droplet formation, gene expression, and global metabolomic analysis. The results showed that polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) supplementation modified the cell lipid composition, reduced uptake of CPF and increased the cellular number and size of lipid droplets. CPF exposure induced the transcription of ppara and fabp3, and reduced the levels of several PUFAs, and lead to accumulation of monoacylglycerols (MAGs) in the cells. Supplementation of EPA or ARA did not prevent CPF-induced accumulation of MAGs and only to a limited degree rescued the response on other lipids. CPF exposure further reduced  metabolism, a response partly restored by PUFA supplementation. Reduced levels of glutathione indicated oxidative stress; an effect not ameliorated by the PUFAs. Altogether, this study shows that PUFA supplementation only modestly protects Atlantic salmon hepatocytes against the negative impact of CPF.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Here, we have made αS multimers in vitro using  (ARA), one of the most abundant fatty acids in the brain, and characterized them by a combination of bulk experiments and single-molecule Fӧrster resonance  transfer (sm-FRET) measurements. The data suggest that ARA-induced oligomers are alpha-helical, resistant to fibril formation, more prone to disaggregation, enzymatic digestion and degradation by the 26S proteasome, and lead to lower neuronal damage and reduced activation of microglia compared to the oligomers formed in the absence of ARA. These multimers can be formed at physiologically-relevant concentrations, and pathological mutants of αS form less multimers than wild-type αS. Our work provides strong biophysical evidence for the formation of alpha-helical multimers of αS in the presence of a biologically relevant fatty , which may have a protective role with respect to the generation of beta-sheet toxic structures during αS fibrillation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30737304>Metabolomic analysis reveals a protective effect of Fu-Fang-Jin-Qian-Chao herbal granules on oxalate-induced kidney injury.</a></h2><p>Nephrolithiasis is one of the world's major public health burdens with a high incidence and a risk of persistent renal dysfunction. Fu-Fang-Jin-Qian-Chao granules (FFJQC), a traditional Chinese herb formula, is commonly used in treatment of nephrolithiasis. However, the therapeutic mechanism of FFJQC on kidney stone has still been a mystery. The objective of the present study is to explore the therapeutic mechanism of FFJQC on kidney injury and identify unique metabolomics patterns using a mouse model of kidney stone induced by a calcium oxalate (CaOx) deposition. Von Kossa staining and immuno-histopathological staining of osteopontin (OPN), cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44) and calbindin-D28k were conducted on renal sections. Biochemical analysis was performed on serum, urine, and kidney tissues. A metabolomics approach based on ultra-HPLC coupled with quadrupole-TOF-MS (UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS) was used for serum metabolic profiling. The immunohistopathological and biochemical analysis showed the therapeutic benefits of FFJQC. The expression levels of OPN and CD44 were decreased while calbindin-D28k increased after the CaOx injured mice were treated with FFJQC. In addition, total of 81 serum metabolites were identified to be associated with protective effects of FFJQC on CaOx crystal injured mice.

However, the transcriptional events underlying these processes have not been fully characterized. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying mouth-opening acclimation, RNA-seq was used to investigate the transcriptional profiles of the endogenous feeding, mixed feeding and exogenous feeding stages of zebrafish larvae. Differential expression analysis showed 2172 up-regulated and 2313 down-regulated genes during this stage. Genes associated with the assimilation of exogenous nutrients such as the  metabolism, linoleic  metabolism, fat digestion and absorption, and lipogenesis were activated significantly, whereas dissimilation including the cell cycle, homologous recombination, and fatty  metabolism were inhibited, indicating a physiological switch for  storage occurred during the mouth-opening stage. Moreover, the immune recognition involved in the antigen processing and presentation pathway was activated and nutritional supply seemed to be required in this event confirmed by qPCR. These results suggested the  utilization during the mouth-opening stage is more tended to be reserved or used for some important demands, such as activity regulation, immune defense, and lipid deposition, instead of rapid growth. The findings of this study are important for understanding the physiological switches during the mouth-opening stage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28488728>Fatty  amide hydrolase (FAAH) regulates hypercapnia/ischemia-induced increases in n-acylethanolamines in mouse brain.</a></h2><p>N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) are endogenous lipid ligands for several receptors including cannabinoid receptors and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-α), which regulate numerous physiological functions. Fatty  amide hydrolase (FAAH) is largely responsible for the degradation of NAEs. However, at high concentrations of ethanolamines and unesterified fatty acids, FAAH can also catalyze the reverse reaction, producing NAEs. Several brain insults such as ischemia and hypoxia increase brain unesterified fatty acids. Because FAAH can catalyze the synthesis of NAE, we aimed to test whether FAAH was necessary for CO -induced hypercapnia/ischemia increases in NAE. To test this, we examined levels of NAEs, 1- and 2-arachidonoylglycerols as well as their corresponding fatty  precursors in wild-type and mice lacking FAAH (FAAH-KO) with three Kill methods: (i) head-focused, high- microwave irradiation (microwave), (ii) 5 min CO followed by microwave irradiation (CO + microwave), and (iii) 5 min CO only (CO ). Both CO -induced groups increased, to a similar extent, brain levels of unesterified oleic, , and docosahexaenoic  and 1- and 2-arachidonoylglycerols compared to the microwave group in both wild-type and FAAH-KO mice. Oleoylethanolamide (OEA), arachidonoylethanolamide (AEA), and docosahexaenoylethanolamide (DHEA) levels were about 8-, 7-, and 2.5-fold higher, respectively, in the FAAH-KO mice compared with the wild-type mice. Interestingly, the concentrations of OEA, AEA, and DHEA increased 2.5- to 4-fold in response to both CO -induced groups in wild-type mice, but DHEA increased only in the CO group in FAAH-KO mice. Our study demonstrates that FAAH is necessary for CO - induced increases in OEA and AEA but not DHEA. Targeting brain FAAH could impair the production of NAEs in response to brain injuries.© 2017 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27550920>Heteromerization Between the Bradykinin B2 Receptor and the Angiotensin-(1-7) Mas Receptor: Functional Consequences.</a></h2><p>Bradykinin B2 receptor (B2R) and angiotensin-(1-7) Mas receptor (MasR)-mediated effects are physiologically interconnected. The molecular basis for such cross talk is unknown. It is hypothesized that the cross talk occurs at the receptor level. We investigated B2R-MasR heteromerization and the functional consequences of such interaction. B2R fused to the cyan fluorescent protein and MasR fused to the yellow fluorescent protein were transiently coexpressed in human embryonic kidney293T cells. Fluorescence resonance  transfer analysis showed that B2R and MasR formed a constitutive heteromer, which was not modified by their agonists. B2R or MasR antagonists decreased fluorescence resonance  transfer efficiency, suggesting that the antagonist promoted heteromer dissociation. B2R-MasR heteromerization induced an 8-fold increase in the MasR ligand-binding affinity. On agonist stimulation, the heteromer was internalized into early endosomes with a slower sequestration rate from the plasma membrane, compared with single receptors. B2R-MasR heteromerization induced a greater increase in  release and extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation after angiotensin-(1-7) stimulation, and this effect was blocked by the B2R antagonist. Concerning serine/threonine kinase Akt activity, a significant bradykinin-promoted activation was detected in B2R-MasR but not in B2R-expressing cells. Angiotensin-(1-7) and bradykinin elicited antiproliferative effects only in cells expressing B2R-MasR heteromers, but not in cells expressing each receptor alone. Proximity ligation assay confirmed B2R-MasR interaction in human glomerular endothelial cells supporting the interaction between both receptors in vivo. Our findings provide an explanation for the cross talk between bradykinin B2R and angiotensin-(1-7) MasR-mediated effects. B2R-MasR heteromerization induces functional changes in the receptor that may lead to long-lasting protective properties.© 2016 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29808461>Angiogenesis and vascular stability in eicosanoids and cancer.</a></h2><p>Angiogenesis and inflammation are hallmarks of cancer.  and other polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are primarily metabolized by three distinct enzymatic systems initiated by cyclooxygenases, lipoxygenases, and cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP) to generate bioactive eicosanoids, including prostanoids, leukotrienes, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. As some of the PUFA metabolites playing essential roles in inflammatory processes, these pathways have been widely studied as therapeutic targets of inflammation. Because of their anti-inflammatory effects, these pathways were also proposed as anti-cancer targets. However, although the eicosanoids were linked to endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis almost two decades ago, it is only recently PUFA metabolites, especially those generated by CYP enzymes and the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), have been recognized as important signaling mediators in physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Despite the fact that tumor growth and invasion are heavily dependent on inner-tumor angiogenesis and influenced by vascular stability, the role played by PUFA metabolites in tumor angiogenesis and vessel integrity has been largely overlooked. This review highlights current knowledge on the function of PUFA metabolites generated by the CYP/sEH pathway in angiogenesis and vascular stability as well as their potential involvement in cancer development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29649756>Transcriptional effects of phospholipid fatty  profile on rainbow trout liver cells exposed to methylmercury.</a></h2><p>Lipids, and their constitutive fatty acids, are key nutrients for fish health as they provide , maintain cell structure, are precursors of signalling molecules and act as nuclear receptor ligands. These specific roles may be of crucial importance in a context of exposure to pollutants. We recently showed that the fatty  profile of rainbow trout liver cell phospholipids modulates sensitivity to an acute methylmercury challenge. In order to investigate mechanisms of effects, we herein tested whether specific polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may protect cells from methylmercury through decreasing intracellular mercury accumulation and/or enhancing cellular defences (e.g. via modulation of gene expression patterns). We also investigated the inverse relationship and assessed the impact of methylmercury on cellular fatty  metabolism. To do so, the fatty  composition of rainbow trout liver cell phospholipids was first modified by incubating them in a medium enriched in a specific PUFA from either the n-3 family (alpha-linolenic , ALA; eicosapentaenoic , EPA) or the n-6 family (linoleic , LA; , AA). Cells were then exposed to methylmercury (0.15 or 0.50 μM) for 24 h and sampled thereafter for assessing phospholipid fatty  profile, intracellular total mercury burden, and expression pattern of genes involved in fatty  metabolism, synthesis of PUFA-derived signalling molecules and stress response. We observed that cells incorporated the given PUFA and some biotransformation products in their phospholipids. Methylmercury had few impacts on this cellular phospholipid composition. None of the PUFA enrichments affected the cellular mercury burden, suggesting that the previously observed cytoprotection conferred by ALA and EPA was not linked to a global decrease in cellular accumulation of mercury. Fatty  enrichments and methylmercury exposure both modulated gene expression patterns. Genes involved in the synthesis of PUFA-derived signalling molecules, in stress response and the orphan cytochrome P450 20A1 were identified as possible sites of interaction between fatty acids and methylmercury in rainbow trout liver cells.Copyright © 2018.

The objective of this study was to assess the modulatory effect of PSO on lipid metabolism. Lard oil, safflower oil (SFO), and PSO were fed to wistar rats with 1% cholesterol in the diet for 60 d. Serum and liver lipids showed significant decrease in total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in PSO fed rats compared to lard oil and SFO fed rats.

We integrated transcriptomic data for two clonal subpopulations from a prostate cancer cell line (PC-3) into a genome-scale metabolic network model to explore their metabolic differences and potential vulnerabilities. In this dual cell model, PC-3/S cells express Epithelial-mesenchymal-transition markers and display high invasiveness and low metastatic potential, while PC-3/M cells present the opposite phenotype and higher proliferative rate. Model-driven analysis and experimental validations unveiled a marked metabolic reprogramming in long-chain fatty acids metabolism. While PC-3/M cells showed an enhanced entry of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria, PC-3/S cells used long-chain fatty acids as precursors of eicosanoid metabolism. We suggest that this metabolic reprogramming endows PC-3/M cells with augmented  metabolism for fast proliferation and PC-3/S cells with increased eicosanoid production impacting angiogenesis, cell adhesion and invasion. PC-3/S metabolism also promotes the accumulation of docosahexaenoic , a long-chain fatty  with antiproliferative effects.

Lobosphaera incisa is a fresh water unicellular alga, which in response to nutrient stress accumulates a high amount of TAGs with a high proportion of  (ARA). The final committed step of de novo TAG biosynthesis is catalyzed by acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGATs), which add a fatty  (FA) to the final sn-3 position of diacylglycerol (DAG).Genome analysis revealed the presence of five putative DGAT isoforms in L. incisa, including one DGAT of type 1, three DGATs of type 2 and a single isoform of a type 3 DGAT. For LiDGAT1, LiDGAT2.1, LiDGAT2.2 and LiDGAT2.3 enzyme activity was confirmed by expressing them in the TAG-deficient yeast strain H1246. Feeding experiments of yeast transformants with fatty acids suggest a broad substrate specificity spectrum for LiDGAT1. A significant TAG production in response to exogenous ARA was found for LiDGAT2.2. Cellular localization of the four type 1 and type 2 DGATs expressed in yeast revealed that they all localize to distinct ER domains. A prominent association of LiDGAT1 with ER domains in close proximity to forming lipid droplets (LDs) was also observed.The data revealed a distinct molecular, functional and cellular nature of type 1 and type 2 DGATs from L. incisa, with LiDGAT1 being a major contributor to the TAG pool. LiDGATs of type 2 might be in turn involved in the incorporation of unusual fatty acids into TAG and thus regulate the composition of TAG.

Most plasma FFA are bound to albumin. Only when FFA dissociate from albumin, do they become biologically active.To measure the first FFAu profiles in human infants and to measure these profiles before and during intravenous administration of the soybean lipid, intralipid (IL).The study population was 16 premature infants, from a parent study of 130 infants with birth weights 500-2000 g and gestational age 23-34 weeks. The infants chosen had plasma samples of ≥120 µL (volume needed for each FFAu profile measurement) in the first day of life. Infants received IL infusions starting in the second day of life at 1 g/kg/day, increasing by 1-g/kg/day daily up to 3 g/kg/day. FFAu profiles were determined during IL infusion when plasma was available. Profiles are the concentrations of the nine most abundant long-chain FFAu and were determined using novel fluorescent probes.Before intralipid infusion unbound myristic  was the dominant FFAu, as high as 78% of the total FFAu (sum of the 9 FFAu). In contrast, unbound linoleic  was 0% in all infants. With increasing infusion of IL to 3 g/kg/day, unbound linoleic increased to 26% of the total FFAu, with unbound oleic, myristic, and linolenic  the second, third and fourth most abundant. The average total FFAu concentration also increased from 4 nM before intralipid to 53 nM at 3 g/kg/day. During IL infusion the FFAu profiles approached the fatty  composition of intralipid at 3 g/kg/day.This first study of FFAu profiles in neonates revealed that before IL infusion unbound linoleic  was zero in all 16 infants and levels of myristic  were exceptionally large, as much as 78% of the total FFAu profile. These results suggest important and previously unrecognized roles of lipid metabolism in early development. Zero unbound linoleic  before IL infusion may help promote closure of the ductus arteriosus but after IL infusion, synthesis of  from linoleic  may tend to promote patency. The high levels of unbound myristate may be needed for immediate neonatal  needs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30823619>Feed Restriction Reveals Distinct Serum Metabolome Profiles in Chickens Divergent in Feed Efficiency Traits.</a></h2><p>Restrictive feeding influences systemic metabolism of nutrients; however, this impact has not been evaluated in chickens of diverging feed efficiency. This study investigated the effect of ad libitum versus restrictive feeding (85% of ad libitum) on the serum metabolome and white blood cell composition in chickens of diverging residual feed intake (RFI; metric for feed efficiency). Blood samples were collected between days 33 and 37 post-hatch. While serum glucose was similar, serum uric  and cholesterol were indicative of the nutritional status and chicken's RFI, respectively. Feed restriction and RFI rank caused distinct serum metabolome profiles, whereby restrictive feeding also increased the blood lymphocyte proportion. Most importantly, 10 amino acids were associated with RFI rank in birds, whereas restrictive feeding affected almost all detected lysophosphatidylcholines, with 3 being higher and 6 being lower in restrictively compared to ad libitum fed chickens. As indicated by relevance networking, isoleucine, lysine, valine, histidine, and ornithine were the most discriminant for high RFI, whereas 3 biogenic amines (carnosine, putrescine, and spermidine) and 3 diacyl-glycerophospholipids (38:4, 38:5, and 40:5) positively correlated with feed intake and body weight gain, respectively. Only for taurine, feed intake mostly explained the RFI-associated variation, whereas for most metabolites, other host physiological factors played a greater role for the RFI-associated differences, and was potentially related to insulin-signaling, phospholipase A2, and  metabolism. Alterations in the hepatic synthesis of long-chain fatty acids and the need for precursors for gluconeogenesis due to varying  demand may explain the marked differences in serum metabolite profiles in ad libitum and restrictively fed birds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26939992>Does overwinter temperature affect maternal body composition and egg traits in yellow perch Perca flavescens?</a></h2><p>Female yellow perch Perca flavescens exposed to three overwinter temperature regimes (4, 8 and 13° C) for 150 days spawned in markedly different proportions upon spring warming (37% of females in 4° C v. 64 and 91% in 8 and 13° C treatments, respectively), but exhibited no differences in fecundity, egg size or egg lipid content. Females held at 4° C also exhibited less within-clutch egg size variation than females held at 13° C. Moreover, eggs differed among temperature treatments in the overall proportions of 18 fatty acids, with the colder treatments resulting in potentially higher quality eggs containing more of the unsaturated fatty acids C16:1, C22:6-n3 and C18:2 cis. Female somatic condition also varied with temperature. Maternal somatic growth and protein content increased while lipid content decreased in 13° C compared to the colder treatments. There were, however, no differences among treatments in the fatty  composition of maternal muscle. These results suggest that the temperatures experienced during winter may be less influential to P. flavescens egg size or number, which may exhibit relatively little plasticity in this species, but can alter both the number of females that spawn and the overall composition of eggs and maternal somatic tissues, which may have implications for future reproductive success.© 2016 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839735>Untargeted metabolomics profiles delineate metabolic alterations in mouse plasma during lung carcinoma development using UPLC-QTOF/MS in MS mode.</a></h2><p>In this work, an untargeted metabolomic method based on ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF/MS) in MS (E represents collision ) mode was exploited to determine the dynamic metabolic alterations in the plasma of male C57BL/6 mice during the onset and development of lung carcinoma.

According to previous experiments, human milk fat is partially lost during continuous enteral nutrition. However, these experiments were done over relatively short infusion times, and a complete profile of the lost fatty acids was never measured. Whether this loss happens considering longer infusion times or if some fatty acids are lost more than others remain unknown.

Total fat loss after 24 h infusion was 0.6 ± 0.1% of the total fat infused, although the highest losses occur in the first 30 min of infusion (13.0 ± 1.6%).

In addition, we performed a secondary study looking at molecular responses of ARA supplementation following an acute exercise bout in rodents.Thirty strength-trained males (age: 20.4 ± 2.1 yrs) were randomly divided into two groups: ARA or placebo (i.e. CTL). Then, both groups underwent an 8-week, 3-day per week, non-periodized training protocol. Quadriceps muscle thickness, whole-body composition scan (DEXA), muscle strength, and power were assessed at baseline and post-test. In the rodent model, male Wistar rats (~250 g, ~8 weeks old) were pre-fed with either ARA or water (CTL) for 8 days and were fed the final dose of ARA prior to being acutely strength trained via electrical stimulation on unilateral plantar flexions. A mixed muscle sample was removed from the exercised and non-exercised leg 3 hours post-exercise.Lean body mass (2.9%, p<0.0005), upper-body strength (8.7%, p<0.0001), and peak power (12.7%, p<0.0001) increased only in the ARA group. For the animal trial, GSK-β (Ser9) phosphorylation (p<0.001) independent of exercise and AMPK phosphorylation after exercise (p-AMPK less in ARA, p = 0.041) were different in ARA-fed versus CTL rats.Our findings suggest that ARA supplementation can positively augment strength-training induced adaptations in resistance-trained males.

Ultra-distal, mid- and total- distal forearm bone mineral content, adjusted for sex, age percentage body fat, race and forearm length were 10 to 13% greater in children in the first AA tertile relative to the third. Children in the second tertile had the highest bone cross-sectional area and estimated strength at the 66% radius. Muscle cross-sectional area was 15% lower in the third tertile compared to the first, along with higher fasting insulin concentrations (27%) and HOMA-IR (31%). Higher RBC AA status aligns with deficits in forearm bone mass, geometry, and muscle mass in children with excess adiposity and early signs of insulin resistance. • Higher  status is associated with lower forearm bone mass in children with overweight condition or obesity • Children with higher  status had increased fasting insulin concentrations and indices of insulin resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28903622>Maternal dietary n-6 polyunsaturated fatty  deprivation does not exacerbate post-weaning reductions in  and its mediators in the mouse hippocampus.</a></h2><p>The present study examines how lowering maternal dietary n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (starting from pregnancy) compared to offspring (starting from post-weaning) affect the levels of n-6 and n-3 fatty acids in phospholipids (PL) and lipid mediators in the hippocampus of mice.Pregnant mice were randomly assigned to consume either a deprived or an adequate n-6 PUFA diet during pregnancy and lactation (maternal exposure). On postnatal day (PND) 21, half of the male pups were weaned onto the same diet as their dams, and the other half were switched to the other diet for 9 weeks (offspring exposure). At PND 84, upon head-focused high- microwave irradiation, hippocampi were collected for PL fatty  and lipid mediator analyses. (ARA) concentrations were significantly decreased in both total PL and PL fractions, while eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) concentrations were increased only in PL fractions upon n-6 PUFA deprivation of offspring, regardless of maternal exposure. Several ARA-derived eicosanoids were reduced, while some of the EPA-derived eicosanoids were elevated by n-6 PUFA deprivation in offspring. There was no effect of diet on docosahexaenoic  (DHA) or DHA-derived docosanoids concentrations under either maternal or offspring exposure.These results indicate that the maternal exposure to dietary n-6 PUFA may not be as important as the offspring exposure in regulating hippocampal ARA and some lipid mediators.

Little attention has been given to the effects of these feeds on the essential fatty  status of children with SAM. The objective of this study was to describe changes in the PUFA composition in whole blood in children with SAM during treatment and to determine predictors of change. This prospective study took place in a paediatric nutrition rehabilitation unit in Kampala, Uganda, and assessed whole-blood fatty  composition of children with SAM at admission, transition, discharge and follow-up (8 and 16 weeks). ANCOVA was used to identify predictors of change in whole-blood PUFA. The study included 120 children with SAM and twenty-nine healthy control children of similar age and sex. Among the SAM children, 38 % were female and 64 % had oedema. Whole-blood n-6 PUFA proportions increased from admission to follow-up, except for , which decreased by 0·79 (95 % CI 0·46, 1·12) fatty  percentage (FA%) from admission to transition and 0·10 (95 % CI 0·23, 0·44) FA% at discharge. n-3 Long-chain (LC) PUFA decreased by 0·21 (95 % CI 0·03, 0·40) FA% at discharge and 0·22 (95 % CI 0·01, 0·42) FA% at 8 weeks of follow-up. This decrease was greater in children from families with recent fish intake and those with nasogastric tube feeding. Current therapeutic feeds do not correct whole-blood levels of LCPUFA, particularly n-3 LCPUFA, in children with SAM. Increased attention is needed to the contents of n-3 LCPUFA in therapeutic feeds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26912491>Maternal single nucleotide polymorphisms in the fatty  desaturase 1 and 2 coding regions modify the impact of prenatal supplementation with DHA on birth weight.</a></h2><p>Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the fatty  desaturase (FADS) gene affect the activity and efficiency of enzymes that are responsible for the conversion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) into their long-chain active form. A high prevalence of SNPs that are associated with slow PUFA conversion has been described in Hispanic populations.We assessed the heterogeneity of the effect of prenatal supplementation with docosahexaenoic  (DHA) on birth weight across selected FADS SNPs in a sample of Mexican women and their offspring.We obtained information on the maternal genotype from stored blood samples of 654 women who received supplementation with 400 mg DHA/d or a placebo from weeks 18 to 22 of gestation through delivery as part of a randomized controlled trial conducted in Cuernavaca, Mexico. We selected 4 tag SNPs (rs174455, rs174556, rs174602, and rs498793) in the FADS region for analysis. We used an ANOVA to test for the heterogeneity of the effect on birth weight across each of the 4 SNPs.The mean ± SD birth weight was 3210 ± 470 g, and the weight-for-age z score (WAZ) was -0.24 ± 1.00. There were no intention-to-treat differences in birth weights. We showed significant heterogeneity by SNP rs174602 (P= 0.02); offspring of carriers of alleles TT and TC in the intervention group were heavier than those in the placebo group (WAZ: -0.13 ± 0.14 and -0.20 ± 0.08 compared with -0.55 ± 0.15 and -0.39 ± 0.09, respectively); there were no significant differences in offspring of rs174602 CC homozygotes (WAZ: -0.26 ± 0.09 in the intervention group compared with -0.04 ± 0.09 in the placebo group). We showed no significant heterogeneity across the other 3 FADS SNPs.Differential responses to prenatal DHA supplementation on the basis of the genetic makeup of target populations could explain the mixed evidence of the impact of DHA supplementation on birth weight.

Cod filets contain less than 2g fat per kg, whereof approximately 50% is EPA and DHA. However, a large fraction of these n-3 PUFAs is present in the phospholipid (PL) fraction and may have high bioavailability and capacity to change the endocannabinoid profile. Here we investigated whether exchanging meat from a lean terrestrial animal with cod in a background Western diet would alter the endocannabinoid tone in mice and thereby attenuate obesity development and hepatic lipid accumulation. Accordingly, we prepared iso-caloric diets with 15.1  (e) % protein, 39.1 e% fat and 45.8 e% carbohydrates using freeze-dried meat from cod filets or pork sirloins, and using a combination of soybean oil, corn oil, margarine, milk fat, and lard as the fat source. Compared with mice receiving diets containing pork, mice fed cod gained less adipose tissue mass and had a lower content of hepatic lipids. This was accompanied by a lower n-6 to n-3 ratio in liver PLs and in red blood cells (RBCs) in the mice. Furthermore, mice receiving the cod-containing diet had lower circulating levels of the two major endocannabinoids, N-arachidonoylethanolamine and 2-arachidonoylglycerol. Together, our data demonstrate that despite the relatively low content of n-3 PUFAs in cod fillets, the cod-containing diet could exert beneficial metabolic effects.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether dietary thymol (a natural antioxidant) is related to changes in quail egg yolk total (T), triglyceride (TG) and phospholipid (PL) fatty  composition at different stages of embryo development. Thus female Japanese quail (100 days of age) were assigned to one of two dietary treatments (12 individuals each): CON (basal diet) or THY (0.0016 mol thymol day per bird). After 2 weeks of supplementation, eggs were incubated and samples were obtained at 0, 4 and 16 days of embryonic development.In 0 day THY eggs, α-linolenic  and n-3 PUFA in T and TG, docosahexaenoic  and PUFA in T and  in TG were increased, while saturated fatty acids (SFA) in T were reduced. From 4 days on, PUFA, n-3 PUFA and SFA from T and TG in THY eggs were found to be similar to those of CON eggs. The changes in PL throughout incubation were similar in both dietary treatments.Thymol would provide the embryo with PUFA for synthesis/deposition in membranes and/or assign to supply . Additionally, thymol supplementation would be advisable for the production of healthier table eggs. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28861449>Data of added-value lipid production, , among other lipids by , using low cost simulated wastewater.</a></h2><p>This article presented an innovative data of feasibility to produce  (ARA), as added-value Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFA), among other lipids from , using simulated low cost sugarcane wastewater, vinasse, as a carbon source.

The pathogenesis of stunting is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to identify altered metabolic pathways associated with child stunting. We measured 677 serum metabolites using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in a cross-sectional study of 400 Malawian children aged 12-59 mo, of whom 62% were stunted. A low height-for-age  score (HAZ) was associated with lower serum concentrations of ) ω-3 (n-3) and ω-6 (n-6) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), ) sulfated neurosteroids, which play a role in brain development, ) carnitine, a conditionally essential nutrient with an important role in the carnitine shuttle for the metabolism of fatty acids and  production, and ) γ-glutamyl amino acids, which represent an altered γ-glutamyl cycle of glutathione metabolism. A low HAZ was associated with significantly higher serum concentrations of 5 biomarkers related to cigarette smoke exposure. This metabolomics study shows a cross-sectional association between stunting and low serum ω-3 and ω-6 long-chain PUFAs, which are essential for growth and development; low sulfated neurosteroids, which play a role in brain development; low carnitine, which is essential for β-oxidation of fatty acids; alterations in glutathione metabolism; and increased serum metabolites that are associated with secondhand tobacco smoke exposure.

They mediate significant effects in the fine-tune adjustment of body homeostasis. Phyto- and synthetic cannabinoids also rule the daily life of billions worldwide, as they are involved in obesity, depression and drug addiction. Consequently, there is growing interest to reveal novel active compounds in this field. Cloning of cannabinoid receptors in the 90s and the identification of the endogenous mediators arachidonylethanolamide (anandamide, AEA) and 2-arachidonyglycerol (2-AG), led to the characterization of the endocannabinoid system (ECS), together with their metabolizing enzymes and membrane transporters. Today, the ECS is known to be involved in diverse functions such as appetite control, food intake,  balance, neuroprotection, neurodegenerative diseases, stroke, mood disorders, emesis, modulation of pain, inflammatory responses, as well as in cancer therapy. Western diet as well as restriction of micronutrients and fatty acids, such as DHA, could be related to altered production of pro-inflammatory mediators (e.g. eicosanoids) and ECs, contributing to the progression of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, depression or impairing conditions, such as Alzheimer' s disease. Here we review how diets based in PUFAs might be linked to ECS and to the maintenance of central and peripheral metabolism, brain plasticity, memory and learning, blood flow, and genesis of neural cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28587627>Analysis of the lipid body proteome of the oleaginous alga Lobosphaera incisa.</a></h2><p>Lobosphaera incisa (L. incisa) is an oleaginous microalga that stores triacylglycerol (TAG) rich in  in lipid bodies (LBs). This organelle is gaining attention in algal research, since evidence is accumulating that proteins attached to its surface fulfill important functions in TAG storage and metabolism.Here, the composition of the LB proteome in L incisa was investigated by comparing different cell fractions in a semiquantitative proteomics approach. After applying stringent filters to the proteomics data in order to remove contaminating proteins from the list of possible LB proteins (LBPs), heterologous expression of candidate proteins in tobacco pollen tubes, allowed us to confirm 3 true LBPs: A member of the algal Major Lipid Droplet Protein family, a small protein of unknown function and a putative lipase. In addition, a TAG lipase that belongs to the SUGAR DEPENDENT 1 family of TAG lipases known from oilseed plants was identified. Its activity was verified by functional complementation of an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant lacking the major seed TAG lipases.Here we describe 3 LBPs as well as a TAG lipase from the oleaginous microalga L. incisa and discuss their possible involvement in LB metabolism. This study highlights the importance of filtering LB proteome datasets and verifying the subcellular localization one by one, so that contaminating proteins can be recognized as such.

However, the molecular pathogenesis of COPD remains unknown. Here, we explored the molecular effects of cigarette smoke and bacterial infection in lung tissues of COPD rats. We also investigated therapeutic effects of aminophylline (APL) on the COPD rats and integrated transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome data for a global view of molecular mechanisms of COPD progression. Using molecular function and pathway analyses, the genes and proteins regulated in COPD and APL-treated rats were mainly attributed to oxidoreductase, antioxidant activity,  and fatty  metabolism. Furthermore, we identified hub proteins such as Gapdh (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), Pkm (pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2), and Sod1 (superoxide dismutase 1), included in  metabolism and oxidative stress. Then, we identified the significantly regulated metabolic pathways in lung tissues of COPD- and APL-treated rats, such as , linoleic , and α-linolenic  metabolism, which belong to the lipid metabolism. In particular, we picked the  metabolism for a more detailed pathway analysis of transcripts, proteins, and metabolites. We could observe an increase in metabolites and genes involved in  metabolism in COPD rats and the decrease in these in APL-treated rats, suggesting that inflammatory responses were up-regulated in COPD rats and down-regulated in APL-treated rats. In conclusion, these system-wide results suggested that COPD progression and its treatment might be associated with oxidative stress, lipid and  metabolism disturbance. Additionally, we demonstrated the power of integrated omics for the elucidation of genes, proteins, and metabolites' changes and disorders that were associated with COPD.© 2017 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27450951>Exposure pathway-dependent effects of the fungicide epoxiconazole on a decomposer-detritivore system.</a></h2><p>Shredders play a central role in the breakdown of leaf material in aquatic systems. These organisms and the ecological function they provide may, however, be affected by chemical stressors either as a consequence of direct waterborne exposure or through alterations in food-quality (indirect pathway). To unravel the biological relevance of these effect pathways, we applied a 2×2-factorial test design. Leaf material was microbially colonized for 10days in absence or presence of the fungicide epoxiconazole (15μg/L) and subsequently fed to the shredder Asellus aquaticus under exposure to epoxiconazole (15μg/L) or in fungicide-free medium over a 28-day period (n=40). Both effect pathways caused alterations in asselids' food processing, physiological fitness, and growth, although not always statistically significantly: assimilation either increased or remained at a similar level relative to the control suggesting compensatory behavior of A. aquaticus to cope with the enhanced  demand for detoxification processes and decreased nutritional quality of the food. The latter was driven by lowered microbial biomasses and the altered composition of fatty acids associated with the leaf material. Even with increased assimilation, direct and indirect effects caused decreases in the growth and lipid (fatty ) content of A. aquaticus with relative effect sizes between 10 and 40%. Moreover, the concentrations of two essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (i.e.,  and eicosapentaenoic ) were non-significantly reduced (up to ~15%) in asselids. This effect was, however, independent of the exposure pathway. Although waterborne effects were generally stronger than the diet-related effects, results suggest impaired functioning of A. aquaticus via both effect pathways.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

When breastfeeding is not possible, infant formulas are designed to mimic human milk as much as possible to fulfill infant's requirements. However, the composition of these dairy products is relatively constant, while human milk is not a uniform bio-fluid and changes according to the requirements of the baby. In this study, breast milk samples were donated by 24 Spanish mothers in different lactation stages and different infant formulas were purchased in supermarkets and pharmacies. Gas chromatography coupled to flame ionization detection was used for the fatty  determination. Compared to breast milk, first-stage formulas are apparently very similar in composition; however, no major differences were observed in the fatty  profiles between formulas of different lactation stages. The Galician women breast milk has a fatty  profile rich in oleic , linoleic , , and docosahexaenoic . When comparing human milk with formulas, it becomes evident that the manufacturers tend to enrich the formulas with essential fatty acids (especially with α-linolenic ), but  and docosahexaenoic  levels are lower than in breast milk.

Conversely, few data have been so far reported on fluorescing lipids. In this work we investigated the AF of liver lipid extracts from two fatty liver models, Wistar rats fed with MCD diet for 12 days (Wi-MCD), and obese (fa/fa) Zucker rats. Among the most abundant fatty acids in the lipid extracts, indicated by mass spectrometry,  (AA) exhibited higher quantum yield than the other fluorescing fatty acids (FLFA), and red shifted AF spectrum. This allowed to estimate the AA contribution to the overall emission of lipid extracts by curve fitting analysis. AA prevailed in obese Zucker livers, accounting for the different AF spectral profiles between the two models. AF and mass spectrometry indicated also a different balance between the fluorescing fraction and the overall amount of AA in the two models. The ability of AF to detect directly AA and FLFA was demonstrated, suggesting its supportive role as tool in wide-ranging applications, from the control of animal origin food, to experimental investigations on liver fat accumulation, lipotoxicity and disease progression, with potential translation to the clinics.© 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Comprehensive metabolite analysis may reveal the anaphylactoid effect mechanism systematically and provide reference for future diagnostic purposes.Plasma from Brown Norway rats given intravenous injection of saline, compound 48/80 (2.5 mL/kg) or ovalbumin (20 mL/kg) in 20 s for the first time was used to study the effect mechanism of anaphylactoid reactions through metabolomics (UPLC-qTOF-MS/MS). Metabolomics integrated with proteomics data were used to analyze the anaphylactoid pathways by MetaboAnalyst followed by integrated pathway analysis.Thirty metabolites were identified through the METLIN database by MS/MS and 18 of them were confirmed by authentic standards. The results showed that adenosine, histamine, N-acetylhistamine, N(α)-γ-glutamylhistamine, malate and xanthine are important indices for anaphylactoid reactions. It could be concluded that the effect mechanism is mainly composed of histidine metabolism,  metabolism,  metabolism, purine metabolism and other small molecules through 30 metabolites. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that not only histamine but also N(α)-γ-glutamylhistamine and  could be used to evaluate anaphylactoid symptoms of animals.

However, information regarding the pharmacodyamic material basis and potential mechanism remain unknown. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups: Sham, Model, Diltiazem, and SM-DOO group, n = 6. Rats were pretreated with homologous drugs for 7 days, and then subjected to 30 minutes of ischemia followed by 180 minutes of reperfusion. Cardioprotection effects of SM-DOO on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury rats were examined by hemodynamics, infarct area, histopathology, biochemical indicators, and Western blot analysis. Metabonomics technology was further performed to evaluate the endogenous metabolites profiling systematically. According to the results of pattern recognition analysis, a clear separation of MI/R injury in the Model group and Sham group was achieved and SM-DOO pretreatment group was located much closer to the Sham group than the Model group, which was consistent with results of biochemistry and histopathological assay. Moreover, potential biomarkers were identified to elucidate the drug mechanism of SM-DOO, which may be related with pathways of  metabolism, especially tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle (citric ) and β-oxidation of fatty acids (3-hydroxybutyric, palmitoleic , heptadecanoic , and ). In addition, the protein expressions of p-AMPK and p-ACC in the SM-DOO group were significantly elevated, while the levels of carnitine palmitoyl-CoA transferase-1 (CPT-1), p-PDK, and p-PDC were dramatically reduced by SM-DOO. In conclusion, SM-DOO pretreatment could ameliorate MI/R injury by intervening with  metabolism, especially TCA cycle and β-oxidation of fatty acids.

In this study, we discovered migrant-resident interactions and substantial cross-system lipid transportation in the transition zone between the Baltic Sea and the North Sea where a resident cod population (predators) was found to interact with a herring population (prey) on a seasonal basis. We traced the lipids, using fatty  trophic markers (FATM), from the herring feeding grounds in the North Sea to the cod livers in the Western Baltic Sea. Time series analysis of population dynamics indicated that population-level production of cod is positively affected by the herring subsidies. However, the underlying mechanisms were more complicated than anticipated. During the herring season, large cod received most of its dietary lipids from the herring, whereas smaller cod were prevented from accessing the lipid pool due to a mismatch in predator-prey size ratio. Furthermore, while the herring were extremely rich in bulk , they were surprisingly poor in a specific functional fatty . Hence, our study was the first to illustrate how the magnitude cross-system fluxes of subsidies in migrant-resident systems are potentially constrained by the size structure of the resident predator population and the nutritional quality of the migrants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27378459>The physicochemical properties of membranes correlate with the NADPH oxidase activity.</a></h2><p>Phagocytes kill ingested microbes by exposure to high concentrations of toxic reactive species generated by NADPH-oxidases. This membrane-bound electron-transferring enzyme is tightly regulated by cellular signaling cascades. So far, molecular and biophysical studies of the NADPH-oxidase were performed over limited temperature ranges, which weaken our understanding of immune response or inflammatory events. In this work, we have inspected the influence of temperature and lipid membrane properties on the NADPH-oxidase activity using a system free of cell complexity.We have extended the experimental conditions of the accepted model for NADPH-oxidase activity, the so-called cell-free assay, to a large temperature range (10-40°C) using different membrane compositions (subcellular compartments or liposomes).A remarkable increase of superoxide production rate was observed with rising temperature. Synchrotron radiation circular dichroism data showed that this is not correlated with protein secondary structure changes. When lipid bilayers are in fluid phase, Arrhenius plots of the oxidase activity showed linear relationships with small activation  (Ea), while when in solid phase, high Ea was found. The sterol content modulates kinetic and thermodynamic parameters.High temperature promotes the rate of superoxide production. The key element of this enhancement is related to membrane properties such as thickness and viscosity and not to protein structural changes. Membrane viscosity that can be driven by sterols is a paramount parameter of Ea of NADPH oxidase activity. The membrane bilayer state modulated by its sterol content may be considered locally as an enzyme regulator.

Long-chain polyunsaturated FAs (LC-PUFAs) are pivotal in brain and visual development. It is of interest to investigate whether and how specific pregnancy conditions, which alter fatty  metabolism (excessive pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) or gestational weight gain (GWG)), affect lipid supply to the foetus. For this purpose, we evaluated the erythrocyte FAs of mothers and offspring (cord-blood) at birth, in relation to pre-pregnancy BMI and GWG. A total of 435 mothers and their offspring (237 males, 51%) were included in the study. Distribution of linoleic  (LA) and α-linolenic  (ALA), and their metabolites, , dihomogamma linoleic (DGLA) and ecosapentanoic , was significantly different in maternal and foetal erythrocytes. Pre-pregnancy BMI was significantly associated with maternal percentage of MUFAs (Coeff: -0.112; p = 0.021), LA (Coeff: -0.033; p = 0.044) and DHA (Coeff. = 0.055; p = 0.0016); inadequate GWG with DPA (Coeff: 0.637; p = 0.001); excessive GWG with docosaexahenoic  (DHA) (Coeff. = -0.714; p = 0.004).

Here, we describe, to our best knowledge, the first characterisation of a cDNA encoding a LOX (LiLOX) from a green alga. To obtain first insights into its function, we expressed it in E. coli, purified the recombinant enzyme and analysed its enzyme activity. The protein sequence suggests that LiLOX and plastidic LOXs from bryophytes and flowering plants may share a common ancestor. The fact that LiLOX oxidises all PUFAs tested with a consistent oxidation on the carbon n-6, suggests that PUFAs enter the substrate channel through their methyl group first (tail first). Additionally, LiLOX form the fatty  hydroperoxide in strict S configuration. LiLOX may represent a good model to study plastid LOX, because it is stable after heterologous expression in E. coli and highly active in vitro. Moreover, as the first characterised LOX from green microalgae, it opens the possibility to study endogenous LOX pathways in these organisms.© 2018 The Authors.

Our HPLC method achieved separation of these oxidized species from their unoxidized counterparts while maintaining regioisomer-independent elution, allowing quantification over a 5 log range with a lower limit of quantification of 0.1 picomoles. With a simple sample preparation and a runtime as low as 11 minutes, our method allows the rapid and facile detection and measurement of full-length oxFA in biological samples. We believe this approach will allow for new insight and further investigation into the role of oxFA in metabolic disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27517158>Biological relevance of fatty acyl heterogeneity to the neural membrane dynamics of rhesus macaques during normative aging.</a></h2><p>Lipidomic analyses of the frontal cortex of Rhesus macaques across three selected age groups (young, sexually-mature, old) revealed that docosahexaenoic acids (DHAs) displayed notable and unique accretions in sexually-mature macaques for all phospholipid classes examined, which were not observable in all remaining polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) investigated. On the other hand,  (ARA) exhibited sharp attritions in the membrane lipidomes of sexually-mature macaques, a decline which was attenuated only for cardiolipins (CLs). DHA enrichment in phospholipids was lost in old macaques, with accompanying augmentations in very-long-chain sphingomyelins (VLC-SMs). Age-dependent alterations in membrane lipidomes point to a possibly complex temporal interplay between DHA-enriched membrane microdomains and SM-/cholesterol-rich rafts in neural membranes during normative aging. Lipid co-regulation data revealed an increasingly intense degree of co-regulation between membrane lipid classes with age, and suggest that reduction in CLs during normative brain aging may prompt alternative membrane lipid synthetic pathways driven by a compromised  availability in the aging brain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28485254>High dietary  levels induce changes in complex lipids and immune-related eicosanoids and increase levels of oxidised metabolites in zebrafish (Danio rerio).</a></h2><p>This study explores the effect of high dietary  (ARA) levels (high ARA) compared with low dietary ARA levels (control) on the general metabolism using zebrafish as the model organism. The fatty  composition of today's 'modern diet' tends towards higher n-6 PUFA levels in relation to n-3 PUFA. Low dietary n-3:n-6 PUFA ratio is a health concern, as n-6 PUFA give rise to eicosanoids and PG, which are traditionally considered pro-inflammatory, especially when derived from ARA. Juvenile zebrafish fed a high-ARA diet for 17 d had a lower whole-body n-3:n-6 PUFA ratio compared with zebrafish fed a low-ARA (control) diet (0·6 in the control group v. 0·2 in the high-ARA group). Metabolic profiling revealed altered levels of eicosanoids, PUFA, dicarboxylic acids and complex lipids such as glycerophospholipids and lysophospholipids as the most significant differences compared with the control group. ARA-derived hydroxylated eicosanoids, such as hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acids, were elevated in response to high-ARA feed. In addition, increased levels of oxidised lipids and amino acids indicated an oxidised environment due to n-6 PUFA excess in the fish. To conclude, our results indicate that an ARA-enriched diet induces changes in complex lipids and immune-related eicosanoids and increases levels of oxidised lipids and amino acids, suggesting oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31488836>Gut microbiota confers host resistance to obesity by metabolizing dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids.</a></h2><p>Gut microbiota mediates the effects of diet, thereby modifying host metabolism and the incidence of metabolic disorders. Increased consumption of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) that is abundant in Western diet contributes to obesity and related diseases. Although gut-microbiota-related metabolic pathways of dietary PUFAs were recently elucidated, the effects on host physiological function remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that gut microbiota confers host resistance to high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity by modulating dietary PUFAs metabolism. Supplementation of 10-hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic  (HYA), an initial linoleic -related gut-microbial metabolite, attenuates HFD-induced obesity in mice without eliciting -mediated adipose inflammation and by improving metabolic condition via free fatty  receptors. Moreover, Lactobacillus-colonized mice show similar effects with elevated HYA levels. Our findings illustrate the interplay between gut microbiota and host  metabolism via the metabolites of dietary omega-6-FAs thereby shedding light on the prevention and treatment of metabolic disorders by targeting gut microbial metabolites.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31609374>Exploring the effects of Gastrodia elata Blume on the treatment of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury using UPLC-Q/TOF-MS-based plasma metabolomics.</a></h2><p>Gastrodia elata Blume (Orchidaceae, GEB) is a medicinal plant that has been widely used in the treatment of cerebrovascular disease. This study explored the protective effects of GEB against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion using Information-Dependent Acquisition (IDA)-mediated UPLC-Q/TOF-MS-based plasma metabolomics. Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury was induced in male Wistar rats using the Zea Longa method. Biochemical and histological assays were performed to evaluate the therapeutic effects of GEB on IR rats. We found that the neurobehavioral scores and infarction areas of GEB and nimodipine treated groups were dramatically lower than those of the IR groups. Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) staining and TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) showed that GEB significantly improved neuronal injury and prevented neuronal apoptosis. Biochemical analysis revealed that GEB prevented cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by regulating inflammation and oxidative injury. Through ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry-metabolomics-based approaches, 43 plasma metabolites related to GEB treatment were detected, 6 of which significantly differed (p < 0.05) between the model and GEB groups. The levels of l-histidine, sphinganine, thymine, spermidine and deoxycytidine in the IR group were significantly higher than those in the sham group, but decreased following GEB treatment.  levels were lower in the IR group, but dramatically increased in response to GEB. Pharmacodynamics and metabolomics confirmed that the mechanism of GEB in the treatment of cerebral ischemia was not only related to the reduction of inflammation, oxidation, neurotoxicity, and apoptosis, but also mediated through  metabolism, histidine metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, and glycerophospholipid metabolism in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28854910>Expression of Vitreoscilla hemoglobin enhances production of  and lipids in Mortierella alpina.</a></h2><p> (ARA, C20:4, n-6), which belongs to the omega-6 series of polyunsaturated fatty acids and has a variety of biological activities, is commercially produced in Mortierella alpina. Dissolved oxygen or oxygen utilization efficiency is a critical factor for Mortierella alpina growth and  production in large-scale fermentation. Overexpression of the Vitreoscilla hemoglobin gene is thought to significantly increase the oxygen utilization efficiency of the cells.An optimized Vitreoscilla hemoglobin (VHb) gene was introduced into Mortierella alpina via Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Compared with the parent strain, the VHb-expressing strain, termed VHb-20, grew faster under both limiting and non-limiting oxygen conditions and exhibited dramatic changes in cell morphology. Furthermore, VHb-20 produced 4- and 8-fold higher total lipid and ARA yields than those of the wild-type strain under a microaerobic environment. Furthermore, ARA production of VHb-20 was also 1.6-fold higher than that of the wild type under normal conditions. The results demonstrated that DO utilization was significantly increased by expressing the VHb gene in Mortierella alpina.The expression of VHb enhances ARA and lipid production under both lower and normal dissolved oxygen conditions. This study provides a novel strategy and an engineered strain for the cost-efficient production of ARA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29958393>The Impact of Maternal Diet during Pregnancy and Lactation on the Fatty  Composition of Erythrocytes and Breast Milk of Chilean Women.</a></h2><p>Maternal diet during pregnancy is relevant for fatty  supply during fetal life and lactation.  (AA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids are also relevant for the normal growth and development of brain and visual system. AA and DHA provided by the mother to the fetus and infant are directly associated with maternal dietary intake and body stores. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of maternal diet, specially referring to the quality of fatty  intake, in a sample of Chilean women during last stage of pregnancy and across the lactation period. Fifty healthy pregnant women (age range 20⁻33 years) were studied from the 6th month of pregnancy and followed until 6th month of lactation period. Diet characteristics were evaluated through food frequency questionnaires. Fatty acids composition of erythrocyte phospholipids and breast milk samples was assessed by gas-liquid chromatography. Overall, women had high saturated fatty acids intake with sufficient intake of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Diet was high in -6 PUFA and low in -3 PUFA (mainly DHA), with imbalanced -6/-3 PUFA ratio. Erythrocytes and breast milk DHA concentration was significantly reduced during lactation compared to pregnancy, a pattern not observed for AA. We concluded that is necessary to increase the intake of -3 PUFA during pregnancy and lactation by improving the quality of consumed foods with particular emphasis on its DHA content.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28601515>Repeated pulse exposures to lambda-cyhalothrin affect the behavior, physiology, and survival of the damselfly larvae Ischnura graellsii (Insecta; Odonata).</a></h2><p>Damselflies form an essential part of the aquatic and terrestrial food web. Pesticides may, however, negatively affect their behavior, physiology, and survival. To assess this, a 42-day-lasting bioassay was conducted, during which damselfly larvae (Ischnura graellsii; n = 20) were repeatedly exposed to lambda-cyhalothrin (3 days at; 0, 10, 50, 250, 1250, and 6250ng LCH L), followed by recovery phases (4 days) in pesticide-free medium for six weeks. This exposure design was used to simulate frequent runoff events in the field. Variables related to the behavior (strikes against prey and capture success), growth, physiology (lipid content and fatty  composition), as well as mortality were assessed throughout the experiment. The two highest LCH concentrations induced 100% mortality within the first 48h, whereas 85% of the test organisms survived 28 days under control conditions. The number of strikes against prey was not affected by LCH. In contrast, prey capture success decreased significantly (up to ~50% at 250ng LCH L, for instance, after the third pulse exposure) following LCH-exposures compared to the control. This difference was not observed after recovery phases, however, which did not counteract the enhanced  demand for detoxification and defense mechanisms indicated by a lower growth rate (up to ~20%) and lipid content (up to ~30%) of damselflies at 50 and 250ng LCH L. In addition, two essential fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic  and ) and two precursors (linolenic  and α-linolenic ) decreased in their concentrations upon exposure towards 250ng LCH L. Thus the results of this study indicate that long-term exposure towards LCH pulses can affect damselfly behavior, physiology and survival. Given the essential role of damselflies in food web dynamics, these effects may potentially translate into local population impairments with subsequent bottom-up directed effects within and across ecosystem boundaries.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The up-regulation of cloacal temperature confirmed that our experiment was successful in inducing chronic heat stress. The average daily gain and average daily feed intake of the HS group were significantly lower than those of the NC group, by 28·76 and 18·42 %, respectively (P1 and P<0·05). The greater feed:gain ratio of the HS group was significantly positively correlated with the leg, abdominal fat, subcutaneous fat and intramuscular fat proportions and levels of some free amino acids (proline, l-cysteine, methionine and threonine) but was negatively correlated with breast proportion and levels of some NEFA (stearic , , palmitic  and oleic ). These findings indicated that the heat-stressed broilers were in negative  balance and unable to effectively mobilise fat, thereby resulting in protein decomposition, which subsequently affected growth performance and carcass characteristics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29017947>Integrated profiling of global metabolomic and transcriptomic responses to viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus infection in olive flounder.</a></h2><p>Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) is one of the most serious viral pathogen that infects farmed fish. In this study, we measured the replication of VHSV increased steadily at 9, 24, 72, and 120 h after infection and progression of necrosis was observed at 72 hpi. We performed transcriptomic and metabolomics profiling of kidney tissues collected at each infection time using Illumina HiSeq2000 and ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectroscopy to investigate the mechanisms of VHSV infection in the kidneys of olive flounder. A total of 13,862 mRNA molecules and 72 metabolites were selected to identify the mechanisms of infection and they were integrated using KEGG pathway database. Six KEGG metabolic pathways, including carbohydrate metabolism, amino  metabolism, lipid metabolism, transport and catabolism, metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, and  metabolism, were significantly suppressed, whereas the immune system was activated by VHSV infection. A decrease in levels of amino acids such as valine, leucine, and isoleucine, as well as in their derivative carnitines, was observed after VHSV infection. In addition, an increase in  level was noted. Integrated analysis of transcriptome and metabolome using KEGG pathway database revealed four types of responses in the kidneys of olive flounder to VHSV infection. Among these, the mechanisms related to the immune system and protein synthesis were activated, whereas ATP synthesis and the antioxidant system activity were suppressed. This is the first study describing the mechanisms of metabolic responses to VHSV infection in olive flounder. The results suggest that the suppression of ATP synthesis and antioxidant systems, such as glutathione and peroxisome signaling, could be the cause of necrosis, whereas the activation of the immune system could result in the inflammation of kidney tissue in VHSV-infected olive flounder.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast, under phosphorous (P) deprivation, the production of the monounsaturated oleic  prevails. We compared physiological responses, ultrastructural, and metabolic consequences of L. incisa acclimation to N and P deficiency to provide novel insights into the key determinants of ARA accumulation. Differential responses to nutrient deprivation on growth performance, carbon-to-nitrogen stoichiometry, membrane lipid composition and TAG accumulation were demonstrated. Ultrastructural analyses suggested a dynamic role for vacuoles in sustaining cell homeostasis under conditions of different nutrient availability and their involvement in autophagy in L. incisa. Paralleling ARA-rich TAG accumulation in lipid droplets, N deprivation triggered intensive chloroplast dismantling and promoted catabolic processes. Metabolome analysis revealed depletion of amino acids and pyrimidines, and repression of numerous biosynthetic hubs to favour TAG biosynthesis under N deprivation. Under P deprivation, despite the relatively low growth penalties, the presence of the endogenous P reserves and the characteristic lipid remodelling, metabolic signatures of  deficiency were revealed. Metabolome adjustments to P deprivation included depletion in ATP and phosphorylated nucleotides, increased levels of TCA-cycle intermediates and osmoprotectants. We conclude that characteristic cellular and metabolome adjustments tailor the adaptive responses of L. incisa to N and P deprivation modulating its LC-PUFA production.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Different temperatures (25, 30, and 35 °C) and light intensities (70, 165, and 280 μmol/ms) were applied to the 50 L pilot-scale cultivation of P. purpureum in ASW. The cultivation under the light intensity of 280 μmol/ms at 35 °C obtained biomass concentration up to 9.52 g/L, total fatty  content to 56.82 mg/g, and ARA content to 22.29 mg/g. While the maximum EPA content of 7.00 mg/g was achieved under the light intensity of 280 μmol/ms at 25 °C and the highest ratio of UFAs to TFAs of 74.66% was also obtained in this trial. Both biomass concentration and TFAs content were improved by increasing light intensity and temperature. Moreover, the ratio of ARA to EPA was enhanced by increasing cultivation temperature under the light intensity of 280 μmol/ms. In contrast with flask culture, the conversion of linoleic  (C18:2) to ARA was enhanced in scale-up culture, leading to more ARA content.

However, AML is a heterogeneous disease, and we therefore investigated possible associations between cellular metabolism and sensitivity to PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway inhibitors. We performed non-targeted metabolite profiling to compare the metabolome differences of primary human AML cells derived from patients susceptible or resistant to the in vitro antiproliferative effects of mTOR and PI3K inhibitors. In addition, the phosphorylation status of 18 proteins involved in PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling and the effect of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin on their phosphorylation status was investigated by flow cytometry. Strong antiproliferative effects by inhibitors were observed only for a subset of patients. We compared the metabolite profiles for responders and non-responders towards PI3K-mTOR inhibitors, and 627 metabolites could be detected. Of these metabolites, 128 were annotated and 15 of the annotated metabolites differed significantly between responders and non-responders, including metabolites involved in , amino , and lipid metabolism. To conclude, leukemia cells that are susceptible or resistant to PI3K-Akt-mTOR inhibitors differ in , amino , and  metabolism, and modulation of  metabolism alters the activation of mTOR and its downstream mediators.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29359676>Computational Exploration of Natural Compounds to Target Cytosolic Phospholipase A 2 Protein: A Novel Therapeutic Target for Spinal Cord Injury.</a></h2><p>Cytosolic Phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), an important isoform of PLA2 that mediates the release of , plays a role in the pathogenesis of Spinal Cord Injury (SCI). The expression and activation of Cpla2 are significantly higher in SCI, leading to neuronal death in spinal cord tissue. Novel strategies are needed to substantially reverse the effect of cPLA2 activation; one such strategy is inhibiting cPLA2 by jamming its lipid binding C2 domain.To develop a much needed strategy to treat SCI, we used a Computer Aided Drug Design (CADD) method to discover novel cPLA2 inhibitors.we used a natural chemiome database for virtual screening, from which we selected the compounds exhibiting the greatest drug-likeliness properties for molecular docking simulation analysis.We studied the interaction of lead compounds at the atomic level; the results yielded a cPLA2 inhibitor of natural origin with the potential for ameliorating secondary tissue damage and promoting recovery of function after SCI. The top compound, lead 4exibited a binding  of -10.02 Kcal/mol and formed three hydrogen bonds with the lipid binding C2 domain of the cPLA2 protein. An evaluation of cell cytotoxicity revealed an IC50 for lead4 of 134.2 ± 6.8 µM. An in-vitro analysis of lead4 is indicated anti-apoptotic activity via a decrease in caspase-3 expression.We used the CADD method to make a novel lead discovery for the treatment of SCI using compounds of natural origin.

Overweight and obesity development is for most individuals the result of years of positive  balance. Evidence from intervention trials and animal studies suggests that frequent intake of lean seafood, as compared with intake of terrestrial meats, reduces  intake by 4-9 %, sufficient to prevent a positive  balance and obesity. At equal  intake, lean seafood reduces fasting and postprandial risk markers of insulin resistance, and improves insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant adults.  restriction combined with intake of lean and fatty seafood seems to increase weight loss. Marine n-3 PUFA are probably of importance through n-3 PUFA-derived lipid mediators such as endocannabinoids and oxylipins, but other constituents of seafood such as the fish protein per se, trace elements or vitamins also seem to play a largely neglected role. A high intake of fatty seafood increases circulating levels of the insulin-sensitising hormone adiponectin. As compared with a high meat intake, high intake of seafood has been reported to reduce plasma levels of the hepatic acute-phase protein C-reactive protein level in some, but not all studies. More studies are needed to confirm the dietary effects on  intake, obesity and insulin resistance. Future studies should be designed to elucidate the potential contribution of trace elements, vitamins and undesirables present in seafood, and we argue that stratification into responders and non-responders in randomised controlled trials may improve the understanding of health effects from intake of seafood.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480258>LC-MS Analysis of Serum for the Metabolomic Investigation of the Effects of Pulchinenoside b4 Administration in Monosodium Urate Crystal-Induced Gouty Arthritis Rat Model.</a></h2><p>Gouty arthritis (GA) is commonly caused by deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals within the joint capsule, bursa, cartilage, bone, or other periarticular tissues after chronic hyperuricemia.

In both cases, some lipid molecules can be involved as signaling agents in the regulation of metabolism and protective or damaging pathways in responses to harmful stimuli.

Lipids have been demonstrated to fluoresce, contributing to the overall emission signal of the liver tissue along with other endogenous fluorophores, relatable to  metabolism and oxidative events. The mere estimation of the fluorescing lipid fraction in parallel with the other endogenous fluorophores, and with the common biochemical and histochemical biomarkers of tissue injury has been exploited to investigate the liver morpho-functional conditions in experimental hepatology. More interestingly, the fluorescing lipid fraction is greatly relatable to free fatty acids such as , linoleic and linolenic , which are deserving increasing attention as precursors of products involved in several and complex signaling pathways. On these bases, the ability of autofluorescence to detect directly  and its balance with other unsaturated fatty acids may be exploited in the diagnosis and follow-up of fatty livers, helping to improve the personalization of the metabolic/lipidomic profiling.

Individual and total SFAs, MUFAs, and n-3 and n-6 PUFAs were analyzed using SD scores and principal component analysis (PCA). Maternal diet, sociodemographic, health, and environmental factors were self-reported. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms were assessed in the fatty  desaturase 1 (FADS1-rs174556) and 2 (FADS2-rs174575) genes.Fatty  profiles were variable, with individual fatty  proportions varying from 2- to >30-fold between women. Using PCA, we identified 4 milk fatty  patterns: "MUFA and low SFA," "high n-6 PUFA," "high n-3 PUFA," and "high medium-chain fatty acids." In multivariable-adjusted analyses, fish oil supplementation and fatty cold water fish intake were positively associated with DHA and the "high n-3 PUFA" pattern.

Independent of selected dietary variables and genetic variants, Asian ethnicity was associated with higher linoleic  (18:2n-6) and total n-3 PUFAs. Ethnic differences in ARA were explained by FADS1 genotype. Maternal obesity was independently associated with higher total SFAs, the "high medium-chain fatty " pattern, and lower total MUFAs. Lactation stage, season, study site, and maternal education were also independently associated with some milk fatty acids. No associations were observed for maternal age, parity, delivery mode, or infant sex.This study provides unique insights about the "normal" variation in the composition of human milk fatty acids and the contributing dietary, genetic, sociodemographic, health, and environmental factors.

It was shown that St-T1b cells express CB1, but not CB2, and that both receptors are expressed in HdF cells. Furthermore, the expression of fatty  amide hydrolase (FAAH), the main degrading enzyme of AEA, increased during stromal cell differentiation. AEA inhibited cell proliferation, through deregulation of cell cycle progression and induced polyploidy. Moreover, through CB1 binding receptor, AEA also impaired cell differentiation. Therefore, AEA is proposed as a modulator of human decidualization. Our findings may provide wider implications, as deregulated levels of AEA, due to Cannabis sativa consumption or altered expression of the metabolic enzymes, may negatively regulate human endometrial stromal cell decidualization with an impact on human (in)fertility.Free Portuguese abstract: A Portuguese translation of this abstract is freely available at http://www.reproduction-online.org/content/152/4/351/suppl/DC1.© 2016 Society for Reproduction and Fertility.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29863274>Therapeutic potential of benfotiamine and its molecular targets.</a></h2><p>The water-soluble vitamin, thiamine forms an important part of the diet because of its role in the  metabolism. The protective effects of thiamine against diabetic vascular complications have been well documented. However, slower absorption and reduced bioavailability is a major limiting factor for its clinical use. To overcome this issue, lipid-soluble derivatives of thiamine (allithiamines) was developed. Among the many synthetic lipophilic derivatives of thiamine, benfotiamine (BFT) is regarded as the first choice based on its safety and clinical efficacy data. BFT facilitates the action of thiamine diphosphate, a cofactor for the enzyme transketolase. The activation of transketolase enzyme accelerates the precursors of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) towards the pentose phosphate pathway thereby reducing the production of AGEs. The reduction in AGEs subsequently decreases metabolic stress which benefits vascular complications seen in diabetes. The effects of BFT on the AGE-dependent pathway is well established. However, several studies have shown that BFT also modulates pathways other than AGE such as  (AA), nuclear transcription Factor κB (NF-κβ), protein kinase B, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) signaling pathways. In the present review, we have comprehensively reviewed all the molecular targets modulated by BFT to provide mechanistic perspective to highlight its pleiotropic effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28222923>Consumption of aquaculture waste affects the fatty  metabolism of a benthic invertebrate.</a></h2><p>Trophic subsidies can drive widespread ecological change, thus knowledge of how keystone species respond to subsidies is important. Aquaculture of large carnivorous fish generates substantial waste as faeces and lost feed, providing a food source to mobile benthic invertebrates. We used a controlled feeding study combined with a field survey to better understand the interaction between salmon aquaculture and the sea urchin, Echinus acutus, a dominant mobile invertebrate in Norwegian fjords. We tested if diets affected urchin fatty  composition by feeding them one of three diet treatments ("aquafeed", "composite" and "natural") for 10weeks. To test if proximity to fish farms altered E. acutus fatty  composition, populations were sampled at 10 locations in Hardangerfjord and Masfjord (Western Norway) from directly adjacent and up to 12km from farms. Fatty acids were measured in gonads and eggs in the diet experiment and in gonads and gut contents from wild animals. Urchins directly assimilated aquaculture waste at farm sites, as evidenced by elevated linoleic  (LA), oleic  (OA) and ∑LA, OA in their tissues. The diet experiment highlighted the biosynthetic and selective dietary sparing capacity of E. acutus in both gonads and eggs, with evidence for the elongation and desaturation of eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and  (ARA) from C fatty  precursors. Elevated biosynthesis of non-methylene interrupted (NMI) fatty acids, in particular 20:3Δ7,11,14 and 20:2 Δ5,11, were also linked to a high C fatty , low ≥C long-chain polyunsaturated fatty  (LC-PUFA) diet. Fatty  composition of gonads of wild urchins indicated a highly variable diet. The study indicates that the generalist feeding ecology of E. acutus, coupled with extensive biosynthetic capacity, enables it to exploit aquaculture waste as an -rich trophic subsidy.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The brief rationale is based on an explicit, widespread misapplication of the concept of "essential fatty acids" to linoleic  that implies it is uniquely required as a nutrient per se. Linoleic  prevents acute clinical symptoms caused by polyunsaturated fatty -deficient diets and is the major precursor for ARA in most human diets. Experimental diets with ARA as the sole n-6 similarly prevent symptoms but at a lower  percentage than linoleic  and show ARA is a precursor for linoleic . The absence of consistent evidence of ARA benefit from randomized controlled trials is apparently an issue as well. This review highlights basic and clinical research relevant to ARA requirements as an adjunct to DHA in infancy. ARA is a major structural central nervous system component, where it rapidly accumulates perinatally and is required for signaling. Tracer studies show that ARA-fed infants derive about half of their total body ARA from dietary preformed ARA. Clinically, of the 3 cohorts of term infants studied with designs isolating the effects of ARA (DHA-only vs DHA+ARA), none considered ARA-specific outcomes such as vascular or immune function; the study with the highest ARA level showed significant neurocognitive benefit. All breastfed term infants of adequately nourished mothers consume both DHA and ARA. The burden of proof to substantially deviate from the composition of breastmilk is greater than that available from inherently empirical human randomized controlled trial evidence. Infant formulas with DHA but without ARA risk harm from suppression of ARA-mediated metabolism manifest among the many unstudied functions of ARA.© The Author(s) 2016.

The present study aimed to adjust culture nitrogen concentrations to produce  biomass rich in B-PE, LC-PUFAs and EPS.  SCS-02 was cultured in ASW culture medium with low nitrogen supply (LN, 3.5 mM), medium nitrogen supply (MN, 5.9 mM) or high nitrogen supply (HN, 17.6 mM). HN significantly enhanced the accumulation of biomass, intracellular protein, B-PE and eicosapentaenoic . LN increased the intracellular carbohydrate and  content, and promoted the secretion of EPS. The total lipids content was almost unaffected by nitrogen concentration. Based on these results, a semi-continuous two-step process was proposed, which included the production of biomass rich in B-PE and LC-PUFAs with sufficient nitrogen, and induced EPS excretion with limited nitrogen and strong light.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28743125>Surfactant Protein B Suppresses Lung Cancer Progression by Inhibiting Secretory Phospholipase A2 Activity and  Production.</a></h2><p>Radiotherapy is applied to patients with inoperable cancer types including advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and radioresistance functions as a critical obstacle in radiotherapy. This study was aimed to investigate the mechanism of radioresistance regulated by surfactant protein B (SP-B).To investigate the role of SP-B in radioresistance, ΔSFTPB A549 cell line was established and SP-B expression was analyzed. In response to ionizing radiation (IR), the change of SP-B expression was analyzed in A549 and NCI-H441 cell lines. Conditioned media (CM) from NSCLC cells were utilized to evaluate the downstream signaling pathway. The in vivo effects of SP-B were assessed through mouse xenograft model with intratumoral injection of CM.In response to IR, NSCLC cell lines showed decreased SP-B regulated by the TGF-β signaling and decreased SP-B stimulated cell survival and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Treatment with CM from irradiated cells activated sPLA2, enhanced protein kinase Cδ-MAPKs signaling pathway, and increased  production. We confirmed the in vivo roles of SP-B through mouse xenograft model.Our results revealed that down-regulation of SP-B was involved in the radiation-induced metastatic conversion of NSCLC and provided evidence that SP-B acted as a suppressor of NSCLC progression.© 2017 The Author(s).

Among mammalian ALOX15 orthologs there are  12- and 15-lipoxygenating enzymes and recent studies suggested an evolutionary switch in that reaction specificity during late primate development. Previous reports showed that 12-lipoxygenating ALOX15 orthologs can be converted to 15-lipoxygenating enzymes by site-directed mutagenesis of some sequence determinants. Unfortunately, the molecular basis for those alterations are not well understood. Here, the  12-lipoxygenating N-terminal truncation variant of pig ALOX15, for which a crystal structure is available, was used to explore the catalytic mechanism of the specificity switch induced by mutagenesis of Val418 and Val419 sequence determinants. We found that Val418Ile+Val419Met double mutant is dominantly 15-lipoxygenating. Docking and MD simulations, and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations indicated that the wildtype  barrier for  15-lipoxygenation is 3.4 kcal mol higher than for 12-lipoxygenation. In contrast, for the Val418Ile+Val419Met double mutant the  barrier for 12-lipoxygenation is 6.0 kcal mol higher than for 15-lipoxygenation. Our data suggest that enzyme-substrate complex geometries determine the value of these  barriers and, as a consequence, the reaction specificity of ALOX15 orthologs.© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In captivity, they are known to suffer from a range of chronic non-infectious diseases. Although low heterozygosity and the stress of captivity have been suggested as possible causal factors, recent studies have started to focus on the contribution of potential dietary factors in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Fatty acids are an important component of the diet, not only providing a source of metabolisable , but serving other important functions in hormone production, cellular signalling as well as providing structural components in biological membranes. To develop a better understanding of lipid metabolism in cheetahs, we compared the total serum fatty  profiles of 35 captive cheetahs to those of 43 free-ranging individuals in Namibia using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The unsaturated fatty  concentrations differed most remarkably between the groups, with all of the polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, except  and hypogeic , detected at significantly lower concentrations in the serum of the free-ranging animals. The influence of age and sex on the individual fatty  concentrations was less notable. This study represents the first evaluation of the serum fatty acids of free-ranging cheetahs, providing critical information on the normal fatty  profiles of free-living, healthy individuals of this species. The results raise several important questions about the potential impact of dietary fatty  composition on the health of cheetahs in captivity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27522709>[Influence of Fatty Acids on Oxygen Consumption in Isolated Cardiomyocytes of Rats with Ischemic or Diabetic Heart Disease].</a></h2><p>one of the reasons of violation of the functional viability of the myocardium is considered to be the oxygen deprivation and lack of .

It includied 3 groups of male rats of Wistar line (weight 250-300g) with 10 animals in each group.

Myocardial infarction caused by ligation of the left coronary artery, and diabetes by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. Isolated cardiac myocytes were obtained by the enzymatic method. Oxygen consumption was assessed polarographically at different saturation incubation medium with oxygen ([O₂] ≤ 8 mg/l and ([O₂] ≥ 16 mg/l).  and palmitic acids were applied as fatty acids.It is established that the introduction of the incubation medium 20 µm  or palmitic fatty  significantly increased the oxygen consumption of intact cardiomyocytes of rats. Both at the ischemic and at the diabetic injury to the heart the opposite result was obtained. The most pronounced decrease in oxygen consumption was indicated in the group with diabetes mellitus.The inhibitory effect of LCD on the rate of oxygen consumption may be associated with the influence of the ischemic or diabetic injury to the heart on the barrierfunction ofmitochondrial membranes of cardiomyocytes, the activity of membrane-associated enzymes and their associated processes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27843756>Proximate composition and fatty  analysis of  (L.) legume seed: implicates to both protein and essential fatty  supplementation.</a></h2><p>The high mortality rate in Bangladesh is related to poverty, which results in protein malnutrition, essential fatty  deficiency and lacks in adequate vitamins, minerals and calorie. Exploring new food items with improved dietary nutrition factors may, therefore, help to decrease the mortality rate in the poor countries like Bangladesh. Accordingly, the present study was a proximate composition and fatty  analysis of  seed-a legume seed which is given no careful attention locally, though it might be a good source of valuable nutrition factors for both animals and humans. The purpose of the study was, therefore, to generate awareness that  could also act as a good source of food components essential for good health. Proximate analysis revealed that the seed powder contained 8.47 ± 0.52% moisture; 3.50 ± 0.0.07% ash; 1.02 ± 0.06% total fat; 23.95 ± 0.15% total protein; 1.21 ± 0.16% total dietary fiber; 61.86 ± 0.70% total carbohydrate and 352.4 ± 2.66 kcal/100 g . Phytic  content (%) was 1.014 ± 0.048. Major fatty  composition (%): the essential fatty  linoleic  (C18:2, ω-6) was 9.50 ± 0.68, while the linolenic  (C18:3, ω-3) was 1.95 ± 0.18.

Monounsaturated palmitoleic  (0.006 ± 0.0), docosapentaenoic  (DPA, C22:5, ω-3) and nervonic  (0.002 ± 0.0) were present in trace amounts.  (AA, C20:4, ω-6), eicosapentaenoic  (C20:5, ω-3), and docosahexaenoic  (C22:6, ω-3) were not detected. The fatty  profile, thus, suggests that essential omega-6 fatty  linoleic  (C18:3, ω-6) and omega-3 linolenic  (C18:3, ω-3) were the major polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) present in  seed. In addition, the seed contained high amount of proteins.

Information regarding safety, growth performance, and efficacy of feeding camelina cake to pigs is limited. We therefore evaluated the effects of camelina cake inclusion in pig nursery diets. In total, 192 pigs (9.4 kg BW) were randomly allocated by sex to 48 pens, 2 heavy and 2 light pigs per pen. Pigs were fed 1 of 4 wheat-based diets including camelina cake (0%, 6%, 12%, or 18%; variety Celine) replacing soybean meal for 4 wk. Individual pigs, pen feed added, and orts were weighed weekly. Feces were collected on d 26 and 27. A blood sample was taken on d 29 from 24 pigs with the lowest BW/pen, which were then euthanized and necropsied. Gross pathological examination was conducted, and organ weights were measured. Samples of liver, back fat, belly fat, and jowl fat were collected for fatty  analysis. Increasing dietary camelina cake inclusion linearly decreased ( 0.001) apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of DM, OM, GE and ash but did not affect ATTD of CP and P. For the entire trial (d 0 to 28), increasing camelina cake inclusion by 6% linearly decreased ( 0.001) ADFI by 74 g/d, ADG by 51 g/d, and BW by 0.8 kg but did not affect feed efficiency (G:F). Increasing camelina cake inclusion linearly increased ( 0.001) liver weight relative to BW, linearly decreased ( 0.050) kidney weight, but did not affect spleen, heart, and thyroid weights. Increasing camelina cake inclusion did not result in serological (large-animal standard panel, T3, and T4) or gross clinical (morphology) findings that might suggest toxicity. In liver, back fat, belly fat, and jowl fat, increasing dietary camelina cake inclusion linearly increased ( 0.050) total n-3 fatty acids and shorter-chain n-3 and n-6 fatty acids but did not increase docosahexaenoic  (n-3) or  (n-6). In conclusion, feeding camelina cake to weaned pigs at up to 18% did not elicit clinical signs of toxicity and increased n-3 fatty acids in carcass fat depots. The decrease in ADFI as camelina cake inclusion increased resulted in pigs fed 18% weighing 5 kg less than controls at the end of the nursery period.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30830410>Serum metabolomic profiles associated with postmenopausal hormone use.</a></h2><p>Postmenopausal hormone use is linked to several health outcomes and the risk associated with some may differ depending on whether estrogen is used alone or in combination with progestin.Metabolomic analyses of postmenopausal hormone use and differences between hormone regimes was done to identify metabolites associated with each type of hormone treatment.Untargeted metabolomics analysis was done on serum from 1336 women enrolled in the Cancer Prevention II Nutrition Cohort. Levels of 781 named metabolites were compared between 667 nonusers with 332 estrogen-only and with 337 estrogen plus progestin users using linear regression. Metabolite levels were also compared between estrogen-only and estrogen plus progestin users.Compared to nonusers, 276 metabolites were statistically significantly (P < 6.40 × 10) associated with estrogen-only use and 222 were associated with estrogen plus progestin use. The metabolites associated with both types of hormones included numerous lipids, acyl carnitines, and amino acids as well as the thyroid hormone thyroxine and the oncometabolite fumarate. The 65 metabolites that differed significantly between estrogen-only and estrogen plus progestin users included 19 steroids and 12 lipids that contained the bioactive fatty  .These findings suggest that postmenopausal hormone use influences metabolic pathways linked to a variety of cellular processes, including the regulation of metabolism and stress responses,  production, and inflammation.

Because platelet aggregation accounts for a major proportion of clot strength, we set out to characterize the effects of polytrauma on platelet function.Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with isoflurane. Polytrauma included laparotomy and damage to 10 cm of the small intestines, right and medial liver lobes, right leg skeletal muscle, femur fracture, and hemorrhage (40% of blood volume). No resuscitation was given. Blood samples were taken before and after trauma for the measurement of impedance electrode aggregometry, and intracellular levels of cyclic adenosine and guanosine monophosphate (cAMP, cGMP), inositol trisphosphate (IP3), and adenosine and guanosine triphosphates (ATP, GTP).Polytrauma significantly increased the response of collagen (24%) and thrombin (12%) to stimulate platelet aggregation. However, aggregation to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or  (AA) was significantly decreased at 2 (52% and 46%, respectively) and 4 h (45% and 39%). Polytrauma and hemorrhage also led to a significant early rise in cAMP (101 ± 11 to 202 ± 29 pg/mL per 1,000 platelets), mirrored by a decrease in cGMP (7.8 ± 0.9 to 0.6 ± 0.5). In addition, there was a late fall in ATP (8.1 ± 0.7 to 2.2 ± 0.6 ng/mL per 1,000 platelets) and GTP (1.5 ± 0.2 to 0.3 ± 0.1). IP3 rose initially, and then fell back to baseline.Polytrauma and hemorrhage led to a deficit in the platelet aggregation response to ADP and AA after trauma, likely due to the early rise in cAMP, and a later fall in  substrates, and may explain the decrease in clot strength and impaired hemostasis observed after severe trauma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29522918>Discovery of novel drug candidates for inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase of  cascade pathway implicated in atherosclerosis.</a></h2><p>Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), a key enzyme belonging to cytochrome P450 pathway of  cascade is a novel therapeutic drug target against atherosclerosis.

The endocannabinoid (eCB) system is a key regulator of metabolism and  homeostasis; however, information about this system in ruminants is scarce. Therefore, this work aimed to assess the eCB system in subcutaneous AT, and to determine its relation to the metabolic profile in peripartum cows. Biopsies of AT were performed at 14 d prepartum, and 4 and 30 d PP from 18 multiparous peripartum cows. Cows were categorized retrospectively according to those with high body weight (BW) loss (HWL, 8.5 ± 1.7% BW loss) or low body weight loss (LWL, 2.9 ± 2.5% BW loss) during the first month PP. The HWL had higher plasma non-esterified fatty acids and a lower insulin/glucagon ratio PP than did LWL. Two-fold elevated AT levels of the main eCBs, N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), were found 4 d PP compared with prepartum in HWL, but not in LWL cows. AT levels of the eCB-like molecules oleoylethanolamide, palmitoylethanolamide, and of  were elevated PP compared with prepartum in all cows. The abundance of monoglyceride lipase (MGLL), the 2-AG degrading enzyme, was lower in HWL vs. LWL AT PP. The relative gene expression of the cannabinoid receptors CNR1 and CNR2 in AT tended to be higher in HWL vs. LWL PP. Proteomic analysis of AT showed an enrichment of the inflammatory pathways' acute phase signaling and complement system in HWL vs. LWL cows PP. In summary, eCB levels in AT were elevated at the onset of lactation as part of the metabolic adaptations in PP dairy cows. Furthermore, activating the eCB system in AT is most likely associated with a metabolic response of greater BW loss, lipolysis, and AT inflammation in PP dairy cows.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29660629>Fatty  profile of blood plasma and oviduct and uterine fluid during early and late luteal phase in the horse.</a></h2><p>During early pregnancy, the secretome of both oviduct and uterus serves as exchange medium for signaling factors between embryo and mother and provides the embryo with nutrients.

Cycle stage was determined by visual evaluation of the ovary and measurement of plasma progesterone. No major effect of cycle stage on the FA profile was observed. However, the composition of FA was different between BP and both OF and UF. While linoleic, stearic, oleic and palmitic  were the four most prevalent FA in both BP and reproductive fluids, the latter contained higher concentrations of , eicosapentaenoic and dihomo-γ-linolenic .

There are scant data regarding how the content of non-essential fatty acids like monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) impact the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). In this work, we tested the hypothesis that obesogenic diets enriched in oleic  (OA; 18:1n-9) reduce polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) levels vs an obesogenic diet enriched in SFAs. Adult male mice were fed for eight weeks either (1) a control 16% fat  (en) diet with 5.7% en OA and 4.4% en SFA, (2) a 50% fat en diet with 33% en OA and 9.9% en SFA, or (3) a 50% en diet with a high SFA diet with 33% en SFA and 9.1% en OA. Dietary levels and intake of linoleic  (LA; 18:2n-6) and α-linolenic  (ALA; 18:3n-3) were constant between the experimental groups. Several peripheral organs (liver, heart, kidney, and adipose) were analyzed for lipid composition and oxylipin analysis was performed for liver and adipose. Our data demonstrate that a high OA diet reduced tissue content of LA and ALA (≥30%) in phospholipid and neutral lipid fractions, reduced the content of some LA-derived and ALA-derived oxylipins in liver and adipose, and conversely, elevated hepatic content of PGF. In all tissues examined, except for adipose, levels of  (ARA; 20:4n-6) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA; 22:6n-3) were either elevated or unaffected by the obesogenic diets.

We previously demonstrated that DNA microarray analysis is an appropriate method to comprehensively evaluate the effects of a HP diet on kidney dysfunction such as calcification, fibrillization, and inflammation. We reported that type IIb sodium-dependent phosphate transporter is significantly up-regulated in this context. In the present study, we performed DNA microarray analysis to investigate the effects of a HP diet on the liver, which plays a pivotal role in  metabolism. DNA microarray analysis was performed with total RNA isolated from the livers of rats fed a control diet (containing 0.3% phosphorus) or a HP diet (containing 1.2% phosphorus). Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed that the HP diet induced down-regulation of genes involved in hepatic amino  catabolism and lipogenesis, while genes related to fatty  β-oxidation process were up-regulated. Although genes related to fatty  biosynthesis were down-regulated in HP diet-fed rats, genes important for the elongation and desaturation reactions of omega-3 and -6 fatty acids were up-regulated. Concentrations of hepatic  and eicosapentaenoic  were increased in HP diet-fed rats. These essential fatty acids activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), a transcription factor for fatty  β-oxidation. Evaluation of the upstream regulators of DEGs using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis indicated that PPARα was activated in the livers of HP diet-fed rats. Furthermore, the serum concentration of fibroblast growth factor 21, a hormone secreted from the liver that promotes fatty  utilization in adipose tissue as a PPARα target gene, was higher (p = 0.054) in HP diet-fed rats than in control diet-fed rats. These data suggest that a HP diet enhances  expenditure through the utilization of free fatty acids released via lipolysis of white adipose tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954631>Serelaxin (recombinant human relaxin-2) treatment affects the endogenous synthesis of long chain poly-unsaturated fatty acids and induces substantial alterations of lipidome and metabolome profiles in rat cardiac tissue.</a></h2><p>Recombinant human relaxin-2, serelaxin, is being proved as a novel drug with therapeutic efficacy in some cardiovascular diseases, especially heart failure, a disease whose physiopathology and course are firmly correlated with important alterations in cardiac metabolism. The aim of our present work was to investigate changes in the cardiac metabolome following relaxin-2 treatment.Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with human recombinant relaxin-2 using osmotic minipumps at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks. Body composition was measured with a nuclear magnetic resonance imaging system seven days after surgery and on the final day of the experiment. The last two days of treatment, respiratory quotient, locomotor activity and  expenditure were measured with a calorimetric system. The plasma levels of relaxin-2, total cholesterol, high- and low- density lipoproteins (HDL, LDL), triglycerides and the hepatic enzymes glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GTP) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels were analyzed. The metabolic profiling of both atria from relaxin-2-treated and control rats was carried out using two separate ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-Time of Flight-MS based platforms analyzing methanol and chloroform/methanol extracts combined with a UHPLC-single quadrupole-MS based platform used to analyze aminoacids and with a methanol/water extract platform that covered polar metabolites. Identified ion features in the methanol extract platform included fatty acids, acyl carnitines, bile acids, monoacylglycerophospholipids, monoetherglycerophospholipids, free sphingoid bases, and oxidized fatty acids. The chloroform / methanol extract platform provided coverage over glycerolipids, cholesterol esters, sphingolipids, diacylglycerophospholipids, and acyl-ether-glycerophospholipids. Gene expression levels of the adipokines adiponectin, leptin and nesfatin-1 in visceral adipose tissue and cardiac gene expression levels of key enzymes of desaturation and elongation of n-6 and n-3 PUFAs were assessed by Real Time-PCR.Twenty-eight metabolites out of three hundred sixty-two were significantly altered by human relaxin-2. These included fifteen glycerophospholipids: three phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) and twelve phosphatidylcholines (PC); eight sphingolipids: three ceramides (Cer) and five sphingomyelins (SM); and also five aminoacids and one carboxylic . Interestingly, the majority of changes correspond to lipid classes, twelve of them polyunsaturated diacylglycerophosphatidylcholines with long acyl chains, containing mainly docosahexaenoic  (22:6) and  (20:4). Atrial levels of Elovl5 (Elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 5), Fads1 (Δ5-fatty  desaturase) and Fads2 (Δ6-fatty  desaturase), key enzymes of elongation and desaturation of n-6 and n-3 PUFAs like  and DHA, respectively, were significantly increased by relaxin-2 treatment. Atrial tissues from rats treated with relaxin-2 showed a significant increase in the mRNA levels of Srebf1, a transcription factor that activates the gene expression of Elovl5, Fads1 and Fads2. The treatment with relaxin-2 significantly decreased the visceral fat mRNA expression levels of adiponectin, leptin and nesfatin-1, adipokines known to exert an important influence on the regulation of cardiovascular function.Serelaxin (human recombinant relaxin-2) treatment induces significant changes in cardiac major components of the membrane lipid bilayer such as glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids, known to have structural roles but also very relevant regulatory effects in cardiac function. Serelaxin induced also modifications in several aminoacids of high influence in cardiac  metabolism regulation. Our results highlight the need to further understand the role of relaxin-2 in the regulation of cardiac  metabolism, in the context of the therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cardiometabolic pathologies as heart failure.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Plasma (10μL) was diluted with acetate buffer (80μL, 1M, pH 4.9) and d- and d-ibuprofen were extracted with ethyl acetate (2×500μL). After solvent evaporation d- and d-ibuprofen were derivatized in anhydrous acetonitrile by using pentafluorobenzyl (PFB) bromide and N,N-diisopropylethylamine as the base catalyst. Under electron-capture negative-ion chemical ionization (ECNICI), the PFB esters of d- and d-ibuprofen readily ionize to form their carboxylate anions [M-PFB] at m/z 205 and m/z 208, respectively. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) of m/z 205 and m/z 208 resulted in the formation of the anions at m/z 161 and m/z 164, respectively, due to neutral loss of CO (44 Da). A collision -dependent H/D isotope effect was observed, which involves abstraction/elimination of H from d-ibuprofen and D from d-ibuprofen and is minimum at a CE value of 5eV. Quantitative GC-MS determination was performed by selected-ion monitoring of m/z 205 and m/z 208. Quantitative GC-MS/MS determination was performed by selected-reaction monitoring of the mass transitions m/z 205 to m/z 161 for d-ibuprofen and m/z 208 to m/z 164 for d-ibuprofen. In a therapeutically relevant concentration range (0-1000μM) d-ibuprofen added to human plasma was determined with accuracy (recovery, %) and imprecision (relative standard deviation, %) ranging between 93.7 and 110%, and between 0.8 and 4.9%, respectively. GC-MS (y) and GC-MS/MS (x) yielded almost identical results (y=4.00+0.988x, r=0.9991). In incubation mixtures of  (10μM), d-ibuprofen (10μM) or d-ibuprofen (10μM) with ovine cyclooxygenase (COX) isoforms 1 and 2, the concentration of d-ibuprofen and d-ibuprofen did not change upon incubation at 37°C up to 60min. The trough pharmacokinetics of an inhaled arginine-containing ibuprofen preparation in mice was studied after once-daily treatment (0.0, 0.07, 0.4 and 2.5mg/kg body weight) for three days. A linear relationship between ibuprofen concentration in serum (10μL) and administered dose 24h after the last drug administration was observed.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Human epithelial 15-lipoxygenase-2 (h15-LOX-2), the major lipoxygenase in macrophages, has exhibited strict regiospecificity, catalyzing only the hydroperoxidation of carbon 15 of AA. To determine the catalytic potential of h15-LOX-2 in transcellular synthesis events, we reacted it with the three lipoxygenase-derived monohydroperoxy-eicosatetraenoic acids (HPETE) in humans: 5-HPETE, 12-HPETE, and 15-HPETE. Only 5-HPETE was a substrate for h15-LOX-2, and the steady-state catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of this reaction was 31% of the kcat/Km of AA. The only major product of h15-LOX-2's reaction with 5-HPETE was the proposed lipoxin intermediate, 5,15-dihydroperoxy-eicosatetraenoic  (5,15-diHPETE). However, h15-LOX-2 did not react further with 5,15-diHPETE to produce lipoxins. This result is consistent with the specificity of h15-LOX-2 despite the increased reactivity of 5,15-diHPETE. Density functional theory calculations determined that the radical, after abstracting the C10 hydrogen atom from 5,15-diHPETE, had an  5.4 kJ/mol lower than that of the same radical generated from AA, demonstrating the facility of 5,15-diHPETE to form lipoxins. Interestingly, h15-LOX-2 does react with 5S,6R-diHETE, forming LipoxinA4, indicating the gemdiol does not prohibit h15-LOX-2 reactivity. Taken together, these results demonstrate the strict regiospecificity of h15-LOX-2 that circumscribes its role in transcellular synthesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29967158>Role for fatty  amide hydrolase (FAAH) in the leptin-mediated effects on feeding and  balance.</a></h2><p>Endocannabinoid signaling regulates feeding and metabolic processes and has been linked to obesity development. Several hormonal signals, such as glucocorticoids and ghrelin, regulate feeding and metabolism by engaging the endocannabinoid system. Similarly, studies have suggested that leptin interacts with the endocannabinoid system, yet the mechanism and functional relevance of this interaction remain elusive. Therefore, we explored the interaction between leptin and endocannabinoid signaling with a focus on fatty  amide hydrolase (FAAH), the primary degradative enzyme for the endocannabinoid -arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide; AEA). Mice deficient in leptin exhibited elevated hypothalamic AEA levels and reductions in FAAH activity while leptin administration to WT mice reduced AEA content and increased FAAH activity. Following high fat diet exposure, mice developed resistance to the effects of leptin administration on hypothalamic AEA content and FAAH activity. At a functional level, pharmacological inhibition of FAAH was sufficient to prevent leptin-mediated effects on body weight and food intake. Using a novel knock-in mouse model recapitulating a common human polymorphism (FAAH C385A; rs324420), which reduces FAAH activity, we investigated whether human genetic variance in  affects leptin sensitivity. While WT (CC) mice were sensitive to leptin-induced reductions in food intake and body weight gain, low-expressing FAAH (AA) mice were unresponsive. These data demonstrate that FAAH activity is required for leptin's hypophagic effects and, at a translational level, suggest that a genetic variant in the FAAH gene contributes to differences in leptin sensitivity in human populations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27821270>Bipolar disorder moderates associations between linoleic  and markers of inflammation.</a></h2><p>Dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and inflammatory proteins associate with immune activation and have been implicated in the pathophysiology of mood disorders. We have previously reported that individuals with bipolar disorder (BPD) have decreased PUFA intake, including eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA), and  (AA); and decreased PUFA concentration of plasma EPA and linoleic  (LA). We have also reported an association between plasma LA and its metabolites and burden of disease measures in BPD. In the current cross-sectional study we collected blood samples and diet records from both bipolar (n = 91) and control subjects (n = 75) to quantify plasma cytokine concentrations and dietary LA intake, respectively. Using multiple linear regression techniques, we tested for case control differences in plasma cytokine levels and associations between cytokines and dietary LA intake, adjusting for sex, age, BMI, and total  intake. We found significantly higher plasma levels of interleukin 18 (IL-18) (p = 0.036), IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) (p = 0.001), soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor (sTNFR) 1 (p = 0.006), and sTNFR2 (p = 0.007) in BPD compared with controls. Moreover, BPD significantly moderated the associations of dietary LA intake with plasma levels of IL-18, sTNFR1 and sTNFR2, which were inverse associations in bipolar individuals and positive associations in controls (p for dietary LA x BPD diagnosis interaction < 0.05 for all three). These findings suggest potential dysregulation of LA metabolism in BPD, which may extend to a modified influence of dietary LA on specific inflammatory pathways in individuals with BPD compared to healthy controls.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The CRF was induced by gavage of 250 mg·kg·d adenine for 21 d. UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS technique was used in combination with principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) to analyze the urine metabolic profiles in three groups. The endogenous substances with the variable importance projection (VIP)>1 and <0.05 were screened as the potential biomarkers for CRF, and enrichment analysis of metabolic pathways was carried out.Compared with the normal control group, the model group had lower body weight, higher kidney coefficient, higher serum creatinine and urea nitrogen levels (all <0.01), while the above indexes in the Niaoduqing group were ameliorated compared with the model group (all <0.01). Fifteen potential biomarkers were found in the urine of the model group, which were involved in 9 metabolic pathways including phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis,  metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, tricarboxylic  cycle, glycerophosphatide metabolism, tryptophan metabolism and tyrosine metabolism.Niaoduqing granules has therapeutic effect on rats with CRF, which may be related to the regulation of amino  metabolism, lipid metabolism and  metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28525795>The role of secretory phospholipases as therapeutic targets for the treatment of myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury.</a></h2><p>Myocardial reperfusion injury is a consequence of restoration of blood flow post ischemia. It is a complex process involving an acute inflammatory response activated by cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and mediated by free radicals, calcium overload leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. Secretory phospholipases (sPLA2) are a group of pro-inflammatory molecules associated with diseases such as atherosclerosis, which increase the risk of reperfusion injury. This acute response leads to breakdown of phospholipids such as cardiolipin, found in the mitochondrial inner membrane, leading to disruption of  producing enzymes of the electron transport chain. Thus the activation of secretory phospholipases has a direct link to the vascular occlusion and arrhythmia observed in myocardial reperfusion injury. Therapeutic agents targeting sPLA2 are under human trials and many are in the preclinical phase. This article reviews the pathological effects of various groups of secretory phospholipases (I, II, V and X) implicated in myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury and the phospholipase inhibitors under development. Considering the fact that human trials in this class of drugs is limited, sPLA2 as a potential target for drug development is emphasized.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The fatty  compositions of neutral and polar lipids, respectively involved in  storage and cell membrane structure, were explored and compared in four tissues (red and white muscles, liver and gonads), according to biological (size, sex and maturity) and environmental (season and area) factors. The liver and the red muscle were the fattest tissues (i.e., higher levels of storage lipids) in all species and polar lipids were the lowest in the white muscle. Species and tissue types explained most differences in fatty  compositions, while environmental factors had limited effects, except in the hepatic cell membrane where fatty  composition varied with monsoons. Docosahexaenoic  (22:6n-3) was the major fatty  in both polar and neutral lipid fractions, especially in muscles. Eicosapentaenoic  (20:5n-3) and oleic  (18:1n-9) were in higher proportion in neutral than in polar lipids.  (20:4n-6) and 22:6n-3, together with docosapentaenoic  (22:5n-6) and stearic  (18:0), showed preferential accumulation in polar lipids. 20:4n-6 was particularly involved in cell membranes of ovary and white muscle. Overall, an important inter-individual variability in fatty  compositions of structural lipids was found within tissue types despite considering biological factors that are most likely to influence this type of lipids. It suggests that fatty  profiles are influenced by individual-specific behaviors.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Increased n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) ratio can induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial dysfunction that characterize NASH. Our recent study with n-3 PUFA showed improvement in individual histologic parameters like steatosis, ballooning and lobular inflammation. We hypothesized that n-3 PUFA therapy mediated improvement in histologic parameters is modulated by lipidomic and proteomic changes.We therefore evaluated hepatic proteomic and plasma lipidomic profiles before and after n-3 PUFA therapy in subjects with NASH. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, patients with NASH received 6-month treatment with n-3 PUFA (0.945 g/day [64% alpha-linolenic (ALA), 21% eicosapentaenoic (EPA), and 16% docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids]). Paired liver biopsy and plasma collected before and after-n-3 PUFA therapy were assessed using mass spectrometry and gas chromatography for hepatic proteomics and plasma lipidomics. Data were matched to UniProt and LIPID MAPS database, respectively. Cytoscape software was used to analyze functional pathways. Twenty-seven NASH patients with paired liver histology and plasma before and after n-3 PUFA treatment were studied.Treatment with n-3 PUFA significantly increased ALA, EPA, and glycerophospholipids, and decreased  (p < 0.05 for all). Further, proteomic markers of cell matrix, lipid metabolism, ER stress and cellular respiratory pathways were also modulated. Interestingly, these alterations reflected functional changes highly suggestive of decreased cellular lipotoxicity potential; reduced ER proteasome degradation of proteins and induction of chaperones; and a shift in cell  homeostasis towards mitochondrial beta-oxidation.Six-month treatment with omega-3 PUFAs significantly improved hepatic proteomic and plasma lipidomic markers of lipogenesis, endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial functions in patients with NASH.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

The resident peritoneal macrophage is the site of highest 12/15-LOX expression in the mouse. However, the role of the enzyme in the regulation of resident macrophages is not fully understood. Here, we describe a chemoproteomic method to identify the targets of enzymatically generated LDE. By treating mouse peritoneal macrophages with omega-alkynyl  (aAA), we identified a series of proteins adducted by LDE generated through a 12/15-LOX catalyzed reaction. Pathway analysis revealed a dramatic enrichment of proteins involved in  metabolism and found that glycolytic flux and mitochondrial respiration were significantly affected by the expression of 12/15-LOX.

In this paper, we studied the deregulatory effects of the deprivation of serotonin in Daphnia magna TRH CRISPR-Cas9 mutants. Bi-allelic in-del THR mutants and, to a lesser extent, mono-allelic ones grew less, reproduced later, and produced smaller clutches than wild type clones. Transcriptomic and functional gene analyses showed a down-regulation of growth/molting and  metabolism signaling pathways in TRH mutants, while revealing marked differences between mono- and bi-allelic clones. Bi-allelic mutants, lacking serotonin, presented the serotonergic synapse and  metabolic pathways down-regulated while the tryptophan to kynurenine was upregulated, thus indicating a cross-talk between the serotonergic and  metabolic pathways. Finally, the effects on the insulin growth factor-mediated signaling pathway were marginal. These changes in functional and metabolic pathways are consistent with previously reported effects in D. magna exposed to pharmaceuticals that inhibited  metabolism or enhanced the levels of serotonin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27927977>PPAR mRNA Levels Are Modified by Dietary n-3 Fatty  Restriction and  Restriction in the Brain and Liver of Growing Rats.</a></h2><p>Without dietary sources of n-3 (ω-3) long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs), α-linolenic  (ALA; 18:3n-3) is the precursor for docosahexaenoic  (DHA; 22:6n-3). It is not known how  restriction (ER) affects ALA conversion to DHA.We tested the hypothesis that ER reduces n-3 LCPUFA concentrations in tissues of growing rats fed diets replete with and deficient in ALA.Male Sprague-Dawley rats (23 d old) were provided AIN93G diets (4 wk) made with soybean oil (SO; ALA sufficient) or corn oil (CO; ALA deficient) providing 16% of  as fat. For each dietary oil, ER rats were individually pair-fed 75% of another rat's ad libitum (AL) intake. Fatty  (FA) concentrations in brain regions, liver, and plasma were analyzed. Expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), uncoupling proteins (UCPs), and mitochondrial DNA was analyzed in the brain and liver.AL rats consuming CO had a 65% lower concentration of n-3 docosapentaenoic  (22:5n-3) and a 10% lower DHA concentration in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum than did the SO-AL group. ER did not alter cerebral n-3 LCPUFA status. Liver n-3 LCPUFA concentrations were reduced in rats fed CO compared with SO. ER reduced hepatic linoleic  (18:2n-6), ALA, and  (20:4n-6) regardless of oil. ER and n-3 FA deficiency had independent effects on the mRNA levels of Pparα, Pparβ/δ, and Pparγ in the liver, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum. ER reduced Ucp3 mRNA by nearly 50% in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and liver, and Ucp5 mRNA was 30% lower in the cerebellum of rats receiving the CO diet.Small perturbations in PUFA concentration and ER modify the mRNA levels of Ppar and Ucp in the juvenile rat brain.

Relatively little is known about factors outside the central nervous system that may mediate the effect of high-fat diet (HFD) on brain endocannabinoid levels. One candidate is the liver fatty  binding protein (FABP1), a cytosolic protein highly prevalent in liver, but not detected in brain, which facilitates hepatic clearance of fatty acids. The impact of Fabp1 gene ablation (LKO) on the effect of high-fat diet (HFD) on brain and plasma endocannabinoid levels was examined and data expressed for each parameter as the ratio of high-fat diet/control diet. In male wild-type mice, HFD markedly increased brain N-acylethanolamides, but not 2-monoacylglycerols. LKO blocked these effects of HFD in male mice. In female wild-type mice, HFD slightly decreased or did not alter these endocannabinoids as compared with male wild type. LKO did not block the HFD effects in female mice. The HFD-induced increase in brain -derived arachidonoylethanolamide in males correlated with increased brain-free and total . The ability of LKO to block the HFD-induced increase in brain arachidonoylethanolamide correlated with reduced ability of HFD to increase brain-free and total  in males. In females, brain-free and total  levels were much less affected by either HFD or LKO in the context of HFD.

A 16-wk randomized complete block design study was conducted using 48 Holstein heifers (199 ± 2 d of age) with 3 treatments. Treatments were (1) 30% DDGS (30DG), (2) 40% DDGS (40DG), and (3) 50% DDGS (50DG), with the remainder of the diet consisting of grass hay and 1.5% mineral mix. Heifers were housed in groups of 6 and individually limit-fed using Calan gates at 2.65, 2.50, and 2.35% of body weight (BW) on a dry matter (DM) basis for 30DG, 40DG, and 50DG, respectively. Jugular blood samples were collected during wk 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16 for metabolite and metabolic hormone analysis. Additional samples were taken during wk 16 for plasma fatty  analysis. When heifers weighed 200 kg, coccygeal vein blood samples were taken twice per week for progesterone analysis to estimate onset of puberty. Blood samples continued until cycling was confirmed via ultrasound for the presence of a corpus luteum. A quadratic response and a linear tendency in the proportion of total fatty acids as linoleic  were observed. Linear and quadratic responses for plasma concentrations of linoleic  and  occurred. Overall results for fatty  analysis demonstrated that total fatty  and polyunsaturated fatty acids concentration in the blood were linearly increased, with a quadratic response for polyunsaturated fatty acids with 30DG and 50DG having the greatest concentrations. No interactions of treatment by week were observed for any of the metabolites and metabolic hormones measured. Glucose, insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, leptin, and triglycerides were similar across treatments. A linear response of plasma urea nitrogen and a quadratic response tendency for cholesterol concentration were observed. Age and BW at puberty were similar across treatments. Limit-feeding heifers with greater inclusion rates of DDGS maintained  status without the accumulation of excess adipose tissue as indicated by leptin. Treatments had no detrimental effects on age or BW at puberty.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The EC system is a complex network of lipid signaling pathways comprised of -derived compounds (anandamide, AEA) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), their G-protein-coupled receptors (cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2) and the associated enzymes. In addition to autism, the EC system is also involved in several other psychiatric disorders (i.e., anxiety, major depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia). This system is a key regulator of metabolic and cellular pathways involved in autism, such as food intake,  metabolism and immune system control. Early studies in autism animal models have demonstrated alterations in the brain's EC system. Autism is also characterized by immune system dysregulation. This alteration includes differential monocyte and macrophage responses, and abnormal cytokine and T cell levels. EC system dysfunction in a monocyte and macrophagic cellular model of autism has been demonstrated by showing that the mRNA and protein for CB2 receptor and EC enzymes were significantly dysregulated, further indicating the involvement of the EC system in autism-associated immunological disruptions. Taken together, these new findings offer a novel perspective in autism research and indicate that the EC system could represent a novel target option for autism pharmacotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769946>Next-Generation Sequencing Identifies Polyunsaturated Fatty  Responsive Genes in the Juvenile Rat Cerebellum.</a></h2><p>Dietary -3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) influence postnatal brain growth and development. However, little data exist regarding the impacts of dietary -3 PUFA in juvenile animals post weaning, which is a time of rapid growth. We tested the hypothesis that depleting dietary -3 PUFA would result in modifications to the cerebellar transcriptome of juvenile rats. To test this hypothesis, three week old male rats (an age that roughly corresponds to an 11 month old child in brain development) were fed diets containing either soybean oil (SO) providing 1.1%  from α-linolenic  (ALA; 18:3-3; ALA-sufficient) or corn oil (CO) providing 0.13%  from ALA (ALA-deficient) for four weeks. Fatty acids (FAs) in the cerebellum were analyzed and revealed a 4-fold increase in n-6 docosapentaenoic  (DPA; 22:5-6), increases in  (AA; 20:4-6) and docosatetraenoic  (DTA; 22:4-6), but no decrease in docosahexaenoic  (DHA; 22:6-3), in animals fed CO versus SO. Transcript abundance was then characterized to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two diets. Upper quartile (UQ) scaling and transcripts per million (TPM) data normalization identified 100 and 107 DEGs, respectively. Comparison of DEGs from the two normalization methods identified 70 genes that overlapped, with 90% having abundance differences less than 2-fold. , a transcriptional activator that plays roles in neuroprotection and learning, was elevated over 2-fold from the CO diet. These data indicate that expression of  in the juvenile rat cerebellum is responsive to dietary -3 PUFA, but additional studies are needed clarify the neurodevelopmental relationships between -3 PUFA and  and the resulting impacts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26844268>White Matter Lipids as a Ketogenic Fuel Supply in Aging Female Brain: Implications for Alzheimer's Disease.</a></h2><p>White matter degeneration is a pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's. Age remains the greatest risk factor for Alzheimer's and the prevalence of age-related late onset Alzheimer's is greatest in females. We investigated mechanisms underlying white matter degeneration in an animal model consistent with the sex at greatest Alzheimer's risk. Results of these analyses demonstrated decline in mitochondrial respiration, increased mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide production and cytosolic-phospholipase-A2 sphingomyelinase pathway activation during female brain aging. Electron microscopic and lipidomic analyses confirmed myelin degeneration. An increase in fatty acids and mitochondrial fatty  metabolism machinery was coincident with a rise in brain ketone bodies and decline in plasma ketone bodies. This mechanistic pathway and its chronologically phased activation, links mitochondrial dysfunction early in aging with later age development of white matter degeneration. The catabolism of myelin lipids to generate ketone bodies can be viewed as a systems level adaptive response to address brain fuel and  demand. Elucidation of the initiating factors and the mechanistic pathway leading to white matter catabolism in the aging female brain provides potential therapeutic targets to prevent and treat demyelinating diseases such as Alzheimer's and multiple sclerosis. Targeting stages of disease and associated mechanisms will be critical.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28526084>Liver phospholipids fatty acids composition in response to different types of diets in rats of both sexes.</a></h2><p>Dietary intake influence changes in fatty acids (FA) profiles in liver which plays a central role in fatty  metabolism, triacylglycerol synthesis and  homeostasis. We investigated the effects of 4-weeks treatment with milk- and fish-based diet, on plasma biochemical parameters and FA composition of liver phospholipids (PL) in rats of both sexes.Adult, 4 months old, Wistar rats of both sexes, were fed with different types of diets: standard, milk-based and fish-based, during 4 weeks. Analytical characterization of different foods was done. Biochemical parameters in plasma were determined. Fatty  composition was analyzed by gas-chromatography. Statistical significance of FA levels was tested with two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using the sex of animals and treatment (type of diet) as factors on logarithmic or trigonometric transformed data.Our results showed that both, milk- and fish-based diet, changed the composition and ratio of rat liver phospholipids FA, in gender-specific manner. Initially present sex differences appear to be dietary modulated. Although, applied diets changed the ratio of total saturated fatty acids (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and effects were gender specific. Milk-based diet lowered SFA and elevated MUFA in males and increased PUFA in females vs. standard diet. The same diet decreased n-3, increased n-6 and n-6/n-3 ratio in males. Fish-based diet increased n-3, decreased n-6 and n-6/n-3 ratio vs. standard and milk-based diet in females. However, the ratio of individual FA in liver PL was also dietary-influenced, but with gender specific manner. While in females fish-based diet decreased AA () increased level of EPA (eicosapentaenoic ), DPA (docosapentaenoic ) and DHA (docosahexaenoic ), the same diet elevated only DHA levels in males.Gender related variations in FA composition of rat liver PL were observed, and results have shown that those initial differences could be significantly modulated by the type of diet. Furthermore, the modulatory effects of milk- and fish-based diets on liver phospholipids FA profiles appeared to be sex-specific.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29788824>Activation of AMPK in Human Placental Explants Impairs Mitochondrial Function and Cellular Metabolism.</a></h2><p>Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a cellular  sensor whose phosphorylation increases  production. We sought to evaluate the placenta-specific effect of AMPK activation on the handling of nutrients required for fetal development.Explants were isolated from term placenta of 29 women (pregravid body mass index: 29.1 ± 9.9 kg/m) and incubated for 24 hours with 0 to 100 µmol/L resveratrol or 0 to 1 mmol/L of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxyamide ribonucleoside (AICAR). Following treatment, uptake and metabolism of radiolabeled fatty acids and glucose were measured. Phosphorylation of AMPK was measured by Western blotting. Adenosine diphosphate (ATP) production was assessed using the mitochondrial ToxGlo assay kit. P < .05 was considered statistically significant.Resveratrol and AICAR increased AMPK phosphorylation in human placental explants. Exposure to resveratrol decreased the uptake of polyunsaturated fatty acids, , and docosahexaenoic  at 100 µmol/L ( P < .0001). Fatty  oxidation was decreased by 100 µmol/L ( P < .05) resveratrol, while esterification was unchanged. Resveratrol decreased glucose uptake at the 50 and 100 µmol/L doses ( P < .05). Glycolysis was not significantly affected. AICAR had similar effects, decreasing fatty  uptake and glycolysis ( P < .05). Production of ATP declined at doses found to decrease nutrient metabolism ( P < .05).Activation of AMPK in the human placenta leads to global downregulation of metabolism, with mitotoxicity induced at the doses of resveratrol and AICAR used to activate AMPK. Although activation of this pathway has positive metabolic effects on other tissues, in the placenta there is potential for harm, as inadequate placental delivery of critical nutrients may compromise fetal development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29398618>A role for long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase-4 (ACSL4) in diet-induced phospholipid remodeling and obesity-associated adipocyte dysfunction.</a></h2><p>Regulation of fatty  (FA) metabolism is central to adipocyte dysfunction during diet-induced obesity (DIO). Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase-4 (ACSL4) has been hypothesized to modulate the metabolic fates of polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), including  (AA), but the in vivo actions of ACSL4 are unknown. The purpose of our studies was to determine the in vivo role of adipocyte ACSL4 in regulating obesity-associated adipocyte dysfunction.We developed a novel mouse model with adipocyte-specific ablation of ACSL4 (Ad-KO) using loxP Cre recombinase technology. Metabolic phenotyping of Ad-KO mice relative to their floxed littermates (ACSL4) was performed, including body weight and body composition over time; insulin and glucose tolerance tests; and  expenditure, activity, and food intake in metabolic cages. Adipocytes were isolated for ex vivo adipocyte oxygen consumption by Clark electrode and lipidomics analysis. In vitro adipocyte analysis including oxygen consumption by Seahorse and real-time PCR analysis were performed to confirm our in vivo findings.Ad-KO mice were protected against DIO, adipocyte death, and metabolic dysfunction. Adipocytes from Ad-KO mice fed high-fat diet (HFD) had reduced incorporation of AA into phospholipids (PL), free AA, and levels of the AA lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). Additionally, adipocytes from Ad-KO mice fed HFD had reduced p53 activation and increased adipocyte oxygen consumption (OCR), which we demonstrated are direct effects of 4-HNE on adipocytes in vitro.These studies are the first to elucidate ACSL4's in vivo actions to regulate the incorporation of AA into PL and downstream effects on DIO-associated adipocyte dysfunction. By reducing the incorporation of AA into PL and free fatty  pools in adipocytes, Ad-KO mice were significantly protected against HFD-induced increases in adipose and liver fat accumulation, adipocyte death, gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT) inflammation, and insulin resistance (IR). Additionally, deficiency of adipocyte ACSL4 expression in mice fed a HFD resulted in increased gWAT adipocyte OCR and whole body  expenditure (EE).Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Protein restriction, providing minimum safe levels of protein intake, is advocated. Standard paediatric tube feeding formulae provide more than the minimum safe protein requirements and are unsuitable in OA without modification. Modified paediatric enteral feeds consist of several modular ingredients. The aim of this prospective longitudinal interventional study was to assess the efficacy of a premeasured novel protein-free module developed for children aged over 12 months compared to conventional practice.In total, 15 children with OA (11.6-31 kg) needing enteral feeding were recruited. The protein-free module, from either a protein-free infant feed or modular ingredients, was replaced by the study feed. To ensure metabolic stability,  and protein intake were unchanged. Dietary intake, anthropometry and nutritional biochemistry were recorded at baseline and week 26.Dietary intakes of magnesium (P = 0.02), sodium (P = 0.005), vitamin D (P = 0.04), docosahexaenoic  (P = 0.01) and  (P = 0.001) significantly improved; plasma selenium (P = 0.002) and whole blood glutathione peroxidase (P = 0.02) significantly increased.

This exploratory study tested the effects of increasing dietary LA on plasma and cerebral cortex metabolites derived from LA, its elongation-desaturation products dihomo-gamma linolenic (DGLA, 20:3n-6)  and  (AA, 20:4n-6), as well as omega-3 alpha-linolenic (α-LNA, 18:3n-3), eicosapentaenoic (EPA, 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA, 22:6n-3). Plasma and cortex were obtained from rats fed a 0.4%, 5.2% or 10.5%  LA diet for 15 weeks and subjected to liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Total oxylipin concentrations, representing the esterified and unesterified pool, and unesterified oxylipins derived from LA and AA were significantly increased and EPA metabolites decreased in plasma at 5.2% or 10.5%  LA compared to 0.4%  LA. Unesterified plasma DHA metabolites also decreased at 10.5%  LA. In cortex, total and unesterified LA and AA metabolites increased and unesterified EPA metabolites decreased at 5.2% or 10.5% LA. DGLA and α-LNA metabolites did not significantly change in plasma or cortex. Dietary LA lowering represents a feasible approach for targeting plasma and brain LA, AA, EPA or DHA-derived metabolite concentrations.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Diels (Umbelliferae) (AS) is a well-known Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) that enriches and regulates the blood.An integrated metabonomic and proteomic method was developed and applied to study the blood enrichment effects and mechanisms of AS on blood deficiency (BD) mouse model.Forty mice were randomly divided into the control, BD, High-dose of AS (ASH), Middle-dose of AS (ASM), and Low-dose of AS (ASL) groups. BD model mice were established by injecting N-acetylphenylhydrazine (APH) and cyclophosphamide (CTX) (ip). The aqueous extract of AS was administered at three dose of 20, 10, or 5 g/kg b. wt. orally for 7 consecutive days before/after APH and CTX administration. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) combined with pattern recognition method and 2D gel electrophoresis (2-DE) proteomics were performed in this study to discover the underlying hematopoietic regulation mechanisms of AS on BD mouse model.Unlike in the control group, the HSP90 and arginase levels increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the BD group, but the levels of carbonic anhydrase, GAPDH, catalase, fibrinogen, GSTP, carboxylesterase and hem binding protein in the BD group decreased significantly (p < 0.05). Unlike the levels in the BD group, the levels of these biomarkers were regulated to a normal state near the control group in the ASM group. Unlike in the control group, l-alanine, , l-valine, octadecanoic , glycine, hexadecanoic , l-threonine, butanoic , malic , l-proline and propanoic  levels increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the BD group, the levels of d-fructose in the BD group decreased significantly (p < 0.05). The relative concentrations of 12 endogenous metabolites were also significantly affected by the ASL, ASM, and ASH treatments. Notably, most of the altered BD-related metabolites were restored to normal state after ASM administration.AS can promote hematopoietic activities, inhibit production of reactive oxygen species, regulate  metabolism, increase antiapoptosis, and potentially contribute to the blood enrichment effects of AS against APH- and CTX-induced BD mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31084404>Isozymes inhibited by active site blocking: versatility of calcium indifferent hesperidin binding to phospholipase A and its significance.</a></h2><p>sPLA is released under inflammatory conditions from neutrophils, basophils and T-cells.

The focus of this study is on the interaction of hesperidin, a natural flavonoid with Group IB, IIA, and V and X isozymes of sPLA. Affinity of hesperidin towards PLA isozymes was analyzed through enzymatic studies and molecular modeling. The experiments showed that hesperidin competitively inhibited PLA with IC of 5.1 µM. Molecular modeling studies revealed the association of hesperidin with the docking scores -6.90, -9.53, -5.63 and -8.29 kcal for isozymes Group IB, IIA, V and X of PLA respectively. Their binding  values were calculated as -20.25, -21.63, -21.66 and -33.43 kcal for the Group IB, IIA, V and X respectively. Structural model for Group V was made by homology modeling since no structural coordinates were available. Molecular dynamics studies were carried out to evaluate the structural stability of protein ligand complex. The analyses showed that hesperidin blocked the entry of the substrate to the active site of PLA and it was indifferent to the differences of the isozymes.

Galactomannan, an active major component in fenugreek seeds, has shown hypoglycemic activity. The present study was performed to investigate the therapeutic mechanism underlying fenugreek galactomannan (F-GAL) in treating diabetes, using a metabonomics approach based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF/MS). The F-GAL used for study was highly purified, and its yield, purity, and galactose/mannose ratio were characterized by capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) and a modified phenol-sulfuric  method. After treatment of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats with F-GAL for 28days, urine and serum samples were analyzed by UPLC-QTOF/MS. Multivariate statistical approaches such as principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projection to latent structures squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were applied to distinguish the non-diabetic/untreated, diabetic/untreated, and diabetic/F-GAL-treated groups. Then, potential biomarkers were identified that may help elucidate the underlying therapeutic mechanism of F-GAL in diabetes. The results demonstrated that there was a clear separation among the three groups in the PCA model. Fourteen potential biomarkers were identified by OPLS-DA, and they were determined to be produced in response to the therapeutic effects of F-GAL. These biomarkers were involved in histidine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism,  metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and  metabolism. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that a metabonomics approach is a powerful, novel tool that can be used to evaluate the underlying therapeutic mechanisms of herb extracts.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The laccase gene (3.0 kb) from C. neoformans serotype D was amplified, cloned and sequenced for protein modeling, docking and simulation studies. The three dimensional homology models of laccase protein from C. neoformans and other pathogenic gut bacteria were docked with selected biomolecules like prostaglandins (PG), membrane phospholipids, neurotransmitters (serotonin) using GOLD software. The GOLDscore values of laccase from C. neoformans docked with prostaglandinH (59.76), prostaglandinG (59.45), prostaglandinE (60.99), phosphatidylinositol (54.95), phosphatidylcholine (46.26), phosphatidylserine (55.26),  (53.08) and serotonin (46.22) were similar to the laccase from enteropathogenic bacteria but showed a better binding affinity as compared to that of the non-pathogenic bacteria (e.g. Bacillus safensis, Bacillus pumilus and Bacillus subtilis). The RMSD of MD simulation study done for 25 ns using laccase protein from C. neoformans complexed with phosphatidylcholine was found to be highly stable, followed by the laccase-PGE and laccase-serotonin complexes.

Long-term unhealed cervicitis may lead to a series of diseases including endometritis, salpingitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and chorioamnionitis. However, the pathogenesis of cervicitis remains unknown. Ainsliaea fragrans Champ. (AFC) has been widely used in clinical treatment of cervicitis. In the present study, we performed an integrative investigation involving histopathology analysis and non-target plasma metabolomics analysis in a cervicitis rat model induced by phenol mucilage, using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a tandem quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry approach. Based on the integrative investigation, marked metabolomic differences were identified between the cervicitis and control groups using multivariate analysis. As a result, 32 potential biomarkers were identified in the response to cervicitis, and were involved in  metabolism, linoleic  metabolism, primary bile  biosynthesis, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, and glycerophospholipid metabolism. After treatment, a total of 27 potential biomarkers exhibited altered levels in the AFC group compared to the model group, and 12 metabolites including 1-stearoylglycerophosphoinositol, bolasterone, lysoPC(16:0), lysoPC(20:4), lysoPC(P-16:0), lysoPC(P-18:0), lysoPC(P-18:1), stearoylcarnitine, taurine, lysoPC(17:0), 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic , and 1-arachidonoylglycerophosphoinositol returned to their normal levels.

Dendritic cells (DCs) disintegrate these compartments, thereby eliminating the microbes, through auto/xenophagy, which also promotes chlamydial antigen presentation via MHC I. Here, we show that TNF-α controls this pathway by driving cytosolic phospholipase (cPLA)2-mediated  (AA) production. AA then impairs mitochondrial function, which disturbs the development and integrity of these -dependent parasitic inclusions, while a simultaneous metabolic switch towards aerobic glycolysis promotes DC survival. Tubulin deacetylase/autophagy regulator HDAC6 associates with disintegrated inclusions, thereby further disrupting their subcellular localisation and stability. Bacterial remnants are decorated with defective mitochondria, mito-aggresomal structures, and components of the ubiquitin/autophagy machinery before they are degraded via mito-xenophagy. The mechanism depends on cytoprotective HSP25/27, the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin and HDAC6 and promotes chlamydial antigen generation for presentation on MHC I. We propose that this novel mito-xenophagic pathway linking innate and adaptive immunity is critical for effective DC-mediated anti-bacterial resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27146317>Utilization of milk fatty acids by the suckling Iberian piglets.</a></h2><p>A total of 16 pure-bred Iberian (IB) sows, all of them suckling six piglets, were used, eight of them in each of the two consecutive trials (1 and 2). Daily milk yield and composition were determined weekly over a 34-day lactation period. Within each litter, one piglet at birth and four piglets on day 35 of life were slaughtered. Milk intake per piglet tended to be greater in trial 2 (832 v. 893 g/day; P=0.066), but piglets grew at 168±3.3 g/day, irrespective of the trial. In the IB sow milk, the linoleic (LA) : linolenic (LNA)  ratio averaged 14.6 and 15.2 in trial 1 and trial 2, respectively. A fivefold increase in piglet body fat content was observed over lactation (P<0.001). Most of this fat (81.4%) was present in the carcass. After 34 days of lactation, whole-body relative content of palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic and oleic acids were very close to those in the milk consumed, suggesting direct deposition. Daily deposition of LA derivatives and of LNA and its derivatives was found to be extremely low (<0.02 g, on average). Moreover, some of the  (ARA) in tissues of the IB piglet at birth disappeared throughout the lactating period. An overall fractional deposition for total fatty acids (FA) was 0.409. Fractional oxidation (disappearance) rates were 0.939 and 0.926 for n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated FA. The overall rate of disappearance for the major non-essential FA (myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic and oleic acids), estimated as 1-the overall fractional deposition rate, was 0.546. It is concluded that the high degree of FA unsaturation, high oxidation rate of LA and LNA, and poor synthesis of ARA from LA and of docosahexaenoic  from LNA found in the suckling piglet might increase the  cost of whole-body fat accretion, a contributor to the observed low efficiency of use of milk  for growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31045311>Metabolic Engineering Strategies for the Enhanced Microalgal Production of Long-Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (LC-PUFAs).</a></h2><p>Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), largely obtained from fish oil, serve as valuable dietary supplements with many health benefits, especially , eicosapentaenoic , and docosahexaenoic . In recent years, interest in the sustainable production of LC-PUFAs using heterologous production hosts has drastically increased because overfishing and polluted oceans have led to a gradual decline in the supply of LC-PUFAs from fish oil in the last few decades. Some species of microalgae have been considered to be an ideal producer of LC-PUFAs as they inherently accumulate large amounts of LC-PUFAs and utilize CO using light . Also, a growing number of genetic toolboxes have become available, and the microalgal cultivation process is amenable to a scale-up. In fact, tremendous progress has been achieved in the development of high-performance strains of microalgae through metabolic engineering that has led to the efficient production of fatty acids and various derivatives in the last decade.

We found that calorie-restricted dams tended to have a reduced litter size, although the offspring showed normal weight at birth. Pups from calorie-restricted dams also exhibited a strong decrease in the levels of anandamide (AEA), 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG),  (AA) and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) in the hypothalamus at birth. Additionally, pups from diet-restricted dams displayed reduced levels of AEA in the hippocampus without significant differences in the olfactory bulb. Moreover, offspring exhibited increased weight gain, body weight and adiposity in adulthood as well as increased anxiety-related responses. We propose that endocannabinoid signaling is altered by a maternal caloric restriction implemented during the preconceptional and pregnancy periods, which might lead to modifications of the hypothalamic and hippocampal circuits, potentially contributing to the long-term effects found in the adult offspring.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29716562>Heavy ion mutagenesis combined with triclosan screening provides a new strategy for improving the  yield in Mortierella alpina.</a></h2><p> (ARA), which is a ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty , has a wide range of biological activities and is an essential component of cellular membranes in some human tissues. Mortierella alpina is the best strain for industrial production of ARA. To increase its yield of , heavy ion beam irradiation mutagenesis of Mortierella alpina was carried out in combination with triclosan and octyl gallate treatment.The obtained mutant strain F-23 ultimately achieved an ARA yield of 5.26 g L, which is 3.24 times higher than that of the wild-type strain. In addition, quantitative real-time PCR confirmed that the expression levels of fatty  synthase (FAS), Δ5-desaturase, Δ6-desaturase, and Δ9-desaturase were all significantly up-regulated in the mutant F-23 strain, especially Δ6- and Δ9-desaturase, which were up-regulated 3- and 2-fold, respectively.This study confirmed a feasible mutagenesis breeding strategy for improving ARA production and provided a mutant of Mortierella alpina with high ARA yield.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26918937>Understanding the Mechanism of the Hydrogen Abstraction from  Catalyzed by the Human Enzyme 15-Lipoxygenase-2. A Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics Free  Simulation.</a></h2><p>Lipoxygenases (LOXs) are a family of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of several lipid mediators. In the case of human 15-LOX, the 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2 isoforms show slightly different reaction regiospecificity and substrate specificity, indicating that substrate binding and recognition may be different, a fact that could be related to their different biological role. Here, we have used long molecular dynamics simulations, QM(DFT)/MM potential  and free  calculations (using the newly developed DHAM method), to investigate the binding mode of the  (AA) substrate into 15-LOX-2 and the rate-limiting hydrogen-abstraction reaction 15-LOX-2 catalyzes. Our results strongly indicate that hydrogen abstraction from C13 in 15-LOX-2 is only consistent with the "tail-first" orientation of AA, with its carboxylate group interacting with Arg429, and that only the pro-S H13 hydrogen will be abstracted (being the pro-R H13 and H10 too far from the acceptor oxygen atom). At the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level the potential and free  barriers for the pro-S H13 abstraction of AA by 15-LOX-2 are 18.0 and 18.6 kcal/mol, respectively. To analyze the kinetics of the hydrogen abstraction process, we determined a Markov model corresponding to the unbiased simulations along the state-discretized reaction coordinate. The calculated rates based on the second largest eigenvalue of the Markov matrices agree well with experimental measurements, and also provide the means to directly determine the pre-exponential factor for the reaction by comparing with the free  barrier height. Our calculated pre-exponential factor is close to the value of kBT/h. On the other hand, our results suggest that the spin inversion of the complete system (including the O2 molecule) that is required to happen at some point along the full process to lead to the final hydroperoxide product, is likely to take place during the hydrogen transfer, which is a proton coupled electron transfer. Overall, a different binding mode from the one accepted for 15-LOX-1 is proposed, which provides a molecular basis for 15-LOX-2 exclusive 15-HPETE production in front of the double (although highly 15-) 12/15 regiospecificity of 15-LOX-1. Understanding how these different isoenzymes achieve their regiospecificity is expected to help in specific inhibitor design.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30305846>Using a trait-based approach to optimize mixotrophic growth of the red microalga  towards fatty  production.</a></h2><p>Organic carbon sources have been reported to simultaneously increase the growth and lipid accumulation in microalgae.

Thus, our objective was to evaluate the effect of long-term consumption of weakly oxidised PUFA from flaxseed oil on oxidative stress biomarkers of LDL-receptor(-/-) mice. To test our hypothesis, mice were separated into three groups. The first group received a high-fat diet containing fresh flaxseed oil (CONT-), the second was fed the same diet prepared using heated flaxseed oil (OXID), and the third group received the same diet containing fresh flaxseed oil and had diabetes induced by streptozotocin (CONT+). Oxidative stress, aortic parameters and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease were assessed. After 3 months, plasma lipid profile, glucose levels, body weight,  intake and dietary intake did not differ among groups. Likewise, oxidative stress, plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), hepatic MDA expressed as nmol/mg portion (ptn) and antioxidant enzymes did not differ among the groups. Hepatic linoleic , α-linolenic ,  and EPA  declined in the OXID and CONT+ groups. Aortic wall thickness, lumen and diameter increased only in the OXID group. OXID and CONT+ groups exhibited higher concentrations of MDA, expressed as μmol/mg ptn per %PUFA, when compared with the CONT- group. Our results suggest that ingestion of oxidised flaxseed oil increases hepatic MDA concentration and is potentially pro-atherogenic. In addition, the mean MDA value observed in all groups was similar to those reported in other studies that used xenobiotics as oxidative stress inducers. Thus, the diet applied in this study represents an interesting model for further research involving antioxidants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28395825>Evaluation of structured lipids with behenic  in the prevention of obesity.</a></h2><p>Obesity affects all social classes, making it necessary to develop effective products that aid weight loss or help prevent weight gain. The objective of this work was to study the anti-obesity effects of structured lipids (SL) obtained by enzymatic interesterification, based on olive oil, soy oil and fully hydrogenated crambe oil. Twenty-four C57Bl/6 mice were distributed into four experimental groups according to the diet consumed: Control Diet (CD), Structured Lipids Diet (SLD), High-fat Control Diet (HCD), High-fat Structured Lipids Diet (HSLD). The animals that were fed SLs presented a smaller weight gain, despite a larger intake of the diet. The lowest weight gain was reflected in reduced amounts of adipose tissue and lower liver weight. A significant increase in lipids excreted by the animals in the feces was observed, despite there being no sign of toxicity or presence of diarrhea. The animals that consumed the HSLD presented lower total and LDL-cholesterol, increased HDL-cholesterol and increased hepatic  and docosahexaenoic  levels. In addition, they did not develop hepatic steatosis. The study therefore showed that SLs could play a major role in combating or preventing obesity and other resultant diseases, without producing side effects.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

(AA, C20:4 n-6) is elevated in obesity and postulated to stimulate bone resorption. This study aimed to determine the effect of AA on bone mass, quality, and adiposity in diet-induced obesity during growth. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=42, 4-week) were randomized into groups fed a control diet (CTRL, AIN-93G), high-fat diet (HFD, 35% kcal fat) or HFD + AA (1% w/w diet) for 6 weeks. Body composition, bone mineral density and microarchitecture were measured using dual- X-ray absorptiometry and micro-computed tomography. Red blood cell fatty  profile was measured with gas chromatography. Group differences were evaluated using repeated measures two-way analysis of variance with Tukey-Kramer post hoc testing. Total  intake did not differ among diet groups. At week 6, HFD + AA had significantly greater body fat % (12%), body weight (6%) and serum leptin concentrations (125%) than CTRL, whereas visceral fat (mass and %, assessed with micro-computed tomography) was increased in both HFD and HFD + AA groups. HFD + AA showed reduced whole body bone mineral content and femur mid-diaphyseal cortical bone cross-sectional area than HFD and CTRL, without impairment in bone strength. Contrarily, HFD + AA had greater femur metaphyseal trabecular vBMD (35%) and bone volume fraction (5%) compared to controls. Inclusion of AA elevated leptin concentrations in male rats. The early manifestations of diet-induced obesity on bone mass were accelerated with AA. Studies of longer duration are needed to clarify the effect of AA on peak bone mass following growth cessation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Our studies used isocaloric and isolipidic liquid diets (35% of calories from fat), with differing compositions of omega (ω)-6 or long chain (Lc) ω-3 PUFA that were pair-fed and assessed hepatic pathology, inflammation and lipid metabolism. Consistent with an isocaloric, pair-fed model we observed no significant difference in diet consumption between the groups. In contrast, the body and liver weight, total lipid level and abdominal fat deposits were significantly higher in mice fed an ω-6 diet. An analysis of the fatty  profile in plasma and liver showed that mice on the ω-6 diet had significantly more  (AA) in the plasma and liver, whereas, in these mice ω-3 fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) were not detected and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) was significantly lower. Histopathologic analyses documented that mice on the ω-6 diet had a significant increase in macrovesicular steatosis, extramedullary myelopoiesis (EMM), apoptotic hepatocytes and decreased glycogen storage in lobular hepatocytes, and hepatocyte proliferation relative to mice fed the Lc ω-3 diet. Together, these results support PUFA dietary regulation of hepatic pathology and inflammation with implications for enteral feeding regulation of steatosis and other hepatic lesions.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Delta-5 desaturase (D5D) is an enzyme that metabolizes dihomo-γ-linolenic  (DGLA) to  (AA). Thus, D5D inhibition increases DGLA (precursor to anti-inflammatory eicosanoids) while decreasing AA (precursor to pro-inflammatory eicosanoids), and could result in synergistic improvement in the low-grade inflammatory state. Here, we demonstrate reduced insulin resistance and the anti-obesity effect of a D5D selective inhibitor (compound-326), an orally active small-molecule, in a high-fat diet-induced obese (DIO) mouse model. In vivo D5D inhibition was confirmed by determining changes in blood AA/DGLA profiles. In DIO mice, chronic treatment with compound-326 lowered insulin resistance and caused body weight loss without significant impact on cumulative calorie intake. Decreased macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue was expected from mRNA analysis. Increased daily  expenditure was also observed following administration of compound-326, in line with sustained body weight loss. These data indicate that the novel D5D selective inhibitor, compound-326, will be a new class of drug for the treatment of obese and diabetic patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29335039>Replacing carbohydrate during a glucose challenge with the egg white portion or whole eggs protects against postprandial impairments in vascular endothelial function in prediabetic men by limiting increases in glycaemia and lipid peroxidation.</a></h2><p>Eggs attenuate postprandial hyperglycaemia (PPH), which transiently impairs vascular endothelial function (VEF). We hypothesised that co-ingestion of a glucose challenge with egg-based meals would protect against glucose-induced impairments in VEF by attenuating PPH and oxidative stress. A randomised, cross-over study was conducted in prediabetic men (n 20) who ingested isoenegertic meals (1674 kJ (400 kcal)) containing 100 g glucose (GLU), or 75 g glucose with 1·5 whole eggs (EGG), seven egg whites (WHITE) or two egg yolks (YOLK). At 30 min intervals for 3 h, brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD), plasma glucose, insulin, cholecystokinin (CCK), lipids (total, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol; TAG), F2-isoprostanes normalised to  (F2-IsoPs/AA), and methylglyoxal were assessed. In GLU, FMD decreased at 30-60 min and returned to baseline levels by 90 min. GLU-mediated decreases in FMD were attenuated at 30-60 min in EGG and WHITE. Compared with GLU, FMDAUC was higher in EGG and WHITE only. Relative to baseline, glucose increased at 30-120 min in GLU and YOLK but only at 30-90 min in EGG and WHITE. GlucoseAUC and insulinAUC were also lower in EGG and WHITE only. However, CCKAUC was higher in EGG and WHITE compared with GLU. Compared with GLU, F2-IsoPs/AAAUC was lower in EGG and WHITE but unaffected by YOLK. Postprandial lipids and methylglyoxal did not differ between treatments. Thus, replacing a portion of a glucose challenge with whole eggs or egg whites, but not yolks, limits postprandial impairments in VEF by attenuating increases in glycaemia and lipid peroxidation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26989626>Proteome-wide prediction of targets for aspirin: new insight into the molecular mechanism of aspirin.</a></h2><p>Besides its anti-inflammatory, analgesic and anti-pyretic properties, aspirin is used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and various types of cancer. The multiple activities of aspirin likely involve several molecular targets and pathways rather than a single target. Therefore, systematic identification of these targets of aspirin can help us understand the underlying mechanisms of the activities. In this study, we identified 23 putative targets of aspirin in the human proteome by using binding pocket similarity detecting tool combination with molecular docking, free  calculation and pathway analysis. These targets have diverse folds and are derived from different protein family. However, they have similar aspirin-binding pockets. The binding free  with aspirin for newly identified targets is comparable to that for the primary targets. Pathway analysis revealed that the targets were enriched in several pathways such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling, Fc epsilon RI signaling and  metabolism, which are strongly involved in inflammation, cardiovascular disease and cancer. Therefore, the predicted target profile of aspirin suggests a new explanation for the disease prevention ability of aspirin. Our findings provide a new insight of aspirin and its efficacy of disease prevention in a systematic and global view.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27878455>Structural Insight into Binding Mode of 9-Hydroxy Aristolochic , Diclofenac and Indomethacin to PLA.</a></h2><p>Phospholipase A (PLA) catalyzes the hydrolysis of phospholipids into  and lysophospholipids.  is modified by cyclooxygenases into active compounds called eicosanoids that act as signaling molecules in a number of physiological processes. Excessive production of eicosanoids leads to several pathological conditions such as inflammation. In order to block the inflammatory effect of these compounds, upstream enzymes such as PLA are valid targets. In the present contribution, molecular dynamic analysis was performed to evaluate the binding of diclofenac, 9-hydroxy aristolochic  (9-HAA) and indomethacin to PLA. Obtained results revealed that 9-HAA could form a more stable complex with PLA when compared to diclofenac and indomethacin. Furthermore, analysis of intermolecular binding  components indicated that hydrophobic interactions were dominant in binding process. On the basis of obtained data, inhibitors bearing fused rings with hydrogen acceptor/donor substituent(s) interacted with His48 and Asp49 residues of the active site. More affinity toward PLA might be envisaged through negatively charged moieties via interaction with Trp31, Lys34 and Lys69.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28535956>Highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) mediate and monitor food's impact on health.</a></h2><p>A hyperbolic, saturable, competitive dynamic of ligand binding to metabolic enzymes and lipid mediator receptors gives non-linear dose-response interactions that need careful management when planning or interpreting nutrient-based interventions. Relatively indiscriminate metabolism during accumulation of HUFA from n-3 and n-6 nutrients allows the amounts of n-3 and n-6 nutrients to determine the HUFA balance accumulated in tissue phospholipids. However, when HUFA-based eicosanoid actions are more intense with n-6 than n-3 mediators, they cause healthy physiology to shift toward pathophysiology. The proportion of n-6 in tissue HUFA directly relates to the severity of conditions caused by excessive n-6 actions. In the absence of n-3 nutrients, dietary linoleate (18:2n-6) has a very narrow therapeutic window below 1 percent of food , and it is widened by n-3 nutrients. The predictable quantitative dynamics of competing n-3 and n-6 nutrients allows design of successful preventive nutrition protocols that confirm and extend the epidemiologically observed benefits of n-3 nutrients.Copyright © 2017 The Author.

PPARγ receptor is found to play a crucial role in the modulation of lipid and glucose homeostasis. Its commotion has been reported to play a significant role in a broad spectrum of diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, inflammatory diseases, Alzheimer's disease, and in some cancers. Hence, PPARγ is an important therapeutic target. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and their metabolites (henceforth referred to as bioactive lipids) are known to function as agonists of PPARγ. However, agonistic binding modes and affinity of these ligands to PPARγ are yet to be deciphered.In this study, we performed a comparative molecular docking, binding free  calculation and molecular dynamics simulation to infer and rank bioactive lipids based on the binding affinities with the ligand binding domain (LBD) of PPARγ.The results inferred affinity in the order of resolvin E1 > neuroprotectin D1 > hydroxy-linoleic  > docosahexaenoic  > lipoxin A4 > gamma-linolenic ,  > alpha-linolenic  > eicosapentaenoic  > linoleic .

The present study was to describe the dietary intake of a large group of children with CF and to determine whether dietary fat composition explains differences in plasma PC and PE fatty acids between children with and without CF.Dietary intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. Venous blood was collected. Plasma PC and PE were separately analyzed for fatty acids.Children with CF, n = 74, consumed more calories and fat (g/day and % ), with significantly more saturates mainly from dairy foods and less polyunsaturates including linoleic  (LA),  (ARA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) (% fat) than reference children, n = 71. A subset of children with CF, not differing in dietary intake from the larger group, had significantly lower LA and DHA, but higher EPA in plasma PC and had higher LA and lower ARA and DHA in plasma PE, compared to a subset of reference children. In both groups, LA intake and LA in plasma PC and PE were not associated. EPA and DHA intakes were positively associated with EPA and DHA, respectively, in plasma PC, but not PE, in reference children only.The fatty  composition of plasma PC and PE is altered in CF.

Given their importance in numerous physiological processes, the roles of LCFAs in health and disease have been extensively investigated. In the majority of studies, correlations are established using a single measurement in plasma or red blood cells (RBCs). Although a few studies have reported on reproducibility of individual fatty  measurements, the comprehensive analysis of intra-individual LCFA variability has not been performed. Therefore, our goal was to determine intra-individual variability for the 22 most abundant LCFAs in both plasma and RBC samples collected from healthy individuals on a regular diet after overnight fasting. The measurements of LCFAs in RBCs were consistent throughout the course of study reflecting long-term nutritional status. In contrast, the results in plasma showed considerable LCFA intra-individual variability, even between fatty acids of the same type. Plasma intra-individual variability for omega-3 alpha-linolenic and eicosapentaenoic acids in some participants were >40% whereas the variability of docosahexaenoic  was consistently <12.8%. Omega-6 linoleic and  acids also showed low variability in plasma. The results suggest that some LCFAs have less variability and would be more reliable as biomarkers. Reliability of biomarkers can have a profound impact on the research outcomes. Intra-individual variability of LCFAs should be taken into consideration in designing, conducting and interpreting results of clinical studies.Copyright © 2018.

A number of animal models of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are established but they significantly differ in the molecular and biochemical changes depending on the genetic modification and diet used. Mice deficient for melanocortin type 4 receptor (Mc4rmut) develop hyperphagia, obesity, and subsequently NAFLD already under regular chow and resemble more closely the  supply-driven obesity found in humans. This animal model was used to assess the molecular and biochemical consequences of hyperphagia-induced obesity on hepatic lipid metabolism. We analyzed transcriptome changes in Mc4rmut mice by RNA sequencing and used high resolution 1H magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to assess changes in the lipid composition. On the transcriptomic level we found significant changes in components of the triacylglycerol metabolism, unsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling pathways, and lipid transport and storage compared to the wild-type. These findings were supported by increases in triacylglycerol, monounsaturated fatty , and  levels. The transcriptome signatures significantly differ from those of other NAFLD mouse models supporting the concept of hepatic subphenotypes depending on the genetic background and diet. Comparative analyses of our data with previous studies allowed for the identification of common changes and genotype-specific components and pathways involved in obesity-associated NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31167809>Novel CB1-ligands maintain homeostasis of the endocannabinoid system in ω3- and ω6-long-chain-PUFA deficiency.</a></h2><p>Mammalian ω3- and ω6-PUFAs are synthesized from essential fatty acids (EFAs) or supplied by the diet.

The first-in-class CBR antagonist rimonabant proved effective in inducing weight loss in adults with PWS. However, it is no longer available for clinical use because of its centrally mediated, neuropsychiatric, adverse effects.We studied eCB 'tone' in individuals with PWS and in the -null mouse model that recapitulates the major metabolic phenotypes of PWS and determined the efficacy of a peripherally restricted CBR antagonist, JD5037 in treating obesity in these mice.Individuals with PWS had elevated circulating levels of 2-arachidonoylglycerol and its endogenous precursor and breakdown ligand, . Increased hypothalamic eCB 'tone', manifested by increased eCBs and upregulated CBR, was associated with increased fat mass, reduced  expenditure, and decreased voluntary activity in -null mice. Daily chronic treatment of obese -null mice and their littermate wild-type controls with JD5037 (3 mg/kg/d for 28 days) reduced body weight, reversed hyperphagia, and improved metabolic parameters related to their obese phenotype.Dysregulation of the eCB/CBR system may contribute to hyperphagia and obesity in -null mice and in individuals with PWS.

Targeted metabolomics profiling during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic insulin clamp testing may help identify aberrant metabolic pathways contributing to insulin resistance in CKD. Using targeted metabolomics profiling, we examined the plasma metabolome in 95 adults without diabetes in the fasted state (58 with CKD, 37 with normal glomerular filtration rate [GFR]) who underwent hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. We assessed heterogeneity in fasting metabolites and the response to insulin to identify potential metabolic pathways linking CKD with insulin resistance. Baseline differences and effect modification by CKD status on changes with insulin clamp testing were adjusted for confounders. Mean GFR among participants with CKD was 37.3 compared with 89.3 ml/min per 1.73 m2 among controls. Fasted-state differences between CKD and controls included abnormalities in tryptophan metabolism, ubiquinone biosynthesis, and the TCA cycle. Insulin infusion markedly decreased metabolite levels, predominantly amino acids and their metabolites. CKD was associated with attenuated insulin-induced changes in nicotinamide, , and glutamine/glutamate metabolic pathways.

Firstly, the fatty  composition of the rainbow trout liver cell line RTL-W1 was modified by enriching the growth medium with either alpha-linolenic  (ALA, 18:3n-3), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, 20:5n-3), docosahexaenoic  (DHA, 22:6n-3), linoleic  (LA, 18:2n-6),  (AA, 20:4n-6) or docosapentaenoic  (DPA, 22:5n-6). These modified cells and their control (no PUFA enrichment) were then challenged for 24h with increasing concentrations of methylmercury or cadmium. We observed that (i) the phospholipid composition of the RTL-W1 cells was profoundly modulated by changing the PUFA content of the growth medium: major modifications were a high incorporation of the supplemented PUFA in the cellular phospholipids, the appearance of direct elongation and desaturation metabolites in the cellular phospholipids as well as a change in the gross phospholipid composition (PUFA and monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA) levels and n-3/n-6 ratio); (ii) ALA, EPA and DPA enrichment significantly protected the RTL-W1 cells against both methylmercury and cadmium; (iv) DHA enrichment significantly protected the cells against cadmium but not methylmercury; (v) AA and LA enrichment had no impact on the cell tolerance to both methylmercury and cadmium; (vi) the abundance of 20:3n-6, a metabolite of the n-6 biotransformation pathway, in phospholipids was negatively correlated to the cell tolerance to both methylmercury and cadmium. Overall, our results highlighted the importance of the fatty  supply on the tolerance of fish liver cells to methylmercury and cadmium.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

These developments raise concerns about the physical, psychosocial and cognitive consequences of obesity. It was shown that early dietary intake of  (ARA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) can reduce the detrimental effects of later obesogenic feeding on lipid metabolism and adipogenesis in an animal model of mild obesity. In the present study, the effects of early dietary ARA and DHA on cognition and brain structure were examined in mildly obesogenic ApoE*3Leiden mouse model. We used cognitive tests and neuroimaging during early and later life. During their early development after weaning (4-13weeks of age), mice were fed a chow diet or ARA and DHA diet for 8 weeks and then switched to a high-fat and high-carbohydrate (HFHC) diet for 12weeks (14-26weeks of age). An HFHC-diet led to increased  storage in white adipose tissue, increased cholesterol levels, decreased triglycerides levels, increased cerebral blood flow and decreased functional connectivity between brain regions as well as cerebrovascular and gray matter integrity. ARA and DHA intake reduced the HFHC-diet-induced increase in body weight, attenuated plasma triglycerides levels and improved cerebrovasculature, gray matter integrity and functional connectivity in later life. In conclusion, an HFHC diet causes adverse structural brain and metabolic adaptations, most of which can be averted by dietary ARA and DHA intake early in life supporting metabolic flexibility and cerebral integrity later in life.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Seventy-eight mothers (19⁻42 years of age) of Asian, Māori, Pacific Island, or of European ethnicity living in Manawatu-Wanganui, New Zealand (NZ) completed the study. The women provided three breast milk samples over a one-week period (6⁻8 weeks postpartum), completed a three-day food diary and provided information regarding their pregnancy and lactation experiences. The breast milk samples were analyzed for protein, fat, fatty  profile, ash, selected minerals (calcium, magnesium, selenium, zinc), and carbohydrates. Breast milk nutrient profiles showed no significant differences between the mothers of different ethnicities in their macronutrient (protein, fat, carbohydrate, and moisture) content. The breast milk of Asian mothers contained significantly higher levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), omega-3 (-3) and omega-6 (-6) fatty acids, docosahexaenoic  (DHA), and linoleic acids.  was significantly lower in the breast milk of Māori and Pacific Island women. Dietary intakes of protein, total , saturated and polyunsaturated fat, calcium, phosphorus, zinc, iodine, vitamin A equivalents, and folate differed between the ethnic groups, as well as the number of serves of dairy foods, chicken, and legumes.

Therefore, we used a C to C diet shift experiment and compound-specific δC analysis to estimate the turnover rates of FAs in the polar and neutral fractions of flight muscle lipids (corresponding to membranes and lipid droplets) of exercised and sedentary zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Turnover was fastest for linoleic  (LA; 18:2n6) and palmitic  (PA; 16:0), with 95% replacement times of 10.8-17.7 d in the polar fraction and 17.2-32.8 d in the neutral fraction, but was unexpectedly slow for the long-chain polyunsaturated FAs (LC-PUFAs)  (20:4n6) and docosahexaenoic  (22:6n3) in the polar fraction, with 95% replacement in 64.9-136.5 d. Polar fraction LA and PA turnover was significantly faster in exercised birds (95% replacement in 8.5-13.3 d). Our results suggest that FA turnover in intramuscular lipid droplets is related to FA tissue concentrations and that turnover does not change in response to exercise. In contrast, we found that muscle membrane FA turnover is likely driven by a combination of selective LC-PUFA retention and consumption of shorter-chain FAs in  metabolism. The unexpectedly fast turnover of membrane-associated FAs in muscle suggests that songbirds during migration could substantially remodel their membranes within a single migration stopover, and this may have substantial implications for how the FA composition of diet affects  metabolism of birds during migration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29687906>Regulation of Cerebral Blood Flow: Response to Cytochrome P450 Lipid Metabolites.</a></h2><p>There have been numerous reviews related to the cerebral circulation.

Leukotriene-induced inflammation has been implicated in the development of post-traumatic lung injury through a mechanism that is only partially understood. Postshock mesenteric lymph returning to the systemic circulation is rich in , the substrate of 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5). ALOX5 is the rate-limiting enzyme in leukotriene synthesis and, following T/HS, contributes to the development of lung dysfunction. ALOX5 colocalizes with its cofactor, 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (ALOX5AP), which is thought to potentiate ALOX5 synthetic activity. We hypothesized that T/HS results in the molecular association and nuclear colocalization of ALOX5 and ALOX5AP, which ultimately increases leukotriene production and potentiates lung injury.To examine these molecular interactions, a rat T/HS model was used. Post-T/HS tissue was evaluated for lung injury through both histologic analysis of lung sections and biochemical analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Lung tissue was immunostained for ALOX5 and ALOX5AP with association and colocalization evaluated by fluorescence resonance  transfer. In addition, rats undergoing T/HS were treated with MK-886, a known ALOX5AP inhibitor.ALOX5 levels increase and ALOX5/ALOX5AP association occurred after T/HS, as evidenced by increases in total tissue fluorescence and fluorescence resonance  transfer signal intensity, respectively. These findings coincided with increased leukotriene production and with the histological changes characteristic of lung injury. ALOX5/ALOX5AP complex formation, leukotriene production, and lung injury were decreased after inhibition of ALOX5AP with MK-886.These results suggest that the association of ALOX5/ALOX5AP contributes to leukotriene-induced inflammation and predisposes the T/HS animal to lung injury.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Previous studies of this subject have mainly been epidemiological investigations or analyses of gene and protein levels; however, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolic profiling, which will help clarify the molecular mechanisms of susceptibility in PM-induced neurotoxicity, is lacking. In the present study, C57BL/6 mice at different ages (4 weeks, 4 months and 10 months) received oropharyngeal aspiration of PM (3 mg/kg) every other day for 4 weeks. The Morris water maze showed that PM exposure caused deterioration of spatial learning and memory in young (4 week old) mice. In addition, the levels of several metabolites belonging to different metabolite classes were significantly changed by PM exposure in 4-week-old mice. Based on metabolic pathway analysis, we speculated that the decline in spatial learning and memory due to PM exposure may be directly or indirectly associated with hippocampal region-specific metabolic alterations involving  metabolism (citric , succinic , malic , maltose and creatinine); cholesterol metabolism (desmosterol, lanosterol and campesterol);  metabolism (methyl , nonanoic  and linoleic ); inositol phosphate metabolism (myo-inositol, myo-inositol-1-phosphate and methyl-phosphate) and aspartic  metabolism (aspartic , asparagine and homoserine).Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

It was also evaluated how diet modification affects the weight of animals and weight of the specific organs: liver, kidney and spleen. Wistar male rats were divided into 6 groups according to the diet fed (control, sunflower oil, olive oil, rapeseed oil, fish oil and a group of dietary  restriction - DER group). The enzyme activities were established indirectly in liver microsomes. To this aim the method of high performance liquid chromatography with UV/VIS detection was used. In addition, the indices of ∆-desaturase (D6D) and ∆-desaturase (D5D) were determined. Significant differences in the concentrations of fatty acids and enzyme activity were observed. The results concerning desaturases show the negative correlation between n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids intake and enzymes activity. The highest D6D activity was observed in microsomes obtained from sunflower oil fed rats and the lowest D6D activity was in the DER group. D5D index did not differ much depending on the diet. Among groups supplemented with oils the higher mean values of the weight of liver were observed in the group supplemented with rapeseed oil.

However, the specific contribution of each ATP-generating pathway i.e., oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) versus glycolysis and the biochemical mechanisms involved in the thrombin-induced activation of  metabolism remain unclear. Here we report an integral analysis on the role of both  pathways in human platelets activated by several agonists, and the signal transducing mechanisms associated with such activation. We found that thrombin, Trap-6, , collagen, A23187, epinephrine and ADP significantly increased glycolytic flux (3-38 times vs. non-activated platelets) whereas ristocetin was ineffective. OxPhos (33 times) and mitochondrial transmembrane potential (88%) were increased only by thrombin. OxPhos was the main source of ATP in thrombin-activated platelets, whereas in platelets activated by any of the other agonists, glycolysis was the principal ATP supplier. In order to establish the biochemical mechanisms involved in the thrombin-induced OxPhos activation in platelets, several signaling pathways associated with mitochondrial activation were analyzed. Wortmannin and LY294002 (PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitors), ristocetin and heparin (GPIb inhibitors) as well as resveratrol, ATP (calcium-release inhibitors) and PP1 (Tyr-phosphorylation inhibitor) prevented the thrombin-induced platelet activation.

However, the potential mechanism of the neuroprotective effects of TC at the metabonomics level is still not clear. The present study focused on the effects of TC on metabonomics in a stroke model. Rats were divided randomly into sham, model, and TC groups. Rats in the TC group were intragastrically administered with TC for 7 days after a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) operation. The sham and the model groups received vehicle for the same length of time. Subsequently, the neuroprotective effects of TC were examined by evaluation of neurological defects, assessment of infarct volume, and identification of biochemical indicators for antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Further, metabonomics technology was employed to evaluate the endogenous metabolites profiling systematically. Consist with the results of biochemical and histopathological assays, pattern recognition analysis showed a clear separation of the model group and the sham group, indicating the recovery impact of TC on the MCAO rats. Moreover, 12 potential biomarkers were identified in the MCAO model group, involving  (lactic , succinic , and fumarate), amino acids (leucine, alanine, and phenylalanine), and glycerophospholipid (PC [16:0/20:4], PC [20:4/20:4], LysoPC [18:0], and LysoPC [16:0]) metabolism, as well as other types of metabolism ( and palmitoylcarnitine). Notably, it was found that metabolite levels of TC group were partially reversed to normal. In conclusion, TC could ameliorate MCAO in rats by affecting  metabolism (glycolysis and the TCA cycle), amino  metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and other types of metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30717356>Curbing Lipids: Impacts ON Cancer and Viral Infection.</a></h2><p>Lipids play a fundamental role in maintaining normal function in healthy cells. Their functions include signaling, storing , and acting as the central structural component of cell membranes. Alteration of lipid metabolism is a prominent feature of cancer, as cancer cells must modify their metabolism to fulfill the demands of their accelerated proliferation rate. This aberrant lipid metabolism can affect cellular processes such as cell growth, survival, and migration. Besides the gene mutations, environmental factors, and inheritance, several infectious pathogens are also linked with human cancers worldwide. Tumor viruses are top on the list of infectious pathogens to cause human cancers. These viruses insert their own DNA (or RNA) into that of the host cell and affect host cellular processes such as cell growth, survival, and migration. Several of these cancer-causing viruses are reported to be reprogramming host cell lipid metabolism. The reliance of cancer cells and viruses on lipid metabolism suggests enzymes that can be used as therapeutic targets to exploit the addiction of infected diseased cells on lipids and abrogate tumor growth. This review focuses on normal lipid metabolism, lipid metabolic pathways and their reprogramming in human cancers and viral infection linked cancers and the potential anticancer drugs that target specific lipid metabolic enzymes. Here, we discuss statins and fibrates as drugs to intervene in disordered lipid pathways in cancer cells.

In response to cues present in the TME, among which products of altered tumor cell metabolism, TAMs are also required to reprogram their metabolism, with activation of glycolysis, fatty  synthesis and altered nitrogen cycle metabolism. These changes result in functional reprogramming of TAMs which includes changes in the production of cytokines and angiogenetic factors, and contribute to the tumor progression and metastasis. Understanding the metabolic changes governing the intricate relationship between the tumor cells and the TAMs represents an essential step towards developing novel therapeutic approaches targeting the metabolic reprogramming of the immune cells to potentiate their tumoricidal potential and to circumvent therapy resistance.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Among mitochondrial activity regulators, SIRT3 plays a crucial role in controlling the acetylation status of many enzymes participating in the  metabolism in particular concerning lipid metabolism and fatty  oxidation. Data suggest that possible connection may exist between SIRT3 and CL status that has not been evaluated in skeletal muscle. In the present study, we have characterized skeletal muscle lipids as well as mitochondrial lipids composition in mice overexpressing long (SIRT3-M1) and short (SIRT3-M3) isoforms of SIRT3. Particular attention has been paid for CL. We reported no alteration in muscle lipids content and fatty acids composition between the two mice SIRT3 strains and the control mice. However, mitochondrial CL content was significantly decreased in SIRT3-M3 mice and associated to an upregulation of tafazzin gene expression. In addition, mitochondrial phospholipids and fatty acids composition was altered with an increase in the PC/PE ratio and  content and a reduction in the MUFA/SFA ratio. These modifications in mitochondrial membrane composition are associated with a reduction in the enzymatic activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I and IV. In spite of these mitochondrial enzymatic alterations, skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration remained similar in SIRT3-M3 and control mice. Surprisingly, none of those metabolic alterations were detected in mitochondria from SIRT3-M1 mice. In conclusion, our data indicate a specific action of the shorter SIRT3 isoform on lipid mitochondrial membrane biosynthesis and functioning.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29413363>Safflower (n-6) and flaxseed (n-3) high-fat diets differentially regulate hypothalamic fatty  profiles, gene expression, and insulin signalling.</a></h2><p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have important signalling roles in the hypothalamus, a region of the brain that regulates whole-body  homeostasis. While evidence suggests that high PUFA intake can impact hypothalamic activity, the underlying molecular mechanisms regulated by essential dietary n-6 and n-3 PUFA (i.e., linoleic  and α-linolenic , respectively) remain poorly described in this brain region. To differentiate the roles of essential dietary PUFA on hypothalamic function, we fed male rats high-fat diets (35% kcal/d) containing either safflower (linoleic ) or flaxseed (α-linolenic ) oil for 2 months. Control rats were fed a low-fat (16% kcal/d) diet containing soybean oil. Hypothalamic fatty acids and gene expression were investigated by gas chromatography and microarray, respectively. Safflower-fed rats had higher total n-6 PUFA content due to increases in linoleic , , and osbond  compared to the other diet groups, while flaxseed-fed rats had higher total n-3 content due to increases in α-linolenic , eicosapentaenoic , docosapentaenoic , and docosahexaenoic . Safflower-fed rats showed augmented expression of genes related to hypothalamic insulin signalling compared to controls. This was mirrored by significant increases in phosphorylated AKT and AKT levels; indicative of increased PI(3)K/AKT pathway activity. These changes were not observed in the hypothalamus of flaxseed-fed rats. Our findings provide new molecular insights into how essential fatty acids influence the hypothalamus and, potentially, whole-body  homeostasis. This work also provides new knowledge to better understand the impact of essential fatty acids on metabolic and behavioral phenotypes.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This neurovascular coupling underlies blood oxygen level-dependent functional imaging signals, but its mechanism is controversial. Canonically, neurons release glutamate to activate metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) on astrocytes, evoking Ca release from internal stores, activating phospholipase A2 and generating vasodilatory  derivatives. However, adult astrocytes lack mGluR5, and knockout of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors that release Ca from stores does not affect neurovascular coupling. We now show that buffering astrocyte Ca inhibits neuronally evoked capillary dilation, that astrocyte [Ca] is raised not by release from stores but by entry through ATP-gated channels, and that Ca generates  via phospholipase D2 and diacylglycerol lipase rather than phospholipase A2. In contrast, dilation of arterioles depends on NMDA receptor activation and Ca-dependent NO generation by interneurons.

The aim of this study was to explore whether chronic administration of d-galactose (d-gal) can cause neuronal injury and oxidative damage, and to investigate the neuroprotective and antioxidative effects of the active components (UPNO-1) from Korean pine nut (Pinus koraiensis). Two dosing regimens were designed, one for the evaluation of preventive effects in which the rats were simultaneously administrated d-gal and UPNO-1/fishoil for 12 weeks, the other for the evaluation of therapeutic effects in which the rats were given d-gal for 8 weeks before treated with UPNO-1/selegiline for 8 weeks. The experimental results demonstrated that chronic administration of d-gal produced histopathological changes and increased neuronal apoptosis, and decreased significantly the activities of T-AOC, T-SOD and CAT. Additionally, a comprehensive metabolic profiling of d-gal-treated rats was performed for the first time to investigate the metabolic disorders in the hippocampus, cortex and plasma, and a total of 32 annotated metabolites were significantly increased or decreased in the modeled rats. Major disturbed metabolic pathways were fatty , glycerolphospholipid and  metabolic pathways. UPNO-1 significantly diminished neuronal apoptosis, ameliorated histopathological findings, and increased the activities of T-SOD and CAT but not T-AOC. Furthermore, UPNO-1 attenuated the decreased plasma levels of 3-oxooctanoic , l-tryptophan, 12-hydroxyheptadecanoic , lysophosphatidylcholine (16:0) (LPC(16:0)), LPC(18:3) and LPC(18:1) in the modeled rats.

The objective was to describe the fatty  composition of red blood cells (RBC) in breastfeed Nepali infants and a subsample of their mothers and to identify the main sources of fatty acids in the mother's diet, as well as the fatty  composition of breast milk.RBC fatty  composition was analyzed in a random sample of 303 infants and 72 mother, along with 68 breastmilk samples. Fatty  profiles of the most important dietary fat sources were analyzed. Information on mother's diet and intake of fat was collected by three 24-h dietary recalls.In infant RBC's, docosahexaenoic  (DHA) was the main n-3 fatty , and  (AA) was the major n-6 fatty . Total n-6 PUFA was three times higher than total n-3 PUFA. Height-for-age (HAZ) was positively associated with DHA status and AA status in multivariable models. The concentration of all fatty acids was higher in children, compared to mothers, except Total n-6 PUFA and Linoleic  (LA) where no differences were found. The mother's  intake from fat was 13% and cooking oil (sesame, mustard, soybean or sunflower oil) contributed 52% of the fat intake.RBC-DHA levels in both infants and mother was unexpected high taking into account few dietary DHA sources and the low DHA concentrations in breastmilk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31191095>The Effect of Exhaustive Exercise on Plasma Metabolic Profiles of Male and Female Rats.</a></h2><p>The objective of the study was to evaluate the alteration in biochemical composition and gender difference within exhaustive exercise in male and female rats using a metabolomics strategy. Sixty male and female rats were randomly assigned to control, exhaustive exercise and one-week recovery groups, respectively. The metabolic profiles of plasma were investigated by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and data further underwent orthogonal partial least-squares (OPLS) analysis. The current study found that gender was a significant determinant of the effects of exhaustive exercise on the cortisol, blood urea nitrogen, creatine kinase, and the ratio of reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione, whereas, no significant interaction effects between gender and exhaustive exercise were found on the levels of testosterone, malonaldehyde, reduced glutathione, oxidized glutathione and lactic dehydrogenase. In male rats, the altered metabolites within exhaustive exercise included increased tricarboxylic  cycle intermediates (citric , fumaric , butanedioic ), branch-chain amino acids (valine, leucine), fatty acids and metabolite (oleic , linoleic , 3-hydroxybutyric ), phosphate and decreased glucose, lactic , serine, and glutamic . In female rats, the levels of fatty acids and metabolite (linoleic , oleic , , 3-hydroxybutyric ), amino acids (valine, leucine, glutamic , 5-oxo-proline, methionine, ornithine), other metabolites urea, myo-inositol and phosphate were increased. The results indicated that exhaustive exercise increased the rates of  metabolism, glucose metabolism, amino  catabolism and fatty  metabolism in male rats, whereas, female rats showed an increased propensity to oxidize lipid and conserve carbohydrate and protein metabolism against physical stress. Disordered urea cycle and inositol metabolism also occurred in female rats with exhaustive exercise. Exhaustive exercise affected the balance of hormone adjustment and caused oxidative stress, subsequent cell membrane damage both in male and female rats. A significant gender-related difference in the metabolic profiles was also found between male and female rats within exhaustive exercise.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30782617>Effects of dietary fat on gut microbiota and faecal metabolites, and their relationship with cardiometabolic risk factors: a 6-month randomised controlled-feeding trial.</a></h2><p>To investigate whether diets differing in fat content alter the gut microbiota and faecal metabolomic profiles, and to determine their relationship with cardiometabolic risk factors in healthy adults whose diet is in a transition from a traditional low-fat diet to a diet high in fat and reduced in carbohydrate.In a 6-month randomised controlled-feeding trial, 217 healthy young adults (aged 18-35 years; body mass index <28 kg/m; 52% women) who completed the whole trial were included. All the foods were provided during the intervention period. The three isocaloric diets were: a lower-fat diet (fat 20% ), a moderate-fat diet (fat 30% ) and a higher-fat diet (fat 40% ). The effects of the dietary interventions on the gut microbiota, faecal metabolomics and plasma inflammatory factors were investigated.The lower-fat diet was associated with increased α-diversity assessed by the Shannon index (p=0.03), increased abundance of  (p=0.007) and  (p=0.04), whereas the higher-fat diet was associated with increased  (p=0.04),  (p<0.001) and decreased  (p=0.04). The concentration of total short-chain fatty acids was significantly decreased in the higher-fat diet group in comparison with the other groups (p<0.001). The cometabolites p-cresol and indole, known to be associated with host metabolic disorders, were decreased in the lower-fat diet group. In addition, the higher-fat diet was associated with faecal enrichment in  and the lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathway as well as elevated plasma proinflammatory factors after the intervention.Higher-fat consumption by healthy young adults whose diet is in a state of nutrition transition appeared to be associated with unfavourable changes in gut microbiota, faecal metabolomic profiles and plasma proinﬂammatory factors, which might confer adverse consequences for long-term health outcomes.; Results.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

The fungus was grown at 20°C temperature for four days initially followed by 12°C temperature for next five days. The basal medium contained starch, yeast extract, and a blend of linseed oil (LSO) and garden cress oil (GCO) in the ratio 1 : 1. Results of the study revealed that, after nine days of total incubation period, the enhancement of biomass was up to 16.7 g/L dry weight with a total lipid content of 55.4% (v/w). Enrichment of omega-3 fatty acids indicated a significant increase in fatty  bioconversion (ALA 32.2 ± 0.42%, EPA 7.9 ± 0.1%, and DHA 4.09 ± 0.2%) by 2.5-fold. The two-stage temperature cultivation alters the fatty  profile due to activation of the desaturase enzyme in the cellular levels due to which  (AA) content reduced significantly. It can be concluded that  CFR-GV15 is a fungal culture suitable for commercial production of PUFAs with enriched EPA and DHA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28146136>Consumption of Red Meat, but Not Cooking Oils High in Polyunsaturated Fat, Is Associated with Higher  Status in Singapore Chinese Adults.</a></h2><p>High  (AA; 20:4 n - 6) status may have adverse effects on inflammation and risk of cardiovascular diseases. Concerns about high intake of n - 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are based on the premise that endogenous conversion from linoleic  (LA; 18:2 n - 6) is an important source of AA, but few population-based studies have investigated dietary determinants of AA status. In this study, we examined habitual food consumption in relation to plasma concentrations of AA and other PUFAs in population-based studies. We used cross-sectional data from 269 healthy, ethnic Chinese participants (25-80 years old) with contrasting intakes of fish and red meat from the Singapore Prospective Study Program and 769 healthy participants (44-74 years old) from the Singapore Chinese Health Study as a validation set. Multivariable linear regression was used to examine PUFA intake (% ) and food sources of PUFA (fish, red meat, poultry, soy and cooking oils) in relation to plasma PUFAs (AA, LA, dihomo-gamma-linolenic  (DGLA; 20:3 n - 6), alpha-linolenic  (ALA; 18:3 n - 3), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA; 20:5 n - 3), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA; 22:6 n - 3)) concentrations. Higher intake of red meat was associated with higher plasma AA concentrations. High intake of PUFA or PUFA-rich oils was associated with higher plasma ALA but not with plasma AA. Higher intakes of soy were associated with higher ALA and fish with higher DHA and EPA concentrations. These associations were statistically significant (p < 0.05) in both studies. Red meat consumption, but not PUFA or PUFA-rich cooking oil, was associated with circulating AA suggesting that intake of pre-formed AA rather than LA is an important determinant of AA status. A diet high in fish, soy products and polyunsaturated cooking oil, and low in red meat may be associated with an optimal plasma profile of PUFA in this Chinese population.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30383073>Omega-3 and Omega-6 salivary fatty acids as markers of dietary fat quality: A cross-sectional study in Argentina.</a></h2><p>The use of saliva for analyzing biological compounds has recently been expanded. The aim of this study was to analyze the correlation between specific dietary sources of n3 and n6 fatty acids (FA) and their salivary levels to evaluate their role as intake markers. Seventynine healthy volunteers were included. A validated food frequency questionnaire was used for data collection and Interfood v.1.3 software was employed to quantify food intake. Salivary samples were collected following international standards and FA profile was determined by gas liquidchromatography. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed for dependent variables (salivary FA profile) to detect independent associations with n3 and n6 FA food source intake, adjusted by age, gender, bodymass index, total  intake, regular exercise, alcohol intake and smoking. Salivary concentrations of alphalinolenic  (ALA) 18:3 n3 were significantly associated with nuts intake (β=0.05, 95% CI 0.020.07, p=0.04). Salivary concentrations of linoleic  (LA) 18:2 n6 and  (AA) 20:4 n6 were associated with the intake of n6 vegetable oils and red meat, cold meat and viscera (β=0.80, 95% CI 0.060.09 p=0.03; β=0.40, 95% CI 0.300.50, p=0.02, respectively). This study supports the hypothesis that salivary concentrations of n3 and n6 FA are related to food intake.

The intake of LCO3-PUFAs has been reported to contribute to bone metabolism. We aimed to investigate the relationships between dietary intakes of LCO3-PUFAs and bone mineral density (BMD) in Spanish women aged 20-79 years old. A total of 1865 female subjects (20-79 years old) were enrolled, and lumbar (L2, L3, L3 and total spine), hip (femoral neck (FN), femoral trochanter (FT) and Ward's triangle (WT)) bone mineral density (BMD) were measured by dual  X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Dietary intakes of total , calcium, vitamin D, alpha-linolenic  (ALA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA), and n-6 fatty acids (linoleic  (LA) and  (AA)) were assessed by a self-administered food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Spearman's rank correlations between LCO3-PUFAs and BMD were estimated. Partial correlations controlling for age, weight, height, dietary calcium, vitamin D, menopausal status and  were calculated. A multiple regression analysis was computed to assess significant associations with BMD in this population. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, there were positive correlations between ALA, EPA and DHA intake and BMD. According to the WHO diagnosis criteria for osteoporosis, in this population of normal and osteopenic women, the dietary intake of ALA was also significantly associated with BMD at the hip. In normal women, the dietary intake of DHA was also significantly associated with BMD at the lumbar spine. No significant associations between LCO3-PUFAs and BMD were detected in the lumbar spine of osteopenic or osteoporotic women. The dietary intake of LCO3-PUFAs was positively associated with BMD in Spanish women at both the hips and the lumbar spine. We highlight that the intake of LCO3-PUFAs is not significantly associated with BMD in osteoporotic women; however, the intake of LCO3-PUFAs seems to be positively associated with BMD at both the hips and the lumbar spine in normal and osteopenic women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30175775>Multiple Cellular Transport and Binding Processes of Unesterified Docosahexaenoic  in Outer Blood-Retinal Barrier Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cells.</a></h2><p>Docosahexaenoic  (DHA, 22 : 6) is an essential omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty  that plays a pivotal role in vision. The purpose of this study was to clarify the cellular uptake and binding processes of free and protein-bound unesterified DHA in retinal pigment epithelial cell (RPE) line ARPE-19 as a model of the human outer blood-retinal barrier and isolated porcine RPE cell fractions. Uptake of free [C]DHA by ARPE-19 cells was saturable with a Michaelis-Menten constant of 283 µM, and was significantly inhibited by eicosapentaenoic , , and linoleic , but not by oleic . Further, the uptakes of [C]DHA associated with retinol-binding protein ([C]DHA-RBP), [C]DHA associated with low-density lipoprotein ([C]DHA-LDL) and [C]DHA associated with bovine serum albumin ([C]DHA-BSA) in ARPE-19 cells increased time-dependently at 37°C, and were significantly reduced at 4°C, suggesting the involvement of -dependent transport processes. [C]DHA-LDL uptake by ARPE-19 cells was significantly inhibited by excess unlabeled LDL, but not by an inhibitor of scavenger receptor B type I. Fatty  transport protein (FATP) 2 and 4 mRNAs were expressed in ARPE-19 cells, and [C]DHA uptake was observed in FATP2- and FATP4-expressing Xenopus oocytes. Photo-reactive crosslinking and mass spectrometry analyses identified 65-kDa retinal pigment epithelium-specific protein (RPE65) as a DHA-binding protein in porcine RPE cell membrane fractions. Thus, RPE cells possess multiple cellular transport/binding processes for unesterified DHA, involving at least partly FATP2, FATP4, LDL, RBP, and RPE65.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29384333>Intake ratio and major food sources of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids in Korea: a study based on the sixth Korea national health and nutrition examination survey (2013-2014).</a></h2><p>In addition to the intake ratio of omega 6 (n-6) to omega 3 (n-3) fatty acids, their intake amount has an effect on health. This study evaluated the n-6:n-3 intake ratio as well as the food sources and association of these fatty acids with demographic characteristics based on sixth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data.This study included 13,937 participants from the survey. The weighted mean intake and major food groups of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids were determined. The 10 chief food sources of n-3 and n-6 fatty  were expressed as percent contribution to total intake.α- Linolenic  constituted approximately 80% of total n-3 intake, followed by docosahexaenoic  (10.5%) and eicosapentaenoic  (6.1%). Linoleic  constituted 97% of total n-6 intake. After adjustment for cofactors (age, sex, and  intake), education level (p<0.01), alcohol consumption frequency (p<0.05) and monthly income (p<0.01) were significant variables determining n-3 and n-6 FA intake by Korean people. The average n- 6:n-3 intake ratio was 7.49:1. The major source of α-linolenic  and linoleic  was soybean oil, whereas that of docosahexaenoic  and eicosapentaenoic  was mackerel. Pork (70.0%) and egg (38.7%) were the major food sources of  and dihomo-γ-linolenic , respectively.Monthly income, alcohol consumption frequency, and education level significantly affected n-3 FA intake. The dietary n-6: n-3 intake ratio in Korea is 7.49:1; however, eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic  intake remains inadequate (0.27 g/day).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31255640>Biosynthetic pathway of  in Spodoptera exigua in response to bacterial challenge.</a></h2><p>Eicosanoids play crucial roles in mediating insect immune responses. In vertebrates, phospholipase A (PLA) releases  (AA) from phospholipids (PLs) for biosynthesis of various eicosanoids. However, little AA is found in PLs of lepidopteran insects. Spodoptera exigua, a lepidopteran insect, is known to use eicosanoids to mediate immunity. Although AA was not detected in PLs of hemocytes and fat body (two immune tissues) of naïve larvae, it was detected at small but significant level after bacterial infection, suggesting induction of AA biosynthesis for immunity. Based on a mammalian AA biosynthetic pathway, this study hypothesizes that AA is synthesized from C18 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) precursor by subsequent desaturation and elongation reactions because PLs of S. exigua larvae are rich in linoleic . After inhibiting PLA activity to prevent release of free fatty acids, different PUFA precursors were injected to S. exigua larvae followed by assessment of eicosanoid-mediated cellular immune response. ω-6 PUFAs were effective in inducing immune response whereas α-linolenic  (an ω-3 PUFA) was not. Several fatty acyl desaturases (SeDESs) have been predicted from S. exigua transcriptomes. Specific inhibitors against Δ5 or Δ6 DESs inhibited eicosanoid-mediated immune responses. Furthermore, RNA interference (RNAi) specific to Δ5 or Δ6 DES genes significantly suppressed eicosanoid-mediated immune responses. Four very long chain fatty  elongase genes (SeEloV-A ∼ SeEloV-D) were predicted. Among respective RNAi treatments of these genes, only one RNAi treatment specific to type 5 elongase (SeEloV-B) suppressed eicosanoid-mediated immune response. These results suggest that S. exigua larvae can synthesize AA from linoleic  via Δ5- and Δ6-desaturations by SeDESs along with chain elongation by SeEloV-B. Finally, this study showed significant fitness cost of uncontrolled AA biosynthesis. AA injection alone without bacterial challenge significantly induced both cellular and humoral immune responses. This unnecessary  expense due to free AA resulted in reduced pupal size and decreased adult egg production. The detrimental effect of free AA explains physiological significance of little AA content in lepidopteran insects except for life-or-death situation such as pathogen infection.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there are concerns that oral fish oil, which is a good source of DHA, may adversely affect growth of preterm infants, as it decreases  (ARA). It has been about ten years since fish oil was added to the fat blend of intravenous (IV) lipid emulsions (LE) but information on growth and other clinical outcomes of preterm infants is still scarce. We studied the effect of fish oil containing IV LE vs standard IV LE on growth in a large cohort of preterm infants who received routine parenteral nutrition (PN).We retrospectively reviewed growth data of 546 preterm infants with a birth weight (BW) < 1250 g consecutively admitted to our NICU between Oct-2008 and Jun-2017 who received PN starting from the first day of life. Individual patients received only one of 5 commercially available IV LE. For the purpose of this study we grouped the patients who received the fish oil containing LE (IV-FO) and those who received conventional LE (CNTR). We compared PN and enteral nutrition (EN) intakes, and growth from birth to 36 weeks post-menstrual age (W PMA).Demographics, birth data and the incidence of the main complications of prematurity were similar between the two groups (IV-FO: n = 240, Gestational age (GA) 197 ± 16 d, BW 942 ± 181 g; CNTR: n = 237, GA 199 ± 17 d, BW 960 ± 197 g). No difference was found in PN and EN  and macronutrient intakes from birth to 36W PMA, as well as in the proportion of human milk to infant milk formula. Weight gain from the regained BW to 36W PMA was slightly but significantly higher in IV-FO group: 17.3 ± 2.8 and 16.8 ± 2.7 g∙kg∙d, IV-FO and CNTR respectively (p = 0.03). There was no difference in length gain and head growth nor in body size at 36W PMA between the two groups.The use of IV fish oil did not negatively affect weight gain in a cohort of preterm infants. Large randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the effect of IV fish oil on the complication of prematurity and on selected domains of infant development.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

This property could be useful in the treatment of obesity, and nutritional aspects are relevant to this important issue. Using hMADS cells as a human cell model which undergoes a white to a brite adipocyte conversion, we had shown previously that , the major metabolite of the essential nutrient Ω6-linoleic , plays a major role in this process. Its metabolites PGE2 and PGF2 alpha inhibit this process via a calcium-dependent pathway, whereas in contrast carbaprostacyclin (cPGI2), a stable analog of prostacyclin, activates white to brite adipocyte conversion. Herein, we show that cPGI2 generates via its cognate cell-surface receptor IP-R, a cyclic AMP-signaling pathway involving PKA activity which in turn induces the expression of UCP1. In addition, cPGI2 activates the pathway of nuclear receptors of the PPAR family, i.e. PPARα and PPARγ, which act separately from IP-R to up-regulate the expression of key genes involved in the function of brite adipocytes. Thus dual pathways are playing in concert for the occurrence of a browning process of human white adipocytes. These results make prostacyclin analogs as a new class of interesting molecules to treat obesity and associated diseases.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the transcriptome and biomineralization responses of Pinctada fucata to elevated CO2 (pH 7.8 and pH 7.5) and temperature (25 °C and 31 °C) are investigated. Increases in CO2 and temperature induced significant changes in gene expression, alkaline phosphatase activity, net calcification rates and relative calcium content, whereas no changes are observed in the shell ultrastructure. "Ion and -base regulation" related genes and "amino  metabolism" pathway respond to the elevated CO2 (pH 7.8), suggesting that P. fucata implements a compensatory -base mechanism to mitigate the effects of low pH. Additionally, "anti-oxidation"-related genes and "Toll-like receptor signaling", " metabolism", "lysosome" and "other glycan degradation" pathways exhibited responses to elevated temperature (25 °C and 31 °C), suggesting that P. fucata utilizes anti-oxidative and lysosome strategies to alleviate the effects of temperature stress. These responses are -consuming processes, which can lead to a decrease in biomineralization capacity. This study therefore is important for understanding the mechanisms by which pearl oysters respond to changing environments and predicting the effects of global climate change on pearl aquaculture.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31052597>Effects of Platycodins Folium on Depression in Mice Based on a UPLC-Q/TOF-MS Serum Assay and Hippocampus Metabolomics.</a></h2><p>Major depressive disorder (MDD), also known as depression, is a state characterized by low mood and aversion to activity. Platycodins Folium (PF) is the dried leaf of Platycodon grandiflorum, with anti-inflammatory and antioxidative activities. Our previous research suggested that PF was rich in flavonoids, phenols, organic acids, triterpenoid saponins, coumarins and terpenoids. This study aimed to investigate the antidepressant effect of PF using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depressive mice. Several behavior tests (sucrose preference test (SPT), forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST)) and biochemical parameters (IL-6, TNF-α and SOD levels) were used to evaluate the antidepressive effect of PF on LPS-induced depression model. Furthermore, a UPLC-Q/TOF-MS-based metabolomics approach was applied to explore the latent mechanism of PF in attenuating depression. As a result, a total of 21 and 11 metabolites that potentially contribute to MDD progress and PF treatment were identified in serum and hippocampus, respectively. The analysis of metabolic pathways revealed that lipid metabolism, amino  metabolism,  metabolism,  metabolism, glutathione metabolism and inositol phosphate metabolism were disturbed in a model of mice undergoing MDD and PF treatment. These results help us to understand the pathogenesis of depression in depth, and to discover targets for clinical diagnosis and treatment. They also provide the possibility of developing PF into an anti-depressantive agent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31430683>Metabolomics analysis of Xanthoceras sorbifolia husks protection of rats against Alzheimer's disease using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>The promising effect of Xanthoceras sorbifolia Bunge husks against Alzheimer's disease has attracted more and more attention; however, its therapeutic mechanism has been unclear. A metabolomics study of the husks on rat serum and brain was carried out. Cognitive impairment of rats was induced by D-galactose and amyloid β, and the result was evaluated by Morris water maze test and brain histological analysis. The metabolite profiling was performed through ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Twelve potential biomarkers were identified in the rat serum and nineteen in the brain. All the biomarkers could be classified as amino acids, lipids, purines and bile acids. Both the husk extract and control drug, huperzine A, showed protective effect against the cognitive disorder induced by amyloid β, however, the husk extract exhibited significant effect on more targets, which included , cholic , uric  and citric  etc., indicating the regulation of the husks of more pathways including neuroinflammation,  metabolism and antioxidant ability. Triterpenoid saponins and polyphenols in the husks may contribute to the regulation of these pathways.

However, details of the kinetic mechanism of 5-LOX are still obscure. In this Letter, we investigated the kinetic isotope effect (KIE) of 5-LOX with its physiological substrate,  (AA). The observed KIE is 20±4 on kcat and 17±2 on kcat/KM at 25°C indicating a non-classical reaction mechanism. The observed rates show slight temperature dependence at ambient temperatures ranging from 4 to 35°C. Also, we observed low Arrhenius prefactor ratio (AH/AD=0.21) and a small change in activation  (Ea(D)-Ea(H)=3.6J/mol) which suggests that 5-LOX catalysis involves tunneling as a mechanism of H-transfer. The measured KIE for 5-LOX involves a change in regioselectivity in response to deuteration at position C7, resulting in H-abstraction form C10 and formation of 8-HETE. The viscosity experiments influence the (H)kcat, but not (D)kcat. However the overall kcat/KM is not affected for labeled or unlabeled AA, suggesting that either the product release or conformational rearrangement might be involved in dictating kinetics of 5-LOX at saturating conditions. Investigation of available crystal structures suggests the role of active site residues (F421, Q363 and L368) in regulating the donor-acceptor distances, thus affecting H-transfer as well as regiospecificity. In summary, our study shows that that the H-abstraction is the rate limiting step for 5-LOX and that the observed KIE of 5-LOX is masked by a change in regioselectivity.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Although a number of physiological, pathological, and functional parameters have been investigated, only scarce information regarding the changes of small metabolites in the plasma has been reported, and this lack of information may cause poor MI diagnosis and treatment. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the metabolic profiles of plasma samples from MI patients to identify potential disease biomarkers and to study the pathology of MI. Metabolic profiles of the plasma of 30 MI patients and 30 controls were obtained using ultra-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The resulting data were processed using pattern recognition approaches, including principal component analysis and partial least squares-discriminant analysis, to identify the metabolites that differed between the groups. Significant differences in the plasma levels of the following 10 metabolites were observed in the MI patients compared with the controls: phosphatidylserine, C16-sphingosine, -methyl  amide, -(2-methoxyethyl)  amide, linoleamidoglycerophosphate choline, lyso-PC (C18:2), lyso-PC (C16:0), lyso-PC (C18:1), , and linoleic . The changes in these 10 biomarkers indicated perturbations of  metabolism, phospholipid metabolism, and fatty  metabolism in the MI patients.

Although the close relationship of brain glia known as astrocytes with cerebral blood vessels has long been recognized, it is only recently that these cells have been demonstrated to translate information on the activity level and  demands of neurons to the vasculature. In particular, astrocytes respond to elevations in extracellular glutamate as a consequence of synaptic transmission through the activation of group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors. These Gq-protein coupled receptors elevate intracellular calcium via IP3 signaling. A close examination of astrocyte endfeet calcium signals has been shown to cause either vasoconstriction or vasodilation. Common to both vasomotor responses is the generation of  in astrocytes by calcium sensitive phospholipase A2. Vasoconstriction ensues from the conversion of  to 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic , while vasodilation ensues from the production of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids or prostaglandins. Factors that determine whether constrictor or dilatory pathways predominate include brain oxygen, lactate, adenosine as well as nitric oxide. Changing the oxygen level itself leads to many downstream changes that facilitate the switch from vasoconstriction at high oxygen to vasodilation at low oxygen. These findings highlight the importance of astrocytes as sensors of neural activity and metabolism to coordinate the delivery of essential nutrients via the blood to the working cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27440456>Periodontal condition in relation to intake of omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids.</a></h2><p>To examine whether the intake of omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) is associated with periodontal condition.The study population consisted of non-smoking, non-diabetic and non-rheumatoid individuals in the Health 2000 Survey in Finland. Analyses were made in two age groups: 30-49 years (n = 1212) and 50-79 years (n = 980). Clinically determined sextants with gingival bleeding and teeth with periodontal pockets were used as outcome variables. Dietary data were collected by a validated food frequency questionnaire. -adjusted intakes of  (AA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA), omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs, as well as ratios of EPA/AA and of DHA/AA, and omega-3/omega-6 PUFAs were used as exposures. Prevalence rate ratios were estimated using Poisson regression models.In this population, there were no statistically significant associations between the examined omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids or their ratios and the periodontal outcome variables.This cross-sectional study provided evidence that individual omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids, their subclasses or ratios are not associated with periodontal health among a non-diabetic, non-rheumatoid and non-smoking population.© 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

In this study, a novel snake protein, metalloproteinase SP, was successfully isolated from the venom of   by multi-gel chromatography. The isolated protein exhibits anti-platelet aggregation activity. Animal experiments showed that it exhibited defibration, anticoagulation, and antithrombotic effects and contributes to improved blood rheology and antiplatelet aggregation. In vivo experiments demonstrated that it prolonged clotting time, partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, thrombin time, fibrinogen time and reduced fibrinogen content of mice. Also, metalloproteinase SP inhibited carrageenan-induced tail thrombosis, ADP-induced acute pulmonary embolism, and ADP,  (AA), or collagen-induced platelet aggregation. In vitro experiments showed that the protein cleaved the α, β, and γ chains of fibrinogen. Metabolomic analysis upon metalloproteinase SP treatment revealed that 14 metabolites, which are mainly involved in phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis, responded to metalloproteinase SP treatment. In summary, the isolated snake venom protein inhibits formation of acute pulmonary embolism probably through regulating and restoring perturbed , lipid, and amino  metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29879641>Conformational and vibrational studies of , light and temperature effects on ATR-FTIR spectra.</a></h2><p> (AA) (cis,cis,cis,cis-5,8,11,14-Eicosatetraenoic ) is an omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) constituent of the phospholipids of cell membranes. The conformational behavior of AA in the gas phase was investigated by means of density functional theory (DFT) using B3LYP method with 6-311++G(d,p) basis set. Theoretical calculations on the structures and infrared spectra of monomer conformers and dimer form of the most stable monomer conformer of AA were performed. Vibrational assignment of the fundamental modes was made based on calculated potential  distribution (PED). Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectrum of AA in liquid phase was recorded in the region 4000-450 cm. The theoretical spectrum of dimer AA in gas phase is in reasonably good agreement with the experimental liquid phase spectrum. The double bonds in unsaturated fatty acids are prone to oxidation. Oxidized PUFAs lead to adverse health effects. The effects of daylight and temperature on the oxidative stability of AA were investigated using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. The analysis reveals that the light and thermal treatment induce cis-trans isomerization in AA.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

[b]Materials and method. [/b]The experiment was carried out for 3 months on 72 growing male Wistar rats divided into 5 groups. Animals were fed ad libitum on a diet with an  value of 350 kcal/100 g, in which 4.5% of the  was provided by protein. In the control diet, 20% of the  was provided by protein. Two groups were fed the diet enriched with vitamin B2. The two groups of tested animals were trained for 5 days a week. [b]Results.[/b] LP diet caused a decrease in α-linolenic  (ALA) after 30 days, and a decrease in docosahexaenoic  (DHA) after 60 days of experiment, compared with rats fed the control diet. After 60 and 90 days of the experiment, a significant decrease was noted in  (AA) in serum of trained rats, compared with sedentary rats fed the LP diet. Physical activity increased LA (mainly on day 30), EPA (on day 90) and reduced AA content (on day 90) in serum of rats fed the LP diet. B2 supplementation in the trained LP group did not change the EPA and AA dependence; however, there was a decrease in LA content in comparison to the non-supplemented trained group. [b]Conclusions.

The aim of this paper was to summarize the formula composition recommended for 6-12-month-old infants by a Chinese expert group.Formula composition recommendations for 6-12-month-old infants were devised by a Chinese expert group based on a detailed systematic review, which included nutrient intake, nutrient content of Chinese women's breast milk, and the latest adequate intake and tolerable upper intake levels, also referencing the Codex Alimentarius recommendations and those of other countries and considering the practice in products on the market.Compared with current standards, it was recommended that most compositional requirements be modified, including decreasing the maximum  density from 85 to 75 kcal/100 mL, decreasing the protein content in milk-based formula from 2.9-5.0 g/100 kcal to 1.8-3.5 g/100 kcal, increasing the minimum content of lipids from 2.9 g/100 kcal to 3.5 g/100 kcal, providing the maximum amount of vitamins and minerals (including vitamin E, vitamin K, thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B-6, vitamin B-12, niacin, folic , pantothenic , vitamin C, biotin, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, and iodine), and changing the content of optional components such as taurine, docosahexaenoic , and .These nutrient standard modifications based on recent evidence are expected to enhance feeding practices and further guarantee the health of 6-12-month-old infants in China.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29670527>Comparative Metabolomics Analysis of Cervicitis in Human Patients and a Phenol Mucilage-Induced Rat Model Using Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Cervicitis is an exceedingly common gynecological disorder that puts women at high risk of sexually transmitted infections and induces a series of reproductive system diseases. This condition also has a significant impact on quality of life and is commonly misdiagnosed in clinical practice due to its complicated pathogenesis. In the present study, we performed non-targeted plasma metabolomics analysis of cervicitis in both plasma samples obtained from human patients and plasma samples from a phenol mucilage induced rat model of cervicitis, using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry. In addition to differences in histopathology, we identified differences in the metabolic profile between the cervicitis and control groups using unsupervised principal component analysis and orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis. These results demonstrated changes in plasma metabolites, with 27 and 22 potential endogenous markers identified in rat and human samples, respectively. The metabolic pathway analysis showed that linoleic , , ether lipid, and glycerophospholipid metabolism are key metabolic pathways involved in cervicitis.

P. purpureum, one of the red microalgae acknowledged as a promising accumulator of ARA, was chosen as the target algae in the present research. Effects of sodium bicarbonate (0.04-1.2 g/L), temperature (25, 30 and 33 °C) and phosphate (0.00-0.14 g/L) on biomass yield, total fatty acids (TFA) and  (ARA) accumulation were investigated systemically. NaHCO3 dose of 0.8 g/L and moderate temperature of 30 °C were preferred. In addition, TFA and ARA production were significantly enhanced by an appropriate concentration of phosphate, and the highest TFA yield of 666.38 mg/L and ARA yield of 159.74 mg/L were obtained at a phosphate concentration of 0.035 g/L. Interestingly, with phosphate concentration continuing to fall, UFA/TFA and ARA/EPA ratios were increased accordingly, suggesting that phosphate limitation promoted unsaturated fatty acids and  biosynthesis. Low concentration of phosphate may be favored to increase the enzymatic activities of ∆6-desaturase, which played a key role in catalyzing the conversion of C16:0 to C18:2, and thus the selectivity of UFA increased. Meanwhile, the increase of ARA selectivity could be attributed to ω6 pathway promotion and ∆17-desaturase activity inhibition with phosphate limitation. Phosphate limitation strategy enhanced unsaturated fatty acids and ARA biosynthesis in P. purpureum, and can be applied in commercial scale manufacturing and commercialization of ARA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29518347>Dietary genistein supplementation in laying broiler breeder hens alters the development and metabolism of offspring embryos as revealed by hepatic transcriptome analysis.</a></h2><p>Genistein (GEN) is a type of isoflavone mainly derived from soy products. In this experiment, we added 40 and 400 mg/kg GEN to the diet of laying broiler breeder hens to clarify the maternal effects of GEN on the development and metabolism of chick embryos. GEN treatment at 40 mg/kg increased embryonic length, weight, and liver index, as well as the width of the proliferative zone in the tibial growth plate of chick embryos. Gene ontology (GO) cluster analysis of the hepatic transcriptome showed that GEN treatment promoted embryonic development and cell proliferation. Low-dose GEN treatment increased insulin growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)3 mRNA expression in the embryonic liver, whereas high-dose GEN treatment increased IGFBP5 expression and activated the apoptosis and protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathways. Furthermore, adding supplemental GEN to the diet of hens promoted the glycolysis process in the embryonic liver through the insulin-signaling pathway, upregulated target genes (phosphoglucomutase-2, hexokinase 1, dihydroxyacetone phosphate by aldolase, phosphofructokinase, platelet, and enolase 2), and enhanced the transport of carboxylic acids and cholesterol and the synthesis of unsaturated fatty  () in the embryonic liver through upregulation of liver X receptor, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1, and patatin-like phospholipase A. Additionally, GEN treatment increased fatty  β-oxidation and Na/K-ATPase activity in the embryonic liver through activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs; PPARα and PPARδ) and the AMPK signaling pathway, which could provide  for embryonic development. In addition, GEN treatment in hens increased superoxide dismutase activity and metallothionein expression in the chick embryonic liver and promoted lymphocyte proliferation through upregulation of mRNA expression of CDKN1A, IL12RB1, Sox11, PRKAR1A, PRKCQ, and TCF3. The improved immunity and antioxidant capacity, as a result of maternal GEN effects, was conducive to embryonic development. In summary, the addition of GEN to the diet of laying broiler breeder hens significantly promoted the development and metabolism of chick embryos.-Lv, Z., Fan, H., Zhang, B., Ning, C., Xing, K., Guo, Y.

We developed bio-flocculation and incubation methods for the marine alga,  CCMP1779, and the oleaginous fungus,  AG77, resulting in increased oil productivity.By growing separately and then combining the cells, the  mycelium could efficiently capture  due to an intricate cellular interaction between the two species leading to bio-flocculation. Use of a high-salt culture medium induced accumulation of triacylglycerol (TAG) and enhanced the contents of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) including  and docosahexaenoic  in . To increase TAG productivity in the alga, we developed an effective, reduced nitrogen-supply regime based on ammonium in environmental photobioreactors. Under optimized conditions,  produced high levels of TAG that could be indirectly monitored by following chlorophyll content. Combining  and  to initiate bio-flocculation yielded high levels of TAG and total fatty acids, with ~ 15 and 22% of total dry weight (DW), respectively, as well as high levels of PUFAs. Genetic engineering of  for higher TAG content in nutrient-replete medium was accomplished by overexpressing , a gene encoding the type II acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 5. Combined with bio-flocculation, this approach led to increased production of TAG under nutrient-replete conditions (~ 10% of DW) compared to the wild type (~ 6% of DW).The combined use of  and  with available genomes and genetic engineering tools for both species opens up new avenues to improve biofuel productivity and allows for the engineering of polyunsaturated fatty acids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28670342>5-Aminolevulinic  promotes  biosynthesis in the red microalga .</a></h2><p>The microalga  within Rhodophyta abundantly produces several valuable proteins, polysaccharides, pigments and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty ; it is especially effective in accumulating  (ARA). However, this high ARA yield is always achieved in conditions unfavourable for cell growth. In this study, we present a method for obtaining desirable ARA levels from  while simultaneously promoting cell growth using appropriate concentrations of the growth hormone 5-Aminolevulinic  (5-ALA).Both the biomass and the ARA content of  were enhanced by stimulation with 20 mg/L 5-ALA, leading to an optimal ARA yield of 170.32 mg/L-a 70.82% increase compared with control conditions. This ARA yield is the highest ever reported for microalgae. Based on variations in the fatty  composition, total lipids, total proteins, total carbohydrates and pigment content during the cultivation period, we propose that the accumulation of ARA stimulated by 5-ALA occurs at the expense of other UFAs and total proteins, which may be related to decreased zeaxanthin. Lipidomic analysis revealed that triacylglycerols (TAGs) accounted for 47.5 ± 3.6% of all detected lipids, followed by phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG). As the levels of the most abundant TAGs increased under 5-ALA promotion and because 78.1 ± 3.4% (by weight) of detected TAG-branched chains contained ARA, the increase of ARA was mainly caused by TAG accumulation.This work demonstrated a simple and effective strategy to promote both biomass and ARA yield in  by introducing a small amount of 5-ALA. These results are helpful for understanding the microalgae metabolic pathways affected by phytohormones and for guiding the development of bioproducts from microalgae.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28993239>Regulation of NADPH oxidase NOX4 by delta iodolactone (IL-δ) in thyroid cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Iodine is not used only by the thyroid to synthesize thyroid hormones but also directly influences a number of thyroid parameters such as thyroid proliferation and function. Several iodinated lipids, biosynthesized by the thyroid, were postulated as intermediaries in the action of iodide. Among these, iodolactone (IL-δ) and 2-iodohexadecanal (2-IHDA) have shown to inhibit several thyroid parameters. The antiproliferative effect of IL-δ is not restricted to the thyroid gland. IL-δ exhibits anti-tumor properties in breast cancer, neuroblastoma, glioblastoma, melanoma and lung carcinoma cells suggesting that IL-δ could be used as a chemotherapeutic agent. Moreover in a colon cancer cell line (HT-29), IL-δ induced cell death, and this effect was mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The aim of the present study was to analyze the sources of reactive oxygen species induced by IL-δ and to explore the contribution of ROS induced by IL-δ on cell proliferation and apoptosis.Cancer thyroid follicular (WRO) and papilar (TPC-1) cells lines were treated with IL-δ. Proliferation and apoptosis was analyzed. IL-δ caused a significant loss of cell viability on WRO and TPC-1 cells in a concentration dependent manner and induced apoptosis after 3 h of treatment. Furthermore, IL-δ (10 μM) increased ROS production (39% WRO and 20% TPC-1). The concomitant treatment of WRO and TPC-1 cells with Trolox or NAC plus IL-δ abrogated the augment of ROS induced by IL-δ exposure. Additionally Trolox and NAC reversed the effect of IL-δ on cell proliferation and apoptosis. Only in WRO cells IL-δ upregulates NADPH oxidase NOX4 expression, and siRNA targeted knock-down of NOX4 attenuates ROS production, apoptosis (p < 0.05) and the inhibitory effect of IL-δ on cell proliferation and PCNA expression (p < 0.05).The antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effect of IL-δ is mediated by different mechanisms and pathway involving different sources of ROS generation depending on the cellular context.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, inhibition of the release of oxidized fatty acyl chains from CL by the calcium-independent phospholipase Aγ (iPLAγ)-selective inhibitor (R)-BEL suggested that iPLAγ is responsible for the hydrolysis of oxidized CL and subsequent signaling mediated by the released oxidized fatty acids. However, chemical inhibition by BEL is subject to off-target pharmacologic effects. Accordingly, to unambiguously determine the role of iPLAγ in the hydrolysis of oxidized CL, we compared alterations in oxidized CLs and the release of oxidized aliphatic chains from CL in experiments with purified recombinant iPLAγ, germ-line iPLAγ mice, cardiac myocyte-specific iPLAγ transgenic mice, and wild-type mice. Using charge-switch high mass accuracy LC-MS/MS with selected reaction monitoring and product ion accurate masses, we demonstrated that iPLAγ is the major enzyme responsible for the release of oxidized aliphatic chains from CL. Our results also indicated that iPLAγ selectively hydrolyzes 9-hydroxy-octadecenoic  in comparison to 13-hydroxy-octadecenoic  from oxidized CLs. Moreover, oxidative stress (ADP, NADPH, and Fe) resulted in the robust production of oxidized CLs in intact mitochondria from iPLAγ mice. In sharp contrast, oxidized CLs were readily hydrolyzed in mitochondria from wild-type mice during oxidative stress. Finally, we demonstrated that CL activates the iPLAγ-mediated hydrolysis of  from phosphatidylcholine, thereby integrating the production of lipid messengers from different lipid classes in mitochondria. Collectively, these results demonstrate the integrated roles of CL and iPLAγ in lipid second-messenger production and mitochondrial bioenergetics during oxidative stress.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049566>Metabolomics Reveal Altered Postprandial Lipid Metabolism After a High-Carbohydrate Meal in Men at High Genetic Risk of Diabetes.</a></h2><p>The transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene confers one of the strongest genetic predispositions to type 2 diabetes, but diabetes development can be modified by diet.The aim of our study was to evaluate postprandial metabolic alterations in healthy men with a high genetic risk of diabetes, after two meals with varying macronutrient content.The study was conducted in 21 homozygous nondiabetic men carrying the high-risk (HR, n = 8, age: 31.2 ± 6.3 y, body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) 28.5 ± 8.1) or low-risk (LR, n = 13, age: 35.2 ± 10.3 y, BMI: 28.1 ± 6.4) genotypes at the rs7901695 locus.
