Epithelial and lamina propria mononuclear cells were isolated from surgical specimens from control, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative  patients. Platelet activating factor was extracted from highly purified cell preparations with 80% ethanol after stimulation with and without 0.2 uM calcium ionophore A23187 and was measured by platelet aggregation assay. Both cell types generated platelet activating factor activity and this was generally comparable for epithelial and lamina propria cells. Basal and stimulated platelet activating factor activity of epithelial and lamina propria cells from ulcerative  but not Crohn's disease patients was appreciably higher than that of control. Stimulation with calcium ionophore increased appreciably platelet activating factor activity in lamina propria cells from all groups. In contrast, only epithelial cells from ulcerative  showed an appreciable increase after calcium ionophore induction. These results suggest that epithelial cells are important contributors to intestinal platelet activating factor generation under normal and inflammatory conditions and that epithelial cells actively play a part in the pathogenesis of ulcerative .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7657099>Experimental  alters myenteric nerve function at inflamed and noninflamed sites in the rat.</a></h2><p>Studies in inflammatory bowel disease have shown extensive structural abnormalities in the enteric nervous system of inflamed and noninflamed gut; however, functional correlates are lacking.

The sympathetic innervation of the GI tract modulates motility, blood flow, and secretion, and therefore defective norepinephrine release may contribute to symptom generation in IBD. Accordingly, our aim here was to utilize the mouse model of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS; 5% wt/vol) of IBD to determine how norepinephrine release is reduced during GI inflammation. We hypothesized that the inflammation-induced reduction in norepinephrine release was due to inhibition of voltage-gated Ca(2+) current (I(Ca)) in prevertebral sympathetic neurons. We compared [(3)H]norepinephrine release in the colon and jejunum and I(Ca) amplitude in superior mesenteric ganglion (SMG) neurons from control mice and mice with DSS-induced . Changes to voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels were investigated by fura 2-AM Ca(2+) imaging, perforated patch-clamp electrophysiology, and real-time PCR. Depolarization-induced norepinephrine release from the inflamed colon and uninflamed jejunum was significantly impaired in mice treated with DSS, as was depolarization-induced Ca(2+) influx in SMG neurons.  reduced I(Ca) in SMG neurons by inhibiting omega-conotoxin GVIA (300 nM)-sensitive N-type Ca(2+) channels. The omega-conotoxin GVIA-sensitive component of norepinephrine release was significantly smaller in the colon during . The inhibition of I(Ca) was accompanied by a decrease in mRNA encoding the Ca(2+) channel alpha subunit (CaV 2.2) and a rightward shift in the voltage dependence of activation of I(Ca). These findings suggest that DSS-induced  attenuates norepinephrine release in the colon and jejunum due to inhibition of N-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels. This may contribute to functional alterations in both inflamed and uninflamed regions of the GI tract during inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1959469>Treatment of severe hemorrhage from a defunctionalized rectum with adrenaline chloride in ulcerative .</a></h2><p>Three patients suffering from ulcerative , who had previously undergone a colectomy and temporary Brooke ileostomy and who were under treatment with methylprednisolone and 5-aminosalicylic acid per the rectum, were readmitted to the hospital, presenting with profuse rectal hemorrhage with six to nine blood losses per day.

Stress was induced using a 9-day water avoidance paradigm (days 21-30 after infection). Colonic DRG neuronal excitability was measured using perforated patch clamp techniques, in vitro multi-unit afferent recordings, and measurements of visceromotor reflexes.Combined stress and prior infection increased corticosterone and epinephrine levels, compared with infected animals, but did not alter the resolution of colonic inflammation. These changes were associated with increased neuronal excitability and parallel changes in multi-unit afferent recordings and visceromotor reflex thresholds. Protease activity was increased at day 30 following infection with C rodentium. Protease inhibitors markedly reduced the effects of colonic supernatants on neuronal excitability from C rodentium but not stressed animals. Colonic DRG neurons expressed messenger RNAs for the β(2) adrenergic and glucocorticoid receptors; incubation with stress mediators recapitulated the effects on neuronal excitability observed with chronic stress alone. PAR2 activation with concentrations of the activating peptide SLIGRL that had no effect on neuronal excitability in controls caused marked increases in excitability when applied to neurons from chronically stressed animals.Stress, combined with prior acute , results in exaggerated peripheral nociceptive signaling. Proteases and stress mediators can signal directly to colonic DRG neurons; further analysis of these pathways could provide new targets for treatment of patients with postinfectious IBS.Copyright © 2011 AGA Institute.

Each of the mediators was tested at a dose of 2 nmol, administered intracolonically in the ethanol vehicle. When colonic damage was assessed 72 hr later, only leukotriene B4 significantly augmented damage compared to the controls. The incidence of ulcers increased from 35% in the control group to 90% in the group receiving leukotriene B4. Leukotriene B4 administration also resulted in significant increases in colonic myeloperoxidase activity and colonic leukotriene B4 synthesis. To assess the possible contribution of infiltrating neutrophils to the increase in colonic leukotriene B4 synthesis that accompanies colonic inflammation,  was induced in normal and neutropenic rats by intracolonic administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid. Neutropenia was achieved by treatment with an antineutrophil serum. In the neutropenic animals killed 4 hr after induction of  significant changes in leukotriene B4 synthesis were not observed, whereas a fourfold increase was observed in the controls. From these studies we conclude the following: (1) leukotriene B4, at a dose of 2 nmol, can significantly potentiate the colonic ulceration induced by 30% ethanol; (2) this action of leukotriene B4 is not shared by the same dose of the other inflammatory mediators tested; and (3) infiltrating neutrophils are the major source of colonic leukotriene B4 synthesis in a rat model of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7892508>The effect of Clostridium difficile toxin on colonocyte prostanoid activity.</a></h2><p>Antibiotic-associated  is caused by Clostridium difficile toxin. However, the pathophysiology of this entity is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of C. difficile toxin on colonocyte cyclooxygenase and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity. A transformed colonocyte cell line (Caco-2) was grown to confluency on 6 well plates. The cells were stimulated with graded concentrations of C. difficile toxin. In separate experiments, the cells were pretreated for one hour prior to stimulation with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, or the glucocorticoid, dexamethasone. The culture media was collected one hour following C. difficile stimulation. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha (6KPGF), thromboxane B2 (TxB2) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) levels were determined in the media by an ELISA. Platelet activating factor (PAF) concentration was determined by a RIA. C. difficile toxin stimulated PGE2 and 6KPGF levels in a dose dependent fashion but failed to stimulate TxB2, LTB4 or PAF. Prostanoid production was inhibited by indomethacin dose dependently but was not inhibited by dexamethasone. The presence of indomethacin resulted in production of PAF. Our results show that the effects of C. difficile toxin on colonocytes are mediated by cyclooxygenase activity. The increase in PAF formation associated with indomethacin administration suggests that the prostanoids modulate PLA2 activity and inhibit PAF formation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819742>Evidence against a systemic arterial defect in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Despite increasing interest in local microvascular alterations associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the potential contribution of a primary systemic vascular defect in the etiology of IBD is unknown. We compared reactivity of large diameter mesenteric arteries from segments affected by Crohn disease (CD) or ulcerative  (UC) to an uninvolved vascular bed in both IBD and control patients.Mesenteric and omental arteries were obtained from UC, CD, and non-IBD patients. Isometric arterial contractions were recorded in response to extracellular potassium (K(+)) and cumulative additions of norepinephrine (NE). In addition, relaxation in response to pinacidil, an activator of adenosine triphosphate-sensitive K(+) channels was examined.Contraction to K(+) and sensitivity to NE were not significantly different in arteries from CD, UC, and controls. Relaxation to pinacidil was also similar between groups.Potassium-induced contractions and sensitivity to NE and pinacidil were not significantly different in large diameter mesenteric and omental arteries obtained from IBD patients. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the sensitivity to K(+), NE, and pinacidil between mesenteric and omental arteries of CD and UC patients and those from non-IBD patients. Our results suggest an underlying vascular defect systemic to CD or UC patients is unlikely to contribute to the etiology of IBD.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study, accordingly, was to investigate the role of phospholipid metabolism in the intestinal mucosa in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Surgically resected specimens from patients with Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative  (UC), and colrectal cancer (non-cancerous tissue; as a control) were submitted to phospholipid analysis and a PLase A2 assay, which measures the degradation of endogenous mucosal phospholipids. A high percentage of plasmenylethanolamine (plas.E) was detected in the glycerophospholipid fraction of CD mucosa. The arachidonic acid content of the phosphatidylethanolamine plus plas.E subfraction was higher in inflamed than in intact mucosa in CD. PLaseA2 activity, resulting in lysophosphatidyl  production, was detected only in inflamed mucosa from CD and UC patients, but not in normal mucosa from controls. PLaseA2 activity was highest in moderately inflamed mucosa adjacent to a severely ulcerated area. The PLaseA2 that reacts with endogenous phosphatidylcholine (PC) to form lysoPC was found irrespective of the presence of inflammation. The PLaseA2 that reacts with -containing phospholipids is more closely related to inflammation than other PLaseA2 isoenzymes in IBD mucosa.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5947176>[Lesions produced in animals with the use of epinephrine and sera from patients with non-specific chronic ulcerative  in the active phase].</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8675086>Platelet activating factor: release from colonic mucosa in patients with ulcerative  and its effect on colonic secretion.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory mediators have been implicated in the pathophysiology of ulcerative . They may stimulate intestinal secretion and contribute to the production of diarrhoea. Platelet activating factor (PAF) may be responsible for a high proportion of this secretory response. Biopsy specimens from inflamed and quiescent mucosa of patients with ulcerative  and normal human colonic mucosa were cultured or co-cultured. The release of PAF, prostaglandin E2, and leukotriene D4 into the culture medium was measured and the ability of this culture medium, from inflamed and normal tissues, to influence secretion in rat colonic mucosa was assessed. PAF was liberated by inflamed tissue. Its release from quiescent but not normal tissue was stimulated by medium in which inflamed mucosal biopsy tissues had been cultured and by exogenous bradykinin and 5-hydroxytryptamine, but not by histamine. PAF stimulated eicosanoid production. The rise in short circuit current produced in vitro by inflamed tissue culture medium was inhibited by the PAF receptor antagonist (CV 6209) (46%) (32.4 (2.9) v 17.5 (1.19) muA.cm-2, p < 0.005) and further by combined cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibition (indomethacin plus ICI 207968) (58%) (32.4 (2.9) v 13.6 (1.9) muA.cm-2, p < 0.005). Mepacrine and hydrocortisone attenuated considerably the electrical response evoked by medium from inflamed mucosa to a similar extent (32.4 (2.9) v 6.3 (1.2) v 5.1 (0.9) muA.cm-2, p < 0.001). These data suggest that PAF accounted for 46% of the culture medium secretory effect.

Propionate transport and luminal SCFA concentration were evaluated.Butyrate and propionate stimulated electroneutral Na+ absorption above basal levels in the control and pair-fed groups, as evidenced by significant increases in mucosal-to-serosal and net Na+ fluxes with no change in serosal-to-mucosal flux, short-circuit current, or conductance. Butyrate-stimulated Na+ absorption and propionate absorption were blocked by amiloride, an inhibitor of Na(+)-H+ exchange. In the infected group, both butyrate and propionate failed to stimulate colonic Na+ absorption above basal levels. Propionate absorption was inhibited, and epinephrine failed to stimulate Na+ or propionate absorption.

Tissue was assayed for the various molecular species of PAF and its biologically inactive metabolite lyso-PAF using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Mucosa from surgical resections for ulcerative  contained C16:0 PAF (mean = 156 ng/g of mucosa), but not C18:0 PAF, PAF was not identified in mucosa from normal surgical resections or in endoscopic biopsies from either patients with ulcerative  or normal individuals.

Our main objective in this investigation was to study the effect of an acetic acid-induced ulcerative  on the expression and function of beta(3)-adrenoceptors in the rat colon. Inflammation was induced by administering acetic acid intrarectally into rats. Levels of myeloperoxidase activity and beta(3)-adrenoceptor mRNA were measured in colon samples taken following acetic acid administration. Relaxation responses to beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonists were also studied. Ulcerative  was associated with significantly elevated levels of myeloperoxidase activity in the colon segments. Levels of beta(3)-adrenoceptor mRNA as well as the relaxation responses to isoprenaline and BRL 37344 were however not significantly different between inflamed and control tissue. Acetic acid-induced ulcerative  in rats was not associated with changes in the expression and/or function of beta(3)-adrenoceptors in the rat colon. Therefore, the dysfunctional motility that is characteristic of ulcerative , is not likely to be due to changes in beta(3)-adrenergic mechanisms in this model.Copyright 2002 S.

Biopsies of colonic mucosa from patients with ulcerative  liberated more interleukin-1 beta, prostaglandin E2, leukotriene C4 and platelet-activating factor into the medium in which they were cultured than biopsies from patients with irritable bowel syndrome and histologically normal mucosa. 2. Addition of interleukin-1 stimulated release of greater quantities of all these inflammatory mediators, including interleukin-1 itself, from inflamed and normal mucosa. 3. Blockade of cyclo-oxygenase with indomethacin or of lipoxygenase with ICI 207968 or of phospholipase A2 with mepacrine inhibited release of prostaglandin E2 or leukotriene C4 or both of these plus platelet-activating factor, respectively. 4. Interleukin-1 stimulated the short-circuit current across isolated rat colonic mucosa mounted in flux chambers in a dose-dependent manner (Km 2 x 10(-11) mol/l). This stimulation was markedly inhibited by the removal of chloride from the bathing media. 5. Indomethacin or ICI 207968 inhibited the short-circuit current response to interleukin-1 and a combination of these antagonists produced a greater inhibition. Mepacrine caused an even greater inhibition whereas tetrodotoxin plus mepacrine inhibited the current completely. 6. These data indicate that interleukin-1, released in excess from inflamed colonic mucosa, stimulates the release of a range of inflammatory mediators as well as of more interleukin-1. It probably acts by stimulating phospholipase A2 in inflammatory cells, probably lymphocytes, and can do so in normal and inflamed mucosa. Since, in rat colonic mucosa it stimulated an electrical response in very low concentrations, it is feasible that it is involved in the chloride secretion, and hence the diarrhoea, which may occur in inflammatory reactions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7708808>Platelet-activating factor mediates trinitrobenzene induced .</a></h2><p>Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is an endogenous phospholipid which may be an important mediator of shock and inflammation. Recent evidence suggests that PAF plays a role in the development of ischemic  and inflammatory bowel disease. Its effects are mediated by second messengers, including the arachidonic acid metabolites. Using an ex vivo isolated left colon rabbit perfusion model, our aims were to determine whether exogenously administered trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNB), which produces experimental , stimulates both PAF and eicosanoid release in the colon, and if so, whether this effect can be blocked by a PAF antagonist. Colonic inflammation was induced by the intracolonic administration of 0.25 ml of 50% ethanol containing 30 mg of TNB. Tissue and perfusate concentrations of the eicosanoids, [prostaglandin E (PGE2), 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) and thromboxane B2 (TXB2), leukotriene B4 (LTB4)] and the autocoid PAF were measured by ELISA. During TNB infusion there was a significant increase in tissue levels of PAF compared to control colons. Additional studies performed pretreating the colons with the PAF receptor antagonist WEB-2170 prior to TNB infusion blocked PAF release. TNB stimulated release of luminal eicosanoids except LTB4 and suppressed release of tissue prostanoids. Pretreatment with WEB-2170 prior to TNB inhibited luminal eicosanoids, and inhibited PGE2 and prostacyclin, but not TX tissue suppression. Inhibition of TNB-stimulated PAF release by WEB-2170 suggests that PAF may play a role in TNB-induced  and this phenomenon may mediate tissue injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9552223>Mucin secretion in inflammatory bowel disease: comparison of a macrophage-derived mucin secretagogue (MMS-68) to conventional secretagogues.</a></h2><p>We have described a novel macrophage-derived mucin secretagogue (MMS-68) that mediates mucin secretion in colon cancer cell lines and explants of normal and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) mucosa.

In normal colonic explants and HT-29 cells, each of the secretagogues including, MMS-68-induced mucin release two- to fivefold more than culture medium alone. In HT-29 cells, MMS-68 plus leukotriene C4 (LTC4) induced a 50% increase in mucin release over either secretagogue alone, and MMS-68 plus platelet-activating factor (PAF) markedly enhanced mucin release by eightfold over either secretagogue. In colonic explants from patients with UC and CD, the mucin release in response to MMS-68 was similar to that of normal colonic explants. Likewise, in isolated epithelial cells from CD and UC (whether involved or uninvolved), MMS-68-induced release was similar to that of epithelial cells isolated from normal colonic mucosa. The number of MMS-68-producing macrophages was lower in uninflamed UC mucosa compared with inflamed UC mucosa and CD mucosa. The mucin secretagogue activity of MMS-68 is comparable to that of other known secretagogues, and PAF can have a synergistic effect on this activity. Whole tissue explants and isolated colonic epithelial cells from patients with IBD respond at least as well as their normal counterparts to MMS-68.

Here, we investigated the effect of PEA in a mouse model of functional accelerated transit which persists after the resolution of colonic inflammation (post-inflammatory irritable bowel syndrome).Intestinal inflammation was induced by intracolonic administration of oil of mustard (OM). Mice were tested for motility and biochemical and molecular biology changes 4 weeks later. PEA, oleoylethanolamide and endocannabinoid levels were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and receptor and enzyme mRNA expression by qRT-PCR.OM induced transient  and a functional post-inflammatory increase in upper gastrointestinal transit, associated with increased intestinal anandamide (but not 2-arachidonoylglycerol, PEA or oleoylethanolamide) levels and down-regulation of mRNA for TRPV1 channels. Exogenous PEA inhibited the OM-induced increase in transit and tended to increase anandamide levels. Palmitic acid had a weaker effect on transit. Inhibition of transit by PEA was blocked by rimonabant (CB1 receptor antagonist), further increased by 5'-iodoresiniferatoxin (TRPV1 antagonist) and not significantly modified by the PPARα antagonist GW6471.Intestinal endocannabinoids and TRPV1 channel were dysregulated in a functional model of accelerated transit exhibiting aspects of post-inflammatory irritable bowel syndrome. PEA counteracted the accelerated transit, the effect being mediated by CB1 receptors (possibly via increased anandamide levels) and modulated by TRPV1 channels.© 2014 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8161133>[Etiology of "pouchitis"].</a></h2><p>"Pouchitis" remains an unsolved problem which affects the lives of significant numbers of patients who have undergone an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis procedure for ulcerative  or familial adenomatous polyposis.

Recently, we demonstrated in a preclinical model that rats subjected to neonatal colon inflammation show increased basal plasma norepinephrine (NE), which contributes to GHS through the upregulation of nerve growth factor (NGF) expression in the gastric fundus. We tested the hypothesis that neonatal colon inflammation increases anxiety-like behavior and sympathetic nervous system activity, which upregulates the expression of NGF to induce GHS in adult life. Chemical sympathectomy, but not adrenalectomy, suppressed the elevated NGF expression in the fundus muscularis externa and GHS. The measurement of heart rate variability showed a significant increase in the low frequency-to-high frequency ratio in GHS vs. the control rats. Stimulus-evoked release of NE from the fundus muscularis externa strips was significantly greater in GHS than in the control rats. Tyrosine hydroxylase expression was increased in the celiac ganglia of the GHS vs. the control rats. We found an increase in trait but not stress-induced anxiety-like behavior in GHS rats in an elevated plus maze. We concluded that neonatal programming triggered by colon inflammation upregulates tyrosine hydroxylase in the celiac ganglia, which upregulates the release of NE in the gastric fundus muscularis externa. The increase of NE release from the sympathetic nerve terminals concentration dependently upregulates NGF, which proportionately increases the visceromotor response to gastric distention. Neonatal programming concurrently increases anxiety-like behavior in GHS rats.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10952687>Intestinal anti-inflammatory activity of UR-12746, a novel 5-ASA conjugate, on acute and chronic experimental  in the rat.</a></h2><p>The present study was undertaken to investigate the intestinal anti-inflammatory effects of UR-12746 on the acute and chronic stages of a trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS) experimental model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the rat. UR-12746 is a novel, locally-acting compound which combines, through an azo bond, 5-aminosalicylic (5-ASA) and UR-12715, a potent platelet activating factor (PAF)-antagonist. UR-12746 oral pretreatment of colitic rats (50 and 100 mg kg(-1)) reduced acute colonic damage when evaluated 2 days after colonic insult. Postreatment for 4 weeks with UR-12746 (50 and 100 mg kg(-1)) resulted in a faster recovery of the damaged colonic mucosa, which was macroscopically significant from the third week. The intestinal anti-inflammatory effect of UR-12746 was associated with a decrease in leukocyte infiltration in the colonic mucosa, which was evidenced both biochemically, by a reduction in myeloperoxidase activity, and histologically, by a lower leukocyte count after morphometric analysis. This effect was higher than that seen with sulphasalazine, when assayed at the same doses and in the same experimental conditions. Several mechanisms can be involved in the beneficial effects showed by UR-12746: inhibition of leukotriene B(4) synthesis in the inflamed colon, improvement of the altered colonic oxidative status, and reduction of colonic interleukin-1beta production. The results suggest that the intestinal anti-inflammatory activity of UR-12746 can be attributed to the additive effects exerted by 5-ASA and UR-12715, the PAF antagonist compound, that are released in the colonic lumen after reduction of the azo bond by the intestinal bacteria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21296867>Maternal methyl-donor supplementation induces prolonged murine offspring  susceptibility in association with mucosal epigenetic and microbiomic changes.</a></h2><p>Developmental epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, have been recognized as potential pathogenic factors in inflammatory bowel diseases, the hallmark of which is an exaggerated immune response against luminal microbes. A methyl-donor (MD) diet can modify DNA methylation at select murine genomic loci during early development. The components of the MDs are routinely incorporated into prenatal human supplements. Therefore, we studied the effects of maternal MD supplementation on offspring  susceptibility and colonic mucosal DNA methylation and gene expression changes in mice as a model. Additionally, we investigated the offspring mucosal microbiomic response to the maternal dietary supplementation.  was induced by dextran sulfate sodium. Colonic mucosa from offspring of MD-supplemented mothers following reversal to control diet at weaning was interrogated by methylation-specific microarrays and pyrosequencing at postnatal days 30 (P30) and P90. Transcriptomic changes were analyzed by microarray profiling and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The mucosal microbiome was studied by high throughput pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA. Maternal MD supplementation induced a striking susceptibility to  in offspring. This phenotype was associated with colonic mucosal DNA methylation and expression changes. Metagenomic analyses did not reveal consistent bacteriomic differences between P30 and P90, but showed a prolonged effect of the diet on the offspring mucosal microbiome. In conclusion, maternal MD supplementation increases offspring  susceptibility that associates with persistent epigenetic and prolonged microbiomic changes. These findings underscore that epigenomic reprogramming relevant to mammalian  can occur during early development in response to maternal dietary modifications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25755731>PAF receptor antagonist Ginkgolide B inhibits tumourigenesis and angiogenesis in -associated cancer.</a></h2><p>Platelet activating factor (PAF), a potent pro-inflammatory phospholipid, has been found to trigger tumor growth and angiogenesis through its G-protein coupled receptor (PAFR).

In vitro studies indicate that it is also implicated in immune responses. Hyperleptinaemia has been reported in acute inflammation, especially during the early stages of intestinal inflammation in rats. The present study investigated the possible role of leptin in the pathogenesis of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced  in rats. Since no specific antagonist of leptin is available, a CCK-B antagonist (YM022) and a beta3 agonist (BRL37344) were used in this study to inhibit leptin secretion.  was induced by intracolonic instillation of TNBS in rats. Five TNBS-groups were subcutaneously implanted with micropumps containing: placebo, YM022, BRL37344, BRL37344 and exogenous leptin simultaneously, or leptin alone. At sacrifices,  severity was assessed by macroscopic and histological scoring systems and by determination of tissue myeloperoxidase activity. The TNBS-induced hyperleptinaemia was significantly reduced by YM022 and BRL37344 (p<0.05). Inhibition of leptin secretion markedly reduced colonic inflammation, whatever the criteria considered (i.e. macroscopic, histological or biochemical). In contrast, administration of exogenous leptin completely abolished the beneficial effect of leptin-lowering drugs on  severity. These results provide the first direct evidence for an important deleterious role of leptin in the pathogenesis of experimental intestinal inflammation and suggest that a pro-inflammatory activity is attributable to leptin in vivo.

PPARα, NAAA, NAPE-PLD and FAAH showed differential distributions in the colonic epithelium, lamina propria, smooth muscle and enteric plexus. Gene expression analysis indicated a decrease of PPARα, PPARγ and NAAA, and an increase of FAAH and iNOS in the active  mucosa.

This study aims to investigate the effects of palmitoylethanolammide (PEA), a drug able to counteract astroglial activation in the central nervous system, on intestinal inflammation, in humans and mice.Mouse models of dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-induced , colonic biopsies deriving from UC patients and primary cultures of mouse and human enteric glial cells (EGC), have been used to assess the effects of PEA, alone or in the presence of specific PPARα or PPARγ antagonists, on: macroscopic signs of UC (DAI score, colon length, spleen weight, macrophages/neutrophils infiltration); the expression and release of proinflammatory markers typical of UC; TLR pathway in EGCs.PEA treatment improves all macroscopic signs of UC and decreases the expression and release of all the proinflammatory markers tested. PEA anti-inflammatory effects are mediated by the selective targeting of the S100B/TLR4 axis on ECG, causing a downstream inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB)-dependent inflammation. Antagonists at PPARα, but not PPARγ, abolished PEA effects, in mice and in humans.Because of its lack of toxicity, its ability in reducing inflammation and its selective PPARα action, PEA might be an innovative molecule to broaden pharmacological strategies against UC.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

The authors conclude that PAF can be released by damage to human colonic mucosa/submucosa, and that the inhibition of PAF release in ulcerative  may at least partly explain the therapeutic effect of 5-ASA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31281321>Complex Bacterial Consortia Reprogram the Colitogenic Activity of  in a Gnotobiotic Mouse Model of Chronic, Immune-Mediated .</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are associated with compositional and functional changes of the intestinal microbiota, but specific contributions of individual bacteria to chronic intestinal inflammation remain unclear.  is a resident member of the human intestinal core microbiota that has been linked to the pathogenesis of IBD and induces chronic  in susceptible monoassociated IL-10-deficient (IL-10) mice. In this study, we characterized the colitogenic activity of  as part of a simplified human microbial consortium based on seven enteric bacterial strains (SIHUMI). RNA sequencing analysis of  isolated from monoassociated wild type and IL-10 mice identified 408 genes including 14 genes of the  utilization () locus that were significantly up-regulated in response to inflammation. Despite considerable up-regulation of  genes, deletion of  utilization (Δ) had no impact on  colitogenic activity in monoassociated IL-10 mice. However, replacement of the  wild type bacteria by a Δ mutant in SIHUMI-colonized IL-10 mice resulted in exacerbated , suggesting protective functions of   utilization in complex bacterial communities. To better understand  gene response in the presence of other microbes, we purified wild type  cells from the colon content of SIHUMI-colonized wild type and IL-10 mice using immuno-magnetic separation and performed RNA sequencing. Transcriptional profiling revealed that the bacterial environment reprograms  gene expression in response to inflammation, with the majority of differentially expressed genes not being shared between monocolonized and SIHUMI conditions. While in  monoassociation a general bacterial stress response could be observed, expression of  genes in SIHUMI-colonized mice was characterized by up-regulation of genes involved in growth and replication. Interestingly, in mice colonized with SIHUMI lacking  enhanced inflammation was observed in comparison to SIHUMI-colonized mice, supporting the hypothesis that   metabolism protects against  in complex consortia. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that complex bacterial consortia interactions reprogram the gene expression profile and colitogenic activity of the opportunistic pathogen  toward a protective function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7664807>Nicotine inhibits cytokine synthesis by mouse colonic mucosa.</a></h2><p>We examined the in vivo effect of nicotine on the synthesis of (pro)inflammatory mediators by mouse colonic mucosa.

Therefore, we employed video microscopy techniques to monitor nerve-evoked vasoconstrictor responses in mouse colonic submucosal arterioles in vitro and examined the effect of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS) . Nerve stimulation (2-20 Hz) caused frequency-dependent vasoconstrictor responses that were abolished by tetrodotoxin (300 nm) and guanethidine (10 microm). The P2 receptor antagonist suramin (100 microm) or the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (100 nm) reduced the vasoconstriction and the combination of suramin and prazosin completely abolished responses. Nerve-evoked constrictions of submucosal arterioles from mice with TNBS  were inhibited by prazosin but not suramin. Superfusion of ATP (10 microm) resulted in large vasoconstrictions in control mice but had no effect in mice with  whereas constrictions to phenylephrine (3 microm) were unaffected. P2X(1) receptor immunohistochemistry did not suggest any alteration in receptor expression following . However, Western blotting revealed that submucosal P2X(1) receptor expression was increased during . In contrast to ATP, alphabeta-methylene-ATP (1 microm), which is resistant to catabolism by nucleotidases, constricted control and TNBS arterioles.

Much is known about the structure and function of these transducer proteins. A signaling molecule initiates transduction by binding to the receptor which then prompts the G protein to undergo a reaction cycle. This cycle involves guanine nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, G protein subunit dissociation, and interactions with an effector (e.g. adenylyl cyclase, phospholipase C), as well as with inactivating molecules. The result is altered generation of intracellular second messengers, protein transcription, or another profound cellular response. This signal transduction system also contains multiple mechanisms for turning off the signal such as phosphorylating, internalizing, or downregulating receptors, uncoupling the receptor-G protein complex, or cell-surface peptidases, and precipitating conformational changes in transducer elements. These aspects of signal transduction are examined in two well studied systems, namely the beta 2-adrenergic and the substance P transducers. Both complexes are important physiological neuroregulators in the gut and elsewhere. Pathophysiological mechanisms involving aberrent signal transduction have been implicated in various diseases including major common illnesses such as heart failure and gastrointestinal disorders such as cholera, other infectious diarrheas, and .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21051488>Exposure to norepinephrine enhances Brachyspira pilosicoli growth, attraction to mucin and attachment to Caco-2 cells.</a></h2><p>Brachyspira pilosicoli is an anaerobic intestinal spirochaete that colonizes the large intestine of a variety of species of birds and mammals, including human beings. Colonization may result in a mild  and diarrhoea in a condition known as 'intestinal spirochaetosis'. The catecholamine norepinephrine (NE), which is known to influence the behaviour of many bacterial species, may be present in the colon. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether exposure of B. pilosicoli to NE would influence its in vitro behaviour in assays that may reflect in vivo colonization potential. B. pilosicoli strain 95/1000 was used in all the assays. Addition of NE at a concentration of 0.05&emsp14;mM to B. pilosicoli growing in anaerobic broth significantly increased spirochaete numbers after 4&emsp14;days incubation. The effect of higher concentrations of NE was not significant. Exposure to 0.05&emsp14;mM NE, but not to higher concentrations, also resulted in significantly more spirochaete cells entering capillary tubes containing 4 % porcine gastric mucin than occurred with untreated cultures. When NE was added to chemotaxis buffer in capillary tubes, significantly more spirochaetes were attracted to the buffer containing NE at 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0&emsp14;mM than to buffer containing 0.05&emsp14;mM NE, or when no NE was added. Exposure of B. pilosicoli cultures to 0.05&emsp14;mM NE prior to incubation with Caco-2 monolayers resulted in more attachment to the monolayer than occurred with non-exposed cultures. These results show that at higher concentrations, NE acts as a chemoattractant for B. pilosicoli, and at 0.05&emsp14;mM it increases the spirochaete's growth rate, attraction to mucin and rate of attachment to cultured enterocytes. These activities are likely to enhance the ability of B. pilosicoli to colonize, and may be induced by conditions that increase NE concentrations in the intestinal tract, such as the stresses associated with crowding.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1769471>[Paf-acether and digestive tract].</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9561339>Lipid mediators in inflammatory disorders.</a></h2><p>During the past few decades, intensive collaborative research in the fields of chronic and acute inflammatory disorders has resulted in a better understanding of the pathophysiology and diagnosis of these diseases. Modern therapeutic approaches are still not satisfactory and shock, sepsis and multiple organ failure remain the great challenge in intensive care medicine. However, the treatment of inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative  or psoriasis also represents an unresolved problem. Many factors contribute to the complex course of inflammatory reactions. Microbiological, immunological and toxic agents can initiate the inflammatory response by activating a variety of humoral and cellular mediators. In the early phase of inflammation, excessive amounts of interleukins and lipid-mediators are released and play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of organ dysfunction. Arachidonic acid (AA), the mother substance of the pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, is released from membrane phospholipids in the course of inflammatory activation and is metabolised to prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Various strategies have been evaluated to control the excessive production of lipid mediators on different levels of biochemical pathways, such as inhibition of phospholipase A2, the trigger enzyme for release of AA, blockade of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways and the development of receptor antagonists against platelet activating factor and leukotrienes. Some of these agents exert protective effects in different inflammatory disorders such as septic organ failure, rheumatoid arthritis or asthma, whereas others fail to do so. Encouraging results have been obtained by dietary supplementation with long chain omega-3 fatty acids like eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). In states of inflammation, EPA is released to compete with AA for enzymatic metabolism inducing the production of less inflammatory and chemotactic derivatives.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1359744>Cytokines and platelet-activating factor in human inflamed colonic mucosa.</a></h2><p>Colonic biopsy specimens from patients with active ulcerative  and controls were incubated for four hours in the presence or absence of calcium ionophore or antihuman immunoglobulin E (IgE). Platelet-activating factor (PAF) was determined in the tissue by aggregation assay after extraction with 80% ethanol. PAF was not detected in normal mucosa, whereas A23187 and antihuman IgE stimulated its activity: mean +/- SE, 43.2 +/- 8.6 and 33.0 +/- 6.1 pg/10 mg wet weight, respectively. In active ulcerative , A23187 and antihuman IgE induced significantly higher stimulation of PAF synthesis compared to their effects on normal mucosa. The enhanced stimulation of PAF induced by A23187 was dose-dependently inhibited by sulphasalazine, 5-aminosalicylic acid and prednisolone, but not by sulfapyridine. Colonic interleukin-1 content and release during 24 h of culture were significantly higher in patients with active ulcerative  and Crohn's disease compared to normal subjects. Prednisolone significantly and dose-dependently inhibited interleukin-1 release. These results suggest that colonic generation of PAF and interleukin-1 are elevated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and, thus, may have a role in its pathogenesis.

Ulcerative  (UC) and Crohn's Disease (CD) represent paradigmatic examples of intestinal chronic inflammatory conditions in which the process of neovascularization correlates with the severity and progression of the diseases. Molecules able to target the angiogenesis have thus the potential to synergistically affect the disease course. Beyond its anti-inflammatory effect, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is able to reduce angiogenesis in several chronic inflammatory conditions, but no data about its anti-angiogenic activity in  have been produced, yet.The effects of PEA on inflammation-associated angiogenesis in mice with dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced  and in patients with UC were assessed. The release of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), the hemoglobin tissue content, the expression of CD31 and of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mammalian-target-of-rapamycin (mTOR) signaling axis were all evaluated in the presence of different concentrations of PEA and concomitant administration of PPAR-α and -γ antagonists.Our results demonstrated that PEA, in a selective peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-α dependent mechanism, inhibits -associated angiogenesis, decreasing VEGF release and new vessels formation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the mTOR/Akt axis regulates, at least partly, the angiogenic process in IBD and that PEA directly affects this pathway.Our results suggest that PEA may improve inflammation-driven angiogenesis in colonic mucosa, thus reducing the mucosal damage and potentially affecting disease progression and the shift towards the carcinogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7517887>Effect of platelet-activating factor and its antagonists on colonic dysmotility and tissue levels of colonic neuropeptides.</a></h2><p>We investigated whether platelet-activating factor (PAF) alters colonic tissue levels of substance P and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), two neuropeptides that regulate colonic motility.

After 24 h, mucosal ulceration and hemorrhage were observed in TNB/ethanol-, 50% ethanol-, and to a lesser extent, in TNB/saline-treated rats. After 1 wk, mucosal damage was completely resolved in the 50% ethanol and TNB/saline-treated rats but the lesions in the TNB/ethanol-treated rats persisted and progressed to a chronic active inflammatory process after 3 wk. Myeloperoxidase activity was significantly elevated in mucosal scrapings from all treatment groups at all time intervals when macroscopic and microscopic mucosal injury was evident. Interleukin-1 was found to be the most sensitive indicator of mucosal inflammation, and its mucosal values correlated with myeloperoxidase activity. Leukotriene B4 was increased in control rats at 1 wk and in TNB/ethanol-treated rats at all time intervals. The maximal increase in leukotriene B4 was observed at 1 wk. Thromboxane B2 generation was reduced while platelet activating factor generation was not increased in TNB/ethanol-treated rats.

In inflammatory bowel disease, sympathetic innervation in intestinal mucosa is reduced. Our aim was to investigate the role of sympathetic innervation to the intestine on regulation of the innate immune responses.In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages, we evaluated the effect of adrenergic receptor activation on cytokine production and metabolic profile. In vivo, the effect of sympathetic denervation on mucosal innate immune responses using 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), or using surgical transection of the superior mesenteric nerve (sympathectomy) was tested in Rag1 mice that lack T- and B-lymphocytes.In murine macrophages, adrenergic β2 receptor activation elicited a dose-dependent reduction of LPS-induced cytokines, reduced LPS-induced glycolysis and increased maximum respiration. Sympathectomy led to a significantly decreased norepinephrine concentration in intestinal tissue. Within 14 days after sympathectomy, mice developed clinical signs of , colon oedema and excess colonic cytokine production. Both 6-OHDA and sympathectomy led to prominent goblet cell depletion and histological damage of colonic mucosa.We conclude that the sympathetic nervous system plays a regulatory role in constraining innate immune cell reactivity towards microbial challenges, likely via the adrenergic β2 receptor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27625036>Adelmidrol, a Palmitoylethanolamide Analogue, as a New Pharmacological Treatment for the Management of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Leukocyte infiltration, improved levels of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and oxidative stress in the colon are the principal factors in inflammatory bowel disease. The goal of the current study was to explore the effects of adelmidrol, an analog of the anti-inflammatory fatty acid amide signaling molecule palmitoylethanolamide, in mice subjected to experimental . Additionally, to clarify whether the protective action of adelmidrol is dependent on the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), we investigated the effects of a PPARγ antagonist, GW9662, on adelmidrol action. Adelmidrol (10 mg/kg daily, o.s.) was tested in a murine experimental model of  induced by intracolonic administration of dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid. Nuclear factor-κB translocation, cyclooxygenase-2, and phosphoextracellular signal-regulated kinase, as well as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β, were significantly increased in colon tissues after dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid administration. Immunohistochemical staining for ICAM-1, P-selectin, nitrotyrosine, and poly(ADP)ribose showed a positive staining in the inflamed colon. Treatment with adelmidrol decreased diarrhea, body weight loss, and myeloperoxidase activity. Adelmidrol treatment, moreover, reduced nuclear factor-κB translocation, cyclooxygenase-2, and phosphoextracellular signal-regulated kinase expression; proinflammatory cytokine release; and the incidence of nitrotyrosine and poly(ADP)ribose in the colon. It also decreased the upregulation of ICAM-1 and P-selectin. Adelmidrol treatment produced a reduction of Bax and an intensification of Bcl-2 expression. This study clearly demonstrates that adelmidrol exerts important anti-inflammatory effects that are partly dependent on PPARγ, suggesting that this molecule may represent a new pharmacologic approach for inflammatory bowel disease treatment.Copyright © 2016 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8620791>Role of cytokines and platelet-activating factor in inflammatory bowel disease.

Cytokines are peptides that regulate and coordinate inflammatory and immunologic responses. Increased production of cytokines has been reported during Crohn's disease and ulcerative  and is correlated with disease activity.Because PAF and cytokines may have an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, their inhibition by specific antagonists, mediators, or other agents such as steroids may have a potential therapeutic benefit in treatment and management of these inflammatory diseases in the near future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3090219>Intestinal mast cell polymorphism: new research directions and clinical implications.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24153251>An apPEAling new therapeutic for ulcerative ?</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30195028>The β2-adrenergic receptor controls inflammation by driving rapid IL-10 secretion.</a></h2><p>The mammalian nervous system communicates important information about the environment to the immune system, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Secondary lymphoid organs are highly innervated by sympathetic neurons that secrete norepinephrine (NE) as the primary neurotransmitter. Immune cells express adrenergic receptors, enabling the sympathetic nervous system to directly control immune function. NE is a potent immunosuppressive factor and markedly inhibits TNF-α secretion from innate cells in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In this study, we demonstrate that NE blocks the secretion of a variety of proinflammatory cytokines by rapidly inducing IL-10 secretion from innate cells in response to multiple Toll-like receptor (TLR) signals. NE mediated these effects exclusively through the β2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2). Consequently, Adrb2 animals were more susceptible to L. monocytogenes infection and to intestinal inflammation in a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model of . Further, Adrb2 animals rapidly succumbed to endotoxemia in response to a sub-lethal LPS challenge and exhibited elevated serum levels of TNF-α and reduced IL-10. LPS-mediated lethality in WT animals was rescued by administering a β 2-specific agonist and in Adrb2 animals by exogenous IL-10. These findings reveal a critical role for ADRB2 signaling in controlling inflammation through the rapid induction of IL-10. Our findings provide a fundamental insight into how the sympathetic nervous system controls a critical facet of immune function through ADRB2 signaling.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Catechol derivatives were assayed by means of HPLC-EC.It is shown that dopamine and noradrenaline levels in the distal colon (inflamed mucosa), but not in the ileum (non-inflamed mucosa), of TNBS-treated rats were markedly lower than in control animals. A slight decrease in L-DOPA tissue levels, no changes in AADC activity and an increase in plasma IFN-gamma levels accompanied this decrease in dopamine levels. Exposure of Caco-2 cells, a human intestinal epithelial cell line, to human IFN-gamma resulted in a concentration-dependent and long-lasting inhibition of L-DOPA uptake, which most likely explains the decrease in dopamine levels in the inflamed mucosa.Changes in tissue levels of noradrenaline and dopamine in experimental  in the rat follow a similar pattern to that observed in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative . In this model of experimental , the decrease in dopamine levels is most likely explained by the inhibitory effect of IFN-gamma on L-DOPA uptake by intestinal epithelial cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15845563>Key role of the sympathetic microenvironment for the interplay of tumour necrosis factor and interleukin 6 in normal but not in inflamed mouse colon mucosa.</a></h2><p>In the intestinal tract, the role of sympathetic neurotransmitters has been largely ignored in mucosal neuroimmunology.Our aim was to investigate the influence of the sympathetic microenvironment on the mucosal interplay of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin 6 (IL-6).Colon strips of normal and colitic BALB/c mice were superfused in vitro. Tissue was electrically stimulated to investigate the influence of endogenous norepinephrine (NE) on secretion of IL-6, with or without anti-TNF antibodies (anti-TNF) and adrenoceptor antagonists. IL-6 was secreted from macrophages.Superfusion with anti-TNF stimulated IL-6 secretion in normal but not in colitic colon (p<0.005). Parallel superfusion with a beta-adrenergic antagonist abrogated this phenomenon. Anti-TNF increased release of NE from normal colonic strips (p<0.05), which demonstrates TNF induced inhibition of preterminal NE release. In colitic mice, anti-TNF did not change NE release. In the presence of anti-TNF, exogenous and endogenous NE stimulated colonic IL-6 secretion via beta-adrenoceptors in normal (p<0.001) but not in colitic mice. In the absence of anti-TNF, endogenous and exogenous NE inhibited IL-6 secretion via the beta-adrenoceptor in normal but not in colitic mice (p<0.01). Colitic mice demonstrated loss of sympathetic nerve fibres.Modulation of mucosal IL-6 is largely dependent on the sympathetic microenvironment and availability of local TNF in normal but not in colitic mice. Anti-TNF strategies may lead to an increase in the proinflammatory cytokine depending on adrenergic tone. This would be relevant with normal sympathetic innervation, which is lost in colitic mice.

Recently, a point mutation (G994 to T transversion) was observed in exon 9 of the platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase gene, and this mutation was found to be associated with a decrease in platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase activity in plasma. The aim of this study was to determine whether the gene mutation was associated with the severity of ulcerative .We studied 53 patients with ulcerative  and 108 control subjects. The plasma platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase genotype was determined as representative cases with three different genotypes (GG, GT, and TT) by an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction.There was no significant difference in genotypic frequency (GG, GT, and TT genotype frequencies were 68, 30, and 2 percent in controls and 55, 45, and 0 percent in ulcerative  patients). Platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase activity in plasma was also measured and did not differ significantly between ulcerative  patients and controls (1.50+/-0.12 vs. 1.81+/-0.34 nmol/min/50 microl, P = 0.60). However, according to the relationship between the platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase gene mutation and clinical characteristics of ulcerative  patients, the operative ratio cause of unresponsiveness to steroid therapy was significantly higher in patients with the GT genotype than in those with the GG genotype (66.7 vs. 27.6 percent, P = 0.019).We conclude that steroid-nonresponsive ulcerative  patients have a high frequency of the platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase gene mutation.

In the present study we explored the neutrophil migration evoked by toxin A in the peritoneal cavities and subcutaneous air pouches of rats and examined the role of macrophages and their inflammatory mediators in this process. Toxin A causes a significant dose-dependent neutrophil influx into the peritoneal cavity, with a maximal response at 0.1 microg/ml and at 4 h. The depletion of macrophages by peritoneal washing prevents the toxin A-induced neutrophil migration into the peritoneal cavity. In contrast, an increase in macrophages induced by peritoneal injection of thioglycolate amplifies this toxin effect on neutrophil migration. Furthermore, the injection of supernatants from toxin A-stimulated macrophages into the rat peritoneal cavity causes significant neutrophil migration. Pretreatment of rats with BWA4C, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, mepacrine, or dexamethasone inhibits the neutrophil migration evoked by toxin A in the peritoneal cavities. However, pretreatment with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin or the platelet-activating factor antagonist BN52021 fails to alter toxin A-induced neutrophil migration. Toxin A was also injected into air pouches of normal rats or rats pretreated with anti-interleukin-1beta (anti-IL-1beta) or anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF-alpha) antibodies. Anti-TNF-alpha or anti-IL-1beta antibodies significantly reduce the neutrophil migration induced by toxin A. These data suggest that neutrophil migration evoked by toxin A is in part dependent on macrophage-derived cytokines, such as TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, and leukotrienes. These mediators may help to explain the intense inflammatory  caused by C. dificile toxin A in an experimental animal model of this disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7517888>Nitric oxide synthase inhibitors 7- and 6-nitroindazole relax smooth muscle in vitro.</a></h2><p>7-Nitroindazole induced concentration-dependent relaxation of precontracted rabbit aorta, dog middle cerebral artery, rat anococcygeus muscle and rat stomach fundus.

Stress is an important factor in the pathogenesis of IBS. Thus, previous inflammation may predispose to IBS by rendering the bowel more susceptible to the impact of stress. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of previous  on stress-induced responses in rats.Acute  was induced in rats by intrarectal administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS), and the rats were allowed to recover for 6 weeks before application of mild restraint stress for 3 consecutive days. In vitro measurements included myeloperoxidase activity, plasma corticosterone levels, interleukin 1 beta messenger RNA expression, and [3H]noradrenaline release from the myenteric plexus.Six weeks after administration of TNBS, stress caused a significant increase in myeloperoxidase activity in TNBS-treated rats but not in stressed controls; plasma corticosterone responses were similar. Stress also caused an exaggerated and significant suppression of [3H]noradrenaline release in TNBS-treated stressed rats compared with stressed controls. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in interleukin 1 beta messenger RNA expression in the colon.Previous  rendered the colon more susceptible to effects of stress on enteric nerve function and also increased some parameters of inflammation in response to stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14671485>The intestinal anti-inflammatory activity of UR-12746S on reactivated experimental  is mediated through downregulation of cytokine production.</a></h2><p>UR-12746S (dersalazine sodium) is cleaved by colonic bacteria delivering the PAF antagonist UR-12715 and 5-ASA. This study describes the anti-inflammatory activity of UR-12746S in an experimental model of reactivated  and its effects on cytokine production.Rats were initially rendered colitic by a colonic instillation of 10 mg of trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS) dissolved in 0.25 ml of 50 % ethanol, and  was reactivated two weeks after by a second administration of the same dose of TNBS. Two groups of colitic rats received UR-12746S (25 and 50 mg/kg daily, p.o.) and colonic damage was evaluated every week for 4 weeks. Different biochemical markers of colonic inflammation were assayed: MPO activity and cytokine (IL-1beta and TNFalpha) levels. Also, the in vitro effects of UR-12715 and 5-ASA on cytokine production were assayed.UR-12746S showed anti-inflammatory effect in reactivated  in rats, as evidenced by a significant reduction in MPO activity. Both doses of UR-12746S decreased IL-1beta production, while only the highest dose assayed inhibited TNFalpha production. In vitro studies revealed that UR-12715 or 5-ASA (from 10(-6) to 10(-4) M) inhibited IL-8 production (30-40%) in HT-29 cells when incubated with LPS. This inhibitory effect was enhanced when both compounds were administered simultaneously at 10(-4) M. In addition, UR-12715 inhibited IL-1beta or TNFalpha production in THP-1 or U937 cells, respectively, when these cells were stimulated by PMA and LPS; whereas 5-ASA only showed a weak effect in inhibiting IL-1beta production.UR-12746S was able to prevent relapse in experimental  and inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine production participates in the intestinal anti-inflammatory activity exerted by this compound.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23571867>Impact of preoperative organ failures on survival in intensive care unit patients with colectomy.</a></h2><p>The present study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of preoperative changes in sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, daily norepinephrine (NE) dose, lactate, C-reactive protein, and white blood cell count among patients with colectomy in the intensive care unit (ICU).We performed a retrospective analysis of 77 colectomized patients (30 female, 47 male) who were treated in a single tertiary-level mixed ICU during 2000-2009.The underlying conditions leading to colectomy included sepsis (31 patients), cardiovascular operations (21 patients), and fulminant Clostridium difficile  (25 patients). The 28-day mortality was 53.3 % (41/77). Nonsurvivors had significantly higher median values than survivors (p < 0.05) for the following parameters: admission SOFA [10.0 (25th-75th percentile 8.0-13.0) vs. 9.0 (6.5-10.0)], highest SOFA [14.0 (12.0-16.0) vs. 12.5 (9.5-14.5)], operative day lactate level (6.3 vs. 2.2 mmol/L), and NE dose (16.8 vs. 9.3 total mg/day).

Inflammatory mediator changes in plasma and colon from tamarins with acute (n = 10) and chronic (n = 10)  (by mucosal biopsy) were assayed by RIAs. Similar inflammatory mediators were found in the CTT's with acute .

In most cases, bleeding from the colon and rectum is self-limiting and requires no specific therapy. Diverticula and angiectasias are the most frequent sources of bleeding. Malignancy,  (inflammatory bowel disease, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and infectious ), ischaemia, anorectal disorders, postpolypectomy bleeding, and HIV-related problems are less frequent causes. The recurrence rate, especially in diverticular bleeding, is high. Resuscitation and haemodynamic stabilisation of the patient is the first step in the management of colonic bleeding. Urgent colonoscopy is the method of choice for diagnosis and therapy. By analogy with peptic ulcer bleeding, risk stratification using stigmata of haemorrhage is gaining more importance.

The inflammatory response elicited by the acetic acid resulted in increased colonic synthesis of platelet activating factor, leukotriene B4 and decreased mucosal somatostatin levels. Subcutaneous administration of octreotide (10 micrograms/rat) 1 hour before or immediately after damage induction, as well as 1 and 23 hours after acetic acid application, resulted in a significant reduction in mucosal damage. The protective effect was accompanied by a significant reduction in platelet activating factor activity, leukotriene B4, and vasoactive intestinal peptide concentrations.

Release of platelet-activating factor by samples of colonic tissue, as measured by bioassay, was determined at various times after induction of inflammation by intracolonic administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid. At the same times, colonic damage was scored and the extent of neutrophil infiltration was assessed by measuring tissue levels of myeloperoxidase activity. Platelet-activating factor release from normal colon averaged 46 +/- 17 pg/g, while not being detectable in samples taken 24 h after induction of inflammation, a time when neutrophil infiltration was maximal. However, substantial release of platelet-activating factor (12-16 times control levels; p less than 0.05) was observed in samples from rats sacrificed 1-3 weeks after induction of inflammation. In a second series of experiments, the effects of treatment with BN52021, a specific platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist, were assessed using this model. Treatment with BN52021 during either the 1st or 2nd weeks after induction of  resulted in significant (p less than 0.05) reductions of colonic damage scores and the wet weight of the distal colon. These results demonstrate that platelet-activating factor release is significantly elevated during the chronic phase of  in this animal model, and that inhibition of the action of platelet-activating factor, through receptor antagonism, leads to a significant reduction of colonic inflammation and ulceration.

Existing drugs for Crohn's disease and ulcerative , for example aminosalicylates and corticosteroids, work at many sites in the inflammatory cascade to control disease activity. These drugs may be associated with significant side-effects and do not always control the disease. Therefore there is an impetus to develop treatments which are safer and more specific for bowel inflammation. Specific inhibitors of inflammatory mediators have recently become available and some have been shown to be effective in animal models of bowel inflammation.

Paradoxically, it also contains nicotine, an anti-inflammatory alkaloid. There is increasing evidence that smokers have a lower incidence of some inflammatory diseases, including ulcerative , and the protective effect involves the activation of a cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway that requires the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) on immune cells. Obesity is characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation, which contributes to insulin resistance. Nicotine significantly improves glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in genetically obese and diet-induced obese mice, which is associated with suppressed adipose tissue inflammation. Inflammation that results in disruption of the epithelial barrier is a hallmark of inflammatory bowel disease, and nicotine is protective in ulcerative . This article summarizes current evidence for the anti-inflammatory effects of nicotine in obesity and ulcerative . Selective agonists for the α7nAChR could represent a promising pharmacological strategy for the treatment of inflammation in obesity and ulcerative . Nevertheless, we should keep in mind that the anti-inflammatory effects of nicotine could be mediated via the expression of several nAChRs on a particular target cell.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27609529>Faecal and Serum Metabolomics in Paediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] is considered to result from the interplay between host and intestinal microbiota but its pathogenesis is incompletely understood. While IBD in adults has shown to be associated with marked changes in body fluid metabolomics, there are only few studies in children. Hence, this prospective study addressed the faecal and serum metabolomics in newly diagnosed paediatric IBD.Paediatric patients with IBD undergoing diagnostic endoscopies and controls also with endoscopy but no signs of inflammation provided blood and stool samples in a tertiary care hospital. Blood inflammatory markers and faecal calprotectin levels were determined. The serum and faecal metabolomics were determined using ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer.Serum and faecal metabolite profiles in newly diagnosed paediatric IBD patients were different from healthy controls and categorized Crohn's disease and ulcerative  [UC] patients into separate groups. In serum, amino acid metabolism, folate biosynthesis and signalling pathways were perturbed in Crohn's disease; in UC also sphingolipid metabolic pathways were perturbed when compared to controls. In faecal samples, there was an increased level of several metabolites in UC in contrast to low or intermediate levels in Crohn's disease. There was a clear correlation with the level of inflammation, i.e. faecal calprotectin levels and the profile of various biologically important metabolites [carnosine, ribose and, most significantly, choline].Characterization of inflammatory pattern using metabolomics analysis is a promising tool for better understanding disease pathogenesis of paediatric IBD.Copyright © 2016 European Crohn’s and  Organisation (ECCO).

Additionally, its anti-inflammatory properties were analysed in two different models of dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-induced , BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, the latter being dependent on IL-17.DS, when administered for 7 days, showed intestinal anti-inflammatory effects in TNBS-induced ; these effects were observed both macroscopically and through the profile of inflammatory mediators (TNF, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-17). Although the 2 day treatment with DS did not induce intestinal anti-inflammatory effects, it was sufficient to reduce the enhanced IL-17 expression. DS showed beneficial effects on DSS-induced  in C57BL/6 mice and reduced colonic pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-17.

The effects of treatment with BN52021 were compared to those of treatment with 5-aminosalicylic acid. BN52021 and 5-aminosalicyclic acid were without significant effect on colonic damage score when administered intracolonically on days 1-4 after induction of . However, when given on days 4-7 after induction of , both drugs significantly accelerated the healing of ulcers and reduced the incidence of adhesions and diarrhea. Intraperitoneal administration of BN52021 also resulted in a significant reduction of colonic damage scores, while administration of 5-aminosalicyclic acid via this route was without significant effect. Using an in vitro superfusion system, the effects of PAF-acether on contractility of segments of ascending colon were assessed. Tissue segments from normal rats contracted to doses of PAF-acether as low as 0.5 pg. However, non-inflamed segments of ascending colon from rats in which  was induced 2 weeks earlier were relatively insensitive to PAF-acether. The results of the present study demonstrate that PAF-acether is unlikely to play an important role in the acute inflammatory response in this model, but may be important in the prolongation of inflammation and ulceration in this model. The studies on contractility of ascending colon suggest that changes in tissue sensitivity to PAF-acether may occur as a consequence of inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21969563>Intestinal inflammation allows Salmonella to use  to compete with the microbiota.</a></h2><p>Conventional wisdom holds that microbes support their growth in vertebrate hosts by exploiting a large variety of nutrients.

However, several studies indicate that the immunosuppressive properties of FTY720 may alternatively be due to tolerogenic activities via modulation of dendritic cell differentiation or based on direct effects on CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Treg). As Treg play an important role for the cure of inflammatory , we used the Th1-mediated 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)  model to address the therapeutic potential of FTY720 in vivo. A rectal enema of TNBS was given to BALB/c mice. FTY720 was administered i.p. from days 0 to 3 or 3 to 5. FTY720 substantially reduced all clinical, histopathologic, macroscopic, and microscopic parameters of  analyzed. The therapeutic effects of FTY720 were associated with a down-regulation of IL-12p70 and subsequent Th1 cytokines. Importantly, FTY720 treatment resulted in a prominent up-regulation of FoxP3, IL-10, TGFbeta, and CTLA4. Supporting the hypothesis that FTY720 directly affects functional activity of CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg, we measured a significant increase of CD25 and FoxP3 expression in isolated lamina propria CD4(+) T cells of FTY720-treated mice. The impact of FTY720 on Treg induction was further confirmed by concomitant in vivo blockade of CTLA4 or IL-10R which significantly abrogated its therapeutic activity. In conclusion, our data provide clear evidence that in addition to its well-established effects on migration FTY720 leads to a specific down-regulation of proinflammatory signals while simultaneously inducing functional activity of CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg.

Significant but comparable public speaking stress-induced increases in LPS-stimulated TNF-alpha and IL-10, as well as in CD2/CD28-stimulated IFN-gamma were observed in both groups. UC demonstrated significantly reduced baseline IFN-gamma production, as well as significantly lower basal cortisol and prolactin levels. The in vitro beta-adrenergic stimulation of PBCs revealed reduced IL-10 response in UC.Psychosocial stress-induced activation of the neuroendocrine and sympatho-adrenal systems remain unaltered in UC, suggesting that the mechanism(s) mediating effects of psychological stress on disease activity are likely operative downstream at the level of the intestine. However, UC patients show disturbances in basal endocrine and cytokine measures. Together with our in vitro evidence of disturbed adrenergic regulation of IL-10 production by stimulated PBCs in UC, these may indicate the existence of subtle disturbance of peripheral cellular neuroendocrine-immune interactions in UC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16941250>The effects of Gingko biloba extract on acetic acid-induced  in rats.</a></h2><p>Gingko biloba is an antioxidant substance which has antagonistic activity on platelet-activating factor.

Current murine models of CDI rely on antibiotic pretreatment to establish clinical phenotypes. In this report, the  outbreak occurs in F1 mice linked to alterations in the parental diet. The diagnosis of CDI in the affected mice was confirmed by cecal/colonic histopathology, the presence of  bacteria in fecal/colonic culture, and detection of  toxins. F1 mice from parents fed the methyl supplementation diet also had significantly reduced survival ( < 0.0001) compared with F1 mice from parents fed the control diet. When we tested the 16N203 outbreak strain in an established mouse model of antibiotic-induced CDI, we confirmed that this strain is pathogenic. Our serendipitous observations from this spontaneous outbreak of  in association with a pre- and perinatal methyl donor diet suggest the important role that diet may play in host defense and CDI risk factors.  infection (CDI) has become the leading cause of infectious diarrhea in hospitals worldwide, owing its preeminence to the emergence of hyperendemic strains, such as ribotype 027 (RT027). A major CDI risk factor is antibiotic exposure, which alters gut microbiota, resulting in the loss of colonization resistance. Current murine models of CDI also depend on pretreatment of animals with antibiotics to establish disease. The outbreak that we report here is unique in that the CDI occurred in mice with no antibiotic exposure and is associated with a pre- and perinatal methyl supplementation donor diet intervention study. Our investigation subsequently reveals that the outbreak strain that we term 16N203 is an RT027 strain, and this isolated strain is also pathogenic in an established murine model of CDI (with antibiotics). Our report of this spontaneous outbreak offers additional insight into the importance of environmental factors, such as diet, and CDI susceptibility.Copyright © 2019 Mau et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17982090>Differential expression of inflammatory and fibrogenic genes and their regulation by NF-kappaB inhibition in a mouse model of chronic .</a></h2><p>Fibrosis is a major complication of chronic inflammation, as seen in Crohn's disease and ulcerative , two forms of inflammatory bowel diseases. To elucidate inflammatory signals that regulate fibrosis, we investigated gene expression changes underlying chronic inflammation and fibrosis in trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced murine . Six weekly 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid enemas were given to establish  and temporal gene expression patterns were obtained at 6-, 8-, 10-, and 12-wk time points. The 6-wk point, TNBS-w6, was the active, chronic inflammatory stage of the model marked by macrophage, neutrophil, and CD3(+) and CD4(+) T cell infiltrates in the colon, consistent with the idea that this model is T cell immune response driven. Proinflammatory genes Cxcl1, Ccl2, Il1b, Lcn2, Pla2g2a, Saa3, S100a9, Nos2, Reg2, and Reg3g, and profibrogenic extracellular matrix genes Col1a1, Col1a2, Col3a1, and Lum (lumican), encoding a collagen-associated proteoglycan, were up-regulated at the active/chronic inflammatory stages. Rectal administration of the NF-kappaB p65 antisense oligonucleotide reduced but did not abrogate inflammation and fibrosis completely. The antisense oligonucleotide treatment reduced total NF-kappaB by 60% and down-regulated most proinflammatory genes. However, Ccl2, a proinflammatory chemokine known to promote fibrosis, was not down-regulated. Among extracellular matrix gene expressions Lum was suppressed while Col1a1 and Col3a1 were not. Thus, effective treatment of fibrosis in inflammatory bowel disease may require early and complete blockade of NF-kappaB with particular attention to specific proinflammatory and profibrogenic genes that remain active at low levels of NF-kappaB.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26608656>Noninflammatory upregulation of nerve growth factor underlies gastric hypersensitivity induced by neonatal colon inflammation.</a></h2><p>Gastric hypersensitivity is one of the key contributors to the postprandial symptoms of epigastric pain/discomfort, satiety, and fullness in functional dyspepsia patients. Epidemiological studies found that adverse early-life experiences are risk factors for the development of gastric hypersensitivity. Preclinical studies found that neonatal colon inflammation elevates plasma norepinephrine (NE), which upregulates expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) in the muscularis externa of the gastric fundus. Our goal was to investigate the cellular mechanisms by which NE upregulates the expression of NGF in gastric hypersensitive (GHS) rats, which were subjected previously to neonatal colon inflammation. Neonatal colon inflammation upregulated NGF protein, but not mRNA, in the gastric fundus of GHS rats. Western blotting showed upregulation of p110γ of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1), pAKT(Ser473), and phosphorylated 4E-binding protein (p4E-BP1)(Thr70), suggesting AKT activation and enhanced NGF protein translation. AKT inhibitor MK-2206 blocked the upregulation of NGF in the fundus of GHS rats. Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), the major NGF-degrading protease, was suppressed, indicating that NGF degradation was impeded. Incubation of fundus muscularis externa with NE upregulated NGF by modulating the protein translation and degradation pathways. Yohimbine, an α2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, upregulated plasma NE and NGF expression by activating the protein translation and degradation pathways in naive rats. In contrast, a cocktail of adrenergic receptor antagonists suppressed the upregulation of NGF by blocking the activation of the protein translation and degradation pathways. Our findings provide evidence that the elevation of plasma NE induces NGF expression in the gastric fundus.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2084366>[Platelet activating factor as a mediator of lesions of the digestive system].</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12745545>Effect of pharmacologically induced smooth muscle activation on permeability in murine .</a></h2><p>Both intestinal permeability and contractility are altered in inflammatory bowel disease. Little is known about their mutual relation. Therefore, an in vitro organ bath technique was developed to investigate the simultaneous effects of inflammation on permeability and smooth muscle contractility in different segments of the colon.BALB/c mice were exposed to a 10% dextran sulphate sodium drinking water solution for 7 days to induce a mild , while control mice received normal tap water. Intestinal segments were placed in an oxygenated organ bath containing Krebs buffer. Permeability was measured by the transport of the marker molecules 3H-mannitol and 14C-polyethyleneglycol 4000. Contractility was measured through a pressure sensor. Smooth muscle relaxation was obtained by salbutamol and l-phenylephrine, whereas contraction was achieved by carbachol and 1-(3-chlorophenyl)-biguanide.The intensity of mucosal inflammation increased throughout the colon. Also, regional differences were observed in intestinal permeability. In both normal and inflamed distal colon segments, permeability was diminished compared with proximal colon segments and the non-inflamed ileum. Permeability in inflamed distal colon segments was significantly decreased compared with normal distal segments. Pharmacologically induced relaxation of smooth muscles did not affect this diminished permeability, although an increased motility positively affected permeability in inflamed and non-inflamed distal colon.Inflammation and permeability is inversely related. The use of pro-kinetics could counteract this disturbed permeability and, in turn, could regulate the disturbed production of inflammatory mediators.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13640933>Acute allergic  presenting the clinical picture of acute appendicitis; report of a case.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1929756>[Study of platelet-activating factor (PAF) in stools of newborn infants with hemorrhagic ].</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19944332>Torsades de Pointes with QT prolongation related to donepezil use.</a></h2><p>An 83-year-old female, who had a history of anterior myocardial infarction, was treated for Alzheimer's disease with donepezil.

On admission, her heart rate was 54 beats/min with regular rhythm. Laboratory data showed a low plasma potassium level. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed poor R progression, ST elevation, negative T in precordial leads, and marked QT prolongation. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed the enlargement of the left atrium and aneurysmal area at the apex. Torsades de Pointes (TdP) with syncope and convulsion were confirmed on ECG monitoring twice after admission.

After these treatments, her heart rate increased and we did not detect TdP again. With the aging population in Japan, prescriptions for donepezil are increasing. We have to be vigilant for syncope in patients taking donepezil, which is possibly related to QT prolongation and TdP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2019356>Presence of PAF-acether in stool of patients with pouch ileoanal anastomosis and pouchitis.</a></h2><p>Platelet-activating factor is an endogenous phospholipid produced by a wide variety of inflammatory cells. Platelet-activating factor induces severe pathological changes in various organs and, among numerous potent effects, causes bowel necrosis. Pouchitis is a poorly understood complication of ileoanal pouch anastomosis which occurs in patients who undergo surgery for ulcerative . The aim of this study was to measure ileal or fecal platelet-activating factor and lyso platelet-activating factor contents in normal volunteers (n = 12), in patients with terminal ileostomy (n = 7), and in patients with ileoanal anastomosis (n = 15) (8 patients have pouchitis defined by the presence of ulcerations on the reservoir). Fecal samples were processed and assessed for platelet-activating factor by platelet aggregation assay. The aggregating material was further characterized as platelet-activating factor by the following: inhibition of the platelet aggregation it induced by specific platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist (BN 52021; IHB, Le Plessis Robinson, France); abolition of platelet aggregation after incubation with phospholipase A2 but not with lipase A1; and retention time on high-performance liquid chromatography. Stool platelet-activating factor content (in nanograms per gram of stool, mean +/- 1SD) was significantly increased in patients with pouchitis (22.2 +/- 16 ng/g) compared with patients with normal reservoir (1.59 +/- 0.63 ng/g, P less than 0.01), terminal ileostomy (0.59 +/- 0.43 ng/g, P less than 0.01), and healthy controls (0 +/- 0 ng/g of stool, P less than 0.001). Lyso platelet-activating factor (nanograms per gram of stool) was increased in patients with pouchitis (10,704 +/- 5499 ng/g) compared with patients with normal reservoir (4721 +/- 4549 ng/g of stool, P less than 0.05), terminal ileostomy (3042 +/- 4019 ng/g, P less than 0.02), and healthy volunteers (128 +/- 107 ng/g, P less than 0.001). In patients with ileoanal anastomosis and pouchitis, increased platelet-activating factor production could be implicated in the inflammation and ulcerations observed in the reservoir.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10521992>Platelet activating factor in stool from patients with ulcerative  and Crohn's disease.</a></h2><p>Platelet activating factor (PAF) is a potent endogenous mediator in inflammatory processes. The role of this mediator, especially in connection with the unknown etiology of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, remains poorly understood. A determination of PAF in stool may be helpful in recognizing quiescent inflammations in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. A simple and reliable method for the determination of PAF in stool seems to be necessary to achieve this goal.PAF analysis was performed with the help of a commercial PAF radioimmunoassay (RIA) kit after solid phase extraction (SPE) of ethanolic stool extracts. PAF was determined in stool from 10 healthy volunteers (m = 4; f = 6), 13 patients with ulcerative  (m = 7; f = 6) and 15 patients with Crohn's disease (m = 9; f = 6). Fecal PAF concentrations were compared with activity index of disease, endoscopic index, localization of lesions, leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), medical prednisolone treatment, sex and age of the patients.In healthy volunteers, no PAF was detectable in stool. In patients with Crohn's disease 319.2 +/- 143.5 pg PAF/g stool and in patients with ulcerative  824.9 +/- 408.7 pg PAF/g stool could be determined. A significant correlation (p < 0.05) was found between PAF-content in stool and the endoscopical index and intestinal localization of inflammatory lesions. No further correlations could be detected in our patients.Fecal PAF assessment may be used clinically as a non-invasive method to estimate severity of mucosal inflammation in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4141264>The autonomic control of colonic mucin secretion in the mouse.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28526351>Docosahexaenoyl serotonin emerges as most potent inhibitor of IL-17 and CCL-20 released by blood mononuclear cells from a series of N-acyl serotonins identified in human intestinal tissue.</a></h2><p>Fatty acid amides (FAAs), conjugates of fatty acids with , mono-amine neurotransmitters or amino acids are a class of molecules that display diverse functional roles in different cells and tissues. Recently we reported that one of the serotonin-fatty acid conjugates, docosahexaenoyl serotonin (DHA-5-HT), previously found in gut tissue of mouse and pig, attenuates the IL-23-IL-17 signaling axis in LPS-stimulated mice macrophages. However, its presence and effects in humans remained to be elucidated. Here, we report for the first time its identification in human intestinal (colon) tissue, along with a series of related N-acyl serotonins. Furthermore, we tested these fatty acid conjugates for their ability to inhibit the release of IL-17 and CCL-20 by stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Serotonin conjugates with palmitic acid (PA-5-HT), stearic acid (SA-5-HT) and oleic acid (OA-5-HT) were detected in higher levels than arachidonoyl serotonin (AA-5-HT) and DHA-5-HT, while eicosapentaenoyl serotonin (EPA-5-HT) could not be quantified. Among these, DHA-5-HT was the most potent in inhibiting IL-17 and CCL-20, typical Th17 pro-inflammatory mediators, by Concanavalin A (ConA)-stimulated human PBMCs. These results underline the idea that DHA-5-HT is a gut-specific endogenously produced mediator with the capacity to modulate the IL-17/Th17 signaling response.

In this study, we investigated whether this upregulation is a marker also of celiac disease-induced atrophy. The levels of the cannabinoid CB(1) receptor, of the endocannabinoids, anandamide, and 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG), and of the anti-inflammatory mediator palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) were analyzed in bioptic samples from the duodenal mucosa of celiac patients at first diagnosis assessed by the determination of antiendomysial antibodies and histological examination. Samples were analyzed during the active phase of atrophy and after remission and compared to control samples from non-celiac patients. The levels of anandamide and PEA were significantly elevated (approx. 2- and 1.8-fold, respectively) in active celiac patients and so were those of CB(1) receptors. Anandamide levels returned to normal after remission with a gluten-free diet. We also analyzed endocannabinoid and PEA levels in the jejunum of rats 2, 3, and 7 days after treatment with methotrexate, which causes inflammatory features (assessed by histopathological analyses and myeloperoxidase activity) similar to those of celiac patients. In both muscle/serosa and mucosa layers, the levels of anandamide, 2-AG, and PEA peaked 3 days after treatment and returned to basal levels at remission, 7 days after treatment. Thus, intestinal endocannabinoid levels peak with atrophy and regress with remission in both celiac patients and methotrexate-treated rats. The latter might be used as a model to study the role of the endocannabinoid system in celiac disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17656655>(-)-(1R,2R)-3-(3-dimethylamino-1-ethyl-2-methyl-propyl)-phenol hydrochloride (tapentadol HCl): a novel mu-opioid receptor agonist/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor with broad-spectrum analgesic properties.</a></h2><p>(-)-(1R,2R)-3-(3-dimethylamino-1-ethyl-2-methyl-propyl)-phenol hydrochloride (tapentadol HCl) is a novel micro-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist (Ki = 0.1 microM; relative efficacy compared with morphine 88% in a [35S]guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate binding assay) and NE reuptake inhibitor (Ki = 0.5 microM for synaptosomal reuptake inhibition). In vivo intracerebral microdialysis showed that tapentadol, in contrast to morphine, produces large increases in extracellular levels of NE (+450% at 10 mg/kg i.p.). Tapentadol exhibited analgesic effects in a wide range of animal models of acute and chronic pain [hot plate, tail-flick, writhing, Randall-Selitto, mustard oil , chronic constriction injury (CCI), and spinal nerve ligation (SNL)], with ED50 values ranging from 8.2 to 13 mg/kg after i.p. administration in rats. Despite a 50-fold lower binding affinity to MOR, the analgesic potency of tapentadol was only two to three times lower than that of morphine, suggesting that the dual mode of action of tapentadol may result in an opiate-sparing effect. A role of NE in the analgesic efficacy of tapentadol was directly demonstrated in the SNL model, where the analgesic effect of tapentadol was strongly reduced by the alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine but only moderately attenuated by the MOR antagonist naloxone, whereas the opposite was seen for morphine. Tolerance development to the analgesic effect of tapentadol in the CCI model was twice as slow as that of morphine. It is suggested that the broad analgesic profile of tapentadol and its relative resistance to tolerance development may be due to a dual mode of action consisting of both MOR activation and NE reuptake inhibition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8110248>Cedemin, a Ginkgo biloba extract, should not be considered as a PAF antagonist.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21958875>Vascular contribution of adrenomedullin to microcirculatory improvement in experimental .</a></h2><p>The effect of adrenomedullin (AM), a peptide that has demonstrated vasodilatory activity, was studied in the colon and small mesenteric arteries of rats in a chronic model of inflammatory bowel disease. AM (50 ng/kg/day) was administered i.p. daily, starting 24h after trinitrobenzensulfonic acid (TNBS, 30 mg) instillation. After 14 days, rats were sacrificed, colons were macroscopically analyzed and biochemical parameters (myeloperoxidase activity, cytokines, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) as well as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression) were determined. Vascular function of small mesenteric arteries was assessed by addition of phenylephrine (10⁻⁸ to 10⁻⁴ mol/L) and participation of COX and NOS pathways was also evaluated by using different inhibitors: indomethacin, NS-398, L-NNA, and 1400 w. Chronic AM treatment significantly reduced colonic macroscopic damage and inflammation markers. TNBS instillation induced COX-2 and iNOS expressions in colon and small mesenteric arteries; AM treatment decreased COX-2 expression only in microvessels from rats with . An attenuation of phenylephrine-induced contraction was detected in small mesenteric arteries from both TNBS and AM-treated rats. COX and NOS inhibitors altered the contractile ability of phenylephrine in small mesenteric arteries from TNBS rats, suggesting the involvement of COX-2 and iNOS derived factors in the deleterious effect of TNBS on vascular reactivity; AM administration was able to reduce such alteration. Finally, treatment with the peptide significantly reduced colonic nitric oxide (NO) levels, without affecting plasma concentration. In conclusion, AM showed beneficial effects in the restoration of vascular function through the regulation of vasoactive products derived from COX-2 and iNOS.Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V.

On day 6, colonic nitric oxide synthase and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, histology, intestinal muscle growth, NADPH-diaphorase, and myenteric nerve function were assessed. Food intake and body weight were reduced during the first 72 h of . On day 6 post-TNB, a fourfold increase in mucosal nitric oxide synthase, a 30-fold increase in MPO, and a fivefold elevation in plasma nitrite were measured. Smooth muscle hyperplasia and hypertrophy in both colonic muscle layers, numerous diaphorase-positive macrophages in the myenteric plexus, and a suppression of myenteric nerve function were also observed. Unlike D-NAME, oral L-NAME reduced MPO and intestinal muscle hyperplasia by > 90%. Likewise, plasma nitrite and colonic nitric oxide synthase were reduced by > 70%. L-NAME completely prevented macrophage infiltration into the muscle. Conversely, it had no effect on anorexia or intestinal smooth muscle hypertrophy, nor did it affect suppressed myenteric nerve neurotransmitter release.

However, only scant data have been reported on the regulation of PEA levels during pathological conditions in animals or, particularly, humans. We review the current literature on PEA and report the results of three separate studies indicating that its concentrations are significantly increased during three different inflammatory and neuropathic conditions, two of which have been assessed in humans, and one in a mouse model. In patients affected with chronic low back pain, blood PEA levels were not significantly different from those of healthy volunteers, but were significantly and differentially increased (1.6-fold, P<0.01, N=10 per group) 30 min following an osteopathic manipulative treatment. In the second study, the paw skin levels of PEA in mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetic neuropathic pain were found to be significantly higher (1.5-fold, P<0.005, N=5) than those of control mice.

Colonic biopsy specimens from patients with active ulcerative  and controls were incubated for 4 h in Tyrode's buffer in the presence or absence of 0.2 microM calcium ionophore (A23187) or 50 microliter of antihuman immunoglobulin E. Platelet-activating factor was determined in the tissue by aggregation assay after extraction with 80% ethanol and was confirmed by thin-layer chromatography and its inactivation by phospholipases. Platelet-activating factor was not detected in normal mucosa. Only A23187 and antihuman immunoglobulin E stimulated its activity: mean +/- SE, 43.2 +/- 8.6 and 33.0 +/- 6.1 pg/10 mg wet wt, respectively. In active ulcerative  basal platelet-activating factor activity was 8.9 +/- 3.5 pg/10 mg wet wt. A23187 and antihuman immunoglobulin E induced significantly higher stimulation of platelet-activating factor synthesis when compared with their effects on normal mucosa: 200 +/- 28 and 70 +/- 8.3 pg/10 mg wet wt, respectively. The enhanced stimulation induced by A23187 was dose-dependently inhibited by salazopyrine, 5-amino-salicylic acid, and prednisolone, but not by sulfapyridine. It is thus suggested that platelet-activating factor may be involved in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory response in ulcerative  and that its inhibition by steroids, 5-aminosalicylic acid, and salazopyrine may be an additional mechanism to explain their therapeutic effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12770936>Altered prejunctional modulation of intestinal cholinergic and noradrenergic pathways by alpha2-adrenoceptors in the presence of experimental .</a></h2><p>1 This study investigates the influence of intestinal inflammation on: (1) the control of intestinal neurotransmission and motility by prejunctional alpha(2)-adrenoceptors and (2) the expression of intestinal alpha(2)-adrenoceptors.

The aim of the present study was to determine the direct effect of PAF on intestinal epithelial cell ion transport, and to delineate the mechanisms of regulation. Ion transport was evaluated by measuring short circuit current (I(sc)) in HT29-CL19A cell monolayers using Ussing chambers. PAF receptor polarity was assessed using domain-selective biotinylation followed by immunoprecipitation and streptavidin blotting of intact epithelial monolayers. PAF (1-200 microM) stimulated I(sc) that followed the direction of a Cl(-) gradient and was specifically inhibited by the Cl(-) channel blockers glybenclamide, 2,2' iminodibenzoic acid and 4,4' diisothiocyanostilbene-2, 2' disulfonic acid, but was unaffected by the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis with indomethacin. Stimulated I(sc) was only detected after apical addition of PAF, correlating with the results of biotinylation experiments indicating an exclusive apical polarity of the PAF receptor. PAF receptor antagonists CV6209 and octylonium bromide abolished PAF-stimulated I(sc). Thus, mucosal acting PAF directly and specifically stimulates ion transport via activation of an apical Cl(-) channel in intestinal epithelial cell monolayers independent of prostaglandin biosynthesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14138124>[ROLE OF ADRENERGIC AND CHOLINERGIC SUBSTANCES IN SOME NEUROTIC SYMPTOMS].</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25384424>N-Acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidase inhibition increases colon N-palmitoylethanolamine levels and counteracts murine .</a></h2><p>N-Palmitoylethanolamine or palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is an anti-inflammatory compound that was recently shown to exert peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α-dependent beneficial effects on colon inflammation. The actions of PEA are terminated following hydrolysis by 2 enzymes: fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), and the less-studied N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidase (NAAA). This study aims to investigate the effects of inhibiting the enzymes responsible for PEA hydrolysis in colon inflammation in order to propose a potential therapeutic target for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Two murine models of IBD were used to assess the effects of NAAA inhibition, FAAH inhibition, and PEA on macroscopic signs of colon inflammation, macrophage/neutrophil infiltration, and the expression of proinflammatory mediators in the colon, as well as on the -related systemic inflammation. NAAA inhibition increases PEA levels in the colon and reduces colon inflammation and systemic inflammation, similarly to PEA. FAAH inhibition, however, does not increase PEA levels in the colon and does not affect the macroscopic signs of colon inflammation or immune cell infiltration. This is the first report of an anti-inflammatory effect of a systemically administered NAAA inhibitor. Because NAAA is the enzyme responsible for the control of PEA levels in the colon, we put forth this enzyme as a potential therapeutic target in chronic inflammation in general and IBD in particular.© FASEB.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22209002>Abnormal anandamide metabolism in celiac disease.</a></h2><p>The endocannabinoid system has been extensively investigated in experimental  and inflammatory bowel disease, but not in celiac disease, where only a single study showed increased levels of the major endocannabinoid anandamide in the atrophic mucosa. On this basis, we aimed to investigate anandamide metabolism in celiac disease by analyzing transcript levels (through quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction), protein concentration (through immunoblotting) and activity (through radioassays) of enzymes responsible for anandamide synthesis (N-acylphosphatidyl- specific phospholipase D, NAPE-PLD) and degradation (fatty acid amide hydrolase, FAAH) in the duodenal mucosa of untreated celiac patients, celiac patients on a gluten-free diet for at least 12 months and control subjects. Also, treated celiac biopsies cultured ex vivo with peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin were investigated. Our in vivo experiments showed that mucosal NAPE-PLD expression and activity are higher in untreated celiac patients than treated celiac patients and controls, with no significant difference between the latter two groups. In keeping with the in vivo data, the ex vivo activity of NAPE-PLD was significantly enhanced by incubation of peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin with treated celiac biopsies. On the contrary, in vivo mucosal FAAH expression and activity did not change in the three groups of patients, and accordingly, mucosal FAAH activity was not influenced by treatment with peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin. In conclusion, our findings provide a possible pathophysiological explanation for the increased anandamide concentration previously shown in active celiac mucosa.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We studied how leukocytapheresis mobilizes bone marrow cells into the peripheral circulation in patients with active UC. Leukocytapheresis transiently reduced peripheral leukocytes, followed by an overshoot increase with emergence of immature leukocytes. The numbers of colonies and CD34(+) cells were comparable between UC patients and normal controls. Shortly after leukocytapheresis, the numbers of both colonies and CD34(+) cells increased significantly in UC patients (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0372, respectively). This was not associated with changes in the concentration of circulating cytokines or epinephrine. These results indicate that leukocytapheresis mobilizes bone marrow cells into the circulation. This cell replacement may partly explain the therapeutic benefit in UC. The functional role of the mobilized bone marrow cells in affected intestine remains to be characterized.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8536524>Intraluminal excretion of PAF, lysoPAF, and acetylhydrolase in patients with ulcerative .</a></h2><p>PAF-acether (PAF) is a phospholipid synthesized by numerous inflammatory cells. PAF can produce several pathological changes in various organs, especially in the colon. In animals PAF causes colonic ulceration and inflammation, which are similar to the anatomic lesions seen in human ulcerative . The aim of this study was to measure in vivo colonic production of PAF in active ulcerative  using a modified colonic perfusion method. Ten patients with active ulcerative  and six control patients were investigated. A colonic segment was continuously perfused with a buffer and the liquid was recovered 20 cm distally, after a 45-min period of equilibration, at 20-min intervals. PAF, lysoPAF, and acetylhydrolase were measured in the colonic samples. PAF and lysoPAF outputs were significantly higher in patients with active ulcerative  compared to controls patients. There was a significant correlation between colonic PAF output and, respectively, macroscopic mucosal lesions and myeloperoxidase colonic output. We thus conclude: (1) the colonic perfusion method allows in vivo study of the metabolism of PAF during ulcerative  and could also be used to study the efficiency of PAF antagonists in UC; and (2) colonic production of PAF is increased during ulcerative  and correlated to local injury and inflammation. Whether or not PAF plays a role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative  remains open for further investigations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5311710>Selective arterial drug infusions in the treatment of acute gastrointestinal bleeding.

We found it possible to add an amino group on the aromatic moiety of our reported 1-[(1-acyl-4-piperidyl)methyl]-1H-2-methylimidazo[4,5-c]pyridine derivatives or on British Biotech compounds BB-882 and BB-823 maintaining a high level of activity as PAF antagonist. A selected compound UR-12715 (49c) showed an IC(50) of 8 nM in the in vitro PAF-induced aggregation assay, and an ID(50) of 29 microg/kg in the in vivo PAF-induced hypotension test in normotensive rats. Through attachment of 49c to the 5-ASA via azo functionality we obtained UR-12746 (70). Pharmacokinetics experiments with [14C]-70 allow us to reach the following conclusions, critical in the design of these new prodrugs of 5-ASA. Neither the whole molecule 70 nor the carrier 49c were absorbed after oral administration of [14C]-70 in rat as was demonstrated by the absence of plasma levels of radioactivity and the high recovery of it in feces. Effective cleavage of azo bond (84%) by microflora in the colon is achieved. These facts ensure high topical concentrations of 5-ASA and 49c in the colon. Additionally, 70 exhibited a potent anticolitic effect in the trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced  model in the rat. This profile suggests that UR-12746 (70) provides an attractive new approach to the treatment of ulcerative .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4153248>[Therapy of ulcerative ].</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8273593>Inflammatory mediator changes in cotton-top tamarins (CTT) after SC-41930 anti-colitic therapy.</a></h2><p>Use of the CTT model provides insight into the inflammatory mediator contribution in the pathogenesis of idiopathic . To evaluate anti-colitic efficacy, the leukotriene B4 receptor antagonist and anti-inflammatory agent, SC-41930, was administered (10 mg/kg BW by gavage BID) for 8 weeks to CTTs with histologically confirmed persistent and defined active . The inflammatory mediators LTB4, PGE2, TXB2, and PAF were assayed in colonic dialysate that was collected after 1 1/2 h from four CTTs pre-, mid-, and post-treatment, frozen at -70 degrees C, and analyzed by RIA after HPLC purification. LTB4 levels were lower at mid- and post-treatment and had little inter-animal variation post-treatment. PGE2 and PAF levels were elevated during SC-41930 treatment, but there was a trend towards lower thromboxane B2 levels. Reduced LTB4 (PMN degranulation and chemotaxis) and increased PGE2 (mucosal-protective effect) may, in part, explain the observed efficacy of SC-41930 in active tamarin .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16501857>Increased aggregation response of platelets in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Platelets play an important role in hemostatic and inflammatory responses. To evaluate any potential enhancement of platelet activity in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we measured the platelet aggregation responses to various stimuli.Twenty-two healthy controls, 24 patients with ulcerative  (UC) and 25 patients with Crohn's Disease (CD) were studied. The aggregation responses induced by three agonists (epinephrine, collagen, and ADP) were measured by an 8-channel aggregometer. The platelet-derived microparticles (PDMP) levels were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Twenty-one out of the 22 healthy controls did not respond to epinephrine (0.1 microg/ml), collagen (0.2 microg/ml), or ADP (1.0 microM). Eight out of the 12 active UC patients were sensitive to all agonists, and 4 patients showed increased sensitivity to epinephrine/collagen or epinephrine/ADP. Three out of the 12 inactive UC patients were normal, but 9 of these patients showed increased sensitivity, mainly to epinephrine. Ten out of the 12 active CD patients were sensitive to all agonists, and 2 active CD patients were sensitive to epinephrine/collagen or epinephrine/ADP. Eight out of the 13 inactive CD patients were sensitive to two or all agonists. Even after remission, almost all of the UC and CD patients showed some increased sensitivity to the agonists. The platelet number and the plasma PDMP levels were significantly higher in the active IBD patients than in the control group.Platelet aggregation responses are enhanced in IBD, even in inactive-phase patients. This increased sensitivity of the platelets may play an important role in the pathophysiology of IBD.</p></html>
