No significant differences were found, indicating that it was not possible to correlate the good therapeutic effect of antibiotics reported in PPP with a decrease in the fatty  content of pus from the pustles. However, the series was small and investigations are now in progress to establish whether small differences of significance can be demonstrated in a larger series.

Fatty -competition studies on the [3H]oleic .FA-p34-complex show that oleic, alpha-linoleic, gamma-linolenic, and arachidonic acids have IC50 values of about 1 microM, whereas  and stearic acids are poor competitors. The binding of arachidonic  is saturable with a single class of binding site per FA-p34, and a dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.13 microM is calculated. The individual subunits MRP8 and MRP14 show no binding properties for fatty acids, whereas a p34 complex reconstituted in vitro by the recombinant molecules exhibits binding properties, suggesting that the fatty -binding site of FA-p34 is created through heterocomplex formation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that lowering free Ca2+ levels to 16 nM results in a loss of the fatty -binding capacity of purified FA-p34. In calcium-induced differentiating keratinocytes, the amounts of FA-p34 are increased in the particulate (2.0 +/- 0.5 pmol of [3H]oleic /mg protein) and in the cytosolic (4.5 +/- 0.6 pmol of [3H]oleic /mg protein) fractions, whereas no FA-p34 can be detected in non-differentiated cultured keratinocytes. In abnormally differentiated keratinocytes () and in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, FA-p34 is highly expressed (31.35 +/- 1.6 and 349.8 +/- 17.9 pmol of [3H]oleic /mg protein, respectively), pointing toward a role for this heteromer in mediating effects of unsaturated fatty acids in a calcium-dependent way during cell differentiation and/or inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8618046>Optimization of physiological lipid mixtures for barrier repair.</a></h2><p>Three stratum corneum lipids, ceramides, cholesterol (CHOL), and free fatty acids (FA), are required for permeability barrier homeostasis. Recent studies have shown that application of one or two of these lipids to perturbed skin delays barrier recovery; only equimolar mixtures allow normal recovery. We asked here whether any physiological lipid mixtures improve barrier repair, as assessed by transepidermal water loss. Whereas an equimolar ratio of ceramides, CHOL, and FA (either the essential fatty , linoleic , or the nonessential FAs,  or stearic acids) allows normal repair, further acceleration of barrier repair occurs as the ratio of any of these ingredients is increased up to 3-fold. Similar preliminary results were obtained in damaged human skin. Likewise, while acylceramides alone delay barrier recovery, acylceramides: CHOL mixtures within a specific range of molar rations dramatically improve barrier repair. Furthermore, glycosyl ceramides, sphingomyelin, and triglycerides substitute effectively for ceramides and FA, respectively, but neither phospholipids nor cholesterol esters substitute for FA and CHOL, respectively. These studies show the specific requirements of selected stratum corneum lipid mixtures for optimized barrier repair in murine skin, with further validation in human skin. Utilization of physiologic lipids according to these parameters could lead to new forms of topical therapy for dermatoses (e.g., , atopic dermatitis, and irritant dermatitis) triggered by abnormal barrier function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29807119>Antipsoriatic effect of fatty  enriched fraction of Vernonia anthelmintica Willd. fruits.</a></h2><p>Vernonia anthelmintica has been utilized conventionally as an ingredient in Ayurveda and traditional Uighur medicine for management of various skin ailments, and scientific data's have substantiated its use in treating vitiligo, dermatosis and leucoderma. The present investigation was focused to evaluate the antipsoriatic activity of V. anthelmintica fruit extracts and fractions.Ointment containing dichloromethane (DCM) and methanol (MeOH) extracts at topical dose of 2.5% and 5% (w/w) was evaluated using mouse tail model of . Bioactivity-guided fractionation (F-F) of most active extract was carried out and fractions were again subjected to mouse tail model. Further the activity of bioactive fraction was confirmed in HaCaT (human keratinocyte) cell line using MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)- 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay and its chemical characterization was done via gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS).The dichloromethane extract (5%, w/w) showed statistically significant (* p < 0.05) antipsoriatic activity (66.97 ± 2.68%) with respect to control (25.45 ± 1.80%) and equivalent to that of the standard drug, retino-A 0.05%, (72.47 ± 2.14%) in terms of degree of orthokeratosis, whereas methanol extract (5%, w/w) showed significant (* p < 0.05) differentiation (45.86 ± 2.02%) in comparison to the control group. Out of all fractions, F showed statistically significant (* p < 0.05) antipsoriatic activity (69.27 ± 2.76%) with respect to control and equivalent to that of the standard. F (15.6-1000 µg/ml) showed dose-dependent inhibition of HaCaT cell lines proliferation which suggests keratinocyte modulating activity of V. anthelmintica. Chemical characterization of F revealed that essential fatty acids (i.e., linoleic , , oleic  and stearic ) formed the bulk of bioactive fraction.Ameliorative effect of V. anthelmintica in  might be attributed to the presence of essential fatty acids and thus corroborates its traditional use in the treatment of skin ailments.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we identified both body fat gain in obesity and impaired glucose metabolism as two independent risk factors for increased serum levels of free fatty acids (FFAs). Since obesity is associated with increased and/or delayed resolution of inflammation observed in various chronic inflammatory diseases such as , we investigated the impact of FFAs on human monocyte-derived and mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cell (DCs) functions relevant for the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation. FFAs such as  (PA) and oleic  (OA) did not affect the pro-inflammatory immune response of DCs. In contrast, PA and OA sensitize DCs resulting in augmented secretion of TH1/TH17-instructive cytokines upon pro-inflammatory stimulation. Interestingly, obesity in mice worsened a TH1/TH17-driven -like skin inflammation. Strong correlation of the amount of total FFA, PA, and OA in serum with the severity of skin inflammation points to a critical role of FFA in obesity-mediated exacerbation of skin inflammation. Our data suggest that increased levels of FFAs might be a predisposing factor promoting a TH1/TH17-mediated inflammation such as  in response to an inflammatory danger signal.© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

To test this hypothesis, we analysed the effect of FFA on synovial fibroblasts (SF), human chondrocytes and endothelial cells. We also investigated whether the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which can contribute to driving arthritis, is involved in FFA signalling.Rheumatoid arthritis SF, osteoarthritis SF, psoriatic arthritis SF, human chondrocytes and endothelial cells were stimulated in vitro with different FFA. Immunoassays were used to quantify FFA-induced protein secretion. TLR4 signalling was inhibited extracellularly and intracellularly. Fatty  translocase (CD36), responsible for transporting long-chain FFA into the cell, was also inhibited.In rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASF), FFA dose-dependently enhanced the secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6, the chemokines IL-8 and MCP-1, as well as the matrix-degrading enzymes pro-MMP1 and MMP3. The intensity of the response was mainly dependent on the patient rather than on the type of disease. Both saturated and unsaturated FFA showed similar effects on RASF, while responses to the different FFA varied for human chondrocytes and endothelial cells. Extracellular and intracellular TLR4 inhibition as well as fatty  transport inhibition blocked the -induced IL-6 secretion of RASF.The data show that FFA are not only metabolic substrates but may also directly contribute to articular inflammation and degradation in inflammatory joint diseases. Moreover, the data suggest that, in RASF, FFA exert their effects via TLR4 and require extracellular and intracellular access to the TLR4 receptor complex.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

However, despite their beneficial effects, topical retinoids often cause severe local irritation called retinoid dermatitis. We previously developed a novel vitamin A derivative, retinyl retinoate, which induces less irritation and affords excellent tolerance. In this study, we examined whether co-treatment with topical peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) agonists (e.g. WY14643) reduce retinoid dermatitis in hairless mouse skin.  The effect of concomitant treatment with a PPARα agonist on retinoid dermatitis in hairless mouse epidermis was evaluated by measuring transepidermal water loss, epidermal histology, and cytokine expression.  Retinyl retinoate induced less severe retinoid dermatitis than retinoic . Topical application of a PPARα agonist improved the stratum corneum structure and function, reduced mRNA expression of interleukin (IL)-1α, tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-8, and inhibited ear edema induced by retinoic  or retinyl retinoate.  Our results indicate that PPARα agonists can potentially be used to improve retinoid dermatitis. We suggest that co-treatment with retinyl retinoate and a PPARα agonist may reduce or prevent detrimental alterations in retinoid-treated skin.© 2012 The International Society of Dermatology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25777289>Obesity exacerbates imiquimod-induced -like epidermal hyperplasia and interleukin-17 and interleukin-22 production in mice.</a></h2><p> is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that is accompanied by an imbalance between the proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes. A number of studies have suggested an association between obesity and severe ; however, it remains to be clarified whether obesity exacerbates . To address this unsolved question, we induced psoriasiform dermatitis in mouse models for obesity. We found that obesity exaggerated the severity of psoriasiform dermatitis induced by topical application of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 agonist, imiquimod. Ear swelling and epidermal hyperplasia were more prominent in the obese mice than in the control mice. When compared to imiquimod-treated control mice, imiquimod-treated obese mice expressed higher levels of  mediators, interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and IL-22 in the skin. Food intake restriction partially abrogated enhanced ear swelling and cytokine overproduction in obese mice. Furthermore, the obesity environment and imiquimod treatment synergistically induced an IL-17A downstream molecule, regenerating islet-derived 3γ (Reg3γ), which is a critical molecule for psoriatic epidermal hyperplasia. , one of the fatty acids released by subcutaneous adipocytes, increased the expression of REG3A (a human homologue of mouse Reg3γ) in both the HaCaT keratinocyte cell line and normal human keratinocytes. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that obesity exacerbates psoriasiform dermatitis in mice by upregulating IL-17A, IL-22 and Reg3γ.© 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Histopathological studies showed inhibition in cellular infiltration and reduction of synovial hyperplasia and synovitis, whereas in the second test, histopathological and ultrastructural studies showed that topical application of FAM induced orthokeratosis with the presence of keratohyalin granules in the previously parakeratotic adult mouse tail, and without effects on epidermal thickness. The ED(50) of FAM in this model was 155+/-10 mg. The results of our studies showed that topical application of FAM exerts an important anti-inflammatory activity in both tests without evidence of irritant effects. The anti-inflamatory effects exerted by FAM may be due to its inhibitory effects on arachidonic  metabolism.

However, the mechanisms underlying the association between increased  severity and concomitant metabolic syndrome have not been fully clarified. Herein, we show that imiquimod-induced psoriasiform inflammation was exacerbated and prolonged in diabetic obese mice compared to that in control mice, accompanied by remarkably increased lesional expressions of Cxcl5 and Il-1b. Notably, a large number of CXCL5 Ly6G cells infiltrated the dermis and subcutaneous fat tissue of the diabetic obese mice. Most macrophages in the subcutaneous fat tissues of the diabetic obese mice were positive for expression of IL-1β and GRP78/Bip, an endoplasmic reticulum stress marker. Depletion of Ly6G cells and macrophages diminished the imiquimod-induced psoriasiform inflammation. Further, CXCL5 potentiated the secretion of IL-1β from macrophages and , a fatty  released from subcutaneous adipocytes, further enhanced IL-1β secretion via endoplasmic reticulum stress induction. Combined with the fact that the serum levels of both CXCL5 and  are significantly elevated in patients with metabolic syndrome, our results suggest a role for CXCL5 and endoplasmic reticulum stress in the increase of  severity of patients with concomitant metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.
