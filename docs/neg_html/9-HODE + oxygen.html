<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8378541>Cyclooxygenase activity of cultured human mesothelial cells.</a></h2><p>The fatty acid oxygenase activity of mesothelial cells and its role in inflammatory and neoplastic diseases of the mesothelium have not been defined. Techniques permitting in vitro cultivation of human mesothelial cells shed into serous cavities have permitted analysis of their specific  capacities. The principal products of incubations of cultured human mesothelial cells with polyunsaturated fatty acids were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography on reversed-, straight-, and chiral-phase columns and gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The products included 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (S/R = 3.5), 11-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, and 12-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid from arachidonic acid; 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (molar ratio of 9/13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids = 3.5, S/R ratios = 0.3 and 2.8, respectively) from linoleic acid; and 12-hydroxyheptadecadienoic acid from homo-gamma-linolenic acid. These products are indicative of a cyclooxygenase whose activation in vivo may play a significant role in serosal cavity pathology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8424677>Bis-allylic hydroxylation of polyunsaturated fatty acids by hepatic monooxygenases and its relation to the enzymatic and nonenzymatic formation of conjugated hydroxy fatty acids.</a></h2><p>[14C]Linoleic acid was incubated with phenobarbital-induced rat liver microsomes and formation of cis-trans-conjugated hydroxy fatty acids was investigated. 13-Hydroxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid (13-HODE), 9-hydroxy-10E,12Z-octadecadienoic acid (), and three novel metabolites were identified, viz. 11-hydroxy-9Z,12Z-octadecadienoic acid (11-HODE), 8-HODE, and 14-HODE. 11-HODE (59% R), the main product, was unstable and converted to 9(R, S)-HODE and 13(R, S)-HODE in acidic media. All metabolites contained oxygen from O2. Experiments under oxygen-18 gas showed that 13-HODE and  contained equal or less amounts of oxygen-18 than the other metabolites. In the former case,  and 13-HODE were formed with stereo-selectivity (80-82% R). [11S-2H]Linoleic acid was metabolized to 13R-HODE with loss of deuterium (24% 2H) and to 9R-HODE with deuterium retention (95% 2H), while [11R-2H]linoleic acid was metabolized to 13R-HODE that largely retained the label (71% 2H) and to 9R-HODE that lost most of the label (22% 2H). These data indicated that P450 catalyzed abstraction of the pro-R hydrogen at C11, double bond migration and suprafacial oxygen insertion at C9 to give 9R-HODE, while abstraction of the pro-S hydrogen at C11, followed by double bond migration and oxygen insertion, yielded 13R-HODE. Hepatic microsomes of the cynomolgus monkey metabolized 18:2n-6 as above and 20:4n-6 to 13-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, likely formed in analogy with 11-HODE. In summary, one mechanism in the biosynthesis of cis-trans-conjugated hydroxy fatty acids by P450 involves suprafacial hydrogen abstraction and oxygen insertion. In addition, hydrolysis of the unstable bis-allylic hydroxy metabolites may contribute to the formation of conjugated hydroxy fatty acids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12654483>Activation of NAD(P)H oxidase by lipid hydroperoxides: mechanism of oxidant-mediated smooth muscle cytotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Oxidized lipids, such as 13-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HPODE), have been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. 13-HPODE, a constituent of oxidized low-density lipoproteins, can induce cytotoxicity of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC), which may facilitate plaque destabilization and/or rupture. 13-HPODE-induced cytotoxicity has been linked to oxidative stress, although the mechanisms by which this occurs are unknown. In the present study, we show that 13-HPODE and 9-HPODE (10-30 microM) increased superoxide (O2*-) production and induced cytotoxicity in SMC. The 13-HPODE-induced increase in O2*- was blocked by transfecting the cells with antisense oligonucleotides against p22phox, suggesting that the O2*- was produced by NAD(P)H oxidase. Similar concentrations of the corresponding HPODE reduction products, 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE) and , neither increased O2*- production nor induced cytotoxicity, while 4-hydroxy nonenal (4-HNE), an unsaturated aldehyde lipid peroxidation product, induced cytotoxicity without increasing O2*- production. Treatment with superoxide dismutase or Tiron to scavenge O2*-, or transfection with p22phox antisense oligonucleotides to inhibit O2*- production, attenuated 13-HPODE-induced cytotoxicity, but not that induced by 4-HNE. These findings suggest that activation of NAD(P)H oxidase, and production of O2*-, play an important role in lipid hydroperoxide-induced smooth muscle cytotoxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27018002>9- and 13-Hydroxy-octadecadienoic acids (9+13 HODE) are inversely related to granulocyte colony stimulating factor and IL-6 in runners after 2h running.</a></h2><p>This study utilized a pro-inflammatory exercise mode to explore potential linkages between increases in 9- and 13-hydroxy-octadecadienoic acid (9+13 HODE) and biomarkers for inflammation, oxidative stress, and muscle damage. Male (N=10) and female (N=10) runners ran at ∼70% VO2max for 1.5h followed by 30min of downhill running (-10%). Blood samples were taken pre-run and immediately-, 1-h-, and 24-h post-run, and analyzed for 9+13 HODE, F2-isoprostanes, six cytokines, C-reactive protein (CRP), creatine kinase (CK), and myoglobin (MYO). Gender groups performed at comparable relative heart rate and oxygen consumption levels during the 2-h run. All outcome measures increased post-run (time effects, P⩽0.001), with levels near pre-run levels by 24h except for CRP, CK, MYO, and delayed onset of muscle soreness (DOMS). Plasma 9+13 HODE increased 314±38.4% post-run (P<0.001), 77.3±15.8% 1-h post-run (P<0.001), and 40.6±16.4% 24-h post-exercise (P=0.024), and F2-isoprostanes increased 50.8±8.9% post-run (P<0.001) and 19.0±5.3% 1-h post-run (P=0.006). Post-run increases were comparable between genders for all outcomes except for 9+13 HODE (interaction effect, P=0.024, post-run tending higher in females), IL-10 (P=0.006, females lower), and DOMS (P=0.029, females lower). The pre-to-post-run increase in 9+13 HODEs was not related to other outcomes except for plasma granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) (r=-0.710, P<0.001) and IL-6 (r=-0.457, P=0.043). Within the context of this study, exercise-induced increases in 9+13 HODEs tended higher in females, and were not related to increases in F2-isoprostanes, muscle damage, or soreness. The negative relationships to GCSF and IL-6 suggest a linkage between 9+13 HODES and exercise-induced neutrophil chemotaxis, degranulation, and inflammation.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The generation of lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence by stimulated and non-stimulated PM was inhibited concentration-dependently. Inhibition was observed at concentrations as low as 10 nM. Since 9-OH-Lin and 9-OOH-Lin also inhibited the generation of chemiluminescence by a cell-free enzyme system, i.e. xanthine/xanthine oxidase, the inhibitory effects might represent a scavenging activity towards reactive oxygen species. 9-OH-Lin and 9-OOH-Lin did not influence other phagocytic cell functions, e.g. PM phagocytic capacity, the aggregatory response to the calcium ionophore A23187, or the release of lysosomal enzymes. The effects of 9-OH-Lin and 9-OOH-Lin could be ascribed to the hydroxy and hydroxyperoxy moiety, respectively, as evidenced by lack of effect of the native fatty acid linoleic acid. We conclude that the formation of 9-OH-Lin and 9-OOH-Lin by PM may represent a regulatory mechanism towards the cell's own activity by modulating reactive oxygen species.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6414520> of linoleic acid by prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase from adult and fetal blood vessels.</a></h2><p>Linoleic acid (18:2) is converted by prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase in particulate fractions and homogenates of fetal calf aorta to its 9- and 13-hydroperoxy metabolites. These intermediates are then either dehydrated to the corresponding oxo compounds or reduced to monohydroxy products. Alternatively, the hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acids can be converted to epoxyhydroxyoctadecenoic acids, which are hydrolyzed to trihydroxy metabolites by epoxide hydrolases present in both particulate and cytosolic fractions from aorta. Linoleic acid (Km, 442 microM) is a much poorer substrate for prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase than is arachidonic acid (20:4) (Km, 48 microM). However, the oxygenation of 18:2 by particulate fractions from aorta is linear with time for at least 5 min, whereas the oxygenation of 20:4 is linear for only 15 s. Arachidonic acid strongly inhibits the conversion of 18:2 to monohydroxy (ID50, 10 microM) and trihydroxy (ID50, 140 microM) products. Linoleic acid has a similar, but much weaker effect on the formation of 6-oxoprostaglandin F1 alpha from 20:4. Substantial amounts of both the monohydroxy (9-hydroxy-10, 12-octadecadienoic acid and 13-hydroxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid) and trihydroxy (9,10,11-trihydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid, 9,10,13-trihydroxy-11-octadecenoic acid and 9,12,13-trihydroxy-10-octadecenoic acid) metabolites of 18:2 were shown by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to be formed from endogenous substrate during incubation of slices of fetal calf aorta in physiological medium. This raises the possibility that some of these products or their hydroperoxy precursors may have some biological significance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8001259>Phospholipid peroxidation in tumor promoter-exposed mouse skin.</a></h2><p>We have investigated lipid peroxidation in the skin of CD1 mice following single or repeated topical applications of the tumor promoter, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). A substantial accumulation of hydroxyphospholipids, to levels 3-5 times control values, followed exposure to two or more TPA treatments (24-72 h intervals), whereas single applications were ineffective. Sodium borohydride reduction increased the yield of product by approximately 50%, suggesting the additional presence of phospholipid hydroperoxides in the oxidized lipids. Straight phase HPLC analysis of the constituent hydroxy fatty acids, followed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, revealed that oxidized derivatives of linoleic acid, including 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (9- and 13-HODE), were the primary products. Stereochemical analysis showed ratios of S to R stereoisomers of 1.3 for 13-HODE and 1.27 for , which implied that TPA-induced peroxidation was primarily due to free radical oxidation, although a partial contribution of enzyme (lipoxygenase) activity is possible. The TPA-induced peroxidation was greater in the epidermis than in the dermis. Pre-exposure of mouse skin to the anti-inflammatory agent fluocinolone acetonide, antioxidants and enzyme (phospholipase A2 and lipoxygenase) inhibitors lowered the peroxidation response to subsequent exposure to TPA. Phospholipid peroxidation products may be useful markers of oxygen radical production in TPA-exposed mouse skin with possible relevance to tumor promotion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10988277>Troglitazone reduces reactive  species generation by leukocytes and lipid peroxidation and improves flow-mediated vasodilatation in obese subjects.</a></h2><p>Because troglitazone has been shown to have antioxidant properties, we investigated whether troglitazone administration to obese subjects causes a reduction in (1) reactive  species (ROS) generation by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) and mononuclear cells (MNCs) and (2) lipid peroxidation as reflected in the plasma concentrations of 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid () and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE). Seven obese subjects were given 400 mg/d troglitazone for 4 weeks. Blood samples were obtained before troglitazone administration and at weekly intervals thereafter. Insulin concentrations fell significantly at week 1 and remained low at weeks 2 and 4 (P:<0.001). ROS generation by PMNLs fell to 77.6+/-25.1% of the basal at week 1 and 47.9+/-41.1% at week 4 (P:<0.001). ROS generation by MNCs fell to 59.8+/-15.7% of the basal at week 1 and 35.1+/-17.6% at week 4 (P:<0.001).  and 13-HODE concentrations fell significantly from 787.4+/-52.4 and 713. 1+/-44.7 pg/mL to 720.4+/-66.7 (P:<0.004) and 675.2+/-65.0 pg/mL (P:<0.01) after 4 weeks, respectively. Postischemic dilatation of the brachial artery was measured by ultrasonography. The mean percent dilatation after forearm ischemia before and after troglitazone was 5.5+/-3.01% and 8.75+/-3.37% (P:<0.02), respectively. The percent increase in diameter after nitroglycerin was 17.08+/-1.18% before troglitazone, whereas it was 18.9+/-1.91% (P:<0.02) after troglitazone. We conclude that troglitazone has a potent and rapid biological inhibitory effect on ROS generation by PMNLs and MNCs and that it inhibits lipid peroxidation significantly. These changes are associated with a significant improvement in postischemic flow-mediated vasodilation in the brachial artery over a relatively short period of 4 weeks.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15522817>The novel pathway for ketodiene oxylipin biosynthesis in Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus) tubers.</a></h2><p>The new route of the plant lipoxygenase pathway, directed specifically towards the ketodiene formation, was detected during in vitro experiments with Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus) tubers. Through this pathway (9Z,11E,13S)-13-hydroperoxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid (13-HPOD) is reduced to corresponding 13-hydroxy acid (13-HOD), which is in turn dehydrogenated into ketodiene (9Z,11E,13S)-13-oxo-9,11-octadecadienoic acid (13-KOD). Dehydrogenation of 13-HOD into 13-KOD was not dependent on the presence of either NAD or NADP, but was strongly dependent on the presence of . Under anoxic conditions, 13-HOD dehydrogenation was blocked, but addition of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol restored it. Sulfite addition fully suppressed the aerobic dehydrogenation of 13-HOD. Hydrogen peroxide is a by-product formed by the enzyme along with 13-KOD. These data suggest that the ketodiene biosynthesis in H. tuberosus tubers is catalyzed by flavin dehydrogenase. (9S,10E,12Z)- (9-HOD) is dehydrogenated by this enzyme as effectively as 13-HOD, while alpha-ketol, (9Z)-12-oxo-13-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid, and ricinoleic acid did not act as substrates for dehydrogenase. The enzyme was soluble and possessed a pH optimum at pH 7.0-9.0. The only 13-HOD dehydrogenase known so far was detected in rat colon. However, unlike the H. tuberosus enzyme, the rat dehydrogenase is NAD-dependent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9707212>Normoxic ventilation after cardiac arrest reduces oxidation of brain lipids and improves neurological outcome.</a></h2><p>Increasing evidence that oxidative stress contributes to delayed neuronal death after global cerebral ischemia has led to reconsideration of the prolonged use of 100% ventilatory O2 following resuscitation from cardiac arrest. This study determined the temporal course of oxidation of brain fatty acyl groups in a clinically relevant canine model of cardiac arrest and resuscitation and tested the hypothesis that postischemic ventilation with 21% inspired O2, rather than 100% O2, results in reduced levels of oxidized brain lipids and decreased neurological impairment.Neurological deficit scoring and high performance liquid chromatography measurement of fatty acyl lipid oxidation were used in an established canine model using 10 minutes of cardiac arrest followed by resuscitation with different ventilatory oxygenation protocols and restoration of spontaneous circulation for 30 minutes to 24 hours.Significant increases in frontal cortex lipid oxidation occurred after 10 minutes of cardiac arrest alone with no reperfusion and after reperfusion for 30 minutes, 2 hours, and 24 hours (relative total 235-nm absorbing peak areas=7.1+/-0.7 SE, 17.3+/-2.7, 14.2+/-3.2, 16.1+/-1.0, and 14.0+/-0.8, respectively; n=4, P<0.05). The predominant oxidized lipids were identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry as 13- and 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (13- and ). Animals ventilated on 21% to 30% O2 versus 100% O2 for the first hour after resuscitation exhibited significantly lower levels of total and specific oxidized lipids in the frontal cortex (1.7+/-0.1 versus 3.12+/-0.78 microg 13-HODE/g wet wt cortex., n=4 to 6, P<0.05) and lower neurological deficit scores (45.1+/-3.6 versus 58.3+/-3.8, n=9, P<0.05).With a clinically relevant canine model of 10 minutes of cardiac arrest, resuscitation with 21% versus 100% inspired O2 resulted in lower levels of oxidized brain lipids and improved neurological outcome measured after 24 hours of reperfusion. This study casts further doubt on the appropriateness of present guidelines that recommend the indiscriminate use of 100% ventilatory O2 for undefined periods during and after resuscitation from cardiac arrest.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18812596>Triglyceride-rich lipoprotein lipolysis releases neutral and oxidized FFAs that induce endothelial cell inflammation.</a></h2><p>Triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TGRL) lipolysis products provide a pro-inflammatory stimulus that can alter endothelial barrier function. To probe the mechanism of this lipolysis-induced event, we evaluated the pro-inflammatory potential of lipid classes derived from human postprandial TGRL by lipoprotein lipase (LpL). Incubation of TGRL with LpL for 30 min increased the saturated and unsaturated FFA content of the incubation solutions significantly. Furthermore, concentrations of the hydroxylated linoleates 9-hydroxy ocatadecadienoic acid () and 13-HODE were elevated by LpL lipolysis, more than other measured oxylipids. The FFA fractions elicited pro-inflammatory responses inducing TNFalpha and intracellular adhesion molecule expression and reactive  species (ROS) production in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). The FFA-mediated increase in ROS was blocked by both the cytochrome P450 2C9 inhibitor sulfaphenazole and NADPH oxidase inhibitors. Compared with linoleate, 13-HODE was found to be a more potent inducer of ROS production in HAECs, an activity that was insensitive to both NADPH oxidase and cytochrome P450 inhibitors. Therefore, although the oxidative metabolism of FFA in endothelial cells can produce inflammatory responses, TGRL lipolysis can also release preformed mediators of oxidative stress (e.g., HODEs) that may influence endothelial cell function in vivo by stimulating intracellular ROS production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3988758>Conversion of linoleic acid hydroperoxide to hydroxy, keto, epoxyhydroxy, and trihydroxy fatty acids by hematin.</a></h2><p>We have carried out a study of the reaction of 13-hydroperoxy-9-cis,11-trans-octadecadienoic acid (linoleic acid hydroperoxide) with hematin. The major products are erythro-11-hydroxy-12,13-epoxy-9-octadecenoic acid, threo-11-hydroxy-12,13-epoxy-9-octadecenoic acid, 9,12,13-trihydroxy-10-octadecenoic acid, 13-keto-9,11-octadecadienoic acid, and 13-hydroxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid. Several minor products have also been identified, including 9-hydroxy-12,13-epoxyoctadecenoic acid, 11-hydroxy-9,10-epoxy-12-octadecenoic acid, , and 9-keto-10,12-octadecadienoic acid. Oxygen labeling studies indicate that the observed products arise by at least two . In the major pathway, hematin reduces 13-hydroperoxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid by one electron to an alkoxyl radical that cyclizes to an adjacent double bond to form an epoxy allylic radical. The allylic radical either couples to the hydroxyl radical coordinated to hematin or diffuses from the solvent cage and couples to O2, forming a peroxyl radical. In the minor pathway, the hydroperoxide is oxidized by one electron to a 13-peroxyl radical that undergoes beta-scission to a pentadienyl radical and O2. Exchange of hydroperoxide-derived O2 for dissolved O2 occurs at this stage followed by coupling of O2 to either terminus of the pentadienyl radical. Both  of hydroperoxide  generate significant quantities of peroxyl radicals that epoxidize the isolated double bonds of dihydroaromatic molecules. The products of hydroperoxide reaction with hematin and the oxygen labeling patterns are very similar to the products of unsaturated fatty acid hydroperoxide  by platelets, aorta, and lung. Our results not only provide a mechanism for the formation of a series of mammalian metabolites of linoleic and arachidonic acids but also offer an estimate of the yield of peroxyl radicals generated during the process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17164225>Inducible expression of 15-lipoxygenase-2 and 8-lipoxygenase inhibits cell growth via common signaling pathways.</a></h2><p>Human 15-lipoxygenase (LOX)-2 and mouse 8-LOX represent orthologous members of the LOX family but display different positional specificities and tissue distribution. To study the functional role of 15-LOX-2 and 8-LOX in keratinocytes, an inducible Tet-On gene expression system was established in the premalignant mouse keratinocyte cell line 308. Doxycycline (dox)-induced expression of enzymatically active 15-LOX-2 and 8-LOX led to an inhibition of cell growth that was associated with an inhibition of DNA synthesis, as shown by a 15-46% reduction of 5-bromo-2-deoxy-uridine (BrdU) incorporation. The inhibitory effects were increased in the presence of exogenous arachidonic acid. In contrast, addition of linoleic acid or the LOX inhibitor baicalein reversed the growth-inhibitory effects. Treatment of the cells with 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) or 8-HETE resulted in a similar inhibition of BrdU incorporation, whereas 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE) and , in contrast, had no effects. Dox-induced keratinocytes showed increased levels of reactive  species (ROS). The antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine and a specific inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, but not of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 or c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated kinases, completely abolished the LOX-induced growth inhibition, indicating a critical role of ROS and p38. Our data suggest that 15-LOX-2 and 8-LOX, although displaying different positional specificity, may use common signaling pathways to induce growth inhibition in premalignant epithelial cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27041118>7-Ketocholesterol is increased in the plasma of X-ALD patients and induces peroxisomal modifications in microglial cells: Potential roles of 7-ketocholesterol in the pathophysiology of X-ALD.</a></h2><p>X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a genetic disorder induced by a mutation in the ABCD1 gene, which causes the accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids in tissue and plasma. Oxidative stress may be a hallmark of X-ALD. In the plasma of X-ALD patients with different forms of the disease, characterized by high levels of C24:0 and C26:0, we observed the presence of oxidative stress revealed by decreased levels of GSH, α-tocopherol, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). We showed that oxidative stress caused the oxidation of cholesterol and linoleic acid, leading to the formation of cholesterol oxide derivatives oxidized at C7 (7-ketocholesterol (7KC), 7β-hydroxycholesterol (7β-OHC), and 7α-hydroxycholesrol (7α-OHC)) and of 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (, 13-HODE), respectively. High levels of 7KC, 7β-OHC, 7α-OHC,  and 13-HODE were found. As 7KC induces oxidative stress, inflammation and cell death, which could play key roles in the development of X-ALD, the impact of 7KC on the peroxisomal status was determined in microglial BV-2 cells. Indeed, environmental stress factors such as 7KC could exacerbate peroxisomal dysfunctions in microglial cells and thus determine the progression of the disease. 7KC induces oxiapoptophagy in BV-2 cells: overproduction of HO and O, presence of cleaved caspase-3 and PARP, nuclear condensation and/or fragmentation; elevated [LC3-II/LC3-I] ratio, increased p62 levels. 7KC also induces several peroxisomal modifications: decreased Abcd1, Abcd2, Abcd3, Acox1 and/or Mfp2 mRNA and protein levels, increased catalase activity and decreased Acox1-activity. However, the Pex14 level was unchanged. It is suggested that high levels of 7KC in X-ALD patients could foster generalized peroxisomal dysfunction in microglial cells, which could in turn intensify brain damage.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

MDSCs from LAL-deficient (lal-/-) mice directly stimulate cancer cell proliferation. PPARγ ligand treatment inhibited lal-/- MDSCs stimulation of tumor cell growth and metastasis in vivo, and tumor cell proliferation and migration in vitro. In addition, PPARγ ligand treatment impaired lal-/- MDSCs transendothelial migration, and differentiation from lineage-negative cells. The corrective effects of PPARγ ligand on lal-/- MDSCs functions were mediated by regulating the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, and subsequently blocking MDSCs ROS overproduction. Furthermore, in the myeloid-specific dominant-negative PPARγ (dnPPARγ) overexpression bitransgenic mouse model, tumor growth and metastasis were enhanced, and MDSCs from these mice stimulated tumor cell proliferation and migration. MDSCs with dnPPARγ overexpression showed increased transendothelial migration, overactivation of the mTOR pathway, and ROS overproduction. These results indicate that PPARγ plays a critical role in neutral  metabolic signaling controlled by LAL, which provides a mechanistic basis for clinically targeting MDSCs to reduce the risk of cancer proliferation, growth and metastasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11232024>The suppressive effect of dietary restriction and weight loss in the obese on the generation of reactive  species by leukocytes, lipid peroxidation, and protein carbonylation.</a></h2><p>Increased reactive  species generation by the leukocytes of the obese may be responsible for increased oxidative injury to lipids and proteins and, hence, atherosclerosis. We have investigated whether reactive  species generation by leukocytes and other indexes of oxidative damage in the body fall with short-term dietary restriction and weight loss. Nine nondiabetic obese subjects (body mass index, 32.5-64.4 kg/m(2)), not taking any antioxidants, were put on a 1000-Cal diet. Fasting blood samples were taken at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks and at 12 weeks after the cessation of dietary restriction. Blood samples were also obtained at 1 and 2 h after administration of 75 g oral glucose at 0 and 4 weeks. Mononuclear cells (MNC) and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) were isolated, and reactive  species generation was measured. Plasma concentrations of thiobarbituric acid-reactive species (TBARS), 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE), 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (), carbonylated proteins, o-tyrosine, and m-tyrosine as indexes of oxidative damage to lipids, proteins and amino acids, respectively, were measured. Antioxidant vitamins were measured as indexes of antioxidant reserves. Plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentrations were also measured. Mean weight loss was 2.4 +/- 0.6 kg at week 1, 2.5 +/- 1.7 kg at week 2, 3.9 +/- 0.8 kg at week 3, and 4.5 +/- 2.8 kg at week 4 (P < 0.05). Reactive  species generation by PMN fell from 236.4 +/- 95.8 to 150.9 +/- 69.0, 125.9 +/- 24.3, 96.0 +/- 39.9, and 103.1 +/- 35.7 mV at weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively (P < 0.001). It increased 3 months after the cessation of dietary restriction to 270.0 +/- 274.3 mV. Reactive  species generation by MNC fell from 187.8 +/- 75.0 to 101.7 +/- 64.5, 86.9 +/- 42.8, 63.8 +/- 14.3, and 75.1 +/- 32.2 mV and increased thereafter to 302.0 +/- 175.5 mV at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 16 weeks, respectively (P < 0.005). Reactive  species generation by PMN and MNC increased in response to glucose; the relative increase was greater at 4 weeks than that at week 0 due to a fall in the basal levels of reactive  species generation. Consistent with the fall in reactive  species generation, there was a reduction in plasma TBARS from 1.68 +/- 0.17 micromol/L at week 0 to 1.47 micromol/L at 4 weeks (P < 0.05). The 13-HODE to linoleic acid ratio fell from a baseline of 100% to 56.4 +/- 36.1% at 4 weeks (P < 0.05), and the  to linoleic acid ratio fell from a baseline of 100% to 60.5 +/- 37.7% at 4 weeks (P < 0.05). Carbonylated proteins fell from 1.39 +/- 0.27 microgram/mg protein at week 0 to 1.17 +/- 0.12 microgram/mg protein at week 4 (P < 0.05); o-tyrosine fell from 0.42 +/- 0.03 mmol/mol phenylalanine at week 0 to 0.36 +/- 0.02 mmol/mol phenylalanine at 4 weeks (P < 0.005), and m-tyrosine fell from 0.45 +/- 0.04 mmol/mol phenylalanine at week 0 to 0.40 +/- 0.03 mmol/mol phenylalanine at 4 weeks (P < 0.05). The basal concentrations of TBARS, , 13-HODE, carbonylated proteins, o-tyrosine, and m-tyrosine in the obese were significantly greater than those in normal subjects. On the other hand, tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentrations did not change during this 4-week period, nor was there any change in antioxidant vitamins. This is the first demonstration of 1) an increase in reactive  species-induced damage in lipids, proteins, and amino acids in the obese compared with normal subjects; and 2) a decrease in reactive  species generation by leukocytes and oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and amino acids after dietary restriction and weight loss in the obese over a short period.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25381799>Switching from singlet-oxygen-mediated oxidation to free-radical-mediated oxidation in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes in model mouse.</a></h2><p>Oxidative stress plays a key role in the development of type 2 diabetes. However, it is still unknown what kind of oxidative stress underlies the development of type 2 diabetes. We investigated hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE) isomers, which have been proposed as a biomarker for evaluating oxidative stress in vivo, during the development of diabetes in Tsumura Suzuki Obese Diabetes (TSOD) mouse, a type 2 diabetes model. It was revealed that glucose tolerance and insulin resistance index HOMA-IR in TSOD mice at 5 weeks of age were approximately normal, namely, the mice were in the prediabetic state, but these levels were significantly exacerbated from 8 weeks of age compared with those in Tsumura Suzuki Non Obesity (TSNO) mice (control). Concomitantly, the plasma levels of free-radical-mediated oxidation products, 9- and 13-(E,E)-HODE and 7β-hydroxycholesterol, in TSOD mice were significantly higher than those in TSNO mice at 8, and 8 and 11 weeks of age, respectively. Interestingly, the plasma levels of 10- and 12-(Z,E)-HODE, which are produced specifically by singlet-oxygen-mediated oxidation, in TSOD mice were higher than those in TSNO mice only at 5 weeks of age, and not at 8, 11, and 13 weeks of age. We demonstrated that singlet-oxygen-mediated oxidation occurred in TSOD mice before development of the diabetic phenotypes, including impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. These results suggest that excessive singlet-oxygen-mediated oxidation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10320803>Formation of 9-hydroxy linoleic acid as a product of phospholipid peroxidation in diabetic erythrocyte membranes.</a></h2><p>The increased production of -derived free radicals (OFR) and lipid peroxidation may contribute to vascular complications in diabetes. Some lipid peroxidation products have already been reported to be formed via glucose-induced oxidative stress. We have identified 9-hydroxy linoleic acid (9-OH-C18:2) in the red cell membrane phospholipid of diabetic subjects. We hypothesized that 9-OH-C18:2 would be formed in hydroxyl radical reactions to linoleic acid (C18:2) during glucose-induced oxidative stress, and confirmed that the formation of 9-OH-C18:2 was induced by ultraviolet (UV)-C irradiation to the synthetic C18:2. UV-C light generates highly reactive hydroxy radicals. C18:2 is confirmed to be the precursor of 9-OH-C18:2. To estimate the degree of oxidative damage to red cell membrane phospholipids, we developed a selective ion monitoring gas chromatography-mass spectrometric measurement for C18:2 and 9-OH-C18:2, following methanolysis of red cell membrane phospholipids. The relative peak height ratio of C18:2 to 9-OH-C18:2 (9-OH-C18:2/C18:2) was measured in phospholipid extracts of red cell membranes from healthy (n=29, 3.1+/-1.9%) and diabetic (n=27, 20. 9+/-16.1%) subjects. It was confirmed that 9-OH-C18:2/C18:2 is significantly (P<0.001) elevated in patients with diabetes. The measurement of 9-OH-C18:2/C18:2 in red cell membranes should be useful for assessing oxidative damage to membrane phospholipids in diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31340670>Diesel Exhaust Induces Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Hyperlipidemia, and Liver Steatosis.</a></h2><p>Air pollution is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, as well as dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome. Our goal was to dissect the mechanisms involved. Approach and Results: We assessed the effects of exposure to air pollution on  in mice through assessment of plasma lipids and lipoproteins, oxidized fatty acids  (9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic) and 13-HODE (13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic), , and carbohydrate . Findings were corroborated, and mechanisms were further assessed in HepG2 hepatocytes in culture. ApoE knockout mice exposed to inhaled diesel exhaust (DE, 6 h/d, 5 days/wk for 16 weeks) exhibited elevated plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels, increased hepatic triglyceride content, and higher hepatic levels of  and 13-HODE, as compared to control mice exposed to filtered air. A direct effect of DE exposure on hepatocytes was demonstrated by treatment of HepG2 cells with a methanol extract of DE particles followed by loading with oleic acid. As observed in vivo, this led to increased triglyceride content and significant downregulation of ACAD9 mRNA expression. Treatment of HepG2 cells with DE particles and oleic acid did not alter de novo lipogenesis but inhibited total, mitochondrial, and ATP-linked oxygen consumption rate, indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction. Treatment of isolated mitochondria, prepared from mouse liver, with DE particles and oleic acid also inhibited mitochondrial complex activity and β-oxidation.DE exposure leads to dyslipidemia and liver steatosis in ApoE knockout mice, likely due to mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased  catabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11443197>Nuclear factor-kappaB suppressive and inhibitor-kappaB stimulatory effects of troglitazone in obese patients with type 2 diabetes: evidence of an antiinflammatory action?</a></h2><p>It has been shown recently that troglitazone exerts an anti-inflammatory effect, in vitro, and in experimental animals. To test these properties in humans, we investigated the effect of troglitazone on the proinflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB and its inhibitory protein IkappaB in mononuclear cells (MNC) and plasma soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and C-reactive protein. We also examined the effect of troglitazone on reactive  species generation, p47(phox) subunit expression, 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (), 13-HODE, o-tyrosine, and m-tyrosine in obese patients with type 2 diabetes. Seven obese patients with type 2 diabetes were treated with troglitazone (400 mg/day) for 4 weeks. Blood samples were obtained at weekly intervals. Nuclear factor-kappaB binding activity in MNC nuclear extracts was significantly inhibited after troglitazone treatment at week 1 and continued to be inhibited up to week 4. On the other hand, IkappaB protein levels increased significantly after troglitazone treatment at week 1, and this increase persisted throughout the study. Plasma monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 concentrations did not decrease significantly after troglitazone treatment, although there was a trend toward inhibition. Reactive  species generation by polymorphonuclear cells and MNC, p47(phox) subunit protein quantities, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and C-reactive protein levels decreased significantly after troglitazone intake. 13-HODE/linoleic acid and /linoleic acid ratios also decreased after troglitazone intake. However, o-tyrosine/phenylalanine and m-tyrosine/phenylalanine ratios did not change significantly. These data show that troglitazone has profound antiinflammatory effects in addition to antioxidant effects in obese type 2 diabetics; these effects may be relevant to the recently described beneficial antiatherosclerotic effects of troglitazone at the vascular level.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11884452>Dualism of oxidized lipoproteins in provoking and attenuating the oxidative burst in macrophages: role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma.</a></h2><p>Activation and deactivation of macrophages are of considerable importance during the development of various disease states, atherosclerosis among others. Macrophage activation is achieved by oxidized lipoproteins (oxLDL) and is determined by  radical (ROS) formation. The oxidative burst was measured by flow cytometry and quantitated by oxidation of the redox-sensitive dye dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate. Short-time stimulation dose-dependently elicited ROS formation. Diphenylene iodonium prevented ROS formation, thus pointing to the involvement of a NAD(P)H oxidase in producing reduced  species. In contrast, preincubation of macrophages with oxLDL for 16 h showed an attenuated oxidative burst upon a second contact with oxLDL. Taking into account that oxLDL is an established peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) agonist and considering the anti-inflammatory properties of PPARgamma, we went on and showed that a PPARgamma agonist such as ciglitazone attenuated ROS formation. Along that line, major lipid peroxidation products of oxLDL, such as 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, shared that performance. Supporting evidence that PPARgamma activation accounted for reduced ROS generation came from studies in which proliferator-activated receptor response element decoy oligonucleotides, but not a mutated oligonucleotide, supplied in front of oxLDL delivery regained a complete oxidative burst upon cell activation. We conclude that oxLDL not only elicits an oxidative burst upon first contact, but also promotes desensitization of macrophages via activation of PPARgamma. Desensitization of macrophages may have important consequences for the behavior of macrophages/foam cells in atherosclerotic lesions.</p></html>
