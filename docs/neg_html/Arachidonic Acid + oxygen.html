It was, therefore, necessary to examine whether the inhibition of CYP1B1 and hence inhibiting the formation of its metabolites, using 2,4,3',5'-tetramethoxystilbene (TMS), would have a cardioprotective effect against angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced cardiac hypertrophy. For this purpose, male Sprague Dawley rats were treated with Ang II with or without TMS (300 μg/kg every third day i.p.). Thereafter, cardiac hypertrophy and the formation of mid-chain HETEs and  were assessed. In vitro, RL-14 cells were treated with Ang II (10 μM) in the presence and absence of TMS (0.5 μM). Then, reactive  species, mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation levels, and nuclear factor-kappa B-binding activity were determined. Our results demonstrated that TMS protects against Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy as indicated by the improvement in cardiac functions shown by the echocardiography as well as by reversing the increase in heart weight to tibial length ratio caused by Ang II. In addition, the cardioprotective effect of TMS was associated with a significant decrease in cardiac mid-chain HETEs levels. Mechanistically, TMS inhibited reactive  species formation, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and the binding of p65 NF-κB.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28954384>Ethyl acetate fraction of Terminalia bellirica (Gaertn.) Roxb. fruits inhibits proinflammatory mediators via down regulating nuclear factor-κB in LPS stimulated Raw 264.7 cells.</a></h2><p>Inflammation has been considered as a major risk factor for various kinds of human diseases. Macrophages play substantial roles in host defense against infection. It can be activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. The current study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of ethyl acetate fraction isolated from T. bellerica (EFTB) in LPS stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophage cell lines. The inhibitory effects of EFTB on total cyclooxygenase (COX), 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) activity, nitrate and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) level, reactive  species (ROS) production were studied. The gene level expression of COX-2, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) were also studied in LPS stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. EFTB (100μg/mL) inhibited all inflammatory markers in dose dependent manner. Moreover, EFTB down regulated the mRNA expression of TNF-α, IL-6, COX-2 and NF-κB against LPS stimulation. Our results demonstrated that EFTB is able to attenuate inflammatory response possibly via suppression of ROS and NO species, inhibiting the production of  metabolites, proinflammatory mediators and cytokines release.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Fecal microbiota from mice housed in a control environment representing 2,200 meters (NC group) above sea level with 16%  and mice that were placed in a hypobaric chamber representing 5000 meters (HC group) above sea level with 11%  for 30 days, were analyzed by the HiSeq Illumina sequencing platform. The results showed a significant difference in beta diversity observed between the two groups, while no significant difference was observed in alpha diversity. Compared with the NC group, the relative abundance of class Epsilonproteobacteria, phlym Actinobacteria, class Erysipelotrichia and genus Helicobacter were significantly lower (P<0.05), while the relative abundance of genus Alistipes was increased in the HC group; Phenotypic analysis showed no significant difference in aerobic, anaerobic, facultatively anaerobic, potentially pathogenic, stress tolerant, mobile element, biofilms formation, gram negative and gram positive between HC group and NC group; Functional analysis results showed significant differences in 34 gene functional metabolic pathways (carbohydrate digestion and absorption, energy metabolism,  metabolism, flavonoid biosynthesis, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, etc) between HC group and NC group. Together, these findings suggest that exposure to high altitude and low  had the potential to change the intestinal microbial communities, which potentially may modulate metabolic processes in mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27396332>Systematic Analysis Reveals that Cancer Mutations Converge on Deregulated Metabolism of Arachidonate and Xenobiotics.</a></h2><p>Mutations are the basis of the clonal evolution of most cancers. Nevertheless, a systematic analysis of whether mutations are selected in cancer because they lead to the deregulation of specific biological processes independent of the type of cancer is still lacking. In this study, we correlated the genome and transcriptome of 1,082 tumors. We found that nine commonly mutated genes correlated with substantial changes in gene expression, which primarily converged on metabolism. Further network analyses circumscribed the convergence to a network of reactions, termed AraX, that involves the glutathione- and -mediated metabolism of  and xenobiotics. In an independent cohort of 4,462 samples, all nine mutated genes were consistently correlated with the deregulation of AraX. Among all of the metabolic pathways, AraX deregulation represented the strongest predictor of patient survival. These findings suggest that oncogenic mutations drive a selection process that converges on the deregulation of the AraX network.Copyright © 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

The present study addressed the anti-inflammatory activity of O. dillenii derived methanol extract, fractions and pure compounds and their underlying mechanism of action.O. dillenii cladode methanol extract was subjected to vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC) furnishing two main fractions viz (T-1 and -2) leading to isolation of opuntiol (aglycone) and opuntioside (O-glucoside), respectively. Anti-inflammatory activity of extract, fractions, pure compounds and reference drugs were evaluated using: (1)  (AA) and 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced ear edema accompanied by histological studies of mice ear sections and phospholipase A2 (PLA2)-induced mice paw edema. (2) Carrageenan and glycogen-induced peritonitis in rodents. In parallel levels of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and reactive  species (ROS) were also determined via HPLC and fluoroemetrically using 2', 7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) dye, respectively. Additionally, levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukins IL-1β and -6 were measured by ELISA assay.O. dillenii methanol extract, fractions and pure compounds reduced AA and TPA-induced ear punch weight in a dose dependent fashion. The corresponding IC50 values obtained also suppressed inflammatory features observed histologically. Furthermore, paw edema and peritonitis were also attenuated. Similar to indomethacin and diclofenac sodium, opuntioside reduced PGE2 levels of inflamed ear which was comparatively 1.3× better than opuntiol. However, opuntiol was more potent in reducing LTB4 levels in rat neutrophils with an IC50 value of 19±3.3μΜ, while opuntioside was ineffective. Opuntiol also effectively suppressed ROS (37%) and cytokine levels (TNF-α, IL-1β and -6) by ~50% and comparable to dexamethasone.O. dillenii cladodes possess anti-inflammatory properties via inhibition of  metabolites and cytokines. Opuntiol (aglycone) emerged as a dual inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipooxygenase (LOX) pathways. It also suppressed ROS and cytokine levels. However, opuntioside manifested its selectivity towards COX (PGE2) pathway without affecting LTB4 levels. The present report describing the anti-inflammatory activity of opuntiol and opuntioside for the first time thereby, supporting and justifying the traditional use of O. dillenii against inflammation and may serve as lead compound in designing of new anti-inflammatory agents.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Free radicals and reactive  species play important roles in pathogenesis of oral lichen planus (OLP). Isoprostanes show oxidative stress and are formed by free-radical mediated lipid peroxidation of  and cell membrane phospholipids.This study was conducted to evaluate the plasma level of 8-isoprostane in patients suffering from erosive and non-erosive forms of OLP.In this case-control study, 31 patients with OLP and 30 control subjects were enrolled. Plasma samples were obtained and the level of 8-isoprostane was measured with Sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in both groups. The data were analyzed by using two-sample t-test, chi-square and ANOVA tests.The results showed significant increase in the plasma level of 8-isoprostane in OLP group compared with the control group. The results of independent t-test revealed no significant correlation between the plasma level of isoprostane and sex, smoking, or previous treatment.Based on the findings of this study, oxidative stress was increased in patients with OLP, reflected by higher concentrations of 8-isoprostane in plasma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27619153>Binaural blood flow control by astrocytes: listening to synapses and the vasculature.</a></h2><p>Astrocytes are the most common glial cells in the brain with fine processes and endfeet that intimately contact both neuronal synapses and the cerebral vasculature. They play an important role in mediating neurovascular coupling (NVC) via several astrocytic Ca -dependent signalling pathways such as K release through B channels, and the production and release of  metabolites. They are also involved in maintaining the resting tone of the cerebral vessels by releasing ATP and COX-1 derivatives. Evidence also supports a role for astrocytes in maintaining blood pressure-dependent change in cerebrovascular tone, and perhaps also in blood vessel-to-neuron signalling as posited by the 'hemo-neural hypothesis'. Thus, astrocytes are emerging as new stars in preserving the intricate balance between the high energy demand of active neurons and the supply of  and nutrients from the blood by maintaining both resting blood flow and activity-evoked changes therein. Following neuropathology, astrocytes become reactive and many of their key signalling mechanisms are altered, including those involved in NVC. Furthermore, as they can respond to changes in vascular pressure, cardiovascular diseases might exert previously unknown effects on the central nervous system by altering astrocyte function. This review discusses the role of astrocytes in neurovascular signalling in both physiology and pathology, and the impact of these findings on understanding BOLD-fMRI signals.© 2016 The Authors.

There are reports demonstrating that whole Bothrops snake venoms and toxins isolated from them are able to activate macrophages functions, such as phagocytosis, production of reactive , cytokines and eicosanoids, however, little is known about the effects of Bothrops alternatus (B.a.) venom on macrophages. In this work, we evaluated the proinflammatory effects of B.a. venom with in vivo and in vitro experiments using the Raw 264.7 cell line and mouse peritoneal macrophages. We detected that B.a. venom augments cell permeability (2-fold), and cellular extravasation (mainly neutrophils), increase proinflammatory cytokines IL1 (∼300-fold), IL12 (∼200-fold), and TNFα (∼80-fold) liberation and induce the expression of enzymes related to lipid signaling, such as cPLA and COX-2. Additionally, using lipidomic techniques we detected that this venom produces a release of  (∼10 nMol/mg. Protein) and other fatty acids (16:0 and 18:1 n-9c). Although much of these findings were described in inflammatory processes induced by other bothropic venoms, here we demonstrate that B.a. venom also stimulates pro-inflammatory pathways involving lipid mediators of cell signaling. In this sense, lipidomics analysis of macrophages stimulated with B.a. venom evidenced that the main free fatty acids are implicated in the inflammatory response, and also demonstrated that this venom, is able to activate lipid metabolism even with a low content of PLA.Copyright © 2017.

Oxidative stress is associated with development of several diseases, including liver disease. We prepared the water extract of Moutan Cortex (MCE) to investigate the cytoprotective activities and its mechanism. MCE protected hepatocytes from  (AA)+iron induced oxidative stress, as indicated by reactive  species (ROS) production and cell viability analysis. MCE also suppressed mitochondrial dysfunction in AA+iron-treated human hepatocyte-derived hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, HepG2 cells. In addition, MCE treatment induces AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and liver kinase B1 phosphorylation, which play a role in inhibition of oxidative stress induced cell death. Moreover, one of the MCE compounds, chlorogenic , exerted protective effects against oxidative stress and apoptosis. Taken together, MCE protected hepatocytes against AA+iron-induced oxidative stress through AMPK activation, and may be a candidate for the treatment of liver disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27118599>Accumulation of isolevuglandin-modified protein in normal and fibrotic lung.</a></h2><p>Protein lysine modification by γ-ketoaldehyde isomers derived from , termed isolevuglandins (IsoLGs), is emerging as a mechanistic link between pathogenic reactive  species and disease progression. However, the questions of whether covalent modification of proteins by IsoLGs are subject to genetic regulation and the identity of IsoLG-modified proteins remain unclear. Herein we show that Nrf2 and Nox2 are key regulators of IsoLG modification in pulmonary tissue and report on the identity of proteins analyzed by LC-MS following immunoaffinity purification of IsoLG-modified proteins. Gene ontology analysis revealed that proteins in numerous cellular pathways are susceptible to IsoLG modification. Although cells tolerate basal levels of modification, exceeding them induces apoptosis. We found prominent modification in a murine model of radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis and in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, two diseases considered to be promoted by gene-regulated oxidant stress. Based on these results we hypothesize that IsoLG modification is a hitherto unrecognized sequelae that contributes to radiation-induced pulmonary injury and IPF.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29206462>Lipidomics Reveals Dramatic Physiological Kinetic Isotope Effects during the Enzymatic Oxygenation of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Ex Vivo.</a></h2><p> (AA, 20:4) is an omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) and the main precursor to the class of lipid mediators known as eicosanoids. The enzymes that catalyze the oxygenation of AA begin by abstracting hydrogen from one of three bis-allylic carbons within 1,4-cis,cis-diene units. Substitution of deuterium for hydrogen has been shown to lead to massive kinetic isotope effects (KIE) for soybean lipoxygenase (sLOX) oxygenation of linoleic  (LA, 18:2). Yet, experimental determination of the KIE during oxygenation of AA and LA by mammalian enzymes including cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) has revealed far lower values. All prior studies investigating the KIE of PUFA oxygenation have relied on in vitro systems using purified enzymes and were limited by availability of deuterated substrates. Here we demonstrate the use of macrophages as an ex vivo model system to study the physiological KIE (PKIE) during enzymatic AA oxygenation by living cells using a newly synthesized library of deuterated AA isotopologues. By extending lipidomic UPLC-MS/MS approaches to simultaneously quantify native and deuterated lipid products, we were able to demonstrate that the magnitude of the PKIE measured in macrophages for COX and LOX oxygenation of AA is similar to KIEs determined in previous reports using the AA isotopologue deuterated at carbon 13 (C13). However, for the first time we show that increasing the number of deuterated bis-allylic carbons to include both C10 and C13 leads to a massive increase in the PKIE for COX oxygenation of AA. We provide evidence that hydrogen(s) present at C10 of AA play a critical role in the catalysis of prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis. Furthermore, we discovered that deuteration of C10 promotes the formation of the resolving lipid mediator lipoxin B4, likely by interfering with AA cyclization and shunting AA to the LOX pathway under physiological conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28236844>Altered metabolic homeostasis between vitamin D and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in preeclampsia.</a></h2><p>Sub-optimal maternal nutrition may result in pregnancy complications like preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is known to be of placental origin and a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Our earlier studies suggest that altered metabolism of folic , vitamin B and long chain polyunsaturated fatty  (LCPUFAs) in the one carbon cycle increases homocysteine levels in preeclampsia. Recent reports indicate that vitamin D deficiency may also have a role in preeclampsia, although the mechanisms are unclear. A disturbed one carbon cycle can influence methylation patterns of various genes involved in placental development. Altered expression of cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) gene can result in hyperhomocystenemia. Higher homocysteine levels are known to increase reactive  species (ROS) production which in turn leads to increased expression of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Higher expression of PLA2 and COX-2 can influence the release of  (AA) from membrane phospholipid and result in increased conversion to thromboxane. Vitamin D [1,25(OH)D] is known to induce the CBS gene expression while it can suppress the oxidative stress-induced COX-2 up-regulation and thromboxane production. Based on this, we propose a novel hypothesis that a disturbed vitamin D and LCPUFA metabolism influence the regulation of the one carbon cycle which will trigger inflammation through oxidative stress in preeclampsia. This may lead to altered feto-placental growth and development in preeclampsia.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The metabolic feedback pathway is much faster than 20-HETE-dependent myogenic feedback, and the former thus initiates the cerebral autoregulatory response, while myogenic feedback comprises a relatively slower mechanism that functions to set the basal cerebrovascular tone. Therefore, assessments of dynamic cerebral autoregulation, which may provide information on the response time of the cerebrovasculature, may specifically be used to yield information on metabolic feedback mechanisms, while data based on assessments of static cerebral autoregulation represent the integrated functionality of myogenic and metabolic feedback.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This lipid molecule plays important roles in several biological functions, especially inflammatory processes. In vivo, LXA4 regulates the inflammatory response through several signaling pathways. Its mechanism suggests that it might have an effect on osteoclastogenesis and bone loss. Using both in vitro and in vivo studies, it was here observed that LXA4 could significantly inhibit the formation and function of osteoclasts and these effects could be blocked by Boc-2, the specific inhibitor of FPR2/ALX (the receptor of LXA4). Meanwhile, LXA4 reduce the amount of ovariectomy-induced bone loss. These protective effects was found to be associated with inhibition of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), activator protein-1 (AP-1), PI3K-AKT, and p-38, ERK, and JNK in MAPKs. The expression of the receptor activator of the NF-κB ligand RANKL:osteoprotegerin ratio and serum levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were decreased by LXA4. Moreover, LXA4 prevented the production of reactive  species (ROS), the expression of osteoclast-specific genes, including tartrate-resistant  phosphatase (TRAP), cathepsin K (CK), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, RANK, and osteoclastic related transcription factors of c-Fos, NFATc1 could also be significantly inhibited by LXA4 in a dose-dependent manner. Studies have demonstrated that LXA4 can inhibit the formation and function of osteoclasts through modulation of several pathways both upstream and downstream of RANKL signaling and FPR2/ALX was involved in the procedures. This shows that LXA4 may be used as a new strategy for the treatment of osteoclast-related diseases.Copyright © 2017.

Here, we investigated the protective effects of TES trioleate on cell damage caused by ultraviolet A (UVA) light and reactive  species (ROS). Pre-incubation with 250-1000μM TES trioleate resulted in concentration-dependent protection from UVA-induced damage in HaCaT cells. Additionally, 25-1000μM TES trioleate provided protection against HO in a concentration-dependent manner. In human erythrocytes treated with O, 10-100μM TES trioleate showed concentration-dependent protective effects, similar to but stronger than the controls, 4-BPB and lipophilic antioxidant (+)-α-tocopherol at 100μM. TES trioleate did not have detectable radical scavenging activity. Moreover, compared with (+)-α-tocopherol and rutin, TES trioleate showed low ROS scavenging activity. Thus, although TES trioleate showed cell protective effects against UVA, HO, and O-induced damages, these effects were not caused by the scavenging ability of the radical or ROS. Finally, pretreatment of HaCaT cells and human erythrocytes with l-α-lysophosphatidylcholine produced by PLA2 promoted increased cell damage at low concentrations. Thus, the protective effects of TES trioleate on cellular damage by UVA and ROS may be associated with inhibition of PLA2-dependent cell damage rather than ROS scavenging.Copyright © 2016.

However, HIV and alcohol impact on lipid rafts-mediated immune dysfunction remains unknown. In this study, we investigate the modulation by which oxidative stress induces reactive  species (ROS) affecting redox expression, lipid rafts caveiloin-1, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, and transcriptional sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) gene and protein modification and how these mechanisms are associated with  (AA) metabolites in HIV positive alcohol users, and how they escalate immune dysfunction.In both alcohol using HIV-positive human subjects and in vitro studies of alcohol with HIV-1 gp120 protein in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, increased ROS production significantly affected redox expression in glutathione synthetase (GSS), super oxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and subsequently impacted lipid rafts Cav-1, ABC transporters ABCA1, ABCG1, ABCB1, and ABCG4, and SREBP transcription. The increased level of rate-limiting enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), subsequently, inhibited 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR-7). Moreover, the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and lipoxygenase-5 (5-LOX) mRNA and protein modification tentatively increased the levels of prostaglandin E2 synthases (PGE) in plasma when compared with either HIV or alcohol alone.This article suggests for the first time that the redox inhibition affects lipid rafts, ABC-transporter, and SREBP transcription and modulates AA metabolites, serving as an important intermediate signaling network during immune cell dysfunction in HIV-positive alcohol users.These findings indicate that HIV infection induces oxidative stress and redox inhibition, affecting lipid rafts and ABC transports, subsequently upregulating AA metabolites and leading to immune toxicity, and further exacerbation with alcohol use.

Silver(II) compounds are more oxidizing and therefore have the potential to overcome resistance via extensive attack on cellular components, but have traditionally been hard to stabilize for biological applications. Here, the high oxidation state cation was stabilised using pyridinecarboxylate ligands, of which the 2,6-dicarboxypyridine Ag(II) complex (Ag2,6P) was found to have the best tractability. This complex was found to be more stable in phosphate buffer than DMSO, allowing studies of its interaction with water soluble antioxidants and biological macromolecules, with the aim of demonstrating its potential to oxidize them, as well as determining the reaction products. Spectrophotometric analysis showed that Ag2,6P was rapidly reduced by the antioxidants glutathione, ascorbic  and vitamin E; the unsaturated lipids  and linoleic acids, model carbohydrate β-cyclodextrin, and protein cytochrome c also reacted readily. Analysis of the reaction with glutathione by NMR and electrospray mass spectrometry confirmed that the glutathione was oxidized to the disulfide form. Mass spectrometry also clearly showed the addition of multiple  atoms to the unsaturated fatty acids, suggesting a radical mechanism, and cross-linking of linoleic  was observed. The seven hydroxyl groups of β-cyclodextrin were found to be completely oxidized to the corresponding carboxylates. Treatment of cytochrome c with Ag2,6P led to protein aggregation and fragmentation, and dose-dependent oxidative damage was demonstrated by oxyblotting.

The current study investigated the roles of endocannabinoid signaling in propofol cardioprotection in an in vivo model of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and in in vitro primary cardiomyocyte hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury. The results showed that propofol conditioning increased both serum and cell culture media concentrations of endocannabinoids including anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) detected by LC-MS/MS. The reductions of myocardial infarct size in vivo and cardiomyocyte apoptosis and death in vitro were accompanied with attenuations of oxidative injuries manifested as decreased reactive  species (ROS), malonaldehyde (MDA), and MPO (myeloperoxidase) and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) production. These effects were mimicked by either URB597, a selective endocannabinoids degradation inhibitor, or VDM11, a selective endocannabinoids reuptake inhibitor. In vivo study further validated that the cardioprotective and antioxidative effects of propofol were reversed by selective CB2 receptor antagonist AM630 but not CB1 receptor antagonist AM251. We concluded that enhancing endogenous endocannabinoid release and subsequent activation of CB2 receptor signaling represent a major mechanism whereby propofol conditioning confers antioxidative and cardioprotective effects against myocardial I/R injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26715247>An in vitro metabolomics approach to identify hepatotoxicity biomarkers in human L02 liver cells treated with pekinenal, a natural compound.</a></h2><p>An in vitro cell metabolomics study was performed on human L02 liver cells to investigate the toxic biomarkers of pekinenal from the herb Euphorbia pekinensis Rupr. Pekinenal significantly induced L02 cell damage, which was characterised by necrosis and apoptosis. Metabolomics combined with data pattern recognition showed that pekinenal significantly altered the profiles of more than 1299 endogenous metabolites with variable importance in the projection (VIP) > 1. Further, screening correlation coefficients between the intensities of all metabolites and the extent of L02 cell damage (MTT) identified 12 biomarker hits: ten were downregulated and two were upregulated. Among these hits, LysoPC(18:1(9Z)/(11Z)), PC(22:0/15:0) and PC(20:1(11Z)/14:1(9Z)) were disordered, implying the initiation of inflammation and cell damage. Several fatty acids (FAs) (3-hydroxytetradecanedioic , pivaloylcarnitine and eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamide) decreased due to fatty  oxidation. Dihydroceramide and Cer(d18:0/14:0) were also altered and are associated with apoptosis. Additional examination of the levels of intracellular reactive  species (ROS) and two eicosanoids (PGE2, PGF2α) in the cell supernatant confirmed the fatty  oxidation and  metabolism pathways, respectively. In summary, cell metabolomics is a highly efficient approach for identifying toxic biomarkers and helping understand toxicity mechanisms and predict herb-induced liver injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27319010>Clinacanthus nutans Extracts Modulate Epigenetic Link to Cytosolic Phospholipase A2 Expression in SH-SY5Y Cells and Primary Cortical Neurons.</a></h2><p>Clinacanthus nutans Lindau (C. nutans), commonly known as Sabah Snake Grass in southeast Asia, is widely used in folk medicine due to its analgesic, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory properties. Our recent study provided evidence for the regulation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) mRNA expression by epigenetic factors (Tan et al. in Mol Neurobiol. doi: 10.1007/s12035-015-9314-z , 2015). This enzyme catalyzes the release of  from glycerophospholipids, and formation of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids or toxic lipid peroxidation products such as 4-hydroxynonenal. In this study, we examined the effects of C. nutans ethanol leaf extracts on epigenetic regulation of cPLA2 mRNA expression in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells and mouse primary cortical neurons. C. nutans modulated induction of cPLA2 expression in SH-SY5Y cells by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, MS-275, MC-1568, and TSA. C. nutans extracts also inhibited histone acetylase (HAT) activity. Levels of cPLA2 mRNA expression were increased in primary cortical neurons subjected to 0.5-h -glucose deprivation injury (OGD). This increase was significantly inhibited by C. nutans treatment. Treatment of primary neurons with the HDAC inhibitor MS-275 augmented OGD-induced cPLA2 mRNA expression, and this increase was modulated by C. nutans extracts. OGD-stimulated increase in cPLA2 mRNA expression was also reduced by a Tip60 HAT inhibitor, NU9056. In view of a key role of cPLA2 in the production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids and free radical damage, and the fact that epigenetic effects on genes are often long-lasting, results suggest a role for C. nutans and phytochemicals to inhibit the production of -derived pro-inflammatory eicosanoids and chronic inflammation, through epigenetic regulation of cPLA2 expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26923505>Interactions Between Anandamide and Corticotropin-Releasing Factor Signaling Modulate Human Amygdala Function and Risk for Anxiety Disorders: An Imaging Genetics Strategy for Modeling Molecular Interactions.</a></h2><p>Preclinical models reveal that stress-induced amygdala activity and impairment in fear extinction reflect reductions in anandamide driven by corticotropin-releasing factor receptor type 1 (CRF1) potentiation of the anandamide catabolic enzyme fatty  amide hydrolase.Here, we provide clinical translation for the importance of these molecular interactions using an imaging genetics strategy to examine whether interactions between genetic polymorphisms associated with differential anandamide (FAAH rs324420) and CRF1 (CRHR1 rs110402) signaling modulate amygdala function and anxiety disorder diagnosis.Analyses revealed that individuals with a genetic background predicting relatively high anandamide and CRF1 signaling exhibited blunted basolateral amygdala habituation, which further mediated increased risk for anxiety disorders among these same individuals.The convergence of preclinical and clinical data suggests that interactions between anandamide and CRF1 represent a fundamental molecular mechanism regulating amygdala function and anxiety. Our results further highlight the potential of imaging genetics to powerfully translate complex preclinical findings to clinically meaningful human phenotypes.Copyright © 2015 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

To better assess the health impacts of point sources of industrial air pollution, a randomized crossover exposure study was conducted. Sixty one young and healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to spend five consecutive eight-hour days near a steel mill or at a location five kilometres away. After a nine or sixteen-day washout period, volunteers spent another five consecutive days at the second site. Meteorological conditions and air pollutants were monitored at both exposure sites. On each exposure day, the first morning urine was collected along with a second urine sample obtained immediately before leaving the exposure site at the end of the day. Urinary levels of biomarkers of oxidative stress 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG, a biomarker of oxidative DNA damage), malondialdehyde (MDA, a biomarker of lipid peroxidation), 8-isoprostane (8-IsoP, a bioactive metabolite resulting from the peroxidation of ) and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF, involved in response to oxidative stress) were measured. According to mixed-effects linear regression models, intra-individual variations in 8-OHdG urinary levels were significantly associated with exposure site, but surprisingly, lower levels were observed at the steel mill site. Delayed, temporally-defined associations with specific air pollutants were observed for 8-OHdG, 8-IsoP and VEGF. However, these associations were subtle, presented complex patterns and their biological consequences remain unclear.Crown Copyright © 2016. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

However, little is known about mediators of 20-HETE neurotoxicity after ischemia. Here, we focus on the role of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) in 20-HETE-induced neurotoxicity. Our results showed that TRPV1 and CYP4A immunoreactivity were colocalized in neurons. TRPV1 inhibition attenuated 20-HETE mimetic 20-5,14-HEDGE-induced reactive  species (ROS) production and neuronal injury in cultured neurons and protected ischemic neurons in vitro and in vivo. TRPV1 inhibition in combination with 20-HETE synthesis inhibitor HET0016 did not produce additional protective effects. Furthermore, TRPV1 genetic inhibition and NADPH oxidase inhibitor gp91ds-dat each attenuated ROS production to a similar extent. However, combined treatment did not achieve additional reduction. Therefore, we conclude that TRPV1 channels are involved in 20-HETE's ROS generation and neurotoxicity after ischemia.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Hyperoxia can have hemodynamic effects, including an increase in systemic vascular resistance. This increase suggests hyperoxia-induced vasoconstriction, yet reported direct effects of hyperoxia on vessel tone have been inconsistent. Furthermore, hyperoxia-induced changes in vessel diameter have not been studied in mice, currently the most used mammal model of disease. In this study we set out to develop a pressure-myograph model using isolated vessels from mice for investigation of pathways involved in hyperoxic vasoconstriction. Isolated conduit and resistance arteries (femoral artery and gracilis arteriole, respectively) from C57BL/6 mice were exposed to normoxia (PO2 of 80 mmHg) and three levels of hyperoxia (PO2 of 215, 375 and 665 mmHg) in a no-flow pressure myograph setup. Under the different PO2 levels, dose-response agonist induced endothelium-dependent vasodilation (acetylcholine, ), endothelium-independent vasodilation (s-nitroprusside), as well as vasoconstriction (norepinephrine, prostaglandin F2α) were examined. The investigated arteries did not respond to  by a change in vascular tone. In the dose-response studies, maximal responses and EC50 values to any of the aforementioned agonists were not affected by hyperoxia either. We conclude that arteries and arterioles from healthy mice are not intrinsically sensitive to hyperoxic conditions. The present ex-vivo model is therefore not suitable for further research into mechanisms of hyperoxic vasoconstriction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27015669>Eupatilin induces Sestrin2-dependent autophagy to prevent oxidative stress.</a></h2><p>Eupatilin (5,7-dihydroxy-3,4,6-trimethoxyflavone) has many pharmacological activities including anti-inflammation, anti-oxidant and anti-cancer effects. Autophagy is the basic cellular machinery involving the digestion of damaged cellular components. In the present study, we investigated the protection effects of eupatilin against  (AA) and iron-induced oxidative stress in HepG2 cells and tried to elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible. Eupatilin increased cell viability against AA + iron in a concentration-dependent manner and prevented mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive  species (ROS) production. In addition, AA + iron increased the levels of pro-apoptotic proteins and these changes were prevented by eupatilin. Eupatilin also induced autophagy, as evidenced by the accumulation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain3-II and the detection of autophagic vacuoles. Furthermore, the protective effects of eupatilin on mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production were significantly abolished by autophagy inhibitors. Eupatilin also increased the mRNA level of sestrin-2 and its promoter-driven reporter gene activity, which resulted in the up-regulation of sestrin-2 protein. Finally, gene silencing using sestrin-2 siRNA and the ectopic expression of recombinant adenoviral sestrin-2 indicated that sestrin-2 induction by eupatilin was required for autophagy-mediated cytoprotection against AA + iron. Our results suggest that eupatilin activates sestrin-2-dependent autophagy, thereby preventing oxidative stress induced by AA + iron.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27560773>Inhibition of glutamate receptors reduces the homocysteine-induced whole blood platelet aggregation but does not affect superoxide anion generation or platelet membrane fluidization.</a></h2><p>Homocysteine (Hcy) is an excitotoxic amino . It is potentially possible to prevent Hcy-induced toxicity, including haemostatic impairments, by antagonizing glutaminergic receptors. Using impedance aggregometry with arachidonate and collagen as platelet agonists, we tested whether the blockade of platelet NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate), AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic ) and kainate receptors with their inhibitors: MK-801 (dizocilpine hydrogen maleate, [5R,10S]-[+]-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine), CNQX (7-nitro-2,3-dioxo-1,4-dihydroquinoxaline-6-carbonitrile) and UBP-302 (2-{[3-[(2S)-2-amino-2-carboxyethyl]-2,6-dioxo-3,6-dihydropyrimidin 1(2H)-yl]methyl}benzoic ) may hamper Hcy-dependent platelet aggregation. All the tested compounds significantly inhibited Hcy-augmented aggregation of blood platelets stimulated either with arachidonate or collagen. Hcy stimulated the generation of superoxide anion in whole blood samples in a concentration-dependent manner; however, this process appeared as independent on ionotropic glutamate receptors, as well as on NADPH oxidase and protein kinase C, and was not apparently associated with the extent of either arachidonate- or collagen-dependent platelet aggregation. Moreover, Hcy acted as a significant fluidizer of surface (more hydrophilic) and inner (more hydrophobic) regions of platelet membrane lipid bilayer, when used at the concentration range from 10 to 50 µmol/l. However, this effect was independent on the Hcy action through glutamate ionotropic receptors, since there was no effects of MK-801, CNQX or UBP-302 on Hcy-mediated membrane fluidization. In conclusion, Hcy-induced changes in whole blood platelet aggregation are mediated through the ionotopic excitotoxic receptors, although the detailed mechanisms underlying such interactions remain to be elucidated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30307357>Coupling of oxidative stress responses to tricarboxylic  cycle and prostaglandin E alterations in  under extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field.</a></h2><p> With all-pervasive presence of extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF) in modern life, ELF-EMF has been regarded as an essential factor which may induce changes in many organisms. The objective of the present study was to investigate the physiological responses of  () to 50 Hz, 3 mT ELF-EMF exposure.  Worms were exposed to ELF-EMF from the egg stage until reaching the fourth larva (L4) stage. After exposure, expressions of the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle enzymes were examined by qRT-PCR and western blot analysis. Two lipid metabolites were detected by GC-MS. Reactive  species (ROS) level was detected by dichlorofluorescein staining and worm antioxidant system was investigated by enzymatic activity analysis, including detection of the superoxide dismutase and catalase (CAT) activity and the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC).  The TCA cycle enzyme, fumarase was found with decreased expression under ELF-EMF exposure. And  (ArA) and prostaglandin E(PGE) showed elevated concentrations, with increased expression of prostaglandin E synthase (PGES-2) in ELF-EMF exposed worms. Significant elevation of ROS level was identified accompanied with the significant depression of T-AOC in response to ELF-EMF.  Our results suggested that exposure to 50 Hz, 3 mT ELF-EMF in  can elicit disruptions of the TCA cycle metabolism and PGE formation, coupling ELF-EMF-induced oxidative stress responses.

We previously reported that tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) stimulated the formation of lactosylceramide (LacCer) in L929 fibroblast cells, and this lipid directly bound with and activated cPLA α [Nakamura et al. [2013] J. Biol. Chem. 288:23264-23272]. We herein investigated the role of phosphorylation signaling in the TNFα/LacCer-induced activation of cPLA α in cells. TNFα-treated L929 cells released AA via the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and cPLA α, while a treatment with LacCer alone released AA in a similar manner. The TNFα-induced responses including release of AA were decreased by the inhibition of LacCer synthesis. The treatment with TNFα and LacCer increased the levels of reactive  species (ROS), and the reduction/scavenging of ROS decreased the phosphorylation cascade and release of AA in TNFα/LacCer-treated L929 cells. In the cell line CHO, the treatment with LacCer stimulated the phosphorylation cascade and release of AA via the formation of ROS. Treatments with the anti-LacCer antibody and 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulated the phosphorylation cascade, but did not release AA by itself. When combined with the Ca ionophore A23187, treatments with the anti-LacCer antibody and 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate released AA. These results, including our previous findings, showed that LacCer alone simultaneously stimulates two processes to activate cPLA α: a phosphorylation signal and attachment of the enzyme to substrate membranes.

We found that stimulation of dendritic cells with the fungal surrogate zymosan causes decreases of pyruvate, citrate, itaconate, and α-ketoglutarate, while increasing oxaloacetate, succinate, lactate,  consumption, and pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. Expression of IL10 and IL23A (the gene encoding the p19 chain of IL-23) depended on pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. Mechanistically, pyruvate reinforced histone H3 acetylation, and acetate rescued the effect of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier inhibition, most likely because it is a substrate of the acetyl-CoA producing enzyme ACSS2. Mice lacking the receptor of the lipid mediator platelet-activating factor (PAF; 1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) showed reduced production of IL-10 and IL-23 that is explained by the requirement of acetyl-CoA for PAF biosynthesis and its ensuing autocrine function. Acetyl-CoA therefore intertwines fatty  remodeling of glycerophospholipids and energetic metabolism during cytokine induction.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Altered S1P signaling is strongly associated with inflammation, cancer progression, and atherosclerosis; however, the mechanisms underlying its pathophysiologic effects are only partially understood. This study evaluated the effects of S1P in vitro and in vivo on the biosynthesis of leukotrienes (LTs), which form a class of lipid mediators involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. Here, we report for the first time that S1P potently suppresses LT biosynthesis in Ca-ionophore-stimulated intact human neutrophils. S1P treatment resulted in intracellular Ca mobilization, perinuclear translocation, and finally irreversible suicide inactivation of the LT biosynthesis key enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO). Agonist studies and S1P receptor mRNA expression analysis provided evidence for a S1P receptor 4-mediated effect, which was confirmed by a functional knockout of S1P4 in HL60 cells. Systemic administration of S1P in wild-type mice decreased both macrophage and neutrophil migration in the lungs in response to LPS and significantly attenuated 5-LO product formation, whereas these effects were abrogated in 5-LO or S1P4 knockout mice. In summary, targeting the 5-LO pathway is an important mechanism to explain S1P-mediated pathophysiologic effects. Furthermore, agonism at S1P4 represents a novel effective strategy in pharmacotherapy of inflammation.-Fettel, J., Kühn, B., Guillen, N.

Exogenously administered AA has been shown to affect brain metabolism and to exhibit cardiovascular and neuroendocrine actions. However, little is known regarding its respiratory actions and/or central mechanism of its respiratory effects. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the possible effects of centrally injected AA on respiratory system and the mediation of the central cyclooxygenase (COX) to thromboxane A2 (TXA2) signaling pathway on AA-induced respiratory effects in anaesthetized rats. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of AA induced dose- and time-dependent increase in tidal volume, respiratory rates and respiratory minute ventilation and also caused an increase in partial  pressure (pO2) and decrease in partial carbon dioxide pressure (pCO2) in male anaesthetized Spraque Dawley rats. I.c.v. pretreatment with ibuprofen, a non-selective COX inhibitor, completely blocked the hyperventilation and blood gases changes induced by AA. In addition, central pretreatment with different doses of furegrelate, a TXA2 synthesis inhibitor, also partially prevented AA-evoked hyperventilation and blood gases effects. These data explicitly show that centrally administered AA induces hyperventilation with increasing pO2 and decreasing pCO2 levels which are mediated by the activation of central COX to TXA2 signaling pathway.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we characterized the effect of EE on CYP2J2, a major human P450 isoform that participates in metabolism of . EE inactivated the hydroxyebastine carboxylation activity of CYP2J2 in a reconstituted system. The loss of activity is time and concentration dependent and requires NADPH. The  and  values for the inactivation were 3.6 M and 0.08 minute, respectively. Inactivation of CYP2J2 by EE was due to formation of a heme adduct as well as an apoprotein adduct. Mass spectral analysis of CYP2J2 partially inactivated by EE showed two distinct protein masses in the deconvoluted spectrum that exhibited a mass difference of approximately 312 Da, which is equivalent to the sum of the mass of EE and one  atom. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis revealed a heme adduct with MH ion at / 875.5, corresponding to alkylation of an iron-depleted prosthetic heme by EE plus one  atom. The reactive intermediate responsible for covalently modifying both the prosthetic heme and apoprotein was characterized by trapping with glutathione (GSH). LC-MS/MS analysis revealed two GSH conjugate isomers with MH ions at / 620, which were formed by reaction between GSH and EE with the  being added to either the internal or terminal carbon of the ethynyl moiety.

Nonetheless, despite several assays have been described and successfully utilized in the past, the analysis of ROS generation in human platelets remains challenging. Here we show that dihydroethidium (DHE) allows the characterization of redox responses upon platelet activation by physiological and pathological stimuli. In particular, the flow cytometry assay that we describe here allowed us to confirm that thrombin, collagen-related peptide (CRP) and  but not adenosine diphosphate (ADP) stimulate superoxide anion formation in a concentration-dependent manner. 0.1unit/ml thrombin, 3 μg/ml CRP and 30 μM  are commonly used to stimulate platelets in vitro and here were shown to stimulate a significant increase in superoxide anion formation. The ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) abolished superoxide anion generation in response to all tested stimuli, but the pan-NADPH oxidase (NOX) inhibitor VAS2870 only inhibited superoxide anion formation in response to thrombin and CRP. The involvement of NOXs in thrombin and CRP-dependent responses was confirmed by the inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by these stimuli by VAS2870, while platelet aggregation in response to  was insensitive to this inhibitor. In addition, the pathological platelet stimulus amyloid β (Aβ) 1-42 peptide induced superoxide anion formation in a concentration-dependent manner. Aβ peptide stimulated superoxide anion formation in a NOX-dependent manner, as proved by the use of VAS2870. Aβ 1-42 peptide displayed only moderate activity as an aggregation stimulus, but was able to significantly potentiate platelet aggregation in response to submaximal agonists concentrations, such as 0.03 unit/ml thrombin and 10 μM . The inhibition of NOXs by 10 μM VAS2870 abolished Aβ-dependent potentiation of platelet aggregation in response to 10 μM , suggesting that the pro-thrombotic activity of Aβ peptides depends on NOX activity. Similar experiments could not be performed with thrombin or collagen, as NOXs are required for the signaling induced by these stimuli. These findings shed some new light on the pro-thrombotic activity of Aβ peptides. In summary, here we describe a novel and reliable assay for the detection of superoxide anion in human platelets. This is particularly important for the investigation of the pathophysiological role of redox stress in platelets, a field of research of increasing importance, but hindered by the absence of a reliable and easily accessible ROS detection methodology applicable to platelets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29423508>Association of Retinopathy of Prematurity With Low Levels of : A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial.</a></h2><p>Mice with -induced retinopathy fed matched diets except for ω-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) vs ω-6 LC-PUFAs demonstrate relative antiangiogenic and neuroprotective associations of ω-3 LC-PUFAs. However, supplementing preterm infants with LC-PUFAs has been inconsistent in reducing major preterm morbidities. However, few studies measured serum lipid levels after supplementation.To examine the associated risk of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) from the levels of circulating ω-3 and ω-6 LC-PUFAs.This longitudinal clinical study was a further analysis of serum lipid levels from a randomized controlled trial cohort of 90 infants born at gestational age (GA) less than 28 weeks. From April 4, 2013, to September 22, 2015, cord blood samples, followed by venous blood samples, were obtained at birth and at 1, 7, 14, and 28 days after birth and then at postmenstrual age (PMA) 32, 36, and 40 weeks at the neonatal intensive care unit at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Göteborg, Sweden.Serum phospholipid fatty acids were transmethylated and measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Mann-Whitney test, logistic regression Spearman rank correlation, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were used to compare differences between infants with no ROP and infants who developed ROP.Serum levels from 78 infants (43 male [55%]; mean [SD] GA, 25.5 [1.4] weeks) with a known ROP outcome were evaluated. Lower area under the curve (AUC) of  (AA) (20:4 ω-6) was seen in infants with a later diagnosis of ROP compared with infants with no ROP in the first month of life (mean, 34.05 [95% CI, 32.10-36.00] vs 37.15 [95% CI, 34.85-39.46]; P < .05). In addition, lower levels of AA at 32 weeks' PMA were seen in infants with later severe ROP compared with in those without ROP (mean, 7.06 [95% CI, 6.60-7.52] vs 8.74 [95% CI, 7.80-9.67]; P < .001). In logistic modeling, low postnatal serum levels of AA and GA at birth identified with a sensitivity greater than 90% of infants who developed ROP.Low postnatal levels of the ω-6 LC-PUFAs (AA) are strongly associated with ROP development.

The field comprises a large family of lipid signaling molecules whose importance is only now being fully realized. The most widely studied member is arachidonoyl glycine (NAGly), which differs structurally from the endocannabinoid anandamide (arachidonoyl ethanolamide) by a single  atom even as the two are metabolically related. Topics that are covered in this minireview are: biosynthetic pathways for acyl amino acids, receptors for acyl amino acids, physiologic actions of acyl amino acids, pharmacological effects of acyl amino acids, and molecular mechanisms believed to be responsible for their effects. On the subject of mechanisms, we propose several possibilities whose basis is the currently available information. Four putative pathways can be suggested: 1) inhibition of fatty  amide hydrolase-induced increases in anandamide or 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) levels, resulting in analgesic activity; 2) binding to GPR18, initiating the production of anti-inflammatory eicosanoids (specifically, the data suggest roles for 15-deoxy-Δ-prostaglandin-J and lipoxin A, both of which are potent inflammation-resolving molecules); 3) inactivation of T-type Cav3 channels; and 4) inhibition of the GLYT2 glycine transporter. Each pathway would produce analgesic effects. Also, the acyl amino acids do not bind to either cannabinoid or opioid receptors, thus reducing adverse actions and making them good templates for novel drug candidate molecules.Copyright © 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29237478>AM404, paracetamol metabolite, prevents prostaglandin synthesis in activated microglia by inhibiting COX activity.</a></h2><p>N-arachidonoylphenolamine (AM404), a paracetamol metabolite, is a potent agonist of the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) and low-affinity ligand of the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1). There is evidence that AM404 exerts its pharmacological effects in immune cells. However, the effect of AM404 on the production of inflammatory mediators of the  pathway in activated microglia is still not fully elucidated.In the present study, we investigated the effects of AM404 on the eicosanoid production induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in organotypic hippocampal slices culture (OHSC) and primary microglia cultures using Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and ELISA.Our results show that AM404 inhibited LPS-mediated prostaglandin E (PGE) production in OHSC, and LPS-stimulated PGE release was totally abolished in OHSC if microglial cells were removed. In primary microglia cultures, AM404 led to a significant dose-dependent decrease in the release of PGE, independent of TRPV1 or CB1 receptors. Moreover, AM404 also inhibited the production of PGD and the formation of reactive  species (8-iso-PGF alpha) with a reversible reduction of COX-1- and COX-2 activity. Also, it slightly decreased the levels of LPS-induced COX-2 protein, although no effect was observed on LPS-induced mPGES-1 protein synthesis.This study provides new significant insights about the potential anti-inflammatory role of AM404 and new mechanisms of action of paracetamol on the modulation of prostaglandin production by activated microglia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651026>Peroxiredoxin 6 regulates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT pathway to maintain human sperm viability.</a></h2><p>Peroxiredoxins (PRDXs) are antioxidant enzymes proven to control the levels of reactive  species (ROS) and to avoid oxidative damage in the spermatozoon. Previously, we have shown that low amounts of PRDXs are associated with male infertility and that PRDX6 is the primary antioxidant defence in human spermatozoa, maintaining survival and DNA integrity (Gong et al., 2012, Fernandez and O'Flaherty, 2018). Oxidative stress can trigger different pathway cascades in the spermatozoa, including truncated apoptosis. It has been reported that the phosphorylation status of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and its target AKT (protein kinase B) prevent the spermatozoon from entering the truncated apoptotic cascade. Here, we aim to study the regulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway by PRDX6 and assess its role in maintaining sperm viability. Human semen samples were obtained over 1 year from 20 healthy non-smoking volunteers aged 22-30 years old. Sperm viability, lipid peroxidation and apoptosis-like changes were determined by flow cytometry while phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT substrates were assessed by immunoblotting using anti-phospho-PI3K and anti-phospho-AKT substrates antibodies. We found that the addition of  and lysophosphatidic , products of PRDX6 calcium independent phospholipase A2 (Ca2+-iPLA2), prevented loss of sperm viability and maintained the phosphorylation of PI3K. Antioxidant compounds such as D-penicillamine partially prevented the oxidative damage on spermatozoa that led to a reduction of their viability. Thus, other pathways can also participate in sperm survival and be regulated by PRDXs. In conclusion, PRDX6 contributes to the regulation of ROS production and the PI3K/AKT pathway for the maintenance of sperm survival.© The Author(s) 2019.

Several hypertensive stimuli contribute to formation of IsoLG-protein adducts including excess dietary salt and catecholamines. The precise intracellular mechanisms by which these hypertensive stimuli lead to IsoLG-protein adduct formation are still not well understood; however, there is now evidence implicating NADPH-oxidase derived reactive  species (ROS) in this process. ROS oxidize  leading to formation of IsoLGs, which non-covalently adduct to lysine residues and alter protein structure and function. Recent studies suggest that these altered proteins act as neo-antigens leading to an autoimmune state that results in hypertension. The goal of this mini-review is to highlight some of the hypertensive stimuli and the mechanisms contributing to IsoLG-protein adduct formation leading to inflammation and hypertension.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have been shown to have cardio-protective effects in numerous pathological situations. It is not known whether rapeseed oil, which contains α-linolenic  (ALA), has a similar protective effect. Omega-3 PUFAs are sensitive to attack by reactive  species (ROS), and lipid peroxidation products could damage cardiac cells. We thus tested whether dietary refined rapeseed oil (RSO) associated with or without different antioxidants (vitamin E, coenzyme Q10 and canolol) is cardio-protective in a situation of abdominal obesity.Sixty male Wistar rats were subdivided into 5 groups. Each group was fed a specific diet for 11 weeks: a low-fat diet (3% of lipids, C diet) with compositionally-balanced PUFAs; a high-fat diet rich in palm oil (30% of lipids, PS diet); the PS diet in which 40% of lipids were replaced by RSO (R diet); the R diet supplemented with coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and vitamin E (RTC diet); and the RTC diet supplemented with canolol (RTCC diet). At the end of the diet period, the rats were sacrificed and the heart was collected and immediately frozen. Fatty  composition of cardiac phospholipids was then determined. Several features of cardiac function (fibrosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis) were also estimated.Abdominal obesity reduced cardiac oxidative stress and apoptosis rate by increasing the proportion of  (AA) in membrane phospholipids. Dietary RSO had the same effect, though it normalized the proportion of AA. Adding vitamin E and CoQ10 in the RSO-rich high fat diet had a deleterious effect, increasing fibrosis by increasing angiotensin-2 receptor-1b (Ag2R-1b) mRNA expression. Overexpression of these receptors triggers coronary vasoconstriction, which probably induced ischemia. Canolol supplementation counteracted this deleterious effect by reducing coronary vasoconstriction.Canolol was found to counteract the fibrotic effects of vitamin E + CoQ10 on cardiac fibrosis in the context of a high-fat diet enriched with RSO. This effect occurred through a restoration of cardiac Ag2R-1b mRNA expression and decreased ischemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29948494>Anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic effects of methanol extract of the stem bark of Boswellia dalzielii Hutch (Burseraceae) in rats.</a></h2><p>Boswellia dalzielii is a tall tree (more than 13 m high) that produces aromatic white flowers. This plant is commonly used in indigenous medicine across Africa against diarrhea, malaria, vomiting, inflammation and arthritis. The present study focuses on the anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritis potential of methanol extract of Boswellia dalzielii (BDME). Anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated in inflammatory models induced by carrageenan, , histamine, serotonin, prostaglandin and bradykinin. Anti-arthritis activity was measured using complete Freund's adjuvant model. Intracellular and extracellular ROS production and proliferation of T-cells were evaluated using chemiluminescence and liquid scintillation counter techniques, respectively. TNF-α and IL-1β production were assessed using ELISA and MTT assay performed for cytotoxicity. BDME revealed a significant anti-inflammatory effect by preventing the development of edema caused by carrageenan, , histamine, serotonin, prostaglandin and bradykinin. For anti-arthritic properties of BDME, the results showed a significant reduction of the joint diameter and a decrease in pain in the treated animals. The extract also showed a noticeable systemic effect, maintaining the values of the evaluated parameters close to normal in treated rats with an inhibition of joint destruction as shown in histopathological analysis. Furthermore, BDME exhibited significant inhibition of extracellular and intracellular ROS production. Still, the extract displayed significant inhibitory activity on T-cell proliferation as well as a reduced production of TNF-α and IL-1β. Boswellia dalzielii could be considered as a promising tract in the prevention and/or management of inflammatory diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31140173> and Nitroarachidonic: Effects on NADPH Oxidase Activity.</a></h2><p> (AA) is a polyunsaturated fatty  that participates in the inflammatory response mainly through bioactive-lipids formation in macrophages and also in the phagocytic NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) activation. NOX2 is the enzyme responsible for a huge superoxide formation in macrophages, essential to eliminate pathogens inside the phagosome. The oxidase is an enzymatic complex comprised of a membrane-bound flavocytochrome b  (gp91/p22), three cytosolic subunits (p47, p40 and p67) and a Rac-GTPase. The enzyme becomes active when macrophages are exposed to appropriate stimuli that trigger the phosphorylation of cytosolic subunits and its migration to plasmatic membrane to form the active complex. It is proposed that AA stimulates NOX2 activity through AA interaction with different components of the NADPH oxidase complex. In inflammatory conditions, there is an increase in reactive  and nitrogen species that results in the production of nitrated derivatives of AA, such as nitroarachidonic  (NO-AA). NO-AA is capable to inhibit NOX2 activity by interfering with p47 migration to the membrane without affecting phosphorylation of cytosolic proteins. Also, NO-AA is capable to interact with protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), which is involved on NOX2 active complex formation. It has been demonstrated that NO-AA forms a covalent adduct with PDI that could prevent the interaction with NOX2 and it would explain the inhibitory effects of the fatty  upon NOX2. Together, current data indicate that AA is an important activator of NOX2 formed in the early events of the inflammatory response, leading to a massive production of oxidants that may, in turn, promote NO-AA formation and shutting down the oxidative burst. Hence, AA and its derivatives could have antagonistic roles on NOX2 activity regulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29554965>Fucoxanthin, the constituent of Laminaria japonica, triggers AMPK-mediated cytoprotection and autophagy in hepatocytes under oxidative stress.</a></h2><p>Laminaria japonica has frequently been used as a food supplement and drug in traditional oriental medicine. Among the major active constituents responsible for the bioactivities of L. japonica, fucoxanthin (FX) has been considered as a potential antioxidant. This study was conducted to examine the effects of L. japonica extract (LJE) or FX against oxidative stress on hepatocytes and to elucidate the overall their cellular mechanisms of the effects.We constructed an in vitro model with the treatment of  (AA) + iron in HepG2 cells to stimulate the oxidative damage. The cells were pre-treated with LJE or FX for 1 h, and incubated with AA + iron. The effect on oxidative damage and cellular mechanisms of LJE or FX were assessed by cytological examination and several biochemical assays under conditions with or without kinase inhibitiors.LJE or FX pretreatment effectively blocked the pathological changes caused by AA + iron treatment, such as cell death, altered expression of apoptosis-related proteins such as procaspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, and mitochondria dysfunction. Moreover, FX induced AMPK activation and AMPK inhibitor, compound C, partially reduced the protective effect of FX on mitochondria dysfunction. Consistent with AMPK activation, FX increased the protein levels of autophagic markers (LC3II and beclin-1) and the number of acridine orange stained cells, and decreased the phosphorylation of mTOR and simultaneously increased the phosphorylation of ULK1. And the inhibition of autophagy by 3-methylanine or bafilomycin A1 partially inhibited the protective effect of FX on mitochondria dysfunction.These findings suggest that FX have the function of being a hepatic protectant against oxidative damages through the AMPK pathway for the control of autophagy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480995>Endothelial dysfunction in dyslipidaemia: Molecular mechanisms and clinical implications.</a></h2><p>The endothelium consists of a monolayer of endothelial cells (ECs) which form the inner cellular lining of veins, arteries, capillaries and lymphatic vessels. ECs interact with the blood and lymph. The endothelium fulfils functions such as vasodilatation, regulation of adhesion, infiltration of leukocytes, inhibition of platelet adhesion, vessel remodeling and lipoprotein metabolism. ECs synthesize and release compounds such as nitric oxide (NO), metabolites of , reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enzymes that degrade the extracellular matrix. Endothelial dysfunction represents a phenotype prone to atherogenesis and may be used as a marker of atherosclerotic risk. Such dysfunction includes impaired synthesis and availability of NO and an imbalance in the relative contribution of endothelial-derived relaxing factors and contracting factors such as endothelin-1 and angiotensin. This dysfunction appears before the earliest anatomic evidence of atherosclerosis and could be an important initial step in further development of atherosclerosis. Endothelial dysfunction was historically treated with vitamin C supplementation and L-arginine supplementation. Short term improvement of the expression of adhesion molecule and endothelial function during antioxidant therapy has been observed. Statins are used in the treatment of hyperlipidaemia, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Future studies should focus on identifying the mechanisms involved in the beneficial effects of statins on the endothelium. This may help develop drugs specifically aimed at endothelial dysfunction.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31052167>Dihydropyrazole Derivatives Containing Benzo  Heterocycle and Sulfonamide Moieties Selectively and Potently Inhibit COX-2: Design, Synthesis, and Anti-Colon Cancer Activity Evaluation.</a></h2><p>Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) as a rate-limiting metabolism enzyme of  has been found to be implicated in tumor occurrence, angiogenesis, metastasis as well as apoptosis inhibition, regarded as an attractive therapeutic target for cancer therapy.

N-6 and n-3 PUFAs protect against breast cancer, but the molecular mechanisms of this effect are not clear. We investigated the effect of n-6 and n-3 PUFAs on OSGIN1 expression and whether OSGIN1 is involved in PUFA-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells. We used 100 μM of n-6 PUFAs including , linoleic , and gamma-linolenic  and n-3 PUFAs including alpha-linolenic , eicosapentaenoic , and docosahexaenoic  (DHA). Only DHA significantly induced OSGIN1 protein and mRNA expression. DHA triggered reactive  species (ROS) generation and nuclear translocation of Nrf2. LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, suppressed DHA-induced OSGIN1 protein expression and nuclear accumulation of Nrf2. Nrf2 knockdown attenuated DHA-induced OSGIN1 expression. N-Acetyl-l-cysteine, a ROS scavenger, abrogated the DHA-induced increases in Akt phosphorylation, Nrf2 nuclear accumulation, and OSGIN1 expression. DHA induced the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, mitochondrial accumulation of OSGIN1 and p53, and cytochrome c release; knockdown of OSGIN1 diminished these effects. In conclusion, induction of OSGIN1 by DHA is at least partially associated with increased ROS production, which activates PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling. Induction of OSGIN1 may be involved in DHA-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

COX-2 protein expression is highly induced by numerous factors and it has been reportedly overexpressed in various human malignancies. Although anti-tumorigenic effects of COX-2 inhibitors have been shown, several lines of evidence suggest that COX-2 inhibitors antagonize the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents. In this study, we investigated the effect of NS-398, a COX-2 inhibitor, on modulation of doxorubicin (DOX)-induced p53 accumulation. Non-selective and selective COX-2 inhibitors attenuated DOX-induced accumulation of wild type (WT) but not mutant p53. Nutlin-3α or MG132 abolished the suppressive effect of a COX-2 inhibitor on DOX-induced p53 increase. Moreover, the DOX-induced increase in p53 protein levels was reduced in COX-2 knockout (KO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) compared to those in WT or COX-1 KO MEFs. DOX-induced accumulation of p53 was attenuated by a specific inhibitor or knockdown of Jun-N-terminal kinase (Jnk). In addition, DOX-induced Jnk activation was decreased in COX-2 KO MEFs or by COX-2 inhibition, suggesting that Jnk stabilizes p53 by a mechanism that involves COX-2. Pre-treatment with a reactive  species (ROS) scavenger, N-acetylcysteine, attenuated DOX-induced Jnk activation and subsequent p53 accumulation. Furthermore, the absence or inhibition of COX-2 resulted in suppression of DOX-induced increase in ROS levels. These results suggest that COX-2 activates Jnk through modulation of ROS levels, leading to accumulation of p53.

It is responsible for the bioactivation of  (AA) into epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs). EETs are biologically active signaling compounds that protect against disease progression, particularly in cardiovascular diseases. As a drug-metabolizing enzyme, CYP2J2 is susceptible to drug interactions that could lead to cardiotoxicity. CYP2J2 has been shown to be resistant to induction by canonical CYP inducers such as phenytoin and rifampin. It is, however, unknown how cellular stresses augment  expression. Here, we determine the effects of oxidative stress on gene expression in adult ventricular myocytes. Further, we assess the consequences of CYP2J2 inhibition and  silencing on cells when levels of reactive  species (ROS) are elevated. Findings indicate that  expression increases in response to external ROS or when internal ROS levels are elevated. In addition, cell survival decreases with ROS exposure when CYP2J2 is chemically inhibited or when  expression is reduced using small interfering RNA. These effects are mitigated with external addition of EETs to the cells. Finally, we determined the results of external EETs on gene expression and show that only two of the four regioisomers cause an increase in  expression. This work is the first to determine the consequence of cellular stress, specifically high ROS levels, on CYP2J2 expression in human ventricular myocytes and discusses how this enzyme may play an important role in response to cardiac oxidative stress.Copyright © 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28508993>14,15-EET Suppresses Neuronal Apoptosis in Ischemia-Reperfusion Through the Mitochondrial Pathway.</a></h2><p>Neuronal apoptosis mediated by the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway is an important pathological process in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. 14,15-EET, an intermediate metabolite of , can promote cell survival during ischemia/reperfusion. However, whether the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway is involved this survival mechanism is not fully understood. In this study, we observed that infarct size in ischemia-reperfusion injury was reduced in sEH gene knockout mice. In addition, Caspase 3 activation, cytochrome C release and AIF nuclear translocation were also inhibited. In this study, 14,15-EET pretreatment reduced neuronal apoptosis in the -glucose deprivation and re-oxygenation group in vitro. The mitochondrial apoptosis pathway was also inhibited, as evidenced by AIF translocation from the mitochondria to nucleus and the reduction in the expressions of cleaved-caspase 3 and cytochrome C in the cytoplasm. 14,15-EET could reduce neuronal apoptosis through upregulation of the ratio of Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic protein) to Bax (apoptosis protein) and inhibition of Bax aggregation onto mitochondria. PI3K/AKT pathway is also probably involved in the reduction of neuronal apoptosis by EET. Our study suggests that 14,15-EET could suppress neuronal apoptosis and reduce infarct volume through the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Furthermore, the PI3K/AKT pathway also appears to be involved in the neuroprotection against ischemia-reperfusion by 14,15-EET.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29200270> Metabolism by Human Cardiovascular CYP2J2 Is Modulated by Doxorubicin.</a></h2><p>Doxorubicin (DOX) is a chemotherapeutic that is used in the treatment of a wide variety of cancers. However, it causes cardiotoxicity partly because of the formation of reactive  species. CYP2J2 is a human cytochrome P450 that is strongly expressed in cardiomyocytes. It converts  (AA) into four different regioisomers of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs). Using kinetic analyses, we show that AA metabolism by CYP2J2 is modulated by DOX. We show that cytochrome P450 reductase, the redox partner of CYP2J2, metabolizes DOX to 7-deoxydoxorubicin aglycone (7-de-aDOX). This metabolite then binds to CYP2J2 and inhibits and alters the preferred site of metabolism of AA, leading to a change in the ratio of the EET regioisomers. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations indicate that 7-de-aDOX and AA can concurrently bind to the CYP2J2 active site to produce these changes in the site of AA metabolism. To determine if these observations are unique to DOX/7-de-aDOX, we use noncardiotoxic DOX analogues, zorubicin (ZRN) and 5-iminodaunorubicin (5-IDN). ZRN and 5-IDN inhibit CYP2J2-mediated AA metabolism but do not change the ratio of EET regioisomers. Altogether, we demonstrate that DOX and 7-de-aDOX inhibit CYP2J2-mediated AA metabolism and 7-de-aDOX binds close to the active site to alter the ratio of cardioprotective EETs. These mechanistic studies of CYP2J2 can aid in the design of new alternative DOX derivatives.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29433393>Epimedium koreanum Ameliorates Oxidative Stress-Mediated Liver Injury by Activating Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-Related Factor 2.</a></h2><p>Oxidative stress induced by reactive  species is the main cause of various liver diseases.

EKE also decreased the number of nitrotyrosine-, 4-hydroxynonenal-, cleaved caspase-3-, and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-positive cells in hepatic tissues.

Since the majority of published data has proven that their intake does not induce toxic or carcinogenic effects in humans, their possible preventive use against cancer has been suggested. On the other hand, it is unlikely that they could be effective in cancer patients as a single therapy. Nevertheless, a considerable effort has been put forth in recent years to evaluate the hypothesis that n-3 PUFA might improve the antineoplastic efficiency of currently used anticancer agents. The rationale for this therapeutic combinatory strategy is trying to increase cancer sensitivity to conventional therapies. This could allow the use of lower drug/radiation doses and, thereby, a reduction in the detrimental health effects associated with these treatments. We will here critically examine the studies that have investigated this possibility, by focusing particularly on the biological and molecular mechanisms underlying the antineoplastic effect of these combined treatments.

We aimed at integrating plasma metabolomic and transcriptomic approaches to systematically explore the roles of the AA metabolism pathway in response to acute hypoxia using an acute mountain sickness (AMS) model.  Blood samples were obtained from 53 enrolled subjects before and after exposure to high altitude. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry and RNA sequencing were separately performed for metabolomic and transcriptomic profiling, respectively. Influential modules comprising essential metabolites and genes were identified by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) after integrating metabolic information with phenotypic and transcriptomic datasets, respectively.  Enrolled subjects exhibited diverse response manners to hypoxia. Combined with obviously altered heart rate,  saturation, hemoglobin, and Lake Louise Score (LLS), metabolomic profiling detected that 36 metabolites were highly related to clinical features in hypoxia responses, out of which 27 were upregulated and nine were downregulated, and could be mapped to AA metabolism pathway significantly. Integrated analysis of metabolomic and transcriptomic data revealed that these dominant molecules showed remarkable association with genes in gas transport incapacitation and disorders of hemoglobin metabolism pathways, such as ALAS2, HEMGN. After detailed description of AA metabolism pathway, we found that the molecules of 15-d-PGJ2, PGA2, PGE2, 12-O-3-OH-LTB4, LTD4, LTE4 were significantly up-regulated after hypoxia stimuli, and increased in those with poor response manner to hypoxia particularly. Further analysis in another cohort showed that genes in AA metabolism pathway such as PTGES, PTGS1, GGT1, TBAS1 et al. were excessively elevated in subjects in maladaptation to hypoxia.  This is the first study to construct the map of AA metabolism pathway in response to hypoxia and reveal the crosstalk between phenotypic variation under hypoxia and the AA metabolism pathway. These findings may improve our understanding of the advanced pathophysiological mechanisms in acute hypoxic diseases and provide new insights into critical roles of the AA metabolism pathway in the development and prevention of these diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30277010>The green microalga Lobosphaera incisa harbours an arachidonate 15S-lipoxygenase.</a></h2><p>The green microalga Lobosphaera incisa is an oleaginous eukaryotic alga that is rich in  (20:4). Being rich in this polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA), however, makes it sensitive to oxidation. In plants, lipoxygenases (LOXs) are the major enzymes that oxidise these molecules. Here, we describe, to our best knowledge, the first characterisation of a cDNA encoding a LOX (LiLOX) from a green alga. To obtain first insights into its function, we expressed it in E. coli, purified the recombinant enzyme and analysed its enzyme activity. The protein sequence suggests that LiLOX and plastidic LOXs from bryophytes and flowering plants may share a common ancestor. The fact that LiLOX oxidises all PUFAs tested with a consistent oxidation on the carbon n-6, suggests that PUFAs enter the substrate channel through their methyl group first (tail first). Additionally, LiLOX form the fatty  hydroperoxide in strict S configuration. LiLOX may represent a good model to study plastid LOX, because it is stable after heterologous expression in E. coli and highly active in vitro. Moreover, as the first characterised LOX from green microalgae, it opens the possibility to study endogenous LOX pathways in these organisms.© 2018 The Authors.

However, in fetuses from phenytoin-treated dams dosed with , the incidence of severe lip deformities remained the same although there was an increase in normal and mildly affected fetuses. Interestingly, this occurred in embryos from hyperglycemic dams.Together, the results from these experiments suggest phenytoin-induced malformations may be a multifactorial process as malformations were not solely linked to a hyperglycemic state of the dam.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31575763> Kills Staphylococcus aureus through a Lipid Peroxidation Mechanism.</a></h2><p> infects every niche of the human host.

These lipid mediators are involved in fever, pain, and thrombosis and are produced from multiple cells as well as cell/cell interactions, for example, immune cells and epithelial/endothelial cells. Metabolic disorders, including hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes, are linked with chronic low-grade inflammation, impacting the immune system and promoting a variety of chronic diseases. Recent Advances: Multiple studies have corroborated the important function of eicosanoids and their receptors in (non)-inflammatory cells in immunometabolic disorders (e.g., insulin resistance, obesity, and cardiovascular and nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases). In this context, LOX and COX products are involved in both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. In addition, recent work has elucidated the potent function of specialized proresolving mediators (i.e., lipoxins and resolvins) in resolving inflammation, protecting organs, and stimulating tissue repair and remodeling.Inhibiting/stimulating selected eicosanoid pathways may result in anti-inflammatory and proresolution responses leading to multiple beneficial effects, including the abrogation of reactive  species production, increased speed of resolution, and overall improvement of diseases related to immunometabolic perturbations.Despite many achievements, it is crucial to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying immunological/metabolic cross talk to offer substantial therapeutic promise.

Dissolved  or  utilization efficiency is a critical factor for Mortierella alpina growth and  production in large-scale fermentation. Overexpression of the Vitreoscilla hemoglobin gene is thought to significantly increase the  utilization efficiency of the cells.An optimized Vitreoscilla hemoglobin (VHb) gene was introduced into Mortierella alpina via Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Compared with the parent strain, the VHb-expressing strain, termed VHb-20, grew faster under both limiting and non-limiting  conditions and exhibited dramatic changes in cell morphology. Furthermore, VHb-20 produced 4- and 8-fold higher total lipid and ARA yields than those of the wild-type strain under a microaerobic environment. Furthermore, ARA production of VHb-20 was also 1.6-fold higher than that of the wild type under normal conditions. The results demonstrated that DO utilization was significantly increased by expressing the VHb gene in Mortierella alpina.The expression of VHb enhances ARA and lipid production under both lower and normal dissolved  conditions.

Highly unsaturated fatty  (UFA) biosynthesis, phospholipid fatty  (PLFA) constituents and microbial structure in activated sludge at low temperature were investigated. Over 12 gigabases of metagenomic sequence data were generated with the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. The result showed 43.11% of phospholipid fatty  (PLFA) in the activated sludge participated in UFA biosynthesis, and γ-Linolenic could be converted to  at low temperature. The highly UFA biosynthesis in activated sludge was n-6 highly UFA biosynthesis, rather than n-3 highly UFA biosynthesis. The microbial community structures of activated sludge were analyzed by PLFA and high-throughput sequencing (HiSeq) simultaneously.

Peripheral nociceptor neurons (PNs) innervate most tissues, and express ion channels, nocisensors, which depolarize the cell in response to intense stimuli and numerous substances. Inflamed tissues manifest inflammatory hyperalgesia in which the threshold for pain and the response to painful stimuli are decreased and increased, respectively. Constituents of the inflammatory milieu sensitize PNs, thereby contributing to hyperalgesia. Polyunsaturated fatty acids undergo enzymatic and free radical-mediated oxygenation into an array of bioactive metabolites, oxygenated polyunsaturated fatty acids (oxy-PUFAs), including the classic eicosanoids. Oxy-PUFA production is enhanced during inflammation. Pioneering studies by Vane and colleagues from the early 1970s first implicated classic eicosanoids in the pain associated with inflammation. Here, we review the production and action of oxy-PUFAs that are not classic eicosanoids, but nevertheless are produced in injured/ inflamed tissues and activate or sensitize PNs. In general, oxy-PUFAs that sensitize PNs may do so directly, by activation of nocisensors, ion channels or GPCRs expressed on the surface of PNs, or indirectly, by increasing the production of inflammatory mediators that activate or sensitize PNs. We focus on oxy-PUFAs that act directly on PNs. Specifically, we discuss the role of -derived 12S-HpETE, HNE, ONE, PGA2, iso-PGA2 and 15d-PGJ2, 5,6-and 8,9-EET, PGE2-G and 8R,15S-diHETE, as well as the linoleic -derived 9-and 13-HODE in inducing acute nocifensive behavior and/or inflammatory hyperalgesia in rodents. The nocisensors TRPV1, TRPV4 and TRPA1, and putative Gαs-type GPCRs are the PN targets of these oxy-PUFAs.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Isolevuglandins (IsoLG) are a family of acyclic γ-ketoaldehydes formed through oxidation of  or as by-products of the cyclooxygenase pathway. IsoLGs are highly reactive aldehydes which are efficient at forming protein adducts and cross-links at concentrations 100-fold lower than 4-hydroxynonenal. Since the contribution of IsoLGs to liver injury has not been studied, we synthesized 15-E-IsoLG and used it to investigate whether IsoLG could induce activation of HSC.Primary human HSC were exposed to 15-E-IsoLG for up to 48h. Exposure to 5μM 15-E-IsoLG in HSCs promoted cytotoxicity and apoptosis. At non-cytotoxic doses (50 pM-500nM) 15-E-IsoLG promoted HSC activation, indicated by increased expression of α-SMA, sustained activation of ERK and JNK signaling pathways, and increased mRNA and/or protein expression of cytokines and chemokines, which was blocked by inhibitors of JNK and NF-kB. In addition, IsoLG promoted formation of reactive  species, and induced an early activation of ER stress, followed by autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy partially reduced the pro-inflammatory effects of IsoLG, suggesting that it might serve as a cytoprotective response.This study is the first to describe the biological effects of IsoLG in primary HSC, the main drivers of hepatic fibrosis.IsoLGs represent a newly identified class of activators of HSC in vitro, which are biologically active at concentrations as low as 500 pM, and are particularly effective at promoting a pro-inflammatory response and autophagy.Copyright © 2016.

Studies have indicated that 20-HETE has important functions in the modulation of vascular tone, ion transport, inflammation reaction, and cellular proliferation. Both we and others have demonstrated that 20-HETE plays an important role in acute phase of ischemic stroke. However, little is known about the effect of 20-HETE on recovery phase of stroke. Crosstalk between the cells within the neurovascular unit is increasingly suspected of playing critical roles in stroke recovery. We found that CYP4A is upregulated in astrocytes exposed to -glucose deprivation (OGD), which increases the production of 20-HETE that promotes endothelial cell proliferation, tube formation and migration. siRNA suppression of CYP4A or 20-HETE inhibitor prevents this effect. In a mouse model of transient focal cerebral ischemia, inhibition of CYP4A reduces peri-infact angiogenesis and worsens neurological deficits 14 days after stroke. We further showed that ischemia injury increases VEGF and HIF-1α expression in cell cultures and ischemic brains, which is negated by a 20-HETE inhibitor-HET0016. Lastly, we showed that JNK signaling pathway is a component of 20-HETE regulated ischemic angiogenesis after stroke. Taken together, we demonstrated a positive influence of 20-HETE in angiogenesis in later stage of stroke. These molecular and in vivo findings also support a previously undescribed mechanism of crosstalk between reactive astrocytes and endothelial cells wherein 20-HETE promotes neurovascular remodeling and functional recovery after ischemic stroke.Copyright © 2018.

The solution viscosity, deuterium kinetic isotope effect (KIE), and -18 KIE experiments further demonstrate that NO activates COX-2 by altering the protein conformation to stimulate substrate association/product release and by accelerating the rate of hydrogen abstraction from AA by catalytic tyrosine radicals.

PGHS exhibits two enzymatic activities following a branched-chain radical mechanism: 1) a peroxidase activity (POX) that utilizes hydroperoxide through heme redox cycles to generate the critical Tyr385 tyrosyl radical for coupling both enzyme activities; 2) the cyclooxygenase (COX) activity inserting two  molecules into AA to generate endoperoxide/hydroperoxide PGG2 through a series of radical intermediates. Upon the generation of Tyr385 radical, COX catalysis is initiated, with C13 pro-S hydrogen abstraction from AA by Tyr385 radical to generate arachidonyl substrate radical.  provides a large driving force for the subsequent fast steps leading to the formation of PGG2, including radical redistributions, ring formations, and rearrangements. On the other hand, if the supply of  is severed, equilibrium between arachidonyl radical and tyrosyl radical(s) biases largely towards the latter. In this study, we demonstrate that such equilibrium is shifted by many factors, including temperature, chemical structures of fatty  substrates and limited supply of . We also, for the first time, reveal that this equilibrium is significantly affected by co-substrates of POX. The presence of efficient POX co-substrates, which reduces heme to its ferric state, apparently biases the equilibrium towards arachidonyl radical.

Since then, extensive research has been conducted in vitro using conductance vessels and materials derived from them. However, the microcirculation controls blood flow to vital organs and has been the focus of in vivo studies of endothelium-dependent dilation beginning immediately after the first in vitro report. Initial in vivo studies employed a light/dye technique for selectively damaging the endothelium to unequivocally prove, in vivo, the existence of endothelium-dependent dilation and in the microvasculature. Endothelium-dependent constriction was similarly proven. Endothelium-dependent agonists include acetylcholine (ACh), bradykinin, , calcium ionophore A-23187, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), serotonin, histamine and endothelin-1. Normal and disease states have been studied. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase and cytochrome P450 have been shown to generate the mediators of the responses. Some of the key enzyme systems generate reactive  species (ROS) like superoxide which may prevent EDR. However, one ROS, namely H O , is one of a number of hyperpolarizing factors that cause dilation initiated by endothelium. Depending upon microvascular bed, a single agonist may use different pathways to elicit an endothelium-dependent response. Interpretation of studies using inhibitors of eNOS is complicated by the fact that these inhibitors may also inhibit ATP-sensitive potassium channels. Other in vivo observations of brain arterioles failed to establish nitric oxide as the mediator of responses elicited by CGRP or by ACh and suggest that a nitrosothiol may be a better fit for the latter.© 2018 Scandinavian Physiological Society.

We tested the hypothesis that 20-HETE inhibition has a protective effect after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and then investigated its effect on angiogenesis. We exposed hippocampal slice cultures to hemoglobin and induced ICH in mouse brains by intrastriatal collagenase injection to investigate the protective effect of 20-HETE synthesis inhibitor N-hydroxy-N'-(4--butyl-2-methylphenyl)-formamidine (HET0016). Hemoglobin-induced neuronal death was assessed by propidium iodide after 18 h in vitro. Lesion volume, neurologic deficits, cell death, reactive  species (ROS), neuroinflammation, and angiogenesis were evaluated at different time points after ICH. In cultured mouse hippocampal slices, HET0016 attenuated hemoglobin-induced neuronal death and decreased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and ROS. In vivo, HET0016 reduced brain lesion volume and neurologic deficits, and decreased neuronal death, ROS production, gelatinolytic activity, and the inflammatory response at three days after ICH. However, HET0016 did not inhibit angiogenesis, as levels of CD31, VEGF, and VEGFR2 were unchanged on day 28. We conclude that 20-HETE is involved in ICH-induced brain damage.

Fatty  translocase (FAT/CD36), whose expression is inducible in obesity, is known for its function in fatty  uptake. Previous work by us and others suggested that CD36 plays an important role in hepatic lipid homeostasis, but the results have been conflicting and the mechanisms were not well understood. In this study, by using CD36-overexpressing transgenic (CD36Tg) mice, we uncovered a surprising function of CD36 in regulating glycogen homeostasis. Overexpression of CD36 promoted glycogen synthesis, and as a result, CD36Tg mice were protected from fasting hypoglycemia. When challenged with a high-fat diet (HFD), CD36Tg mice showed unexpected attenuation of hepatic steatosis, increased very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion, and improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. The HFD-fed CD36Tg mice also showed decreased levels of proinflammatory hepatic prostaglandins and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (20-HETE), a potent vasoconstrictive and proinflammatory  metabolite. We propose that CD36 functions as a protective metabolic sensor in the liver under lipid overload and metabolic stress.

The dual signaling nature of PGE (supporting both inflammation and resolution) makes it a potent regulator of immune cell function. Therefore, the use of dietary long chain n-6 PUFA to enhance PGE effects merits investigation.Day-old pigs ( = 60) were allotted to one of three dietary groups for 21 d ( = 20/diet), and received either a control diet (CON, arachidonate = 0.5% of total fatty acids), an arachidonate (ARA)-enriched diet (LC n-6, ARA = 2.2%), or an eicosapentaenoic (EPA)-enriched diet (LC n-3, EPA = 3.0%). Alveolar macrophages and lung parenchymal tissue were collected for fatty  analysis. Isolated alveolar macrophages were stimulated with LPS in situ for 24 h, and mRNA was isolated to assess markers associated with inflammation and eicosanoid production. Culture media were collected to assess PGE secretion. Oxidative burst in macrophages was measured by: 1)  consumption and extracellular acidification (via Seahorse), 2) cytoplasmic oxidation and 3) nitric oxide production following 4, 18, and 24 h of LPS stimulation.Concentration of ARA (% of fatty acids, /) in macrophages from pigs fed LC n-6 was 86% higher than CON and 18% lower in pigs fed LC n-3 ( < 0.01). Following LPS stimulation, abundance of  and  mRNA ( <  0.0001), and PGE secretion ( < 0. 01) were higher in LC n-6 PAM vs. CON. However,  abundance was 1.6-fold lower than CON. Macrophages from CON and LC n-6 groups were 4-fold higher in  abundance ( < 0.0001) compared to LC n-3.  consumption and extracellular acidification rates increased over 4 h following LPS stimulation ( < 0.05) regardless of treatment. Similarly, increases in cytoplasmic oxidation ( < 0.001) and nitric oxide production ( <  0.002) were observed after 18 h of LPS stimulation but were unaffected by diet.We infer that enriching diets with  may be an effective means to enhance a stronger innate immunologic response to respiratory challenges in neonatal pigs.

It is increasingly appreciated that a major player in TBI-induced oxidative damage is the reactive nitrogen species (RNS) peroxynitrite (PN) which is produced in large part in injured brain mitochondria. Once formed, PN decomposes into highly reactive free radicals that trigger membrane lipid peroxidation (LP) of polyunsaturated fatty acids (e.g. ) and protein nitration (3-nitrotyrosine, 3-NT) in mitochondria and other cellular membranes causing various functional impairments to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and calcium (Ca) buffering capacity. The LP also results in the formation of neurotoxic reactive aldehyde byproducts including 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and propenal (acrolein) which exacerbates ROS/RNS production and oxidative protein damage in the injured brain. Ultimately, this results in intracellular Ca overload that activates proteolytic degradation of α-spectrin, a neuronal cytoskeletal protein. Therefore, the aim of this study was to establish the temporal evolution of mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative damage and cytoskeletal degradation in the brain following a severe controlled cortical impact (CCI) TBI in young male adult rats. In mitochondria isolated from an 8 mm diameter cortical punch including the 5 mm wide impact site and their respiratory function studied ex vivo, we observed an initial decrease in complex I and II mitochondrial bioenergetics within 3 h (h). For complex I bioenergetics, this partially recovered by 12-16 h, whereas for complex II respiration the recovery was complete by 12 h. During the first 24 h, there was no evidence of an injury-induced increase in LP or protein nitration in mitochondrial or cellular homogenates. However, beginning at 24 h, there was a gradual secondary decline in complex I and II respiration that peaked at 72 h. post-TBI that coincided with progressive peroxidation of mitochondrial and cellular lipids, protein nitration and protein modification by 4-HNE and acrolein. The oxidative damage and respiratory failure paralleled an increase in Ca-induced proteolytic degradation of the neuronal cytoskeletal protein α-spectrin indicating a failure of intracellular Ca homeostasis. These findings of a surprisingly delayed peak in secondary injury, suggest that the therapeutic window and needed treatment duration for certain antioxidant treatment strategies following CCI-TBI in rodents may be longer than previously believed.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Numerous reports on the effects of ω-3 PUFAs, such as docosahexaenoic  (DHA, C22:6, ω-3) and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, C20:5, ω-3) on learning and memory impairments of rats are available, however, the role of AA on brain cognition is largely unknown.In this study, our aim was to investigate the effect of oral administration of AA on spatial memory-related learning ability in aged (100 weeks) male rats.One group was per orally administered 240 mg/kg per day AA oil and the other group was administered the similar volume of control oil. Five weeks after the start of the administration, rats were tested with the partially baited eight-arm radial maze to evaluate two types of spatial memory-related learning ability displayed by reference memory errors (RMEs) and working memory errors (WMEs). Also, the time required to complete the task was recorded. The levels of lipid peroxide (LPO) and reactive  species (ROS) were measured, as an indicator oxidative stress in the plasma and brain corticohippocampal brain tissues.The scores of RMEs and WMEs, which are analogous to long-term and short-term memory, respectively, were not affected, however, the trial time was shorter in the AA-administered rats than that of the controls. AA also significantly increased the degree of oxidative stress both in the plasma and corticohippocampal brain tissues.Our results suggest that though AA deposition in the corticohippocampal tissues of senescent rats caused a faster performance activity, which is reminiscent to hyperactive behavior of animals, the spatial learning ability-related memory of the rats, however, was not improved.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28232489>α-Synuclein structural features inhibit harmful polyunsaturated fatty  oxidation, suggesting roles in neuroprotection.</a></h2><p>α-Synuclein (aS) is a protein abundant in presynaptic nerve terminals in Parkinson disease (PD) and is a major component of intracellular Lewy bodies, the pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders such as PD. Accordingly, the relationships between aS structure, its interaction with lipids, and its involvement in neurodegeneration have attracted great interest. Previously, we reported on the interaction of aS with brain polyunsaturated fatty acids, in particular docosahexaenoic  (DHA). aS acquires an α-helical secondary structure in the presence of DHA and, in turn, affects DHA structural and aggregative properties. Moreover, aS forms a covalent adduct with DHA. Here, we provide evidence that His-50 is the main site of this covalent modification. To better understand the role of His-50, we analyzed the effect of DHA on aS-derived species: a naturally occurring variant, H50Q; an oxidized aS in which all methionines are sulfoxides (aS4ox); a fully lysine-alkylated aS (acetyl-aS); and aS fibrils, testing their ability to be chemically modified by DHA. We show, by mass spectrometry and spectroscopic techniques, that H50Q and aS4ox are modified by DHA, whereas acetyl-aS is not. We correlated this modification with aS structural features, and we suggest a possible functional role of aS in sequestering the early peroxidation products of fatty acids, thereby reducing the level of highly reactive lipid species. Finally, we show that fibrillar aS loses almost 80% of its scavenging activity, thus lacking a potentially protective function. Our findings linking aS scavenging activity with brain lipid composition suggest a possible etiological mechanism in some neurodegenerative disorders.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626086>Bamboo Stems ( variety henosis) Containing Polyphenol Mixtures Activate Nrf2 and Attenuate Phenylhydrazine-Induced Oxidative Stress and Liver Injury.</a></h2><p>This study was designed to investigate the hepatoprotective effect of bamboo stems using in vitro and in vivo experimental liver damage models. Ethyl acetate fraction of 80% ethanol extract of  stem (PN3) containing polyphenols had a higher  reporter gene activity as monitored by the activity of the NF-E2-related factor (Nrf2) antioxidant pathway in cells in comparison to extracts from other species and under other conditions. The Nrf2 was translocated from the cytosol to the nucleus in response to PN3, followed by induction of the Nrf2 target gene expression, including , , and  in HepG2 cells. Phosphorylation of Nrf2 in HepG2 cells was enhanced in PN3, which was mediated by PKCδ, ERK, and p38 MAPK. Consequently, PN3 inhibited  (AA) + iron-induced reactive  species generation and glutathione depletion, and, thus, highlighted their role in cytotoxicity. Treatment with major polyphenols of PN3, including catechin, chlorogenic , caffeic , and -coumaric , also improved AA + iron-mediated oxidative stress and, thus, improved cell viability. Treatment with phenylhydrazine in mice, i.e., the iron overload liver injury model, increased plasma alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels and changed histological features in mice-a response that was almost completely blocked by PN3 administration. Moreover, PN3 extract mitigated phenylhydrazine-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. Conclusively, PN3 can exert a hepatoprotective effect against iron overload-induced acute liver damage due to its antioxidant properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27630573>20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (20-HETE) Modulates Canonical Transient Receptor Potential-6 (TRPC6) Channels in Podocytes.</a></h2><p>The  metabolite 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (20-HETE) regulates renal function, including changes in glomerular function evoked during tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF). This study describes the cellular actions of 20-HETE on cultured podocytes, assessed by whole-cell recordings from cultured podocytes combined with pharmacological and cell-biological manipulations of cells. Bath superfusion of 20-HETE activates cationic currents that are blocked by the pan-TRP blocker SKF-96365 and by 50 μM La(3+), and which are attenuated after siRNA knockdown of TRPC6 subunits. Similar currents are evoked by a membrane-permeable analog of diacylgycerol (OAG), but OAG does not occlude responses to maximally-activating concentrations of 20-HETE (20 μM). Exposure to 20-HETE also increased steady-state surface abundance of TRPC6 subunits in podocytes as assessed by cell-surface biotinylation assays, and increased cytosolic concentrations of reactive  species (ROS). TRPC6 activation by 20-HETE was eliminated in cells pretreated with TEMPOL, a membrane-permeable superoxide dismutase mimic. Activation of TRPC6 by 20-HETE was also blocked when whole-cell recording pipettes contained GDP-βS, indicating a role for either small or heterotrimeric G proteins in the transduction cascade. Responses to 20-HETE were eliminated by siRNA knockdown of podocin, a protein that organizes NADPH oxidase complexes with TRPC6 subunits in this cell type. In summary, modulation of ionic channels in podocytes may contribute to glomerular actions of 20-HETE.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26943326>Nitro- Prevents Angiotensin II-Induced Mitochondrial Dysfunction in a Cell Line of Kidney Proximal Tubular Cells.</a></h2><p>Nitro- (NO2-AA) is a cell signaling nitroalkene that exerts anti-inflammatory activities during macrophage activation. While angiotensin II (ANG II) produces an increase in reactive  species (ROS) production and mitochondrial dysfunction in renal tubular cells, little is known regarding the potential protective effects of NO2-AA in ANG II-mediated kidney injury. As such, this study examines the impact of NO2-AA on ANG II-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in an immortalized renal proximal tubule cell line (HK-2 cells). Treatment of HK-2 cells with ANG II increases the production of superoxide (O2●-), nitric oxide (●NO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) expression, peroxynitrite (ONOO-) and mitochondrial dysfunction. Using high-resolution respirometry, it was observed that the presence of NO2-AA prevented ANG II-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction. Attempting to address mechanism, we treated isolated rat kidney mitochondria with ONOO-, a key mediator of ANG II-induced mitochondrial damage, in the presence or absence of NO2-AA. Whereas the activity of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and ATP synthase (ATPase) were diminished upon exposure to ONOO-, they were restored by pre-incubating the mitochondria with NO2-AA. Moreover, NO2-AA prevents oxidation and nitration of mitochondrial proteins. Combined, these data demonstrate that ANG II-mediated oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction is abrogated by NO2-AA, identifying this compound as a promising pharmacological tool to prevent ANG II-induced renal disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28110484>Upregulation of 20-HETE Synthetic Cytochrome P450 Isoforms by -Glucose Deprivation in Cortical Neurons.</a></h2><p>20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (20-HETE), a potent vasoconstrictor, is a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 4A/4F-derived metabolite of . Inhibition of 20-HETE synthesis protects brain from ischemic injury. However, that protection is not associated with changes in cerebral blood flow. The present study examined whether CYP4A isoforms are expressed in neurons, whether they produce 20-HETE in neurons, and whether neuronally derived 20-HETE exerts direct neurotoxicity after -glucose deprivation (OGD). The expression of Cyp4a10 and Cyp4a12a mRNA in cultured mouse cortical neurons increased significantly at 1 and 3 h after exposure to 1 h of OGD. Reoxygenation also markedly augmented the expression of CYP4A protein in neurons and increased 20-HETE levels in the culture medium. Cell viability after OGD increased after treatment with a 20-HETE synthesis inhibitor or an antagonist. That effect was reversed by co-administration of a 20-HETE agonist. These results indicate that neurons express Cyp4a10 and 4a12a, that expression of these isoforms is upregulated by OGD stress, and that neuronally derived 20-HETE directly contributes to neuronal death after reoxygenation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29442208>The role of acyl-CoA thioesterase ACOT8I in mediating intracellular lipid metabolism in oleaginous fungus Mortierella alpina.</a></h2><p>Thioesterases (TEs) play an essential role in the metabolism of fatty acids (FAs). To explore the role of TEs in mediating intracellular lipid metabolism in the oleaginous fungus Mortierella alpina, the acyl-CoA thioesterase ACOT8I was overexpressed. The contents of total fatty acids (TFAs) were the same in the recombinant strains as in the wild-type M. alpina, whilst the production of free fatty acids (FFAs) was enhanced from about 0.9% (wild-type) to 2.8% (recombinant), a roughly threefold increase. Linoleic  content in FFA form constituted about 9% of the TFAs in the FFA fraction in the recombinant strains but only about 1.3% in the wild-type M. alpina. The gamma-linolenic  and  contents in FFA form accounted for about 4 and 25%, respectively, of the TFAs in the FFA fraction in the recombinant strains, whilst neither of them in FFA form were detected in the wild-type M. alpina.

HPV improves systemic arterial oxygenation by matching pulmonary perfusion to ventilation during alveolar hypoxia and is impaired in lung diseases such as the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and in experimental models of endotoxemia. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are pulmonary vasoconstrictors, which are metabolized to less vasoactive dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs) by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). We hypothesized that pharmacological inhibition or a congenital deficiency of sEH in mice would reduce the metabolism of EETs and enhance HPV in mice after challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). HPV was assessed 22 h after intravenous injection of LPS by measuring the percentage increase in the pulmonary vascular resistance of the left lung induced by left mainstem bronchial occlusion (LMBO). After LPS challenge, HPV was impaired in sEH, but not in sEH mice or in sEH mice treated acutely with a sEH inhibitor. Deficiency or pharmacological inhibition of sEH protected mice from the LPS-induced decrease in systemic arterial  concentration (Pa ) during LMBO. In the lungs of sEH mice, the LPS-induced increase in DHETs and cytokines was attenuated. Deficiency or pharmacological inhibition of sEH protects mice from LPS-induced impairment of HPV and improves the Pa after LMBO. After LPS challenge, lung EET degradation and cytokine expression were reduced in sEH mice. Inhibition of sEH might prove to be an effective treatment for ventilation-perfusion mismatch in lung diseases such as ARDS.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28719189>Determination of Double Bond Positions in Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Using the Photochemical Paternò-Büchi Reaction with Acetone and Tandem Mass Spectrometry.</a></h2><p>The positions of double bonds along the carbon chain of methylene interrupted polyunsaturated fatty acids are unique identifiers of specific fatty acids derived from biochemical reactions that occur in cells. It is possible to obtain direct structural information as to these double bond positions using tandem mass spectrometry after collisional activation of the carboxylate anions of an acetone adduct at each of the double bond positions formed by the photochemical Paternò-Büchi reaction with acetone. This reaction can be carried out by exposing a small portion of an inline fused silica capillary to UV photons from a mercury vapor lamp as the sample is infused into the electrospray ion source of a mass spectrometer. Collisional activation of [M - H] yields a series of reverse Paternò-Büchi reaction product ions that essentially are derived from cleavage of the original carbon-carbon double bonds that yield an isopropenyl carboxylate anion corresponding to each double bond location. Aldehydic reverse Paternò-Büchi product ions are much less abundant as the carbon chain length and number of double bonds increase. The use of a mixture of D/D-acetone facilitates identification of these double bonds indicating product ions as shown for . If  is present in the solvent stream undergoing UV photoactivation, ozone cleavage ions are also observed without prior collisional activation.

However, the specific signaling pathways responsible for carcinogenic responses are unclear. Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is a negative regulator of PI3K/AKT pathway that is gradually inactivated in cancers through mutation, loss of heterozygosity and others epigenetic mechanisms. In addition, COX and LOX metabolic pathways of  (AA) play a crucial role in promoting adenoma development. The aim of this study is to clarify the relationship of COX, LOX and PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway. Results showed that the over-expressed COX and LOX in cancer cells can be targeted to decrease the expression of PTEN. After using corresponding inhibitors, this condition was significantly improved and promoted apoptosis, inhibited invasion, proliferation and the production of reactive  species. And for COX-2-/- or 5-LOX-/- Apc mice, the PI3K/AKT pathway was further inhibited via promoting PTEN. Furthermore, weakened oxidative stress, inhibited adenoma growth, and improved survival rate. All findings indicated that PTEN was indirectly targeted by these enzyme inhibitors and acted as the potential therapeutic target for colorectal cancer therapy. In short, COX-2 or 5-LOX deletion and its inhibitors enhanced activity of PTEN and suppressed cell and adenoma progression through PI3K/AKT pathway in colorectal cancer.Copyright © 2019.

It is a complex process involving an acute inflammatory response activated by cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and mediated by free radicals, calcium overload leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. Secretory phospholipases (sPLA2) are a group of pro-inflammatory molecules associated with diseases such as atherosclerosis, which increase the risk of reperfusion injury. This acute response leads to breakdown of phospholipids such as cardiolipin, found in the mitochondrial inner membrane, leading to disruption of energy producing enzymes of the electron transport chain. Thus the activation of secretory phospholipases has a direct link to the vascular occlusion and arrhythmia observed in myocardial reperfusion injury. Therapeutic agents targeting sPLA2 are under human trials and many are in the preclinical phase. This article reviews the pathological effects of various groups of secretory phospholipases (I, II, V and X) implicated in myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury and the phospholipase inhibitors under development. Considering the fact that human trials in this class of drugs is limited, sPLA2 as a potential target for drug development is emphasized.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In the present study, we have focused on the inflammatory signals modulated by the reactive  and nitrogen species (RONS). Under homeostatic conditions, these species turn on the COX-1-dependent  (AA) pathway towards the release of anti-inflammatory enzymes. However, the excess release of these ions induces negative effects in the form of inflammation by turning on the COX-2-dependent AA pathway to release pro-inflammatory enzymes. In the present study, we observed the shunting of the COX-2-dependent AA pathway towards the release of anti-inflammatory enzymes with the supplementation of organic dietary selenium in the form of seleniferous maize extracts. We observed that 500 nM selenium concentration in Se-maize extracts downregulated the COX-2 and mPGES-1 expressions by 3.8- and 3.2-fold and upregulated the GPx-1 and H-PGDS expressions by 5.0- and 5.4-fold, respectively.

A loss of balance between oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity produces an excess of reactive nitrogen species (RNS) such as nitric oxide (NO). Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly , docosahexaenoic  and eicosapentaenoic , are closely related to NO and NO synthase. In the pathophysiology of ASD, NO is related to the activity of primary PUFAs. NO modulates short- and long-term synaptic plasticity and plays essential roles in the regulation of a wide range of physiological processes including neurotransmission. NO affects the function of reactive  species (ROS) in the local cellular milieu, in which biological antioxidants are present. NO plays a double role in the organism showing both neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects. Redox imbalance leads to the activation of the neurotoxic pathway, suggesting crossroads for the neurotoxic or neuroprotective effects of NO. Furthermore, the dual role of NO could depend on the adaptive functions of the antioxidant capacity and oxidative stress-related ROS/RNS as the disease progresses. Increased concentrations of  promote neuronal survival, and the dysregulation of the NO system plays an important role in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder and recurrent depressive disorders. Therefore, the NO system could provide useful drug targets for these diseases. NO and NO donors also show therapeutic potential for Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia with refractory symptoms and cognitive dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27043495>Inflammatory signaling in human tuberculosis granulomas is spatially organized.</a></h2><p>Granulomas are the pathological hallmark of tuberculosis (TB). However, their function and mechanisms of formation remain poorly understood. To understand the role of granulomas in TB, we analyzed the proteomes of granulomas from subjects with tuberculosis in an unbiased manner. Using laser-capture microdissection, mass spectrometry and confocal microscopy, we generated detailed molecular maps of human granulomas. We found that the centers of granulomas have a pro-inflammatory environment that is characterized by the presence of antimicrobial peptides, reactive  species and pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. Conversely, the tissue surrounding the caseum has a comparatively anti-inflammatory signature. These findings are consistent across a set of six human subjects and in rabbits. Although the balance between systemic pro- and anti-inflammatory signals is crucial to TB disease outcome, here we find that these signals are physically segregated within each granuloma. From the protein and lipid snapshots of human and rabbit lesions analyzed here, we hypothesize that the pathologic response to TB is shaped by the precise anatomical localization of these inflammatory pathways during the development of the granuloma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28624952>Endocrine functions of the renal interstitium.</a></h2><p>This review aims to summarize the knowledge about the sensor and endocrine response functions of resident interstitial cells of the kidney.

Effects of hydroxides on endothelial cells are unclear, although 5-LOX is known to increase at arteriosclerotic lesions. To investigate the effects of hydroxides on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), the cells were treated with 50 μM each of AA, EPA, 5-HETE, and 5-HEPE. Treatment of HUVECs with 5-HETE and 5-HEPE, rather than with AA and EPA, increased the nuclear translocation of NF-E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) and upregulated the expression of heme oxygenase-1 and cystine/glutamate transporter regulated by Nrf2. Reactive  species (ROS) generation was markedly elevated in HUVECs after treatment with 5-HETE and 5-HEPE, and the pretreatment with α-tocopherol abrogated ROS levels similar to those in the vehicle control. However, ROS generation was independent of Nrf2 activation induced by 5-HETE and 5-HEPE. 5-HETE was converted to 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic  (5-oxo-ETE) in HUVECs, and 5-oxo-ETE increased Nrf2 activation. These results suggest that 5-HETE works as an Nrf2 activator through the metabolite 5-oxo-ETE in HUVECs. Similarly, 5-HEPE works in the same way, because 5-HEPE is metabolized to 5-oxo-eicosapentaenoic  through the same pathway as that for 5-HETE.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30366666>Effects of monoacylglycerol lipase inhibitor URB602 on lung ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice.</a></h2><p>Lung ischemia-reperfusion injury (LIRI) is a common and severe postoperative pathologic complication that often occurs when the  supply disrupted to the lung tissue fallowed by reperfusion period, in most cases after lung transplantation and cardiopulmonary bypass. Endocannabinoids such as 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) have very important role as regulators of inflammation. Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) is the main 2-AG-degrading enzyme, and the downstream metabolites of 2-AG play a role in the inflammation. Ischemia reperfusion (IR) was induced by clamping the left pulmonary hilum for 60 min, followed by 120 min of reperfusion in male C57BL/6 mice. Effects of URB602, a MAGL inhibitor, were evaluated in a preventive or therapeutic regimen (5 min before ischemia or reperfusion, respectively). Oxygenation index, wet-to-dry weight ratio and lung injury score were analyzed. Endocannabinoids including 2-AG, anandamide (AEA) and  (AA) levels, metabolites such as Prostaglandin I (PGI), Thromboxane B (TXB) and Leukotrienes B (LTB) and inflammatory markers (Interleukin 6 (IL-6) andTumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)) in lung tissues were measured by using mass spectrometry or ELISA analyses. We found that IR increased the wet-to-dry weight ratio of lung and lung injury score and decreased oxygenation index as compared to the sham group. Moreover, treatment with URB602 in preventive or therapeutic regimen reduced the wet-to-dry weight ratio and lung injury score while increased oxygenation index when compared with the IR group, with a more improvement in the preventive regimen group. In addition, treatment with URB602 before ischemia increased 2-AG level but decreased metabolites (AA, PGI, TXB, LTB) and inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-α). Thus, our study demonstrated that a pretreatment with URB602 significantly reduced IR-induced lung injury and inflammation. URB602 inhibited LIRI and inflammation by increasing 2-AG level and reducing downstream metabolites from AA to PGI, TXB and LTB in lung tissues.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Age remains the greatest risk factor for Alzheimer's and the prevalence of age-related late onset Alzheimer's is greatest in females. We investigated mechanisms underlying white matter degeneration in an animal model consistent with the sex at greatest Alzheimer's risk. Results of these analyses demonstrated decline in mitochondrial respiration, increased mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide production and cytosolic-phospholipase-A2 sphingomyelinase pathway activation during female brain aging. Electron microscopic and lipidomic analyses confirmed myelin degeneration. An increase in fatty acids and mitochondrial fatty  metabolism machinery was coincident with a rise in brain ketone bodies and decline in plasma ketone bodies. This mechanistic pathway and its chronologically phased activation, links mitochondrial dysfunction early in aging with later age development of white matter degeneration.

(AA) is used for the main precursor for the production of various eicosanoids. However, most terrestrial insects possess relatively low AA levels. Insects are presumed to be evolved since the Paleozoic era, at which  levels might be much higher than current conditions. Compared with other animals, they exhibit relatively high metabolic rates with the well-developed tracheal system, which directly supply enough  to active tissues like flight muscles. This might allow insects to be susceptible to reactive  species (ROS) generated from high oxidative catabolism. Long-chain PUFAs including AA is usually reacted with ROS and become peroxidized. Peroxidized PUFAs cause various cellular damage.

Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase-4 (ACSL4) has been hypothesized to modulate the metabolic fates of polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), including  (AA), but the in vivo actions of ACSL4 are unknown. The purpose of our studies was to determine the in vivo role of adipocyte ACSL4 in regulating obesity-associated adipocyte dysfunction.We developed a novel mouse model with adipocyte-specific ablation of ACSL4 (Ad-KO) using loxP Cre recombinase technology. Metabolic phenotyping of Ad-KO mice relative to their floxed littermates (ACSL4) was performed, including body weight and body composition over time; insulin and glucose tolerance tests; and energy expenditure, activity, and food intake in metabolic cages. Adipocytes were isolated for ex vivo adipocyte  consumption by Clark electrode and lipidomics analysis. In vitro adipocyte analysis including  consumption by Seahorse and real-time PCR analysis were performed to confirm our in vivo findings.Ad-KO mice were protected against DIO, adipocyte death, and metabolic dysfunction. Adipocytes from Ad-KO mice fed high-fat diet (HFD) had reduced incorporation of AA into phospholipids (PL), free AA, and levels of the AA lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). Additionally, adipocytes from Ad-KO mice fed HFD had reduced p53 activation and increased adipocyte  consumption (OCR), which we demonstrated are direct effects of 4-HNE on adipocytes in vitro.These studies are the first to elucidate ACSL4's in vivo actions to regulate the incorporation of AA into PL and downstream effects on DIO-associated adipocyte dysfunction. By reducing the incorporation of AA into PL and free fatty  pools in adipocytes, Ad-KO mice were significantly protected against HFD-induced increases in adipose and liver fat accumulation, adipocyte death, gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT) inflammation, and insulin resistance (IR). Additionally, deficiency of adipocyte ACSL4 expression in mice fed a HFD resulted in increased gWAT adipocyte OCR and whole body energy expenditure (EE).Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

The sablefish ) encounters considerable variations in environmental  availability, and is an interesting model for studying the effects of hypoxia on fish cardiorespiratory function. We investigated how  hypoxic acclimation (6 months at 40%+3 weeks at 20% air saturation) and  anoxia-reoxygenation affected sablefish cardiac mitochondrial respiration and reactive  species (ROS) release rates using high-resolution fluorespirometry. Further, we investigated how hypoxic acclimation affected the sensitivity of mitochondrial respiration to nitric oxide (NO), and compared mitochondrial lipid and fatty  (FA) composition between groups. Hypoxic acclimation did not alter mitochondrial coupled or uncoupled respiration, or respiratory control ratio, ROS release rates, P or superoxide dismutase activity. However, it increased citrate synthase activity (by∼20%), increased the sensitivity of mitochondrial respiration to NO inhibition [i.e., the NO IC was 25% lower], and enhanced the recovery of respiration (by 21%) and reduced ROS release rates (by 25-30%) post-anoxia. Further, hypoxic acclimation altered the mitochondria's FA composition [increasing  (20:4ω6) and eicosapentaenoic  (20:5ω3) proportions by 11 and 14%, respectively], and SIMPER analysis revealed that the phospholipid: sterol ratio was the largest contributor (24%) to the dissimilarity between treatments. Overall, these results suggest that hypoxic acclimation may protect sablefish cardiac bioenergetic function during or after periods of O limitation, and that this may be related to alterations in the mitochondria's sensitivity to NO and to adaptive changes in membrane composition (fluidity).© 2019.

Diels (Umbelliferae) (AS) is a well-known Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) that enriches and regulates the blood.An integrated metabonomic and proteomic method was developed and applied to study the blood enrichment effects and mechanisms of AS on blood deficiency (BD) mouse model.Forty mice were randomly divided into the control, BD, High-dose of AS (ASH), Middle-dose of AS (ASM), and Low-dose of AS (ASL) groups. BD model mice were established by injecting N-acetylphenylhydrazine (APH) and cyclophosphamide (CTX) (ip). The aqueous extract of AS was administered at three dose of 20, 10, or 5 g/kg b. wt. orally for 7 consecutive days before/after APH and CTX administration. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) combined with pattern recognition method and 2D gel electrophoresis (2-DE) proteomics were performed in this study to discover the underlying hematopoietic regulation mechanisms of AS on BD mouse model.Unlike in the control group, the HSP90 and arginase levels increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the BD group, but the levels of carbonic anhydrase, GAPDH, catalase, fibrinogen, GSTP, carboxylesterase and hem binding protein in the BD group decreased significantly (p < 0.05). Unlike the levels in the BD group, the levels of these biomarkers were regulated to a normal state near the control group in the ASM group. Unlike in the control group, l-alanine, , l-valine, octadecanoic , glycine, hexadecanoic , l-threonine, butanoic , malic , l-proline and propanoic  levels increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the BD group, the levels of d-fructose in the BD group decreased significantly (p < 0.05). The relative concentrations of 12 endogenous metabolites were also significantly affected by the ASL, ASM, and ASH treatments. Notably, most of the altered BD-related metabolites were restored to normal state after ASM administration.AS can promote hematopoietic activities, inhibit production of reactive  species, regulate energy metabolism, increase antiapoptosis, and potentially contribute to the blood enrichment effects of AS against APH- and CTX-induced BD mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28427563>Neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's Disease: The Preventive and Therapeutic Potential of Polyphenolic Nutraceuticals.</a></h2><p>Brain inflammation, characterized by increased microglia and astrocyte activation, increases during aging and is a key feature of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD, neuronal death and synaptic impairment, induced by amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, are at least in part mediated by microglia and astrocyte activation. Glial activation results in the sustained production of proinflammatory cytokines and reactive  species, giving rise to a chronic inflammatory process. Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cells in the central nervous system and are involved in the neuroinflammation. Astrocytes can be activated by numerous factors, including free saturated fatty acids, pathogens, lipopolysaccharide, and oxidative stress. Activation of astrocytes produces inflammatory cytokines and the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2, enhancing the production of Aβ. Furthermore, the role of the receptor for advanced glycation end products/nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) axis in neuroinflammation is in line with the nonenzymatic glycosylation theory of aging, suggesting a central role of the advanced glycation end products in the age-related cognitive and a possible role of nutraceuticals in the prevention of neuroinflammation and AD. However, modulation of P-glycoprotein, rather than antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, could be the major mechanism of polyphenolic compounds, including flavonoids. Curcumin, resvertrol, piperine, and other polyphenols have been explored as novel therapeutic and preventive agents for AD. The aim of this review is to critically analyze and discuss the mechanisms involved in neuroinflammation and the possible role of nutraceuticals in the prevention and therapy of AD by targeting neuroinflammation.© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, we explore the effects of angiotensin-(1-7) in a primary cell model of cardiac fibrosis established in angiotensin II-stimulated cardiac fibroblasts via metabolomics analysis and further clarify the potential protective mechanism of angiotensin-(1-7).After exposing cardiac fibroblasts to angiotensin II and/or angiotensin-(1-7), 172 metabolites in these cells were quantified and identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The data were subsequently analyzed by orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis to shortlist biochemically significant metabolites associated with the antifibrotic action of angiotensin-(1-7). Seven significant metabolites were identified: 10,13-dimethyltetradecanoic , , aspartic , docosahexaenoic  (DHA), glutathione, palmitelaidic , and pyroglutamic . By metabolic network analysis, we found that these metabolites were involved in six metabolic pathways, including  metabolism, leukotriene metabolism, and the γ-glutamyl cycle. Since these metabolic pathways are related to calcium balance and oxidative stress, we further verified that angiotensin-(1-7) suppressed the abnormal extracellular calcium influx and excessive accumulation of intracellular reactive  species (ROS) in angiotensin II-stimulated cardiac fibroblasts. Furthermore, we found that angiotensin-(1-7) suppressed the abnormal calcium- and ROS-dependent activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II delta (CaMKIIδ), the increased expression of CaMKIIδ-related proteins (NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4), cellular communication network factor 2 (CTGF), and p-ERK1/2), and excessive collagen deposition in vitro and in vivo.Angiotensin-(1-7) can ameliorate the angiotensin II-stimulated metabolic perturbations associated with cardiac fibroblast activation. These metabolic changes indicate that modulation of calcium- and ROS-dependent activation of CaMKIIδ mediates the activity of angiotensin-(1-7) against cardiac fibrosis. Moreover, pyroglutamic  and  may be potential biomarkers for monitoring the antifibrotic action of angiotensin-(1-7).Copyright © 2019.

Isoprostanes are stable products of  peroxidation and are regarded as the most reliable markers of oxidative stress in vivo. Validation of method was performed by evaluation of the key analytical parameters such as: matrix effect, analytical curve, trueness, precision, limits of detection and limits of quantification. As a homoscedasticity was not met for analytical data, weighted linear regression was applied in order to improve the accuracy at the lower end points of calibration curve. The detection limits (LODs) ranged from 1.0 to 2.1pg/mL. For plasma samples spiked with the isoprostanes at the level of 50pg/mL, intra-and interday repeatability ranged from 2.1 to 3.5% and 0.1 to 5.1%, respectively. The applicability of the proposed approach has been verified by monitoring of isoprostane isomers level in plasma samples collected from young patients (n=8) subjected to hyperbaric hyperoxia (100%  at 280kPa(a) for 30min) in a multiplace hyperbaric chamber.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that Arg-513 and Leu-531 contribute to the structural mechanisms of COX inhibition. We used mutagenesis and functional analyses to characterize how substitutions at these positions influence time-dependent inhibition by aspirin and Celebrex. We show that substitutions of Leu-531 with asparagine and phenylalanine significantly attenuate time-dependent inhibition of COX-2 by these drugs. The introduction of side chain bulk, rigidity, and charge would disrupt the formation of the initial noncovalent complex, in the case of aspirin, and the "high-affinity" binding state, in the case of Celebrex. Substitution of Arg-513 with histidine (the equivalent residue in COX-1) resulted in a 2-fold potentiation of aspirin inhibition, in support of the hypothesis that the presence of histidine in COX-1 lowers the activation barrier associated with the formation of the initial noncovalent enzyme-inhibitor complex. As a corollary, we previously hypothesized that the flexibility associated with Leu-531 contributes to the binding of  (AA) to acetylated COX-2 to generate 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (15R-HETE). We determined the X-ray crystal structure of AA bound to Co-protoporphyrin IX-reconstituted V349I murine COX-2 (muCOX-2). V349I muCOX-2 was utilized as a surrogate to trap AA in a conformation leading to 15R-HETE. AA binds in a C-shaped pose, facilitated by the rotation of the Leu-531 side chain. Ile-349 is positioned to sterically shield antarafacial oxygen addition at carbon-15 in a manner similar to that proposed for the acetylated Ser-530 side chain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29926309>Role of prostaglandins in tumor microenvironment.</a></h2><p>Tumor tissue is composed of tumor cells and surrounding non-tumor endothelial and immune cells, collectively known as the tumor microenvironment. Tumor cells manipulate tumor microenvironment to obtain sufficient  and nutrient supply, and evade anti-tumor immunosurveillance. Various types of signaling molecules, including cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and lipid mediators, are secreted, which co-operate to make up the complex tumor microenvironment. Prostaglandins, cyclooxygenase metabolites of , are abundantly produced in tumor tissues. Ever since treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed anti-tumor effect in mouse models and human patients by inhibiting whole prostaglandin production, investigators have focused on the importance of prostaglandins in tumor malignancies. However, most studies that followed focused on the role of an eminent prostaglandin, prostaglandin E, in tumor onset, growth, and metastasis. It remained unclear how other prostaglandin species affected tumor malignancies. Recently, we identified prostaglandin D, a well-known sleep-inducing prostaglandin, as a factor with strong anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor properties, in genetically modified mice. In this review, we summarize recent studies focusing on the importance of prostaglandins and their metabolites in the tumor microenvironment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30159798>Inhibitions of anandamide transport and FAAH synthesis decrease apoptosis and oxidative stress through inhibition of TRPV1 channel in an in vitro seizure model.</a></h2><p>The expression level of TRPV1 is high in hippocampus which is a main epileptic area in the brain. In addition to the actions of capsaicin (CAP) and reactive  species (ROS), the TRPV1 channel is activated in neurons by endogenous cannabinoid, anandamide (AEA). In the current study, we investigated the role of inhibitors of TRPV1 (capsazepine, CPZ), AEA transport (AM404), and FAAH (URB597) on the modulation of Ca entry, apoptosis, and oxidative stress in in vitro seizure-induced rat hippocampus and human glioblastoma (DBTRG) cell line. The seizure was induced in the hippocampal and DBTRG neurons using in vitro 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) to trigger a seizure-like activity model. CPZ and AM404 were fully effective in reversing 4-AP-induced intracellular free Ca concentration of the hippocampus and TRPV1 current density of DBTRG. However, AEA and CAP did not activate TRPV1 in the URB597-treated neurons. Hence, we observed TRPV1 blocker effects of URB597 in the DBTRG neurons. In addition, the AM404 and CPZ treatments decreased intracellular ROS production, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, apoptosis, caspases 3 and 9 values in the hippocampus. In conclusion, the results indicate that inhibition of AEA transport, FAAH synthesis, and TRPV1 activity can result in remarkable neuroprotective effects in the epileptic neurons. Possible molecular pathways of involvement of capsazepine (CPZ) and AM4040 in anandamide and capsaicin (CAP)-induced apoptosis, oxidative stress, and Ca accumulation through TRPV1 channel in the seizure-induced rat hippocampus and human glioblastoma neurons. The TRPV1 channel is activated by different stimuli including reactive  species (ROS), anandamide (AEA), and CAP and it is blocked by capsazepine (CPZ). Cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) is also activated by AEA. The AEA levels in cytosol are decreased by fatty  amide hydrolase (FAAH) enzyme. Inhibition of FAAH through URB597 induces stimulation of CB1 receptor through accumulation AEA. URB597 acts antiepileptic effects through inhibition of TRPV1. Overloaded Ca concentration of mitochondria can induce an apoptotic program by stimulating the release of apoptosis-promoting factors such as caspases 3 and caspase 9 by generating ROS due to respiratory chain damage. AM404 and CPZ reduce TRPV1 channel activation and Ca entry in the in vitro 4-AP seizure model-induced hippocampal and glioblastoma neurons.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27798344>Obese Mice Fed a Diet Supplemented with Enzyme-Treated Wheat Bran Display Marked Shifts in the Liver Metabolome Concurrent with Altered Gut Bacteria.</a></h2><p>Enzyme-treated wheat bran (ETWB) contains a fermentable dietary fiber previously shown to decrease liver triglycerides (TGs) and modify the gut microbiome in mice. It is not clear which mechanisms explain how ETWB feeding affects hepatic metabolism, but factors (i.e., xenometabolites) associated with specific microbes may be involved.The objective of this study was to characterize ETWB-driven shifts in the cecal microbiome and to identify correlates between microbial changes and diet-related differences in liver metabolism in diet-induced obese mice that typically display steatosis.Five-week-old male C57BL/6J mice fed a 45%-lard-based fat diet supplemented with ETWB (20% wt:wt) or rapidly digestible starch (control) (n = 15/group) for 10 wk were characterized by using a multi-omics approach. Multivariate statistical analysis was used to identify variables that were strong discriminators between the ETWB and control groups.Body weight and liver TGs were decreased by ETWB feeding (by 10% and 25%, respectively; P < 0.001), and an index of liver reactive  species was increased (by 29%; P < 0.01). The cecal microbiome showed an increase in Bacteroidetes (by 42%; P < 0.05) and a decrease in Firmicutes (by 16%; P < 0.05). Metabolites that were strong discriminators between the ETWB and control groups included decreased liver antioxidants (glutathione and α-tocopherol); decreased liver carbohydrate metabolites, including glucose; lower hepatic ; and increased liver and plasma β-hydroxybutyrate. Liver transcriptomics revealed key metabolic pathways affected by ETWB, especially those related to lipid metabolism and some fed- or fasting-regulated genes.Together, these changes indicate that dietary fibers such as ETWB regulate hepatic metabolism concurrently with specific gut bacteria community shifts in C57BL/6J mice. It is proposed that these changes may elicit gut-derived signals that reach the liver via enterohepatic circulation, ultimately affecting host liver metabolism in a manner that mimics, in part, the fasting state.© 2016 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28404744>The role of CB in intestinal permeability and inflammation.</a></h2><p>The endocannabinoid system has previously been shown to play a role in the permeability and inflammatory response of the human gut. The goal of our study was to determine the effects of endogenous anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) on the permeability and inflammatory response of intestinal epithelium under normal, inflammatory, and hypoxic conditions. Human intestinal mucosa was modeled using Caco-2 cells. Human tissue was collected from planned colorectal resections. Accumulation of AEA and 2-AG was achieved by inhibiting their metabolizing enzymes URB597 (a fatty  amide hydrolase inhibitor) and JZL184 (a monoacylglycerol lipase inhibitor). Inflammation and ischemia were simulated with TNF-α and IFN-γ and  deprivation. Permeability changes were measured by transepithelial electrical resistance. The role of the CB receptor was explored using CB-knockdown (CBKd) intestinal epithelial cells. Endocannabinoid levels were measured using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Cytokine secretion was measured using multiplex and ELISA. URB597 and JZL184 caused a concentration-dependent increase in permeability  CB ( < 0.0001) and decreased cytokine production. Basolateral application of JZL184 decreased permeability  CB ( < 0.0001). URB597 and JZL184 increased the enhanced (worsened) permeability caused by inflammation and hypoxia ( < 0.0001 and  < 0.05). CBKd cells showed reduced permeability response to inflammation ( < 0.01) but not hypoxia. 2-AG levels were increased in response to inflammation and hypoxia in Caco-2 cells. In human mucosal tissue, inflammation increased the secretion of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, IL-12, -13, and -15, which was prevented with  treatment with URB597 and JZL184, and was inhibited by a CB antagonist. The results of this study show that endogenous AEA and 2-AG production and CB activation play a key modulatory roles in normal intestinal mucosa permeability and in inflammatory and hypoxic conditions.-Karwad, M.

Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and  glucose deprivation (OGD) were established in SD rats and PC12 cells to mimic ischemic injury. In vivo, edaravone can significantly reduce neurological deficit scores, infarct volume, ROS level and expression of 5-LOX. For in vitro experiment, reduced viability, cell death which occurred via necrosis and apoptosis were shown after OGD and even severer in OGD-reperfusion (OGD-R). Interestingly, edaravone (0.01, 0.1, 1 μmol/L) and caffeic  (5-LOX inhibitor) can dramatically attenuate OGD/OGD-R injuries. Profoundly, mitochondrial transmembrane potential was ameliorated and cristae membranes (detected by electron microscope) were swollen in OGD/OGD-R cells; however, edaravone preserved the normal ultrastructure of mitochondria and reduced ROS. Astonishingly, immunohistochemistry analyses showed that 5-LOX was first located in the cytosol, dendrites and nuclei of control cells and then translocated to the nuclear membrane after OGD/OGD-R, which indicated the activation of 5-LOX pathway. Edaravone and caffeic  can inhibit 5-LOX translocation to the nuclear membrane after OGD/OGD-R and reduce cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs), which are metabolites of 5-LOX. Our results are the first to indicate that the protective action of edaravone may function, at least in part, by inhibiting 5-LOX activation, maintaining the ultrastructure and integrated function of mitochondria, thus protecting neuronal cells from ischemia. Furthermore, the instability of mitochondria may be another critical factor in 5-LOX activation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, a new class of  (AA) analogues was synthesized and evaluated for their ability to inhibit cPLA. Several compounds were found to inhibit cPLA more strongly than arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF), an inhibitor that is commonly used in the study of cPLA-related neurodegenerative diseases.

A Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics Free Energy Simulation.</a></h2><p>Lipoxygenases (LOXs) are a family of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of several lipid mediators. In the case of human 15-LOX, the 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2 isoforms show slightly different reaction regiospecificity and substrate specificity, indicating that substrate binding and recognition may be different, a fact that could be related to their different biological role. Here, we have used long molecular dynamics simulations, QM(DFT)/MM potential energy and free energy calculations (using the newly developed DHAM method), to investigate the binding mode of the  (AA) substrate into 15-LOX-2 and the rate-limiting hydrogen-abstraction reaction 15-LOX-2 catalyzes. Our results strongly indicate that hydrogen abstraction from C13 in 15-LOX-2 is only consistent with the "tail-first" orientation of AA, with its carboxylate group interacting with Arg429, and that only the pro-S H13 hydrogen will be abstracted (being the pro-R H13 and H10 too far from the acceptor  atom). At the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level the potential and free energy barriers for the pro-S H13 abstraction of AA by 15-LOX-2 are 18.0 and 18.6 kcal/mol, respectively. To analyze the kinetics of the hydrogen abstraction process, we determined a Markov model corresponding to the unbiased simulations along the state-discretized reaction coordinate. The calculated rates based on the second largest eigenvalue of the Markov matrices agree well with experimental measurements, and also provide the means to directly determine the pre-exponential factor for the reaction by comparing with the free energy barrier height. Our calculated pre-exponential factor is close to the value of kBT/h. On the other hand, our results suggest that the spin inversion of the complete system (including the O2 molecule) that is required to happen at some point along the full process to lead to the final hydroperoxide product, is likely to take place during the hydrogen transfer, which is a proton coupled electron transfer. Overall, a different binding mode from the one accepted for 15-LOX-1 is proposed, which provides a molecular basis for 15-LOX-2 exclusive 15-HPETE production in front of the double (although highly 15-) 12/15 regiospecificity of 15-LOX-1. Understanding how these different isoenzymes achieve their regiospecificity is expected to help in specific inhibitor design.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28923362>Human retinal endothelial cells and astrocytes cultured on 3-D scaffolds for ocular drug discovery and development.</a></h2><p>Topical ocular ketorolac improves the outcomes of severe retinopathy of prematurity and when administered with systemic caffeine, decreases the severity of -induced retinopathy. We tested the hypothesis that co-cultures of human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) and human retinal astrocytes (HRAs) on 3-dimensional (3-D) hydrogel scaffolds is a more representative biomimetic paradigm of the blood-retinal-barrier (BRB) than 2-D cultures, and should be utilized for preclinical drug discovery and development. Mono- and co-cultures of HRECs and HRAs were treated with standard doses of ketorolac, ibuprofen, and/or caffeine, and exposed to hyperoxia, intermittent hypoxia (IH), or normoxia on 2-D surfaces or 3-D biodegradable hydrogel scaffolds (AlgiMatrix or Geltrex). Media and cells were collected at 72h post treatment for  metabolites. Cells cultured on 3-D scaffolds exhibited less oxidative stress and variability in drug responses. HRAs enhanced the responses of HRECs to drugs and changes in  environment. PGE and PGI were the predominant prostanoids produced in response to IH, reflecting COX-2 immunoreactivity. We conclude that HRECs and HRAs co-cultured on 3-D scaffolds may recapitulate drug responses of the dynamic BRB and therefore should be implemented for preclinical ocular drug discovery and development.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29081082>Epoxyeicosatrienoic  Inhibits the Apoptosis of Cerebral Microvascular Smooth Muscle Cells by  Glucose Deprivation via Targeting the JNK/c-Jun and mTOR Signaling Pathways.</a></h2><p>As a component of the neurovascular unit, cerebral smooth muscle cells (CSMCs) are an important mediator in the development of cerebral vascular diseases such as stroke. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are the products of  catalyzed by cytochrome P450 epoxygenase. EETs are shown to exert neuroprotective effects. In this article, the role of EET in the growth and apoptosis of CSMCs and the underlying mechanisms under  glucose deprivation (OGD) conditions were addressed. The viability of CMSCs was decreased significantly in the OGD group, while different subtypes of EETs, especially 14,15-EET, could increase the viability of CSMCs under OGD conditions. RAPA (serine/threonine kinase Mammalian Target of Rapamycin), a specific mTOR inhibitor, could elevate the level of  free radicals in CSMCs as well as the anti-apoptotic effects of 14,15-EET under OGD conditions. However, SP600125, a specific JNK (c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase) pathway inhibitor, could attenuate  free radicals levels in CSMCs as well as the anti-apoptotic effects of 14,15-EET under OGD conditions. These results strongly suggest that EETs exert protective functions during the growth and apoptosis of CSMCs, via the JNK/c-Jun and mTOR signaling pathways in vitro.

This is achieved by a multiprotein complex, the so-called NADPH oxidase. The activity of phagocyte NADPH oxidase relies on an assembly of more than five proteins, among them the membrane heterodimer named flavocytochrome b  (Cytb ), constituted by the tight association of the gp91 (also named Nox2)﻿ and p22 proteins. The Cytb  is the membrane catalytic core of the NADPH oxidase complex, through which the reducing equivalent provided by NADPH is transferred via the associated prosthetic groups (one flavin and two hemes) to reduce dioxygen into superoxide anion. The other major proteins (p47, p67, p40, Rac) requisite for the complex activity are cytosolic proteins. Thus, the NADPH oxidase functioning relies on a synergic multi-partner assembly that in vivo can be hardly studied at the molecular level due to the cell complexity. Thus, a cell-free assay method has been developed to study the NADPH oxidase activity that allows measuring and eventually quantifying the ROS generation based on optical techniques following reduction of cytochrome c. This setup is a valuable tool for the identification of protein interactions, of crucial components and additives for a functional enzyme. Recently, this method was improved by the engineering and the production of a complete recombinant NADPH oxidase complex using the combination of purified proteins expressed in bacterial and yeast host cells. The reconstitution into artificial membrane leads to a fully controllable system that permits fine functional studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30085423>Evaluation of antioxidant activity of extracts from the roots and shoots of Scutellaria alpina L. and S. altissima L. in selected blood cells.</a></h2><p>It is widely known that reactive  species (ROS) can cause oxidative damage in cells and have been linked to the pathogenesis of oxidative diseases, such as atherosclerosis, ischemia, neurodegenerative disease, diabetes, or cancer. Recently, much attention has been focused on preventive strategies for oxidative stress and related diseases. Plants represent a source of bioactive compounds whose antioxidant activity may be useful in protecting against pro-oxidative reactions.The study determines the in vitro biological activity of the ethanolic extracts from the shoots and roots of Scutellaria species (S. altissima and S. alpina) in selected blood cells (blood platelets and lymphocytes).Platelet activity, both resting and after thrombin stimulation, was used to indicate the ability of the plant extracts to inhibit the production of superoxide anion radicals (O2 •-) and platelet lipid peroxidation. The generation of superoxide anion radicals was measured by cytochrome c reduction. Lipid peroxidation in blood platelets was measured by the level of thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS). The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetric assay was used to determine the protective effect of Scutellaria extracts on lymphocyte cells against oxidative damage induced by hydroxyl radicals.Extracts (5-50 μg/mL) containing phenolic compounds from both Scutellaria species distinctly reduced nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation and  metabolism by blood platelets in vitro. When given at the tested concentration, the extracts reduced the generation of O2 •- in resting blood platelets and platelets activated by thrombin in vitro. All Scutellaria extracts (10 μg/mL) containing phenolic compounds also protected human lymphocytes against oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).The present study suggests that the natural extracts from S. altissima and S. alpina have antioxidant properties and, therefore, may be beneficial in the prevention of diseases in which blood platelets and lymphocytes are involved, i.e., cancer or inflammatory and infective diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31496224>Mass Spectrometry Characterization of Thiol Conjugates Linked to Polyoxygenated Polyunsaturated Fatty  Species.</a></h2><p>Radical mediated oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is known to generate a series of polyoxygenated cyclic products (PUFA-O,  ≥ 3). Here, we describe the characterization of glutathione (GSH) conjugates bound to polyoxygenated docosahexaenoic (DHA-O,  = 3-9),  (ARA-O,  = 3-7), α-linolenic (ALA-O), and linoleic (LA-O)  species. Similar conjugates were also characterized for -acetylcysteine (NAC) and Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1). Extensive LC-MS/MS characterization using a synthetic α-linolenic hydroxy-endoperoxide (ALA-O) derivative revealed at least two types of mechanisms leading to thiol adduction: a mechanism involving the nucleophilic attack by thiolate anion on 1,2-dioxolane to form a sulfenate ester-bonded conjugate and a mechanism involving cleavage of the dioxolane to form a α,β-unsaturated carbonyl followed by the Michael addition reaction. Finally, we detected a GSH conjugate with hydroxy-endoperoxide derived from linoleic  (LA-O) in mice liver. In summary, our study reveals the formation of a series of thiol conjugates that are bound to highly oxygenated PUFA species. GSH conjugates described in our study may potentially play relevant roles in redox and inflammatory processes, especially under high oxygen tension conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28181396>The aflatoxin B -fumonisin B toxicity in BRL-3A hepatocytes is associated to induction of cytochrome P450 activity and  metabolism.</a></h2><p>Human oral exposure to aflatoxin B (AFB ) and fumonisin B (FB ) is associated with increased hepatocellular carcinoma. Although evidence suggested interactive AFB -FB hepatotoxicity, the underlying mechanisms remain mostly unidentified. This work was aimed at evaluating the possible AFB -FB interplay to induce genetic and cell cycle toxicities in BRL-3A rat hepatocytes, reactive  species (ROS) involvement, and the AFB metabolizing pathways cytochrome P450 (CYP) and  (ArAc) metabolism as ROS contributors. Flow cytometry of stained BRL-3A hepatocytes was used to study the cell cycle (propidium iodide), ROS intracellular production (DCFH-DA, HE, DAF-2 DA), and phospholipase A activity (staining with bis-BODIPY FL C11-PC). The CYP1A activity was assessed by the 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) assay. Despite a 48-h exposure to FB (30 μM) not being genotoxic, the AFB (20 μM)-induced micronucleus frequency was overcome by the AFB -FB mixture (MIX), presumably showing toxin interaction. The mycotoxins blocked G1/S-phase, but only MIX caused cell death. Overall, the oxidative stress led these alterations as the pretreatment with N-acetyl-l-cysteine reduced such toxic effects. While AFB had a major input to the MIX pro-oxidant activity, with CYP and ArAc metabolism being ROS contributors, these pathways were not involved in the FB -elicited weak oxidative stress. The MIX-induced micronucleus frequency in N-acetyl-l-cysteine pretreated cells was greater than that caused by AFB without antioxidants, suggesting enhanced AFB direct genotoxicity probably owing to the higher CYP activity and ArAc metabolism found in MIX. The metabolic pathways modulation by AFB -FB mixtures could raise its hepatocarcinogenic properties.© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28460604>The 15-LO-1/15-HETE system promotes angiogenesis by upregulating VEGF in ischemic brains.</a></h2><p>Angiogenesis promotes neurobehavioral recovery after cerebral ischemic stroke. 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (15-HETE) is one of the major metabolites of  by 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO) and stimulates the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thus, inducing autocrine-mediated angiogenesis. The present study aimed to investigate the role of 15-LO/15-HETE system on VEGF expression and angiogenesis in brain ischemia.Rat cerebral arterial vascular endothelial cells were used to set up a cell injury model of -glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R), mimicking a condition of brain ischemia. A mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was established.-glucose deprivation increased cellular expression of 15-LO-1 and VEGF. Transfection of 15-LO-1 siRNA depleted cells of 15-LO-1, and sequentially induced downregulation of VEGF expression; while, incubation of 15-HETE increased the expression of VEGF. Incubation of 15-HETE attenuated the reduction in cell viability induced by -glucose deprivation, and promoted cell migration, while transfection of 15-LO-1 siRNA showed an opposite effect. In animal experiments, the density of microvessels in hypoxic regions of brains was significantly increased after MCAO, while intracerebroventricular delivery of 15-LO-1 siRNA significantly reduced the density of microvessels, and downregulates VEGF expression.The results indicate that the 15-LO-1/15-HETE system promotes angiogenesis in ischemic brains by upregulation of VEGF, representing a potential target for improving neurobehavioral recovery after cerebral ischemic stroke.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28828587>Tryptanthrin prevents oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis through AMP-activated protein kinase-dependent p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation.</a></h2><p>Tryptanthrin (6,12-dihydro-6,12-dioxoindolo-(2,1-b)-quinazoline) has been reported to have a variety of pharmacological activities. Present study investigated the cytoprotective effects of tryptanthrin on  (AA) + iron-mediated oxidative stress and the molecular mechanisms responsible. In HepG2 cells, pretreatment with tryptanthrin inhibited the cytotoxic effect of AA + iron in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, tryptanthrin prevented the changes in the levels of apoptosis-related proteins, and attenuated reactive  species production, glutathione depletion, and mitochondrial membrane impairment induced by AA + iron. Mechanistic investigations showed that tryptanthrin increased the phosphorylations of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38). Furthermore, inhibition of AMPK or p38 reduced the ability of tryptanthrin to prevent AA + iron-induced cell death and mitochondrial dysfunction. Transfection experiments using AMPK mutants indicated that p38 phosphorylation by tryptanthrin was dependent on AMPK activation. In a phenylhydrazine-induced acute liver injury model, tryptanthrin decreased serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and bilirubin in mice. Additionally, tryptanthrin reduced numbers of degenerating hepatocytes, infiltrating inflammatory cells, 4-hydroxynonenal-, and nitrotyrosine-positive cells in hepatic tissues. Thus, these results suggest tryptanthrin has therapeutic potential to protect cells from oxidative injury via AMPK-dependent p38 activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29250064>P17, an Original Host Defense Peptide from Ant Venom, Promotes Antifungal Activities of Macrophages through the Induction of C-Type Lectin Receptors Dependent on LTB4-Mediated PPARγ Activation.</a></h2><p>Despite the growing knowledge with regard to the immunomodulatory properties of host defense peptides, their impact on macrophage differentiation and on its associated microbicidal functions is still poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that the P17, a new cationic antimicrobial peptide from ant venom, induces an alternative phenotype of human monocyte-derived macrophages (h-MDMs). This phenotype is characterized by a C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) signature composed of mannose receptor (MR) and Dectin-1 expression. Concomitantly, this activation is associated to an inflammatory profile characterized by reactive  species (ROS), interleukin (IL)-1β, and TNF-α release. P17-activated h-MDMs exhibit an improved capacity to recognize and to engulf  through the overexpression both of MR and Dectin-1. This upregulation requires  (AA) mobilization and the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) nuclear receptor through the leukotriene B4 (LTB4) production. AA/LTB4/PPARγ/Dectin-1-MR signaling pathway is crucial for P17-mediated anti-fungal activity of h-MDMs, as indicated by the fact that the activation of this axis by P17 triggered ROS production and inflammasome-dependent IL-1β release. Moreover, we showed that the increased anti-fungal immune response of h-MDMs by P17 was dependent on intracellular calcium mobilization triggered by the interaction of P17 with pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein-coupled receptors on h-MDMs. Finally, we also demonstrated that P17-treated mice infected with  develop less severe gastrointestinal infection related to a higher efficiency of their macrophages to engulf , to produce ROS and IL-1β and to kill the yeasts. Altogether, these results identify P17 as an original activator of the fungicidal response of macrophages that acts upstream PPARγ/CLRs axis and offer new immunomodulatory therapeutic perspectives in the field of infectious diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27117607>The status of diabetic embryopathy.</a></h2><p>Diabetic embryopathy is a theoretical enigma and a clinical challenge.

In homeostasis, neutrophils are inactivated by apoptosis, and non phlogistically removed by neighboring macrophages in a process known as efferocytosis, which promotes the resolution of inflammation. The present study assessed the potential anti-inflammatory and pro-resolution benefits of tylvalosin, a recently developed broad-spectrum veterinary macrolide derived from tylosin. Recent findings indicate that tylvalosin may modulate inflammation by suppressing NF-κB activation. Neutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages were isolated from fresh blood samples obtained from 12- to 22-week-old pigs. Leukocytes exposed to vehicle or to tylvalosin (0.1, 1.0, or 10 µg/mL; 0.096-9.6 µM) were assessed at various time points for apoptosis, necrosis, efferocytosis, and changes in the production of cytokines and lipid mediators. The findings indicate that tylvalosin increases porcine neutrophil and macrophage apoptosis in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, without altering levels of necrosis or reactive  species production. Importantly, tylvalosin increased the release of pro-resolving Lipoxin A (LXA) and Resolvin D1 (RvD  ) while inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory Leukotriene B4 (LTB) in Ca ionophore-stimulated porcine neutrophils. Tylvalosin increased neutrophil phospholipase C activity, an enzyme involved in releasing  from membrane stores. Tylvalosin also inhibited pro-inflammatory chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 8 (CXCL-8, also known as Interleukin-8) and interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1α) protein secretion in bacterial lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages. Together, these data illustrate that tylvalosin has potent immunomodulatory effects in porcine leukocytes in addition to its antimicrobial properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27650501>Polarization of Macrophages toward M2 Phenotype Is Favored by Reduction in iPLA2β (Group VIA Phospholipase A2).</a></h2><p>Macrophages are important in innate and adaptive immunity. Macrophage participation in inflammation or tissue repair is directed by various extracellular signals and mediated by multiple intracellular pathways. Activation of group VIA phospholipase A (iPLAβ) causes accumulation of , lysophospholipids, and eicosanoids that can promote inflammation and pathologic states. We examined the role of iPLAβ in peritoneal macrophage immune function by comparing wild type (WT) and iPLAβ mouse macrophages. Compared with WT, iPLAβ macrophages exhibited reduced proinflammatory M1 markers when classically activated. In contrast, anti-inflammatory M2 markers were elevated under naïve conditions and induced to higher levels by alternative activation in iPLAβ macrophages compared with WT. Induction of eicosanoid (12-lipoxygenase (12-LO) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2))- and reactive  species (NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4))-generating enzymes by classical activation pathways was also blunted in iPLAβ macrophages compared with WT. The effects of inhibitors of iPLAβ, COX2, or 12-LO to reduce M1 polarization were greater than those to enhance M2 polarization. Certain lipids (lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidic , and prostaglandin E) recapitulated M1 phenotype in iPLAβ macrophages, but none tested promoted M2 phenotype. These findings suggest that (a) lipids generated by iPLAβ and subsequently oxidized by cyclooxygenase and 12-LO favor macrophage inflammatory M1 polarization, and (b) the absence of iPLAβ promotes macrophage M2 polarization. Reducing macrophage iPLAβ activity and thereby attenuating macrophage M1 polarization might cause a shift from an inflammatory to a recovery/repair milieu.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31316721>Proresolving Lipid Mediators: Endogenous Modulators of Oxidative Stress.</a></h2><p>Specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs) are a novel class of endogenous lipids, derived by -6 and -3 essential polyunsaturated fatty acids such as  (AA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA), and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) that trigger and orchestrate the resolution of inflammation, which is the series of cellular and molecular events that leads to spontaneous regression of inflammatory processes and restoring of tissue homeostasis. These lipids are emerging as highly effective therapeutic agents that exert their immunoregulatory activity by activating the proresolving pathway, as reported by a consistent bulk of evidences gathered in the last two decades since their discovery. The production of reactive  (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS) species by immune cells plays indeed an important role in the inflammatory mechanisms of host defence, and it is now clear that oxidative stress, viewed as an imbalance between such species and their elimination, can lead to many chronic inflammatory diseases. This review, the first of its kind, is aimed at exploring the manifold effects of SPMs on modulation of reactive species production, along with the mechanisms through which they either inhibit molecular signalling pathways that are activated by oxidative stress or induce the expression of endogenous antioxidant systems. Furthermore, the possible role of SPMs in oxidative stress-mediated chronic disorders is also summarized, suggesting not only that their anti-inflammatory and proresolving properties are strictly associated with their antioxidant role but also that these endogenous lipids might be exploited in the treatment of several pathologies in which uncontrolled production of ROS and RNS or impairment of the antioxidant machinery represents a main pathogenetic mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31045470> Extract and Its Major Constituents Inhibit Oxidative Stress-Induced Liver Injury.</a></h2><p>The fruits, leaves, and roots of  have been reported to contain large amounts of vitamin B, vitamin C, and flavonoids. They exhibit various physiological activities such as antitumor and anti-inflammatory effects. However, the hepatoprotective effects of  extracts against oxidative stress-mediated liver injury have not yet been investigated. We thus examined whether  leaf extracts (CTEs) protect against oxidative stress-mediated liver injury  and  and elucidated the underlying mechanism. The cytoprotective effects of CTE through the NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/antioxidant response element (ARE) activation were presented and measured by biochemical analysis in HepG2 cells. To assess the protective effects of CTE , mice were administered with CTE (250 and 500 mg/kg; 5 days; p.o.) before a single dose of acetaminophen (APAP) (300 mg/kg; 24 h; i.p.). CTE increased ARE luciferase activity when compared with extracts of other parts of  CTE upregulated nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and its target gene expression. In addition, CTE inhibited the generation of reactive  species (ROS) and cell death induced by  (AA) and iron (Fe) treatment in primary hepatocytes or HepG2 cells. The cytoprotective effects of CTE against oxidative stress might be due to kaempferol, the major flavonoid present in CTE. Kaempferol pretreatment blocked AA+Fe-induced ROS production and reversed glutathione depletion, which in turn led to decreased cell death. Furthermore, the protective effects of CTE against liver injury induced by excess APAP in mice or primary hepatocytes were observed. CTE could be a promising therapeutic candidate against oxidative stress-induced liver injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27651806>Synthesis and evaluation of LOX inhibitory activity of 2-(1,3-Dioxo-1H-benzo[de]isoquinolin-2(3H)-yl)-N-phenylacetamide derivatives.</a></h2><p>A family of structurally related LOX enzymes present in human cells which catalyse the metabolism of released  from phospholipids by inflammatory stimuli, to biologically active mediators.

Hence, in this research, we focused on the synthesis of naphthalimide analogs as potential 15-LOX-1 inhibitors. Fortunately, the most of synthesized compounds demonstrated remarkable inhibitory potency towards 15-LOX-1 in nanomolar ranges.

In spermatoid cells and/or in the male reproductive system both enzymes are apparently expressed, and GPX4 serves as anti-oxidative enzyme but also as a structural protein. In this study we explored whether germ line inactivation of the Alox15 gene might rescue male subfertility induced by heterozygous expression of catalytically silent Gpx4. To address this question we employed Gpx4 knock-in mice expressing the Sec46Ala-Gpx4 mutant, in which the catalytic selenocysteine was replaced by a redox inactive alanine. Because homozygous Gpx4 knock-in mice (Sec46Ala-Gpx4) are not viable we created heterozygous animals (Sec46Ala-Gpx4) and crossed them with Alox15 knock-out mice (Alox15). Male Sec46Ala-Gpx4 mice, but not their female littermates, were subfertile. Sperm extracted from the epididymal cauda showed strongly impaired motility characteristics and severe structural midpiece alterations (swollen mitochondria, intramitochondrial vacuoles, disordered mitochondrial capsule). Despite these structural alterations, they exhibited similar respiration characteristics than wild-type sperm. When Sec46Ala-Gpx4 mice were crossed with Alox15-deficient animals, the resulting males (Sec46Ala-Gpx4+Alox15) showed normalized fertility, and sperm motility was reimproved to wild-type levels. Taken together these data suggest that systemic inactivation of the Alox15 gene normalizes the reduced fertility of male Sec46Ala-Gpx4 mice by improving the motility of their sperm. If these data can be confirmed in humans, ALOX15 inhibitors might counteract male infertility related to GPX4 deficiency.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28403941>Obesity is positively associated with -derived 5- and 11-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (HETE).</a></h2><p>Oxylipids are oxygenated polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) metabolites that are responsible for the onset and resolution of the inflammatory response. Enzymatic oxygenation through the lipoxygenase (LOX) or cytochrome P450 (CYP) pathways can form oxylipids that have either proinflammatory or proresolving functions depending on the type of PUFA substrate and degree of metabolism. The objective of this study was to determine how PUFA substrates and their corresponding oxylipids are associated with obesity.Plasma non-esterified FA and oxylipids were isolated from 123 Caucasian males using solid phase extraction and quantified using high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Statistical analyses included linear regressions and polytomous logistic regressions, and the responses were body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC), and serum leptin, total adiponectin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and C-peptide. Models were adjusted for age and smoking, and p-values were corrected for false discovery per Benjamini-Hochberg and Bonferroni.We report that BMI, WC, and several serum cytokines were highly associated  (ARA)-derived hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), and vicinal diols (i.e., alcohols on adjacent carbon atoms) derived from several PUFAs. There was a significant linear relationship between BMI, WC, and serum leptin, and ARA-derived 5-, 11-, and 15-HETE. Specifically, BMI and WC were positively associated with proinflammatory 5- and 11-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (HETE), even after normalization to ARA concentrations and false discovery p-value correction. Individuals with 5-HETE concentrations >5.01nmol/L or 11-HETE concentrations and >0.89nmol/L were over 5 times more likely to be obese compared to those with ≤1.86nmol/L and ≤0.39nmol/L, respectively. Vicinal diols from linoleic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic  were inversely associated with obesity. Across all statistical tests, vicinal diols were inversely associated with obesity whether normalized to parent PUFA concentrations or normalized to precursor epoxides. Interestingly, the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α were not associated with any oxylipids. Since 5-HETE is a 5LOX product, 11-HETE is marker of lipid peroxidation, and vicinal diols are formed through soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) metabolism of CYP epoxygenated PUFAs, therefore, these results indicate that obesity is likely associated with altered metabolism with distinct oxygenating pathways. Taken together, our results indicate that obesity is associated with specific oxylipids indicative of altered PUFA metabolism through several pathways (i.e., LOX, reactive  species, and sEH and CYP epoxygenase), rather than attributed solely to altered dietary PUFA intake.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In the past decade, increasing attention has been paid to understand the association between n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) and ALD. In this review, we summarize the metabolism of n-3 PUFAs, animal model of ALD, and the findings from recent studies determining the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD as a possible treatment. The animal models of acute ethanol exposure, chronic ethanol exposure and chronic-plus-single binge ethanol feeding have been widely used to explore the impact of n-3 PUFAs. Although the results of studies regarding the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD have been inconsistent or controversial, increasing evidence has demonstrated that n-3 PUFAs may be useful in alleviating alcoholic steatosis and alcohol-induced liver injury through multiple mechanisms, including decreased  lipogenesis and lipid mobilization from adipose tissue, enhanced mitochondrial fatty  β-oxidation, reduced hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress, and promoted intestinal homeostasis, positively suggesting that n-3 PUFAs might be promising for the management of ALD. The oxidation of n-3 PUFAs  in an experimental diet was rarely considered in most n-3 PUFA-related studies, likely contributing to the inconsistent results. Thus, the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD deserves greater research efforts and remains to be evaluated in randomized, placebo-controlled clinic trial.

In addition, some evidence suggests that inflammatory mediators such as leukotrienes (LTs), which include the 5-lipoxygenase (LOX) family, can regulate endothelial cell differentiation. In the present study, the eicosanoid precursor  (AA) stimulated vasculogenesis of ES cells by increasing the number of fetal liver kinase-1+ vascular progenitor cells as well as vascular structures positive for platelet endothelial cell adhesion protein-1 and vascular endothelial cadherin. The stimulation of vasculogenesis and expression of the rate-limiting enzyme in the LT signaling pathway, 5-LOX-activating protein (FLAP), was blunted upon treatment with the FLAP inhibitors AM643 and REV5901. Vasculogenesis was significantly restored upon exogenous addition of LTs. Downstream of FLAP, the LTB4 receptor (BLT1) blocker U75302, the BLT2 receptor blocker LY255283 as well as the cysteinyl LT blocker BAY-u9773 inhibited vasculogenesis of ES cells. AA treatment of differentiating ES cells increased reactive  species (ROS) generation, which was not affected upon either FLAP or cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition. Prevention of ROS generation by either the free radical scavengers vitamin E and N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)glycine or the NADPH oxidase inhibitor VAS2870 downregulated vasculogenesis of ES cells and blunted the provasculogenic effect of AA. In summary, our data demonstrate that proinflammatory AA stimulates vasculogenesis of ES cells via the LT pathway by mechanisms involving ROS generation.© 2016 S.

This study measured the effects of platelet apheresis on hemodynamics,  metabolism, and coagulation in pigs to assess its impact before employing the animals in experimental studies.Forty pigs (39.8 ± 0.6 kg) were anesthetized and catheterized with an apheresis catheter in the femoral vein. During the platelet apheresis process, blood was withdrawn from the pig to separate platelets, and the remaining red blood cells and plasma returned back to the pigs, using the Haemonetics MCS+9000 system. A total of 12 cycles of blood withdrawn and return were performed during the entire apheresis procedure to reduce platelet counts to a target of 50% of baseline. During the process, hemodynamics was recorded in each cycle. Blood samples were collected before and after apheresis to assess changes in  metabolism and coagulation by prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time (STA-R Evolution Stago), and using Rotem thrombelastometry, and platelet aggregation using a Chrono-Log 700 aggregometer.During each cycle of the apheresis, mean arterial pressure (MAP) was decreased and heart rate was increased by blood withdrawal, but both recovered after blood return. On the completion of the apheresis, platelet count decreased from baseline 345 ± 15 10/L to 141 ± 14 10/L and fibrinogen levels were reduced from 124 ± 5 to 99 ± 4 mg/dL (both p < 0.05). Although  delivery remained unchanged,  consumption was decreased from 4.0 ± 0.2 to 3.2 ± 0.0 mL O/kg/min (p < 0.05). Rotem alpha (clotting speed) decreased from 79 ± 0 to 69 ± 1° and maximum clot firmness (MCF or clot strength) decreased from 71 ± 1 to 57 ± 1 mm (both p < 0.05). No changes were observed in prothrombin time or activated partial thromboplastin time.

Septic shock, the most common form of vasodilatory shock, is a subset of sepsis in which circulatory and cellular/metabolic abnormalities are severe enough to increase mortality. Inflammatory shock constitutes the hallmark of sepsis, but also a final common pathway of any form of severe long-term tissue hypoperfusion. The pathogenesis of inflammatory shock seems to be due to circulating substances released by pathogens (e.g., bacterial endotoxins) and host immuno-inflammatory responses (e.g., changes in the production of histamine, bradykinin, serotonin, nitric oxide [NO], reactive nitrogen and  species, and  [AA]-derived eicosanoids mainly through NO synthase, cyclooxygenase, and cytochrome P450 [CYP] pathways, and proinflammatory cytokine formation). Therefore, refractory hypotension to vasoconstrictors with end-organ hypoperfusion is a life threatening feature of inflammatory shock. This review summarizes the current knowledge regarding the role of eicosanoids derived from CYP pathway of AA in animal models of inflammatory shock syndromes with an emphasis on septic shock in addition to potential therapeutic strategies targeting specific CYP isoforms responsible for proinflammatory/anti-inflammatory mediator production.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Increased dietary intake of ω-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) reduces retinal neovascularization and choroidal neovascularization (CNV), but ω-3 LCPUFA metabolites of a major metabolizing pathway, cytochrome P450 oxidase (CYP) 2C, promote ocular pathological angiogenesis. We hypothesized that inhibition of CYP2C activity will add to the protective effects of ω-3 LCPUFA on neovascular eye diseases.The mouse models of -induced retinopathy and laser-induced CNV were used to investigate pathological angiogenesis in the retina and choroid, respectively. The plasma levels of ω-3 LCPUFA metabolites of CYP2C were determined by mass spectroscopy. Aortic ring and choroidal explant sprouting assays were used to investigate the effects of CYP2C inhibition and ω-3 LCPUFA-derived CYP2C metabolic products on angiogenesis ex vivo. We found that inhibition of CYP2C activity by montelukast added to the protective effects of ω-3 LCPUFA on retinal neovascularization and CNV by 30% and 20%, respectively. In CYP2C8-overexpressing mice fed a ω-3 LCPUFA diet, montelukast suppressed retinal neovascularization and CNV by 36% and 39% and reduced the plasma levels of CYP2C8 products. Soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibition, which blocks breakdown and inactivation of CYP2C ω-3 LCPUFA-derived active metabolites, increased -induced retinopathy and CNV in vivo. Exposure to selected ω-3 LCPUFA metabolites of CYP2C significantly reversed the suppression of both angiogenesis ex vivo and endothelial cell functions in vitro by the CYP2C inhibitor montelukast.Inhibition of CYP2C activity adds to the protective effects of ω-3 LCPUFA on pathological retinal neovascularization and CNV.© 2016 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076131>A novel approach based on metabolomics coupled with network pharmacology to explain the effect mechanisms of Danggui Buxue Tang in anaemia.</a></h2><p>Danggui Buxue Tang (DBT) is a famous Chinese medicinal decoction. Mechanism of DBT action is wide ranging and unclear. Exploring new ways of treatment with DBT is useful. Sprague-Dawley(SD) rats were randomly divided into 3 groups including control (NC, Saline), the DBT (at a dose of 8.10 g), and blood deficiency(BD) (Cyclophosphamide (APH)-andCyclophosphamide(CTX)-induced anaemia). A metabolomics approach using Liquid Chromatography-Quadrupole-Time-of-Flight/Mass Spectrometry (LC/Q-TOFMS) was developed to perform the plasma metabolic profiling analysis and differential metaboliteswerescreened according to the multivariate statistical analysiscomparing the NC and BD groups, andthe hub metabolites were outliers with high scores of the centrality indices. Anaemia disease-related protein target and compound of DBT databases were constructed. The TCMSP, ChemMapper and STITCH databases were used to predict the protein targets of DBT. Using the Cytoscape 3.2.1 to establish a phytochemical component-target protein interaction network and establish a component, protein and hub metabolite protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and merging the three PPI networks basing on BisoGenet. The gene enrichment analysis was used to analyse the relationship between proteins based on the relevant genetic similarity by ClueGO. The results shown DBT effectively treated anaemia in vivo. 11 metabolic pathways are involved in the therapeutic effect of DBT in vivo; S-adenosyl-l-methionine, glycine, l-cysteine,  (AA) and phosphatidylcholine(PC) were screened as hub metabolites in APH-and CTX-induced anaemia. A total of 288 targets were identified as major candidates for anaemia progression. The gene-set enrichment analysis revealed that the targets are involved in iron ion binding, haemopoiesis, reactive  species production, inflammation and apoptosis. The results also showed that these targets were associated with iron ion binding, haemopoiesis, ROS production, apoptosis, inflammation and related signalling pathways. DBT can promote iron ion binding and haemopoiesis activities, restrain inflammation, production of reactive , block apoptosis, and contribute significantly to the DBT treat anaemia.Copyright © 2019 China Pharmaceutical University.

Simulated BOLD responses are compared to experimental BOLD signals observed in the rat barrel cortex and in the hippocampus under seizure conditions showing good agreement. Bursting phenomena provides relatively clear BOLD signals as long as the time between bursts is not too short. For short burst periods the BOLD signal remains constant even though the neuron is in a predominantly bursting mode. Simulation of CSD exhibits large negative BOLD signals. Visco-elastic effects of the capillary bed do not seem to have a large effect on the BOLD signal even for relatively high values of  consumption. While the results of the model suggests that potassium ions released during neural activity could act as the main mediator in NVC, it suggests the possibility of other mechanisms that can coexist and increase blood flow such as the  to epoxyeicosatrienoic  (EET) pathway. The comparison with experimental cerebral blood flow (CBF) data indicates the possible existence of multiple neural pathways influencing the vascular response. Initial negative BOLD signals occur for all simulations due to the rate at which the metabolic  consumption occurs relative to the dilation of the perfusing cerebro-vasculature. However it is unclear as to whether these are normally seen clinically due to the size of the magnetic field. Experimental comparisons for different animal experiments may very well require variation in the model parameters. The complex integrated model is believed to be the first of its kind to simulate both NVC and the resulting BOLD signal.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, we measured hydroxylinoleate (HODE) and hydroxyarachidonate (HETE) isomer serum levels after sample reduction and saponification to investigate POAG pathogenesis. POAG patients (n = 198) were recruited and divided into normal- and high-tension glaucoma groups (n = 84 and 114, respectively) depending on intraocular pressure. Total HODE (/linoleic ) and HETE (/) serum levels were significantly higher in the POAG group (211.9 ± 143.0 and 181.0 ± 164.1 µmol/mol, respectively) than in controls (167.1 ± 105.2 and 132.5 ± 139.7 µmol/mol, p = 0.0025 and 0.0101, respectively). The associations between HODEs/HETEs and glaucoma were further confirmed by multivariate analyses after adjusting for differences in demographic parameters. Among the HODE isomers, the levels of 9- and 13-(Z,E)-HODEs (p = 0.0014) and singlet -specific products (i.e., 10- and 12-(Z,E)-HODEs, p = 0.0345) were higher in the POAG group than in controls, while free radical-mediated oxidation-specific products (i.e., 9- and 13-(E,E)-HODEs, p = 0.0557) demonstrated a marginal difference.

The use of pressurized cold, dry carbon dioxide (C0) pneumoperitoneum causes a number of local effects on the peritoneal mesothelium, as well as systemic effects. These can be observed at a macroscopic, microscopic, cellular and metabolic level. Local effects include evaporative cooling, oxidative stress, desiccation of mesothelium, disruption of mesothelial cell junctions and glycocalyx, diminished scavenging of reactive  species, decreased peritoneal blood flow, peritoneal acidosis, peritoneal hypoxia or necrosis, exposure of the basal lamina and extracellular matrix, lymphocyte infiltration, and generation of peritoneal cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and TNFα. Such damage is increased by high CO insufflation pressures and gas velocities and prolonged laparoscopic procedures. The resulting disruption of the glycocalyx, mesothelial cell barrier and exposure of the extracellular matrix creates a cascade of immunological and pro-inflammatory events and favours tumour cell implantation. Systemic effects include cardiopulmonary and respiratory changes, hypothermia and acidosis. Such coelomic climate change can be prevented by the use of lower insufflation pressures and preconditioned warm humidified CO. By achieving a more physiological temperature, pressure and humidity, the coelomic microenvironment can be better preserved during pneumoperitoneum. This has the potential clinical benefits of maintaining isothermia and perfusion, reducing postoperative pain, preventing adhesions and inhibiting cancer cell implantation in laparoscopic surgery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30843219>Antiplatelet, antioxidative, and anti-inflammatory effects of hydroquinone.</a></h2><p>Platelets play crucial roles in thrombosis and hemostasis through platelet activation and aggregation that are crucial in cardiovascular diseases. Hydroquinone (HQ) and its derivatives are present in many dermatological creams, paints, motor fuels, air, microorganisms, and plant products like wheat bread, fruit, coffee, and red wine. The effect of HQ on humans is not clear. In this study, we found that HQ (>25 μM) inhibited  (AA)-induced platelet aggregation. HQ suppressed AA-induced thromboxane B2 production of platelets. HQ (>10 μM) also attenuated ex vivo platelet-rich plasma aggregation. HQ prevented the interleukin (IL)-1β-induced 8-isoprostane, and PGE2 production, but not IL-8 production of pulp cells. These results indicate that HQ may have an antiplatelet effect via inhibition of thromboxane production. HQ has antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects, and possible inhibition of COX.

Therefore, direct evidence for the electron spin resonance (ESR) detection of how D‑galactosamine (GalN), an established experimental hepatotoxic substance, induced free radicals formation in platelets and primary hepatocytes is presented in the present study. ESR results demonstrated that GalN induced hydroxyl radicals (OH•) in a resting human platelet suspension; however, radicals were not produced in a cell free Fenton reaction system. The GalN‑induced OH• formation was significantly inhibited by the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor indomethasin, though it was not affected by the lipoxygenase (LOX) or cytochrome P450 inhibitors, AA861 and 1‑aminobenzotriazole (ABT), in platelets. In addition, the present study demonstrated that baicalein induced semiquinone free radicals in platelets, which were significantly reduced by the COX inhibitor without affecting the formed OH•. In the mouse primary hepatocytes, the formation of  (AA) induced carbon‑centered radicals that were concentration dependently enhanced by GalN. These radicals were inhibited by AA861, though not affected by indomethasin or ABT. In addition, GalN did not induce platelet aggregation prior to or following collagen pretreatment in human platelets. The results of the present study indicated that GalN and baicalein may induce OH• by COX and LOX in human platelets. GalN also potentiated AA induced carbon‑centered radicals in hepatocytes via cytochrome P450.

The newly discovered potassium channel "TREK-1" is a promising target for therapies against neurodegeneration.  (AA) is an n-6 PUFA, as well as a potent TREK-1 activator. We previously showed that TREK-1 is expressed at high levels in astrocytes. However, the effect of AA on astrocytes in ischemia remains unknown. Here, we assessed the effects of 3-30μM AA on astrocyte apoptosis, glutamate uptake, and expression of the astrocytic glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) and TREK-1 under different conditions. Under normal conditions, 3-30μM AA showed no effect on astrocytic apoptosis or TREK-1 expression, whereas glutamate uptake decreased significantly and its change paralleled the decreased expression of GLT-1. When astrocytes were subjected to 4h of -glucose deprivation (OGD), 10μM AA markedly alleviated OGD-induced cell death, recovering from 63.50±1.90% to 82.96±4.63% of the control value. AA also rescued the decreased glutamate uptake and increased mRNA, as well as protein levels of GLT-1 and TREK-1. Our results provide new evidence of a protective effect of AA on astrocytes under OGD conditions, suggesting that a low concentration of AA may protect against brain ischemic diseases.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) is also known as an independent predictor for adverse clinical events. However, the profile of PUFA in sleep apnea patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) is still unclear. This study aimed to clarify the association between sleep apnea and PUFA profiles in patients with CAD. Two hundred seventy-four consecutive patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were screened for sleep apnea using nocturnal oximetry.  desaturation index down to 4% (4%ODI) ≥5 was used as an indicator of sleep apnea. Baseline characteristics, including PUFA profiles, were compared between patients with and without sleep apnea. Among 243 enrolled patients, 134 (55%) had sleep apnea. The sleep apnea group included a significantly higher rate of patients with obesity, insulin-requiring diabetes, peripheral artery disease (PAD), and a higher C-reactive protein level than the non-sleep apnea group. The sleep apnea group had a significantly lower eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) to  (AA) ratio than the non-sleep apnea group (0.33 vs. 0.44, respectively, p = 0.024). Additionally, EPA value and EPA/AA ratio were significantly correlated with 4%ODI (r = -0.15, p = 0.028; r = -0.16, p = 0.019, respectively). Results of logistic regression analysis indicated that the comorbidities of obesity, PAD, heart failure and EPA/AA ratio had a significant association with sleep apnea.

In our present work, we have screened the efficacy and possible mechanism of abiogenic elicitors like Dipotassium hydrogen orthophosphate KHPO), Oxalic  (OA), Isonicotinic  (INA), Salicylic  (SA), Acetylsalicylate (AS),  (AA) and Calcium chloride (CaCl) to stimulate innate immune responses in  Mill. Excised tomato leaves, treated with elicitors at three different concentrations, were found to stimulate defense and antioxidative enzymes, total phenol and flavonoid content after 24 h of incubation. CaCl (0.5 %) followed by INA (2.5 mM) were found most effective in activation of all such defense molecules in tomato leaves. Furthermore, nitric oxide (NO), a key gaseous mediator in plant defense signaling, was also measured after subsequent elicitor application. Higher doses of elicitors showed an elevated level of reactive  species (ROS) generation, enhanced lipid peroxidation rate and proline content, which indicates the extent of abiotic stress generation on the leaves. However, ROS production, lipid peroxidation rate and proline concentration remain significantly reduced as a result of CaCl (0.5 %) and INA (2.5 mM) application. A sharp increase of total chlorophyll content was also recorded due to treatment of CaCl (0.5 %). These results demonstrate the effects of different abiogenic elicitors to regulate the production of defense molecules.

Rotational thromboelastometry (RT), using tissue factor (EXTEM), a contact activator (INTEM) or cytochalasin (FIBTEM), assesses coagulation by determining the time to initiation of clotting (CT) and clot firmness (MCF) including platelet-fibrin-interaction. The aim of this study was to evaluate RT and whole blood impedance aggregometry (IA) in CCHD compared with a control group without chronic cyanosis (NCCHD). These were used to establish normal reference ranges. We prospectively included 124 patients (76 CCHD, 48 NCCHD). Mean  saturation in CCHD was 81.5%, and 98% in NCCHD (p <0.001). Fifty-five CCHD and 1 NCCHD had pulmonary hypertension. Eisenmenger syndrome was present in 39 CCHD (51.3%). Hemoglobin, hematocrit, and reticulocyte levels were significantly higher in CCHD, and they also showed more thrombocytopenia. Platelet aggregation was under normal range in 89.5% of CCHD after triggering with ADP, in 85.5% after triggering with  (ASPI) and in 73.7% after TRAP-6. RT showed significantly longer clotting times and reduced clot firmness in both EXTEM and INTEM tests. FIBTEM-MCF was also significantly reduced. Moderate inverse correlation was found between platelet count and erythrocytes (r = -0.608, p <0.001). Significant correlations were found between platelet number and RT-parameters as well as with all IA parameters. In conclusion, according to RT and IA, CCHD present hypocoagulable disorders.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of 15d-PGJ on the activity of PTEN, the inhibitor of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt axis, in human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells. Since the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety in the cyclopentenone ring of 15d-PGJ is electrophilic, we hypothesized that 15d-PGJ-induced Akt phosphorylation might result from the covalent modification and subsequent inactivation of PTEN that has several critical cysteine residues. When treated to MCF-7 cells, 15d-PGJ bound to PTEN, and this was abolished in the presence of the thiol-reducing agent dithiothreitol. A mass spectrometric analysis by using recombinant and endogenous PTEN protein revealed that the cysteine 136 residue (Cys) of PTEN is covalently modified upon treatment with 15d-PGJ. Notably, the ability of 15d-PGJ to covalently bind to PTEN as well as to induce Akt phosphorylation was abolished in the cells expressing a mutant form of PTEN in which Cys was replaced by serine (C136S-PTEN). The present study demonstrates for the first time that electrophilic 15d-PGJ directly binds to cysteine 136 of PTEN and provides new insight into PTEN loss in cancer progression associated with chronic inflammation. These observations suggest that 15d-PGJ can undergo nucleophilic addition to PTEN, presumably at Cys, thereby inactivating this tumor suppressor protein with concomitant Akt activation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we report a critical role of the induced reactive  species (ROS)-mediated cellular activation of a protein cross-linking enzyme, transglutaminase 2 (TG2), in liver injury by AA. In cultures of hepatic cells, AA dose-dependently suppressed cell growth, which accompanied the induced nuclear accumulation of TG2, as demonstrated in EGFP-tagged, TG2-overexpressing hepatic cells.

Fructus Ligustri lucidi is the fruit of Ligustrum lucidum and has been used for its tonic effects on the liver. This study was designed to examine the effects of Fructus Ligustri lucidi water extract (FLL) against severe oxidative stress and mitochondrial impairment in vivo and in vitro and to elucidate its cellular mechanisms of action. Treatment of HepG2 cells with  (AA) + iron successfully induced oxidative stress and apoptosis, as indicated by depletion of glutathione, formation of ROS, decreses in mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), and altered expression of apoptosis-related proteins, such as procaspase-3 and Bcl-xL. FLL treatment significantly blocked these pathological changes and the mitochondrial dysfunction caused by AA + iron, which were similar with the effect of aminoimidazole-carboxamide-β-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR). Moreover, FLL induced the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which was mediated by its upstream kinase LKB1. Inhibition or activation of AMPK revealed the role of AMPK in cellular protection conferred by FLL in LKB1-deficient cells. In mice, oral administration of 100 mg/kg FLL activated AMPK in the liver, and protected against oxidative stress and liver injury induced by CCl injection. Among the components of FLL, chlorogenic  was found to be responsible for the protection of hepatocytes against AA + iron-induced cellular damage. Overall, our results confirmed that FLL has the ability to protect hepatocytes against oxidative injury through regulation of the AMPK signaling pathway.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The aim of the present study was to determine whether the new product gallic -L-leucine (GAL) conjugate could ameliorate the LPS-induced dysregulation of  metabolism and NO production. We first investigated the effects of GAL conjugate on the expression of proinflammatory enzymes and the production of proinflammatory NO and lipid mediators in mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7, primary peritoneal macrophages, and mouse model. Western blot analyses revealed that GAL attenuated LPS-induced expression of iNOS, COX-2, and 5-LOX in a concentration-dependent manner. Consistently, probing NO-mediated fluorescence revealed that GAL antagonized the stimulatory effect of LPS on iNOS activity. By profiling of lipid mediators with ESI-MS-based lipidomics, we found that GAL suppressed LPS-induced overproduction of prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2, leukotriene B4, and thromboxane B2. We further discovered that GAL might exhibit anti-inflammatory activities by the following mechanisms: (1) suppressing LPS-induced activation of MAP kinases (i.e., ERK1/2, JNK, and p38); (2) reducing the production of reactive  species (ROS); and (3) preventing LPS-induced nuclear translocation of transcription factors NF-B and AP-1. Consequently, GAL significantly decreased the levels of COX-2 and iNOS expression and the plasma levels of proinflammatory lipid mediators in LPS-treated mice. GAL pretreatment enhanced the survival of mice against LPS-induced endotoxic shock. Taken together, our results suggest that GAL may be a potential anti-inflammatory drug for the treatment of endotoxemia and sepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29891111>5-Lipoxygenase: Its involvement in gastrointestinal malignancies.</a></h2><p>Lipoxygenases (LOXs) are dioxygenases that catalyze the peroxidation of linoleic  (LA) or  (AA), in the presence of molecular .

Here, we characterized COX, LOX, and CYP450 mRNA expression levels in chicken immune tissues in response to Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge and investigated whether ASA and vE could alter gene expression. Additionally, for the first time in chickens, we evaluated oxygen consumption by platelet  as a biomarker of  function in response to ASA- and vE. LPS challenge compromised bird growth rates, but neither dietary ASA nor vE significantly ameliorated this effect; however, gradually increasing dietary vE levels were more effective than basal levels. ASA regulated  metabolism, providing an eicosanoid synthesis substrate, whereas gradually increasing vE levels evoked aspirin resistance during challenge. Gene expression in immune tissues was highly variable, indicating a complex regulatory network controlling inflammatory pathways. However, unlike COX-1, COX-2 and CYP450 exhibited increased mRNA expression in some cases, suggesting an initiation of novel anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving signals during challenge. Measuring oxygen consumption rate, we revealed that neither the ASA nor vE levels applied here exerted toxic effects on platelet .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31241743>A Genome-Wide Functional Genomics Approach Identifies Susceptibility Pathways to Fungal Bloodstream Infection in Humans.</a></h2><p>Candidemia, one of the most common causes of fungal bloodstream infection, leads to mortality rates up to 40% in affected patients. Understanding genetic mechanisms for differential susceptibility to candidemia may aid in designing host-directed therapies.We performed the first genome-wide association study on candidemia, and we integrated these data with variants that affect cytokines in different cellular systems stimulated with Candida albicans.We observed strong association between candidemia and a variant, rs8028958, that significantly affects the expression levels of PLA2G4B in blood. We found that up to 35% of the susceptibility loci affect in vitro cytokine production in response to Candida. Furthermore, potential causal genes located within these loci are enriched for lipid and  metabolism. Using an independent cohort, we also showed that the numbers of risk alleles at these loci are negatively correlated with reactive  species and interleukin-6 levels in response to Candida. Finally, there was a significant correlation between susceptibility and allelic scores based on 16 independent candidemia-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms that affect monocyte-derived cytokines, but not with T cell-derived cytokines.Our results prioritize the disturbed lipid homeostasis and oxidative stress as potential mechanisms that affect monocyte-derived cytokines to influence susceptibility to candidemia.© The Author(s) 2019.

We previously observed that anandamide (AEA), one of the representative endocannabinoids, effectively inhibited the proliferation of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines in a receptor-independent manner. In this study, using HNSCC cell lines, we examined the anti-cancer effects and the mechanisms of action of docosahexaenoyl ethanolamide (DHEA) and N-arachidonoyl-L-alanine (NALA), which are polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA)-based ethanolamides like AEA.DHEA and NALA were found to effectively inhibit HNSCC cell proliferation. These anti-proliferative effects seemed to be mediated in a cannabinoid receptor-independent manner, since the antagonist of cannabinoid receptor-1 (CB1) and vanilloid receptor-1 (VR1), two endocannabinoid receptors, did not reverse the ability of DHEA and NALA to induce cell death. Instead, we observed an increase in reactive  species (ROS) production and a decrease of phosphorylated Akt as a result of DHEA and NALA treatment. Antioxidants efficiently reversed the inhibition of cell proliferation and the decrease of phosphorylated Akt induced by DHEA and NALA; inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), which is expected to be involved in DHEA- and NALA-degradation pathway, also partially blocked the ability of DHEA and NALA to inhibit cell proliferation and phosphorylated Akt. Interestingly, ROS production as a result of DHEA and NALA treatment was decreased by inhibition of 5-LO.From these findings, we suggest that ROS production induced by the 5-LO pathway mediates the anti-cancer effects of DHEA and NALA on HNSCC cells. Finally, our findings suggest the possibility of a new cancer-specific therapeutic strategy, which utilizes 5-LO activity rather than inhibiting it.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28314621>Docosahexaenoic  (DHA): An essential nutrient and a nutraceutical for brain health and diseases.</a></h2><p>Docosahexaenoic  (DHA), a polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) enriched in phospholipids in the brain and retina, is known to play multi-functional roles in brain health and diseases. While  (AA) is released from membrane phospholipids by cytosolic phospholipase A (cPLA), DHA is linked to action of the Ca-independent iPLA2. DHA undergoes enzymatic conversion by 15-lipoxygenase (Alox 15) to form oxylipins including resolvins and neuroprotectins, which are powerful lipid mediators. DHA can also undergo non-enzymatic conversion by reacting with  free radicals (ROS), which cause the production of 4-hydoxyhexenal (4-HHE), an aldehyde derivative which can form adducts with DNA, proteins and lipids. In studies with both animal models and humans, there is evidence that inadequate intake of maternal n-3 PUFA may lead to aberrant development and function of the central nervous system (CNS). What is less certain is whether consumption of n-3 PUFA is important in maintaining brain health throughout one's life span. Evidence mostly from non-human studies suggests that DHA intake above normal nutritional requirements might modify the risk/course of a number of diseases of the brain. This concept has fueled much of the present interest in DHA research, in particular, in attempts to delineate mechanisms whereby DHA may serve as a nutraceutical and confer neuroprotective effects. Current studies have revealed ability for the oxylipins to regulation of cell redox homeostasis through the Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2/Antioxidant response element (Nrf2/ARE) anti-oxidant pathway, and impact signaling pathways associated with neurotransmitters, and modulation of neuronal functions involving brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF). This review is aimed at describing recent studies elaborating these mechanisms with special regard to aging and Alzheimer's disease, autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, traumatic brain injury, and stroke.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The aging of Mortierella alpina has long been known to significantly improve ARA yield, but the exact mechanism is still elusive. Herein, multiple approaches including large-scale label-free comparative proteomics were employed to systematically investigate the mechanism mentioned above. Upon ultrastructural observation, abnormal mitochondria were found to aggregate around shrunken lipid droplets. Proteomics analysis revealed a total of 171 proteins with significant alterations of expression during aging. Pathway analysis suggested that reactive  species (ROS) were accumulated and stimulated the activation of the malate/pyruvate cycle and isocitrate dehydrogenase, which might provide additional NADPH for ARA synthesis. EC 4.2.1.17-hydratase might be a key player in ARA accumulation during aging. These findings provide a valuable resource for efforts to further improve the ARA content in the oil produced by aging M. alpina.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29111350>Metabolic changes in tumor cells and tumor-associated macrophages: A mutual relationship.</a></h2><p>In order to adapt to the reduced availability of nutrients and  in the tumor microenvironment and the increased requirements of energy and building blocks necessary for maintaining their high proliferation rate, malignant cells undergo metabolic changes that result in an increased production of lactate, nitric oxide, reactive  species, prostaglandins and other byproducts of  metabolism that influence both the composition of the inflammatory microenvironment and the function of the tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). In response to cues present in the TME, among which products of altered tumor cell metabolism, TAMs are also required to reprogram their metabolism, with activation of glycolysis, fatty  synthesis and altered nitrogen cycle metabolism. These changes result in functional reprogramming of TAMs which includes changes in the production of cytokines and angiogenetic factors, and contribute to the tumor progression and metastasis. Understanding the metabolic changes governing the intricate relationship between the tumor cells and the TAMs represents an essential step towards developing novel therapeutic approaches targeting the metabolic reprogramming of the immune cells to potentiate their tumoricidal potential and to circumvent therapy resistance.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Redox-dependent sphingosine-1-phosphate production and release are altered in diabetic platelets. Sphingosine-1-phosphate is a double-edged sword for ischemia/reperfusion injury. Therefore, we aimed to verify whether: (1) human healthy- or diabetic-platelets are cardioprotective, (2) sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors and downstream kinases play a role in platelet-induced cardioprotection, and (3) a correlation between platelet redox status and myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury exists. Isolated rat hearts were subjected to 30-min ischemia and 1-h reperfusion. Infarct size was studied in hearts pretreated with healthy- or diabetic-platelets. Healthy-platelets were co-infused with sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor blocker, ERK-1/2 inhibitor, PI3K antagonist or PKC inhibitor to ascertain the cardioprotective mechanisms. In platelets we assessed (i) aggregation response to ADP, collagen, and , (ii) cyclooxygenase-1 levels, and (iii) AKT and ERK-phosphorylation. Platelet sphingosine-1-phosphate production and platelet levels of reactive  species (ROS) were quantified and correlated to infarct size. Infarct size was reduced by about 22% in healthy-platelets pretreated hearts only. This cardioprotective effect was abrogated by either sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors or ERK/PI3K/PKC pathway blockade. Cyclooxygenase-1 levels and aggregation indices were higher in diabetic-platelets than healthy-platelets. Diabetic-platelets released less sphingosine-1-phosphate than healthy-platelets when mechanical or chemically stimulated . Yet, ROS levels were higher in diabetic-platelets and correlated with infarct size. Cardioprotective effects of healthy-platelet depend on the platelet's capacity to activate cardiac sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors and ERK/PI3K/PKC pathways. However, diabetic-platelets release less S1P and lose cardioprotective effects. Platelet ROS levels correlate with infarct size. Whether these redox alterations are responsible for sphingosine-1-phosphate dysfunction in diabetic-platelets remains to be ascertained.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27472345>Marine Natural Product Inhibitors of Neutrophil-Associated Inflammation.</a></h2><p>Neutrophils are widely recognized to play an important role in acute inflammatory responses, and recent evidence has expanded their role to modulating chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Reactive  species (ROS) and microbicidal compounds released from neutrophils that are recruited to the site of inflammation contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple inflammation-associated diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atherosclerosis, and hepatitis. Marine organisms are a valuable source of bioactive compounds with potential for industrial and pharmaceutical application. Marine natural products that inhibit neutrophil activation could be used as drugs for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Numerous studies investigating marine natural products have reported novel anti-inflammatory agents. Nevertheless, the detailed mechanisms underlying their actions, which could facilitate our understanding of the molecular events occurring in neutrophils, have not been reported in most of the associated research studies. Therefore, in this review, we will present marine products that inhibit neutrophil-associated inflammation. Furthermore, we will be limiting the detailed discussion to agents with well-investigated molecular targets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27448436>Phospholipid Ozonation Products Activate the 5-Lipoxygenase Pathway in Macrophages.</a></h2><p>Ozone is a highly reactive environmental toxicant that can react with the double bonds of lipids in pulmonary surfactant. This study was undertaken to investigate the proinflammatory properties of the major lipid-ozone product in pulmonary surfactant, 1-palmitoyl-2-(9'-oxo-nonanoyl)-glycerophosphocholine (16:0/9al-PC), with respect to eicosanoid production. A dose-dependent increase in the formation of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) products was observed in murine resident peritoneal macrophages (RPM) and alveolar macrophages (AM) upon treatment with 16:0/9al-PC. In contrast, the production of cyclooxygenase (COX) derived eicosanoids did not change from basal levels in the presence of 16:0/9al-PC. When 16:0/9al-PC and the TLR2 ligand, zymosan, were added to RPM or AM, an enhancement of 5-LO product formation along with a concomitant decrease in COX product formation was observed. Neither intracellular calcium levels nor  release was influenced by the addition of 16:0/9al-PC to RPM. Results from mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor studies and direct measurement of phosphorylation of MAPKs revealed that 16:0/9al-PC activates the p38 MAPK pathway in RPM, which results in the activation of 5-LO. Our results indicate that 16:0/9al-PC has a profound effect on the eicosanoid pathway, which may have implications in inflammatory pulmonary disease states where eicosanoids have been shown to play a role.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29156153>Hyperbaric  therapy is not associated with oxidative stress assessed using plasma F-isoprostanes and isofurans.</a></h2><p>Hyperbaric  (HBO) therapy is increasingly used in medical practice as a means of enhancing the formation of collagen matrix and angiogenesis, thus promoting healing in wounds and necrotic tissue. However, there are concerns that  can also associate with increased production of  free radicals and oxidative stress. F-Isoprostanes (F-IsoPs) formed by non-enzymatic oxidation of  (AA) are reliable measures for assessing oxidative stress in vivo. In addition, under conditions of high  tension isofurans (IsoFs) are preferentially formed from AA and are considered to better reflect oxidative stress in the setting of high  tension. This study aimed to measure plasma IsoFs and F-IsoP in patients receiving HBO therapy to treat osteonecrosis secondary to radiation therapy. Our hypothesis was that IsoFs would continue to rise with increasing  pressures in contrast to F-IsoPs whose synthesis would be reduced.Twelve patients receiving hyperbaric therapy to treat osteonecrosis secondary to radiation therapy were studied during hyperbaric treatment. Blood samples were collected prior to, during and after cessation of HBO therapy that lasted for 119min. Seven serial blood samples were collected for measurement of plasma F-IsoPs and IsoFs, blood gases and haemoglobin. saturation and venous  partial pressure (PvO) rose significantly during hyperbaric therapy. However, there were no significant changes in plasma IsoFs or F-IsoPs during the hyperbaric therapy session.In this study of patients with osteonecrosis, HBO therapy at a maximum pressure of 2.4atm with up to 100%  did not worsen oxidative stress assessed using plasma F- IsoFs and IsoPs.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Comparative analysis of drought responsive proteins will provide insight into molecular mechanism in Lolium multiflorum drought tolerance. Using the iTRAQ-based approach, proteomic changes in tolerant and susceptible lines were examined in response to drought condition. A total of 950 differentially accumulated proteins was found to be involved in carbohydrate metabolism, amino  metabolism, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and signal transduction pathway, such as β-D-xylosidase, β-D-glucan glucohydrolase, glycerate dehydrogenase, Cobalamin-independent methionine synthase, glutamine synthetase 1a, Farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, diacylglycerol, and inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate, which might contributed to enhance drought tolerance or adaption in Lolium multiflorum. Interestingly, the two specific metabolic pathways,  and inositol phosphate metabolism including differentially accumulated proteins, were observed only in the tolerant lines. Cysteine protease cathepsin B, Cysteine proteinase, lipid transfer protein and Aquaporin were observed as drought-regulated proteins participating in hydrolysis and transmembrane transport. The activities of phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase, peroxiredoxin, dehydroascorbate reductase, peroxisomal ascorbate peroxidase and monodehydroascorbate reductase associated with alleviating the accumulation of reactive  species in stress inducing environments.

Under ECNICI conditions, PFB-TMS derivatives of eicosanoids ionize to form very few ions, with the carboxylates [M-PFB] being typically the most intense. Less intense ions may be additionally formed by consecutive neutral loss (NL) of trimethylsilanol (TMSOH, 90Da) groups ([M-PFB-(TMSOH)]). By using [1,1-O]- and [1,ω-O]-eicosanoids, we studied ion processes following collisionally activated dissociation (CAD) of the precursor ions [M-PFB]. We found that CAD resulted in formation of product ions due to NL of a TMSOH (92Da) group in monocarboxylic and of a PFBOH (200Da) group in dicarboxylic eicosanoids. TMSOH NL implies an intra-molecular transfer of the TMS group from hydroxyl groups to their carboxylate anions [M-PFB]. From a mechanistic point of view, this rearrangement may explain formation of unique product ions in GC-MS/MS of eicosanoids under ECNICI conditions. From the quantitative point of view, quantification by GC-MS/MS of product ions due to [M-PFB-(TMSOH)] and [M-PFB-TMSOH-(TMSOH)]would reveal incorrect data, if [1,1-O]-eicosanoids are used as internal standards and if no correction for the O-loss is performed. In O-labelled dicarboxylic eicosanoids, such as the major urinary metabolite (MUM) of E prostaglandins, i.e., [1,ω-O]-PGE-MUM), no TMS ester/TMS ether rearrangement was observed. Yet, O-loss occurred upon CAD of [M-PFB] due to NL of PFBOH (200Da). In both cases the extent of O-loss needs to be determined and considered for accurate quantification of monocarboxylic acids such as 8-isoprostaglandin F (8-iso-PGF) and dicarboxylic eicosanoids such as PGE-MUM.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

PPAR are nuclear receptors activated by oxidised and nitrated fatty  derivatives as well as by cyclopentenone prostaglandins (PGA and 15d-PGJ) during the inflammatory response. This results in the modulation of the pro-inflammatory response, preventing it from being excessively activated. Other activators of these receptors are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and fatty acids, especially polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) (, ALA, EPA, and DHA). The main function of PPAR during the inflammatory reaction is to promote the inactivation of NF-κB. Possible mechanisms of inactivation include direct binding and thus inactivation of p65 NF-κB or ubiquitination leading to proteolytic degradation of p65 NF-κB. PPAR also exert indirect effects on NF-κB. They promote the expression of antioxidant enzymes, such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, or heme oxygenase-1, resulting in a reduction in the concentration of reactive  species (ROS), i.e., secondary transmitters in inflammatory reactions. PPAR also cause an increase in the expression of IκBα, SIRT1, and PTEN, which interferes with the activation and function of NF-κB in inflammatory reactions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28508118>Effects of aeration on metabolic profiles of Mortierella alpina during the production of .</a></h2><p>To investigate the metabolic regulation against  supply, comparative metabolomics was performed to explore the metabolic responses of Mortierella alpina in the process of  (ARA) production. More than 110 metabolites involved in Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway, pentose phosphate pathway, tricarboxylic  cycle, inositol phosphate metabolism, fatty  biosynthesis, and amino  metabolism were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Samples at different aeration rates were clearly distinguished by principal components analysis and partial least squares analysis, indicating that  supply had a profound effect on the metabolism of M. alpina. Eleven major metabolites were identified as potential biomarkers to be primarily responsible for the difference of metabolism. Further study of metabolic changes with the relevant pathways demonstrated that the levels of several intermediate metabolites in relation to central carbon metabolism changed remarkably via both processes and citrate and malate was supposed to play vital roles in polyunsaturated  (PUFA) synthesis. Increase of myo-inositol and sorbitol were probably for osmo-regulation and redox balance, while enhanced phosphoric  and pyroglutamic  were supposed to have function in the activation of signal transduction pathway for stress resistance.

Although initiation of an inflammatory response may be beneficial in response to injury of the nervous system, chronic or maladaptive neuroinflammation can have harmful outcomes in many neurological diseases. An acute neuroinflammatory response is protective when activated neuroglia facilitate tissue repair by releasing anti-inflammatory cytokines and neurotrophic factors. On the other hand, chronic neuroglial activation is a major pathological mechanism in neurodegenerative diseases, likely contributing to neuronal dysfunction, injury, and disease progression. Therefore, the development of specific and sensitive probes for positron emission tomography (PET) studies of neuroinflammation is attracting immense scientific and clinical interest. An early phase of this research emphasized PET studies of the prototypical imaging biomarker of glial activation, translocator protein-18 kDa (TSPO), which presents difficulties for quantitation and lacks absolute cellular specificity. Many alternate molecular targets present themselves for PET imaging of neuroinflammation in vivo, including enzymes, intracellular signaling molecules as well as ionotropic, G-protein coupled, and immunoglobulin receptors. We now review the lead structures in radiotracer development for PET studies of neuroinflammation targets for neurodegenerative diseases extending beyond TSPO, including glycogen synthase kinase 3, monoamine oxidase-B, reactive  species, imidazoline-2 binding sites, cyclooxygenase, the phospholipase A2/ pathway, sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1, cannabinoid-2 receptor, the chemokine receptor CX3CR1, purinergic receptors: P2X and P2Y, the receptor for advanced glycation end products, Mer tyrosine kinase, and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1. We provide a brief overview of the cellular expression and function of these targets, noting their selectivity for astrocytes and/or microglia, and highlight the classes of PET radiotracers that have been investigated in early-stage preclinical or clinical research studies of neuroinflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29986724>Unveiling anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of docosahexaenoic  and its lipid peroxidation product on lipopolysaccharide-stimulated BV-2 microglial cells.</a></h2><p>Phospholipids in the central nervous system are enriched in n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), especially docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and  (ARA). These PUFA can undergo enzymatic reactions to produce lipid mediators, as well as reaction with  free radicals to produce 4-hydroxyhexenal (4-HHE) from DHA and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) from ARA. Recent studies demonstrated pleiotropic properties of these peroxidation products through interaction with oxidative and anti-oxidant response pathways. In this study, BV-2 microglial cells were used to investigate ability for DHA, 4-HHE, and 4-HNE to stimulate the anti-oxidant stress responses involving the nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway and synthesis of heme oxygenase (HO-1), as well as to mitigate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric oxide (NO), reactive  species (ROS), and cytosolic phospholipase A (cPLA). In addition, LC-MS/MS analysis was carried out to examine effects of exogenous DHA and LPS stimulation on endogenous 4-HHE and 4-HNE levels in BV-2 microglial cells.Effects of DHA, 4-HHE, and 4-HNE on LPS-induced NO production was determined using the Griess reagent. LPS-induced ROS production was measured using CM-HDCFDA. Western blots were used to analyze expression of p-cPLA, Nrf2, and HO-1. Cell viability and cytotoxicity were measured using the WST-1 assay, and cell protein concentrations were measured using the BCA protein assay kit. An ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis was used to determine levels of free 4-HHE and 4-HNE in cells.DHA (12.5-100 μM), 4-HHE (1.25-10 μM), and 4-HNE (1.25-10 μM) dose dependently suppressed LPS-induced production of NO, ROS, and as p-cPLA in BV-2 microglial cells. With the same concentrations, these compounds could enhance Nrf2 and HO-1 expression in these cells. Based on the estimated IC values, 4-HHE and 4-HNE were five- to tenfold more potent than DHA in inhibiting LPS-induced NO, ROS, and p-cPLA. LC-MS/MS analysis indicated ability for DHA (10-50 μM) to increase levels of 4-HHE and attenuate levels of 4-HNE in BV-2 microglial cells. Stimulation of cells with LPS caused an increase in 4-HNE which could be abrogated by cPLA inhibitor. In contrast, bromoenol lactone (BEL), a specific inhibitor for the Ca-independent phospholipase A (iPLA), could only partially suppress levels of 4-HHE induced by DHA or DHA + LPS.This study demonstrated the ability of DHA and its lipid peroxidation products, namely, 4-HHE and 4-HNE at 1.25-10 μM, to enhance Nrf2/HO-1 and mitigate LPS-induced NO, ROS, and p-cPLA in BV-2 microglial cells. In addition, LC-MS/MS analysis of the levels of 4-HHE and 4-HNE in microglial cells demonstrates that increases in production of 4-HHE from DHA and 4-HNE from LPS are mediated by different mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27775719>Astrocytes mediate neurovascular signaling to capillary pericytes but not to arterioles.</a></h2><p>Active neurons increase their energy supply by dilating nearby arterioles and capillaries. This neurovascular coupling underlies blood  level-dependent functional imaging signals, but its mechanism is controversial. Canonically, neurons release glutamate to activate metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) on astrocytes, evoking Ca release from internal stores, activating phospholipase A2 and generating vasodilatory  derivatives. However, adult astrocytes lack mGluR5, and knockout of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors that release Ca from stores does not affect neurovascular coupling. We now show that buffering astrocyte Ca inhibits neuronally evoked capillary dilation, that astrocyte [Ca] is raised not by release from stores but by entry through ATP-gated channels, and that Ca generates  via phospholipase D2 and diacylglycerol lipase rather than phospholipase A2. In contrast, dilation of arterioles depends on NMDA receptor activation and Ca-dependent NO generation by interneurons. These results reveal that different signaling cascades regulate cerebral blood flow at the capillary and arteriole levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27177786>[Regulation of vasomotor tone of small skeletal muscle veins by intrinsic mechanisms].</a></h2><p>In many developed countries the prevalence of venous disorders and its consequences are higher than that of arterial diseases. Thus it is very important to understand the exact physiological and pathophysiological function of small veins and their control mechanisms. Small veins and venules have an important role in the regulation of capillary fluid exchange, as well as return of the venous blood into the heart. However, there is only limited knowledge available regarding the role of local mechanisms controlling the vasomotor tone and diameter of small veins. In the last decade the authors focused on the elucidation of these mechanisms in isolated skeletal muscle venules of rats. Their results suggest that the tone of small veins is controlled by the integration of several mechanisms, activated by the intraluminal pressure and flow/wall shear stress, in addition to numerous local mediators synthesized and released from the smooth muscle and endothelium. These mechanisms are involved - in a complex manner - in the control of postcapillary resistance, thus regulation of tissue blood supply, venous return and consequently in the modulation of the cardiac output, as well.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27428262>Effects of Fatty Acids on Intracellular [Ca2+], Mitochondrial Uncoupling and Apoptosis in Rat Pachytene Spermatocytes and Round Spermatids.</a></h2><p>The aim of this work was to explore the ability of free , palmitic  and the unsaturated fatty acids oleic  and docosahexaenoic  to modify calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial function in rat pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids. In contrast to palmitic , unsaturated fatty acids produced significant increases in intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i) in both cell types. Increases were fatty  specific, dose-dependent and different for each cell type. The  effects on [Ca2+]i were higher in spermatids than in spermatocytes and persisted when residual extracellular Ca2+ was chelated by EGTA, indicating that the increase in [Ca2+]i originated from release of intracellular calcium stores. At the concentrations required for these increases, unsaturated fatty acids produced no significant changes in the plasma membrane potential of or non-specific permeability in spermatogenic cells. For the case of , the [Ca2+]i increases were not caused by its metabolic conversion to eicosanoids or anandamide; thus we attribute this effect to the fatty  itself. As estimated with fluorescent probes, unsaturated fatty acids did not affect the intracellular pH but were able to induce a progressive decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential. The association of this decrease with reduced reactive  species (ROS) production strongly suggests that unsaturated fatty acids induced mitochondrial uncoupling. This effect was stronger in spermatids than in spermatocytes. As a late event,  induced caspase 3 activation in a dose-dependent manner both in the absence and presence of external Ca2+.

Long-chain free fatty acids and EETs activate GPR40, prompting us to investigate the role of GPR40 in some vascular EET activities. 14,15-EET, 11,12-EET, , and the GPR40 agonist GW9508 increase intracellular calcium concentrations in human GPR40-overexpressing HEK293 cells (EC = 0.58 ± 0.08 μm, 0.91 ± 0.08 μm, 3.9 ± 0.06 μm, and 19 ± 0.37 nm, respectively). EETs with - and -epoxides had similar activities, whereas substitution of a thiirane sulfur for the epoxide  decreased the activities. 8,9-EET, 5,6-EET, and the epoxide hydrolysis products 11,12- and 14,15-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids were less active than 11,12-EET. The GPR40 antagonist GW1100 and siRNA-mediated GPR40 silencing blocked the EET- and GW9508-induced calcium increases. EETs are weak GPR120 agonists. GPR40 expression was detected in human and bovine endothelial cells (ECs), smooth muscle cells, and arteries. 11,12-EET concentration-dependently relaxed preconstricted coronary arteries; however, these relaxations were not altered by GW1100. In human ECs, 11,12-EET increased MAP kinase (MAPK)-mediated ERK phosphorylation, phosphorylation and levels of connexin-43 (Cx43), and expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), all of which were inhibited by GW1100 and the MAPK inhibitor U0126. Moreover, siRNA-mediated GPR40 silencing decreased 11,12-EET-induced ERK phosphorylation. These results indicated that GPR40 is a low-affinity EET receptor in vascular cells and arteries. We conclude that epoxidation of  to EETs enhances GPR40 agonist activity and that 11,12-EET stimulation of GPR40 increases Cx43 and COX-2 expression in ECs via ERK phosphorylation.© 2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30852615>The processes associated with lipid peroxidation in human embryonic lung fibroblasts, treated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and organic extract from particulate matter.</a></h2><p>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) may cause lipid peroxidation via reactive  species generation. 15-F2t-isoprostane (IsoP), an oxidative stress marker, is formed from  (AA) by a free-radical induced oxidation. AA may also be converted to prostaglandins (PG) by prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase (PTGS) induced by NF-κB. We treated human embryonic lung fibroblasts (HEL12469) with benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), 3-nitrobenzanthrone (3-NBA) and extractable organic matter (EOM) from ambient air particulate matter <2.5 µm for 4 and 24 h. B[a]P and 3-NBA induced expression of PAH metabolising, but not antioxidant enzymes. The concentrations of IsoP decreased, whereas the levels of AA tended to increase. Although the activity of NF-κB was not detected, the tested compounds affected the expression of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2). The levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) decreased following exposure to B[a]P, whereas 3-NBA exposure tended to increase PGE2 concentration. A distinct response was observed after EOM exposure: expression of PAH-metabolising enzymes was induced, IsoP levels increased after 24-h treatment but AA concentration was not affected. The activity of NF-κB increased after both exposure periods, and a significant induction of PTGS2 expression was found following 4-h treatment. Similarly to PAHs, the EOM exposure was associated with a decrease of PGE2 levels. In summary, exposure to PAHs with low pro-oxidant potential results in a decrease of IsoP levels implying 'antioxidant' properties. For such compounds, IsoP may not be a suitable marker of lipid peroxidation.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the UK Environmental Mutagen Society.

The dissolved  concentration was well suited for ARA biosynthesis. Moreover, the ultimate dry cell weight (DCW), lipid, and ARA yields obtained using this strategy reached 41.4, 22.2, 13.5 g/L, respectively. The respective values represent 14.8, 25.8, and 7.8% improvements over traditional fed-batch fermentation processes.This strategy provides promising control insights for the mass production of ARA-rich oil on an industrial scale.

The action of enzymes such as cyclooxygenases on AA leads to inflammatory stimuli and increases the cell oxidative stress. We report here the neuroprotective effect of 2-hydroxyarachidonic  (2OAA), a cyclooxygenase inhibitor derived from AA, as a promising neuroprotective therapy against stroke. The effect of a single dose of 2OAA, administered intragastrically 1h after the ischaemic insult, in a rat model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) was tested after 24h of reperfusion. Infarct volume was measured by TTC method to evaluate the neuroprotective effect. Levels of phospholipids and neutral lipids were measured by thin-layer chromatography. The expression of cPLA2 and sPLA2 phospholipases responsible for the cleavage of membrane phospholipids, as well as the expression of antioxidant enzymes, was measured by qPCR. Lipid peroxidation was measured as the concentration of malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxynonenal. The treatment with 2OAA reduced the infarct volume and prevented ischaemia-induced increases in transcription levels of free fatty  (FFAs), as well as in both phospholipases A2 (cPLA2 and sPLA2). The lipid peroxidation and the transcription levels of antioxidant enzymes induced by ischaemia were also decreased by this treatment. We conclude that 2OAA treatment results in a strong neuroprotective effect that seems to rely on a decrease in PLA2 transcriptional activity. This would reduce their action on the membrane phospholipids reducing reactive  and nitrogen species generated by FFAs. Based on the transcriptional activity of the antioxidant enzymes, we conclude that the treatment prevents oxidative stress rather than promoting the antioxidant response.

Among these 249 men and 200 women, aged 20⁻50 years (33.4 ± 8.4 year, mean ± Standard Deviation), 79 low, 166 moderate and 204 high CVFL were categorized by age- and gender- specific percentile, respectively. Twenty-four fatty acids were quantified from fasting plasma. Higher levels of 2 very long-chain saturated FAs (VLSFAs): Arachidic  (AR1, C20:0) and Docosanoic  (DA1, C22:0) as well as 2 -6 polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs):  (AA, C20:4-6) and Docosatetraenoic  (DTA, C22:4-6) were observed in the subjects with low CVFL. Notably this association exists only in men. Estimated maximal  consumption (VO), the marker for cardiorespiratory fitness, was used for further regression analysis. After the adjustment of potential confounding factors (age, smoking, hypertension status, body mass index (BMI), insulin resistance status, and C-reactive protein (CRP), AA was the only FA correlated with low VO in women; while in men AR1, DA1, AA, and DTA remain negatively associated with VO. This preliminary analysis suggests a sex-dimorphic relationship between these plasma VLSFAs and -6 PUFAs with CVFL and merits further investigation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28799496>Anti-inflammatory Natural Prenylated Phenolic Compounds - Potential Lead Substances.</a></h2><p>Natural phenolics are secondary plant metabolites, which can be divided into several categories with the common structural feature of phenolic hydroxyl. The biological activity of phenolics is often modified and enhanced by prenylation by prenyl and geranyl; higher terpenoid chains are rare. The type of prenyl connection and modification affects their biological activity.This review summarizes information about prenylated phenols and some of their potential sources, and provides an overview of their anti-inflammatory potential in vitro and in vivo.The literature search was performed using SciFinder and keywords prenyl, phenol, and inflammation. For individual compounds, an additional search was performed to find information about further activities and mechanisms of effects.We summarized the effects of prenylated phenolics in vitro in cellular or biochemical systems on the production and release of inflammation-related cytokines; their effects on inhibition of cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases; the effects on production of nitric oxide, antiradical and antioxidant activity; and the effect on the inhibition of the release of enzymes and mediators from neutrophils, mast cells and macrophages. The information about the antiphlogistic potential of prenylated phenolics is further supported by a review of their action in animal models.Almost 400 prenylated phenols were reviewed to overview their antiinflammatory effect. The bioactivity of several prenylated phenols was confirmed also using in vivo assays. A pool of natural prenylated phenols represents a source of inspiration for synthesis, and prenylated phenols as components of various medicinal plants used to combat inflammation could be their active principles.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31293429>Epoxy-Oxylipins and Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase Metabolic Pathway as Targets for NSAID-Induced Gastroenteropathy and Inflammation-Associated Carcinogenesis.</a></h2><p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) including epoxide-modified ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids are made  oxidation to create highly polarized carbon- bonds crucial to their function as signaling molecules. A critical PUFA,  (ARA), is metabolized to a diverse set of lipids signaling molecules through cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), cytochrome P450 epoxygenase, or cytochrome P450 hydroxylase; however, the majority of ARA is metabolized into anti-inflammatory epoxides  cytochrome P450 enzymes. These short-lived epoxide lipids are rapidly metabolized or inactivated by the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) into diol-containing products. sEH inhibition or knockout has been a practical approach to study the biology of the epoxide lipids, and has been shown to effectively treat inflammatory conditions in the preclinical models including gastrointestinal ulcers and colitis by shifting oxylipins to epoxide profiles, inhibiting inflammatory cell infiltration and activation, and enhancing epithelial cell defense  increased mucin production, thus providing further evidence for the role of sEH as a pro-inflammatory protein. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with COX-inhibitor activity are among the most commonly used analgesics and have demonstrated applications in the management of cardiovascular disease and intriguingly cancer. Major side effects of NSAIDs however are gastrointestinal ulcers which frequently precludes their long-term application. In this review, we hope to bridge the gap between NSAID toxicity and sEH-mediated metabolic pathways to focus on the role of epoxy fatty  metabolic pathway of PUFAs in NSAIDS-ulcer formation and healing as well as inflammation-related carcinogenesis. Specifically we address the potential application of sEH inhibition to enhance ulcer healing at the site of inflammation  their activity on altered lipid signaling, mitochondrial function, and diminished reactive  species, and further discuss the significance of dual COX and sEH inhibitor in anti-inflammation and carcinogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27358055>The epoxyeicosatrienoic  analog PVPA ameliorates cyclosporine-induced hypertension and renal injury in rats.</a></h2><p>The introduction of calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) into clinical practice in the late 1970s transformed organ transplantation and led to significant improvement in acute rejection episodes. However, despite their significant clinical utility, the use of these agents is hampered by the development of hypertension and nephrotoxicity, which ultimately lead to end-stage kidney disease and overt cardiovascular outcomes. There are currently no effective agents to treat or prevent these complications. Importantly, CNI-free immunosuppressive regimens lack the overall efficacy of CNI-based treatments and put patients at risk of allograft rejection. Cytochrome P-450 epoxygenase metabolites of , epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), have potent vasodilator and antihypertensive properties in addition to many cytoprotective effects, but their effects on CNI-induced nephrotoxicity have not been explored. Here, we show that PVPA, a novel, orally active analog of 14,15-EET, effectively prevents the development of hypertension and ameliorates kidney injury in cyclosporine-treated rats. PVPA treatment reduced proteinuria and renal dysfunction induced by cyclosporine. PVPA inhibited inflammatory cell infiltration into the kidney and decreased renal fibrosis. PVPA also reduced tubular epithelial cell apoptosis, attenuated the generation of reactive  species, and modulated the unfolded protein response that is associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress. Consistent with the in vivo data, PVPA attenuated cyclosporine-induced apoptosis of NRK-52E cells in vitro. These data indicate that the cytochrome P-450/EET system offers a novel therapeutic strategy to treat or prevent CNI-induced nephrotoxicity.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30400131>The Immunomodulatory and Anti-Inflammatory Role of Polyphenols.</a></h2><p>This review offers a systematic understanding about how polyphenols target multiple inflammatory components and lead to anti-inflammatory mechanisms. It provides a clear understanding of the molecular mechanisms of action of phenolic compounds. Polyphenols regulate immunity by interfering with immune cell regulation, proinflammatory cytokines' synthesis, and gene expression. They inactivate NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) and modulate mitogen-activated protein Kinase (MAPk) and  acids pathways. Polyphenolic compounds inhibit phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases/protein kinase B (PI3K/AkT), inhibitor of kappa kinase/c-Jun amino-terminal kinases (IKK/JNK), mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) which is a protein complex that controls protein synthesis, and JAK/STAT. They can suppress toll-like receptor (TLR) and pro-inflammatory genes' expression. Their antioxidant activity and ability to inhibit enzymes involved in the production of eicosanoids contribute as well to their anti-inflammation properties. They inhibit certain enzymes involved in reactive  species ROS production like xanthine oxidase and NADPH oxidase (NOX) while they upregulate other endogenous antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione (GSH) peroxidase (Px). Furthermore, they inhibit phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) leading to a reduction in the production of prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes (LTs) and inflammation antagonism. The effects of these biologically active compounds on the immune system are associated with extended health benefits for different chronic inflammatory diseases. Studies of plant extracts and compounds show that polyphenols can play a beneficial role in the prevention and the progress of chronic diseases related to inflammation such as diabetes, obesity, neurodegeneration, cancers, and cardiovascular diseases, among other conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29902569>Resolvin E1 and its precursor 18R-HEPE restore mitochondrial function in inflammation.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory disorders such as sepsis are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Mitochondrial dysfunction is considered a key factor in the pathogenesis of severe inflammation. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the impact of , omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids, and n-3-derived lipid mediators 18R-HEPE and resolvin (Rv) E1 on mitochondrial function in experimental inflammation. The results revealed that, in contrast to n-6 and n-3 fatty acids, both 18R-HEPE and RvE1 possess anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties. Both mediators are able to restore inflammation-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, which is characterized by a decrease in mitochondrial respiration and membrane potential, as well as an imbalance of mitochondrial fission and fusion. Furthermore, inhibition of mitochondrial fission by Mdivi-1 and Dynasore reduces levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. These results suggest a novel functional mechanism for the beneficial effects of RvE1 in inflammatory reactions.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Many metabolic events have been identified during the injury and repair process. Nonetheless, the cellular events that control the pathogenesis of inflammation-induced disease have not been fully characterized. We and others reason that chronic inflammatory diseases associated with a cascade of complex network mediators, such as nitric oxide,  metabolites, cytokines, and reactive  species, play a significant role in the governance of alterations in homeostasis, oxidative stress, and thromboatherosclerosis. In this context, we discuss lipid mediators associated with the maintenance of health, including the specialized proresolving mediators that help drive cellular repair. Emphasis is placed on the pathophysiology of chronic metabolic insults involving both the airways and the cardiovascular system during oxidant-driven inflammatory disease. In this review, we highlight new pathways of inquiry that show promise for the identification of those metabolic targets that can improve therapy for chronic inflammation.Copyright © 2016 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

Furchgott concluded that nitric oxide, a compound traditionally known to be a toxic component of fuel exhaust, is in fact released from the endothelium, and in a paracrine fashion, induces relaxation of underlying vascular smooth muscle resulting in vasodilation. This discovery has helped pave the way for a more thorough understanding of vascular intercellular and intracellular communication that supports the process of regulating regional perfusion to match the local tissue  demand. Vasoregulation is controlled not only by endothelial release of a diverse class of vasoactive compounds such as nitric oxide,  metabolites, and reactive  species, but also by physical forces on the vascular wall and through electrotonic conduction through gap junctions. Although the endothelium is a critical source of vasoactive compounds, paracrine mediators can also be released from surrounding parenchyma such as perivascular fat, myocardium, and cells in the arterial adventitia to exert either local or remote vasomotor effects. The focus of this review will highlight the various means by which intercellular communication contributes to mechanisms of vasodilation. Paracrine signaling and parenchymal influences will be reviewed as well as regional vessel communication through gap junctions, connexons, and myoendothelial feedback. More recent modes of communication such as vesicular and microRNA signaling will also be discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28403673>Mechanisms Mediating Functional Hyperemia in the Brain.</a></h2><p>Neuronal activity within the brain evokes local increases in blood flow, a response termed functional hyperemia. This response ensures that active neurons receive sufficient  and nutrients to maintain tissue function and health. In this review, we discuss the functions of functional hyperemia, the types of vessels that generate the response, and the signaling mechanisms that mediate neurovascular coupling, the communication between neurons and blood vessels. Neurovascular coupling signaling is mediated primarily by the vasoactive metabolites of  (AA), by nitric oxide, and by K. While much is known about these pathways, many contentious issues remain. We highlight two controversies, the role of glial cell Ca signaling in mediating neurovascular coupling and the importance of capillaries in generating functional hyperemia. We propose signaling pathways that resolve these controversies. In this scheme, capillary dilations are generated by Ca increases in astrocyte endfeet, leading to production of AA metabolites. In contrast, arteriole dilations are generated by Ca increases in neurons, resulting in production of nitric oxide and AA metabolites.  from neurons also diffuses into astrocyte endfeet where it is converted into additional vasoactive metabolites. While this scheme resolves several discrepancies in the field, many unresolved challenges remain and are discussed in the final section of the review.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27932305>Scavenging of highly reactive gamma-ketoaldehydes attenuates cognitive dysfunction associated with epileptogenesis.</a></h2><p>Cognitive dysfunction is a major comorbidity of the epilepsies; however, treatments targeting seizure-associated cognitive dysfunction, particularly deficits in learning and memory are not available. Isoketals and neuroketals, collectively known as gamma-ketoaldehydes are formed via the non-enzymatic, free radical catalyzed oxidation of  and docosahexaenoic , respectively. They are attractive candidates for oxidative protein damage and resultant cognitive dysfunction due to their formation within the plasma membrane and their high proclivity to form cytotoxic adducts on protein lysine residues. We tested the hypothesis that gamma-ketoaldehydes mechanistically contribute to seizure-associated memory impairment using a specific gamma-ketoaldehyde scavenger, salicylamine in the kainic  and pilocarpine rat models of temporal lobe epilepsy. We show that gamma-ketoaldehydes are increased following epileptogenic injury in hippocampus and perirhinal cortex, two brain regions imperative for learning and memory. Treatment with an orally bioavailable, brain permeable scavenger, salicylamine attenuated 1) spatial memory deficits 2) reference memory deficits and 3) neuronal loss and astrogliosis in two mechanistically distinct models of epilepsy without affecting the epileptogenic injury or the development of chronic epilepsy. We have previously demonstrated that reactive  species and the lipid peroxidation biomarkers, F-isoprostanes are produced following status epilepticus. However, which reactive species specifically mediate oxidative damage to cellular macromolecules remains at large. We provide novel data suggesting that memory impairment occurs via gamma-ketoaldehyde production in two models of epilepsy and that treatment with a gamma-ketoaldehyde scavenger can protect vulnerable neurons. This work suggests a novel target and therapy to treat seizure-induced memory deficits in epilepsy.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Beyond this metabolic dilation, the microvasculature plays a critical role in modulating vascular tone by endothelial release of an unusually diverse family of compounds including nitric oxide, other reactive  species, and  metabolites. Animal models have provided excellent insight into mechanisms of vasoregulation in health and disease. However, there are unique aspects of the human microcirculation that serve as the focus of this review. The concept is put forth that vasculoparenchymal communication is multimodal, with vascular release of nitric oxide eliciting dilation and preserving normal parenchymal function by inhibiting inflammation and proliferation. Likewise, in disease or stress, endothelial release of reactive  species mediates both dilation and parenchymal inflammation leading to cellular dysfunction, thrombosis, and fibrosis. Some pathways responsible for this stress-induced shift in mediator of vasodilation are proposed. This paradigm may help explain why microvascular dysfunction is such a powerful predictor of cardiovascular events and help identify new approaches to treatment and prevention.© 2016 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29159716>Rotula aquatica Lour attenuates secretion of proinflammatory mediators and cytokines in lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory responses in murine RAW 264.7 macrophages.</a></h2><p>Rotula aquatica belongs to the family Boraginaceae, and is reported to contain baunerol, steroids and alkaloids. In Ayurveda, R. aquatica has been used for the treatment of various diseases such as diabetes, treatment of piles, venereal disease, and cancer. The current study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of methanolic extract of R. aquatica (MERA) in RAW 264.7 cells. The cytotoxicity of MERA was analyzed by MTT assay. The total cyclooxygenase (COX) activity, 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) activity, myeloperoxidase activity, inducible nitric oxide synthase activity, nitrate level and reactive  species production were studied in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. The gene level expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were also evaluated in this study. The MERA did not show any cytotoxicity at different concentrations (6.25-100 µg/ml). MERA (100 μg/ml) inhibited total COX and 5-LOX activity at 50.53 and 62.03%, respectively, besides significantly (p < 0.05) diminished nitrate and ROS generation, when compared with LPS control. Moreover, MERA down-regulated the mRNA expressions of inflammatory marker genes like TNF-α, IL-6, and COX-2 against LPS stimulation.

AA exerts as a second messenger to regulate various signaling components which may be involved in different pathophysiological processes. Astrocytes are the main types of CNS resident cells which maintain and support the physiological function of brain. AA has been shown to induce ROS generation through activation of NADPH oxidases (Noxs) which may play a key role in the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the mechanisms underlying AA-induced HO-1 expression in rat brain astrocytes (RBA-1). We found that AA induced HO-1 protein and mRNA expression and promoter activity in RBA-1, which was mediated through the synthesis of 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin D-activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) receptors. This note was confirmed by transfection with PPARγ small interfering RNAs (siRNA) which attenuated the AA-mediated responses. AA-induced HO-1 expression was mediated through Nox/ROS generation, which was inhibited by Nox inhibitors (diphenyleneiodonium and apocynin) and ROS scavengers (N-acetyl cysteine). Moreover, AA-induced HO-1 expression was mediated through phosphorylation of Src, Pyk2, platelet-derived growth factor, PI3K/Akt, and ERK1/2 which were inhibited by the pharmacological inhibitors including PP1, PF431396, AG1296, LY294002, and U0126 or by transfection with respective siRNAs. AA-enhanced Nrf2 expression and HO-1 promoter activity was inhibited by transfection with Nrf2 siRNA or by these pharmacological inhibitors. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed that Nrf2 and PPARγ were associated with the proximal antioxidant response element (ARE)-binding site on HO-1 promoter, suggesting that Nrf2/PPARγ are key transcription factors modulating HO-1 expression. AA-induced ARE promoter activity was also reduced by these pharmacological inhibitors. These findings suggested that AA increases formation of Nrf2 and PPARγ complex and binding with ARE1 binding site through Src, Pyk2, PI3K/Akt, and ERK1/2, which further induced HO-1 expression in RBA-1 cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28818745>A systematic review on the role of eicosanoid pathways in rheumatoid arthritis.</a></h2><p>Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by the production of eicosanoids, cytokines, adhesion molecules, infiltration of T and B lymphocytes in the synovium and  reduction accompanied by the cartilage degradation.

Although the close relationship of brain glia known as astrocytes with cerebral blood vessels has long been recognized, it is only recently that these cells have been demonstrated to translate information on the activity level and energy demands of neurons to the vasculature. In particular, astrocytes respond to elevations in extracellular glutamate as a consequence of synaptic transmission through the activation of group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors. These Gq-protein coupled receptors elevate intracellular calcium via IP3 signaling. A close examination of astrocyte endfeet calcium signals has been shown to cause either vasoconstriction or vasodilation. Common to both vasomotor responses is the generation of  in astrocytes by calcium sensitive phospholipase A2. Vasoconstriction ensues from the conversion of  to 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic , while vasodilation ensues from the production of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids or prostaglandins. Factors that determine whether constrictor or dilatory pathways predominate include brain , lactate, adenosine as well as nitric oxide.

Cortical neurons were treated with NST at indicate concentrations for 30min prior to injury and OGD injured neurons were incubated with normal conditions for 0-24h. The best neuroprotective effect of NST against OGD-induced injury occurred at 10μM. All data indicated that the neuroprotective effect of NST against OGD-induced injury resulted from blocking anandamide membrane transporter (AMT) (IC=11.74nM) and inhibiting fatty  amide hydrolase activity (FAAH) (IC=16.54nM). Our findings demonstrated that NST has an important role in cerebral ischemic injury pathological progression through activating cannabinoid receptors by inhibiting AEA inactivation system. These data suggested a potential role for NST in the therapeutic consideration of cerebral ischemic injury. However, inhibition of AEA inactivation system may provide a neuroprotective effect during cerebral ischemic injury.Copyright © 2017.

Besides providing physical properties to cell membranes, these PUFAs are metabolically active and undergo turnover through the "deacylation-reacylation (Land's) cycle". Recent studies suggest a Yin-Yang mechanism for metabolism of ARA and DHA, largely due to different phospholipases A (PLAs) mediating their release. ARA and DHA are substrates of cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases resulting in an array of lipid mediators, which are pro-inflammatory and pro-resolving. The PUFAs are susceptible to peroxidation by  free radicals, resulting in the production of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) from ARA and 4-hydroxyhexenal (4-HHE) from DHA. These alkenal electrophiles are reactive and capable of forming adducts with proteins, phospholipids and nucleic acids. The perceived cytotoxic and hormetic effects of these hydroxyl-alkenals have impacted cell signaling pathways, glucose metabolism and mitochondrial functions in chronic and inflammatory diseases. Due to the high levels of DHA and ARA in brain phospholipids, this review is aimed at providing information on the Yin-Yang mechanisms for regulating these PUFAs and their lipid peroxidation products in the CNS, and implications of their roles in neurological disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28750656>Oligomeric amyloid-beta induces MAPK-mediated activation of brain cytosolic and calcium-independent phospholipase A in a spatial-specific manner.</a></h2><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is histopathologically characterized by the build-up of fibrillar amyloid beta (Aβ) in the form of amyloid plaques and the development of intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles consisting of aggregated hyperphosphorylated Tau. Although amyloid fibrils were originally considered responsible for AD pathogenesis, recent convincing evidence strongly implicates soluble oligomeric Aβ as the primary neurotoxic species driving disease progression. A third largely ignored pathological hallmark, originally described by Alois Alzheimer, is the presence of "adipose inclusions", suggestive of aberrant lipid metabolism. The molecular mechanisms underlying these "lipoid granules", as well as their potential link to soluble and/or fibrillar Aβ remain largely unknown. Seeking to better-understand these conundrums, we took advantage of the powerful technology of multidimensional mass spectrometry-based shotgun lipidomics and an AD transgenic mouse model overexpressing mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP E693Δ-Osaka-), where AD-like pathology and neurodegeneration occur as a consequence of oligomeric Aβ accumulation in the absence of amyloid plaques. Our results revealed for the first time that APP overexpression and oligomeric Aβ accumulation lead to an additive global accumulation of nonesterified polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) independently of amyloid plaques. Furthermore, we revealed that this accumulation is mediated by an increase in phospholipase A (PLA) activity, evidenced by an accumulation of sn-1 lysophosphatidylcholine and by MAPK-mediated phosphorylation/activation of group IV Ca-dependent cytosolic (cPLA) and the group VI Ca-independent PLA (iPLA) independently of PKC. We further revealed that Aβ-induced oxidative stress also disrupts lipid metabolism via reactive  species-mediated phospholipid cleavage leading to increased sn-2 lysophosphatidylcholine as well as lipid peroxidation and the subsequent accumulation of 4-hydroxynonenal. Brain histological studies implicated cPLA activity with  accumulation within myelin-rich regions, and iPLA activity with docosahexaenoic  accumulation within pyramidal neuron-rich regions. Taken together, our results suggest that PLA-mediated accumulation of free PUFAs drives AD-related disruption of brain lipid metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28396419>Cyclooxygenase-derived proangiogenic metabolites of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids.</a></h2><p> (ARA) is metabolized by cyclooxygenase (COX) and cytochrome P450 to produce proangiogenic metabolites. Specifically, epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) produced from the P450 pathway are angiogenic, inducing cancer tumor growth. A previous study showed that inhibiting soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) increased EET concentration and mildly promoted tumor growth. However, inhibiting both sEH and COX led to a dramatic decrease in tumor growth, suggesting that the contribution of EETs to angiogenesis and subsequent tumor growth may be attributed to downstream metabolites formed by COX. This study explores the fate of EETs with COX, the angiogenic activity of the primary metabolites formed, and their subsequent hydrolysis by sEH and microsomal EH. Three EET regioisomers were found to be substrates for COX, based on  consumption and product formation. EET substrate preference for both COX-1 and COX-2 were estimated as 8,9-EET > 5,6-EET > 11,12-EET, whereas 14,15-EET was inactive. The structure of two major products formed from 8,9-EET in this COX pathway were confirmed by chemical synthesis: -8,9-epoxy-11-hydroxy-eicosatrienoic  (-8,9-E-11-HET) and -8,9-epoxy-15-hydroxy-eicosatrienoic  (-8,9-E-15-HET). -8,9-E-11-HET and -8,9-E-15-HET are further metabolized by sEH, with -8,9-E-11-HET being hydrolyzed much more slowly. Using an s.c. Matrigel assay, we showed that -8,9-E-11-HET is proangiogenic, whereas -8,9-E-15-HET is not active. This study identifies a functional link between EETs and COX and identifies -8,9-E-11-HET as an angiogenic lipid, suggesting a physiological role for COX metabolites of EETs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28093240>The crystal structure of Pseudomonas aeruginosa lipoxygenase Ala420Gly mutant explains the improved  affinity and the altered reaction specificity.</a></h2><p>Secreted LOX from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA-LOX) has previously been identified as  15S-lipoxygenating enzyme. Here we report that the substitution of Ala420Gly in PA-LOX leads to an enzyme variant with pronounced dual specificity favoring  11R-oxygenation. When compared with other LOX-isoforms the molecular  affinity of wild-type PA-LOX is 1-2 orders of magnitude lower (Km O of 0.4mM) but Ala420Gly exchange improved the molecular  affinity (Km O of 0.2mM). Experiments with stereo-specifically deuterated linoleic  indicated that the formation of both 13S- and 9R-HpODE involves abstraction of the proS-hydrogen from C11 of the fatty  backbone. To explore the structural basis for the observed functional changes (altered specificity, improved molecular  affinity) we solved the crystal structure of the Ala420Gly mutant of PA-LOX at 1.8Å resolution and compared it with the wild-type enzyme. Modeling of fatty  alignment at the catalytic center suggested that in the wild-type enzyme dioxygen is directed to C15 of  by a protein tunnel, which interconnects the catalytic center with the protein surface. Ala420Gly exchange redirects intra-enzyme O diffusion by bifurcating this tunnel so that C11 of  also becomes accessible for O insertion.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Impaired HPV may cause systemic hypoxemia, while generalized HPV contributes to the development of pulmonary hypertension. The triggering mechanisms underlying HPV are still not fully elucidated. Several hypotheses are currently under debate, including a possible decrease as well as an increase in reactive  species as a triggering event. Recent findings suggest an increase in the production of reactive  species in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells by complex III of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and occurrence of  sensing at complex IV. Other essential components are voltage-dependent potassium and possibly L-type, transient receptor potential channel 6, and transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 channels. The release of  metabolites appears also to be involved in HPV regulation. Further investigation of the HPV mechanisms will facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of HPV-related disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27784678>Oxyradical stress increases the biosynthesis of 2-arachidonoylglycerol: involvement of NADPH oxidase.</a></h2><p>NADPH oxidase (Nox)-derived oxyradicals contribute to atherosclerosis by oxidizing low-density lipoproteins (LDL), leading to their phagocytosis by vascular macrophages. Endocannabinoids, such as 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), might be an important link between oxidative stress and atherosclerosis. We hypothesized that 2-AG biosynthesis in macrophages is enhanced following ligation of oxidized LDL by scavenger receptors via a signal transduction pathway involving Nox-derived ROS that activates diacylglycerol lipase-β (DAGL-β), the 2-AG biosynthetic enzyme. To test this idea, we challenged macrophage cell lines and murine primary macrophages with a xanthine oxidase system or with nonphysiological and physiological Nox stimulants [phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and  (AA)]. Each stressor increased cellular superoxide levels and enhanced 2-AG biosynthetic activity in a Nox-dependent manner. Levels of cytosolic phospholipase A-dependent AA metabolites (eicosanoids) in primary macrophages were also dependent on Nox-mediated ROS. In addition, 2-AG levels in DAGL-β-overexpressing COS7 cells were attenuated by inhibitors of Nox and DAGL-β. Furthermore, ROS induced by menadione (a redox cycling agent) or PMA could be partially attenuated by the cannabinoid 1/2 receptor agonist (WIN 55,212-2). Finally, cells that overexpress Nox2 components (Phox-COS7) synthesized larger amounts of 2-AG compared with the parental COS7 cells. Together, the results suggest a positive correlation between heightened  radical flux and 2-AG biosynthesis in macrophage cell lines and primary macrophages. Because of the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects associated with 2-AG, the increased levels of this bioactive lipid might be an adaptive response to oxidative stress. Thus oxyradical stress may be counteracted by the enhanced endocannabinoid tone.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27085073>Ultra-trace graphene oxide in a water environment triggers Parkinson's disease-like symptoms and metabolic disturbance in zebrafish larvae.</a></h2><p>Over the past decade, the safety of nanomaterials has attracted attention due to their rapid development. The relevant health threat of these materials remains largely unknown, particularly at environmentally or biologically relevant ultra-trace concentrations. To address this, we first found that graphene oxide (GO, a carbon nanomaterial that receives extensive attention across various disciplines) at concentrations of 0.01 μg/L-1 μg/L induced Parkinson's disease-like symptoms in zebrafish larvae. In this model, zebrafish showed a loss of more than 90% of dopamine neurons, a 69-522% increase in Lewy bodies (α-synuclein and ubiquitin) and significantly disturbed locomotive activity. Moreover, it was also shown that GO was able to translocate from the water environment to the brain and localize to the nucleus of the diencephalon, thereby inducing structural and morphological damage in the mitochondria. Cell apoptosis and senescence were triggered via oxidative stress, as shown by the upregulation of caspase 8 and β-galactosidase. Using metabolomics, we found that the upregulation of amino  and some fatty acids (e.g. dodecanoic , hexadecanoic , octadecenoic , nonanoic , , eicosanoic , propanoic  and benzenedicarboxylic ) metabolism and the downregulation of some other fatty acids (e.g. butanoic , phthalic  and docosenoic ) are linked to these Parkinson's disease-like symptoms. These findings broaden our understanding of nanomaterial safety at ultra-trace concentrations.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

One such factor is the potentially atherogenic effect of lead (Pb) on lipid metabolism, and is significant in view of the still considerable Pb environmental pollution and the non-degradability of Pb compounds.Analysis of saturated fatty acids (SFA) (caprylic  (C8:0), decanoic  (C10:0), lauric  (C12:0), tridecanoic  (C13:0), myristic  (C14:0), pentadecanoic  (C15:0), palmitic  (C16:0), heptadecanoic  (C17:0), stearic  (C18:0), and behenic  (C22:0)), monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA) (palmitoleic  (C16:1), oleic  (18:1w9), trans-vaccenic  (C18:1 trans11)), and polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) (linoleic  (C18:2n6), gamma-linolenic  (C18:3n6),  (C20:4n6)), was conducted by gas chromatography. Analysis of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), fatty  desaturase 1 (FADS1) and fatty  desaturase 2 (FADS2) expression was performed using qRT-PCR. Oxidative stress intensity (malondialdehyde - MDA concentration) was measured using spectrophotometric method. Intracellular generation of reactive  species (ROS) in macrophages was visualized by fluorescence microscopy and quantitatively measured by plate reader.Pb caused quantitative alterations in FAs profile in macrophages; the effect was Pb-concentration dependent and selective (i.e. concerned only selected FAs). In general, the effect of Pb was biphasic, with Pb levels of 1.25 μg/dL and 2.5 μg/dL being stimulatory, and 10 μg/dL being inhibitory on concentrations of selected FAs. The most potent Pb concentration, resulting in increase in levels of 9 FAs, was 2.5 μg/dL, the Pb-level corresponding to the mean blood Pb concentrations of people living in urban areas not contaminated by Pb. Pb was found to exert similar, biphasic effect on the expression of FADS1. However, Pb decreased, in a concentration-dependent manner, the expression of SCD and FADS2. Pb significantly increased MDA and ROS concentration in macrophages.Environmental Pb exposure might be a risk factor resulting in alterations in FAs levels, oxidative stress and increased MDA concentration in macrophages, which might lead to the formation of foam cells and to inflammatory reactions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Miers is known for its therapeutic value in Indian traditional medicine for treating diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, jaundice and cardiac diseases. However, information regarding its protective role against inflammatory diseases at the molecular level is limited.The objective of the present work is to study the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect of alcoholic and water extracts of T. cordifolia (Willd.) Miers leaves in activated human monocytic THP-1 cells.Phytochemical analyses of the dry leaf extracts of T. cordifolia (Willd.) Miers prepared using the solvents alcohol (TCAE) or water (TCWE) are performed employing spectrophotometric methods for estimating total phenolic and flavonoid content, and the plant material was authenticated by detecting T. cordifolia (Willd.) Miers metabolite biomarkers using LC-MS/MS.  (AA)- and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated human monocytic (THP-1) cells were used as experimental models to investigate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of the plant extracts.  (AA)-induced reactive  species (ROS) in THP-1 cells were monitored by confocal microscopy/spectrofluorimetry and transcript of antioxidant enzyme catalase (CAT), by quantitative real time PCR. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced proinflammatory marker like TNF-α at transcription and protein levels in THP-1 cells were measured by quantitative real-time PCR or ELISA respectively. Further, the effect of T. cordifolia (Willd.) Miers extracts on LPS-induced NF-κB translocation, and IκB and P-IκB protein levels, were studied by immunoblotting and confocal microscopy.T. cordifolia (Willd.) Miers extracts exhibited significant amounts of total phenolic and flavonoid content, and LC-MS/MS analyses detected tinosponone, a TC-specific clerodane-derived diterpene. Both types of extracts attenuated AA-induced ROS generation via enhancing catalase enzyme activity in THP-1 cells. Real time PCR and ELISA experiments revealed that the elevated levels of LPS-induced TNF-α was remarkably attenuated in THP-1 cells pretreated with T. cordifolia (Willd.) Miers extracts. Western blot and confocal microscopy showed that the alcoholic extract's anti-inflammatory activity by attenuating NF-κB translocation into the nucleus in LPS-activated THP-1 cells via the inhibition of IκB degradation in the cytosol.Our findings suggest that T. cordifolia (Willd.)

Several iodinated lipids, biosynthesized by the thyroid, were postulated as intermediaries in the action of iodide. Among these, iodolactone (IL-δ) and 2-iodohexadecanal (2-IHDA) have shown to inhibit several thyroid parameters. The antiproliferative effect of IL-δ is not restricted to the thyroid gland. IL-δ exhibits anti-tumor properties in breast cancer, neuroblastoma, glioblastoma, melanoma and lung carcinoma cells suggesting that IL-δ could be used as a chemotherapeutic agent. Moreover in a colon cancer cell line (HT-29), IL-δ induced cell death, and this effect was mediated by reactive  species (ROS) generation. The aim of the present study was to analyze the sources of reactive  species induced by IL-δ and to explore the contribution of ROS induced by IL-δ on cell proliferation and apoptosis.Cancer thyroid follicular (WRO) and papilar (TPC-1) cells lines were treated with IL-δ. Proliferation and apoptosis was analyzed. IL-δ caused a significant loss of cell viability on WRO and TPC-1 cells in a concentration dependent manner and induced apoptosis after 3 h of treatment. Furthermore, IL-δ (10 μM) increased ROS production (39% WRO and 20% TPC-1). The concomitant treatment of WRO and TPC-1 cells with Trolox or NAC plus IL-δ abrogated the augment of ROS induced by IL-δ exposure. Additionally Trolox and NAC reversed the effect of IL-δ on cell proliferation and apoptosis. Only in WRO cells IL-δ upregulates NADPH oxidase NOX4 expression, and siRNA targeted knock-down of NOX4 attenuates ROS production, apoptosis (p < 0.05) and the inhibitory effect of IL-δ on cell proliferation and PCNA expression (p < 0.05).The antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effect of IL-δ is mediated by different mechanisms and pathway involving different sources of ROS generation depending on the cellular context.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The essence of the microinflammatory state is the innate immune response, which is central to the occurrence and development of DN. Members of the inflammasome family, including both "receptors" and "regulators", are key to the inflammatory immune response. Nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) and other inflammasome components are able to detect endogenous danger signals, resulting in activation of caspase-1 as well as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-18 and other cytokines; these events stimulate the inflammatory cascade reaction, which is crucial for DN. Hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia and hyperuricaemia can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, which then mediates the occurrence and development of DN through the K channel model, the lysosomal damage model and the active  cluster model. In this review, we survey the involvement of the NLRP3 inflammasome in various signalling pathways and highlight different aspects of their influence on DN. We also explore the important effects of the NLRP3 inflammasome on kidney function and structural changes that occur during DN development and progression. It is becoming more evident that NLRP3 inflammasome targeting has therapeutic potential for the treatment of DN.Copyright © 2016.

Recently we reported that centrally injected AA generated pressor and hyperventilation effects by activating thromboxane A (TXA) signaling pathway. The present study was designed to investigate the mediation of other metabolites of AA such as prostaglandin (PG) D, PGE and PGF alongside TXA in the AA-evoked cardiorespiratory effects in anaesthetized rats. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of AA caused pressor, bradycardic and hyperventilation responses by increasing pO and decreasing pCO in adult male anaesthetized Sprague Dawley rats. Pretreatment (i.c.v) with different doses of DP/EP prostanoid receptor antagonist, AH6809 or FP prostanoid receptor antagonist, PGF dimethylamine partially blocked the cardiorespiratory and blood gas changes induced by AA. In conclusion, these data plainly report that central PGD, PGE or PGF might mediate, at least partly, centrally administered AA-evoked cardiorespiratory and blood gas responses.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, we wondered whether salinomycin has another effect such as an anti-oxidant and hepatic protectant, because some chemical drugs treating human diseases were sometimes related with their toxic effects. Therefore, this study was conducted to examine the effects of salinomycin against oxidative stress and mitochondrial impairment in vivo and in vitro as well as the cellular mechanisms of action. In hepatocyte, salinomycin inhibited  (AA) + iron-induced apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production. As a molecular mechanism, salinomycin induced autophagy through AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, as assessed by the accumulation of acidic vesicle organelles, p62 and LC3-II. Moreover, these protective effects were blocked by AMPK inhibition, which indicates the importance of AMPK in the process of salinomycin's effects. In mice, oral administration of salinomycin protected against carbon tetrachloride (CCl)-induced oxidative stress and liver injury, and also activated AMPK as well as autophagy-related proteins in the liver. Collectively, salinomycin had the ability to protect hepatocytes against AA+iron-induced reactive  species production and mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as CCl-induced liver injury. Although this beneficial effect was demonstrated under severe oxidative stress, this study showed that salinomycin protected the liver against the oxidative stress and liver damage through AMPK and autophagy, and suggest that salinomycin has a possibility to treat a broad range of diseases.Copyright © 2018.
