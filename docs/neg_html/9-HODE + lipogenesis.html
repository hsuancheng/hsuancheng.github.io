Although synthetic agonists for PPARgamma are widely used as insulin sensitizers, the identity of the natural ligand(s) for PPARgamma is still not clear. Suggested natural ligands include 15-deoxy-delta12,14-prostaglandin J2 and oxidized fatty acids such as  and 13-HODE. Crystal structures of PPARgamma have revealed the mode of recognition for synthetic compounds. Here we report structures of PPARgamma bound to oxidized fatty acids that are likely to be natural ligands for this receptor. These structures reveal that the receptor can (i) simultaneously bind two fatty acids and (ii) couple covalently with conjugated oxo fatty acids. Thermal stability and gene expression analyses suggest that such covalent ligands are particularly effective activators of PPARgamma and thus may serve as potent and biologically relevant ligands.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26538237>Adipogenic role of alternatively activated macrophages in β-adrenergic remodeling of white adipose tissue.</a></h2><p>De novo brown adipogenesis involves the proliferation and differentiation of progenitors, yet the mechanisms that guide these events in vivo are poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that treatment with a β3-adrenergic receptor (ADRB3) agonist triggers brown/beige adipogenesis in gonadal white adipose tissue following adipocyte death and clearance by tissue macrophages. The close physical relationship between adipocyte progenitors and tissue macrophages suggested that the macrophages that clear dying adipocytes might generate proadipogenic factors. Flow cytometric analysis of macrophages from mice treated with CL 316,243 identified a subpopulation that contained elevated lipid and expressed CD44. Lipidomic analysis of fluorescence-activated cell sorting-isolated macrophages demonstrated that CD44+ macrophages contained four- to five-fold higher levels of the endogenous peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) ligands 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE), and 13-HODE compared with CD44- macrophages. Gene expression profiling and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that ADRB3 agonist treatment upregulated expression of ALOX15, the lipoxygenase responsible for generating  and 13-HODE. Using an in vitro model of adipocyte efferocytosis, we found that IL-4-primed tissue macrophages accumulated lipid from dying fat cells and upregulated expression of Alox15. Furthermore, treatment of differentiating adipocytes with  and 13-HODE potentiated brown/beige adipogenesis. Collectively, these data indicate that noninflammatory removal of adipocyte remnants and coordinated generation of PPARγ ligands by M2 macrophages provides localized adipogenic signals to support de novo brown/beige adipogenesis.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28303483>Proliferation and differentiation of adipose tissue in prolonged lean and obese critically ill patients.</a></h2><p>In prolonged non-obese critically ill patients, preservation of adipose tissue is prioritized over that of the skeletal muscle and coincides with increased adipogenesis. However, we recently demonstrated that in obese critically ill mice, this priority was switched. In the obese, the use of abundantly available adipose tissue-derived  substrates was preferred and counteracted muscle wasting. These observations suggest that different processes are ongoing in adipose tissue of lean vs. overweight/obese critically ill patients.We hypothesize that to preserve adipose tissue mass during critical illness, adipogenesis is increased in prolonged lean critically ill patients, but not in overweight/obese critically ill patients, who enter the ICU with excess adipose tissue. To test this, we studied markers of adipogenesis in subcutaneous and visceral biopsies of matched lean (n = 24) and overweight/obese (n = 24) prolonged critically ill patients. Secondly, to further unravel the underlying mechanism of critical illness-induced adipogenesis, local production of eicosanoid PPARγ agonists was explored, as well as the adipogenic potential of serum from matched lean (n = 20) and overweight/obese (n = 20) critically ill patients.The number of small adipocytes, PPARγ protein, and CEBPB expression were equally upregulated (p ≤ 0.05) in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue biopsies of lean and overweight/obese prolonged critically ill patients. Gene expression of key enzymes involved in eicosanoid production was reduced (COX1, HPGDS, LPGDS, ALOX15, all p ≤ 0.05) or unaltered (COX2, ALOX5) during critical illness, irrespective of obesity. Gene expression of PLA2G2A and ALOX15B was upregulated in lean and overweight/obese patients (p ≤ 0.05), whereas their end products, the PPARγ-activating metabolites 15s-HETE and , were not increased in the adipose tissue. In vitro, serum of lean and overweight/obese prolonged critically ill patients equally stimulated adipocyte proliferation (p ≤ 0.05) and differentiation (lipid accumulation, DLK1, and CEBPB expression, p ≤ 0.05).Contrary to what was hypothesized, adipogenesis increased independently of initial BMI in prolonged critically ill patients. Not the production of local eicosanoid PPARγ agonists but circulating adipogenic factors seem to be involved in critical illness-induced adipogenesis. Importantly, our findings suggest that abundantly available  substrates from the adipose tissue, rather than excess adipocytes, can play a beneficial role during critical illness.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31340670>Diesel Exhaust Induces Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Hyperlipidemia, and  Steatosis.</a></h2><p>Air pollution is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, as well as dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome. Our goal was to dissect the mechanisms involved. Approach and Results: We assessed the effects of exposure to air pollution on lipid metabolism in mice through assessment of plasma lipids and lipoproteins, oxidized  acids  (9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic) and 13-HODE (13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic), lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism. Findings were corroborated, and mechanisms were further assessed in HepG2 hepatocytes in culture. ApoE knockout mice exposed to inhaled diesel exhaust (DE, 6 h/d, 5 days/wk for 16 weeks) exhibited elevated plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels, increased hepatic triglyceride content, and higher hepatic levels of  and 13-HODE, as compared to control mice exposed to filtered air. A direct effect of DE exposure on hepatocytes was demonstrated by treatment of HepG2 cells with a methanol extract of DE particles followed by loading with oleic acid. As observed in vivo, this led to increased triglyceride content and significant downregulation of ACAD9 mRNA expression. Treatment of HepG2 cells with DE particles and oleic acid did not alter de novo lipogenesis but inhibited total, mitochondrial, and ATP-linked oxygen consumption rate, indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction. Treatment of isolated mitochondria, prepared from mouse , with DE particles and oleic acid also inhibited mitochondrial complex activity and β-oxidation.DE exposure leads to dyslipidemia and  steatosis in ApoE knockout mice, likely due to mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased lipid catabolism.</p></html>
