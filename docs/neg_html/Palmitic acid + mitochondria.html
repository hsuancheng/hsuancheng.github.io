Gaench extract alleviates mitochondrial malfunction and inhibits ER stress/JNK associated inflammation in the endothelium.</a></h2><p>Tartary buckwheat is a food medicine dual-use crop with healing effects on cardiovascular diseases and type2 diabetes. It has been proposed that endothelial dysfunction is the initial lesion in these diseases and it's associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and inflammation. D-chiro-inositol (DCI) is a bioactive compound of Tartary buckwheat and is always deficit in type2 diabetes. However, it remains unknown whether DCI-enriched Tartary buckwheat extract can ameliorate mitochondrial dysfunction, ER stress and inflammation in the endothelium.Endothelial cells were treated with  (PA) and mice were fed with high fat diet (HFD). The effects of DCI-enriched Tartary buckwheat bran extract (TBBE) on superoxide anion generation, dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), mitofusin2 (Mfn2), inositol-requiring enzyme-1α (IRE1α) and Jun n-terminal kinase (JNK) activation and inflammation in the endothelium against lipotoxicity were investigated.In endothelial cells, TBBE significantly inhibited oxidative stress. Meanwhile, in HFD-fed mice and PA-induced cells, TBBE regulated Drp1 phosphorylation and inhibited its activation, implying the protective effect of TBBE on mitochondrial morphology. As a result, TBBE protected mitochondrial function. Additionally, TBBE inhibited ER stress and reduced the production of IL-6 and VCAM-1, associated with JNK pathway, thereby inhibiting the caspase-3 activation in vivo and in vitro.Taken together, this study indicated the beneficial role of TBBE in endothelial inflammation, with emphasis on mitochondrial dysfunction, ER stress and JNK activation.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The present study demonstrates that the efflux of Ca2+ from rat liver  induced by ruthenium red, an inhibitor of the energy-dependent Ca2+ influx, seems to be partly due to the opening of Pal/Ca2+ pores. Exogenous Pal stimulates the efflux. Measurements of pH showed that the Ca2+-induced alkalization of the mitochondrial matrix increased in the presence of Pal. The influx of Ca2+ (Sr2+) also induced an outflow of K+ followed by the reuptake of the ion by . The outflow was not affected by a K+/H+ exchange blocker, and the reuptake was prevented by an ATP-dependent K+ channel inhibitor. It was also shown that the addition of Sr2+ to  under hypotonic conditions was accompanied by reversible cyclic changes in the membrane potential, the concentrations of Sr2+ and K+ and the respiratory rate. The cyclic changes were effectively suppressed by the inhibitors of Ca2+-dependent phospholipase A2, and a new Sr2+ cycle could only be initiated after the previous cycle was finished, indicating a refractory period in the mitochondrial sensitivity to Sr2+. All of the Ca2+- and Sr2+-induced effects were observed in the presence of cyclosporin A. This paper discusses a possible role of Pal/Ca2+ pores in the maintenance of cell ion homeostasis.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

With ROS generation being increased in fatty liver from sucrose-fed (SF) rats, we hypothesized that cytochrome c release might be positively associated with H2O2 generation from SF . Surprisingly, cytochrome c release from  of SF liver was found to be significantly lower compared with control (C)  oxidizing pyruvate/malate or succinate. Exposure of  to exogenous superoxide radical generated by the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system elicits a dose-response cytochrome c release in both control and SF , but cytochrome c release remains lower in SF  compared with C . Furthermore, the addition of ebselen, PEG-catalase, or catalase, a H2O2 scavenger, significantly reduces cytochrome c release from C and SF . Our results suggest that both intra- and extramitochondrial H2O2 are involved in cytochrome c release, but the persisting difference between C and SF levels can be attributed to the differences in cardiolipin compositions. Indeed, the ratio of -rich cardiolipin species was found to be increased in lipid membrane from SF  compared with C , whereas that of linoleic -rich cardiolipin species was found decreased. In addition, the content of tafazzin, a protein responsible for cardiolipin remodeling, was decreased in SF . Therefore, we conclude that the changes observed in the composition of cardiolipin molecular species in SF  may be involved in cytochrome c interaction with mitochondrial inner membrane lipid and in its reduced release from SF .Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30759408>Urinary metabolomics for discovering metabolic biomarkers of laryngeal cancer using UPLC-QTOF/MS.</a></h2><p>The incidence of laryngeal cancer (LYC) is second only to lung cancer, which is also the second most common cancer in head and neck cancer. Risk assessment metabolomics biomarkers to diagnose LYC have not been found by now. To profile the metabolites in healthy controls (HCs) and LYC patients (LYCs), urine metabonomics study was performed based on reversed phase liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (RPLC-QTOF/MS). Six urine differentially expressed metabolites (Variable Importance in Projection >1, p <  0.05) were identified by searching reference library or comparing with standard based on OPLS-DA (orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis) model. d-pantothenic , , myristic , oleamide, sphinganine and phytosphingosine were identified as differential metabolites associated with the LYC and they might play roles in sphingolipid metabolism, fatty  biosynthesis, fatty  elongation in , pantothenate and coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis, beta-Alanine metabolism and fatty  metabolism. These six differential metabolites were combined to test the potentiality of diagnosis of LYC. Results revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) value, sensitivity and specificity of receiving operator characteristic (ROC) curve were 0.97, 95% and 97%, respectively, indicating that this diagnosis method could be used to distinguish LYCs from HCs with good sensitivity and specificity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Podocyte injury can lead to dysfunction of the glomerular filtration barrier, which is associated with proteinuria, a risk marker for the progression of CKD. Our previous studies demonstrated that  (PA) can induce podocyte apoptosis; however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. In the present study, we investigated the specific molecular mechanisms of PA-induced apoptosis in cultured podocytes.We cultured mouse podocytes and treated them with PA. Then, cell viability was measured using the Cell Counting Kit-8 colorimetric assay, lipid uptake was assessed by Oil Red O staining and boron-dipyrromethene staining, apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry, mitochondrial injury was assessed by JC-1 staining and transmission electron microscopy, and mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy using the MitoSOX Red reagent. The effects of PA on the -mediated caspase activation pathway were investigated by examining the expression of caspase-8, cleaved caspase-9, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bax, Bid, cytochrome c, and Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) using western blotting. The translocation of Bax and cytochrome c were detected by immunofluorescence.PA treatment significantly increased lipid accumulation and induced podocyte apoptosis. We investigated whether the two primary apoptosis signaling pathways (death receptor-mediated pathway and -mediated pathway) were involved in the execution of PA-induced podocyte apoptosis, and found that the levels of FADD, caspase-8, and Bid did not significantly change during this process. Meanwhile, PA treatment induced an increase in Bax protein expression and a decrease in Bcl-2 protein expression, with Bax translocation to the . Furthermore, PA treatment induced mitochondrial impairment, and triggered the release of cytochrome c from the  to cytosol, with a concomitant dose-dependent increase in the levels of cleaved caspase-9, cleaved caspase-3, and PARP. Meanwhile, PA treatment increased mitochondrial production of ROS, and the -targeted antioxidant mitoTEMPO significantly ameliorated PA-induced podocyte apoptosis.Our findings indicated that PA induced caspase-dependent podocyte apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway, and mitochondrial ROS production participated in this process, thus potentially contributing to podocyte injury.© 2018 The Author(s).

Aggregation and membrane permeabilization.</a></h2><p>The paper examines membranotropic Ca-dependent effects of ω-hydroxypalmitic  (HPA), a product of ω-oxidation of fatty acids, on the isolated rat liver  and artificial membrane systems (liposomes). It was established that in the presence of Ca, HPA induced aggregation of liver , which was accompanied by the release of cytochrome c from the organelles. It was further demonstrated that the addition of Ca to HPA-containing liposomes induced their aggregation and/or fusion. Ca also caused the release of the fluorescent dye sulforhodamine B from liposomes, indicating their permeabilization. HPA was shown to induce a high-amplitude swelling of Ca-loaded , to decrease their membrane potential, to induce the release of Ca from the organelles and to result in the oxidation of the mitochondrial NAD(P)H pool. Those effects of HPA were not blocked by the MPT pore inhibitor CsA, but were suppressed by the mitochondrial calcium uniporter inhibitor ruthenium red. The effects of HPA were also observed when Ca was replaced with Sr (but not with Ba or Mg). A supposition is made that HPA can induce a Ca-dependent aggregation of , as well as Cadependent CsA-insensitive permeabilization of the inner mitochondrial membrane - with the subsequent lysis of the organelles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907226>Dual roles of ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1) in cytoprotection against lipotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Saturated fatty  (SFA)-induced lipotoxicity is caused by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is associated with damaged . Moreover, lipotoxicity is crucial for the progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Autophagy is required for the clearance of protein aggregates or damaged  to maintain cellular metabolic homeostasis. The NFE2L2/NRF2 (nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2)-KEAP1 (kelch like ECH associated protein 1) pathway is essential for the elimination of ROS. ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1; yeast Atg1) is involved in the initiation of autophagy; however, its role in lipotoxicity-induced cell death in hepatocytes and mouse liver has not been elucidated. We now show that ULK1 potentiates the interaction between KEAP1 and the autophagy adaptor protein SQSTM1/p62, thereby mediating NFE2L2 activation in a manner requiring SQSTM1-dependent autophagic KEAP1 degradation. Furthermore, ULK1 is required for the autophagic removal of damaged  and to enhance binding between SQSTM1 and PINK1 (PTEN induced kinase 1). This study demonstrates the molecular mechanisms underlying the cytoprotective role of ULK1 against lipotoxicity. Thus, ULK1 could represent a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of NASH.

The cellular death mechanism was studied by evaluating the translocation of phosphatidylserine (Annexin V); overproduction of reactive oxygen species [2'-7'-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay]; release of Cytochrome C; activation of caspase-3 and -9, and regulation of Bcl-2, XIAP, and PKCε proteins by Western Blot analysis. For the evaluation of the safety of Kf-EtOAc, the Ames test, Micronucleus assay, and acute toxicity study were determined.Kf-EtOAc exhibited selective cytotoxic activity against prostate cell lines as follows: PC-3, LNCaP, and PrEC (IC = 1.36 ± 0.05; 2.06 ± 0.02, and 127.05 ± 0.07 μg/mL, respectively). The F82-P2 fraction (rich in coumaric  and ) obtained by bioassay-guided fractionation of Kf-EtOAc also demonstrated selective cytotoxic activity against PC-3 cells (IC = 1.05 ± 0.06 μg/mL). Kf-EtOAc induces apoptosis by the intrinsic pathway; this mechanism of cell death was confirmed after observing that the extract produces phosphatidylserine translocation, overproduction of reactive oxygen species, release of Cytochrome C at mitochondrial level, and activation of caspase-3 and -9. It was also observed that Kf-EtOAc produces significant downregulation of apoptosis-related proteins Bcl-2, XIAP, and PKCε and induces DNA fragmentation and cell cycle arrest. In addition, Kf-EtOAc is non-genotoxic in vitro by Ames test and non-genotoxic in vivo by Micronucleus assay, and no signs of toxicity or death were reported after the administration of a single acute exposure of 2000 mg/kg.K. flammea is a potential candidate for the development of new drugs for the treatment of prostate cancer.

The increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production during glucose metabolism in β cells can be exacerbated under hyperglycaemic conditions such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), thus contributing to β cell function impairment. In the present work, we aimed to evaluate the effect of MitoQ on insulin secretion, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) signalling in a pancreatic β cell line under normoglycaemic (NG, 11.1 mM glucose), hyperglycaemic (HG, 25 mM glucose) and lipidic ( (PA), 0.5mM) conditions.We incubated the pancreatic β cell line INS-1E with or without MitoQ (0.5µM) under NG, HG and PA conditions. We then assessed the following parameters: glucose-induced insulin secretion, O₂ consumption (with a Clark-type electrode); mitochondrial function, oxidative stress parameters and calcium levels (by fluorescence microscopy); ER stress markers and NFκB-p65 protein levels (by western blotting).MitoQ increased insulin secretion and prevented the enhancement of ROS production and O₂ consumption and decrease in GSH levels that are characteristic under HG conditions. MitoQ also reduced protein levels of ER stress markers (GRP78 and P-eIF2α) and the proinflammatory nuclear transcription factor NFκB-p65, both of which increased under HG. MitoQ did not significantly alter ER stress markers under lipidic conditions.Our findings suggest that treatment with MitoQ modulates mitochondrial function, which in turn ameliorates endoplasmic reticulum stress and NFκB activation, thereby representing potential benefits for pancreatic β cell function.© Copyright by the Author(s).

However, the upstream molecular signalling pathway is still elusive. In this study, Western blot was used to evaluate the phosphorylation level of the insulin signalling pathway and the AMPK pathway. 2-NBDG was used to evaluate glucose uptake. Ca imaging was used to assess change of intracellular Ca concentration. We found that NaHS enhanced the intracellular Ca concentration and glucose uptake and activated the insulin signalling cascade in a  (PA)-induced IR model in C2C12 cells. Furthermore, activation of the IRS1/PI3K/AKT pathway and glucose uptake were decreased when AMPK or CaMKKβ was inhibited. Our study also showed that the mitochondrial electron transport chain, ATP production, and intramitochondrial cAMP declined in the IR model but that this effect was reversed by NaHS, an effect that may be mediated by the Ca/CaMKK2/AMPK and PI3K/AKT pathways. Our data indicate that HS improves activation of the insulin signalling cascade and glucose uptake via activation of the Ca/CaMKK2/AMPK pathway and mitochondrial metabolism in C2C12 cells. Furthermore, NaHS protects mitochondrial function and maintains normal ATP production by activating the cAMP system and the Ca/CaMKK2/AMPK and PI3K/ATK pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26410780>Saturated lipids decrease mitofusin 2 leading to endoplasmic reticulum stress activation and insulin resistance in hypothalamic cells.</a></h2><p>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and  dysfunction contribute to insulin resistance generation during obesity and diabetes. ER and  interact through Mitofusin 2 (MTF2), which anchors in the outer mitochondrial and ER membranes regulating energy metabolism. Ablation of MTF2 leads to ER stress activation and insulin resistance. Here we determine whether lipotoxic insult induced by saturated lipids decreases MTF2 expression leading to ER stress response in hypothalamus and its effects on insulin sensitivity using in vitro and in vivo models. We found that lipotoxic stimulation induced by , but not the monounsaturated palmitoleic , decreases MTF2 protein levels in hypothalamic mHypoA-CLU192 cells. Also,  incubation activates ER stress response evidenced by increase in the protein levels of GRP78/BIP marker at later stage than MTF2 downregulation. Additionally, we found that MTF2 alterations induced by , but not palmitoleic, stimulation exacerbate insulin resistance in hypothalamic cells. Insulin resistance induced by  is prevented by pre-incubation of the anti-inflammatory and the ER stress release reagents, sodium salicylate and 4 phenylbutirate, respectively. Finally, we demonstrated that lipotoxic insult induced by high fat feeding to mice decreases MTF2 proteins levels in arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus. Our data indicate that saturated lipids modulate MTF2 expression in hypothalamus coordinating the ER stress response and the susceptibility to insulin resistance.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Measures of mitochondrial metabolism, as reflected by oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and cytochrome c reduction, calcium signaling, and ISR by rat islets were used to evaluate processes stimulated by acute exposure to  (PA). The contribution of mitochondrial oxidation of PA was determined in the presence and absence of a blocker of mitochondrial transport of fatty acids (etomoxir) at different glucose concentrations. Subsequent to increasing glucose from 3 to 20 mM, PA caused small increases in OCR and cytosolic calcium (about 20% of the effect of glucose). In contrast, the effect of PA on ISR was almost 3 times that by glucose, suggesting that the metabolism of PA is not the dominant mechanism mediating PA's effect on ISR. This was further supported by lack of inhibition of PA-stimulated OCR and ISR when blocking entry of PA into  (with etomoxir), and PA's lack of stimulation of reduced cytochrome c in the presence of high glucose. Consistent with the lack of metabolic stimulation by PA, an inhibitor of calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum, but not a blocker of L-type calcium channels, abolished the PA-induced elevation of cytosolic calcium. Notably, ISR was unaffected by thapsigargin showing the dissociation of endoplasmic reticulum calcium release and second phase insulin secretion. In conclusion, stimulation of ISR by PA was mediated by mechanisms largely independent of the oxidation of the fuel.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31529902>[The insulin initiates "kinetic perfection" of biologic function of locomotion.

Recent studies suggested that NR prevents hearing loss, high-fat diet-induced obesity, Alzheimer's disease, and mitochondrial myopathy. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of NR on inflammation and mitochondrial biogenesis in AML12 mouse hepatocytes.A subset of hepatocytes was treated with  (PA; 250 µM) for 48 h to induce hepatocyte steatosis. The hepatocytes were treated with NR (10 µM and 10 mM) for 24 h with and without PA. The cell viability and the levels of sirtuins, inflammatory markers, and mitochondrial markers were analyzed.Cytotoxicity of NR was examined by PrestoBlue assay. Exposure to NR had no effect on cell viability or morphology. Gene expression of sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) and Sirt3 was significantly upregulated by NR in PA-treated hepatocytes. However, Sirt1 activities were increased in hepatocytes treated with low-dose NR. Hepatic pro-inflammatory markers including tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 were decreased in NR-treated cells. NR upregulated anti-inflammatory molecule adiponectin, and, tended to down-regulate hepatokine fetuin-A in PA-treated hepatocytes, suggesting its inverse regulation on these cytokines. NR increased levels of mitochondrial markers including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, uncoupling protein 2, transcription factor A, mitochondrial and mitochondrial DNA in PA-treated hepatocytes.These data demonstrated that NR attenuated hepatic inflammation and increased levels of mitochondrial markers in hepatocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625574>-targeted therapy rescues development and quality of embryos derived from oocytes matured under oxidative stress conditions: a bovine in vitro model.</a></h2><p>Can we use a mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant (Mitoquinone) during in vitro embryo culture to rescue developmental competence of oocytes matured under lipotoxic conditions, exhibiting mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress?Supplementation of embryo culture media with Mitoquinone reduced oxidative stress and prevented mitochondrial uncoupling in embryos derived from metabolically compromised oocytes in vitro, leading to higher blastocyst rates and lower blastomeric apoptosis.Maternal metabolic disorders, such as obesity and type-II diabetes are associated with hyperlipidemia and elevated free fatty  (FFA) concentrations in the ovarian follicular fluid (FF). Oocyte maturation under these lipotoxic conditions results in increased oxidative stress levels, mitochondrial dysfunction, reduced developmental competence and disappointing IVF results.A well-described bovine oocyte IVM model was used, where a pathophysiologically relevant elevated FF concentrations of  (PA; 150 μM or 300 μM) were added to induce oxidative stress. After fertilization (Day 0, D0), zygotes were in vitro cultured (IVC, from D1 to D8) in standard fatty -free media in the presence or absence of Mitoquinone or its carrier triphenyl-phosphonium.Embryo cleavage and fragmentation (D2) and blastocyst rates (D8) were recorded. Mitochondrial activity and oxidative stress in cleaved embryos at D2 were determined using specific fluorogenic probes and confocal microscopy. D8 blastocysts were used to (i) examine the expression of marker genes related to mitochondrial unfolded protein responses (UPRmt; HSPD1 and HSPE1), mitochondrial biogenesis (TFAM), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) UPR (ATF4, ATF6 and BiP) and oxidative stress (CAT, GPX1 and SOD2) using real time RT-PCR; (ii) determine cell differentiation and apoptosis using CDX-2 and cleaved caspase-3 immunostaining; and (iii) measure mtDNA copy numbers. This was tested in a series of experiments with at least three independent replicates for each, using a total of 2525 oocytes. Differences were considered significant if a P value was <0.05 after Bonferroni correction.Exposure to PA during IVM followed by culture under control conditions resulted in a significant increase in oxidative stress in embryos at D2. This was associated with a significant reduction in mitochondrial inner membrane potential (uncoupling) compared with solvent control (P < 0.05). The magnitude of these effects was PA-concentration dependent. Consequently, development to the blastocysts stage was significantly hampered. Surviving blastocysts exhibited high apoptotic cell indices and upregulated mRNA expression indicating persistent oxidative stress, mitochondrial and ER UPRs. In contrast, supplementation of PA-derived zygotes with Mitoquinone during IVC (i) prevented mitochondrial uncoupling and alleviated oxidative stress at D2; and (ii) rescued blastocyst quality; normalized oxidative stress and UPR related genes and apoptotic cell indices (P > 0.01 compared with solvent control). Mitoquinone also improved blastocyst rate in PA-exposed groups, an effect that was dependent on PA concentration.N/A.This is a fundamental study performed using a bovine in vitro model using PA-induced lipotoxicity during oocyte maturation. PA is the most predominant FFA in the FF that is known to induce lipotoxicity; however, in vivo maturation in patients suffering from maternal metabolic disorders involve more factors that cannot be represented in one model. Nevertheless, focusing on the carryover oxidative stress as a known key factor affecting developmental competence, and considering the novel beneficial rescuing effects of Mitoquinone shown here, we believe this model is of high biological relevance.Human oocytes collected for IVF treatments from patients with maternal metabolic disorders are vulnerable to lipotoxicity and oxidative stress during in vivo maturation. The results shown here suggest that mitochondrial targeted therapy, such as using Mitoquinone, during IVC may rescue the developmental competence and quality of these compromised oocytes. After further clinical trials, this may be a valuable approach to increase IVF success rates for infertile patients experiencing metabolic disorders.This study was financially supported by a BOF/KP grant number 34399, from the University of Antwerp, Belgium.

Unlike its anti-apoptotic homologs, Mcl-1 deletion has profound physiologic consequences, indicative of a broader role in homeostasis. We report that the BCL-2 homology 3 (BH3) α helix of MCL-1 can directly engage very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD), a key enzyme of the mitochondrial fatty  β-oxidation (FAO) pathway. Proteomic analysis confirmed that the mitochondrial matrix isoform of MCL-1 (MCL-1) interacts with VLCAD. Mcl-1 deletion, or eliminating MCL-1 alone, selectively deregulated long-chain FAO, causing increased flux through the pathway in response to nutrient deprivation. Transient elevation in MCL-1 upon serum withdrawal, a striking increase in MCL-1 BH3/VLCAD interaction upon  titration, and direct modulation of enzymatic activity by the MCL-1 BH3 α helix are consistent with dynamic regulation. Thus, the MCL-1 BH3 interaction with VLCAD revealed a separable, gain-of-function role for MCL-1 in the regulation of lipid metabolism.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The objective of this work was to study the operation of MCU and Ca-dependent mitochondrial permeabilization in the liver cells of Sprague-Dawley rats under the streptozotocin-induced type I diabetes. It was shown that two weeks after the induction of diabetes, the rate of Ca uptake by the  of diabetic animals increased ~1.4-fold. The expression of MCU and MICU1 subunits did not change, yet the quantity of dominant-negative MCUb channel subunits was almost twice as lower. The organelles also became more resistant to the induction of CsA-sensitive MPT pore and less resistant to the induction of CsA-insensitive palmitate/Ca-induced pore. The  of diabetic liver cells also showed changes in the lipid matrix of their membranes. The content of fatty acids in the membranes grew, and microviscosity of the lipid bilayer (assessed with laurdan) increased. At the same time, lipid peroxidation (assessed by the production of malonic dialdehyde) was stimulated.

This β-cell 'glucolipotoxicity' is possibly mediated by mitochondrial dysfunction, but involvement of bioenergetic failure in the pathological mechanism is the subject of ongoing debate. We show in the present study that increased palmitate levels impair GSIS before altering mitochondrial function. We demonstrate that GSIS defects arise from increased insulin release under basal conditions in addition to decreased insulin secretion under glucose-stimulatory conditions. Real-time respiratory analysis of intact mouse pancreatic islets reveals that mitochondrial ATP synthesis is not involved in the mechanism by which basal insulin is elevated. Equally, mitochondrial lipid oxidation and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) do not contribute to increased basal insulin secretion. Palmitate does not affect KCl-induced insulin release at a basal or stimulatory glucose level, but elevated basal insulin release is attenuated by palmitoleate and associates with increased intracellular calcium. These findings deepen our understanding of β-cell glucolipotoxicity and reveal that palmitate-induced GSIS impairment is disconnected from mitochondrial dysfunction, a notion that is important when targeting β-cells for the treatment of diabetes and when assessing islet function in human transplants.© 2016 Authors; published by Portland Press Limited.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28153718>HADHA, the alpha subunit of the mitochondrial trifunctional protein, is involved in long-chain fatty -induced autophagy in intestinal epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>Genome-wide association studies have identified autophagy-related susceptibility genes for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, whether autophagy regulators can be utilized as therapeutic targets remains unclear. To identify novel microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-interacting proteins in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), we isolated primary IECs from green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3 mice. We performed immunoprecipitation with a GFP antibody and then analyzed co-immunoprecipitates by mass spectrometry. HADHA was identified as an LC3-interacting protein from primary IECs. The HADHA gene encodes the alpha subunit of the mitochondrial trifunctional protein. Given that HADHA catalyzes the last three steps of mitochondrial beta-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids, we investigated whether long-chain fatty acids induce autophagy in IECs. We found that  induced autophagy in DLD-1, HT29, and HCT116 cells. HADHA was expressed in not only the  but also the cytosol. LC3 puncta co-localized with HADHA, which were enhanced by  stimulation. However, LC3 puncta did not co-localize with Tom20, suggesting that HADHA was induced to associate with LC3 puncta at sites other than the . Thus, HADHA may have extra-mitochondrial functions. Furthermore, we found that  induced cell death in IECs, which was accelerated by bafilomycin A and chloroquine. These findings suggested that -induced autophagy supports the survival of IECs. Taken together, these results suggested that HADHA is involved in long-chain fatty -induced autophagy in IECs, thus providing new insights into the pathology of IBD and revealing novel therapeutic targets of IBD.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This study evaluated the synergistic effects of ZnO NPs and  (PA) or free fatty acids (FFAs) mixture (oleic/PA 2:1) on toxicity to human colon epithelial (Caco-2) cells. The ZnO NPs exposure concentration dependently induced cytotoxicity to Caco-2 cells showing as reduced proliferation and activity measured by 3 different assays. PA exposure induced cytotoxicity, and coexposure to ZnO NPs and PA showed the largest cytotoxic effects. The presence of FFAs mixture did not affect the ZnO NPs-induced cytotoxicity. Filtration of freshly prepared suspension of NPs through a 0.45-µm pore size membrane significantly reduced the cytotoxicity, indicating a role of concentration or size of particles in cytotoxic effects. The ZnO NPs and PA coexposure induced production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) but not intracellular ROS production, whereas FFAs mixture exposure did not induce mROS and inhibited intracellular ROS. Both ZnO NPs and fatty acids (PA and FFAs mixture) promoted lysosomal destabilization, which was not correlated with cytotoxicity. These results indicated that PA can enhance ZnO NPs-induced cytotoxicity probably by the augmentation of mROS production, whereas FFAs mixture did not affect ROS production. Synergistic effects between ZnO NPs and fatty acids may be important when considering NPs toxicity via oral exposure.© The Author(s) 2014.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28452587>Fasting rapidly increases fatty  oxidation in white adipose tissue of young broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>Upregulating the fatty  oxidation capacity of white adipose tissue in mice protects against diet-induced obesity, inflammation and insulin resistance. Part of this capacity results from induction of brown-like adipocytes within classical white depots, making it difficult to determine the oxidative contribution of the more abundant white adipocytes. Avian genomes lack a gene for uncoupling protein 1 and are devoid of brown adipose cells, making them a useful model in which to study white adipocyte metabolism in vivo. We recently reported that a brief (5 hour) period of fasting significantly upregulated many genes involved in mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty  oxidation pathways in white adipose tissue of young broiler chickens. The objective of this study was to determine if the effects on gene expression manifested in increased rates of fatty  oxidation. Abdominal adipose tissue was collected from 21 day-old broiler chicks that were fasted for 3, 5 or 7 hours or fed ad libitum (controls). Fatty  oxidation was determined by measuring and summing CO production and C-labeled -soluble metabolites from the oxidation of [1-C] . Fasting induced a progressive increase in complete fatty  oxidation and citrate synthase activity relative to controls. These results confirm that fatty  oxidation in white adipose tissue is dynamically controlled by nutritional status. Identifying the underlying mechanism may provide new therapeutic targets through which to increase fatty  oxidation in situ and protect against the detrimental effects of excess free fatty acids on adipocyte insulin sensitivity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30103942>Fatty  activates NLRP3 inflammasomes in mouse Kupffer cells through mitochondrial DNA release.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease in many developed and developing countries worldwide. It has been well established that the chronic sterile inflammation caused by the NLRP3 inflammasome is closely related to NAFLD development. Kupffer cells (KCs) are involved in the pathogenesis of various liver diseases. We used methionine choline-deficient diets to establish a mouse nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) model. The expression and formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the KCs from the mouse and cell models were determined by Western blotting and co-immunoprecipitation. Evidence of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) release was determined by live cell labeling and imaging. KCs and the NLRP3 inflammasome exerted proinflammatory effects on the development and progression of NASH through secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β. NLRP3, ASC and Caspase-1 protein expression levels in KCs from NASH mouse livers were significantly higher than those in KCs from NLRP3 mice, and the number of NLRP3 inflammasome protein complexes was significantly higher in KCs from NASH mouse livers, whereas these protein complexes could not be formed in NLRP3 mice. In in vitro experiments,  (PA) decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential and subsequently induced mtDNA release from the  to the cytoplasm. NLRP3 inflammasome expression was substantially increased, and mtDNA-NLRP3 inflammasome complexes formed upon PA stimulation. Our data suggest that mtDNA released from  during PA stimulation causes NLRP3 inflammasome activation, providing a missing link between NLRP3 inflammasome activation and NASH development, via binding of cytosolic mtDNA to the NLRP3 inflammasome.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Defects in this process have been linked to diabetes. Diabetes-associated glucotoxicity/lipotoxicity contribute to impaired β-cell function and have been implicated as contributing factors to this disease. We tested the hypothesis that these two conditions affect β-cell function by modulating autophagy. We report that exposure of β-cell lines and human pancreatic islets to high levels of glucose and lipids blocks autophagic flux and leads to apoptotic cell death. EM analysis showed accumulation of autophagy intermediates (autophagosomes), with abundant engulfed cargo in  (PA)- or glucose-treated cells, indicating suppressed autophagic turnover. EM studies also showed accumulation of damaged , endoplasmic reticulum distention, and vacuolar changes in PA-treated cells. Pulse-chase experiments indicated decreased protein turnover in β-cells treated with PA/glucose. Expression of mTORC1, an inhibitor of autophagy, was elevated in β-cells treated with PA/glucose. mTORC1 inhibition, by treatment with rapamycin, reversed changes in autophagic flux, and cell death induced by glucose/PA. Our results indicate that nutrient toxicity-induced cell death occurs via impaired autophagy and is mediated by activation of mTORC1 in β-cells, contributing to β-cell failure in the presence of metabolic stress.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29158819>Pro-Inflammatory CXCR3 Impairs Mitochondrial Function in Experimental Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a crucial role in the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, the regulator of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of NASH is still largely unclear. CXCR3 is an essential pro-inflammatory factor in chronic liver diseases. We explored the significance of CXCR3 in regulating mitochondrial function during NASH development in animal models and cultured hepatocytes.The effects of CXCR3 on mitochondrial function were evaluated by genetic knockout or pharmacological inhibition in mouse models and . The ultrastructural changes of  were assessed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Hepatic levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage, membrane potential and ATP were examined.CXCR3 ablation by genetic knockout or pharmacological inhibition in mice protected against NASH development by influencing mitochondrial function. Similarly, depletion of CXCR3 reduced steatohepatitis injury in cultured hepatocytes. TEM analysis revealed that liver mitochondrial integrity was much improved in CXCR3 knockout (CXCR3) compared to wildtype (WT) mice. In agreement with this, impaired mitochondrial function was pronounced in WT mice compared to CXCR3 mice, evidenced by increased protein expression of dynamic-related protein-1 (DRP1) and fission-1 (FIS1) and decreased protein expression of mitofusin-1 (MFN1). Mitochondrial dysfunction was induced in AML-12 hepatocytes by methionine and choline deficient medium and in HepG2 cells by . The impaired mitochondrial function in both cell lines was evidenced by reduced membrane potential and ATP content, and by increased mitochondrial ROS accumulation and DNA damage. However, CXCR3 knockdown by siCXCR3 significantly diminished the mitochondrial dysfunction in both AML-12 and HepG2 hepatocytes. In addition, inhibition of CXCR3 by CXCR3 specific antagonists SCH546738 and AMG487 restored mitochondrial function and inhibited mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis in the liver of WT mice fed with methionine and choline deficient diet.CXCR3 induces mitochondrial dysfunction, which contributes to the pathogenesis of steatohepatitis. Pharmacologic blockade of CXCR3 prevents mitochondrial dysfunction and restores the severity of steatohepatitis, indicating a potential clinical impact for controlling the disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30708325>Mst1 inhibition attenuates non-alcoholic fatty liver disease via reversing Parkin-related mitophagy.</a></h2><p>Obesity-related non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is connected with mitochondrial stress and hepatocyte apoptosis. Parkin-related mitophagy sustains mitochondrial homeostasis and hepatocyte viability. However, the contribution and regulatory mechanisms of Parkin-related mitophagy in NAFLD are incompletely understood. Macrophage stimulating 1 (Mst1) is a novel mitophagy upstream regulator which excerbates heart and cancer apoptosisn via repressing mitophagy activity. The aim of our study is to explore whether Mst1 contributes to NAFLD via disrupting Parkin-related mitophagy. A NAFLD model was generated in wild-type (WT) mice and Mst1 knockout (Mst1-KO) mice using high-fat diet (HFD). Cell experiments were conducted via  (PA) treatment in the primary hepatocytes. The results in our study demonstrated that Mst1 was significantly upregulated in HFD-treated livers. Genetic ablation of Mst1 attenuated HFD-mediated hepatic injury and sustained hepatocyte viability. Functional studies illustrated that Mst1 knockdown reversed Parkin-related mitophagy and the latter protected  and hepatocytes against HFD challenge. Besides, we further figured out that Mst1 modulated Parkin expression via the AMPK pathway; blockade of AMPK repressed Parkin-related mitophagy and recalled hepatocytes mitochondrial apoptosis. Altogether, our data identified that NAFLD was closely associated with the defective Parkin-related mitophagy due to Mst1 upregulation.

This study examined the effects of omega-3 alpha-linolenic  (ALA) during in vitro oocyte maturation (IVM) in the presence of PSO on subsequent embryo development and quality, and the cellular mechanisms that might be involved. Bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were supplemented during IVM with ALA (50 μM), PSO (425 μM), or PSO+ALA. Compared with FFA-free controls (P < 0.05), PSO increased embryo fragmentation and decreased good quality embryos on day 2 postfertilization. Day 7 blastocyst rate was also reduced. Day 8 blastocysts had lower cell counts and higher apoptosis but normal metabolic profile. In the PSO group, cumulus cell (CC) expansion was inhibited with an increased CC apoptosis while COC metabolism was not affected. Mitochondrial inner membrane potential (MMP; JC-1 staining) was reduced in the CCs and oocytes. Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) but not glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP78, known as BiP; an endoplasmic reticulum stress marker) was upregulated in the CCs. Higher reactive oxygen species levels (DCHFDA staining) were detected in the oocytes. In contrast, adding ALA in the presence of PSO normalized embryo fragmentation, cleavage, blastocyst rates, and blastocyst quality compared to controls (P > 0.05). Combined treatment with ALA also reduced CC apoptosis, partially recovered CC expansion, abrogated the reduction in MMP in the CCs but not in the oocytes, and reduced BiP and HSP70 expression in CCs, compared with PSO only (P < 0.05). In conclusion, ALA supplementation protected oocyte developmental capacity under lipotoxic conditions mainly by protecting cumulus cell viability.© The Authors 2017.

The aim of the current study was to improve our understanding in the molecular mechanisms of benzbromarone-associated hepatic mitochondrial toxicity. In HepG2 cells and primary human hepatocytes, ATP levels started to decrease in the presence of 25-50μM benzbromarone for 24-48h, whereas cytotoxicity was observed only at 100μM. In HepG2 cells, benzbromarone decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential starting at 50μM following incubation for 24h. Additionally, in HepG2 cells, 50μM benzbromarone for 24h induced mitochondrial uncoupling,and decreased mitochondrial ATP turnover and maximal respiration. This was accompanied by an increased lactate concentration in the cell culture supernatant, reflecting increased glycolysis as a compensatory mechanism to maintain cellular ATP. Investigation of the electron transport chain revealed a decreased activity of all relevant enzyme complexes. Furthermore, treatment with benzbromarone was associated with increased cellular ROS production, which could be located specifically to . In HepG2 cells and in isolated mouse liver , benzbromarone also reduced  metabolism due to an inhibition of the long-chain acyl CoA synthetase. In HepG2 cells, benzbromarone disrupted the mitochondrial network, leading to mitochondrial fragmentation and a decreased mitochondrial volume per cell. Cell death occurred by both apoptosis and necrosis. The study demonstrates that benzbromarone not only affects the function of  in HepG2 cells and human hepatocytes, but is also associated with profound changes in mitochondrial structure which may be associated with apoptosis.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The mice were then treated with berberine (BBR) (100 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks to test the impact on GLP-1 expression. Mitochondrial activities of the colon enterocytes were compared among three groups of mice (lean, DIO, and DIO + BBR) at the end of treatment. Gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were examined to understand the mitochondrial responses. A cellular model treated with  (PA) was used in the mechanism study.A reduction in GLP-1 expression was observed in DIO mice with mitochondrial stress responses in the colon enterocytes. The mitochondria exhibited cristae loss, membrane rupture, and mitochondrial swelling, which was observed with an increase in ATP abundance, complex I activity, and deficiency in the activities of complexes II and IV. Those changes were associated with dysbiosis and a reduction in SCFAs in the colon of DIO mice. In the cellular model, an increase in ATP abundance, loss of mitochondrial potential, and elevation of apoptosis were induced by PA. All of the alterations in DIO mice and the cellular model were attenuated by BBR.The mitochondrial stress responses were observed in the colon enterocytes of DIO mice for GLP-1 reduction.

Fatty liver is one of the main health disorders after parturition. Therefore, to investigate changes in hepatic lipid metabolic status and  in dairy cows with mild fatty liver, liver and blood samples were collected from healthy cows (n = 15) and cows with mild fatty liver (n = 15). To determine the effects of  acids (PA), one of the major component of fatty acids, on lipid metabolism and  in vitro, calf hepatocytes were isolated from healthy calves and treated with various concentrations of PA (0, 50, 100, and 200 μM). Dairy cows with mild fatty liver displayed hepatic lipid accumulation. The protein levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) and mRNA levels of acetyl CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty  synthase (FAS), acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) were significantly higher in dairy cows with mild fatty liver than in control cows.

The PA treatment significantly increased lipid accumulation; protein levels of SREBP-1c and PPARα; and mRNA levels of ACC1, FAS, ACO, and CPT1A in calf hepatocytes. Moreover, the mitochondrial DNA content, mRNA levels of CO 1-V, protein levels of COX IV, VDAC1, PGC-1α, NRF1, mitochondrial transcription factor A, and ATP content were significantly increased in PA-treated hepatocytes compared with control hepatocytes. The protein level of mitofusin-2 was significantly decreased in PA-treated groups. In conclusion, lipid synthesis and oxidation, number of , and ATP production were increased in the liver of dairy cows with mild fatty liver and PA-treated calf hepatocytes.

In particular, saturated fatty acids such as  (PA) have been implicated in the development of insulin resistance in peripheral tissues. However, how neurons develop insulin resistance in response to lipid overload is not fully understood. Here, we used cultured rat cortical neurons and differentiated human neuroblastoma cells to demonstrate that PA blocks insulin-induced metabolic activation, inhibits the activation of the insulin/PI3K/Akt pathway and activates mTOR kinase downstream of Akt. Despite the fact that fatty acids are not normally used as a significant source of fuel by neural cells, we also found that short-term neuronal exposure to PA reduces the NAD/NADH ratio, indicating that PA modifies the neuronal energy balance. Finally, inhibiting mitochondrial ROS production with mitoTEMPO prevented the deleterious effect of PA on insulin signaling.

PA inhibited endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation, which were associated with increased expression of mammalian Ste20-like kinases 1 (MST1), YAP phosphorylation/inactivation, and nuclear exclusion. Overexpression of YAP or knockdown of MST1 prevented PA-induced inhibition of angiogenesis. When searching upstream signaling mechanisms, we found that PA dysregulated the Hippo-YAP pathway by inducing mitochondrial damage. PA treatment induced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) release to cytosol, and activated cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS-STING-IRF3 signaling. Activated IRF3 bound to the  gene promoter and induced MST1 expression, leading to MST1 up-regulation, YAP inactivation, and angiogenesis inhibition. Thus, mitochondrial damage and cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS-STING-IRF3 signaling are critically involved in PA-induced Hippo-YAP dysregulation and angiogenesis suppression. This mechanism may have implication in impairment of angiogenesis and wound healing in diabetes.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25824459>Modest decrease in PGC1α results in TAG accumulation but not in insulin resistance in L6 myotubes.</a></h2><p>PGC-1α is an important cellular protein (coactivator) regulating myocyte  number and function, and therefore whole cellular energy status. The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of modest, temporary PGC-1α knock-down on L6 myotubes insulin resistance in a light of cellular lipid metabolism.Gas liquid chromatography was applied for assessing FAs content and composition. For the expression of mitochondrial enzymes, as well as FA and glucose transporters, Western Blot technique was adopted. Additionally, radiolabelled glucose and  uptake was performed to estimate the nutrients cellular influx.Modest (-24%) PGC-1α protein ablation resulted in decreased mitochondrial activity in general (reduced Cyt C content) and FAs oxidation in particular (diminished β-HAD expression) without increased FAs cellular influx. The aforementioned intervention led to significantly increased TAG cellular level, but not DAG nor CER. Consequently, no changes in cellular insulin responsiveness were noticed.Modest (-24%) PGC-1α protein depletion results in lipid accumulation, without causing insulin resistance. Importantly, it seems that this TAG loading is a result of decreased mitochondrial oxidative capacity and/or possibly increased lipid biosynthesis but not fatty  cellular influx.© 2015 S.

Here, we investigated the molecular mechanism of -inhibited cell death in mouse podocytes, and found that  increased cell death in a dose- and time-dependent manner.  induces apoptosis in podocytes through upregulation of cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca , mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), cytochrome c release, and depletion of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca . The intracellular calcium chelator, 1,2-bis (2-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N, N'-tetraacetic  tetrakis acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM), partially prevented this upregulation whereas 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), an inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3R) inhibitor; dantrolene, a ryanodine receptor (RyR) inhibitor; and 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostibene-2,2'-disulfonic  (DIDS), an anion exchange inhibitor, had no effect. Interestingly, ruthenium red and Ru360, both inhibitors of the mitochondrial Ca uniporter (MCU), blocked -induced mitochondrial Ca elevation, cytochrome c release from  to cytosol, and apoptosis. siRNA to MCU markedly reduced -induced apoptosis.

Through in vitro plant cell culture it is possible to modify CB lipid profiles and to study the fatty  biosynthesis pathway on a subcellular level, evaluating fundamental aspects to enhance in vitro fatty  production in a specific and controlled way. In this research, culture media was supplemented with acetate, biotin, pyruvate, bicarbonate and glycerol at three different concentrations and the effects on the biomass production (g/L), cell viability, and fatty acids profile and production was evaluated in in vitro cell suspensions culture. It was found that biotin stimulated fatty  synthesis without altering cell viability and cell growth. It was also evident a change in the lipid profile of cell suspensions, increasing middle and long chain fatty acids proportion, which are unusual to those reported in seeds; thus implying that it is possible to modify lipid profiles according to the treatment used. According to the results of sucrose gradients and enzyme assays performed, it is proposed that cacao cells probably use the pentose phosphate pathway,  being the key organelle in the carbon flux for the synthesis of reductant power and fatty  precursors.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, recent studies in hepatocytes suggest that the mitochondrial proliferator PGC-1α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α) also acts as an upstream transcriptional regulator for enhancing peroxisomal abundance and associated activity. It is unknown whether the regulatory mechanism(s) for enhancing peroxisomal function is through the same node as mitochondrial biogenesis in human skeletal muscle (HSkM) and whether fatty  oxidation (FAO) is affected. Primary myotubes from vastus lateralis biopsies from lean donors (BMI = 24.0 ± 0.6 kg/m;  = 6) were exposed to adenovirus encoding human PGC-1α or GFP control. Peroxisomal biogenesis proteins (peroxins) and genes () responsible for proliferation and functions were assessed by Western blotting and real-time qRT-PCR, respectively. [1-C] and [1-C]lignoceric  (exclusive peroxisomal-specific substrate) were used to assess mitochondrial oxidation of peroxisomal-derived metabolites. After overexpression of PGC-1α, ) peroxisomal membrane protein 70 kDa (PMP70), PEX19, and mitochondrial citrate synthetase protein content were significantly elevated ( < 0.05), ) , , key , and peroxisomal β-oxidation mRNA expression levels were significantly upregulated ( < 0.05), and ) a concomitant increase in lignoceric  oxidation by both peroxisomal and mitochondrial activity was observed ( < 0.05). These novel findings demonstrate that, in addition to the proliferative effect on , PGC-1α can induce peroxisomal activity and accompanying elevations in long-chain and very-long-chain fatty  oxidation by a peroxisomal-mitochondrial functional cooperation, as observed in HSkM cells.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26400965>Dietary Olive and Perilla Oils Affect Liver Mitochondrial DNA Methylation in Large Yellow Croakers.</a></h2><p>Substantial progress has been made in nutritional epigenetics, but little is known regarding whether mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) methylation is involved in this process.The objective of this study was to determine whether dietary lipid sources [various fatty acids (FAs)] modify mtDNA methylation.A total of 600 large yellow croakers (Larimichthys crocea) with an average initial weight of 151 ± 4 g were fed 1 of 5 diets (3 replicate cages/treatment) containing either fish oil (FO) (control), , olive oil (OO), sunflower oil, or perilla oil (PO) as the dietary lipid source (12% dry weight of the diet) for 70 d. Pyrosequencing was used to determine the effects of dietary lipid sources (FAs) on mtDNA methylation.Mitochondrial arginine transfer RNA and NAD(H) dehydrogenase 4L encoding region methylation in the liver was higher in the OO (9.5% ± 0.52%; P < 0.05) and PO (7.3% ± 0.33%; P < 0.05) groups than in the FO (5.9% ± 0.42%) group, whereas 12S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) methylation in the liver was lower in the OO group (2.7% ± 0.22%) than in the FO group (4.2% ± 0.73%) (P < 0.05). Additionally, fish fed the OO diet had lower liver mRNA levels of ND3 (P < 0.05), ND4L (P < 0.05), ND6 (P < 0.05), 12S rRNA (P < 0.05), and 16S rRNA (P < 0.05) than those fed the FO diet, whereas fish fed the PO diet had lower liver mRNA levels of 16S rRNA than those fed the FO diet (P < 0.05).

The goals of this study were to assess the influence of chronic exposure to high  (PAL) levels on mitochondrial respiratory functions in endothelial cells and isolated . Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (EA.hy926 line) were grown for 6 days in a medium containing either 100 or 150 μM PAL. Growth at high PAL concentrations induced a considerable increase in fatty -supplied respiration and a reduction of mitochondrial respiration during carbohydrate and glutamine oxidation. High PAL levels elevated intracellular and mitochondrial superoxide generation; increased inflammation marker, acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenase, uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), and superoxide dismutase 2 expression; and decreased hexokinase I and pyruvate dehydrogenase expression. No change in aerobic respiration capacity was observed, while fermentation was decreased. In  isolated from high PAL-treated cells, an increase in the oxidation of palmitoylcarnitine, a decrease in the oxidation of pyruvate, and an increase in UCP2 activity were observed. Our results demonstrate that exposure to high PAL levels induces a shift in endothelial aerobic metabolism toward the oxidation of fatty acids. Increased levels of PAL caused impairment and uncoupling of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system. Our data indicate that FFAs significantly affect endothelial oxidative metabolism, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, and cell viability and, thus, might contribute to endothelial and vascular dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30540494>Peroxisomes can oxidize medium- and long-chain fatty acids through a pathway involving ABCD3 and HSD17B4.</a></h2><p>Peroxisomes are essential organelles for the specialized oxidation of a wide variety of fatty acids, but they are also able to degrade fatty acids that are typically handled by mitochondria. Using a combination of pharmacological inhibition and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR associated protein 9 genome editing technology to simultaneously manipulate peroxisomal and mitochondrial fatty  β-oxidation (FAO) in HEK-293 cells, we identified essential players in the metabolic crosstalk between these organelles. Depletion of carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT)2 activity through pharmacological inhibition or knockout (KO) uncovered a significant residual peroxisomal oxidation of lauric and , leading to the production of peroxisomal acylcarnitine intermediates. Generation and analysis of additional single- and double-KO cell lines revealed that the D-bifunctional protein (HSD17B4) and the peroxisomal ABC transporter ABCD3 are essential in peroxisomal oxidation of lauric and . Our results indicate that peroxisomes not only accept acyl-CoAs but can also oxidize acylcarnitines in a similar biochemical pathway. By using an Hsd17b4 KO mouse model, we demonstrated that peroxisomes contribute to the plasma acylcarnitine profile after acute inhibition of CPT2, proving in vivo relevance of this pathway.

We determined whether inhibition of a hypoxia-induced signaling pathway could attenuate hypoxia-exacerbated lipoapoptosis in human hepatocytes. The human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2) was used in this study.  (PA)-treated groups were used for two environmental conditions: Hypoxia (1% O2) and normoxia (20% O2). Following the treatment, the cell viability was determined by the 3,4-(5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium salt (MTS) assay, and the mechanism of lipoapoptosis was evaluated by Western blotting. Hypoxia exacerbated the suppression of hepatocyte growth induced by  via activation of mitochondrial apoptotic pathways as a result of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and oxidative stresses. Ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, a scavenger of reactive oxygen species, attenuated the hypoxia-exacerbated lipoapoptosis in hepatocytes, whereas glycerol, which reduces ER stress, did not. This may have been because inhibition of oxidative stress decreases the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins, such as caspase 9 and cytochrome c. These results suggested that modulation of apoptotic signaling pathways activated by oxidative stress can aid in identifying novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with OSA. Further in vivo studies are necessary to understand the pathophysiologic mechanism of NASH with OSA and to prove the therapeutic effect of the modulation of the signaling pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30347229>Lupin seed hydrolysate promotes G-protein-coupled receptor, intracellular Ca and enhanced glycolytic -mediated insulin secretion from BRIN-BD11 pancreatic beta cells.</a></h2><p>Lupin seed proteins have been reported to exhibit hypoglycaemic effects in animals and humans following oral administration, however little is known about its mechanism of action. This study investigated the signalling pathway(s) responsible for the insulinotropic effect of the hydrolysate obtained from lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.) seed extracts utilizing BRIN-BD11 β-cells. The extract was treated with digestive enzymes to give a hydrolysate rich in biomolecules ≤7 kDa. Cells exhibited hydrolysate induced dose-dependent stimulation of insulin secretion and enhanced intracellular Ca and glucose . The stimulatory effect of the hydrolysate was potentiated by depolarizing concentrations of KCl and was blocked by inhibitors of the ATP sensitive K channel, Gα protein, phospholipase C (PLC) and protein kinase C (PKC). These findings reveal a novel mechanism for lupin hydrolysate stimulated insulin secretion via Gα mediated signal transduction (Gα/PLC/PKC) in the β-cells.

One group of substances with a potential use in the treatment of NAFLD are plant polyphenols, represented by resveratrol. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of resveratrol on steatosis and oxidative stress in HepG2 cells. The steatosis of cells was carried out using free fatty acids: oleic or  and their mixtures. Steatosis was visualized using the intracellular lipid staining by Nile Red dye with a fluorescence microscope. This study also determined the viability of cells and mitochondrial membrane potential. The current study showed that fatty acids and their mixtures induced fat overloading in HepG2 cells.

In case of cells incubated with  (PA) and the mixtures of fatty acids, micro- and macro-vacuolar steatosis occurred in most of the cells.

Hydrogen sulphide (H S) has antioxidative effect, but its regulation on mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy in aortic endothelial cells under hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia is unclear. Rat aortic endothelial cells (RAECs) were treated with 40 mM glucose and 200 μM palmitate to imitate endothelium under hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia, and 100 μM NaHS was used as an exogenous H S donor. Firstly, we demonstrated that high glucose and palmitate decreased H S production and CSE expression in RAECs. Then, the antioxidative effect of H S was proved in RAECs under high glucose and palmitate to reduce mitochondrial ROS level. We also showed that exogenous H S inhibited mitochondrial apoptosis in RAECs under high glucose and palmitate. Using Mito Tracker and transmission electron microscopy assay, we revealed that exogenous H S decreased mitochondrial fragments and significantly reduced the expression of p-Drp-1/Drp-1 and Fis1 compared to high-glucose and high-palmitate group, whereas it increased mitophagy by transmission electron microscopy assay. We demonstrated that exogenous H S facilitated Parkin recruited by PINK1 by immunoprecipitation and immunostaining assays and then ubiquitylated mitofusin 2 (Mfn2), which illuminated the mechanism of exogenous H S on mitophagy. Parkin siRNA suppressed the expression of Mfn2, Nix and LC3B, which revealed that it eliminated mitophagy. In summary, exogenous H S could protect RAECs against apoptosis under high glucose and palmitate by suppressing oxidative stress, decreasing mitochondrial fragments and promoting mitophagy. Based on these results, we proposed a new mechanism of H S on protecting endothelium, which might provide a new strategy for type II diabetes vascular complication.© 2017 The Authors.

Exposure to 2- or 3-MCPD thus results, for example, from refined vegetable oils, in instant meals or infant formula, as well as in cereals or pastries.

In the absence of overt histopathologically detectable toxicity, moderate alterations in cellular proteomic signatures were recorded. The observations are in line with the assumption that the molecular mechanisms of 2-MCPD and 3-MCPD toxicity differ.

In this study, we evaluated ability of pterostilbene (PTS), a methoxylated analogue of resveratrol and a known antioxidant, to reverse  (PA)-mediated IR in HepG2 cells. PTS prevented reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and subsequent oxidative lipid damage by reducing the expression of NADPH oxidase 3 (NOX3) in PA treated HepG2 cells. Hepatic glucose production was used as a measure of IR and PTS reversed PA-mediated increase in hepatic glucose production by reducing expression of genes coding for gluconeogenic enzymes namely glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and pyruvate carboxylase (PC); and their transcription factors cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and fork head class Box O (FOXO1) along with its coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator-1 α (PGC1α). PTS reversed PA-mediated activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which in turn altered insulin signalling pathway by phosphorylating IRS-1 at Ser 307, leading to inhibition of phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3β. PTS also reduced PA-mediated lipid accumulation by reducing expression of transcription factors SREBP1c and PPARα. SREBP1c activates genes involved in fatty  and triglyceride synthesis while PPARα activates CPT1, a rate limiting enzyme for controlling entry and oxidation of fatty acids into .

Our method enables flexibility in experimental design and high-throughput assessment of mitochondrial parameters in isolated skeletal muscle fibre bundles. Extensor digitorum longus (EDL) fibre bundles obtained from chronic high-fat diet fed mice had lower basal oxygen consumption under FCCP-induced maximal respiration, when compared to control chow-fed mice. EDL fibre bundles obtained from chronic high-fat diet fed mice had enhanced mitochondrial oxidation capacity under FCCP-induced maximal respiration, when compared to control chow-fed mice.Metabolic dysfunction in skeletal muscle contributes to the aetiology and development of muscle diseases and metabolic diseases. As such, assessment of skeletal muscle cellular bioenergetics provides a powerful means to understand the role of skeletal muscle metabolism in disease and to identify possible therapeutic targets. Here, we developed a method that allows for the real-time assessment of cellular respiration in intact skeletal muscle fibre bundles obtained from the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle of adult mice. Using this method, we assessed the contribution of ATP turnover and proton leak to basal mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR). Our data demonstrate that the  in EDL fibres are loosely coupled. Moreover, in the presence of carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), we show that palmitate exposure induced comparable peak OCR and higher total OCR in EDL fibre bundles when compared to pyruvate exposure, suggesting that fatty acids might be a more sustainable fuel source for skeletal muscle when  are driven to maximal respiration. Application of this method to EDL fibre bundles obtained from chronic high-fat diet fed mice revealed lower basal OCR and enhanced mitochondrial oxidation capacity in the presence of FCCP when compared to the chow-diet fed control mice.

Since dronedarone inhibits mitochondrial respiration and β-oxidation in vitro, mitochondrial toxicity may also explain dronedarone-associated hepatotoxicity in vivo. We therefore studied hepatotoxicity of dronedarone (200mg/kg/day for 2 weeks or 400mg/kg/day for 1 week by intragastric gavage) in heterozygous juvenile visceral steatosis (jvs(+/-)) and wild-type mice. Jvs(+/-) mice have reduced carnitine stores and are sensitive for mitochondrial β-oxidation inhibitors. Treatment with dronedarone 200mg/kg/day had no effect on body weight, serum transaminases and bilirubin, and hepatic mitochondrial function in both wild-type and jvs(+/-) mice. In contrast, dronedarone 400mg/kg/day was associated with a 10-15% drop in body weight, and a 3-5-fold increase in transaminases and bilirubin in wild-type mice and, more accentuated, in jvs(+/-) mice. In vivo metabolism of intraperitoneal (14)C-palmitate was impaired in wild-type, and, more accentuated, in jvs(+/-) mice treated with 400mg/kg/day dronedarone compared to vehicle-treated mice. Impaired β-oxidation was also found in isolated  ex vivo. A likely explanation for these findings was a reduced activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a in liver  from dronedarone-treated mice. In contrast, dronedarone did not affect the activity of the respiratory chain ex vivo. We conclude that dronedarone inhibits mitochondrial β-oxidation in and ex vivo, but not the respiratory chain.

In this study we investigated the effects of the major long-chain monocarboxylic 3-hydroxylated fatty acids (LCHFA) accumulating in these disorders, namely 3-hydroxytetradecanoic (3HTA) and 3-hydroxypalmitic (3HPA) acids, on important mitochondrial functions in rat skeletal muscle . 3HTA and 3HPA markedly increased resting (state 4) and decreased ADP-stimulated (state 3) and CCCP-stimulated (uncoupled) respiration. 3HPA provoked similar effects in permeabilized skeletal muscle fibers, validating the results obtained in purified . Furthermore, 3HTA and 3HPA markedly diminished mitochondrial membrane potential, NAD(P)H content and Ca(2+) retention capacity in Ca(2+)-loaded . Mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT) induction probably underlie these effects since they were totally prevented by cyclosporin A and ADP. In contrast, the dicarboxylic analogue of 3HTA did not alter the tested parameters. Our data strongly indicate that 3HTA and 3HPA behave as metabolic inhibitors, uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation and mPT inducers in skeletal muscle. It is proposed that these pathomechanisms disrupting mitochondrial homeostasis may be involved in the muscle alterations characteristic of MTP and LCHAD deficiencies.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Patients commonly present severe cardiomyopathy for which the pathogenesis is still poorly established. We investigated the effects of 3HTA and 3HPA, the major metabolites accumulating in these disorders, on important parameters of mitochondrial homeostasis in Ca(2+) -loaded heart . 3HTA and 3HPA significantly decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, the matrix NAD(P)H pool and Ca(2+) retention capacity, and also induced mitochondrial swelling. These fatty acids also provoked a marked decrease of ATP production reflecting severe energy dysfunction. Furthermore, 3HTA-induced mitochondrial alterations were completely prevented by the classical mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT) inhibitors cyclosporin A and ADP, as well as by ruthenium red, a Ca(2+) uptake blocker, indicating that LCHFAs induced Ca(2+)-dependent mPT pore opening. Milder effects only achieved at higher doses of LCHFAs were observed in brain , implying a higher vulnerability of heart to these fatty acids. By contrast, 3HTA and docosanoic acids did not change mitochondrial homeostasis, indicating selective effects for monocarboxylic LCHFAs. The present data indicate that the major LCHFAs accumulating in mitochondrial trifunctional protein and long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiencies induce mPT pore opening, compromising Ca(2+) homeostasis and oxidative phosphorylation more intensely in the heart.

We undertook metabolomic and lipidomic phenotyping of a cohort of heart failure (HF) patients and utilized Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) to identify associations to CPET and HFBio test performance (peak oxygen consumption (Peak VO2), oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES), exercise duration, and minute ventilation-carbon dioxide production slope (VE/VCO2 slope), as well as the established HF biomarkers of inflammation C-reactive protein (CRP), beta-galactoside-binding protein (galectin-3), and N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)). A cohort of 49 patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction < 50%, predominantly males African American, presenting a high frequency of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension were used in the study. MRA revealed that metabolic models for VE/VCO2 and Peak VO2 were the most fitted models, and the highest predictors' coefficients were from Acylcarnitine C18:2, , citric , asparagine, and 3-hydroxybutiric . Metabolic Pathway Analysis (MetPA) used predictors to identify the most relevant metabolic pathways associated to the study, aminoacyl-tRNA and amino  biosynthesis, amino  metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, sphingolipid and glycerolipid metabolism, fatty  biosynthesis, glutathione metabolism, and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis (MSEA) found associations of our findings with pre-existing biological knowledge from studies of human plasma metabolism as brain dysfunction and enzyme deficiencies associated with lactic acidosis. Our results indicate a profile of oxidative stress, lactic acidosis, and metabolic syndrome coupled with  dysfunction in patients with HF tests poor performance.

At the very early stages ofphylogenesis, the ancient Archaea that formed  under symbiotic interaction with later bacterial cells conjointly formed yet another system. In this system, there are no cells' absorption of glucose if it is possible to absorb fatty acids from intercellular medium in the form of unesterfied fatty acids or ketonic bodies--metabolites of fatty acids. This is caused by objectively existed conditions and subsequent availability of substrates at the stages ofphylogenesis: acetate, ketonic bodies, fatty acids and only later glucose. The phylogenetically late insulin used after billions years the same dependencies at formation of regulation ofmetabolism offatty acids and cells' absorption of glucose. In order that syndrome ofresistance ceased to exist as afoundation of metabolic pandemic Homo Sapiens has to understand the following. After successful function ofArchaea+bacterial cells and considered by biology action of insulin for the third time in phylogenesis and using biological function of intelligence the content ofphylogenetically earlier  saturated fatty  infood can't to exceed possibilities of phylogenetically late lipoproteins to transfer it in intercellular medium and blood and cells to absorb it. It is supposed that at early stages of phylogenesis biological function of intelligence is primarily formed to bring into line "unconformities" of regulation of metabolism against the background of seeming relative biological "perfection". These unconformities were subsequently and separately formed at the level of cells in paracrin regulated cenosises of cells and organs and at the level of organism. The prevention of resistance to insulin basically requires biological function of intelligence, principle of self-restraint, bringing into line multiple desires of Homo Sapiens with much less extensive biological possibilities. The "unconformities" of regulation of metabolism in vivo are etiological factors of all metabolic pandemics including atherosclerosis, metabolic arterial hypertension, obesity and metabolic syndrome Tertiannondatum.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31327095>Azoramide improves mitochondrial dysfunction in palmitate-induced insulin resistant H9c2 cells.</a></h2><p>Azoramide is identified as a new compound with the dual properties for the improvement of ER-folding capacity in various cells as well as for the treatment of T2DM. Although the effect of azoramide in glucose-homeostasis in mammalians is not known very well, a limited number of experimental studies showed that it could improve the insulin sensitivity in genetically obese mice. Therefore, here, we aimed to investigate the direct effect of azoramide on insulin signaling in insulin-resistant (IR) cardiomyocytes using IR-modelled ventricular cardiomyocytes. This model was established in H9c2 cells using  incubation (50-μM for 24-h). The development of IR in cells was verified by monitoring the cellular 2-DG6P uptake assays in these treated cells. The 2-DG6P uptake was 50% less in the IR-cells compared to the control cells, while azoramide treatment (20-μM for 48-h) could prevent fully that decrease. In addition, azoramide treatment markedly preserved the IR-induced less ATP production and high-ROS production in these IR-cells. Furthermore, this treatment prevented the functional changes in mitochondria characterized by depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial fusion or fusion-related protein levels as well as cellular ATP level. Moreover, this treatment provided marked protection against IR-associated changes in the insulin signaling pathway in cells, including recovery in the phosphorylation of IRS1 and Akt as well as the protein level of GLUT4 and Akt. Our present results, for the first time, demonstrated that azoramide plays an important protective role in IR-cardiomyocytes, at most, protective action on mitochondria. Therefore, one can suggest that azoramide, as a novel regulator, can provide direct cardioprotection in the IR-heart, at most, via affecting mitochondria and can be a good candidate as a new drug for the treatment of IR-associated cardiovascular disorders in mammalians with systemic IR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25287814>High-protein diets prevent steatosis and induce hepatic accumulation of monomethyl branched-chain fatty acids.</a></h2><p>The hallmark of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is steatosis of unknown etiology. To test how dietary protein decreases steatosis, we fed female C57BL/6 J mice low-fat (8 en%) or high-fat (42 en%) combined with low-protein (11 en%), high-protein (HP; 35 en%) or extra-high-protein (HPX; 58 en%) diets for 3 weeks. The 35 en% protein diets reduced hepatic triglyceride, free fatty , cholesterol and phospholipid contents to ~50% of that in 11 en% protein diets. Every additional 10 en% protein reduced hepatic fat content ~1.5 g%. HP diets had no effect on lipogenic or fatty -oxidizing genes except Ppargc1α (+30%), increased hepatic PCK1 content 3- to 5-fold, left plasma glucose and hepatic glycogen concentration unchanged, and decreased inflammation and cell stress (decreased Fgf21 and increased Gsta expression). The HP-mediated decrease in steatosis correlated inversely with plasma branched-chain amino- (BCAA) concentrations and hepatic content of BCAA-derived monomethyl branched-chain fatty acids (mmBCFAs) 14-methylpentadecanoic (14-MPDA; valine-derived) and, to a lesser extent, 14-methylhexadecanoic  (isoleucine-derived). Liver lipid content was 1.6- to 1.8-fold higher in females than in males, but the anti-steatotic effect of HP diets was equally strong. The strong up-regulation of PCK1 and literature data showing an increase in phosphoenolpyruvate and a decline in tricarboxylic  cycle intermediates in liver reveal that an increased efflux of these intermediates from  represents an important effect of an HP diet. The HP diet-induced increase in 14-MPDA and the dietary response in gene expression were more pronounced in females than males. Our findings are compatible with a facilitating role of valine-derived mmBCFAs in the antisteatotic effect of HP diets.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The addition of α,ω-hexadecanedioic  (HDA) to Ca(2+)-loaded liver  was shown to induce a high-amplitude swelling of the organelles, a drop of membrane potential and the release of Ca(2+) from the matrix, the effects being insensitive to CsA. The experiments with liposomes loaded with sulforhodamine B (SRB) revealed that, like  (PA), HDA was able to cause permeabilization of liposomal membranes. However, the kinetics of HDA- and PA-induced release of SRB from liposomes was different, and HDA was less effective than PA in the induction of SRB release. Using the method of ultrasound interferometry, we also showed that the addition of Ca(2+) to HDA-containing liposomes did not change the phase state of liposomal membranes-in contrast to what was observed when Ca(2+) was added to PA-containing vesicles. It was suggested that HDA/Ca(2+)- and PA/Ca(2+)-induced permeability transition occurs by different mechanisms. Using the method of dynamic light scattering, we further revealed that the addition of Ca(2+) to HDA-containing liposomes induced their aggregation/fusion. Apparently, these processes result in a partial release of SRB due to the formation of fusion pores. The possibility that this mechanism underlies the HDA/Ca(2+)-induced permeability transition of the mitochondrial membrane is discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25728796>H2O2 release from the very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase.</a></h2><p>Enhanced mitochondrial generation of oxidants, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), is related to a large number of pathological conditions, including diet-induced obesity and steatohepatosis. Indeed, we have previously shown that high fat diets increase the generation of H2O2 in liver  energized by activated fatty acids. Here, we further study fatty- induced H2O2 release in liver , and determine the characteristics that regulate it. We find that this production of H2O2 is independent of mitochondrial inner membrane integrity and insensitive to purine nucleotides. On the other hand, palmitate-induced H2O2 production is strongly enhanced by high fat diets and is pH-sensitive, with a peak at a matrix pH of ~8.5. Using recombinantly expressed human very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, we are able to demonstrate that palmitate-induced H2O2 release may be ascribed to the activity of this enzyme alone, acting as an oxidase.

After PA exposure for 24 h, the  and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) became dilated, and lipid droplets and organelles were observed within autophagosomes. Cell viability decreased with an ATP reduction and the G2/M phase arrest. The expression of SOD-2, but not of SOD-1, markedly increased after PA exposure, which also elevated the number of cells generating ROS. PA enhanced the levels of proteins related to apoptosis, necroptosis, autophagy, and ER stress. Moreover, the inhibition of caspases, p53, necroptosis, or ER stress substantially rescued PA-induced cytotoxicity and, similarly, the inhibition of caspases and ER stress counteracted PA-induced changes in the cell cycle. Conversely, the inhibition of necroptosis and p53 signaling accelerated the changes in the cell cycle triggered by PA exposure. Blocking autophagy exacerbated PA-induced cytotoxicity and alterations in the cell cycle and caused disappearance of cellular components. These results suggest that PA induces apoptosis accompanied by autophagy through mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress, which are triggered by oxidative stress in Chang liver cells and that blocking autophagy accelerates cell damage following PA exposure.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The 91.2% (13)C enrichment in palmitoylcarnitine shows that little endogenous (M+0) palmitate contributed to its formation. The presence of M+2 myristoylcarnitine (95.7%) and M+2 acetylcarnitine (19.4%) is evidence for β-oxidation of perfused M+4 . Identical enrichment data were obtained in the respective acyl-CoAs. The relative (13)C enrichment in M+4 (84.7%, 69.9%) and M+6 (16.2%, 17.8%) stearoyl- and arachidylcarnitine, respectively, clearly shows that the perfused palmitate is chain-elongated. The observed enrichment of (13)C in acetylcarnitine (19%), M+6 stearoylcarnitine (16.2%), and M+6 arachidylcarnitine (17.8%) suggests that the majority of two-carbon units for chain elongation are derived from β-oxidation of [1,2,3,4-(13)C4]. These data are explained by conversion of the M+2 acetyl-CoA to M+2 malonyl-CoA, which serves as the acceptor for M+4 palmitoyl-CoA in chain elongation. Indeed, the (13)C enrichment in mitochondrial acetyl-CoA (18.9%) and malonyl-CoA (19.9%) are identical. No (13)C enrichment was found in acylcarnitine species with carbon chain lengths between 4 and 12, arguing against the simple reversal of fatty  β-oxidation. Furthermore, isolated, intact rat heart  1) synthesize malonyl-CoA with simultaneous inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1b and 2) catalyze the palmitoyl-CoA-dependent incorporation of (14)C from [2-(14)C]malonyl-CoA into lipid-soluble products. In conclusion, rat heart has the capability to chain-elongate fatty acids using -derived two-carbon chain extenders. The data suggest that the chain elongation process is localized on the outer surface of the mitochondrial outer membrane.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30657727>miR-21-5p regulates mitochondrial respiration and lipid content in H9C2 cells.</a></h2><p>Cardiovascular-related pathologies are the single leading cause of death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Previously, we found that a 5/6th nephrectomy model of CKD leads to an upregulation of miR-21-5p in the left ventricle, targeting peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α and altering the expression of numerous transcripts involved with fatty  oxidation and glycolysis. In the present study, we evaluated the potential for knockdown or overexpression of miR-21-5p to regulate lipid content, lipid peroxidation, and mitochondrial respiration in H9C2 cells. Cells were transfected with anti-miR-21-5p (40 nM), pre-miR-21-5p (20 nM), or the appropriate scrambled oligonucleotide controls before lipid treatment in culture or as part of the Agilent Seahorse XF fatty  oxidation assay. Overexpression of miR-21-5p attenuated the lipid-induced increase in cellular lipid content, whereas suppression of miR-21-5p augmented it. The abundance of malondialdehyde, a product of lipid peroxidation, was significantly increased with lipid treatment in control cells but attenuated in pre-miR-21-5p-transfected cells. This suggests that miR-21-5p reduces oxidative stress. The cellular oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was increased in both pre-miR-21-5p- and anti-miR-21-5p-transfected cells. Levels of intracellular ATP were significantly higher in anti-mR-21-5p-transfected cells. Pre-miR-21-5p blocked additional increases in OCR in response to etomoxir and . Conversely, anti-miR-21-5p-transfected cells exhibited reduced OCR with both etomoxir and , and the glycolytic capacity was concomitantly reduced. Together, these results indicate that overexpression of miR-21-5p attenuates both lipid content and lipid peroxidation in H9C2 cells. This likely occurs by reducing cellular lipid uptake and utilization, shifting cellular metabolism toward reliance on the glycolytic pathway. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Both overexpression and suppression of miR-21-5p augment basal and maximal mitochondrial respiration. Our data suggest that reliance on glycolytic and fatty  oxidation pathways can be modulated by the abundance of miR-21-5p within the cell. miR-21-5p regulation of mitochondrial respiration can be modulated by extracellular lipids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28667487>Tibolone Preserves Mitochondrial Functionality and Cell Morphology in Astrocytic Cells Treated with .</a></h2><p>Obesity has been associated with increased chronic neuroinflammation and augmented risk of neurodegeneration.

Ablation of SIRT5 enhances the systemic succinylation and malonylation of mitochondrial proteins, including various metabolic enzymes; however, its function in pancreatic β cells has not yet been clarified. In this study, we evaluated the effects of SIRT5 overexpression on glucolipotoxicity-induced apoptosis in β cell lines. Full-length SIRT5, which preferentially targeted to  and partially to the nucleus and cytoplasm, was overexpressed in NIT-1 cells. Chronic exposure to excess palmitate and glucose (High-PA-G) induced apoptosis and suppressed glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in β cells. SIRT5 overexpression significantly alleviated apoptosis under the High-PA-G condition, accompanied by suppressed Caspase 3 activity and reduced malondialdehyde levels. SIRT5 overexpression also improved β cell secretory capacity in response to glucose under the High-PA-G condition, suggesting its protective role in β cell function. Furthermore, SIRT5 overexpression reversed the decreasing trend of anti-apoptotic factors BCL-2 and BCL-XL expression under High-PA-G condition. Further regulation mechanisms between SIRT5 and these anti-apoptotic factors remains to be explored in future studies. Our data reveal that SIRT5 is a potentially protective factor for pancreatic β cells against glucolipotoxicity-induced apoptosis and cell dysfunction.Copyright © 2018.

We have reported that the interaction of JNK with mitochondrial Sab leads to inhibition of respiration, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), cell death and hepatotoxicity. We tested whether this pathway underlies  (PA)-induced lipotoxicity in hepatocytes.Primary mouse hepatocytes (PMH) from adeno-shlacZ or adeno-shSab treated mice and HuH7 cells were used.In PMH, PA dose-dependently up to 1mM stimulated oxygen consumption rate (OCR) due to mitochondrial β-oxidation. At ⩾1.5mM, PA gradually reduced OCR, followed by cell death. Inhibition of JNK, caspases or treatment with antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) protected PMH against cell death. Sab knockdown or a membrane permeable Sab blocking peptide prevented PA-induced mitochondrial impairment, but inhibited only the late phase of both JNK activation (beyond 4h) and cell death. In PMH, PA increased p-PERK and its downstream target CHOP, but failed to activate the IRE-1α arm of the UPR. However, Sab silencing did not affect PA-induced PERK activation. Conversely, specific inhibition of PERK prevented JNK activation and cell death, indicating a major role upstream of JNK activation.The effect of p-JNK on  plays a key role in PA-mediated lipotoxicity. The interplay of p-JNK with mitochondrial Sab leads to impaired respiration, ROS production, sustained JNK activation, and apoptosis.Copyright © 2015 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

DPP9 has been implicated in immunoregulation, disease pathogenesis and metabolism. The DPP9 enzyme-inactive (Dpp9 gene knock-in; Dpp9 gki) mouse displays neonatal lethality, suggesting that DPP9 enzyme activity is essential in neonatal development. Here we present gene expression patterns in these Dpp9 gki neonatal mice. Taqman PCR arrays and sequential qPCR assays on neonatal liver and gut revealed differential expression of genes involved in cell growth, innate immunity and metabolic pathways including long-chain-fatty- uptake and esterification, long-chain fatty acyl-CoA binding, trafficking and transport into , lipoprotein metabolism, adipokine transport and gluconeogenesis in the Dpp9 gki mice compared to wild type. In a liver cell line, Dpp9 knockdown increased AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, which suggests a potential mechanism. DPP9 protein levels in liver cells were altered by treatment with EGF, HGF, insulin or palmitate, suggesting potential natural DPP9 regulators. These gene expression analyses of a mouse strain deficient in DPP9 enzyme activity show, for the first time, that DPP9 enzyme activity regulates metabolic pathways in neonatal liver and gut.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In the hepatocyte, fatty acids are esterified to triacylglycerols (TAGs) and stored in lipid droplets (LDs). The lipid lowering action of 3,5-diiodo-L-thyronine (T2) on an in vitro model of hepatosteatosis was investigated in terms of fatty  and protein content of LDs, lipid oxidation and secretion.FaO cells were exposed to oleate/palmitate, then treated with T2.T2 reduced number and size of LDs, and modified their acyl composition by decreasing the content of saturated (SFA) vs monounsaturated (MUFA) fatty acids thus reversing the SFA/MUFA ratio. The expression of the LD-associated proteins adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP), oxidative tissue-enriched PAT protein (OXPAT), and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) was increased in 'steatotic' cells and further up-regulated by T2. Moreover, T2 stimulated the mitochondrial oxidation by up-regulating carnitine-palmitoyl-transferase (CPT1), uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) and very long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (VLCAD).T2 leads to mobilization of TAGs from LDs and stimulates mitochondrial oxidative metabolism of fatty acids, in particular of SFAs, and thus enriches of MUFAs the LDs. This action may protect the hepatocyte from excess of SFAs that are more toxic than MUFAs.© 2014 S.

Diet-induced obesity models (DIO) show that changes in hypothalamic  fusion and fission dynamics modulate metabolic dysfunction. Using three selective diet formula including a High fat diet (HFD), Cafeteria (CAF) and High Sugar Diet (HSD), we hypothesized that maternal diets exposure program leads to selective changes in hypothalamic  fusion and fission dynamics in male offspring leading to metabolic dysfunction which is exacerbated by a second exposure after weaning.We exposed female Wistar rats to nutritional programming including Chow, HFD, CAF, or HSD for 9 weeks (pre-mating, mating, pregnancy and lactation) or to the same diets to offspring after weaning. We determined body weight, food intake and metabolic parameters in the offspring from 21 to 60 days old. Hypothalamus was dissected at 60 days old to determine -ER interaction markers by mRNA expression and western blot and morphology by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Mitochondrial-ER function was analyzed by confocal microscopy using hypothalamic cell line mHypoA-CLU192.Maternal programming by HFD and CAF leads to failure in glucose, leptin and insulin sensitivity and fat accumulation. Additionally, HFD and CAF programming promote mitochondrial fusion by increasing the expression of MFN2 and decreasing DRP1, respectively. Further, TEM analysis confirms that CAF exposure after programing leads to an increase in  fusion and enhanced mitochondrial-ER interaction, which partially correlates with metabolic dysfunction and fat accumulation in the HFD and CAF groups. Finally, we identified that lipotoxic  stimulus in hypothalamic cells increases Ca overload into  matrix leading to mitochondrial dysfunction.We concluded that maternal programming by HFD induces hypothalamic  fusion, metabolic dysfunction and fat accumulation in male offspring, which is exacerbated by HFD or CAF exposure after weaning, potentially due to  calcium overflux.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30384366>Shengmai San Alleviates Diabetic Cardiomyopathy Through Improvement of Mitochondrial  Metabolic Disorder.</a></h2><p>Shengmai San (SMS), prepared from Panax ginseng, Ophiopogon japonicus, and Schisandra chinensisin, has been widely used to treat ischemic disease.

Glucose and  profiles, myocardial structure, dimension, and function, and heart weight to tibial length ratio were determined. Myocardial ultrastructural morphology was observed with transmission electron microscopy. Protein expression and activity of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex were assessed using western blotting and microplate assay kits. We also observed cellular viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, OXPHOS complex activity, and cellular ATP level in -stimulated H9C2 cardiomyocytes. Changes in the sirtuin (SIRT1)/AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) pathway and mitochondrial uncoupling signaling were assessed using western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR.Leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice exhibit obesity, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia, accompanied by distinct myocardial hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction. SMS at a dose of 3 g/kg body weight contributed to a recovery of diabetes-induced myocardial hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction. SMS administration led to an effective restoration of mitochondrial structure and function both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, SMS markedly enhanced SIRT1 and p-AMPKα protein levels and decreased the expression of acetylated-PGC-1α and uncoupling protein 2 protein.

We previously demonstrated that fatty  synthase (FASN) induced by hypoxia is a critical lipid metabolic factor determining the therapeutic efficacy of umbilical cord blood-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (UCB-hMSCs). Therefore, we investigated the mechanism of a major mitophagy regulator controlling lipid metabolism and therapeutic potential of UCB-hMSCs. This study revealed that Bcl2/adenovirus E1B 19kDa protein-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3)-dependent mitophagy is important for reducing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species accumulation, anti-apoptosis, and migration under hypoxia. And, BNIP3 expression was regulated by CREB binding protein-mediated transcriptional actions of HIF-1α and FOXO3. Silencing of BNIP3 suppressed free fatty  (FFA) synthesis regulated by SREBP1/FASN pathway, which is involved in UCB-hMSC apoptosis via caspases cleavage and migration via cofilin-1-mediated F-actin reorganization in hypoxia. Moreover, reduced mouse skin wound-healing capacity of UCB-hMSC with hypoxia pretreatment by BNIP3 silencing was recovered by . Collectively, our findings suggest that BNIP3-mediated mitophagy under hypoxia leads to FASN-induced FFA synthesis, which is critical for therapeutic potential of UCB-hMSCs with hypoxia pretreatment.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

However, therapies that can modulate the function of beta cells and thus prevent their failure have not been well explored. In this study, beta cell injury model was established with  (PA) to simulate the lipotoxicity (high-fat diet) found in T2DM. Sonodynamic therapy (SDT), a novel physicochemical treatment, was applied to treat injured beta cells. We found that SDT had specific effects on  and induced transient large amount of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in beta cells. SDT also improved the morphology and function of abnormal , inhibited inflammatory response and reduced beta cell dysfunction. The improvement of  was mediated by PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy. Additionally, SDT rescued the transcription of PINK1 mRNA which was blocked by PA treatment, thus providing abundant PINK1 for mitophagy. Moreover, SDT also increased insulin secretion from beta cells. The protective effects of SDT were abrogated when mitophagy was inhibited by cyclosporin A (CsA). In summary, SDT potently inhibits lipotoxicity-induced beta cell failure via PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy, providing theoretical guidance for T2DM treatment in aspects of islet protection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30572687>Theaflavins Improve Insulin Sensitivity through Regulating Mitochondrial Biosynthesis in -Induced HepG2 Cells.</a></h2><p>Theaflavins, the characteristic and bioactive polyphenols in black tea, possess the potential improving effects on insulin resistance-associated metabolic abnormalities, including obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the related molecular mechanisms are still unclear. In this research, we investigated the protective effects of theaflavins against insulin resistance in HepG2 cells induced by . Theaflavins significantly increased glucose uptake of insulin-resistant cells at noncytotoxic doses. This activity was mediated by upregulating the total and membrane bound glucose transporter 4 protein expressions, increasing the phosphor-Akt (Ser473) level, and decreasing the phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser307. Moreover, theaflavins were found to enhance the mitochondrial DNA copy number, down-regulate the PGC-1β mRNA level and increase the PRC mRNA expression. Mdivi-1, a selective mitochondrial division inhibitor, could attenuate TFs-induced promotion of glucose uptake in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells. Taken together, these results suggested that theaflavins could improve hepatocellular insulin resistance induced by free fatty acids, at least partly through promoting mitochondrial biogenesis. Theaflavins are promising functional food ingredients and medicines for improving insulin resistance-related disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25925080>H₂O₂-Activated Mitochondrial Phospholipase iPLA₂γ Prevents Lipotoxic Oxidative Stress in Synergy with UCP2, Amplifies Signaling via G-Protein-Coupled Receptor GPR40, and Regulates Insulin Secretion in Pancreatic β-Cells.</a></h2><p>Pancreatic β-cell chronic lipotoxicity evolves from acute free fatty  (FA)-mediated oxidative stress, unprotected by antioxidant mechanisms. Since mitochondrial uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2) plays antioxidant and insulin-regulating roles in pancreatic β-cells, we tested our hypothesis, that UCP2-mediated uncoupling attenuating mitochondrial superoxide production is initiated by FA release due to a direct H2O2-induced activation of mitochondrial phospholipase iPLA2γ.Pro-oxidant tert-butylhydroperoxide increased respiration, decreased membrane potential and mitochondrial matrix superoxide release rates of control but not UCP2- or iPLA2γ-silenced INS-1E cells. iPLA2γ/UCP2-mediated uncoupling was alternatively activated by an H2O2 burst, resulting from  (PA) β-oxidation, and it was prevented by antioxidants or catalase overexpression. Exclusively, nascent FAs that cleaved off phospholipids by iPLA2γ were capable of activating UCP2, indicating that the previously reported direct redox UCP2 activation is actually indirect. Glucose-stimulated insulin release was not affected by UCP2 or iPLA2γ silencing, unless pro-oxidant activation had taken place. PA augmented insulin secretion via G-protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40), stimulated by iPLA2γ-cleaved FAs (absent after GPR40 silencing).The iPLA2γ/UCP2 synergy provides a feedback antioxidant mechanism preventing oxidative stress by physiological FA intake in pancreatic β-cells, regulating glucose-, FA-, and redox-stimulated insulin secretion. iPLA2γ is regulated by exogenous FA via β-oxidation causing H2O2 signaling, while FAs are cleaved off phospholipids, subsequently acting as amplifying messengers for GPR40. Hence, iPLA2γ acts in eminent physiological redox signaling, the impairment of which results in the lack of antilipotoxic defense and contributes to chronic lipotoxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30581860>Analysis of Titin in Red and White Muscles: Crucial Role on Muscle Contractions Using a Fish Model.</a></h2><p>Several studies have compared molecular components between red and white skeletal muscles in mammals. However, mammalian skeletal muscles are composed of mixed types of muscle fibers. In the current study, we analyzed and compared the distributions of titin, lipid, phosphate ions, and fatty  levels in red and white muscles using a fish model (), which is rich in red and white muscles, and these are well separated. Oil-red O staining showed that red muscle had more-abundant lipids than did white muscle. A time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometric (TOF-SIMS) analysis revealed that red muscle possessed high levels of  and oleic , but white muscle contained more phosphate ions. Moreover, elastica-van Gieson (EVG) and Mito-Tracker green FM staining showed that collagen and elastic fibers were highly, respectively, distributed in connective tissues and  in red muscle. An electron micrographic analysis indicated that red muscle had a relatively higher number of  and longer sarcomere lengths and Z-line widths, while myofibril diameters were thicker in white muscle. Myofibrillar proteins separated by SDS-PAGE showed that the major giant protein, titin, was highly expressed in white muscle than in red muscle. Furthermore, ratios of titin to myosin heavy chain (MHC) (titin/MHC) were about 1.3 times higher in white muscle than red muscle. We postulated that white muscle is fit for short and strong contractile performance due to high levels of titin and condensed sarcomeres, whereas red muscle is fit for low intensity and long-lasting activity due to high levels of lipids and  and long sarcomeres.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30220205>Protocatechuic  Ameliorated -Induced Oxidative Damage in Endothelial Cells through Activating Endogenous Antioxidant Enzymes via an Adenosine-Monophosphate-Activated-Protein-Kinase-Dependent Pathway.</a></h2><p>Protocatechuic  (PCA, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic ), the main metabolite of anthocyanins, is widely distributed in fruits and vegetables and has been reported to possess a strong antioxidant activity. Herein, we aimed to investigate the protective effect of PCA against high  (PA)-induced oxidative damage and the underling molecular mechanisms in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). PCA reduced the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde and increased the activities of endogenous antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase 1, and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1). Metabolomic analysis showed that PCA affected numerous metabolites, especially some of which were related with energy . PCA also upregulated the phosphorylation of adenosine-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) at Thr through activating liver kinase B1 and then promoted the expression of p-Nrf2 and HO-1. Moreover, PCA reversed the decreased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α and significantly increased the mitochondrial density. Collectively, these results demonstrated that PCA attenuated PA-induced oxidative damage in HUVECs via an AMPK-dependent pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29725943>In Vitro Monitoring of the Mitochondrial Beta-Oxidation Flux of  and Investigation of Its Pharmacological Alteration by Therapeutics.</a></h2><p>The present study was designed to validate the functional assay that enables rapid screening of therapeutic candidates for their effect on mitochondrial fatty  oxidation.The two whole-cell systems (tissue homogenates and hepatocytes) have been evaluated to monitor the total beta-oxidation flux of physiologically important H- by measurement of tritiated water enrichment in incubations using UPLC coupled on-line to radioactivity monitoring and mass spectrometry.Our results with several known inhibitors of fatty  oxidation showed that this simple assay could correctly predict a potential in alteration of mitochondrial function by drug candidates.

It includied 3 groups of male rats of Wistar line (weight 250-300g) with 10 animals in each group. Myocardial infarction ("heart attack" group) was caused by ligation of the left coronary artery, diabetes ("diabetes" group)--by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin, and "control" group (intact animals). Myocardial infarction caused by ligation of the left coronary artery, and diabetes by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. Isolated cardiac myocytes were obtained by the enzymatic method. Oxygen consumption was assessed polarographically at different saturation incubation medium with oxygen ([O₂] ≤ 8 mg/l and ([O₂] ≥ 16 mg/l). Arachidonic and  acids were applied as fatty acids.It is established that the introduction of the incubation medium 20 µm arachidonic or  fatty  significantly increased the oxygen consumption of intact cardiomyocytes of rats. Both at the ischemic and at the diabetic injury to the heart the opposite result was obtained. The most pronounced decrease in oxygen consumption was indicated in the group with diabetes mellitus.The inhibitory effect of LCD on the rate of oxygen consumption may be associated with the influence of the ischemic or diabetic injury to the heart on the barrierfunction ofmitochondrial membranes of cardiomyocytes, the activity of membrane-associated enzymes and their associated processes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25982029>A component of the mitochondrial outer membrane proteome of T. brucei probably contains covalent bound fatty acids.</a></h2><p>A subclass of eukaryotic proteins is subject to modification with fatty acids, the most common of which are  and myristic . Protein acylation allows association with cellular membranes in the absence of transmembrane domains. Here we examine POMP39, a protein previously described to be present in the outer mitochondrial membrane proteome (POMP) of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei. POMP39 lacks canonical transmembrane domains, but is likely both myristoylated and palmitoylated on its N-terminus. Interestingly, the protein is also dually localized on the surface of the mitochondrion as well as in the flagellum of both insect-stage and the bloodstream form of the parasites. Upon abolishing of global protein acylation or mutation of the myristoylation site, POMP39 relocates to the cytosol. RNAi-mediated ablation of the protein neither causes a growth phenotype in insect-stage nor bloodstream form trypanosomes.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Obesity-related nephropathy (ORN) is a common kidney complication of obesity. Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases-1, (ACSL1), is a key enzyme in the oxidative metabolism of fatty acids in  and ACSL1 may play a direct role in renal lipid deposition and promote the progress of ORN. In this study, we focus on the renoprotective role of ACSL1 in ORN.  Electron microscopy, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, Western blot, and real-time PCR were used to detect the expression of ACSL1and Nrf2 in ORN patients, ob/ob mice and  (PA)-treated HK-2 cells. Oil red staining and Elisa Kit were used to detect the intracellular FFA and TG contents in ob/ob mice and PA-treated HK-2 cells. Dihydroethidium (DHE) staining and the MDA/SOD measurement were used to detect the ROS production. In order to demonstrate the role of ACSL1 and the interaction between ACSL1 and Nrf2 in ORN, related siRNA and plasmid were transfected into HK-2 cells.  More ROS production and renal lipid deposition have been found in ORN patients, ob/ob mice and PA-treated HK-2 cells. Compared with control, all the expression of ACSL1and Nrf2 were down-regulated in ORN patients, ob/ob mice and PA-treated HK-2 cells. The Nrf2 could regulate the expression of ACSL1 and the ACSL1 played the direct role in renal lipid deposition.  The Nrf2 is inhibited in ORN, resulting more ROS production and oxidative stress. Increased oxidative stress will suppress the expression of ACSL1, which could increase the intracellular FFA and TG contents, ultimately leading to renal lipid deposition in renal tubulars and accelerating the development of ORN.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24946182>Mitochondrial bioenergetics deregulation caused by long-chain 3-hydroxy fatty acids accumulating in LCHAD and MTP deficiencies in rat brain: a possible role of mPTP opening as a pathomechanism in these disorders?</a></h2><p>Long-chain 3-hydroxylated fatty acids (LCHFA) accumulate in long-chain 3-hydroxy-acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD) and mitochondrial trifunctional protein (MTP) deficiencies. Affected patients usually present severe neonatal symptoms involving cardiac and hepatic functions, although long-term neurological abnormalities are also commonly observed. Since the underlying mechanisms of brain damage are practically unknown and have not been properly investigated, we studied the effects of LCHFA on important parameters of mitochondrial homeostasis in isolated  from cerebral cortex of developing rats. 3-Hydroxytetradecanoic  (3 HTA) reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, NAD(P)H levels, Ca(2+) retention capacity and ATP content, besides inducing swelling, cytochrome c release and H2O2 production in Ca(2+)-loaded mitochondrial preparations. We also found that cyclosporine A plus ADP, as well as ruthenium red, a Ca(2+) uptake blocker, prevented these effects, suggesting the involvement of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) and an important role for Ca(2+), respectively. 3-Hydroxydodecanoic and 3-hydroxypalmitic acids, that also accumulate in LCHAD and MTP deficiencies, similarly induced mitochondrial swelling and decreased ATP content, but to a variable degree pending on the size of their carbon chain. It is proposed that mPTP opening induced by LCHFA disrupts brain bioenergetics and may contribute at least partly to explain the neurologic dysfunction observed in patients affected by LCHAD and MTP deficiencies.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Trimetazidine (TMZ), a partial inhibitor of lipid oxidation, has been proposed as a metabolic modulator for several cardiovascular pathologies. However, its mechanism of action is controversial. Given the fact that TMZ is able to alter mitochondrial metabolism, we evaluated the protective role of TMZ on mitochondrial morphology and function in an in vitro model of lipotoxicity induced by palmitate. We treated cultured rat cardiomyocytes with BSA-conjugated palmitate (25 nM free), TMZ (0.1-100 μM), or a combination of both. We evaluated mitochondrial morphology and lipid accumulation by confocal fluorescence microscopy, parameters of mitochondrial metabolism (mitochondrial membrane potential, oxygen consumption rate [OCR], and ATP levels), and ceramide production by mass spectrometry and indirect immunofluorescence. Palmitate promoted mitochondrial fission evidenced by a decrease in mitochondrial volume (50%) and an increase in the number of  per cell (80%), whereas TMZ increased mitochondrial volume (39%), and decreased mitochondrial number (56%), suggesting mitochondrial fusion. Palmitate also decreased mitochondrial metabolism (ATP levels and OCR), while TMZ potentiated all the metabolic parameters assessed. Moreover, pretreatment with TMZ protected the cardiomyocytes from palmitate-induced mitochondrial fission and dysfunction. TMZ also increased lipid accumulation in cardiomyocytes, and prevented palmitate-induced ceramide production. Our data show that TMZ protects cardiomyocytes by changing intracellular lipid management. Thus, the beneficial effects of TMZ on patients with different cardiovascular pathologies can be related to modulation of the mitochondrial morphology and function.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Docosahexaenoic  (DHA), the major polyunsaturated fatty  in the retina, protects cultured retina photoreceptors from apoptosis induced by oxidative stress and promotes photoreceptor differentiation. Here, we investigated whether eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), a metabolic precursor to DHA, had similar effects and whether retinal neurons could metabolize EPA to DHA. Adding EPA to rat retina neuronal cultures increased opsin expression and protected photoreceptors from apoptosis induced by the oxidants paraquat and hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ). , oleic, and arachidonic acids had no protective effect, showing the specificity for DHA. We found that EPA supplementation significantly increased DHA percentage in retinal neurons, but not EPA percentage. Photoreceptors and glial cells expressed Δ6 desaturase (FADS2), which introduces the last double bond in DHA biosynthetic pathway. Pre-treatment of neuronal cultures with CP-24879 hydrochloride, a Δ5/Δ6 desaturase inhibitor, prevented EPA-induced increase in DHA percentage and completely blocked EPA protection and its effect on photoreceptor differentiation. These results suggest that EPA promoted photoreceptor differentiation and rescued photoreceptors from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis through its elongation and desaturation to DHA. Our data show, for the first time, that isolated retinal neurons can synthesize DHA in culture. Docosahexaenoic  (DHA), the major polyunsaturated fatty  in retina photoreceptors, and its precursor, eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) have multiple beneficial effects. Here, we show that retina neurons in vitro express the desaturase FADS2 and can synthesize DHA from EPA.

Galectin-3 (Gal-3) induces cardiac inflammation and fibrosis in the context of obesity; however, its role in the metabolic consequences of obesity is not totally established. We have investigated the potential role of Gal-3 in the cardiac metabolic disturbances associated with obesity. In addition, we have explored whether this participation is, at least partially, acting on mitochondrial damage. Gal-3 inhibition in rats that were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 6 weeks with modified citrus pectin (MCP; 100 mg/kg/day) attenuated the increase in cardiac levels of total triglyceride (TG). MCP treatment also prevented the increase in cardiac protein levels of carnitine palmitoyl transferase IA, mitofusin 1, and mitochondrial complexes I and II, reactive oxygen species accumulation and decrease in those of complex V but did not affect the reduction in F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake observed in HFD rats. The exposure of cardiac myoblasts (H9c2) to  increased the rate of respiration, mainly due to an increase in the proton leak, glycolysis, oxidative stress, β-oxidation and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential. Inhibition of Gal-3 activity was unable to affect these changes. Our findings indicate that Gal-3 inhibition attenuates some of the consequences of cardiac lipotoxicity induced by a HFD since it reduced TG and lysophosphatidyl choline (LPC) levels. These reductions were accompanied by amelioration of the mitochondrial damage observed in HFD rats, although no improvement was observed regarding insulin resistance.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects a large proportion of the US population and is considered to be a metabolic predisposition to liver cancer. However, the role of adaptive immune responses in NAFLD-promoted HCC is largely unknown. Here we show, in mouse models and human samples, that dysregulation of lipid metabolism in NAFLD causes a selective loss of intrahepatic CD4(+) but not CD8(+) T lymphocytes, leading to accelerated hepatocarcinogenesis. We also demonstrate that CD4(+) T lymphocytes have greater mitochondrial mass than CD8(+) T lymphocytes and generate higher levels of mitochondrially derived reactive oxygen species (ROS). Disruption of mitochondrial function by linoleic , a fatty  accumulated in NAFLD, causes more oxidative damage than other free fatty acids such as , and mediates selective loss of intrahepatic CD4(+) T lymphocytes. In vivo blockade of ROS reversed NAFLD-induced hepatic CD4(+) T lymphocyte decrease and delayed NAFLD-promoted HCC.

To better understand the role of PINK1 and Parkin in metabolic stress, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) of PINK1 and Parkin followed by PA treatment. Our results showed that under lower concentrations of PA, PINK1 and Parkin can be activated and play a protective role in resisting the harmful effects of PA, including protecting the mitochondrial function and resisting cellular death, while under higher concentrations of PA, the expression of PINK1 and Parkin can be inhibited. These results suggest that PINK1-Parkin can protect mitochondrial function against metabolic stress induced by obesity or PA to a certain degree.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The results showed that tetracycline induced lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, and cell viability decline in HepG2 cells only under the circumstances of  overload. Tetracycline administration in rats led to significant decrement in blood lipids, while resulted in more than four times increment in intrahepatic triacylglycerol and typical microvesicular steatosis in the livers. The triacylglycerol levels were positively correlated with oxidative stress. Proteomic profiles of carbonylated proteins revealed 26 targeted proteins susceptible to oxidative modification and most of them located in . Among them, the long-chain specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenase was one of the key enzymes regulating fatty  β-oxidation. Oxidative modification of the enzyme in the tetracycline group depressed its enzymatic activity. In conclusion, the increased influx of lipid into the livers is the first hit of tetracycline-induced microvesicular steatosis. Oxidative stress is an essential part of the second hit, which may arise from the lipid overload and attack a series of functional proteins, aggravating the development of steatosis. The 26 targeted proteins revealed here provide a potential direct link between oxidative stress and tetracycline-induced steatosis.© 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Most reactive oxygen species generation in  occurs in complex III, due to an increase of semiquinone (Q(-)) half-life. When active, UCPs can account as a potential antioxidant system by decreasing ΔΨm and increasing mitochondrial respiration, thus reducing Q(-) life time. The hematophagous insect Rhodnius prolixus, a vector of Chagas disease, is exposed to a huge increase in oxidative stress after a blood meal because of the hydrolysis of hemoglobin and the release of the cytotoxic heme molecule. Although some protective mechanisms were already described for this insect and other hematophagous arthropods, the putative role of UCP proteins as antioxidants in this context has not been explored. In this report, two genes encoding UCP proteins (RpUcp4 and RpUcp5) were identified in the R. prolixus genome. RpUcp4 is the predominant transcript in most analyzed organs, and both mRNA and protein expression are upregulated (13- and 3-fold increase, respectively) in enterocytes the first day after the blood feeding. The increase in UCP4 expression is coincident with the decrease in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation by midgut cells. Furthermore, in  isolated from enterocytes, the modulation of UCP activity by  and GDP resulted in altered ΔΨm, as well as modulation of H2O2 generation rates. These results indicate that R. prolixus UCP4 may function in an antioxidation mechanism to protect the midgut cells against oxidative damage caused by blood digestion.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of ilexgenin A on endothelial homeostasis and its mechanisms. Palmitate (PA) stimulation induced endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and subsequent thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP)/NLRP3 inflammasome activation in endothelial cells, leading to endothelial dysfunction. Ilexgenin A enhanced LKB1-dependent AMPK activity and improved ER stress by suppression of ROS-associated TXNIP induction. However, these effects were blocked by knockdown of AMPKα, indicating AMPK is essential for its action in suppression of ER stress. Meanwhile, ilexgenin A inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation by down-regulation of NLRP3 and cleaved caspase-1 induction, and thereby reduced IL-1β secretion. It also inhibited inflammation and apoptosis exposed to PA insult. Consistent with these results in endothelial cells, ilexgenin A attenuated ER stress and restored the loss of eNOS activity in vascular endothelium, and thereby improved endothelium-dependent vasodilation in rat aorta. A further analysis in high-fat fed mice showed that oral administration of ilexgenin A blocked ER stress/NLRP3 activation with reduced ROS generation and increased NO production in vascular endothelium, well confirming the beneficial effect of ilexgenin A on endothelial homeostasis in vivo. Taken together, these results show ER stress-associated TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome activation was responsible for endothelial dysfunction and ilexgenin A ameliorated endothelial dysfunction by suppressing ER-stress and TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome activation with a regulation of AMPK. This finding suggests that the application of ilexgenin A is useful in the management of cardiovascular diseases in obesity.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

After additional feeding of the experimental diet for 8 weeks, mice in the HFD group were highly obese compared with the mice in the standard diet fed mice group. The mice in the AP-treated group showed less fat pad accumulation and less inflammatory cytokines without body weight reduction. The weight of skeletal muscle in the AP group tended to increase as compared with that of the HFD group. Furthermore, AP reduced the expression of atrophic genes, including MuRF1 and Atrogin-1, but increased the exercise capacity. The mitochondrial function and mitochondrial biogenesis were enhanced by AP. In cultured C2C12 cells, AP also suppressed -induced muscle atrophy and mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, AP activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the C2C12 and the muscle of HFD-induced obese mice.The results suggested that AP ameliorated the obesity-induced skeletal muscle atrophy by attenuating mitochondrial dysfunction.© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

To address this, 19 older males (≥60 years) were randomized to a RET (n = 11) or to a waitlist control group (n = 8) that remained sedentary for 12 weeks. RET was comprised of three upper body and four lower body movements on resistance machines. One set of 8-12 repetitions to failure of each movement was performed on three nonconsecutive days/week. Improvements in chest press and leg press strength were assessed using a three-repetition maximum (3 RM). Body composition was assessed via dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle at baseline and at both 3 weeks and 12 weeks. Palmitate and pyruvate oxidation rates were measured from the (14)CO2 produced from [1-(14)C]  and [U-(14)C] pyruvate, respectively, during incubation of muscle homogenates. PGC-1α, TFAM, and PPARδ levels were quantified using qRT-PCR Citrate synthase (CS) and β-HAD activities were determined spectrophotometrically. Mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were assessed using the Amplex Red Hydrogen Peroxide/Peroxidase assay. There were no significant changes in body weight or body composition following the intervention. Chest press and leg press strength (3RM) increased ~34% (both P < 0.01) with RET There were no significant changes in pyruvate or fatty  oxidation or in the expression of target genes with the intervention. There was a modest increase (P < 0.05) in βHAD activity with RET at 12 weeks but the change in CS enzyme activity was not significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in ROS production in either group following RET Taken together, the findings of this study suggest that 12 weeks of low volume RET does not increase skeletal muscle oxidative capacity or reduce ROS production in older adults.© 2016 The Authors.

However, the mechanisms underlying endothelial inflammation induction are not completely understood. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an important molecule in immunity and inflammation. In the present study, we sought to determine the role of STING in -induced endothelial activation/inflammation.In cultured endothelial cells,  treatment activated STING, as indicated by its perinuclear translocation and binding to interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), leading to IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. The activated IRF3 bound to the promoter of ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) and induced ICAM-1 expression and monocyte-endothelial cell adhesion. When analyzing the upstream signaling, we found that  activated STING by inducing mitochondrial damage.  treatment caused mitochondrial damage and leakage of mitochondrial DNA into the cytosol. Through the cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase), the mitochondrial damage and leaked cytosolic mitochondrial DNA activated the STING-IRF3 pathway and increased ICAM-1 expression. In mice with diet-induced obesity, the STING-IRF3 pathway was activated in adipose tissue. However, STING deficiency ( ) partially prevented diet-induced adipose tissue inflammation, obesity, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance.The mitochondrial damage-cGAS-STING-IRF3 pathway is critically involved in metabolic stress-induced endothelial inflammation.

Calcium (Ca) homeostasis is considered to play a key role in ER stress. Matrine (Mat) has been applied for the treatment of hepatitis B, but its effect on NAFLD is still unknown, and there is no unified view of Mat on the regulation of ER stress in the previous literature.The pharmacological effects were studied in high--diet or methionine-choline-deficient diet induced C57BL/6J mice models and in  (PA) induced L02 human liver cell model. Calcium fluorescence experiments, computational virtual docking analysis and biochemical assays were used in identifying the locus of Mat.The results showed that Mat-treated mice were more resistant to steatosis in the liver than vehicle-treated mice and that Mat significantly reduced hepatic inflammation,  peroxides. The beneficial effect of Mat was associated with suppressing ER stress and restoring mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, Mat decreased the PA-induced  accumulation, ER stress and cytosolic calcium level ([Ca]) in hepatocyte cell lines in low and middle dose. However, the high dose Mat did not show satisfactory results in cell model. Calcium fluorescence experiments showed that Mat was able to regulate [Ca]. By computational virtual docking analysis and biochemical assays, Mat was shown to influence [Ca] via direct inhibition of SERCA.The results showed that the bi-directional regulation of Mat to endoplasmic reticulum at different doses was based on the inhibition of SERCA. In addition, the results also provide a theoretical basis for Mat as a potential therapeutic strategy in NAFLD/NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26161534>PINK1-Parkin-Mediated Mitophagy Protects Mitochondrial Integrity and Prevents Metabolic Stress-Induced Endothelial Injury.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial injury and dysfunction, a significant feature in metabolic syndrome, triggers endothelial cell dysfunction and cell death. Increasing evidence suggests that mitophagy, a process of autophagic turnover of damaged , maintains mitochondrial integrity. PINK1 (phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-induced putative kinase 1) and Parkin signaling is a key pathway in mitophagy control. In this study, we examined whether this pathway could protect  under metabolic stress. We found that  (PA) induced significant mitophagy and activated PINK1 and Parkin in endothelial cells. Knocking down PINK1 or Parkin reduced mitophagy, leading to impaired clearance of damaged  and intracellular accumulation of mitochondrial fragments. Furthermore, PINK1 and Parkin prevented PA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, ROS production and apoptosis. Finally, we show that PINK1 and Parkin were up-regulated in vascular wall of obese mice and diabetic mice. Our study demonstrates that PINK1-Parkin pathway is activated in response to metabolic stress.

Impairment of skeletal muscle function is closely associated with the progression of diabetes. However, the entire pathological characteristics and mechanisms of pre-diabetes in skeletal muscle remain fully unknown. Here, we established a mouse model of pre-diabetes, in which 6-week-old male C57BL6/J mice were fed either normal diet or high- diet (HFD) for 8 or 16 weeks. Both non-fasting and fasting glucose levels and the results of glucose and insulin tolerance tests showed that mice fed an 8-week HFD developed pre-diabetes with IGT; whereas mice fed a 16-week HFD presented with impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance (IFG-IGT). Mice at both stages of pre-diabetes displayed decreased numbers of mitochondria in skeletal muscle. Moreover, IFG-IGT mice exhibited decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production in skeletal muscle and muscle degeneration characterized by a shift in muscle fibers from predominantly oxidative type I to glycolytic type II. Western blotting and histological analysis confirmed that myoblast differentiation was only inhibited in IFG-IGT mice. For primary skeletal muscle satellite cells, inhibition of differentiation was observed in -induced insulin resistance model. Moreover, enhanced myoblast differentiation increased glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity. These findings indicate that pre-diabetes result in mitochondrial dysfunction and inhibition of myoblast differentiation in skeletal muscle. Therefore, interventions that enhance myoblast differentiation may improve insulin resistance of diabetes at the earlier stage.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24625219>Short-term cigarette smoke exposure leads to metabolic alterations in lung alveolar cells.</a></h2><p>Cigarette smoke (CS)-induced alveolar destruction and energy metabolism changes are known contributors to the pathophysiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study examines the effect of CS exposure on metabolism in alveolar type II cells. Male A/J mice (8 wk old) were exposed to CS generated from a smoking machine for 4 or 8 weeks, and a recovery group was exposed to CS for 8 weeks and allowed to recover for 2 weeks. Alveolar type II cells were isolated from air- or CS- exposed mice. Acute CS exposure led to a reversible airspace enlargement in A/J mice as measured by the increase in mean linear intercept, indicative of alveolar destruction. The effect of CS exposure on cellular respiration was studied using the XF Extracellular Flux Analyzer. A decrease in respiration while metabolizing glucose was observed in the CS-exposed group, indicating altered glycolysis that was compensated by an increase in palmitate utilization; palmitate utilization was accompanied by an increase in the expression of CD36 and carnitine-palmitoyl transferase 1 in type II alveolar cells for the transport of palmitate into the cells and into , respectively. The increase in palmitate use for energy production likely affects the surfactant biosynthesis pathway, as evidenced by the decrease in phosphatidylcholine levels and the increase in phospholipase A2 activity after CS exposure.

One such influence is exemplified by the Crabtree effect (the glucose-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial respiration) as most  experiments are performed in glucose-containing media. Here, using high-resolution respirometry, we evaluated the oxidation of endogenous or exogenous substrates by cell lines harboring different metabolic profiles. We found that a 1-h deprivation of the main energetic nutrients is an appropriate strategy to abolish interference of endogenous or undesirable exogenous substrates with the cellular capacity of oxidizing specific substrates, namely glutamine, pyruvate, glucose, or palmitate, in . This approach primed  to immediately increase their oxygen consumption after the addition of the exogenous nutrients. All starved cells could oxidize exogenous glutamine, whereas the capacity for oxidizing palmitate was limited to human hepatocarcinoma Huh7 cells and to C2C12 mouse myoblasts that differentiated into myotubes. In the presence of exogenous glucose, starvation decreased the Crabtree effect in Huh7 and C2C12 cells and abrogated it in mouse neuroblastoma N2A cells.

We previously reported that augmenter of liver regeneration (ALR) alleviates ER stress and protects hepatocytes from lipotoxicity.

In this study, we investigated whether the protection against liver steatosis afforded by ALR is related to its inhibition of calcium overflow from the ER to the . The treatment of HepG2 cells with  (PA) upregulated IP3R expression, triggering ER-luminal Ca release and inducing ER stress. However, in ALR-transfected (ALR-Tx) HepG2 cells, PA-induced cell injury was clearly alleviated compared with that in vector-Tx cells. After exposure to PA, IP3R expression was downregulated and ER stress was effectively inhibited in the ALR-Tx cells, and ER-Ca release and simultaneous mitochondrial Ca uptake were lower than those in vector-Tx cells. The knockdown of ALR expression with shRNA abolished the protective effects afforded by ALR transfection. PA treatment also suppressed the interaction between BCL-2 and IP3R in HepG2 cells, whereas this interaction was massively enhanced in the ALR-Tx cells, effectively reducing the IP3R-mediated ER-Ca release and thus mitochondrial Ca influx. Our results suggest that the inhibition of ER stress by ALR is related to the interruption of the interaction between BCL2 and IP3R, demonstrating a novel mechanism of ER stress resistance in ALR-Tx cells.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168914>Attenuation of -Induced Lipotoxicity by Chlorogenic  through Activation of SIRT1 in Hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Saturated free fatty acids (FFAs) induce hepatocyte lipotoxicity, wherein oxidative stress-associated mitochondrial dysfunction is mechanistically involved. Chlorogenic  (CGA), a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compound, protects against high-fat-diet-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in liver. This study investigates whether CGA protects against FFA-induced hepatocyte lipotoxicity via the regulation of mitochondrial fission/fusion and elucidates its underlying mechanisms.AML12 cell, a non-transformed hepatocyte cell line, is treated with palmitate. Here, it is shown that CGA prevents palmitate-induced lipotoxicity by activation of SIRT1 regulated mitochondrial morphology. CGA treatment mitigates oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, as evidenced by a decrease in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and an increase in mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial membrane potential. CGA also significantly decreases Bax expression and thereby reduces -mediated caspase-dependent apoptosis. Mechanistically, CGA attenuates ROS-induced mitochondrial fragmentation by inhibiting dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) and enhancing Mfn2 expression. In contrast, the inhibitory effects of CGA on the generation of mitochondrial ROS and Drp1 are blocked by siRNA knockdown of SIRT1.Collectively, these findings show that supplementation with CGA protects hepatocytes from FFA-induced lipotoxicity through activation of SIRT1, which reverses the oxidative stress and dysfunction of mitochondrial biogenesis directly.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We also studied the effects of inhibiting or silencing NADPH oxidase on the -induced nitro-oxidative stress and subsequent OXPHOS inhibition. Exposure of cultured HepG2 cells to saturated fatty acids resulted in a significant decrease in the OXPHOS activity. This effect was prevented in the presence of a mimic of manganese superoxide dismutase.  reduced the amount of both fully-assembled OXPHOS complexes and of complex subunits. This reduction was due mainly to an accelerated degradation of these subunits, which was associated with a 3-tyrosine nitration of mitochondrial proteins. Pretreatment of cells with uric , an antiperoxynitrite agent, prevented protein degradation induced by . A reduced gene expression also contributed to decrease mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded subunits. Saturated fatty acids induced oxidative stress and caused mtDNA oxidative damage. This effect was prevented by inhibiting NADPH oxidase. These acids activated NADPH oxidase gene expression and increased NADPH oxidase activity. Silencing this oxidase abrogated totally the inhibitory effect of  on OXPHOS complex activity. We conclude that saturated fatty acids caused nitro-oxidative stress, reduced OXPHOS complex half-life and activity, and decreased gene expression of mtDNA-encoded subunits.

The mRNA and protein expression levels of CPT IA were enhanced significantly when the NEFA concentrations increased from 0 to 1.6 mmol/L and decreased significantly when the NEFA concentrations increased from 1.6 to 3.2 mmol/L. The mRNA and protein expression of ACC decreased gradually with increasing concentrations of NEFA.These findings indicate that increased NEFA significantly promote the activation and β-oxidation of fatty acids, but very high NEFA concentrations may inhibit the translocation of fatty acids into  of hepatocytes.

This study aims to delineate how mitophagy affects NLRP3 inflammasome activation in hepatic lipotoxicity. Mice were fed a high fat/calorie diet (HFCD) for 24 weeks. Primary rat hepatocytes were treated with  (PA) for various periods of time. Mitophagy was measured by protein levels of LC3II and P62. NLRP3, caspase-1, interleukin (IL)-18, and IL-1β at mRNA and protein levels were used as indicators of inflammasome activation. Along with steatotic progression in HFCD-fed mice, ratio of LC3II/β-actin was decreased concurrently with increased levels of liver P62, NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-1β, IL-18, and serum IL-1β levels in late-stage NASH. PA treatment resulted in mitochondrial oxidative stress and initiated mitophagy in primary hepatocytes. The addition of cyclosporine A did not change LC3II/Τοmm20 ratios; but P62 levels were increased after an extended duration of PA exposure, indicating a defect in autophagic activity. Along with impaired mitophagy, mRNA and protein levels of NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-18 and IL-1β were upregulated by PA treatment. Pretreatment with MCC950, N-acetyl cysteine or acetyl-L-carnitine reversed inflammasome activation and a pyroptotic cascade. Additionally, mitophagic flux was partially recovered as indicated by increases in LC3II/Tomm20 ratio, parkin, and PINK1 expression, and decreased P62 expression. The findings suggest that impaired mitophagy triggers hepatic NLRP3 inflammasome activation in a murine NASH model and primary hepatocytes. The new insights into inflammasome activation through mitophagy advance our understanding of how fatty acids elicit lipotoxicity through oxidant stress and autophagy in .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28189916>Chronic administration of saturated fats and fructose differently affect SREBP activity resulting in different modulation of Nrf2 and Nlrp3 inflammasome pathways in mice liver.</a></h2><p>The overconsumption of both saturated fats and fructose in the modern society has been related to the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the specific contribution of individual dietary components on the progression of NAFLD to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has been poorly investigated. Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate the dissimilar effects of these two dietary components on selected proinflammatory and antioxidant pathways in the liver of C57BL/6 mice fed a standard (SD), a 45% saturated fat (HFAT) or a 60% fructose (HFRT) diet for 12 weeks. HFAT diet evoked systemic metabolic alterations and overweight, not observed in HFRT mice. However, HFRT mice had a greater hepatic triglyceride deposition with increased ratio of triacylglycerols containing the  compared to HFAT, as assessed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. This effect is due to the higher activation of the SCAP/SREBP1c lipogenic pathway by HFRT feeding. In addition, we found inhibition of Keap1/Nrf2 antioxidant signaling and more robust stimulation of the Nlrp3 inflammasome pathway in the livers of HFRT-fed mice when compared with HFAT-fed mice, which is consistent with the recent finding that palmitate and SREBP1c are implicated in hepatic oxidative stress and inflammation. These effects were associated with increased hepatic inflammation, as confirmed by high expression of markers of leukocyte infiltration in the HFRT group. Thus, we hypothesize an amplifying loop among lipogenesis, palmitate, Nrf2 and Nlrp3 that leads to a higher risk of NAFLD progression to NASH in a high-fructose diet compared to a high-saturated fat intake.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The bile  phospholipid conjugate Ursodeoxycholyl lysophosphatidylethanolamide (UDCA-LPE) is a novel anti-inflammatory agent with hepatoprotective effects in murine high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD. The aim of this work was to study changes in the hepatic lipidome due to UDCA-LPE.High fat diet mouse model, mass spectometry, RT-PCR.Hepatic lipid extracts of HFD mice were analysed by mass spectrometry. The results determined higher levels of total, saturated, mono- and diunsaturated fatty acids (FA) in HFD mice, which were decreased by UDCA-LPE predominantly by the reducing the most abundant FA species  and oleic . Unlike other FA species, levels of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA), which are composed of arachidonic  (ARA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), were increased in HFD mice upon UDCA-LPE treatment, mainly due to elevated hepatic ARA pools. Analysis of hepatic phospholipids species showed a decrease in total phosphatidylcholine (PC), especially monounsaturated PC (PUFA-PC) levels in HFD mice. Loss of total PC was reversed due to UDCA-LPE by increasing hepatic PUFA-PC pools. Gene expression analysis showed that UDCA-LPE upregulated PPARα, a key transcriptional regulator of fatty  oxidation, as well as downstream target genes CPT1α and AOX, which are crucially involved in mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty  oxidation.UDCA-LPE modulates defective fatty  metabolism during experimental NAFLD thereby restoring altered lipid profiles in addition to its pronounced anti-inflammatory effects. Thus, UDCA-LPE may be a promising drug candidate for the management of NAFLD.© 2015 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal Foundation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24732014>Oleate prevents palmitate-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, insulin resistance and inflammatory signaling in neuronal cells.</a></h2><p>Elevated circulating levels of saturated free fatty acids (sFFAs; e.g. palmitate) are known to provoke inflammatory responses and cause insulin resistance in peripheral tissue. By contrast, mono- or poly-unsaturated FFAs are protective against sFFAs. An excess of sFFAs in the brain circulation may also trigger neuroinflammation and insulin resistance, however the underlying signaling changes have not been clarified in neuronal cells. In the present study, we examined the effects of palmitate on mitochondrial function and viability as well as on intracellular insulin and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathways in Neuro-2a and primary rat cortical neurons. We next tested whether oleate preconditioning has a protective effect against palmitate-induced toxicity. Palmitate induced both mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance while promoting the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65. Oleate pre-exposure and then removal was sufficient to completely block subsequent palmitate-induced intracellular signaling and metabolic derangements. Oleate also prevented ceramide-induced insulin resistance. Moreover, oleate stimulated ATP while decreasing mitochondrial superoxide productions. The latter were associated with increased levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α). Inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) attenuated the protective effect of oleate against palmitate, implicating PKA in the mechanism of oleate action. Oleate increased triglyceride and blocked palmitate-induced diacylglycerol accumulations. Oleate preconditioning was superior to docosahexaenoic  (DHA) or linoleate in the protection of neuronal cells against palmitate- or ceramide-induced cytotoxicity. We conclude that oleate has beneficial properties against sFFA and ceramide models of insulin resistance-associated damage to neuronal cells.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, the effect of fatty acids on NETosis has not been clearly established. In this study, we focused on the NETosis-inducing ability of several  molecules. We extracted the  molecules present in Arabian Gulf catfish (, Val) skin gel, which has multiple therapeutic activities. Gas chromatography⁻mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the  fraction-3 from the gel with NETosis-inducing activity contained fatty acids including a furanoid F- (F6; 12,15-epoxy-13,14-dimethyleicosa-12,14-dienoic ) and common long-chain fatty acids such as  (PA; C16:0), palmitoleic  (PO; C16:1), stearic  (SA; C18:0), and oleic  (OA; C18:1). Using pure molecules, we show that all of these fatty acids induce NETosis to different degrees in a dose-dependent fashion. Notably, F6 induces a unique form of NETosis that is rapid and induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by both NADPH oxidase (NOX) and mitochondria. F6 also induces citrullination of histone. By contrast, the common fatty acids (PA, PO, SA, and OA) only induce NOX-dependent NETosis. The activation of the kinases such as ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) is important for long-chain fatty -induced NETosis, whereas, in F--induced NETosis, Akt is additionally needed. Nevertheless, NETosis induced by all of these compounds requires the final chromatin decondensation step of transcriptional firing. These findings are useful for understanding F-- and other fatty -induced NETosis and to establish the active ingredients with therapeutic potential for regulating diseases involving NET formation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547786>Genomics of -laden human hepatocyte cultures enables drug target screening for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major health burden in need for new medication. To identify potential drug targets a genomic study was performed in -laden primary human hepatocyte (PHH) and human hepatoma cell cultures.PHH, HuH7 and HepG2 hepatoma cell cultures were treated with lipids and/or TNFα. Intracellular  load was quantified with the ORO assay. The Affymetrix HG-U133+ array system was employed to perform transcriptome analysis. The  droplet (LD) growth and fusion was determined by fluorescence microscopy. LD associated proteins were imaged by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and confirmed by Western immunoblotting. Bioinformatics defined perturbed metabolic pathways.Whole genome expression profiling identified 227, 1031 and 571 significant regulated genes. Likewise, the combined  and TNFα treatment of PHH, HuH7 and HepG2 cell cultures revealed 154, 1238 and 278 differentially expressed genes. Although genomic responses differed among in-vitro systems, commonalities were ascertained by filtering the data for LD associated gene regulations. Among others the LD-growth and fusion associated cell death inducing DFFA like effector C (CIDEC), perilipins (PLIN2, PLIN3), the synaptosome-associated-protein 23 and the vesicle associated membrane protein 3 were strongly up-regulated. Likewise, the PPAR targets pyruvate-dehydrogenase-kinase-4 and angiopoietin-like-4 were up-regulated as was hypoxia-inducible  droplet-associated (HILPDA), flotilin and FGF21. Their inhibition ameliorates triglyceride and cholesterol accumulation. TNFα treatment elicited strong induction of the chemokine CXCL8, the kinases MAP3K8, MAP4K4 and negative regulators of cytokine signaling, i.e. SOCS2&SOCS3. Live cell imaging of DsRED calreticulin plasmid transfected HuH7 cells permitted an assessment of LD growth and fusion and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy evidenced induced LD-associated PLIN2, CIDEC, HIF1α, HILPDA, JAK1, PDK4 and ROCK2 expression. Notwithstanding, CPT1A protein was repressed to protect mitochondria from  overload. Pharmacological inhibition of the GTPase-dynamin and the fatty  transporter-2 reduced  uptake by 28.5 and 35%, respectively. Finally, a comparisons of in-vitro/NAFLD patient biopsy findings confirmed common gene regulations thus demonstrating clinical relevance.The genomics of -laden hepatocytes revealed LD-associated gene regulations and perturbed metabolic pathways. Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed expression of coded proteins to provide a rationale for therapeutic intervention strategies.

Recently, silymarin has shown protective effects on renal tissue injury, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. The goal of this study was to investigate the potential capacity of silymarin to prevent renal injury during obesity induced by high fat diet (HFD) in mice. In vivo, male C57BL/6 mice received HFD (60% of total calories) for 12 weeks, randomized and treated orally with vehicle saline or silymarin (30mg/kg body weight/d) for 4 weeks. In vitro, human proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK2) were exposed to 300μM  (PA) for 36h followed by silymarin administration at different concentrations. The administration of silymarin significantly ameliorated HFD induced glucose metabolic disorders, oxidative stress and pathological alterations in the kidney. Silymarin significantly mitigated renal lipid accumulation, fatty  β-oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis in HFD mice and PA treated HK2 cells. Furthermore, silymarin partly restored mitochondrial membrane potential of HK2 cells after PA exposure. In conclusion, silymarin can improve oxidative stress and preserve mitochondrial dysfunction in the kidney, potentially via preventing accumulation of renal lipids and fatty  β-oxidation.Copyright © 2017.

It has been also shown that  (PA) activates NLRP3 inflammasome and promotes interleukin-1β (IL-1β) secretion in Kupffer cells (KCs). However, the specific mechanism of the NLRP3 inflammasome activation is unclear. We studies the molecular mechanisms by investigating the roles of Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) and NLRP3 on NAFLD development in patients, high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFL and methionine choline deficient (MCD) diet-induced NASH in wild type (WT), TXNIP-/- (thioredoxin-interacting protein) and NLRP3-/- mice, and isolated KCs. We found that the expressions of NLRP3 and TXNIP in human liver tissues were higher in NASH group than in NAFL group. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation analyses show that activation of the TXNIP-NLRP3 inflammasome protein complex occurred in KCs of NASH WT mice rather than NAFL WT mice, thus suggesting that the formation and activation of this protein complex is mainly involved in the development of NASH. NLRP3-/- mice exhibited less severe NASH than WT mice in MCD diet model, whereas TXNIP deficiency enhanced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and exacerbated liver injury. PA triggered the activation and co-localization of the NLRP3 inflammasome protein complex in KCs isolated from WT and TXNIP-/- but not NLRP3-/- mice, and most of the complex co-localized with  of KCs following PA stimulation. Taken together, our novel findings indicate that TXNIP plays a protective and anti-inflammatory role in the development of NAFLD through binding and suppressing NLRP3.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24206218>Nrf2 affects the efficiency of mitochondrial fatty  oxidation.</a></h2><p>Transcription factor Nrf2 (NF-E2 p45-related factor 2) regulates the cellular redox homoeostasis and cytoprotective responses, allowing adaptation and survival under conditions of stress. The significance of Nrf2 in intermediary metabolism is also beginning to be recognized. Thus this transcription factor negatively affects fatty  synthesis. However, the effect of Nrf2 on fatty  oxidation is currently unknown. In the present paper, we report that the mitochondrial oxidation of long-chain () and short-chain (hexanoic) fatty acids is depressed in the absence of Nrf2 and accelerated when Nrf2 is constitutively active. Addition of fatty acids stimulates respiration in heart and liver  isolated from wild-type mice. This effect is significantly weaker when Nrf2 is deleted, whereas it is stronger when Nrf2 activity is constitutively high. In the absence of glucose, addition of fatty acids differentially affects the production of ATP in mouse embryonic fibroblasts from wild-type, Nrf2-knockout and Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1)-knockout mice. In acute tissue slices, the rate of regeneration of FADH2 is reduced when Nrf2 is absent. This metabolic role of Nrf2 on fatty  oxidation has implications for chronic disease conditions including cancer, metabolic syndrome and neurodegeneration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30950061>Brefeldin A impairs porcine oocyte meiotic maturation via interruption of organelle dynamics.</a></h2><p>Brefeldin A (BFA) is a lactone antibiotic synthesized from  by several fungi that could block anterograde transport of proteins from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi apparatus by reversible disruption of the Golgi complex. Previous investigations have shown that BFA induces the apoptosis of cancer cells in mitosis and impairs asymmetric spindle positioning in meiosis. Here, we document that exposure to BFA in porcine oocytes compromises the meiotic maturation via disrupting both nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation. We found that BFA exposure collapsed the cytoskeleton assembly by showing the aberrant spindle organization with misaligned chromosomes and defective actin dynamics. Furthermore, the distribution of both  and cortical granules (CGs), two important indexes of cytoplasmic maturation of oocytes, was disturbed following BFA exposure. We finally validated that the localization of ovastacin, a component of CGs that is essential for the postfertilization removal of sperm-binding sites in the zona pellucida, was also perturbed in BFA-exposed oocytes, which might weaken their fertilization capacity. Collectively, these findings indicate that Golgi-mediated protein transport is indispensable for the porcine oocyte meiotic maturation.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27714805>Challenging of AS160/TBC1D4 Alters Intracellular Lipid milieu in L6 Myotubes Incubated With Palmitate.</a></h2><p>The Akt substrate of 160 kDa (AS160) is a key regulator of GLUT4 translocation from intracellular depots to the plasma membrane in myocytes. Likely, AS160 also controls LCFAs transport, which requires relocation of fatty  transporters. The aim of the present study was to determine the impact of AS160 knockdown on lipid milieu in L6 myotubes incubated with palmitate (PA). Therefore, we compared two different settings, namely: 1) AS160 knockdown prior to palmitate incubation (pre-PA-silencing, AS160 /PA); 2) palmitate incubation with subsequent AS160 knockdown (post-PA-silencing, PA/AS160 ). The efficiency of AS160 silencing was checked at mRNA and protein levels. The expression and localization of FA transporters were determined using Western Blot and immunofluorescence analyses. Intracellular lipid content (FFA, DAG, TAG, and PL) and FA composition were estimated by GLC, whereas basal palmitate uptake was analyzed by means of scintigraphy. Both groups with silenced AS160 were characterized by a greater expression of FA transporters (FAT/CD36, FATP-1, 4) which had contributed to an increased FA cellular influx. Accordingly, we observed that post-PA-silencing of AS160 resulted in a marked decrement in DAG, TAG, and PL contents, but increased FFA content (PA/AS160 vs. PA). The opposite effect was observed in the group with pre-PA-silencing of AS160 in which AS160 knockdown did not affect the lipid pools (AS160 /PA vs. PA). Our results indicate that post-PA-silencing of AS160 has a capacity to decrease the lipotoxic effect(s) of PA by decreasing the content of lipids (DAG and PL) that promote insulin resistance in myotubes.

Moreover, regenerated peripheral nerves often do not reach normal functionality. Here, we investigated cardiolipin in the process of neuro-differentiation, since cardiolipin is closely linked to the mitochondrial energy supply in cells. The NSC-34 hybrid cell line, produced by fusing neuroblastoma cells with primary spinal cord motor neurons, was used, since it shares several morphological and physiological characteristics with mature primary motor neurons. Their neuro-differentiation was supported by switching from normal to differentiation medium or by fatty  supplementation. Differentiation was evaluated by measuring neurite-sprouting parameters and PPARα expression. Cellular fatty  distribution was analyzed to indicate changes in lipid metabolism during differentiation. Cardiolipin was characterized by acyl-chain composition and the distribution of molecular cardiolipin species. Both, the switch from normal to differentiation medium as well as the administration of  and oleic  promoted neuro-differentiation. Stimulated differentiation was accompanied by changes in cardiolipin content and composition. The positive correlation between neuro-differentiation and concentration of those molecular cardiolipin species containing  and oleic  implied a link between differentiation of NSC-34 cells and cardiolipin metabolism. We further demonstrated the impact of cellular lipid metabolism, and particularly cardiolipin metabolism, during and NSC-34 neuritogenesis.

Among them, miR-33a is supposed to modulate the cholesterol export and fatty  oxidation, but whether miR-33a involves in the process of fatty liver disease is unclear. To disclose the hypothesis, we utilized miR-33a mimic and antisense to explore their effects in primary hepatocytes or high- diet (HFD)-fed mice. Treatment with  (PA) or HFD significantly increased the expression of miR-33a in hepatocytes or liver tissues. In primary hepatocytes, miR-33a mimic decreased mitochondrial function, including reduction of ATP production and oxygen consumption, whereas miR-33a inhibition protected PA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Interestingly, miR-33a selectively suppressed mitochondrial complex I activity and protein expression, but not other complexes. Through bioinformatics prediction, we found miR-33a directly targeted on the 3'-UTR of NDUFA5. Dual-luciferase reporter analysis further confirmed the direct suppression of miR-33a on NDUFA5 expression. More importantly, administration of miR-33a antisense could effectively restore HFD-induced mitochondrial dysfunction through up-regulation of NDUFA5 levels. Mice treated with miR-33a antisense also exhibited improved liver function and structural disorders under obese status. Taken together, miR-33a was an important mediator of hepatocyte mitochondrial function, and the therapeutic benefits implied miR-33a antisense had the potential clinical application in combating the fatty liver disease.© 2018 The Authors.

Herein, we analyze the consequences of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)/metabolism disorder associated with the cell-specific hematopoietic ablation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). AIF-null (AIF ) mice developed pancytopenia that was associated with hypocellular bone marrow (BM) and thymus atrophy. Although myeloid cells were relatively spared, the B-cell and erythroid lineages were altered with increased frequencies of precursor B cells, pro-erythroblasts I, and basophilic erythroblasts II. T-cell populations were dramatically reduced with a thymopoiesis blockade at a double negative (DN) immature state, with DN1 accumulation and delayed DN2/DN3 and DN3/DN4 transitions. In BM cells, the OXPHOS/metabolism dysfunction provoked by the loss of AIF was counterbalanced by the augmentation of the mitochondrial biogenesis and a shift towards anaerobic glycolysis. Nevertheless, in a caspase-independent process, the resulting excess of reactive oxygen species compromised the viability of the hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and progenitors. This led to the progressive exhaustion of the HSC pool, a reduced capacity of the BM progenitors to differentiate into colonies in methylcellulose assays, and the absence of cell-autonomous HSC repopulating potential in vivo. In contrast to BM cells, AIF thymocytes compensated for the OXPHOS breakdown by enhancing fatty  β-oxidation. By over-expressing CPT1, ACADL and PDK4, three key enzymes facilitating fatty  β-oxidation (e.g.,  assimilation), the AIF thymocytes retrieved the ATP levels of the AIF  cells. As a consequence, it was possible to significantly reestablish AIF thymopoiesis in vivo by feeding the animals with a high-fat diet complemented with an antioxidant. Overall, our data reveal that the mitochondrial signals regulated by AIF are critical to hematopoietic decision-making. Emerging as a link between mitochondrial metabolism and hematopoietic cell fate, AIF-mediated OXPHOS regulation represents a target for the development of new immunomodulatory therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31384536>Regulation of microbiota-GLP1 axis by sennoside A in diet-induced obese mice.</a></h2><p>Sennoside A (SA) is a bioactive component of Chinese herbal medicines with an activity of irritant laxative, which is often used in the treatment of constipation and obesity. However, its activity remains unknown in the regulation of insulin sensitivity. In this study, the impact of SA on insulin sensitivity was tested in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice through dietary supplementation. At a dosage of 30 mg/kg/day, SA improved insulin sensitivity in the mice after 8-week treatment as indicated by HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance) and glucose tolerance test (GTT). SA restored plasma level of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) by 90% and mRNA expression of  by 80% in the large intestine of HFD mice. In the mechanism, SA restored the gut microbiota profile, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and mucosal structure in the colon. A mitochondrial stress was observed in the enterocytes of HFD mice with ATP elevation, structural damage, and complex dysfunction. The mitochondrial response was induced in enterocytes by the dietary fat as the same responses were induced by  in the cell culture. The mitochondrial response was inhibited in HFD mice by SA treatment.

ACC1 localizes in the cytoplasm and produces malonyl-CoA for fatty  (FA) synthesis. ACC2 localizes in the outer mitochondrial membrane and produces malonyl-CoA that inhibits FA import into  for subsequent oxidation. We hypothesized that ACCs are checkpoints in adipocyte differentiation and tested this hypothesis using the ACC1 and ACC2 inhibitor soraphen A (SA) in murine 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. When 3T3-L1 cells were treated with 100nM SA for 8 days after induction of differentiation, the expression of PPARγ mRNA and FABP4 mRNA decreased by 40% and 50%, respectively, compared with solvent controls; the decrease in gene expression was accompanied by a decrease in FABP4 protein expression and associated with a decrease in lipid droplet accumulation. The rate of FA oxidation was 300% greater in SA-treated cells compared with vehicle controls. Treatment with exogenous palmitate restored PPARγ and FABP4 mRNA expression and FABP4 protein expression in SA-treated cells. In contrast, SA did not alter lipid accumulation if treatment was initiated on day eight after induction of differentiation. We conclude that loss of ACC1-dependent FA synthesis and loss of ACC2-dependent inhibition of FA oxidation prevent lipid accumulation in adipocytes and inhibit early stages of adipocyte differentiation.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We previously reported that Bscl2 (-/-) mice develop lipodystrophy of white adipose tissue (WAT) due to unbridled lipolysis. The residual epididymal WAT (EWAT) displays a browning phenotype with much smaller lipid droplets (LD) and higher expression of brown adipose tissue marker proteins. Here we used targeted lipidomics and gene expression profiling to analyze lipid profiles as well as genes involved in lipid metabolism in WAT of wild-type and Bscl2(-/-) mice. Analysis of total saponified fatty acids revealed that the residual EWAT of Bscl2(-/-) mice contained a much higher proportion of oleic 18:1n9  concomitant with a lower proportion of  16:0 , as well as increased n3- polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) remodeling. The acyl chains in major species of triacylglyceride (TG) and diacylglyceride (DG) in the residual EWAT of Bscl2(-/-) mice were also enriched with dietary fatty acids. These changes could be reflected by upregulation of several fatty  elongases and desaturases. Meanwhile, Bscl2(-/-) adipocytes from EWAT had increased gene expression in lipid uptake and TG synthesis but not de novo lipogenesis. Both  and peroxisomal β-oxidation genes were also markedly increased in Bscl2(-/-) adipocytes, highlighting that these machineries were accelerated to shunt the lipolysis liberated fatty acids through uncoupling to dissipate energy. The residual subcutaneous white adipose tissue (ScWAT) was not browning but displays similar changes in lipid metabolism. Overall, our data emphasize that, other than being essential for adipocyte differentiation, Bscl2 is also important in fatty  remodeling and energy homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29632826>Palmitoyl-ceramide accumulation with necrotic cell death in A549 cells, followed by a steep increase in sphinganine content.</a></h2><p>Ceramides (Cers) have recently been identified as key signaling molecules that mediate biological functions such as cell growth, differentiation, senescence, apoptosis, and autophagy. However, the functions of Cer accumulation in necrotic cell death remain unknown. The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between Cer accumulation with inhibition of the conversion pathway of Cer and concomitant necrotic cell death. In order to minimize the effect of apoptosis against necrotic cell death, A549 cells having the inhibiting effect of caspase 9 by survivin were used in this study. Consequently, Cer accumulation in A549 cells would likely be associated with a pathway other than the mitochondrial caspase-dependent pathway of apoptosis. Here, we showed that the dual addition of a glucosyl-Cer synthase inhibitor and a ceramidase inhibitor to A549 cell culture induced palmitoyl-Cer accumulation with Cer synthase 5 expression and necrotic cell death with lysosomal rupture together with leakage of cathepsin B/alkalization after 2-3 h, although it is unknown in this study whether the necrotic cell death was caused by the lysosomal rupture. This Cer accumulation was followed by a steep increase in sphinganine base levels via the activation of serine palmitoyltransferase activity brought about by the increase in palmitoyl-coenzyme A concentration as a substrate after 5-6 h. The increase in palmitoyl-coenzyme A concentration was achieved by activation of the fatty  synthetic pathway from acetyl coenzyme A.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27807900>Lipid composition of the canine sperm plasma membrane as markers of sperm motility.</a></h2><p>The fatty  composition of the sperm membrane is an important factor involved in the overall sperm quality, including motility. However, in the canine species, the exact composition of the plasma membrane is still unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the plasma membrane lipid composition of motile sperm cells and to compare it with asthenospermic samples, as an attempt to determine possible involvements of membrane lipids in dog sperm cell motility. The sperm-rich fraction of ten mature dogs was collected, and samples were subjected to density gradient centrifugation by Percoll , in order to separate motile and asthenospermic samples. Processed semen samples were evaluated for sperm motility, plasma and acrosome membrane integrity, mitochondrial activity and susceptibility to oxidative stress. Lipid plasma membrane composition was identified by mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). The motile sperm samples presented the following phospholipids in a high frequency in the plasma membrane: phosphatidylcholine 38:4 (composed of stearic and arachidonic fatty acids), phosphatidylcholine 36:1 (stearic and oleic fatty acids), phosphatidylethanolamine 34:4 (myristic and arachidonic fatty acids), glycerophosphatidic  36:4 ( and arachidonic fatty acids), phosphatidylcholine 40:4 plasmanyl and phosphatidylcholine 40:5 plasmenyl. Furthermore, no lipid markers were found in the asthenospermic samples. Results also indicate that differences on plasma membrane composition between motile and asthenospermic samples are crucial factors for determining sperm motility, sperm functionality and susceptibility to oxidative stress. In conclusion, plasma membrane lipid composition varies considerable between motile and asthenospermic samples. Therefore, lipid markers of sperm motility can be considered, such as phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine plasmanyl, phosphatidylcholine plasmenyl and phosphatidic .© 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28532786>Fluxomic evidence for impaired contribution of short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase to mitochondrial palmitate β-oxidation in symptomatic patients with ACADS gene susceptibility variants.</a></h2><p>Despite ACADS (acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, short-chain) gene susceptibility variants (c.511C>T and c.625G>A) are considered to be non-pathogenic, encoded proteins are known to exhibit altered kinetics. Whether or not, they might affect overall fatty  β-oxidation still remains, however, unclear.De novo biosynthesis of acylcarnitines by whole blood samples incubated with deuterated palmitate (16-H,15-H-palmitate) is suitable as a fluxomic exploration to distinguish between normal and disrupted β-oxidation, abnormal profiles and ratios of acylcarnitines with different chain-lengths being indicative of the site for enzymatic blockade. Determinations in 301 control subjects of ratios between deuterated butyrylcarnitine and sum of deuterated C2 to C14 acylcarnitines served here as reference values to state specifically functional SCAD impairment in patients addressed for clinical and/or biological suspicion of a β-oxidation disorder.Functional SCAD impairment was found in 39 patients. The 27 patients accepting subsequent gene studies were all positive for ACADS mutations. Twenty-six of 27 patients were positive for c.625G>A variant. Twenty-three of 27 patients harbored susceptibility variants as sole ACADS alterations (18 homozygous and 3 heterozygous for c.625G>A, 2 compound heterozygous for c.625G>A/c.511C>T).Our present fluxomic assessment of SCAD suggests a link between ACADS susceptibility variants and abnormal β-oxidation consistent with known altered kinetics of these variants.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The results obtained can be summarized as follows. (1) Oleic  (OA) permeabilizes liposomal membranes at much higher concentrations of Ca(2+) than  (PA): 1mM versus 100μM respectively. (2) The OA/Ca(2+)-induced permeabilization of liposomes is not accompanied by changes in the phase state of lipid bilayer, in contrast to what is observed with PA and Ca(2+). (3) The addition of Ca(2+) to the PA-containing vesicles does not change their size; in the case of OA, it leads to the appearance of larger and smaller vesicles, with larger vesicles dominating.

An essential component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain is coenzyme Q (CoQ). While cells synthesize CoQ mostly endogenously, exogenous supplementation with CoQ has been successful as a therapy for patients with CoQ deficiency. However, which tissues depend on exogenous CoQ uptake as well as the mechanism by which CoQ is taken up by cells and the role of this process in BAT function are not well understood. Here, we report that the scavenger receptor CD36 drives the uptake of CoQ by BAT and is required for normal BAT function. BAT from mice lacking CD36 displays CoQ deficiency, impaired CoQ uptake, hypertrophy, altered lipid metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, and defective nonshivering thermogenesis. Together, these data reveal an important new role for the systemic transport of CoQ to BAT and its function in thermogenesis.Copyright © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy, cytosolic NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2) is activated before retinal  are damaged. Our aim was to investigate the effect of lipids in the development of diabetic retinopathy.Reactive oxygen species (ROS, by 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate) and activities of Nox2 (by a lucigenin-based method) and Rac1 (by G-LISA) were quantified in retinal endothelial cells incubated with 50 μM palmitate in 5 mM glucose (lipotoxicity) or 20 mM glucose (glucolipotoxicity) for 6 to 96 hours. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage was evaluated by extended-length PCR and its transcription by quantifying cytochrome b transcripts.Within 6 hours of exposure of endothelial cells to lipotoxicity, or glucotoxicity (20 mM glucose, without palmitate), significant increase in ROS, Nox2, and Rac1 was observed, which was exacerbated by glucolipotoxic insult. At 48 hours, neither lipotoxicity nor glucotoxicity had any effect on mtDNA and its transcription, but glucolipotoxicity significantly damaged mtDNA and decreased cytochrome b transcripts, and at 96 hours, glucotoxicity and glucolipotoxicity produced similar detrimental effects on mitochondrial damage.Although during initial exposure, lipotoxic or glucotoxic insult produces similar increase in ROS, addition of lipotoxicity in a glucotoxic environment further exacerbates ROS production, and also accelerates their damaging effects on mitochondrial homeostasis. Thus, modulation of Nox2 by pharmacological agents in prediabetic patients with dyslipidemia could retard the development of retinopathy before their hyperglycemia is observable.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25945408>Smad3 deficiency protects mice from obesity-induced podocyte injury that precedes insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>Signaling by TGF-β/Smad3 plays a key role in renal fibrosis. As obesity is one of the major risk factors of chronic and end-stage renal disease, we studied the role of Smad3 signaling in the pathogenesis of obesity-related renal disease. After switching to a high fat diet, the onset of Smad3 C-terminal phosphorylation, increase in albuminuria, and the early stages of peripheral and renal insulin resistance occurred at 1 day, and 4 and 8 weeks, respectively, in C57BL/6 mice. The loss of synaptopodin, a functional marker of podocytes, and phosphorylation of the Smad3 linker region (T179 and S213) appeared after 4 weeks of the high fat diet. This suggests a temporal pattern of Smad3 signaling activation leading to kidney injury and subsequent insulin resistance in the development of obesity-related renal disease. In vivo, Smad3 knockout attenuated the high fat diet-induced proteinuria, renal fibrosis, overall podocyte injury, and mitochondrial dysfunction in podocytes. In vitro palmitate caused a rapid activation of Smad3 in 30 min, loss of synaptopodin in 2 days, and impaired insulin signaling in 3 days in isolated mouse podocytes. Blockade of either Smad3 phosphorylation by SIS3 (a Smad3 inhibitor) or T179 phosphorylation by flavopiridol (a CDK9 inhibitor) prevented the palmitate-induced loss of synaptopodin and mitochondrial function in podocytes. Thus, Smad3 signaling plays essential roles in obesity-related renal disease and may be a novel therapeutic target.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24212054>Insulin acutely improves mitochondrial function of rat and human skeletal muscle by increasing coupling efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation.</a></h2><p>Insulin is essential for the regulation of fuel metabolism and triggers the uptake of glucose by skeletal muscle. The imported glucose is either stored or broken down, as insulin stimulates glycogenesis and ATP synthesis. The mechanism by which ATP production is increased is incompletely understood at present and, generally, relatively little functional information is available on the effect of insulin on mitochondrial function. In this paper we have exploited extracellular flux technology to investigate insulin effects on the bioenergetics of rat (L6) and human skeletal muscle myoblasts and myotubes. We demonstrate that a 20-min insulin exposure significantly increases (i) the cell respiratory control ratio, (ii) the coupling efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation, and (iii) the glucose sensitivity of anaerobic glycolysis. The improvement of mitochondrial function is explained by an insulin-induced immediate decrease of mitochondrial proton leak. Palmitate exposure annuls the beneficial mitochondrial effects of insulin. Our data improve the mechanistic understanding of insulin-stimulated ATP synthesis, and reveal a hitherto undisclosed insulin sensitivity of cellular bioenergetics that suggests a novel way of detecting insulin responsiveness of cells.© 2013.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28214337>Palmitate induces mitochondrial superoxide generation and activates AMPK in podocytes.</a></h2><p>Studies have shown that high levels of serum free fatty acids (FFAs) are associated with lipotoxicity and type 2 diabetes.  (PA) is the predominant circulating saturated FFA, yet its role in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN) is not clear. Recently, one study suggested that mitochondrial superoxide production is related to AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity in diabetic mice kidneys. To elucidate the link between PA and oxidative stress and AMPK activity in DN, we compared the cultured murine podocytes exposed to PA and oleic  (OA). Incubation of cells with 250 μM PA or OA induced a translocation of CD36, a fatty  transport protein, with intracellular lipid accumulation. PA, but not OA, induced mitochondrial superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (H O ) generation in podocytes, as shown by enhanced fluorescence of MitoSOX Red and dichlorofluorescein (DCF), respectively. Costimulation of PA-treated cells with the H O scavenger catalase abolished the PA-induced DCF fluorescence. Only PA induced mitochondrial damage as shown by electron microscopy. The AMPK activity was determined by immunoblotting, measuring the ratio of phosphorylated AMPK (p-AMPK) to total AMPK. Only PA significantly increased the p-AMPK levels compared with controls. Addition of catalase to PA-treated cells did not affect the PA-stimulated p-AMPK levels. Collectively, our results indicate that PA induces mitochondrial superoxide and H O generation in cultured podocytes, which may not be directly linked to AMPK activation. Given that, PA seems to play an important role in the pathogenesis of DN through lipotoxicity initiated by mitochondrial superoxide overproduction.© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25595459>Association of low GLP-1 with oxidative stress is related to cardiac disease and outcome in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a pilot study.</a></h2><p>Oxidative stress (OS) contributes to cardiovascular damage in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The peptide glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) inhibits OS and exerts cardiovascular protective actions. Our aim was to investigate whether cardiac remodeling (CR) and cardiovascular events (CVE) are associated with circulating GLP-1 and biomarkers of OS in T2DM patients. We also studied GLP-1 antioxidant effects in a model of cardiomyocyte lipotoxicity. We examined 72 T2DM patients with no coronary or valve heart disease and 14 nondiabetic subjects. A median of 6 years follow-up information was obtained in 60 patients. Circulating GLP-1, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 activity, and biomarkers of OS were quantified. In T2DM patients, circulating GLP-1 decreased and OS biomarkers increased, compared with nondiabetics. Plasma GLP-1 was inversely correlated with serum 3-nitrotyrosine in T2DM patients. Patients showing high circulating 3-nitrotyrosine and low GLP-1 levels exhibited CR and higher risk for CVE, compared to the remaining patients. In palmitate-stimulated HL-1 cardiomyocytes, GLP-1 reduced cytosolic and mitochondrial oxidative stress, increased mitochondrial ATP synthase expression, partially restored mitochondrial membrane permeability and cytochrome c oxidase activity, blunted leakage of creatine to the extracellular medium, and inhibited oxidative damage in total and mitochondrial DNA. These results suggest that T2DM patients with reduced circulating GLP-1 and exacerbated OS may exhibit CR and be at higher risk for CVE. In addition, GLP-1 exerts antioxidant effects in HL-1 palmitate-overloaded cardiomyocytes. It is proposed that therapies aimed to increase GLP-1 may counteract OS, protect from CR, and prevent CVE in patients with T2DM.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Underscoring its bioenergetic influence, altered mitochondrial morphology is reported in tissues of patients and in animal models of metabolic dysfunction. In this study, we found that mitochondrial fission plays a vital role in the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The development of hepatic steatosis, oxidative/nitrative stress, and hepatic tissue damage, induced by a high-fat diet, were alleviated in genetically manipulated mice suppressing mitochondrial fission. The alleviation of steatosis was recapitulated in primary hepatocytes with the inhibition of mitochondrial fission. Mechanistically, our study indicates that fission inhibition enhances proton leak under conditions of free fatty  incubation, implicating bioenergetic change through manipulating mitochondrial fission. Taken together, our results suggest a mechanistic role for mitochondrial fission in the etiology of NAFLD. The efficacy of decreasing mitochondrial fission in the suppression of NAFLD suggests that mitochondrial fission represents a novel target for therapeutic treatment of NAFLD.Copyright © 2014 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24333689>Toxicity generated through inhibition of pyruvate carboxylase and carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 is similar to high glucose/palmitate-induced glucolipotoxicity in INS-1 beta cells.</a></h2><p>This work was initiated to determine whether toxicity generated through inhibition of mitochondrial fuel metabolism is similar to high glucose/palmitate (HG/PA)-induced glucolipotoxicity.

However, the exact mechanisms that underlie palmitate-induced pancreatic β-cell apoptosis and through which pathway Bcl-2 executes the protective effect are still unclear.A stable Bcl-2-overexpressing RINm5F cell clone (BMG) and its negative control (B45) were exposed to palmitate for up to 8 h, and cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and NF-κB activation were studied in time course experiments.Palmitate exposure for 8 h resulted in increased cell death rates, and this event was partially counteracted by Bcl-2. Bcl-2 overexpression promoted in parallel also a delayed induction of GADD153/CHOP and a weaker phosphorylation of BimEL in palmitate-exposed cells. At earlier time points (2-4 h) palmitate exposure resulted in increased generation of ROS, a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), and a modest increase in the phosphorylation of eIF2α and IRE1α.

In this work we studied the effect of ionic strength of the incubation medium on the kinetics of the processes that accompany Ca2+-dependent induction of the mitochondrial pore by fatty : organelle swelling, Ca2+ release from the matrix, changes in transmembrane potential (Δψ) and rate of oxygen consumption, and the release of cytochrome c from the intermembrane space. Two basic incubation media were used: sucrose medium and isotonic ionic medium containing KCl without sucrose. We found that 200 μM Ca2+ and 20 μM HDA in the presence of CsA effectively induce high-amplitude swelling of  both in the case of sucrose and in the ionic incubation medium. In the presence of CsA,  can rapidly absorb Ca2+ and retain it in the matrix for a while without reducing Δψ. Upon incubation in the ionic medium,  retain most of the added Ca2+ in the matrix for a short time without reducing the Δψ. In both cases the addition of HDA to the  2 min after the introduction of Ca2+ leads to the rapid release of these ions from the matrix and total drop in Δψ. The mitochondrial swelling induced by Ca2+ and HDA in non-ionic medium is accompanied by almost maximal stimulation of respiration. Under the same conditions, but during incubation of  in the ionic medium, it is necessary to add cytochrome c for significant stimulation of respiration. The mitochondrial swelling induced by Ca2+ and HDA leads to the release of cytochrome c in a larger amount in the case of ionic medium than for the sucrose medium.

Dihydromyricetin (DHM), a natural flavonoid, was reported to exert anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory bioactivities. However, the effect of DHM on atherosclerosis-related pyroptosis has not been studied. In the present study,  (PA) treatment led to pyroptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), as evidenced by caspase-1 activation, LDH release, and propidium iodide-positive staining; enhanced the maturation and release of proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome; and markedly increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) levels. Moreover, NLRP3 siRNA transfection or treatment with inhibitors efficiently suppressed PA-induced pyroptosis, and pretreatment with total ROS scavenger or mtROS scavenger attenuated PA-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and subsequent pyroptosis. However, DHM pretreatment inhibited PA-induced pyroptotic cell death by increasing cell viability, decreasing LDH and IL-1β release, improving cell membrane integrity, and abolishing caspase-1 cleavage and subsequent IL-1β maturation. We also found that DHM pre-treatment remarkably reduced the levels of intracellular ROS and mtROS and activated the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Moreover, knockdown of Nrf2 by siRNA abrogated the inhibitory effects of DHM on ROS generation and subsequent PA-induced pyroptosis. Together, these results indicate that the Nrf2 signaling pathway plays a role, as least in part, in the DHM-mediated improvement in PA-induced pyroptosis in vascular endothelial cells, which implies the underlying medicinal value of DHM targeting immune/inflammatory-related diseases, such as atherosclerosis.© 2017 BioFactors, 44(2):123-136, 2018.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26548865>Activation of Mitochondrial Uncoupling Protein 4 and ATP-Sensitive Potassium Channel Cumulatively Decreases Superoxide Production in Insect .</a></h2><p>It has been evidenced that mitochondrial uncoupling protein 4 (UCP4) and ATP-regulated potassium channel (mKATP channel) of insect Gromphadorhina coqereliana  decrease superoxide anion production.

The method relies on intravenous administration of [9,10-H(N)] combined with a non-β-oxidizable palmitate analog, [1-C]2-bromopalmitic . Pretreatment with etomoxir, a CPT1 inhibitor that prevents the shuttling of FAs into , markedly reduced the appearance of the β-oxidation product HO in circulation and reduced lipid uptake by oxidative tissues including heart and soleus muscle. Whole-body fatty oxidation was unaltered between chow- or high-fat-fed WT and transgenic mice expressing a mutant form of the AMPK γ3 subunit (AMPKγ3) in skeletal muscle. High-fat feeding increased lipid oxidation in WT and AMPKγ3 transgenic mice. In conclusion, this technique allows for the assessment of the effect of pharmaceutical agents, as well as gene mutations, on whole-body FA oxidation in mice.Copyright © 2018 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678035> Polysaccharides Prevent -Evoked Apoptosis and Autophagy in Intestinal Porcine Epithelial Cell Line via Restoration of Mitochondrial Function and Regulation of MAPK and AMPK/Akt/mTOR Signaling Pathway.</a></h2><p> polysaccharide (GLP) extracted from  (Leyss. ex Fr.) Karst, a traditional Chinese medicine, is a biologically active substance reported to possess anti-oxidative, anti-apoptotic, and neurological protection. However, it is unknown whether GLP have any protective effect against high-fat constituents-induced epithelial cell injury. The aim of this study was to investigate the protection and molecular mechanism of GLP on injury induced by  (PA) in the intestinal porcine epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2). First, we tested whether the treatment of GLP attenuate PA-induced IPEC-J2 cell death. GLP markedly blocked PA-caused cytotoxicity and apoptosis in IPEC-J2 cells. Moreover, GLP recovered the decreased mitochondrial function and inhibited activation of caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway. Interestingly, PA promoted cell apoptosis and autophagy through stimulation of phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and inhibition of phosphorylation of Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which was reversed by GLP. Taken together, this study revealed a protective effect of GLP against PA-evoked IPEC-J2 cell death through anti-apoptotic and anti-autophagic properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28510423>Phycocyanin-Functionalized Selenium Nanoparticles Reverse -Induced Pancreatic β Cell Apoptosis by Enhancing Cellular Uptake and Blocking Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)-Mediated  Dysfunction.</a></h2><p>Accumulation of  (PA) in human bodies could cause damage to pancreatic β cells and lead to chronic diseases by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Therefore, it is of great significance to search for nutrition-available agents with antioxidant activity to protect pancreatic islet cells against PA-induced damage. Phycocyanin (PC) and selenium (Se) have been reported to have excellent antioxidant activity. In this study, PC-functionalized selenium nanoparticles (PC-SeNPs) were synthesized to investigate the in vitro protective effects on INS-1E rat insulinoma β cells against PA-induced cell death. A potent protective effect was achieved by regulation of particle size and PC content. Among three PC-SeNPs (165, 235, and 371 nm), PC-SeNPs-235 nm showed the highest cellular uptake and the best protective activities. For cell cycle analysis, PC-SeNPs showed a better protective effect on PA-induced INS-1E cell apoptosis than PC or SeNPs, and PC-SeNPs-235 nm exhibited the best effect. Further mechanistic studies demonstrated that PA induced overproduction of intracellular ROS,  fragmentation, activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9, and cleavage of PARP. However, pretreatment of the cells with PC-SeNPs effectively blocked these intracellular events, which suggests that PC-SeNPs could protect INS-1E cells against PA-induced cell apoptosis via attenuating oxidative stress and downstream signaling pathways. This finding provides a great promising nutritional approach for protection against diseases related to islet damage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25540439>Lipotubuloids in ovary epidermis of Ornithogalum umbellatum act as metabolons: suggestion of the name 'lipotubuloid metabolon'.</a></h2><p>A metabolon is a temporary, structural-functional complex formed between sequential metabolic enzymes and cellular elements. Cytoplasmic domains called lipotubuloids are present in Ornithogalum umbellatum ovary epidermis. They consist of numerous lipid bodies entwined with microtubules, polysomes, rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and actin filaments connected to microtubules through myosin and kinesin. A few , Golgi structures, and microbodies are also observed and also, at later development stages, autolytic vacuoles. Each lipotubuloid is surrounded by a tonoplast as it invaginates into a vacuole. These structures appear in young cells, which grow intensively reaching 30-fold enlargement but do not divide. They also become larger due to an increasing number of lipid bodies formed in the RER by the accumulation of lipids between leaflets of the phospholipid bilayer. When a cell ceases to grow, the lipotubuloids disintegrate into individual structures. Light and electron microscope studies using filming techniques, autoradiography with [(3)H], immunogold labelling with antibodies against DGAT2, phospholipase D1 and lipase, and double immunogold labelling with antibodies against myosin and kinesin, as well as experiments with propyzamide, a microtubule activity inhibitor, have shown that lipotubuloids are functionally and structurally integrated metabolons [here termed lipotubuloid metabolons (LMs)] occurring temporarily in growing cells. They synthesize lipids in lipid bodies in cooperation with microtubules. Some of these lipids are metabolized and used by the cell as nutrients, and others are transformed into cuticle whose formation is mediated by cutinsomes. The latter were discovered in planta using specific anti-cutinsome antibodies visualized by gold labelling. Moreover, LMs are able to rotate autonomously due to the interaction of microtubules, actin filaments, and motor proteins, which influence microtubules by changing their diameter.© The Author 2014.

Previously, we demonstrated that tibolone, a synthetic steroid with estrogenic, progestogenic and androgenic actions, protects cells from mitochondrial damage and morphological changes induced by PA. Here, we have evaluated which estrogen receptor is involved in protective actions of tibolone and analyzed whether tibolone reverses gene expression changes induced by PA. Tibolone actions on astrocytic cells were mimicked by agonists of estrogen receptor α (ERα) and β (ERβ), but the blockade of both ERs suggested a predominance of ERβ on  membrane potential. Expression analysis showed a significant effect of tibolone on genes associated with inflammation such as IL6, IL1B and miR155-3p. It is noteworthy that tibolone attenuated the increased expression of TERT, TERC and DNMT3B genes induced by . Our results suggest that tibolone has anti-inflammatory effects and can modulate pathways associated with DNA methylation and telomeric complex. However, future studies are needed to elucidate the role of epigenetic mechanisms and telomere-associated proteins on tibolone actions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Recent studies have shown that the ER and mitochondrial membranes overlap by 15-20%, a region referred to as the '-associated ER membrane' (MAM). Some proteins, including sarco/ER calcium ATPase (SERCA), are located in the MAM and have an important role in Ca signaling and homeostasis between the ER and the . Our previous study showed that hepatic stimulator substance (HSS) inhibits the ER stress induced by reactive oxygen species, thus reducing mitochondrial damage. However, the mechanism underlying the protective effect of HSS on the ER and ER-mitochondrial interaction remains unclear. In this study, we confirmed that the exogenous expression of HSS protected the liver from steatosis in mice with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. More importantly, the protection provided by HSS allowed SERCA in the MAM compartment to function well, preventing the extensive influx of cytosolic free Ca to the , thus preserving the mitochondrial functions from calcium overload and relieving -induced hepatocyte steatosis.

Here, we used an acute inflammation model in which pigs were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and found that hepatic glycolysis and fatty  oxidation are both promoted. Acetyl-proteome profiling of LPS-infected pigs liver showed that inflammatory stress exacerbates the acetylation of mitochondrial proteins. Both mitochondrial glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 2 (GOT2) and malate dehydrogenase 2 (MDH2) were acetylated, and the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS) activity was stimulated to maintain glycolysis. With the use of C-carbon tracing in vitro, acetyl-CoA was found to be mainly supplied by lipid-derived fatty  oxidation rather than glucose-derived pyruvate oxidative decarboxylation, while glucose was mainly used for lactate production in response to inflammatory stress. The results of the mitochondrial experiment showed that acetyl-CoA directly increases MDH2 and, in turn, the GOT2 acetylation level affects MAS activity. Treatment with palmitate in primary hepatocytes from LPS-injected pigs increased the hepatic production of acetyl-CoA, pyruvate, and lactate; MAS activity; and hepatic MDH2 and GOT2 hyperacetylation, while the deficiency of long-chain acetyl-CoA dehydrogenase resulted in the stabilization of these parameters. These observations suggest that acetyl-CoA produced by fatty  oxidation promotes MAS activity and glycolysis via nonenzymatic acetylation during the inflammatory stress response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625810>Mitochondrial Metabolic Reprogramming by CD36 Signaling Drives Macrophage Inflammatory Responses.</a></h2><p> A hallmark of chronic inflammatory disorders is persistence of pro-inflammatory macrophages in diseased tissues. In atherosclerosis this is associated with dyslipidemia and oxidative stress, but mechanisms linking these phenomena to macrophage activation remain incompletely understood.  To investigate mechanisms linking dyslipidemia, oxidative stress and macrophage activation through modulation of immunemetabolism, and to explore therapeutic potential targeting specific metabolic pathways.  Using a combination of biochemical, immunological, and ex vivo cell metabolic studies, we report that CD36 mediates a mitochondrial metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to superoxide production in response to its ligand, oxLDL. Mitochondrial-specific inhibition of superoxide inhibited oxLDL-induced NF-κB activation and inflammatory cytokine generation. RNAseq, flow cytometry, H-labeled  uptake, lipidomic analysis, confocal and EM imaging, and functional energetics revealed that oxLDL upregulated effectors of long-chain fatty  (FA) uptake and mitochondrial import, while downregulating FA oxidation and inhibiting ATP5A, an electron transport chain (ETC) component. The combined effect is long-chain FA accumulation, alteration of mitochondrial structure and function, repurposing of the ETC to superoxide production, and NF-κB activation. Apoe null mice challenged with high fat diet showed similar metabolic changes in circulating Ly6C monocytes and peritoneal macrophages, along with increased CD36 expression. Moreover, mitochondrial ROS was positively correlated with CD36 expression in aortic lesional macrophages.  These findings reveal that oxLDL/CD36 signaling in macrophages links dys-regulated FA metabolism to oxidative stress from the , which drives chronic inflammation. Thus, targeting to CD36 and its downstream effectors may serve as potential new strategies against chronic inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25529328>Silencing miR-106b improves -induced mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance in skeletal myocytes.</a></h2><p>MicroRNA‑106b (miR‑106b) is reported to correlate closely with skeletal muscle insulin resistance. In the current study the effect of miR‑106b on  (PA)‑induced mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance was investigated in C2C12 myotubes via the silencing of miR‑106b. MiR‑106b expression was increased under PA treatment, while miR‑106b loss of function improved insulin sensitivity by upregulating its target mitofusin‑2 (Mfn2) in C2C12 myocytes. Furthermore, miR‑106b loss of function partly improved mitochondrial morphological lesions and increased the levels of mitochondial DNA and intracellular adenosine triphosphate that had been impaired by PA exposure in C2C12 myocytes. MiR‑106b loss of function attenuated the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and upregulated the expression levels of the estrogen‑related receptor (ERR)‑α/peroxisome proliferative activated receptor γ coactivator (PGC)‑1α/Mfn2 axis under PA exposure. In addition, miR‑106b negatively regulated skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and insulin sensitivity under PA‑induced insulin resistance by targeting Mfn2, which may be associated with reduced ROS and upregulation of the ERR‑α/PGC‑1α/Mfn2 axis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30733817>Resveratrol attenuates oxidative injury in human umbilical vein endothelial cells through regulating mitochondrial fusion via TyrRS-PARP1 pathway.</a></h2><p>Oxidative stress-induced damage in endothelial cells is a crucial initiator of atherosclerosis (AS), which is highly related to excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial dynamics. Resveratrol (RSV) exerts beneficial effects against endothelial oxidative injury, while the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Thus, we aimed to explore the role of  dynamics during the anti-oxidative activities of RSV in  (PA)-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and to verify whether tyrosyl transfer- RNA synthetase (TyrRS) and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) are targeted during this process.HUVECs were exposed to 200 μM of PA for 16 h before treated with 10 μM of RSV for 8 h. Cell viability was detected using Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. The intracellular ROS level and  membrane potential (MMP) were measured using microplate reader and flow cytometry. The malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase were measured using the microplate reader. The mitochondrial morphology and fusion process was observed under transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscopy. TyrRS and PARP1 were knocked down with the specific small interference RNAs (siRNA), and the protein expressions of TyrRS, PARP1, and mitochondrial fusion proteins (MFN1, MFN2, and OPA1) were measured by western blot.RSV treatment suppressed the PA-induced injuries in HUVECs, including the damage to cell viability, oxidative stress, and loss of MMP. Additionally, RSV improved the protein levels of MFN1, MFN2, and OPA1 as well as inhibited the PA-induced fragmentation of . However, the effects of RSV on oxidative stress and mitochondrial fusion were abolished by the pretreatment of siRNAs of TyrRS and PARP1, indicating that these effects of RSV were dependent on the TyrRS-PARP1 pathway.RSV attenuated endothelial oxidative injury by regulating mitochondrial fusion via TyrRS-PARP1 signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26408932>Free fatty  receptor 1 (FFAR1/GPR40) signaling affects insulin secretion by enhancing mitochondrial respiration during palmitate exposure.</a></h2><p>Fatty acids affect insulin secretion via metabolism and FFAR1-mediated signaling. Recent reports indicate that these two pathways act synergistically. Still it remains unclear how they interrelate. Taking into account the key role of  in insulin secretion, we attempted to dissect the metabolic and FFAR1-mediated effects of fatty acids on mitochondrial function. One-hour culture of MIN6 cells with palmitate significantly enhanced mitochondrial respiration. Antagonism or silencing of FFAR1 prevented the palmitate-induced rise in respiration. On the other hand, in the absence of extracellular palmitate FFAR1 agonists caused a modest increase in respiration. Using an agonist of the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor and PKC inhibitor we found that in the presence of the fatty  mitochondrial respiration is regulated via Gαq protein-coupled receptor signaling. The increase in respiration in palmitate-treated cells was largely due to increased glucose utilization and oxidation. However, glucose utilization was not dependent on FFAR1 signaling. Collectively, these results indicate that mitochondrial respiration in palmitate-treated cells is enhanced via combined action of intracellular metabolism of the fatty  and the Gαq-coupled FFAR1 signaling. Long-term palmitate exposure reduced ATP-coupling efficiency of  and deteriorated insulin secretion. The presence of the FFAR1 antagonist during culture did not improve ATP-coupling efficiency, however, it resulted in enhanced mitochondrial respiration and improved insulin secretion after culture. Taken together, our study demonstrates that during palmitate exposure, integrated actions of fatty  metabolism and fatty -induced FFAR1 signaling on mitochondrial respiration underlie the synergistic action of the two pathways on insulin secretion.Copyright © 2015.

Glucose fluctuation, more pronounced in patients with diabetes, has been recognized as an even stronger oxidative stress inducer than the sustained hyperglycemia. Here, we investigated the role of glucose variability in the development of the NAFLD based on hepatocyte apoptosis and possible mechanisms. To achieve this goal we studied C57BL/6J mice that were maintained on a high fat diet (HFD) and injected with glucose (3 g/kg) twice daily to induce intermittent high glucose (IHG). We also studied hepatic L02 cells incubated with  (PA) to induce steatosis. The following experimental groups were compared: normal glucose (NG), sustained high glucose (SHG) and IHG with or without PA. We found that, although hepatic enzyme levels and liver lipid deposition were comparable between HFD mice injected with glucose or saline, the glucose injected mice displayed marked hepatocyte apoptosis and inflammation, accompanied by increased lipid peroxide in liver. In vitro, in the presence of PA, IHG increased L02 cell apoptosis and oxidative stress and produced pronounced mitochondrial dysfunction relative to the NG and SHG groups. Furthermore, treatment with the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) inhibitor, cyclosporin A (1.5 μmol/l), prevented mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and hepatocyte apoptosis. Our data suggests that IHG under lipotoxicity might contribute to the development of NAFLD by increasing oxidative stress and hepatocyte apoptosis via MPT and its related mitochondrial dysfunction.© 2015 Society for Endocrinology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29413957>2-Chlorohexadecanoic  induces ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in brain microvascular endothelial cells.</a></h2><p>Peripheral leukocytes induce blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction through the release of cytotoxic mediators. These include hypochlorous  (HOCl) that is formed via the myeloperoxidase-HO-chloride system of activated phagocytes. HOCl targets the endogenous pool of ether phospholipids (plasmalogens) generating chlorinated inflammatory mediators like e.g. 2-chlorohexadecanal and its conversion product 2-chlorohexadecanoic  (2-ClHA). In the cerebrovasculature these compounds inflict damage to brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVEC) that form the morphological basis of the BBB. To follow subcellular trafficking of 2-ClHA we synthesized a 'clickable' alkyne derivative (2-ClHyA) that phenocopied the biological activity of the parent compound. Confocal and superresolution structured illumination microscopy revealed accumulation of 2-ClHyA in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and  of human BMVEC (hCMEC/D3 cell line). 2-ClHA and its alkyne analogue interfered with protein palmitoylation, induced ER-stress markers, reduced the ER ATP content, and activated transcription and secretion of interleukin (IL)-6 as well as IL-8. 2-ClHA disrupted the mitochondrial membrane potential and induced procaspase-3 and PARP cleavage. The protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK) inhibitor GSK2606414 suppressed 2-ClHA-mediated activating transcription factor 4 synthesis and IL-6/8 secretion, but showed no effect on endothelial barrier dysfunction and cleavage of procaspase-3. Our data indicate that 2-ClHA induces potent lipotoxic responses in brain endothelial cells and could have implications in inflammation-induced BBB dysfunction.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

In contrast to , unsaturated fatty acids produced significant increases in intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i) in both cell types. Increases were fatty  specific, dose-dependent and different for each cell type. The arachidonic  effects on [Ca2+]i were higher in spermatids than in spermatocytes and persisted when residual extracellular Ca2+ was chelated by EGTA, indicating that the increase in [Ca2+]i originated from release of intracellular calcium stores. At the concentrations required for these increases, unsaturated fatty acids produced no significant changes in the plasma membrane potential of or non-specific permeability in spermatogenic cells. For the case of arachidonic , the [Ca2+]i increases were not caused by its metabolic conversion to eicosanoids or anandamide; thus we attribute this effect to the fatty  itself. As estimated with fluorescent probes, unsaturated fatty acids did not affect the intracellular pH but were able to induce a progressive decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential. The association of this decrease with reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production strongly suggests that unsaturated fatty acids induced mitochondrial uncoupling. This effect was stronger in spermatids than in spermatocytes. As a late event, arachidonic  induced caspase 3 activation in a dose-dependent manner both in the absence and presence of external Ca2+. The concurrent but differential effects of unsaturated fatty acids on [Ca2+]i and mitochondrial functions are additional manifestations of the metabolic changes that germ cells undergo during their differentiation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26784190>Metformin Restores Parkin-Mediated Mitophagy, Suppressed by Cytosolic p53.</a></h2><p>Metformin is known to alleviate hepatosteatosis by inducing 5' adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-kinase-independent, sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)-mediated autophagy. Dysfunctional mitophagy in response to glucolipotoxicities might play an important role in hepatosteatosis. Here, we investigated the mechanism by which metformin induces mitophagy through restoration of the suppressed Parkin-mediated mitophagy. To this end, our ob/ob mice were divided into three groups: (1) ad libitum feeding of a standard chow diet; (2) intraperitoneal injections of metformin 300 mg/kg; and (3) 3 g/day caloric restriction (CR). HepG2 cells were treated with palmitate (PA) plus high glucose in the absence or presence of metformin. We detected enhanced mitophagy in ob/ob mice treated with metformin or CR, whereas mitochondrial spheroids were observed in mice fed ad libitum. Metabolically stressed ob/ob mice and PA-treated HepG2 cells showed an increase in expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers and cytosolic p53. Cytosolic p53 inhibited mitophagy by disturbing the mitochondrial translocation of Parkin, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation. However, metformin decreased ER stress and p53 expression, resulting in induction of Parkin-mediated mitophagy. Furthermore, pifithrin-α, a specific inhibitor of p53, increased mitochondrial incorporation into autophagosomes. Taken together, these results indicate that metformin treatment facilitates Parkin-mediated mitophagy rather than mitochondrial spheroid formation by decreasing the inhibitory interaction with cytosolic p53 and increasing degradation of mitofusins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26674288>The effect of oleic and  on induction of steatosis and cytotoxicity on rat hepatocytes in primary culture.</a></h2><p>In vitro models serve as a tool for studies of steatosis.  and oleic acids can induce steatosis in cultured hepatocytes. The aim of our study was to verify steatogenic and cytotoxic effects of  (PA), oleic  (OA) and their combinations as well as their impact on functional capacity of rat primary hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were exposed to OA or PA (0.125-2 mmol/l) or their combination at ratios of 3:1, 2:1 or 1:1 at the final concentrations of 0.5-1 mmol/l. Both OA and PA caused a dose-dependent increase in triacylglycerol content in hepatocytes. PA was more steatogenic at 0.25 and 0.5 mmol/l while OA at 0.75 and 1 mmol/l. PA exhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect associated with ROS production, present markers of apoptosis and necrosis and a decrease in albumin production. OA induced a damage of the cytoplasmic membrane from 1 mM concentration. Mixture of OA and PA induced lower cytotoxicity with less weakened functional capacity than did PA alone. Extent of steatosis was comparable to that after exposure to OA alone. In conclusion, OA or combination of OA with PA is more suitable for simulation of simple steatosis than PA alone.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31420721>Compound C attenuates NLRP3 inflammasome despite AMPK knockdown in LPS plus palmitate-induced THP-1 cells.</a></h2><p>NLRP3 inflammasome is a key contributor to obesity-related insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a principle intracellular energy sensor exerting protective effect against T2D. Strikingly, compound C, an inhibitor of AMPK, considerably inhibited the secretion of IL-1β when THP-1 cells were stimulated with LPS plus  (PA). The underlying mechanism was examined with respect to the effect of compound C on NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex which controls the processing and production of IL-1β. Interestingly, compound C significantly attenuated the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. This phenomenon was reproduced in AMPK siRNA-transfected THP-1 cells, indicating that compound C exerts this function despite AMPK knockdown. Also, it significantly suppresses the -generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) required for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In conclusion, compound C was shown to significantly attenuate the NLRP3 inflammasome despite AMPK knockdown, rendering it as the novel target of compound C. Potentially, compound C attenuates NLRP3 inflammasome through the suppression of mitochondrial ROS production. These findings offer initial evidence into compound C as a novel pharmacological agent with significant therapeutic potential in NLRP3 inflammasome-related disorders, including obesity, insulin resistance, and T2D.

High  (PA) concentration in follicular fluid is a crucial feature noted in obese women. This study examined how high PA concentration reduced mitochondrial quality in oocytes and investigated a possible countermeasure against mitochondrial dysfunction. Cumulus cell-oocyte complexes were obtained from the ovaries of gilts, and incubated in medium containing PA (0.5 mM) or vehicle (BSA) for 44 h. Culturing oocytes at high PA concentration induced mitochondrial dysfunction determined by high reactive oxygen species and low ATP content in oocytes. Furthermore, high PA levels increased mitochondrial acetylation levels determined by a high degree of co-localization of TOMM20 and acetylated-lysine. In addition, high PA levels reduced the expression of Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) and phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), while the AMPK activator, AICAR, restored mitochondrial function as well as oocyte ability and reduced the acetylation of mitochondrial protein. Supplementation of culture medium with dorsomorphin dihydrochloride (an AMPK inhibitor) reduced mitochondrial function and increased mitochondrial protein acetylation. Treatment of oocytes with LB100 (an inhibitor of AMPK dephosphorylation) reduced mitochondrial acetylation levels and restored mitochondrial function. Furthermore, high PA levels increased ceramide accumulation in oocytes, and addition of ceramide to the culture medium also induced mitochondrial dysfunction and increased mitochondrial acetylation. This detrimental effect of ceramide was diminished by AICAR treatment of oocytes. Our results indicated that PA induces ceramide accumulation and downregulates the AMPK/SIRT3 pathway causing mitochondrial protein hyperacetylation and dysfunction in oocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29631357>Loss of biliverdin reductase-A promotes lipid accumulation and lipotoxicity in mouse proximal tubule cells.</a></h2><p>Obesity and increased lipid availability have been implicated in the development and progression of chronic kidney disease. One of the major sites of renal lipid accumulation is in the proximal tubule cells of the kidney, suggesting that these cells may be susceptible to lipotoxicity. We previously demonstrated that loss of hepatic biliverdin reductase A (BVRA) causes fat accumulation in livers of mice on a high-fat diet. To determine the role of BVRA in mouse proximal tubule cells, we generated a CRISPR targeting BVRA for a knockout in mouse proximal tubule cells (BVRA KO). The BVRA KO cells had significantly less metabolic potential and mitochondrial respiration, which was exacerbated by treatment with , a saturated fatty . The BVRA KO cells also showed increased intracellular triglycerides which were associated with higher fatty  uptake gene cluster of differentiation 36 as well as increased de novo lipogenesis as measured by higher neutral lipids. Additionally, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin 1 expression, annexin-V FITC staining, and lactate dehydrogenase assays all demonstrated that BVRA KO cells are more sensitive to -induced lipotoxicity than wild-type cells. Phosphorylation of BAD which plays a role in cell survival pathways, was significantly reduced in -treated BVRA KO cells. These data demonstrate the protective role of BVRA in proximal tubule cells against saturated fatty -induced lipotoxicity and suggest that activating BVRA could provide a benefit in protecting from obesity-induced kidney injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26886198>ANT1-mediated fatty -induced uncoupling as a target for improving myocellular insulin sensitivity.</a></h2><p>Dissipating energy via mitochondrial uncoupling has been suggested to contribute to enhanced insulin sensitivity. We hypothesised that skeletal muscle  of endurance-trained athletes have increased sensitivity for fatty  (FA)-induced uncoupling, which is driven by the mitochondrial protein adenine nucleotide translocase 1 (ANT1).Capacity for FA-induced uncoupling was measured in endurance-trained male athletes (T) and sedentary young men (UT) in an observational study and also in isolated skeletal muscle  from Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats and C2C12 myotubes following small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated gene silencing of ANT1. Thus, fuelled by glutamate/succinate (fibres) or pyruvate ( and myotubes) and in the presence of oligomycin to block ATP synthesis, increasing levels of oleate (fibres) or palmitate ( and myotubes) were automatically titrated while respiration was monitored. Insulin sensitivity was measured by hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp in humans and via insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in myotubes.Skeletal muscle from the T group displayed increased sensitivity to FA-induced uncoupling (p = 0.011) compared with muscle from the UT group, and this was associated with elevated insulin sensitivity (p = 0.034). ANT1 expression was increased in T (p = 0.013).  from ZDF rats displayed decreased sensitivity for FA-induced uncoupling (p = 0.008).

Partial knockdown of ANT1 in C2C12 myotubes decreased sensitivity to the FA-induced uncoupling (p = 0.008) and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (p = 0.025) compared with controls.Increased sensitivity to FA-induced uncoupling is associated with enhanced insulin sensitivity and is affected by ANT1 activity in skeletal muscle.

The lipid accumulation-hepatocytes (induced by 0.5 mM sodium palmitate for 24 h) were treated with 5 μM berberine for 12 h. Then, the Cell viability, intracellular triglyceride (TG) content, lipid peroxide (LPO), malonaldehyde (MDA) content, cytochrome c, caspase-9, caspase-3 and apoptosis were detected. Sodium palmitate decreased Cell viability and increased intracellular TG content, lipid droplet accumulation, LPO and MDA concentrations, caused caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation, then led to apoptosis accompanied by cytochrome c release from  into the cytoplasm. Beberine could improve intracellular lipid droplet accumulation and oxidative stress, while reduce apoptosis induced by sodium palmitate.Copyright © 2019.

We characterized the ACSL isoforms in a cell line of homogeneous rat beta cells (INS-1 832/13 cells) and human pancreatic islets. ACSL4 and ACSL3 proteins were present in the beta cells and human and rat pancreatic islets and concentrated in insulin secretory granules and less in  and negligible in other intracellular organelles. ACSL1 and ACSL6 proteins were not seen in INS-1 832/13 cells or pancreatic islets. ACSL5 protein was seen only in INS-1 832/13 cells. With shRNA-mediated gene silencing we developed stable ACSL knockdown cell lines from INS-1 832/13 cells. Glucose-stimulated insulin release was inhibited ∼50% with ACSL4 and ACSL3 knockdown and unaffected in cell lines with knockdown of ACSL5, ACLS6 and ACSL1. Lentivirus shRNA-mediated gene silencing of ACSL4 and ACSL3 in human pancreatic islets inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin release. ACSL4 and ACSL3 knockdown cells showed inhibition of ACSL enzyme activity more with arachidonate than with palmitate as a substrate, consistent with their preference for unsaturated fatty acids as substrates. ACSL4 knockdown changed the patterns of fatty acids in phosphatidylserines and phosphatidylethanolamines. The results show the involvement of ACLS4 and ACLS3 in insulin secretion.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Silibinin, the main component of Silybum marianum fruit extract (silymarin), is reported to have anti-diabetic effect. This study is designed to determine the protective effect of silibinin on -induced damage in a rat pancreatic β-cell line, INS-1 cells. Our results demonstrate that silibinin improves cell viability, enhances insulin synthesis and secretion, and resumes normal mitochondrial function in -treated INS-1 cells. An accumulating body of evidence has shown that the estrogen receptors are key molecules involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. Our results suggest that silibinin upregulates ERα signaling pathway from the finding that ERα-specific inhibitors abolish the anti-lipotoxic effect of silibinin.

Here, we investigated the role of lysosomal dysfunction and impaired autophagic flux in the pathogenesis of lipotoxicity in the kidney. In mice, a high-fat diet (HFD) resulted in an accumulation of phospholipids in enlarged lysosomes within kidney proximal tubular cells (PTCs). In isolated PTCs treated with , autophagic degradation activity progressively stagnated in association with impaired lysosomal acidification and excessive lipid accumulation. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that the accumulated lipids originated from cellular membranes. In mice with induced PTC-specific ablation of autophagy, PTCs of HFD-mice exhibited greater accumulation of ubiquitin-positive protein aggregates normally removed by autophagy than did PTCs of mice fed a normal diet. Furthermore, HFD-mice had no capacity to augment autophagic activity upon another pathologic stress. Autophagy ablation also exaggerated HFD-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammasome activation. Moreover, renal ischemia-reperfusion induced greater injury in HFD-mice than in mice fed a normal diet, and ablation of autophagy further exacerbated this effect. Finally, we detected similarly enhanced phospholipid accumulation in enlarged lysosomes and impaired autophagic flux in the kidneys of obese patients compared with nonobese patients. These findings provide key insights regarding the pathophysiology of lipotoxicity in the kidney and clues to a novel treatment for obesity-related kidney diseases.Copyright © 2017 by the American Society of Nephrology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28877220>Attenuated lipotoxicity and apoptosis is linked to exogenous and endogenous augmenter of liver regeneration by different pathways.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) covers a spectrum from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis. Free fatty acids (FFA) induce steatosis and lipo-toxicity and correlate with severity of NAFLD. In this study we aimed to investigate the role of exogenous and endogenous ALR (augmenter of liver regeneration) for FFA induced ER (endoplasmatic reticulum) -stress and lipoapoptosis. Primary human hepatocytes or hepatoma cells either treated with recombinant human ALR (rhALR, 15kDa) or expressing short form ALR (sfALR, 15kDa) were incubated with  (PA) and analyzed for lipo-toxicity, -apoptosis, activation of ER-stress response pathways, triacylglycerides (TAG), mRNA and protein expression of lipid metabolizing genes. Both, exogenous rhALR and cytosolic sfALR reduced PA induced caspase 3 activity and Bax protein expression and therefore lipotoxicity. Endogenous sfALR but not rhALR treatment lowered TAG levels, diminished activation of ER-stress mediators C-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1) and proapoptotic transcription factor C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP), and reduced death receptor 5 protein expression. Cellular ALR exerts its lipid lowering and anti-apoptotic actions by enhancing FABP1, which binds toxic FFA, increasing mitochondrial β-oxidation by elevating the mitochondrial FFA transporter CPT1α, and decreasing ELOVL6, which delivers toxic FFA metabolites. We found reduced hepatic mRNA levels of ALR in a high fat diet mouse model, and of ALR and FOXA2, a transcription factor inducing ALR expression, in human steatotic as well as NASH liver samples, which may explain increased lipid deposition and reduced β-oxidation in NASH patients. Present study shows that exogenous and endogenous ALR reduce PA induced lipoapoptosis.

However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate cardiac insulin signaling are not fully understood. The regulatory role of tafazzin in the hearts of HF-diet-fed mice is investigated.Mice are fed a HF diet or low fat (LF) diet for up to 24 weeks. After 24 weeks, it is found that HF-diet-induced cardiac dysfunction is linked to overexpression of the mitochondrial protein tafazzin. Increased tafazzin promotes mitochondrial fission and impairs insulin signaling, which is mediated by dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp-1) translocation from the cytosol to the . Furthermore, knockdown of tafazzin with siRNA inhibits -induced mitochondrial fission and restores insulin sensitivity. Moreover, miR-125b-5p as an upstream regulator targeting tafazzin is identified and palmitate-induced insulin resistance further rescued.In HF-diet-fed mouse hearts, increased tafazzin contributes to insulin resistance via mediating Drp-1 translocation to the , and a small non-coding RNA, miR-125b-5p, at least partially regulates this signaling pathway and alleviates insulin resistance.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

It is still largely unknown how these mitochondrial respiratory chain defects affect cellular metabolisms and lead to variable clinical phenotypes. Here, we analyzed metabolic signatures in a cellular model of MELAS/ Leigh overlap syndrome using untargeted gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). .We obtained fibroblasts from a MELAS/Leigh overlap syndrome patient carrying the heteroplasmic m.10191T>C mutation, and generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from these fibroblast. Isogenic iPSC clones carrying two different loads of the heteroplasmic mutation (ND3hig-iPSC, ND3"*w- iPSC-) were subjected to metabolome analysis. Metabolite profiles, which were identified by GC-MS, were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA).We were able to identify about 40 metabolites in control fibroblasts and iPSCs. Upon comparative metabolome analysis between fibroblasts and iPSCs, lactic  and proline were distinct between the two groups. When we compared patient fibroblasts and control fibroblasts, no significant distinct metabolites were found. On the other hand, patient specific iPSC with high mutational load (ND3high_ iPSC) showed a distinct metabolite profile compared with ND3""-iPSC and control-iPSCs.

Although cellular stress response mechanisms are well defined in somatic cells, they remain largely unexplored in oocytes, which have distinct organelle structure and nuclear transcription patterns. Here we used shotgun proteomic analyses to study cellular responses of bovine oocytes and cumulus cells (CCs) after in vitro maturation under lipotoxic conditions; in the presence of pathophysiological  (PA) concentration as a model. Differentially regulated proteins (DRPs) were mainly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum,  and nuclei of CCs and oocytes, however the DRPs and their direction of change were cell-type specific. Proteomic changes in PA-exposed CCs were predominantly pro-apoptotic unfolded protein responses (UPRs), mitochondrial and metabolic dysfunctions, and apoptotic pathways. This was also functionally confirmed. Interestingly, although the oocytes were enclosed by CCs during PA exposure, elevated cellular stress levels were also evident. However, pro-survival UPRs, redox regulatory and compensatory metabolic mechanisms were prominent despite evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and reduced subsequent embryo development.

Myristic  (MA), a free fatty  highly abundant in copra/palmist oils, is a predictor of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and stimulates ceramide synthesis. Here we investigated the synergism between MA and PA in ceramide synthesis, ER stress, lipotoxicity and NASH. Unlike PA, MA is not lipotoxic but potentiated PA-mediated lipoapoptosis, ER stress, caspase-3 activation and cytochrome c release in primary mouse hepatocytes (PMH). Moreover, MA kinetically sustained PA-induced total ceramide content by stimulating dehydroceramide desaturase and switched the ceramide profile from decreased to increased ceramide 14:0/ceramide16:0, without changing medium and long-chain ceramide species. PMH were more sensitive to equimolar ceramide14:0/ceramide16:0 exposure, which mimics the outcome of PA plus MA treatment on ceramide homeostasis, than to either ceramide alone. Treatment with myriocin to inhibit ceramide synthesis and tauroursodeoxycholic  to prevent ER stress ameliorated PA plus MA induced apoptosis, similar to the protection afforded by the antioxidant BHA, the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-Fmk and JNK inhibition. Moreover, ruthenium red protected PMH against PA and MA-induced cell death. Recapitulating in vitro findings, mice fed a diet enriched in PA plus MA exhibited lipodystrophy, hepatosplenomegaly, increased liver ceramide content and cholesterol levels, ER stress, liver damage, inflammation and fibrosis compared to mice fed diets enriched in PA or MA alone. The deleterious effects of PA plus MA-enriched diet were largely prevented by in vivo myriocin treatment. These findings indicate a causal link between ceramide synthesis and ER stress in lipotoxicity, and imply that the consumption of diets enriched in MA and PA can cause NASH associated with lipodystrophy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30253137>Acclimation of CC myoblasts to physiological glucose concentrations for in vitro diabetes research.</a></h2><p>The interplay between hyper-glycemia and -lipidemia in diabetes mellitus (DM) is important in simulating diabetic conditions. However, cell culture media typically contain supraphysiological levels of glucose to stimulate cellular growth, which also desensitizes cells to elevated glucose levels. Moreover, creating hyperlipidemic conditions in vitro requires specialized carriers because unbound lipids form micelles when introduced to liquid media. This study sought to develop a novel method for simulating DM conditions in vitro.We acclimated the CC mouse myoblasts to culture medium with 5.6 mM glucose, which mimics physiological levels, and created a bovine serum albumin- conjugate for  transport to explore the effects of hyperlipidemia. We simulated diabetic conditions in vitro by using both hyper-glycemic and -lipidemic conditions and compared the results to that of only hyperglycemic or hyperlipidemic conditions.Acclimated cells exposed to these hyper-glycemic (15 mM glucose) and/or -lipidemic (0.25 mM palmitate) conditions for 2 h showed increased mitochondrial fragmentation and membrane potential as well as elevated reactive oxygen species production compared to control cells. These findings suggest altered mitochondrial morphology and function, which have been confirmed using isolated rat flexor digitorum brevis myofibers. Hyper-glycemic and/or -lipidemic stimulations for 24 h significantly increased mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase MEK 1/2 protein expression, upregulated the early pro-apoptotic transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), and induced apoptosis.Our results further support and confirm the utility of this method which will allow for subsequent investigations studying the effects of hyper-glycemia and/or -lipidemia in vitro.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Although stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) is expected to relieve  (PA)-induced lipotoxicity by regulating diacylglycerol and ceramide, its function is unclear in human trophoblast cells. The aim was to investigate inhibitory effects of SCD1 activity on PA-induced trophoblast cell death. PA induces cell death and inhibits the invasion of human trophoblast cells (HTR8/SVneo). In addition, we demonstrate that SCD1 has a protective role against PA in human trophoblast cells by regulating AKT-mediated signaling pathway and mitochondrial membrane potential. The knockdown of SCD1 enhances the proapoptotic activity of PA in HTR8/SVneo cells. Lastly, we investigated microRNA expression predicted to target SCD1 and diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) by PA.

In type 2 diabetes (T2DM), dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia damage DRG neurons and induce mitochondrial dysfunction; however, the impact of free fatty acids and glucose on mitochondrial trafficking in DRG neurons remains unknown. To evaluate the impact of free fatty acids compared to hyperglycemia on mitochondrial transport, primary adult mouse DRG neuron cultures were treated with physiologic concentrations of palmitate and glucose and assessed for alterations in mitochondrial trafficking, mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial bioenergetics. Palmitate treatment significantly reduced the number of motile  in DRG axons, but physiologic concentrations of glucose did not impair mitochondrial trafficking dynamics. Palmitate-treated DRG neurons also exhibited a reduction in mitochondrial velocity, and impaired mitochondrial trafficking correlated with mitochondrial depolarization in palmitate-treated DRG neurons.

We present evidence that MEND depends on mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) openings, followed by coenzyme A (CoA) release, acyl CoA synthesis, and membrane protein palmitoylation. MEND is blocked by inhibiting mitochondrial Ca uptake or PTP openings, depleting fatty acids, blocking acyl CoA synthesis, metabolizing CoA, or inhibiting palmitoylation. It is triggered by depolarizing  or promoting PTP openings. After mitochondrial MEND blockade, MEND is restored by cytoplasmic acyl CoA or CoA. MEND is blocked by siRNA knockdown of the plasmalemmal acyl transferase, DHHC5. When acyl CoA is abundant, transient H2O2 oxidative stress or PKC activation initiates MEND, but the immediate presence of H2O2 prevents MEND. The PTP inhibitor, NIM811, significantly increases plasmalemma in normally growing cells. Thus, the MEND pathway may contribute to constitutive as well as pathological plasmalemma turnover in dependence on mitochondrial stress signaling.

The crosstalk between myotubes and adipocytes was evaluated using Transwell assay. The cellular lipid content was examined by Nile red staining. The mitochondrial content was assessed by MitoTracker Green staining and citrate synthase activity, and the mitochondrial function was examined by Seahorse assay. Expression of mitochondria-related and insulin signalling pathway proteins was analysed by Western blot, and the irisin level was determined by elisa kit.Myricanol increased mitochondrial quantity and function through activating AMP-activated protein kinase, resulting in reduced lipid accumulation and enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, in PA-treated C2C12 myotubes. Furthermore, myricanol stimulated irisin production and secretion from myotubes to reduce lipid content in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

However, the role of autophagy of myeloid cells in adipose tissue inflammation and type 2 diabetes has not been addressed. We produced mice with myeloid cell-specific deletion of Atg7 (autophagy-related 7), an essential autophagy gene (Atg7 conditional knockout [cKO] mice). While Atg7 cKO mice were metabolically indistinguishable from control mice, they developed diabetes when bred to ob/w mice (Atg7 cKO-ob/ob mice), accompanied by increases in the crown-like structure, inflammatory cytokine expression and inflammasome activation in adipose tissue.

Moreover, a decrease in the NAD(+):NADH ratio and increase in intracellular ROS content after treatment with  in combination with lipopolysaccharide were more pronounced in Mφs from Atg7 cKO mice, suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction in autophagy-deficient Mφs leads to an increase in lipid-induced inflammasome and metabolic deterioration in Atg7 cKO-ob/ob mice.

These results suggest that autophagy of Mφs is important for the control of inflammasome activation in response to metabolic or extrinsic stress, and autophagy deficiency in Mφs may contribute to the progression of metabolic syndrome associated with lipid injury and colitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31139863>Skeletal muscle miR-34a/SIRT1:AMPK axis is activated in experimental and human non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis associates with intramyocellular lipid deposition and mitochondrial dysfunction. microRNAs (miRs), including pro-apoptotic miR-34a, are modulated during disease progression in liver tissue and plasma. We aimed to investigate the functional role of the miR-34a/SIRT1:AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway in modulating local mitochondrial dysfunction in the skeletal muscle of human and experimental non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Muscle biopsies were obtained from morbid obese NAFLD patients undergoing bariatric surgery. C57BL/6N mice were fed different NAFLD-inducing diets and C2C12 muscle cells incubated with  (PA) in the presence or absence of an AMPK activator, or upon miR-34a functional modulation. Several muscle miRNAs, including miR-34a, were found increased with human NAFLD progression. Activation of the miR-34a/SIRT1:AMPK pathway, concomitant with impairment in insulin signalling mediators and deregulation of mitochondrial-shaping proteins, was evident in C2C12 cells incubated with PA, as well as in the skeletal muscle of all three diet-induced NAFLD mice models. Functional studies established the association between miR-34a- and PA-induced muscle cell deregulation. Of note, activation of AMPK almost completely prevented miR-34a- and PA-induced cellular stress. In addition, the miR-34a/SIRT1:AMPK pathway and mitochondrial dynamics dysfunction were also found amplified in muscle of human NAFLD. Finally, muscle miR-34a expression and mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) protein levels correlated with hallmarks of NAFLD and disease progression. Our results indicate that activation of the miR-34a/SIRT1:AMPK pathway leads to mitochondrial dynamics dysfunction in skeletal muscle of human and experimental NAFLD, representing an appealing prospective target in metabolic syndrome. KEY MESSAGES: Skeletal muscle microRNAs are modulated during NAFLD progression. -induced muscle cell dysfunction occurs, at least in part, through activation of the miR-34a/SIRT1:AMPK pathway. miR-34a/SIRT1:AMPK activation associates with  dynamics dysfunction in human NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25782302>[Hypoglycemic activity of hypolipidemic preparations].</a></h2><p>The system of glucose metabolism regulation is millions of years older than the insilin system and locomotor function. For this reason, the hypoglycemic activity of the hormone is mediated through fatty  (FA) metabolism. Insulin blocks the ability of  to oxidize ketone bodies, short-, medium- and long-chain FA and makes them oxidize glucose, i.e. a physiologically unoptimal substrate. The relationship between FA and glucose in the Rnadle cycle is apparent only on the autocrine level (in the cell); they determine alternation of nutritive function (trophology) and biological exo/endo-reactions (after and without feeding respectively). Most antidiabetic medicines exhibit hypoglycemic activity, like insulin; they reduce the level of lipid substrates of oxidation in cytosol and  have to oxidize glucose. In these conditions, insulin increases glucose uptake by the cells mediated through GLUT4 transporters. Sulfonylurea derivatives enhance secretion of insulin by beta-cell. Biguanides covalently and irreversibly bind ketone bodies thereby preventing their oxidation by . Fibrates, glitazones, flavonides, flavones, lipoic thio-FA, endogenous eicosanoids, derivatives of Ω-3 and Ω-6 essential polyenic FA, and conjugated unsaturated FA are agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. They stimulate α-, β-, and Ω-oxidation of all exogenous a physiological FA and excessive  saturated FA in peroxisomes which leads to cytosol hypolipidemia. Hypoglycemic preparations with the activity of oxidation beta-blockers arrest FA uptake by . Hypoglycemic Ω-3 essential polyenoic FA activate GLUT4 function. Type 2 diabetes in middle-aged patients is a symptom of atherosclerosis, i.e. deficit of essential polyenoic FA caused by disturbed phospholipid synthesis and GLUT4 function. Diabetes should be in the first place considered as pathological FA metabolism and only in the second place as glucose pathology. This inference needs to be taken into account in the treatment of diabetes and in strategic programs of its prophylaxis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31514051>Carbon monoxide releasing molecule-A1 improves nonalcoholic steatohepatitis via Nrf2 activation mediated improvement in oxidative stress and mitochondrial function.</a></h2><p>Nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2)-mediated signaling plays a central role in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis of hepatic cells. Carbon monoxide releasing molecule-A1 (CORM-A1) has been reported to stimulate up-regulation and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in hepatocytes. However, the role of CORM-A1 in improving lipid metabolism, antioxidant signaling and mitochondrial functions in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is unknown. In this study, we report that CORM-A1 prevents hepatic steatosis in high fat high fructose (HFHF) diet fed C57BL/6J mice, used as model of NASH. The beneficial effects of CORM-A1 in HFHF fed mice was associated with improved lipid homeostasis, Nrf2 activation, upregulation of antioxidant responsive (ARE) genes and increased ATP production. As,  are intracellular source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and important sites of lipid metabolism, we further investigated the mechanisms of action of CORM-A1-mediated improvement in mitochondrial function in  (PA) treated HepG2 cells. Cellular oxidative stress and cell viability were found to be improved in PA + CORM-A1 treated cells via Nrf2 translocation and activation of cytoprotective genes. Furthermore, in PA treated cells, CORM-A1 improved mitochondrial oxidative stress, membrane potential and rescued mitochondrial biogenesis thru upregulation of Drp1, TFAM, PGC-1α and NRF-1 genes. CORM-A1 treatment improved cellular status by lowering glycolytic respiration and maximizing OCR. Improvement in mitochondrial respiration and increment in ATP production in PA + CORM-A1 treated cells further corroborate our findings. In summary, our data demonstrate for the first time that CORM-A1 ameliorates tissue damage in steatotic liver via Nrf2 activation and improved mitochondrial function, thus, suggesting the anti-NASH potential of CORM-A1.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In the present study, the parental and IDH1 (R132H/+) mutant HCT116 cells were treated with various concentrations of oleic  (OA) or  (PA) in the presence or absence of glucose. The results demonstrated that mutation of IDH1 exacerbated the effects of OA and PA on cell viability and apoptosis, and consistently elevated the production of reactive oxygen species in HCT116 cells, particularly in the absence of glucose. Furthermore, mutation of IDH1 inhibited the rate of fatty  oxidation (FAO), but elevated the glucose consumption in HCT116 cells. The results of immunoblotting and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) indicated that the expression of glucose transporter 1 was upregulated, whereas that of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 was downregulated in IDH1 mutant HCT116 cells. Although mitochondrial DNA quantification demonstrated that mutation of IDH1 had no effect on the quantity of , immunoblotting and RT‑qPCR revealed that mutation of IDH1 in HCT116 cells significantly downregulated the expression of cytochrome c (CYCS) and CYCS oxidase IV, two important components in mitochondrial respiratory chain. These results indicated that mutation of IDH1 aggravated the fatty ‑induced oxidative stress in HCT116 cells, by suppressing FAO and disrupting the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The results of the present study may provide novel insight into therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cancer types with IDH mutation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29752433>, but not high-glucose, induced myocardial apoptosis is alleviated by N‑acetylcysteine due to attenuated mitochondrial-derived ROS accumulation-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress.</a></h2><p>Pharmacological inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a potential strategy to prevent diabetes-induced cardiac dysfunction. This study was designed to investigate precise effects of antioxidant N‑acetylcysteine (NAC) in alleviating diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). Echocardiography and histologic studies were performed 12 weeks after streptozocin injection. Protein levels involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and apoptosis were analyzed by western blotting in diabetic hearts or high-glucose (HG, 30 mM)- and  (PA, 300 μM)-cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs). ROS generation and structural alterations of  were also assessed. We report that NAC alleviated diabetes-induced cardiac abnormality, including restored ejection fraction (EF %), fraction shortening (FS %), peak E to peak A ratio (E/A) and reduced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. These effects were concomitant with blocked ERS and apoptosis, as evidenced by inactivation of phosphorylated inositol-requiring enzyme-1α (IRE1α)/spliced X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), phosphorylated protein kinase-like kinase (PERK)/phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78)/activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6α)/C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) pathways, as well as suppressed Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX)/B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and cleaved caspase 3 expressions. Mechanistically, PA mediated excessive mitochondrial ROS generation and oxidative stress, which were antagonized by NAC and Mito-TEMPO, a mitochondrial ROS inhibitor. No effects were noted by addition of apocynin, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase inhibitor, and NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX 4) and NOX 2 expressions were not altered, indicating that PA-induced ROS generation is independent of NADPH oxidases. Most intriguingly, HG failed to promote ROS production despite its ability to promote ERS and apoptosis in NRCMs. Collectively, these findings indicate that NAC primarily abrogates PA-mediated mitochondrial ROS through ERS and therefore alleviates myocardial apoptosis but has little effect on HG-induced cardiac injury. This uncovers a potential role for NAC in formulating novel cardioprotective strategies in DCM patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27651333>Hepatic FTO expression is increased in NASH and its silencing attenuates -induced lipotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is one of the most common causes of liver failure worldwide. It is characterized by excess fat accumulation, inflammation, and increased lipotoxicity in hepatocytes. Currently, there are limited treatment options for NASH due to lack of understanding of its molecular etiology. In the present study, we demonstrate that the expression of fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) is significantly increased in the livers of NASH patients and in a rodent model of NASH. Furthermore, using human hepatic cells, we show that genetic silencing of FTO protects against palmitate-induced oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, ER stress, and apoptosis in vitro. Taken together, our results show that FTO may have a deleterious role in hepatic cells during lipotoxic conditions, and strongly suggest that up-regulation of FTO may contribute to the increased liver damage in NASH.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We here chose FATP4 as a representative model enzyme for acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSs), and FATPs to determine whether Pal activation would lead to apoptosis and alteration in lipid metabolism. By using FATP4 overexpressed (FATP4) Huh-7 cells, we showed that FATP4 was localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and  of FATP4 cells. FATP4 cells were more responsive to Pal than the control GFP cells in increasing palmitoyl-CoA and oleoyl-CoA activities as well as apoptosis by ~2-3 folds. The lipoapoptosis susceptibility by FATP4 was coupled with the increased JNK, PUMA, caspase3, PARP-1 activation as well as Rac-1-mediated cytoskeletal reorganization, and decreased insulin sensitivity. This was associated with increased contents of neutral lipids and significant alteration in composition of phospholipids and sphingolipids including increased lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), ceramide, and hexosylceramide, as well as an increase of saturated:polyunsaturated fatty  ratio in LPC and PC, but a decrease of this ratio in phosphatidylethanolamine pool. By use of ceramide synthase inhibitors, our results showed that FATP4-sensitized lipoapoptosis was not mediated by ceramides. Moreover, FATP4 expression was increased in fatty livers in vivo. Thus, our model system has provided a clue that Pal activation FATP4 triggers hepatocellular apoptosis via altered phospholipid composition and steatosis by acylation into complex lipids. This may be a redundant mechanism for other ER-localizing ACSs and FATPs in the liver, and hence their involvement in the development of fatty liver disease.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of novel Nox inhibitors as protective agents against cytokine- or high glucose + palmitate-induced human beta-cell death. The Nox2 protein was present mainly in the cytoplasm and was induced by cytokines. Nox4 protein immunoreactivity, with some nuclear accumulation, was observed in human islet cells, and was not affected by islet culture in the presence of cytokines or high glucose + palmitate. Nox inhibitors with partial or no isoform selectivity (DPI, dapsone, GLX351322, and GLX481372) all reduced ROS production of human islet cells exposed to high glucose + palmitate. This was paralleled by improved viability and reduced caspase 3 activation. The Nox1 selective inhibitor ML171 failed to reduce human islet cell death in response to both cytokines and high glucose + palmitate. The selective Nox2 inhibitor Phox-I2 also failed to protect against cytokines, but protected partially against high glucose + palmitate-induced cellular death. The highly selective Nox4 inhibitor GLX7013114 protected islet cells against both cytokines and high glucose + palmitate. However, as no osmotic control for high glucose was used, we cannot exclude the possibility that the high glucose effect was due to osmosis. It is concluded that Nox4 may participate in stress-induced islet cell death in human islets in vitro. We propose that Nox4 mediates pro-apoptotic effects in intact islets under stressful conditions and that selective Nox4-inhibition may be a therapeutic strategy in type 2 diabetes.</p></html>
