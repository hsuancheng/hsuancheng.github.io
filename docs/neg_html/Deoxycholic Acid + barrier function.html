There is no treatment available for these diseases. The bile acids tauroursodeoxycholic (TUDCA) and ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) have been recently shown to be neuroprotective in other protein misfolding disease models, including Parkinson’s, Huntington’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, and also in humans with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Here, we studied the therapeutic efficacy of these compounds in prion disease. We demonstrated that TUDCA and UDCA substantially reduced PrP conversion in cell-free aggregation assays, as well as in chronically and acutely infected cell cultures. This effect was mediated through reduction of PrPSc seeding ability, rather than an effect on PrPC. We also demonstrated the ability of TUDCA and UDCA to reduce neuronal loss in prion-infected cerebellar slice cultures. UDCA treatment reduced astrocytosis and prolonged survival in RML prion-infected mice. Interestingly, these effects were limited to the males, implying a gender-specific difference in drug metabolism. Beyond effects on PrPSc, we found that levels of phosphorylated eIF2 were increased at early time points, with correlated reductions in postsynaptic density protein 95. As demonstrated for other neurodegenerative diseases, we now show that TUDCA and UDCA may have a therapeutic role in prion diseases, with effects on both prion conversion and neuroprotection. Our findings, together with the fact that these natural compounds are orally bioavailable, permeable to the blood-brain , and U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved for use in humans, make these compounds promising alternatives for the treatment of prion diseases.Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative diseases that are transmissible to humans and other mammals. There are no disease-modifying therapies available, despite decades of research. Treatment targets have included inhibition of protein accumulation,clearance of toxic aggregates, and prevention of downstream neurodegeneration. No one target may be sufficient; rather, compounds which have a multimodal mechanism, acting on different targets, would be ideal. TUDCA and UDCA are bile acids that may fulfill this dual role. Previous studies have demonstrated their neuroprotective effects in several neurodegenerative disease models, and we now demonstrate that this effect occurs in prion disease, with an added mechanistic target of upstream prion seeding. Importantly, these are natural compounds which are orally bioavailable, permeable to the blood-brain , and U.S.Food and Drug Administration-approved for use in humans with primary biliary cirrhosis. They have recently been proven efficacious in human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Therefore, these compounds are promising options for the treatment of prion diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27423261>Retention data of bile acids and their oxo derivatives in characterization of pharmacokinetic properties and in silico ADME modeling.</a></h2><p>Information on ADME properties of examined bile acids and their oxo derivatives are scarce, although the interest for bile acids and their use in nanochemistry and macromolecular chemistry is increasing. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the lipophilicity, a crucial physicochemical parameter for describing ADME properties of selected bile acids and their oxo derivatives, and to compare two approaches: experimentally determined hydrophobicity parameters and calculated logP values.Commercially available bile acids - , chenodeoxycholic, hyodeoxycholic and ursodeoxycholic  were used to synthesize oxo derivatives. Lipophilicity was evaluated in two solvent systems: toluene/ethanol and toluene/butanol. Retention parameters were acquired by normal-phase TLC. The correlations between calculated logP values obtained using five different software and experimentally determined hydrophobicity parameters (RM(0)(tol/eth), RM(0)(tol/but), b(tol/eth) and b(tol/but)) were examined.Correlation analysis confirmed significant dependence between experimental RM(0) values and software calculated parameters. Results suggest satisfactory intestinal absorption after oral administration for all of the examined compounds as well as low volumes of distribution, and high affinity for binding with plasma proteins. Penetration through blood-brain  and skin is not satisfactory. All of the examined compounds show high affinity for binding with G-protein coupled receptors and consequently inhibition of ionic channels. Results also suggest possible binding with nuclear receptors.Established lipophilicity testing model of studied compounds showed excellent predictive ability and might represent significant tool in development of relations between chromatographic behavior and ADME properties. Compounds 3α-hydroxy-7,12-dioxo-5β-cholanoic and 12α-hydroxy-3,7-dioxo-5β-cholanoic  might be the most suitable candidates for further development studies (satisfactory pharmacokinetic properties and lowest haemolytic potential) followed by 3α-hydroxy-12-oxo-5β-cholanoic  and 3α-hydroxy-7-oxo-5β-cholanoic  (slightly higher haemolytic potential, but better ligand properties).Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we investigated the contribution of specific components of the gastric refluxate on adhesion molecules involved in epithelial  maintenance. Cell line models of squamous epithelium (HET-1A) and BO (QH) were used to examine the effects of bile acids on cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins (Collagen, laminin, vitronectin, fibronectin) and expression of integrin ligands (α , α α , α and α ). Experimental findings were validated in human explant oesophageal biopsies, a rat model of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD) and in patient tissue microarrays. The bile   (DCA) specifically reduced adhesion of HET-1A cells to vitronectin and reduced cell-surface expression of integrin-α via effects on endocytic recycling processes. Increased expression of integrin-α was observed in ulcerated tissue in a rat model of GORD and in oesophagitis and Barrett's intestinal metaplasia patient tissue compared to normal squamous epithelium. Increased expression of integrin-α was observed in QH BO cells compared to HET-1A cells. QH cells were resistant to DCA-mediated loss of adhesion and reduction in cell-surface expression of integrin-α . We demonstrated that a specific component of the gastric refluxate, DCA, affects the epithelial  through modulation of integrin α expression, providing a novel mechanism for bile -mediated erosion of oesophageal squamous epithelium and promotion of BO. Strategies aimed at preventing bile -mediated erosion should be considered in the clinical management of patients with GORD.© 2017 The Authors.

Dietary habits are one of the main causative factors for metabolic syndrome, CVD and type 2 diabetes. The human gut microbiota is emerging as an important player in the interaction between diet and metabolic health. Gut microbial communities contribute to human metabolism through fermentation of dietary fibre and the result of intestinal saccharolytic fermentation is production of SCFA. Acetate, propionate and butyrate positively influence satiety, endocrine system, glucose homeostasis, adipogenesis, lipid oxidation, thermoregulation, hepatic gluconeogenesis, endothelial  and gut  integrity, and these mechanisms have all been linked to protection from type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular health. The gut microbiota is also involved in bile  metabolism and regulating their cell signalling potential, which has also been shown to modify pathways involved in metabolic health. Similarly, the gut microbiota renders recalcitrant plant polyphenols into biologically active small phenolic compounds which then act systemically to reduce metabolic disease risk. This review summarises how dietary patterns, specific foods and a healthy lifestyle may modulate metabolic health through the gut microbiota and their molecular cross-talk with the host.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29133896>The food-borne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni responds to the bile salt deoxycholate with countermeasures to reactive oxygen species.</a></h2><p>Bile plays an important role in digestion, absorption of fats, and the excretion of waste products, while concurrently providing a critical barrier against  by harmful bacteria. Previous studies have demonstrated that gut pathogens react to bile by adapting their protein synthesis. The ability of pathogens to respond to bile is remarkably complex and still incompletely understood. Here we show that Campylobacter jejuni, a leading bacterial cause of human diarrheal illness worldwide, responds to deoxycholate, a component of bile, by altering global gene transcription in a manner consistent with a strategy to mitigate exposure to reactive oxygen stress. More specifically, continuous growth of C. jejuni in deoxycholate was found to: 1) induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS); 2) decrease succinate dehydrogenase activity (complex II of the electron transport chain); 3) increase catalase activity that is involved in HO breakdown; and 4) result in DNA strand breaks. Congruently, the addition of 4-hydroxy-TEMPO (TEMPOL), a superoxide dismutase mimic that reacts with superoxide, rescued the growth of C. jejuni cultured in the presence of deoxycholate. We postulate that continuous exposure of a number of enteric pathogens to deoxycholate stimulates a conserved survival response to this stressor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31255699>Zebrafish (Danio rerio) Oat1 and Oat3 transporters and their interaction with physiological compounds.</a></h2><p>Organic anion transporters (OATs) are membrane proteins within the Solute carrier family 22 (SLC22). They play important roles in cellular uptake of various organic compounds, and due to their expression in  tissues of major excretory and non-excretory organs are considered as crucial elements in absorption and distribution of a wide range of endobiotic and xenobiotic compounds. Based on our previous work and initial insights on SLC22 members in zebrafish (Danio rerio), in this study we aimed at in vitro characterization of Oat1 and Oat3 transporters and understanding of their interaction with potential physiological substrates. We first performed synteny analysis to describe in more detail orthological relationship of zebrafish oat1 and oat3 genes. We then developed stable cell lines overexpressing Oat1 and Oat3, and identified Lucifer yellow as Oat1 model fluorescent substrate (Km = 11.4 μM) and 6-carboxyfluorescein as Oat3 model substrate (Km = 5.8 μM). Initial identification performed using the developed assays revealed Kreb's cycle intermediates, bilirubin, bile salts and steroid hormones as the most potent of Oat1 and Oat3 interactors, with IC50 values in micromolar range. Finally, we showed that bilirubin, , α-ketoglutarate, pregnenolone, estrone-3-sulfate and corticosterone are in vitro substrates of zebrafish Oat1, and bilirubin and  are Oat3 substrates. In conclusion, using the approach described, structural and functional similarities of both transporters to human and mammalian orthologs are revealed, their broad ligand selectivity confirmed, potent interactors among endobiotic compounds identified, and first indications of their potential physiological role(s) in zebrafish obtained.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the role of CDCA in regulating intestinal   remains largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effects of CDCA on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-impaired intestinal epithelial   and explore the underlying mechanisms. In IPEC-J2 cells, CDCA reversed the LPS-induced increase in transepithelial electrical resistance and decrease in tight junction protein expression. In addition, we found that farnesoid X receptor (FXR) but not Takeda G-protein receptor 5 was responsible for the CDCA-improved epithelial   impaired by LPS. Furthermore, CDCA blocked LPS-induced activation of the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) pathway in a FXR-dependent manner and elicited similar effects to MLCK inhibition. In mice, CDCA supplementation restored LPS-induced elevation of intestinal permeability and MLCK expression and reduction of tight junction protein expression, thus alleviating LPS-induced intestinal  impairment. In conclusion, CDCA protected against the LPS-induced impairment of the intestinal epithelial   via the FXR-MLCK pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26453790>Enhanced antioxidation via encapsulation of isooctyl p-methoxycinnamate with sodium deoxycholate-mediated liposome endocytosis.</a></h2><p>Isooctyl p-methoxycinnamate(OMC) is a commonly used chemical ultraviolet B sunscreen that suffers rapid degradation with current delivery systems following sun exposure. In this study, deoxycholate-mediated liposome (DOC-LS) endocytosis was employed to improve the antioxidation effects of OMC following topical administration, and the in vitro cell uptake was investigated to understand the enhanced cutaneous absorption of the drug via this nanocarrier. Following topical application, structural changes in the stratum corneum were identified. With the increase of DOC content, the drug deposition in skin decreased; from this, a DOC-LS formulation was selected that showed significantly more drug delivery in skin than did the other preparations (P<0.05). DOC-LS decreased skin resistance, suggesting its ability to induce skin  disruption. In vitro HaCaT keratinocyte cell uptake of coumarin-6 incorporated in the two types of phosphatidylcholine (PC) vesicles (i.e., LS or DOC-LS) yielded similar fluorescence intensities following incubation for different periods (P<0.05). However, CCC-ESF-1 embryonic fibroblast cell uptake of the fluorescence revealed time-dependence, and the emitted light from DOC-LS incubated cells was stronger than that from cells incubated with LS (P<0.05). These findings might be associated with the endocytic pathway of HaCaT, which mainly exhibited adsorption or physical adhesion of the fluorescent vesicles, whereas CCC-ESF-1 markedly internalized the PC vesicles via the lysosomes, as shown by intracellular fluorescence co-location studies. Following loading with the same amount of OMC, the DOC-LS vesicles exhibited superior skin tissue antioxidative capacity among the preparations tested, corroborating the in vivo skin drug deposition results. Thus, our results suggest that DOC-LS is a promising system for OMC dermal delivery without promoting skin irritation, which is quite advantageous for therapeutic purposes.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Farnesoid X-activated receptor (FXR) is a key transcription regulator in hepatic and intestinal bile metabolism. We studied potential intestinal FXR dysfunction in a rat model of cholestatic liver injury and evaluated effects of obeticholic  (INT-747), an FXR agonist, on gut permeability, inflammation, and BTL. Rats were gavaged with INT-747 or vehicle during 10 days after bile-duct ligation and then were assessed for changes in gut permeability, BTL, and tight-junction protein expression, immune cell recruitment, and cytokine expression in ileum, mesenteric lymph nodes, and spleen. Auxiliary in vitro BTL-mimicking experiments were performed with Transwell supports. Vehicle-treated bile duct-ligated rats exhibited decreased FXR pathway expression in both jejunum and ileum, in association with increased gut permeability through increased claudin-2 expression and related to local and systemic recruitment of natural killer cells resulting in increased interferon-γ expression and BTL. After INT-747 treatment, natural killer cells and interferon-γ expression markedly decreased, in association with normalized permeability selectively in ileum (up-regulated claudin-1 and occludin) and a significant reduction in BTL. In vitro, interferon-γ induced increased Escherichia coli translocation, which remained unaffected by INT-747. In experimental cholestasis, FXR agonism improved ileal   by attenuating intestinal inflammation, leading to reduced BTL and thus demonstrating a crucial protective role for FXR in the gut-liver axis.Copyright © 2015 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

Bile acids are produced in the liver from cholesterol and metabolized in the intestine by the gut microbiota. Gut dysbiosis has been reported to be associated with colorectal cancer. However, the interplay between bile  metabolism and the gut microbiota during intestinal carcinogenesis remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the potential roles of bile acids and the gut microbiota in the cholic  (CA; a primary bile )-induced intestinal adenoma-adenocarcinoma sequence. Apc  mice, which spontaneously develop intestinal adenomas, were fed a diet supplemented with 0.4% CA for 12 weeks. Mice that were fed a normal diet were regarded as untreated controls. In CA-treated Apc  mice, the composition of the gut microbiota was significantly altered, and CA was efficiently transformed into  (a secondary bile ) by the bacterial 7α-dehydroxylation reaction. The intestinal adenoma-adenocarcinoma sequence was observed in CA-treated Apc  mice and was accompanied by an impaired intestinal   and IL-6/STAT3-related low-grade inflammation. More importantly, microbiota depletion using an antibiotic cocktail globally compromised CA-induced intestinal carcinogenesis, suggesting a leading role for the microbiota during this process. Overall, our data suggested that the crosstalk between bile acids and the gut microbiota mediated intestinal carcinogenesis, which might provide novel therapeutic strategies against intestinal tumor development.© 2019 The Authors.

UDCA reportedly counteracts the effects of endotoxemia. Previously, we demonstrated attenuated hepatic fibrogenesis and suppression of activated hepatic stellate cells (Ac-HSC) with an angiotensin-II (AT-II) type 1 receptor blocker (ARB). Here we evaluated the simultaneous effect of both agents on hepatic fibrogenesis in a rat model of NASH.Fischer 344 rats were fed a choline-deficient L-amino--defined (CDAA) diet for 8 weeks. The therapeutic effect of UDCA and ARB was evaluated along with hepatic fibrogenesis, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) regulatory cascade, and intestinal  . The direct inhibitory effect of both UDCA and ARB on Ac-HSC was assessed in vitro.Both UDCA and ARB had a potent inhibitory effect on hepatic fibrogenesis with suppression of the HSC activation and hepatic expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and TLR4. UDCA decreased intestinal permeability by ameliorating zonula occuludens-1 (ZO-1) disruption induced by the CDAA diet. ARB was found to directly suppress regulation of Ac-HSC.UDCA and ARB have a synergistic repressive effect on hepatic fibrogenesis by counteracting endotoxemia induced by intestinal  dysfunction and suppressing the activation of Ac-HSC. Because both agents are currently used in clinical practice, combined UDCA and ARB may represent a promising novel therapeutic approach for NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28554966>The Yin and Yang of bile  action on tight junctions in a model colonic epithelium.</a></h2><p>Gastrointestinal epithelial  loss due to tight junction (TJ) dysfunction and bile -induced diarrhea are common in patients with inflammatory diseases. Although excess colonic bile acids are known to alter mucosal permeability, few studies have compared the effects of specific bile acids on TJ . We report that the primary bile , chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), and its 7-dehydroxylated derivative, lithocholic  (LCA) have opposite effects on epithelial integrity in human colonic T84 cells. CDCA decreased transepithelial  resistance (pore) and increased paracellular 10 kDa dextran permeability (leak), effects that were enhanced by proinflammatory cytokines (PiC [ng/mL]: TNF[10] + IL-1[10] + IFN[30]). CDCA reversed the cation selectivity of the monolayer and decreased intercellular adhesion. In contrast, LCA alone did not alter any of these parameters, but attenuated the effects of CDCA ± PiC on paracellular permeability. CDCA, but not PiC, decreased occludin and not claudin-2 protein expression; CDCA also decreased occludin localization. LCA ± CDCA had no effects on occludin or claudin expression/localization. While PiC and CDCA increased IL-8 production, LCA reduced both basal and PiC ± CDCA-induced IL-8 production. TNF+ IL1ß increased IFN, which was enhanced by CDCA and attenuated by LCA CDCA±PiC increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that was attenuated by LCA Finally, scavenging ROS attenuated CDCA's leak, but not pore actions, and LCA enhanced this effect. Thus, in T84 cells, CDCA plays a role in the inflammatory response causing  dysfunction, while LCA restores  integrity. Understanding the interplay of LCA, CDCA, and PiC could lead to innovative therapeutic strategies for inflammatory and diarrheal diseases.© 2017 The Authors.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress may be involved in this process. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), a known ameliorator of ER stress, on pericyte loss in DR of streptozotocin- (STZ-) induced diabetic mice. To assess the extent of DR, the integrity of retinal vessels and density of retinal capillaries in STZ-induced diabetic mice were evaluated. Additionally, induction of ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) were assessed in diabetic mice and human retinal pericytes exposed to advanced glycation end products (AGE) or modified low-density lipoprotein (mLDL). Fluorescein dye leakage during angiography and retinal capillary density were improved in UDCA-treated diabetic mice, compared to the nontreated diabetic group. Among the UPR markers, those involved in the protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK) pathway were increased, while UDCA attenuated UPR in STZ-induced diabetic mice as well as AGE- or mLDL-exposed retinal pericytes in culture. Consequently, vascular integrity was improved and pericyte loss reduced in the retina of STZ-induced diabetic mice.

However, the crosstalk among nutrition, microbiota, and bile acids remains unclear. Our study indicated that undernutrition in weaning piglets led to intestinal atrophy, increased colonic production, and systemic accumulation of lithocholic  (LCA),  (DCA), or their conjugated forms, which might be associated with decreased Lactobacillus abundance. Moreover, undernutrition led to increased portal fibroblast growth factor 19 ( FGF19) level, upregulated hepatic heterodimer partner ( SHP), and downregulated cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase ( CYP7A1) expression. The detrimental effects of DCA and LCA on proliferation and   were confirmed in porcine enterocytes, whereas their roles in weaning piglets warrant further research. In summary, undernutrition in weaning piglets led to increased secondary bile acids production, which might be related to altered gut microbiome and enhanced farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling while CYP7A1 expression was suppressed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30634696>Calcium Pyruvate Exerts Beneficial Effects in an Experimental Model of Irritable Bowel Disease Induced by DCA in Rats.</a></h2><p>Pyruvate is a normal constituent of the body that participates in carbohydrate metabolism and functions as a scavenger of free radicals. Calcium pyruvate monohydrate (CPM) is a more stable derivative that has proved its anti-inflammatory effect in experimental colitis, among other disorders, and that could also be considered a source of calcium. Thus, it would be useful for the treatment of diseases with an inflammatory component and a high prevalence of osteoporosis like the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effects of CPM in a rat model of chronic post-inflammatory visceral pain induced by  (DCA) that resembles IBS. Rats were administered DCA for three days intracolonically and then treated daily with CPM (40 and 100 mg/kg) or gabapentin (70 mg/kg) (positive control) by oral gavage for 17 days. The treatments reduced the visceral hypersensitivity measured by response to colorectal distension and referred pain. DCA induced changes in the colonic immune response characterized by increased expression of the cytokine  and the inducible enzyme , which was reduced by the treatments. DCA also decreased the gut expression of the mucins  and , which was normalized by CPM, whereas gabapentin only increased significantly . Moreover, DCA increased the expression of , which was decreased to basal levels by all the treatments. However, the serotonin receptor , which was also elevated, was not affected by any of the treatments, indicating no effect through this signalling pathway. In conclusion, CPM ameliorated the visceral hypersensitivity and the referred pain caused by DCA, being as effective as the control drug. Furthermore, it improved the immune status of the animals, which could contribute to the visceral analgesia and the regeneration of the intestinal epithelial  integrity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28487283>Bile acids  and ursodeoxycholic  differentially regulate human β-defensin-1 and -2 secretion by colonic epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>Bile acids and epithelial-derived human β-defensins (HβDs) are known to be important factors in the regulation of colonic mucosal   and inflammation. We hypothesized that bile acids regulate colonic HβD expression and aimed to test this by investigating the effects of  (DCA) and ursodeoxycholic  on the expression and release of HβD1 and HβD2 from colonic epithelial cells and mucosal tissues. DCA (10-150 µM) stimulated the release of both HβD1 and HβD2 from epithelial cell monolayers and human colonic mucosal tissue  In contrast, ursodeoxycholic  (50-200 µM) inhibited both basal and DCA-induced defensin release. Effects of DCA were mimicked by the Takeda GPCR 5 agonist, INT-777 (50 μM), but not by the farnesoid X receptor agonist, GW4064 (10 μM). INT-777 also stimulated colonic HβD1 and HβD2 release from wild-type, but not Takeda GPCR 5, mice. DCA stimulated phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB, an effect that was attenuated by ursodeoxycholic , whereas an NF-κB inhibitor, BMS-345541 (25 μM), inhibited DCA-induced HβD2, but not HβD1, release.

Elevated levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) promote  re-establishment; however, we found that persistently elevated PGE2 hinders subsequent repair phases. The bacterial metabolite deoxycholate (DCA) promotes transition through repair phases via PGE2 regulation. During  re-establishment, DCA levels are locally diminished in the wound, allowing enhanced PGE2 production and  re-establishment. However, during transition to the wound channel formation phase, DCA levels increase to inhibit PGE2 production and promote crypt regeneration. Altering DCA levels via antibiotic treatment enhances PGE2 levels but impairs wound repair, which is rescued with DCA treatment. DCA acts via its receptor, farnesoid X receptor, to inhibit the enzyme cPLA2 required for PGE2 synthesis. Thus, colonic wound repair requires temporally regulated signals from microbial metabolites to coordinate host-associated signaling cascades. VIDEO ABSTRACT.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Since intestinal ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) is characterized by hyperpermeability, bacterial translocation and inflammation, we aimed to investigate, for the first time, if the FXR-agonist obeticholic  (OCA) could attenuate intestinal ischemia reperfusion injury.In a validated rat model of intestinal IRI (laparotomy + temporary mesenteric artery clamping), 3 conditions were tested (n = 16/group): laparotomy only (sham group); ischemia 60min+ reperfusion 60min + vehicle pretreatment (IR group); ischemia 60min + reperfusion 60min + OCA pretreatment (IR+OCA group). Vehicle or OCA (INT-747, 2*30mg/kg) was administered by gavage 24h and 4h prior to IRI. The following end-points were analyzed: 7-day survival; biomarkers of enterocyte viability (L-lactate, I-FABP); histology (morphologic injury to villi/crypts and villus length); intestinal permeability (Ussing chamber); endotoxin translocation (Lipopolysaccharide assay); cytokines (IL-6, IL-1-β, TNFα, IFN-γ IL-10, IL-13); apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3); and autophagy (LC3, p62).It was found that intestinal IRI was associated with high mortality (90%); loss of intestinal integrity (structurally and functionally); increased endotoxin translocation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production; and inhibition of autophagy. Conversely, OCA-pretreatment improved 7-day survival up to 50% which was associated with prevention of epithelial injury, preserved intestinal architecture and permeability. Additionally, FXR-agonism led to decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine release and alleviated autophagy inhibition.Pretreatment with OCA, an FXR-agonist, improves survival in a rodent model of intestinal IRI, preserves the gut   and suppresses inflammation. These results turn FXR into a promising target for various conditions associated with intestinal ischemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29084077>Accumulation of HLA-DR4 in Colonic Epithelial Cells Causes Severe Colitis in Homozygous HLA-DR4 Transgenic Mice.</a></h2><p>Homozygous HLA-DR4/I-E transgenic mice (tgm) spontaneously developed colitis similar to human ulcerative colitis. We explored whether endoplasmic reticulum stress in colonic epithelial cells due to overexpression of HLA-DR4/I-E was involved in the pathogenesis of colitis.Major histocompatibility complex class II transactivator-knockout (CIITAKO) background tgm were established to test the involvement of HLA-DR4/I-E expression in the pathogenesis of colitis. Histological and cellular analyses were performed and the effect of oral administration of the molecular chaperone tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) and antibiotics were investigated. IgA content of feces and serum and presence of IgA-coated fecal bacteria were also investigated.Aberrantly accumulated HLA-DR4/I-E molecules in colonic epithelial cells were observed only in the colitic homozygous tgm, which was accompanied by upregulation of the endoplasmic reticulum stress marker Binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) and reduced mucus. Homozygous tgm with CIITAKO, and thus absent of HLA-DR4/I-E expression, did not develop colitis. Oral administration of TUDCA to homozygotes reduced HLA-DR4/I-E and BiP expression in colonic epithelial cells and restored the barrier function of the intestinal tract. The IgA content of feces and serum, and numbers of IgA-coated fecal bacteria were higher in the colitic tgm, and antibiotic administration suppressed the expression of HLA-DR4/I-E and colitis.The pathogenesis of the colitis observed in the homozygous tgm was likely due to endoplasmic reticulum stress, resulting in goblet cell damage and compromised mucus production in the colonic epithelial cells in which HLA-DR4/I-E molecules were heavily accumulated. Commensal bacteria seemed to be involved in the accumulation of HLA-DR4/I-E, leading to development of the colitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29089630>The food-borne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni depends on the AddAB DNA repair system to defend against bile in the intestinal environment.</a></h2><p>Accurate repair of DNA damage is crucial to ensure genome stability and cell survival of all organisms. Bile functions as a defensive barrier against intestinal  by pathogenic microbes. Campylobacter jejuni, a leading bacterial cause of foodborne illness, possess strategies to mitigate the toxic components of bile. We recently found that growth of C. jejuni in medium with deoxycholate, a component of bile, caused DNA damage consistent with the exposure to reactive oxygen species. We hypothesized that C. jejuni must repair DNA damage caused by reactive oxygen species to restore chromosomal integrity. Our efforts focused on determining the importance of the putative AddAB DNA repair proteins. A C. jejuni addAB mutant demonstrated enhanced sensitivity to deoxycholate and was impaired in DNA double strand break repair. Complementation of the addAB mutant restored resistance to deoxycholate, as well as function of the DNA double strand break repair system. The importance of these findings translated to the natural host, where the AddAB system was found to be required for efficient C. jejuni  of the chicken intestine. This research provides new insight into the molecular mechanism utilized by C. jejuni, and possibly other intestinal pathogens, to survive in the presence of bile.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29672156>Ursodeoxycholic  protects against intestinal barrier breakdown by promoting enterocyte migration via EGFR- and COX-2-dependent mechanisms.</a></h2><p>The intestinal barrier is often disrupted in disease states, and intestinal barrier failure leads to sepsis. Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is a bile  that may protect the intestinal barrier. We hypothesized that UDCA would protect the intestinal  in injury models. To test this hypothesis, we utilized an in vitro wound-healing assay and a mouse model of intestinal barrier injury. We found that UDCA stimulates intestinal epithelial cell migration in vitro, and this migration was blocked by inhibition of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), or ERK. Furthermore, UDCA stimulated both COX-2 induction and EGFR phosphorylation. In vivo UDCA protected the intestinal barrier from LPS-induced injury as measured by FITC dextran leakage into the serum. Using 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine injections, we found that UDCA stimulated intestinal epithelial cell migration in these animals. These effects were blocked with either administration of Rofecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, or in EGFR-dominant negative Velvet mice, wherein UDCA had no effect on LPS-induced injury. Finally, we found increased COX-2 and phosphorylated ERK levels in LPS animals also treated with UDCA. Taken together, these data suggest that UDCA can stimulate intestinal epithelial cell migration and protect against acute intestinal injury via an EGFR- and COX-2-dependent mechanism. UDCA may be an effective treatment to prevent the early onset of -origin sepsis. NEW & NOTEWORTHY In this study, we show that the secondary bile  ursodeoxycholic  stimulates intestinal epithelial cell migration after cellular injury and also protects the intestinal barrier in an acute rodent injury model, neither of which has been previously reported. These effects are dependent on epidermal growth factor receptor activation and downstream cyclooxygenase 2 upregulation in the small intestine. This provides a potential treatment for acute, -origin sepsis as seen in diseases such as necrotizing enterocolitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30339173> disrupts the intestinal mucosal  and promotes intestinal tumorigenesis.</a></h2><p>High-fat diet, which leads to an increased level of  (DCA) in the intestine, is a major environmental factor in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, evidence relating to bile acids and intestinal tumorigenesis remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of DCA on the intestinal mucosal  and its impact on the development of CRC. Here we showed that DCA disrupted cell monolayer integrity and increased proinflammatory cytokine production in intestinal cancer and precancerous cell lines (Caco-2 and IMCE). Apcmin/+ mice receiving DCA increased the number and size of intestinal adenomas and promoted the adenoma-adenocarcinoma sequence. Importantly, DCA induced the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, increased the production of inflammatory cytokines, and led to intestinal low grade inflammation. A reduction of tight junction protein zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) and the number of intestinal cells including goblet cells and Paneth cells was also observed after DCA treatment. Moreover, DCA significantly reduced the level of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), and promoted the polarization of M2 macrophages in the intestine of Apcmin/+ mice. In conclusion, these data suggested that DCA induced intestinal low grade inflammation and disrupted the mucosal physical and functional barriers, aggravating intestinal tumorigenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26579439>Bile  nuclear receptor FXR and digestive system diseases.</a></h2><p>Bile acids (BAs) are not only digestive surfactants but also important cell signaling molecules, which stimulate several signaling pathways to regulate some important biological processes. The bile--activated nuclear receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), plays a pivotal role in regulating bile , lipid and glucose homeostasis as well as in regulating the inflammatory responses,   and prevention of bacterial translocation in the intestinal tract. As expected, FXR is involved in the pathophysiology of a wide range of diseases of gastrointestinal tract, including inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer and type 2 diabetes. In this review, we discuss current knowledge of the roles of FXR in  of the digestive system and the related diseases.

Dysbiosis is associated with intestinal tumorigenesis.  (DCA), a secondary bile  increased by a western diet, correlates with intestinal carcinogenesis. However, evidence relating bile acids, intestinal microbiota and tumorigenesis are limited. In our study, we investigated the effect of DCA on induction of intestinal dysbiosis and its roles in intestinal carcinogenesis. Alteration of the composition of the intestinal microbiota was induced in DCA-treated APC mice, which was accompanied by impaired intestinal , gut low grade inflammation and tumor progression. The transfer of fecal microbiota from DCA-treated mice to another group of Apc mice increased tumor multiplicity, induced inflammation and recruited M2 phenotype tumor-associated macrophages. Importantly, the fecal microbiota transplantation activated the tumor-associated Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Moreover, microbiota depletion by a cocktail of antibiotics was sufficient to block DCA-induced intestinal carcinogenesis, further suggesting the role of dysbiosis in tumor development. Our study demonstrated that alteration of the microbial community induced by DCA promoted intestinal carcinogenesis.© 2017 UICC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29351391>The bile acids,  and ursodeoxycholic , regulate colonic epithelial wound healing.</a></h2><p>The intestinal epithelium constitutes an innate  which, upon injury, undergoes self-repair processes known as restitution. Although bile acids are known as important regulators of epithelial  in health and disease, their effects on wound healing processes are not yet clear. Here we set out to investigate the effects of the colonic bile acids,  (DCA) and ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), on epithelial restitution. Wound healing in T cell monolayers grown on transparent, permeable supports was assessed over 48 h with or without bile acids. Cell migration was measured in Boyden chambers. mRNA and protein expression were measured by RT-PCR and Western blotting. DCA (50-150 µM) significantly inhibited wound closure in cultured epithelial monolayers and attenuated cell migration in Boyden chamber assays. DCA also induced nuclear accumulation of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), whereas an FXR agonist, GW4064 (10 µM), inhibited wound closure. Both DCA and GW4064 attenuated the expression of CFTR Cl channels, whereas inhibition of CFTR activity with either CFTR--172 (10 µM) or GlyH-101 (25 µM) also prevented wound healing. Promoter/reporter assays revealed that FXR-induced downregulation of CFTR is mediated at the transcriptional level. In contrast, UDCA (50-150 µM) enhanced wound healing in vitro and prevented the effects of DCA. Finally, DCA inhibited and UDCA promoted mucosal healing in an in vivo mouse model. In conclusion, these studies suggest bile acids are important regulators of epithelial wound healing and are therefore good targets for development of new drugs to modulate intestinal   in disease treatment. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The secondary bile , , inhibits colonic epithelial wound healing, an effect which appears to be mediated by activation of the nuclear bile  receptor, FXR, with subsequent downregulation of CFTR expression and activity. In contrast, ursodeoxycholic  promotes wound healing, suggesting it may provide an alternative approach to prevent the losses of   that are associated with mucosal inflammation in IBD patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30268667>Ursodeoxycholic  ameliorates diabetic retinopathy via reducing retinal inflammation and reversing the breakdown of blood-retinal .</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is the hydrolysis of tauroursodeoxycholic , which is the main ingredient from bear gall that has functions including clearing heat and detoxification, and improving eyesight. However, whether UDCA has improving effects on diabetic retinopathy (DR) is not known. This study aims to observe the amelioration of UDCA on DR and its engaged mechanisms. The results of Evans blue permeation assay showed that UDCA (15, 30 mg/kg) reversed the breakdown of blood-retinal  (BRB) and the decreased expression of claudin-1 and claudin-19 in STZ-induced diabetic mice. UDCA reversed the reduced thickness of both inner nuclear layer (INL) and outer nuclear layer (ONL) in STZ-induced diabetic mice. UDCA reduced retinal ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) expression in STZ-induced diabetic mice. UDCA reduced the expression of phosphorylated the inhibitor of nuclear factor κB kinase (IKK) and the nuclear translocation of p65 subunit of nuclear factor κB (NFκB) in retinas from STZ-induced diabetic mice. UDCA also reduced retinal expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in STZ-induced diabetic mice. In conclusion, UDCA attenuates BRB breakdown during DR development via inhibiting retinal inflammation and reversing the reduced expression of tight junctions (TJs) including claudin-1 and claudin-19.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Serum bile acids are elevated after liver damage and may disrupt the blood-brain  and enter the brain. Our aim was to assess the role of serum bile acids in the neurological complications after acute liver failure. C57Bl/6 or cytochrome p450 7A1 knockout (Cyp7A1(-/-)) mice were fed a control, cholestyramine-containing, or bile -containing diet before azoxymethane (AOM)-induced acute liver failure. In parallel, mice were given an intracerebroventricular infusion of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) Vivo-morpholino before AOM injection. Liver damage, neurological decline, and molecular analyses of bile  signaling were performed. Total bile  levels were increased in the cortex of AOM-treated mice. Reducing serum bile acids via cholestyramine feeding or using Cyp7A1(-/-) mice reduced bile  levels and delayed AOM-induced neurological decline, whereas cholic  or  feeding worsened AOM-induced neurological decline. The expression of bile  signaling machinery apical sodium-dependent bile  transporter, FXR, and small heterodimer partner increased in the frontal cortex, and blocking FXR signaling delayed AOM-induced neurological decline. In conclusion, circulating bile acids may play a pathological role during hepatic encephalopathy, although precisely how they dysregulate normal brain  is unknown.

In light of this issue, an amphiphilic sulfhydrylated N--N,O-hydroxyethyl chitosan (TGA-DHC) was synthesized to improve the oral bioavailability of PTX. First, TGA-DHC demonstrated substantial loading of PTX into the inner hydrophobic core. A desirable enhancement in the bioavailability of PTX by TGA-DHC was verified by pharmacokinetic studies on rats against Taxol and non-sulfhydrylated DHC micelles. Moreover, cellular uptake studies revealed significant accumulation of TGA-DHC micelles encapsulating PTX or rhodamine-123 into Caco-2 cells via clathrin/caveolae-mediated endocytosis and inhibition of P-gp efflux of substrates. The results of the Caco-2 transport study further confirmed the mechanistic basis of TGA-DHC efficacy; which was attributed to permeabilized tight junctions, clathrin-mediated transcytosis across the endothelium, and inhibition of P-gp. Finally, in vitro mucoadhesion investigations on freshly excised rat intestine intuitively confirmed increased intestinal retention of drug-loaded TGA-DHC through thiol-mediated mucoadhesion. TGA-DHC has demonstrated the capability to overcome what is perhaps the most prominent  to oral PTX efficacy, low bioavailability, and serves as a prominent platform for oral delivery of P-gp substrates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29139555>Tauroursodeoxycholic  inhibits intestinal inflammation and  disruption in mice with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>The gut-liver axis is associated with the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

Since fecal bile  dysmetabolism is associated with UC and tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) has been shown to improve murine colitis, we evaluated the effect of TUDCA on intestinal epithelial cell death in a mouse model of UC-like  dysfunction elicited by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). We identified the prevention of colonic caspase-3 induction, a key proapoptotic marker which was also over-activated in UC, as the earliest event resulting in a clear clinical benefit. Whereas vehicle-treated mice showed a cumulative mortality of 40%, all TUDCA-treated mice survived the DSS experiment during a 14-day follow-up period. In line with a  protective effect, TUDCA decreased bacterial translocation to the spleen and stimulated mucin production. Similarly, TUDCA inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced intestinal permeability and associated enterocyte apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic effect was confirmed in vitro by a dose-dependent inhibition of both receptor-dependent (using tumor necrosis factor and Fas ligand) and receptor-independent (staurosporine) caspase-3 induction in HT29 colonic epithelial cells. These data imply that caspase-3 activation is an early marker of colitis that is prevented by TUDCA treatment. These data, together with the previously reported beneficial effect in colitis, suggest that TUDCA could be an add-on strategy to current immunosuppressive treatment of UC patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28360029>Ursodeoxycholic  and lithocholic  exert anti-inflammatory actions in the colon.</a></h2><p> Ursodeoxycholic  and lithocholic  exert anti-inflammatory actions in the colon.  312: G550-G558, 2017. First published March 30, 2017; doi:10.1152/ajpgi.00256.2016.-Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) comprise a group of common and debilitating chronic intestinal disorders for which currently available therapies are often unsatisfactory. The naturally occurring secondary bile , ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), has well-established anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective actions and may therefore be effective in treating IBD. We aimed to investigate regulation of colonic inflammatory responses by UDCA and to determine the potential impact of bacterial metabolism on its therapeutic actions. The anti-inflammatory efficacy of UDCA, a nonmetabolizable analog, 6α-methyl-UDCA (6-MUDCA), and its primary colonic metabolite lithocholic  (LCA) was assessed in the murine dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model of mucosal injury. The effects of bile acids on cytokine (TNF-α, IL-6, Il-1β, and IFN-γ) release from cultured colonic epithelial cells and mouse colonic tissue in vivo were investigated. Luminal bile acids were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. UDCA attenuated release of proinflammatory cytokines from colonic epithelial cells in vitro and was protective against the development of colonic inflammation in vivo. In contrast, although 6-MUDCA mimicked the effects of UDCA on epithelial cytokine release in vitro, it was ineffective in preventing inflammation in the DSS model. In UDCA-treated mice, LCA became the most common colonic bile . Finally, LCA treatment more potently inhibited epithelial cytokine release and protected against DSS-induced mucosal inflammation than did UDCA. These studies identify a new role for the primary metabolite of UDCA, LCA, in preventing colonic inflammation and suggest that microbial metabolism of UDCA is necessary for the full expression of its protective actions. On the basis of its cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory actions, the secondary bile  ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) has well-established uses in both traditional and Western medicine. We identify a new role for the primary metabolite of UDCA, lithocholic , as a potent inhibitor of intestinal inflammatory responses, and we present data to suggest that microbial metabolism of UDCA is necessary for the full expression of its protective effects against colonic inflammation.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29076531>Topical protection of mice laryngeal mucosa using the natural product cashew gum.</a></h2><p>Evaluate the effect of in vitro exposure of mice laryngeal mucosa to solutions that simulated human gastric juice and to assess the topical protective effect of cashew gum on mice laryngeal mucosal integrity in vitro.Animal study.Murine (Swiss) laryngeal samples were mounted in Ussing chambers.

The SAP model was induced by retrograde infusion of 1.5% sodium deoxycholate into the biliopancreatic duct of the rats. All rats were sacrificed 24 h post-SAP induction. Arterial blood, intestine, and pancreas from each rat were harvested for investigations. The levels of serum amylase (AMY) and diamine oxidase (DAO) were determined using biochemical methods, and serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α level was measured by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Pathologic changes in the harvested tissues were investigated by microscopic examination of hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections. The expressions of sPLA2 at mRNA and protein levels were detected by reverse transcriptase PCR and Western blot, respectively. A terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay was used to investigate apoptosis of epithelial cells in the intestinal tissues.Compared to the control group, the expression of sPLA2 at both the mRNA and protein levels increased significantly in the SAP group (0.36 ± 0.13 vs 0.90 ± 0.38, and 0.16 ± 0.05 vs 0.64 ± 0.05, respectively; Ps < 0.01).
