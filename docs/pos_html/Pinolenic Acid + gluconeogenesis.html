Hepatocytes were isolated from four ruminating calves and exposed in suspension for 3 h to one of the following treatments: 1 mM palmitic  (1C16), 2 mM palmitic  (2C16), or 1 mM palmitic  plus either 1 mM oleic (C18:1), linoleic (C18:2),  (C18:3), eicosapentaenoic (C20:5), or docosahexaenoic  (C22:6). Oxidation of [1-(14)C]palmitic  or one of the [1-(14)C]-labeled treatment fatty acids to CO2 or incorporation into cellular triglycerides (TG), phospholipids, cholesterol, and cholesterol esters were measured. Rates of oxidation to CO2 were 3- to 4-fold higher for C22:6 than for other fatty acids, with the exception of C20:5, which had intermediate rates of oxidation to CO2. In general, treatments 2C16 and C18:1 yielded the highest rates of incorporation into most cellular lipids, whereas the polyunsaturated fatty acids were poor substrates for incorporation into cellular lipids. The most pronounced change was a large reduction of polyunsaturated fatty  incorporation into cellular TG compared to 1C16, 2C16, and C18:1. The unsaturated fatty acids also influenced palmitic  metabolism. The addition of C20:5 yielded the highest rates of palmitic  oxidation to CO2 followed by addition of C18:1 and C22:6. Treatments containing polyunsaturated fatty acids decreased palmitic  metabolism to TG and total cellular lipids compared with treatments 2C16 and C18:1. Rates of  from propionate were significantly higher for the treatment containing C18:1. Long-chain fatty acids vary in their routes of metabolism and influence palmitic  metabolism and  in bovine hepatocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25080783>[The different notions about beta-oxidation of fatty acids in peroxisomes, peroxisomes and ketonic bodies. The diabetic, acidotic coma as an acute deficiency of acetyl-CoA and ATP].</a></h2><p>The mechanisms of beta-oxidation of fatty acids developed more than a century before have no compliance with actual physical chemical data. The oxidation of long-chain C 16:0 palmitic saturated fatty  occurs not by sequential formation of eight molecules of acetyl-KoA but by force of formation of double bond and its hydrolysis on two short-chain C 8:0 fatty acids. Only short-chain fatty acids can become shorter under "chipping" of C 2-acetate with formation of C 4-butyric  (butyrate) and its metabolites (beta-hidroxibutirate, acetoacetate, acetone). The critical moment of oxidation is a hydrolysis of acetoacetyl-KoA on two molecules of acetyl-KoA. The molecule of ATP is to be expended on hydrolysis. The foundation of nonspecific biological reaction of stress--ketoacidosis,--is a decrease in mitochondrions of acetyl-KoA pool formed both from glycogen and glucose and fatty acids. The oxalate acetate inputs into Krebs cycle inadequate amount of acetyl-KoA which limits synthesis of ATP. The insulin has no direct involvement into development of ketoacidosis but prepares conditions to facilitate nonspecific etiological factor to initiate diabetic ketoacidosis. These are the pooling of small amount of glycogen in cytozol and the predominance in cytozol of cells and adipocytes of palmitic triglycerides which are slowly hydrolyzed by hormone-dependent lipase to release non-esterified fatty acids into intercellular medium. The increase of their concentration in blood plasma precedes ketoacidosis which is developing in patients without diabetes mellitus too. When cells begin to oxidize unsaturated linoleic and  acids with large number of double binds instead of medium-chain fatty acids, oleinic and palmitic fatty acids to support beta-oxidation in mitochondrions and synthesis of ATP the amount of butyric , beta-hidroxibutiryl-KoA and acetoacetyl-KoA increases and of acetyl-KoA decreases. The cause of fatal outcome is the development of metabolic acidosis, hyperhydration of cerebral cells with development of edema and a physiologic respiratory compensation of metabolic acidosis. The decarboxylation of acetoacetate and formation of acetone--initial stage of gluconeogenesis--formation of glucose from fatty acids--is manifested poorly both in primates and humans. From theoretical positions, to arrest ketoacidosis and to restore synthesis of AFT, it is reasonable to apply the infusion of optimal amount of acetyl-KoA which as nonpolar tioester can get over hematoencephalic barrier, plasma membrane and inner membrane of mitochondrions. It is supposed that diabetes mellitus is to be considered primarily as pathology of metabolism of fatty acids and only secondly as pathology of glucose.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12906057>Effects of long chain fatty acids on lipid and glucose metabolism in monolayer cultures of bovine hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>The objectives were to determine the long-term (48 h) effects of specific long chain fatty acids on hepatic lipid and glucose metabolism in monolayer cultures of bovine hepatocytes. From 16 to 64 h after plating, hepatocytes from three 7- to 10-d-old calves were exposed to one of the following treatments: 1 mM palmitic  (1 mM C16:0), 2 mM palmitic  (2 mM C16:0), or 1 mM palmitic  plus 1 mM of either stearic (C18:0), oleic (C18:1), linoleic (C18:2),  (C18:3), eicosapentaenoic (C20:5), or docosahexaenoic (C22:6) , or 0.5 mM each of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic  (C20:5 + C22:6). The two treatments containing 2 mM of saturated fatty acids, 2 mM C16:0 and 1 mM C16:0 plus 1 mM C18:0, increased beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations in the medium and [1-(14)C]palmitic  oxidation to -soluble products compared with all other treatments. The treatment containing C22:6 increased total cellular triglyceride content and incorporation of [1-(14)C]palmitic  into cellular triglycerides. The treatments containing C22:6 or C20:5 + C22:6 increased [1-(14)C]palmitic  metabolism to phospholipids and cholesterol. The presence of C22:6 in the medium decreased metabolism of [2-(14)C]propionic  either to glucose in the medium or to cellular glycogen. Overall, fatty acids differed in their effects on lipid and glucose metabolism in monolayer cultures of bovine hepatocytes with C22:6 eliciting the most profound changes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30036858>Transcriptome analysis reveals the effects of grafting on sugar and α- metabolisms in fruits of cucumber with two different rootstocks.</a></h2><p>Flavor quality in cucumber is affected by different rootstocks, but the molecular mechanism is largely unclean. To clarify the differences of sugar and aromatic compounds, cucumber (cucumis sativus) fruits from plants of self-grafted (SG) or grafted onto figleaf gourd (Cucurbita ficifolia; G1) or 'Weisheng No.1' rootstock (Cucurbita moschata ⅹCucurbita moschata hybrids; G2) were performed the transcriptome analysis. We obtained 1013 and 920 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from G1 and G2 compared to SG respectively, in which 453 genes were co-expressed. Functional annotations showed many DEGs were involved in /gluconeogenesis metabolism, fructose metabolism and α- metabolisms, 20 DEGs were selected from the 3 pathways to validate sequencing accuracy by quantitative real-time PCR. The gene relative expression levels were concurrent with RNA-seq results and sugar and aromatic compounds content phenotypes. Moreover, some vital transcript factors and transport proteins were analyzed. These findings indicate that different rootstocks could induce significantly changes in the physiological profiling and transcripts of sugar- and aromatic flavor-related genes. This study provides a novel insight into the molecular mechanisms of fruit quality regulated by candidate genes.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The PPAR family consists of three members: PPARalpha, PPARgamma, and PPARdelta. PPARdelta controls the transcription of genes involved in multiple physiological pathways, including cellular differentiation, lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. The receptor is expressed almost ubiquitously, with high expression in liver and skeletal muscle. Although the physiological ligands of PPARdelta remain undefined, a number of high affinity synthetic ligands have been developed for the receptor as a therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia and the metabolic syndrome.In this study, the metabolic role of PPARdelta activation has been investigated in liver, skeletal muscle, blood serum and white adipose tissue from ob/ob mice using a high affinity synthetic ligand and contrasted with PPARgamma activation. To maximize the analytical coverage of the metabolome, (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H-NMR) spectroscopy, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) were used to examine metabolites from tissue extracts.Analysis by multivariate statistics demonstrated that PPARdelta activation profoundly affected glycolysis, , the TCA cycle and linoleic  and  essential fatty  pathways.Although activation of both PPARdelta and PPARgamma lead to increased insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, PPARdelta activation was functionally distinct from PPARgamma activation, and was characterized by increased hepatic and peripheral fatty  oxidative metabolism, demonstrating the distinctive catabolic role of this receptor compared with PPARgamma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23099444>Elovl5 regulates the mTORC2-Akt-FOXO1 pathway by controlling hepatic cis-vaccenic  synthesis in diet-induced obese mice.</a></h2><p>Elevated hepatic expression of fatty  elongase-5 (Elovl5) induces FoxO1 phosphorylation, lowers FoxO1 nuclear content, and suppresses expression of genes involved in gluconeogenesis (GNG). In this report, we define the molecular and metabolic basis of Elovl5 control of FoxO1 phosphorylation. Adenoviral-mediated (Ad-Elovl5) induction of hepatic Elovl5 in diet-induced obese, glucose-intolerant mice and HepG2 cells increased the phosphorylation of Akt2-S(473) [mammalian target of rapamycin complex-2 (mTORC2) site], but not Akt2-T(308) (PDK1 site). The Akt2 inhibitor Akti1/2 blocked Elovl5 induction of FoxO1-S(256) phosphorylation in HepG2 cells. Elevated Elovl5 activity in liver and HepG2 cells induced rictor mRNA, rictor protein, and rictor-mTOR interaction, whereas rictor knockdown (siRNA) attenuated Elovl5 induction of Akt2-S(473) and FoxO1-S(256) phosphorylation in HepG2 cells. FA analysis revealed that the abundance of cis-vaccenic  (18:1,n-7) was increased in livers of obese mice and HepG2 cells following Ad-Elovl5 infection. Treating HepG2 cells with Elovl5 substrates established that palmitoleic  (16:1,n-7), but not γ- (18:3,n-6), induced rictor protein, Akt-S(473), and FoxO1-S(256) phosphorylation. Inhibition of FA elongation blocked 16:1,n-7 but not 18:1,n-7 induction of rictor protein and Akt-S(473) and FoxO1-S(256) phosphorylation. These results establish a novel link between Elovl5-mediated synthesis of 18:1,n-7 and GNG through the control of the mTORC2-Akt-FoxO1 pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27813582>Genome-wide expression analysis of a rice mutant line under salt stress.</a></h2><p>Salinity is a major environmental stress to plants. In this study, the ability of plants to tolerate salt was investigated by studying growth, physiological characteristics, and expression levels of genes related to the salt-stress response in the salt-tolerant rice mutant (Till-II-877), which was derived from γ-ray irradiation. Compared to plants grown under normal conditions, the height and root length of wild type (WT) were reduced by approximately 40 and 29% following exposure to salt stress for 3 weeks, whereas Till-II-877 line showed 29 and 23% reductions in plant height and root length, respectively. No significant changes were observed in total chlorophyll content, and the malondialdehyde content of the mutant increased less than that of the WT under salt treatment. Gene expression was compared between the WT and mutant lines using microarray analysis. An unbiased analysis of the gene expression datasets allowed us to identify the pathways involved in salt-stress responses. Among the most significantly affected pathways, changes in gene expression were observed in α- and linoleic  metabolism (in lipid metabolism), fructose and mannose metabolism and glycolysis-gluconeogenesis (in carbohydrate metabolism), cysteine and methionine metabolism (in amino  metabolism), and carbon fixation (in the  metabolism of photosynthetic organisms) under salt stress. These results show that the differential response of plants subjected to salt stress was due to changes in multiple metabolic pathways. These findings increase our understanding of the effects of salt stress in rice and may aid in the development of salt-tolerant rice cultivars.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15082421>Differential effect of saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids on hepatic glucose metabolism in humans.</a></h2><p>Prolonged infusions of lipid and heparin that achieve high physiological free fatty  (FFA) concentrations inhibit hepatic (and peripheral) insulin sensitivity in humans. These infusions are composed largely of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA; linoleic and ). It is not known whether fatty  composition per se affects hepatic glucose metabolism in humans. To address this issue, we examined the impact of enteral infusions of either palm oil (48% palmitic, 35% oleic, and 8% linoleic acids) or safflower oil (6% palmitic, 12% oleic, 74% linoleic acids) in 14 obese nondiabetic subjects. (2)H(2)O was administered to determine the contribution of  to endogenous glucose production (EGP), and a primed continuous infusion of [6,6-(2)H]glucose was administered to assess glucose appearance. As a result of the lipid infusions, plasma FFA concentrations increased significantly in both the palm oil (507.5 +/- 47.4 to 939.3 +/- 61.3 micromol/l, P < 0.01) and safflower oil (588.2.0 +/- 43.0 to 857.8 +/- 68.7 micromol/l, P < 0.01) groups after 4 h. EGP was similar at baseline (12.4 +/- 1.8 vs. 11.2 +/- 1.0 micromol x kg FFM(-1) x min(-1)). During a somatostatin-insulin clamp, the glucose infusion rate was significantly lower (AUC glucose infusion rate 195.8 +/- 50.7 vs. 377.8 +/- 38.0 micromol/kg FFM, P < 0.01), and rates of EGP were significantly higher (10.7 +/- 1.4 vs. 6.5 +/- 1.5 micromol x kg FFM(-1) x min(-1), P < 0.01) after palm oil compared with safflower oil, respectively. Baseline rates of  and glycogenolysis were also similar. However, after lipid infusion, rates of glycogenolysis were suppressed by safflower oil but not by palm oil. Thus these studies demonstrate, for the first time in humans, a differential effect of saturated fatty acids and PUFA on hepatic glucose metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20809928>Comparative analysis of drought-responsive transcriptome in Indica rice genotypes with contrasting drought tolerance.</a></h2><p>Genetic improvement in drought tolerance in rice is the key to save water for sustainable agriculture. Drought tolerance is a complex trait and involves interplay of a vast array of genes. Several genotypes of rice have evolved features that impart tolerance to drought and other abiotic stresses. Comparative analysis of drought stress-responsive transcriptome between drought-tolerant (DT) landraces/genotypes and drought-sensitive modern rice cultivars will unravel novel genetic regulatory mechanisms involved in stress tolerance. Here, we report transcriptome analysis in a highly DT rice landrace, Nagina 22 (N22), versus a high-yielding but drought-susceptible rice variety IR64. Both genotypes exhibited a diverse global transcriptional response under normal and drought conditions. Gene ontology (GO) analysis suggested that drought tolerance of N22 was attributable to the enhanced expression of several enzyme-encoding genes. Drought susceptibility of IR64 was attributable to significant down-regulation of regulatory components that confer drought tolerance. Pathway analysis unravelled significant up-regulation of several components of carbon fixation, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and flavonoid biosynthesis and down-regulation of starch and sucrose metabolism in both the cultivars under drought. However, significant up-regulation of α- metabolic pathway observed in N22 under drought appears to be in good agreement with high drought tolerance of this genotype. Consensus cis-motif profiling of drought-induced co-expressed genes led to the identification of novel cis-motifs. Taken together, the results of the comparative transcriptome analysis led to the identification of specific genotype-dependent genes responsible for drought tolerance in the rice landrace N22.© 2010 The Authors.
