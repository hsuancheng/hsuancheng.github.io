We also found that the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) signaling pathway resulted in MMP-9 overexpression and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation in mice treated with 1,-DCE. In this study, we further hypothesized that inflammatory reactions mediated by the p38 MAPK/ NF-κB signaling pathway might be involved in MMP-9 overexpression, blood-brain  (BBB) disruption and edema formation in the brain of 1,-DCE-intoxicated mice. Our results revealed that subacute poisoning by 1,-DCE upregulates protein levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and p-p65 in mouse brains. Pretreatment with an inhibitor against p38 MAPK attenuates these changes. Moreover, pretreatment with an inhibitor against NF-κB attenuates alterations in brain water content, pathological indications notable in brain edema, as well as mRNA and protein expression on levels of MMP-9, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, iNOS, and IL-1β, tight junction proteins (TJs), GFAP and Iba-1 in the brain of 1,-DCE-intoxicated mice. Furthermore, pretreatment with an inhibitor against MMP-9 obstructs the decrease of TJs in the brain of 1,-DCE-intoxicated mice. Lastly, pretreatment with an antagonist against the IL-1β receptor also attenuates changes in protein levels of p-p38 MAPK, p-p65, p-IκB, VCAM -1, ICAM-1, IL-1β, and Iba-1 in the brain of 1,-DCE-intoxicated-mice. Taken together, findings from the current study indicate that the p38 MAPK/ NF-κB signaling pathway might be involved in the activation of glial cells, and the overproduction of proinflammatory factors, which might induce inflammatory reactions in the brain of 1,-DCE-intoxicated mice that leads to brain edema.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31458134>Efficient Energy Harvesting in SnO-Based Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells Utilizing Nano-Amassed Mesoporous Zinc Oxide Hollow Microspheres as Synergy Boosters.</a></h2><p>Finding the material characteristics satisfying most of the photovoltaic conditions is difficult. In contrast, utilization of foreign materials that can contribute to light harvesting and charge transfers in the devices is now desirable/thought-provoking. Herein, a binary hybrid photoanode utilizing nano-amassed micron-sized mesoporous zinc oxide hollow spheres (meso-ZnO HS) in conjunction with SnO nanoparticles (NPs), i.e., SnO NP_ZnO HS (for an optimized weight ratio (8:)), displayed a nearly ∼4-fold increase in the efficiency (η) compared to that of bare SnO nanoparticle device. Enhanced device efficacy in the composite photoanode-based device can be accredited to the dual  of nano-amassed meso-ZnO HS. Nano-amassed micron-sized ZnO HS embedded in the photoanode can increase the light-harnessing capability without sacrificing the surface area as well as optical confinement of light by multiple reflections within its cavity and enhanced light-scattering effects. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis revealed an extended lifetime of electron (τ) and a higher value of   at the working electrode/dye/redox mediator interface, indicating a minimum photoinduced electron interception. The open-circuit voltage decay reveals a slower recombination kinetics of photogenerated electrons, supporting our claim that the nano-ammased meso-ZnO HS can serve as an energy  to the photoinjected electrons to retard the back-transfer to the electrolyte. Moreover, the improvement in the fill factors of the composite-based devices is endorsed to the facile penetration of the electrolyte through the pores of nano-amassed meso-ZnO HS, which increases the regeneration probability of oxidized dyes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31461548>Cosmetic benefits of a novel biomimetic lamellar formulation containing niacinamide in healthy females with oily, blemish-prone skin in a randomised proof-of-concept study.</a></h2><p>A randomised study was designed to evaluate the potential cosmetic benefit of a biomimetic, niacinamide-containing moisturising cream in oily, blemish-prone skin.Healthy adult women with oily, blemish-prone skin were randomised to one of three treatment groups: test, control, or positive control. In the test group, subjects used the test product (containing 4% niacinamide), plus the standard cleanser (Simple® Kind to Skin Moisturizing Facial Wash). In the control group, subjects received no moisturiser but used the standard cleanser. In the positive control group, subjects used Vivatinell Acnecinamide® Gel Cream (containing 4% niacinamide) as a moisturiser and Neutrogena Visibly Clear® Spot Clearing Facial Wash (containing % salicylic acid) as a cleanser. The positive control regimen was included to provide a comparison for estimates of effect size. The primary objective was to evaluate skin moisturisation as a change from baseline in corneometer values at 8 hours for the test regimen versus the control regimen. Analysis of covariance was applied for the primary efficacy analysis.A total of 132 subjects were randomised with 44 included in each treatment group. A significant difference was observed in the primary endpoint for the test regimen compared with the control regimen (least squares mean difference [95% CI]: 3.12 [0.68, 5.56], p=0.0128). A trend was observed in favour of the positive control regimen compared with the control regimen. Secondary measurements of moisturisation supported the primary efficacy outcome. Assessment of blemishes showed a significant difference between the test regimen versus the control regimen for change from baseline in mean total blemish count at Week 8 (least squares mean difference [95% CI]: -1.80 [-3.41, -0.19], p=0.0290). No statistical comparisons between the positive control group and the test group were performed.This study provides proof-of-concept evidence that a novel lamellar lipid moisturiser containing niacinamide, in combination with a standard cleanser, can help moisturise the skin and provide an overall improvement in the complexion appearance of people with blemish-prone skin..This article is protected by copyright.

To cause meningitis, blood-borne bacteria need to interact with and penetrate brain endothelial cells (BECs) that comprise the blood-brain . BECs help maintain brain homeostasis and they possess an array of efflux transporters, such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp), that  to efflux potentially harmful compounds from the CNS back into the circulation. Oftentimes, efflux also serves to limit the brain uptake of therapeutic drugs, representing a major hurdle for CNS drug delivery. During meningitis, BEC  integrity is compromised; however, little is known about efflux transport perturbations during infection. Thus, understanding the impact of bacterial infection on P-gp  would be important for potential routes of therapeutic intervention. To this end, the meningeal bacterial pathogen, Streptococcus agalactiae, was found to inhibit P-gp activity in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived BECs, and live bacteria were required for the observed inhibition. This observation was correlated to decreased P-gp expression both in vitro and during infection in vivo using a mouse model of bacterial meningitis. Given the impact of bacterial interactions on P-gp , it will be important to incorporate these findings into analyses of drug delivery paradigms for bacterial infections of the CNS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31419544>Crisaborole and atopic dermatitis skin biomarkers: An intrapatient randomized trial.</a></h2><p>Crisaborole ointment % is a nonsteroidal phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor for the treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis (AD).

A coding system to characterize patient assessments about opioids, physician responses to assessments, and patient-endorsed opioid side effects was developed and applied to transcripts of video-recorded visits. All visits were independently coded by  authors.Eighty-six established adult patients taking opioids for chronic pain; 49 physicians in  academic primary care clinics MAIN MEASURES: Frequency and topic of patients' opioid assessments; proportion of opioid assessments classified as clues (assessments indicating potential willingness to consider non-opioid pain treatments or lower opioid doses); physician responses to patient clues; frequency and type of patient-endorsed side effects KEY RESULTS: Patients made a mean of 3. opioid assessments (median ) per visit. The most common assessment topics were pain relief (51%), effect on  (21%), and opioid safety (14%). Forty-seven percent of opioid assessments (mean 1.5 per visit) were classified as clues. Fifty-three percent of visits included ≥ 1 clue; 21% of visits contained ≥ 3 clues. Physicians responded to patient clues with no/minimal response 43% of the time, sympathetic/empathetic statements 14% of the time, and further explored clues 43% of the time. Fifty-eight percent of patients endorsed ≥ 1 opioid-related side effect; 10% endorsed ≥ 3 side effects. The most commonly endorsed side effects were constipation (15% of patients), sedation (15%), withdrawal symptoms (13%), and nausea (12%).Patient statements suggesting openness to non-opioid pain treatments or lower opioid doses are common during routine primary care visits. Listening for and exploring these clues may be a patient-centered strategy for broaching difficult topics with patients on long-term opioid therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31536969>Biomanufacturing of a novel <i>in vitro</i> biomimetic blood-brain  model.</a></h2><p>Glioma is a malignant tumor that severely threatens human health. However, it is difficult for most therapeutic agents to penetrate through the blood-brain  (BBB) and exhibit their antineoplastic activity in the brain. In this manuscript, a biomimetic in vitro BBB model was created by a composite process, this model can provide a significant foundation for the research of drug transport, tumor treatment, tumor microenvironment and other fields. A series of tests and comparative experiments were performed to evaluate this model. The tests showed that the model enabled preliminary simulation of the structure and  of the BBB. Experimental results demonstrated: 1) the new technology enabled controlled release of growth factors and successfully induced endothelial progenitor cells into endothelial cells. Compared with the traditional gold standard, the Transwell model, the expression of four specific proteins that are related to the BBB characteristics was significantly increased (alkaline phosphatase(ALP) by 89.82%, γ-GT by 88.86%, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) by 57.40%, and Claudin-5 by 102.32%) in this model; ) Astrocytes had a promoting effect on the microvascular endothelial cells to form tight junction (ZO-1 increased by 249.35%, Claudin-5 increased by 184.99%), and there was a great difference between whether these two types of cells were contact cultured or not; 3) The gelatinous cell U118 had a destructive effect on the tight junction of BBB (ZO-1 decreased by 55.86%, Claudin-5 decreased by 37.84%).© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630422>NLRP Inflammasomes and Induced Skin Inflammation,  Recovery and Extended Skin Hydration.</a></h2><p>In vitro assays were designed to examine the release of active Caspase-1 (ACasp-1) from NLRP inflammasome-activated Normal Human Epidermal Keratinocytes (NHEK) employing a bioluminescent assay specific for measuring inflammasome-induced ACasp-1 expression.Four anticipated exogenous activators of the NLRP inflammasome including: UVB, ATP, Nigericin and Urban Dust were examined. Follow-up studies examined the influence of extracellular application of three different natural blends of known anti-inflammatories, one a polysaccharide blend, and the other two antioxidant blends, one oil-soluble the other water-soluble, to examine ACasp-1 inhibition. Clinical work using the same blend of polysaccharides employed at 3% in a moisturizing formulation was examined for skin  recovery, measured with TEWL over a 60 hour time frame after tape stripping on 10 individuals, and extended moisturization, measured using corneometer conductance after a single product application out through a 48-hour regression on 10 individuals.In vitro results indicated that two exogenous activators, 60 mJ/cm UVB and 5 mM ATP, worked to upregulate expression of ACasp-1 within a 20 hour timeframe. Additional studies were conducted to examine the influence of three xtracellularly applied active ingredient blends. A blend of polysaccharides demonstrated potential to inhibit ACasp-1 expression in both UVB- and ATP-activated skin cells. Oil-soluble and water-soluble antioxidant blends inhibited ACasp-1 expression in UVB-activated keratinocytes but not ATP-activated keratinocytes.  disruption studies indicated that 3% of the polysaccharide blend accelerated  recovery in a 60 hour time frame as measured by TEWL. Skin hydration studies showed an ability for the polysaccharide blend to show significant improvements in skin hydration out to 48 hours after a single application versus a moisturizing placebo.The role of the skin's innate immune response, controlled by NLRP inflammasomes, is beginning to be linked to numerous skin conditions including inflammaging.

We postulated that diabetes and systemic angiotensin-converting enzyme  (ACE2) deficiency would synergize to adversely impact both the microbiome and gut  .  Bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing and metatranscriptomic analysis were performed on fecal samples from WT, ACE2, Akita (type 1 diabetic, T1D), and ACE2-Akita mice. Gut  integrity was assessed by immunofluorescence, and BM cell extravasation into the small intestine was evaluated by flow cytometry. In the CE2-Akita or Akita mice, the disrupted  was associated with reduced levels of myeloid angiogenic cells (MACs), but no increase in inflammatory monocytes was observed within the gut parenchyma. Genomic and metatranscriptomic analysis of the microbiome of ACE2-Akita mice demonstrated a marked increase in peptidoglycan (PGN) producing bacteria. When compared to control cohorts treated with saline, intraperitoneal administration of MACs significantly decreased the microbiome gene expression associated with PGN biosynthesis and restored epithelial and endothelial gut  integrity. Also indicative of diabetic gut  dysfunction, increased levels of PGN and intestinal fatty acid binding protein- (FABP-) were observed in plasma of human subjects with T1D (n=21) and Type  diabetes (T2D, n=23) compared to non-diabetic controls (n=23). Using human retinal endothelial cells, we determined that PGN activates a non-canonical Toll-like receptor- (TLR2) associated MyD88-ARNO-ARF6 signaling cascade, resulting in destabilization of p120-catenin and internalization of VE-cadherin as a mechanism of deleterious impact of PGN on the endothelium.

Cognition was evaluated using the Barnes maze, and cerebral perfusion was examined by arterial spin labeling. At the molecular level, Western blot and histochemical analyses were performed to analyze fibrin content, amyloid burden, neuroinflammatory activity, and blood-brain  (BBB) integrity.Anticoagulation with dabigatran prevented memory decline, cerebral hypoperfusion, and toxic fibrin deposition in the AD mouse brain. In addition, long-term dabigatran treatment significantly reduced the extent of amyloid plaques, oligomers, phagocytic microglia, and infiltrated T cells by 23.7%, 51.8%, 31.3%, and 32.%, respectively. Dabigatran anticoagulation also prevented AD-related astrogliosis and pericyte alterations, and maintained expression of the water channel aquaporin-4 at astrocytic perivascular endfeet of the BBB.Long-term anticoagulation with dabigatran inhibited thrombin and the formation of occlusive thrombi in AD; preserved cognition, cerebral perfusion, and BBB ; and ameliorated neuroinflammation and amyloid deposition in AD mice.

Vitreous samples were collected from 28 eyes of patients with PDR and 4 eyes with vitreous floaters, which served as controls. For quantitative proteomics, vitreous samples were combined and proteins extracted and labeled with iTRAQ peptide-tagging reagents. Samples were fractionated by liquid chromatography (LC), analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and Gene Ontology (GO) analyses performed on differentially expressed proteins identified in the PDR samples.  In the PDR vitreous, 26 proteins were identified that were differentially expressed when compared to the controls. Of these, 7 showed a significant increase (0.05) and 19 a significant decrease (0.05)in expression in PDR patients. These included some high abundance proteins including Retinoic acid receptor reactive protein  (PDR 1=85.0, PDR =83.0, Control 1=119.6, Control =120., FC=0.710, 0.001), Semaphorin-4B(PDR 1=64.4, PDR =68.8, Control 1=135.4, Control =146.0, FC=0.473, 0.023), Apolipoprotein B (PDR 1=104.4, PDR =106.6, Control 1=89.0, Control =85.3, FC=1.211, 0.024), and Heat shock protein 70 (PDR 1=69.3, PDR =75.0, Control 1=137.7, Control =138.3, FC=0.523, 0.026), which are closely related to the pathological mechanism of PDR. GO analysis clustered the differentially expressed genes into three major functional domains: Biological Processes, Molecular  and Cellular Component. Differential gene expression was found in the categories of cellular metabolism, organonitrogen compound and carbohydrate derivative metabolic processes, transferase activity and transmembrane signaling receptor activity. KEGG Pathway analysis indicate that Chemerin signaling through Akt, Sema4B signaling via PI3K, and HIF-1α signal pathways were all altered in the PDR samples.  In this study we identified variations in expression of genes extensively involved in key biological processes in the retina including neovascularization, cellular metabolism and transmembrane signaling, which provide new insights into the pathophysiology of PDR. Extracellular matrix was degraded and endothelial cell migration was induced by Chemerin, in addition, the destruction of blood-retinal  and neuronal apoptosis were induced by ApoB. Chemerin and ApoB accelerated the development of PDR. Sema 4B participated in vascular protection, HSP70 conducted anti-apoptosis. These two cytokines protected the retinal neurovascular in PDR patients. Therefore, Chemerin, Sema 4B, ApoB and HSP70 may be the treatment target for PDR. .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31462256>Platelet-rich plasma activates AKT signaling to promote wound healing in a mouse model of radiation-induced skin injury.</a></h2><p>The skin is impacted by every form of external radiation therapy. However, effective therapeutic options for severe, acute radiation-induced skin reactions are limited. Although platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is known to improve cutaneous wound healing, its effects in the context of high-dose irradiation are still poorly understood.We investigated the regenerative functions of PRP by subjecting the dorsal skin of mice to local irradiation (40 Gy) and exposing HaCaT cells to gamma rays (5 Gy). The cutaneous benefits of PRP were gauged by wound size, histologic features, immunostains, western blot, and transepithelial water loss (TEWL). To assess the molecular effects of PRP on keratinocytes of healing radiation-induced wounds, we evaluated AKT signaling.Heightened expression of keratin 14 (K14) was documented in irradiated HaCaT cells and skin tissue, although the healing capacity of injured HaCaT cells declined. By applying PRP, this capacity was restored via augmented AKT signaling. In our mouse model, PRP use achieved the following: (1) healing of desquamated skin, acutely injured by radiation; () activated AKT signaling, improving migration and proliferation of K14 cells; (3) greater expression of involucrin in keratin 10 cells and sebaceous glands; and (4) reduced TEWL, strengthening the cutaneous  .Our findings indicate that PRP enhances the functions of K14 cells via AKT signaling, accelerating the regeneration of irradiated skin.

Schistosome Ca signaling has been an area of particular interest for decades, with a specific focus on L-type voltage-gated Ca channels (Cas). However, the study of these channels has been technically challenging. One  is the lack of pharmacological probes that are active on flatworms, since the dihydropyridine (DHP) based ligands typically used to study Cas are relatively ineffective on schistosomes. Here, we have characterized the effect of a structurally distinct putative L-type Ca agonist, FPL-64176, on schistosomes cultured ex vivo and in an in vivo murine model of infection. Unlike DHPs, FPL-64176 evokes rapid and sustained contractile paralysis of adult Schistosoma mansoni reminiscent of the anthelmintic praziquantel. This is accompanied by tegument disruption and an arrest of mitotic activity in somatic stem cells and germ line tissues. Interestingly, this strong ex vivo phenotype was temperature dependent, with FPL-64176 treatment being less potent at 37 °C than 23 °C. However, FPL-64176 caused intra-tegument lesions at the basement membrane of worms cultured ex vivo under both conditions, as well as an in vivo hepatic shift of parasites from the mesenteric vasculature of infected mice to the liver. Gene expression profiling of worms harvested following in vivo FPL-64176 exposure reveals differences in transcripts associated with muscle and extracellular matrix , as well as female reproduction, which is consistent with the worm phenotypes observed following ex vivo drug treatment. These data advance FPL-64176 as a useful tool to study schistosome Ca signaling, and the benzoyl pyrrole core as a hit compound that may be optimized to develop new parasite-selective leads.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Hence, a tight regulation of the sphingolipid homeostasis is essential to maintain proper cellular functions. Mammalian ORMDL proteins are orthologues of the yeast ORM1/ proteins, which regulate ceramide synthesis in yeast. ORMDL proteins inhibit serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), the enzyme regulating a rate-limiting step of the sphingolipid pathway to control the levels of ceramides and other sphingolipids. Sphingomyelinase phosphodiesterase like 3b (SMPDL3b) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored protein in the plasma membrane (PM) and determines membrane fluidity in macrophages. We previously showed that differential expression of SMPDL3b alters the availability of Ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) in human podocytes, which are terminally differentiated cells of the kidney filtration . This observation lead us to investigate if SMPDL3b controls C1P availability in human podocytes by interfering with ceramide kinase (CERK) expression and . We found that SMPDL3b interacts with CERK and can bind to C1P in vitro. Furthermore, CERK expression is reduced when SMPDL3b expression is silenced.

Here, we describe ZO- involvement in the formation of the apical junctional complex during early development and in TJ biogenesis in epithelial cultured cells. ZO- acts as a scaffold for the polymerization of claudins at TJs and plays a unique role in the blood-testis , as well as at TJs of the human liver and the inner ear. ZO- movement between the cytoplasm and nucleus is regulated by nuclear localization and exportation signals and post-translation modifications, while ZO- arrival at the cell border is triggered by activation of calcium sensing receptors and corresponding downstream signaling. Depending on its location, ZO- associates with junctional proteins and the actomyosin cytoskeleton or a variety of nuclear proteins, playing a role as a transcriptional repressor that leads to inhibition of cell proliferation and transformation. ZO- regulates cell architecture through modulation of Rho proteins and its absence induces hypertrophy due to inactivation of the Hippo pathway and activation of mTOR and S6K. The interaction of ZO- with viral oncoproteins and kinases and its silencing in diverse carcinomas reinforce the view of ZO- as a tumor regulator protein.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504110>Tryptophan, glutamine, leucine, and micronutrient supplementation improves environmental enteropathy in Zambian adults: a randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>Environmental enteropathy (EE) refers to villus blunting, reduced absorption, and microbial translocation in children and adults in tropical or deprived residential areas. In previous work we observed an effect of micronutrients on villus height (VH).We aimed to determine, in a randomized controlled trial, if amino acid (AA) or multiple micronutrient (MM) supplementation can improve intestinal structure or  dysfunction in Zambian adults with EE.AA (tryptophan, leucine, and glutamine) and/or MM supplements were given for 16 wk in a  ×  factorial comparison against placebo. Primary outcomes were changes in VH, in vivo small intestinal  dysfunction assessed by confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE), and mechanistic (or mammalian) target of rapamycin complex 1 (MTORC1) nutrient responsiveness in lamina propria CD4+ lymphocytes.Over 16 wk AA, but not MM, supplementation increased VH by 16% (34.5 μm) compared with placebo (P = 0.04). Fluorescein leak, measured by CLE, improved only in those allocated to both AA and MM supplementation. No effect was seen on MTORC1 activation, but posttreatment MTORC1 and VH were correlated (ρ = 0.51; P = 0.001), and change in MTORC1 was correlated with change in VH in the placebo group (ρ = 0.63; P = 0.03). In secondary analyses no effect was observed on biomarkers of microbial translocation. Metabolomic analyses suggest alterations in a number of microbial- and host-derived metabolites including the leucine metabolite β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate, which was increased by AA supplementation and correlated with VH.In this phase  trial, AA supplementation protected against a decline in VH over the supplementation period, and improved   when combined with micronutrients. Leucine and MTORC1 metabolism may be involved in the mechanism of effect.

The aim of the study was to analyze the effect of Nod2 deficiency on   and stool microbiome after extensive ileocecal resection in mice. Male C57BL6/J wild-type and Nod2 knock-out mice underwent 40% ileocecal resection. Sham control mice received simple transection of the ileum. Clinical outcome was monitored daily.   was measured with Ussing chambers using FITC-4-kDa-Dextran flux, transmucosal electrical resistance and dilution potentials. Immunofluorescence of claudin- was studied. Composition of the stool microbiome was assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Resected Nod2 KO mice had impaired clinical outcome compared to resected WT mice. This was accompanied by increased stool water contents and increased plasma aldosterone. Histomorphological adaptation was independent of Nod2.   studies revealed impaired sodium to chloride permeability and altered claudin- localization in the absence of Nod2. Resection induced decreases of bacterial diversity and a shift of Bacteriodetes/Firmicutes ratios. ICR-induced increase in Proteobacteria was absent in Nod2-deficient mice.

Here, Ni-Fe-W hydroxide complex by incorporation of tungsten into nickel-iron layered double hydroxide was proposed and investigated. As-formed Ni-Fe-W hydroxide nanosheets are highly porous and self-supported on the carbon fiber substrates, which promote the exposure of the active metal sites for significantly enhanced OER activity. Moreover, the as-introduced tungsten is evidenced to be in a W oxidation state which can facilitate charge transfer and electron capture and thereby decrease the critical conversion  of the absorbed OH to O radical in OER. A series of Ni-Fe-W hydroxides were prepared, with the best molar ratio of Ni-Fe-W sources being 6::1. The optimal NiFeW-LDH@carbon fiber electrode delivers a low overpotential of 264 mV at 10 mA cm and high stability (only 1.6% of the potential increase after 10 h) in alkaline electrolyte. Moreover, the structure of the constructed Ni-Fe-W hydroxide is evidenced to be stable and important for the electrocatalytically stable.

Thus, the effect of raw potato starch (RPS), a widely adopted RS material, on microbial composition and   of cecum for meat ducks was determined. Cherry Valley male ducks, 360,1-day-old, were randomly divided and fed diets with 0% (control), 12%, or 24% RPS for 35 d. Diets Supplemented with RPS significantly elevated villus height and villus height: crypt depth ratio in the cecum. The 16S rRNA sequence analysis indicated that the diet with 12% RPS had a higher relative abundance of Firmicutes and the butyrate-producing bacteria Faecalibacterium, Subdoligranulum, and Erysipelatoclostridium were enriched among all diets. Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium were significantly increased in the 24% RPS diet vs. the control diet. When compared with the control diet, the diet with 12% RPS also was found to notably increase acetate, propionate and butyrate contents, and up-regulated -related genes including Claudin-1, Zonula occludens (ZO)-1, mucin-, and proglucagon of cecum. Furthermore, addition of 12% RPS significantly reduced plasma tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and endotoxin concentrations. These data revealed that diets supplemented with 12% RPS partially improved cecal   in meat ducks by enhancing intestinal morphology and  markers expression, modulating the microbiota composition, and attenuating inflammatory markers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576180>In vitro safety and performance evaluation of a seawater solution enriched with copper, hyaluronic acid, and eucalyptus for nasal lavage.</a></h2><p>The common cold is a viral infectious disease with symptoms such as runny nose, sore throat, and mainly, nasal congestion. State-of-the-art therapeutic approaches focus on alleviating the symptoms of this disease by non-invasive and simple-to-use methods. Nasal irrigation is one of the most accepted approaches to ease nasal congestion which, if left untreated, has a negative impact on the quality of life of patients.In this study, the safety and efficacy of a novel hypertonic seawater solution for nasal lavage enriched with hyaluronic acids, eucalyptus oil, copper, and manganese salts (Stérimar Stop & Protect Cold and Flu; SSPCF) have been investigated in vitro.An in vitro 3D reconstituted human nasal epithelium tissue model, MucilAir™, has been used in this study to investigate the safety of SSPCF on nasal epithelium by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion. The efficacy of SSPCF was measured by mucociliary clearance (MCC), ATP release, Alcian blue and aquaporin (AQP3) stainings.SSPCF treatment respected nasal epithelium tissue integrity and enhanced   without inducing a cytotoxic response. Secreted LDH and IL-8 levels were similar to untreated controls. MCC rate was increased .5-fold and ATP release decreased 87% upon SSPCF treatment, indicating improved decongestion activity. SSPCF treatment after hypotonic stress helped recover cellular organization, as shown by Alcian blue and AQP3 staining assays.SSPCF appears as a safe and effective nasal irrigation formula that may alleviate the symptoms associated with common cold such as nasal congestion.© 2019 Huang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31593118>Age-specific reference values for cerebrospinal fluid protein concentrations in children in southern China.</a></h2><p>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein values decline over the first few months of life as the infant's blood-CSF  matures. However, published studies have not reported CSF protein reference values of Chinese infants and differ in the reported rate, timing, and magnitude of this decline. The objective of this study was to determine reference intervals for CSF protein using available data of children in southern China. This retrospective study included infants who had a lumbar puncture (LP) performed in the Department of Pediatrics of Southern Medical University Affiliated Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Foshan of an urban tertiary care children's hospital between January 1, 2008 and May 31, 2018. Infants with conditions suspected or known to cause elevated CSF protein concentrations were excluded. Of 3712 infants undergoing LP, 1043 (28.1%) met inclusion criteria. Results showed that there is an age-related decline in CSF protein concentration. The median CSF protein value was 62 mg/dL [interquartile range (IQR): 47-81 mg/dL] in infants aged 0 to 56 days (group 1). The 95th percentile values were 116 mg/dL for infants 0 to 28 days and 80 mg/dL for infants 29 to 56 days. The 95th percentile values by age category were as follows: ages 0 to 14 days, 117 mg/dL; ages 15 to 28 days, 107 mg/dL; ages 29 to 42 days, 96 mg/dL; and ages 43 to 56 days, 74 mg/dL. The median CSF protein value was 21 mg/dL (IQR: 16-31 mg/dL) in infants aged  months to <3 years (group ). The 95th percentile values were 57 mg/dL for infants  to <6 months and 34 mg/dL for infants 6 to ≤24 months. The 95th percentile values by age category were as follows: ages  to <3 months, 66 mg/dL; ages 3 to <4 months, 52 mg/dL; ages 4 to <5 months, 53 mg/dL; and ages 5 to <6 months, 42 mg/dL. We quantify the age-related decline in CSF protein concentrations among infants  years of age and younger and provide age-specific reference values. The values reported here can be used to interpret the results of LP in infants ≤ years of age.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31424188>Encapsulating MnSe Nanoparticles Inside 3D Hierarchical Carbon Frameworks with Lithium Storage Boosted by in Situ Electrochemical Phase Transformation.</a></h2><p>Electrode materials that act through the electrochemical conversion mechanism, such as metal selenides, have been considered as promising anode candidates for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), although their fast capacity attenuation and inadequate electrical conductivity are impeding their practical application. In this work, these issues are addressed through the efficient fabrication of MnSe nanoparticles inside porous carbon hierarchical architectures for evaluation as anode materials for LIBs. Density functional theory simulations indicate that there is a completely irreversible phase transformation during the initial cycle, and the high structural reversibility of β-MnSe provides a low energy  for the diffusion of lithium ions. Electron localization  calculations demonstrate that the phase transformation leads to high charge transfer kinetics and a favorable lithium ion diffusion coefficient. Benefitting from the phase transformation and unique structural engineering, the MnSe/C chestnut-like structures with boosted conductivity deliver enhanced lithium storage performance (885 mA h g at a current density of 0.

However, the mechanism by which astrocytes control BBB integrity, especially after traumatic brain injury (TBI), remains unclear. Here, we present evidence that astrocyte-derived fatty acid-binding protein 7 (FABP7), a differentiation- and migration-associated molecule, may  as a modulator of BBB permeability in a rat weight-drop model of TBI. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that TBI induced increased expression of FABP7 in astrocytes, accompanied by caveolin-1 (Cav-1) upregulation in endothelial cells. Administration of recombinant FABP7 significantly ameliorated TBI-induced neurological deficits, brain edema, and BBB permeability, concomitant with upregulation of endothelial Cav-1 and tight junction protein expression, while FABP7 knockdown resulted in the opposite effects. Furthermore, pretreatment with daidzein, a specific inhibitor of Cav-1, reversed the inhibitory effects of recombinant FABP7 on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-/9 expression and abolished its BBB protection after TBI. Altogether, these findings suggest that astrocyte-derived FABP7 upregulation may represent an endogenous protective response to BBB disruption partly mediated through a Cav-1/MMP signaling pathway following TBI.Copyright © 2019.

The present study aimed to determine the effects of alcohol and zinc deficiency on Paneth cell (PC) antimicrobial peptides - α-defensins, and to define the link between PC dysfunction and AH. Translocation of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) was determined in patients with severe AH and in a mouse model of alcoholic liver disease. Microbial composition and PC  were examined in mice. The link between α-defensin dysfunction and AH was investigated in α-defensin deficient mice. Synthetic human α-defensin 5 (HD5) was orally given to the alcohol-fed mice to test the therapeutic potential. The role of zinc deficiency in α-defensin was evaluated in acute and chronic mouse models of zinc deprivation. Hepatic inflammation was associated with PAMP translocation, and lipocalin- (LCN2) and CXCL1 elevation in AH patients. Antibiotic treatment, lipopolysaccharide injection to mice, and in vitro experiments showed that PAMPs, but not alcohol, directly induced LCN2 and CXCL1. Chronic alcohol feeding caused systemic dysbiosis and PC α-defensin reduction in mice. Knockout of functional α-defensins synergistically affected alcohol-perturbed bacterial composition and gut , and exaggerated PAMP translocation and liver damage. Administration of HD5 effectively altered cecal microbial composition, especially increased Akkermansia muciniphila, and reversed alcohol-induced deleterious effects. Zinc regulated PC homeostasis and α-defensins  at multiple levels, and dietary zinc deficiency exaggerated the deleterious effect of alcohol on PC bactericidal activity CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the study suggests that alcohol-induced PC α-defensin dysfunction is mediated by zinc deficiency and involved in the pathogenesis of AH. HD5 administration may represent a novel and promising therapeutic approach for treating AH.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31557198>Differential role of r-met-hu G-CSF on male reproductive  and development in prepubertal domestic mammals.</a></h2><p>The understanding of mammalian spermatogenesis niche factors active during sexual development may be leveraged to impact reproduction in farm animals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of r-met-hu/G-CSF (filgrastim) on prepubertal sexual development of guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) and ram lambs (Ovis aries). Individuals of both species were administered r-met-hu/G-CSF daily for 4 days. During and after administration protocols, testicular  and development were assessed through hematological responses, hormonal profiles (gonadotropins, testosterone and cortisol) testicular morphometry and germ cell kinetics. As expected, r-met-hu/G-CSF acutely mobilized white-lineage blood cells in both species. LH was increased by r-met-hu/G-CSF in guinea pigs (P<0.01) but T remained unchanged. In ram lambs gonadotropins and T increased in dose-response fashion (P<0.01) while cortisol values were stable and similar in treated and control animals (P>0.05). In guinea pigs there were no differences in testicular weights and volumes -mo after r-met-hu/G-CSF application (P>0.05). However, ram lambs showed a dose-response effect regarding testis weight (P<0.05). 66.66% of ram lambs had initial testes not yet in meiosis or starting the first spermatogenic wave. After 60-days only 25% of control animals were pubertal while all treated animals (1140-μg) had reached puberty. We propose an integrated hypothesis that G-CSF can stimulate spermatogenesis through two possible ways. 1) r-met-hu/G-CSF may go through the brain blood  and once there it can stimulate GnRH-neurons to release GnRH with the subsequent release of gonadotrophins. ) a local testicular effect through stimulation of steroidogenesis that enhances spermiogenesis via testosterone production and a direct stimulation over spermatogonial stem cells self-renewal. In conclusion, this study shows that r-met-hu/G-CSF differentially affects prepubertal sexual development in hystricomorpha and ovine species, a relevant fact to consider when designing methods to hasten sexual developmental in mammalian species.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31505812>Temozolomide and Other Alkylating Agents in Glioblastoma Therapy.</a></h2><p>The alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) together with maximal safe bulk resection and focal radiotherapy comprises the standard treatment for glioblastoma (GB), a particularly aggressive and lethal primary brain tumor. GB affects 3. in 100,000 people who have an average survival time of around 14 months after presentation. Several key aspects make GB a difficult to treat disease, primarily including the high resistance of tumor cells to cell death-inducing substances or radiation and the combination of the highly invasive nature of the malignancy, i.e., treatment must affect the whole brain, and the protection from drugs of the tumor bulk-or at least of the invading cells-by the blood brain  (BBB). TMZ crosses the BBB, but-unlike classic chemotherapeutics-does not induce DNA damage or misalignment of segregating chromosomes directly. It has been described as a DNA alkylating agent, which leads to base mismatches that initiate futile DNA repair cycles; eventually, DNA strand breaks, which in turn induces cell death. However, while much is assumed about the  of TMZ and its mode of action, primary data are actually scarce and often contradictory. To improve GB treatment further, we need to fully understand what TMZ does to the tumor cells and their microenvironment. This is of particular importance, as novel therapeutic approaches are almost always clinically assessed in the presence of standard treatment, i.e., in the presence of TMZ. Therefore, potential pharmacological interactions between TMZ and novel drugs might occur with unforeseeable consequences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626040>Overexpression of BCL- in the Intestinal Epithelium Prevents Sepsis-Induced Gut   Via Altering Tight Junction Protein Expression.</a></h2><p>Sepsis induces both intestinal hyperpermeability and epithelial apoptosis. While each has been implicated in mediating sepsis mortality, the relationship between these two processes is unclear. We hypothesized that preventing intestinal apoptosis would prevent gut  dysfunction. To test this hypothesis, transgenic mice that overexpress the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl- in the gut epithelium (Fabpl-Bcl- mice) and wild type (WT) mice were subjected to sham laparotomy or cecal ligation and puncture and orally gavaged with fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated-dextran (FD-4) five hours before sacrifice. Serum FD-4 concentration was assayed to measure intestinal permeability, and jejunal tight junctions were assayed for mRNA and protein expression. Baseline FD-4 concentration was similar between WT and Fabpl-Bcl- mice. Intestinal permeability increased 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours following sepsis in WT mice; however, FD-4 concentration was significantly lower at each timepoint in Fabpl-Bcl- mice. In addition, there were no statistically significant changes in permeability between septic and sham transgenic mice. Intestinal mRNA expression of claudin 3, claudin 5 and occludin were lower in septic Fabpl-Bcl- mice while claudin 4 mRNA levels were higher in Fabpl-Bcl- mice. In contrast, no differences were detected in claudins , 7, 15, JAM-A or ZO-1. Protein levels followed the same trend for all tight junction mediators different between WT and Fabpl-Bcl- mice except occludin was significantly higher in transgenic mice. Together these results demonstrate that decreasing intestinal epithelial apoptosis prevents hyperpermeability following sepsis via tight junction alterations which may be at least partially responsible for improved survival conferred by Bcl- overexpression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636247>An Autopsy Case of Pulmonary Capillary Hemangiomatosis with an Electron Microscopy Study.</a></h2><p>BACKGROUND Pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH) and pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) are rare diseases that share clinical, X-ray, and histological features. Most patients have poor prognosis due to severe respiratory impairment. Recently, EIF2AK4 mutations were found in some patients with PCH and PVOD, but the role of this mutation is still unknown. We report an autopsy case of PCH and discuss a mechanism of respiratory dysfunction based on an electron microscopy study. CASE REPORT The patient was a Japanese man in his sixties. He suffered from acute exacerbation of dyspnea during treatment of COPD. Respiratory  testing revealed DLCO' 32.1% and DLCO'/VA 23.6%. Echocardiography demonstrated findings consistent with pulmonary hypertension. A CT scan showed mild emphysema and small ground-glass opacity in the lungs. However, we could not find the exact cause of his respiratory failure and he died 28 days after admission. At autopsy, the histology showed multilayering capillary proliferation within the alveolar walls. Electron microscopy examination revealed prominent widening of the air-blood , scarce fusion of the epithelial and capillary basement membranes, and frequent narrowing of the capillary lumen. CONCLUSIONS We reported an autopsy case with PCH with no histological findings of PVOD. Whether PCH and PVOD are  different histological patterns of the same disease remains to be verified. The changes in the air-blood  detected by electron microscopy may explain the respiratory impairment and pulmonary arterial hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599965>Longitudinal analysis of the effect of water hardness on atopic eczema: evidence for gene-environment interaction.</a></h2><p>Several studies have identified an association between water hardness and atopic eczema (AE), however, there is a paucity of longitudinal data in early life.To examine whether water hardness is associated with an increased risk of AE and skin  dysfunction in infants and to assess effect modification by filaggrin (FLG) loss-of- variants.We performed a longitudinal analysis of data from infants in the Enquiring About Tolerance (EAT) study, who were enrolled at 3 months and followed up until 36 months of age.Of 1,303 infants enrolled in the EAT study, 91.3% (n=1,189) attended the final clinic visit and 94.0% (n=1,225) of participants' families completed the 36-month questionnaire.

To noninvasively analyze the physiological properties of the skin  functionin vivo, it is important to determine the SC thickness. Confocal Raman microscopy (CRM) is widely used for this task. In the present in vivo study, a new method based on the determination of the DNA concentration profile using CRM is introduced for determining the SC thickness. The obtained SC thickness values are compared with those obtained using other CRM-based methods determining the water and lipid depth profiles. The obtained results show almost no significant differences in SC thickness for the utilized methods. Therefore, the results indicate that it is possible to calculate the SC thickness by using the DNA profile in the fingerprint region, which is comparable with the SC thickness calculated by the water depth profiles (ANOVA test p = 0.77) and the lipid depth profile (ANOVA test p = 0.74). This provides the possibility to measure the SC thickness by using the DNA profile, in case the water or lipid profile analyses are influenced by a topically applied formulation. The increase in DNA concentration in the superficial SC (0- µm) is related to the DNA presence in the microbiome of the skin, which was not present in the SC depth below 4 µm.© 2019 S.

Here, we investigated the roles of sSJs in the  adult midgut. Depletion of any of the sSJ proteins from enterocytes resulted in remarkably shortened lifespan and intestinal  dysfunction in flies. Interestingly, the sSJ-protein-deficient flies showed intestinal hypertrophy accompanied by accumulation of morphologically abnormal enterocytes. The phenotype was associated with increased stem cell proliferation and activation of the MAPK and Jak-Stat pathways in stem cells. Loss of the cytokines Unpaired  and Unpaired 3, which are involved in Jak-Stat pathway activation, reduced the intestinal hypertrophy, but not the increased stem cell proliferation, in flies lacking Mesh.

The participants preferred sole disease responsibility to maintain usual family life; (4) No regrets. The participants managed their disease with medications only to maintain family cohesion and "the good life".The participants in our study downplayed the consequences of type  diabetes and chose to control their disease medically rather than by lifestyle changes. They renounced family involvement to maintain their lifestyle and promote family cohesion.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637161>Blood-Brain  Dysfunction in a 3D In Vitro Model of Alzheimer's Disease.</a></h2><p>Harmful materials in the blood are prevented from entering the healthy brain by a highly selective blood-brain  (BBB), and impairment of   has been associated with a variety of neurological diseases. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), BBB breakdown has been shown to occur even before cognitive decline and brain pathology. To investigate the role of the cerebral vasculature in AD, a physiologically relevant 3D human neural cell culture microfluidic model is developed having a brain endothelial cell monolayer with a BBB-like phenotype. This model is shown to recapitulate several key aspects of BBB dysfunction observed in AD patients: increased BBB permeability, decreased expression of claudin-1, claudin-5, and VE-cadherin, increased expression of matrix-metalloproteinase- and reactive oxygen species, and deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides at the vascular endothelium. Thus, it provides a well-controlled platform for investigating BBB  as well as for screening of new drugs that need to pass the BBB to gain access to neural tissues.© 2019 The Authors.

Whether skin dryness among diabetic patients is different from 'general' skin dryness is unclear. The overall aim was to compare the structure,  and molecular markers of dry and cracked foot skin between diabetics and non-diabetics.The foot skin of 40 diabetics and 20 non-diabetics was evaluated. A clinical assessment of skin dryness was performed and transepidermal water loss, stratum corneum hydration, skin surface pH, epidermal thickness, skin roughness, elasticity and structural stiffness were measured. Ceramides, natural moisturizing factors, histamines, proteins and molecular markers of oxidative stress were analyzed based on a non-invasive sampling method for collection of surface biomarkers.The mean number of superficial fissures in the diabetic group was nearly three times higher than in the non-diabetic group (11.0 (SD 6.) vs. 3.9 (SD 4.)). The skin stiffness was higher in the diabetic group and the values of almost all molecular markers showed considerably higher values compared to non-diabetics. Malondialdehyde and glutathione were lower in the diabetic sample.The high number of superficial fissures may be based on an increased stiffness of dry diabetic foot skin combined with different concentrations of molecular markers in the stratum corneum compared to dry foot skin of non-diabetics.Copyright © 2019 Tissue Viability Society.

This work tried to elucidate whether GLP-1, GLP- and EGF can affect the EB of the rumen. Ovine ruminal epithelia were incubated in Ussing chambers for 7 hr with 25 or 250 nM of either GLP-1 or GLP- on the serosal side, with .5 nM of EGF on the serosal side or with 0.25 or .5 nM EGF on the mucosal side. No treatment affected tissue conductance. Short-circuit current (I ) was affected by time and treatment and their interactions. Only 250 nM of either GLP-1 or GLP- decreased I in certain periods compared with 25 nM GLP-1 or 0.25 nM mucosally applied EGF; however, not when compared to control epithelia. Fluorescein flux rates (J ) of ruminal epithelia were affected by treatment, time and time × treatment interaction. The time × treatment interaction was based on an increase in J between the first and last hour in epithelia incubated with 25 nM GLP-1 or GLP- and in epithelia incubated with EGF. After 7 hr incubation, claudin-7 mRNA expression was downregulated in all treatments. Claudin-1 mRNA was upregulated after incubation with .5 nM EGF on the serosal side, claudin-4 mRNA was downregulated by .5 nM EGF on the mucosal side, and occludin mRNA was increased after incubation with 250 nM GLP-. The protein abundance of all tested TJ proteins was not influenced by treatment. We conclude that GLP-1, GLP-, and EGF have no obvious acute effects on the EB of ruminal epithelia under simulated physiological conditions ex vivo. However, by decreasing the mRNA expression of claudin-7 and partly affecting other TJ proteins, they may modulate EB in the longer term or under certain conditions.© 2019 The Authors.

Proteomic dysregulation is considered the key factor for neurodegeneration. Mechanisms involving deregulated processing of proteins such as amyloid beta (Aβ) oligomerization; tau hyperphosphorylation, prion misfolding; α-synuclein accumulation/lewy body formation, chaperone deregulation, acetylcholine depletion, adenosine 2A (A2A) receptor hyperactivation, secretase deregulation, leucine-rich repeat kinase  (LRRK2) mutation and mitochondrial proteinopathies have deeper implications in neurodegenerative disorders. Better understanding of such pathological mechanisms is pivotal for exploring crucial drug targets. Herein, we provide a comprehensive outlook about the diverse proteomic irregularities in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (CJD). We explicate the role of key neuroproteomic drug targets notably Aβ, tau, alpha synuclein, prions, secretases, acetylcholinesterase (AchE), LRRK2, molecular chaperones, A2A receptors, muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAchR), N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family ligands (GFLs) and mitochondrial/oxidative stress-related proteins for combating neurodegeneration and associated cognitive and motor impairment. Cross talk between amyloidopathy, synucleinopathy, tauopathy and several other proteinopathies pinpoints the need to develop safe therapeutics with ability to strike multiple targets in the aetiology of the neurodegenerative disorders. Therapeutics like microtubule stabilisers, chaperones, kinase inhibitors, anti-aggregation agents and antibodies could serve promising regimens for treating neurodegeneration.

Therefore, new forms of treatment and/or adjunct therapy are needed. Evidence has confirmed the modulation of the gut-brain-microbiota axis as a promising approach in MDD patients. The overall purpose of the SANGUT study-a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled Study Evaluating the Effect of Probiotic Supplementation on the Mental Status, Inflammation, and Intestinal  in Major Depressive Disorder Patients Using Gluten-free or Gluten-containing Diet - is to determine the effect of interventions focused on the gut-brain-microbiota axis in a group of MDD patients.A total of 120 outpatients will be equally allocated into one of four groups: (1) probiotic supplementation+gluten-free diet group (PRO-GFD), () placebo supplementation+ gluten-free diet group (PLA-GFD), (3) probiotic supplementation+ gluten containing diet group (PRO-GD), and (4) placebo supplementation+gluten containing diet group (PLA-GD). PRO groups will receive a mixture of psychobiotics (Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 and Bifidobacterium longum R0175), and GFD groups will follow a gluten-free diet. The intervention will last 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure is change in wellbeing, whereas the secondary outcome measures include physiological parameters.Microbiota and its metabolites have the potential to influence CNS . Probiotics may restore the eubiosis within the gut while a gluten-free diet, via changes in the microbiota profile and modulation of intestinal permeability, may alter the activity of microbiota-gut-brain axis previously found to be associated with the pathophysiology of depression. It is also noteworthy that microbiota being able to digest gluten may play a role in formation of peptides with different immunogenic capacities. Thus, the combination of a gluten-free diet and probiotic supplementation may inhibit the immune-inflammatory cascade in MDD course and improve both psychiatric and gut -associated traits. .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31452594>Identifying Barriers to Mental Health Service Utilization Among Heavy Drinking Community College Students.</a></h2><p>There are limited findings on mental health prevalence and service utilization rates among community college (CC) students.

Participants were 142 CC students who were heavy alcohol users (70% female; 59% White) from three public CCs in the Pacific Northwest who were participating in a larger study designed to adapt a brief intervention for high-risk alcohol use. Findings of the current study revealed that 32% of CC students had a positive screen for depression; 25% had a positive screen for anxiety; a total of 28% received mental health services in the past 12 months; a total of 41% reported a perceived unmet need for mental health services at some point in the past 12 months (i.e., needing mental health services but not receiving it). Students with mental health symptoms reported more barriers to receiving services, and were more likely to not receive services due to cost, compared to students without mental health symptoms. There were differences in type of  as a  of alcohol use severity, although there was no difference in number of barriers. Campuses may benefit from understanding mental health service utilization barriers their students report and to effectively advertise the services offered.

The Kaplan-Meier curves for survival time were produced and compared with the Log-rank test and Wilcoxon (Gehan) χ. Differential mRNA-seq combined with network pharmacology was used to disclose the network effect mechanism of LTP on AICH, and the obtained differential genes were mapped into the predictive empirical compound-target network model (ECT network model) and the empirical compound-target-pathogenesis (disease) network model (ECTP network model).The median survival time of four different doses of LTP-treated groups (0.00 g/kg, 5.78 g/kg, 11.55 g/kg, 23.10 g/kg) for adult AICH rats by 0.18 U collagenase was 14 h, 37 h, 150 h, and 51 h respectively, and the 7-day survival rates were 33.3%, 41.7%, 50.0%, and 38.5%, of which the medium-dose group (MD) had a longer survival time and higher survival rate. Through further validation experiments, the MD group had a better efficacy trend with a median survival time of 168 h vs 23 h in the model control group (MC) (Wilcoxon Gehan Test, χ = 3.478, P = 0.062). The transcriptomic analysis of mRNA showed that 583 significant differential genes were found between the MC and MD group and 7 key therapeutic targets regulated by 29 compounds in LTP on AICH were screened out by VCT and VCTP network model. These targets were involved in 5 regulatory models or pathways.Our study confirmed the exact efficacy of the LTP in the treatment of AICH and revealed the potential pharmacodynamic components and mode of action of the LTP on AICH. Using differential transcriptome of mRNA combined with network pharmacology, we screened out 29 chemical compounds as the potential effective ingredients of LTP which acted on 7 targets of AICH involving 5 pathological pathways, mainly including repairing the brain  defect, improving neural , protecting blood-brain  from damage, reducing inflammatory factors, and inhibiting apoptosis. The present study not only provides a new explanation for the 'multi-component, multi-target, multi-pathway' effects of the LTP on AICH but also screened out some major compounds of LTP and their potential targets which will facilitate the development of new drugs for AICH.Copyright © 2019.

Immune infiltrate was characterised by histological and immunofluorescence staining. Finally, an assessment of AD-related gene expression was performed using quantitative RT-PCR.PAR2OE mice treated with HDM displays all the characteristic clinical symptoms including erythema, dryness and oedema, skin morphology, itch and inflammation typically seen in patients with AD. There is a significant influx of mast cells (P < .01) and eosinophils (P < .0001) into the dermis of these mice.

The response mechanisms of isolated cells to such stimuli have been investigated in great detail. By contrast, little is known about the emergent multicellular responses to environmental changes, such as antibiotic exposure, which may hold the key to understanding the structure and functions of the most common type of bacterial communities: biofilms. Here, by monitoring all individual cells in Vibrio cholerae biofilms during exposure to antibiotics that are commonly administered for cholera infections, we found that translational inhibitors cause strong effects on cell size and shape, as well as biofilm architectural properties. We identified that single-cell-level responses result from the metabolic consequences of inhibition of protein synthesis and that the community-level responses result from an interplay of matrix composition, matrix dissociation and mechanical interactions between cells. We further observed that the antibiotic-induced changes in biofilm architecture have substantial effects on biofilm population dynamics and community assembly by enabling invasion of biofilms by bacteriophages and intruder cells of different species. These mechanistic causes and ecological consequences of biofilm exposure to antibiotics are an important step towards understanding collective bacterial responses to environmental changes, with implications for the effects of antimicrobial therapy on the ecological succession of biofilm communities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31473439>Structural transition of the nucleosome during chromatin remodeling and transcription.</a></h2><p>In eukaryotes, the nucleosome is the basic unit of chromatin.

Previous reports showed that sleep loss decreased sperm viability and progressive fast mobility, which may be a consequence of altered blood-testis and blood-epididymis . Therefore, we quantified changes in blood-testis and blood-epididymis  after sleep loss and related them to male fertility. Adult male Wistar rats were sleep restricted using the multiple-platform technique in a protocol of 20 hr daily sleep deprivation plus 4 hr of sleep recovery in the home-cage. At the 10th day,  permeability assays were performed with Na-fluorescein, 10 kDa Cascade blue-dextrans and Evans blue, and the expression of tight junction proteins, actin and androgen receptor was quantified. At the 10th day of sleep restriction and after sleep recovery days 1-7, males were placed with sexually receptive females, sexual behaviour was tested, and the percentage of pregnancies was calculated. Sleep restriction increased the  permeability to low- and high-molecular-weight tracers, and decreased the expression of tight junction proteins, actin and androgen receptor. Concomitantly, sleep restriction reduced the percentage of ejaculating males and the number of pregnancies. Sleep recovery for -3 days progressively re-established fertility, as indicated by a higher percentage of ejaculating males and impregnated females. In conclusion, chronic sleep loss alters fertility concomitantly with the disruption of the blood-tissue barriers at the reproductive tract, the mechanism involves androgen signalling.© 2019 European Sleep Research Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31433182>Multiscale Computational Study on the Catalytic Mechanism of the Nonmetallo Amidase Maleamate Amidohydrolase (NicF).</a></h2><p>Maleamate amidohydrolase (NicF) is a key enzyme in vitamin B metabolism that catalyzes the hydrolysis of maleamate to produce maleic acid and ammonia.

In particular, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) and QTAIM methods have been applied. The mechanism of the NicF-catalyzed reaction proceeds by a nucleophilic addition-elimination sequence involving the formation of a thioester enzyme intermediate ( in stage 1) followed by hydrolysis of the thioester bond to form the products (stage ).

During pregnancy, the Zika virus (ZIKV) poses a serious prenatal threat. STB cells are resistant to ZIKV infections, yet placental cells within the mesenchyme of chorionic villi are targets of ZIKV infection. We seek to determine whether ZIKV can open the paracellular pathway of STB cells. This route is regulated by tight junctions (TJs) which are present in the uppermost portion of the lateral membranes of STB cells. We analyzed the paracellular permeability and expression of E-cadherin, occludin, JAMs -B and -C, claudins -1, -3, -4, -5 and -7, and ZO-1, and ZO- in the STB of placentae from ZIKV-infected and non-infected women. In ZIKV-infected placentae, the pattern of expression of TJ proteins was preserved, but the amount of claudin-4 diminished. Placentae from ZIKV-infected women were permeable to ruthenium red, and had chorionic villi with a higher mean diameter and Hofbauer hyperplasia.

The glucocorticoid Dexamethasone is an important pharmaceutical for the treatment of colitis and other inflammatory bowel diseases. While suppressive effects of glucocorticoids on activated immune cells is significant, their effects upon epithelial cells are less well studied. Previous research shows that the effects of Dexamethasone treatment on polarized Caco- cell layer permeability is delayed for >10 treatment days (as measured by transepithelial electrical resistance).  intestinal epithelial cells turn over every 3-5 days; we therefore hypothesized that culture age may produce marked effects on gene expression, potentially acting as a confounding variable.

However, reperfusion injuries such as oedema and haemorrhagic transformation largely limit the use of this potent treatment to a narrow time window. Recently, transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM4) channel has emerged as a potential target for vascular protection in stroke management. Non-specificity and side effects are major concerns for current TRPM4 blockers. The present study was undertaken to develop a novel TRPM4 blocker for stroke management. We report the generation of a TRPM4-specific antibody M4P which binds to a region close to the channel pore. M4P could inhibit TRPM4 current and downregulate TRPM4 surface expression, therefore prevent hypoxia-induced cell swelling. In the rat model of 3-h stroke reperfusion, application of M4P at  h after occlusion ameliorated reperfusion injury by improving blood-brain  integrity, and enhanced functional recovery. Our results demonstrate that TRPM4 blockade could attenuate reperfusion injury in stroke recanalization. When applied together with reperfusion treatments, TRPM4 blocking antibody has the potential to extend the therapeutic time window for acute ischemic stroke.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31519352>Zeta potential of tear samples: A tool to explore the effects of wear of contact lenses.</a></h2><p>The aim was to develop a method to assess the electrostatic properties of human tear samples, and to evaluate their modifications induced by the wear of contact lenses (CLs).The  method was developed for the measurement of the isoelectric point (IEP) on relatively small quantities.

Zeta potential (ζ) as a  of pH was measured by a Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (Malvern Instruments) on 40%-diluted samples, obtained by mixing 57 μL of tears of different subjects of the same group with 85 μL of HCl aqueous solution. IEP was deduced as the pH at which ζ is zero, i.e. the net electric charge on tear constituents being neutralized.Within an error of about 0.05, IEPs were found to be .90 (T), .80 (T), and 3.16 (T). On average, a lower H concentration is needed to neutralize the surface charge of the tear components of etafilcon A wearers, compared to both T and T.IEP measurements on tear samples of wearers of different types of CLs are proposed in order to enhance the knowledge on the modifications of the profile of charged species in tears. The T results, compared to those of the other groups, are compatible with an increase, due to the wear of etafilcon A CLs, of the relative concentration of high-IEP proteins.Copyright © 2019.

However, the expression of Arrb2 in microglial cells and its influence on HSE prognosis is still undefined. We explore the pathophysiological effect of Arrb2 in the brain using experimental HSE mice. The expression of Arrb2 in microglia was decreased significantly 48 hours following HSV-1 infection. Arrb2 overexpression transgenic (TG) mice had a significantly lower mortality and survival rate was improved by 40% compared to wild-type mice. Arrb2 suppressed the generation of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 and increased anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-4 expression. Arrb2 also inhibited the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB in microglial cells. Arrb2 TG mice attenuated the blood-brain  breakdown and relieved cerebral edema, meanwhile, Arrb2 improved mice neurological  compared with wild-type mice.

First, we prepared two types of modified carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) including hydrazide-modified carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC-NH) and oxidized carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC-CHO) with varying degrees of oxidation. Then, pH-responsive poly (ethylene oxide)-block-poly (-(diisopropylamino) ethyl methacrylate) (PEO-b-PDPA) copolymers as micelle cores to carry hydrophobic substances were also synthesized through atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). An injectable hydrogel composite system was finally obtained by mixing CMC-NH and CMC-CHO polymer suspensions containing PEO-b-PDPA copolymer micelles through a Schiff base reaction. This newly-synthesized, tunable, cellulose-based double  system exhibits a pH-triggered, prolonged, and slow-release profile based on the release test using both Nile Red dye and doxorubicin.

Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is an inflammatory cytokine that is over-expressed in the keratinocytes of patients with AD. IL-33 transgenic mice, which express IL-33 specifically in keratinocytes, spontaneously develop AD-like eczema, suggesting that IL-33 is sufficient for the development of AD. IL-33 stimulates various cells, including group  innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), to produce type  cytokines, such as IL-5 and IL-13, and IL-33-stimulated basophils activate ILC2s via IL-4. ILC2s are enriched in human AD skin lesions, and ILC2 isolated from AD lesions, are activated by IL-33, not by thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). IL-33 induces IL-31, thereby promoting pruritus and scratching behavior. Conversely, scratching the skin promotes IL-33 release from keratinocytes. IL-33 reduces the expression of filaggrin and claudin-1; it also reduces the skin  . However,  destruction causes percutaneous exposure to allergens or IL-33 release. Thus, IL-33 is a common point of entry into the itch-scratch cycle of AD. These new findings can facilitate the development of novel therapeutic drugs targeting IL-33.Copyright © 2019 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Interaction with the protein scaffold and flowing blood modulates the ability of endothelial cells to migrate, align and maintain  . Interaction with neighbors provides the endothelial monolayer unique "collective" properties. However, the nature of local mechanical signaling - i.e., the local functional consequence of a cell interacting with its contractile neighbors - remains unclear. Using an advancing sheet of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells, here we examine the mechanical properties of an individual cell and its neighboring region. By combining Monolayer Stress Microscopy (MSM) with a novel analysis, we assessed several mechanical properties of an individual cell and its neighboring region. Across the monolayer, mechanical properties of the neighboring region defined multicellular "subdivisions" wherein constituent cells were exposed to a similar mechanical microenvironment. Adjacent subdivisions were separated by a narrow interface where adjoining cells were exposed to remarkably different mechanical microenvironments. Comparison of temporal fluctuations in mechanical properties of individual cells and those of their neighboring regions suggested three distinct intercellular mechanical signaling processes. These processes indicated that change in size, shape and speed of individual cells is associated with change in contractile forces in their neighboring regions. In summary, we present a novel approach to assess the mechanical interactions of individual cells with their contractile neighbors and identify potential functional consequences of such interactions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The present study was performed to investigate whether protective effects of hAMSC-CM against focal cerebral ischemia/ reperfusion (I/R) injury is associated with modulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. A rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was created and the animals were divided into three groups including sham, MCAO and MCAO + hAMSC-CM. Drug was administrated immediately after cerebral reperfusion (i.v). The expressions of mTOR, p-mTOR and LC3 were measured using Western blotting and real time-PCR, respectively. Apoptosis and neuronal loss were determined using TUNEL and Nissl staining, respectively. Infarct volume and the blood-brain  (BBB) damage were evaluated using ,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and Evans Blue (EB) uptake, respectively. Compared with sham, significant infarct volume, apoptotic cell death, and neuronal loss were found in MCAO rats that reversed by hAMSC-CM (P < 0.05). Likewise, MCAO rats exhibited increased mRNA level of light-chain 3 (LC3) and the LC3II/LC3I ratio as well as decreased expression level of p-mTOR that reversed by hAMSC-CM (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in the expression of total mTOR among the experimental groups. In summary, our results demonstrate that hAMSC-CM gives rise to neuroprotection following ischemic stroke by restoring mTOR activity and inhibiting autophagy.Copyright © 2019.

There is growing evidence that in addition to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), aging critically impairs pathways determining cellular resilience to oxidative stressors. In young organisms, the evolutionarily conserved nuclear factor-erythroid--related factor  (Nrf2)-mediated antioxidant response pathway maintains cellular reduction-oxidation homeostasis and promotes a youthful cellular phenotype by regulating the transcription of an array of cytoprotective (antioxidant, pro-survival, anti-inflammatory and macromolecular damage repair) genes. A critical mechanism by which increased ROS production and Nrf2 dysfunction promote vascular aging and exacerbate pathogenesis of age-related vascular diseases is induction of cellular senescence, an evolutionarily conserved cellular stress response mechanism. Senescent cells cease dividing and undergo distinctive phenotypic alterations, contributing to impairment of angiogenic processes, chronic sterile inflammation, remodeling of the extracellular matrix, and  dysfunction. Herein, we review mechanisms contributing to dysregulation of Nrf2-driven cytoprotective responses in the aged vasculature and discuss the multifaceted role of Nrf2 dysfunction in the genesis of age-related pathologies affecting the circulatory system, including its role in induction of cellular senescence. Therapeutic strategies that restore Nrf2 signaling and improve vascular resilience in aging are explored to reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in older adults.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660049>Skin   in patients under radiation therapy due to the head and neck cancers - Preliminary study.</a></h2><p>To present the possibility of non-invasive monitoring of the skin after radiotherapy in regards of epidermal  .Radiodermatitis constitutes 95% of all side effects in patients after radiotherapy. The proper assessment of the severity of radiodermatitis can be determined using semi-quantitative clinical scores [Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 4.0 (CTCAE)].The most accepted way to analyze the epidermal   is to determine Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL).In prospective study, we included 16 patients diagnosed with head and neck cancer treated with radiotherapy or concomitant chemoradiation in whom we performed non-invasive assessments of the skin  , including TEWL measurement. The final analysis included 6 patients (4 treated with adjuvant radiotherapy,  with radical chemoradiation). Clinical assessment of irradiated skin was based on target lesion score (TLS) and CTCAE v 4.0.The mean TLS score in the middle of irradiation was 1.6 points, after last irradiation it was .3 points; 3 months later the mean TLS score was: 0. CTCAE v 4.0 criteria:  patients had grade 0, 3 patients - grade 1; 1 patient - grade . There were statistically significant differences in TEWL related to irradiated skin in the following time intervals: before vs. in the middle; before vs. day after; in the middle vs. day after; in the middle vs. 3 months after; day after vs. 3 months after.The study showed that radiotherapy causes skin  dysfunction in all patients independently of clinical radiodermatitis.

The kinase RIPK4 and the transcription factor IRF6 are mutated in severe developmental syndromes in humans, and mice lacking these genes display epidermal hyperproliferation and soft-tissue fusions that result in neonatal lethality. Our understanding of how these genes control epidermal differentiation is incomplete. Here we show that the role of RIPK4 in mouse development requires its kinase activity; that RIPK4 and IRF6 expressed in the epidermis regulate the same biological processes; and that the phosphorylation of IRF6 at Ser413 and Ser424 primes IRF6 for activation. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), histone chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) of skin in wild-type and IRF6-deficient mouse embryos, we define the transcriptional programs that are regulated by IRF6 during epidermal differentiation. IRF6 was enriched at bivalent promoters, and IRF6 deficiency caused defective expression of genes that are involved in the metabolism of lipids and the formation of tight junctions. Accordingly, the lipid composition of the stratum corneum of Irf6 skin was abnormal, culminating in a severe defect in the  of the epidermal .

Based on computational docking studies, transcriptional activation experiments and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) protein immunofluorescence localization assays in cultured cells, 16α-hydroxytrametenolic acid (HTA) was discovered as a novel GR agonist in this study. HTA ameliorates TNF-α-induced Caco- monolayer intestinal epithelial  damage and suppressed activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (Akt), which attenuated downstream IκB and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) phosphorylation through GR activation.

GCs are also widely used in anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressant drugs. GCs are synthesized by the adrenal cortex as part of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and also by intestinal epithelial cells, among other peripheral sites. GCs are one of the main therapy choices for the exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease, but they are not useful to prolong remission, and development of tolerance with secondary treatment failure is frequent. Thus, GC actions at the intestinal epithelial level are of great importance, both physiologically and pharmacologically. We generated a tamoxifen-inducible nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C member 1 (NR3C1) mouse model to study the effects of GCs on epithelial cells .  deletion in epithelial cells of the small intestine and colon was associated with limited colonic inflammation at 1 wk postdeletion, involving augmented epithelial proliferation and mucus production, plus local and systemic immune/inflammatory changes. This phenotype regressed substantially, but not completely, after  wk. The mechanism may involve augmented inflammatory signaling by epithelial cells or defective  . We conclude that the epithelial GC receptor plays a significant role in colonic homeostasis in basal conditions, but its deficiency can be compensated in the short term.

In a typical unfolding experiment at constant force, the total extension jumps between two values that correspond to the folded and unfolded states of the molecule. For several biomolecular systems, the committor, which is the probability to fold starting from a given extension, has been used to extract the molecular activation  (a technique known as "committor inversion"). In this work, we study the influence of the force probe, which is much larger than the molecule being measured, on the activation  obtained by committor inversion. We use a two-dimensional framework in which the diffusion coefficient of the molecule and of the pulling device can differ. We systematically study the free energy profile along the total extension obtained from the committor by numerically solving the Onsager equation and using Brownian dynamics simulations. We analyze the dependence of the extracted  on the linker stiffness, molecular  height, and diffusion anisotropy and, thus, establish the range of validity of committor inversion.

Binding of hsa-miR-375 to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was verified by the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Changes in the viability and apoptosis in Caco- cells influenced by hsa-miR-375 were examined by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The regulatory effect of hsa-miR-375 on the intestinal epithelial  was examined by detecting transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and lucifer yellow flux. Relative levels of TLR4, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), occludin and inflammatory factors in Caco- cells were detected by qRT-PCR, Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Hsa-miR-375 was downregulated in intestinal mucosa tissues of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Knockdown of hsa-miR-375 decreased viability and TEER, but elevated apoptotic rate and lucifer yellow flux. Overexpression of hsa-miR-375 achieved the opposite trends. TLR4 was the direct downstream of hsa-miR-375, and its level was negatively mediated by hsa-miR-375.

Combinations of morphogenic regulator (MR) genes and ternary vector systems are promising solutions to this problem. In this study, we first demonstrated that MR vectors greatly enhance maize (Zea mays) transformation. We then tested a CRISPR/Cas9 MR vector in maize and found that the MR and CRISPR/Cas9 modules have no negative influence on each other. Finally, we developed a novel ternary vector system to integrate the MR and CRISPR/Cas modules. Our ternary vector system is composed of new pGreen-like binary vectors, here named pGreen3, and a pVS1-based virulence helper plasmid, which also functions as a replication helper for the pGreen3 vectors in Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The pGreen3 vectors were derived from the plasmid pRK2 and display advantages over pGreen2 vectors regarding both compatibility and stability. We demonstrated that the union of our ternary vector system with MR gene modules has additive effects in enhancing maize transformation and that this enhancement is especially evident in the transformation of recalcitrant maize inbred lines. Collectively, our ternary vector system-based tools provide a user-friendly solution to the low efficiency of CRISPR/Cas delivery in maize and represent a basic platform for developing efficient delivery tools to use in other plant species recalcitrant to transformation.{copyright, serif} 2019 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Either single or repetitive doses are commonly used for analgesic and antipyretic reasons and to prevent heart attacks, stroke, and blood clot formation. Recent studies show that it can also be used chronically to dramatically reduce the risk of a variety of cancers. However, prolonged usage of aspirin can cause severe damage to the mucosal , increasing the risk of ulcer formation and GI-bleeding events. In the present study, we show the effects of acute low-dose aspirin exposure as an active secretagogue-inducing gastric acid secretion. Studies were carried out with isolated gastric glands using the pH-sensitive dye BCECF-AM to assess acid secretion. The non-selective NOS inhibitor L-NAME (30 μM), or the specific inhibitor ODQ (1H-[1,,4]Oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one) was applied while monitoring intracellular pH. The effects of basolateral exposure to aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid, ASA) caused activation of gastric acid secretion  the H, K-ATPase. Our data suggest that aspirin increases nitric oxide (NO) production, which in turn activates acid secretion. Exposure of gastric glands to either the non-selective NOS inhibitor L-NAME, and the highly selective, soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor 1H-[1,,4]Oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) effectively inhibited aspirin-dependent gastric acid secretion. Aspirin can be considered as a novel secretagogue, in the way that it activates the H, K-ATPase.

It catalyzes the transfer of the gamma phosphate group from an ATP (adenosine triphosphate) molecule to a Serine/Threonine residue of a peptide substrate. Due to the importance of this enzyme, and protein kinases in general, a detailed understanding of the reaction mechanism is desired. Thus, in this work the phosphoryl transfer reaction catalyzed by CDK2 was revisited and studied by means of hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations. Our results suggest that the base-assisted mechanism is preferred over the substrate-assisted pathway when one Mg2+ is present in the active site, in agreement with a previous theoretical study. The base-assisted mechanism resulted to be dissociative, with a potential energy  of 14.3 kcal/mol, very close to the experimental derived value. An interesting feature of the mechanism is the proton transfer from Lys129 to the phosphoryl group at the second transition state, event that could be helping in neutralizing the charge on the phosphoryl group upon the absence of a second Mg2+ ion. Furthermore, important insights into the mechanisms in terms of bond order and charge analysis were provided. These descriptors helped to characterize the synchronicity of bond forming and breaking events, and to characterize charge transfer effects. Local interactions at the active site are key to modulate the charge distribution on the phosphoryl group and therefore alter its reactivity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635305>AMPK Activation Promotes Tight Junction Assembly in Intestinal Epithelial Caco- Cells.</a></h2><p>The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is principally known as a major regulator of cellular energy status, but it has been recently shown to play a key structural role in cell-cell junctions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of AMPK activation on the reassembly of tight junctions in intestinal epithelial Caco- cells. We generated Caco- cells invalidated for AMPK α1/α (AMPK dKO) by CRISPR/Cas9 technology and evaluated the effect of the direct AMPK activator 991 on the reassembly of tight junctions following a calcium switch assay. We analyzed the integrity of the epithelial  by measuring the trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER), the paracellular permeability, and quantification of zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) deposit at plasma membrane by immunofluorescence. Here, we demonstrated that AMPK deletion induced a delay in tight junction reassembly and relocalization at the plasma membrane during calcium switch, leading to impairments in the establishment of TEER and paracellular permeability. We also showed that 991-induced AMPK activation accelerated the reassembly and reorganization of tight junctions, improved the development of TEER and paracellular permeability after calcium switch. Thus, our results show that AMPK activation ensures a better recovery of epithelial   following injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31510101>Microbiota, Microbial Metabolites, and   in A Patient with Anorexia Nervosa after Fecal Microbiota Transplantation.</a></h2><p>The change in the gut microbiome and microbial metabolites in a patient suffering from severe and enduring anorexia nervosa (AN) and diagnosed with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth syndrome (SIBO) was investigated.

Very low bacterial alpha diversity, a lack of beneficial bacteria, together with a great abundance of fungal species were observed in the patient stool sample before FMT. After FMT, both bacterial species richness and gut microbiome evenness increased in the patient, while the fungal alpha diversity decreased. The total short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) levels (molecules presenting an important source of energy for epithelial gut cells) gradually increased after FMT. Contrarily, one of the most abundant intestinal neurotransmitters, serotonin, tended to decrease throughout the observation period. Overall, gut microbial dysbiosis improvement after FMT was considered. However, there were no signs of patient clinical improvement.

Utilizing a microfluidic device system, we studied the effect of various types of plasma on the endothelial   following T/HS.Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were cultured in microfluidic plates. The microfluidic plates were subjected to control or shock conditions (hypoxia/reoxygenation + epinephrine, 10 μM). Fresh plasma, 1 day thawed plasma, 5-day thawed plasma and lyophilized plasma were then added. Supplementation of sphingosine-1 phosphate (S-1P) was done in a subset of experiments. Effect on the endothelial glycocalyx was indexed by shedding of syndecan-1 and hyaluronic acid. Endothelial injury/activation was indexed by soluble thrombomodulin, tissue plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Vascular permeability determined by the ratio of angiopoietin- to angiopoietin-1. Concentration of S-1P and adiponectin in the different plasma groups was measured.Human umbilical vein endothelial cells exposed to shock conditions increased shedding of syndecan-1 and hyaluronic acid. Administration of the various types of plasma decreased shedding, except for 5-day thawed plasma. Shocked HUVEC cells demonstrated a profibrinolytic phenotype, this normalized with all plasma types except for 5-day thawed plasma. The concentration of S-1P was significantly less in the 5-day thawed plasma compared with the other plasma types. Addition of S-1P to 5-day thawed plasma returned the benefits lost with storage.A biomimetic model of the microcirculation following T/HS demonstrated endothelial glycocalyx and endothelial cellular injury/activation as well as a profibrinolytic phenotype. These effects were abrogated by all plasma products except the 5-day thawed plasma. Plasma thawed longer than 5 days had diminished S1-P concentrations.

Inhaled CeO NPs are known to cross the alveolar-capillary  and reach various parts of the body, including the vasculature. The anticancer drug cisplatin (CP) causes vascular damage. However, the effects CeO NPs on vascular homeostasis in a rat model of CP-induced vascular injury remain unclear. Here, we assessed the impact and underlying mechanism of pulmonary exposure to CeO NPs on aorta in rats given a single intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin (CP, 6 mg/kg) to induce vascular damage. Six days later, the rats were intratracheally instilled with either CeO NPs (1 mg/kg) or saline (control), and various variables were studied 24 h thereafter in the aortic tissue. The concentration of reduced glutathione and the activity of catalase were significantly increased in the CP + CeO NPs group compared with both the CP + saline and the CeO NPs groups. The activity of superoxide dismutase was significantly decreased in the CP + CeO NPs group compared with both the CP + saline and CeO NPs groups. The expression of nuclear factor erythroid-derived -like  (Nrf2) by the nuclei of smooth muscles and endocardial cells assessed by immunohistochemistry was significantly augmented in CeO NPs versus saline, in CP + saline versus saline, and in CP + CeO NPs versus CeO NPs. Moreover, the concentrations of total nitric oxide, lipid peroxidation and 8-hydroxy--deoxyguanosine were significantly elevated in the CP + CeO NPs group compared with both the CP + saline and the CeO NPs groups. Similarly, compared with both the CP + saline and CeO NPs groups, the combination of CP and CeO NPs significantly elevated the concentrations of interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor-α. Additionally, aortic DNA damage assessed by Comet assay was significantly increased in CeO NPs compared with saline, and in CP + saline versus saline, and all these effects were significantly aggravated by the combination of CP and CeO NPs. We conclude that pulmonary exposure to CeO NPs aggravates vascular toxicity in animal model of vascular injury through mechanisms involving oxidative stress, Nrf2 expression, inflammation and DNA damage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31566256>Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM): A chemical shift reference for  H MRS of human brain.</a></h2><p>We investigate the potential of a common dietary supplement, methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), to act as a chemical shift reference for in vivo  H MR spectroscopy (MRS). The scope of the investigation is -fold: (1) We use high-resolution nuclear MR (NMR) measurements of the chemical shift values of MSM to establish the stability of MSM resonance across the ranges of pH and temperature, and () we demonstrate MR properties of MSM in the healthy human brain.The relationship of chemical shift with temperature and pH is examined using high-resolution  H NMR (14.1T) spectra of MSM in aqueous solution. MSM concentration in human brain tissue was measured as a  of time, together with the relaxation properties in the brain using  H MRS at 3T.The chemical shift of MSM remains stable in the range of the biologically relevant temperatures and pH values. The chemical shift at pH = 7. and 37°C was measured to be 3.142 ppm (relative to DSS, a common water-soluble NMR reference compound). Time course in the brain tissue in vivo confirmed an observable MSM signal 10 minutes after oral intake and a stable signal intensity within a ~3-hour window.The chemical and biological properties of MSM-rapid crossing of the blood-brain , water solubility, a singlet resonance resolved from metabolite resonances, chemical shift stability with respect to pH/temperature, and stable temporal presence in the brain-lead us to propose its use as a frequency reference for MRS.© 2019 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31585052>Soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) regulates calcium signaling in the vascular endothelium.</a></h2><p>The vascular endothelium acts as a selective  between the bloodstream and extravascular tissues. Intracellular [Ca] signaling is essential for vasoactive agonist-induced stimulation of endothelial cells (ECs), typically including Ca release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Although it is known that interactions of Ca and cAMP as ubiquitous messengers are involved in this process, the individual contribution of cAMP-generating adenylyl cyclases (ACs), including the only soluble AC (sAC; ADCY10), remains less clear. Using life-cell microscopy and plate reader-based [Ca] measurements, we found that human immortalized ECs, primary aortic and cardiac microvascular ECs, and primary vascular smooth muscle cells treated with sAC-specific inhibitor KH7 or anti-sAC-small interfering RNA did not show endogenous or exogenous ATP-induced [Ca] elevation. Of note, a transmembrane AC (tmAC) inhibitor did not prevent ATP-induced [Ca] elevation in ECs. Moreover, l-phenylephrine-dependent constriction of  mouse aortic ring segments was also reduced by KH7. Analysis of the inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP) pathway revealed reduced IP receptor phosphorylation after KH7 application, which also prevented [Ca] elevation induced by IP receptor agonist adenophostin A. Our results suggest that sAC rather than tmAC controls the agonist-induced ER-dependent Ca response in ECs and may represent a treatment target in arterial hypertension and heart failure.-Mewes, M., Lenders, M., Stappers, F., Scharnetzki, D., Nedele, J., Fels, J., Wedlich-Söldner, R., Brand, S.-M., Schmitz, B., Brand, E.

We have executed new, comprehensive research on this vexing molecule via focal point analyses (FPA) to approach the ab initio limit of optimized geometric structures, relative energies, complete quartic force fields, and the entire reaction path for cis-trans isomerization. High-order coupled cluster theory was applied through the CCSDT(Q) and even CCSDTQ(P) levels, and CBS extrapolations were performed using cc-pVXZ (X = -6) basis sets. The cis isomer proves to be higher than trans by 0.52 kcal mol, but this energetic ordering is achieved only after the CCSDT(Q) milestone is reached; the  for cis → trans isomerization is a minute 0.27 kcal mol. The FPA central r(O-O) bond length of trans-HO is astonishingly long (1.670 Å), consistent with the semiexperimental r distance we extracted from microwave rotational constants of 10 isotopologues using FPA vibration-rotation interaction constants (α). The D(HO-O) dissociation energy converges to a mere .80 ± 0.25 kcal mol. Contrary to expectation for such a weakly bound system, vibrational perturbation theory performs remarkably well with the FPA anharmonic force fields, even for the torsional fundamental near 130 cm. Exact numerical procedures are applied to the potential energy  for the torsional reaction path to obtain energy levels, tunneling rates, and radiative lifetimes. The cis → trans isomerization occurs via tunneling with an inherent half-life of 1.4 × 10 s and 8.6 × 10 s for HO and DO, respectively, thus resolving the mystery of why the cis species has not been observed in previous experiments executed in dissipative environments that allow collisional cooling of the trans-HO product. In contrast, the pure ground eigenstate of the cis species in a vacuum is predicted to have a spontaneous radiative lifetime of about 1 h and 5 days for HO and DO, respectively.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31542929>Protective Effect of an Avocado Peel Polyphenolic Extract Rich in Proanthocyanidins on the Alterations of Colonic Homeostasis Induced by a High-Protein Diet.</a></h2><p>Avocado peel, a byproduct from the avocado pulp industry, is a promising source of polyphenolic compounds. We evaluated the effect of a proanthocyanidin-rich avocado peel polyphenol extract (AvPPE) on the composition and metabolic activity of human fecal microbiota cultured for 24 h in a bioreactor in the presence of high protein (HP) amounts and the effect of the resulting culture supernatants (CSs) on HT-29Glc and Caco- cells. AvPPE decreased the HP-induced production of ammonia, HS, propionate, and isovalerate and increased that of indole and butyrate. Microbiota composition was marginally affected by HP, whileAvPPE increased the microorganisms/abundance of phylum Actinobacteria, families Coriobacteriaceae and Ruminococcaceae, and genus . AvPPE failed to prevent the HP-induced decrease of HT-29Glc cell viability and energy efficiency but prevented the HP-induced alterations of   in Caco- cells. Additionally, the genotoxic effect of the CSs upon HT-29Glc was attenuated by AvPPE.

We previously demonstrated that H O -induced endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation and excessive NO production contribute to vascular cell injury and increases in microvessel permeability. However, the mechanisms of excessive NO-mediated vascular injury and hyperpermeability remain unknown. This study aims to examine the functional role of NO-derived peroxynitrite (ONOO ) in H O -induced vascular  dysfunction by elucidating the interrelationships between H O -induced NO, superoxide, ONOO , and changes in endothelial [Ca ] and microvessel permeability. Experiments were conducted on intact rat mesenteric venules. Microvessel permeability was determined by measuring hydraulic conductivity (Lp). Endothelial [Ca ] , NO, and O  were assessed with fluorescence imaging. Perfusion of vessels with H O (10 µmol/L) induced marked productions of NO and O  , resulting in extensive protein tyrosine nitration, a biomarker of ONOO . The formation of ONOO was abolished by inhibition of NOS with N -Methyl-L-arginine. Blocking NO production or scavenging ONOO by uric acid prevented H O -induced increases in endothelial [Ca ] and Lp. Additionally, the application of exogenous ONOO to microvessels induced delayed and progressive increases in endothelial [Ca ] and microvessel Lp, a pattern similar to that observed in H O -perfused vessels. Importantly, ONOO caused further activation of eNOS with amplified NO production. We conclude that the augmentation of NO-derived ONOO is essential for H O -induced endothelial Ca overload and progressively increased microvessel permeability, which is achieved by self-promoted amplifications of NO-dependent signaling cascades. This novel mechanism provides new insight into the reactive oxygen and/or reactive nitrogen species-mediated vascular dysfunction in cardiovascular diseases.© 2019 The Authors.

We aim to investigate the effects of vitamin D on intestinal injury in intestinal epithelial cells and organoids.Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce injury in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-18) and organoids, and the effect of vitamin D was assessed. Cell viability was measured and inflammation cytokines TNFα and IL-8 were quantified. FITC-dextran 4 kDa (FD4) permeability was measured using Transwell while tight junction markers were assessed by immunofluorescence staining in IEC-18 and intestinal organoids. Data were compared using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test.IEC-18 viability was decreased by LPS treatment, but was prevented by vitamin D. The upregulation of inflammation was inhibited by vitamin D, which also decreased epithelium permeability. Vitamin D restored tight junction ZO-1 and claudin . In addition, vitamin D decreased TNFα expression and prevented the disruption of ZO-1 in injured organoids.Vitamin D rescued epithelial   by improving permeability and restoring tight junctions, leading to decrease inflammation. This study confirms the protective effects of vitamin D, which could be used as a treatment strategy for infants at risk of developing intestinal injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31536448>Effects of Bread Yeast Cell Wall Beta-Glucans on Mice with Loperamide-Induced Constipation.</a></h2><p>Constipation is a common gastrointestinal disorder characterized by changes in intestinal habits. Increasing evidence indicates that long-term use of irritant laxatives causes serious side effects. Meanwhile, more than 50% of patients are dissatisfied with sense of use of non-prescriptional laxatives. -glucans are natural polysaccharides widely found in yeast, fungus, and plants, which have been reported to exhibit various pharmacological effects. The aim of this study was to characterize the effect of -glucans extracted from the bread yeast cell wall on loperamide-induced constipation mice. Forty mice were fed with loperamide (10 mg/kg) to make the constipation model and a diet supplemented with .5, 5, and 10 mg/kg -glucan. We assessed the defecation frequency, intestinal transit  of mice, as well as used high-throughput sequencing to analyze the intestinal microbiota composition and functional biological profiles data. Meanwhile, we detected expression of neurotransmitters including acetylcholinesterase, substance P, and serotonin (5-HT) and expression of tight junction protein (TJP) including zonula occludens-1 and mucin- in distal colon to characterize the possible molecular mechanisms. -glucans significantly enhanced intestinal motility and provided a possibility to regulate the expression of neurotransmitters and TJP in mice. The intestinal microecological portion of the treatment group partially recovered and was closer to the normal group. This study showed that -glucans can influence the intestinal microbiota and restore microecological balance to regulate the express of neurotransmitters and TJP to recover intestinal epithelial mechanical . We suggested that -glucans could be used as an active nutritional supplement to protect the damaged intestinal  and help patients who have constipation complications and dysbiosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628816>Hyperglycemia-induced Ubiquitination and Degradation of β-catenin with the Loss of Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 (PECAM-1) in Retinal Endothelial Cells.</a></h2><p>Increased retinal vascular permeability is one of the earliest manifestations of diabetic retinopathy.

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is an increasingly considered intervention, but the safety and long-term outcomes are uncertain. We reviewed prospectively collected data on patients with ESRD and chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing SG from 2011 to 2018. 198 patients with ESRD and 45 patients with CKD (stages 1-4) met NIH guidelines for bariatric surgery and underwent SG. 72% and 48% achieved a BMI ≤40 and ≤35, respectively. The mean percentages of total weight loss and excess weight loss were 18.9±10.8% and 38.±20.3%, respectively. SG reduced hypertension (HTN) (85.8% vs. 52.1%), decreased anti-hypertensive medications (1.6 vs. 1.0) (p<0.01 each), and reduced diabetes (59.6% vs. 32.5%, p<0.01). 45 of the 71 patients with ESRD that achieved a BMI ≤40 were waitlisted and received KT, while ten remain on the waitlist. Mortality rate after SG was 1.8 per 100 patient-years, compared to 7.3 for non-SG. Patients with stage 3a or 3b CKD exhibited improved GFR (43.5 vs. 58.4 ml/min, p=0.01). In conclusion, SG safely improves transplant candidacy while providing significant, sustainable effects on weight loss, reducing medical comorbidities and possibly improving renal  in Stage 3 patients.© 2019 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653054>Suppression of the Peripheral Immune System Limits the Central Immune Response Following Cuprizone-Feeding: Relevance to Modelling Multiple Sclerosis.</a></h2><p>Cuprizone (CPZ) preferentially affects oligodendrocytes (OLG), resulting in demyelination. To investigate whether central oligodendrocytosis and gliosis triggered an adaptive immune response, the impact of combining a standard (0.%) or low (0.1%) dose of ingested CPZ with disruption of the blood brain  (BBB), using pertussis toxin (PT), was assessed in mice. 0.% CPZ(±PT) for 5 weeks produced oligodendrocytosis, demyelination and gliosis  marked splenic atrophy (37%) and reduced levels of CD4 (44%) and CD8 (61%). Conversely, 0.1% CPZ(±PT) produced a similar oligodendrocytosis, demyelination and gliosis but a smaller reduction in splenic CD4 (11%) and CD8 (14%) levels and  splenic atrophy. Long-term feeding of 0.1% CPZ(±PT) for 12 weeks produced similar reductions in CD4 (27%) and CD8 (43%), as well as splenic atrophy (33%), as seen with 0.% CPZ(±PT) for 5 weeks. Collectively, these results suggest that 0.1% CPZ for 5 weeks may be a more promising model to study the 'inside-out' theory of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). However, neither CD4 nor CD8 were detected in the brain in CPZ±PT groups, indicating that CPZ-mediated suppression of peripheral immune organs is a major impediment to studying the 'inside-out' role of the adaptive immune system in this model over long time periods.

After a 4-8-week washout period, patients received another crossover treatment for 8 weeks. We assessed pulmonary , the 5-item version asthma control questionnaire (ACQ5), the asthma control test (ACT), and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment (week 8). As the primary outcome was change in force expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV) between baseline and week 8, we evaluated the incidence of asthma exacerbation and adherence  questionnaire (Ask-12) at week 8.Twenty-three patients were initially enrolled in this study; however, one patient had to be excluded. The FF/VI DPI treatment group showed a similar magnitude of change in FEV between baseline and week 8 as the BUD/FM DPI treatment group. In addition, there were no significant differences in pulmonary  tests, ACQ5 scores, ACT scores, and FeNO between baseline and week 8 in both groups. Although the incidence of exacerbation did not differ between groups, the Ask-12 score in the FF/VI DPI group was significantly lower than that in the BUD/FM DPI group.The present study indicates that once-daily FF/VI DPI is not inferior to twice-daily BUD/FM DPI in clinical effect and more likely to improve inconvenience and forgetfulness in inhalation adherence barriers for stable asthma control therapy. Once-daily FF/VI DPI may be an effective alternative for asthma maintenance treatment.© 2019 Furuhashi et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668565>Kidney transplantation after sleeve gastrectomy in the morbidly obese candidate: results of a -year experience.</a></h2><p>Morbid obesity serves as a  to kidney transplantation (KT) due to potential suboptimal posttransplant outcomes.

Exclusion criteria included type I diabetes and previous pancreas transplantation. NODAT was defined as a new insulin requirement after KT. Delayed graft  was defined as need for dialysis within the first week after KT. Mean posttransplant follow-up period was 22 months.Forty-one patients underwent KT after LSG after median time of 16 months. Median age of postLSG patients undergoing KT was 56.0 years at time of KT. Average body mass index decreased by 9 from the time of LSG to KT, and no patients regained weight at 1-year follow-up. After LSG, the number of patients with hypertension (85.4% versus 48.5%) and the number of antihypertensive medications used decreased significantly (1.6 versus .6) at time of KT (P < .001 each). At 1-year follow-up, the improvement in hypertension persisted (51.% versus 48.5%, P = nonsignificant). The average insulin regimen decreased from 33.0 ± 51.6 to 11.7 ± 21.5 units at KT (P < .001). This improvement also persisted at 1-year follow-up (11.9 versus 11.7 units, P = nonsignificant). Zero patients suffered NODAT over the follow-up period (versus institutional rate of NODAT at 15.8%). One patient developed delayed graft  (.4%, versus institutional rate of 13.3%). After 1 year postKT, there was 1 graft loss (.4%) and no mortality.This is the largest reported series of KT after planned LSG in morbidly obese patients.

In contrast to the well-characterized role of TJs in maintaining cerebrovascular integrity, the specific  of endothelial podosomes remains unknown. Intriguingly, we discovered cross-talk between podosomes and TJs in human brain endothelial cells. Tight junction scaffold proteins ZO-1 and ZO- localize at podosomes in response to phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate treatment. We found that both ZO proteins are essential for podosome formation and . Rather than being derived from new protein synthesis, podosomal ZO-1 and ZO- are relocated from a pre-existing pool found at the peripheral plasma membrane with enhanced physical interaction with cortactin, a known protein marker for podosomes. Sequestration of ZO proteins in podosomes weakens tight junction complex formation, leading to increased endothelial cell permeability. This effect can be further attenuated by podosome inhibitor PP2. Altogether, our data revealed a novel cellular  of podosomes, specifically, their ability to negatively regulate tight junction and endothelial  integrity, which have been linked to a variety of cerebrovascular diseases.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31540325>Succinate Modulates Intestinal   and Inflammation Response in Pigs.</a></h2><p>Succinate is a metabolic intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in all aerobic organisms, and is also a vital microbial metabolite in the gut. Although succinate is known to regulate intestinal metabolism and immune , its role in the protection of the intestinal epithelial   and inflammation is poorly characterized. In this study, we evaluated the effects of succinate on intestinal epithelial   and inflammation in pigs. Twenty-four growing pigs were distributed into three groups ( = 8) and received either a basal diet (control group) or the same diet supplemented with 0.1% succinate or 1% succinate. The diet supplemented with 1% succinate led to alterations in the intestinal morphology. We confirmed in vitro that 5 mM succinate treatment modulated intestinal epithelial permeability by increased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in intestinal porcine epithelial cell (IPEC)-J2 cells. Furthermore, succinate treatment increased the abundance of tight junction proteins claudin-1, zona occluden (ZO)-1, and ZO- in the jejunum in vivo and in vitro.

This variant was not in linkage disequilibrium with other TSLP variants in the longitudinal cohort (n = 741). White children with AD were less likely to have rs1898671 variant (odds ratio [OR], 1.41; 95% CI, 1.20-1.66) than Genome Aggregation Database controls. Children with AD and the rs1898671 variant during follow-up were more likely to have remission than children who were wild type for rs1898671 (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.26-1.91). In the second cohort (n = 585), the rs1898671 variant was less prevalent in those with AD than those without. The protective effect was greater in rs1898671 heterozygotes (OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.34-.75) than homozygotes (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.61-.70).TSLP and specifically rs1898671 are important in the pathogenesis of AD and could represent a potential clinical target for the development of therapies to treat individuals with AD.Copyright © 2019 American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

Three isonitrogenous and isolipidic experimental diets were formulated to contain 0 (FM), 40 (D.40) and 400 (D.400) mg kg daidzein, respectively. Fish fed D.400 had significantly lower growth performance than fish fed D.40. Dietary daidzein significantly increased the feed efficiency, while significantly decreased the feed intake. Daidzein supplementation increased the activity of total anti-oxidative capacity and the gene expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine transforming growth factor-β1, Mucin- and tight junction proteins (Tricellulin, Zonula occludens-1 transcript variant 1, Zonula occludens-1 transcript variant  and Claudin-like and Occludin), and down-regulated the gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α in the intestine of turbot. Dietary daidzein increased intestinal microbial diversities, the abundance of several short chain fatty acids producers, and decreased the abundance of some potential pathogenic bacteria. However, D.400 had dual effects on lactic acid bacteria and increased the abundance of potential harmful bacterium Prevotella copri. Collectively, dietary daidzein at the levels of 40 and 400 mg kg could enhance the intestinal mucosal   and alter the intestinal microbiota of turbot. However, high dose of daidzein must be treated with caution for its unclear effects on intestinal microbiota of turbot in the present study.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, the identification of an alternative donor with a lower risk of GVHD is important for patients lacking an HLA-identical sibling donor. To date, HLA studies of large cohorts of unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (UR-HSCT) have provided important and helpful information for donor selection. In UR-HSCT through Japan Marrow Donor Program, patient and donor HLA-A, -B, and -C, and HLA-DRB1 and -DQB1 double mismatches are significant risk factors for severe GVHD and mortality. HLA-DPB1 mismatch does not affect survival; however, it reduces the chances of leukemia relapse. In the analysis of a specific allele effect on transplant outcomes, HLA-C14:02 was significantly associated with an increased risk of severe acute GVHD. The development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled full-length HLA allele typing. Evolutionary analysis of the entire HLA-DPB1 revealed that a highly conserved region from exon 3 to 3'UTR provoked acute GVHD that was different from a T-cell epitope mismatching algorithm, reflecting exon  polymorphisms. Furthermore, a recent study demonstrated the importance of full-length NGS HLA typing on UR-HSCT outcomes. The usage of NGS may provide important information on the implications of the HLA genes in allogeneic stem cell transplantation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31472180>The protective effect of lithocholic acid on the intestinal epithelial  is mediated by the vitamin D receptor via a SIRT1/Nrf2 and NF-κB dependent mechanism in Caco- cells.</a></h2><p>Lithocholic acid (LCA) is both a secondary bile acid and a vitamin D receptor (VDR) ligand. The VDR is activated by 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D and plays an important role in maintaining integrity of the intestinal mucosal . LCA can also substitute for vitamin D to carry out the in vivo functions of vitamin D. However, it is unclear whether activation of the VDR by LCA affects mucosal  . In the present study, we researched the protective effect of LCA on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-induced intestinal epithelial  dysfunction in Caco- cells of the human epithelial intestinal adenocarcinoma cell line. Caco- cell monolayers were pretreated with LCA and then exposed to 100 ng/mL TNF-α. The results showed that LCA alleviated the decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance and the increase in FITC-Dextran flux induced by TNF-α. LCA ameliorated the TNF-α-induced decrease in protein expression and distribution of ZO-1, E-cadherin, Occludin, and Claudin-1, which are tight junction markers. Additionally, the LCA treatment effectively counteracted TNF-α-mediated downregulation of silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor  (Nrf2), and heme oxygenase-1, which are related to oxidative stress. Increases in NF-κB p-p65 and p-IκB-α induced by TNF-α were significantly inhibited by LCA. Considering all these, the present study indicates that LCA has a significant protective effect on TNF-α-induced injury of intestinal   through the VDR and suggests that suppressing NF-κB signaling and activating the SIRT1/Nrf2 pathway might be one of the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of LCA.Copyright © 2019.

We aimed to develop methods to isolate and expand human Tr1 cells and define their functions.We obtained blood samples and colon biopsy samples from patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis or healthy individuals (controls). CD4 T cells were isolated from blood samples and stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 beads, and Tr1 cells were purified by using an IL10 cytokine-capture assay and cell sorting. FOXP3-positive Treg cells were sorted as CD4CD25CD127 cells from unstimulated cells. Tr1 and FOXP3-positive Treg cells were expanded, and phenotypes and gene expression profiles were compared. T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 beads, and the suppressive abilities of Tr1 and FOXP3-positive Treg cells were measured. Human colon organoid cultures were established, cultured with supernatants from Tr1 or FOXP3-positive cells, and analyzed by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry.

Alteration of the intestinal  is associated with enhanced intestinal permeability and development of numerous pathological diseases including gastrointestinal and cardiometabolic diseases. Among the metabolites that play an important role within intestinal health, L Tryptophan (Trp) is one of the nine essential amino acids supplied by diet, whose metabolism appears as a key modulator of gut microbiota, with major impacts on physiological, and pathological pathways. Recently, emerging evidence showed that the Trp catabolism through one major enzyme indoleamine ,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) expressed by the host affects Trp metabolism by gut microbiota to generate indole metabolites, thereby altering gut  and health in mice and humans. In this mini review, I summarize the most recent advances concerning the role of Trp metabolism in host-microbiota cross-talk in health, and metabolic diseases.

We established a sepsis model by cecal ligation and perforation (CLP) in mice. Sepsis induced intestinal injury, as demonstrated by the disordered destruction of the morphology of the intestinal mucosa, time-dependent increases in Chiu's score (p < 0.05), significantly increased (p < 0.05) plasma concentrations of determination of the levels of diamine oxidase (DAO) and intestinal fatty acid-binding protein  (FABP2), and time-dependent downregulation of the expression of AQP3 and occluding (p < 0.05). While the administration of oral glycerol partially ameliorated the sepsis-induced injury of the intestinal mucosa, as shown by the partial recovery of the morphological structure, with decreased Chiu's score, decreased plasma concentrations of DAO and intestinal-type FABP2, upregulated expression of occludin and decreased mortality rate (Sepsis vs. Sepsis + Glycerol, p < 0.05). The results showed that the expression levels of AQP3 and occludin were downregulated after septic intestinal injury, while treatment with glycerol, which acts as a substitute for AQP3, partly ameliorated intestinal injury and improved the survival rate.

We hypothesized that angiopoietin- (Angpt-), antagonist of the endothelium-stabilizing receptor Tie2, induces a rapid loss of the eGC in human sepsis. Using intravital microscopy, we measured the perfused boundary region (PBR), an inverse parameter of eGC dimensions in sublingual microvessels, in patients with sepsis and age-matched nonseptic subjects. Median PBR values were significantly higher in patients compared with controls and correlated with serum Angpt- levels. To transfer and further explore these findings in a cell culture system, we exposed endothelial cells (ECs) to serum (5%) from a subgroup of septic patients and nonseptic controls. Confocal and atomic force microscopy revealed that sepsis serum, but not control serum, induced thinning of the eGC on human ECs in vitro, which correlated with paired PBR values obtained in vivo ( = 0.96,  < 0.01). Inhibition of Angpt- or Tie2 activation completely abolished eGC damage. Mechanistically, sepsis-induced eGC breakdown required the loss of its main constituent heparan sulfate; a result of heparan sulfate-specific enzyme heparanase, which was suppressed by Tie2 activation. Finally, Tie2 activation, but not Angpt- inhibition, initiated after septic or enzymatic damage provoked rapid refurbishment of the eGC. Our data indicate that eGC breakdown in human sepsis is mediated via Tie2 deactivation by Angpt-. Activation of Tie2 seems to accelerate recovery of the eGC and might hold promise as a therapeutic target in human sepsis.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31435172>Beneficial effects of nutritional supplements on intestinal epithelial  functions in experimental colitis models .</a></h2><p>Acute and chronic colitis affect a huge proportion of the population world-wide. The etiology of colitis cases can be manifold, and diet can significantly affect onset and outcome of colitis. While many forms of acute colitis are easily treatable, chronic forms of colitis such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (summarized as inflammatory bowel diseases) are multifactorial with poorly understood pathogenesis. Inflammatory bowel diseases are characterized by exacerbated immune responses causing epithelial dysfunction and bacterial translocation.

Serine protease activities are tightly regulated by serine proteases such as kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) and serine protease inhibitors such as lympho-epithelial Kazal-type related inhibitor (LEKTI). For a better understating of diseases' pathogenesis, the regulation mechanism of serine proteases and the inhibitors' expression in epidermal keratinocytes must be clarified.To investigate the effects of the cytokines on the expression of LEKTI in epidermal keratinocytes.Normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) were stimulated with panels of inflammatory cytokines. The expression of serine protease inhibitors was analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR and ELISA. LEKTI expression in normal human skin and lesions from psoriasis or atopic dermatitis (AD) were analyzed by immunohistochemically and tape-stripping. Trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like serine protease activities in culture supernatants were measured by using specific substrates.TNF-α and IL-17A significantly induced the expression of LEKTI in NHEKs. The immunohistochemical and tape-stripping analysis revealed that psoriatic skin lesions had higher LEKTI expression compared to normal skin and AD lesions. Trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like protease activities in the culture media were upregulated 3-5 days later but attenuated 6-7 days later period by these cytokines.In epidermal keratinocytes, the Th1&Th17 cytokines TNF-α and IL-17A induce the expression of serine protease inhibitor LEKTI, and it might occur to suppress the increase in the serine protease activities under inflammation.Copyright © 2019 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology.

TRPV4 expressed in the skin area contributes to several skin functions as a  to maintain internal body  and a transporter of external stimuli. The skin condition such as skin temperature and osmolarity varies with internal and external changes, and may influence the activity of TRPV4 contributing to skin , thermal sensation, and thermoregulation. However, the combination effect of skin conditions such as temperature and osmolarity on the activity of TRPV4 has not been examined. In the current study, we investigated the effect of temporal adaptation (5-10 min) to different temperature (25-35 °C) and osmolarity (250-350 mOsm) conditions on the heat response (until 40 °C) of human TRPV4 in cultured cells using Ca imaging. The temperature to activate TRPV4 increased with elevation of the adaptation temperature, and decreased with the adaptation to hypoosmolarity in the range of 25-35 °C. In addition, the heat response was inhibited with the adaptation to hyperosmolarity in the range of 25-35 °C. Thus, we demonstrated that the activation temperature of TRPV4 varied with the temporal sensory adaptation to different temperature and osmolarity conditions. These findings may contribute to gaining better understanding of the variation in several TRPV4-mediated skin functions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

To model  of such compounds from apparent permeabilities () across filter-grown Caco- cell monolayers, it is central to elucidate the intestinal permeation mechanism(s) of the compound. The present study aims to refine a computational permeability model to investigate the relative contribution of paracellular and transcellular routes to the  across Caco- monolayers of the permeability-limited compound acamprosate having a bioavailability of ∼11%. The  values of acamprosate and of several paracellular marker molecules were measured. These  values were used to refine system-specific parameters of the Caco- monolayers, that is, paracellular pore radius, pore capacity, and potential drop. The refined parameters were subsequently used as an input in modeling the permeability () of the tested compounds using mathematical models collected from two published permeability models. The experimental data show that acamprosate  across Caco- monolayers is low and similar in both transport directions. The obtained acamprosate , 1.56 ± 0.28 × 10 cm·s, is similar to the  of molecular markers for paracellular permeability, namely, mannitol (.72 ± 0.24 × 10 cm·s), lucifer yellow (1.80 ± 0.35 × 10 cm·s), and fluorescein (.10 ± 0.28 × 10 cm·s), and lower than that of atenolol (7.32 ± 0.60 × 10 cm·s; mean ± SEM,  = 3-6), while the end-point amount of acamprosate internalized by the cell monolayer, , was lower than that of mannitol.

With regard to the gastrointestinal functions, orexin acts centrally to regulate gastric secretion, gastrointestinal motility and visceral sensation. Little is however known about a role of central orexin in the control of intestinal  . The present study was performed to clarify whether brain orexin plays a role in the control of intestinal permeability. Colonic permeability was estimated in vivo by quantifying the absorbed Evans blue in colonic tissue in rats. Intracisternally administered orexin-A but not orexin-B dose-dependently blocked the increased intestinal permeability by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or corticotropin-releasing factor while intraperitoneally injected orexin-A failed to block it. Atropine or vagotomy abolished the action by central orexin-A. Intravenous injection of -deoxy-D-glucose (-DG), a central vagal stimulant, significantly blocked the LPS-induced increase in intestinal permeability and atropine prevented the action of -DG. Intracisternal injection of SB-334687, a selective orexin 1 receptor antagonist, significantly blocked the action of -DG-induced improvement of intestinal hyperpermeability. These results suggest that exogenously administered or endogenously released orexin acts centrally to improve the intestinal hyperpermeability by LPS via the vagal cholinergic pathway. The findings also suggest for the first time that the brain could control intestinal permeability. The neuronal rapid protective advantage to the host by improving the intestinal   by the neuropeptide may help us understand the brain-gut interaction in stress sensitive gastrointestinal disorders like irritable bowel syndrome associated with the altered intestinal permeability.Copyright © 2019.

Production of IL-33 and soluble ST2 (sST2), a decoy receptor for IL-33, has been implicated in several pulmonary diseases, but both have been scarcely investigated in pleural diseases. The aim of this study was to determine the levels of IL-33 and sST2 in transudative (TrPEs), malignant (MPEs), and parapneumonic (PPEs) pleural effusions (PEs) and investigate the effect of PE fluids from each group with low and high IL-33/sST2 levels on MeT-5A cell adhesion and migration. IL-33 and sST2 pleural fluid levels were similar among TrPEs, MPEs, and PPEs. However, a significant correlation was found between IL-33 and LDH and in sST2 levels with lymphocyte counts in TrPEs. Additionally, in MPEs the levels of IL-33 correlated with the levels of sST2 and with the red blood cell counts. Furthermore, incubation of MeT-5A cells with MPEs and PPEs bearing low or high levels of IL-33/sST2 yielded significant differential effects on MeT-5A cell adhesion and migration. In MPEs, high IL-33/sST2 levels led to increased adhesion and migration of MeT-5A cells, while in PPEs the effect was the opposite, while no effect in both cell phenotypes was determined for TrPEs. These results reveal a clinical context dependent effect of the IL-33/sST2 axis in PEs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31553035>Quantifying the effects of engineered nanomaterials on endothelial cell architecture and vascular  integrity using a cell pair model.</a></h2><p>Engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) are increasingly used in consumer products due to their unique physicochemical properties, but the specific hazards they pose to the structural and functional integrity of endothelial barriers remain elusive. When assessing the effects of ENMs on vascular  , endothelial cell monolayers are commonly used as in vitro models. Monolayer models, however, do not offer a granular understanding of how the structure- relationships between endothelial cells and tissues are disrupted due to ENM exposure. To address this issue, we developed a micropatterned endothelial cell pair model to quantitatively evaluate the effects of 10 ENMs (8 metal/metal oxides and  organic ENMs) on multiple cellular parameters and determine how these parameters correlate to changes in vascular  . This minimalistic approach showed concerted changes in endothelial cell morphology, intercellular junction formation, and cytoskeletal organization due to ENM exposure, which were then quantified and compared to unexposed pairs using a "similarity scoring" method. Using the cell pair model, this study revealed dose-dependent changes in actin organization and adherens junction formation following exposure to representative ENMs (Ag, TiO2 and cellulose nanocrystals), which exhibited trends that correlate with changes in tissue permeability measured using an endothelial monolayer assay. Together, these results demonstrate that we can quantitatively evaluate changes in endothelial architecture emergent from nucleo-cytoskeletal network remodeling using micropatterned cell pairs. The endothelial pair model therefore presents potential applicability as a standardized assay for systematically screening ENMs and other test agents for their cellular-level structural effects on vascular barriers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626364>Neurochemical regulation of the expression and  of glial fibrillary acidic protein in astrocytes.</a></h2><p>Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a type III intermediate filament, is a marker of mature astrocytes. The expression of GFAP gene is regulated by many transcription factors (TFs), mainly Janus kinase-/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 cascade and nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cell signaling. GFAP expression is also modulated by protein kinase and other signaling molecules that are elicited by neuronal activity and hormones. Abnormal expression of GFAP proteins occurs in neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, brain edema-eliciting diseases, traumatic brain injury, psychiatric disorders and others. GFAP, mainly in α-isoform, is the major component of cytoskeleton and the scaffold of astrocytes, which is essential for the maintenance of astrocytic structure and shape. GFAP also has highly morphological plasticity because of its quick changes in assembling and polymerizing states in response to environmental challenges. This plasticity and its corresponding cellular morphological changes endow astrocytes the functions of physical  between adjacent neurons and stabilizer of extracellular environment. Moreover, GFAP colocalizes and even molecularly associates with many functional molecules. This feature allows GFAP to  as a platform for direct interactions between different molecules. Last, GFAP involves transportation and localization of other functional proteins and thus serves as a protein transport guide in astrocytes. This guiding role of GFAP involves an elastic retraction and extension cytoskeletal network that couples with GFAP reassembling, transporting, and membrane protein recycling machinery. This paper reviews our current understanding of the expression and functions of GFAP as well as their regulation.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653704>Intestinal breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) requires Janus kinase 3 activity for drug efflux and  functions  in obesity.</a></h2><p>Breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) is a member of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins whose primary  is to efflux substrates bound to the plasma membrane. Impaired intestinal  functions play a major role in chronic low-grade inflammation (CLGI)-associated obesity, but the regulation of BCRP during obesity and its role in maintaining the intestinal   during CLGI-associated obesity are unknown. In the present study, using several approaches, including efflux assays, immunoprecipitation/-blotting/-histochemistry, paracellular permeability assay, fluorescence activated cell sorting, cytokine assay, and immunofluorescence microscopy, we report that obese individuals have compromised intestinal BCRP functions and that diet-induced obese mice recapitulate these outcomes. We demonstrate that the compromised BCRP functions during obesity are due to loss of Janus kinase 3 (JAK3)-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of BCRP. Our results indicate that JAK3-mediated phosphorylation of BCRP promotes its interactions with membrane-localized β-catenin essential not only for BCRP expression and surface localization, but also for the maintenance of BCRP-mediated intestinal drug efflux and  functions. We observed that reduced intestinal JAK3 expression during human obesity or JAK3 knockout in mouse or siRNA-mediated β-catenin knockdown in human intestinal epithelial cells all result in significant loss of intestinal BCRP expression and compromised colonic drug efflux and  functions. Our results uncover a mechanism of BCRP-mediated intestinal drug efflux and  functions and establish a role for BCRP in preventing CLGI-associated obesity both in humans and in mice.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31503404>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii-derived microbial anti-inflammatory molecule regulates intestinal integrity in diabetes mellitus mice via modulating tight junction protein expression.</a></h2><p>Impaired intestinal  structure and  have been validated as an important pathogenic process in type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Gut dysbiosis is thought to be the critical factor in diabetic intestinal pathogenesis. As the most abundant commensal bacteria, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F. prausnitzii) play important roles in gut homeostasis. The microbial anti-inflammatory molecule (MAM), an F. prausnitzii metabolite, has anti-inflammatory potential in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Thus, we aimed to explore the  and mechanism of MAM on the diabetic intestinal epithelium.16S high-throughput sequencing was used to analyze the gut microbiota of db/db mice (T2DM mouse model). We transfected a FLAG-tagged MAM plasmid into human colonic cells to explore the protein-protein interactions and observe cell monolayer permeability. For in vivo experiments, db/db mice were supplemented with recombinant His-tagged MAM protein from E. coli BL21 (DE3).The abundance of F. prausnitzii was downregulated in the gut microbiota of db/db mice. Immunoprecipitation (IP) and mass spectroscopy (MS) analyses revealed that MAM potentially interacts with proteins in the tight junction pathway, including zona occludens 1 (ZO-1). FLAG-tagged MAM plasmid transfection stabilized the cell permeability and increased ZO-1 expression in NCM460, Caco2, and HT-29 cells. The db/db mice supplemented with recombinant His-tagged MAM protein showed restored intestinal   and elevated ZO-1 expression.Our study shows that MAM from F. prausnitzii can restore the intestinal  structure and  in DM conditions via the regulation of the tight junction pathway and ZO-1 expression.© 2019 The Authors.

In chronic viral infections and cancer, where antigens can persistently stimulate the immune system, immune checkpoint molecules can serve as a  to effective immune responses. The role of immune checkpoint molecules in the setting of systemic low grade inflammatory such as Aging and ART-suppressed HIV infection is not known. In this study, we made use of stored samples from the FLORAH cohort of HIV-infected, ART suppressed adults (age range 19-77 yrs.) and age-matched HIV uninfected controls. We measured the expression levels of immune checkpoint molecules: PD-1, LAG-3, TIGIT, TIM-3, and 2B4 on resting CD4 and CD8 T cells and maturation subsets. To determine how expression of these molecules can affect T cell , we stimulated PBMC with HIV Gag or p09/H1N1 antigen and performed intracellular cytokine staining by multi-parameter flow cytometry. Immune checkpoint molecules were expressed at higher levels in CD8 compared to CD4. PD-1 was the only molecule that remained significantly higher in HIV-individuals compared to controls. LAG-3 expression increased with age in CD4 and CD8 T cells. 2B4 expression on CD8 T cells was negatively associated with IL- production but showed no effect on CD4 T cell . TIM-3 expression was negatively associated with IL-21 production in CD4 and CD8 T cells and also negatively correlated with flu vaccine responses in HIV negative individuals. Taken altogether, this study demonstrates the marked variation in immune checkpoint molecule expression in T cells among adults and sheds light on the biology of these molecules and their effects on antigen-specific T cell functions. Overall, our results point to TIM-3 as a potential biomarker for immune  in HIV+ individuals on ART.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31471680>Apolipoprotein E-mediated regulation of selenoprotein P transportation via exosomes.</a></h2><p>Selenoprotein P (SELENOP), secreted from the liver, functions as a selenium (Se) supplier to other tissues. In the brain, Se homeostasis is critical for physiological . Previous studies have reported that SELENOP co-localizes with the apolipoprotein E receptor  (ApoER2) along the blood-brain  (BBB). However, the mechanism underlying SELENOP transportation from hepatocytes to neuronal cells remains unclear. Here, we found that SELENOP was secreted from hepatocytes as an exosomal component protected from plasma kallikrein-mediated cleavage. SELENOP was interacted with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) through heparin-binding sites of SELENOP, and the interaction regulated the secretion of exosomal SELENOP. Using in vitro BBB model of transwell cell culture, exosomal SELENOP was found to supply Se to brain endothelial cells and neuronal cells, which synthesized selenoproteins by a process regulated by ApoE and ApoER2. The regulatory role of ApoE in SELENOP transport was also observed in vivo using ApoE mice. Exosomal SELENOP transport protected neuronal cells from amyloid β (Aβ)-induced cell death. Taken together, our results suggest a new delivery mechanism for Se to neuronal cells by exosomal SELENOP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31544834>David vs. Goliath: The Structure, , and Clinical Prospects of Antibody Fragments.</a></h2><p>Since the licensing of the first monoclonal antibody therapy in 1986, monoclonal antibodies have become the largest class of biopharmaceuticals with over 80 antibodies currently approved for a variety of disease indications. The development of smaller, antigen binding antibody fragments, derived from conventional antibodies or produced recombinantly, has been growing at a fast pace. Antibody fragments can be used on their own or linked to other molecules to generate numerous possibilities for bispecific, multi-specific, multimeric, or multifunctional molecules, and to achieve a variety of biological effects. They offer several advantages over full-length monoclonal antibodies, particularly a lower cost of goods, and because of their small size they can penetrate tissues, access challenging epitopes, and have potentially reduced immunogenicity. In this review, we will discuss the structure, production, and mechanism of action of EMA/FDA-approved fragments and of those in clinical and pre-clinical development. We will also discuss current topics of interest surrounding the potential use of antibody fragments for intracellular targeting and blood-brain  (BBB) penetration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31533100>Glutamine Blocks Interleukin-13-Induced Intestinal Epithelial  Dysfunction.</a></h2><p>Impaired intestinal epithelial   is a hallmark of a variety of pathological conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBD patients with IBS-like symptoms show higher interleukin-13 (IL-13) serum levels and poor psychological well-being. Supplementary glutamine reduced the daily bowel movement frequency, improved the stool form, and normalized intestinal hyperpermeability. This study was aimed at assessing the effects of IL-13 and supplementary glutamine on human intestinal epithelial  in vitro.Caco- cells were grown on TranswellTM inserts. -IL-13 was added to the basolateral compartment, and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled-dextran permeability measured. Effects of glutamine or the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 were assessed. Involvement of tight junction proteins was assessed using Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining.IL-13 significantly decreased TEER and increased FITC labeled-dextran epithelial permeability. IL-13 stimulation decreased the claudin-1 expression and increased the claudin- expression. Glutamine alleviated IL-13-induced decrease of TEER and increase of FITC labeled-dextran permeability. Further, the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitor showed this alleviating effect while the signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 inhibitor did not.IL-13 induced  integrity impairment by decreasing claudin-1 and increasing claudin-. Glutamine alleviated IL-13-induced  dysfunction by increasing claudin-1 expression, via disruption of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway.© 2019 S.

Although PARs are traditionally known to affect several vascular responses, recent investigations have started to pinpoint the functional role of PAR signaling in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This organ is exposed to the highest number of proteases, either from the gut lumen or from the mucosa. Luminal proteases include the host's digestive enzymes and the proteases released by the commensal microbiota, while mucosal proteases entail extravascular clotting factors and the enzymes released from resident and infiltrating immune cells. Active proteases and, in case of a disrupted gut , even entire microorganisms are capable to translocate the intestinal epithelium, particularly under inflammatory conditions. Especially PAR-1 and PAR-, expressed throughout the GI tract, impact gut permeability regulation, a major factor affecting intestinal  and metabolic inflammation. In addition, PARs are critically involved in the onset of inflammatory bowel diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, and tumor progression. Due to the number of proteases involved and the multiple cell types affected, selective regulation of intestinal PARs represents an interesting therapeutic strategy. The analysis of tissue/cell-specific knockout animal models will be of crucial importance to unravel the intrinsic complexity of this signaling network. Here, we provide an overview on the implication of PARs in intestinal permeability regulation under physiologic and disease conditions.© 2019 The Authors.

It is one of the most abundant free amino acids in many excitable tissues, including the brain, skeletal and cardiac muscles. Physiological actions of taurine are widespread and include regulation of plasma glucose levels, bile acid conjugation, detoxification, membrane stabilization, blood pressure regulation, osmoregulation, neurotransmission, and modulation of mitochondria  and cellular calcium levels. Taurine plays an important role in modulating glutamate and GABA neurotransmission and prevents excitotoxicity in vitro primarily through modulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis. Taurine supplementation prevents age-dependent decline of cognitive functions. Because of the wide spread actions of taurine, its levels are highly regulated through enzymatic biosynthesis or dietary intake. Furthermore, depletion of endogenous or dietary supplementation of exogenous taurine have been shown to induce wide spread actions on multiple organs. Cysteine sulfonic acid decarboxylase (CSAD) was first identified in the liver and is thought to be the rate-limiting enzyme in taurine biosynthesis. CSAD mRNA is expressed in the brain in astrocytes. Homozygous knockout mice lacking CSAD (CSAD-KO) have very reduced taurine content and show severe functional histopathology in the visual system, skeletal system, heart, pancreas and brain. Conversely, dietary supplementation of taurine results in significant health benefits acting through the same organ systems. Fluctuation of taurine bioavailability lead to changes in the expression levels of taurine transporters in neuronal plasma membranes, endothelial cells forming the blood-brain  and proximal cells of the kidneys. Suggesting a highly regulated mechanism for maintaining taurine homeostasis and organ systems . Here we show how alterations in taurine levels directly affect the  of one organ system and through functional interaction and compensatory adaptation; these effects extend to another organ systems with focus on the nervous system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31494143>Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of dexrazoxane on dopaminergic neuron degeneration in rodent models of Parkinson's disease.</a></h2><p>Emerging evidence has demonstrated that the integrity and the  of blood-brain  (BBB) are gradually impaired in the processes of aging and nervous system disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Parkinson's disease, PD). The leakage of BBB contributes to the infiltration of peripheral immune cells and harmful mediators into brain parenchyma, even the drugs that can not cross BBB under physiological conditions. Therefore, PD has been regarded as not only a neurodegenerative disease, but also a systemic disorder. In the present study, we demonstrate for the first time that Dexrazoxane (Dex), a drug clinically used to reduce doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in chemotherapy, can enter into midbrain and striatum through broken BBB in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)- and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced rodent models of PD. Unexpectedly, Dex (1.5, 5, 15 mg/kg, i.p.) administration for 3-week significantly ameliorates apomorphine-induced contralateral rotation behavior in 6-OHDA-treated rats and Dex (10 mg/kg, i.p.) treatment for 5-week improves MPTP-induced mouse motor dysfunctions. We find that Dex administration protects dopaminergic neurons against neurotoxin-induced degeneration in SNc, accompanied by the attenuated glial cell activation. Further study indicates that suppression of oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, as well as the inhibition of systemic inflammation in both peripheral tissues and brain, contribute to the neuroprotective effects of Dex in PD models. Our study implies that Dex may serve as an effective neuroprotectant to treat neurodegeneration and has potential clinical value in term of PD therapeutics.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

However, the effect of PF on intestinal   and its related mechanisms has not been identified. Here, we investigate the PF potential anti-inflammatory effect on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human Caco- cell monolayers and explore its underlying key molecular mechanism. In this context, PF significantly increased TEER value, decreased intestinal epithelium FITC-dextran flux permeability, and restored the expressions of occludin, ZO-1, and claudin5 in LPS-induced Caco- cell. In vitro, treatment of PF significantly inhibited LPS-induced expression of cyclooxygenase- (COX-), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). In addition, we found that PF suppressed nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling via activating the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathways in ILPS-stimulated Caco- cells.

A total of 432 1-day-old commercial broilers (Arbor Acre) were assigned to four experiment groups consisting of six replicates of 18 birds. The treatments were designed as follows: 85%, 100%, 125% and 150% of NRC (Nutrient requirements of poultry (9th edn). Washington, DC: The National Academies Press, 1994) recommendations. The results indicated that expressions of jejunal and ileal secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) mRNA were increased linearly or quadratically by increasing Thr (p < .05), and the highest sIgA mRNA abundance was obtained in 125% Thr level. Likewise, the intestinal sIgA content showed similar increasing trend with the intestinal sIgA gene expression in this instance. The high level of Thr inclusion upregulated mucin  (MUC2) mRNA expression in the jejunum and ileum (p < .05). In addition, on day 21, the expression levels of jejunal zonula occludens- (ZO-) and ileal zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) decreased then increased with increasing Thr level (p < .05), whereas, the mRNA expressions of occludin in the jejunum and ileum had no significant difference amongst groups (p >.05). On day 42, Thr treatments did not affect the mRNA abundance of measured genes in the jejunum and ileum (p > .05).

This study reports novel mechanisms through which a conductive Hf:ZnO (HZO) film by atomic layer deposition (ALD) can be integrated with a sprayed Ag NWs film to address the issues of Ag NWs. First, the ALD surface reactions can induce fusing of the Ag NWs into a connected network without the need for a thermal sintering process. Second, the ALD process can in situ functionalize the Ag NWs to yield defect-free (in terms of blocking gas permeation) coverage of the ALD HZO over the entire nanowire surfaces, which also enhances the ALD-induced fusing of Ag NWs. The composite HZO/Ag NWs films exhibit low sheet resistance (15 Ω sq), low water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) (5.1 × 10 g m day), high optical transmission (92%), excellent flexibility (12.5 mm bending radius), high stability/durability (against an extensive set of degradation modes and photolithographic patterning processes), and low processing temperature (90 °C) and can be used in perovskite solar cells to obtain high power conversion efficiency (14.46%).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665089>Impact of Docetaxel on blood-brain   and formation of breast cancer brain metastases.</a></h2><p>Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequent malignant tumor in females and the 2nd most common cause of brain metastasis (BM), that are associated with a fatal prognosis. The increasing incidence from 10% up to 40% is due to more effective treatments of extracerebral sites with improved prognosis and increasing use of MRI in diagnostics. A frequently administered, potent chemotherapeutic group of drugs for BC treatment are taxanes usually used in the adjuvant and metastatic setting, which, however, have been suspected to be associated with a higher incidence of BM. The aim of our study was to experimentally analyze the impact of the taxane docetaxel (DTX) on brain metastasis formation, and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism.A monocentric patient cohort was analyzed to determine the association of taxane treatment and BM formation. To identify the specific impact of DTX, a murine brain metastatic model upon intracardial injection of breast cancer cells was conducted. To approach the functional mechanism, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and electron microscopy of mice as well as in-vitro transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and tracer permeability assays using brain endothelial cells (EC) were carried out. PCR-based, immunohistochemical and immunoblotting analyses with additional RNA sequencing of murine and human ECs were performed to explore the molecular mechanisms by DTX treatment.Taxane treatment was associated with an increased rate of BM formation in the patient cohort and the murine metastatic model. Functional studies did not show unequivocal alterations of blood-brain  properties upon DTX treatment in-vivo, but in-vitro assays revealed a temporary DTX-related  disruption. We found disturbance of tubulin structure and upregulation of tight junction marker claudin-5 in ECs. Furthermore, upregulation of several members of the tubulin family and downregulation of tetraspanin- in both, murine and human ECs, was induced.In summary, a higher incidence of BM was associated with prior taxane treatment in both a patient cohort and a murine mouse model. We could identify tubulin family members and tetraspanin- as potential contributors for the destabilization of the blood-brain .

This review focusses on: (1) current understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms of adenomyosis-related fibrogenesis, () transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)-dependent or TGF-β-independent mediators of fibrogenesis, and (3) the origin of fibrogenic myofibroblasts. We collected a literature search from PubMed and EMBASE database up to December 2018. First, causative factors of adenomyosis are classified into exogenous traumatic damage (surgical interventions, including curettage, normal delivery, or cesarean section) and endogenous traumatic damage (mechanical strain or myometrial hyperperistalsis). The mechanical forces and injury (microdehiscences) are fundamental regulators of cell behavior and central to our understanding of disease pathogenesis. Adenomyosis is characterized by abnormal response to injury and activation of myofibroblasts in the myometrium through altered   of the endometrial-myometrial junctional zone (EMJZ). Second, we summarize recent advances on the molecular mechanism of fibrosis. Two distinct populations of myofibroblasts, highly myogenic cells, and nonmyogenic cells arise possibly through the TGF-β-dependent and TGF-β-independent processes. TGF-β-independent mechanisms are still intriguing and far from clear. Third, the importance and implications of resident fibroblasts, bone-marrow stem cells-derived fibrocytes, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition-derived myofibroblasts in fibrosis remain uncertain. Finally, originally adenomyosis was believed to be the single entity, but this disorder is composed of multiple heterogeneous subtypes. Key mediators of fibrogenesis may vary widely and largely depend on adenomyosis subtype. In conclusion, both cyclic mechanical strain and EMJZ weakness (microdehiscences) may be a prerequisite for adenomyosis fibrogenesis through the mechanotransduction process. Since there are significant molecular variations among affected individuals, the approach to identify key mediators of fibrosis remains challenging.© 2019 S.

The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of RAS are altered in AD in relation to established CSF markers of disease pathology (lower Aβ42 and elevated tau) and CSF markers of capillary dysfunction. We studied 40 controls and 40 AD cases grouped according to a biomarker profile (i.e., AD cases t-tau>400 pg/mL, pTau >60 pg/mL, and Aβ42 <550 pg/mL). Angiotensin-II converting enyme-1 (ACE1) and ACE2 enzyme activity was measured using fluorogenic peptide substrates; sPDGFRβ and albumin level by sandwich ELISA and angiotensin-I (Ang-I), Ang-II, and Ang-(1-7) by direct ELISA. CSF Aβ42, total, and phosphorylated tau levels were previously measured by INNOTEST sandwich ELISA. CSF ACE1 activity was significantly elevated in AD (p = 0.008) and positively correlated with ACE2 in AD (r = 0.420, p = 0.007). CSF ACE1 weakly correlated with t-tau (r = 0.294, p = 0.066) and p-tau (r = 0.329, p = 0.038) but not with Aβ42 in the controls but not in AD.

In this work, a two-dimensional (2D) sandwich-like α-ZrP/polypyrrole (α-ZrP/PPy) material with a nanosheet structure is designed for the sulfur hosting. It is found that such a material can provide unique ion transfer channels for the rapid Li + ions transfer and thusly catalytically promote the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) conversion. Moreover, the α-ZrP nanosheet provides a true-chemical anchor for sulfur species while the PPy helps to build a physical  and form a conductive network for accelerating the electron transport and finally promoting the electrochemical performance. In addition, the moderate catalysis  and efficient true-sulfur-confinement effect of α-ZrP are confirmed by experiments as well as theoretical computations. As a result, α-ZrP/PPy@S cathode exhibits a highly reversible capacity of 727. mA·h·g -1 even at a high current density of 5 C, offering a novel cathode material for the high performance Li-S batteries.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Paracellular permeability is governed by intercellular tight-junctions (TJs). Zonulin is, to date, the only known physiological regulator of intestinal TJs. We used a zonulin transgenic mouse (Ztm) model characterized by increased small intestinal permeability to elucidate the role of a primary impaired gut  on microbiome composition and/or immune profile. Ztm exhibit an altered gene expression profile of TJs in the gut compared to wild-type mice (WT): Claudin-15, Claudin-5, Jam-3, and Myosin-1C are decreased in the male duodenum whereas Claudin-15, Claudin-7, and ZO- are reduced in the female colon. These results are compatible with loss of gut   and are paralleled by an altered microbiota composition with reduced abundance of the genus , known to have positive effects on gut  integrity and strengthening, and an increased abundance of the  genus, associated to low-grade inflammatory conditions. Immune profile analysis shows a subtly skewed distribution of immune cell subsets toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype with more IL-17 producing adaptive and innate-like T cells in Ztm. Interestingly, microbiota "normalization" involving the transfer of WT microbiota into Ztm, did not rescue the altered immune profile. Our data suggest that a primary impaired gut  causing an uncontrolled trafficking of microbial products leads to a latent pro-inflammatory status, with a skewed microbiota composition and immune profile that, in the presence of an environmental trigger, as we have previously described (1), might promote the onset of overt inflammation and an increased risk of chronic disease.Copyright © 2019 Miranda-Ribera, Ennamorati, Serena, Cetinbas, Lan, Sadreyev, Jain, Fasano and Fiorentino.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31584781>A Global Review on the Risk Factors and Management of Early Atopic Dermatitis in Children Ages 0 to  Years Old</a></h2><p>Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, relapsing skin disease starting typically in atopic-prone children between 3–6 months of age, with most children having developed AD by the age of 5 years. Intense itching leads to sleep disturbance, especially in younger children and toddlers. This review explores early intervention in infants and young children with AD by controlling skin   and inflammation at the earliest time point using a moisturizer and a proactive treatment.A working group of experienced clinicians managing pediatric populations with AD convened for a meeting. The panel reviewed the literature surrounding early intervention in infants and young children with AD and developed and discussed clinical questions aimed at optimizing clinical outcomes.Complex gene/immune system/environment interactions are involved in AD development. Epidermal  defects play a central role in the condition, with various studies showing impairment of skin   at birth may precede clinical AD. Dynamic changes take place in the amounts of skin lipids during infancy. Studies confirm that daily use of a moisturizer from birth onwards may offer benefits in improving skin   and possibly prevention of AD, especially in high-risk, atopic prone newborns. Plant-based moisturizers were shown to be safe and effective when applied in pediatric patients with AD and may provide a TCS-sparing effect while improving skin condition.Dry skin conditions during infancy may predict the subsequent development of AD. Consequently, emollient therapy from birth represents a feasible, safe, and effective approach for AD prevention. Therefore, parental education and the application of moisturizers are recommended as an integral part of AD prevention, treatment, and maintenance.

Mutations in members of the Norrin/β-catenin pathway contribute to inherited blinding disorders because of defective vascular development and dysfunctional blood-retina . Despite a vital role for endothelial β-catenin signaling in central nervous system health and disease, its contribution to central nervous system angiogenesis and its interactions with downstream signaling cascades remains incompletely understood. Approach and Results: Here, using genetically modified mouse models, we show that impaired endothelial β-catenin signaling caused hypovascularization of the postnatal retina and brain because of deficient endothelial cell proliferation and sprouting. Mosaic genetic analysis demonstrated that endothelial β-catenin promotes but is not required for tip cell formation. In addition, pharmacological treatment revealed that angiogenesis under conditions of inhibited Notch signaling depends upon endothelial β-catenin. Importantly, impaired endothelial β-catenin signaling abrogated the expression of the VEGFR (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor)- and VEGFR3 in brain microvessels but not in the lung endothelium.Our study identifies molecular crosstalk between the Wnt/β-catenin and the Notch and VEGF-A signaling pathways and strongly suggest that endothelial β-catenin signaling supports central nervous system angiogenesis by promoting endothelial cell sprouting, tip cell formation, and VEGF-A/VEGFR2 signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642795>Combined ischemic preconditioning and resveratrol improves blood-brain  breakdown via Hippo/YAP/TAZ signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to survey the treatment  of the activation of the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway by combined ischemic preconditioning (IPC) and resveratrol (RES) before brain ischemia/reperfusion improves blood-brain  (BBB) disruption in rats. Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were pretreated with 20 mg/kg RES and IPC and then subjected to  h of ischemia and 22 h of reperfusion.

The sever TBI model was constructed according to Feeney's enhanced gravitational forces of free falling. On days 1, 3, and 7 post-TBI, plasma diamine oxidase (DAO) and D-lactic acid levels were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Occludin expression in the intestinal epithelium was assessed by Western blot analysis. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to observe the morphological changes in the network structure of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) and change of enteric nervous system-ICC-smooth muscle cell (ENS-ICC-SMC). Immunofluorescence staining was used to detect changes in the network structure of the ICC.Compared with the NS group, occludin expression in the DCQD+LA group significantly increased on Day 1, 3, and 7 post-TBI (P<0.05 or P<0.01). The concentration of DAO significantly decreased in the LA, DCQD, and DCQD+LA groups on Day 3 and 7, whilst the D-lactate concentrations in the LA and ½ DCQD+LA groups decreased on Day 1 and 3 post-injury (P<0.05 or P<0.01). The NS group experienced a great damage on the ENS-ICC-SMC network morphology and ICC network structure, and all treatment groups had some improvements, among which the DCQD+LA group presented relatively intact network morphology.DCQD combined with LA treatment could effectively repair the intestinal mucosal  and improve GI motility in mice after TBI.

Access to the gut-liver-axis needs crossing of the mucus and gut-vascular . The role of β-adrenoreceptor-activation for both barriers has not been defined and is characterized here.Splanchnic β-adrenergic stimulation was achieved by chronic intraperitoneal application of isoproterenol via alzet-pump in vivo. The intestinal permeability and gut-vascular   was assessed in ileal loop experiments. The extravasation of predefined sizes of fluorescence isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran molecules in ileal microcirculation was evaluated by intravital confocal laser endomicroscopy in vivo. Mucus parameters thickness, goblet cell count and mucin-expression were assessed by stereomicroscopy, immunostaining and RNA-sequencing respectively. Ileal lamina propria (LP) as well as mesenteric lymph node mononuclear cells was assessed by FACS.Healthy mice lack translocation of 4 kDa-FITC-dextran from the small intestine to the liver, whereas isoproterenol-treated mice demonstrate pathological translocation (PBT). Mucus layer is reduced in thickness with loss of goblet-cells and mucin--staining and -expression in isoproterenol-treated animals under standardized gnotobiotic conditions. Isoproterenol disrupts the gut vascular  displaying Ileal extravasation of large-sized 70- and 150 kDa-FITC-dextran. This pathological endothelial permeability and accessibility induced by isoproterenol associates with an augmented expression of plasmalemmal-vesicle-associated-protein-1 in intestinal vessel. Ileal LP after isoproterenol treatment contains more CD11c+-dendritic cells (DC) with increased appearance of CCR7+ DC in mesenteric lymph nodes.Isoproterenol impairs the intestinal muco-epithelial and endothelial-vascular  promoting PBT to the liver.

We used Au forming a 1D alloy through diffusion (point nanoinclusion) and Mo forming thermodynamically stable layered MoSe nanosheets through the reaction with the BiSe. The Schottky  formed by the 1D and 2D nanoinclusions was characterized by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM).

The existence of the Schottky  was demonstrated at +120 meV for the Mo layer and -80 meV for the Au layer reflecting the formation of MoSe and Au/BiSe alloy, respectively. The results of both methods (KPFM and UPS) were in good agreement.

However, other oxime mechanisms (e.g. modulation of cholinergic or glutamatergic receptor) may be involved in the recovery. The main disadvantage of positively charged reactivators is their low ability to penetrate into the brain although crossing the blood brain  could be supported via increasing the dose of administered oxime. Thus, this study presents maximal tolerated doses (MTD) for marketed oximes (TMB-4, MMB-4, LüH-6, HI-6, -PAM) and the most promising K-oximes (K027, K048, K203) which can be used in OP therapy in the future. No signs of sarin intoxication were observed in mice treated with 100% MTD of HI-6 in contrast to those treated with atropine and only 5% LD of HI-6. 100% MTD of HI-6 resulted in levels of 500 μM and 12 μM in plasma and brain, respectively. This concentration is by a far margin safe with respect to direct effects on neuronal cell viability and, on the other hand, does not have any effects on central NMDA receptors or central nACh receptors. However, a weak antimuscarinic activity in case of LüH-6 and a weak peripheral antinicotinic action in case of TMB-4 and -PAM could be observed at their respective 100% MTD dose. These high doses, represented by MTD, are, however, irrelevant to clinical practice since they led to mild to moderate toxic side effects. Therefore, we conclude that clinically used doses of marketed oxime reactivators have no significant direct pharmacological effect on the tested receptors.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Type  diabetes (T2D) accounts for more than 90% of diabetic patients, mainly caused by environmental factors. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) exhibit several health benefits to the host including regulating glucose and lipid metabolism and improving oxidative stress and inflammatory response. However, the anti-diabetic mechanism of probiotics has not been elucidated clearly. In this study, the anti-diabetic effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus KLDS1.1003 and KLDS1.0901 on T2D mice were assessed. Oral administration of L. acidophilus KLDS1.1003 and KLDS1.0901 for 6 weeks significantly improved the epithelial  , which in turn lowered inflammation cytokines, including IL-8, TNF-α and IL-1β in liver and colon tissue, and prevented liver and colon tissue injuries to some extent. Additionally, L. acidophilus treatment regulated the expression genes that are related to glucose and lipid metabolism. The two tested strains down-regulated the expression of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), fatty acid synthase (FAS) and sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1c (SREBP-1c), and up-regulated the expression of protein kinase B (Akt). However, L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 is better for improving T2D than L. acidophilus KLDS1.1003. Further research showed that L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 supplementation could reshape gut microbiota, increasing short chain fatty acid-producing bacteria (Blautia, Roseburia and Anaerotruncus) and the level of SCFAs and decreasing the relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria such as Desulfovibrio, Alistipes and Bacteroides. Notably, L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 treatment restored the structure of gut microbiota similar to the control group. These findings suggested that L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 might be used as a new type of antidiabetic drug candidate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610857>Skin changes in the obese patient.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a worldwide major public health problem with an alarmingly increasing prevalence over the past  decades. The consequences of obesity in the skin are underestimated. In this paper, we review the effect of obesity on the skin, including how increased body mass index affects skin , skin , collagen structure, and wound healing. Obesity also affects sebaceous and sweat glands and causes circulatory and lymphatic changes. Common skin manifestations related to obesity include acanthosis nigricans, acrochordons, keratosis pilaris, striae distensae, cellulite, and plantar hyperkeratosis. Obesity has metabolic effects, such as causing hyperandrogenism and gout, which in turn are associated with cutaneous manifestations. Furthermore, obesity is associated with an increased incidence of bacterial and Candida skin infections, as well as onychomycosis, inflammatory skin diseases, and chronic dermatoses like hidradenitis suppurativa, psoriasis, and rosacea. The association between atopic dermatitis and obesity and the increased risk of skin cancer among obese patients is debatable. Obesity is also related to rare skin conditions and to premature hair graying. As physicians, understanding these clinical signs and the underlying systemic disorders will facilitate earlier diagnoses for better treatment and avoidance of sequelae.Copyright © 2019 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.

Because oxidative mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage has been linked to endothelial  disruption in other models of IR injury, here we used a fusion protein construct targeting the DNA repair 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase-1 (OGG1) to mitochondria (mtOGG1) to determine if enhanced repair of mtDNA damage attenuates endothelial  dysfunction after IR injury in a rat model of lung procurement after DCD.Lungs excised from donor rats 1 h after cardiac death were cold stored for  h after which they were perfused ex vivo in the absence and presence of mt-OGG1 or an inactive mt-OGG1 mutant. Lung endothelial   and mtDNA integrity were determined during and at the end of perfusion, respectively.Mitochondria-targeted OGG1 attenuated indices of lung endothelial dysfunction incurred after a 1h post-mortem period. Oxidative lung tissue mtDNA damage as well as accumulation of proinflammatory mtDNA fragments in lung perfusate, but not nuclear DNA fragments, also were reduced by mitochondria-targeted OGG1. A repair-deficient mt-OGG1 mutant failed to protect lungs from the adverse effects of DCD procurement.These findings suggest that endothelial  dysfunction in lungs procured after DCD is driven by mtDNA damage and point to strategies to enhance mtDNA repair in concert with EVLP as a means of alleviating DCD-related lung IR injury.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The effects of almond on the skin's lipid  and the appearance of wrinkles have not yet been elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of almond consumption on facial sebum production and wrinkles.This was a prospective, investigator-blinded, randomized controlled trial in which subjects consumed 20% of their daily energy consumption in either almonds or a calorie-matched snack for 16 weeks. This study was completed at the UC Davis Dermatology clinic. Participants were a volunteer sample of generally healthy postmenopausal females with Fitzpatrick skin types 1 and . A facial photograph and image analysis system was used to obtain standardized photographs and information on wrinkle width and severity at 0, 8, and 16 weeks. Measurements of transepidermal water loss and sebum production were also completed at 0, 8, and 16 weeks.Fifty healthy postmenopausal females were recruited, 31 participants were enrolled, and 28 completed the study. Under photographic analysis, the almond group had significantly decreased wrinkle severity and width compared with the control group at 16 weeks (p < .02). Changes in skin   were nonsignificant, measured by the transepidermal water loss (p = .65) between the almond and control groups relative to baseline after 16 weeks. No adverse effects were reported.Our study demonstrates that daily almond consumption may reduce wrinkle severity in postmenopausal females to potentially have natural antiaging benefits.© 2019 The Authors.

RD in these mice is not well-understood, and in this study, we sought to characterize further the RD phenotype and to gain mechanistic insights into the  of CXCR5 in the retina. CXCR5 and WT control mice were used. Fundus images demonstrated a significant ( < 0.001) increase of hypo-pigmented spots in the retina of aged CXCR5 mice compared with WT control mice. PAS staining indicated localization of deposits in the sub-retinal pigment epithelia (RPE) layer. AMD-associated proteins Cryab, amyloid beta, and C3d were detected within the RPE/sub-RPE tissues by immunofluorescence (IF). In addition, western blot analysis of COX-, Arg1, and VEGF-a revealed an increase in the signaling of these molecules within the RPE/choroid complex. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicated a drusen-like structure of sub-RPE deposits with an accumulation of vacuolated cellular debris. Loss of photoreceptors was detected by peanut lectin staining and was corroborated by a reduction in MAP2 signaling. Loss of blood-retinal  integrity was demonstrated by a reduction of ZO-1 expression. Inflammatory cells were detected in the sub-RPE space, with an increase in IBA-1 positive microglia cells on the surface of the RPE. Mass spectrometry analysis of CXCR5 mouse RPE/choroid proteins extracts, separated by SDS-page and incubated with autologous serum, identified autoantibodies against AMD-associated proteins: Cryaa, Cryab, and Anxa2.  evaluations in BV- cell culture indicated a significant increase in production of Arg-1 ( < 0.001) and COX- ( < 0.01) in the presence of anti-CXCR5 antibody when compared with Igg-treated control BV- cells stimulated with IL-4 and TNFα/IFNγ, respectively. Anti-CXCR5 antibody treatment without stimulating agents did not affect Arg-1 and COX- expression; this suggests that CXCR5 may have a regulatory role in microglia cells activation. These results indicate that with age, CXCR5 mice develop RD characterized by microglia dysfunction, increased production of CXCL13 in the RPE progressive photoreceptor, neuronal loss, and sub-RPE deposition of cellular debris, resulting in the production of immunogenic proteins and autoimmune-mediated RD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658783>Phenolic Profile and Antioxidant Activity of the Edible Tree Peony Flower and Underlying Mechanisms of Preventive Effect on HO-Induced Oxidative Damage in Caco- Cells.</a></h2><p>The entire phenolic profiles and antioxidant activities of different organs of the edible tree peony flowers ( (FDB)) were analyzed. HPLC-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Q-TOF-MS/MS) analyses of individual phenolic compounds revealed that the petal and stamen contained higher levels of flavonoid glycosides than other organs ( < 0.05). Kaempferol-3,7-di--glucoside was the dominant flavonoid in these two organs, however, the calyx and ovary contained higher contents of gallic acid derivatives than other organs ( < 0.05). Hexa--galloyl-glucose was the dominant species in the calyx and ovary. At the same concentration of total phenolic extract (TPE), the stamen had the highest protection effect on Caco- cell oxidative damage induced by HO.

An exciting development is the recent FDA approval of the first in an emerging class of CGRP-targeted drugs designed to prevent migraine. Yet despite this efficacy, there are some fundamental unanswered questions, such as  and  CGRP works in migraine. Preclinical data suggest that CGRP acts via both peripheral and central mechanisms. The relevance of peripheral sites is highlighted by the clinical efficacy of CGRP-blocking antibodies, even though they do not appreciably cross the blood-brain . The most likely sites of action are within the dura and trigeminal ganglia. Furthermore, it would be foolish to ignore perivascular actions in the dura since CGRP is the most potent vasodilatory peptide. Ultimately, the consequence of blocking CGRP or its receptor is reduced peripheral neural sensitization. Underlying their efficacy is the question of  the antibodies have such an excellent safety profile so far. This may be due to the presence of a second CGRP receptor and vesicular release of a large bolus of peptides. Finally, despite the promise of these drugs, there are unmet gaps because they do not work for all patients; so ? We can expect advances on several fronts, including CGRP receptor structures that may help development of centrally-acting antagonists, combinatorial treatments that integrate other therapies, and development of drugs that target other neuropeptides.

The basolateral Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC1) has been implicated in intestinal epithelial fluid secretion. Two patients with deleterious heterozygous (NKCC1-DFX) or homozygous (Kilquist) mutations in SLC12A2 (NKCC1) suffer from gastrointestinal deficits. Due to chronic infections, the colon and the small intestine of the NKCC1-DFX patient were surgically resected.To investigate how NKCC1 affects the integrity and  of the gut epithelia, we used a mouse model recapitulating the NKCC1-DFX patient mutation. Electron microscopy and immunostaining were used to analyze the integrity of the colonic mucus layers and immune cells infiltration. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed on the distal colon sections to measure bacteria translocation to the mucosa and submucosa. Citrobacter rodentium was used to measure mouse ability to clear enteric infection. Multiplex cytokine assay was used to analyze mouse inflammatory response to infection.We show that NKCC1-DFX expression causes defective goblet cells mucus granule exocytosis, leading to secretion of intact granules into the lumen of the large intestine. In addition, NKCC1-DFX colon submucosal glands secrete mucus that remained attached to the epithelium. Importantly, expression of the mutant NKCC1 or complete loss of NKCC1  leads to aggravated inflammatory response to Citrobacter rodentium infection. Compared to wild-type, NKCC1-DFX mice showed decreased expression of claudin-, a tight junction protein involved in paracellular Na and water transport and enteric infection clearance.Our data indicate that NKCC1-DFX impairs gut   by affecting mucus secretion and immune properties.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The protective role of ubiquitin E3 ligase A20 (A20) in colitis needs to be further elucidated. This study aimed to investigate whether A20 exogenous administration restored impaired intestinal permeability and inhibited T helper (Th) response in mice with colitis.The effect of A20 overexpression in colonic mucosa on epithelial   and T cell differentiation was evaluated in mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced chronic colitis.A20 rectal treatment alleviated DSS-induced chronic colitis and restored impaired intestinal permeability. Oral challenge with % DSS elicited a Th2-type response in mice with colitis, and A20 rectal treatment inhibited CD4 interleukin (IL)-4 T cell differentiation and proliferation. In addition, the RNA expressions of Th2-related costimulatory molecular T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain (TIM)-1 and IL-4 were suppressed, while thrombospondin (TSP)-1 and interferon (IFN)-γ expressions were upregulated, after A20 rectal administration.A20 rectal treatment restores impaired intestinal permeability and inhibits activated Th2 cell response in mice with colitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31484296>Presbyopia and Other Eye Conditions in Teachers in Ghana.</a></h2><p>The aim of this paper is to assess the eye health needs of school teachers in the Asutifi districts of Ghana. Presenting distance visual acuity was measured in each eye. Those with visual acuity of <6/12 in one or both eyes had subjective refraction. All underwent basic eye examination and near functional vision was assessed for teachers aged ≥35 years using the Near Activity Visual Questionnaire (NVAQ). Teachers with uncorrected presbyopia were given a near correction and NVAQ was assessed again at two weeks. Three hundred teachers were examined with mean (SD) age of 36.5 (9.7) years, 54.3% were male and 6.3% (95% CI: 3.8 to 9.8%) had a presenting acuity of <6/12 in one or both eyes. The estimated prevalence of moderate visual impairment was 0.7% (95% CI: 0.08 to .4%). Lens opacities (50%) and refractive error (18%) were the main causes of visual loss. Seventy-five out of 136 (55.1%, 95% CI: 46.6 to 63.4%) of teachers aged ≥35 years were presbyopic, 45.3% (95% CI: 36.9 to 53.7%) of whom had presbyopic correction. Lack of awareness was the major  to presbyopic correction. Median Rasch score for teachers given presbyopic correction ( = 39) decreased by 60.6% from 46.0 (IQR: 10.7 to 72.8) to 18.1 (IQR: 0 to 58.9) and overall satisfaction with near vision improved at follow up. Prevalence of presbyopia was high, and spectacles improved satisfaction with near vision.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31442372>Control of Edge/in-Plane Interactions toward Robust, Highly Proton Conductive Graphene Oxide Membranes.</a></h2><p>Graphene oxide (GO) membrane, bearing well-aligned interlayer nanochannels and well-defined physicochemical properties, promises fast proton transport. However, the deficiency of proton donor groups on the basal plane of GO and weak interlamellar interactions between the adjacent nanosheets often cause low proton conduction capability and poor water stability. Herein, we incorporate sulfonated graphene quantum dots (SGQD) into  GO membrane to solve the above dilemma  synergistically controlling the edge electrostatic interaction and in-plane π-π interaction of SGQD with GO nanosheets. SGQD with three different kinds of electron-withdrawing groups are employed to modulate the edge electrostatic interactions and improve the water swelling resistant property of GO membranes. Meanwhile, SGQD with abundant proton donor groups assemble on the sp domain of GO  in-plane π-π interaction and confer the GO membranes with low-energy- proton transport channels. As a result, the GO membrane achieves an enhanced proton conductivity of 324 mS cm, maximum power density of 161.6 mW cm, and superior water stability when immersed into water for one month. This study demonstrates a strategy for independent manipulation of conductive  and nonconductive  to fabricate high-performance proton exchange membranes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604823>No evidence of Gremlin1-mediated activation of VEGFR2 signalling in endothelial cells.</a></h2><p>Canonical Gremlin1 (GREM1) signaling involves binding to and sequestering bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) in the extracellular matrix, preventing the activation of cognate BMP receptor signaling. Exquisite temporospatial control of the GREM1-BMP interaction is required during development, and perturbation of this balance leads to abnormal limb formation and defective kidney development. In addition to inhibition of BMP signaling, several other noncanonical signaling modalities of GREM1 have been postulated. Some literature reports have suggested that GREM1 can bind to and activate vascular endothelial growth factor receptor- (VEGFR2) in endothelial cells, human kidney epithelial cells, and others. These reports suggest that the GREM1àVEGFR2 signaling can drive angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. We report here that, despite exhaustive attempts, we did not observe GREM1 activation of VEGFR2 in any of the cell lines reported by the above-mentioned studies. Incubation of endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) or human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with recombinant VEGF triggered a robust increase in VEGFR2 tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast, no VEGFR2 phosphorylation was detected when cells were incubated with recombinant GREM1 over a range of time points and concentrations. We also show that GREM1 does not interfere with VEGF-mediated VEGFR2 activation, suggesting that GREM1 does not bind with any great affinity to VEGFR2. Measurements of ECFC  integrity revealed that VEGF induces   disruption, but recombinant human GREM1 had no effect in this assay. We believe that these results provide an important clarification on the potential interaction between GREM1 and VEGFR2 in mammalian cells.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31534794>Endothelial Glycocalyx Shedding Occurs during Ex Vivo Lung Perfusion: A Pilot Study.</a></h2><p>Damage to the endothelium has been established as a key pathological process in lung transplantation and ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP), a new technology that provides a platform for the assessment of injured donor lungs. Damage to the lung endothelial glycocalyx, a structure that lines the endothelium and is integral to vascular  , has been associated with lung dysfunction. We hypothesised that endothelial glycocalyx shedding occurs during EVLP and aimed to establish a porcine model to investigate the mechanism underlying glycocalyx breakdown during EVLP.Concentrations of endothelial glycocalyx breakdown products, syndecan-1, hyaluronan, heparan sulphate, and CD44, were measured using the ELISA and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity by zymography in the perfusate of both human ( = 9) and porcine ( = 4) lungs undergoing EVLP. Porcine lungs underwent prolonged EVLP (up to 12 hours) with perfusion and ventilation parameters recorded hourly.During human EVLP, endothelial glycocalyx breakdown products in the perfusate increased over time. Increasing MMP- activity over time was positively correlated with levels of syndecan-1 ( = 0.886; =0.03) and hyaluronan ( = 0.943; =0.02). In the porcine EVLP model, hyaluronan was the only glycocalyx product detectable during EVLP (1 hr: 19 (13-84) vs 12 hr: 143 (109-264) ng/ml; =0.13). Porcine hyaluronan was associated with MMP-9 activity ( = 0.83; =0.02) and also with dynamic compliance ( = 0.57; =0.03).Endothelial glycocalyx products accumulate during both porcine and human EVLP, and this accumulation parallels an accumulation of matrix-degrading enzyme activity. Preliminary evidence in our porcine EVLP model suggests that shedding may be related to organ , thus warranting additional study.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31425857>Microcontainers for oral insulin delivery - In vitro studies of permeation enhancement.</a></h2><p>Oral delivery of peptides is challenging due to their low uptake through the small intestinal epithelium. Tight junctions, connecting the enterocytes, impede permeability, often necessitating the use of permeation enhancers in the formulation. Loading of peptide and permeation enhancer into micro-scale devices, such as microcontainers, can potentially confine the effective absorptive area through unidirectional release and thereby enhance absorption. This concept is investigated by in vitro permeation studies of insulin across Caco- cell and Caco-/HT29-MTX-E12 co-culture monolayers mimicking the intestinal absorption . The importance of proximity between the microcontainers and the  is assessed, by keeping the amounts of insulin and sodium caprate fixed throughout all experiments, while collectively orienting the unidirectional release towards the cell monolayers. Increasing the distance is observed to have a negative effect on insulin permeation matching a one-phase exponential decay , while no difference in insulin transport is observed between Caco- and co-culture monolayers. Although there are no signs of cytotoxicity caused by the microcontainer material, reversible cell deterioration, as a consequence of high local concentrations of sodium caprate, becomes evident upon qualitative assessment of the cell monolayers. These results both suggest a potential of increasing oral bioavailability of peptides by the use of microcontainers, while simultaneously visualising the ability of regaining monolayer integrity upon local permeation enhancer induced toxicity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The BBS is composed of 1,-dilauroyl--glycero-3-phosphocholine (DLPC) and 1,-dimyristoyl--glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) with an embedded model membrane protein, a gramicidin A (gA) channel. The calculated free energy difference for the transfer of a gA channel from DLPC (hydrophobic thickness ≈ 21.5 Å) to DMPC (hydrophobic thickness ≈ 25.5 Å) bilayers, Δ(DLPC → DMPC), is -. ± 0.7 kcal/mol. This value appears at odds with the traditional view that the hydrophobic length of the gA channel is ∼22 Å. To understand this discrepancy, we first note that recent MD simulations by different groups have shown that lipid bilayer thickness profiles in the vicinity of a gA channel differ qualitatively from the deformation profile predicted from continuum elastic bilayer models. Our MD simulations at low and high gA:lipid molar ratios and different membrane compositions indicate that the gA channel's effective hydrophobic length is ∼26 Å. Using this effective hydrophobic length, Δ(DLPC → DMPC) determined here is in excellent agreement with predictions based on continuum elastic models (-3.0 to -. kcal/mol) where the bilayer deformation energy is approximated as a harmonic  of the mismatch between the channel's effective hydrophobic length and the hydrophobic thickness of the bilayer. The free energy profile for gA in the BBS includes a  at the interface between the two bilayers which can be attributed to the line tension at the interface between two bilayers with different hydrophobic thicknesses. This observation implies that translation of a peptide between two different regions of a cell membrane (such as between the liquid ordered and disordered phases) may include effects of a  at the interface in addition to the relative free energies of the species far from the interface. The BBS allows for direct transfer free energy calculations between bilayers without a need of a reference medium, such as bulk water, and thus provides an efficient simulation protocol for the quantitative characterization of protein-lipid interactions at all-atom resolution.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31424195>Influence of Hydrolyzed Polyacrylamide Hydrogel Stiffness on Podocyte Morphology, Phenotype, and Mechanical Properties.</a></h2><p>Chronic kidney disease is characterized by a gradual decline in renal  that progresses toward end-stage renal disease. Podocytes are highly specialized glomerular epithelial cells which form with the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and capillary endothelium the glomerular filtration . GBM is an extracellular matrix (ECM) that acts as a mechanical support and provides biophysical signals that control normal podocytes behavior in the process of glomerular filtration. Thus, the ECM stiffness represents an essential characteristic that controls podocyte . Hydrolyzed Polyacrylamide (PAAm) hydrogels are smart polyelectrolyte materials. Their biophysical properties can be tuned as desired to mimic the natural ECM. Therefore, these hydrogels are investigated as new ECM-like constructs to engineer a podocyte-like basement membrane that forms with cultured human podocytes a functional glomerular-like filtration . Such ECM-like PAAm hydrogel construct will provide unique opportunity to reveal podocyte cell biological responses in an in vivo-like setting by controlling the physical properties of the PAAm membranes. In this work, Hydrolyzed PAAm scaffolds having different stiffness ranging between 0.6-44 kPa are prepared. The correlation between the hydrogel structural and mechanical properties and Podocyte morphology, elasticity, cytoskeleton reorganization, and podocin expression is evaluated. Results show that hydrolyzed PAAm hydrogels promote good cell adhesion and growth and are suitable materials for the development of future 3D smart scaffolds. In addition, the hydrogel properties can be easily modulated over a wide physiological range by controlling the cross-linker concentration. Finally, tuning the hydrogel properties is an effective strategy to control the cells .

Sixty newborn piglets were assigned to control and probiotic treatments, with three litters per treatment (ten piglets/litter). From days 1 to 20 of life, piglets were orally administered a placebo of 0.1% peptone or 1.0 ×  10 CFU L. plantarum 299v daily. Six piglets per treatment were sacrificed on day 20, and intestinal tissues (including duodenum, jejunum, ileum and colon) and the intestinal contents from colon segments were collected. The results demonstrated that piglets treated with L. plantarum 299v had a lower diarrhoea incidence than the controls. L. plantarum 299v administration significantly increased the ratio of the villus height to the crypt depth in the jejunum and ileum, as well as the mRNA expression of jejunal occludin and ileal zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1). The L. plantarum treatment also increased the mRNA abundance of porcine β-defensin  (pBD2) and pBD3 in the jejunum and ileum and of toll-like receptors (TLRs), such as TLR2, TLR4, TLR6 and TLR9 in the ileum, and significantly upregulated the mRNA abundances of ileal pBD1 and colonic TLR4. Additionally, the L. plantarum 299v treatment significantly changed the structure of the colonic microbiota, as evidenced by the obvious increases in the relative abundances of the phyla Firmicutes and Actinobacteria and of the genus Lactobacillus. Our findings indicate that L. plantarum 299v facilitates the gut health of suckling piglets, probably by improving the intestinal morphology and intestinal   and by modifying the structure of the gut microbiota.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31433211>Enteroids expressing a disease-associated mutant of EpCAM are a model for congenital tufting enteropathy.</a></h2><p>Congenital tufting enteropathy (CTE) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by severe intestinal failure in infancy and mutations in the epithelial cell adhesion molecule () gene. Previous studies of CTE in mice expressing mutant EpCAM show neonatal lethality. Hence, to study the cellular, molecular, and physiological alterations that result from EpCAM mutation, a tamoxifen-inducible mutant EpCAM enteroid model has been generated. The presence of mutant EpCAM in the model was confirmed at both mRNA and protein levels. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated the reduced expression of mutant EpCAM. Mutant enteroids had reduced budding potential as well as significantly decreased mRNA expression for epithelial lineage markers (), proliferation marker  and secretory pathway transcription factors (, . Significantly decreased numbers of Paneth and goblet cells were confirmed by staining. These findings were correlated with intestinal tissue from CTE patients and the mutant mice model that had significantly fewer Paneth and goblet cells than in healthy counterparts. FITC-dextran studies demonstrated significantly impaired   in monolayers derived from mutant enteroids compared with control monolayers. In conclusion, we have established an ex vivo CTE model. The role of EpCAM in the budding potential, differentiation, and   of enteroids is noted. Our study establishes new facets of EpCAM biology that will aid in understanding the pathophysiology of CTE and role of EpCAM in health and disease. Here, we develop a novel ex vivo enteroid model for congenital tufting enteropathy (CTE) based on epithelial cell adhesion molecule ( gene mutations found in patients. With this model we demonstrate the role of EpCAM in maintaining the functional homeostasis of the intestinal epithelium, including differentiation, proliferation, and  integrity.

This review provides a summary on the role of gut microbiota in various neurological disorders including neurotoxicity induced by environmental stressors such as drugs, environmental contaminants, and dietary factors. We propose that the gut microbiome remotely senses and regulates CNS signaling through the following mechanisms: 1) intestinal bacteria-mediated biotransformation of neurotoxicants that alters the neuro-reactivity of the parent compounds; ) altered production of neuro-reactive microbial metabolites following exposure to certain environmental stressors; 3) bi-directional communication within the gut-brain axis to alter the intestinal  integrity; and 4) regulation of mucosal immune . Distinct microbial metabolites may enter systemic circulation and epigenetically reprogram the expression of host genes in the CNS, regulating neuroinflammation, cell survival, or cell death. We will also review the current tools for the study of the gut-brain axis and provide some suggestions to move this field forward in the future.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The kinetics of QOOH radical decomposition and reaction with O have been determined as a  of temperature and pressure, using observations of OH radical production and decay following H-atom abstraction from tertiary-butyl hydroperoxide ((CH)COOH) by Cl atoms to produce QOOH (CH(CH)COOH) radicals. The kinetics of QOOH decomposition have been investigated as a  of temperature (251 to 298 K), and pressure (10 to 350 Torr), in helium and nitrogen bath gases, and those of the reaction between QOOH and O have been investigated as a  of temperature (251 to 304 K), and pressure (10 to 100 Torr) in He and N. Decomposition of the QOOH radicals was observed to display temperature and pressure dependence, with a  height for decomposition of (44.7 ± 4.0) kJ mol determined by master equation fitting to the experimental data. The rate coefficient for the reaction between QOOH and O was determined to be (5.6 ± 1.7) × 10 cm s at 298 K, with no significant dependence on pressure, and can be described by the Arrhenius parameters  = (7.3 ± 6.8) × 10 cm s and  = -(5.4 ± .1) kJ mol in the temperature range 251 to 304 K.

We have investigated here if (+)-catechin (CAT) and procyanidin B (PB), two main dietary polyphenols, protect the   of intestinal cells undergoing inflammatory stress. The cell model adopted consisted of co-cultured Caco- and HT29-MTX cells, while inflammatory conditions were mimicked through the incubation of epithelial cells with the conditioned medium of activated macrophages (MCM). The epithelial   was monitored through trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER), and ROS production was assessed with dichlorofluorescein, while the expression of tight-junctional proteins and signal transduction pathways were evaluated with Western blot. The results indicated that MCM produced significant oxidative stress, the activation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways, a decrease in occludin and ZO-1 expression, and an increase in claudin-7 (CL-7) expression, while TEER was markedly lowered. Neither CAT nor PB prevented oxidative stress, transduction pathways activation, ZO-1 suppression, or TEER decrease. However, PB prevented the decrease in occludin expression and both polyphenols produced a huge increase in CL-7 abundance. It is concluded that, under the conditions adopted, CAT and PB do not prevent inflammation-dependent impairment of the epithelial   of intestinal cell monolayers. However, the two compounds modify the expression of tight-junctional proteins and, in particular, markedly increase the expression of CL-7. These insights add to a better understanding of the potential biological activity of these major dietary flavan-3-ols at intestinal level.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31467330>Proteasome dysfunction in alveolar type  epithelial cells is associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome.</a></h2><p>Proteasomes are a critical component of quality control that regulate turnover of short-lived, unfolded, and misfolded proteins. Proteasome activity has been therapeutically targeted and considered as a treatment option for several chronic lung disorders including pulmonary fibrosis. Although pharmacologic inhibition of proteasome activity effectively prevents the transformation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, the effect on alveolar type  (AT2) epithelial cells is not clear. To address this knowledge gap, we generated a genetic model in which a proteasome subunit, RPT3, which promotes assembly of active 26S proteasome, was conditionally deleted in AT2 cells of mice. Partial deletion of RPT3 resulted in 26S proteasome dysfunction, leading to augmented cell stress and cell death. Acute loss of AT2 cells resulted in depletion of alveolar surfactant, disruption of the alveolar epithelial  and, ultimately, lethal acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This study underscores importance of proteasome  in maintenance of AT2 cell homeostasis and supports the need to further investigate the role of proteasome dysfunction in ARDS pathogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31550239>Epithelial membrane protein  governs transepithelial migration of neutrophils into the airspace.</a></h2><p>Whether respiratory epithelial cells regulate the final transit of extravasated neutrophils into the inflamed airspace or are a passive  is poorly understood. Alveolar epithelial type (AT)1 cells, best known for solute transport and gas exchange, have few established immune roles. Epithelial membrane protein (EMP), a tetraspan protein that promotes recruitment of integrins to lipid rafts, is highly expressed in AT1 cells, but has no known  in lung biology. Here, we show that Emp2-/- mice exhibit reduced neutrophil influx into the airspace after a wide range of inhaled exposures. During bacterial pneumonia, Emp2-/- mice had attenuated neutrophilic lung injury and improved survival. Bone marrow chimeras, intravital neutrophil labelling, and in vitro assays suggested that defective transepithelial migration of neutrophils into the alveolar lumen occurs in Emp2-/- lungs. Emp2-/- AT1 cells had dysregulated surface display of multiple adhesion molecules, associated with reduced raft abundance. Epithelial raft abundance was dependent upon putative cholesterol-binding motifs in EMP2, whereas EMP2 supported adhesion molecule display and neutrophil transmigration through suppression of caveolins. Taken together, we propose that EMP2-dependent membrane organization ensures proper display on AT1 cells of a suite of proteins required to instruct paracellular neutrophil traffic into the alveolus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622617>Control of the retinal local RAS by the RPE: An interface to systemic RAS activity.</a></h2><p>As many other organs, the retina has a local renin-angiotensin-system (RAS). All main elements of the RAS are active in the retina: renin, angiotensinogen, angiotensin-converting enzymes. The functional role of the intraretinal RAS is not fully understood. So far, histological and functional analysis point to a regulation of ganglion cell activity and maybe also of bipolar cell activity, but it is not clear how RAS contributes to retinal signal processing. In contrast to local RAS in other organs, the retinal RAS is clearly separated from the systemic RAS. The angiotensin- (AngII)/AngI ratio in the retina is different to that in the plasma. However, it appears that the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), that forms the outer blood/retina , is a major regulator of the retinal RAS by producing renin. Interestingly, comparable to the kidney, the renin production in the RPE is under control of the angiotensin- receptor type-1 (AT1). AT1 localizes to the basolateral membrane of the RPE and faces the blood side of the blood/retina . Increases in systemic AngII reduce renin production in the RPE and therefore decrease the intraretinal RAS activity. The relevance of the local RAS for retinal  remains unclear. Nevertheless, it is of fundamental significance to understand the pathology of systemically induced retinal diseases such as hypertension or diabetes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Healthy rats only for operation and no filament were selected as the sham operation control group. Rats in the cerebral infarction model group and the control group were given normal saline, and those in the edaravone low, medium and high dose groups were given edaravone 10, 15 and 20 mg/kg, respectively.

Despite decades of extensive research on understanding its underlying mechanism and developing the pharmacological treatment, very little is known about the biological alterations leading to epileptogenesis. Due to this gap, the currently available antiepileptic drug therapy is symptomatic in nature and is ineffective in 30% of the cases. Mounting evidences revealed the pathophysiological role of neuroinflammation in epilepsy which has shifted the focus of epilepsy researchers towards the development of neuroinflammation-targeted therapeutics for epilepsy management. Markedly increased expression of key inflammatory mediators in the brain and blood-brain  may affect neuronal  and excitability and thus may increase seizure susceptibility in preclinical and clinical settings. Cyclooxygenase- (COX-), an enzyme synthesizing the proinflammatory mediators, prostaglandins, has widely been reported to be induced during seizures and is considered to be a potential neurotherapeutic target for epilepsy management. However, the efficacy of such therapy involving COX- inhibition depends on various factors viz., therapeutic dose, time of administration, treatment duration, and selectivity of COX- inhibitors.

Here it is shown how sericin generates a water-exclusion zone that may facilitate antifouling behavior. Negatively charged microspheres were used to mimic the surface charge and hydrophobic domains in bacteria. Immersed in water, regenerated silk sericin formed a 100-µm-sized exclusion zone (for micron-size foulants), along with a proton gradient with a decrease of > pH-units. Thus, when in contact with sericin, water molecules near the surface restructure to form a physical exclusionary  that might prevent biofouling. The decreased pH turns the aqueous medium unviable for neutrophilic bacteria. Therefore, resistance to biofouling seems explainable, among other factors, on the basis of water-exclusionary phenomena.

Furthermore, we use an inducible replication fork  system to show that Fft3 has two distinct roles at blocked DNA replication forks. First, Fft3 is needed for the resection of nascent strands, and second, it is required to restart the blocked forks.

The structure and  of viral rhodopsins are unknown. We present functional characterization and high-resolution structure of an Organic Lake Phycodnavirus rhodopsin II (OLPVRII) of group . It forms a pentamer, with a symmetrical, bottle-like central channel with the narrow vestibule in the cytoplasmic part covered by a ring of 5 arginines, whereas 5 phenylalanines form a hydrophobic  in its exit. The proton donor E42 is placed in the helix B. The structure is unique among the known rhodopsins. Structural and functional data and molecular dynamics suggest that OLPVRII might be a light-gated pentameric ion channel analogous to pentameric ligand-gated ion channels, however, future patch clamp experiments should prove this directly. The data shed light on a fundamentally distinct branch of rhodopsins and may contribute to the understanding of virus-host interactions in ecologically important marine protists.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671075>SDR9C7 catalyzes critical dehydrogenation of acylceramides for skin  formation.</a></h2><p>The corneocyte lipid envelope composed of covalently bound ceramides and fatty acids is important to the integrity of the permeability  in the stratum corneum, and its absence is a prime structural defect in various skin diseases associated with defective skin  . SDR9C7 encodes a short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 9C member 7 (SDR9C7) recently found mutated in ichthyosis. In a patient with SDR9C7 mutation and a mouse Sdr9c7 knockout model we show loss of covalent binding of epidermal ceramides to protein, a structural fault in the . For reasons unresolved, protein binding requires lipoxygenase-catalyzed transformations of linoleic acid (18:) esterified in ω-O-acylceramides. In Sdr9c7-/- epidermis, quantitative LC-MS assays revealed almost complete loss of a species of ω-O-acylceramide esterified with linoleate-9,10-trans-epoxy-11E-13-ketone; other acylceramides related to the lipoxygenase pathway were in higher abundance. Recombinant SDR9C7 catalyzed NAD+-dependent dehydrogenation of linoleate 9,10-trans-epoxy-11E-13-alcohol to the corresponding 13-ketone, while ichthyosis mutants were inactive. We propose, therefore, that the critical requirement for lipoxygenases and SDR9C7 is in producing acylceramide containing the 9,10-epoxy-11E-13-ketone, a reactive moiety known for its non-enzymatic coupling to protein. This suggests a mechanism for coupling of ceramide to protein and provides important insights into skin  formation and pathogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31424755>Moisturizers.</a></h2><p>To discuss moisturizers of the skin, we need a brief discussion on the structure and  of the skin  and of the mechanism of maintaining water balance.  The stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the epidermis, is the primary physiologic  of the skin and is of critical importance in maintaining water balance.[1]  The role of water within the stratum corneum is pivotal to the maintenance of normal skin integrity and turnover.[] Water allows for increased flexibility of the tissues and is a crucial component of the enzymatic reactions responsible for cleavage of the corneodesmosomal connections between corneocytes during the desquamation processBelow a critical water concentration, the corneodesmosomal connections remain intact, which results in a build-up of corneocytes and the appearance of dry, flaky skin.[3]Copyright © 2019, StatPearls Publishing LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31566374>Ab Initio/Transition-State Theory Study of the Reactions of ĊH Species of Relevance to 1,3-Pentadiene, Part I: Potential Energy Surfaces, Thermochemistry, and High-Pressure Limiting Rate Constants.</a></h2><p>In this study, the reactions of ĊH radicals are theoretically investigated, with a particular emphasis on hydrogen atom addition reactions to 1,3-pentadiene (CH) to form ĊH radicals, although the subsequent isomerization and decomposition reactions of the ĊH radicals are also of direct relevance to the radicals formed from the pyrolysis and oxidation of species including pentene and cyclopentane. Moreover, H-atom abstraction reactions by hydrogen atoms from 1,3-pentadiene are also investigated. The geometries and frequencies of 63 potential energy surface (PES) minima and 88 transition states are optimized at the ωB97XD/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory. Spin-unrestricted open-shell single-point energies for all the species are calculated at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory with basis set corrections from MP2/aug-cc-pVXZ (where X = T and Q). A one-dimensional hindered rotor treatment is employed for torsional modes, with the M06-2X/6-311++G(D,P) method used to compute the potential energy as a  of the dihedral angle. The high-pressure limiting rate constants and the thermochemical properties for C species are calculated using the Master Equation System Solver (MESS) with conventional transition-state theory and comparisons made with existing available literature data. A hydrogen atom can add to the terminal carbon atom of 1,3-pentadiene to form the ,4-ĊH radical and/or the internal carbon atoms to form ,5-ĊH, 1,4-ĊH, and 1,3-ĊH radicals. Among the four entrance channels for Ḣ atom addition reactions, the formation of ,4-ĊH and 1,3-ĊH radicals is more exothermic in comparison to the other ĊH isomers (,5-ĊH, 1,4-ĊH) because of the resonantly stabilized allylic structure. Consequently, the formation of the former is generally dominant in terms of  heights. Ḣ atom addition reactions to 1,3-pentadiene are compared to available C-C alkenes and dienes, with external addition calculated to be kinetically favored over internal addition. However, the correlation between heats of formation and energy barriers for Ḣ atom addition to 1,-dienes is different from that for 1,3- and 1,4-dienes. Hydrogen atom addition and abstraction rate constants are also compared for 1,3-pentadiene, with addition found to be dominant. The subsequent unimolecular reactions on the ĊH PES are found to be highly complex with reactions taking place on a multiple-well multiple-channel PES. For clarity, the reaction mechanism and kinetics of each ĊH radical are discussed individually in terms of the computed enthalpy of the reaction and activation, the transition-state structure/reaction class, and also in terms of the combustion species for which the reactions are of potential importance. The reactions on the ĊH PES are divided into three reaction classes (H-shift isomerization, cycloaddition, and β-scission reactions), and the reactivity-structure-based estimation rules for energy barriers are derived for these three reaction classes and compared to literature results for alkyl radicals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676135>Molecular Mechanism for Gramicidin Dimerization and Dissociation in Bilayers of Different Thickness.</a></h2><p>Membrane protein functions can be altered by subtle changes in the host lipid bilayer physical properties. Gramicidin channels have emerged as a powerful system for elucidating the underlying mechanisms of membrane protein  regulation through changes in bilayer properties, which are reflected in the thermodynamic equilibrium distribution between nonconducting gramicidin monomers and conducting bilayer-spanning dimers. To improve our understanding of how subtle changes in bilayer thickness alter the gramicidin monomer and dimer distributions, we performed extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations and fluorescence-quenching experiments on gramicidin A (gA). The free-energy calculations predicted a nonlinear coupling between the bilayer thickness and channel formation. The energetic  inhibiting gA channel formation was sharply increased in the thickest bilayer (1,-dierucoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine). This prediction was corroborated by experimental results on gramicidin channel activity in bilayers of different thickness. To further explore the mechanism of channel formation, we performed extensive unbiased molecular dynamics simulations, which allowed us to observe spontaneous gA dimer formation in lipid bilayers. The simulations revealed structural rearrangements in the gA subunits and changes in lipid packing, as well as water reorganization, that occur during the dimerization process. Together, the simulations and experiments provide new, to our knowledge, insights into the process and mechanism of gramicidin channel formation, as a prototypical example of the bilayer regulation of membrane protein .Copyright © 2019 Biophysical Society.

This is the first phase /3 study conducted in Mainland China confirming the efficacy and safety of RDV + ritonavir-boosted danoprevir + ribavirin for 12 weeks in treatment-naïve noncirrhotic patients with genotype 1 infection in a large population.  In this multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase /3 trial (), we enrolled 424 treatment-naïve, noncirrhotic adult HCV genotype 1 patients. All patients were randomized at 3:1 ratio to receive a combination of RDV 200mg once daily plus ritonavir-boosted danoprevir 100mg/100mg twice daily and oral ribavirin 1000/1200mg/day (body weight <75/≥75 kg) ( = 318) or placebo ( = 106) for 12 weeks. The primary end-point was the rate of sustained virologic response 12 weeks after the end of treatment, and the safety was evaluated and compared between treatment and placebo groups.  The overall rate of sustained virological response at 12 weeks after treatment is 99% (306/309, 95%, CI: 97%-100%) under per protocol set analysis. All patients harboring baseline NS5A resistance-associated species in the treatment group (76/76, per protocol set) achieved sustained virological response at 12 weeks after treatment.

We have demonstrated that GGDPS inhibitors in multiple myeloma (MM) cells disrupt Rab geranylgeranylation, leading to inhibition of monoclonal protein trafficking, induction of the unfolded protein response pathway (UPR), and apoptosis. We have previously reported preclinical studies with the GGDPS inhibitor VSW1198, which is a mixture of homogeranyl/homoneryl triazole bisphosphonates. Additional structure- efforts have led to development of the -methylated derivatives RAM2093 (homogeranyl) and RAM2061 (homoneryl). As little is known regarding the impact of olefin stereochemistry on drug properties in vivo, we pursued additional preclinical evaluation of RAM2093 and RAM2061. In MM cell lines, both isomers induce activation of UPR/apoptotic markers in a concentration-dependent manner and with similar potency. Single-dose testing in CD-1 mice identified a maximum tolerated i.v. dose of 0.5 mg/kg for RAM2061 and 0.3 mg/kg for RAM2093. Liver toxicity was the primary  to dose escalation for both compounds. Disruption of geranylgeranylation in vivo was confirmed after multidose administration of either compound. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed plasma terminal half-lives of 29. ± 6 (RAM2061) and 22.1 ± 4 hours (RAM2093). Relative to RAM2061, RAM2093 levels were significantly higher in liver tissue but not in other tissues. Using MM.1S flank xenografts, we observed a significant reduction in tumor growth in mice treated with RAM2061 relative to controls. Collectively, these studies reveal olefin stereochemistry-dependent effects on GGDPS inhibitor biodistribution and confirm the in vivo efficacy of this novel therapeutic approach. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: These studies reveal olefin stereochemistry-dependent effects on the in vivo properties of two novel triazole bisphosphonate inhibitors of geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of this class of inhibitors for the treatment of multiple myeloma.Copyright © 2019 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562503>Dietary Spray-Dried Porcine Plasma Prevents Cognitive Decline in Senescent Mice and Reduces Neuroinflammation and Oxidative Stress.</a></h2><p>Aging is characterized by chronic, low-grade inflammation that correlates with cognitive decline. Dietary supplementation with spray-dried porcine plasma (SDP) reduces immune activation in rodent models of inflammation and aging.We investigated whether the anti-inflammatory properties of SDP could ameliorate age-related cognitive deterioration and preserve brain homeostasis in an aging mouse model of senescence.Male senescence-accelerated prone 8 (SAMP8) mice were used. In Experiment 1, cognitive performance (n = 10-14 mice/group) was analyzed by the novel object recognition test in -mo-old mice (2M group) and in mice fed a control diet or a diet supplemented with 8% SDP for  (4M-CTL, 4M-SDP groups) and 4 mo (6M-CTL, 6M-SDP groups). In Experiment , the permeability of the blood-brain  and junctional proteins in brain tissue was assessed, as well as synaptic density, oxidative stress markers, and inflammatory genes and proteins in mice from the 2M, 6M-CTL, and 6M-SDP groups (n = 5-11). Statistical analyses included one-factor ANOVA followed by Fisher's posthoc test.6M-SDP mice had better cognitive performance than 6M-CTL mice, in both short-term (P = 0.024) and long-term (P = 0.017) memory tests. In brain tissue, 6M-SDP mice showed reduced brain capillary permeability (P = 0.034) and increased ZO1 and E-cadherin expression (both P <0.04) compared with 6M-CTL mice. SDP also prevented the NFκB activation observed in 6M-CTL mice (P = 0.002) and reduced Il6 expression and hydrogen peroxide concentration (both P <0.03) observed in 6M-CTL mice. SDP also increased the concentration of IL10 (P = 0.027), an anti-inflammatory cytokine correlated with memory preservation.In senescent SAMP8 mice, dietary supplementation with SDP attenuated cognitive decline and prevented changes in brain markers of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644554>Acute normobaric hypoxia does not affect the simultaneous exercise-induced increase in circulating BDNF and GDNF in young healthy men: A feasibility study.</a></h2><p>Physical exercise has a neuromodulatory effect on the central nervous system (CNS) partially by modifying expression of neuropeptides produced and secreted by neurons and glial cells, among which the best examined are brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Because both neurotrophins can cross the brain-blood  (BBB), their blood levels indirectly reflect their production in the CNS. Moreover, both neuropeptides are involved in modulation of dopaminergic and serotoninergic system . Because limited information is available on the effects of exercise to volition exhaustion and acute hypoxia on CNS, BDNF and GDNF formation, the aims of the present study were to verify whether 1) acute exercise to exhaustion in addition to neurons also activates glial cells and ) additional exposure to acute normobaric moderate hypoxia affects their . In this feasibility study we measured blood concentrations of BDNF, GDNF, and neuropeptides considered as biomarkers of brain damage (bFGF, NGF, S100B, GFAP) in seven sedentary healthy young men who performed a graded exercise test to volitional exhaustion on a cycle ergometer under normoxic (N) and hypoxic conditions: ,000 m (H2; FiO2 = 16.6%) and 3,000 m altitude (H3; FiO2 = 14.7%). In all conditions serum concentrations of both BDNF and GDNF increased immediately after cessation of exercise (p<0.01). There was no effect of condition or interaction (condition x time of measurement) and exercise on any of the brain damage biomarkers: bFGF, NGF, S100B, GFAP. Moreover, in N (0<0.01) and H3 (p<0.05) exercise caused elevated serum 5-HT concentration. The results suggest that a graded effort to volitional exhaustion in normoxia, as well as hypoxia, simultaneously activates both neurons and astrocytes. Considering that s100B, GFAP, bFGF, and NGF (produced mainly by astrocytes) are markers of brain damage, it can be assumed that a maximum effort in both conditions is safe for the CNS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581897>The effect of angiopoietin-1 upregulation on the outcome of acute ischaemic stroke in rodent models: A meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Clinical studies report that low circulating angiopoietin-1 concentration at presentation predicts worse outcomes after ischaemic stroke. Upregulating angiopoietin-1 may therefore have therapeutic benefit for ischaemic stroke. This systematic review assessed whether upregulating angiopoietin-1 improved outcomes in rodent models of ischaemic stroke. Random-effects models quantified the effect of angiopoietin-1 upregulation on stroke severity in terms of the size of cerebral infarction and the extent of blood-brain  permeability. Eleven studies utilising rat and mouse models of ischaemic stroke fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses demonstrated that angiopoietin-1 upregulation significantly reduced cerebral infarction size (standardised mean difference: -3.02; 95% confidence intervals: -4.41, -1.63;  < 0.001;  = 171 animals) and improved blood-brain  integrity (standardized mean difference: -.02; 95% confidence intervals: -3.27, -0.77;  = 0.002;  = 129 animals). Subgroup analyses demonstrated that angiopoietin-1 upregulation improved outcomes in models of transient, not permanent cerebral ischaemia. Six studies assessed the effect of angiopoietin-1 upregulation on neurological ; however, inter-study heterogeneity prevented meta-analysis. In conclusion, published rodent data suggest that angiopoietin-1 upregulation improves outcome following temporary cerebral ischaemia by reducing cerebral infarction size and improving blood-brain  integrity. Additional research is required to examine the effect of angiopoietin-1 upregulation on neurological  during stroke recovery and investigate the benefit and risks in patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632373>Administration of  Ameliorates Dextran Sulfate Sodium-Induced Ulcerative Colitis in Mice.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) develop as a result of complex interactions among genes, innate immunity and environmental factors, which are related to the gut microbiota.

Decades of research have yielded thorough descriptions of these outcomes; however, less is known about the molecular processes that drive them. The aim of this study was to further describe the cellular and molecular responses to O3 exposure in murine airways, with a particular focus on transcriptional responses in two critical compartments: conducting airways (CA) and airway macrophages (AM). After exposing adult, female C57BL/6J mice to filtered air, 1 or  ppm O3, we assessed hallmark responses including airway inflammation (cell counts and cytokine secretion) and injury (epithelial permeability), followed by gene expression profiling of CA and AM by RNA-seq. As expected, we observed concentration-dependent increases in airway inflammation and injury. CA and AM both exhibited changes in gene expression to both 1 and  ppm O3 that were largely compartment-specific. In CA, genes associated with epithelial  , detoxification processes, and cellular proliferation were altered, while O3 affected genes involved in innate immune signaling, cytokine production, and extracellular matrix remodeling in AM. Further, CA and AM also exhibited notable differences in concentration-response expression patterns for large numbers of genes. Overall, our study has described transcriptional responses to acute O3 exposure, revealing both shared and unique gene expression patterns across multiple concentrations of O3 and in two important O3-responsive tissues. These profiles provide broad mechanistic insight into pulmonary O3 toxicity, and reveal a variety of targets for focused follow-up studies.© The Author(s) 2019.

Postnatally, astrocyte progenitors migrate to reach their brain area and related properties. They have a regulatory role of brain functions that are implicated in neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, controlling blood-brain  permeability and maintaining extracellular homeostasis. Mature astrocytes also express some genes enriched in cell progenitors, suggesting they can retain proliferative potential. Considering heterogeneity of cell population, it is not surprising that their disorders are related to a wide range of different neuro-pathologies. Brain diseases are characterized by the active inflammatory state of the astrocytes, which is usually described as up-regulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). In particular, the loss of astrocytes  as a result of cellular senescence could have implications for the neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer disease and Huntington disease, and for the aging brain. Astrocytes can also drive the induction and the progression of the inflammatory state due to their Ca signals and that it is strongly related to the disease severity/state. Moreover, they contribute to the altered neuronal activity in several frontal cortex pathologies such as ischemic stroke and epilepsy.

Overall, heat stress caused by high natural environment temperature may induce the damage to hepatic antioxidation and intestinal .Dietary inclusion of COAC can improve the tolerance of broilers to thermal environment through the modification of antioxidative parameters in liver and the mRNA expression of genes in intestinal , resulting in an optimal inclusion level of 0.4%.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562139>Lack of whey acidic protein four disulphide core (WFDC)  protease inhibitor causes neonatal death from respiratory failure in mice.</a></h2><p>Respiratory failure is a life-threatening problem for pre-term and term infants yet many causes remain unknown. Here, we present evidence that whey acidic protein (WAP) four-disulfide core domain protease inhibitor  (Wfdc2), a protease inhibitor previously unrecognized in respiratory disease, may be a causal factor in infant respiratory failure. Transcripts are detected in the embryonic lung and analysis of a  knock-in mouse line shows that both basal and club cells, and type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECIIs), express  neonatally. Null mutant mice display progressive atelectasis after birth with a lethal phenotype. Mutant lungs have multiple defects including impaired cilia and absence of mature club cells from the tracheo-bronchial airways and malformed lamellar bodies in AECIIs. RNA sequencing shows significant activation of a pro-inflammatory pathway, but with low-quantity infiltration of mononuclear cells in the lung. These data demonstrate that   is vitally important for lung aeration at birth and that gene deficiency likely causes failure of the lung mucosal .© 2019.

Endothelial cell β integrin receptors play a direct role in blood-brain  (BBB) dysfunction through regulation of tight junction proteins and infiltrating leukocytes, potentially mediated by β1 integrins. Following tandem transient common carotid artery/middle cerebral artery occlusion on wild-type mice, we administered the integrin a5b1 inhibitor, ATN-161, intraperitoneal (IP) injection at 1 mg/kg acutely after reperfusion, on post-stroke day (PSD)1 and PSD2. Systemic changes (heart rate, pulse distension, and body temperature) were determined. Additionally, infarct volume and edema were determined by ,3-triphenyltetrazolium chloride and magnetic resonance imaging, while neurological changes were evaluated using an 11-point Neuroscore. Brain immunohistochemistry was performed for claudin-5, α5β1, IgG, and CD45 + cells, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed for matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), interleukin (IL)-1β, collagen IV, and CXCL12. ATN-161 significantly reduced integrin α5β1 expression in the surrounding peri-infarct region with no systemic changes. Infarct volume, edema, and functional deficit were significantly reduced in ATN-161-treated mice. Furthermore, ATN-161 treatment reduced IgG extravasation into the parenchyma through conserved claudin-5, collagen IV, CXCL12 while reducing MMP-9 transcription. Additionally, IL-1β and CD45 + cells were reduced in the ipsilateral cortex following ATN-161 administration. Collectively, ATN-161 may be a promising novel stroke therapy by reducing post-stroke inflammation and BBB permeability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624315>A collagen gel-coated, aligned nanofiber membrane for enhanced endothelial  .</a></h2><p>Herein, a collagen gel-coated and aligned nanofiber membrane named Col-ANM is developed, which remarkably improves endothelial   by providing biochemical and topographical cues simultaneously. Col-ANM is fabricated by collagen gel coating process on an aligned polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofiber membrane, which is obtained by a simple electrospinning process adopting a parallel electrode collector. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured on Col-ANM exhibit remarkably enhanced endothelial   with high expression levels of intercellular junction proteins of ZO-1 and VE-cadherin, a high TEER, and a cellular permeability compared with the artificial porous membranes in commercial cell culture well inserts. The enhanced endothelial   is conjectured to be attributed to the synergistic effects of topographical and biochemical cues provided by the aligned PCL nanofibers and collagen gel in the Col-ANM, respectively. Finally, the reactive oxygen species is applied to the HUVEC monolayer formed on the Col-ANM to destroy the tight junctions between HUVECs. The destruction of the tight junctions is demonstrated by the decreased TEER value over time. Results indicate the potential of Col-ANM in modeling endothelial  dysfunction-related diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31552549>Neurofilament light chain in serum of adolescent and adult SMA patients under treatment with nusinersen.</a></h2><p>To determine the diagnostic and monitoring value of serum neurofilament light chain (NfL) in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).We measured serum NfL in 46 SMA patients at baseline and over 14 months of treatment with the antisense-oligonucleotide (ASO) nusinersen using the ultrasensitive single molecule array (Simoa) technology. Serum NfL levels of SMA patients were compared to controls and related to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) NfL, blood-CSF   quantified by the albumin blood/CSF ratio (Qalb) and motor scores (Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded, HFMSE; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised, ALSFRS-R).Serum NfL levels of SMA patients were in the range of controls (p = 0.316) and did not correlate with CSF NfL (ρ = 0.302, p = 0.142) or Qalb (ρ = - 0.160, p = 0.293). During therapy, serum NfL levels were relatively stable with notable concentration changes in single SMA patients, however, within the control range. Higher NfL levels were associated with worse motor performance in SMA (baseline: HFMSE ρ = - 0.330, p = 0.025, ALSFRS-R ρ = - 0.403, p = 0.005; after 10 months: HFMSE ρ = - 0.525, p = 0.008, ALSFRS-R ρ = - 0.537, p = 0.007), but changes in motor scores did not correlate with changes in serum NfL.Diagnostic and monitoring performance of serum NfL measurement seems to differ between SMA subtypes. Unlike to SMA type 1, in adolescent and adult SMA type  and 3 patients, neurodegeneration is not reflected by increased NfL levels and short-term therapeutic effects cannot be observed. Long-term follow-up has to be performed to see if even low levels of NfL might be good prognostic markers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31486056>Design and Comprehension Testing of Tailored Asthma Control Infographics for Adults with Persistent Asthma.</a></h2><p> Adherence to daily inhaled corticosteroid medication is important for asthma control but low health literacy is a  to comprehension of control status and may contribute to medication nonadherence. Infographics tailored with patients' own data can support comprehension of health status, but these have not been applied to asthma successfully. This two-phased study developed and tested tailored infographics of (1) scores on the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ), a self-report measure of symptom burden, and () pulmonary  test (PFT) results. The infographics are intended for use as communication and adherence-promotion tools in clinical interactions. For both phases, participants (18+ years, English- or Spanish-speaking, persistent asthma) were recruited through two primary care clinics. In Phase I, we used a hybrid iterative participatory design process to refine prototype designs. In Phase II, we conducted individual comprehension assessment interviews with the finalized designs. Infographics were hand-tailored for each participant using their ACQ score and PFT results collected at the start of the interview. Two independent raters scored interview transcripts for gist and verbatim comprehension based on a predetermined rubric. The five Phase I design sessions led to final prototypes that participants ( = 21) considered appealing and easy to comprehend. All Phase II participants ( = 10) demonstrated complete gist and verbatim comprehension. Participants reacted favorably to receiving their information via infographics and expressed intentions to engage in self-management behaviors (e.g., medication adherence, smoking cessation, weight loss, and review of their care plan) in response to the information. This study provides preliminary evidence that infographics can support comprehension of asthma control status and promote self-management intentions among adults with persistent asthma. Infographics can be programmed into electronic health records and/or standalone applications to allow for instant tailoring at the point of care.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31531158>Ceramide- and Keratolytic-containing Body Cleanser and Cream Application in Patients with Psoriasis: Outcomes from a Consumer Usage Study.</a></h2><p> Ceramides are epidermal lipids that play an essential role in stratum corneum , including maintaining physiologic permeability  properties. The role of ceramides in the maintenance and repair of epidermal   is believed to be valuable in the treatment of psoriasis. Normalization of corneocyte desquamation and the incorporation of agents that promote desquamation to reduce hyperkeratosis are also regarded as key factors in psoriasis management.  We sought to evaluate the benefits of two formulations (CeraVe® Body Cleanser [Cer-PSO-BCl] and CeraVe® Body Cream [Cer-PSO-Cr]), containing ceramides, salicylic acid, and urea in patients with a history of psoriasis, including those with mild-to-moderate psoriatic flares.  This was a two-center customer usage study involving 33 male and female subjects, 18 years of age or older, with a history of mild-to-moderate psoriasis. Cer-PSO-Cr was applied liberally wherever psoriasis was present twice a day for two weeks. Cer-PSO-BCl was recommended for use twice a week. Product attributes, performance of individual test products, and use of this combination regimen (favorable or unfavorable) were assessed using a self-assessment questionnaire at Week .  Overall, 72.7 and 75.8 percent of patients with psoriasis reported the Cer-PSO-Cr alone or Cer-PSOCr/Cer-PSO-BCl regimen improved the appearance of their skin. For the cleanser, 97.0 percent reported it rinsed clean with no unpleasant residue. For cream and cleanser together, 84.8 percent reported it provided relief of psoriasis, and 90.9 percent reported that their skin felt soft and smooth.  Based on results reported by the study patients, the evaluated ceramide/keratolytic-containing cream and cleanser both yielded a high level of patient acceptance regarding improvement in skin characteristics in patients with psoriasis, including when used as a combination adjunctive regimen.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31483932>Erythropoietin protects outer blood-retinal  in experimental diabetic retinopathy by up-regulating ZO-1 and occludin.</a></h2><p>To explore the mechanisms of erythropoietin (EPO) in maintaining outer blood-retinal  (BRB) in diabetic rats.Sprague-Dawley rats were rendered diabetic with intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin, and then followed by intravitreal injection of EPO. Two and four weeks later, the permeability of outer BRB was examined with FITC-dextran leakage assay, following a method to demarcate the inner and outer retina based on retinal blood supply. The glyoxal-treated ARPE-19 cells, incubated with EPO, soluble EPO receptor (sEPOR), Gö6976, or digoxin, were studied for cell viability and  . The expressions of ZO-1, occludin, VEGFR2, HIF-1α, MAPKs, and AKT were examined with Western blot and immunofluorescence.The major Leakage of FITC-dextran was detected in the outer nuclear layer in both - and 4-week diabetic rats. The leakage was largely ameliorated in EPO-treated diabetic rats. The protein expressions of ZO-1 and occludin in the RPE-Bruch's membrane choriocapillaris complex were significantly decreased, whereas HIF-1α and JNK pathways were activated, in 4-week diabetic rats. These changes were prevented by EPO treatment. The in vitro study with ARPE-19 cells confirmed these changes, and the protective effect of EPO was abolished by sEPOR. Gö6976 and digoxin rescued the tight junction and   in glyoxal-treated ARPE-19 cells.In early diabetic rats, the outer BRB might be more severely damaged and its breakdown is the major factor for retinal oedema. EPO maintains the outer BRB integrity through down-regulation of HIF-1α and JNK signallings, and thus up-regulating ZO-1 and occludin expressions in RPE cells.© 2019 Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists.</p></html>
