Even if the role of IL-17 in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases has been reported extensively, its role in tumor is still controversial. Some reports show that Th17 cells eradicate tumors, while others reveal that they promote the initiation and early growth of tumors. Herein, we review the role of IL-17 in the involvement of some common dermatologic diseases: , atopic dermatitis, hidradenitis suppurativa, acne, vitiligo, melanoma, and nonmelanoma skin cancers.© 2019 The International Society of Dermatology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661080>Evaluation of Mobile Apps Targeted at Patients With Spondyloarthritis for Disease Monitoring: Systematic App Search.</a></h2><p>There are many apps developed for patients with spondyloarthritis in the market, but their purpose and quality are not objectively evaluated.The objective of this study was to identify and evaluate existing publicly available, high-quality apps that use validated measurement instruments for monitoring spondyloarthritis disease activity.We conducted a review of apps available on the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store based on a combination of keywords and inclusion and exclusion criteria. Validated disease activity measurement instruments were identified. Data regarding app characteristics, including the presence of validated disease activity measurement, were extracted. The Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) was used to review the apps for user experience.A total of 1253 apps were identified in the app stores, and 5 apps met the criteria and were further analyzed. Moreover, 2 apps (MySpA and Group for Research and Assessment of  and Psoriatic Arthritis App) contained some of the validated disease activity monitoring instruments for specific spondyloarthritis subtypes. These 2 apps were also rated good on the MARS (with total mean scores ≥4 out of 5), whereas the other apps scored poorly in comparison.There are 2 high-quality spondyloarthritis disease activity monitoring apps publicly available, but they only target 2 spondyloarthritis subtypes-ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis. There is a lack of high-quality apps that can measure disease activity for other spondyloarthritis subtypes, and no app that consolidates all validated disease activity instruments across subtypes was available.©Yu Heng Kwan, Wei Jie Ong, Mengfei Xiong, Ying Ying Leung, Jie Kie Phang, Charmaine Tze May Wang, Warren Fong.

Control of the intractable inflammation is a primary goal of HS treatments. Benefit of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antibodies against HS have been reported, and adalimumab has been approved for HS in Europe, the USA and Japan. However, the alternative therapies for anti-TNF antibodies have not been established yet. We experienced a case of HS which developed during the infliximab treatment for Crohn's disease (CD) and was well managed by ustekinumab (UST). We reviewed the articles relating to ustekinumab treatments for HS. Twenty-four HS patients, 16 women and eight men, have been treated with ustekinumab. The average age was 35.7 ± 10.8 years (mean ± SD). All were of Hurley stage II or III. Ten (10/24, 41.6%) had received anti-TNF drugs including infliximab, adalimumab and etanercept prior to UST treatment for HS. Although the initial doses varied from 45 mg s.c. to 390 mg i.v., all cases were treated with 45 or 90 mg s.c. every 8 or 12 weeks at the regular dose, by following the regimen for  or CD. HS in most of the cases started to improve after 3-5 months of UST initiation, and some achieved complete remission. To our knowledge, our case is the first Asian HS patient improved by UST. Overall, UST is useful for HS and could be an alternative treatment if HS patients do not respond to other medications including anti-TNF drugs.© 2019 Japanese Dermatological Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31598933> After Exposure to Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors: French Pharmacovigilance Data and Review of the Literature.</a></h2><p>Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) can induce or aggravate .

However, most of the variations are located in non-coding region with high frequency and small effect size. Pathogenetic variants are rarely reported except HLA-C*0602 with the odds ratio being approximately 4.0 in Chinese population. Although rare variations still account for a small proportion of phenotypic variances in complex diseases, their effect on phenotypes is large. Recently, more and more studies focus on the low-frequency functional variants and have achieved a certain amount of success.Whole genome sequencing and sanger sequencing was performed on 8 MZ twin pairs discordant for  to scan and verified the de novo mutations (DNMs). Additionally, 665 individuals with about 20 years' medical history versus 2054 healthy controls and two published large population studies which had about 8 years' medical history (including 10,727 cases versus 10,582 controls) were applied to validate the enrichment of rare damaging mutations in two DNMs genes. Besides, to verify the pathogenicity of candidate DNM in C3, RNA-sequencing for CD4, CD8 T cells of twins and lesion, non-lesion skin of  patients were carried out. Meanwhile, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit was used to detect the level of C3, C3b in the supernatant of peripheral blood.A total of 27 DNMs between co-twins were identified. We found six of eight twins carry HLA-C∗0602 allele which have large effects on . And it is interesting that a missense mutation in SPRED1 and a splice region mutation in C3 are found in the  individuals in the other two MZ twin pairs without carrying HLA-C*0602 allele. In the replication stage, we found 2 loss-of-function (LOF) variants of C3 only in 665 cases with about 20 years' medical history and gene-wise analysis in 665 cases and 2054 controls showed that the rare missense mutations in C3 were enriched in cases (OR = 1.91, P = 0.0028). We further scanned the LOF mutations of C3 in two published studies (about 8 years' medical history), and found one LOF mutation in the case without carrying HLA-C*0602. In the individual with DNM in C3, RNA sequencing showed the expression level of C3 in skin was significant higher than healthy samples in public database (TPM fold change = 1.40, P = 0.000181) and ELISA showed protein C3 in peripheral blood was higher (~2.2-fold difference) than the other samples of twins without DNM in C3.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that DNM in C3 is the likely pathological mutations, and it provided a better understanding of the genetic etiology of  and additional treatments for this disease.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

While many treatments for  exist, few are convenient and safe long term; even if sufficiently effective, treatments themselves often decrease quality of life and make long-term treatment adherence difficult. Approved in Japan in December 2016, apremilast was expected to function as a simple, long-term, systemic therapeutic agent for . We report on the clinical outcomes of administrating apremilast for 2 years as observed in 46 psoriatic patients at the Saruwatari Dermatology Clinic between March 2017 and February 2019. We believe the ease of clinic consultation (as compared with large general hospital consultation) draws patients who are busy or have mild symptoms, and consequently poor adherence to regular visits and treatment, reflecting realistic conditions. Major adverse events with apremilast treatment were diarrhea (37.0%) and nausea (15.3%), with most cases of diarrhea being mild. Drug survival analysis by the Kaplan-Meier method revealed a 1-year continuation rate of 46.8% and a 2-year continuation rate of 37.4%. Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores during the observation period declined from 9.3 to 2.8 (P < 0.0001) on average, with the DLQI-0/1 achievement rate being 28.6%. Based on our findings, we conclude that apremilast is suitable as a long-lasting basic treatment that is easy to prescribe in small clinics and easy to use in everyday life.© 2019 Japanese Dermatological Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620802>Ixekizumab Results in Persistent Clinical Improvement in Moderate-to-Severe Genital  During a 52 Week, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Phase 3 Clinical Trial.</a></h2><p>Ixekizumab was efficacious in treating moderate-to-severe genital  over 12 weeks.

Atopic dermatitis predominantly began in childhood with only a very discrete incidence peak in adulthood. Scalp, extremity, chest and abdomen involvement was common to both diseases. Scalp/hairline, elbows, nails, intergluteal cleft, umbilicus, knees and legs were most frequently affected in  patients. In AD, periocular, neck, ante-cubital fossae, back of the hands, interdigital areas, and popliteal fossae were commonly affected.  (but not AD) patients were generally more overweight and obese, physically inactive, and had a positive smoking history compared to general population. Both diseases experienced more frequent flares with increasing disease severity. Patients generally displayed uncontrolled disease despite being on systemic therapies. Itch, skin pain, and troubled sleep were much more severe in AD patients, whereas joint pain was more common in  patients.We identified important similarities and differences in the clinical characteristics of adults with  and AD; these should help clinicians to prioritize and improve patient management.© 2019 British Association of Dermatologists.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620817>[Treatment of  via lifestyle changes].</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635942>[Lower risk of severe infections in  with certain biologics versus methotrexate].</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616625>Emerging treatment options for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque  and psoriatic arthritis: evaluating bimekizumab and its therapeutic potential [Corrigendum].</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31583255>Short-Term Efficacy and Safety of IL-17, IL-12/23, and IL-23 Inhibitors Brodalumab, Secukinumab, Ixekizumab, Ustekinumab, Guselkumab, Tildrakizumab, and Risankizumab for the Treatment of Moderate to Severe Plaque : A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.</a></h2><p>The role of interleukin-12 (IL-12), interleukin-23 (IL-23), and interleukin-17 (IL-17) has been recognized in  pathogenesis, and new drugs targeting this axis have already been developed which may provide a new therapeutic approach for patients with moderate to severe .To compare the direct and indirect evidences of the efficacy and safety of brodalumab, secukinumab, ixekizumab, ustekinumab, guselkumab, tildrakizumab, and risankizumab in the short-term treatment of moderate to severe plaque  using network meta-analysis (NMA).A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for the available relevant studies.

Furthermore, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) modulate various pathobiologic processes including inflammation, melanogenesis and melanomagenesis. To determine the association between  and melanogenesis, psoriatic lesional skin was screened through gene expression, immunohistochemistry, immunogold staining and melanin content assays. The present study detected a decreased expression of Tyr, MITF and BMP-4 in psoriatic lesional skin compared with healthy skin.

Considerable effort has been put forth to identify proteins that comprise the hair cell mechanotransduction apparatus. TMC1, a member of the transmembrane channel-like (TMC) family, was identified as a core protein of the mechanotransduction complex in hair cells. However, the inability of TMC1 to traffic through the endoplasmic reticulum in heterologous cellular systems has hindered efforts to characterize its function and fully identify its role in mechanotransduction. We developed a novel approach that allowed for the detection of uncharacterized protein regions, which preclude trafficking to the plasma membrane (PM) in heterologous cells. Tagging N-terminal fragments of TMC1 with Aquaporin 3 (AQP3) and GFP fusion reporter, which intrinsically label PM in HEK293 cells, indicated that residues at the edges of amino acid sequence 138-168 invoke intracellular localization and/or degradation. This signal is able to preclude surface localization of PM protein AQP3 in HEK293 cells. Substitutions of the residues by alanine or serine corroborated that the information determining the intracellular retention is present within amino acid sequence 138-168 of TMC1 N-terminus. This novel signal may preclude the proper trafficking of TMC1 to the PM in heterologous cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31617856>Decision-Analytic Modeling for Time-Effectiveness of the Sequence of Induction Treatments for Moderate to Severe Plaque .</a></h2><p>Systemic  treatments vary in efficacy and cost but also in time until onset of action. Patients with no response to a first induction treatment are typically switched to another, and some patients require several treatments before they see an improvement.To determine the most cost-effective sequence of induction treatment through a comparative time-effectiveness analysis of different systemic treatment sequences currently licensed in Germany for moderate to severe plaque .This time-effectiveness analysis used a decision-analytic model set in the German health care system. The population simulated to receive the treatment sequences consisted of adult men and women with  vulgaris or plaque type  eligible for systemic treatment. Systematic reviews were performed to generate model input values. Data were collected from November 1 through December 15, 2017, and analyzed from January through August 2018.Five treatment sequences frequently used in Germany, identified through an online expert survey (response rate, 10 of 15 [66.7%]), and 4 theoretical sequences starting with a biological agent. Treatments included methotrexate sodium (MTX), cyclosporine (CSA), fumaric acid esters (FAE), adalimumab (ADA), ixekizumab (IXE), infliximab (INF), and secukinumab (SEC).Two health states were defined: responder (patients achieving a  Area Severity Index [PASI] ≥75) and nonresponder (PASI <75). Probability values were defined as response rates of PASI-75. Treatment effects were determined by the mean change in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score. Time until onset of action was assessed as weeks until 25% of patients reach PASI-75. Individual time-effectiveness ratios were calculated per treatment sequence as time until onset of action (in weeks) per minimally important difference (MID) in DLQI and were subsequently ranked.Treatment sequences starting with a biological agent, including IXE-INF-SEC (1.4 weeks per DLQI-MID), INF-IXE-SEC (2.05 weeks per DLQI-MID), SEC-IXE-ADA (2.1 weeks per DLQI-MID), and ADA-IXE-SEC (2.8 weeks per DLQI-MID) were more time-effective than frequently used treatment sequences, including MTX-SEC-ADA (6.8 weeks per DLQI-MID), MTX-ADA-IXE (7.0 weeks per DLQI-MID), MTX-ADA-SEC (7.2 weeks per DLQI-MID), MTX-FAE-ADA (10.05 weeks per DLQI-MID), and FAE-MTX-CSA (11.5 weeks per DLQI-MID). The results were robust to deterministic sensitivity analyses.When allocating monetary resources, policy makers and regulators may want to consider time until patients experience an MID in their quality of life as an additional outcome measure.PROSPERO Identifier: CRD42017074218.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610687> patient preferences for topical drugs: a systematic review.</a></h2><p> Topical drugs are recommended first-line treatment for mild-to-moderate .

However, the data regarding the difference in the periodontal health status of the  patients and the nonpsoriasis controls are limited and inconsistent; hence, a specialized meta-analysis that quantitatively compared the periodontal status between the  and nonpsoriasis subjects by evaluating the related clinical periodontal indexes was needed. The aim of this meta-analysis was to quantitatively evaluate whether the periodontal status of  patients is worse than that of nonpsoriasis subjects.  We searched PubMed and EMBASE for all eligible studies that compared the periodontal status between  patients and nonpsoriasis subjects. The studies were screened based on pre-established inclusion criteria. After extracting the available periodontal indexes from the included studies, the weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was calculated by pooling the mean and standard deviations (SD) of each index.  In total, 8 studies, including 812  patients and 772 nonpsoriasis subjects, were included in our meta-analysis, and the publication dates ranged from 2013 to 2019; eight periodontal indexes were analyzed. The WMD (95% CIs) for each index were: bleeding on probing (%), 9.188 (4.046-14.330,  < 0.001); probing depth (mm), 0.524 (0.183-0.865,  = 0.003); clinical attachment loss (mm), 0.408 (0.051-0.765,  = 0.025); plaque index, 0.186 (-0.170 to 0.543,  = 0.306); gingival index, 0.458 (-0.413 to 1.328,  = 0.303), remaining teeth, -1.709 (-2.106 to -1.312,  < 0.001); missing teeth, 1.130 (0.275-1.985,  = 0.010); the level of alveolar bone loss (mm), 0.400 (0.102-0.698,  = 0.008).  In summary, our meta-analysis revealed that  patients suffer from worse periodontal health than do nonpsoriasis subjects, mainly characterized by worse gingival inflammation, more alveolar bone loss, fewer remaining teeth and more missing teeth. Considering the limitations of this meta-analysis, more high-quality and well-designed studies are needed to validate our conclusions in the future.Copyright © 2019 Qiao, Shi, Zhang, E, Wang, Wang and Liu.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635941>[Yellowish  revealing dermal lipomatous metaplasia].</a></h2><p>Dermal lipomatous metaplasia is a particular histological presentation characterized by the presence of mature fat cells in the dermis.

The interaction between these cytokines and their receptors are critical in mediating host defenses while also making major contributions to inflammatory and autoimmune responses as demonstrated through both in vitro and in vivo experiments as well as human clinical trials. Inhibition of the IL-17A/IL-17RA interaction by monoclonal antibodies has also displayed remarkable efficacies in clinical trials against  and other autoimmune diseases. Recently, we and others reported the identification and characterization of both small-molecule and peptide IL-17A antagonists. These non-antibody IL-17A antagonists can effectively and selectively disrupt the IL-17A/IL-17RA complex and may provide alternative modalities to treat IL-17-related autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

Patients susceptible to hepatotoxicity on exposure to dapsone is constantly on the rise. Dapsone (4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone) is clinically used alone or in combination with rifampicin for the treatment of a variety of dermatological disorders such as acne, dermatitis herpetiformis, ,  infections, leprosy and  pneumonia in AIDS patients. However, the clinical use of dapsone is limited because of dose-dependent adverse hematological reactions. The cholestatic injury caused by dapsone and its - hydroxylated metabolites hinders bile flow and causes oxidative stress and hepatic necrosis, further, leading to hemolysis responsible for hepatitis due to iron overload in the liver.

Inhibition of TNF can decrease the inflammatory response, and this approach has been used in therapy of autoimmune conditions, most effectively in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (also known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis), , psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Five anti-TNF antagonists have been developed and introduced into clinical medicine: a mouse-human chimeric monoclonal antibody to TNF (infliximab), two human monoclonal antibodies to TNF (adalimumab and golimumab), a humanized Fab fragment of anti-TNF linked to polyethylene glycol (certolizumab), and a soluble recombinant form of the TNF cellular receptor (etanercept) which, on binding, blocks the activity of TNF. These TNF antagonists have potent activity in several autoimmune diseases marked by excessive production of this proinflammatory cytokine. All five of these agents are approved for use in rheumatoid arthritis and are considered “disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs” (DMARDs), having been shown to decrease pain, improve function, and ameliorate progressive joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis. The monoclonal antibodies to TNF have also been shown to be effective in psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and inflammatory bowel disease. The five agents rarely cause serum aminotransferase elevations, but have been linked to rare instances of clinically apparent, acute liver injury which often resembles autoimmune hepatitis and can be severe or require corticosteroid therapy. TNF antagonists are also immunosuppressive and can lead to reactivation of latent infections such as tuberculosis and hepatitis B. Severe and even fatal instances of reactivation of hepatitis B have been linked to several anti-TNF agents, and routine screening for HBsAg before starting therapy with these agents is recommended. Patients with HBsAg should receive prophylaxis with an oral antiviral agent during therapy with one of the TNF antagonists. Among the TNF antagonists, infliximab has been most frequently and etanercept least frequently linked to liver injury, including asymptomatic serum aminotransferase elevations, induction of clinically apparent autoimmune hepatitis, and reactivation of hepatitis B. However, infliximab has been most extensively used and studied than the other anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies, and liver injury due to these agents is probably class specific. For these reasons, all five of these agents should be considered potentially hepatotoxic, etanercept perhaps less so that the others.

Patients with chronic diseases or comorbidities could benefit the most from chatbots which can keep track of their condition, provide specific information, encourage adherence to medication, etc. To perform these functions, chatbots need a suitable underlying software architecture. In this paper, we introduce a chatbot architecture for chronic patient support grounded on three pillars: scalability by means of microservices, standard data sharing models through HL7 FHIR and standard conversation modelling using AIML. We also propose an innovative automation mechanism to convert FHIR resources into AIML files, thus facilitating the interaction and data gathering of medical and personal information that ends up in patient health records. To align the way people interact with each other using messaging platforms with the chatbot architecture, we propose these very same channels for the chatbot-patient interaction, paying special attention to security and privacy issues. Finally, we present a monitored-data study performed in different chronic diseases, and we present a prototype implementation tailored for one specific chronic disease, , showing how this new architecture allows the change, the addition or the improvement of different parts of the chatbot in a dynamic and flexible way, providing a substantial improvement in the development of chatbots used as virtual assistants for chronic patients.Copyright © 2019.

Flow cytometry was used for assessing apoptosis. Cell proliferation was detected using MTT and colony formation assays. Dual luciferase reporter assay was applied for confirming the binding site between MEG3 and miR-21, miR-21 and Caspase-8.A cell model for in vitro studying the role of MEG3 in  pathophysiology was established using HaCaT and HHEKs. MEG3 was significantly down-regulated in HaCaT, HHEKs, and psoriatic skin samples. MEG3 inhibits proliferation and promotes apoptosis of Activated-HaCaT (Act-HaCaT) and Activated-HHEKs (Act- HHEK) by regulating miR-21, and the binding site between MEG3 and miR-21 was identified. We also found that miR-21 could inhibit the level of caspase-8 and identified the binding site between caspase-8 and miR-21. Some down-stream proteins of caspase-8, Cleaved caspase-8, cytc, and apaf-1 were regulated by miR-21 and MEG3.MEG3/miR-21 axis may regulate the expression of caspase-8, and further influence the proliferation and apoptosis of  keratinocyte, Act-HaCaT and Act- HHEK.

In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that the processes underlying proper T cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation require well-tuned and dynamic changes in T cell metabolism. Thus, proper metabolic reprogramming in T cells is crucial to ensure proper immunity in the context of infection and anti-tumor immunity. Conversely, aberrant regulation of T cell metabolism can impair T cell function and thereby contribute to T cell-mediated disease. In this review, the relevance of recent insights into T cell metabolism for prototypical T cell-mediated skin diseases will be discussed and their therapeutic potential will be outlined. First, the major modules of T cell metabolism are summarized. Then, the importance of T cell metabolism for T cell-mediated skin diseases such as  and allergic contact dermatitis is discussed, based on the current state of our understanding thereof.

Recently, it has been found that oral microbiota are involved in arthritis pathogenesis. Microbiome composition and its functional implications have been associated with the prevention of bone loss and/or reducing fracture risk. The link between gut-oral microbiota and joint inflammation in animal models of arthritis has been established, and it is now receiving increasing attention in human studies. Recent papers have demonstrated substantial alterations in the gut and oral microbiota in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA). These alterations resemble those established in systemic inflammatory conditions (inflammatory bowel disease, spondyloarthritides, and ), which include decreased microbial diversity and a disturbance of immunoregulatory properties. An association between abundance of oral  and intestinal  in RA patients compared to healthy controls has been clearly demonstrated. These new findings open important future horizons both for understanding disease pathophysiology and for developing novel biomarkers and treatment strategies. The changes and decreased diversity of oral and gut microbiota seem to play an important role in the etiopathogenesis of RA and OA.

We report increased SERPINB2 expression in the skin of  patients, which was in a positive relationship with  severity and in a negative relationship with miR-146a/b in psoriatic lesions.

The predicted binding site for miR-146a/b in 3' untranslated region of SERPINB2 revealed no activity in luciferase assay, while siRNA silencing of miR-146a/b direct targets IRAK1 and CARD10 resulted in reduced expression of SERPINB2, suggesting that miR-146a/b indirectly control SERPINB2 expression in the skin.

Cytokines secreted by infiltrated inflammatory cells contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. TIPE2, one of the four family members of Tumor necrosis factor-α induced protein-8 (TNFAIP8), is a negative regulator of innate and adaptive immunity and plays essential roles in the maintenance of immune tolerance. However, studies on the role of TIPE2 during the development of autoimmune diseases have generated contradictory results. In the current study, we sought to determine the role of TIPE2 during the development of IMQ-induced  and Experimental Autoimmune Uveitis (EAU) in mice. Our study revealed that, while TIPE2-deficiency alleviates , it exacerbates the development of EAU. Further studies demonstrated that, although TIPE2-deficient T cells produced more IL-17A, they do not migrate efficiently to the local inflammatory site, i.e., the skin. This in turn led to the decreased IL-17A production in the skin and consequently reduced the severity of  in TIPE2-deficient mice. However, although TIPE2-deficient T cells still produced more IL-17A in EAU model, they migrate into the inflamed eye as efficient as TIPE2-sufficient T cells, and consequently exacerbates the development of EAU in TIPE2-deficient mice. Taken together, these results indicate that TIPE2 may either promote or suppress autoimmunity depending on the specific inflammatory microenvironment in different types of autoimmune diseases.Copyright © 2019 Liu, He, Geng, Wang and Ruan.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31580467>Relationship of Visceral Fat and Adipokines with Cardiometabolic Diseases in .</a></h2><p>As part of a larger cross-sectional, case-control study on cardiometabolic diseases in  this study investigated the association of visceral fat and serum adipokines with  and cardiometabolic diseases.

The establishment of immunological memory in the skin is a crucial component of the adaptive immune response. Once naive T cells are activated by antigen-presenting cells, a small fraction of them differentiate into precursor memory T cells. These precursor cells ultimately develop into several subsets of memory T cells, including central memory T (T) cells, effector memory T (T) cells, and tissue resident memory T (T) cells. T cells have a unique transcriptional profile, and their most striking characteristics are their long-term survival (longevity) and low migration in peripheral tissues, including the skin. Under physiological conditions, T cells that reside in the skin can respond rapidly to pathogenic challenges. However, there is emerging evidence to support the vital role of T cells in the recurrence of chronic inflammatory skin disorders, including , vitiligo, and fixed drug eruption, under pathological or uncontrolled conditions. Clarifying and characterizing the mechanisms that are involved in skin T cells will help provide promising strategies for reducing the frequency and magnitude of skin inflammation recurrence.

Moreover, secukinumab altered the skin transcriptome. The major transcriptional shift appeared between day 14 and day 42 after treatment initiation, though already at day four, 80 genes were differentially expressed. NFKBIZ (the gene encoding IκBζ) was reduced already after four days of treatment in the skin. NFKBIZ expression correlated to PASI, and NFKBIZ mRNA levels in the skin decreased during anti-IL-17A treatment. Moreover, specific NFKBIZ signature genes were significantly altered during anti-IL-17A treatment. Finally, we identified Act1, p38 MAPK, JNK, and NF-κB as key signaling pathways in NFKBIZ/IκBζ regulation.Our results define a crucial role for IκBζ in the anti-psoriatic effect of secukinumab. Because IκBζ signature genes were regulated already after four days of treatment, this strongly indicates that IκBζ plays a crucial role for the anti-psoriatic effects mediated by anti-IL-17A treatment.Copyright © 2019.

TNF inhibitors still represent the first biologic after conventional synthetic DMARD (csDMARD) in the majority of patients according to registry data. This was possibly because they were historically the first biological agents available (biological DMARDS with a different mechanism of action or targeted synthetic DMARDs did not become available until 2006s), and so switching from one to another was frequent in the case of an inadequate response and/or side effects. TNF inhibitors are also efficacious for other inflammatory joint and spine diseases, and have been approved for inflammatory bowel disease, uveitis and . In addition, national registries have provided long-term safety data and demonstrated their beneficial effect on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, approximately 30-40% of patients discontinue anti-TNF treatment because of primary failure, secondary loss of response, or intolerance. The options for managing anti-TNF treatment failures include switching to an alternative anti-TNF (cycling) or to another class of targeted drug with a different mechanism of action (swapping). The aim of this review is to evaluate the pros and cons of whether it is more appropriate to choose a second anti-TNF biological agents after the failure of the first or swap treatment early.Copyright © 2019.

Nature offers a wide range of molecules with antioxidant activity able to neutralize, at least in part, the formation of free radicals and therefore to counteract the phenomena of cellular aging. Since synthetic drugs for the treatment of skin diseases can induce resistance, it is particularly interesting to use compounds of plant origin, transporting them in pharmaceutical forms capable of controlling their release and absorption. This review provides an overview of new findings about the use of lipid-based nanosystems for the delivery of natural molecules useful on the topical treatment of skin disorders. Several natural molecules encapsulated in lipid nanosystems have been considered in the treatment of some skin pathologies or diseases. Particularly, the use of rosemary and eucalyptus essential oil, saffron derivatives, curcumin, eugenol, capsaicin, thymol and lycopene has been reported. The molecules have been alternatively encapsulated in viscous systems, such as the organogels, or in liquid systems, such as ethosomes, transferosomes, solid lipid nanoparticles and monoolein based dispersions thickened by inclusion in carbomer gels. The nanostructured forms have been in vitro and in vivo investigated for the treatment of skin disorders due to dehydration, inflammation, melanoma, wound healing, fungal infections or . The data reported in the different studies have suggested that the cutaneous application of lipid nanosystems allows a deep interaction between lipid matrix and skin strata, promoting a prolonged release and efficacy of the loaded natural molecules. This review suggests that the application of natural molecules onto the skin by lipid-based nanosystems can provide numerous clinician benefits in dermatology and cosmetics.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634385>Translating the 2019 AAD-NPF Guidelines of Care for the Management of  With Biologics to clinical practice.</a></h2><p>In February 2019, the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) and the National  Foundation (NPF) released a novel set of guidelines regarding the use of biologics to manage adult patients with moderate to severe .

We have previously demonstrated the role of obese adipose-derived stem cells (ob-ASC) and adipocytes (AD) in the mediation of inflammation through promotion of Th17 cells and activation of monocytes. Such an inflammation resulted in impaired ob-ASC adipogenesis and AD insulin response. In the present study, we investigated the role of IL-17A in the impairment of these functions.With this aim, we used Secukinumab, a potent human anti-IL17A monoclonal antibody which has been approved for the treatment of some IL-17A related inflammatory diseases, notably . This antibody was added or not to phytohemagglutinin A-activated co-cultures of ob-ASC and mononuclear cells. The conditioning media of those co-cultures were harvested and added to AD ongoing differentiation from ob-ASC. Adipogenesis, insulin sensitivity and secretion of inflammatory cytokines were then measured using qRT-PCR, Western blots and ELISAs, respectively.Surprisingly, we did not observe any direct effect of IL-17A on ob-ASC adipogenesis, despite sensitivity of ob-ASC to IL-17A. Moreover, IL-17A blockade, with the help of Secukinumab, did not lead to the recovery of adipogenesis and insulin response, when these functions were impaired by the presence of an inflammatory conditioning medium. However, the up-regulation of IL6 and IL1B mRNA expression by AD submitted to inflammatory conditioning medium was inhibited in the presence of Secukinumab, which indicates that IL-17A may play a role in the propagation of inflammation towards AD.we show herein that IL-17A does not play a major role in the impairment of adipogenesis and/or insulin resistance mediated by an inflammatory environment, but contributes to the propagation of inflammation in human obese adipose tissues. This suggests a beneficial effect of anti-IL17A mAb in inflammatory pathologies, where obesity contributes to poorer response to biologic treatments.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Traditional systemic drugs and biologic agents are used for the treatment of moderate to severe PsO and recent research emphasizes understanding patient goals and preferences for treatment, to improve overall outcomes.An online survey was administered to collect data from 500 adult patients with moderate to severe PsO in the USA. Patients were required to have current or previous systemic therapy use and were excluded if aged 75 or older. Data on demographics, disease burden, treatment use, and patients' treatment goals and expectations were collected. Descriptive and multivariate analyses examined the factors that predict treatment goals. Subgroup analyses were performed for age, gender, severity, comorbid psoriatic arthritis (PsA), location of PsO, and biologic experience. All analyses were conducted using SAS v9.4 and R v3.4.Of the 500 adult patients included, 71.6% reported moderate PsO. Patients had a mean (SD) score of 62.4 (23.0) for skin pain, 60.0 (26.3) for fatigue, and 6.6 (2.1) for itch on a scale of 0-100, 0-100, and 0-10 respectively. Mean (SD) score for quality of life (QoL), assessed using Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), was 18.3 (7.3), with more than 90% having moderate/very large/extremely large effect on life. The majority of patients considered "keeping skin clear for 2-3 years" (94%), "overall relief of symptoms" (93.8%), and effective in clearing certain areas" (92.2%) as important attributes of a systemic treatment. Overall, patients expected 50% clear skin in about 2 weeks and completely clear skin in about 4 weeks.Overall, in this study with more than 70% of patients with moderate disease, patients reported high burden of disease and impact on QoL.

Based on data from the Danish national registry (DERMBIO), this study investigated the correlation between changes in PASI and DLQI in a cohort of patients with moderate-to-severe  treated with biologics or apremilast using Spearman’s rank correlation analyses. The correlation analysis of 1,677 patients, of whom 276 had available data after 5 years, showed weak-to-moderate correlation between PASI and DLQI during a 5-year period and between changes in PASI and DLQI: 0.58 (p < 0.0001) for baseline to 3 months and 0.42 (p < 0.0001) for 3 to 12 months. The first question on “Symptoms and feelings” made up the largest proportion of the overall DLQI. The correlation between PASI and DLQI is weak-to-moderate and varies over time.

By inducing glycosuria, SGLT2i predispose to genital infections. In addition, rare occurrence of Fournier's gangrene (FG) has been reported. We aimed to investigate such association through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adverse event (AE) reporting system (FAERS).We mined the FAERS up to 2018q3 (before FDA warning about SGLT2i-associated FG) to retrieve reports including FG as an AE and SGLT2i as suspect or concomitant drugs, and calculated proportional reporting ratios (PRR).We retrieved 47 cases of FG and 17 cases of other severe AEs of the genital area associated with SGLT2i. Patients with FG were ~10 years older than those with other severe genital AEs. Overall, 77% occurred in men. Three patients were concomitantly treated with systemic immunosuppressive drugs. Increased reporting frequency emerged for SGLT2i compared with other drugs, with a PRR ranging from 5 to 10. The disproportional reporting of FG with SGLT2i remained robust and consistently significant when restricting to the period when SGLT2i were available, to reports filed for glucose-lowering medications or for drugs with the diabetes indication, and after refining the definition of FG. FG was disproportionally associated with  and with the combination of immunosuppressants and SGLT2i.Although causality cannot be demonstrated, SGLT2i may predispose to FG and other severe genital AEs. Since the use of SGLT2i is expected to increase significantly, clinicians should be aware of these severe, although rare, AEs and their predisposing factors.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of interleukin-36 (IL-36) on keratinocyte dysfunction . Methods Human keratinocyte cell lines, HaCaT cells, were treated with 0 (control), 50 or 100 ng/ml IL-36 respectively for 24 h. Cell viability was determined with a cell counting kit-8 assay. Flow cytometry was used to assess the effects of IL-36 on apoptosis and cell cycle distribution. Expressions of the differentiation markers, such as keratin 10 and involucrin, were evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Expressions of the inflammatory cytokines, IL-1 and IL-6 were tested by ELISA. Results CCK8 assay showed the survival rate had no significant difference between the control and treated group ( > 0.05). Flow cytometry analysis showed cell cycle arrest at S phase in the IL-36-treated groups compared with the control group ( < 0.05). RT-qPCR verified the decreased mRNA expressions of keratin 10 and involucrin in the IL-36-treated groups compared with the negative control ( < 0.01). ELISA showed 100 ng/ml IL-36 enhanced levels of IL-1 and IL-6 in culture supernatants of HaCaT cells compared with the negative control ( < 0.05).

Here we found that IκBζ expression in keratinocytes triggers not only skin lesions, but also systemic inflammation in mouse  models. Specific depletion of IκBζ in keratinocytes was sufficient to suppress the induction of imiquimod- or IL-36-mediated . Moreover, IκBζ ablation in keratinocytes prevented the onset of psoriatic lesions and systemic inflammation in keratinocyte-specific IL-17A transgenic mice. Mechanistically, this  protection was mediated by the fact that IκBζ deficiency in keratinocytes abrogated the induction of specific pro-inflammatory target genes, including Cxcl5, Cxcl2, Csf2 and Csf3, in response to IL-17A or IL-36. These IκBζ-dependent genes trigger the generation and recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes that are needed for skin inflammation. Consequently, our data uncover a surprisingly pivotal role of keratinocytes and keratinocyte-derived IκBζ as key mediators of  and -related systemic inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634384>The impact of diet on .</a></h2><p>Because  is a chronic and inflammatory disease, many patients seek alternative therapies and lifestyle modifications to supplement their treatments and help relieve symptoms.

The etiopathogenesis of autoimmune diseases has been revealed as that genetics and environmental factors-mediated dysregulated immune responses contribute to the initiation and development of autoimmune disorders. However, the current understanding of pathogenesis is limited and the underlying mechanism has not been well defined, which lows the development of novel biomarkers and new therapeutic strategies for autoimmune diseases. To improve this, broadening and deepening our understanding of pathogenesis is an unmet need. As genetic susceptibility cannot explain the low accordance rate of incidence in homozygous twins, epigenetic regulations might be an additional explanation. Therefore, this review will summarize current progress of studies on epigenetic dysregulations contributing to autoimmune diseases, including SLE, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), , type 1 diabetes (T1D), and systemic sclerosis (SSc), hopefully providing opinions on orientation of future research, as well as discussing the clinical utilization of potential biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for these diseases.Copyright © 2019 Wu, Chen, Zhu, Zhao and Lu.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599257>Comorbidities in Patients with .</a></h2><p>, a chronic inflammatory disease is associated with a long list of comorbidities.

The link between psoriatic condition and obesity is based on shared pathophysiological pathways where local and systemic inflammation promote each other; PsO is an inflammatory, immune-mediated disease, and the adipose tissue is the source of proinflammatory adipokines. Moreover, psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an important comorbidity of PsO that reduces quality of life and makes difficult the patient's management. Treatment of obese subjects with moderate to severe PsO, even more if PsA is present, is challenging because of reduced efficacy of several systemic drugs and increased risk of adverse events. Secukinumab, a monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to and neutralizes interleukin 17A, shows efficacy on PsO in all body weight groups, even in the highest, whose response has a slight downward trend. Clinical features of two obese subjects, affected by PsO and PsA, successfully treated with secukinumab, are described.Copyright © 2019 by S.

CRMO is a diagnosis of exclusion, resulting in often-delayed diagnosis with over one year on average from onset of symptoms to time of diagnosis. Initial diagnosis is rare in adults and previously undocumented in the elderly (age greater than 65). We highlight a case of a 74-year-old elderly Caucasian female with a history of palmoplantar pustular  who presented with pelvic and hip pain. Imaging findings included multiple bony lesions on x-rays, increased uptake in the left side of the pelvis, ileum, proximal sternum, and bilateral medial clavicles on nuclear bone scan. Bone biopsy histologic results of marrow fibrosis and plasma cell infiltrate indicative of chronic inflammation lead to the diagnosis of CRMO. This case highlights that while CRMO is typically a disease with childhood onset, it, while rare, can also present in adults and now has presented in the elderly, remaining an important part of the differential diagnosis of bone pain in adults and the elderly in addition to infectious osteomyelitis and malignancy when imaging reveals multiple bony lesions. This in turn will facilitate the reduction of unnecessary medical treatment and antibiotics.Copyright © 2019 Stacey Mahady and Amit Ladani.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594178>[Fecal microbiota transplantation as a novel therapy for severe ].</a></h2><p>To explore the therapeutic effect of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for severe .

Retinoids have multiple actions and play important roles in regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation, vision, bone growth, tumor suppression and immunity. The effects of retinoids are thought to be mediated by their binding to and activation of the retinoic acid and retinoid X receptors which regulate gene expression, important in normal growth and differentiation. Vitamin A in doses that have medical effects was found to be toxic, particularly when given long term. Modification of the vitamin A structure led to retinoid molecules that had many of its beneficial, but fewer of its adverse effects. Oral retinoids in use in the United States include acitretin for  and isotretinoin for severe nodular acne. Tretinoin is used topically and several other retinoids have been developed for therapy of uncommon forms of cancer (alitretinoin, bexarotene). The commonly used retinoids have many of the side effects of vitamin A including dry skin, cheilosis and nosebleeds and hair loss, but are not stored in the liver and do not cause the typical form of chronic liver disease associated with excessive vitamin A intake. Both acitretin and isotretinoin are teratogenic and embryotoxic and are contraindicated in women who are or intend to become pregnant. Retinoids have been implicated in causing mild-to-moderate elevations in routine liver tests, but these elevations are usually asymptomatic and transient, resolving spontaneously even with continued therapy. Marked elevations in serum aminotransferase levels during retinoid therapy are uncommon, and dose adjustment or drug discontinuation are rarely required for liver test abnormalities. Nevertheless, laboratory monitoring is recommended with routine liver tests at baseline and one month later, and testing thereafter only if abnormalities were found or symptoms arise. Several retinoids (acitretin, etretinate, retinal acetate) have been associated with a clinically apparent acute liver injury which typically arises during the first 3 months of therapy, has many features of hypersensitivity and can be severe and even fatal. Interestingly, isotretinoin often causes mild serum aminotransferase elevations and is commonly listed as having frequent adverse effects on the liver, but it has not been convincingly linked to instances of severe clinically apparent, acute liver injury with jaundice. Two retinoids used in dermatology, acitretin and isotretinoin, are discussed in this record and their combined references of retinoids are provided at the end of this introductory section.

The nonradiographic axSpA and ankylosing spondylitis diseases' activity has a comparable impact on the patients' quality of life and from the practical point of view the approach to treatment of each of them is the same. The aim: The attempt to identify the reasons of diagnostic delays of AS among patients hospitalized in the Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases Department in Lublin and to suggest the ways of improving the accuracy of diagnostic track among other healthcare providers than rheumatologists.Material and methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of the records of 82 patients' with the established diagnosis of AS, hospitalized in the Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases Department in Lublin in 2000-2019, and of 45 years of age and older.Results: From among 82 patients (28 women and 54 men) the diagnosis of AS after 45 years of age was established in 25 patients (10 women and 15 men) - group t, and in the other 57 patients (group n) the diagnosis was established before 45 years of age. On average the age at the time of diagnosis in the whole group (t+n) was 40,7±10,2 (18-76) years, the age at the beginning of inflammatory back pain (age of axial symptoms) was 30,9±8,5 (13-51) years and the diagnostic delay (period between first axial symptoms and diagnosis establishment) was 9,75±9,5 (0-46) years. We did not find any statistically significant associations between sex and age at the moment of diagnosis, age of the beginning of axial symptoms and the time of diagnostic delay. There was no significant difference of incidence of enthesitis, uveitis, arthritis, prevalence of family history of spondyloarthritis and CRP level between group t and n. Antigen HLA B27 was more frequently present in group t.Conclusions: Instead of the recognition progress and worldwide popularization of knowledge about axSpA, the diagnostic delays in this field are still estimated to last many years, the patients are looking for other specialists' help, and they can be not knowledgeable of the inflammatory back pain criteria. Currently, HLA B27 antigen and C-reactive protein are the two most commonly used biomarkers for diagnostic and disease activity monitoring purposes of axSpA and magnetic resonance is the only "imaging biomarker". The presence of extra-axial symptoms does not improve the diagnostic sensitivity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619965>Mast Cells and Sensory Nerves Contribute to Neurogenic Inflammation and Pruritus in Chronic Skin Inflammation.</a></h2><p>The intimate interaction between mast cells and sensory nerves can be illustrated by the wheal and surrounding flare in an urticarial reaction in human skin. This reaction is typically associated with an intense itch at the reaction site. Upon activation, cutaneous mast cells release powerful mediators, such as histamine, tryptase, cytokines, and growth factors that can directly stimulate corresponding receptors on itch-mediating sensory nerves. These include, e.g., H1- and H4-receptors, protease-activated receptor-2, IL-31 receptor, and the high-affinity receptor of nerve growth factor (TrkA). On the other hand, sensory nerves can release neuropeptides, including substance P and vasoactive intestinal peptide, that are able to stimulate mast cells to release mediators leading to potentiation of the reciprocal interaction, inflammation, and itch. Even though mast cells are well recognized for their role in allergic skin whealing and urticaria, increasing evidence supports the reciprocal function between mast cells and sensory nerves in neurogenic inflammation in chronic skin diseases, such as  and atopic dermatitis, which are often characterized by distressing itch, and exacerbated by psychological stress. Increased morphological contacts between mast cells and sensory nerves in the lesional skin in  and atopic dermatitis as well as experimental models in mice and rats support the essential role for mast cell-sensory nerve communication in consequent pruritus. Therefore, we summarize here the present literature pointing to a close association between mast cells and sensory nerves in pruritic skin diseases as well as review the essential supporting findings on pruritic models in mice and rats.Copyright © 2019 Siiskonen and Harvima.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631555>Dermatological complications of therapy with biologics in inflammatory autoimmune diseases.</a></h2><p>Cutaneous adverse events (CAEs) occur in up to 10 % of patients with immune-mediated inflammatory disease (IMID) treated with antitumor necrosis factor (TNF)α agents.

In view of recent advances in diagnosis and treatment, we sought to understand their current knowledge and working practices.A Web-based survey was advertised to chiropractors and osteopaths via the Royal College of Chiropractors and the Institute of Osteopathy.Of 382 completed responses [237 chiropractors (62%) and 145 osteopaths (38%)], all were familiar with AS, but only 63 and 25% were familiar with the terms axSpA and non-radiographic axSpA, respectively. Seventy-seven per cent were confident with inflammatory back pain. Respondents routinely asked about IBD (91%),  (81%), acute anterior uveitis (49%), peripheral arthritis (71%), genitourinary/gut infection (56%), enthesitis (30%) and dactylitis (20%). Eighty-seven per cent were aware of the association between axSpA and HLA-B27. Only 29% recognized that axSpA was common in women. Forty per cent recommend an X-ray (pelvic in 80%) and, if normal, 27% would recommend MRI of the sacroiliac joints and whole spine. Forty-four per cent were aware of biologic therapies. Forty-three per cent were confident with the process of onward referral to rheumatology via the general practitioner (GP). The principal perceived barrier to onward referral was reluctance by the GP to accept their professional opinion.Overall knowledge of ankylosing spondylitis is good, but the term axSpA is poorly understood. Specific learning needs include gender preponderance, awareness of acute anterior uveitis and the availability of biological therapies. There is lack of confidence in the onward referral process to rheumatology via the GP.© The Author(s) 2019.

Criterion validity of presence of EAMs, osteoporosis and fractures was assessed as agreement (kappa) between patients' self-reported and physician-confirmed disease. Construct validity of the mSCQ including EAMs, osteoporosis and/or fractures (SpA-SCQ) was assessed by testing hypotheses about correlations with demographics, physical function, work ability, health utility and disease activity, and was compared with construct validity of the rheumatic disease comorbidity index.In total, 3984 patients contributed to the analyses. Agreement between patient-reported and physician-reported EAMs was substantial to almost perfect (uveitis ĸ = 0.81, IBD ĸ = 0.73,  ĸ = 0.86). Agreement for osteoporosis (ĸ = 0.38) and fractures (ĸ = 0.39) was fair. As hypothesized, the mSCQ correlated moderately to weakly with age, physical function, work limitations and health utility, and very weakly with disease activity. In contrast to our hypothesis, adding EAMs, osteoporosis and/or fractures to the mSCQ decreased correlations with several external constructs, especially among patients with peripheral SpA.

The objective was to show the course of metabolic and liver parameters under secukinumab, etanercept, or placebo treatment over time. A further objective was to assess the impact of selected comorbidities and metabolic characteristics on high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), as a surrogate marker of systemic inflammation.Data from the phase 3 randomised controlled trials (FIXTURE [], ERASURE [], and SCULPTURE []; n=3010) were included in this analysis. Patients were treated with secukinumab 150 mg or 300 mg, placebo or etanercept 50 mg (FIXTURE only) as active comparator. A set of metabolic and liver parameters was longitudinally assessed over 52 weeks. Multivariate regression analyses assessed the impact of selected comorbidities and metabolic characteristics on hs-CRP levels at baseline and under treatment.Secukinumab treatment reduced hs-CRP levels. Body weight and uric acid levels tended to decrease over 52 weeks with secukinumab. Secukinumab showed a neutral effect on fasting plasma glucose, lipid parameters and liver enzymes. Psoriatic arthritis, metabolic syndrome, obesity, impaired glucose metabolism, and hyperuricemia were each associated with increased hs-CRP levels at baseline. Concomitant obesity attenuated the decline in hs-CRP under treatment.These analyses suggest neutral to favourable long term trends in metabolic and liver parameters under secukinumab treatment. Metabolic comorbidities were associated with increased hs-CRP levels, reflecting the role of systemic inflammatory processes in their pathophysiology.© 2019 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639095>Application of medicinal plants in several dermatovenerological entities.</a></h2><p>Treatment of skin conditions with medicinal plants has been an ongoing human activity lasting over thousands of years.

It is important to recognize the different specific cutaneous lesions in SLE (e.g., "butterfly" rash in acute, annular or psoriasiform photosensitive lesions in the subacute form, and discoid lesions in the chronic form) for an early diagnosis and to estimate the associated risks of internal disease, whereas nonspecific lesions (exanthema, vasculitis, and alopecia) can be part of SLE flares. Cutaneous lesions in DM (Gottron's papules and sign, heliotrope rash, dystrophic cuticles, and nailfold capillary abnormalities) may occur before any clinically evident muscular or systemic organ involvement and are of utmost importance for early diagnosis. The pattern of cutaneous lesions and associated autoantibodies also allow the distinction of different phenotypes, either more prone to life-threatening interstitial lung disease (MDA-5) or with higher risk for neoplasia (TIF1-γ). Many other skin lesions, although not specific, require further investigation to look for a possible underlying inflammatory rheumatic disease: non-pruritic urticarial lesions in anti-C1q-associated urticarial vasculitis, Still's disease or hereditary auto-inflammatory syndromes, transient macular purpura of vasculitis in Sjögren's syndrome, Behçet's disease, or RA, Raynaud's phenomenon in SSc and mixed connective tissue disease, erythema nodosum or other panniculitis in RA, Behçet's disease and SLE, pustular eruptions in Behçet's disease, , and hereditary auto-inflammatory syndromes. After reviewing in detail the cutaneous manifestations of the most frequent inflammatory rheumatic diseases, we describe a topographic and morphological approach to skin rashes, calling attention to facial rashes, hand involvement, scalp, nail, or leg lesions or to some morphological aspects of skin lesions (annular, pustular, urticarial, or exanthematous) that may be the initial manifestations of inflammatory rheumatic diseases. The importance of skin lesions is confirmed by their presence as part of the classification criteria of many inflammatory rheumatic diseases. They also contribute to early diagnosis, to characterize disease phenotypes, to aid in effective patient management, and, ultimately, to impact on disease prognosis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, Notch dysregulation has also been identified in keratinocytes of other inflammatory dermatoses including  and atopic dermatitis . Animal knockout models of components of the GSC with resultant Notch dysregulation result in the development of dermal cysts and histological features of follicular occlusion, suggesting that aberrant Notch signaling is linked to the unique clinical and histological manifestations of HS . However, these models also rapidly develop multiple squamous cell carcinomas which is not consistent with the typical progression of HS. The precise role of Notch dysregulation as the primary driver in the molecular pathogenesis of HS is unclear. Dysregulated Notch signaling may be secondary to inflammation or other unknown molecular mechanisms, rather than an actual driver of HS.© 2019 British Association of Dermatologists.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639244>Assessing the Readability of Online Resources for  Treatment.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638166>The JAK inhibitor tofacitinib ameliorates immune‑mediated liver injury in mice.</a></h2><p>The prevalence of immune‑mediated liver diseases such as autoimmune liver disease or viral hepatitis has increased in recent years, and the side effects of pre‑existing treatments are a worldwide problem. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) and T helper 17 (Th17) cells play important roles in the development of immune‑mediated hepatitis and may serve as potential therapeutic targets. Tofacitinib, a new Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, is under investigation for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis; it is also helpful in treating ulcerative colitis and . The roles of tofacitinib were investigated in conferring protection against immune‑mediated liver injury in mice. T cell‑mediated hepatitis was induced by concanavalin A (ConA). The mice in the treatment groups were administered with tofacitinib intragastrically before the ConA injection. Histopathological examination was performed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, and the serum transaminase and inflammatory cytokine levels were determined using an automatic biochemistry analysis apparatus or cytometric bead array (CBA) kits. Flow cytometric analysis was used to detect Tregs and Th17 cells. Tofacitinib significantly decreased the hepatic injury induced by ConA and prominently decreased the liver transaminase level. The secretion of several anti‑inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)‑10 was upregulated in mice from the treatment group, compared to that in mice treated with ConA alone, while the expression of interferon‑γ (IFN‑γ) and tumor necrosis factor‑α (TNF‑α) decreased. Tofacitinib treatment increased the number of Tregs and reduced the number of Th17 cells. Furthermore, tofacitinib could relieve liver fibrosis under conditions of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). The present results indicated that tofacitinib improved immune‑mediated hepatitis and restored the impaired Treg/Th17 cell ratio, which suggests that it may serve as a novel treatment approach for immune‑mediated liver diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652354>Benserazide is a novel inhibitor targeting PKM2 for melanoma treatment.</a></h2><p>The M2 splice isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) is a key enzyme for generating pyruvate and ATP in the glycolytic pathway, whereas the role of PKM2 in tumorigenesis remains a subject of debate. In this study, we found PKM2 is highly expressed in melanoma patients and the malignance is positively corelated with high PKM2 activity and glycolytic capability in melanoma cells. Suppression of PKM2 expression by knocking down markedly attenuated malignant phenotype both in vitro and in vivo, and restoration of PKM2 expression in PKM2 depleted cells could rescue melanoma cells proliferation, invasion and metastasis. With the data indicating PKM2 as a potential therapeutic target, we performed screening for PKM2 inhibitors and identified benserazide (Ben), a drug currently in clinical use. We demonstrated that Ben directly binds to and blocks PKM2 enzyme activity, leading to inhibition of aerobic glycolysis concurrent up-regulation of OXPHOS. Of note, despite PKM2 is very similar to PKM1, Ben does not affect PKM1 enzyme activity. We showed that Ben significantly inhibits cell proliferation, colony formation, invasion and migration in vitro and in vivo. The specificity of Ben was demonstrated by the findings that, suppression of PKM2 expression diminishes the efficacy of Ben in inhibtion of melanoma cell growth; ectopic PKM2 expression in normal cells sensitizes cells to Ben treatment. Interestingly, PKM2 activity and aerobic glycolysis are up-regulated in BRAFi-resistant melanoma cells. As a result, BRAFi-resistant cells exhibit a heightened sensitivity to suppression of PKM2 expression or treatment with Ben both in vitro and in vivo. This article is protected by copyright.

Topical corticosteroids (TCS) are the mainstay of treatment. Long-term safety remains a concern, limiting use, and posttreatment flare is common. Recently data were reported on the use of halobetasol propionate (HP) 0.01% lotion in moderate or severe localized plaque , once-daily for 8 weeks. In addition, a 2-week label-restricted study reported comparable efficacy to HP 0.05% cream. Data evaluating efficacy in specific locations has not been reported and while  commonly affects lower extremities treatment can be more problematic and burden of disease heightened.To investigate the efficacy of a once-daily application of HP 0.01% lotion in comparison with its vehicle in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque  of the lower extremities.A post hoc analysis of two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 3 studies in moderate or severe . Subjects (N=234) where the leg was identified as the target lesion were randomized (2:1 ratio) to receive HP 0.01% lotion or vehicle, once-daily for 8 weeks. Efficacy assessments included treatment success (defined as at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline) in each individual sign of  (erythema, plaque elevation, and scaling) at the target lesion (leg) and overall treatment outcomes including at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline in the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score, and ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’, improvement in Body Surface Area (BSA) and reduction in IGAxBSA. Quality of Life (QoL) was assessed using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) at baseline, week 4, 8, and 12.At the end of the 8-week treatment period, more than half of subjects had achieved treatment success, with 52.1%, 55.5%, and 58.2% of subjects achieving at least a 2-grade reduction in erythema, plaque elevation and scaling severity on the leg, compared with 15.7% and 22.9%, and 22.2% of those treated with vehicle (P<0.001). In addition, overall treatment success (IGA) was achieved in 37.1% of these subjects who had been treated with HP 0.01% lotion compared with 8.4% treated with vehicle (P<0.001); with a corresponding 34.2% reduction in baseline BSA and 50.5% change in mean baseline IGAxBSA (both P<0.001 versus vehicle). Overall, a clinically relevant improvement in QoL was achieved by week 4; by week 8 37.7% of subjects where the leg was the target lesion had a clinically meaningful improvement in disease severity (IGAxBSA-75).In conclusion, halobetasol propionate 0.01% lotion provides statistically significant efficacy following 8 weeks’ therapy compared with vehicle in subjects where the leg was identified as the target lesion, with clinically relevant improvements in QoL and more than a third of subjects achieving a clinically meaningful result.

Although  is a hyper-proliferative skin disorder, the possible role of amino acid transporters has remained unexplored.To investigate the role of the essential amino acid transporter LAT1 (SLC7A5) in .LAT1 floxed mice were crossed to Cre-expressing mouse strains under the control of Keratin 5, CD4 and RORγt. We produced models of skin inflammation induced by Imiquimod and IL-23, and tested the effect of inhibiting LAT1 (JPH203) and mTOR (Rapamycin).LAT1 expression is increased in keratinocytes and skin-infiltrating lymphocytes of psoriatic lesions in humans and mice. LAT1 deletion in keratinocytes does not dampen the inflammatory response or their proliferation, which could be maintained by increased expression of alternative amino acid transporter LAT2 and LAT3. Specific deletion of LAT1 in γδ and CD4 T cells controls the inflammatory response induced by Imiquimod. LAT1 deletion or inhibition blocks the expansion of IL-17-secreting γ4δ4 T cells and CD4 T cells and dampens the release of IL-1β, IL-17, and IL-22 in the Imiquimod-induced model. Moreover, inhibition of LAT1 blocks the expansion of human γδ T cells and IL-17 secretion by human CD4 T cells. IL-23 and IL-1β stimulation upregulates LAT1 expression and induce mTOR activation in IL-17 γδ and Th17 cells. Deletion or inhibition of LAT1 efficiently controls IL-23 and IL-1β-induced PI3K/AKT/mTOR activation, independent of TCR-signaling.Targeting LAT1-mediated amino acid uptake is a potentially useful immunosuppressive strategy to control skin inflammation mediated by IL-23/IL-1β/IL-17 axis.Copyright © 2019.

The current therapeutic arsenal includes local treatments, phototherapies and systemic treatments (conventional systemic therapy and biotherapy), which, in most cases, are sufficient to control this skin disease. Subsequent management of these children should focus on maintaining therapeutic efficacy and preventing relapse by reducing any treatment-related toxicity in order to improve their quality of life. It would therefore appear useful to adopt a "proactive" attitude. To be proactive is to anticipate disease progression in order to limit both the severity and the incidence of new flare-ups. This approach must be distinguished from reactive support. Based on our experience of atopic dermatitis and data on adult , in the absence of publications specific to childhood-onset , herein we propose to provide an overview of this proactive approach in paediatric . This proactive management approach concerns four key precepts: therapeutic education: explanation of the disease, its pathophysiology and the various possible therapeutic approaches; prevention of factors triggering flare-ups or worsening psoriatic infections, such as stress, trauma, diet (mainly reduction of obesity); a proactive approach to topical therapy: skin hygiene and use of emollients, but also limitation of active therapies, use of dosing intervals and "weekend therapy" to reduce the risk of relapse; a proactive approach to systemic therapies: improved therapeutic safety, reduced cumulative doses, through reduced doses, use of dosing intervals and weekend therapy. Care for children with  must be comprehensive and include their environment. The concept of "proactive" treatment in childhood-onset  can help limit the duration and severity of flare-ups while improving quality of life. Simple measures can in fact ensure effective maintenance of treatments over the long term.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, the tissue-specific mechanisms that control the activation of these innate lymphocytes are not known. Here, we demonstrate that CD109, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein highly expressed by keratinocytes, is an important regulator of skin homeostasis and γδ17 cell activation. Genetic deletion of CD109 results in spontaneous epidermal hyperplasia, aberrant accumulation of dermal-derived γδ17 cells, and enhanced susceptibility to psoriasiform inflammation. In this context, γδ17 activation requires interleukin (IL)-23 signals and is reversed by transient depletion of the skin microbiota. Mechanistically, CD109 restrains γδ17 cell activation in a cell-extrinsic manner by fortifying skin barrier integrity. Collectively, our data provide insight into the regulation of the skin IL-23/IL-17 immune axis and how homeostasis is maintained at this important barrier site.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Statistical analyses were performed to estimate the association between physical and mental health status and demographic and clinical characteristics. The study population included 1592 patients.  PCS scores were similar to the general population and to non-severe diseases such as allergies, dermatitis, or back pain, while MCS mean scores were very similar to that of depression, and lower than those of all the other chronic conditions. Poor physical health was associated with female sex, older age, lower educational level, joint involvement, ≥2 comorbidities, moderate to very severe clinical status, GHQ-12 score ≥4, and moderate to severe Skindex-17 psychosocial scores.

Halobetasol has been shown be effective in moderate or severe localized plaque , and tazarotene affords important effects on epidermal hyperproliferation that may be important in more severe disease.To investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a once-daily application of a fixed combination halobetasol propionate 0.01% and tazarotene 0.045% (HP/TAZ) lotion in comparison with its vehicle in patients with severe localized plaque  (as defined by an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) of 4 and Body Surface Area (BSA) of 3%-12%.Post hoc analysis of two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 3 studies. Sixty-two patients with severe localized  (mean BSA 7.4) randomized (2:1) to receive HP/TAZ lotion or vehicle, once-daily for 8 weeks, with a 4-week posttreatment follow-up. Efficacy assessments included treatment success (defined as at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline in the IGA score and a score of ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’), impact on individual signs of  (erythema, plaque elevation, and scaling) at the target lesion, BSA, reduction in mean baseline IGAxBSA and achievement of a clinically meaningful response (number of patients who achieved at least a 75% improvement in IGAxBSA). Safety and treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were evaluated throughout.By week 8, 34.8% of patients were treatment successes compared with 0.0% on vehicle (P=0.004). HP/TAZ lotion was also significantly superior in reducing  signs and symptoms and improving BSA. At week 8, 47.4% (erythema), 66.4% (plaque elevation), and 65.4% (scaling) subjects achieved at least a 2-grade improvement, compared with 14.0% (P=0.016), 14.8% (P<0.001) and 14.7% (P<0.001) respectively with vehicle. Patients treated with HP/TAZ lotion achieved a 32.8% reduction in baseline mean BSA, compared with a 39.6% increase with vehicle (P=0.013). HP/TAZ lotion achieved a statistically significant superior reduction in mean IGAxBSA compared to vehicle from week 2 (P<0.001 versus vehicle). By week 8, almost half of the patients treated with HP/TAZ lotion achieved a clinically meaningful response (IGAxBSA-75) and a 52.9% reduction in mean IGAxBSA score compared with a 17.5% increase in those patients treated with vehicle (P<0.001). One patient (2.6%) treated with HP/TAZ lotion discontinued due to AE. Most frequently reported treatment related AEs were application site pain (7.9%), contact dermatitis (5.3%) and pruritus (5.3%).HP/TAZ lotion provides significantly greater efficacy than vehicle that is both rapid and sustained, in patients with severe localized plaque , with good tolerability and safety over 8 weeks’ once-daily use.

The consequences of obesity in the skin are underestimated. In this paper, we review the effect of obesity on the skin, including how increased body mass index affects skin physiology, skin barrier, collagen structure, and wound healing. Obesity also affects sebaceous and sweat glands and causes circulatory and lymphatic changes. Common skin manifestations related to obesity include acanthosis nigricans, acrochordons, keratosis pilaris, striae distensae, cellulite, and plantar hyperkeratosis. Obesity has metabolic effects, such as causing hyperandrogenism and gout, which in turn are associated with cutaneous manifestations. Furthermore, obesity is associated with an increased incidence of bacterial and Candida skin infections, as well as onychomycosis, inflammatory skin diseases, and chronic dermatoses like hidradenitis suppurativa, , and rosacea. The association between atopic dermatitis and obesity and the increased risk of skin cancer among obese patients is debatable. Obesity is also related to rare skin conditions and to premature hair graying. As physicians, understanding these clinical signs and the underlying systemic disorders will facilitate earlier diagnoses for better treatment and avoidance of sequelae.Copyright © 2019 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.

However, many disorders can affect the nail, among them are the onychomycosis and . Systemic oral therapy has been applied to treat these diseases, even presenting disadvantages including side effects, drug interactions, contraindications, toxicity, high cost and low patient compliance. A great option to succeed in dealing with the problems associated to oral therapy is the topical administration of drugs. However, nail composition, low diffusion through ungual route and reduced tissue bioavailability for topical treatments are limiting factors. These drawbacks can be overcome by promoting penetration through the nails by employing penetration enhancers.The review focuses on patents that highlight permeation enhancers applied to nail drug delivery to the treatment of onychomycosis and .Literature and patent searches were conduced regarding the topic of interest.The substantial literature and patent search revealed that permeation enhancers, especially chemicals, are great strategies for promoting ungual delivery of drugs.Nail topical therapy containing permeation enhancers is an attractive option to delivering localized treatments.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645498>[Clinical image identification of basal cell carcinoma and pigmented nevi based on convolutional neural network].</a></h2><p>To construct an intelligent assistant diagnosis model based on the clinical images of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and pigmented nevi in Chinese by using the advanced convolutional neural network (CNN).  Methods: Based on the Xiangya Medical Big Data Platform, we constructed a large-scale clinical image dataset of skin diseases according to Chinese ethnicity and the Xiangya Skin Disease Dataset. We evaluated the performance of 5 mainstream CNN models (ResNet50, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, DenseNet121, and Xception) on a subset of BCC and pigmented nevi of this dataset. We also analyzed the basis of the diagnosis results in the form of heatmaps. We compared the optimal CNN classification model with 30 professional dermatologists.  Results: The Xiangya Skin Disease Dataset contains 150 223 clinical images with lesion annotations, covering 543 skin diseases, and each image in the dataset contains support for pathological gold standards and the patient's overall medical history. On the test set of 349 BCC and 497 pigmented nevi, the optimal CNN model was Xception, and its classification accuracy can reach 93.5%, of which the area under curve (AUC) values were 0.974 and 0.969, respectively. The results of the heatmap showed that the CNN model can indeed learn the characteristics associated with disease identification. The ability of the Xception model to identify clinical images of BCC and Nevi was basically comparable to that of professional dermatologists.  Conclusion: This study is the first assistant diagnosis study for skin tumor based on Chinese ethnic clinical dataset. It proves that CNN model has the ability to distinguish between Chinese ethnicity's BCC and Nevi, and lays a solid foundation for the following application of artificial intelligence in the diagnosis and treatment for skin tumors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624648>The Role of Ultrasound in Assessing Hand Joints and Tendons in Psoriatic Arthritis.</a></h2><p>Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory arthritis, usually involving peripheral joints, associated with cutaneous , in the absence of rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies.The study included 28 patients diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis according to CASPAR criteria, presenting pain or swelling of the small joints of the hands and wrists, hospitalized in the Department of Rheumatology of the Emergency Clinical County Hospital of Craiova during 2016-2018.In the 28 patients, a total of 840 joints were examined clinically and by ultrasound. From the clinical point of view, out of the total, 32 joints were swollen while 59 joints were tender. Dactylitis was evidenced in 20/280 examined digits upon physical examination. MUS revealed the presence of synovial proliferation in 108/840 sites (12.85%), with grade 1 synovitis in 4 joints (3.7%), grade 2 in 94 joints (87.03%) and grade 3 in 10 joints (9.25%). Out of 280 examined fingers 5.71% presented dactylitis, the third digit being the most commonly targeted. Grade 2 tenosynovitis was found in 40 of the examined tendons, whereas 8 tendons presented with grade 3 tenosynovitis. The most frequently involved were the flexor tendons of the digits (38 out of 40 tendons with inflammatory changes), followed by the extensor carpi ulnaris and flexor carpi radialis tendons.Ultrasound has proven its utility in assessing joint and tendon inflammation to a higher extent that clinically expected. Thus, MUS examination of hand joints may aid the clinician in diagnosing PsA, in evaluating the prognosis and the course of treatment.Copyright © 2019, Medical University Publishing House Craiova.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31592542>Influence of stress on the development of .</a></h2><p> is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease, which is shaped by genetics and environmental factors, including stress.

The molecular analysis was made by using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain assay (RTqPCR) and MALDI ToF mass spectroscopy three times: after 0, 42, 84 days of treatment.Statistically significant differences (p<0.05) in transcriptional activity were observed for genes: TNF-α (0 vs 42 days p=0.006; 0 vs 84 days p=0.005), IL23A (0 vs 42 days p=0.041), IFN-γ (0 vs 42 days p=0.040; 0 vs 84 days p=0.041), IL17 (0 vs 42 p=0.000003 0 vs 84 p=0.001650), IL12A (0 vs 42 p=0.0047vs 84 p=0.0063). The expression of TNF-α was downregulated during therapy, IL23A was upregulated during CsA treatment, while the expression of IFN-γ and IL17 were higher after 42 days and lower after 84 days compared to 0 days of CsA treatment.It seems that TNF-α, IL12A, IL23A, IFN-γ and IL17 can be useful complementary molecular markers to assess the efficacy of  treatment.

Complete surgical excision is essential for relief of symptoms. The main postoperative complications are tumor recurrence and nail dystrophy.To evaluate the long-term outcome and the impact on quality of life (QoL) of glomus tumors after a transungual approach.A retrospective cohort study was conducted. Twenty-six patients underwent transungual excision of subungual glomus tumors. A self-administered questionnaire was sent to evaluate the postoperative outcome. Glomus tumor-related QoL was investigated using modified nail  (NPQ10) and onychomycosis questionnaires.A response rate of 85% was achieved. After a mean follow-up of 63 months after transungual excision of the tumor, the mean Numeric Pain Rating Score had improved from 7.9 (±SD 1.8) preoperatively, to 0.8 (±SD 1.9) (p < .000). Quality of life improved significantly: the mean NPQ10-score improved from 5.5 (±SD 3.4) to 0.64 (±SD 2.1) (p < .000). Nail-related sequelae were not reported in any of the patients.Our study showed that glomus tumors cause impairment on QoL, mostly due to severe pain.

Transdermal drug delivery offers a desirable alternative to the conventional approaches, but the performances of current available skin penetration enhancement techniques are not so satisfactory. To address these limitations, we developed a dissolving microneedle (MN) patch made of hyaluronic acid (HA) with excellent water-solubility, biocompatibility, biodegradability and mechanical property. The amount of MTX encapsulated in the needles of the patch could be controlled during fabrication process for precise dosage. Interestingly, the MTX-loaded MNs successfully penetrated imiquimod (IMQ)-induced thickened epidermis in mice and delivered the drug intralesionally. Meanwhile, fast dissolution of HA endowed the MNs with operability for patients. We found the MTX-loaded MNs not only showed well-maintained inhibitory effect in vitro but also alleviated the -like skin inflammation in mice. Moreover, the MTX-loaded MNs were significantly more efficacious than taking the same dose of drug orally. Consequently, a higher oral dose of MTX was required for a comparable amelioration, which in turn increased its systemic toxicity.

Monoclonal antibodies are typically derived from a clonal expansion of antibody producing malignant human plasma cells. The initial monoclonal antibodies were created by fusing spleen cells from an immunized mouse with human or mouse myeloma cells (malignant self-perpetuating antibody producing cells), and selecting out and cloning the hybrid cells (hybridomas) that produced the desired antibody reactivity. These initial monoclonal products were mouse antibodies and were very valuable in laboratory and animal research and diagnostic assays, but were problematic as therapeutic agents because of immune reactions to the foreign mouse protein. Subsequently, production of chimeric mouse-human monoclonal antibodies and means of further “humanizing” them and producing fully human recombinant monoclonal antibodies were developed. The conventions used in nomenclature of monoclonal antibodies indicate whether they are mouse (-omab), chimeric (-ximab), humanized (-zumab) or fully human (-umab). Monoclonal antibodies have broad clinical and experimental medical uses. Many of the initial monoclonal antibodies used in clinical medicine were immunomodulatory agents with activity against specific immune cells, such as CD4 or CD3 lymphocytes, which are important in the pathogenesis of rejection after solid organ transplantation. Subsequently, monoclonal antibodies were prepared against specific cytokines (anti-cytokines), which were believed to play a role in cell and tissue damage in immunologically mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, alkylosing spondylitis, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis and , among others. In addition, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies were developed, aimed at blocking or inhibiting the activity of specific enzymes, cell surface transporters or signaling molecules and have been used in cancer chemotherapy and to treat severe viral infections. Use of monoclonal antibodies is currently broadening to therapy of other severe, nonmalignant conditions including asthma, atopic dermatitis, migraine headaches, hypercholesterolemia, osteoporosis and viral or bacterial infections. Thus, the therapeutic monoclonal antibodies do not fall into a single class and have broad therapeutic uses. As of 2018, more than 60 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are approved and in use in the United States. Monoclonal antibodies are generally well tolerated. Because they are large proteins (typically 150-200,000 daltons in size) they require parenteral, often intravenous, administration. Circulating proteins are metabolized by many cells, but particularly by hepatocytes. Proteins undergo hepatic uptake by endocytosis and are either degraded or recycled to the cell surface for secretion. The hepatic metabolism of antibodies often determines their half-life. Proteins are broken down by cellular proteases into small peptides and amino acids that can used to synthesize other proteins. Metabolism of proteins does not generate toxic intermediates and, therefore, monoclonal antibodies are unlikely to induce drug induced liver injury via production of toxic metabolites. On the other hand, the peptides that are generated by the metabolism of the exogenously administered protein may ultimately be presented as foreign epitopes and generate an immune response. In addition, the primary effect of the monoclonal antibody may generate a response, either immune or otherwise, that leads to an immune mediate hepatic injury. Finally, monoclonal antibodies that suppress the immune system may cause reactivation of latent infections, including tuberculosis and hepatitis B.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662800>Cardiovascular risk factors in psoriatic disease:   psoriatic arthritis.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599175>The potential role of cannabinoids in dermatology.</a></h2><p>Cannabis is increasingly being used world-wide to treat a variety of dermatological conditions.

We used a neighborhood deprivation index, constructed from variables such as low education, low income, unemployment, and social welfare assistance, to assess the level of neighborhood deprivation. Multilevel logistic regression was used in the analysis with individual level characteristics at the first level and level of neighborhood deprivation at the second level.  A significant association between level of neighborhood deprivation and ADs was found. The crude odds were 1.32 (95% confidence interval 1.27-1.36) for those residing in the high-deprived neighborhoods compared to those living in low-deprivation neighborhoods. In the full model, where individual level characteristics were taken into account, the odds of ADs were 1.18 (1.14-1.22) in the most deprived neighborhoods. Certain Ads-angiitis hypersensitive (5.14), ankylosing spondylitis (1.66), celiac disease (1.65), Crohn's disease (1.21), diabetes mellitus type 1 (1.45), Graves's disease (1.13), Hashimoto thyroiditis (1.51),  (1.15), rheumatoid arthritis (1.15), sarcoidosis (1.20), and systemic sclerosis (1.27)-remained significantly associated with high level of neighborhood deprivation after adjustment for the individual-level variables.

Immunostaining for PCNA and ki-67 was used to mark proliferating cells in tissues. Haematoxylin and eosin staining and toluidine staining were employed to assess inflammation, and TUNEL assay was used to detect apoptosis in tissues. The signalling events were evaluated using Western blot, imunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining. MTT assay and clonogenic assay were performed to assess the viability and proliferation of cancer cells, in vitro.In mice, topical application of tryptanthrin suppressed skin carcinogenesis. It attenuated inflammation, impeded the proliferation of hair follicle (HF) cells and suppressed the activation of β-catenin, a major driver of HF cell proliferation. Additionally tryptanthrin suppressed the activation of ERK1/2 and p38, both of which promote β-catenin activation and lowered the expression of c-Myc and cyclin-D1. Tryptanthrin suppressed the proliferation of the human NMSC cell line, A431 and abrogated EGF-induced activation of β-catenin and subsequent cytoskeletal rearrangement.The study demonstrates with molecular evidence that tryptanthrin is an effective suppressor of NMSC.© 2019 The Authors.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are a class of non-protein-coding RNAs longer than approximately 200 nucleotides in length, are emerging as key epigenetic regulators of gene expression recently. Intensive studies have characterized their crucial roles in cutaneous biology and diseases. In this review, we address the promotive or suppressive effects of lncRNAs on cutaneous physiological processes. Then, we focus on the pathogenic role of dysfunctional lncRNAs in a variety of proliferative skin diseases. These evidences suggest that lncRNAs have indispensable roles in the processes of skin biology. Additionally, lncRNAs might be promising biomarkers and therapeutic targets for cutaneous disorders.© 2019 The Authors. Cell Proliferation Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p></html>
