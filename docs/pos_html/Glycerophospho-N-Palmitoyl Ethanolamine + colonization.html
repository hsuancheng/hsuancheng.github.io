However, the mechanism of S. Typhimurium for tumor targeting is still poorly understood. We performed a high-throughput screening of single-gene deletion mutants of S. Typhimurium in an orthotopic, syngeneic murine mammary model of breast cancer. The mutants under selection in this system were classified into functional categories to identify bacterial processes involved in Salmonella accumulation within tumors. Niche-specific genes involved in preferential tumor  were identified and exemplars were confirmed by competitive infection assays. Our results show that the chemotaxis gene cheY and the motility genes motAB confer an advantage for  of Salmonella within orthotopic syngeneic breast tumors. In addition, eutC, a gene belonging to the  metabolic pathway, also confers an advantage for Salmonella within tumors, perhaps by exploiting either  or an alternative nutrient in the inflamed tumor environment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29696325> with Multidrug-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae is Associated with Increased Mortality Following Burn Injury in Sub-Saharan Africa.</a></h2><p>Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria are an emerging international concern in low- and middle-income countries that threaten recent public health gains. These challenges are exacerbated in immunocompromised hosts, such as those with burn injury. This study sought to describe the epidemiology and associated clinical outcomes of burn wound  in a Malawian tertiary burn center.This is a prospective analysis of burn patients presenting to Kamuzu Central Hospital in Lilongwe, Malawi, within 72 h of burn injury. A swab of each patient's primary wound was collected at admission and each subsequent week. The primary exposure was burn wound  with MDR bacteria, particularly Enterobacteriaceae. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. A log binomial model estimated the association between the exposure and outcome, adjusted for confounders.Ninety-nine patients were enrolled with a median age of 4 years (IQR 2-12) and a male preponderance (54%). Median total body surface area burn (TBSA) was 14% (IQR 9-25), and crude in-hospital mortality was 19%. Enterobacteriaceae were the most common MDR bacteria with 36% of patients becoming colonized. Wound  with MDR Enterobacteriaceae was associated with increased in-hospital mortality with a risk ratio of 1.86 (95% CI 1.38, 2.50, p < 0.001) adjusted for TBSA, burn type (scald vs. flame), sex, age, length of stay, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus .MDR bacteria, especially Enterobacteriaceae, are common and are associated with worse burn injury outcomes. In resource-poor environments, a greater emphasis on prevention of MDR bacterial , improved isolation precautions, affordable diagnostics, and antibiotic stewardship are imperative.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27273829>Bacterial Adrenergic Sensors Regulate Virulence of Enteric Pathogens in the Gut.</a></h2><p>Enteric pathogens such as enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) and Citrobacter rodentium, which is largely used as a surrogate EHEC model for murine infections, are exposed to several host neurotransmitters in the gut. An important chemical exchange within the gut involves the neurotransmitters epinephrine and/or norepinephrine, extensively reported to increase virulence gene expression in EHEC, acting through two bacterial adrenergic sensors: QseC and QseE. However, EHEC is unable to establish itself and cause its hallmark lesions, attaching and effacing (AE) lesions, on murine enterocytes. To address the role of these neurotransmitters during enteric infection, we employed C. rodentium Both EHEC and C. rodentium harbor the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) that is necessary for AE lesion formation. Here we show that expression of the LEE, as well as that of other virulence genes in C. rodentium, is also activated by epinephrine and/or norepinephrine. Both QseC and QseE are required for LEE gene activation in C. rodentium, and the qseC and qseE mutants are attenuated for murine infection. C. rodentium has a decreased ability to colonize dopamine β-hydroxylase knockout (Dbh(-/-)) mice, which do not produce epinephrine and norepinephrine. Both adrenergic sensors are required for C. rodentium to sense these neurotransmitters and activate the LEE genes during infection. These data indicate that epinephrine and norepinephrine are sensed by bacterial adrenergic receptors during enteric infection to promote activation of their virulence repertoire. This is the first report of the role of these neurotransmitters during mammalian gastrointestinal (GI) infection by a noninvasive pathogen.The epinephrine and norepinephrine neurotransmitters play important roles in gut physiology and motility. Of note, epinephrine and norepinephrine play a central role in stress responses in mammals, and stress has profound effects on GI function. Bacterial enteric pathogens exploit these neurotransmitters as signals to coordinate the regulation of their virulence genes. The bacterial QseC and QseE adrenergic sensors are at the center of this regulatory cascade. C. rodentium is a noninvasive murine pathogen with a  mechanism similar to that of EHEC, enabling the investigation of host signals in mice. The presence of these neurotransmitters in the gut is necessary for C. rodentium to fully activate its virulence program, in a QseC/QseE-dependent manner, to successfully colonize its murine host. Our study data provide the first example of epinephrine and norepinephrine signaling within the gut to stimulate infection by a bacterial pathogen in a natural animal infection.Copyright © 2016 Moreira et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31400167>Acidic pH promotes lipopolysaccharide modification and alters  in a bacteria-animal mutualism.</a></h2><p>Environmental pH can be an important cue for symbiotic bacteria as they colonize their eukaryotic hosts. Using the model mutualism between the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri and the Hawaiian bobtail squid, we characterized the bacterial transcriptional response to acidic pH experienced during the shift from planktonic to host-associated lifestyles. We found several genes involved in outer membrane structure were differentially expressed based on pH, indicating alterations in membrane physiology as V. fischeri initiates its symbiotic program. Exposure to host-like pH increased the resistance of V. fischeri to the cationic antimicrobial peptide polymixin B, which resembles antibacterial molecules that are produced by the squid to select V. fischeri from the ocean microbiota. Using a forward genetic screen, we identified a homolog of eptA, a predicted phosphoethanolamine transferase, as critical for antimicrobial defense. We used MALDI-MS to verify eptA as an  transferase for the lipid-A portion of V. fischeri lipopolysaccharide. We then used a DNA pulldown approach to discover that eptA transcription is activated by the global regulator H-NS. Finally, we revealed that eptA promotes successful squid  by V. fischeri, supporting its potential role in initiation of this highly specific symbiosis.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29229730>Role of  Utilization Genes in Host  during Urinary Tract Infection.</a></h2><p>Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the second most common infection in humans, making it a global health priority. Nearly half of all women will experience a symptomatic UTI, with uropathogenic  (UPEC) being the major causative agent of the infection. Although there has been extensive research on UPEC virulence determinants, the importance of host-specific metabolism remains understudied. We report here that UPEC upregulates the expression of  utilization genes during uncomplicated UTIs in humans. We further show that UPEC  metabolism is required for effective bladder  in the mouse model of ascending UTI and is dispensable for bladder  in an immunocompromised mouse model of UTI. We demonstrate that although  metabolism mutants do not show increased susceptibility to antimicrobial responses of neutrophils, this metabolic pathway is important for surviving the innate immune system during UTI.

Identifying strategies to prevent adhesion and  is a promising approach to inhibit bacterial pathogenesis and to help preserve the efficacy of available antibiotics. This approach requires an improved understanding of the molecular determinants of adhesion to the bladder urothelium. We designed experiments using a custom-built live cell monolayer rheometer (LCMR) to quantitatively measure individual and combined contributions of bacterial cell surface structures [type 1 pili, curli, and phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) cellulose] to bladder cell adhesion. Using the UPEC strain UTI89, isogenic mutants, and controlled conditions for the differential production of cell surface structures, we discovered that curli can promote stronger adhesive interactions with bladder cells than type 1 pili. Moreover, the coproduction of curli and pEtN cellulose enhanced adhesion. The LCMR enables the evaluation of adhesion under high-shear conditions to reveal this role for pEtN cellulose which escaped detection using conventional tissue culture adhesion assays. Together with complementary biochemical experiments, the results support a model wherein cellulose serves a mortar-like function to promote curli association with and around the bacterial cell surface, resulting in increased bacterial adhesion strength at the bladder cell surface.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30283097>Gut  with Methanogenic Archaea Lowers Plasma Trimethylamine N-oxide Concentrations in Apolipoprotein e-/- Mice.</a></h2><p>A mechanistic link between trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and atherogenesis has been reported. TMAO is generated enzymatically in the liver by the oxidation of trimethylamine (TMA), which is produced from dietary choline, carnitine and betaine by gut bacteria. It is known that certain members of methanogenic archaea (MA) could use methylated amines such as trimethylamine as growth substrates in culture. Therefore, we investigated the efficacy of gut  with MA on lowering plasma TMAO concentrations. Initially, we screened for the  potential and TMAO lowering efficacy of five MA species in C57BL/6 mice fed with high choline/TMA supplemented diet, and found out that all five species could colonize and lover plasma TMAO levels, although with different efficacies. The top performing MA, Methanobrevibacter smithii, Methanosarcina mazei, and Methanomicrococcus blatticola, were transplanted into Apoe mice fed with high choline/TMA supplemented diet. Similar to C57BL/6 mice, following initial provision of the MA, there was progressive attrition of MA within fecal microbial communities post-transplantation during the initial 3 weeks of the study. In general, plasma TMAO concentrations decreased significantly in proportion to the level of MA . In a subsequent experiment, use of antibiotics and repeated transplantation of Apoe mice with M. smithii, led to high engraftment levels during the 9 weeks of the study, resulting in a sustained and significantly lower average plasma TMAO concentrations (18.2 ± 19.6 μM) compared to that in mock-transplanted control mice (120.8 ± 13.0 μM, p < 0.001). Compared to control Apoe mice, M. smithii-colonized mice also had a 44% decrease in aortic plaque area (8,570 μm [95% CI 19587-151821] vs. 15,369 μm [95% CI [70058-237321], p = 0.34), and 52% reduction in the fat content in the atherosclerotic plaques (14,283 μm [95% CI 4,957-23,608] vs. 29,870 μm [95% CI 18,074-41,666], p = 0.10), although these differences did not reach significance. Gut  with M. smithii leads to a significant reduction in plasma TMAO levels, with a tendency for attenuation of atherosclerosis burden in Apoe mice. The anti-atherogenic potential of MA should be further tested in adequately powered experiments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27324468>Treatment with rhDNase in patients with cystic fibrosis alters in-vitro CHIT-1 activity of isolated leucocytes.</a></h2><p>Recent data suggest a possible relationship between cystic fibrosis (CF) pharmacotherapy, Aspergillus fumigatus  (AC) and/or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). The aim of this study was to determine if anti-fungal defence mechanisms are influenced by CF pharmacotherapy, i.e. if (1) neutrophils form CF and non-CF donors differ in their ability to produce chitotriosidase (CHIT-1); (2) if incubation of isolated neutrophils with azithromycin, salbutamol, prednisolone or rhDNase might influence the CHIT-1 activity; and (3) if NETosis and neutrophil killing efficiency is influenced by rhDNase. Neutrophils were isolated from the blood of CF patients (n = 19; mean age 26·8 years or healthy, non-CF donors (n = 20; 38·7 years) and stimulated with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), azithromycin, salbutamol, prednisolone or rhDNase. CHIT-1 enzyme activity was measured with a fluorescent substrate. NETosis was induced by PMA and neutrophil killing efficiency was assessed by a hyphae recovery assay. Neutrophil CHIT-1 activity was comparable in the presence or absence of PMA stimulation in both CF and non-CF donors. PMA stimulation and preincubation with rhDNase increased CHIT-1 activity in culture supernatants from non-CF and CF donors. However, this increase was significant in non-CF donors but not in CF patients (P < 0·05). RhDNase reduced the number of NETs in PMA-stimulated neutrophils and decreased the killing efficiency of leucocytes in our in-vitro model. Azithromycin, salbutamol or prednisolone had no effect on CHIT-1 activity. Stimulation of isolated leucocytes with PMA and treatment with rhDNase interfered with anti-fungal defence mechanisms. However, the impact of our findings for treatment in CF patients needs to be proved in a clinical cohort.© 2016 British Society for Immunology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29204955>The "Gut Feeling": Breaking Down the Role of Gut Microbiome in Multiple Sclerosis.</a></h2><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neuroinflammatory disease of the central nervous system with unknown etiology. Recently, the gut microbiota has emerged as a potential factor in the development of MS, with a number of studies having shown that patients with MS exhibit gut dysbiosis. The gut microbiota helps the host remain healthy by regulating various functions, including food metabolism, energy homeostasis, maintenance of the intestinal barrier, inhibition of  by pathogenic organisms, and shaping of both mucosal and systemic immune responses. Alteration of the gut microbiota, and subsequent changes in its metabolic network that perturb this homeostasis, may lead to intestinal and systemic disorders such as MS. Here we discuss the findings of recent MS microbiome studies and potential mechanisms through which gut microbiota can predispose to, or protect against, MS. These findings highlight the need of an improved understanding of the interactions between the microbiota and host for developing therapies based on gut commensals with which to treat MS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26537571>Substrate recognition and catalysis by LytB, a pneumococcal peptidoglycan hydrolase involved in virulence.</a></h2><p>Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of life-threatening diseases worldwide. Here we provide an in-depth functional characterization of LytB, the peptidoglycan hydrolase responsible for physical separation of daughter cells. Identified herein as an N-acetylglucosaminidase, LytB is involved also in  and invasion of the nasopharynx, biofilm formation and evasion of host immunity as previously demonstrated. We have shown that LytB cleaves the GlcNAc-β-(1,4)-MurNAc glycosidic bond of peptidoglycan building units. The hydrolysis occurs at sites with fully acetylated GlcNAc moieties, with preference for uncross-linked muropeptides. The necessity of GlcN acetylation and the presence of a single acidic moiety (Glu585) essential for catalysis strongly suggest a substrate-assisted mechanism with anchimeric assistance of the acetamido group of GlcNAc moieties. Additionally, modelling of the catalytic region bound to a hexasaccharide tripentapeptide provided insights into substrate-binding subsites and peptidoglycan recognition. Besides, cell-wall digestion products and solubilisation rates might indicate a tight control of LytB activity to prevent unrestrained breakdown of the cell wall. Choline-independent localization at the poles of the cell, mediated by the choline-binding domain, peptidoglycan modification, and choline-mediated (lipo)teichoic-acid attachment contribute to the high selectivity of LytB.

This process relies on the lic locus, containing the lic1 and lic2 operons. These operons produce eight proteins that import and metabolize choline, generate teichoic acid precursors and decorate these with choline. Three promoters control expression of lic operons, with Plic1P1 and Plic1P2 controlling lic1 and Plic2 controlling lic2. To investigate the importance of lic regulation for pneumococci, we assayed the activity of transcriptional fusions of the three lic promoters to the luciferase reporter gene. Plic1P1 , whose activity depends on the response regulator CiaR, responded to fluctuations in extracellular choline, with activity increasing greatly upon choline depletion. We uncovered a complex regulatory mechanism controlling Plic1P1 , involving activity driven by CiaR, repression by putative repressor LicR in the presence of choline, and derepression upon choline depletion mediated by LicC, a choline metabolism enzyme. Finally, the ability to regulate Plic1P1 in response to choline was important for pneumococcal . We suggest that derepression of Plic1P1 upon choline depletion maximizing choline internalization constitutes an adaptive response mechanism allowing pneumococci to optimize growth and survival in environments where choline is scarce.© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30778122>Metabolic adaptation of adherent-invasive Escherichia coli to exposure to bile salts.</a></h2><p>The adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC), which colonize the ileal mucosa of Crohn's disease patients, adhere to intestinal epithelial cells, invade them and exacerbate intestinal inflammation.

There is emerging evidence that bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain affects behaviours including anxiety, cognition, nociception and social interaction. Coordinated locomotor behaviour is critical for the survival and propagation of animals, and is regulated by internal and external sensory inputs. However, little is known about how the gut microbiome influences host locomotion, or the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved. Here we report that germ-free status or antibiotic treatment results in hyperactive locomotor behaviour in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Increased walking speed and daily activity in the absence of a gut microbiome are rescued by mono- with specific bacteria, including the fly commensal Lactobacillus brevis. The bacterial enzyme xylose isomerase from L. brevis recapitulates the locomotor effects of microbial  by modulating sugar metabolism in flies. Notably, thermogenetic activation of octopaminergic neurons or exogenous administration of octopamine, the invertebrate counterpart of noradrenaline, abrogates the effects of xylose isomerase on Drosophila locomotion. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated role for the gut microbiome in modulating locomotion, and identify octopaminergic neurons as mediators of peripheral microbial cues that regulate motor behaviour in animals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28262704>IL-33/ST2 immune responses to respiratory bacteria in pediatric asthma.</a></h2><p>Here we investigated the relationship between local bacterial  and anti-bacterial immune responses in pre-school asthmatic and control children within the EU-wide study PreDicta.

Current murine models of CDI also depend on pretreatment of animals with antibiotics to establish disease. The outbreak that we report here is unique in that the CDI occurred in mice with no antibiotic exposure and is associated with a pre- and perinatal methyl supplementation donor diet intervention study.

Gut microbial metabolism of choline results in the production of trimethylamine (TMA), which upon absorption by the host is converted in the liver to trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). Recent studies revealed that TMAO exacerbates atherosclerosis in mice and positively correlates with the severity of this disease in humans. However, which microbes contribute to TMA production in the human gut, the extent to which host factors (e.g., genotype) and diet affect TMA production and  of these microbes, and the effects TMA-producing microbes have on the bioavailability of dietary choline remain largely unknown. We screened a collection of 79 sequenced human intestinal isolates encompassing the major phyla found in the human gut and identified nine strains capable of producing TMA from choline in vitro. Gnotobiotic mouse studies showed that TMAO accumulates in the serum of animals colonized with TMA-producing species, but not in the serum of animals colonized with intestinal isolates that do not generate TMA from choline in vitro. Remarkably, low levels of  by TMA-producing bacteria significantly reduced choline levels available to the host. This effect was more pronounced as the abundance of TMA-producing bacteria increased. Our findings provide a framework for designing strategies aimed at changing the representation or activity of TMA-producing bacteria in the human gut and suggest that the TMA-producing status of the gut microbiota should be considered when making recommendations about choline intake requirements for humans.Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, and increased trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) levels have been causally linked with CVD development.

Microbiota-dependent generation of trimethylamine (TMA)-the precursor to TMAO-is rate limiting in the metaorganismal TMAO pathway in most humans and is catalyzed by several distinct microbial choline TMA-lyases, including the proteins encoded by the cutC/D (choline utilization C/D) genes in multiple human commensals.Direct demonstration that the gut microbial cutC gene is sufficient to transmit enhanced platelet reactivity and thrombosis potential in a host via TMA/TMAO generation has not yet been reported.Herein, we use gnotobiotic mice and a series of microbial  studies to show that microbial cutC-dependent TMA/TMAO production is sufficient to transmit heightened platelet reactivity and thrombosis potential in a host. Specifically, we examine in vivo thrombosis potential employing germ-free mice colonized with either high TMA-producing stable human fecal polymcrobial communities or a defined CutC-deficient background microbial community coupled with a CutC-expressing human commensal±genetic disruption of its cutC gene (ie, Clostridium sporogenes Δ cutC).Collectively, these studies point to the microbial choline TMA-lyase pathway as a rational molecular target for the treatment of atherothrombotic heart disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25632010>Colistin-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii: beyond carbapenem resistance.</a></h2><p>With an increase in the use of colistin methansulfonate (CMS) to treat carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infections, colistin resistance is emerging.Patients with infection or  due to colistin-resistant A. baumannii were identified at a hospital system in Pennsylvania. Clinical data were collected from electronic medical records. Susceptibility testing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were performed. To investigate the mechanism of colistin resistance, lipid A was subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry.Twenty patients with colistin-resistant A. baumannii were identified. Ventilator-associated pneumonia was the most common type of infection. Nineteen patients had received intravenous and/or inhaled CMS for treatment of carbapenem-resistant, colistin-susceptible A. baumannii infection prior to identification of colistin-resistant isolates. The 30-day all-cause mortality rate was 30%. The treatment regimen for colistin-resistant A. baumannii infection associated with the lowest mortality rate was a combination of CMS, a carbapenem, and ampicillin-sulbactam. The colistin-susceptible and -resistant isolates from the same patients were highly related by PFGE, but isolates from different patients were not, suggesting evolution of resistance during CMS therapy. By MLST, all isolates belonged to the international clone II, the lineage that is epidemic worldwide. Phosphoethanolamine modification of lipid A was present in all colistin-resistant A. baumannii isolates.Colistin-resistant A. baumannii occurred almost exclusively among patients who had received CMS for treatment of carbapenem-resistant, colistin-susceptible A. baumannii infection. Lipid A modification by the addition of phosphoethanolamine accounted for colistin resistance. Susceptibility testing for colistin should be considered for A. baumannii identified from CMS-experienced patients.© The Author 2015.

The E. coli O157 IP (O157-IP) comprised 91 proteins, and included those identified previously using proteomics-based expression library screening, and also proteins comprising DMEM and bovine rumen fluid proteomes. Outer membrane protein A (OmpA), a common component of the above proteomes, and reportedly a contributor to E. coli O157 adherence to cultured HEp-2 epithelial cells, was interestingly found to be a modulator rather than a contributor to E. coli O157 adherence to bovine rectoanal junction squamous epithelial cells. Our results point to a role for yet to be identified members of the O157-IP in E. coli O157 adherence to rectoanal junction squamous epithelial cells, and additionally implicate a possible role for the outer membrane protein A regulator, TdcA, in the expression of such adhesins. Our observations have implications for the development of efficacious vaccines for preventing E. coli O157  of the bovine gastrointestinal tract.© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

EA catabolism was previously shown to contribute to the  and growth of enteric pathogens, such as  serovar Typhimurium and enterohemorrhagic  (EHEC), in the gut environment. We tested the ability of  mutants of  to colonize the gut using a murine model of gastrointestinal (GI) tract competition and report the surprising observation that these mutants outcompete the wild-type strain. Some bacteria that are normal, harmless colonizers of the human body can cause disease in immunocompromised patients, particularly those that have been heavily treated with antibiotics. Therefore, it is important to understand the factors that promote or negate these organisms' ability to colonize. Previously, , found in high concentrations in the GI tract, was shown to promote the  and growth of bacteria associated with food poisoning. Here, we report the surprising, opposite effect of  utilization on the commensal colonizer , namely, that loss of this metabolic capacity made it a better colonizer.Copyright © 2018 Kaval et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30352567>Transcriptomic analysis reveals specific metabolic pathways of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 in bovine digestive contents.</a></h2><p>The cattle gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is the main enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) reservoir. In order to identify nutrients required for the survival or multiplication of EHEC in the bovine GIT, we compared the transcriptomes of the EHEC O157:H7 reference strain EDL933 cultured in vitro in bovine digestive contents (DCs) (rumen, small intestine and rectum) using RNA-sequencing.Gene expression profiles showed that EHEC EDL933 activated common but also specific metabolic pathways to survive in the different bovine DCs. Mucus-derived carbohydrates seem important in EHEC nutrition in posterior DCs (small intestine and rectum) but not in rumen content. Additional carbohydrates (xylose, ribose, mannitol, galactitol) as well as gluconeogenic substrates (aspartate, serine, glycerol) would also be used by EHEC as carbon and/or nitrogen sources all along the bovine GIT including the rumen. However, xylose, GalNac, ribose and fucose transport and/or assimilation encoding genes were over-expressed during incubation in rectum content compared with rumen and intestine contents, and genes coding for maltose transport were only induced in rectum. This suggests a role for these carbohydrates in the  of the cattle rectum, considered as the major site for EHEC multiplication. In contrast, the transcription of the genes associated with the assimilation of , an important nitrogen source for EHEC, was poorly induced in EHEC growing in rectum content, suggesting that  is mainly assimilated in the cattle rumen and small intestine. Respiratory flexibility would also be required for EHEC survival because of the redundancy of dehydrogenases and reductases simultaneously induced in the bovine DCs, probably in response to the availability of electron donors and acceptors.EHEC EDL933 showed a high flexibility in the activation of genes involved in respiratory pathways and assimilation of carbon and nitrogen sources, most of them from animal origin. This may allow the bacterium to adapt and survive in the various bovine GIT compartments. Obtaining a better understanding of EHEC physiology in bovine GIT is a key step to ultimately propose strategies to limit EHEC carriage and shedding by cattle.</p></html>
