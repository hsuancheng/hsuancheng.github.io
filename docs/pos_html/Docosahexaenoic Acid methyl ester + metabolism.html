<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26914447>Polyunsaturated fatty acids are potent openers of human M-channels expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes.</a></h2><p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids have been reported to reduce neuronal excitability, in part by promoting inactivation of voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels. Effects on neuronal potassium channels are less explored and experimental data ambiguous. The aim of this study was to investigate anti-excitable effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids on the neuronal M-channel, important for setting the resting membrane potential in hippocampal and dorsal root ganglion neurones.Effects of fatty acids and fatty acid analogues on mouse dorsal root ganglion neurones and on the human KV 7.2/3 channel expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes were studied using electrophysiology.Extracellular application of physiologically relevant concentrations of the polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid hyperpolarized the resting membrane potential (-2.4 mV by 30 μm) and increased the threshold current to evoke action potentials in dorsal root ganglion neurones. The polyunsaturated fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid, α-linolenic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid facilitated opening of the human M-channel, comprised of the heteromeric human KV 7.2/3 channel expressed in Xenopus oocytes, by shifting the conductance-vs.-voltage curve towards more negative voltages (by -7.4 to -11.3 mV by 70 μm). Uncharged  and monounsaturated oleic acid did not facilitate opening of the human KV 7.2/3 channel.These findings suggest that circulating polyunsaturated fatty acids, with a minimum requirement of multiple double bonds and a charged carboxyl group, dampen excitability by opening neuronal M-channels. Collectively, our data bring light to the molecular targets of polyunsaturated fatty acids and thus a possible mechanism by which polyunsaturated fatty acids reduce neuronal excitability.© 2016 Scandinavian Physiological Society.

Metabolite extracts were analysed in positive mode by normal phase liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry for global metabolomics. Statistical analyses included hierarchical clustering analysis, principal component analysis, Student's t-test, and volcano plot analysis. Metabolites were matched with known metabolite identities using METLIN and enriched for relevant  using IMPaLA.1018 metabolites were detected by LC-MS analysis in synovial fluid from rheumatoid arthritis and healthy patients, with 162 metabolites identified as significantly different between diseased and control.  upregulated with disease included ibuprofen , glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid , alpha-linolenic acid , and steroid hormone biosynthesis.  downregulated with disease included purine and pyrimidine , biological oxidations, arginine and proline , the citrulline-nitric oxide cycle, and glutathione . Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified 30 metabolites as putative rheumatoid arthritis biomarkers including various phospholipids, diol and its derivatives, arsonoacetate, oleananoic acid acetate, , and linolenic acid and eicosatrienoic acid derivatives.This study supports the use of global metabolomic profiling by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry for synovial fluid analysis to provide insight into the aetiology of disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25637769>Docosahexaenoic acid ester of phloridzin inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation in THP-1 differentiated macrophages.</a></h2><p>Phloridzin or phlorizin (PZ) is a predominant phenolic compound found in apple and also used in various natural health products. Phloridzin shows poor absorption and cellular uptake due to its hydrophilic nature. The aim was to investigate and compare the effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) ester of PZ (PZ-DHA) and its parent compounds (phloridzin and DHA), phloretin (the aglycone of PZ) and cyclooxygenase inhibitory drugs (diclofenac and nimesulide) on production of pro-inflammatory biomarkers in inflammation-induced macrophages by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulation. Human THP-1 monocytes were seeded in 24-well plates (5×10(5)/well) and treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 0.1μg/mL) for 48h to induce macrophage differentiation. After 48h, the differentiated macrophages were washed with Hank's buffer and treated with various concentrations of test compounds for 4h, followed by the LPS-stimulation (18h). Pre-exposure of PZ-DHA ester was more effective in reducing tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein levels compared to DHA and nimesulide. However, diclofenac was the most effective in reducing prostaglandin (PGE2) level by depicting a dose-dependent response. However, PZ-DHA ester and DHA were the most effective in inhibiting the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) among other test compounds. Our results suggest that PZ-DHA ester might possess potential therapeutic activity to treat inflammation related disorders such as type 2 diabetes, asthma, atherosclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
