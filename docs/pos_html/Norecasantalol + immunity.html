These organisms have been well described to cause chorioamnionitis, neonatal infection, and urethritis, and to a lesser degree surgical site infection and infection in transplant recipients. Outside of these settings, invasive  infections are rare. We describe the case of a young woman receiving rituximab for multiple sclerosis who presented with fever and bilateral renal abscesses due to  spp., which was successfully treated with oral doxycycline. We searched the literature for cases of invasive  infection and found a patient population that predominates with humoral immunodeficiency, either congenital or iatrogenic. Diagnostic and therapeutic interventions are discussed.© The Author(s) 2019.

Women experiencing systemic lupus are at high risk for premature ovarian insufficiency if using cyclophosphamide, of osteoporosis, arterial ischemic diseases and venous thrombosis at young age. In about 30% of them, an antiphospholipid/anticoagulant antibody can occur which is associated with very high risk of thrombosis. However, the severity of the disease may vary and some women with lupus could benefit from a menopausal hormone therapy (MHT). As a consequence, management of menopause symptoms needs to evaluate carefully the condition of the patient, her lupus history and cardiovascular risk. We will describe the effect of lupus on menopause, of menopause on lupus and report in detail the literature available on MHT and the risk of lupus or the risk of flares in women with lupus. Some other options than MHT for the management of climacteric symptoms will be discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662748>Gastric Cancer in the Era of Immune Checkpoint Blockade.</a></h2><p>Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most important malignancies worldwide because of its high incidence and mortality. The very low survival rates are mainly related to late diagnosis and limited treatment options. GC is the final clinical outcome of a stepwise process that starts with a chronic and sustained inflammatory reaction mounted in response to  infection. The bacterium modulates innate and adaptive  presumably as part of the strategies to survive, which favors the creation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment that ultimately facilitates GC progression. T-cell exhaustion, which is characterized by elevated expression of immune checkpoint (IC) proteins, is one of the most salient manifestations of immunosuppressive microenvironments. It has been consistently demonstrated that the tumor-immune microenvironment(TIME)-exhausted phenotype can be reverted by blocking ICs with monoclonal antibodies. Although these therapies are associated with long-lasting response rates, only a subset of patients derive clinical benefit, which varies according to tumor site. The search for biomarkers to predict the response to IC inhibition is a matter of intense investigation as this may contribute to maximize disease control, reduce side effects, and minimize cost. The approval of pembrolizumab for its use in GC has rocketed immuno-oncology research in this cancer type. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge centered around the immune contexture and recent findings in connection with IC inhibition in GC.Copyright © 2019 Lucía Figueroa-Protti et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665027>Flipping the dogma - phosphatidylserine in non-apoptotic cell death.</a></h2><p>The exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the outer plasma membrane has long been considered a unique feature of apoptotic cells. Together with other "eat me" signals, it enables the recognition and phagocytosis of dying cells (efferocytosis), helping to explain the immunologically-silent nature of apoptosis. Recently, however, PS exposure has also been reported in non-apoptotic forms of regulated inflammatory cell death, such as necroptosis, challenging previous dogma. In this review, we outline the evidence for PS exposure in non-apoptotic cells and extracellular vesicles (EVs), and discuss possible mechanisms based on our knowledge of apoptotic-PS exposure. In addition, we examine the outcomes of non-apoptotic PS exposure, including the reversibility of cell death, efferocytosis, and consequent inflammation. By examining PS biology, we challenge the established approach of distinguishing apoptosis from other cell death pathways by AnnexinV staining of PS externalization. Finally, we re-evaluate how PS exposure is thought to define apoptosis as an immunologically silent process distinct from other non-apoptotic and inflammatory cell death pathways. Ultimately, we suggest that a complete understanding of how regulated cell death processes affect the immune system is far from being fully elucidated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661527>Factors associated with pneumococcal carriage and density in infants and young children in Laos PDR.</a></h2><p>Nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is a precursor to pneumococcal disease. Several host and environmental factors have been associated with pneumococcal carriage, however few studies have examined the relationship between host factors and pneumococcal carriage density. We sought to identify risk factors for pneumococcal carriage and density using data from cross-sectional pneumococcal carriage surveys conducted in the Lao People's Democratic Republic before and after the introduction of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13). Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected infants from aged 5-8 weeks old (n = 999) and children aged 12-23 months (n = 1,010), pneumococci detected by quantitative PCR, and a risk factor questionnaire completed. Logistic and linear regression models were used to evaluate associations between participant characteristics and pneumococcal carriage and density. In infants aged 5-8 weeks, living in a household with two or more children under the age of five years (aOR 1.97; 95% CI 1.39-2.79) and low family income (aOR 1.64; 95% CI 0.99-2.72) were positively associated with pneumococcal carriage. For children aged 12-23 months, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) symptoms (aOR 2.64; 95% CI 1.97-3.53), two or more children under five in the household (aOR 2.40; 95% CI 1.80-3.20), and rural residence (aOR 1.84, 95% CI 1.35-2.50) were positively associated with pneumococcal carriage. PCV13 vaccination was negatively associated with carriage of PCV13 serotypes (aOR 0.60; 95% CI 0.44-0.83). URTI symptoms (p < 0.001), current breastfeeding (p = 0.005), rural residence (p = 0.012), and delivery by Caesarean section (p = 0.035) were associated with higher mean pneumococcal density in pneumococcal carriers (both age groups combined). This study provides new data on pneumococcal carriage and density in a high disease burden setting in southeast Asia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658371>Macronutrients modulate survival to infection and  in Drosophila.</a></h2><p>1.  and nutrition are two essential modulators of individual fitness. However, while the implications of immune function and nutrition on an individual's lifespan and reproduction are well established, the interplay between feeding behaviour, infection, and immune function, remains poorly understood. Asking how ecological and physiological factors affect immune responses and resistance to infections is a central theme of eco-immunology. 2. In this study, we used the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to investigate how infection through septic injury modulates nutritional intake, and how macronutrient balance affects survival to infection by the pathogenic Gram-positive bacterium Micrococcus luteus. 3. Our results show that infected flies maintain carbohydrate intake, but reduce protein intake, thereby shifting from a protein-to-carbohydrate (P:C) ratio of ~1:4 to ~1:10 relative to non-infected and sham-infected flies. Strikingly, the proportion of flies dying after M. luteus infection was significantly lower when flies were fed a low-P high-C diet, revealing that flies shift their macronutrient intake as means of nutritional self-medication against bacterial infection. 4. These results are likely due to the effects of the macronutrient balance on the regulation of the constitutive expression of innate immune genes, as a low-P high-C diet was linked to an up-regulation in the expression of key antimicrobial peptides. 5. Together, our results reveal the intricate relationship between macronutrient intake and resistance to infection, and integrate the molecular cross-talk between metabolic and immune pathways into the framework of nutritional immunology.© 2019 The Authors.

Here, we generated TAM molecular signatures from K14cre;Cdh1;Trp53 (KEP) and MMTV-NeuT (NeuT) transgenic mice that resemble human invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) and HER2 tumors, respectively. Determination of TAM-specific signatures requires comparison with healthy mammary tissue macrophages to avoid overestimation of gene expression differences. TAMs from the two models feature a distinct transcriptomic profile, suggesting that the cancer subtype dictates their phenotype. The KEP-derived signature reliably correlates with poor overall survival in ILC but not in triple-negative breast cancer patients, indicating that translation of murine TAM signatures to patients is cancer subtype dependent. Collectively, we show that a transgenic mouse tumor model can yield a TAM signature relevant for human breast cancer outcome prognosis and provide a generalizable strategy for determining and applying immune cell signatures provided the murine model reflects the human disease.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Over the course of the disease, the episodes increased in frequency and severity, with new signs and symptoms continuing to appear. Most importantly, these included skin changes, splenomegaly and transaminitis. Only partial control of the disease was achieved with anti-IL-1 therapy. Extensive investigation showed generalized inflammation without immune deficiency, with increased levels of serum amyloid A and several pro-inflammatory cytokines including interferon-γ, as well as an increased type I interferon score. Exome sequence analysis identified P369S and R408Q variants in the MEFV innate  regulator, pyrin (MEFV) gene and T260 M and T320 M variants in the NLR family pyrin domain containing 12 (NLRP12) gene.Patients with unclassified and/or unexplained autoinflammatory syndromes present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges and collectively form a substantial part of every cohort of patients with autoinflammatory diseases. Therefore, it is important to acquire their full genomic profile through whole exome and/or genome sequencing and present their cases to a broader audience, to facilitate characterization of similar patients. A critical mass of well-characterized cases will lead to improved diagnosis and informed treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650881>TRAF1 Exacerbates Myocardial Ischemia Reperfusion Injury via ASK1-JNK/p38 Signaling.</a></h2><p>Background After acute myocardial infarction, the recovery of ischemic myocardial blood flow may cause myocardial reperfusion injury, which reduces the efficacy of myocardial reperfusion. Ways to reduce and prevent myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury are of great clinical significance in the treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction. TRAF1 (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 1) is an important adapter protein that is implicated in molecular events regulating , inflammation, and cell death. Little is known about the role and impact of TRAF1 in myocardial I/R injury. Methods and Results TRAF1 expression is markedly induced in wild-type mice and cardiomyocytes after I/R or hypoxia/reoxygenation stimulation. I/R models were established in TRAF1 knockout mice and wild type mice (n=10 per group). We demonstrated that TRAF1 deficiency protects against myocardial I/R-induced loss of heat function, inflammation, and cardiomyocyte death. In addition, overexpression of TRAF1 in primary cardiomyocytes promotes hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced inflammation and apoptosis in vitro. Mechanistically, TRAF1 promotes myocardial I/R injury through regulating ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1)-mediated JNK/p38 (c-Jun N-terminal kinase/p38) MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) cascades. Conclusions Our results indicated that TRAF1 aggravates the development of myocardial I/R injury by enhancing the activation of ASK1-mediated JNK/p38 cascades. Targeting the TRAF1-ASK1-JNK/p38 pathway provide feasible therapies for cardiac I/R injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659127>PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2A-B'γ controls Botrytis cinerea resistance and developmental leaf senescence.</a></h2><p>Plants optimize their growth and survival through highly integrated regulatory networks that coordinate defensive measures and developmental transitions in response to environmental cues. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a key signaling component that controls stress reactions and growth at different stages of plant development, and the PP2A regulatory subunit PP2A-B'γ is required for negative regulation of pathogenesis responses and for maintenance of cell homeostasis in short day conditions. Here, we report molecular mechanisms by which PP2A-B'γ regulates Botrytis cinerea resistance and leaf senescence in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We extend the molecular functionality of PP2A-B'γ to a protein kinase-phosphatase interaction with the defense-associated calcium-dependent protein kinase CPK1 and present indications this interaction may function to control CPK1 activity. In pre-senescent leaf tissues, PP2A-B'γ is also required to negatively control the expression of salicylic acid-related defense genes, which have recently proven vital in plant resistance to necrotrophic fungal pathogens. In addition, we find the premature leaf yellowing of pp2a-b'γ depends on salicylic acid biosynthesis via SALICYLIC ACID INDUCTION DEFICIENT2 and bears the hallmarks of developmental leaf senescence. We propose PP2A-B'γ age-dependently controls salicylic acid-related signaling in plant  and developmental leaf senescence.{copyright, serif} 2019 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Elevated systemic levels of neutrophils have been detected in patients with altered BBB function, but the role of neutrophils in BMEC dysfunction is unknown. Neutrophils are key players of the immune response and, when activated, produce neutrophil-derived microvesicles (NMV). NMV have been shown to impact the integrity of endothelial cells throughout the body and we hypothesize that NMV released from circulating neutrophils interact with BMEC and induce endothelial cell dysfunction. Therefore, the current study investigated the interaction of NMV with human BMEC and determined whether they altered gene expression and function in vitro. Using flow cytometry and confocal imaging, NMV were shown to be internalized by the human cerebral microvascular endothelial cell line hCMEC/D3 via a variety of energy-dependent mechanisms, including endocytosis and macropinocytosis. The internalization of NMV significantly altered the transcriptomic profile of hCMEC/D3, specifically inducing the dysregulation of genes associated with TJ, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and vesicular transport. Functional studies confirmed NMV significantly increased permeability and decreased the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) of a confluent monolayer of hCMEC/D3. These findings indicate that NMV interact with and affect gene expression of BMEC as well as impacting their integrity. We conclude that NMV may play an important role in modulating the permeability of BBB during an infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661485>[Human Oncogenic Viruses: Old Facts and New Hypotheses].</a></h2><p>Numerous studies on the nature of neoplastic growth have demonstrated that oncogenic viruses maybe one of the factors causing cancer. According to various estimates, 10-20% of all human cancers are caused by viruses. For example, the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), hepatitis B and C viruses, human papillomavirus (HPV), human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8), and Merkel cell polyomavirus were implicated in initiating tumors. At the same time, the long period between viral infection and the manifestation of cancer significantly complicates the search for a causal relationship between the presence of a virus in the human organism and the malignant transformation. For this reason, the role of certain viruses in the initiation of neoplastic processes in humans remains an unresolved issue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655126>IκBα phosphorylation and associated NF-κB activation are essential events in lymphocyte activation, proliferation, and anti-bacterial adaptive immune response of Nile tilapia.</a></h2><p>Inhibitory protein IκBα plays a crucial role in the inflammatory process and immune response by regulating the activity of transcription factor NF-κB. In teleost, great progress has been achieved regarding NF-κB signaling for innate , but whether this pathway modulates adaptive , and how, remains largely unclear. In this study, after characterizing the sequence, structure, and phylogeny of Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus IκBα (defined as On-IκBα), we investigated the association between IκBα-regulated NF-κB activation and the lymphocyte-mediated adaptive immune response in Nile tilapia. We found that On-IκBα was evolutionarily conserved, and its mRNA was expressed widely in various tissues, with most abundance in the trunk kidney. mRNA expression of On-IκBα was significantly upregulated in spleen at both innate and adaptive immune stages after Aeromonas hydrophila infection. Moreover, phosphorylation of On-IκBα and the downstream On-NF-κB p65 was obviously elevated in spleen leukocytes at 3, 5, or 8 days after A. hydrophila infection, indicating the activation of NF-κB signaling. Correlating with the augmented protein phosphorylation, leukocyte proliferation was enhanced during the same immune stage, suggesting the potential association of IκBα and IκBα-regulated NF-κB signaling in the primary adaptive immune response. Although lymphocyte activation by the T cell-specific mitogen PHA did not alter On-IκBα mRNA expression significantly, lymphocyte activation by the agonist PMA obviously elevated On-IκBα and On-NF-κB p65 phosphorylation in spleen leukocytes. Together, the results suggest that IκBα phosphorylation and its regulated NF-κB activation are essential events associated with lymphocyte activation, proliferation, and anti-bacterial adaptive immune response in Nile tilapia. Our study aids to understand the regulatory mechanism of adaptive  in teleost.Copyright © 2019.

Here, we identify Condensin II subunits as novel regulators of mitochondrial respiration and stress response. Condensin II is present in the nucleus and cytoplasm. While the effects of Condensin II depletion on nuclear genome organization are well-studied, effects on essential cytoplasmic and metabolic processes are not as well understood. Excitingly, we observe that Condensin II Chromosome Associated Protein (CAP) subunits individually localize to different regions of mitochondria, suggesting possible mitochondrial-specific functions independent from the canonical Condensin II holocomplex. Changes in cellular ATP levels and mitochondrial respiration are observed in Condensin II CAP subunit-deficient cells. Surprisingly, we find that loss of NCAPD3 also sensitizes cells to oxidative stress. Together, these studies identify new, and possibly independent, roles for Condensin II CAP subunits in preventing mitochondrial damage and dysfunction. These findings reveal a new area of Condensin protein research that could contribute to the identification of targets to treat diseases where aberrant function of Condensin II proteins is implicated.© 2019.

However, few studies have focused on the antitumor effects of CD8+ T cell-mediated humoral  or on interactions between CD8+ T cells and B cells in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We found that the frequency of IL-21-producing CD8+CXCR5+ T cells was higher in HCC tumor tissue than in peritumoral tissue or peripheral blood from the same patients or in blood from healthy donors. Moreover, CD8+CXCR5+ T cells migrated in response to supernatants from primary HCC (HCC-SN) cells, and HCC-SN cells also powerfully induced CXCR5 expression in CD8+ T cells and IL-21 expression in CD8+CXCR5+ T cells. CD8+CXCR5+ T cells from HCC patients, but not those from healthy individuals, stimulated CD19+ B cells to differentiate into IgG-producing plasmablasts. These findings reveal that CD8+CXCR5+ T cells strongly infiltrate HCC tumors, and their infiltration is predictive of a better prognosis. Surprisingly, moreover, CD8+CXCR5+ T cells produced IL-21, which induced B cells to differentiate into IgG-producing plasmablasts and to play a key role in humoral  in HCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662039>Measles  in the China-Myanmar border region, Lincang city, Yunnan province, 2017.</a></h2><p>: A recent measles importation-related outbreak in the China-Myanmar border region required outbreak response immunization to stop the outbreak, raising the question of measles  in the area.

Increased cellular autophagy may kill the infected cell and terminate the infection without proper regulation. The mechanism of autophagy regulation during liver disease progression in HCV infection is unclear. The autophagy research has gained a lot of attention recently since autophagy impairment is associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) are three autophagy processes involved in the lysosomal degradation and extracellular release of cytosolic cargoes under excessive stress. Autophagy processes compensate for each other during extreme endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress to promote host and microbe survival as well as HCC development in the highly stressed microenvironment of the cirrhotic liver. This review describes the molecular details of how excessive cellular stress generated during HCV infection activates CMA to improve cell survival. The pathological implications of stress-related CMA activation resulting in the loss of hepatic innate  and tumor suppressors, which are most often observed among cirrhotic patients with HCC, are discussed. The oncogenic cell programming through autophagy regulation initiated by a cytoplasmic virus may facilitate our understanding of HCC mechanisms related to non-viral etiologies and metabolic conditions such as uncontrolled type II diabetes. We propose that a better understanding of how excessive cellular stress leads to cancer through autophagy modulation may allow therapeutic development and early detection of HCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654206>Aberrant methylation of host macrophages induced by tuberculosis infection.</a></h2><p>DNA methylation has been introduced as a promising biomarker for different diseases.

We conducted this study using a human methylation PCR array kit, which comprised a panel of 22 genes in TLR2 signaling pathway, in order to gain insights into epigenetic interactions between drug-susceptible and -resistant Mtb strains and THP-1-derived macrophages (one of the main host  cells during TB infection). We also evaluated the expression of Rv1988 gene in the studied isolates. It was found that the methylation level of all of the studied inflammatory genes, except Irak-2 and Tbk-1, increased in THP-1 macrophages, which were infected by extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Mtb strains, compared with the mock cells (P < 0.05). In susceptible strains, we only found hypomethylation in Irak-2 gene, in addition to a slight increase in the methylation levels of Ubev, Ube2n, and Traf6 genes. The present findings provide new insights into the potential role of resistant and susceptible Mtb strains in promoting aberrant epigenetic modifications in macrophages.

Although cancer cells contain supra-normal concentrations of cytoplasmic DNA, they rarely produce type I IFN spontaneously. This suggests that defects in the DNA-sensing pathway may serve as an immune escape mechanism. We find that cancer cells produce cGAMP that is transferred via gap junctions to tumor-associated dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, which respond by producing type I IFN in situ. Cancer-cell-intrinsic expression of cGAS, but not STING, promotes infiltration by effector CD8 T cells and consequently results in prolonged survival. Furthermore, cGAS-expressing cancers respond better to genotoxic treatments and immunotherapy. Thus, cancer-cell-derived cGAMP is crucial to protective anti-tumor CD8 T cell . Consequently, cancer-cell-intrinsic expression of cGAS determines tumor immunogenicity and makes tumors hot.

Key challenges for the identification of a predictive immune signature include the high dimensionality of data produced by high-throughput technologies and the limitation of standard statistical tests in accounting for synergetic interactions between immune responses to multiple targets. In this study, using samples collected from young children in Ghana at multiple time points during a longitudinal study, we adapted a predictive modelling framework which combines feature selection and machine learning techniques to identify an antigen signature of clinical  to malaria. Our results show that an individual's immune status can be accurately predicted by measuring antibody responses to a small defined set of 15 target antigens. We further demonstrate that the identified immune signature is highly versatile and capable of providing precise and accurate estimates of clinical protection from malaria in an independent geographic community. Our findings pave the way for the development of a robust point-of-care test to identify individuals at high risk of disease and which could be applied to monitor the impact of vaccinations and other interventions.

We employed RNA sequencing and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to profile gene expression in blood and the composition of the fecal microbiota in infants born at <29 weeks gestational age and diagnosed with BPD in comparison to those of preterm infants that were not diagnosed with BPD. 16S rRNA gene sequencing, performed longitudinally on 255 fecal samples collected from 50 infants in the first months of life, identified significant differences in the relative levels of abundance of , and  in the BPD infants in a manner that was birth mode dependent. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis revealed that more than 400 genes were upregulated in infants with BPD. Genes upregulated in BPD infants were significantly enriched for functions related to red blood cell development and oxygen transport, while several immune-related pathways were downregulated. We also identified a gene expression signature consistent with an enrichment of immunosuppressive CD71 early erythroid cells in infants with BPD. Intriguingly, genes that were correlated in their expression with the relative abundances of specific taxa in the microbiota were significantly enriched for roles in the immune system, suggesting that changes in the microbiota might influence immune gene expression systemically. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a serious inflammatory condition of the lung and is the most common complication associated with preterm birth. A large body of evidence now suggests that the gut microbiota can influence  and inflammation systemically; however, the role of the gut microbiota in BPD has not been evaluated to date. Here, we report that there are significant differences in the gut microbiota of infants born at <29 weeks gestation and subsequently diagnosed with BPD, which are particularly pronounced when infants are stratified by birth mode. We also show that erythroid and immune gene expression levels are significantly altered in BPD infants. Interestingly, we identified an association between the composition of the microbiota and immune gene expression in blood in early life. Together, these findings suggest that the composition of the microbiota may influence the risk of developing BPD and, more generally, may shape systemic immune gene expression.Copyright © 2019 Ryan et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664925>Disparities in access to and use of HIV-related health services in the Netherlands by migrant status and sexual orientation: a cross-sectional study among people recently diagnosed with HIV infection.</a></h2><p>Migrants often face barriers to accessing healthcare. We examined disparities in access to and use of HIV-related health services between migrant and non-migrant people recently diagnosed with HIV living in the Netherlands, taken into account sexual orientation. Also, we examined differences in experiences in living with HIV between these groups.We used a questionnaire and clinical data collected between July 2013 and June 2015 among migrant and non-migrant participants of the European cross-sectional aMASE (Advancing Migrant Access to health Services in Europe) study in the Netherlands. Using univariable logistic regression analyses, we compared outcomes on between migrants and non-migrants, stratified by sexual orientation (with non-migrant men having sex with men [MSM] as the reference group).We included 77 migrant MSM, 115 non-migrant MSM, 21 migrant heterosexual men, 14 non-migrant heterosexual men and 20 migrant women. In univariable analyses, all heterosexual groups were less likely to ever have had an HIV-negative test before their diagnosis and were more likely to be diagnosed late than non-migrant MSM. All migrant groups were more likely to have experienced difficulties accessing general healthcare in the Netherlands and were less likely to have heard of post-exposure prophylaxis than non-migrant MSM. Migrants frequently reported uncertainty about their rights to healthcare and language barriers. Most (93%) participants visited a healthcare facility in the 2 years before HIV diagnosis but only in 41% an HIV test was discussed during that visit (no statistical difference between groups). Migrant heterosexuals were more likely to have missed appointments at their HIV clinic due to the travel costs than non-migrant MSM. Migrant MSM and women were more likely to have experienced HIV discrimination in the Netherlands than non-migrant MSM.Disparities in access to and use of HIV-related health services and experiences exist by migrant status but also by sexual orientation. Our data suggests heterosexual men and women may particularly benefit from improved access to HIV testing (e.g., through provider-initiated testing), while migrant MSM may benefit from improved access to HIV prevention interventions (e.g., pre-exposure prophylaxis).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658986>Disruption of  in  impairs ovarian development and  infection.</a></h2><p> infection in  is influenced by mosquito-derived factors.

Two members of the IFIT protein family: IFIT1 and IFIT5 are capable of binding the very terminal 5' end of mRNA. In eukaryotes these mRNA termini contain a cap structure (m7GpppN, cap 0) that is often subjected to further modifications. Here, we performed a thorough examination of IFIT1 and IFIT5 binding to a wide spectrum of differently capped as well as fully uncapped mRNAs. The kinetic analysis of IFIT1 and IFIT5 interactions with mRNA ligands indicates that the cap structure modifications considerably influence the stability of IFIT1/RNA complexes. The most stable complexes were formed between IFIT1 and GpppG/A- and m7GpppG/A-RNAs. Unexpectedly, we found that NAD+- and NADH-capped RNAs associate with IFIT5 with kinetic parameters comparable to pppG-RNA. Finally, we measured interactions of IFIT1 with mRNAs bearing modified synthetic cap analogs that start to become the important tools in biotechnological and medicinal research. We found that incorporation of modified cap analogs to the RNA protects the latter, to a certain degree, from the translational inhibition caused by IFIT1 protein.Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press for the RNA Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658987>A  missense variant causes flagella destabilization and asthenozoospermia.</a></h2><p>Asthenozoospermia is a common cause of male infertility, but its etiology remains incompletely understood.

BVDV can employ 'infect-and-persist' strategy and 'hit-and-run' strategy to remain associated with hosts and thus contributes to BVDV circulation in cattle herds. BVDV have also evolved various strategies to evade the innate  of host. To further understand the mechanisms by which BVDV overcomes the host cell innate immune response and provide more clues for further understanding the BVDV-host interaction, in this descriptive study, we conducted a investigation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of the host during BVDV infection by RNA-Seq analysis.Our analysis identified 1297, 1732, 3072, and 1877 DEGs in the comparison groups mock vs. MDBK cells infected with BVDV post 2 h (MBV2h), mock vs. MBV6h, mock vs. MBV12h, and mock vs. MBV24h, respectively. The reproducibility and repeatability of the results were validated by RT-qPCR. Enrichment analyses of GO annotations and KEGG pathways revealed the host DEGs that are potentially induced by BVDV infection and may participate in BVDV-host interactions. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses identified the potential interactions among the DEGs. Our findings suggested that BVDV infection induced the upregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism. The expression of genes that have antiviral roles, including ISG15, Mx1, OSA1Y, were found to be downregulated and are thus potentially associated with the inhibition of host innate immune system during BVDV infection. The expression levels of F3, C1R, KNG1, CLU, C3, FB, SERPINA5, SERPINE1, C1S, F2RL2, and C2, which belong to the complement and coagulation signalling cascades, were downregulated during BVDV infection, which suggested that the complement system might play a crucial role during BVDV infection.In this descriptive study, our findings revealed the changes in the host transcriptome expression profile during BVDV infection and suggested that BVDV-infection induced altering the host's metabolic network, the inhibition of the expression of antiviral proteins and genes within the complement system might be contributed to BVDV proliferation.

Such a method is still used to measure potency of live Oral Poliovirus Vaccine during vaccine development and production and in some clinical trials. However, the conventional method is not suited to identify and titrate virus in the large numbers of fecal samples generated during clinical trials. Determining titers of each of the three Sabin strains co-existing in Oral Poliovirus Vaccine presents an additional challenge.A new assay using quantitative multiplex polymerase chain reaction as an endpoint instead of cytopathic effect was developed to overcome these limitations. In the multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based titration assay, cell cultures were infected with serial dilutions of test samples, lysed after two-day incubation, and subjected to a quantitative multiplex one-step reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. All three serotypes of poliovirus were identified in single samples and titers calculated. The multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based titration assay was reproducible, robust and sensitive. Its lower limits of titration for three Sabin strains were 1-5 cell culture 50% infectious doses per ml. We prepared different combinations of three Sabin strains and compared titers obtained with conventional and multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based titration assays. Results of the two assays correlated well and showed similar results and sensitivity. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based titration assay was completed in two to 3 days instead of 10 days for the conventional assay.The multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based titration (MPBT) is the first quantitative assay that identifies and titrates each of several different infectious viruses simultaneously in a mixture. It is suitable to identify and titrate polioviruses rapidly during the vaccine manufacturing process as a quality control test, in large clinical trials of vaccines, and for environmental surveillance of polioviruses. The MPBT assay can be automated for high-throughput implementation and applied for other viruses including those with no cytopathic effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665637>STING-Mediated IFI16 Degradation Negatively Controls Type I Interferon Production.</a></h2><p>γ-interferon-inducible protein-16 (IFI16), a key DNA sensor, triggers downstream STING-dependent type I interferon (IFN-I) production and antiviral . However, it is still unclear how to negatively regulate IFI16 to avoid excessive IFN-I production and autoimmunity. Here, we find that STING directly interacts with IFI16 and facilitates IFI16 degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by recruiting the E3 ligase TRIM21. The 1-pyrin region of IFI16 is responsible for the IFI16-STING interaction, and the first three lysines in the N-terminal region of IFI16 are the key sites that lead to STING-mediated IFI16 ubiquitination and degradation. Compared to wild-type IFI16, a higher level of viral DNA triggered IFN-β and antiviral IFN-stimulated gene expression, and thus less HSV-1 infection, was observed in the cells transfected with IFI16-K3/4/6R, an IFI16 mutant that is resistant to degradation.

To avoid this, the response is tightly regulated by post-translational modifications (PTMs). The ubiquitin system represents a powerful PTM machinery that allows for the reversible linkage of ubiquitin to activate and deactivate a target's function. A precise enzymatic cascade of ubiquitin-activating, conjugating and ligating enzymes facilitates ubiquitination. Viruses have evolved to take advantage of the ubiquitin pathway either by targeting factors to dampen the antiviral response or by hijacking the system to enhance their replication. The tripartite motif (TRIM) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases has garnered attention as a major contributor to innate . Many TRIM family members limit viruses either indirectly as components in innate immune signalling, or directly by targeting viral proteins for degradation. In spite of this, TRIMs and other ubiquitin ligases can be appropriated by viruses and repurposed as valuable tools in viral replication. This duality of function suggests a new frontier of research for TRIMs and raises new challenges for discerning the subtleties of these pro-viral mechanisms. Here, we review current findings regarding the involvement of TRIMs in host-virus interactions. We examine ongoing developments in the field, including novel roles for unanchored ubiquitin in innate , the direct involvement of ubiquitin ligases in promoting viral replication, recent controversies on the role of ubiquitin and TRIM25 in activation of the pattern recognition receptor RIG-I, and we discuss the implications these studies have on future research directions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662000>Chicken toll-like receptors and their significance in immune response and disease resistance.</a></h2><p>Infectious diseases are a major challenge for the poultry industry that causes widespread production losses. Thus, management and control of poultry health and diseases are essential for the viability of the industry. Toll-like receptors are best characterized as membrane-bound receptors that perform a central role in immune homeostasis and disease resistance by recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns. In response to pathogen recognition, TLRs initiate both innate and adaptive immune responses which may help to develop immunomodulatory therapeutics for TLR associated diseases. Vaccination produces specific  in the animal's body towards pathogens. However, due to certain disadvantages of vaccines, (inactivation of attenuated pathogens into the virulent strains and weak immunogenicity of inactivated vaccines) there is a crucial need to develop the safe and effective therapeutic intervention. TLR ligands have been classified as a potential adjuvant against the infectious diseases in farm animals. TLR adjuvants induce both specific and nonspecific immune responses in chickens to combat several bacterial, viral and parasitic diseases. Therefore, the aim of this review was to explore the chicken TLR4 and their role in immune responses and disease resistance to develop disease resistance poultry breeds in future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661509>APOL1-G0 protects podocytes in a mouse model of HIV-associated nephropathy.</a></h2><p>African polymorphisms in the gene for Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) confer a survival advantage against lethal trypanosomiasis but also an increased risk for several chronic kidney diseases (CKD) including HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). APOL1 is expressed in renal cells, however, the pathogenic events that lead to renal cell damage and kidney disease are not fully understood. The podocyte function of APOL1-G0 versus APOL1-G2 in the setting of a known disease stressor was assessed using transgenic mouse models. Transgene expression, survival, renal pathology and function, and podocyte density were assessed in an intercross of a mouse model of HIVAN (Tg26) with two mouse models that express either APOL1-G0 or APOL1-G2 in podocytes. Mice that expressed HIV genes developed heavy proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis, and had significant losses in podocyte numbers and reductions in podocyte densities. Mice that co-expressed APOL1-G0 and HIV had preserved podocyte numbers and densities, with fewer morphologic manifestations typical of HIVAN pathology. Podocyte losses and pathology in mice co-expressing APOL1-G2 and HIV were not significantly different from mice expressing only HIV. Podocyte hypertrophy, a known compensatory event to stress, was increased in the mice co-expressing HIV and APOL1-G0, but absent in the mice co-expressing HIV and APOL1-G2. Mortality and renal function tests were not significantly different between groups. APOL1-G0 expressed in podocytes may have a protective function against podocyte loss or injury when exposed to an environmental stressor. This was absent with APOL1-G2 expression, suggesting APOL1-G2 may have lost this protective function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656212> Multivesicular Body and Exosome Secretion in the Intestinal Epithelial Cells of Turtles During Hibernation.</a></h2><p>The present study was designed to investigate the in vivo biological processes of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and exosomes in mitochondria-rich cells (MRCs), goblet cells (GCs), and absorptive cells (ACs) in turtle intestines during hibernation. The exosome markers, cluster of differentiation 63 (CD63) and tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101), were positively expressed in intestinal villi during turtle hibernation. The distribution and formation processes of MVBs and exosomes in turtle MRCs, GCs, and ACs were further confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. During hibernation, abundantly secreted early endosomes (ees) were localized in the luminal and basal cytoplasm of the MRCs and ACs, and late endosomes (les) were dispersed with the supranuclear parts of the MRCs and ACs. Many "heterogeneous" MVBs were identified throughout the cytoplasm of the MRCs and ACs. Interestingly, the ees, les, and MVBs were detected in the cytoplasm of the GCs during hibernation; however, they were absent during nonhibernation. Furthermore, the exocytosis pathways of exosomes and autophagic vacuoles were observed in the MRCs, GCs, and ACs during hibernation. In addition, the number of different MVBs with intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) and heterogeneous endosome-MVB-exosome complexes was significantly increased in the MRCs, GCs, and ACs during hibernation. All these findings indicate that intestinal epithelial cells potentially perform a role in the secretion of MVBs and exosomes, which are essential for mucosal , during hibernation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655055>The establishment of CMV antigen-specific enzyme-linked immunospot assay among Chinese: a pilot study.</a></h2><p>The prevalence of cytomegalovirus in China is high and the infection could result in disastrous consequences.

About 90% of all renal cancers are Renal Cell Carcinoma. Most cases are diagnosed incidentally. 17% of cases are advanced at the time of diagnosis. PDL1 being a trans-membrane cell surface protein is expressed on the tumor cells and is found to have a chief role to inhibit the T cell immune response. It is essential to improve the host  by targeting the PD1/PDL1 pathway, thereby destroying the tumor progression.The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of PDL1 in tumor cells and adjacent normal tissue among the renal cell carcinoma patients and assess the relation between the PDL1 expression and the tumor characters.This is a retrospective study. Ethical clearance was obtained from the institution. 150 histopathologically proven RCC cases were chosen. Immunohistochemistry using a PD-L1 rabbit monoclonal antibody was performed on paraffin embedded formalin fixed tissue blocks. Q scoring was done to calculate the expression of PDL1.Chi square test was done to assess the comparison between the PDL1 expression in tumor cells and their characteristic features like histology, grade and stage. SPSS (version 20.0) was used for analysis. P value <0.05 was considered significant. It also explains the heterogenous nature of PDL1 as it expressed more in the aggressive pathologic characters like high grade.Positive PD-L1 expression was seen in 44% of tumors. Significant association was observed between high WWHO ISUP grading and positive PDL1 expression (p=0.028). It was expressed in 75% of the sarcomatous type of RCC and 46.8% of clear cell RCCs.Our study suggests that blocking PD1/PDL1 pathway may become an effective mode of treatment in cancer immunotherapy especially for Renal Cell Carcinomas.

However, little is known about how vaccination impacts the selective pressures acting on the classical swine fever virus (CSFV). Here we use high-throughput sequencing of viral genomes to investigate evolutionary changes in virus populations following the challenge of naïve and vaccinated pigs with the highly virulent CSFV strain "Koslov". The challenge inoculum contained an ensemble of closely related viral sequences, with three major haplotypes being present, termed A, B, and C. After the challenge, the viral haplotype A was preferentially located within the tonsils of naïve animals but was highly prevalent in the sera of all vaccinated animals. We find that the viral population structure in naïve pigs after infection is very similar to that in the original inoculum. In contrast, the viral population in vaccinated pigs, which only underwent transient low-level viremia, displayed several distinct changes including the emergence of 16 unique non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were not detectable in the challenge inoculum. Further analysis showed a significant loss of heterogeneity and an increasing positive selection acting on the virus populations in the vaccinated pigs. We conclude that vaccination imposes a strong selective pressure on viruses that subsequently replicate within the vaccinated animal.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661483>[Body's Own Epitopes among Foreign Ones: T Cells and Autoantigens].</a></h2><p>T cells play a key role in adaptive  reactions, recognizing antigens using variable TCRs. Functional TCR subunit genes are formed by somatic rearrangement, and some of the resulting TCRs recognize autoantigens, the body's own molecules. The autoreactive T cells that carry such TCRs pose a threat of inducing immune reactions against their own organism. In the course of the immune system's development, some autoreactive T lymphocytes are eliminated by apoptosis, some differentiate into immunosuppressive regulatory T cells, which support immunological tolerance to autoantigens, and the rest fall into a non-functional state of anergy. Suppression of effector T cells by regulatory T cells is mediated by immunosuppressive cytokines and costimulatory molecules, depletion of stimulating IL-2, removal of autoreactive peptides together with MHC molecules, and in other ways. Impairment of self-tolerance leads to autoimmune diseases. However, the loss of immunological tolerance can be employed in tumor treatment, allowing immunotherapy and the use of the potential of autoreactive effector T cells. The fact that the efficacious immunotherapy of tumors is often accompanied by adverse autoimmune reactions currently seems to be the inevitable price paid by using this approach.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657119>CD154-expressing CMV-specific T cells associate with freedom from DNAemia and may be protective in seronegative recipients after liver or intestine transplantation.</a></h2><p>Cell-mediated  to CMV, if known, could improve antiviral drug therapy in at-risk children and young adults with LT and IT.

CMV-specific CD154+ T cells and their subsets were measured with flow cytometry after stimulating PBL from recipient blood samples with an overlapping peptide mix of CMV-pp65 antigen for up to 6 hours. CMV-specific CD154+ T cells co-expressed IFNγ in PBL from three healthy adults and averaged 3.8% (95% CI 3.2%-4.4%) in 40 healthy adults. CMV-specific T cells were significantly lower in 19 CMV DNAemic LT or IT recipients, compared with 126 non-DNAemic recipients, 1.3% (95% CI 0.8-1.7) vs 4.1 (95% CI 3.6-4.6, P < .001). All T-cell subsets demonstrated similar between-group differences. In logistic regression analysis of 46 training set samples, 12 with DNAemia, all obtained between days 0 and 60 from transplant, CMV-specific T-cell frequencies ≥1.7% predicted freedom from DNAemia with NPV of 93%. Sensitivity, specificity, and PPV were 83%, 74%, and 53%, respectively. Test performance was replicated in 99 validation samples.

However, GBM rapidly becomes refractory to anti-VEGF therapies. Myeloid cell infiltration is an important determinant of tumor progression. Given that VEGF is a modulator of the innate immune response we sought to analyze the dynamics of this response in a mouse model of GBM undergoing anti-VEGF therapy.We grafted GL261-DsRed cells in transgenic Thy1-CFP//LysM-EGFP//CD11c-EYFP reporter mice. We combined recurrent spectral two-photon imaging with multiparametric cytometry, immunostaining, and brain clearing to characterize at two critical stages of tumor development (day 21 and day 28 after tumor grafting) the nature and spatial distribution of the innate response in control and bevacizumab-treated mice.We report that at an early stage (21 day), VEGF blockade has a detectable effect on the number of microglial cells but only a mild effect on the number of infiltrating myeloid cells. At a later stage (day 28), the treatment resulted in a specific adjustment of dendritic cell subsets. In treated mice, the number of monocytes and their monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDC) progeny was increased by approximately twofold compared to untreated mice. In agreement, by in vivo quantitative imaging, we observed that treatment increased the number of LysM-EGFP cells traveling in tumor blood vessels and doubled the densities of both infiltrated LysM-EGFP monocytes and double-labeled EGFP/EYFP moDC. The treatment also led to an increased density of conventional cDCs2 subset together with a decrease of cDCs1 subset, necessary for the development of anti-tumor . Finally, we describe differential spatial cell distributions and two immune cell-traveling routes into the brain. LysM-EGFP cells distributed as a gradient from the meninges towards the tumor whereas CD11c-EYFP/MHCII cells were located in the basal area of the tumor. Brain clearing also revealed a flow of CD11c-EYFP cells following the corpus callosum.We uncovered new features in the dynamics of innate immune cells in GBM-bearing mice and deciphered precisely the key populations, i.e., DC subsets controlling immune responses, that are affected by VEGF blockade. Since despite differences, human pathogenesis presents similarities with our mouse model, the data provide new insights into the effect of bevacizumab at the cellular level.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659068>Europium Nanoparticle-Based Sialyl-Tn Monoclonal Antibody Discriminates Epithelial Ovarian Cancer-Associated CA125 from Benign Sources.</a></h2><p>The Sialyl-Thomsen-nouveau antigen (STn) is abundantly produced on many types of human epithelial cancers including epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). We previously developed an EOC-specific lectin sandwich immunoassay (CA125) using a human macrophage galactose-binding lectin coated on fluorescent europium nanoparticles (Eu-NPs) as a tracer and an anti-CA125-specific mAb for capture. Here we have identified a novel STn-mAb that efficiently recognizes the EOC-associated STn antigen on CA125 when coated on Eu-NPs.CA125 from the ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR-3, placental homogenate, and ascites fluid from patients with liver cirrhosis was captured by anti-CA125 antibody immobilized on microtitration wells and traced with anti-STn-mAb-Eu-NPs. Samples from EOC or patients with endometriosis with marginally increased conventional CA125 immunoassay (CA125; 35-200 U/mL) and healthy controls were analyzed.An analytically sensitive CA125 assay that specifically recognized the CA125 isoform produced by OVCAR-3 was achieved. Serum CA125 concentration was significantly higher in EOC patients than in those with endometriosis ( < 0.001). Furthermore, the sensitivity for detection of EOC with CA125 assay was 73.3% when 95% of endometriosis cases were undetectable.Our findings suggest that Eu-NPs-based CA125 assay could help reduce the false-positive rates of CA125 to improve differential diagnosis. The results encourage studying further the potential use of CA125 to detect EOC at earlier clinical stages. This approach warrants further investigation in other cancers as well.© 2019 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654766>Characterization, subcellular localization and function analysis of myeloid differentiation factor 88 (Pt-MyD88) in swimming crab, Portunus trituberculatus.</a></h2><p>Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) is a universal and essential adaptor protein required for the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) pathway activation in invertebrates as well as in vertebrates. Herein, we characterized a MyD88 (Pt-MyD88) cDNA sequence in the swimming crab (Portunus trituberculatus). The Pt-MyD88 ORF is predicted to encode 469 peptides with an N-terminal death domain and a typical C-terminal TIR domain. Real-Time quantitative PCR analysis showed that the Pt-MyD88 transcriptions were constitutively expressed in hemocytes, gill, intestine, heart and muscle in normal crab. The expressions of Pt-MyD88 would be down-regulated by V. alginolyticus or LPS challenge, and be up-regulated by WSSV infection in hemocytes. Intracellular localization showed Pt-MyD88 was distributed mainly in the cytoplasm when it was over-expressed in human cell HEK293T or in Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2). Functionally, over-expression of Pt-MyD88 could either activate the NF-κB in HEK293T cells or activate the promoters of Drosophila antimicrobial peptide genes (AMPs) in S2 cell. In primary cultured hemocytes of swimming crab, after Pt-MyD88 was knocked-down by specific long double strand RNA, the expression of anti-lipopolysaccharide factor1 (ALF1), hyastatin3, crustin1 and crustin3 have been significantly inhibited, while the expression of other AMPs is normal compared to non-specific dsRNA treated cells.Copyright © 2019.

Cord blood samples were retrieved at birth and infants were actively followed for the first 6 months of life. Nasal swabs were collected and tested for influenza A and B by RT-PCR whenever an illness episode was identified. Cord blood samples were tested by the hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay to viruses that circulated during the follow-up period.1162 infants were born to 1140 recruited women: 1092 (94%) infants completed 6 months of follow-up. Proportions of cord blood with HAI antibodies titers ≥40 against A(H1N1), A(H3N2), B/Victoria and B/Yamagata were 31%, 24%, 31% and 54%, respectively. Only 4% of women had maternal influenza vaccination. Cord blood antigen-specific HAI titers ≥40 were found to correlate with protection from infection only for influenza B/Yamagata. No influenza B virus infection occurred in infants ≤60 days of life. Proportional hazards analysis showed that a cord blood HAI titer of 40 was associated with 83% (95% confidence interval: 44%, 95%) reduction in the risk of influenza B/Yamagata infections compared to a cord blood titer <10.We documented that maternal  against influenza B/Yamagata was conferred to infants within the first 6 months of life.© The Author(s) 2019.

We investigated CMV prevention strategies utilized among transplant centers in Thailand.A questionnaire on CMV prevention strategies for kidney transplant (KT) recipients was developed using a web-based electronic survey website (www.surveymonkey.com). The survey was delivered to 31 transplant centers in Thailand. One infectious disease physician (ID) and 1 nephrologist (NP) from each center were included.There were 43 respondents from 26 of the 31 transplant centers (84%), including 26 (60%) IDs and 17 (40%) NPs. Forty-one 95% (41/43) physicians agreed on the necessity of CMV prevention. Of these, 77% (33/43) physicians implemented prevention strategies for their patients. Interventions included preemptive approaches (48%), prophylaxis (45%), hybrid approaches; surveillance after prophylaxis (3%), and CMV-specific -guided approaches (3%). For CMV-seropositive KT recipients, use of preemptive approaches (84%) exceeded prophylaxis (12%). However, 81% of the former preferred targeted prophylaxis in patients receiving antithymocyte globulin therapy. Sixty-five percent and 93% of physicians started preemptive therapy when plasma CMV DNA loads reached 2000 and 3000 copies/mL (1820 and 2730 IU/mL), respectively. A significantly greater percentage of NPs initiated preemptive therapy at a plasma CMV DNA load of 1820 IU/mL compared with IDs (88% vs 50%;  = .02). The most common barrier to prevention strategy implementation was financial inaccessibility of oral valganciclovir (67%) and quantitative CMV DNA testing (12%).Most physicians agreed on a need for preemptive approaches, although prophylaxis was targeted in those receiving intense immunosuppression.

However, it is not clear whether they are associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A hospital-based case-control study, including 862 cases with HCC and 1120 controls, was conducted to assess the effects of 258 SNPs in the coding regions of ADAMTS4 on HCC risk and prognosis. We found that six SNPs in ADAMTS4 were differential distribution between cases and controls via the primary screening analyses; however, only rs538321148 and rs1014509103 polymorphisms were further identified to modify the risk of HCC (odds ratio: 2.73 and 2.95; 95% confidence interval, 2.28-3.29 and 2.43-3.58; P-value, 5.73 × 10 and 1.36 × 10 , respectively). Significant interaction between these two SNPs and two known causes of hepatitis B virus and aflatoxin B1 were also observed. Furthermore, rs538321148 and rs1014509103 polymorphisms were associated not only with clinicopathological features of tumor such as tumor stage and grade, microvessel density, and vessel metastasis, but with poor overall survival. Additionally, these SNPs significantly downregulated ADATMS4 expression in tumor tissues. These data suggest that SNPs in the coding region of ADAMTS4, such as rs538321148 and rs1014509103, may be potential biomarkers for predicting HCC risk and prognosis.© 2019 The Authors.

Here, we performed an in silico based proteome-wide screening for antigenic B-cell derived T-cell epitopes and their following use to design a multi-epitope peptide vaccine that can effectively engage the host immune system against Acinetobacter nosocomialis SSA3 strain. Epitopes of the fimbrial biogenesis outer membrane usher FimD protein: YQQGINNYL and YRTNYTTVG were revealed appropriate for multi-epitope peptide construct designing. This protein has no homology to the host, essential to the pathogen survival and is localized at the pathogen surface. The predicted epitopes have high affinity for the highly expressed DRB*0101 allele in humans based on the lowest IC50 value in MHCPred and have an exo-membrane topology for efficient immune system recognition. The designed multi-epitope peptide vaccine is composed of the mentioned shortlisted antigenic epitopes linked to each other through a GPGPG linker, and an EAAAK linker that joined the multi-epitope peptide to the Cholera B subunit from Vibrio cholera as an adjuvant to increase vaccine construct antigenicity. The vaccine construct was docked and simulated with a transmembrane toll-like receptor (TLR4) that revealed construct stable binding with the TLR4 through the adjuvant, allowing the epitopes exposed to the host immune system essential for generating effective innate and long-lasting adaptive .

Therefore, in our present study, we investigated the functional interplay between -infected DCs and NK cells. Our biochemical and cell biological experiments show that -infected dendritic cells (DCs) display enhanced exosome release. We find that such extracellular vesicles (referred to as dexosomes) do not contain infectious bacterial material but strongly induce IFN-γ production by NK cells. This directly affects  growth in infected target cells. Furthermore, NK cell-released IFN-γ in cooperation with TNF-α and/or dexosomes augments apoptosis of non-infected as well as infected epithelial cells. Thus, the combined effect of dexosomes and pro-inflammatory cytokines restricts  growth and attenuates bacterial subversion of apoptotic host cell death. In conclusion, this provides new insights into the functional cooperation between DCs, dexosomes and NK cells in the early steps of anti-chlamydial defense.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657480>Preschool wheezing diagnosis and management - survey of physicians' and caregivers' perspective.</a></h2><p>Preschool children with wheezing disorders represent a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, and consume disproportionately large amounts of healthcare resources .

These proteins have widespread intracellular localization and play an important role in many biological processes. Rab7 plays a crucial role in the innate immune system of crustaceans. In the present study, we cloned and characterized Rab7 from Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis), designated EsRab7. The full-length of the EsRab7 cDNA sequence is 1,257 bp and contains a 618-bp open reading frame encoding a 205-amino acid polypeptide. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the Rab7 protein was highly conserved during evolution. Quantitative real-time PCR showed the highest tissue expression in muscle, followed by hepatopancreas. EsRab7 was significantly upregulated in hemocytes after stimulation by Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus or Gram-negative Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Further studies showed that EsRab7 knockdown during bacterial stimulation resulted in decreased bacterial phagocytosis. In addition, EsRab7 regulated the expression of antimicrobial peptides via the Toll signaling pathway. Collectively, these results demonstrate that EsRab7 plays critical roles in antimicrobial function in the Chinese mitten crab.Copyright © 2019.

Samples from non-migrant individuals, Danish-born from Danish parents, were included as comparison. Analysis was carried out using multivariate logistic regression.14,561 first time urine samples were included, with E. coli being the most prevalent bacterial pathogen. Of the identified isolates 4,686/11,737 were E. coli among non-migrants and 1,032/2,824 among migrants.Sulfamethoxazol-Trimethoprim resistance was found in 34.3% (350/1020) of E. coli isolates among migrants and 23.2% (1070/4619) among non-migrant patients (Odds ratio (OR) 1.73, 95%CI: 1.47-2.03). Ciprofloxacin resistance was found in 5.8% (36/618) of isolates among migrants and 2.2% (67/3092) among non-migrants (OR 2.20, 95%CI:1.37-3.53). Gentamicin resistance was seen in 10.8% (61/565) and 4.7% (110/2328) of isolates (OR 2.33, 95%CI:1.63-3.34), Cefuroxime resistance in 8.5% (87/1019) and 3.4% (158/4618) (OR 2.40, 95%CI:1.77-3.24), Ampicillin resistance in 51.4% and 40.8% (OR 1.65, 95%CI: 1.42-1.92), and Piperacillin-Tazobactam resistance in 6.9 % (30/432) and 4.2% (65/1532) for migrant and non-migrant patients respectively. When stratifying according to migrant status, family-reunited had higher odds of resistance than refugees for Sulfamethoxazol-Trimethoprim, Gentamicin, and Ampicillin.Prevalence of antibiotic resistance was significantly higher in E. coli isolates among migrants, both refugees and family reunited, than non-migrant patients. Differences could not be explained by comorbidity or income. The results emphasise the importance of urine sample testing in both local-born and migrants before antibiotic start-up and points to the benefit of considering migration to secure individual treatment and equal health outcomes.© International Society of Travel Medicine 2019.

Recently, we established a method to detect CatG activity at the cell surface of natural killer cells by using the activity-based probe MARS116-Bt in flow cytometry. MARS116-Bt consists of biotin, spacer, amino acid sequence, and a phosphonate warhead which binds covalently to the serine amino acid residue within the active center of CatG. Herein, MARS116 was conjugated to 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) in order to limit non-specific signal-to-noise ratio generally resulting from binding of fluorescein-labelled avidin (avidin-FAM) to biotinylated, intracellular proteins; since MARS116-Bt is incubated with avidin-FAM in a second labelling step. MARS116-FAM was capable to detect intracellular CatG activity, in contrast to the control compound MARS116*-FAM which lacks the functional phosphonate warhead crucial for binding to the active-site of CatG and contains a carboxyl group instead. Furthermore, intracellular CatG activity was determined in CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells as well as in T regulatory cell (Treg) subsets.

New data are necessary to understand the key factors involved in the immune system regulation. Six dairy cows were sampled during transition period to investigate the leukocyte transcriptome changes and its relationship with blood biomarkers. Blood samples were collected at - 20 ± 2, - 3 ± 1, 3, and 7 days from parturition (DFP). Leukocyte transcriptome was analyzed by deep sequencing technology (Hiseq1000 Illumina, USA). Plasma was analyzed for metabolic biomarkers. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) were used to run an enrichment analysis through the Dynamic Impact Approach (DIA). Considering - 20 DFP as references time, the main KEGG impacted pathways were activated before calving (- 3 DFP) and were connected to lipid metabolism, lipid transport in plasma, and phagosome. The greatest differences were found after parturition with 281 DEG (179 upregulated and 102 downregulated). The activated pathways were mainly related to  and endocrine aspects, while metabolic pathways related to lipid and amino acid metabolism were inhibited. Plasma BHBA had a substantial inhibitory impact on KEGG pathways related to DNA replication and cell cycle, while plasma IL-1β had an inhibitory impact on fatty acid elongation in mitochondria and an activated impact in several pathways related to cellular energy metabolism.

The excessive use of synthetic agrochemicals, declining soil nutrients, and water-use issues, amongst others, are threats to the ecosystem. Additionally, environmental degradation and an increasing global population that will reach 9 billion by 2030 are further considerations. These issues mean a decline in the volume of food resources available to feed the world. Therefore, sustainably increasing agricultural productivity is a necessity for restoring soil fertility, feeding the populace, and improving the ecosystem. A way to achieve this is by using eco-friendly microbial inoculants. Endophytes inhabit the tissues of plants asymptomatically without causing adverse effects. Bacterial and fungal endophytes benefit plants by promoting growth, suppressing pathogens, and improving the stress tolerance and  of plants. Despite this vital role played by endophytes in their interactions with host plants, there is still a paucity of relevant review data. More importantly, the prospective use of endophytes as an alternative to synthetic agrochemicals to ensure agro-ecological crop productivity has not been well reviewed in the literature.

However, there is a paucity of data on severe typhoid fever and its associated acute and chronic host immune response and carriage. The Severe Typhoid Fever in Africa (SETA) program, a multicountry surveillance study, aimed to address these research gaps and contribute to the control and prevention of invasive salmonellosis.A prospective healthcare facility-based surveillance with active screening of enteric fever and clinically suspected severe typhoid fever with complications was performed using a standardized protocol across the study sites in Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Ethiopia, Ghana, Madagascar, and Nigeria. Defined inclusion criteria were used for screening of eligible patients for enrollment into the study. Enrolled patients with confirmed invasive salmonellosis by blood culture or patients with clinically suspected severe typhoid fever with perforation were eligible for clinical follow-up. Asymptomatic neighborhood controls and immediate household contacts of each case were enrolled as a comparison group to assess the level of Salmonella-specific antibodies and shedding patterns. Healthcare utilization surveys were performed to permit adjustment of incidence estimations. Postmortem questionnaires were conducted in medically underserved areas to assess death attributed to invasive Salmonella infections in selected sites.Research data generated through SETA aimed to address scientific knowledge gaps concerning the severe typhoid fever and mortality, long-term host immune responses, and bacterial shedding and carriage associated with natural infection by invasive salmonellae.SETA supports public health policy on typhoid immunization strategy in Africa.© The Author(s) 2019.

Here we show that our original s17 syn+ stock was a mixed population from which we have isolated a minor variant that, unlike other strains in the laboratory, fails to be efficiently released from infected cells and spreads predominantly by direct cell-to-cell transmission. Analysis of other s17-derived viruses that had been isolated elsewhere revealed a number with the same release phenotype. Second-generation sequencing of 8 plaque-purified s17-derived viruses revealed sequences that vary by 50 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including approximately 10 coding SNPs. This compared to interstrain variations of around 800 SNPs in strain Sc16, of which a quarter were coding changes. Amongst the variations found within s17, we identified 13 variants of glycoprotein C within the original stock of virus that were predominantly a consequence of altered homopolymeric runs of C residues. Characterization of seven isolates coding for different forms of gC indicated that all were expressed, despite six of them lacking a transmembrane domain. While the release phenotype did not correlate directly with any of these identified gC variations, further demonstration that nine clinical isolates of HSV1 also fail to spread through extracellular release raises the possibility that propagation in tissue culture had altered the HSV1 s17 transmission phenotype. Hence, the s17 intrastrain variation identified here offers an excellent model for understanding both HSV1 transmission and tissue culture adaptation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663136>Prognostic role of the lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio for clinical outcomes of patients with progressive radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid carcinoma treated by sorafenib.</a></h2><p>The lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) reflects the status of tumor-infiltrating immune cells and host .

There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the groups. The OS curves differed significantly based on the LMR. The median OS of the low LMR group was 24.3 months and that of the high LMR group was not reached until the end of observation period (P = 0.015). The PFS curves and median PFS also differed significantly based on the LMR values (P = 0.019). In multivariate analysis, low LMR was an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality in patients with progressive RAIR DTC (hazard ratio, 2.64; 95% confidence interval: 1.04-6.72, P = 0.041).A low LMR was associated with poor response rate, PFS, and OS in patients with progressive RAIR DTC treated with sorafenib.

Nonetheless, little insight exists on other immune subsets involved in the cardiotoxic response.  Here we used single-cell RNA sequencing to map the cardiac immune composition in the standard murine non-ischemic, pressure-overload HF model. By focusing our analysis on CD45 cells, we obtained a higher resolution identification of the immune cell subsets in the heart, at early and late stages of disease and in controls. We then integrated our findings using multi-parameter flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry and tissue clarification immunofluorescence, in mouse and human.  We found that most major immune cell subpopulations, including macrophages, B cells, T cells and regulatory T cells (Treg), dendritic cells, NK cells, neutrophils and mast cells are present in both healthy and diseased hearts. Most cell subsets are found within the myocardium, whilst mast cells are found also in the epicardium. Upon induction of pressure overload, immune activation occurs across the entire range of immune cell types. Activation led to upregulation of key subset-specific molecules, such as Osm in pro-inflammatory macrophages and PD-1 in Treg, that may help explain clinical findings such as the refractivity of HF patients to anti-TNF therapy and cardiac toxicity during anti-PD-1 cancer immunotherapy, respectively.  Despite the absence of infectious agents or an autoimmune trigger, induction of disease leads to immune activation that involves far more cell types than previously thought, including neutrophils, B cells, NK cells and mast cells. This opens up the field of cardio-immunology to further investigation using toolkits that have already been developed to study the immune subsets above. The subset-specific molecules that mediate their activation may thus become useful targets for diagnostics or therapy of HF.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665078>Inflammatory cytokines and organ dysfunction associate with the aberrant DNA methylome of monocytes in sepsis.</a></h2><p>Sepsis, a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated systemic immune response to infection, associates with reduced responsiveness to subsequent infections. How such tolerance is acquired is not well understood but is known to involve epigenetic and transcriptional dysregulation.Bead arrays were used to compare global DNA methylation changes in patients with sepsis, non-infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and healthy controls. Bioinformatic analyses were performed to dissect functional reprogramming and signaling pathways related to the acquisition of these specific DNA methylation alterations. Finally, in vitro experiments using human monocytes were performed to test the induction of similar DNA methylation reprogramming.Here, we focused on DNA methylation changes associated with sepsis, given their potential role in stabilizing altered phenotypes. Tolerized monocytes from patients with sepsis display changes in their DNA methylomes with respect to those from healthy controls, affecting critical monocyte-related genes. DNA methylation profiles correlate with IL-10 and IL-6 levels, significantly increased in monocytes in sepsis, as well as with the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score; the observed changes associate with TFs and pathways downstream to toll-like receptors and inflammatory cytokines. In fact, in vitro stimulation of toll-like receptors in monocytes results in similar gains and losses of methylation together with the acquisition of tolerance.We have identified a DNA methylation signature associated with sepsis that is downstream to the response of monocytes to inflammatory signals associated with the acquisition of a tolerized phenotype and organic dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653482>Genome-wide Analyses of Chromatin State in Human Mast Cells Reveal Molecular Drivers and Mediators of Allergic and Inflammatory Diseases.</a></h2><p>Mast cells (MCs) are versatile immune cells capable of rapidly responding to a diverse range of extracellular cues. Here, we mapped the genomic and transcriptomic changes in human MCs upon diverse stimuli. Our analyses revealed broad H3K4me3 domains and enhancers associated with activation. Notably, the rise of intracellular calcium concentration upon immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated crosslinking of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) resulted in genome-wide reorganization of the chromatin landscape and was associated with a specific chromatin signature, which we term Ca-dependent open chromatin (COC) domains. Examination of differentially expressed genes revealed potential effectors of MC function, and we provide evidence for fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2) as an MC mediator with potential relevance in chronic spontaneous urticaria. Disease-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms mapped onto cis-regulatory regions of human MCs suggest that MC function may impact a broad range of pathologies. The datasets presented here constitute a resource for the further study of MC function.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Nevertheless, the phytoalexins of Asian pine trees are ineffective against B. xylophilus. The anti-phytoalexin genes of B. xylophilus disable almost all Asian pine phytoalexins, which has allowed B. xylophilus to devastate pine forests in eastern Asia over the last four decades. However, to date, the factors that stimulate anti-phytoalexin gene expression and the mechanisms by which these genes act are not well understood.Here, we described anti-phytoalexin genes in B. xylophilus using transcriptomic and bioinformatics analyses. The genes that were induced by both Pinus massoniana and carvone and had similarly elevated expression trends were considered anti-phytoalexin genes. Altogether, 187 anti-phytoalexin genes were identified, including 4 cathepsin genes. KEGG pathway enrichment indicated that those cathepsins were related to the Lysosome pathway. Since cathepsins help to maintain metabolic homeostasis by participating in the degradation of heterophagic and autophagic material, the lysosomal cathepsin gene Bx-cathepsin W was cloned and characterized. The results of the RNAi assessment indicated that the knockdown of Bx-cathepsin W reduced the survival rates of B. xylophilus under carvone or P. massoniana stress. The correlation between Bx-cathepsin W and the susceptibility of pines showed that Bx-cathepsin W might help improve the anti-phytotoxin ability of B. xylophilus.The results indicated that the anti-phytoalexin gene Bx-cathepsin W supported the survival of B. xylophilus under P. massoniana phytoalexin stress. The cDNA library sequencing, differentially expressed gene identification, and WGCNA algorithm analysis provided insight at a systemic level into the gene regulation of B. xylophilus in response to the immune reaction of P. massoniana.

We retrieved 30 cases with established CMV infection post-splenectomy and we recorded their disease manifestations, laboratory findings, immunological studies, and histopathology reports. In addition, we retrieved numerous multidisciplinary articles in view of post-splenectomy immunology defects, as well as of immune responses to primary invading CMV in the absence of the spleen. Two clinical studies directly comparing splenectomized with nonsplenectomized individuals under severe iatrogenic immunosuppression as well as the numerically largest review articles of CMV infections in immunocompetent were retained.Splenectomy results in the loss of spleen's ability to fend-off blood-borne pathogens and impairs the link between innate and adaptive . The major post-splenectomy immune-defects against CMV are: weakened, delayed or absent anti-CMV IgM, and compensatory marked IgG response; severely impaired B-cell and CD4, CD8 T-cells function responses; and post-splenectomy, bone marrow compensates for the absence of spleen's immune responses against CMV, mimicking a monoclonal T-cell lymphoproliferative process.The puzzled diagnosis of the CMV syndrome post-splenectomy is of the most challenging and misleading, resulting in risky and costly interventions and a subsequent prolonged hospitalization (2 months).

Here, we solved the high-resolution crystal structures of E165R in its apo state and in complex with its product dUMP. Structural analysis explicitly defined the architecture of the active site of the enzyme as well as the interaction between the active site and the dUMP ligand. By comparing the ASFV E165R structure with dUTPase structures from other species, we found that the active site of E165R is highly similar to those of dUTPases from  and , against which small-molecule chemicals have been developed, which could be the potential drug or lead compound candidates for ASFV. Our results provide important basis for anti-ASFV drug design by targeting E165R. African swine fever virus (ASFV), an  affecting pigs and wild boars with up to 100% case fatality rate, is currently rampaging throughout China and some other countries in Asia. There is an urgent need to develop therapeutic and preventive reagents against the virus. Our crystallographic and biochemical studies reveal that ASFV E165R is a member of trimeric dUTP nucleotidohydrolase (dUTPase) family that catalyzes the hydrolysis of dUTP into dUMP. Our apo-E165R and E165R-dUMP structures reveal the constitutive residues and the configuration of the active center of this enzyme in rich detail and give evidence that the active center of E165R is very similar to that of dUTPases from  and , which have already been used as targets for designing drugs. Therefore, our high-resolution structures of E165R provide useful structural information for chemotherapeutic drug design.Copyright © 2019 Li et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664039>Unstable TTTTA/TTTCA expansions in MARCH6 are associated with Familial Adult Myoclonic Epilepsy type 3.</a></h2><p>Familial Adult Myoclonic Epilepsy (FAME) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by cortical tremor and seizures. Intronic TTTTA/TTTCA repeat expansions in SAMD12 (FAME1) are the main cause of FAME in Asia. Using genome sequencing and repeat-primed PCR, we identify another site of this repeat expansion, in MARCH6 (FAME3) in four European families. Analysis of single DNA molecules with nanopore sequencing and molecular combing show that expansions range from 3.3 to 14 kb on average. However, we observe considerable variability in expansion length and structure, supporting the existence of multiple expansion configurations in blood cells and fibroblasts of the same individual. Moreover, the largest expansions are associated with micro-rearrangements occurring near the expansion in 20% of cells. This study provides further evidence that FAME is caused by intronic TTTTA/TTTCA expansions in distinct genes and reveals that expansions exhibit an unexpectedly high somatic instability that can ultimately result in genomic rearrangements.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650954>Predictors of SIV recrudescence following antiretroviral treatment interruption.</a></h2><p>There is currently a need for proxy measures of the HIV rebound competent reservoir (RCR) that can predict viral rebound after combined antiretroviral treatment (cART) interruption. In this study, macaques infected with a barcoded SIVmac239 virus received cART beginning between 4- and 27-days post-infection, leading to the establishment of different levels of viral dissemination and persistence. Later treatment initiation led to higher SIV DNA levels maintained during treatment, which was significantly associated with an increased frequency of SIV reactivation and production of progeny capable of causing rebound viremia following treatment interruption. However, a 100-fold increase in SIV DNA in PBMCs was associated with only a 2-fold increase in the frequency of reactivation. These data suggest that the RCR can be established soon after infection, and that a large fraction of persistent viral DNA that accumulates after this time makes relatively little contribution to viral rebound.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658677>The Interplay between Dengue Virus and the Human Innate Immune System: A Game of Hide and Seek.</a></h2><p>With 40% of the world population at risk, infections with dengue virus (DENV) constitute a serious threat to public health. While there is no antiviral therapy available against this potentially lethal disease, the efficacy of the only approved vaccine is not optimal and its safety has been recently questioned. In order to develop better vaccines based on attenuated and/or chimeric viruses, one must consider how the human immune system is engaged during DENV infection. The activation of the innate  through the detection of viruses by cellular sensors is the first line of defence against those pathogens. This triggers a cascade of events which establishes an antiviral state at the cell level and leads to a global immunological response. However, DENV has evolved to interfere with the innate immune signalling at multiple levels, hence dampening antiviral responses and favouring viral replication and dissemination. This review elaborates on the interplay between DENV and the innate immune system. A special focus is given on the viral countermeasure mechanisms reported over the last decade which should be taken into consideration during vaccine development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661784>Comparative Transcriptomic Analysis of the Interaction between  and Apple Fruit ( Mill.) during Early Stages of Infection.</a></h2><p>Blue mold, caused by , is an important postharvest disease of apple, and can result in significant economic losses.

Active clinical and environmental surveillance systems with meticulous laboratory investigations provide insights into poliovirus transmission patterns and genomic diversity to inform decisions for strategic operations required to achieve eradication.We analyzed epidemiological and virological data at molecular level to comprehend the current epidemiological status of WPV1 in Pakistan during 2015-2017. Stool specimens of AFP patients and sewage samples collected from 60 active environmental sites. Viral culturing, intratypic differentiation by real time-PCR and nucleic acid sequencing of VP1 region of poliovirus genome to determine the genetic relatedness among WPV1 strains were applied. The phylogenetic analysis were done using BEAST v2.3.0 [1] .Poliovirus isolates were grouped into eleven distinct clusters which had ≥95% nucleotide homology in VP1 coding region. Most burden of poliovirus was shared by three major reservoirs i.e. Karachi, Peshawar and Quetta block (64.2% in 2015; 75.4% in 2016 and 76.7% in 2017).Environmental surveillance reveals importations and pockets of unimmunized children which dictate intensive target mop-up campaigns in such areas to contain poliovirus transmission. Decrease in number of orphan isolates reflects effective combination of AFP and ES surveillance working in Pakistan. The genetic data reflects sustained transmission within reservoir areas, further expanded by periodic importations to areas of high  reflected by immediate termination of imported viruses. However, it is suggestive that Pakistan is at-risk unless the entire country including Afghanistan attain a polio-free status.

Infection with a blast fungus induces biological responses in the host plant that lead to its survival through the termination or suppression of pathogen growth, and metabolite compounds play vital roles in plant interactions with a wide variety of other organisms. Numerous studies have indicated that rice has a multi-layered plant immune system that includes pre-developed (e.g., cell wall and phytoanticipins), constitutive and inducible (phytoalexins) defence barriers against stresses. Significant progress towards understanding the basis of the molecular mechanisms underlying the defence responses of rice to P. oryzae has been achieved. Nonetheless, even though the important metabolites in the responses of rice to pathogens have been identified, their exact mechanisms and their contributions to plant  against blast fungi have not been elucidated. The purpose of this review is to summarize and discuss recent advances towards the understanding of the integrated metabolite variations in rice after P. oryzae invasion.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DKK1, LRP5, LRP6, and SOST genes were genotyped in 673 AS patients and 687 healthy controls by using SNPs can Technic. Single marker genetic association analysis was performed. Haplotypes were constructed after linkage disequilibrium analysis; additive, multiplicative, and higher-order interactions were analysed.  The DKK1 gene rs1569198 polymorphism was significantly associated with AS susceptibility in females ( = 4.55,  = .03), but the association disappeared after Bonferroni correction.

AML with mutated NPM1 is recognised as a separate entity in the World Health Organisation 2016 classification, and carries a relatively favourable prognosis. NPM1 mutations are predominantly 4 bp duplications or insertions in the terminal exon that arise through an unknown mechanism. Here we analyse 2430 NPM1 mutations from 2329 adult and 101 pediatric patients to address their origin. We show that NPM1 mutations display the hallmarks of replication slippage, but lack suitable germline microhomology available for priming. Insertion mutations display G/C-rich N-nucleotide tracts, with a significant bias towards polypurine and polypyrimidine stacking (p < 0.001). These features suggest terminal deoxyucleotidyl transferase (TdT) primes replication slippage through N-nucleotide addition, with longer syntheses manifesting as N-regions. The recurrent Type A, Type D and Type B mutations require 1, 2 and 3 N-nucleotide extensions of T, CC and CAT respectively, with the last nucleotide used as occult microhomology. This TdT-mutator model successfully predicts the relative incidence of the 256 potential 4bp insertion/duplication mutations at position c.863_864 over four orders of magnitude (rho = 0.484, p < 0.0001). Children have a different NPM1 mutation spectrum to adults, including a shift away from Type A mutations and towards longer N-regions, consistent with higher TdT activity in pediatric myeloid stem cells. These findings complement our FLT3-ITD data, suggesting illegitimate TdT activity contributes to around half of AMLs.

This includes tumor mutations that generate neo-antigenic epitopes that elicit cytotoxic T-cell activity and subsequent pressure to select for genetic loss of antigen presentation. Most studies have focused on how tumor missense mutations can drive tumor , but frameshift mutations have the potential to create far greater antigenic diversity. However, expression of this antigenic diversity is potentially regulated by Nonsense Mediated Decay (NMD) and NMD has been shown to be of variable efficiency in cancers. Here we studied how mutational changes influence global NMD and cytolytic immune responses. Using TCGA datasets, we derived novel patient-level metrics of 'NMD burden' and interrogated how different mutation and most importantly NMD burdens influence cytolytic activity using machine learning models and survival outcomes. We find that NMD is a significant and independent predictor of immune cytolytic activity. Different indications exhibited varying dependence on NMD and mutation burden features. We also observed significant co-alteration of genes in the NMD pathway, with a global increase in NMD efficiency in patients with NMD co-alterations. Finally, NMD burden also stratified patient survival in multivariate regression models in subset of cancer types. Our work suggests that beyond selecting for mutations that elicit NMD in tumor suppressors, tumor evolution may react to the selective pressure generated by inflammation to globally enhance NMD through coordinated amplification and/or mutation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655797>Overexpression of steroid sulfotransferase genes is associated with worsened prognosis and with immune exclusion in clear cell-renal cell carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Steroid sulfotransferase (SULT) plays physiological roles but its role in clear cell-renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) remains unclear. We therefore investigated genetic alteration of steroid SULT genes in ccRCC.Overexpression of any of SULT genes occurred in ~8% of ccRCC patients. Overexpression of steroid SULT genes was associated with worsened prognosis. Steroid SULT gene-upregulated ccRCC cases showed mutual exclusivity with mutations of VHL, SETD2 and PBRM1, and with focal deletions of 3p and 9p, respectively. Expressions of SULT genes were negatively correlated with that of VHL, SETD2 and PBRM1, respectively. While no cancer-intrinsic pathway was enriched, immune signatures were significantly enriched in SULT gene-overexpressed cases, resulting in significantly fewer infiltration of lymphocytes. Targeting SULT1B1 significantly inhibited growth of ccRCC cells.Steroid SULT genes were associated with worsened prognosis and with immune exclusion in ccRCC.In silico reproduction of TGGA and GTEx datasets was performed.

Vitamin D has anti-inflammatory and anti-Th1, Th17 activities, activates the function of regulatory T cells, shifts the immune response towards Th2, so it might be favorable for downregulation of the disease pathogenesis, and if inflammation and Th1 and Th17  are hyperactivated. The aim of our study was to highlight the role of vitamin D in multiple sclerosis pathogenesis.We investigated 178 patients with multiple sclerosis. Plasma levels of 25(OH)D and HMGB1 were investigated.Despite a regular use of VD by patients, the plasma levels of 25(0H)D were significantly decreased in 57% of them, 14.1% had VD deficiency (level of 25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL) and more than 6 % of patients had VD severe deficiency with the plasma level of 25(OH)D < 12 ng/mL. The level of 25(OH)D negatively correlated with the severity of the disease (EDSS, index of progression, duration of the disease) and negative association was found also with Herbert´s six severity grades. HMGB1 levels were higher in patients (p < 0.0001).Our result showed that vitamin D deficiency plays a role in multiple sclerosis pathogenesis. We believe that administration of vitamin D to patients at a sufficient dose providing a physiological level of vitamin D could have a positive effect on the course of the disease.

However, many novel "non-canonical" functions, alternative substrates, and regulatory mechanisms have been described and are being continuously elucidated. The activity of LOXs, therefore, appears to be integrated into a complex network of signals regulating many cell functions, including survival/proliferation/differentiation. Among these signaling pathways, TGF-β and PI3K/Akt/mTOR, in particular, cross-talk extensively with each other and with LOXs also initiating complex feedback loops which modulate the activity of LOXs and direct the remodeling of the ECM. A growing body of evidence indicates that LOXs are not only important in the homeostasis of the normal structure of the ECM, but are also implicated in the establishment and maturation of the tumor microenvironment. LOXs' association with advanced and metastatic cancer is well established; however, there is enough evidence to support a significant role of LOXs in the transformation of normal epithelial cells, in the accelerated tumor development and the induction of invasion of the premalignant epithelium. A better understanding of LOXs and their interactions with the different elements of the tumor immune microenvironment will prove invaluable in the design of novel anti-tumor strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653912>Antitumor  augments the therapeutic effects of p53 activation on acute myeloid leukemia.</a></h2><p>The negative regulator of p53, MDM2, is frequently overexpressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that retains wild-type TP53 alleles. Targeting of p53-MDM2 interaction to reactivate p53 function is therefore an attractive therapeutic approach for AML. Here we show that an orally active inhibitor of p53-MDM2 interaction, DS-5272, causes dramatic tumor regressions of MLL-AF9-driven AML in vivo with a tolerable toxicity. However, the antileukemia effect of DS-5272 is markedly attenuated in immunodeficient mice, indicating the critical impact of systemic immune responses that drive p53-mediated leukemia suppression. In relation to this, DS-5272 triggers immune-inflammatory responses in MLL-AF9 cells including upregulation of Hif1α and PD-L1, and inhibition of the Hif1α-PD-L1 axis sensitizes AML cells to p53 activation.

We sought to understand how acquired cellular and humoral  to the microbiota differ in health versus inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).Resident memory T-cells (Trm) in colonic biopsies and local antibody responses to intraepithelial microbes were analyzed. Systemic antigen-specific immune T- and B-cell memory to a panel of commensal microbes was assessed.Systemically, healthy blood showed CD4 and occasional CD8 memory T-cell responses to selected intestinal bacteria but few memory B-cell responses. In IBD, CD8 memory T-cell responses decreased although B-cell responses and circulating plasmablasts increased. Possibly secondary to loss of systemic CD8 T-cell responses in IBD, dramatically reduced numbers of mucosal CD8+ Trm and γδ T-cells were observed. IgA responses to intraepithelial bacteria were increased. Colonic Trm expressed CD39 and CD73 ectonucleotidases, characteristic of regulatory T-cells. Cytokines/factors required for Trm differentiation were identified, and in vitro-generated Trm expressed regulatory T-cell function via CD39. Cognate interaction between T-cells and dendritic cells induced T-bet expression in dendritic cells, a key mechanism in regulating cell-mediated mucosal responses.A previously unrecognized imbalance exists between cellular and humoral  to the microbiota in IBD, with loss of mucosal T-cell-mediated barrier  and uncontrolled antibody responses. Regulatory function of Trm may explain their association with intestinal health. Promoting Trm and their interaction with dendritic cells rather than immunosuppression may reinforce tissue , improve barrier function and prevent B-cell dysfunction in microbiota-associated disease and IBD etiology.© European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653484>Structural Basis for Broad HIV-1 Neutralization by the MPER-Specific Human Broadly Neutralizing Antibody LN01.</a></h2><p>Potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) are the hallmark of HIV-1 protection by vaccination.

The tilted TM orientation allows LN01 to interact simultaneously with the peptidic component of the MPER epitope and membrane via two specific lipid binding sites of the antibody paratope. Although LN01 carries a high load of somatic mutations, most key residues interacting with the MPER epitope and lipids are germline encoded, lending support for the LN01 epitope as a candidate for lineage-based vaccine development.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Previous research has largely focused on protein transport, but, which other molecules function in communication, and how they are transported remains under explored. Recent studies discovered that small RNAs (sRNAs) are transported between plants and pathogens, which can silence target genes in the interacting organisms and regulate host  and pathogen infection, a mechanism called 'cross-kingdom RNA interference (RNAi)'. Further studies indicate that plant extracellular vesicles (EVs) are essential for sRNA trafficking and host-pathogen communication. This review will focus on the latest advances in our understanding of plant EVs and their roles in transporting regulatory molecules, especially sRNAs, between hosts and pathogens.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, nothing is known about the potential interplay between Tregs and HCV. In this pilot study, we have investigated the ability of Tregs to hang HCV on and the subsequent effect on their suppressive function and phenotype. Moreover, we have evaluated how HCV could promote the recruitment of Tregs by infected primary human hepatocytes.Tregs of healthy donors were incubated with JFH-1/HCVcc. Viral inoculation was assessed using adapted assays (RT-qPCR, Flow Citometry (FACS) and Western Blot (WB). Expression of Tregs phenotypic (CD4, CD25, CD127 and Foxp3) and functional (IL-10, GZMB, TGF-β1 and IL-2) markers was monitored by RT-qPCR, FACS and ELISA. Suppressive activity was validated by suppressive assays. Tregs recruitment by infected primary hepatic cells was evaluated using Boyden Chamber.Tregs express the classical HCV receptors (CD81, CLDN1 and LDLR) and some co-receptors (CD5). HCV inoculation significantly increases the suppressive phenotype and activity of Tregs, and raises their anergy by inducing an unexpected IL-2 production. Moreover, HCV infection induces the expression of chemokines (CCL17, CXCL16, and CCL20) by primary hepatic human hepatocytes and chemokine receptors (CCR4, CXCR6 and CCR6) by Tregs. Finally, infected hepatocytes have a significantly higher potential to recruit Tregs in a seemingly CCL20-dependent manner.Direct interaction between HCV and Tregs represents a newly defined mechanism that could potentiate HCV immune evasion and favor intratumoral recruitment contributing to HCC progression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657345>[Progress in programmed death-1 signaling pathway in sepsis].</a></h2><p>Sepsis includes a highly diverse and dynamic mixture of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome (CARS). In the past, drugs produced to block the early inflammatory response had little effect on reversing the development of sepsis. Recent studies have shown that the mortality and prognosis of patients are significantly correlated with the immunosuppression of sepsis and the overexpression of co-inhibitory molecules. Programmed death-1 (PD-1) is a recently focused co-inhibitory molecule, which can regulate the functions of a variety of immune cells and participate in innate  and acquired . It has important value in risk stratification and prognosis prediction of patients with sepsis, and can be used as one of the intervention targets for immune regulation in sepsis in the future. The role of PD-1 signaling pathway in immunosuppression and its effect on patients' prognosis is reviewed in this article, providing new directions for the treatment of sepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653122>Effects of Regulatory T Cell Depletion on NK Cell Responses against  in Feline Immunodeficiency Virus Infected Cats.</a></h2><p>Regulatory T cells (Treg) are key players in the maintenance of peripheral tolerance, preventing autoimmune diseases and restraining chronic inflammatory diseases. Evidence suggests Treg cells and NK cells have important roles in feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) pathogenesis; however, in vivo studies investigating the interplay between these two cell populations are lacking. We previously described innate immune defects in FIV-infected cats characterized by cytokine deficits and impaired natural killer cell (NK) and NK T cell (NKT) functions. In this study, we investigated whether in vivo Treg depletion by treatment with an anti-feline CD25 monoclonal antibody would improve the innate immune response against subcutaneous challenge with  (Lm). Treg depletion resulted in an increased overall number of cells in Lm-draining lymph nodes and increased proliferation of NK and NKT cells in FIV-infected cats. Treg depletion did not normalize expression of perforin or granzyme A by NK and NKT cells, nor did Treg depletion result in improved clearance of Lm. Thus, despite the quantitative improvements in the NK and NKT cell responses to Lm, there was no functional improvement in the early control of Lm. CD1a+ dendritic cell percentages in the lymph nodes of FIV-infected cats were lower than in specific-pathogen-free control cats and failed to upregulate CD80 even when Treg were depleted. Taken together, Treg depletion failed to improve the innate immune response of FIV-infected cats against Lm and this may be due to dendritic cell dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652599>Additional Evidence on Serological Correlates of Protection against Measles: An Observational Cohort Study among Once Vaccinated Children Exposed to Measles.</a></h2><p>To assess correlates of protection against measles and against subclinical measles virus (MV) infection, we recruited once-vaccinated children from geographic regions associated with increased MV circulation and/or at schools with low vaccination coverage in the Netherlands. Paired blood samples were collected shortly after onset of the measles outbreak and after the outbreak. A questionnaire was used to document the likelihood of exposure to MV and occurrence of measles-like symptoms. All blood samples were tested for MV-specific antibodies with five different assays. Correlates of protection were assessed by considering the lowest neutralizing antibody levels in children without MV infection, and by ROC analyses. Among 91 participants, two seronegative children (2%) developed measles, and an additional 19 (23%) experienced subclinical MV infection. The correlate of protection against measles was lower than 0.345 IU/mL. We observed a decreasing attack rate of subclinical MV infection with increasing levels of specific antibodies until 2.1 IU/mL, above which no subclinical MV infections were detected. The ROC analyses found a correlate of protection of 1.71 IU/mL (95% CI 1.01-2.11) for subclinical MV infection. Our correlates of protection were consistent with previous estimates. This information supports the analyses of serosurveys to detect  gaps that require targeted intervention strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654315>Age-related differences in physiology and survival of northern red-backed voles (Myodes rutilus) in captivity.</a></h2><p>Age-related deterioration of physiological functions is one of the most evident manifestations of ageing. In wild populations of some species, including murid rodents, lifespans are substantially modified by environmental signals that affect an individual's response to such challenges as unfavourable climatic conditions, parasitic load etc. But the real impact of ageing on natural mortality of most species remains obscure. To clarify how age affects the responsiveness of organisms to environmental challenges, we performed longitudinal laboratory observations of wild-derived northern red-backed voles (Myodes rutilus). We fixed individual longevity and measured metabolic indexes (basal and maximal metabolic rates), ability to maintain body temperature under acute cooling, plasma corticosterone, indexes of acquired and innate  in the same individuals of 3-4, 6-7 and 9-10 months old. The maximum estimated lifespan was about 2 years 8 months, which is considerably older than in nature, but less than 30% of individuals passed the one-year milestone. Regardless of the intense mortality, in the first year of life, animals did not demonstrate any age-related deterioration in physiological functions, except leucocyte number. No consistency in any individual physiological index was found. As the individual longevity of red-backed voles varied between years of captivity, we suggest that the welfare and lifespan of wild animals in captivity may be affected by the environmental conditions in the period preceding removal of the animal from the wild.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657973>Inflammatory bowel diseases: interrelationships between dietary vitamin D, exposure to UV radiation and the faecal microbiome.</a></h2><p>: Environmental factors and an altered faecal microbiome are believed to be central to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Vitamin D and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) are environmental factors that are associated by several pathways, including changes to the gastrointestinal microbiome, with the development and course of IBD. : This review explores the interaction of vitamin D, and UVR, with the intestinal innate and adaptive immune systems, and how they may influence the gut microbiome and the subsequent development, and progression, of IBD. : Vitamin D and UVR both regulate innate and adaptive  through a combination of common and independent mechanisms, with the overall effect being the promotion of immune tolerance. Vitamin D, and to a lesser extent UVR, can modify the gastrointestinal microbiome either directly, or through immune-mediated mechanisms and this may explain the effect on intestinal inflammation in animal models of IBD and some clinical studies. Thus, both vitamin D and UVR exposure can be considered potential "master regulators" of gastrointestinal , fine-tuning the complex interaction between genetics, host  and the gut microbiome. Further research and increased understanding of environment-host interactions is essential to achieving the ultimate goal of preventing and curing IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653097>Special Issue "IFN-Independent ISG Expression and its Role in Antiviral Cell-Intrinsic Innate ".</a></h2><p>Over the last few decades, accumulating evidence has demonstrated that numerous Interferon(IFN) stimulate genes (ISGs) can be directly upregulated following virus infection independent ofIFN signaling [...].</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658667>Revising PTEN in the Era of Immunotherapy: New Perspectives for an Old Story.</a></h2><p>Immunotherapy has emerged as the new therapeutic frontier of cancer treatment, showing enormous survival benefits in multiple tumor diseases. Although undeniable success has been observed in clinical trials, not all patients respond to treatment. Different concurrent conditions can attenuate or completely abrogate the usefulness of immunotherapy due to the activation of several escape mechanisms. Indeed, the tumor microenvironment has an almost full immunosuppressive profile, creating an obstacle to therapeutic treatment. Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) governs a plethora of cellular processes, including maintenance of genomic stability, cell survival/apoptosis, migration, and metabolism. The repertoire of PTEN functions has recently been expanded to include regulation of the tumor microenvironment and immune system, leading to a drastic reevaluation of the canonical paradigm of PTEN action with new potential implications for immunotherapy-based approaches. Understanding the implication of PTEN in cancer immunoediting and immune evasion is crucial to develop new cancer intervention strategies. Recent evidence has shown a double context-dependent role of PTEN in anticancer . Here we summarize the current knowledge of PTEN's role at a crossroads between tumor and immune compartments, highlighting the most recent findings that are likely to change future clinical practice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657540>Task-Specific Design of Immune-Augmented Nanoplatform to Enable High-Efficiency Tumor Immunotherapy.</a></h2><p>Potentiating systemic  against breast cancer is in the most urgent demand as breast cancer is low sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Although phototherapy and some chemotherapy can trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD) for T cell-mediated antitumor immune response, their immunotherapy efficacy is severely restricted by insufficient phototherapeutic capability and severe multidrug resistance (MDR). Inspired by both the hypersensitivity to phototherapy and the key role in MDR for mitochondria, a rationally engineered  amplifier via mitochondria-targeted photo-chemotherapeutic nanoparticles was, for the first time, achieved to fight against low-immunogenic breast cancer without additional immune agent. The newly synthesized task-specific mitochondria-targeted IR780 derivative (T780) was integrated with chemotherapeutic doxorubicin (DOX) to form multifunctional nanoparticles via assembling strategy along with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as biomimetic corona (BSA@T780/DOX NPs). The in situ enhancement in both phototherapy and MDR reversal by targeting mitochondria with BSA@T780/DOX NPs boosted high-efficient ICD toward excellent antitumor immune response. The newly developed strategy not only eradicated the primary tumor, but also eliminated the bilateral tumors efficiently, as well as preventing metastasis and postsurgical recurrence, demonstrating great interest for fighting against low-immunogenic breast cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659021>An onboard checking mechanism ensures effector delivery of the type VI secretion system in .</a></h2><p>The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a lethal yet energetically costly weapon in gram-negative bacteria. Through contraction of a long sheath, the T6SS ejects a few copies of effectors accompanied by hundreds of structural carrier proteins per delivery. The few ejected effectors, however, dictate T6SS functions. It remains elusive how the T6SS ensures effector loading and avoids futile ejection. Here, by systemically mutating the active sites of 3  effectors, TseL, VasX, and VgrG3, we show that the physical presence but not their activities is crucial for T6SS assembly. We constructed catalytic mutants of TseL and VgrG3 and truncated VasX mutants. These mutations abolished the killing of the effector-cognate  mutants. We determined that the VasX-mediated antimicrobial activity is solely dependent on the C-terminal colicin domain. Removal of the colicin domain abolished VasX secretion and reduced T6SS assembly, while deletion of the colicin internal loop abolished its toxicity but had little effect on secretion and assembly. The triple effector-inactive mutant maintains an active T6SS that is capable of delivering chimeric VgrG, PAAR, and TseL proteins fused with a cargo nuclease, indicating effector activities are not required for T6SS assembly or penetration into the cytosol of recipient cells. Therefore, by recruiting effectors as critical components for T6SS assembly, it represents an effective onboard checking mechanism that ensures effectors are loaded in place to prevent futile secretion. Our study also demonstrates a detoxified secretion platform by inactivating native effector activities that could translocate engineered cargo proteins via multiple routes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657805>The clinical utility of three visual attention tests to distinguish adults with ADHD from normal controls.</a></h2><p>Adult patients with ADHD may go unrecognised and undiagnosed. This can result in psychosocial and functional decline.To investigate the clinical use of three objective computerised tests in the diagnosis of adult patients with ADHD.Case-control study.aged 18-65, ADHD diagnosis; exclusion criteria: visual impairments, colour vision deficiencies, acute mental illness, amnesia, and learning difficulties. ADHD was diagnosed with Conners' Adult ADHD Diagnostic Interview (n=14) and were matched for gender and age against normal controls (n=30). Three computer-based tasks, Stroop test, Stroop Plus, and Perceptual Selectivity test were completed. Accuracy (%) and response time (ms) were measured. Generalized Estimating Equations method was used to analyse those repeated measurements data. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) was calculated for each test.Mean age of cases was 47.29 (SD 9.03), 9 males. Mean age of controls was 41.57 (SD 11.42), 13 males. Individuals with ADHD had significantly worse performances in both accuracy and response time in all the tests. The best discriminate ability was the Stroop test (accuracy and response time), followed by the Perceptual Selectivity test (response time). Comparisons of AUCs of the tests did not show any significant differences. Age had a significant effect on the Stroop and Stroop Plus tests but not in the Perceptual Selectivity test.Adults with ADHD have a longer response time and perform less accurately than controls. Thus, these data suggest that there is a use for objective visual attention tests in the diagnosis of adult ADHD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662128>Effect of early shearing during gestation on the productive and reproductive behavior of female sheep offspring in their first 18 months of age.</a></h2><p>The research has shown the interesting contributions of shearing in mid-gestation on the performance of lambs from birth to weaning. Other studies have reported that shearing at early pregnancy influences the development of the placenta and lamb live weight at birth. However, there was a lack of information on the effect of early-prepartum shearing on the behavior of the offspring from weaning onward. This study evaluated the effect of shearing ewes at 50 days of gestation on the growth, reproductive behavior and response to a gastrointestinal parasite challenge in the female offspring from weaning to 18 months old. Fifty-seven Polwarth female lambs were used, 22 being singles and 35 twins born to ewes either shorn at 50 days of pregnancy (PS, n = 23) or shorn at 62 days postpartum (U, control, n = 34) resulting in four subgroups: single lambs born to PS ewes (n = 8), born to U ewes (n = 14), twin lambs born to PS ewes (n = 15) or born to U ewes (n = 20). All progeny were managed together under improved pasture with a minimum forage allowance of 6% live weight on dry basis. Body weight, body condition score and fecal eggs count were recorded every 14 days from weaning to 18 months of age. Concentrations of progesterone were measured weekly (from 4 to 10 months of age and from 14 to 18 months of age) to establish the onset of puberty. Ovulation rate at an induced and a natural heat (545 ± 1.0 and 562 ± 1.0 day old) was recorded. Prepartum shearing did not affect the age at puberty or the ovulation rate of female offspring, but those born as singles were more precocious ( P = 0.03) and heavier ( P = 0.02) at puberty than twin born lambs. Both the average value of parasite egg count ( P = 0.0 7) and the Famacha index ( P = 0.02) for the entire study period were lower in lambs born to prepartum shorn ewes than those born to postpartum shorn ewes. In conclusion, shearing at 50 days of gestation did not affect the growth or the reproductive behavior of female offspring. However, female lambs born from ewe shorn during gestation showed a better response to the parasitic challenge, and further research is required to confirm this.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661636>The Extra-pulmonary Effects of CFTR Modulators in Cystic Fibrosis.</a></h2><p>The effects of CFTR modulators on lung function, pulmonary exacerbations, and quality of life have been well documented. However, CF is a multi-organ disease and therefore an evidence base is emerging on the systemic effects of CFTR modulators beyond the pulmonary system. This is of great clinical importance as many of these studies provide proof-of-concept that CFTR modulators might be used one day to prevent or treat extra-pulmonary manifestations stemming from CFTR dysfunction. In this concise review of the literature, we summarize the results of key publications that have evaluated the effects of CFTR modulators on weight and growth, pancreatic function, the gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary systems, sinus disease, bone disease, exercise tolerance, fertility, mental health, and . While many of these studies have reported beneficial extra-pulmonary effects related to the use of ivacaftor (IVA) in CF patients with at least one gating mutation, most of the evidence is low or very low quality given the limited number of patients evaluated and the lack of a control group. Based on an even smaller number of studies evaluating the extra-pulmonary effects of lumacaftor-ivacaftor (LUM-IVA), the benefits are less clear. While limited, these studies may provide the basis for future clinical trials to evaluate CFTR modulators on the extra-pulmonary manifestations of CF.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659752>Vaccine innovations for emerging infectious diseases-a symposium report.</a></h2><p>Vaccines have been incredibly successful at stemming the morbidity and mortality of infectious diseases worldwide.

Among 25,952 patients with IE (62.2 ± 18·6 years; 65.9% men), 45.9% had NIE. The incidence of IE increased from 2.83 to 3.73 due to the NIE incidence increment with a decline in CIE. Patients with NIE were older (63.8 years vs. 60.8 years,  < 0·001), presented a higher Charlson index (1.22 vs. 1.03,  < 0.001), a greater history of implanted cardiac devices (8.7% vs. 4.6%,  < 0.001), and higher mortality (31.5% vs. 21.7%,  < 0.001). The most frequent microorganism for both NIE and CIE was  ( < 0.001), and the North reported a higher incidence ( < 0.001). Risk factors of mortality for NIE were age, Charlson index, hemodialysis, shock, heart failure, and stroke. Risk factors for CIE included female sex, renal disease, and cardiac-device carriers. The etiology of IE shifted from community origins to mostly nosocomial-associated infections.

The combination of quercetin (Q) and alantolactone (A) was found to induce synergistic immunogenic cell death (ICD) at a molar ratio of 1:4 (Q:A). To achieve ratiometric loading and delivery, the micellar delivery of Q and A (QA-M) was developed with high entrapment efficiency and drug loading at an optimal ratio. QA-M achieved prolonged blood circulation and increased tumor accumulation for both drugs. More importantly, QA-M retained the desired drug ratio (molar ratio of Q to A = 1:4) in tumors at 2 and 4 h after intravenous injection for synergistic immunotherapy. Tumor growth was significantly inhibited in murine orthotopic CRC by the treatment of QA-M compared to PBS and the combination of free drugs (p<0.005). The combination of nanotherapy stimulated the host immune response to induce long-term tumor destruction and induced memory tumor surveillance with a 1.3-fold increase in survival median time compared to PBS (p<0.0001) and a combination of free drugs (p<0.0005). The synergistic therapeutic effect induced by codelivery of Q and A are capable of reactivating antitumor  by inducing ICD, causing cell toxicity and modulating the immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment. Such a combination of Q and A with synergistic effects entrapped in a simple and safe nanodelivery system may provide the potential for scale-up manufacturing and clinical applications as immunotherapeutic agents for CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659236>Immunogenicity of the inactivated influenza vaccine in children who have undergone allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant.</a></h2><p>Influenza vaccination is recommended for children following allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), however there is limited evidence regarding its benefit. A prospective multicentre study was conducted to evaluate the immunogenicity of the inactivated influenza vaccine in children who have undergone HSCT compared with healthy age-matched controls. Participants were vaccinated between 2013 and 2016 according to Australian guidelines. Influenza-specific hemagglutinin inhibition antibody titres were performed prior to each vaccination and 4 weeks following the final vaccination. A nasopharyngeal aspirate for influenza was performed on participants that developed influenza-like illness. There were 86 children recruited; 43 who had undergone HSCT and 43 controls. For the HSCT group, seroprotection and seroconversion rates were 81.4% and 60.5% for H3N2, 41.9% and 32.6% for H1N1, and 44.2% and 39.5% for B strain respectively. There was a significant geometric mean fold increase to the H3N2 (GMFI 5.80, 95% CI 3.68-9.14, p < 0.001) and B (GMFI 3.44, 95% CI 2.36-5.00, p = 0.048) strains. Serological response was superior in age-matched controls to all vaccine strains. There were no serious adverse events following vaccination.

Inflammatory activation of microglia in the still-developing brain of preterm-born infants is associated with permanent neurological sequelae in 9 million infants every year. Investigating the regulators of microglial activation in the developing brain across models of neuroinflammation-mediated injury (mouse, zebrafish) and primary human and mouse microglia we found using analysis of genes and proteins that a reduction in Wnt/β-catenin signalling is necessary and sufficient to drive a microglial phenotype causing hypomyelination. We validated in a cohort of preterm-born infants that genomic variation in the Wnt pathway is associated with the levels of connectivity found in their brains. Using a Wnt agonist delivered by a blood-brain barrier penetrant microglia-specific targeting nanocarrier we prevented in our animal model the pro-inflammatory microglial activation, white matter injury and behavioural deficits. Collectively, these data validate that the Wnt pathway regulates microglial activation, is critical in the evolution of an important form of human brain injury and is a viable therapeutic target.© The Author(s) (2019).

However, the negative impact of ZnO-NPs on the immune system, especially in relation to host defense against pathogenic infection and its underlying regulatory mechanisms, remains largely unexplored. This study investigated the effects of early-life long-term ZnO-NPs exposure (from L1 larvae to adults) on innate  and its underlying mechanisms using a host-pathogen Caenorhabditis elegans model, and this was compared with the effect of ionic Zn. The results showed that the ZnO-NPs taken up by C. elegans primarily accumulated in the intestine and that early-life long-term ZnO-NPs exposure at environmentally relevant concentrations (50 and 500 μg/L) decreased the survival of wild-type C. elegans when faced with pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 infection. Early-life long-term ZnO-NPs (500 μg/L) exposure significantly increased (by about 3-fold) the accumulation of live P. aeruginosa PA14 colonies in the intestine of C. elegans. In addition, ZnO-NPs (500 μg/L) inhibited the intestinal nuclear translocation of SKN-1 and also downregulated gcs-1 gene expression, which is an SKN-1 target gene. Further evidence revealed that early-life long-term exposure to ZnO-NPs (500 μg/L) did not increase susceptibility to mutation among the genes (pmk-1, sek-1, and nsy-1) encoding the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade in response to P. aeruginosa PA14 infection, though ZnO-NPs significantly decreased the mRNA levels of pmk-1, sek-1, and nsy-1. This study provides regulatory insight based on evidence that ZnO-NPs suppress the innate  of C. elegans and highlights the potential health risks of certain environmental nanomaterials, including ZnO-NPs, in terms of their immunotoxicity at environmentally relevant concentrations.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The atypical profilin Arabidopsis AtPRF3 has been reported to cooperate with canonical profilin isoforms in suppressing formin-mediated actin polymerization during plant innate  responses. AtPRF3 has a 37-amino-acid-long N terminal extension (NTE), and its suppressive effect on actin assembly is derived from enhanced interaction with the poly-proline (Poly-P) of the formin AtFH1. However, the molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we solved the crystal structures of AtPRF3Δ22 and AtPRF3Δ37, as well as AtPRF2 apo form and in complex with AtFH1 Poly-P at 1.5-3.6 Å resolutions. By combining these structures with molecular modeling, we found that AtPRF3Δ22 NTE has high plasticity, with a primary "closed" conformation that can adopt an open conformation that enables Poly-P binding. Furthermore, using molecular dynamics simulation and free-energy calculations of protein-protein binding, along with experimental validation, we show that the AtPRF3Δ22 binds to Poly-P in an adaptive manner, thereby enabling different binding modes that maintain the interaction through disordered sequences. Together, our structural and simulation results suggest that the dynamic conformational changes of the AtPRF3 NTE upon Poly-P binding modulate their interactions to fine-tune formin-mediated actin assembly.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653058>Immunobiology of Atherosclerosis: A Complex Net of Interactions.</a></h2><p>Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality worldwide, and atherosclerosis the principal factor underlying cardiovascular events.

However, each boron-containing compound exerts different effects.To review the effects of 2-Aminoethyldiphenyl borinate (2-APB), an organoboron compound, on the human body.In this review, we organized the information to show the expansion of these reported effects through interactions with several ion channels and other receptors. These effects are relevant in the biomedical and chemical fields due to the application of the reported data in developing therapeutic tools to modulate the functions of the immune, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and nervous systems.Accordingly, 2-APB acts as a modulator of adaptive and innate , including the production of cytokines and the migration of leukocytes. Additionally, reports show that 2-APB exerts effects on neurons, smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes, and it provides a cytoprotective effect by modulation and attenuation of reactive oxygen species.The molecular pharmacology of 2-APB supports both its potential to act as a drug and the desirable inclusion of its moieties in new drug development. Research evaluating its efficacy in treating pain and specific maladies, such as immune, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and neurodegenerative disorders, is scarce but interesting.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659824>Proteomics Profiling of Swine Serum Following Lipopolysaccharide Stimulation.</a></h2><p>There are no approved animal drugs for management of inflammation in swine due to lack of validated animal models. To assess efficacy, it was essential to develop proteomics approaches to identify suitable biomarkers of inflammation as presented in this study.Serum samples were collected from a group of 4 pigs prior to (baseline), and 24 and 48 h following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation to reveal proteomic changes during inflammation. Two other pigs served as untreated controls. Proteins were separated by either 1D SDS-PAGE or 2D gel electrophoresis (2DE) prior to analysis by nano flow liquid chromatography (nLC) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry.We identified 165 proteins using SDS-PAGE, of which 47 proteins were also detected by 2DE prior to nLC-MS/MS. More than half (72%) of all characterized proteins were modulated as a result of LPS stimulation, many of which are known to be involved with innate and adaptive . Pig serum samples obtained 24 h after LPS initiation of inflammation showed protein modulations of serum albumin, serotransferrin, light and heavy immunoglobulin chains (IGs), and major acute phase proteins including haptoglobin (HPT), serum amyloid A2 (SAA2), C-reactive protein (CRP), β-2-glycoprotein 1 (B-2GP1), alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein (A2HS), α-1-antitrypsin (A1AT), and α-1-acid glycoprotein (A1AG). SAA2 was distinguished from the other SAA isoforms by the unique peptide sequence of SAA2.The results provided proteomic analysis of swine serum due to LPS stimulation and indicated the importance of SAA2, which appears to be unique and may be regarded as a potential clinical diagnostic biomarker of inflammation.This article is protected by copyright.

About half of patients with IBD develop rheumatic ailments and microscopic intestinal inflammation is present in up to half of CRD patients. IBD and CRD patients also share a common therapeutic armamentarium. Disequilibrium in the complex realm of microbes (known as dysbiosis) that closely interact with the gut mucosal immune system has been associated with both IBD and CRD (spondyloarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis). Whether dysbiosis represents an epiphenomenon or a prodromal feature remains to be determined.In an attempt to further investigate whether specific gut dysbiosis may be the missing link between IBD and CRD in patients developing both diseases, we performed here a systematic literature review focusing on studies looking at bacterial microbiota in CRD and/or IBD patients.We included 80 studies, with a total of 3799 IBD patients without arthritis, 1084 CRD patients without IBD, 132 IBD patients with arthropathy manifestations and 12 spondyloarthritis patients with IBD history. Overall, this systematic review indicates that an increase in s,  and  genera, as well as a decrease in  genera and species belonging to Verrucomicrobia and Fusobacteria phyla are common features in IBD and CRD patients, whereas dozens of bacterial species are specific features of CRD and IBD.Further work is needed to understand the functions of bacteria and of their metabolites but also to characterize fungi and viruses that are commonly found in these patients.© Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661607>Investigation of the molecular epizootiological characteristics and tracking of the geographical origins of Brucella canis strains in China.</a></h2><p>Brucellosis is a global pandemic infectious zoonosis. Brucella canis is a rare source of human brucellosis in China, and its public health significance remains under debate. Moreover, data pertaining to the epizootiological characteristics and geographical origin of B. canis on a nationwide scale are limited, and the risk to public safety posed by B. canis infections is unknown. The MLVA (multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis) assay can be helpful to analyze epidemiological correlations among Brucella isolates and to track their geographic origins. To accomplish this task, MLVA-16 was used to analyze the epidemiological links of 63 isolates obtained from dogs and humans. Sixty-three B. canis strains were sorted into three large clusters (A, B, and C) and 50 different genotypes (GT1-50), and 43 unique genotypes were represented by single isolates, suggesting that these strains had no obvious epidemiological links and that canine brucellosis is predominantly sporadic in China. The other seven shared genotypes (among a total of 20 isolates) were each represented by two to eight isolates, indicating that strains from each shared genotype were epidemiologically correlated. Five of the shared genotypes were from 16 strains obtained from Beijing, indicating that canine brucellosis in Beijing originates from multipoint outbreaks with multiple sources of infection. Based on comprehensive case analysis of clinical B. canis infection, we preliminarily suggest that human B. canis infections are associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection that results in decreased patient . B. canis may have limited epidemiological significance for the healthy population, but it remains a significant threat to the canine breeding industry and to humans who come into close contact with dogs. Based on MLVA-11 data, B. canis strains were clustered into 16 genotypes and divided into five evolutionary branches; these data confirm that this population covers an extensive geographic area and exhibits characteristics of the origin and evolution of co-existing introduced and locally native lineages. We believe this study will contribute to strengthening efforts to prevent and control canine brucellosis and to improve public understanding of the health risks posed by B. canis.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660257>Antibacterial immune functions of subadults and adults in a semelparous spider.</a></h2><p>Although capacity to mount an efficient immune response plays a critical role in individuals' survival, its dynamics across ontogenetic stages is still largely unexplored. Life stage-dependent variation in the encountered diversity and prevalence of parasites were proposed to contribute to stage-dependent changes in , but differences in life history objectives between developmental stages may also lead to stage-specific changes in efficiency of given immune mechanisms. The reason for this is that juveniles and subadults are unable to reproduce, therefore they invest resources mainly into survival, while adults have to partition their resources between survival and reproduction. The general trade-off between somatic maintenance and reproductive effort is expected to impair immune function. Especially so in semelparous organisms that only reproduce once throughout their lifetime, hence they do not face the trade-off between current and future reproduction. We hypothesised that in a semelparous species individuals would be characterised by decreased investment into somatic maintenance after maturation, in order to maximise their reproductive output. Accordingly, we predicted that (1) elements of somatic maintenance, such as , should be relatively weaker in adults in comparison to subadults, and (2) increased reproductive investment in adults should be associated with lower immune efficiency. We quantified two markers of  in subadult and adult individuals of the semelparous wolf spider  (Westring, 1861), namely bacterial growth inhibition power and bacterial cell wall lytic activity. We found that subadults showed significantly higher cell wall lytic activity than adults, but the two life stages did not differ in their capacity to inhibit bacterial growth. Also, we found weaker immune measures in mated females compared to virgins. Furthermore, in mated females bacterial growth inhibition power was negatively associated with fecundity.© 2019 Rádai et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662454>Type VII Secretion Substrates of Pathogenic Mycobacteria Are Processed by a Surface Protease.</a></h2><p>Tuberculosis, one of the world's most severe infectious diseases, is caused by  A major weapon of this pathogen is a unique cell wall that protects the pathogen from eradication by the immune system. Mycobacteria have specialized secretion systems, e.g., type VII secretion or ESX systems, to transport substrates across this cell wall. The largest group of proteins that are secreted by these ESX systems are the PE proteins. Previously, it was shown that the N-terminal PE domain of about 100 amino acids is required for secretion. Here, we describe the identification of an aspartic protease, designated PecA, that removes (part of) this PE domain at the cell surface. Nearly all of the observed PE_PGRS proteins are processed by PecA. Interestingly, the protease itself is also a secreted PE protein and subject to self-cleavage. Furthermore, a defect in surface processing has no effect on the activity of the PE lipase protein LipY but does seem to affect the functioning of other virulence factors, as a  mutant strain of  shows moderate attenuation in zebrafish larvae. In conclusion, our results reveal the presence of a functional aspartic acid protease in  that cleaves LipY, itself as well as other members of the PE_PGRS family. Finally, mutants lacking PecA show growth attenuation , suggesting that PecA plays a role during infection.

In cells, release from the C-terminal diaphanous autoregulatory domain (DAD) of FHOD1 stimulates the protein into the active form. However, the cellular physiological relevance of active form FHOD1 and the phenotypic regulation by FHOD1 depletion are not completely understood. Here, we show that in contrast with the cytosolic diffused expression of auto-inhibited FHOD1, active FHOD1 by C-terminal truncation was recruited into all three types of actin stress fibers in human osteosarcoma cells. Notably, the recruited active FHOD1 was more incorporated with myosin II than α-actinin, and associated with both naïve and mature focal adhesions. Active FHOD1 displayed faster turnover than actin molecules on ventral stress fibers. Moreover, we witnessed the emergence of active FHOD1 from the cell periphery, which subsequently moved centripetally together with transverse arcs. Furthermore, FHOD1 knockdown resulted in defective maturation of actomyosin bundles and subsequently longer non-contractile dorsal stress fibers, whereas the turnover of both actin and myosin II were maintained normally. Importantly, the loss of FHOD1 led to slower actin centripetal flow, resulting in abnormal cell spreading and migration defects. Taken together, these results reveal a critical role of FHOD1 in temporal- and spatial- control of the morphology and dynamics of functional actin stress fibers during variable cell behavior.© 2019 The Author(s).

The role of this metabolic pathway in macrophage response and function is unknown. We show that the enzyme cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH) is induced in macrophages infected with pathogenic bacteria through signaling involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/MTOR and the transcription factor SP1. This results in the synthesis of cystathionine, which facilitates the survival of pathogens within myeloid cells. Our data demonstrate that the expression of CTH leads to defective macrophage activation by (i) dysregulation of polyamine metabolism by depletion of -adenosylmethionine, resulting in immunosuppressive putrescine accumulation and inhibition of spermidine and spermine synthesis, and (ii) increased histone H3K9, H3K27, and H3K36 di/trimethylation, which is associated with gene expression silencing. Thus, CTH is a pivotal enzyme of the innate immune response that disrupts host defense. The induction of the reverse transsulfuration pathway by bacterial pathogens can be considered an unrecognized mechanism for immune escape. Macrophages are professional immune cells that ingest and kill microbes. In this study, we show that different pathogenic bacteria induce the expression of cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH) in macrophages. This enzyme is involved in a metabolic pathway called the reverse transsulfuration pathway, which leads to the production of numerous metabolites, including cystathionine. Phagocytized bacteria use cystathionine to better survive in macrophages. In addition, the induction of CTH results in dysregulation of the metabolism of polyamines, which in turn dampens the proinflammatory response of macrophages. In conclusion, pathogenic bacteria can evade the host immune response by inducing CTH in macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656525>Immunizing mice using different combination antigens of the PI-2a fimbria subunit of .</a></h2><p> is the main causal pathogen of bovine mastitis (BM), causing considerable economic loss to the dairy industry worldwide.

Transmission models have been a fundamental component of analysis, informing the efficient use of limited resources. However, these models generally treat each season and each strain circulating within that season in isolation. Here, we amalgamate multiple data sources to calibrate a susceptible-latent-infected-recovered type transmission model for seasonal influenza, incorporating the four main strains and mechanisms linking prior season epidemiological outcomes to  at the beginning of the following season. Data pertaining to nine influenza seasons, starting with the 2009/10 season, informed our estimates for epidemiological processes, virological sample positivity, vaccine uptake and efficacy attributes, and general practitioner influenza-like-illness consultations as reported by the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC). We performed parameter inference via approximate Bayesian computation to assess strain transmissibility, dependence of present season influenza  on prior protection, and variability in the influenza case ascertainment across seasons.

Parameter fits indicated that the propagation of  from one season to the next is weaker if vaccine derived, compared to natural  from infection.

The molecular mechanism of flavivirus assembly is not well understood. Here, we show that Zika virus (ZIKV) NS2A protein recruits genomic RNA, the structural protein prM/E complex, and the NS2B/NS3 protease complex to the virion assembly site and orchestrates virus morphogenesis. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed that ZIKV NS2A binds to prM, E, NS2B, and NS3 (but not C, NS4B, or NS5) in a viral RNA-independent manner, whereas prM/E complex does not interact with NS2B/NS3 complex. Remarkably, a single-amino-acid mutation (E103A) of NS2A impairs its binding to prM/E and NS2B/NS3 and abolishes virus production, demonstrating the indispensable role of NS2A/prM/E and NS2A/NS2B/NS3 interactions in virion assembly. In addition, RNA-protein pulldown analysis identified a stem-loop RNA from the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the viral genome as an "RNA recruitment signal" for ZIKV assembly. The 3' UTR RNA binds to a cytoplasmic loop of NS2A protein. Mutations of two positively charged residues (R96A and R102A) from the cytoplasmic loop reduce NS2A binding to viral RNA, leading to a complete loss of virion assembly. Collectively, our results support a virion assembly model in which NS2A recruits viral NS2B/NS3 protease and structural C-prM-E polyprotein to the virion assembly site; once the C-prM-E polyprotein has been processed, NS2A presents viral RNA to the structural proteins for virion assembly. ZIKV is a recently emerged mosquito-borne flavivirus that can cause devastating congenital Zika syndrome in pregnant women and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults. The molecular mechanism of ZIKV virion assembly is largely unknown. Here, we report that ZIKV NS2A plays a central role in recruiting viral RNA, structural protein prM/E, and viral NS2B/NS3 protease to the virion assembly site and orchestrating virion morphogenesis. One mutation that impairs these interactions does not significantly affect viral RNA replication but selectively abolishes virion assembly, demonstrating the specific role of these interactions in virus morphogenesis. We also show that the 3' UTR of ZIKV RNA may serve as a "recruitment signal" through binding to NS2A to enter the virion assembly site. Following a coordinated cleavage of C-prM-E at the virion assembly site, NS2A may present the viral RNA to C protein for nucleocapsid formation followed by envelopment with prM/E proteins. The results have provided new insights into flavivirus virion assembly.Copyright © 2019 Zhang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654279>Population-Level Resistance to Chytridiomycosis is Life-Stage Dependent in an Imperiled Anuran.</a></h2><p>Amphibian declines caused by chytridiomycosis have been severe, but some susceptible populations have persisted or even recovered. Resistance to the causal agent Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) could result from alleles of the adaptive immune system. During metamorphosis, however, immune systems may not be fully functional, implying that an effective immune response to Bd may be life-stage dependent. We evaluated the susceptibility of the relict leopard frog (Rana onca) sourced from two areas where Bd was present or absent, and where the populations appeared to show differences in pathogen resistance. We evaluated whether population-level resistance manifested across life stages using challenge experiments with late-stage tadpoles (Gosner stage 31-38), metamorphs (stage 45-46), and juvenile frogs. We used three different Bd isolates including one from wild R. onca to challenge juvenile frogs and focused on the isolate from R. onca to challenge tadpoles and resulting metamorphs. We found that juveniles from the Bd exposed population were 5.5 times more likely to survive Bd infection and 10 times more likely to clear infections than those from the area without Bd. In contrast, and regardless of the source area, we observed 98% survivorship of tadpoles, but only 19% survivorship of resulting metamorphs following re-exposure. Given the low survivorship of exposed metamorphs in the laboratory, we speculate on how resistance characteristics, whether adaptive or innate, that do not manifest at each life stage could develop in the wild. We suggest that seasonal high temperatures during times when metamorphosis appears common may modulate the effects of the pathogen during this most susceptible life stage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652350>Oral Cancer-associated Tertiary Lymphoid Structures: Gene-Expression Profile and Prognostic Value.</a></h2><p>Tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) provides a local and critical microenvironment for both cellular and humoral  and supports effective antigen presentation and lymphocyte activation.

Two types of cancerous (primary tumor and metastasis) and two types of not cancerous (thyroid gland and lymph node) regions of interest (ROIs) were delineated in postoperative material from 11 patients, then the distribution of tryptic peptides (spectral components) was analyzed by MSI in all tissue regions.

In addition, an approach for target area determination is proposed, which can approximately determine the region of the target node by the received signal strength indication (RSSI), to support RMLNet. Furthermore, we implement the system to estimate the localization of the target node and evaluate its performance in practice. Experiments and simulations show that RMLNet can achieve localization application reliability multi-area localization with a better localization performance of competing target nodes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664180>Allogeneic dendritic cells induce potent antitumor  by activating KLRG1CD8 T cells.</a></h2><p>The graft-versus-leukemia effect reminds us to observe the allogeneic cell elicited anti-tumor immune responses. Here we immunized recipient B6 mice with different types of allogenic leukocytes and found that vaccination with allogenic dendritic cells (alloDC) elicited the most efficient protection against broad-spectrum tumors. The recipient lymphocytes were analyzed and the data showed that CD8 T cells increased significantly after immunization and expressed effector memory T cell marker KLRG1. Functional evaluation demonstrated that these KLRG1CD8 T cells could kill tumor cells in vitro and in vivo in Granzyme B- and Fas/FasL-dependent manners with no tumor antigen specificity, and tend to migrate into tumor sites by high expression of heparanase. Adoptive transfer of these cells could provide antitumor protection against tumors. AlloDC could also treat mice with residual tumors and combination of anti-PD1 antibody could enhance this effects. Together, our study showed that alloDC-immunization could induce potent antitumor effect through the expansion of KLRG1CD8 T cells, which can work as both preventive and therapeutic tumor vaccines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663406>Hospitalizations for infections by age and sex: register-based study of Danish children 1977-2014.</a></h2><p> Infectious diseases are a major cause of hospitalizations in children and there is increasing interest in sex differences in  during childhood. Therefore, we examined hospital admission rates for infectious diseases in Danish children by age and sex. Register-based cohort study of all Danish residents aged 0-14 years from 1977 to 2014. We examined total admission rate for infections and rates of admission by types of infection. This study included 3,689,999 children and 1,080,750 admissions for infections. The admission rates peaked at age 0 months (boys, 197.9 admissions per 1000 person-years; girls, 160.9) and age 11 months (boys, 155.5; girls, 113.9). The male-female ratio of admissions was 1.25 for children aged 0-14 years, but varied by age and type of infection. Boys had the highest admission rate for any infection until 9 years of age after which girls had a higher rate. Boys had higher admission rates for gastrointestinal infections and lower respiratory tract infections than girls at all ages. The admission rates for upper respiratory tract infections and 'Other infections' for girls were higher than the rates for boys at age 10 and 4 years, respectively. Overall, boys had around 25% higher admission rates for infections than girls, with some variation according to age and type of infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656442>Disseminated blastomycosis in coalworkers' pneumoconiosis.</a></h2><p> is a thermally dimorphic fungus that can cause pulmonary, extrapulmonary, or disseminated infections. Though it can infect both immune-competent and immunocompromised hosts, the disease can be severe in immunocompromised hosts. Exposure to silica dust is associated with silicosis, and this is associated with impaired  and an increased risk of mycobacterial and fungal infections. The fungal infections commonly associated with pneumoconiosis are pulmonary aspergillosis, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, and cryptococcosis. However, there is a dearth of data on the association of pneumoconiosis and blastomycosis. Clinical deterioration and new cavitary lesions in patients with pneumoconiosis should alert clinicians of new pulmonary infection. Traditional sputum sampling may lead to poor diagnostic yield, because the organism is frequently surrounded by a fibrotic wall. Aggressive diagnostic testing with lung or skin biopsies may be warranted.

Hence, viruses must subvert this anti-viral response in order to establish an efficient life cycle. In line with this point of view, kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) encodes numerous genes that function as immunomodulatory proteins to antagonize the host immune system. One such mechanism through which KSHV evades the host  is by encoding a viral homolog of cellular interferon (IFN) regulatory factors (IRFs), known as vIRFs. Herein, we summarize recent advances in the study of immunomodulatory strategies of KSHV vIRFs and their contributions on KSHV-associated pathogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655002>Next generation serology: integrating cross-sectional and capture-recapture approaches to infer disease dynamics.</a></h2><p>Two approaches have been classically used in disease ecology to estimate epidemiological parameters from field studies: cross-sectional sampling from unmarked individuals and longitudinal capture-recapture setups, which generally involve more limited numbers of marked individuals due to cost and logistical constrains. Although the benefits of longitudinal setups are increasingly acknowledged in the disease ecology community, cross-sectional data remain largely over-represented in the literature, probably because of the inherent costs of longitudinal surveys. In this context, we used simulated data to compare the performances of cross-sectional and longitudinal designs to estimate the force of infection (i.e., the rate at which susceptible individuals become infected). Then, inspired from recent method developments in quantitative ecology, we explore the benefits of integrating both cross-sectional (seroprevalences) and longitudinal (individuals histories) datasets. In doing so, we investigate the effects of host species life history, antibody persistence and degree of a priori knowledge and uncertainty on demographic and epidemiological parameters, as those are expected to affect in different ways the level of inference possible from the data. Our results highlight how those elements are important to consider to determine optimal sampling designs. In the case of long-lived species exposed to infectious agents resulting in persistent antibody responses, integrated designs are especially valuable as they benefit from the performances of longitudinal designs even with relatively small longitudinal sample sizes. As an illustration, we apply this approach to a combination of empirical and simulated data inspired from a case of bats exposed to a rabies virus. Overall, this work highlights that serology field studies could greatly benefit from the opportunity of integrating cross-sectional and longitudinal designs.© 2019 by the Ecological Society of America.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660091>Immunomodulatory aspects in the progression and treatment of oral malignancy.</a></h2><p>Inflammation substantially affects the risk of oral malignancy. Pro-inflammatory cytokine, interferon (IFN)-γ, confers anti-tumor activity using several different mechanisms. Conversely, higher expression of interleukin (IL)-17 is associated with worse prognosis. Monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 correlates positively with poor long-term survival of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. IL-1α affects cancer associated fibroblasts and macrophages, and promote several malignant phenotypes including immune suppression. Some anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, relate to pro-tumoral activities. Among immune checkpoint modulators, programmed death (PD-)1 and PD-ligand (L)1 facilitate oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell evasion from immune surveillance, and the expression status of these has a prognostic value. OSCCs contain tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) as major stromal cells of their tumor microenvironment. Among the two distinctive states, M2 macrophages support tumor invasion, metastasis and immune suppression. Crosstalk between TAMs and OSCC or cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) plays an important role in the progression of OSCC. Clinical trials with blocking antibodies against IL-1α or melanoma-associated antigens have been reported as therapeutic approaches against OSCCs. The most promising approach activating antitumor  is the blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 axis. Manipulating the polarization of pro-tumorigenic macrophages has been reported as a novel therapeutic approach.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665076>Intratumoral immunoglobulin isotypes predict survival in lung adenocarcinoma subtypes.</a></h2><p>The role of tumor-infiltrating B-cells (TIBs) and intratumorally-produced antibodies in cancer- interactions essentially remains terra incognita. In particular, it remains unexplored how driver mutations could be associated with distinct TIBs signatures and their role in tumor microenvironment.Here we analyzed associations of immunoglobulin isotypes and clonality with survival in TCGA RNA-Seq data for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), stratifying patients into 12 driver mutation and phenotypic tumor subgroups.We revealed several unexpected associations between TIBs behavior and prognosis. Abundance and high proportion of IgG1 isotype, and low proportion of IgA among all intratumorally produced immunoglobulins were specifically associated with improved overall survival for KRAS but not KRAS LUAD, revealing the first link between a driver mutation and B-cell response. We found specific IgG1 signature associated with long survival, which suggests that particular specificities of IgG1+ TIBs could be beneficial in KRAS LUAD. In contrast to our previous observations for melanoma, highly clonal IgG1 production by plasma cells had no meaningful effect on prognosis, suggesting that IgG1+ TIBs may exert a beneficial effect in KRAS cases in an alternative way, such as efficient presentation of cognate antigens or direct B cell attack on tumor cells. Notably, a high proportion of the IgG1 isotype is positively correlated with the non-silent mutation burden both in the general LUAD cohort and in most patient subgroups, supporting a role for IgG1 TIBs in antigen presentation. Complementing the recent finding that the presence of stromal IgG4-producing cells is associated with a favorable prognosis for patients with stage I squamous cell carcinoma, we show that the abundance of IgG4-producing TIBs likewise has a strong positive effect on overall survival in STK11 and proximal proliferative subgroups of LUAD patients. We hypothesize that the positive role of IgG4 antibodies in some of the lung cancer subtypes could be associated with reported inability of IgG4 isotype to form immune complexes, thus preventing immunosuppression via activation of the myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) phenotype.We discover prominent and distinct associations between TIBs antibody isotypes and survival in lung adenocarcinoma carrying specific driver mutations. These findings indicate that particular types of tumor- relations could be beneficial in particular driver mutation context, which should be taken into account in developing strategies of cancer immunotherapy and combination therapies. Specificity of protective B cell populations in specific cancer subgroups could become a clue to efficient targeted immunotherapies for appropriate cohorts of patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656641>Recommendations for lung cancer screening in Southern Africa.</a></h2><p>Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in southern Africa. Early trials of chest radiograph-based screening in males at high risk for lung cancer found no mortality benefit of a radiograph alone, or a radiograph plus sputum cytology screening strategy. Large prospective studies, including the National Lung Screening Trial, have shown an all-cause mortality benefit when low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) was used as a screening modality in patients that are at high risk of developing lung cancer. The South African Thoracic Society, based on these findings, and those from several international guidelines, recommend that annual LDCT should be offered to patients between 55-74 years of age who are current or former smokers (having quit within the preceding 15 years), with at least a 30-pack year smoking history and with no history of lung cancer. Patients should be in general good health, fit for surgery, and willing to undergo further investigations if deemed necessary. Given the high local prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) infection and post-TB lung disease, which can radiographically mimic lung cancer, a conservative threshold (nodule size ≥6 mm) should be used to determine whether the baseline LDCT screen is positive (thus nodules <6 mm require no action until the next annual screen). If a non-calcified, solid or partly solid nodule is ≥6 mm, but <10 mm with no malignant features (e.g., distinct spiculated margins), the LDCT should be repeated in 6 months. If a solid nodule or the largest component of a non-solid nodule is ≥10 or ≥6 mm and enlarging or with additional malignant features present, definitive action to exclude lung cancer is warranted. Patients should be screened annually until 15 years have elapsed from date of smoking cessation, they turn 80, become unfit for a curative operation or significant changes are observed.2019 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

As such, it is widely held that SFPs may contribute to post-mating, pre-zygotic (PMPZ) reproductive barriers between closely related taxa. We investigated seminal fluid (SF) diversification in a recently diverged passerine species pair (Passer domesticus and P. hispaniolensis) using a combination of proteomic and comparative evolutionary genomic approaches. First, we characterized and compared the SF proteome of the two species, revealing consistencies with known aspects of SFP biology and function in other taxa, including the presence and diversification of proteins involved in  and sperm maturation. Second, using whole genome resequencing data, we assessed patterns of genomic differentiation between house and Spanish sparrows. These analyses detected divergent selection on -related SF genes and positive selective sweeps in regions containing a number of SF genes that also exhibited protein abundance diversification between species. Finally, we analyzed the molecular evolution of SFPs across 11 passerine species and found a significantly higher rate of positive selection in SFPs compared with the rest of the genome, as well as significant enrichments for functional pathways related to  in the set of positively selected SF genes. Our results suggest that selection on  pathways is an important determinant of passerine SF composition and evolution. Assessing the role of  genes in speciation in other recently diverged taxa should be prioritized given the potential role for -related proteins in reproductive incompatibilities in Passer sparrows.© The Author(s) 2019.

This approach has the potential to search for new targets for vaccine development in the predicted proteome of pathogenic organisms. To date, there is no effective vaccine employed in vaccination campaigns against visceral leishmaniasis (VL). For the first time, herein, an in silico, in vitro, and in vivo peptide screening was performed, and immunogenic peptides were selected to constitute VL peptide-based vaccines. Firstly, the screening of in silico potential peptides using dogs naturally infected by  was conducted and the peptides with the best performance were selected. The mentioned peptides were used to compose Cockt-1 (cocktail 1) and Cockt-2 (cocktail 2) in combination with saponin as the adjuvant. Therefore, tests for immunogenicity, polyfunctional T-cells, and the ability to induce central and effector memory in T-lymphocytes capacity in reducing the parasite load on the spleen for Cockt-1 and Cockt-2 were performed. Among the vaccines under study, Cockt-1 showed the best results, eliciting CD4 and CD8 polyfunctional T-cells, with a reduction in spleen parasitism that correlates to the generation of T CD4 central memory and T CD8 effector memory cells. In this way, our findings corroborate the use of immunoinformatics as a tool for the development of future vaccines against VL.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658646>Characterization of Three Novel Viruses from the Families , and , Isolated from Dead Birds Collected during West Nile Virus Surveillance in Harris County, Texas.</a></h2><p>This report describes and characterizes three novel RNA viruses isolated from dead birds collected during West Nile virus surveillance in Harris County, TX, USA (the Houston metropolitan area).

Four independent loci have been implicated in FAME on chromosomes (chr) 2, 3, 5 and 8. Using whole genome sequencing and repeat primed PCR, we provide evidence that chr2-linked FAME (FAME2) is caused by an expansion of an ATTTC pentamer within the first intron of STARD7. The ATTTC expansions segregate in 158/158 individuals typically affected by FAME from 22 pedigrees including 16 previously reported families recruited worldwide. RNA sequencing from patient derived fibroblasts shows no accumulation of the AUUUU or AUUUC repeat sequences and STARD7 gene expression is not affected. These data, in combination with other genes bearing similar mutations that have been implicated in FAME, suggest ATTTC expansions may cause this disorder, irrespective of the genomic locus involved.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654647>Identification and characterization of IRF9 from black carp Mylopharyngodon piceus.</a></h2><p>Interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) plays a crucial role in JAK-STAT signaling in human and mammal. However, the relationship between IRF9 and STAT1 in teleost fish remains largely unknown. The previous study has elucidated that two STAT1 isoforms (bcSTAT1a and bcSTAT1b) of black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus) play an important role during the innate immune activation initiated by grass carp reovirus (GCRV). In this paper, black carp IRF9 (bcIRF9) has been identified and characterized. bcIRF9 was distributed majorly in the nucleus and the linker domain (LD) of bcIRF9 was vital for its nuclear localization. bcIRF9 showed ISRE-inducing activity in reporter assay and presented antiviral activity against GCRV in plaque assay, in which both DNA binding domain (DBD) and LD of bcIRF9 were essential for its antiviral signaling. bcIRF9 was identified to interact with both bcSTAT1a and bcSTAT1b in the co-immunoprecipitation assay. It was interesting that bcIRF9-mediated antiviral signaling was up-regulated by bcSTAT1a; however, down-regulated by bcSTAT1b. Thus, our data support the conclusion that bcIRF9 plays an important role in the innate immune defense against GCRV, in which two STAT1 proteins function differently.Copyright © 2019.

Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family are promising targets for development of agonist formulations for use as vaccine adjuvants. Combinations of co-delivered TLR4 and TLR7/8 ligands have been demonstrated to have synergistic effects on innate and adaptive immune response. Here, we create liposomes which stably co-encapsulate, CRX-601, a TLR4 agonist, and UM-3004, a lipidated TLR7/8 agonist, within the liposomal bilayer in order to achieve co-delivery, allow tunable physical properties, and induce in vitro and in vivo immune synergy. Co-encapsulation demonstrates a synergistic increase in IL-12p70 cytokine output in vitro from treated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs). Further, co-encapsulated formulations give significant improvement of early IgG2a antibody titers in BALB/c mice following primary vaccination when compared to single agonist or dual agonists delivered in separate liposomes. This work demonstrates that co-incorporation of TLR4 and lipidated TLR7/8 agonists within the liposomal bilayer leads to innate and adaptive immune synergy which biases a Th1 immune response. Thus, liposomal co-encapsulation may be a useful and flexible tool for vaccine adjuvant formulation containing multiple TLR agonists.Copyright © 2019.

To develop an effective yet simple process for enhancing its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, turmeric was gun-puffed at various pressures. Puffed turmeric exhibited an increase in its brown color and porous structures, indicating the occurrence of the Maillard reaction and vaporization during the process. Proximal analysis revealed that puffing did not alter the major constituents, although a very small decrease in crude fat extraction was observed under some circumstances. Total phenolic compounds in the extract were significantly increased after puffing, and subsequent assessment of antioxidant capacity, as determined using independent 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays, demonstrated enhanced antioxidant capacity in a puffing-pressure-dependent manner. Turmeric extract was further tested for the regulation of inflammatory responses in the murine macrophage RAW264.7 cell line. Suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced macrophages was amplified using puffed-turmeric extracts compared to the control extract. Furthermore, macrophage-activation assessment revealed downregulated expression of inflammation-relevant cluster of differentiation (CD)80 and CD86 using puffed-turmeric extract in a puffing-pressure-dependent manner.

Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a complex pathogenic process that involves angiogenesis, inflammation, cellular , and other factors. This study was aimed at investigating the effect of GV1001 on laser-induced CNV in a rat model. Brown Norway rats were subcutaneously administered GV1001 (0.1 nM, 1 nM, and 10 nM) daily, beginning 3 days prior, and ending 14 days after laser photocoagulation. Optical coherence tomography, fluorescein angiography, choroidal flat mount, and histologic analysis were performed to analyze CNV. The protein level of IκB-α and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) was analyzed via immunohistochemistry of p65. Multiplex immunoassay was performed to evaluate the interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and tumor necrosis factor-α levels. The GV1001-treated group had significantly lower CNV thickness, smaller CNV area, and lower proportion of CNV lesions with clinically significant fluorescein leakage than vehicle-treated group. GV1001 treatment inhibited IκB-α degradation and NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation. At 1 nM concentration, GV1001 had highest inhibitory effect on CNV and NF-κB signaling activation; moreover, it suppressed the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and VEGF significantly. The present study demonstrates that GV1001 treatment led to significant suppression of laser-induced CNV, alongside inhibition of inflammatory processes including NF-κB activation and subsequent upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. Therefore, this provides molecular evidence of potential validity of GV1001 treatment as a therapeutic strategy for neovascular age-related macular degeneration.Copyright © 2019.

Altered  status during pregnancy and challenges fully vaccinating newborns contribute to this medical reality. Maternal immunization is a strategy to protect pregnant women and their newborns. This study aimed to find out how patient-provider relationships affect maternal vaccine uptake, particularly in the context of a lower middle- income country where limited research in this area exists.We conducted semi-structured, in-depth narrative interviews of both providers and pregnant women from four sites in Kenya: Siaya, Nairobi, Mombasa, and Marsabit. Interviews were conducted in either English or one of the local regional languages.We found that patient trust in health care providers (HCPs) is integral to vaccine acceptance among pregnant women in Kenya. The HCP-patient relationship is a fiduciary one, whereby the patients' trusts is primarily rooted in the provider's social position as a person who is highly educated in matters of health. Furthermore, patient health education and provider attitudes are crucial for reinstating and fostering that trust, especially in cases where trust was impeded by rumors, community myths and misperceptions, and religious and cultural factors.Patient trust in providers is a strong facilitator contributing to vaccine acceptance among pregnant women in Kenya.

This study evaluated the probiotic potential of Bacillus velezensis LF01 strain, which is antagonistic to S. agalactiae. The active compounds produced by LF01 showed antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of fish pathogens, including S. agalactiae, Streptococcus iniae, Aeromonas hydrophila, Edwardsiella tarda, Edwardsiella ictaluri, Aeromonas schubertii, Aeromonas veronii, Aeromonas jandaei, and Vibrio harveyi. The antimicrobial compounds were heat stable, pH stable, UV stable, resistant to proteases, and could be stored for a long time. To evaluate the probiotic function of LF01 in Nile tilapia, juveniles were divided into three treatment groups: a control group, an interval feeding group, and a continuous feeding group. Tilapia fed with LF01-supplemented diets (1.0 × 10 CFU/g) showed significantly better growth performances than those of the control group (P < 0.05). Tilapia fed with LF01-supplemented diets significantly increased lysozyme (LZY) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities.

Using a time-stratified case-crossover study design and conditional logistic regression, we found a negative association between current day rainfall and readmission (unadjusted: OR = 0.82, p < 0.05; adjusted: OR = 0.83, p < 0.1), which is contrary to our common belief. In lagged models, we observed that rainfall was significantly and positively associated with readmissions at lag 6 days (unadjusted: OR = 1.12, p < 0.1; adjusted: OR = 1.17, p < 0.05) and lag 7 days (unadjusted: OR = 1.13, p < 0.05; adjusted: OR = 1.21, p < 0.01). Additionally, stratified analyses showed the unanticipated finding was only statistically significant for younger patients (< 65 years) and females. Our study adds new evidence that the association between the healthcare-seeking behavior of patients with RA and local rainfall may be different, compared with the positive relationship between symptoms of joint pain and rainfall.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650877>CA 19-9 doubling time in pancreatic cancer as a predictor of venous thromboembolism: a hospital database study.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654387>Immunological Considerations for Retinal Stem Cell Therapy.</a></h2><p>There is an increasing effort toward generating replacement cells for neuronal application due to the nonregenerative nature of these tissues. While much progress has been made toward developing methodologies to generate these cells, there have been limited improvements in functional restoration. Some of these are linked to the degenerative and often nonreceptive microenvironment that the new cells need to integrate into. In this chapter, we will focus on the status and role of the immune microenvironment of the retina during homeostasis and disease states.

In humans, selenium's biological activity occurs through the 25 identified selenoproteins. As total selenium concentration encompasses both functional selenoproteins, small selenocompounds and other selenium-binding proteins, selenium speciation, rather than total concentration, is critical in order to assess functional selenium. Previously, quantitative analysis of selenoproteins required laborious techniques that were often slow and costly. However, more recent advancements in tandem mass spectrometry have facilitated the qualitative and quantitative identification of these proteins. In light of the current alternatives for understanding selenium biochemistry, we aim to provide a review of the modern applications of electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) as an alternative to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for qualitative and quantitative selenium speciation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653827>Invariant NKT cells facilitate cytotoxic T-cell activation via direct recognition of CD1d on T cells.</a></h2><p>Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are a major subset of NKT cells that recognize foreign and endogenous lipid antigens presented by CD1d. Although iNKT cells are characteristically autoreactive to self-antigens, the role of iNKT cells in the regulation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) has been elucidated using α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer), a strong synthetic glycolipid that is presented by professional antigen presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells. Despite the well-known effects of α-GalCer and dendritic cells on lipid antigen presentation, the physiological role of endogenous antigens presented by CTLs during crosstalk with iNKT cells has not yet been addressed. In this study, we found that antigen-primed CTLs with transient CD1d upregulation could present lipid self-antigens to activate the iNKT cell production of IFN-γ. CTL-mediated iNKT cell activation in turn enhanced IFN-γ production and the proliferation and cytotoxicity of CTLs. We also found that the direct interaction of iNKT cells and CTLs enhanced the antitumor immune responses of CTLs. This partially explains the functional role of iNKT cells in CTL-mediated antitumor . Our findings suggest that in the absence of exogenous iNKT cell ligands, iNKT cells enhanced the CTL production of IFN-γ and CTL proliferation and cytotoxicity via direct interaction with CD1d expressed on T cells without interacting with APCs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658782>Methotrexate an Old Drug with New Tricks.</a></h2><p>Methotrexate (MTX) is the first line drug for the treatment of a number of rheumatic and non-rheumatic disorders. It is currently used as an anchor disease, modifying anti-rheumatic drug in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Despite the development of numerous new targeted therapies, MTX remains the backbone of RA therapy due to its potent efficacy and tolerability. There has been also a growing interest in the use of MTX in the treatment of chronic viral mediated arthritis. Many viruses-including old world alphaviruses, Parvovirus B19, hepatitis B/C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus-have been associated with arthritogenic diseases and reminiscent of RA. MTX may provide benefits although with the potential risk of attenuating patients' immune surveillance capacities. In this review, we describe the emerging mechanisms of action of MTX as an anti-inflammatory drug and complementing its well-established immunomodulatory activity. The mechanisms involve adenosine signaling modulation, alteration of cytokine networks, generation of reactive oxygen species and HMGB1 alarmin suppression. We also provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of MTX toxic effects. Lastly, we discussed the efficacy, as well as the safety, of MTX used in the management of viral-related rheumatic syndromes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658543>[Clinical randomized controlled trial on influence of recombinant human growth hormone on the immune function of younger children with severe burn injuries].</a></h2><p> To preliminarily investigate the influence of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) on the immune function of younger children with severe burn injuries.  A total of 30 younger children with severe burn injuries, conforming to the study criteria, were admitted to our hospital from July 2016 to July 2018. They were enrolled in the prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial and divided into group rhGH [=15, 10 boys and 5 girls, aged (22±10) months] and control group [=15, 8 boys and 7 girls, aged (21±7) months] according to the random number table. The patients in control group received anti-shock, anti-infection, and wound caring therapies, etc. On the basis of above-mentioned treatment, the patients in group rhGH were subcutaneously injected with rhGH once every night before bedding, with a dosage of 0.2 IU·kg(-1)·d(-1), from the 3rd day post injury for 7 consecutive days. Before and on the 3rd and 7th day of rhGH treatments, the fasting peripheral venous blood was collected from patients in both groups. Blood glucose level was detected by glucometer. Percentages of CD4(+) T lymphocytes, CD8(+) T lymphocytes, CD3(+) T lymphocytes, CD19(+) B lymphocytes, and ratio of CD4(+) T lymphocytes to CD8(+) T lymphocytes were determined by flow cytometer. Mass concentration of serum immune globulin (Ig) A, IgG, and complement C3 were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Data were processed with Fisher's exact probability test, independent sample  test, analysis of variance for repeated measurement and Bonferroni correction, and Mann-Whitney  test.  (1) The blood glucose levels of children in the two groups were similar before and on the 3rd and 7th day of rhGH treatment (=0.474, 1.652, 1.997, >0.05). The glucose levels of children in group rhGH on the 3rd and 7th day of rhGH treatment [(6.9±1.0) and (7.7±1.1) mmol/L] were significantly higher than (5.9±0.9) mmol/L before rhGH treatment (<0.05). The glucose level of children in control group on the 7th day of rhGH treatment was significantly higher than that before rhGH treatment (<0.05). (2) The percentages of CD4(+) T lymphocytes of children in group rhGH before rhGH treatment and on the 7th day of rhGH treatment were (35.1±2.0)% and (38.5±2.2)%, which were close to (36.2±2.0)% and (33.6±2.2)% in control group, respectively (=0.371, 1.553, >0.05). The percentages of CD4(+) T lymphocytes of children in group rhGH on the 7th day of rhGH treatment[(44.7±2.2)%] was significantly higher than (36.5±2.2)% in control group (=2.624, <0.05). The percentage of CD4(+) T lymphocytes of children in group rhGH on the 7th day of rhGH treatment was significantly higher than that before rhGH treatment (<0.05). The percentages of CD4(+) T lymphocytes of children in control group on the 3rd and 7th day of rhGH treatment were both close to the percentage before rhGH treatment (>0.05). (3) The percentage of CD8(+) T lymphocytes of children in group rhGH on the 3rd day of rhGH treatment was significantly lower than that in control group (=2.107, <0.05). (4) The ratio of CD4(+) T lymphocytes to CD8(+) T lymphocytes of children in group rhGH on the 7th day of rhGH treatment (2.36±0.20) was significantly higher than 1.72±0.20 in control group (=2.285, <0.05). The ratio of CD4(+) T lymphocytes to CD8(+) T lymphocytes of children in group rhGH on the 7th day of rhGH treatment was significantly higher than 2.04±0.19 before rhGH treatment (<0.05). (5) The percentages of CD3(+) T lymphocytes and CD19(+) B lymphocytes of children in the two groups were similar before and on the 3rd and 7th day of rhGH treatment (=1.913, 0.552, 1.327, 1.465, 1.587, 0.407, >0.05). The percentages of CD3(+) T lymphocytes of children in group rhGH on the 3rd and 7th day of rhGH treatment were significantly higher than the percentage before rhGH treatment (<0.05). (6) The mass concentration of serum IgA, complement C3, and IgG of children in the two groups was similar before and on the 3rd and 7th day of rhGH treatment (=-1.596, -0.100, 1.263, -0.220, 1.378, 1.631, =0.228, 0.519, 1.182, >0.05). The mass concentration of serum IgA and complement C3 of children in group rhGH on the 3rd and 7th day of rhGH treatment was significantly higher than that before rhGH treatment(<0.05).  rhGH has little effect on humoral  of younger children with severe burn injuries with limited influence on CD19(+) B lymphocyte, mass concentration of serum IgA, IgG, and complement C3.

HLA likewise forms an integral part of the innate immune response through the binding of killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) molecules, which regulate the response of natural killer (NK) cells. The HLA complex is found on the short arm of chromosome 6 and is the most polymorphic region in the human genome. Africans are genetically more diverse than other populations; however, information on HLA diversity among southern Africans, including South African populations, is limited. Paucity of African HLA data limits our understanding of disease associations, the ability to identify donor-recipient matches for transplantation and the development of disease-specific vaccines. This review discusses the importance of HLA in the clinical setting in South Africans and highlights how tools such as HLA imputation might augment standard HLA typing methods to increase our understanding of HLA diversity in our populations, which will better inform disease association studies, donor recruitment strategies into bone marrow registries and our understanding of human genetic diversity in South Africa.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654769>The hepatoprotective effects of Salvia plebeia R. Br. extract in zebrafish (Danio rerio).</a></h2><p>Salvia plebeia R. Br. is a traditional Chinese medicinal herb that has been widely used for the treatment of many inflammatory diseases such as hepatitis. However, the underlying molecular mechanism about the hepatoprotective effects of S. plebeia remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the antioxidant activities and anti-inflammatory effects of ethanol extracts of S. plebeia (SPEE) in the zebrafish model. Firstly, we determined the chemical compositions of SPEE and identified three major constituents by using GC-MS analysis. After that, SPEE exhibited significantly antioxidant properties in the LPS-induced zebrafish embryos, and the enzyme activities of ROS, CAT and SOD were obviously inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. Secondly, SPEE greatly reduced fat vacuoles (HE staining), lipid accumulation (Oil O staining) and hepatocyte fibrosis (Gemori staining) in the thioacetamide (TAA)-induced hepatocyte injury of adult zebrafish. Meanwhile, the NO contents and lipid metabolism-related genes were substantially down-regulated after SPEE exposure. Thirdly, we used RNA-Seq analysis to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after SPEE exposure in adult zebrafish liver. The results showed that 1289 DEGs including 558 up-regulated and 731 down-regulated were identified between the TAA + SPEE and TAA groups. KEGG pathway and GO functional analysis revealed that steroid biosynthesis, oxidation-reduction and innate  were significantly enriched. Mechanistically, SPEE can considerably reduce the cell apoptosis of hepatocytes and promote the translocation of Nrf2 protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in TAA-induced zebrafish. Moreover, SPEE can modulate various inflammatory cytokines and immune genes both in the control and HO-stimulated conditions. The pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and TNF-α was markedly up-regulated but the anti-inflammatory cytokines such as TGF-β was greatly down-regulated after SPEE treatment. In addition, some key genes in the TLR signaling were also activated in the HO-stimulated conditions. In summary, our results suggested that SPEE had an important role in the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in zebrafish. Some of the components identified in this study may be served as potential sources of new hepatoprotective compounds for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2019.

Forty-days-old female quails were divided into three treatments: T1 (Control) received a basal diet without P. pastoris; T2 (Pichia Effluent) received a basal diet supplemented with P. pastoris grown in parboiled rice effluent and biodiesel glycerol, and T3 (Pichia YPD) received a basal diet supplemented with P. pastoris produced in YPD. The birds were vaccinated against Newcastle Disease (NDV), Avian Infectious Bronchitis (IBV), and Gumboro Disease on days 1 and 28. The following parameters were analyzed: performance, egg quality, humoral immune response to the vaccines, organ weight, and intestinal morphometry. P. pastoris grown in YPD increased egg weight (p < 0.05). The lowest liver weight on day 14 was obtained in Pichia Effluent, whereas both P. pastoris supplemented groups had the lowest duodenum weights on day 14. Besides that, livers and duodenums presented no morphological changes in any of the three treatments. Supplementation of P. pastoris modulated the immune system of the birds, increasing anti-IBV, anti-NDV, and anti-Gumboro antibodies levels compared to the Control (p < 0.05). In conclusion, quail's immune response was improved by Pichia pastoris X-33, either it was grown in YPD or industrial residues, and the egg weight increased with Pichia pastoris X-33 grown in YPD, thereby demonstrating to be a promising probiotic for poultry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657935>Sustained delivery of carfilzomib by tannic acid-based nanocapsules helps develop antitumor .</a></h2><p>A group of chemotherapeutic drugs has gained increasing interest in cancer immunotherapy due to the potential to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD). A critical challenge in using the ICD inducers in cancer immunotherapy is the immunotoxicity accompanying their antiproliferative effects. To alleviate this, a nanocapsule formulation of carfilzomib (CFZ), an ICD-inducing proteasome inhibitor, was developed using interfacial supramolecular assembly of tannic acid (TA) and iron, supplemented with albumin coating. The albumin-coated CFZ nanocapsules (CFZ-pTA-alb) attenuated CFZ release, reducing toxicity to immune cells. Moreover, due to the adhesive nature of TA assembly, CFZ-pTA-alb served as a reservoir of damage-associated molecular patterns released from dying tumor cells to activate dendritic cells. Upon intratumoral administration, CFZ-pTA-alb prolonged tumor retention of CFZ and showed consistently greater antitumor effects than cyclodextrin-solubilized CFZ (CFZ-CD) in B16F10 and CT26 tumor models. Unlike CFZ-CD, the locally injected CFZ-pTA-alb protected or enhanced CD8+ T cell population in tumors, helped develop splenocytes with tumor-specific interferon- response, and delayed tumor development on the contralateral side in immunocompetent mice (but not in athymic nude mice), which support that CFZ-pTA-alb contributed to activating antitumor . This study demonstrates that sustained delivery of ICD inducers by TA-based nanocapsules is an effective way of translating local ICD induction to systemic antitumor .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651363>Systemic and local  following adoptive transfer of NY-ESO-1 SPEAR T cells in synovial sarcoma.</a></h2><p>Gene-modified autologous T cells expressing NY-ESO-1, an affinity-enhanced T-cell receptor (TCR) reactive against the NY-ESO-1-specific HLA-A*02-restricted peptide SLLMWITQC (NY-ESO-1 SPEAR T-cells; GSK 794), have demonstrated clinical activity in patients with advanced synovial sarcoma (SS). The factors contributing to gene-modified T-cell expansion and the changes within the tumor microenvironment (TME) following T-cell infusion remain unclear. These studies address the immunological mechanisms of response and resistance in patients with SS treated with NY-ESO-1 SPEAR T-cells.Four cohorts were included to evaluate antigen expression and preconditioning on efficacy. Clinical responses were assessed by RECIST v1.1. Engineered T-cell persistence was determined by qPCR. Serum cytokines were evaluated by immunoassay. Transcriptomic analyses and immunohistochemistry were performed on tumor biopsies from patients before and after T-cell infusion. Gene-modified T-cells were detected within the TME via an RNAish assay.Responses across cohorts were affected by preconditioning and intra-tumoral NY-ESO-1 expression. Of the 42 patients reported (data cut-off 4June2018), 1 patient had a complete response, 14 patients had partial responses, 24 patients had stable disease, and 3 patients had progressive disease. The magnitude of gene-modified T-cell expansion shortly after infusion was associated with response in patients with high intra-tumoral NY-ESO-1 expression. Patients receiving a fludarabine-containing conditioning regimen experienced increases in serum IL-7 and IL-15. Prior to infusion, the TME exhibited minimal leukocyte infiltration; CD163 tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) were the dominant population. Modest increases in intra-tumoral leukocytes (≤5%) were observed in a subset of subjects at approximately 8 weeks. Beyond 8 weeks post infusion, the TME was minimally infiltrated with a TAM-dominant leukocyte infiltrate. Tumor-associated antigens and antigen presentation did not significantly change within the tumor post-T-cell infusion. Finally, NY-ESO-1 SPEAR T cells trafficked to the TME and maintained cytotoxicity in a subset of patients.Our studies elucidate some factors that underpin response and resistance to NY-ESO-1 SPEAR T-cell therapy. From these data, we conclude that a lymphodepletion regimen containing high doses of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide is necessary for SPEAR T-cell persistence and efficacy. Furthermore, these data demonstrate that non-T-cell inflamed tumors, which are resistant to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, can be treated with adoptive T-cell based immunotherapy.ClinicalTrials.gov,  , Registered 27 April 2011.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664482>TAM-ing T cells in the tumor microenvironment: implications for TAM receptor targeting.</a></h2><p>The TAM receptors-TYRO3, AXL, MERTK-are pleiotropically expressed receptors in both healthy and diseased tissue. A complex of the ligands Protein S (PROS1) or Growth Arrest-Specific 6 (GAS6) with apoptotic phosphatidylserine activates the TAM receptors. Hence, this receptor family is essential for the efferocytosis of apoptotic material by antigen-presenting cells. In addition, TAM receptors are expressed by virtually all cells of the tumor microenvironment. They are also potent oncogenes, frequently overexpressed in cancer and involved in survival and therapy resistance. Due to their pro-oncogenic and immune-inhibitory traits, TAM receptors have emerged as promising targets for cancer therapy. Recently, TAM receptors have been described to function as costimulatory molecules on human T cells. TAM receptors' ambivalent functions on many different cell types therefore make therapeutic targeting not straight-forward. In this review we summarize our current knowledge of the function of TAM receptors in the tumor microenvironment. We place particular focus on TAM receptors and the recently unraveled role of MERTK in activated T cells and potential consequences for anti-tumor .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661465>U3-1402 sensitizes HER3-expressing tumors to PD-1 blockade by immune activation.</a></h2><p>Immunotherapy targeting programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) induces durable antitumor efficacy in many types of cancer. However, such clinical benefit is limited because of the insufficient reinvigoration of antitumor  with the drug alone; therefore, rational therapeutic combinations are required to improve its efficacy. In our preclinical study, we evaluated the antitumor effect of U3-1402, a human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3)-targeting antibody-drug conjugate, and its potential synergism with PD-1 inhibition. Using a syngeneic mouse tumor model that is refractory to anti-PD-1 therapy, treatment with U3-1402 exhibited an obvious antitumor effect via direct lysis of tumor cells. Disruption of tumor cells by U3-1402 enhanced the infiltration of innate and adaptive immune cells. Chemotherapy with exatecan derivative (Dxd: the drug payload of U3-1402) revealed that the enhanced antitumor  produced by U3-1402 was associated with the induction of alarmins including HMGB-1 via tumor-specific cytotoxicity. Notably, U3-1402 significantly sensitized the tumor to PD-1 blockade, as a combination of U3-1402 and the PD-1 inhibitor significantly enhanced antitumor . Further, clinical analyses indicated that tumor-specific HER3 expression was frequently observed in patients with PD-1 inhibitor-resistant solid tumors. Overall, U3-1402 is a promising candidate as a partner of immunotherapy for such patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657672>Dominant, Heritable Resistance to Stewart's Wilt in Maize Is Associated with an Enhanced Vascular Defense Response to Infection with .</a></h2><p>Vascular wilt bacteria such as , the causal agent of Stewart's bacterial wilt of maize (SW), are destructive pathogens that are difficult to control. These bacteria colonize the xylem, where they form biofilms that block sap flow leading to characteristic wilting symptoms. Heritable forms of SW resistance exist and are used in maize breeding programs but the underlying genes and mechanisms are mostly unknown. Here, we show that seedlings of maize inbred lines with  mutations are highly resistant to SW. However, current evidence suggests that other genes introgressed along with  are responsible for resistance. Genomic analyses of  lines were used to identify candidate resistance genes. In-depth comparison of  interaction with susceptible and resistant maize lines revealed an enhanced vascular defense response in  lines characterized by accumulation of electron-dense materials in xylem conduits visible by electron microscopy. We propose that this vascular defense response restricts  spread through the vasculature, reducing both systemic bacterial colonization of the xylem network and consequent wilting.

Surprisingly, activation of plant intracellular immune receptor NLR genes, while enhancing whole plant disease resistance, were sometimes linked to a defective stomatal defense in autoimmune mutants. Here we report the use of high temperature and genetic chimera to investigate the inter-dependence of stomatal and apoplastic defenses in autoimmunity. High temperature inhibits both stomatal and apoplastic defenses in the wild type, and it suppresses constitutive apoplastic defense responses and rescues the deficiency of stomatal closure response in autoimmune mutants. Chimeric plants have been generated to activate NLR only in guard cells or the non-guard cells. NLR activation in guard cells inhibits stomatal closure defense response in a cell autonomous manner likely through repressing ABA responses. At the same time, it leads to increased whole plant resistance accompanied by a slight increase in apoplastic defense. In addition, NLR activation in both guard and non-guard cells affects stomatal aperture and water potential.

Hence, we have previously described spontaneous CD8 and CD4 T-cell reactivity against PD-L1 in the peripheral blood of patients with various cancers as well as in healthy donors. It is well described that the expression of the PD-L1 protein is introduced in cells by pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g. IFN-γ. In the current study, we were able to directly link inflammation with PD-L1-specific T cells by showing that inflammatory mediators such as IFN-γ generate measurable numbers of PD-L1-specific T cells in human PBMCs as well as in  models. These PD-L1-specific T cells can vigorously modulate the cell compartments of the local environment. PD-L1-specific T cells may be important for immune homeostasis by sustaining the ongoing inflammatory response by the suppression of regulatory cell function both directly and indirectly.Copyright: © 2019 Munir et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653831>Dietary tryptophan links encephalogenicity of autoreactive T cells with gut microbial ecology.</a></h2><p>The interaction between the mammalian host and its resident gut microbiota is known to license adaptive immune responses. Nutritional constituents strongly influence composition and functional properties of the intestinal microbial communities. Here, we report that omission of a single essential amino acid - tryptophan - from the diet abrogates CNS autoimmunity in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Dietary tryptophan restriction results in impaired encephalitogenic T cell responses and is accompanied by a mild intestinal inflammatory response and a profound phenotypic shift of gut microbiota. Protective effects of dietary tryptophan restriction are abrogated in germ-free mice, but are independent of canonical host sensors of intracellular tryptophan metabolites. We conclude that dietary tryptophan restriction alters metabolic properties of gut microbiota, which in turn have an impact on encephalitogenic T cell responses. This link between gut microbiota, dietary tryptophan and adaptive  may help to develop therapeutic strategies for protection from autoimmune neuroinflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662347>TIPE2 specifies the functional polarization of myeloid-derived suppressor cells during tumorigenesis.</a></h2><p>Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are "polarized" myeloid cells that effectively promote tumorigenesis by inhibiting antitumor . How myeloid cells acquire the protumoral properties during tumorigenesis is poorly understood. We report here that the polarity protein TIPE2 (tumor necrosis factor-α-induced protein 8-like 2) mediates the functional polarization of murine and human MDSCs by specifying their pro- and antitumoral properties. Tumor cells induced the expression of TIPE2 in Gr1CD11b cells through reactive oxygen species (ROS). TIPE2 in turn increased the expression of protumoral mediators such as CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β while inhibiting the expression of antitumoral mediators. Consequently, tumor growth in TIPE2-deficient mice was significantly diminished, and TIPE2-deficient MDSCs markedly inhibited tumor growth upon adoptive transfer. Pharmaceutical blockade of ROS inhibited TIPE2 expression in MDSCs and reduced tumor growth in mice. These findings indicate that TIPE2 plays a key role in the functional polarization of MDSCs and represents a new therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy.© 2019 Yan et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656948>Acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP): the elusive 'hunger factor' linking autophagy to food intake.</a></h2><p>The best-known appetite-regulating factors identified in rodents are leptin, an appetite inhibitor, and ghrelin, an appetite stimulator. Rare cases of loss-of-functions mutations affecting leptin and its receptor, as well as polymorphisms concerning ghrelin and its receptor, have been documented in human obesity, apparently validating the relevance of leptin and ghrelin for human physiology. Paradoxically, however, the overwhelming majority of obese individuals manifest high leptin and low ghrelin plasma levels, suggesting that both factors are not directly disease-relevant. We recently discovered that acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP), also known as diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI), acts as an efficient lipogenic and appetite stimulator in mice. Indeed, in response to starvation, ACBP/DBI is released from tissues in an autophagy-dependent fashion and increases in the plasma. Intravenous injection of ACBP/DBI stimulates feeding behavior through a reduction of circulating glucose levels, and consequent activation of orexigenic neurons in the hypothalamus. In contrast, neutralization of ACBP/DBI abolishes the hyperphagia observed after starvation of mice. Of note, ACBP/DBI is increased in the plasma of obese persons and mice, pointing to a convergence (rather than divergence) between its role in appetite stimulation and human obesity. Based on our results, we postulate a novel 'hunger reflex' in which starvation induces a surge in extracellular ACBP/DBI, which in turn stimulates feeding behavior. Thus, ACBP/DBI might be the elusive 'hunger factor' that explains increased food uptake in obesity.Copyright: © 2019 Bravo-San Pedro et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657115>PGC-1α inhibits polyamine metabolism in Cyclin E1-driven ovarian cancer.</a></h2><p>Cyclin E1-driven ovarian cancer (OvCa) is characterized with metabolic shift.

Expressions of SMS, SRM, and ODC1 were positively correlated with that of CCNE1, respectively. ODC1 and SMS expressions were significantly correlated with decreased immune infiltrates. PGC-1α silencing significantly decreased invasion and migration in both OvCa cell lines. Both spermidine and spermine levels were significantly increased when PGC-1α was silenced. Targeting SRM significantly decreased spermine level in OVCAR3 cells, which was rescued when PGC-1α was silenced. Silencing of PGC-1α resulted in increased SRM in both OvCa cells. Dinaciclib significantly decreased invasion and migration of OVCAR3 cells. Expressions of PD-L1 and PD-L2 were predominantly in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Dinaciclib showed no notable effect of PD-1 yet substantially induced the increased levels of PD-L1 and PD-L2.Cyclin E1-driven OvCa is characterized with activated polyamine synthesis, which is associated with decreased cancer . Targeting polyamine and CDK2 may therefore sensitize this genotype to immune checkpoint blockade.© 2019 The Authors.

Studies show, however, that DC vaccine priming of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) requires the activity of endogenous DC, suggesting that exogenous DC stimulate anti-tumor  by transferring antigen (Ag) to endogenous DC. Such Ag transfer functions are most commonly ascribed to monocytes, implying that undifferentiated monocytes would function equally well as a vaccine modality and need not be differentiated to DC to be effective. Here, we used several murine cancer models to test the anti-tumor efficacy of undifferentiated monocytes loaded with protein or peptide Ag. Intravenously injected monocytes displayed anti-tumor activity superior to DC vaccines in several cancer models, including aggressive intracranial glioblastoma. Ag-loaded monocytes induced robust CTL responses via Ag transfer to splenic CD8+ DC in a manner independent of monocyte APC activity. Ag transfer required cell-cell contact and the formation of connexin 43-containing gap junctions between monocytes and DC. These findings demonstrate the existence of an efficient gap junction-mediated Ag transfer pathway between monocytes and CD8+ DC and suggest that administration of tumor Ag-loaded undifferentiated monocytes may serve as a simple and efficacious immunotherapy for the treatment of human cancers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657920>Vaccine Adjuvants Derivatized from  Saponins I and II.</a></h2><p>We have derivatized  saponins (MS) I and II through their coupling at C3 glucuronic acid site with dodecylamine. The derivatives show significantly different immunostimulant activity profiles from their respective natural parent saponins. In particular, adjuvant VSA-1 (), the derivative of MS I, potentiates a significantly higher IgG2a responose than the corresponding natural product. Its IgG1 and IgG2a production is similar to that of GPI-0100, indicating a potential mixed and antigen-specific Th1/Th2 immune response, which is different from the Th2  induced by the natural saponin MS I. In addition, toxicity evaluations show that adjuvant VSA-1 () is much less toxic than the widely used natural saponin mixture Quil A. These results prove that derivatizing  saponins can be a viable way for easy access to structurally defined saponin immunostimulants with favorable adjvuant activity and low toxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653777>Time to put down the scalpel?

PD-1/PD-L1 interactions cause functional exhaustion of effector T cells and impair antitumor , allowing tumors to escape immune surveillance. In addition to such extrinsic interactions, tumors proliferate by transmitting intrinsic PD-L1 signals via mTOR pathway. Here, we simultaneously silenced PD-1 and PD-L1 expression on CTLs and colon tumors using PD-1 siRNA/PD-L1 siRNA-loaded PLGA nanoparticles and investigated functional activation of tumor-specific CTLs. When compared to a single PD-1 silencing on CTLs or a single PD-L1 silencing on tumors, co-silencing of PD-1/PD-L1 on CTLs and tumors more efficiently promoted effector functions of tumor-specific CTLs. Moreover, PD-L1-silenced tumors inhibited mTOR signaling and showed an antiproliferative response independently of adaptive immune response. Ultimately, systemic administration of PD-1 and PD-L1 siRNA via PLGA nanoparticles restored the effector functions of tumor-specific CTLs in MC38 tumor-bearing mice. Compared with antitumor effects of PD-1 or PD-L1 single silencing alone, co-silencing of PD-1 and PD-L1 showed more significant tumor growth suppression and long-term tumor inhibition in colon cancer.

The interactions of ZIKV with many different pathways in the human host ultimately determine successful virus replication and ZIKV-induced pathogenesis; however, the molecular mechanisms of such host-ZIKV interactions have just begun to be elucidated. Here, we summarize the recent advances that defined the mechanisms by which ZIKV antagonizes antiviral innate immune signaling pathways, with a particular focus on evasion of the type I interferon response in the human host. Furthermore, we describe emerging evidence that indicated the contribution of several cell-intrinsic mechanisms to an effective restriction of ZIKV infection, such as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, stress granule formation, and "reticulophagy", a type of selective autophagy. Finally, we summarize the recent work that identified strategies by which ZIKV modulated these intrinsic antiviral responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659299>HIV-2/SIV Vpx targets a novel functional domain of STING to selectively inhibit cGAS-STING-mediated NF-κB signalling.</a></h2><p>Innate  is the first line of host defence against pathogens. Suppression of innate immune responses is essential for the survival of all viruses. However, the interplay between innate  and HIV/SIV is only poorly characterized. We have discovered Vpx as a novel inhibitor of innate immune activation that associates with STING signalosomes and interferes with the nuclear translocation of NF-κB and the induction of innate immune genes. This new function of Vpx could be separated from its role in mediating degradation of the antiviral factor SAMHD1, and is conserved among diverse HIV-2/SIV Vpx. Vpx selectively suppressed cGAS-STING-mediated nuclear factor-κB signalling. Furthermore, Vpx and Vpr had complementary activities against cGAS-STING activity. Since SIV lacking both Vpx and Vpr was less pathogenic than SIV deficient for Vpr or Vpx alone, suppression of innate  by HIV/SIV is probably a key pathogenic determinant, making it a promising target for intervention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664861>Editorial Focus on: "Interferonopathy: a potential link between innate  and autoimmunity in the pathogenesis of COPD".</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655128>Proteomic insights into the immune response of the Colorado potato beetle larvae challenged with Bacillus thuringiensis.</a></h2><p>Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins constitute effective, environmentally safe biopesticides. Nevertheless, insects' tolerance to Bt is influenced by environmental factors affecting . To understand larval immune response in the devastating coleopteran insect pest Colorado potato beetle (CPB), we undertook a proteomic analysis of hemolymph of non-treated control larvae and larvae consuming non-lethal doses of spore-crystal mixtures containing the coleopteran-active Cry3Aa toxin. Results revealed lower amount of proteins involved in insect growth and higher amount of immune response-related proteins in challenged insects, sustaining the larval weight loss observed. Additionally, we found a potential regulatory role of the evolutionary conserved miR-8 in the insect's immune response relying on antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) production. Upon toxin challenge, different patterns of hemolymph AMPs expression and phenoloxidase activity were observed in CPB larvae reared on different Solanaceae plants. This suggests that diet and diet-associated insect midgut microbiota might modulate this insects' tolerance to non-lethal doses of Bt.Copyright © 2019.

Although NiV provokes serious diseases in numerous mammalian species, the infection seems to be asymptomatic in NiV natural hosts, the fruit bats, which provide a continuous virus source for further outbreaks. Consecutive human-to-human transmission has been frequently observed during outbreaks in Bangladesh and India. NiV was shown to interfere with the innate immune response and interferon type I signaling, restraining the anti-viral response and permitting viral spread. Studies of adaptive  in infected patients and animal models have suggested an unbalanced immune response during NiV infection. Here, we summarize some of the recent studies of NiV pathogenesis and NiV-induced modulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses, as well as the development of novel prophylactic and therapeutic approaches, necessary to control this highly lethal emerging infection.Copyright: © 2019 Pelissier R et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652531>The Role of Glutamine in the Complex Interaction between Gut Microbiota and Health: A Narrative Review.</a></h2><p>The scientific literature has demonstrated that glutamine is one of the main beneficial amino acids. It plays an important role in gut microbiota and .

The transcription of nisin structural genes can be induced by derivatives of nisin. NisR activation leads to the activation of nisA/Z transcription, which encodes the nisin maturation machinery, nisin regulation and activation of the nisFEG operon to confer . The aim of this study was to express the Lactococcus lactis histidine phosphokinase NisK and response regulator NisR in E. coli, and to perform activity assays and in silico analysis. In silico methods were applied to study the properties and structures of the NisK and NisR proteins, including prediction of physicochemical characteristics, secondary and tertiary structure, stability and ligand-receptor interactions.pET32a and pET28a vectors containing synthetic nisK and nisR genes were transformed into E. coli followed by IPTG induction. SDS-PAGE and western blotting methods were applied to confirm the presence and identity of the amplified proteins. Following purification, the proteins were dialyzed and then prepared for activity assay. The CAI index showed that the genes was compatible with the E. coli host and that the proteins have effective expression. Also, the mRNA prediction results suggest that there is enough mRNA stability for efficient translation in the new host. NisK and NisR recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli with half - lives of around 10 h and were confirmed with molecular weights of 27 kDa and 69 kDa, respectively, by SDS-PAGE and western blotting. The secondary structure of the recombinant proteins as predicted by circular dichroism spectroscopy was similar to the in silico protein structures. Activity assay of recombinant NisK was performed by measuring the amount of consumed ATP according to the light produced by luciferase. Because NisK and NisR have a direct impact on each other, they have an essential role in increasing the production of nisin and they can be used in different research fields. Our results demonstrated that recombinant proteins NisK and NisR preserved their structure and function after expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664929>Inflammatory responses to a pathogenic West Nile virus strain.</a></h2><p>West Nile virus (WNV) circulates across Australia and was referred to historically as Kunjin virus (WNV). WNV has been considered more benign than other WNV strains circulating globally. In 2011, a more virulent form of the virus emerged during an outbreak of equine arboviral disease in Australia.To better understand the emergence of this virulent phenotype and the mechanism by which pathogenicity is manifested in its host, cells were infected with either the virulent strain (NSW2012), or less pathogenic historical isolates, and their innate immune responses compared by digital immune gene expression profiling. Two different cell systems were used: a neuroblastoma cell line (SK-N-SH cells) and neuronal cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).Significant innate immune gene induction was observed in both systems. The NSW2012 isolate induced higher gene expression of two genes (IL-8 and CCL2) when compared with cells infected with less pathogenic isolates. Pathway analysis of induced inflammation-associated genes also indicated generally higher activation in infected NSW2012 cells. However, this differential response was not paralleled in the neuronal cultures.NSW2012 may have unique genetic characteristics which contributed to the outbreak. The data herein is consistent with the possibility that the virulence of NSW2012 is underpinned by increased induction of inflammatory genes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660582>Circulating β-cell-specific CD8+ T cells restricted by high risk HLA class I molecules show antigen experience in children with and at risk of type 1 diabetes.</a></h2><p>In type 1 diabetes (T1D), autoreactive cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are implicated in the destruction of insulin-producing β-cells. The HLA-B*3906 and HLA-A*2402 class I genes confer increased risk and promote early disease onset, suggesting that CD8+ T cells that recognize peptides presented by these class I molecules on pancreatic β-cells play a pivotal role in the autoimmune response. We examined the frequency and phenotype of circulating preproinsulin (PPI)-specific and Insulin B (InsB)-specific CD8+ T cells in HLA-B*3906+ children newly diagnosed with T1D and in high-risk HLA-A*2402+ children before the appearance of disease-specific autoantibodies and before diagnosis of T1D. Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells were detected using HLA class I tetramers and flow cytometry was used to assess memory status. In HLA-B*3906+ children with T1D, we observed an increase in PPI -specific transitional memory CD8+ T cells compared to non-diabetic, age- and HLA-matched subjects. Furthermore, PPI -specific CD8+ T cells in HLA-B*3906+ children with T1D showed a significantly more antigen-experienced phenotype compared to polyclonal CD8+ T cells. In longitudinal samples from high-risk HLA-A*2402+ children, the percentage of terminal effector cells within the InsB -specific CD8+ T cells was increased before diagnosis relative to samples taken before the appearance of autoantibodies. This is the first study to report HLA-B*3906-restricted autoreactive CD8+ T cells in T1D. Collectively, our results provide evidence that β-cell-reactive CD8+ T cells restricted by disease-associated HLA class I molecules display an antigen-experienced phenotype and acquire enhanced effector function during the period leading to clinical diagnosis, implicating these cells in driving disease.© 2019 British Society for Immunology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660347>Impact of Maternal HIV Infection and Placental Malaria on the Transplacental Transfer of Influenza Antibodies in Mother-Infant Pairs in Malawi, 2013-2014.</a></h2><p>Maternal influenza vaccination protects infants against influenza virus infection. Impaired transplacental transfer of influenza antibodies may reduce this protection.We conducted a cross-sectional study of influenza vaccine-naïve pregnant women recruited at delivery from Blantyre (urban, low malaria transmission) and Chikwawa (rural, high malaria transmission) in Southern Malawi. HIV-infected mothers were excluded in Chikwawa. Maternal and cord blood antibodies against circulating influenza strains A/California/7/2009, A/Victoria/361/2011, B/Brisbane/60/2008, and B/Wisconsin/1/2010 were measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI). We studied the impact of maternal HIV infection and placental malaria on influenza antibody levels in mother-infant pairs in Blantyre and Chikwawa, respectively.We included 454 mother-infant pairs (Blantyre, n = 253; Chikwawa, n = 201).

There were more resistant isolates from the stools of uninfected patients than from specimens of patients. E. coli (10%) and Klebsiella (7%) isolates produced a carbapenemase.

By measuring nuclear bomb test-derived 14C in genomic DNA, we determined the turnover rates of CD4+ and CD8+ naive T-cell populations and defined their dynamics in healthy individuals ranging from 20 to 65 years of age. We demonstrate that naive T-cell generation decreases with age because of a combination of declining peripheral division and thymic production during adulthood. Concomitant decline in T-cell loss compensates for decreased generation rates. We investigated putative mechanisms underlying age-related changes in homeostatic regulation of CD4+ naive T-cell turnover, using mass cytometry to profile candidate signaling pathways involved in T-cell activation and proliferation relative to CD31 expression, a marker of thymic proximity for the CD4+ naive T-cell population. We show that basal nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) phosphorylation positively correlated with CD31 expression and thus is decreased in peripherally expanded naive T-cell clones. Functionally, we found that NF-κB signaling was essential for naive T-cell proliferation to the homeostatic growth factor interleukin (IL)-7, and reduced NF-κB phosphorylation in CD4+CD31- naive T cells is linked to reduced homeostatic proliferation potential. Our results reveal an age-related decline in naive T-cell turnover as a putative regulator of naive T-cell diversity and identify a molecular pathway that restricts proliferation of peripherally expanded naive T-cell clones that accumulate with age.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658786>Dose Effects of Recombinant Adenovirus Immunization in Rodents.</a></h2><p>Recombinant adenovirus type 5 (rAd) has been used as a vaccine platform against many infectious diseases and has been shown to be an effective vaccine vector. The dose of the vaccine varies significantly from study to study, making it very difficult to compare immune responses and vaccine efficacy. This study determined the immune correlates induced by serial dilutions of rAd vaccines delivered intramuscularly (IM) and intranasally (IN) to mice and rats. When immunized IM, mice had substantially higher antibody responses at the higher vaccine doses, whereas, the IN immunized mice showed a lower response to the higher rAd vaccine doses. Rats did not show dose-dependent antibody responses to increasing vaccine doses. The IM immunized mice and rats also showed significant dose-dependent T cell responses to the rAd vaccine. However, the T cell  plateaued in both mice and rats at 10 and 10 vp/animal, respectively. Additionally, the highest dose of vaccine in mice and rats did not improve the T cell responses. A final vaccine analysis using a lethal influenza virus challenge showed that despite the differences in the immune responses observed in the mice, the mice had very similar patterns of protection. This indicates that rAd vaccines induced dose-dependent immune responses, especially in IM immunized animals, and that immune correlates are not as predictive of protection as initially thought.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659301>Lypd8 inhibits attachment of pathogenic bacteria to colonic epithelia.</a></h2><p>Mucosal barriers segregate commensal microbes from the intestinal epithelia to maintain gut homeostasis. Ly6/Plaur domain-containing 8 (Lypd8), a highly glycosylated glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein selectively expressed on colonic enterocytes, promotes this segregation by inhibiting bacterial invasion of the inner mucus layer and colonic epithelia. However, it remains unclear whether Lypd8 prevents infection with enteric bacterial pathogens. Here, we demonstrate that Lypd8 strongly contributes to early-phase defense against Citrobacter rodentium, which causes colitis by inducing attachment and effacement (A/E) lesions on colonic epithelia. Lypd8 inhibits C. rodentium attachment to intestinal epithelial cells by binding to intimin, thereby suppressing the interaction between intimin and translocated intimin receptor. Lypd8 deficiency leads to rapid C. rodentium colonization in the colon, resulting in severe colitis with Th17-cell and neutrophil expansion in the lamina propria. This study identifies a novel function for Lypd8 against A/E bacteria and highlights the role of enterocytes as crucial players in innate  for protection against enteric bacterial pathogens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658751> and Probiotics Interactions from a Prolongevity Perspective.</a></h2><p>Probiotics exert beneficial effects on host health through different mechanisms of action, such as production of antimicrobial substances, competition with pathogens, enhancement of host mucosal barrier integrity and immunomodulation. In the context of ageing, which is characterized by several physiological alterations leading to a low grade inflammatory status called inflammageing, evidences suggest a potential prolongevity role of probiotics. Unraveling the mechanisms underlying anti-ageing effects requires the use of simple model systems. To this respect, the nematode  represents a suitable model organism for the study of both host-microbe interactions and for ageing studies, because of conserved signaling pathways and host defense mechanisms involved in the regulation of its lifespan. Therefore, this review analyses the impact of probiotics on  age-related parameters, with particular emphasis on oxidative stress, , inflammation and protection from pathogen infections. The picture emerging from our analysis highlights that several probiotic strains are able to exert anti-ageing effects in nematodes by acting on common molecular pathways, such as insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IIS) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK). In this perspective,  appears to be advantageous for shedding light on key mechanisms involved in host prolongevity in response to probiotics supplementation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659300>Generation of protective pneumococcal-specific nasal resident memory CD4 T cells via parenteral immunization.</a></h2><p>The generation of tissue-resident memory T cells (T) is an essential aspect of  at mucosal surfaces, and it has been suggested that preferential generation of T is one of the principal advantages of mucosally administered vaccines. We have previously shown that antigen-specific, IL-17-producing CD4 T cells can provide capsular antibody-independent protection against nasal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae; but whether pneumococcus-responsive T are localized within the nasal mucosa and are sufficient for protection from carriage has not been determined. Here, we show that intranasal administration of live or killed pneumococci to mice generates pneumococcus-responsive IL-17A-producing CD4 mucosal T Furthermore, we show that these cells are sufficient to mediate long-lived, neutrophil-dependent protection against subsequent pneumococcal nasal challenge. Unexpectedly, and in contrast with the prevailing paradigm, we found that parenteral administration of killed pneumococci also generates protective IL-17ACD4 T in the nasal mucosa. These results demonstrate a critical and sufficient role of T in prevention of pneumococcal colonization, and further that these cells can be generated by parenteral immunization.

Here, we investigate the role of mitochondrial damage and subsequent activation of the cGAS-STING pathway using a genetically engineered animal model of cisplatin-induced AKI and cultured tubular cells. Cisplatin induced mtDNA leakage into the cytosol-probably through BCL-2-like protein 4 (BAX) pores in the mitochondrial outer membrane-in tubules, with subsequent activation of the cGAS-STING pathway, thereby triggering inflammation and AKI progression, which is improved in STING-deficient mice.

Healthcare workers (HCWs), including medical students and resident doctors, have an occupational risk of HBV infection. The study aimed to evaluate the long-term persistence of protective anti-HBs antibody levels in healthcare students and resident doctors at risk for occupational exposure to HBV at 15 years after primary vaccination course. Further objective was to evaluate the anamnestic response observed in non-seroprotected subjects receiving a booster dose. Data were collected from the clinical documentation filled in during the occupational medical check of medical students and resident doctors undergoing Occupational Health Surveillance by the University of Ferrara. Of the 621 included individuals, 27.7% had an anti-HBs concentration < 10 mIU/mL. Subjects vaccinated during infancy had more frequently a concentration < 10 mIU/mL than those vaccinated during adolescence (42.7% vs 6.9%; p-value < 0.001). Multivariate analysis confirmed the statistical significance of the vaccination age. 94 subjects who had an anti-HBs concentration < 10 mIU/mL received a booster dose. The proportion of subjects who had an anamnestic response was higher in those vaccinated in infancy rather than during adolescence (94.1% vs 77.8% respectively). These findings suggest that the anti-HBs concentration decreases below 10 mIU/mL more frequently in subjects vaccinated during infancy. Immunological memory seems to persist after the decline of the anti-HB titer, as observed in response to a booster dose. In conclusion, vaccinated subjects at increased risk of HBV infection should be monitored and a booster dose administered if anti-HBs titer is below 10 mIU/mL.©2019 Pacini Editore SRL, Pisa, Italy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663301>Interrelationship between inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-33, IL-37) and acquired .</a></h2><p>It is now well-known that interleukins (ILs) play a pivotal role in shaping innate : inflammatory ILs are responsible for all innate aspects of immune response, from the very first vascular reactions to the chronic non-specific response to inflammation; while anti-inflammatory ILs are responsible for keeping adaptive  at bay. The interactions between ILs and adaptive  have been long considered secondary to the effects on the innate immune system, but in recent years it has appeared more clearly that IL direct interactions with adaptive  are extremely important both in physiologic and pathologic immune response. In the present review we analyze the role of inflammatory ILs (IL-1, IL-6, IL-33 and IL-37) on adaptive  and briefly discuss the possible therapeutic perspectives of IL-blockade in adaptive  disorders.Copyright 2019 Biolife Sas. www.biolifesas.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654988>Total Glucosides of Paeony protects against collagen-induced mouse arthritis via inhibiting follicular helper T cell differentiation.</a></h2><p>The development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is related to germinal center (GC) response and autoreactive T cells, which mediate adaptive  and play an important role in stimulating the production of autoantibodies and pro-inflammatory cytokines by B cells and macrophages. Total Glucosides of Paeony (TGP) has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and analgesic effects and is widely used to treat RA. However, few studies investigated whether the therapeutic effect of TGP is associated with the inhibition of autoimmune response.The aim of this study was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of TGP on RA.Type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model was used, and TGP and paeoniflorin were intragastrically treated.DBA/1 mice were divided into 5 groups: control, model, positive drug (paeoniflorin) and high- and low-dose TGP group. After 21 days of intragastric administration, the pathological change, inflammation expression and molecular mechanism of each group of mice were detected by Micro-CT, histochemical analysis, ELLSA, Western blot, RT-qPCR and flow cytometry.Our study found that TGP treatment effectively improved inflammation and joint destruction in CIA mice. It reduced the production of serum IgG2a and pro-inflammatory cytokines, including serum interleukin (IL)-21, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-6, and the phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 and STAT3 in a dose-dependent manner. More importantly, TGP could suppress the frequency of germinal center B cells and Tfh cells in the spleen.TGP can not only improve symptoms, but also inhibit bone destruction. The therapeutic effect of TGP on CIA is mainly achieved by inhibiting spleen Tfh cell differentiation and GC formation through STAT3 signaling pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.
