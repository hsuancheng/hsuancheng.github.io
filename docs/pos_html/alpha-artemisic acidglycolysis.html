The data from combat exposed veterans with PTSD shows increased  to lactate flux, reduced TCA cycle flux, impaired amino  and lipid metabolism, insulin resistance, inflammation and hypersensitive HPA-axis. To analyze whether the co-occurrence of multiple metabolic abnormalities are independent, or arises from an underlying regulatory defect, we employed a systems biological approach using an integrated mathematical model and multi-omic analysis. The models for hepatic metabolism, HPA axis, inflammation and regulatory signaling were integrated to perform metabolic control analysis (MCA) with respect to the observations from our data. We combined the metabolomics, neuroendocrine, clinical lab and cytokine data from combat-exposed veterans with and without PTSD to characterize the differences in regulatory effects. MCA revealed mechanistic association of the HPA-axis and inflammation with metabolic dysfunction consistent with PTSD. This was supported by the data using correlational and causal analysis that revealed significant associations between cortisol suppression, hs-CRP, HOMAIR, GGT, hypoxanthine and several metabolites. Causal mediation analysis indicates that the effects of enhanced glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity (GRS) on glycolytic pathway, gluconeogenic and branched chain amino , triglycerides and hepatic function are jointly mediated by inflammation, insulin resistance, oxidative stress and energy deficit. Our analysis suggests that the interventions to normalize GRS and inflammation may help to manage features of metabolic dysfunction in PTSD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31580832>Clinical implications of ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A3 mRNA expression in melanoma subtypes.</a></h1><p>Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity is not only a valuable marker for cancer cells with stem-like features, but also plays a vital role in drug resistance and disease progression in many tumors including melanoma. However, the precise role of ALDH activity in patient prognosis remains unclear. In this study, using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RNA-sequencing expression data, we analyzed gene expression of ALDH isozymes in melanoma tumors to define the expression patterns and the prognostic and predictive values of these enzymes. We found that ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A3 had both higher and broader expression ranges in melanoma patients, and that ALDH1A3 expression correlated with better overall survival in metastatic melanoma. Further, stratification of the TCGA cohorts by the mutational subtypes of melanoma specifically revealed that expression of ALDH1A3 correlated with better prognosis in metastatic BRAF-mutant melanoma while expression of ALDH1A1 correlated with better prognosis in BRAF wild-type melanoma. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of these cohorts identified upregulation in oxidative phosphorylation, adipogenesis, and fatty  metabolism signaling in ALDH1A patients, suggesting BRAF/MEK inhibitor resistance in that subset of patients. On the other hand, GSEA of ALDH1A3 cohorts revealed upregulation in , hypoxia and angiogenesis, suggesting BRAF/MEK inhibitor sensitivity in that subset of patients. Gene expression analysis using pre-treatment tumor samples supports high ALDH1A3 expression before BRAF/MEK inhibitor treatment as predictive of better treatment response in BRAF-mutant melanoma patients. Our study provides evidence that high ALDH1A3 mRNA expression is not only a prognostic marker but also a predictive marker for BRAF/MEK inhibitor treatment response in BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma patients.Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629173>Environmental risk assessment of triazine herbicides in the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea and their toxicity to phytoplankton at environmental concentrations.</a></h1><p>Herbicides have been increasingly used worldwide and a large amount of herbicide residue eventually enters the ocean via groundwater or surface run-off every year. However, the global coastal pollution status of herbicides and their negative impact on marine life (especially phytoplankton) in natural environmental concentrations are poorly understood except for few special environments (e.g. the Great Barrier Reef, Australia). Our field investigation of the distribution of ten triazine herbicides in the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea of China revealed that the concentrations of triazine herbicides exceeded the "No Observed Effect Concentrations" for phytoplankton. Their total concentrations could be as high as 6.61 nmol L. Based on the concentration addition model, the toxicity of herbicide homologues is usually cumulative, and the combined toxicity of these ten triazine herbicides could cause 13.2% inhibition on the chlorophyll a fluorescence intensity of a representative diatom species Phaeodactylum tricornutum Pt-1, which corresponds roughly to the toxicity of atrazine in an equivalent concentration of 14.08 nmol L. Atrazine in this equivalent-effect concentration could greatly inhibit the growth of cells, the maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm), and nutrient absorption of Phaeodactylum tricornutum Pt-1. Transcriptome analysis revealed that multiple metabolic pathways (Calvin cycle, tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle, /gluconeogenesis, etc.) related with photosynthesis and carbon metabolism were greatly disturbed, which might ultimately influence the primary productivity of coastal waters. Moreover, with the values of its bioaccumulation factor ranging from 69.6 to 118.9, atrazine was found to be accumulated in algal cells, which indicates that herbicide pollution might eventually affect the marine food web and even threaten the seafood safety of human beings.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

To date, very few available drugs have been successfully used to treat PDAC due to the poor understanding of the tumor-specific features. One of the hallmarks of pancreatic cancer cells is the deregulated cellular energetics characterized by the "Warburg effect". It has been known for decades that cancer cells have a dramatically increased glycolytic flux even in the presence of oxygen and normal mitochondrial function. Glycolytic flux is the central carbon metabolism process in all cells, which not only produces adenosine triphosphate (ATP) but also provides biomass for anabolic processes that support cell proliferation. Expression levels of glucose transporters and rate-limiting enzymes regulate the rate of glycolytic flux. Intermediates that branch out from  are responsible for redox homeostasis, glycosylation, and biosynthesis. Beyond enhanced glycolytic flux, pancreatic cancer cells activate nutrient salvage pathways, which includes autophagy and micropinocytosis, from which the generated sugars, amino , and fatty  are used to buffer the stresses induced by nutrient deprivation. Further, PDAC is characterized by extensive metabolic crosstalk between tumor cells and cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this review, we will give an overview on recent progresses made in understanding glucose metabolism-related deregulations in PDAC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31429109>In-depth mapping of the proteome of Tibetan pig tenderloin (longissimus dorsi) using offline high-pH reversed-phase fractionation and LC-MS/MS.</a></h1><p>In recent years, Tibetan pig breeding and meat processing have developed rapidly. However, the basic physiological and biochemical characteristics of Tibetan pork have not been systematically explored. The present study conducted a high-throughput analysis of the tenderloin (longissimus dorsi) proteome of the Tibetan pigs and performed a functional annotation and bioinformatics analysis of the identified proteins. Based on offline two-dimensional liquid chromatography fractionation and MS/MS identification, a total of 1,723 proteins were identified in the tenderloin of Tibetan pigs. Gene ontology analysis and pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the proteins involved in respiration (oxidative phosphorylation, /gluconeogenesis, citric  cycle, and pyruvate metabolism) and protein synthesis and metabolism (proteasome, amino  biosynthesis, endoplasmic reticulum protein processing, and ribosomes) were significantly enriched, indicating that the energy production and protein metabolism are the most important physiological processes in Tibetan pig tenderloin. Practical applications The in-depth mapping of the tenderloin (longissimus dorsi) proteome of the Tibetan pigs gives a panoramic perspective at the protein molecular level and provides important information on the mechanisms of postmortem muscle physiology and meat quality formation. Furthermore, the development of Tibetan pork storage and processing technologies would also benefit from the characterization of the biochemical properties of Tibetan pork.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554135>Hepatic transcriptome and proteome analyses provide new insights into the regulator mechanism of dietary avicularin in diabetic mice.</a></h1><p>Many dietary flavonoids existing as glycosides in fruits and vegetables are considered bioactive food components with various potential health benefits. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex and polygenic disease with increasing global prevalence and economic burden. In this study, the hypoglycemic effect of avicularin (quercetin-3-O-α-arabinofuranoside), a flavonoid glycoside commonly found in natural plants and fruits, was determined in a high fat diet/streptozotocin induced type 2 diabetes mouse model. Our results demonstrated that dietary avicularin treatment reduced levels of fasting blood glucose, serum TG and LDL-C, liver AST and ALT, and increased hepatic glycogen in T2DM mice. Furthermore, we used RNA-Seq and iTRAQ to compare the gene and protein expression in the livers of the normal control mice (NC), diabetic control mice (DC) and avicularin treated mice (DA100). The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were analyzed based on gene annotations and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment. Integrated analysis of the RNA-Seq and iTRAQ data indicated that the fifteen DEGs/DEPs showed the same trend in mRNA and protein expression levels in comparisons of both NC vs DC and DC vs DA100. KEGG analysis revealed that four DEGs/DEPs (PKM, PEPCK, PYG, and PLA2) in the , gluconeogenesis, and arachidonic  pathway, and six DEPs (Ndufb4, Ndufa6, Cox5a, Cox5b, Cox6c, and ATPSβ) in the oxidative phosphorylation signaling pathway, play important roles in avicularin's hypoglycemic effect. We also found six other DEGs/DEPs related to T2DM (CA1, Serpinb6a, AK, Pcolce, Cand2, and Atp2a3), and five related to cancer (Phgdh, Tes, Papss1, Psat1, and Fam49b). We did further verify by qRT-PCR and explored the possible binding modes of avicularin with targeted proteins with molecular docking simulations. Taken together, our results demonstrated the protective effects of avicularin against diabetes and provided a global view about the system-level hypoglycemic mechanisms of avicularin by the comprehensive analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data in T2DM mice.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The disruption of energy metabolism pathways by aberrant transcriptional regulation causes the male sterility under low temperatures. The utilization of thermosensitive male sterile (TMS) lines provides a basis for two-line breeding. Previous work, including morphological and cytological observations, has shown that the development process of the TMS line YS3038 is inhibited from the late uninucleate stage to the binucleate stage. Transcriptomics studies could now help to elucidate the overall expression of related genes in a specific reproductive process, revealing the metabolic network and its regulatory mechanism of the reproductive process from the transcription level. Considering the fertility characteristics of YS3038, three important stages for transcriptome analysis were determined to be the early uninucleate, late uninucleate and binucleate stages. The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was found to be highest in the binucleate stage, and most were related to energy metabolism. Quantitative PCR analysis of selected genes related to energy metabolism revealed that their expression patterns were consistent with the sequencing results. Analysis of the fertility mechanism of YS3038 showed that although the tapetum of anthers was degraded in advance of the tetrad stage, the development of microspores did not result in obvious abnormalities until the binucleate stage, because the genes involved in energy metabolism pathways, including starch and sucrose metabolism (SSM), , the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and respiration electron transport chain are differentially expressed under sterile and fertile conditions. Therefore, the pollen in YS3038 was sterile.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31473944>Warburg effect and its role in tumourigenesis.</a></h1><p>Glucose is a crucial molecule in energy production and produces different end products in non-tumourigenic- and tumourigenic tissue metabolism. Tumourigenic cells oxidise glucose by fermentation and generate lactate and adenosine triphosphate even in the presence of oxygen (Warburg effect). The Na/H-antiporter is upregulated in tumourigenic cells resulting in release of lactate- and H ions into the extracellular space. Accumulation of lactate- and proton ions in the extracellular space results in an acidic environment that promotes invasion and metastasis. Otto Warburg reported that tumourigenic cells have defective mitochondria that produce less energy. However, decades later it became evident that these mitochondria have adapted with alterations in mitochondrial content, structure, function and activity. Mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy regulate the formation of new mitochondria and degradation of defective mitochondria in order to combat accumulation of mutagenic mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic . Tumourigenic cells also produce increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting from upregulated  leading to pathogenesis including cancer. Moderate ROS levels exert proliferative- and prosurvival signaling, while high ROS quantities induce cell death. Understanding the crosstalk between aberrant metabolism, redox regulation, mitochondrial adaptions and pH regulation provides scientific- and medical communities with new opportunities to explore cancer therapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31489750>MiR-8-3p regulates hyperthermia-induced lactate secretion by targeting PPP2R5B in boar Sertoli cells.</a></h1><p>Lactate produced by  in Sertoli cells (SCs) is the main energy substrate for developing germ cells and plays a vital role in spermatogenesis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) function as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression in biological processes. We have previously shown that hyperthermia (43°C, 30 min) promotes lactate secretion by inhibiting phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in cultured immature boar SCs. However, it is unclear whether miRNAs are involved in AMPK-modulated  in SCs. In the present study, we identified 349 miRNAs (227 upregulated and 122 downregulated) in hyperthermia-treated boar SCs by next-generation high-throughput RNA sequencing. MiR-8-3p, which was found to be a novel upregulated miRNA in hyperthermia-treated SCs, suppressed the expression of AMPK upstream genes (protein phosphatase 2 subunit B, PPP2R5B), and further downregulated the expression of p-AMPK. The miR-8-3p mimic upregulated expression of glucose transporter 3, lactate dehydrogenase A and monocarboxylate transporter 1, and increased lactic  dehydrogenase activity, lactate secretion, and ATP depletion in SCs; the miR-8-3p inhibitor had the opposite effects on these parameters. Our findings indicate that miR-8-3p acts as a novel regulator of AMPK-modulated lactate secretion by targeting PPP2R5B in hyperthermic boar SCs.© 2019 Wiley-Liss, Inc., A Wiley Company.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31327237>Changes in the Serum Metabolome of Acute Myocardial Ischemia Rat Pretreatment with Electroacupuncture.</a></h1><p>Myocardial infarction (MI), the most common symptom is chest pain, occurs when blood flow decreases or stops to a part of the heart, causing damage to the heart muscle. Electroacupuncture pretreatment (EP) is a recent observation which has been shown to induce ischemic tolerance like the ischemia preconditioning, suggesting that EP may be a promising preventive strategy for individual susceptibility to MI. This study investigated mechanisms that underlie the effect of EP on MI through the use of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolic profiling. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided to receive or not receive three days of EP at PC6 (Neiguan). Then on the fourth day, each group was further divided to undergo mock surgery or MI, induced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. After 24h, the blood samples and hearts were collected for the follow-up research. The results showed that treatment by EP significantly reduced the levels of CK-MB, cTnT, AST, and MDH in serum and decreased myocardial infarction area. According to GC-MS-based serum metabolic profiling and analysis, a total of 636 characteristic peaks were identified, including 158 known and 478 unknown metabolites. MI caused comprehensive metabolic changes in -related metabolites, malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS) metabolites, and purine metabolites with anti-oxidant functions, while EP reversed more than half of the differential metabolic changes, mainly affecting amino  and energy metabolism, especially the glutamate metabolism and MAS. In a word, our findings suggest that EP exerts its cardioprotective effect on MI by regulating amino  and energy metabolisms. Meanwhile, GC-MS-based metabolomics provided a powerful way to characterize the metabolic features of MI, with and without EP, and thereby improved our understanding of the effect and mechanisms of EP.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31507433>Interrelationship Between Contractility, Protein Synthesis and Metabolism in Mantle of Juvenile Cuttlefish ().</a></h1><p>Young juvenile cuttlefish () can grow at rates as high as 12% body weight per day. How the metabolic demands of such a massive growth rate impacts muscle performance that competes for ATP is unknown. Here, we integrate aspects of contractility, protein synthesis, and energy metabolism in mantle of specimens weighing 1.1 g to lend insight into the processes. Isolated mantle muscle preparations were electrically stimulated and isometric force development monitored. Preparations were forced to contract at 3 Hz for 30 s to simulate a jetting event. We then measured oxygen consumption, glucose uptake and protein synthesis in the hour following the stimulation. Protein synthesis was inhibited with cycloheximide and  was inhibited with iodoacetic  in a subset of samples. Inhibition of protein synthesis impaired contractility and decreased oxygen consumption. An intact protein synthesis is required to maintain contractility possibly due to rapidly turning over proteins. At least, 41% of whole animal O is used to support protein synthesis in mantle, while the cost of protein synthesis (50 μmol O mg protein) in mantle was in the range reported for other aquatic ectotherms. A single jetting challenge stimulated protein synthesis by approximately 25% (2.51-3.12% day) over a 1 h post contractile period, a similar response to that which occurs in mammalian skeletal muscle. Aerobic metabolism was not supported by extracellular glucose leading to the contention that at this life stage either glycogen or amino  are catabolized. Regardless, an intact  is required to support contractile performance and protein synthesis in resting muscle. It is proposed that  is needed to maintain intracellular ionic gradients. Intracellular glucose at approximately 3 mmol L was higher than the 1 mmol L glucose in the bathing medium suggesting an active glucose transport mechanism. Octopine did not accumulate during a single physiologically relevant jetting challenge; however, octopine accumulation increased following a stress that is sufficient to lower Arg-P and increase free arginine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31520701>Prenatal dexamethasone exposure-induced a gender-difference and sustainable multi-organ damage in offspring rats via serum metabolic profile analysis.</a></h1><p>Prenatal dexamethasone exposure (PDE) induces developmental toxicities of multiple organs in offspring, but its serum metabolic profile changes before and after birth are unclear. Here, we employed a LC-MS-based metabolomic approach to detect serum metabolites of PDE offspring rats in utero and adulthood, and explore its change characteristics and toxicological significances. Meanwhile, the bodyweight, serum index related to hepatic and renal function were detected. As compared to healthy control rats, PDE reduced offspring birthweight but caused postnatal catch-up growth accompanied by adult liver and kidney function injury. In utero, the differential metabolites in response to PDE were mainly manifested as enhanced , increased protein breakdown and disordered lipid metabolism, and multiple metabolic pathways were changed, which displayed gender differences. In adulthood, PDE offspring showed fewer and inconsistent types of differential metabolites compared to those in utero, which exhibited significant gender differences. The main differential metabolites induced by PDE included lactic , carnitine, cortexolone, bile , phosphatidylcholine, uric  and platelet activating factor, which may participate in dexamethasone multi-organ toxicities and multi-disease susceptibility. In conclusion, PDE could induce a gender-difference and sustainable multi-organ damage in the offspring rats via serum metabolic profile analysis, which will enhance offspring susceptibility to multiple adult diseases.Copyright © 2019.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, inactivation of POR1, encoding VDAC1, produces defective growth in the presence of non-fermentable carbon source. Here, we characterized the whole-genome expression pattern of a VDAC1-null strain (Δpor1) by microarray analysis, discovering that the expression of mitochondrial genes was completely abolished, as consequence of the dramatic reduction of mtDNA. To overcome organelle dysfunction, Δpor1 cells do not activate the rescue signaling retrograde response, as ρ cells, and rather carry out complete metabolic rewiring. The TCA cycle works in a "branched" fashion, shunting intermediates towards mitochondrial pyruvate generation via malic enzyme, and the -derived pyruvate is pushed towards cytosolic utilization by PDH bypass rather than the canonical mitochondrial uptake. Overall, Δpor1 cells enhance phospholipid biosynthesis, accumulate lipid droplets, increase vacuoles and cell size, overproduce and excrete inositol. Such unexpected re-arrangement of whole metabolism suggests a regulatory role of VDAC1 in cell bioenergetics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31519396>Suppression of lactate production of Lactobacillus reuteri JCM1112 by co-feeding glycerol with glucose.</a></h1><p>Lactate produced by lactic  bacteria inhibits their growth. To suppress lactate production, it is necessary to regenerate NAD consumed by  with alternative pathways other than lactate dehydrogenase. In a heterofermentative lactic  bacterium, Lactobacillus reuteri JCM1112, suppression of lactate production by regenerating NAD when producing 1,3-propanediol from glycerol was investigated. The bacterium produced lactate with a yield of 4.7 ± 0.8 g·g-cell in a batch culture using glucose as the sole carbon source. When glycerol was added to glucose at a molar ratio (r) of three in the batch culture, the bacterium produced 1,3-propanediol at 1.6 ± 0.7 g·g-cell·h and the lactate yield decreased to 3.6 ± 0.5 g·g-cell. When glycerol was co-fed with glucose exponentially to give a target specific growth rate of 0.1 h (r = 3), the lactate yield decreased to 1.5 ± 0.2 g·g-cell. The lactate production when glycerol was added together with glucose was reduced to one-third of that observed in the batch culture using glucose as a carbon source.Copyright © 2019 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

To identify candidate  resistance proteins and explore the molecular mechanisms involved in poplar-pathogen interactions, proteomic responses of stem samples from resistant and susceptible poplar ecotypes to  were investigated using nanoflow liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with label-free quantitative analysis. We identified 588 proteins, divided into 21 biological process categories including 48 oxidoreductases, 72 hydrolytic enzymes, 80 metabolic enzymes, and 29 proteins of unknown function. Differential proteome analysis revealed large differences between resistant P. tomentosa and susceptible  Hsu ecotypes before and after inoculation. Among 102 identified proteins, 22 were highly up-regulated in the resistant genotype but down-regulated in the susceptible genotype. Proteins induced in P. tomentosa in response to B. dothidea are associated with plant defenses including oxidoreductase activity (catalase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and superoxide dismutase), phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and phenylalanine metabolism (alcohol dehydrogenase), photosynthesis (ATP synthase subunit alpha, ATP synthase gamma chain, photosystem I P700 chlorophyll a apoprotein A2, photosystem II CP47 chlorophyll apoprotein), carbon fixation (pyruvate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase, malic enzyme, phosphoglycerate kinase, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase, and ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small chain), and /gluconeogenesis (fructose-bisphosphate aldolase).

A hypoxic milieu of the periodontal tissue is generated under periodontitis or during orthodontic treatment, which affects the periodontal and bone remodelling process. Here, we provide a comprehensive proteomic characterization of periodontal ligament cells under hypoxic conditions, aiming to reveal previously unappreciated biological changes and to help advance hypoxia-based therapeutic strategies for periodontal diseases.Human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs) were characterized using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and flow cytometry (FACS). Successful hypoxia treatment of hPDLCs with 1% O was confirmed by qRT-PCR. Proliferation was evaluated using an MTT assay. The proteomic expression profile under hypoxia was studied with the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) approach followed by protein identification and bioinformatic analysis, and western blot verification was performed.The hPDLCs were positive for vimentin, CD73 and CD105 and negative for keratin, CD34 and CD45. After hypoxia treatment, the mRNA expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1a ( was upregulated. The proliferation rate was elevated during the first 6 h but decreased from 6 h to 72 h. A total of 220 differentially expressed proteins were quantified in hPDLCs under hypoxia (1% O, 24 h), including 153 upregulated and 67 downregulated proteins, five of which were verified by western blot analysis. The Gene Ontology enriched terms included the energy metabolic process, membrane-bound organelle and vesicle, and protein binding terms. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis indicated several involved pathways, including /gluconeogenesis, biosynthesis of amino , the HIF-1 signalling pathway, and focal adhesion. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network demonstrated the dominant role of autophagy over apoptosis under hypoxia.The proteomic profile of hPDLCs under hypoxia was mainly related to energy metabolism, autophagy, and responses to stimuli such as adhesion and inflammation. Previously unrecognized proteins including solute carrier family proteins, heat shock proteins, ubiquitination-related enzymes, collagen and S100 family proteins are involved in adaptive response to hypoxia in hPDLCs and are thus of great research interest in future work.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31358595>Fatty  oxidation inhibitor etomoxir suppresses tumor progression and induces cell cycle arrest via PPARγ-mediated pathway in bladder cancer.</a></h1><p>Tumor cells rely on aerobic  as their main energy resource (Warburg effect). Recent research has highlighted the importance of lipid metabolism in tumor progression, and certain cancers even turn to fatty  as the main fuel. Related studies have identified alterations of fatty  metabolism in human bladder cancer (BCa). Our microarray analysis showed that fatty  metabolism was activated in BCa compared with normal bladder. The free fatty  (FFA) level was also increased in BCa compared with paracancerous tissues. Inhibition of fatty  oxidation (FAO) with etomoxir caused lipid accumulation, decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) levels, suppressed BCa cell growth  and , and reduced motility of BCa cells via affecting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins. Furthermore, etomoxir induced BCa cell cycle arrest at G/G phase through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ-mediated pathway with alterations in fatty  metabolism associated gene expression. The cell cycle arrest could be reversed by PPARγ antagonist GW9662.

Mutations in PKM2 are found in some human cancers, however, the effects of these on enzyme activity and regulation are unknown. Here, we characterized five cancer-associated PKM2 mutations, occurring at various locations on the enzyme, with respect to substrate kinetics and activation by the allosteric activator fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). The mutants exhibit reduced maximal velocity, reduced substrate affinity, and/or altered activation by FBP. The kinetic parameters of five additional PKM2 mutants that have been used to study enzyme function or regulation also demonstrate the deleterious effects of mutations on PKM2 function.

Different tumor cells were treated under normoxic and hypoxic conditions with various drugs that affect cellular metabolism. HIF1α was silenced by siRNA in normoxic/hypoxic tumor cells, before RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analyses were performed while using the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 as a model. Differentially expressed genes were further analyzed and validated by qPCR, while the activity of the metabolites was determined by enzyme assays. Under normoxic conditions, HIF1 activity was significantly increased by (i) glutamine metabolism, which was associated with the release of ammonium, and it was decreased by (ii) acetylation via acetyl CoA synthetase (ACSS2) or ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), respectively, and (iii) the presence of L-ascorbic , citrate, or acetyl-CoA. Interestingly, acetylsalicylic , ibuprofen, L-ascorbic , and citrate each significantly destabilized HIF1α only under normoxia. The results from the deep sequence analyses indicated that, in HIF1-siRNA silenced MDA-MB-231 cells, 231 genes under normoxia and 1384 genes under hypoxia were transcriptionally significant deregulated in a HIF1-dependent manner. Focusing on  genes, it was confirmed that HIF1 significantly regulated six normoxic and 16 hypoxic -associated gene transcripts. However, the results from the targeted metabolome analyses revealed that HIF1 activity affected neither the consumption of glucose nor the release of ammonium or lactate; however, it significantly inhibited the release of the amino  alanine. This study comprehensively investigated, for the first time, how normoxic HIF1 is stabilized, and it analyzed the possible function of normoxic HIF1 in the transcriptome and metabolic processes of tumor cells in a breast cancer cell model. Furthermore, these data imply that HIF1 compensates for the metabolic outcomes of glutaminolysis and, subsequently, the Warburg effect might be a direct consequence of the altered amino  metabolism in tumor cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644969>Comparative non-targeted metabolomic analysis reveals insights into the mechanism of rice yellowing.</a></h1><p>Yellowing of rice during storage is a highly concerned issue for managing rice quality whereas the yellowing mechanism is not clearly elucidated so far. Thus, the comparative untargeted metabolomic analysis was performed in this study. The results revealed that  pathway and tricarboxylic  cycle (TCA) were significantly enhanced in yellowed rice, indicating the activated energy metabolism was trigged during the yellowing process. In addition, the increased aromatic compounds (4-hydroxycinnamic  and benzoic ) and their precursors (phenylalanine, tyrosine) suggested the activation of shikimate-phenylpropanoid biosynthesis in yellowed rice, which is an antioxidant defense related pathway. In particular, the pathways involved in the metabolism of glutamate and arginine also significantly altered in yellowed rice. Therefore, the enriched pathways of increased amino , sugars, sugar alcohols, and intermediates of the TCA cycle during yellowing process are proposed to be associated with the response of heat and dry induced by the yellowing process.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Although transsphenoidal surgery are able to achieve extensive tumor removal, the rate of recurrence ranges from 5 to 20% depending on the different subtype. Further understanding of these tumors is needed to develop novel strategies to improve the prognosis of patients. But their metabolic characteristics are largely unknown.We used metabolomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic approaches to systematically investigate eight subtypes of pituitary adenomas and normal pituitary glands. By blocking IDH2, we investigate IDH2 play an inhibitory role in GH tumor cell growth and tumor secretion.We found that all of the pituitary adenomas displayed downregulated glucose metabolism and  compared to normal tissues. Together with the differences in amino  and fatty , we categorized these tumors into three clusters. We then re-established the reprogrammed metabolic flux in pituitary adenomas based on multiomic analyses. Take growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas as an example, we revealed that IDH2 is a key player in the reprogrammed metabolism of such tumors. By blocking IDH2, we confirmed that IDH2 is a potential target for the inhibition of tumor cell growth and tumor secretion.Our study first uncovered the metabolic landscape of pituitary adenomas and demonstrated a possible way to inhibit tumor growth by regulating aberrant metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672987>Rewiring carbon metabolism in yeast for high level production of aromatic chemicals.</a></h1><p>The production of bioactive plant compounds using microbial hosts is considered a safe, cost-competitive and scalable approach to their production. However, microbial production of some compounds like aromatic amino  (AAA)-derived chemicals, remains an outstanding metabolic engineering challenge. Here we present the construction of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae platform strain able to produce high levels of p-coumaric , an AAA-derived precursor for many commercially valuable chemicals. This is achieved through engineering the AAA biosynthesis pathway, introducing a phosphoketalose-based pathway to divert glycolytic flux towards erythrose 4-phosphate formation, and optimizing carbon distribution between  and the AAA biosynthesis pathway by replacing the promoters of several important genes at key nodes between these two pathways. This results in a maximum p-coumaric  titer of 12.5 g L and a maximum yield on glucose of 154.9 mg g.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31585384>Side-stream enhanced biological phosphorus removal (S2EBPR) process improves system performance - A full-scale comparative study.</a></h1><p>To address the common challenges in enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) related to stability and unfavorable influent carbon to phosphorus ratio, a side-stream EBPR (S2EBPR) process that involves a side-stream anaerobic biological sludge hydrolysis and fermentation reactor was proposed as an emerging alternative. In this study, a full-scale pilot testing was performed with side-by-side operation of a conventional anaerobic-anoxic-aerobic (A2O) process versus a S2EBPR process. A comparison of the performance, activity and microbial community between the two configurations was performed. The results demonstrated that, with the same influent wastewater characteristics, S2EBPR configuration showed improved P removal performance and stability than the conventional A2O configuration, especially when the mixers in the side-stream anaerobic reactor were operated intermittently. Mass balance analysis illustrated that both denitrification and EBPR were enhanced in S2EBPR configuration, where return activated sludge was diverted into the anaerobic zone to promote fermentation and enrichment of polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs), and the influent was bypassed to the anoxic zone for enhancing denitrification. A relatively higher PAO activity and total PAO abundance were observed in S2EBPR than in A2O configuration, accompanied by a higher degree of dependence on  pathway than tricarboxylic  cycle. No significant difference in the relative abundances of putative PAOs, including Ca. Accumulibacter and Tetrasphaera, were observed between the two configurations. However, higher microbial community diversity indices were observed in S2EBPR configuration than in conventional one. In addition, consistently lower relative abundance of known glycogen accumulating organisms (GAOs) was observed in S2EBPR system. Extended anaerobic retention time and conditions that generate continuous and more complex volatile fatty  in the side-stream anaerobic reactor of S2EBPR process likely give more competitive advantage for PAOs over GAOs. PAOs exhibited sustained EBPR activity and delayed decay under extended anaerobic condition, likely due to their versatile metabolic pathways depending on the availability and utilization of multiple intracellular polymers. This study provided new insights into the effects of implementing side-stream EBPR configuration on microbial populations, EBPR activity profiles and resulted system performance.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, this procedure requires more precise knowledge about the graft's tolerance to extended cold ischemia. Here, we sought to assess the uterine metabolic alterations after extended cold ischemic storage in a model of auto-transplantation in ewe. A total of 14 uterine auto-transplantations were performed, divided into 2 groups: 7 after 3 h of cold ischemia time (CIT) and 7 after 24 h. Venous uterine blood was collected before uterus retrieval and during reperfusion (30, 60 and 90 min); thereafter, blood gases, lactate, glucose and amino  (AAs) were analyzed. Apoptosis analyses were performed before uterus retrieval and following reperfusion in uterus biopsies. A total of 12 uterine auto-transplantations were successfully performed and 7 ewes were alive ≥8 days after transplantation. After reperfusion, a decrease in pH, a rise of lactate and lactate/glucose ratio and a delayed decrease of pO2 were found in the 3 h CIT group. No significant variation of these parameters was observed in the 24 h CIT group. Significant decreases of AAs were observed during reperfusion and these decreases were more pronounced and concerned a larger number of compounds in the 24 h CIT group than in the 3 h CIT group. There was no significant uterine apoptotic signal in either group. Overall, these results suggest that extended CIT storage delayed restoration of aerobic  and induced an increase in AA requirements of the uterus after reperfusion. However, this biochemical alteration did not reduce success rate for uterine transplantation.© The Author(s) 2019.

Deregulation of cellular metabolism, leading to development of leukemia, occurs through abnormally high expression of transcription factors such as MYC and Ecotropic Virus Integration site 1 protein homolog (EVI1). Overexpression of EVI1 in adults and children with mixed lineage leukemia-rearrangement acute myeloid leukemia (MLL-r AML) has a very poor prognosis. To identify a metabolic inhibitor for EVI1-induced metabolic reprogramming in MLL-r AML, we used an XFp extracellular flux analyzer to examine metabolic changes during leukemia development in mouse models of AML expressing MLL-AF9 and Evi1 (Evi1/MF9). Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in Evi1/MF9 AML cells accelerated prior to activation of , with a higher dependency on glutamine as an energy source. Furthermore, EVI1 played a role in  as well as driving production of metabolites in the tricarboxylic  cycle. L-asparaginase (L-asp) exacerbated growth inhibition induced by glutamine starvation and suppressed OXPHOS and proliferation of Evi1/MF9 both in vitro and in vivo; high sensitivity to L-asp was caused by low expression of asparagine synthetase (ASNS) and L-asp-induced suppression of glutamine metabolism. Also, samples from patients with EVI1+MF9 showed low ASNS expression, suggesting that it is a sensitive marker of L-asp treatment. Clarification of metabolic reprogramming in EVI1+ leukemia cells may aid development of treatments for EVI1+MF9 refractory leukemia.Copyright © 2019, Ferrata Storti Foundation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634482>3-Mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase disruption in dermal fibroblasts facilitates adipogenic trans-differentiation.</a></h1><p>Transitioning from a differentiated state to a higher-order of plasticity, by partial rather than full reactivation of pluripotency genes, might be a better approach in regenerative medicine. Hydrogen sulfide plays a crucial role in the maintenance and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) that have the potential to differentiate to a diverse group of mesenchymally derived cells. It was shown that these cells show a heavy reliance on cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS)-derived hydrogen sulfide (HS) during differentiation. We have found that expression and activity of 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MPST), one of three enzymes that hat regulates HS biosynthesis, is significantly lower in MSC as compared with lineage-restricted dermal fibroblasts. Here, we tested the hypothesis that suppression of MPST in dermal fibroblasts might induce plasticity-related changes and broaden the transdifferentiation potency. Inactivation of MPST with phenylpyruvate (PP) or by siRNA silencing led to diminished HS production associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lactic . Accumulation of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), a key metabolite required for the expression of ten-eleven translocation hydroxylase (TET), was associated with stimulated transcription of pluripotency related genes including OCT4, KLF4, SOX2, and NANOG. Suppression of TET1 gene and inhibition of  with glucose analog, 2-desoxy-d-glucose, or hexokinase II inhibitor significantly reduced expression of pluripotency genes following MPST inactivation or knockdown. MPST disruption promoted the conversion of fibroblasts into adipocytes as evidenced by a significant increase in expression of adipocyte-specific genes, PPARγ, and UCP1, and intracellular accumulation of oil Red-O positive fat droplets. Inhibition of  inhibited these changes. Under induced differentiation conditions, fibroblasts with disrupted MPST show the potency to differentiate to white adipogenic lineage. Thus, MPST inactivation or silencing enhances the plasticity of dermal fibroblasts in a TET1 and  dependent manner and promotes adipogenic transdifferentiation.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In-depth research of gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) plays an important role in preventing the occurrence of gastric cancer. Meanwhile, traditional treatment provides a novel sight in the prevention of occurrence and development of gastric cancer. The current study was designed to assess the effects of therapy with Weipixiao (WPX) decoction on N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG)-induced GPL rats and the underlying molecular mechanisms. After 10-weeks treatment, all rats were sacrificed. Histopathological changes of gastric tissue were assessed via hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and High-iron diamine-Alcian blue-Periodic -Schiff (HID-AB-PAS) staining. To be fully evidenced, RT-qPCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the expressions of LDHA, CD147, HIF-1α, MCT4, PI3K, AKT, mTOR and miRNA-34a, which were crucial factors for evaluating GPL in the aspect of  pathogenesis. According to the results of HE and HID-AB-PAS staining, it could be confirmed that MNNG-induced GPL rats were obviously reversed by WPX decoction. Additionally, the increased gene levels of LDHA, CD147, MCT4, PI3K, AKT, mTOR and HIF-1α in model group were down-regulated by WPX decoction, while miRNA-34a expression was decreased and up-regulated by WPX decoction. The significantly increased protein levels of LDHA, CD147, MCT4, PI3K, AKT, mTOR and HIF-1α induced by MNNG were attenuated in rats treated with WPX decoction. In brief, the findings of this study imply that abnormal  in MNNG-induced GPL rats was relieved by WPX decoction via regulation of the expressions of LDHA, CD147, HIF-1α, MCT4, PI3K, AKT, mTOR and miRNA-34a.Copyright © 2019.

It is now evident that mitochondria are involved in the malignant transformation, cell proliferation, aggression and metastatic behavior of prostate cancer (PC). Recent comprehensive analysis of the mitochondrial oncobioenergetic (MOB) profile of PC cells using microplate-based high resolution respirometry has clearly demonstrated that characteristic MOB alterations occur at different stages of PC development. Additionally, studies have reported that modification of the MOB profile significantly inhibits the growth of malignant cells. This observation suggests that dynamic alterations in the MOB function are a critical component in the development of malignant disease of the prostate. Therefore, quantification of MOB function may be a good marker for the prediction of tumor stage. Future studies may develop novel approaches to measure oncobioenergetics of tumors with minimal invasive procedures effectively in men to determine the general prostate health and tumor staging, and to predict whether a tumor will proceed to malignancy in patients. Additionally, since PC is a slow growing tumor, modulating the MOB profile at specific stages of tumor development may be a novel approach to treat or prevent PC.Copyright: © Vayalil et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562244>Enhancing cardiac  causes an increase in PDK4 content in response to short term high fat diet.</a></h1><p>The healthy heart has a dynamic capacity to respond and adapt to changes in nutrient availability. Metabolic inflexibility, such as occurs with diabetes, increases cardiac reliance on fatty  to meet energetic demands and this results in deleterious effects, including mitochondrial dysfunction, that contribute to pathophysiology. Enhancing glucose usage may mitigate metabolic inflexibility and be advantageous under such conditions. Here, we sought to identify how mitochondrial function and cardiac metabolism are affected in a transgenic mouse model of enhanced cardiac  (GlycoHi) basally and following a short-term (7d) high fat diet (HFD). GlycoHimice constitutively express an active form of phosphofructokinase-2, resulting in elevated levels of the PFK-1 allosteric activator fructose-2,6-bisphosphate. We report that basally GlycoHi mitochondria exhibit augmented pyruvate supported respiration relative to fatty . Nevertheless, both wild type and GlycoHi mitochondria had a similar shift towards increased rates of fatty  supported respiration following HFD. Metabolic profiling by GC-MS revealed distinct features based on both genotype and diet, with a unique increase in branched chain amino  in the GlycoHi HFD group. Targeted quantitative proteomics analysis also supported both genotype and diet-dependent changes in protein expression and uncovered an enhanced expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) in the GlycoHiHFD group.  These results support a newly identified mechanism whereby the levels of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate promote mitochondrial PDK4 levels and identifies a secondary adaptive response that prevents excessive mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation when  is sustained after a high fat dietary challenge.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31360146>Screening differentially expressed proteins from co-cultured hematopoietic cells and bone marrow-derived stromal cells by quantitative proteomics (SILAC) method.</a></h1><p>Bone marrow stromal cells protect hematopoietic cells and provide drug resistance by delivering bunch of variable proteins. Thus, alterations of protein expression are typically associated with cell-cell signal transduction and regulation of cellular functions.Co-culture models of bone marrow stromal cells and hematopoietic cells are often used in studies of their crosstalk. Studies of altered protein expression initiated by stromal cell/hematopoietic cell interactions are an important new trend in microenvironmental research. There has been no report to date of global quantitative proteomics analysis of crosstalk between hematopoietic cells and stromal cells. In this study, we analyzed quantitative proteomes in a co-culture system of stromal HS5 cells and hematopoietic KG1a cells, and simultaneously tracked differentially expressed proteins in two types of cells before and after co-culture by stable isotope labeling by amino  in cell culture (SILAC) method.We have shown that in co-cultured KG1a, 40 proteins (including CKAP4, LMNA, and SERPINB2) were upregulated and 64 proteins (including CD44, CD99, and NCAM1) were downregulated relative to KG1a alone. We utilized IPA analysis to discover that the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway was upregulated, whereas platelet activation was downregulated in co-cultured KG1a cells. Furthermore, 95 proteins (including LCP1, ARHGAP4, and UNCX) were upregulated and 209 proteins (including CAPG, FLNC, and MAP4) were downregulated in co-cultured HS5 relative to HS5 alone. The tight junction pathway was downregulated and /gluconeogenesis pathway was dysfunctional in co-cultured HS5. Most importantly, the significantly differentially expressed proteins can also be confirmed using different co-cultured cell lines.Altogether, we recommend such quantitative proteomics approach for the studies of the hematopoietic-stroma cross-talk, differentially expressed proteins and related signaling pathways identification. The differentially expressed proteins identified from this current SILAC method will provide a useful basis for ongoing studies of crosstalk between stromal cells and hematopoietic cells in co-culture systems. All these result suggested our ongoing studies can focus on the mechanisms underlying CKAP4 increase and CD44 decrease in co-cultured hematopoietic cells, and the increase of LCP1 and decrease of CAPG in co-cultured stromal cell. The proteomic profiles from the KG1a/stromal cell co-culture system give new molecular insights into the roles of these cells in MDS pathophysiology and related bone disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31531187>Betulinic  Suppresses Breast Cancer Metastasis by Targeting GRP78-Mediated  and ER Stress Apoptotic Pathway.</a></h1><p>Targeting aberrant metabolism is a promising strategy for inhibiting cancer growth and metastasis.

Moreover, BA could suppress aerobic  of breast cancer cells presenting as a reduction of lactate production, quiescent energy phenotype transition, and downregulation of aerobic -related proteins. In this study, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) was also identified as the molecular target of BA in inhibiting aerobic . BA treatment led to GRP78 overexpression, and GRP78 knockdown abrogated the inhibitory effect of BA on . Further studies demonstrated that overexpressed GRP78 activated the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor PERK. Subsequent phosphorylation of eIF2 led to the inhibition of -catenin expression, which resulted in the inhibition of c-Myc-mediated . Coimmunoprecipitation assay revealed that BA interrupted the binding between GRP78 and PERK, thereby initiating the  inhibition cascade. Finally, the lung colonization model validated that BA inhibited breast cancer metastasis , as well as suppressed the expression of aerobic -related proteins.

Understanding immune-cell pathobiology is critical to the development of effective therapies to prevent rejection. Over the recent years it has become progressively evident that the complex nature of immune cell behavioral dynamics is strongly dependent on cellular metabolism, which in turn, relies on competition for nutrients, oxygen and metabolites with other immune cells and microbiota. Furthermore, the influence of the inflammatory state can lead to substantial changes in conditions within the tissue micro-environment. Considering the context of immunity, alterations in metabolic pathways (, the tricarboxylic  cycle, the pentose phosphate pathway, the fatty  oxidation and synthesis, and the amino  metabolic pathways) will influence the production of different sets of cytokines and affect transplantation outcome. It is now known that naïve, resting and effector cells acquire different metabolic profiles and studies have shown that specifically targeting some of these metabolic routes can prevent differentiation of effector T cells in favor of Tregs. Ultimately, to develop effective therapies that will prevent graft loss and understanding how cell metabolism impacts the fate and function of immune cells is now a critical point of discussion. The distinct metabolic features and requirements observed in effector and suppressive cell subsets offer promising opportunities for selective regulation of the immune responses in transplantation and will be discussed in this review.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675219>Hepatic metabolomic and transcriptomic responses induced by cecal infusion of sodium propionate in a fistula pig model.</a></h1><p>Short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) are the major products of the microbial fermentation of indigestible carbohydrates. SCFAs are known to improve host metabolism but their underlying mechanism of action remains elusive. In this study, sixteen growing pigs were infused with saline or sodium propionate solution (25 mL, 2 mol/L), respectively through a cecal fistula twice a day during a 28 days experimental period. The results showed that the cecal infusion of the SCFA propionate decreased serum and liver triglyceride levels, and increased serum PYY secretion in growing pigs. Hepatic metabolomics identified 12 metabolites that were significantly altered by propionate. These included decreased levels of lipid metabolism related stearic  and glycerol-2-phosphate; increased levels of TCA cycle components including malic , fructose-6-phosphate, and succinic ; and decreased levels of the amino  metabolism products aspartic  and serine.

The broad spectrum of macrophage functions depends on both heterogeneity and plasticity of these cells, which are highly specialized in sensing the microenvironment and modify their properties accordingly. Although it is clear that macrophage phenotypes are difficult to categorize and should be seen as plastic and adaptable, they can be simplified into two extremes: a pro-inflammatory (M1) and an anti-inflammatory/pro-resolving (M2) profile. Based on this definition, M1 macrophages are able to start and sustain inflammatory responses, secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines, activating endothelial cells, and inducing the recruitment of other immune cells into the inflamed tissue; on the other hand, M2 macrophages promote the resolution of inflammation, phagocytose apoptotic cells, drive collagen deposition, coordinate tissue integrity, and release anti-inflammatory mediators. Dramatic switches in cell metabolism accompany these phenotypic and functional changes of macrophages. In particular, M1 macrophages rely mainly on  and present two breaks on the TCA cycle that result in accumulation of itaconate (a microbicide compound) and succinate. Excess of succinate leads to Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1α (HIF1α) stabilization that, in turn, activates the transcription of glycolytic genes, thus sustaining the glycolytic metabolism of M1 macrophages. On the contrary, M2 cells are more dependent on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), their TCA cycle is intact and provides the substrates for the complexes of the electron transport chain (ETC). Moreover, pro- and anti-inflammatory macrophages are characterized by specific pathways that regulate the metabolism of lipids and amino  and affect their responses. All these metabolic adaptations are functional to support macrophage activities as well as to sustain their polarization in specific contexts. The aim of this review is to discuss recent findings linking macrophage functions and metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31579921>Dietary Garcinol Attenuates Hepatic Pyruvate and Triglyceride Accumulation by Inhibiting P300/CBP-Associated Factor in Mid-to-Late Pregnant Rats.</a></h1><p>Increased hepatic  and lipogenesis are characteristic of pregnancy.The present study aimed to investigate the mechanism of garcinol on the amelioration of hepatic pyruvate and triglyceride (TG) accumulation in mid-to-late pregnant rats.Forty Sprague-Dawley pregnant rats (aged 9 wk, n = 10/diet) were fed a basal diet (control) or that diet plus garcinol at 100 ppm (Low Gar), 300 ppm (Mid Gar), or 500 ppm (High Gar) for 14 d.

Along with the development of new and effective therapies, improved outcomes in patients with multiple myeloma have increased the interest in minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring. However, the considerable heterogeneity of immunophenotypic and molecular markers of myeloma cells has limited its clinical application. 5-Aminolevulinic  (ALA) is a natural compound in the heme biosynthesis pathway. Following ALA treatment, tumor cells preferentially accumulate porphyrins because of the differential activities of aerobic , known as Warburg effect. Among various porphyrins, protoporphyrine IX is a strong photosensitizer; thus, ALA-based photodynamic diagnosis has been widely used in various solid cancers. Here, the feasibility of flow cytometry-based photodynamic detection of MRD was tested in multiple myeloma. Among various human cell lines of hematological malignancies, including K562 erythroleukemia, Jurkat T-cell leukemia, Nalm6 pre-B cell leukemia, KG1a myeloid leukemia, and U937 monocytic leukemia, human myeloma cell line, KMS18, and OPM2 abundantly expressed ALA transporters, such as SLC36A1 and SLC15A2, and 1 mM ALA treatment for 24 h resulted in nearly 100% porphyrin fluorescence expression, which could be competitively inhibited by ALA transport with gamma-aminobutyric . Titration studies revealed that the lowest ALA concentration required to achieve nearly 100% porphyrin fluorescence in KMS18 cells was 0.25 mM, with an incubation period of 2 h. Under these conditions, incubation of primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells resulted in only 1.8 % of the cells exhibiting porphyrin fluorescence. Therefore, flow cytometry-based photodynamic diagnosis is a promising approach for detecting MRD in multiple myeloma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581056>Metabolic crosstalk in the breast cancer microenvironment.</a></h1><p>During tumorigenesis, breast tumour cells undergo metabolic reprogramming, which generally includes enhanced , tricarboxylic  cycle activity, glutaminolysis and fatty  biosynthesis. However, the extension and functional importance of these metabolic alterations may diverge not only according to breast cancer subtypes, but also depending on the interaction of cancer cells with the complex surrounding microenvironment. This microenvironment comprises a variety of non-cancerous cells, such as immune cells (e.g. macrophages, lymphocytes, natural killer cells), fibroblasts, adipocytes and endothelial cells, together with extracellular matrix components and soluble factors, which influence cancer progression and are predictive of clinical outcome. The continuous interaction between cancer and stromal cells results in metabolic competition and symbiosis, with oncogenic-driven metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells shaping the metabolism of neighbouring cells and vice versa. This review addresses current knowledge on this metabolic crosstalk within the breast tumour microenvironment (TME). Improved understanding of how metabolism in the TME modulates cancer development and evasion of tumour-suppressive mechanisms may provide clues for novel anticancer therapeutics directed to metabolic targets.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of overexpression SREBP1a, a potent activator of all SREBP-responsive genes, on the intermediary metabolism of , a glucose-intolerant carnivorous fish. Administration of chitosan-tripolyphosphate nanoparticles complexed with a plasmid driving expression of the N-terminal transactivation domain of SREBP1a significantly increased SREBP1a mRNA and protein in the liver of . Overexpression of SREBP1a enhanced the hepatic expression of key genes in -gluconeogenesis (glucokinase and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase), fatty  synthesis (acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2), elongation (elongation of very long chain fatty  protein 5) and desaturation (fatty  desaturase 2) as well as reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate production (glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase) and cholesterol synthesis (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase), leading to increased blood triglycerides and cholesterol levels. Beyond reporting the first study addressing in vivo effects of exogenous SREBP1a in a glucose-intolerant model, our findings support that SREBP1a overexpression caused multigenic effects that favoured hepatic  and lipogenesis and thus enabled protein sparing by improving dietary carbohydrate conversion into fatty  and cholesterol.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31432511>Mitochondrial dysfunction increases fatty  β-oxidation and translates into impaired neuroblast maturation.</a></h1><p>The metabolic transition from anaerobic  and fatty  β-oxidation to  coupled to oxidative phosphorylation is a key process for the transition of quiescent neural stem cells to proliferative neural progenitor cells. However, a full characterization of the metabolic shift and the involvement of mitochondria during the last step of neurogenesis, from neuroblasts to neuron maturation, is still elusive. Here, we describe a model of neuroblasts, Neuro2a cells, with impaired differentiation capacity due to mitochondrial dysfunction. Using a detailed biochemical characterization consisting of steady-state metabolomics and metabolic flux analysis, we find increased fatty  β-oxidation as a peculiar feature of neuroblasts with altered mitochondria.

Central to the stress response are dynamic changes in metabolism, such as the transition from the  to the pentose phosphate pathway-a conserved first-line response to oxidative insults. Here we report a second metabolic adaptation that protects microbial cells in stress situations. The role of the yeast polyamine transporter Tpo1p in maintaining oxidant resistance is unknown. However, a proteomic time-course experiment suggests a link to lysine metabolism. We reveal a connection between polyamine and lysine metabolism during stress situations, in the form of a promiscuous enzymatic reaction in which the first enzyme of the polyamine pathway, Spe1p, decarboxylates lysine and forms an alternative polyamine, cadaverine. The reaction proceeds in the presence of extracellular lysine, which is taken up by cells to reach concentrations up to one hundred times higher than those required for growth. Such extensive harvest is not observed for the other amino , is dependent on the polyamine pathway and triggers a reprogramming of redox metabolism. As a result, NADPH-which would otherwise be required for lysine biosynthesis-is channelled into glutathione metabolism, leading to a large increase in glutathione concentrations, lower levels of reactive oxygen species and increased oxidant tolerance. Our results show that nutrient uptake occurs not only to enable cell growth, but when the nutrient availability is favourable it also enables cells to reconfigure their metabolism to preventatively mount stress protection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606631>Delaying the biosynthesis of aromatic secondary metabolites in postharvest strawberry fruit exposed to elevated CO atmosphere.</a></h1><p>Aromatic secondary metabolites are closely related to quality attributes of postharvest fruit. In the present study, 20% CO was applied to strawberry fruit to investigate the regulation of elevated CO on aromatic secondary metabolites. The results showed that elevated CO delayed accumulations of anthocyanins, eugenol and lignin. Phenylalanine and tyrosine, the precursors of the above secondary metabolites, were 18.90% and 35.61%, respectively, lower in CO-treated fruit compared with the control on day 6. Furthermore, enzyme activities and transcriptional profiles analysis showed pentose phosphate pathway and  were activated by elevated CO whereas the aromatic amino  (AAAs) pathway was inhibited. These results indicated that elevated CO restricted carbon flux into aromatic secondary metabolism by inhibiting the AAAs pathway, leading to the decrease of phenylalanine and tyrosine, and thus, delayed the accumulation of aromatic secondary metabolites. In addition, the effect of elevated CO was eliminated after transferred CO-treated fruit to air.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study was to investigate ATP levels and the activities of important enzymes involved in  and TCA cycle in livers of embryonated chicken eggs infected by infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). 2. Embryonated chicken eggs (9 days) were randomly divided into two groups (50 eggs per group). The first group was inoculated with a very virulent IBDV (vvIBDV) isolate into the chorioallantoic membrane. The second group was maintained as uninfected control eggs and inoculated with physiological saline. Embryo survival was assessed daily, and six embryos were sacrificed at 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hpi for examining livers. Viral loads in the livers were evaluated by qRT-PCR. A comparative analysis of markers associated with the regulation of energy metabolism across several functional classes (ATP, pyruvic and lactic , mitochondrial protein, NAD+/NADH ratios, and enolase, lactic  dehydrogenase and the respiratory chain complex I activities) were examined in the context of IBDV infection. 3. The results indicated that increases in the enzymatic activities associated with glycolytic metabolism in turn affected the synthesis and cytoplasmic concentrations of ATP at early timepoints in infected chicken embryos. Subsequently, energy metabolism was inhibited through the pathological perturbations of metabolic enzymes and mitochondrial damage, as inferred from reduced ATP generation. 4. These results suggested impaired bioenergetics, which may lead to liver dysfunction consequent to IBDV infection, contributing to the disease pathogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31347673>Changes in cecum microbial community in response to total sulfur amino  (TSAA: DL-methionine) in antibiotic-free and supplemented poultry birds.</a></h1><p>The effect of essential total sulfur amino  (TSAA) like methionine and cysteine on the cecal microbiome of broilers was investigated at 2 different time points (days 21 and 42) of broiler rearing. A total of 360-day-old Cobb male broiler chicks were randomly distributed to 6 dietary treatments in a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement, with 2 levels of antibiotic growth promoters (AGP: 0 and 0.05%) and 3 levels of TSAA (DL-methionine) either for starter (0.7, 0.8, and 0.9%) or finisher chicks (0.52, 0.62, and 0.72%), labeled as diets 1 to 6. Cecal digesta from each replicate (n = 10) were sampled on days 21 and 42. DNA was extracted for the amplification of the V4 region of bacterial 16S rRNA genes and subjected to Illumina sequencing. Bioinformatic analyses were performed using QIIME, Mothur, and ad hoc tools and functional profiles of the inferred metagenome were analyzed using PICRUST. Statistical difference was determined by 2-way ANOVA and PERMANOVA. Clustering of cecal communities using PCoA showed clear separation of microbial communities based on age (P < 0.05) of birds and between low and medium/ high levels of TSAA (DL-methionine). At day 21, bacterial richness and diversity were higher than at day 42 where Clostridium cluster XI and Lactobacillus were found most abundant. No variability in taxonomic richness at the genus level was observed with AGP and DL-methionine supplementation. Interbird variation for richness was greater at day 42 compared to day 21. The mean fold difference of richness was greater (1.5 mean fold) with diets 1 and 6, suggesting interactive effects of AGP and TSAA (DL-methionine) in the diet. KEGG function profiles calculated by PICRUST suggest that the cecal microbiome increased  and energy generation correlated with increased dietary TSAA (DL-methionine) supplementation levels during the late broiler growth period (day 42).

In this study, we performed comparative proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses of gluteus muscle tissues from MSTN transgenic cattle using a shotgun-based tandem mass tag (TMT) 6-plex labeling method to explore the signaling pathway of MSTN in metabolic cross-talk and cellular metabolism during muscle development. A total of 72 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and 36 differentially expressed phosphoproteins (DEPPs) were identified in MSTN cattle compared to wild-type cattle. Bioinformatics analyses showed that MSTN knockout increased the activity of many key enzymes involved in fatty  β-oxidation and  processes in cattle. Furthermore, comprehensive pathway analyses and hypothesis-driven AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity assays suggested that MSTN knockout triggers the activation of AMPK signaling pathways to regulate glucose and lipid metabolism by increasing the AMP/ATP ratio. Our results shed new light on the potential regulatory mechanism of MSTN associated with metabolic cross-talk in muscle development, which can be used in animal breeding to improve meat production in livestock animals, and can also provide valuable insight into treatments for obesity and diabetes mellitus in humans.Copyright © 2019.

In the white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei, two protein subunits (LDH-1 and LDH-2) were previously identified, deduced from two different transcripts that come from the same LDH gene by processing via mutually exclusive alternative splicing. LDH-1 contains exon five and LDH-2 contains exon six and the two proteins differ only in 15 amino  residues. Both subunits were independently cloned and overexpressed in E. coli as a fusion protein containing a chitin binding domain. Previously, recombinant LDH-2 was successfully purified and characterized, but LDH-1 was insoluble and aggregated forming inclusion bodies. We report the production of soluble LDH-1 by testing different pHs in the buffers used to lyse the bacterial cells before the purification step and the characterization of the purified protein to show that the cDNA indeed codes for a functional and active protein. The recombinant native protein is a homotetramer of approximately 140 kDa composed by 36 kDa subunits and has higher affinity for pyruvate than for lactate. LDH-1 has an optimum pH of 7.5 and is stable between pH 8.0 and 9.0; pH data analysis showed two pKa values of 6.1 ± 0.15 and 8.8 ± 0.15 suggesting a histidine and asparagine, respectively, involved in the active site.

Cancer cells overexpress CD98hc-transporters in order to meet their increased nutritional and antioxidant demands, since they provide branched-chain AA (BCAA) and aromatic AA (AAA) availability while protecting cells from oxidative stress. Here we show that BCAA and AAA shortage phenocopies the inhibition of mTORC1 signalling, protein synthesis and cell proliferation caused by CD98hc ablation. Furthermore, our data indicate that CD98hc sustains glucose uptake and , and, as a consequence, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Thus, loss of CD98hc triggers a dramatic reduction in the nucleotide pool, which leads to replicative stress in these cells, as evidenced by the enhanced DNA Damage Response (DDR), S-phase delay and diminished rate of mitosis, all recovered by nucleoside supplementation. In addition, proper BCAA and AAA availability sustains the expression of the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase. In this regard, BCAA and AAA shortage results in decreased content of deoxynucleotides that triggers replicative stress, also recovered by nucleoside supplementation.

Our method in this study involved different raising patterns within the semi free-grazing farm (FF) or indoor feeding farm (DF), the measurement of fat deposition and myofiber type by paraffin section and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and the identification of microbiome and functional capacities associated with meat quality through metagenomic sequencing.Results showed that the fat area in muscle and adipose tissue and the myofiber density significantly increased in the pigs of the FF group. The relative abundance of bacteria associated with lipid metabolism, such as g_Oscillibacter, in the feces of the FF group was higher than that in DF group, and the relative abundance of some bacteria with probiotic function, including g_Lactobacillus and g_Clostridium, was lower than that in DF group. The abundance of g_Clostridium was significantly positively correlated with the intramuscular fat area, whereas health-related bacteria, such as g_Butyricicoccus, g_Eubacterium, g_Phascolarctobacterium and g_Oribacterium, was significantly negatively correlated with abdominal fat area, myofiber density and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) mRNA expression.

The hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) signaling pathway plays a vital role in regulating these metabolic changes. This review initially summarizes the HIF-driven changes in metabolic dynamics of innate immune cells in response to sepsis. The hyperinflammatory phase of sepsis is accompanied by a metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to HIF-1α mediated . Furthermore, HIF driven alterations in arginine metabolism also occur during this phase. This promotes sepsis pathophysiology and the development of clinical symptoms. These early metabolic changes are followed by a late immunotolerant phase, in which suppressed HIF signaling promotes a switch from aerobic  to fatty  oxidation, with a subsequent anti-inflammatory response developing. Recently the molecular mechanisms controlling HIF activation during these early and late phases have begun to be elucidated. In the final part of this review the contribution of toll-like receptors, transcription factors, metabolic intermediates, kinases and reactive oxygen species, in governing the HIF-induced metabolic reprogramming of innate immune cells will be discussed. Importantly, understanding these regulatory mechanisms can lead to the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies targeting the HIF-dependent metabolic state of innate immune cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31536301>Biochemistry, Anaerobic .</a></h1><p>Through the process of , one molecule of glucose is broken down to form two molecules of pyruvate.

Aptly named due to its dependence on oxygen as the final electron acceptor, oxidative phosphorylation cannot take place in the absence of oxygen.

Mechanisms were investigated by mRNA sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation, bisulfite sequencing and  rates.PM2.5 impaired differentiation of T cells, promoted differentiation of Th17 cells, and aggravated asthma in an AhR-dependent manner.

Exposure to PM2.5 and IP enhanced glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (Got)1 expression via AhRs and accumulation of R-2-hydroxyglutarate, which inhibited ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase-2 activity, resulting in hypermethylation in the forkhead box p3 locus and impaired differentiation of T cells. A Got1 inhibitor, (aminooxy)acetic , ameliorated asthma by shifting differentiation of Th17 cells to T cells.

In addition, mitochondrial abnormalities have been frequently observed in muscle biopsy specimens of Pompe patients. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) using alglucosidase alfa, a recombinant human GAA, is so far the only available therapy. We evaluated  and basal respiration in primary human myoblasts from patients with Pompe disease and in mouse myoblasts from GAA knockout mice before and after alglucosidase alfa treatment.We tested patient-derived primary human myoblasts and immortalized GAA mouse myoblasts for GAA activity, glycolytic activity, and mitochondrial respiration before and after alglucosidase alfa treatment using enzyme activity assays and SeaHorse measurements.A significant reduction in  (30%) and in mitochondrial respiration (50%) was observed in both, human and mouse GAA-deficient myoblasts. Treatment with alglucosidase alfa resulted in partial recovery of both metabolic pathways with some variability in human myoblasts.Future assessments of treatment efficacy should include screening for the metabolic effects on both  and mitochondrial respiration in order to obtain a better read-out of the cellular energy metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615403>Short-term inhibition of glutamine synthetase leads to reprogramming of amino  and lipid metabolism in roots and leaves of tea plant (Camellia sinensis L.).</a></h1><p>Nitrogen (N) nutrition significantly affected metabolism and accumulation of quality-related compounds in tea plant (Camellia sinensis L.). Little is known about the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of short-term repression of N metabolism on tea roots and leaves for a short time.In this study, we subjected tea plants to a specific inhibitor of glutamine synthetase (GS), methionine sulfoximine (MSX), for a short time (30 min) and investigated the effect of the inhibition of N metabolism on the transcriptome and metabolome of quality-related compounds. Our results showed that GS activities in tea roots and leaves were significantly inhibited upon MSX treatment, and both tissue types showed a sensitive metabolic response to GS inhibition. In tea leaves, the hydrolysis of theanine decreased with the increase in theanine and free ammonium content. The biosynthesis of all other amino  was repressed, and the content of N-containing lipids declined, suggesting that short-term inhibition of GS reduces the level of N reutilization in tea leaves. Metabolites related to  and the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle accumulated after GS repression, whereas the content of amino  such as glycine, serine, isoleucine, threonine, leucine, and valine declined in the MXS treated group. We speculate that the biosynthesis of amino  is affected by  and the TCA cycle in a feedback loop.Overall, our data suggest that GS repression in tea plant leads to the reprogramming of amino  and lipid metabolic pathways.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31414969>Inhibition of cancer metabolism: a patent landscape.</a></h1><p>Cancer metabolism is currently a hot topic.

Despite years of research, we still do not understand how each organ responds to the reintroduction of blood flow after prolonged CA. Following changes in metabolites of individual organs after CA and resuscitation gives context to the efficiency and limitations of current resuscitation protocols. Methods and Results Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were arbitrarily assigned into 3 groups: control, 20 minutes of CA, or 20 minutes of CA followed by 30 minutes of cardiopulmonary bypass resuscitation. The rats were euthanized by decapitation to harvest brain, heart, kidney, and liver tissues. The obtained tissue samples were analyzed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-high-accuracy mass spectrometry for comprehensive metabolomics evaluation. After resuscitation, the brain showed decreased  metabolites and fatty  and increased amino  compared with control. Similarly, the heart displayed alterations mostly in amino . The kidney showed decreased amino  and fatty  pools with severely increased tricarboxylic  cycle metabolites following resuscitation, while the liver showed minimal alterations with slight changes in the lipid pool. Each tissue has a distinct pattern of metabolite changes after ischemia/reperfusion. Furthermore, resuscitation worsens the metabolic dysregulation in the brain and kidney, while it normalizes metabolism in the heart. Conclusions Developing metabolic profiles using a global metabolome analysis identifies the variable nature of metabolites in individual organs after CA and reperfusion, establishing a stark contrast between the normalized heart and liver and the exacerbated brain and kidney, only after the reestablishment of blood circulation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572179>Effects of Tianshu Capsule on Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats as Revealed by H-NMR-Based Metabolic Profiling.</a></h1><p>Hypertension is one of the most common cardiovascular diseases, resulting in serious complications such as cardiovascular damage and chronic kidney disease. Tianshu capsule (TSC), composed of Chuanxiong (Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort) and Tianma (Gastrodiaelata Blume), has been widely used to treat the blood stasis type of headache and migraine in clinic. Results of previous research showed its antihypertensive effects, but the underlying mechanisms were still unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antihypertensive effect of TSC on spontaneously hypertensive rats by H NMR-based metabonomics and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELIAS), explore potential biomarkers and targets, and probe the potential mechanism of TSC on antihypertensive treatment. The results showed that TSC could decrease the product of oxidative stress (MDA) and enhance the activities of SOD and GSH-Px, down-regulate the expression of enzymes (LDHA, PKM2 and HK2) related to , and perturb the levels of a series of amino  (isoleucine, alanine, asparagine, citrate, etc.) and pathways. Multivariate statistical analyses showed remarkable changes in some endogenous metabolites after administrating TSC related to oxidative stress, amino  metabolism and energy metabolism disturbances. Some enzymes (alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase-2, tyrosine hydroxylase, dopa decarboxylase, etc.) related to metabolic biomarkers were predicted as the potential targets of TSC treatment on SHRs. The discoveries are helpful to understand the antihypertensive mechanism of TSC and provide theoretical evidence for its future research, development and clinical use.Copyright © 2019 Gao, Wang, Wang, Wang, Wang, Ma, Li, Zhao and Chen.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31493436>Classical monocytes from older adults maintain capacity for metabolic compensation during glucose deprivation and lipopolysaccharide stimulation.</a></h1><p>Inflammaging is the chronic low-grade inflammation that occurs with age that contributes to the pathology of age-related diseases. Monocytes are innate immune cells that become dysregulated with age and which can contribute to inflammaging. Metabolism plays a key role in determining immune cell functions, with anti-inflammatory cells primarily relying on fatty  oxidation and pro-inflammatory cells primarily relying on . It was recently shown that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated monocytes can compensate for a lack of glucose by utilizing fatty  oxidation. Given that mitochondrial function decreases with age, we hypothesized that classical monocytes taken from aged individuals would have an impaired ability to upregulate oxidative metabolism along with impaired effector functions. Aging did not impair LPS-induced oxygen consumption rate during glucose deprivation as measured on a Seahorse XFp system. Additionally, aged classical monocytes maintained inflammatory gene expression responses and phagocytic capacity during LPS stimulation in the absence of glucose. In conclusion, aged classical monocytes maintain effector and metabolic functions during glucose deprivation, at least in an ex vivo context.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

To understand comprehensive metabolic disturbances in this model, both cell lysates and culture supernatants were subjected to metabolomic analysis. As expected from the fact that MPP inhibits mitochondrial complex I, a metabolic shift from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to  was indicated by an increase in extracellular lactic  and a parallel depletion of pyruvic . In cell lysates, the metabolic shift was supported by consistent decreases in TCA cycle intermediates. Metabolomic analysis also revealed aberrant choline metabolism.

However, little is known about their effects on early recurrent miscarriage (RM). Here we aimed to investigate the role of lncRNA EPB41L4A-AS1 on placental trophoblast cell metabolic reprogramming, which might be involved in the pathogenesis of RM. After microarray and GEO database analyses, we found that EPB41L4A-AS1 was significantly increased in early RM placental tissue, and this increase may relate to estradiol-mediated upregulation of PGC-1α. EPB41L4A-AS1 overexpression inhibits  but increases the dependence on fatty  oxidation in mitochondrion metabolism and suppresses the Warburg effect, which is necessary for rapid growth of the placental villus, leading to miscarriage. Mechanistic analyses demonstrated that EPB41L4A-AS1 functions as a lncRNA in the regulation of VDAC1 and HIF-1α expression through enhancement of H3K4me3 levels in the promoters of VDAC1 and HIF1A-AS1, a natural antisense transcript (NAT) lncRNA of HIF-1α. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that aberrant expression of EPB41L4A-AS1 is involved in the etiology of early RM, and it may be a candidate diagnostic hallmark and a potential therapeutic target for early RM treatment.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Potential mechanisms of CI-AKI may involve diminished renal hemodynamics, inflammatory responses, and direct cytotoxicity. The hypothesis for this study is that diatrizoic  (DA) induces direct cytotoxicity to human proximal tubule (HK-2) cells via calcium dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress. HK-2 cells were exposed to 0-30 mg I/mL DA or vehicle for 2-24 h. Conversion of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and trypan blue exclusion indicated a decrease in mitochondrial and cell viability within 2 and 24 h, respectively. Mitochondrial dysfunction was apparent within 8 h post exposure to 15 mg I/mL DA as shown by Seahorse XF cell mito and  Stress tests. Mitophagy was increased at 8 h by 15 mg I/mL DA as confirmed by elevated LC3BII/I expression ratio. HK-2 cells pretreated with calcium level modulators BAPTA-AM, EGTA, or 2-aminophenyl borinate abrogated DA-induced mitochondrial damage. DA increased oxidative stress biomarkers of protein carbonylation and 4-hydroxynonenol (4HNE) adduct formation. Caspase 3 and 12 activation was induced by DA compared to vehicle at 24 h.

These filarial nematodes have evolved an obligate mutualistic association with an intracellular bacterium, Wolbachia, a symbiont that is essential for the successful development, reproduction, and survival of adult filarial worms. Elimination of the bacteria causes adult worms to die, making Wolbachia a primary target for developing new interventional tools to combat filariases. To further explore Wolbachia as a promising indirect macrofilaricidal drug target, the essential cellular processes that define the symbiotic Wolbachia-host interactions need to be identified. Genomic analyses revealed that while filarial nematodes encode all the enzymes necessary for , Wolbachia does not encode the genes for three glycolytic enzymes: hexokinase, 6-phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase. These enzymes are necessary for converting glucose into pyruvate. Wolbachia, however, has the full complement of genes required for gluconeogenesis starting with pyruvate, and for energy metabolism via the tricarboxylic  cycle. Therefore, we hypothesized that Wolbachia might depend on host  to maintain a mutualistic association with their parasitic host. We did conditional experiments in vitro that confirmed that  and its end-product, pyruvate, sustain this symbiotic relationship. Analysis of alternative sources of pyruvate within the worm indicated that the filarial lactate dehydrogenase could also regulate the local intracellular concentration of pyruvate in proximity to Wolbachia and thus help control bacterial growth via molecular interactions with the bacteria. Lastly, we have shown that the parasite's pyruvate kinase, the enzyme that performs the last step in , could be a potential novel anti-filarial drug target. Establishing that  is an essential component of symbiosis in filarial worms could have a broader impact on research focused on other intracellular bacteria-host interactions where the role of  in supporting intracellular survival of bacteria has been reported.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31451213>Autophagy and cancer cell metabolism.</a></h1><p>Autophagy is an ancient catabolic process used by cells to clear excess or dysfunctional organelles and large subcellular structures and thus performs an important housekeeping role for the cell. Autophagy is acutely sensitive to nutrient availability and is upregulated at a transcriptional and posttranslational level in response to nutrient deprivation. This serves to promote turnover of cellular content and recycling of nutrients for continued growth and survival. While important for most normal tissues, tumor cells appear to be particularly dependent on autophagy for survival under ischemic or therapeutic stress, and in response to loss of matrix attachment; autophagy is upregulated markedly in cancers as they progress to malignancy. Ras-driven tumors appear to be particularly dependent on autophagy and thus inhibition of autophagy is being pursued as a productive clinical approach for such cancers. However, this enthusiasm needs to be offset against possible negative effects of autophagy inhibition on normal tissue function and on limiting antitumor immune responses. In addressing all of these topics, we focus in on understanding how autophagy is induced by nutrient stress, its role in recycling metabolites for growing tumors, how selective forms of autophagy, such as mitophagy and ribophagy contribute specifically to tumorigenesis, how autophagy in the tumor microenvironment and throughout the animal affects access of the tumor to nutrients, and finally how different oncogenic pathways may determine which tumors respond to autophagy inhibition and which ones will not.© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, little is known about how this transition affects the rumen epithelial gene expression. This study assessed the effects of the transition from a high forage to a high concentrate diet as well as the transition from a high concentrate to a high forage diet on a variety of genes as well as ruminal papillae morphology in rumen fistulated Jersey steers. Jersey steers (n = 5) were fed either a high forage diet (80% forage and 20% grain) and transitioned to a high concentrate diet (20% forage and 80% grain) or a high concentrate diet (40% forage and 60% grain) and transitioned to a high forage diet (100% forage). Papillae from the rumen were collected for histology and RT-qPCR analysis. Body weight had a tendency for significant difference (p = .08). Histological analysis did not show changes in papillae length or width in steers transitioning from a high forage to a high concentrate diet or vice versa (p > .05). Genes related to cell membrane structure (CLDN1, CLDN4, DSG1), fatty  metabolism (CPT1A, ACADSB),  (PFKL), ketogenesis (HMGCL, HMGCS2, ACAT1), lactate/pyruvate (LDHA), oxidative stress (NQO1), tissue growth (AKT3, EGFR, EREG, IGFBP5, IRS1) and the urea cycle (SLC14A1) were considered in this study. Overall, genes related to fatty  metabolism (ACADSB) and growth and development (AKT3 and IGFBP5) had a tendency for a treatment × day on trial interaction effect. These profiles may be indicators of rumen epithelial adaptations in response to changes in diet. In conclusion, these results indicate that changes in the composition of the diet can alter the expression of genes with specific functions in rumen epithelial metabolism.© 2019 The Authors.

This study aimed to determine if 1-triple TTA could influence carbohydrate metabolism. Male Wistar rats were treated for three weeks with oral supplementation of 100 mg/kg body weight 1-triple TTA. Blood glucose and insulin levels, and liver carbohydrate metabolism gene expression and enzyme activities were determined. In addition, human myotubes and Huh7 liver cells were treated with 1-triple TTA, and glucose and fatty  oxidation were determined. The level of plasma insulin was significantly reduced in 1-triple TTA-treated rats, resulting in a 32% reduction in the insulin/glucose ratio. The hepatic glucose and glycogen levels were lowered by 22% and 49%, respectively, compared to control. This was accompanied by lower hepatic gene expression of phosphenolpyruvate carboxykinase, the rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis, and Hnf4A, a regulator of gluconeogenesis. Gene expression of pyruvate kinase, catalysing the final step of , was also reduced by 1-triple TTA. In addition, pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was reduced, accompanied by 10-15-fold increased gene expression of its regulator pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 compared to control, suggesting reduced entry of pyruvate into the TCA cycle. Indeed, the NADPH-generating enzyme malic enzyme 1 (ME1) catalysing production of pyruvate from malate, was increased 13-fold at the gene expression level. Despite the decreased glycogen level, genes involved in glycogen synthesis were not affected in livers of 1-triple TTA treated rats. In contrast, the pentose phosphate pathway seemed to be increased as the hepatic gene expression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) was higher in 1-triple TTA treated rats compared to controls. In human Huh7 liver cells, but not in myotubes, 1-triple-TTA reduced glucose oxidation and induced fatty  oxidation, in line with previous observations of increased hepatic mitochondrial palmitoyl-CoA oxidation in rats. Importantly, this work recognizes the liver as an important organ in glucose homeostasis. The mitochondrially targeted fatty  analogue 1-triple TTA seemed to lower hepatic glucose and glycogen levels by inhibition of gluconeogenesis. This was also linked to a reduction in glucose oxidation accompanied by reduced PHD activity and stimulation of ME1 and G6PD, favouring a shift from glucose- to fatty  oxidation. The reduced plasma insulin/glucose ratio indicate that 1-triple TTA may improve glucose tolerance in rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31372520>Targeting of lipid metabolism with a metabolic inhibitor cocktail eradicates peritoneal metastases in ovarian cancer cells.</a></h1><p>Ovarian cancer is an intra-abdominal tumor in which the presence of ascites facilitates metastatic dissemination, and associated with poor prognosis. However, the significance of metabolic alterations in ovarian cancer cells in the ascites microenvironment remains unclear. Here we show ovarian cancer cells exhibited increased aggressiveness in ascites microenvironment via reprogramming of lipid metabolism. High lipid metabolic activities are found in ovarian cancer cells when cultured in the ascites microenvironment, indicating a metabolic shift from aerobic  to β-oxidation and lipogenesis. The reduced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity due to the feedback effect of high energy production led to the activation of its downstream signaling, which in turn, enhanced the cancer growth.

By using different sources of nutrients for energy and biomass supply, AML cells gain metabolic plasticity and rapidly outcompete normal hematopoietic cells. This review aims to decipher the diverse metabolic strategies and the underlying oncogenic and environmental changes that sustain continuous growth, mediate redox homeostasis and induce drug resistance in AML. We revisit Warburg's hypothesis and illustrate the role of glucose as a provider of cellular building blocks rather than as a supplier of the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle for energy production. We discuss how the diversity of fuels for the TCA cycle, including glutamine and fatty , contributes to the metabolic plasticity of the disease and highlight the roles of amino  and lipids in AML metabolism.

To understand nonmutational mechanisms underlying the adaptation to MAPKi and to identify novel vulnerabilities of melanomas treated with MAPKi, we focused on the initial response phase during treatment with MAPKi.By screening proteins expressed on the cell surface of melanoma cells, we identified the fatty  transporter CD36 as the most consistently upregulated protein upon short-term treatment with MAPKi. We further investigated the effects of MAPKi on fatty  metabolism using  and  models and analyzing patients' pre- and on-treatment tumor specimens.Melanoma cells treated with MAPKi displayed increased levels of CD36 and of PPARα-mediated and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A)-dependent fatty  oxidation (FAO). While CD36 is a useful marker of melanoma cells during adaptation and drug-tolerant phases, the upregulation of CD36 is not functionally involved in FAO changes that characterize MAPKi-treated cells. Increased FAO is required for  -mutant melanoma cells to survive under the MAPKi-induced metabolic stress prior to acquiring drug resistance. The upfront and concomitant inhibition of FAO, , and MAPK synergistically inhibits tumor cell growth  and .Thus, we identified a clinically relevant therapeutic approach that has the potential to improve initial responses and to delay acquired drug resistance of  -mutant melanoma.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31420217>One-Carbon Metabolism Supports S-Adenosylmethionine and Histone Methylation to Drive Inflammatory Macrophages.</a></h1><p>Activated macrophages adapt their metabolic pathways to drive the pro-inflammatory phenotype, but little is known about the biochemical underpinnings of this process. Here, we find that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activates the pentose phosphate pathway, the serine synthesis pathway, and one-carbon metabolism, the synergism of which drives epigenetic reprogramming for interleukin-1β (IL-1β) expression. Glucose-derived ribose and one-carbon units fed by both glucose and serine metabolism are synergistically integrated into the methionine cycle through de novo ATP synthesis and fuel the generation of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) during LPS-induced inflammation. Impairment of these metabolic pathways that feed SAM generation lead to anti-inflammatory outcomes, implicating SAM as an essential metabolite for inflammatory macrophages. Mechanistically, SAM generation maintains a relatively high SAM:S-adenosylhomocysteine ratio to support histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation for IL-1β production. We therefore identify a synergistic effect of glucose and amino  metabolism on orchestrating SAM availability that is intimately linked to the chromatin state for inflammation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion  (TLG) measured by positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan enable a precise assessment of metabolic tumor burden. However, their clinical implications in identifying patients who need more aggressive treatment in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are not fully understood.In the current prospective trial, we analyzed 101 newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC (stage III-IV) patients with measurable baseline MTV, TLG, and cfDNA quantification. The best cut-offs for cfDNA levels, MTV, and TLG to predict progression-free survival and overall survival were determined using X-tile analysis.There were significant positive correlations between cfDNA and MTV (r = 0.488, p <  0.001) and between cfDNA and TLG (r = 0.554, p <  0.001). High-cfDNA levels and high-MTV/TLG negatively correlated with overall survival (OS) (all p <  0.001). Patients with high-MTV showed similar median OS irrespective of their cfDNA levels (low-cfDNA vs. high-cfDNA=9.2 vs 6.6 months; p >  0.05). However, patients with low-MTV and low-cfDNA levels showed longer OS than those with low-MTV and high-cfDNA levels (low-cfDNA vs. high-cfDNA=49.3 vs 11.5 months; p <  0.001). The patient group with low-TLG also showed similar trends. The cfDNA level was an independent prognostic factor for OS by Cox-proportional hazard analysis.Although the patients with high metabolic tumor burden had a poor prognosis, regardless of the biological behavior/aggressiveness of the tumor, patients with low metabolic tumor burden and high cfDNA levels showed a poor prognosis. Taken together, this study indicates a stronger prognostic value of baseline cfDNA levels in identifying patients with advanced NSCLC and personalizing their treatment strategies for better survival.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Although benzoic  derivatives showed positive effects on lipid accumulation in , the biochemical mechanism needs further investigation.Four benzoic  derivatives (sodium benzoate, -aminobenzoic , -methyl benzoic  and folic ) were screened and evaluated for their effect on lipid accumulation in  SR21. The lipid yield was increased by 56.84% with -aminobenzoic  (-ABA) at a concentration of 200 mg/L among the four tested chemical modulators. The metabolomics analysis showed that 200 mg/L -ABA was optimal for promoting glucose catabolism in  with an increase in the mevalonate pathway and a weakening of the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle.

Here, we report that melanoma patients with high expression of -related genes show a worse progression free survival upon anti-PD1 treatment. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac lowers lactate secretion of tumor cells and improves anti-PD1-induced T cell killing in vitro. Surprisingly, diclofenac, but not other NSAIDs, turns out to be a potent inhibitor of the lactate transporters monocarboxylate transporter 1 and 4 and diminishes lactate efflux. Notably, T cell activation, viability, and effector functions are preserved under diclofenac treatment and in a low glucose environment in vitro. Diclofenac, but not aspirin, delays tumor growth and improves the efficacy of checkpoint therapy in vivo. Moreover, genetic suppression of  in tumor cells strongly improves checkpoint therapy. These findings support the rationale for targeting  in patients with high glycolytic tumors together with checkpoint inhibitors in clinical trials.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Previously, we demonstrated that BKA exhibited cytotoxic effects on 4T1 tumor cells, depending on the cell number in the culture, but not on NIH3T3 cells. However, the cause of this differential sensitivity was unelucidated. Here we demonstrate that BKA reduced the O consumption in both cell lines and increased the mitochondrial membrane potential, thereby facilitating glucose consumption. BKA reduced cellular ATP in 4T1 cells in a dose-dependent manner but not in NIH3T3 cells. The cellular ATP of 4T1 cells was decreased with a reduced glucose concentration in the media, but that of NIH3T3 cells remained constant. We also demonstrated that BKA-induced cell death in both cell lines in low glucose media; however, the susceptibility to the reduced glucose concentration was slightly higher in 4T1 cells, which may be attributed to the difference in the dependency on  as their energy source. These results indicate that 4T1 tumor cells rely heavily on glucose for energy production. Our data demonstrate that BKA disturbs ATP production in mitochondria and increases the susceptibility to a low glucose condition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638999>Inhibition of the key metabolic pathways,  and lipogenesis, of oral cancer by bitter melon extract.</a></h1><p>Metabolic reprogramming is one of the hallmarks of cancer which favours rapid energy production, biosynthetic capabilities and therapy resistance. In our previous study, we showed bitter melon extract (BME) prevents carcinogen induced mouse oral cancer. RNA sequence analysis from mouse tongue revealed a significant modulation in "Metabolic Process" by altering  and lipid metabolic pathways in BME fed group as compared to cancer group. In present study, we evaluated the effect of BME on  and lipid metabolism pathways in human oral cancer cells.Cal27 and JHU022 cells were treated with BME. RNA and protein expression were analysed for modulation of glycolytic and lipogenesis genes by quantitative real-time PCR, western blot analyses and immunofluorescence. Lactate and pyruvate level was determined by GC/MS. Extracellular acidification and glycolytic rate were measured using the Seahorse XF analyser. Shotgun lipidomics in Cal27 and JHU022 cell lines following BME treatment was performed by ESI/ MS. ROS was measured by FACS.Treatment with BME on oral cancer cell lines significantly reduced mRNA and protein expression levels of key glycolytic genes SLC2A1 (GLUT-1), PFKP, LDHA, PKM and PDK3. Pyruvate and lactate levels and  rate were reduced in oral cancer cells following BME treatment. In lipogenesis pathway, we observed a significant reduction of genes involves in fatty  biogenesis, ACLY, ACC1 and FASN, at the mRNA and protein levels following BME treatment. Further, BME treatment significantly reduced phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and plasmenylethanolamine, and reduced iPLA2 activity. Additionally, BME treatment inhibited lipid raft marker flotillin expression and altered its subcellular localization. ER-stress associated CHOP expression and generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species were induced by BME, which facilitated apoptosis.Our study revealed that bitter melon extract inhibits  and lipid metabolism and induces ER and oxidative stress-mediated cell death in oral cancer. Thus, BME-mediated metabolic reprogramming of oral cancer cells will have important preventive and therapeutic implications along with conventional therapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31332064>Metabolomics of  Treated with the Antimicrobial Carbon Monoxide-Releasing Molecule CORM-3 Reveals Tricarboxylic  Cycle as Major Target.</a></h1><p>In the last decade, carbon monoxide-releasing molecules (CORMs) have been shown to act against several pathogens and to be promising antimicrobials.

In this work, we used a metabolomics approach to probe the toxicity of the ruthenium(II) complex Ru(CO)Cl(glycinate) (CORM-3) on  By resorting to H nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectrometry, and enzymatic activities, we show that CORM-3-treated  accumulates larger amounts of glycolytic intermediates, independently of the oxygen growth conditions. The work provides several evidences that CORM-3 inhibits glutamate synthesis and the iron-sulfur enzymes of the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle and that the  pathway is triggered in order to establish an energy and redox homeostasis balance. Accordingly, supplementation of the growth medium with fumarate, α-ketoglutarate, glutamate, and amino  cancels the toxicity of CORM-3. Importantly, inhibition of the iron-sulfur enzymes glutamate synthase, aconitase, and fumarase is only observed for compounds that liberate carbon monoxide. Altogether, this work reveals that the antimicrobial action of CORM-3 results from intracellular glutamate deficiency and inhibition of nitrogen and TCA cycles.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31399190>Rapamycin Modulate Treg/Th17 Balance via Regulating Metabolic Pathways: A Study in Mice.</a></h1><p>A regulatory T (Treg) cell/T helper 17 (Th17) cell imbalance is involved in many autoimmune diseases. Rapamycin (Rapa), a clinically used immunosuppressive drug, has been shown to inhibit Th17 cell differentiation but promote Treg cell generation. In this study, we aimed to study the mechanism of Rapa acting on Treg and Th17 cell differentiation. Purified mouse CD4CD25 T cells were stimulated and polarized in vitro to generate Th17 or Treg cells in the presence or absence of Rapa. We first confirmed that Rapa inhibited the differentiation of Th17 cells and greatly promoted Treg cell generation in vitro. As metabolic pathways play a key role in T cell differentiation, we then detected the metabolic programs in Rapa-treated T cells. We found that Rapa blocked  in induced Th17 cells, evidenced by reduced glucose uptake, and inhibited expression of glucose transporter 1 and the rate-limiting enzyme HK2. In addition, the expression of c-Myc and of HIF-1α transcription factor, which regulate many genes involved in , were inhibited by Rapa. Conversely, Rapa promoted fatty  oxidation (FAO) metabolism in differentiated Treg cells, with the elevation of FAO product β-hydroxybutyrate, and increased expression of ATGL and CPT1A, the key enzymes of FAO in differentiated Treg cells. The expression of phospho-AMPKα, the key signal in the regulation of FAO, was also promoted in Rapa-treated induced Treg cells. Together, these findings indicated that Rapa abrogated  in Th17 cells but facilitated FAO in induced Treg cells, which may underlie the mechanism by which Rapa regulates the Treg/Th17 balance.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Glucose, Prostaglandins and Lipids.</a></h1><p>Survival and growth of the bovine conceptus (embryo and associated extraembryonic membranes) is dependent on endometrial secretions or histotroph found in the uterine lumen. Previously, serial embryo transfer was used to classify heifers as high fertile (HF), subfertile (SF), or infertile (IF). Here, we investigated specific histotroph components (glucose, prostaglandins (PGs) and lipids) in the uterine lumen of day 17 pregnant and open fertility-classified heifers. Concentrations of glucose in the uterine lumen were increased by pregnancy, but did not differ among fertility-classified heifers. Differences in expression of genes encoding glucose transporters and involved with  and gluconeogenesis were observed between conceptuses collected from HF and SF heifers. In the uterine lumen, PGE2 and PGF2α were increased by pregnancy, and HF heifers had higher concentrations of PGE2, PGF2α and 6-keto-PFG1α than SF heifers. Differences were found in expression of genes regulating PG signaling, arachidonic  metabolism, and PPAR signaling among conceptuses and endometrium from fertility-classified heifers. Lipidomics was conducted exclusively in samples from HF heifers, and phosphatidylcholine was the main lipid class that increased in the uterine lumen by pregnancy. Expression of several lipid metabolism genes differed between HF and SF conceptuses, and a number of fatty  were differentially abundant in the uterine lumen of pregnant HF and SF heifers. These results support the ideas that uterine luminal histotroph impacts conceptus survival and programs its development and is a facet of dysregulated conceptus-endometrial interactions that result in loss of the conceptus in SF cattle during the implantation period of pregnancy establishment.© The Author(s) 2019.

Accumulating evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) could regulate such metabolic reprogramming. Our microarray analysis and quantitative real-time PCR validation revealed that miR-885-5p was strongly downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and cell lines. To investigate miR-885-5p's biological functions in HCC progression, malignant phenotypes were analyzed in different types of hypoxic model and indicated that overexpression of miR-885-5p significantly inhibited HCC cell proliferation and migration and induced apoptosis in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Subsequent investigations of whether miR-885-5p regulated the glycometabolic activity of cancer cells demonstrated that forced expression of miR-885-5p in SMMC-7721 cells significantly reduced glucose uptake and lactate production by repressing several key enzymes related to . Particularly, miR-885-5p directly targets the 3' UTR of hexokinase 2 (HK2), which is a key enzyme that catalyzes the irreversible first step of  and associates with poor patient outcomes.

IL-17-producing CD4 T (Th17) cells play pivotal roles in RA development and progression. Retinoic  receptor-related orphan receptor alpha (RORα) is a negative regulator of inflammatory responses, whereas RORγt, another member of the ROR family, is a Th17 lineage-specific transcription factor. Here, we investigated the immunoregulatory potential of RORα in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice, an experimental model of RA. Cholesterol sulfate (CS) or SR1078, a ligand of RORα, inhibited RORγt expression and Th17 differentiation . In addition, fortification of RORα in T cells inhibited the expression levels of -associated genes. We found that RORα overexpression in CIA mice attenuated the clinical and histological severities of inflammatory arthritis. The anti-arthritic effect of RORα was associated with suppressed Th17 differentiation and attenuated mTOR-STAT3 signaling in T cells. Furthermore, altered RORα activity could directly affect osteoclastogenesis implicated in progressive bone destruction in human RA. Our findings defined a critical role of RORα in the pathogenesis of RA. These data suggest that RORα may have novel therapeutic uses in the treatment of RA.Copyright © 2019 Park, Moon, Lim, Byun, Hwang, Yang, Kim, Lee, Kim, Lee, Kwok, Min, Lee, Shin, Park and Cho.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632331>Energy Metabolism and Redox State in Brains of Wistar Audiogenic Rats, a Genetic Model of Epilepsy.</a></h1><p>The Wistar Audiogenic Rat (WAR) strain is a genetic model of epilepsy, specifically brainstem-dependent tonic-clonic seizures, triggered by acute auditory stimulation. Chronic audiogenic seizures (audiogenic kindling) mimic temporal lobe epilepsy, with significant participation of the hippocampus, amygdala, and cortex. The objective of the present study was to characterize the mitochondrial energy metabolism in hippocampus and cortex of WAR and verify its relationship with seizure severity. Hippocampus of WAR naïve (no seizures) presented higher oxygen consumption in respiratory states related to the maximum capacities of phosphorylation and electron transfer system, elevated mitochondrial density, lower GSH/GSSG and catalase activity, and higher protein carbonyl and lactate contents, compared with their Wistar counterparts. Audiogenic kindling had no adding functional effect in WAR, but in Wistar, it induced the same alterations observed in the audiogenic strain. In the cortex, WAR naïve presented elevated mitochondrial density, lower GSH/GSSG and catalase activity, and higher protein carbonyl levels. Chronic acoustic stimulation in Wistar induced the same alterations in cortex and hippocampus. Mainly in the hippocampus, WAR naïve presented elevated mRNA expression of glucose, lactate and excitatory amino  transporters, several glycolytic enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase, and Na/K ATPase in neurons and in astrocytes.  treatment with mitochondrial uncoupler 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) or N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in WAR had no effect on mitochondrial metabolism, but lowered oxidative stress. Unlike DNP, NAC downregulated all enzyme genes involved in glucose and lactate uptake, and metabolism in neurons and astrocytes. Additionally, it was able to reduce brainstem seizure severity in WAR. In conclusion, in WAR naïve animals, both cerebral cortex and hippocampus display elevated mitochondrial density and/or activity associated with oxidative damage, glucose and lactate metabolism pathways upregulation, and increased Na/K ATPase mRNA expression. Only  treatment with NAC was able to reduce seizure severity of kindled WARs, possibly via down regulation of glucose/lactate metabolism. Taken together, our results are a clear contribution to the field of mitochondrial metabolism associated to epileptic seizures.Copyright © 2019 Dechandt, Ferrari, dos Santos, de Oliveira, Silva-Jr, Cunha, Garcia-Cairasco and Alberici.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31385801>Impact of G6PD status on red cell storage and transfusion outcomes.</a></h1><p>There are inter-individual differences in the quality of refrigerator-stored red blood cells (RBCs). Possible sources of these variations include nutritional and genetic factors. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, the most common enzyme deficiency worldwide that affects the ability of RBCs to respond to oxidative stress, has been implicated as a genetic factor that affects the quality of stored RBCs. This review considers the literature concerning G6PD-deficient RBCs. It discusses RBC unit variables such as in vitro storage, 24-hour post-transfusion recovery (PTR), post-transfusion survival, and post-transfusion clinical outcomes.There are several differences in the in vitro storage characteristics between G6PD-deficient and G6PD-normal RBCs. Recent studies identified differences in the pathways related to , purine metabolism, glutathione homeostasis, and fatty  metabolism. In vitro experiments modelling the transfusion of G6PD-deficient RBCs, as well as autologous PTR studies in vivo, demonstrate increased haemolysis and decreased PTR, respectively, both indicators of a decrease in quality as compared to G6PD-normal RBCs. Finally, studies transfusing G6PD-deficient and G6PD-normal RBCs show that, in certain clinical settings, G6PD-deficient RBCs are associated with increased haemolysis.In summary, G6PD deficiency is associated with a decrease in the quality of RBCs after storage and its impact is often under-estimated. Understanding the underlying mechanisms by which G6PD deficiency affects RBC storage and transfusion outcomes may provide important clues to help optimise the future efficacy and safety of transfusions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31362724>Systemic Immuno-metabolic alterations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</a></h1><p>Metabolic adaptation in immune cells is necessary to modulate immune cell function as it is intricately coupled with intracellular metabolism. We aimed to characterize the metabolic state of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after long-term exposure to tobacco smoke in smokers with preserved lung function and COPD subjects.PBMCs were isolated from healthy non-smokers (HNS), healthy smokers (HS) and COPD subjects, cultured and the mitochondrial respiration while utilizing glucose (), fatty  (β-oxidation) or pyruvate (direct Krebs' cycle substrate) was measured using the XFp Extracellular Flux Analyzer. Plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ, IL-17, TNF-α, IL-5, IL-9 and IFN-α were measured using flow cytometry. RAW264.7 cells were exposed to cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) for 1 h and its effect on cell viability, cellular metabolism and phagocytosis ability were also studied. Patient's data was analyzed using the Mann Whitney U test, whereas Student's t test was performed to analyze the in-vitro data.PBMCs from COPD subjects showed a significant decrease in extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) while utilizing glucose as compared to HNS (151.9 Vs 215%). Mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) on palmitate or pyruvate was also found to be significantly lower in COPD subjects as compared to HS and a strong positive correlation between palmitate OCR in PBMCs and FEV (r = 0.74, p < 0.05) and FVC (r = 0.79, p < 0.05) values in HS was observed. The metabolic shift towards fatty  metabolism in healthy smokers promoted an inflammatory cytokine response with a greater increase in the levels of IL-5, IL-9 and IFN-α as compared to IFN-γ, IL-17 and TNF-α. In-vitro experiments with RAW 264.7 cells showed similar metabolic alterations and a reduced ability to phagocytose Streptococcus pneumonia and Haemophilus influenza after cigarette smoke exposure in the presence of glucose or palmitate.These findings indicate a metabolic basis for the inflammatory response in COPD and could suggest a new therapeutic target for controlling the immune response and delaying the onset of disease.This observational study was retrospectively registered in the Clinical Trails Registry - India (ICMR - NIMS) on 19th January 2018 with the registration number CTRI/2018/01/011441 .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31437797>Comparative physiological and metabolomic analyses of the hyper-accumulation of astaxanthin and lipids in Haematococcus pluvialis upon treatment with butylated hydroxyanisole.</a></h1><p>The major goal of this study was to explore the functions of butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) combined with abiotic stress on the cultivation of the microalga Haematococcus pluvialis for astaxanthin and lipid production.

Mn causes mitochondrial toxicity; however, little is known about transcriptional responses discriminated by physiological and toxicological levels of Mn. Identification of such mechanisms could provide means to evaluate risk of Mn toxicity and also potential avenues to protect against adverse effects. To study the Mn dose-response effects on transcription, analyzed by RNA-Seq, we used human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells exposed for 5 h to Mn (0 to 100 μM), a time point where no immediate cell death occurred at any of the doses. Results showed widespread effects on abundance of protein-coding genes for metabolism of reactive oxygen species, energy sensing, , and protein homeostasis including the unfolded protein response and transcriptional regulation. Exposure to a concentration (10 μM Mn for 5 h) that did not result in cell death after 24-h increased abundance of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the protein secretion pathway that function in protein trafficking and cellular homeostasis. These include  (Golgi vesicular membrane-trafficking protein),  (ADAM metallopeptidase domain 10), and  (ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase-activating protein 3). In contrast, 5-h exposure to 100 μM Mn, a concentration that caused cell death after 24 h, increased abundance of DEGs for components of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation pathway. Integrated pathway analysis results showed that protein secretion gene set was associated with amino  metabolites in response to 10 μM Mn, while oxidative phosphorylation gene set was associated with energy, lipid, and neurotransmitter metabolites at 100 μM Mn. These results show that differential effects of Mn occur at a concentration which does not cause subsequent cell death compared to a concentration that causes subsequent cell death. If these responses translate to effects on the secretory pathway and mitochondrial functions , differential activities of these systems could provide a sensitive basis to discriminate sub-toxic and toxic environmental and occupational Mn exposures.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31401351>Strains of Staphylococcus aureus that Colonize and Infect Skin Harbor Mutations in Metabolic Genes.</a></h1><p>Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of skin and soft tissue infections, yet the bacterial genetic changes associated with adaptation to human skin are not well characterized.

The results showed that a total of 3080/1908, 3110/2115 and 2684/1483 genes were up-/down-regulated after 6 h, 12 h and 24 h of treatment, respectively, compared with control check group (CK, 0 h). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that most of these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched in energy metabolism, carbohydrate synthesis, cell wall precursor synthesis and hormone regulation pathways. For energy metabolism, the expression of most genes involved in photosynthesis (including the light reaction and Calvin cycle) was generally inhibited, while the expression of genes related , the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle and PPP pathway was up-regulated. In addition, the increase in the CO concentration induced the up-regulation of gene expression in the sucrose synthesis pathway. Among all starch synthesis genes,  (granule-bound starch synthase) had the highest expression level.

However, their efficacy against solid tumors is still poor and further studies are required to improve it. One of the major restrictions for NK cell activity is the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). There, tumor and other immune cells create the appropriate conditions for tumor proliferation while, among others, preventing NK cell activation. Furthermore, NK cell metabolism is impaired in the TME, presumably due to nutrient and oxygen deprivation, and the higher concentration of tumor-derived metabolic end products, such as lactate. This metabolic restriction of NK cells limits their effector functions, and it could represent a potential target to focus on to improve the efficacy of NK cell-based therapies against solid tumors.

As a conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammation drugs, tolfenamic  (TA) has been previously reported to exhibit anti-cancer activity. Herein, we investigated the effect of TA on TGFβ-mediated pro-metastatic activity and the underlying mechanisms in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). As a result, TA suppresses TGFβ-induced migration and  in HCC cells, which is accompanied with reduced Smad phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear transcription activity. Mechanistically, TA promotes lipid raft-caveolar internalization pathway of TGFβ receptor, therefore leading to its rapid turnover. Consistently, TA inhibits constitutively active TGFβ type I receptor induced Smad phosphorylation and EMT markers, whereas ectopic expression of TGFβ type II receptor could partially rescue TGFβ-mediated Smad2 phosphorylation and downstream genes expression in the presence of TA. Furthermore, TA inhibited HCC cells invasion in nude mice, associated with the alteration of characteristics related with EMT and  of cancer cells.

This fungus possesses the cyanide (CN)-insensitive respiration pathway consisting of alternative oxidase (EC 1.10.3.11; AOX), in addition to the cytochrome pathway. Since this CN-insensitive respiration pathway reoxidizes NADH without ATP production, it contributes to continuous  in A. niger. In this study, to show the availability of aoxA gene encoding AOX as a tool for metabolic engineering, we generated efficient oxalic  (OA)-producers by genetic engineering of A. niger using aoxA gene. The OA-producing strain EOAH-1, generated by overexpression of the oxaloacetate hydrolase (EC 3.7.1.1; OAH) gene oahA in A. niger WU-2223L, produced 28 g/L OA from 30 g/L glucose during the 9-day cultivation period. Moreover, the strain EAOXOAH-1, generated by overexpression of both aoxA and oahA genes in strain WU-2223L, produced 28 g/L OA during the 7-day cultivation period. Strain EAOXOAH-1 showed higher glucose consumption rate than EOAH-1 did, indicating that overexpression of aoxA contributed to the acceleration of glucose consumption, and that the OA production period was shortened by 2 days. Thus, we clearly show that AOX gene must be an effective tool in metabolic engineering for efficient organic  production from carbohydrates.Copyright © 2019 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

However, lack of complete genome, transcriptome and proteome information limits the understanding of the biology of H. flava. Here, the total RNA of H. flava was collected separately at larvae and nymph stages and analyzed with high-throughput RNA sequencing technology. The obtained data were assembled and annotated based on the near origin species in the Nr database. The functions of the unigenes were annotated and classified by seven databases, including Nr, Nt, Pfam, KOG, Swiss-Prot, GO and KEGG. A total of 61,850,967 and 79,579,368 clean reads were obtained with a data bulk of 9.28 G and 11.94 G in larvae and nymph stages, respectively. The number of unigenes was 440,896, with 48.6% of them being matched to the Nr database and 51.4% remaining unknown. Additionally, 1,776,404 SNPs were identified in the unigenes. Differential analysis revealed 80 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 56 up-regulated genes and 24 down-regulated genes in the nymph versus larvae. qPCR confirmed 4 of the 56 up-regulated genes and 4 of the down-regulated genes. KEGG analysis of the DEGs showed that aldehyde dehydrogenase and sorbitol dehydrogenase, two up-regulated unigenes in nymph versus larvae, were both matched to the top three enriched pathways: "chloroalkane and chloroalkene degradation", "fatty  degradation" and " and gluconeogenesis". This is the first report on the whole transcriptome of H. flava at larvae and nymph stages. This study contributes to the understanding of H. flava at the gene expression level in different developmental stages and provides a theoretical basis for the development of vaccines against H. flava.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Candida glabrata, as a dominant strain for producing pyruvic , principally converts glucose to pyruvic  through . However, this process relies excessively on high extracellular DO content. In this study, in combination with specific motif analysis of gene promoters, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) was engineered to improve the transcription level of some enzymes related to pyruvic  synthesis under low DO level and directly led to increased pyruvic  production and  efficiency. Moreover, the intracellular stability of HIF1 was further optimized from different aspects to maximize pyruvic  accumulation. Finally, the pyruvic  titer in a 5-L batch bioreactor with 10% DO level reached 53.1 g/L. As pyruvic  is involved in the biosynthesis of various products, these findings suggest that HIF1-enabled regulation method has significant potential for increasing the synthesis of other chemicals in microorganisms.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study is aimed to investigate the regulatory effect of two flavonoids( glabridin and quercetin) on energy supply and  of breast cancer cells,and provide reference for developing some anticancer herbal drugs with the function of regulating tumor energy metabolism. Based on the characteristics of each pathway during energy metabolism,in the present study,the triple negative breast cancer tumor cells( MDA-MB-231) were selected to investigate the effects of glabridin and quercetin on the energy metabolism of breast cancer cells and discuss the possible mechanisms from the following five potential targets: glucose uptake,protein expression of glucose transporter 1( GLUT1),adenosine triphosphate( ATP) level,lactate dehydrogenase( LDH) activity,and lactic ( LD) concentration. The results showed that both quercetin and glabridin could decrease the glucose uptake capacity of breast cancer cells by down-regulating the protein expression of GLUT1. Quercetin had no significant effect on LDH activity and LD concentration; it did not affect the  process,but increased the intracellular ATP level. Glabridin decreased the activity of LDH and reduced LD concentration,thereby inhibiting the  metabolism of breast cancer cells. Therefore,both quercetin and glabridin can regulate the energy metabolism of breast cancer cells and can be used as potential anticancer agents or anti-cancer adjuvants.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600945>Metabolomic Profiling of the Immune Stimulatory Effect of Eicosenoids on PMA-Differentiated THP-1 Cells.</a></h1><p>Honey bee venom has been established to have significant effect in immunotherapy. In the present study, (Z)-11-eicosenol-a major constituent of bee venom, along with its derivations methyl cis-11-eicosenoate and cis-11-eicosenoic , were synthesised to investigate their immune stimulatory effect and possible use as vaccine adjuvants. Stimuli that prime and activate the immune system have exerted profound effects on immune cells, particularly macrophages; however, the effectiveness of bee venom constituents as immune stimulants has not yet been established. Here, the abilities of these compounds to act as pro-inflammatory stimuli were assessed, either alone or in combination with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), by examining the secretion of tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and the cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6 and IL-10 by THP-1 macrophages. The compounds clearly increased the levels of IL-1β and decreased IL-10, whereas a decrease in IL-6 levels suggested a complex mechanism of action. A more in-depth profile of macrophage behaviour was therefore obtained by comprehensive untargeted metabolic profiling of the cells using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to confirm the ability of the eicosanoids to trigger the immune system. The level of 358 polar and 315 non-polar metabolites were changed significantly ( < 0.05) by all treatments. The LPS-stimulated production of most of the inflammatory metabolite biomarkers in , the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle, the pentose phosphate pathway, purine, pyrimidine and fatty  metabolism were significantly enhanced by all three compounds, and particularly by methyl cis-11-eicosenoate and cis-11-eicosenoic .

As a potent inhibitor of , 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2DG) has been proposed for cancer treatment and extensively investigated in clinical studies. Moreover, 2DG has been reported to interfere with other biological processes including glycosylation. To further understand the overall effect of and metabolic alteration by 2DG, we performed biochemical and metabolomics analyses on oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines. In this study, we found that 2DG more effectively reduced glucose consumption and lactate level in SCC15 cells than in SCC4 cells, which are less dependent on . Coincidentally, 2DG impaired N-linked glycosylation of the key oncogenic receptors Axl and Met in SCC15 cells, thereby reducing the cell viability and colony formation ability. The impaired processes of  and N-linked glycosylation were restored by exogenous addition of pyruvate and mannose, respectively. Additionally, our targeted metabolomics analysis revealed significant alterations in the metabolites, including amino , biogenic amines, glycerophospholipids, and sphingolipids, caused by the impairment of  and N-linked glycosylation. These observations suggest that alterations of these metabolites may be responsible for the phenotypic and metabolic changes in SCC15 cells induced by 2DG. Moreover, our data suggest that N-linked glycosylation of Axl and Met may contribute to the maintenance of cancer properties in SCC15 cells.

However, the background of the antifungal effect remains unknown, especially in the case of non- species such as  We examined the effect of tyrosol on growth, adhesion, redox homeostasis, virulence, as well as fluconazole susceptibility. To gain further insights into the physiological consequences of tyrosol treatment, we also determined genome-wide gene expression changes using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq). A concentration of 15 mM tyrosol caused significant growth inhibition within 2 h of the addition of tyrosol, while the adhesion of yeast cells was not affected. Tyrosol increased the production of reactive oxygen species remarkably, as revealed by a dichlorofluorescein test, and it was associated with elevated superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase activities. The interaction between fluconazole and tyrosol was antagonistic. Tyrosol exposure resulted in 261 and 181 differentially expressed genes with at least a 1.5-fold increase or decrease in expression, respectively, which were selected for further study. Genes involved in ribosome biogenesis showed downregulation, while genes related to the oxidative stress response and ethanol fermentation were upregulated. In addition, tyrosol treatment upregulated the expression of efflux pump genes, including  and , and downregulated the expression of the  and  virulence genes involved in desaturated fatty  formation.

To study the role of PGK in the resistance to WSSV infection in shrimp, the full-length cDNA of the PGK gene (LvPGK) from Litopenaeus vannamei was obtained by using homology cloning and RACE amplification. The tissue distribution of LvPGK and its expression changes in the main immune tissues after WSSV stimulation were obtained by quantitative real-time PCR. Furthermore, RNA interference (RNAi) was used to study the role of LvPGK in shrimp defending against WSSV infection. The results showed that the full-length cDNA sequence of LvPGK was 1855 bp, contained a 1248 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding 415 amino , and included a conserved PGK domain. LvPGK presented ubiquitous expression in most examined tissues, with the most predominant expression in the muscle and the weakest expression in the intestine. LvPGK transcripts could be induced in the hemocytes and hepatopancreas by injection with WSSV. Both the replication of WSSV and the shrimp cumulative mortality decreased significantly after LvPGK knockdown (P < 0.01). After challenging LvPGK RNAi shrimp with WSSV, the concentration of glucose in the hepatopancreas and muscle tissue did not show significant change; however, the content of pyruvate and lactate decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Moreover, significant decreases in the expression levels of crustin, ALF1, ALF2 and ALF3 were also detected.

MΦs display a spectrum of functional phenotypes as a result of microenvironmental and stress-induced stimuli. Evidence has emerged demonstrating that metabolism is not only crucial for the generation of energy and biomolecular precursors, but also contributes to the function and plasticity of MΦs. Here, 1D H NMR-based metabolomics was employed to identify metabolic pathways that are differentially modulated following primary human monocyte-derived MΦ activation with pro-inflammatory (M1) or anti-inflammatory (M2a) stimuli relative to resting (M0) MΦs. The metabolic profiling of M1 MΦs indicated a substantial increase in oxidative stress as well as a decrease in mitochondrial respiration. These metabolic profiles also provide compelling evidence that M1 MΦs divert metabolites from  glycerophospholipid synthesis to inhibit oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore,  and lactic  fermentation were significantly increased in both M1 and M2a MΦs. These metabolic patterns highlight robust metabolic activation markers of MΦ phenotypes. Overall, our study generates additional support to previous observations, presents novel findings regarding the metabolic modulation of human MΦs following activation, and contributes new knowledge to the rapidly evolving field of immunometabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31518962>Effective electrochemotherapy with curcumin in MDA-MB-231-human, triple negative breast cancer cells: A global proteomics study.</a></h1><p>Curcumin (Cur), the yellow pigment of well-known turmeric (Curcuma longa L.) is effective in multiple cancers including triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). In combination with electrical pulses (EP), enhanced effects of curcumin (Cur + EP) are observed in TNBC cells. To gain insights into the mechanisms of enhanced anticancer effects of Cur + EP, we studied the proteins involved in the anticancer activity of Cur + EP in MDA-MB-231, human TNBC cells using high-throughput global proteomics. A curcumin dose of 50 μM was applied with eight, 1200 V/cm, 100 μs pulses, the most commonly used electrochemotherapy (ECT) parameter in clinics. Results show that the Cur + EP treatment reduced the clonogenic ability in MDA-MB-231 cells, with the induction of apoptosis. Proteomic analysis identified a total of 1456 proteins, of which 453 proteins were differentially regulated, including kinases, heat shock proteins, transcription factors, structural proteins, and metabolic enzymes. Eight key  proteins (ALDOA, ENO2, LDHA, LDHB, PFKP, PGM1, PGAM1 and PGK1) were downregulated in Cur + EP from Cur.

The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), an alternative metabolic pathway that operates parallel to , not only provides key intermediates for biosynthetic reactions but also controls the fate of neural stem/progenitor cells. We have previously shown that glutamate application leads to the induction of neural progenitor cells in mature ex vivo rat retina. In this study, we investigated whether regulation of the PPP might be changed following glutamate treatment of the retina. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the amount of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the rate-limiting enzyme of the PPP as well as that of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD), another enzyme in this pathway, increased in the glutamate-treated retina. Consistent with the fact that both these enzymes generate reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), the amount of NAPDH in the treated retina was significantly higher compared with that in the untreated retina. We also found that both DNA synthesis as well as the expression of fatty  synthase (FASN) increased significantly in the glutamate-treated retina. Furthermore, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF-1α), a positive transcriptional regulator of PPP enzymes, was up-regulated at both messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels.

Thus pyruvate kinase plays a key role in controlling the metabolic flux and ATP production. The hallmark of the activity of different pyruvate kinases is their tight modulation by a variety of mechanisms including the use of a large number of physiological allosteric effectors in addition to their homotropic regulation by phosphoenolpyruvate. Binding of effectors signals precise and orchestrated movements in selected areas of the protein structure that alter the catalytic action of these evolutionarily conserved enzymes with remarkably conserved architecture and sequences. While the diverse nature of the allosteric effectors has been discussed in the literature, the structural basis of their regulatory effects is still not well understood because of the lack of data representing conformations in various activation states. Results of recent studies on pyruvate kinases of different families suggest that members of evolutionarily related families follow somewhat conserved allosteric strategies but evolutionarily distant members adopt different strategies.

T cells are a powerful model for the investigation of such modulatory effects, as common precursor cells may differentiate either to helper CD4 T cells or cytotoxic CD8 cells, which elicit distinct functionalities upon TCR-stimulation. Human primary CD4 and CD8 T cells were purified from three individual donors and activated with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies. Associated proteome alterations were analyzed by high-resolution mass spectrometry using a label-free shotgun approach. Metabolic activation was indicated by upregulation of enzymes related to , NADH production, fatty  synthesis, and uptake as well as amino  and iron uptake. Besides various inflammatory effector molecules, the mitochondrial proteins CLUH, TFAM, and TOMM34 were found specifically induced in CD4 T cells.

However, investigation of human monocyte intracellular metabolism in the context of the hypoxic and inflammatory rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovium is lacking. We hypothesized that exposure of monocytes to the hypoxic and inflammatory RA environment would have a profound impact on their metabolic state, and potential to contribute to disease pathology.Human monocytes were isolated from buffy coats and exposed to hypoxia. Metabolic profiling of monocytes was carried out by LC-MS metabolomics. Inflammatory mediator release after LPS or RA-synovial fluid (RA-SF) stimulation was analysed by ELISA. FAO was inhibited by etomoxir or enhanced with exogenous carnitine supplementation. Transcriptomics of RA blood monocytes and RA-SF macrophages was carried out by microarray.Hypoxia exacerbated monocyte-derived CCL20 and IL-1β release in response to LPS, and increased glycolytic intermediates at the expense of carnitines. Modulation of carnitine identified a novel role for FAO in the production of CCL20 in response to LPS. Transcriptional analysis of RA blood monocytes and RA-SF macrophages revealed that fatty  metabolism was altered and CCL20 increased when monocytes enter the synovial environment. In vitro analysis of monocytes showed that RA-SF increases carnitine abundance and CCL20 production in hypoxia, which was exacerbated by exogenous carnitine.This work has revealed a novel inflammatory mechanism in RA that links FAO to CCL20 production in human monocytes, which could subsequently contribute to RA disease pathogenesis by promoting the recruitment of Th17 cells and osteoclastogenesis.© The Author(s) 2019.

In addition to blocking EGFR-stimulated cell signaling, cetuximab can induce endocytosis of ASCT2, a glutamine transporter associated with EGFR in a complex, leading to glutathione biosynthesis inhibition and cellular sensitization to ROS. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK1), a key mitochondrial enzyme overexpressed in cancer cells, redirects glucose metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation toward aerobic . In this study, we tested the hypothesis that targeting PDK1 is a rational approach to synergize with cetuximab through ROS overproduction. We found that combination of PDK1 knockdown or inhibition by dichloroacetic  (DCA) with ASCT2 knockdown or with cetuximab treatment induced ROS overproduction and apoptosis in HNSCC cells, and this effect was independent of effective inhibition of EGFR downstream pathways but could be lessened by N-acetyl cysteine, an anti-oxidative agent. In several cetuximab-resistant HNSCC xenograft models, DCA plus cetuximab induced marked tumor regression, whereas either agent alone failed to induce tumor regression. Our findings call for potentially novel clinical trials of combining cetuximab and DCA in patients with cetuximab-sensitive EGFR-overexpressing tumors and patients with cetuximab-resistant EGFR-overexpressing tumors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31362676>Untangling the Metabolic Reprogramming in Brain Cancer: Discovering Key Molecular Players Using Mass Spectrometry.</a></h1><p>Cells metabolism alteration is the new hallmark of cancer, as well as an important method for carcinogenesis investigation. It is well known that the malignant cells switch to aerobic  pathway occurring also in healthy proliferating cells. Recently, it was shown that in malignant cells de novo synthesis of the intracellular fatty  replaces dietary fatty  which change the lipid composition of cancer cells noticeably. These alterations in energy metabolism and structural lipid production explain the high proliferation rate of malignant tissues. However, metabolic reprogramming affects not only lipid metabolism but many of the metabolic pathways in the cell. 2-hydroxyglutarate was considered as cancer cell biomarker and its presence is associated with oxidative stress influencing the mitochondria functions. Among the variety of metabolite detection methods, mass spectrometry stands out as the most effective method for simultaneous identification and quantification of the metabolites. As the metabolic reprogramming is tightly connected with epigenetics and signaling modifications, the evaluation of metabolite alterations in cells is a promising approach to investigate the carcinogenesis which is necessary for improving current diagnostic capabilities and therapeutic capabilities. In this paper, we overview recent studies on metabolic alteration and oncometabolites, especially concerning brain cancer and mass spectrometry approaches which are now in use for the investigation of the metabolic pathway.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629899>Benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP) triggers the malignancy of acute myeloid leukemia cells via upregulation of PDK4.</a></h1><p>Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a cancer of hematopoietic stem cells with a rapid progression. Recent studies indicated that endocrine disruptor chemicals (EDCs) are potential risk factors for AML progression. Our present data showed that an industrial endocrine disrupting chemical, Benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), can promote the proliferation of AML cells and decrease their sensitivity to daunorubicin (DNR) and cytarabine (Ara-C) treatments. Further, BBP can increase the glucose consumption, lactate generation, and ATP levels of AML cells. Among the measured -related genes, BBP can increase the expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase lipoamide kinase isozyme 4 (PDK4), a mitochondrial protein that regulates the tricarboxylic  cycle (TCA) cycle. The inhibitor of PDK4 or its specific siRNA can attenuate BBP-induced cell proliferation and ATP generation, which suggested the essential roles of PDK4 in BBP-induced  and proliferation. Further, BBP can increase the mRNA stability of PDK4, while had no effect on its transcription and protein stability. miR-15b-5p can bind with the 3'UTR of PDK4 to decrease its mRNA stability, while BBP can decrease the expression of miR-15b-5p in AML cells. Collectively, our data showed that BBP can trigger the malignancy of AML cells via regulation of miR-15b-5p/PDK4 signals.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

On the cellular level, metabolic flexibility revolves around the tricarboxylic  cycle by switching acetyl coenzyme A production from glucose to fatty  and vice versa. In this study, we modelled cellular metabolic flexibility by constructing a logical model connecting , fatty  oxidation, fatty  synthesis and the tricarboxylic  cycle, and then using network analysis to study the behaviours of the model.We observed that the substrate switching usually occurs through the inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDK), which moves the metabolism from  to fatty  oxidation. Furthermore, we were able to verify four different regulatory models of PDK to contain known biological observations, leading to the biological plausibility of all four models across different cells and conditions.These results suggest that the cellular metabolic flexibility depends upon the PDC-PDK regulatory interaction as a key regulatory switch for changing metabolic substrates.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31338815>Metabolic Regulations in Hematopoietic Stem Cells.</a></h1><p>One of the bottlenecks of the treatments for malignant hematopoietic disorders is the unavailability of sufficient amount of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). HSCs are considered to be originated from the aorta-gonad-mesonephros and gradually migrates into fetal liver and resides in a unique microenvironment/niche of bone marrow. Although many intrinsic and extrinsic factors (niche components) are reported to be involved in the origination, maturation, migration, and localization of HSCs at different developmental stages, the detailed molecular mechanisms still remain largely unknown. Previous studies have shown that intrinsic metabolic networks may be critical for the cell fate determinations of HSCs. For example, HSCs mainly utilize  as the main energy sources; oxidative phosphorylation is required for the homeostasis of HSCs; lipid or amino  metabolisms may also sustain HSC stemness. Mechanistically, lots of regulatory pathways, such as MEIS1/HIF1A and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, are found to fine-tune the different nutrient metabolisms and cell fate commitments of HSCs. However, more efforts are required for the optimization and establishment of precise metabolic techniques specific for the HSCs with relatively rare cell frequency and understanding of the basic metabolic properties and their underlying regulatory mechanisms of different nutrients (such as glucose) during the different developmental stages of HSCs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555134>Ethanol-Induced Hepatic Insulin Resistance is Ameliorated by Methyl Ferulic  Through the PI3K/AKT Signaling Pathway.</a></h1><p>One of the key events during the development of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is that alcohol inhibits the insulin signaling pathway in liver and leads to disorders of glucose and lipid metabolism. Methyl ferulic  (MFA) is a biologically active monomer isolated from the root of  Hasskarl. It has been reported that MFA has a hepatoprotective effect against alcohol-induced liver injury  and . However, the effect of MFA on ethanol-induced insulin resistance in ALD remains unclear. In this study, we investigated whether MFA could exert protective effects against hepatic insulin resistance in ethanol-induced L-02 cells and ALD rats. ALD was induced in vivo by feeding Lieber-DeCarli diet containing 5% (w/v) alcohol for 16 weeks to Sprague-Dawley rats. Insulin resistance was induced  in human hepatocyte L-02 cells with 200 mM ethanol for 24 h followed by 10-7 nM insulin for 30 min. MFA exhibited the effects of inhibited insulin resistance, reduced enzymatic capacity for hepatic gluconeogenesis, and increased hepatic glycogen synthesis both  and . In addition, the results of transcriptome sequencing of liver tissues in the ethanol- and MFA-treated groups indicated that "pyruvate metabolism," "/gluconeogenesis," and "fatty  metabolism" were significantly different between ethanol- and MFA-treated groups. Further studies suggested that MFA activated the hepatic phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway  and . Taken together, these findings suggested that MFA effectively ameliorated hepatic insulin resistance in ALD at least partially by acting on the PI3K/AKT pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31558821>Quantitative proteomic analysis of enhanced cellular effects of electrochemotherapy with Cisplatin in triple-negative breast cancer cells.</a></h1><p>Due to the lack of the three main receptors, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is refractive to standard chemotherapy. Hence, alternate therapies are needed. TNBCs utilize , which heightens their growth, proliferation, invasiveness, chemotherapeutic resistance and poor therapeutic response. This calls for novel therapeutic strategies to target these metabolic vulnerabilities present in TNBC. Electroporation-mediated chemotherapy, known as electrochemotherapy (ECT) is gaining momentum as an attractive alternative. However, its molecular mechanisms need better understanding. Towards this, label-free quantitative proteomics is utilized to gain insight into the anticancer mechanisms of ECT using electrical pulses (EP) and Cisplatin (CsP) on MDA-MB-231, human TNBC cells. The results indicate that EP + CsP significantly downregulated 14 key  proteins (including ENO1, LDHA, LDHB, ACSS2, ALDOA, and PGK1), compared to CsP alone. EP + CsP caused a switch in the metabolism with upregulation of 34 oxidative phosphorylation pathway proteins and 18 tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle proteins compared to CsP alone, accompanied by the upregulation of proteins linked to several metabolic reactions, which produce TCA cycle intermediates. Moreover, EP + CsP promoted multiple pathways to cause 1.3-fold increase in the reactive oxygen species concentration and induced apoptosis. The proteomics results correlate well with cell viability, western blot, and qPCR data. While some effects were similar for EP, more comprehensive and long-lasting effects were observed for EP + CsP, which demonstrate the potential of EP + CsP against TNBC cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31552471>Metabolic reprogramming in osteoclasts.</a></h1><p>Osteoclasts are bone-resorbing cells that play an essential role in the remodeling of the bone. Defects in osteoclasts thus result in unbalanced bone remodeling, leading to numerous pathological conditions such as osteoporosis, bone metastasis, and inflammatory bone erosion. Metabolism is any process a cell utilizes to meet its energetic demand for biological functions. Along with signaling pathways and osteoclast-specific gene expression programs, osteoclast differentiation activates metabolic programs. The energy generated from metabolic reprogramming in osteoclasts not only supports the phenotypic changes from mononuclear precursor cells to multinuclear osteoclasts, but also facilitates bone resorption, a major function of terminally differentiated, mature osteoclasts. While oxidative phosphorylation is studied as a major metabolic pathway that fulfills the energy demands of osteoclasts, all metabolic pathways are closely interconnected. Therefore, it remains important to understand the various aspects of osteoclast metabolism, including the roles and effects of , glutaminolysis, fatty  synthesis, and fatty  oxidation. Targeting the pathways associated with metabolic reprogramming has shown beneficial effects on pathological conditions. As a result, it is clear that a deeper understanding of metabolic regulation in osteoclasts will offer broader translational potential for the treatment of human bone disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31491402>FABP5 is correlated with poor prognosis and promotes tumour cell growth and metastasis in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.</a></h1><p>To support proliferation, tumour cells often undergo a metabolic switch to aerobic , and a large amount of fatty  (FAs) is produced to provide conditions for the formation of cell membrane structures. This phenomenon is particularly prominent in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). FAs need to be combined with fatty  binding proteins (FABPs) for transport. Fatty  Binding Protein 5 (FABP5) is an important chaperone protein of FAs that is upregulated in a variety of tumours. However, to date, the potential regulatory role and molecular mechanisms of FABP5 in the development and progression of cancers, including ccRCC, remain unknown. Herein, we demonstrate that FABP5 is upregulated in human ccRCC tissues and cell lines and is positively correlated with the progression of ccRCC. FABP5 deletion inhibits the proliferation, colony-forming ability and migration of ccRCC cells, suggesting that FABP5 may be a cancer-promoting protein in ccRCC. Mechanistically, FABP5 deletion significantly downregulated MMP9 and the transcription factor Snail1 in addition to upregulating E-cadherin and downregulating N-cadherin and Vimentin to inhibit epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the ACHN cell line. In summary, our data suggest that FABP5 may be a potential therapeutic target in ccRCC.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Innate immunity is the first line defense to prevent pathogen invasion, and neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells and natural killer cells (NK cells) are closely involved in the process of the immune-regulation during sepsis. Recently, metabolic reprogramming in immune cells is known as a keystone for immune intervention therapy in sepsis.

The current study employed a new research method, which combined the ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, to investigate the intrinsic mechanism of Shikonin (SK) against . The levels of 27 metabolites, which mainly involved in histone deacetylation, amino  synthesis, lipid synthesis, nitrogen metabolism, tricarboxylic  cycle, oxidative stress and , were remarkably changed upon SK treatment. Specially, the down-regulation of nicotinamide (NAM) upon SK treatment indicated the suppression of the deacetylation of the histone H3 on lysine 56 residue (H3K56). Further experiment confirmed that the level of H3K56 acetylation (H3K56ac) was dramatically increased upon SK treatment which was mediated by , the gene encoding the H3K56 deacetylase (Hst3p). Our results demonstrated that SK is the first natural compound reported to execute antifungal activity directly via boosting H3K56ac mediated by . Importantly, this finding shed new light on the mechanisms to relieve the side effects or reverse the drug tolerance, as well as the development of agents for antifungal therapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31574317>Connecting central carbon and aromatic amino  metabolisms to improve de novo 2-phenylethanol production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</a></h1><p>The organic compound 2-phenylethanol (2PE) has a pleasant floral scent and is intensively used in the cosmetic and food industries. Microbial production of 2PE by phenylalanine bioconversion or de novo biosynthesis from sugar offer sustainable, reliable and natural production processes compared to chemical synthesis. Despite the ability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to naturally synthesize 2PE, de novo synthesis in high concentration and yield remains a metabolic engineering challenge. Here, we demonstrate that improving phosphoenolpyruvate supply by expressing pyruvate kinase variants and eliminating the formation of p-hydroxy-phenylethanol without creating tyrosine auxotrophy significantly contributed to improve 2PE production in S. cerevisiae. In combination with the engineering of the aromatic amino  biosynthesis and Ehrlich pathway, these mutations enabled better connection between  and pentose phosphate pathway optimizing carbon flux towards 2PE. However, attempts to further connect these two parts of central carbon metabolism by redirecting fructose-6P towards erythrose-4P by expressing a phosphoketolase-phosphotransacetylase pathway did not result in improved performance. The best performing strains were capable of producing 13mM of 2PE at a yield of 0.113 mol mol, which represents the highest yield for de novo produced 2PE in S. cerevisiae and other yeast species.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

However, iPSC-CMs exhibit immature fetal CM-like characteristics that are different from adult CMs in several aspects, including cellular structure and metabolism. As an example,  is a major energy source for immature CMs. As CMs mature, the mitochondrial oxidative capacity increases, with fatty  β-oxidation becoming a key energy source to meet the heart's high energy demand. The immaturity of iPSC-CMs thereby limits their applications. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the energy substrate fatty -treated iPSC-CMs exhibit adult CM-like metabolic properties. After 20 days of differentiation from human iPSCs, iPSC-CMs were sequentially cultured with CM purification medium (lactate+/glucose-) for 7 days and maturation medium (fatty +/glucose-) for 3-7 days by mimicking the adult CM's preference of utilizing fatty  as a major metabolic substrate. The purity and maturity of iPSC-CMs were characterized via the analysis of: (1) Expression of CM-specific markers (e.g., troponin T, and sodium and potassium channels) using RT-qPCR, Western blot or immunofluorescence staining and electron microscopy imaging; and (2) cell energy metabolic profiles using the XF96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer. iPSCs-CMs (98% purity) cultured in maturation medium exhibited enhanced elongation, increased mitochondrial numbers with more aligned Z-lines, and increased expression of matured CM-related genes, suggesting that fatty -contained medium promotes iPSC-CMs to undergo maturation. In addition, the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) linked to basal respiration, ATP production, and maximal respiration and spare respiratory capacity (representing mitochondrial function) was increased in matured iPSC-CMs. Mature iPSC-CMs also displayed a larger change in basal and maximum respirations due to the utilization of exogenous fatty  (palmitate) compared with non-matured control iPSC-CMs. Etomoxir (a carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 inhibitor) but not 2-deoxyglucose (an inhibitor of ) abolished the palmitate pretreatment-mediated OCR increases in mature iPSC-CMs. Collectively, our data demonstrate for the first time that fatty  treatment promotes metabolic maturation of iPSC-CMs (as evidenced by enhanced mitochondrial oxidative function and strong capacity of utilizing fatty  as energy source). These matured iPSC-CMs might be a promising human CM source for broad biomedical application.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31575551>Metabolic Consequences of T-cell Costimulation in Anticancer Immunity.</a></h1><p>T-cell functional behavior and performance are closely regulated by nutrient availability and the control of metabolism within the T cell. T cells have distinct energetic and anabolic needs when nascently activated, actively proliferating, in naïveté, or in a resting, memory state. As a consequence, bioenergetics are key for T cells to mount adequate immune responses in health and disease. Solid tumors are particularly hostile metabolic environments, characterized by low glucose concentration, hypoxia, and low pH. These metabolic conditions in the tumor are known to hinder antitumor immune responses of T cells by limiting nutrient availability and energetic efficiency. In such immunosuppressive environments, artificial modulation of , mitochondrial respiratory capabilities, and fatty  β-oxidation are known to enhance antitumor performance. Reportedly, costimulatory molecules, such as CD28 and CD137, are important regulators of metabolic routes in T cells. In this sense, different costimulatory signals and cytokines induce diverse metabolic changes that critically involve mitochondrial mass and function. For instance, the efficacy of chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) encompassing costimulatory domains, agonist antibodies to costimulatory receptors, and checkpoint inhibitors depends on the associated metabolic events in immune cells. Here, we review the metabolic changes that costimulatory receptors can promote in T cells and the potential consequences for cancer immunotherapy. Our focus is mostly on discoveries regarding the physiology and pharmacology of IL15, CD28, PD-1, and CD137 (4-1BB).©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31354667>A Novel Two-Component System, Encoded by the s/ Genes, Affects  Morphology in Liquid Culture.</a></h1><p> are mycelial bacteria adapted to grow in soil. They have become important producers of biomolecules with medical applications, but their growth in industrial fermenters is challenged by their peculiar morphology in liquid culture: the hyphae tend to clump and grow as large pellets, which are oxygen- and nutrient-limited, grow slowly and present diminished protein production. Here, by implementing an experimental evolution strategy, a  strain, 2L12, with dispersed morphology and reduced pellet size in liquid culture and no defects in either differentiation or secondary metabolism was selected. Genome sequencing revealed a single amino  substitution in a sensor kinase, Sco5282, of unknown function to be responsible for the morphological changes. Moreover, genetic and biochemical scrutiny identified Sco5283 as the cognate response regulator and demonstrated that the acquired mutation activates this two-component system. Finally, transcriptomic analysis of the mutant strain revealed changes in expression of genes involved in central processes such as , gluconeogenesis, stress-signaling pathways, proteins secretion and cell envelope metabolism.

In this study, we investigated the roles of glucose-related metabolic pathways during the replication of infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV), which has caused serious economic losses in the cultured Chinese perch () industry. We found that ISKNV infection enhanced the metabolic pathways of the PPP and the TCA cycle at the early stage of the ISKNV infection cycle and enhanced the  pathway at the late stage of the ISKNV infection cycle though the comprehensive analysis of transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. The advanced results proved that ISKNV replication induced upregulation of aerobic  at the late stage of ISKNV infection cycle and aerobic  were required for ISKNV multiplication.

However, the actual glycolipid metabolism gene expression, as well as the possible pathways that regulate glycolipid metabolism in the schistosome-infected liver, has not been extensively explored.In this study, we evaluated the dynamic expression of glycolipid metabolism-associated genes and proteins in the livers from mice infected with Schistosoma japonicum at the indicated time points using real-time PCR and immunofluorescence. Then, cultures of macrophages were treated with schistosome soluble egg antigen (SEA) to detect the expression levels of genes associated with glucose and lipid metabolism in order to identify macrophages metabolic characteristics in response to these antigens. Furthermore, SEA-stimulated macrophages were co-cultures with hepatocytes and detected the effects of macrophages on the gene expression of hepatocytes metabolism.The expression of -related genes (Ldha, Glut4, Pkm2, Glut1, Pfkfb3, Aldoc, HK2, Pfk) in the liver were upregulated but the gluconeogenesis gene (G6pc) was downregulated during S. japonicum infection. In addition, the mRNA levels of fatty  (FA) oxidation-related genes (Ucp2, Atp5b, Pparg) in the liver were significantly upregulated; however, the FA synthesis genes (Fas, Acc, Scd1, Srebp1c) and lipid uptake gene (Cd36) were downregulated post-S. japonicum-infection. In consistence with these data, stimulation with SEA in vitro significantly enhanced the gene expression that involved in  and FA oxidation, but decreased genes related to gluconeogenesis, FA synthesis and lipid uptake in macrophages. The levels of phosphorylated AMPK, AKT and mTORC1 were increased in macrophages after SEA stimulation. Inhibition of phosphorylated AMPK, AKT and mTORC1 promoted SEA-treated macrophages to produce glucose. In addition, suppression of phosphorylated-AMPK, but not phosphorylated-AKT and phosphorylated-mTOR, induced the lipid accumulation in SEA-stimulated macrophages. Furthermore, SEA-treated macrophages significantly reduced the expression of Acc mRNA in hepatocytes in vitro.These findings reveal S. japonicum infection induces dynamic changes in the expression levels of genes involved in catabolism (glucose uptake,  and fatty  oxidation) and suppressing anabolism (glycogen synthesis) in the liver, which could occur via macrophages' metabolic states, particularly those involved in the AMPK, AKT and mTORC1 pathways.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621967>Fructose metabolism as a common evolutionary pathway of survival associated with climate change, food shortage and droughts.</a></h1><p>Mass extinctions occur frequently in natural history. While studies of animals that became extinct can be informative, it is the survivors that provide clues for mechanisms of adaptation when conditions are adverse. Here, we describe a survival pathway used by many species as a means for providing adequate fuel and water, while also providing protection from a decrease in oxygen availability. Fructose, whether supplied in the diet (primarily fruits and honey), or endogenously (via activation of the polyol pathway), preferentially shifts the organism towards the storing of fuel (fat, glycogen) that can be used to provide energy and water at a later date. Fructose causes sodium retention and raises blood pressure and likely helped survival in the setting of dehydration or salt deprivation. By shifting energy production from the mitochondria to , fructose reduced oxygen demands to aid survival in situations where oxygen availability is low. The actions of fructose are driven in part by vasopressin and the generation of uric . Twice in history, mutations occurred during periods of mass extinction that enhanced the activity of fructose to generate fat, with the first being a mutation in vitamin C metabolism during the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction (65 million years ago) and the second being a mutation in uricase that occurred during the Middle Miocene disruption (12-14 million years ago). Today, the excessive intake of fructose due to the availability of refined sugar and high-fructose corn syrup is driving 'burden of life style' diseases, including obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure.© 2019 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31446011>Characterization of filarial phosphoglycerate kinase.</a></h1><p>Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) is a key enzyme of  which also acts as a mediator of DNA replication and repair in the nucleus. We have cloned and expressed PGK in Brugia malayi. The rBmPGK was found to be 415 amino  residues long having 45 kDa subunit molecular weight. This enzyme was also identified in different life stages of bovine filarial parasite Setaria cervi. The enzyme activity was highest in microfilarial stage followed by adult female and male as also shown by real time PCR in the present study. Further using BmPGK primers the cDNA prepared from S. cervi was amplified and sequenced which showed 100% homology with Brugia malayi PGK. B. malayi and S. cervi, PGK consists of conserved calmodulin binding domain (CaMBD) having 21 amino . In the present study we have shown the CaMBD binds to calcium-calmodulin and regulates its activity.

The effect of CaM-Caon the activity of rBmPGK was studied at different concentration of CaM (0.01-5.0 μM) and calcium chloride (0.01-100 μM). The rBmPGK was activated up to 85% in the presence of CaM at 1 μM and 10 μM concentration of CaCl. Interestingly this activation was abrogated by metal chelator EDTA. Similar results were shown in case of Setaria cervi PGK. A significant increase (90 ± 10) % in ScPGK activity was observed in the presence of CaM and CaCl at 1.0 μM and 1.0 mM respectively, further increase in the conc. of CaCl, the activity of ScPGK was found to be decreased like rBmPGK. Bioinformatics studies have also confirmed the interaction between CaMBD and CaM which showed CaM interacted to Phe 206, Gln 220, Arg 223 and Asn 224 of rBmPGK CaM binding domain. On the basis of these findings, it has been suggested that the activity of filarial PGK could be regulated in cells by Ca-CaM depending upon the concentration of calcium.

In addition to being the end product of , pyruvate is an essential carbon distribution point to oxidative metabolism, amino  and fatty  syntheses, and overflow metabolite production. Hence, a tight regulation of pyruvate kinase (Pyk) activity is of great importance. This study aimed to analyze targeted metabolites from several pathways and possible changes in  lacking Pyk. Wild type and Δpyk cells were cultivated in chemically defined medium with glucose and pyruvate as carbon sources, and the extracted metabolites were analyzed by H-NMR, GC-MS, HPLC-MS, and LC-MS/MS. The results showed that the perturbation created in the pyruvate node drove an adaptation to new conditions by altering the nutritional compounds' consumption. In Δpyk, pyruvate, which is subject to glucose-dependent carbon catabolite repression, did not comply with the hierarchy in carbon source utilization.

We found that mitochondrial respiration was reduced in CSE-treated PMVECs and in PMVECs from COPD patients. Specifically, oxidation of fatty  (FAO) was reduced in these cells, which linked to reduced carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (Cpt1a), an essential enzyme for carnitine shuttle. CSE-induced apoptosis was further increased when cells were treated with a specific Cpt1 inhibitor etomoxir or transfected with Cpt1a siRNA. L-Carnitine treatment augmented FAO but attenuated CSE-induced apoptosis by upregulating Cpt1a. CSE treatment increased palmitate-derived ceramide synthesis, which was reduced by L-carnitine. Although CSE treatment increased , inhibiting  with 2-deoxy-d-glucose had no effects on CSE-mediated apoptosis in lung ECs. Conclusively, FAO reduction increases ceramide and apoptosis in lung ECs treated with CSE, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of COPD/emphysema.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31551816>BCAA Catabolic Defect Alters Glucose Metabolism in Lean Mice.</a></h1><p>Recent studies show branched-chain amino  (BCAA) catabolic pathway is defective in obese animals and humans, contributing to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and diabetes. However, in the context of obesity, various processes including the dysfunctional lipid metabolism can affect insulin sensitivity and glycemic regulation. It remains unclear how BCAA catabolic defect may exert direct impacts on glucose metabolism without the disturbance of obesity. The current study characterized the glucose metabolism in lean mice in which the genetic deletion of PP2Cm leads to moderate BCAA catabolic defect. Interestingly, compared to the wildtype control, lean PP2Cm deficient mice showed enhanced insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, lower body weight, and the preference for carbohydrate over lipids utilization. Metabolomics profiling of plasma and tissues revealed significantly different metabolic patterns in the PP2Cm deficient mice, featured by the marked alterations in glucose metabolic processes, including gluconeogenesis/, glycogen metabolism, and tricarboxylic  cycle. The metabolic changes of glucose were predominantly observed in liver but not skeletal muscle or white adipose tissue. The elevated branched-chain keto  (BCKAs) resulted from the BCAA catabolic defect may play a critical role in regulating the expression of key regulators of glucose metabolic processes and the activity of respiratory Complex II/succinate dehydrogenase in TCA cycle. Together, these results show BCAA catabolic defect significantly alters glucose metabolism in lean mice with some impacts different or even opposite from those in obese mice, highlighting the critical role of BCAA catabolism in glycemic regulation and the complex interplay between macronutrients in lean and obese animals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620662>Altered metabolism for neuroprotection provided by mesenchymal stem cells.</a></h1><p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent adult stem cells which have become popular research targets for their use in cellular therapy for tissue repair. While recent advancements in research have shown the MSCs have immunomodulatory functions which are altered in response to host inflammatory molecules, how these stimuli produce different functional outcomes is not understood. Here, we evaluate research examining how the proinflammatory cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ) affects the immunomodulatory functions of MSCs by altering their metabolism. This study indicates that IFN-γ causes an increase in glycolytic activity and uncoupling of  to tricarboxylic  cycle and hence, the glycolytic metabolites and intermediates can be funneled toward the production of anti-inflammatory modulators indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase and PGE2. A complete understanding of how MSCs' cellular metabolism affects their function is necessary for their employment in cellular therapy, as MSCs have been demonstrated to have pro- and anti-inflammatory functions. These findings are a large step forward in the understanding of the regulation of MSCs and toward their eventual use in cellular therapy, specifically for stroke recovery, in which MSCs have been shown to have powerful neuroprotective and neurogenerative effects.Copyright: © 2019 Brain Circulation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31553634>Function of ion transporters in maintaining -base homeostasis of the mammary gland and the pathophysiological role in breast cancer.</a></h1><p>The incidence of breast cancer is increasing year by year, and the pathogenesis is still unclear. Studies have shown that the high metabolism of solid tumours leads to an increase in hypoxia, , production of lactic  and carbonic , and extracellular acidification; a harsh microenvironment; and ultimately to tumour cell death. Approximately 50% of locally advanced breast cancers exhibit hypoxia and/or local hypoxia, and -base regulatory proteins play an important role in regulating milk secretion and maintaining mammary gland physiological function. Therefore, ion transporters have gradually become a hot topic in mammary gland and breast cancer research.

NPs may provide a vehicle for the anticancer drug lonidamine (LND), which inhibits  but was suspended from use at the clinical trial stage because of its hepatotoxicity due to poor solubility and pharmacokinetic properties. The NPs prepared by coassembly of the anionic polypeptide poly gamma glutamic  (γ-PGA) and a designed amphiphilic and positively charged peptide (designated as mPoP-NPs) delivered LND to the mitochondria in cell cultures. In this study, we demonstrate that LND-mPoP-NP effective drug concentrations can be increased to reach therapeutically relevant concentrations. The self-assembled NP solution was subjected to snap-freezing and lyophilization and the resultant powder was redissolved in a tenth of the original volume. The NP size and their ability to target the proximity of the mitochondria of breast cancer cells were both maintained in this new formulation, C-LND-mPoP-NPs. Furthermore, these NPs exhibited 40% better cytotoxicity, relative to the nonlyophilized LND-mPoP-NPs and led to tumor growth inhibition with no adverse side effects upon intravenous administration in a xenograft breast cancer murine model.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31434645>A Tumor Agnostic Therapeutic Strategy for Hexokinase 1-Null/Hexokinase 2-Positive Cancers.</a></h1><p>Since Warburg's observation that most cancers exhibit elevated , decades of research have attempted to reduce tumor glucose utilization as a therapeutic approach. Hexokinase (HK) activity is the first glycolytic enzymatic step; despite many attempts to inhibit HK activity, none has reached clinical application. Identification of HK isoforms, and recognition that most tissues express only HK1 while most tumors express HK1 and HK2, stimulated reducing HK2 activity as a therapeutic option. However, studies using HK2 shRNA and isogenic HK1HK2 and HK1HK2 tumor cell pairs demonstrated that tumors expressing only HK1, while exhibiting reduced glucose consumption, progressed  as well as tumors expressing both HK1 and HK2. However, HK1HK2 tumor subpopulations exist among many cancers. shRNA HK2 suppression in HK1HK2 liver cancer cells reduced xenograft tumor progression, in contrast to HK1HK2 cells. HK2 inhibition, and partial inhibition of both oxidative phosphorylation and fatty  oxidation using HK2 shRNA and small-molecule drugs, prevented human liver HK1HK2 cancer xenograft progression. Using human multiple myeloma xenografts and mouse allogeneic models to identify potential clinical translational agents, triple therapies that include antisense HK2 oligonucleotides, metformin, and perhexiline prevent progression. These results suggest an agnostic approach for HK1HK2 cancers, regardless of tissue origin.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31553812>Subcellular NAMPT-mediated NAD salvage pathways and their roles in bioenergetics and neuronal protection after ischemic injury.</a></h1><p>NAD is a cofactor required for , tricarboxylic  cycle, and complex I enzymatic reaction. In mammalian cells, NAD is predominantly synthesized through the salvage pathway, where nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is the rate-limiting enzyme. Previously, we demonstrated that NAMPT exerts a neuroprotective effect in ischemia through the suppression of mitochondrial dysfunction. Mammalian cells maintain distinct NAD pools in the cytosol, mitochondria, and nuclei. However, it is unknown whether mitochondria have an intact machinery for NAD salvage, and if so, whether it plays a dominant role in bioenergetics, mitochondrial function, and neuronal protection after ischemia. Here, using mouse primary cortical neuron and cortical tissue preparations, and multiple technologies including cytosolic and mitochondrial subfractionation, viral over-expression of transgenes, molecular biology, and confocal microscopy, we provided compelling evidence that neuronal mitochondria possess an intact machinery of NAMPT-mediated NAD salvage pathway, and that NAMPT and nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 3 (NMNAT3) are localized in the mitochondrial matrix. By knocking down NMNAT1-3 and NAMPT with siRNA, we found that NMNAT3 has a larger effect on basal and ATP production-related mitochondrial respiration than NMNAT1-2 in primary cultured neurons, while NMNAT1-2 have a larger effect on glycolytic flux than NMNAT3. Using an oxygen glucose deprivation model, we found that mitochondrial, cytoplasmic, and non-subcellular compartmental over-expressions of NAMPT have a comparable effect on neuronal protection and suppression of apoptosis-inducing factor translocation. The current study provides novel insights into the roles of subcellular compartmental NAD salvage pathways in NAD homeostasis, bioenergetics, and neuronal protection in ischemic conditions.© 2019 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31447867>Genotypic Variation in the Root and Shoot Metabolite Profiles of Wheat ( L.) Indicate Sustained, Preferential Carbon Allocation as a Potential Mechanism in Phosphorus Efficiency.</a></h1><p>Changes in the levels of plant metabolites in response to nutrient deficiency is indicative of how plants utilize scarce resources. In this study, changes in the metabolite profile of roots and shoots of wheat genotypes differing in phosphorus use efficiency (PUE) was investigated. Under low P supply and at 28 days after sowing (DAS), the wheat breeding line, RAC875 (P efficient) produced 42% more shoot biomass than the wheat variety, and Wyalkatchem (P inefficient). Significant changes in the metabolite profile in leaves and roots were observed under low P supply and significant genotypic variation was evident. Under low P supply, an increase in raffinose and 1-kestose was evident in roots of both wheat genotypes, with RAC875 accumulating more when compared to Wyalkatchem. There was no significant increase in raffinose and 1-kestose in leaves when plants were grown under P deficiency. P deficiency had no significant impact on the levels of sucrose, maltose, glucose and fructose in both genotypes, and while phosphorylated sugars (glucose-6-P and fructose-6-P) remained unchanged in RAC875, in Wyalkatchem, glucose-6-P significantly decreased in roots, and fructose-6-P significantly decreased in both leaves and roots. Glycerol-3-P decreased twofold in roots of both wheat genotypes in response to low P. In roots, RAC875 exhibited significantly lower levels of fumarate, malate, maleate and itaconate than Wyalkatchem, while low P enhanced organic  exudation in RAC875 but not in Wyalkatchem. RAC875 showed greater accumulation of aspartate, glutamine and β-alanine in leaves than Wyalkatchem under low P supply. Greater accumulation of raffinose and 1-kestose in roots and aspartate, glutamine and β-alanine in leaves appears to be associated with enhanced PUE in RAC875. Glucose-6-P and fructose-6-P are important for , thus maintaining these metabolites would enable RAC875 to maintain carbohydrate metabolism and shoot biomass under P deficiency. The work presented here provides evidence that differences in metabolite profiles can be observed between wheat varieties that differ in PUE and key metabolic pathways are maintained in the efficient genotype to ensure carbon supply under P deficiency.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572189>Bio-Inspired Silver Nanoparticles Impose Metabolic and Epigenetic Toxicity to .</a></h1><p>Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have many applications in various fields, including biomedical applications. Due to the broad range of applications, they are considered as the leading fraction of manufactured nanoparticles. AgNPs are synthesized by different types of chemical and biological (green) methods. Previously, biologically synthesized AgNPs were considered safe for the environment and humans. However, new toxicity evidence have initiated a more careful assessment to delineate the toxicity mechanisms associated with these nanoparticles. This study demonstrates the use of aqueous gooseberry extract for AgNP preparation in a time- and cost-effective way. Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and dynamic light scattering confirm the formation of AgNPs, with an average size between 50 and 100 nm. Untargeted H-nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomics revealed manyfold up- and down-regulation in the concentration of 55 different classes of annotated metabolites in AgNP-exposed yeast  cells. Based on their chemical nature and cellular functions, these metabolites are classified into amino ,  and the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle, organic , nucleotide metabolism, urea cycle, and lipid metabolism. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the genes involved in oxidative stress mitigation maintain their expression levels, whereas the genes of the TCA cycle and lipid metabolism show drastic down-regulation upon AgNP exposure. Moreover, they can induce alteration in histone epigenetic marks by altering the methylation and acetylation of selected histone H3 and H4 proteins. Altogether, we conclude that the selected dose of biologically synthesized AgNPs impose toxicity by modulating the transcriptome, epigenome, and metabolome of eukaryotic cells, which eventually cause disequilibrium in cellular metabolism leading to toxicity.Copyright © 2019 Babele, Singh and Srivastava.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31359396>Evaluating the Role of RARβ Signaling on Cellular Metabolism in Melanoma Using the Seahorse XF Analyzer.</a></h1><p>Dysregulation of retinoic  signaling is implicated in several human cancer types, including melanoma where the gene encoding retinoic  receptor beta (RARβ) is frequently silenced by promoter hypermethylation.

Myocardial preference for oxidizable substrates changes in both hypertrophy and in overt failure. Previous work has shown that glucose oxidation is upregulated in overpressure hypertrophy, but its fate in overt failure is less clear. Anaplerotic flux of pyruvate into the tricarboxylic  cycle (TCA) has been posited as a secondary fate of , aside from pyruvate oxidation or lactate production.A model of heart failure that emulates both valvular and hypertensive heart disease, the severe transaortic constriction (sTAC) mouse, was assayed for changes in substrate preference using metabolomic and carbon-13 flux measurements. Quantitative measures of O consumption in the Langendorff perfused mouse heart were paired with C isotopomer analysis to assess TCA cycle turnover. Since the heart accommodates oxidation of all physiological energy sources, the utilization of carbohydrates, fatty , and ketones were measured simultaneously using a triple-tracer NMR method. The fractional contribution of glucose to acetyl-CoA production was upregulated in heart failure, while other sources were not significantly different. A model that includes both pyruvate carboxylation and anaplerosis through succinyl-CoA produced superior fits to the data compared to a model using only pyruvate carboxylation. In the sTAC heart, anaplerosis through succinyl-CoA is elevated, while pyruvate carboxylation was not. Metabolomic data showed depleted TCA cycle intermediate pool sizes versus the control, in agreement with previous results.In the sTAC heart failure model, the glucose contribution to acetyl-CoA production was significantly higher, with compensatory changes in fatty  and ketone oxidation not reaching a significant level. Anaplerosis through succinyl-CoA is also upregulated, and is likely used to preserve TCA cycle intermediate pool sizes. The triple tracer method used here is new, and can be used to assess sources of acetyl-CoA production in any oxidative tissue.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We have evaluated an in vitro mouse testis organ culture model capable of producing viable, fertilization-proven sperm as a possible toxicity test model. Although this in vitro model was limited to round spermatid differentiation, histopathology observations could still be performed. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis (LC/MS)-based metabolomics was used to measure metabolome changes of chemically treated in vitro testis fragments.On Postnatal Day 5, C57BL/6J mouse testes were divided into four fragments, which were placed onto a 1.5% agarose gel cube and cultured in α-MEM including 0.4% AlbuMAX I (Day 0). On Day 1 of culture, testis fragments were treated with 0 (control), 0.01, or 1 nM ethinylestradiol (EE). On Day 20 of culture, the testis fragments were collected for LC/MS and histology analysis.Several metabolites involved in glycogen metabolism and  pathways (uridine diphosphate-glucose, glucose phosphate, and pyruvate), in the tricarboxylic  cycle pathway (oxaloacetate and aspartate), and in the arginine and proline metabolism (arginine and spermine) were significantly altered in the 1 nM EE treated group compared to the control group. The metabolite changes were associated with an increase in percentage of seminiferous tubules with round spermatids as well as dose-dependent dead cells.These findings suggest that EE treatment may cause testicular toxicity by affecting glycogen metabolism and energy pathways. To confirm these findings, further experiments will be necessary using other testicular toxicants.Published 2019.

Oncogenic mutations and loss of tumor suppressor genes further reprogram CRC cells to upregulate , glutaminolysis, one-carbon metabolism, and fatty  synthesis. These metabolic changes are not uniform throughout tumors, as subpopulations of tumor cells may rely on different pathways to adapt to nutrient availability in the local tumor microenvironment. Finally, metabolic cross-communication between stromal cells, immune cells, and the gut microbiota enable CRC growth, invasion, and metastasis.Altered cellular metabolism occurs in CRC at multiple levels, including in the cells that make up the bulk of CRC tumors, cancer stem cells, the tumor microenvironment, and host-microbiome interactions.

Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is a metabolic enzyme that converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, connecting  to the TCA cycle, thus regulating cellular energy metabolism. PDH is involved in multiple cellular processes, such as glucose metabolism, fatty  synthesis, and protein acetylation, all of which are mediated by acetyl-CoA. We previously demonstrated that PDH-E1β is downregulated in prolonged hypoxia and inhibits PDH activity, which serves as machinery to securely inhibit PDH activity together with PDH-E1α phosphorylation. PDH has been identified to localize to the nucleus in addition to mitochondria, but its precise regulatory mechanisms in the nucleus remain elusive. In the present study, we characterized nuclear PDH during prolonged hypoxia. Nuclear PDH complex was downregulated under hypoxic conditions, and PDH activity was reduced. Depletion of HIF-1α partly recovered nuclear levels of the PDH complex. Furthermore, decreased nuclear PDH activity resulted in reduced histone H3 acetylation, altering the gene expression profile of cells exposed to prolonged hypoxia. Taken together, these findings indicate that nuclear PDH complex is downregulated under prolonged hypoxic conditions and controls gene expression.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

It is a ubiquitous source of energy for every organism in the world and is essential to fuel both aerobic and anaerobic cellular respiration. Glucose often enters the body in isometric forms such as galactose and fructose (monosaccharides), lactose and sucrose (disaccharides), or starch (polysaccharide). Our body stores excess glucose as glycogen (a polymer of glucose) which become liberated in times of fasting. Glucose is also derivable from products of fat and protein break-down through the process of gluconeogenesis. Considering how vital glucose is for homeostasis, it is no surprise that there are a plethora of sources for it.  Once glucose is in the body, it travels through the blood and to energy-requiring tissues. There, glucose is broken down in a series of biochemical reactions releasing energy in the form of ATP. The ATP derived from these processes is used to fuel virtually every energy-requiring process in the body. In eukaryotes, most energy derives from aerobic (oxygen-requiring) processes which start with a molecule of glucose. The glucose is broken down first through the anaerobic process of , leading to the production of some ATP and pyruvate end-product. In anaerobic conditions, pyruvate converts to lactate through reduction. In aerobic conditions, the pyruvate can enter the citric  cycle to yield energy-rich electron carriers which help produce ATP at the electron transport chain (ETC).[1]Copyright © 2019, StatPearls Publishing LLC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647926>Empagliflozin reduces the levels of CD36 and cardiotoxic lipids while improving autophagy in the hearts of Zucker diabetic fatty rats.</a></h1><p>The EMPA-REG OUTCOME (Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)) trial made evident the potentiality of pharmacological sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition for treating patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Since the effect of empagliflozin or other SGLT2 inhibitors on the whole cardiac metabolic profile was never analysed before, and with the purpose to contribute to elucidate the benefits at cardiac level of the use of empagliflozin, we explored the effect of the treatment with empagliflozin for six weeks on the cardiac metabolomic profile of Zucker diabetic fatty rats, a model of early stage T2DM, using untargeted metabolomics approach. Empagliflozin reduced significantly the cardiac content of sphingolipids (ceramides and sphingomyelins) and glycerophospholipids (major bioactive contributing factors linking insulin resistance to cardiac damage) and decreased the cardiac content of the fatty  transporter cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36); induced significant decreases of the cardiac levels of essential  intermediaries 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate, and regulated the abundance of several amino  of relevance as tricarboxylic  suppliers and/or in the metabolic control of the cardiac function as glutamic , gamma-aminobutyric  and sarcosine. Empagliflozin treatment activated the cardioprotective master regulator of cellular energyhomeostasis AMP-activatedproteinkinase (AMPK) and enhanced autophagy at cardiac level, while it decreased significantly the cardiac mRNA levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), chemerin, TNF-α and MCP-1, reinforcing the hypothesis of a direct role for empagliflozin in attenuating cardiac inflammation.

We examined the nature and extent of such reports.To investigate associations between a ketogenic diet and mood stabilisation among individuals with bipolar disorder.We undertook an observational analytic study of free-text comments in online forums about mood effects of dietary interventions (ketogenic, omega-3 enriched or vegetarian) classified by a priori categories of change in mood stabilisation in 274 people with bipolar disorder.There were 141 (85.5%) free-text comments on ketogenic diets that reported a positive impact on mood stabilisation. Reports of significant mood stabilisation or remission of symptoms over a period were substantially higher for a ketogenic diet than for other diets (93/165, 56.4%, 95% CI 48.4-64.1) v. 14/94, 14.9%, 95% CI 8.4-23.7), odds ratio 7.4, 95% CI 3.8-14.1, P < 0.0001), many with detailed reports of the improvements experienced and several lasting for extended periods (months to years). Other reported associations included fewer episodes of depression (in 41.2%, 95% CI 30.6-52.4 of individuals); improved clarity of thought and speech (28.2%, 95% CI 19.0-39.0); increased energy (25.9, 95% CI 17.0-36.5); and weight loss (25.9%, 95% CI 17.0-36.5).Despite the inherent limitations of the observational data based on self-reports posted online, the association strength and reports of sustained benefit support a hypothesis of a ketogenic diet being associated with beneficial effects on mood stabilisation. Caution should be exercised in interpreting this data until a controlled trial can be carried out to examine this hypothesis.

Exogenous pyruvate modulates metabolism, provides cellular protection, and is essential for the maintenance of human preimplantation embryos and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). However, little is known about how pyruvate contributes to cell-fate determination during epiblast stage. In this study, we used hESCs as a model to demonstrate that elevated exogenous pyruvate shifts metabolic balance toward oxidative phosphorylation in both maintenance and differentiation conditions. During differentiation, pyruvate potentiates mesoderm and endoderm lineage specification. Pyruvate production and its mitochondrial metabolism are required in BMP4-induced mesoderm differentiation. However, the TCA-cycle metabolites do not have the same effect as pyruvate on differentiation. Further study shows that pyruvate increases AMP/ATP ratio, activates AMPK, and modulates the mTOR pathway to enhance mesoderm differentiation. This study reveals that exogenous pyruvate not only controls metabolism but also modulates signaling pathways in hESC differentiation.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

To cope with the threat of starvation, insects initiate a suite of behavioral activities and physiological countermeasures. The cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, is a major agricultural pest worldwide, but how H. armigera modulates its metabolism under starvation remains ambiguous. In the present study, the respiratory rates (V̇; ml g h) from the third-larval instar to the pupal stage were first determined. Our results highlighted a transient rise during the larval-larval molt and larval-pupal transition, followed by a sharp decline in the pupal stage and, finally, an upward trend before eclosion. When subjected to food deprivation, the starved larvae experienced a significant decline in the rates of O consumed and CO produced, as well as in respiratory quotient (RQ) values, indicative of severe metabolic depression during starvation and a shift of metabolic substrates with prolonged starvation. For metabolic substrate analysis, an apparent decline in triglyceride and glycogen contents was observed in the starved larvae, and the hemolymph trehalose content was significantly reduced throughout starvation.

However, the role of SIK2 in glucose metabolism reprogramming remains unclear in ovarian cancer (OC) cells. Here, we found that SIK2 significantly enhanced the Warburg effect of OC cells mainly through two mechanisms. On the one hand, SIK2 upregulated the expression of HIF-1α by activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which directly upregulated the transcription of major glycolytic genes to promote . On the other hand, SIK2 promoted mitochondrial fission through phosphorylation of Drp1 at Ser616 site, which inhibited the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. In addition, SIK2 promoted growth and metastasis of OC cells by promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting cell apoptosis, as well as enhancing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Moreover, the SIK2-mediated reprogramming of glucose metabolism played a critical role in growth and metastasis of OC cells. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that SIK2 is a crucial regulator of glucose metabolism in OC cells through activation of PI3K/AKT/HIF-1α pathway and Drp1 phosphorylation-mediated mitochondrial fission, which plays a critical oncogenic role in OC cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Variation in bull fertility has been demonstrated even among those animals exhibiting normal sperm numbers, motility, and morphology. Despite advances in research, molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the causes of low fertility in some bulls have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the metabolic profile of bull spermatozoa using non-targeted metabolomics. Statistical analysis and bioinformatic tools were employed to evaluate the metabolic profiles high and low fertility groups. Metabolic pathways associated with the sperm metabolome were also reported.A total of 22 distinct metabolites were detected in spermatozoa from bulls with high fertility (HF) or low fertility (LF) phenotype. The major metabolite classes of bovine sperm were organic /derivatives and fatty /conjugates. We demonstrated that the abundance ratios of five sperm metabolites were statistically different between HF and LF groups including gamma-aminobutyric  (GABA), carbamate, benzoic , lactic , and palmitic . Metabolites with different abundances in HF and LF bulls had also VIP scores of greater than 1.5 and AUC- ROC curves of more than 80%. In addition, four metabolic pathways associated with differential metabolites namely alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, β-alanine metabolism,  or gluconeogenesis, and pyruvate metabolism were also explored.This is the first study aimed at ascertaining the metabolome of spermatozoa from bulls with different fertility phenotype using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We identified five metabolites in the two groups of sires and such molecules can be used, in the future, as key indicators of bull fertility.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31507573>A Novel Strategy to Regulate 1-Deoxynojirimycin Production Based on Its Biosynthetic Pathway in .</a></h1><p>This study characterized the biosynthetic pathway of the secondary metabolite 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) from . The results revealed that glucose was a preferable precursor for DNJ synthesis, and its carbon skeleton underwent a C2-N-C6 cyclization reaction during synthesis. The biosynthetic pathway was related to the  pathway, and started from fructose-6-phosphate, and involved amination, dephosphorylation, oxidation, cyclization, dehydration, and reduction reaction steps, yielding DNJ. Then, based on clarified biosynthetic pathway information, precursors, analogs, and metabolism inhibitors were used as novel regulators to enhance the production of DNJ. The results demonstrated that the titer of DNJ could reach 296.56 mg/L, which was 3.3-fold higher than that of a control group (90 mg/L) when sodium citrate (0 h, 5 g/L), sorbose (0 h, 1 g/L), iodoacetic  (20 h, 50 mg/L), and glucose (26 h, 7 g/L) were added during the fermentation process. This study provides a new understanding of the biosynthetic pathway of DNJ, and also provides an efficient strategy to regulate the production of DNJ based on this biosynthetic pathway, which is a new perspective for the regulation of other secondary metabolites.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31450417>Sensitive quantitative analysis of phosphorylated primary metabolites using selective metal oxide enrichment and GC- and IC- MS/MS.</a></h1><p>In this study, we present a novel selective cleanup/enrichment method based on metal oxide solid phase extraction combined with quantitative gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and ion exchange chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for the analysis of phosphorylated metabolites in yeast cell extracts relevant to biotechnological processes. Following screening of several commercially available metal oxide-based enrichment materials, all steps of the enrichment process (loading, washing and elution) were optimized for both the selective enrichment of 12 phosphorylated compounds from the  and pentose phosphate pathways, and the simultaneous removal of highly abundant matrix components such as organic  and sugars. The full analytical workflow was then validated to meet the demands of accurate quantification of phosphorylated metabolites in yeast (Pichia pastoris) cell extracts using the best performing material and cleanup/enrichment method combined with quantification strategies based on internal standardization with isotopically labeled internal standards and external calibration. A good recovery (>70%) for 5 of the 12 targeted phosphorylated compounds with RSDs of less than 6.0% was obtained while many sugars, organic  and amino  were removed (>99% of glucose, and >95% of aspartate, succinate, glutamate, alanine, glycine, serine, threonine, proline, and valine). The use of isotopically labeled internal standards added to the samples prior to SPE, enables accurate quantification of the metabolites as it compensates for errors introduced during sample pretreatment and GC-MS or LC-MS analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an effective and selective metal oxide-based affinity chromatography cleanup/enrichment method was designed and applied successfully for intracellular phosphorylated metabolites.Copyright © 2019.

By contrast, certain small chemical compounds selected by high-throughput screening in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii can induce lipid accumulation during growth, maintaining biomass. Comprehensive pathway analyses using proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics data were acquired from Chlamydomonas cells grown in the presence of one of two structurally distinct lipid activators. WD10784 stimulates both starch and lipid accumulation, while WD30030-treated cells accumulate only lipids. The differences in starch accumulation are largely due to differential effects of the two compounds on substrate levels that feed into starch synthesis and on genes encoding starch metabolic enzymes. The compounds had differential effects on photosynthesis, respiration, and oxidative stress pathways. Cells treated with WD10784 showed slowed growth over time and reduced abundance of photosynthetic proteins, decreased respiration, and increased oxidative stress proteins, glutathione, and reactive oxygen species specific to this compound. Both compounds maintained central carbon and nitrogen metabolism, including the TCA cycle, , respiration, and the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle. There were few changes in proteins and transcripts related to fatty  biosynthesis, while proteins and transcripts for triglyceride production were elevated, suggesting that lipid synthesis is largely driven by substrate availability. This study reports that the compound WD30030 and, to a lesser extent WD10784, increases lipid and lipid droplet synthesis and storage without restricting growth or biomass accumulation by mechanisms that are substantially different from nutrient deprivation.{copyright, serif} 2019 American Society of Plant Biologists.

It is also a promising biopreservative with potential use in the food industry as it is a source of a novel bacteriocin (Plantacyclin B21AG) which has inhibitory effects against a wide range of species, including several pathogenic and spoilage strains. Nutrient stress is known to increase the survivability, storage stability, and bacteriocin production capability of  B21 during industrial processing. It is however, unknown what the underlying biochemical responses that control these abilities are. This study therefore investigates the metabolite profiles of  B21 using NMR spectroscopy and GC-MS to further understand the biochemical responses of this strain to various stress events. Unstressed cells were found to use glucose as their primary energy source with high concentrations of metabolites involved in  and organic  synthesis, such as lactic , acetic , propanoic , malic , and 2-butenedioic  being present in these cells. In contrast, large numbers of metabolites involved in amino  metabolism including alanine, glutamic , aspartic , valine, proline, and norleucine were upregulated in glucose stressed cells, indicating that they were using amino  as their main source of energy. Differences in levels of fatty , particularly octadecenoic , tetracosanoic , and 7-hexadecenoic  were also observed between stressed and unstressed cells.

Lysine acetylation is one of the most important reversible post-translational modifications and plays a vital regulatory role in various cellular processes. However, current information on the extent and function of lysine acetylation and aflatoxin biosynthesis in A. flavus is limited. Here, a global acetylome analysis of A. flavus was performed by peptide pre-fractionation, pan-acetylation antibody enrichment and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total of 1313 high-confidence acetylation sites in 727 acetylated proteins were identified in A. flavus. These acetylation proteins are widely involved in /gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate pathway, citric  cycle and aflatoxin biosynthesis. AflO (O-methyltransferase), a key enzyme in aflatoxin biosynthesis, was found to be acetylated at K241 and K384. Deletion of aflO not only impaired conidial and sclerotial developments, but also dramatically suppressed aflatoxin production and pathogenicity of A. flavus. Further site-specific mutations showed that lysine acetylation of AflO could also result in defects in development, aflatoxin production and pathogenicity, suggesting that acetylation plays a vital role in the regulation of the enzymatic activity of AflO in A. flavus. Our findings provide evidence for the involvement of lysine acetylation in various biological processes in A. flavus and facilitating in the elucidation of metabolic networks.© 2019 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31544066>KRAS-Driven Metabolic Rewiring Reveals Novel Actionable Targets in Cancer.</a></h1><p>Tumors driven by mutant KRAS are among the most aggressive and refractory to treatment. Unfortunately, despite the efforts, targeting alterations of this GTPase, either directly or by acting on the downstream signaling cascades, has been, so far, largely unsuccessful. However, recently, novel therapeutic opportunities are emerging based on the effect that this oncogenic lesion exerts in rewiring the cancer cell metabolism. Cancer cells that become dependent on KRAS-driven metabolic adaptations are sensitive to the inhibition of these metabolic routes, revealing novel therapeutic windows of intervention. In general, mutant KRAS fosters tumor growth by shifting cancer cell metabolism toward anabolic pathways. Depending on the tumor, KRAS-driven metabolic rewiring occurs by up-regulating rate-limiting enzymes involved in amino , fatty , or nucleotide biosynthesis, and by stimulating scavenging pathways such as macropinocytosis and autophagy, which, in turn, provide building blocks to the anabolic routes, also maintaining the energy levels and the cell redox potential (1). This review will discuss the most recent findings on mutant KRAS metabolic reliance in tumor models of pancreatic and non-small-cell lung cancer, also highlighting the role that these metabolic adaptations play in resistance to target therapy. The effects of constitutive KRAS activation in  elevation, amino  metabolism reprogramming, fatty  turnover, and nucleotide biosynthesis will be discussed also in the context of different genetic landscapes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31423200>Glucose metabolism changes during the development and progression of oral tongue squamous cell carcinomas.</a></h1><p>Previous studies have revealed several genes involved in the carcinogenesis of oral cancer. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. Previously, we established a database cataloging the transcriptional progression profile of oral carcinogenesis and identified several candidate genes with continuously increasing or decreasing expression, which specifically promote the transition of oral premalignant lesions to invasive carcinomas. In this study, using our microarray database, we attempted to determine significant genes that may contribute to metabolic alterations during oral carcinogenesis. After performing a literature survey, we focused on 15 candidate genes associated with glucose metabolism changes, particularly the tri-carboxylic  cycle, and investigated the mRNA-expression status of these genes with our database. Only the solute carrier family 2 member 1 gene (also known as GLUT1), showed significantly increased mRNA expression during oral tumorigenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that GLUT1 protein expression significantly increased during oral carcinogenesis. In addition, tumors with high expression of this protein significantly correlated with nodal status (P=0.002). Kaplan-Meier survival curves clearly demonstrated the adverse impact of high GLUT1 protein expression on disease-free survival (P=0.004). GLUT1 mRNA and protein expression increased in the order of normal mucosal tissues, epithelial dysplastic lesions and invasive carcinomas. Therefore, metabolic alterations, especially in glucose metabolism, occurred at the very early stage of development of oral malignancies. In addition, GLUT1 played a significant role in oral cancer, acquiring a malignant phenotype.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31470116>Engineering acetyl-CoA metabolic shortcut for eco-friendly production of polyketides triacetic  lactone in Yarrowia lipolytica.</a></h1><p>Acetyl-CoA is the central metabolic node connecting , Krebs cycle and fatty  synthase. Plant-derived polyketides, are assembled from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA, represent a large family of biological compounds with diversified bioactivity. Harnessing microbial bioconversion is considered as a feasible approach to large-scale production of polyketides from renewable feedstocks. Most of the current polyketide production platform relied on the lengthy glycolytic steps to provide acetyl-CoA, which inherently suffers from complex regulation with metabolically-costly cofactor/ATP requirements. Using the simplest polyketide triacetic  lactone (TAL) as a testbed molecule, we demonstrate that acetate uptake pathway in oleaginous yeast (Yarrowia lipolytica) could function as an acetyl-CoA shortcut to achieve metabolic optimality in producing polyketides. We identified the metabolic bottlenecks to rewire acetate utilization for efficient TAL production in Y. lipolytica, including generation of the driving force for acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA and NADPH. The engineered strain, with the overexpression of endogenous acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC1), malic enzyme (MAE1) and a bacteria-derived cytosolic pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), affords robust TAL production with titer up to 4.76 g/L from industrial glacier acetic  in shake flasks, representing 8.5-times improvement over the parental strain. The acetate-to-TAL conversion ratio (0.149 g/g) reaches 31.9% of the theoretical maximum yield. The carbon flux through this acetyl-CoA metabolic shortcut exceeds the carbon flux afforded by the native glycolytic pathways. Potentially, acetic  could be manufactured in large-quantity at low-cost from Syngas fermentation or heterogenous catalysis (methanol carbonylation). This alternative carbon sources present a metabolic advantage over glucose to unleash intrinsic pathway limitations and achieve high carbon conversion efficiency and cost-efficiency. This work also highlights that low-cost acetic  could be sustainably upgraded to high-value polyketides by oleaginous yeast species in an eco-friendly and cost-efficient manner.Copyright © 2019 International Metabolic Engineering Society.

For energy production, cancer cells may use 4 main fuels that are shuttled in 5 different metabolic pathways. Glucose fuels  that can be coupled to the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in oxidative cancer cells or to lactic fermentation in proliferating and in hypoxic cancer cells. Lipids fuel lipolysis, glutamine fuels glutaminolysis, and lactate fuels the oxidative pathway of lactate, all of which are coupled to the TCA cycle and OXPHOS for energy production. This review focuses on the latter metabolic pathway.Lactate, which is prominently produced by glycolytic cells in tumors, was only recently recognized as a major fuel for oxidative cancer cells and as a signaling agent. Its exchanges across membranes are gated by monocarboxylate transporters MCT1-4. This review summarizes the current knowledge about MCT structure, regulation and functions in cancer, with a specific focus on lactate metabolism, lactate-induced angiogenesis and MCT-dependent cancer metastasis. It also describes lactate signaling via cell surface lactate receptor GPR81.Lactate and MCTs, especially MCT1 and MCT4, are important contributors to tumor aggressiveness. Analyses of MCT-deficient (MCT and MCT) animals and (MCT-mutated) humans indicate that they are druggable, with MCT1 inhibitors being in advanced development phase and MCT4 inhibitors still in the discovery phase. Imaging lactate fluxes non-invasively using a lactate tracer for positron emission tomography would further help to identify responders to the treatments.Copyright © 2019.

SF2312 can only be synthesized as a racemic-diastereomeric mixture. However, co-crystal structures with Enolase 2 (ENO2) have consistently shown that only the (3,5)-enantiomer binds to the active site. The acidity of the alpha proton at C-3, which deprotonates under mildly alkaline conditions, results in racemization; thus while the separation of four enantiomeric intermediates was achieved via chiral High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) of the fully protected intermediate, deprotection inevitably nullified enantiopurity. To prevent epimerization of the C-3, we designed and synthesized MethylSF2312, ((1,5-dihydroxy-3-methyl-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl)phosphonic ), which contains a fully-substituted C-3 alpha carbon. As a racemic-diastereomeric mixture, MethylSF2312 is equipotent to SF2312 in enzymatic and cellular systems against Enolase. Chiral HPLC separation of a protected MethylSF2312 precursor resulted in the efficient separation of the four enantiomers. After deprotection and inevitable re-equilibration of the anomeric C-5, (3)-MethylSF2312 was up to 2000-fold more potent than (3)-MethylSF2312 in an isolated enzymatic assay. This observation strongly correlates with biological activity in both human cancer cells and bacteria for the 3 enantiomer of SF2312. Novel X-ray structures of human ENO2 with chiral and racemic MethylSF2312 show that only (35-enantiomer occupies the active site. Enolase inhibition is thus a direct result of binding by the (35-enantiomer of MethylSF2312. Concurrent with these results for MethylSF2312, we contend that the (3,5)-SF2312 is the single active enantiomer of inhibitor SF2312.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31417189>Acidity promotes tumour progression by altering macrophage phenotype in prostate cancer.</a></h1><p>Tumours rapidly ferment glucose to lactic  even in the presence of oxygen, and coupling high  with poor perfusion leads to extracellular acidification. We hypothesise that acidity, independent from lactate, can augment the pro-tumour phenotype of macrophages.We analysed publicly available data of human prostate cancer for linear correlation between macrophage markers and  genes. We used zwitterionic buffers to adjust the pH in series of in vitro experiments. We then utilised subcutaneous and transgenic tumour models developed in C57BL/6 mice as well as computer simulations to correlate tumour progression with macrophage infiltration and to delineate role of acidity.Activating macrophages at pH 6.8 in vitro enhanced an IL-4-driven phenotype as measured by gene expression, cytokine profiling, and functional assays. These results were recapitulated in vivo wherein neutralising intratumoural acidity reduced the pro-tumour phenotype of macrophages, while also decreasing tumour incidence and invasion in the TRAMP model of prostate cancer. These results were recapitulated using an in silico mathematical model that simulate macrophage responses to environmental signals. By turning off -induced cellular responses, our in silico mathematical modelling shows that -resistant macrophages can limit tumour progression.This study suggests that tumour acidity contributes to prostate carcinogenesis by altering the state of macrophage activation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31377432>Molecular cloning and modeling of the Tp53-induced  and apoptotic regulator (TIGAR) from the Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei and its expression in response to hypoxia.</a></h1><p>Hypoxia is a common stressor for aquaculture species. The Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei survives low dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions by adjusting its energy metabolism. In vertebrates, the transcription factor p53 regulates glucose metabolism under stress through diverse target genes like the Tp53-induced  and apoptotic regulator (TIGAR), a protein similar to fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase that has a pro-survival role in cells participating in the defense against oxidative damage. Until now, TIGAR has been not reported in any invertebrate species, including crustaceans. In this work, we report the molecular cloning of the white shrimp TIGAR. The cDNA sequence is 765 bp encoding a 254 amino  protein. Bioinformatics analyses predicted that although the overall sequence identities of L. vannamei TIGAR and vertebrate proteins are not very high (33.61%-35.34%), they have a remarkable predicted structural similarity with full conservation of catalytic residues, secondary and three-dimensional structures. Gene expression analysis by RT-qPCR revealed that the mRNA abundance of TIGAR in white shrimp is tissue-specific under normal oxygen conditions, with higher expression in gills than hepatopancreas and muscle. Also, gene expression in gills and hepatopancreas is modified by environmental hypoxia, suggesting that TIGAR participates in the cellular tolerance of L. vannamei to this stressor.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

It is established that systemic bioenergetic dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension classified as World Health Organization (WHO) Group 1. Consistent with this, we previously showed that platelets from Group 1 PH patients demonstrate increased  and enhanced maximal capacity for oxidative phosphorylation, which is due to increased fatty  oxidation (FAO). However, it remains unclear whether identical mitochondrial alterations contribute to the pathology of other PH subgroups. The most prevalent subgroup of PH is WHO Group 2, which encompasses pulmonary venous hypertension secondary to left heart disease. Here, we hypothesized that platelets from Group 2 subjects show bioenergetic alteration compared to controls, and that these changes were similar to Group 1 PH patients.We isolated platelets from subjects with Group 2 PH and controls (n = 20) and measured platelet bioenergetics as well as hemodynamic parameters. We demonstrate that Group 2 PH platelets do not show a change in glycolytic rate but do demonstrate enhanced maximal capacity of respiration due at least partially to increased FAO. Moreover, this enhanced maximal capacity correlates negatively with right ventricular stroke work index and is not changed by administration of inhaled nitrite, a modulator of pulmonary hemodynamics.These data demonstrate that Group 2 PH subjects have altered bioenergetic function though this alteration is not identical to that of Group 1 PH.

A recently described mammalian protein called MSS51 is significantly downregulated with myostatin inhibition. In vitro disruption of Mss51 results in increased levels of ATP, β-oxidation, , and oxidative phosphorylation. To determine the in vivo biological function of Mss51 in mice, we disrupted the Mss51 gene by CRISPR/Cas9 and found that Mss51-KO mice have normal muscle weights and fiber-type distribution but reduced fat pads. Myofibers isolated from Mss51-KO mice showed an increased oxygen consumption rate compared with WT controls, indicating an accelerated rate of skeletal muscle metabolism. The expression of genes related to oxidative phosphorylation and fatty  β-oxidation were enhanced in skeletal muscle of Mss51-KO mice compared with that of WT mice. We found that mice lacking Mss51 and challenged with a high-fat diet were resistant to diet-induced weight gain, had increased whole-body glucose turnover and  rate, and increased systemic insulin sensitivity and fatty  β-oxidation. These findings demonstrate that MSS51 modulates skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration and regulates whole-body glucose and fatty  metabolism, making it a potential target for obesity and diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629815>Crucial Players in : Cancer Progress.</a></h1><p>Cancer is the second most important cause of death and new therapy modalities continue to be developed and evolved.

Yet little is known on how systematic shifts in metabolic networks depend on age and AD. In this work, we investigated the global metabolomic alterations in non-transgenic (NTg) and triple-transgenic (3xTg-AD) mouse brain hippocampus as a function of age by using untargeted Ultrahigh Performance Liquid Chromatography-tandem Mass Spectroscopy (UPLC-MS/MS). We observed common metabolic patterns with aging in both NTg and 3xTg-AD brains involved in energy-generating pathways, fatty  oxidation, glutamate, and sphingolipid metabolism. We found age-related downregulation of metabolites from reactions in  that consumed ATP and in the TCA cycle, especially at NAD+/NADH-dependent redox sites, where age- and AD-associated limitations in the free NADH may alter reactions. Conversely, metabolites increased in glycolytic reactions in which ATP is produced. With age, inputs to the TCA cycle were increased including fatty  β-oxidation and glutamine. Overall age- and AD-related changes were > 2-fold when comparing the declines of upstream metabolites of NAD+/NADH-dependent reactions to the increases of downstream metabolites (p = 10-5, n = 8 redox reactions). Inflammatory metabolites such as ceramides and sphingosine-1-phosphate also increased with age. Age-related decreases in glutamate, GABA, and sphingolipid were seen which worsened with AD genetic load in 3xTg-AD brains, possibly contributing to synaptic, learning- and memory-related deficits. The data support the novel hypothesis that age- and AD-associated metabolic shifts respond to NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H redox-dependent reactions, which may contribute to decreased energetic capacity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555797>Reversal of the Warburg phenomenon in chemoprevention of prostate cancer by sulforaphane.</a></h1><p>Inhibition of metabolic re-programming represents an attractive approach for prevention of prostate cancer. Studies have implicated increased synthesis of fatty  or  in pathogenesis of human prostate cancers. We have shown previously that prostate cancer prevention by sulforaphane (SFN) in Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) model is associated with inhibition of fatty  metabolism. This study utilized human prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, 22Rv1, and PC-3), two different transgenic mouse models (TRAMP and Hi-Myc), and plasma specimens from a clinical study to explore the  inhibition potential of SFN. We found that SFN treatment: (a) decreased real-time extracellular acidification rate in LNCaP, but not in PC-3 cell line ; (b) significantly downregulated expression of hexokinase II (HKII), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), and/or lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) in vitro in cells and in vivo in neoplastic lesions in the prostate of TRAMP and Hi-Myc mice; and (c) significantly suppressed  in prostate of Hi-Myc mice as measured by ex vivo1 H magnetic resonance spectroscopy. SFN treatment did not decrease glucose uptake or expression of glucose transporters in cells. Overexpression of c-Myc, but not constitutively active Akt, conferred protection against SFN-mediated downregulation of HKII and LDHA protein expression and suppression of lactate levels. Examination of plasma lactate levels in prostate cancer patients following administration of a SFN-rich broccoli sprout extract failed to show declines in its levels. Additional clinical trials are needed to determine whether SFN treatment can decrease lactate production in human prostate tumors.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press.

Because individuals with DS almost universally develop heavy amyloid burden and Alzheimer's disease (AD), biomarker discovery in this population may be extremely fruitful. Moreover, any AD biomarker in DS that does not directly involve amyloid pathology may be of high value for understanding broader mechanisms of AD generalizable to the neurotypical population. In this retrospective biomarker discovery study, we examined banked peripheral plasma samples from 78 individuals with DS who met clinical criteria for AD at the time of the blood draw (DS-AD) and 68 individuals with DS who did not (DS-NAD). We measured the relative abundance of approximately 5,000 putative features in the plasma using untargeted mass spectrometry (MS). We found significantly higher levels of a peak putatively annotated as lactic  in the DS-AD group (q = .014), a finding confirmed using targeted MS (q = .011). Because lactate is the terminal product of  and subsequent lactic  fermentation, we performed additional targeted MS focusing on central carbon metabolism which revealed significantly increased levels of pyruvic (q = .03) and methyladipic (q = .03)  in addition to significantly lower levels of uridine (q = .007) in the DS-AD group. These data suggest that AD in DS is accompanied by a shift from aerobic respiration toward the less efficient fermentative metabolism and that bioenergetically derived metabolites observable in peripheral blood may be useful for detecting this shift.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31455352>Cardamonin inhibits breast cancer growth by repressing HIF-1α-dependent metabolic reprogramming.</a></h1><p>Cardamonin, a chalcone isolated from Alpiniae katsumadai, has anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor activities. However, the molecular mechanism by which cardamonin inhibits breast cancer progression largely remains to be determined.CCK-8 and Hoechst 33258 staining were used to detect cell growth and apoptosis, respectively. HIF-1α driven transcription was measured by luciferase reporter assay. Glucose uptake and lactate content were detected with 2-NBDG and L-Lactate Assay Kit. Cell metabolism assays were performed on Agilent's Seahorse Bioscience XF96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer. Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured with JC-1 probe. DCFH-DA was used to measure ROS level. Protein expression was detected by western blotting assay. Immunohistochemistry was performed to measure the expression of HIF-1α, LDHA and CD31 in tumor tissues.Cardamonin inhibited growth of the triple negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 in vitro and in vivo by suppressing HIF-1α mediated cell metabolism. Cardamonin inhibited the expression of HIF-1α at mRNA and protein levels by repressing the mTOR/p70S6K pathway, and subsequently enhanced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. We also found that cardamonin inhibited the Nrf2-dependent ROS scavenging system which further increased intracellular ROS levels. Eventually, accumulation of the intracellular ROS induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells. In addition, cardamonin treatment reduced glucose uptake as well as lactic  production and efflux, suggesting its function in repressing the  process.These results reveal novel function of cardamonin in modulating cancer cell metabolism and suppressing breast cancer progression, and suggest its potential for breast cancer treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31377155>Beneficial effects of Oridonin on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury: Insight gained by metabolomic approaches.</a></h1><p>Oridonin is a diterpenoid isolated from Rabdosia rubescens (Hemsl.) Hara, a well-known herbal tea in China with many health benefits. To provide a better understanding of the potential cardioprotective effect of Oridonin, we investigated the metabolic alterations in heart tissue and serum of rat subjected to myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury with or without pretreatment of Oridonin by UPLC-MS/MS metabolomics approach. Rats were randomly divided into groups as follows: Control, Sham, MI/R and pretreated with Oridonin (10 mg/kg)+MI/R. After 24 h of reperfusion, heart tissue and serum were collected for biochemical and metabolomic analysis. Pretreatment with Oridonin significantly decreased infarct size and reversed the abnormal elevated myocardial zymogram in serum. Moreover, Oridonin regulated several metabolic pathways, including , branched chain amino , kynurenine, arginine, glutamine and bile  metabolism. Our results suggest that Oridonin indeed displays outstanding cardioprotective effect mainly by regulating energy and amino  metabolism.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Mitochondria are important mediators of metabolic flexibility and dysfunction is associated with metabolic inflexibility and pathology. Foodborne toxins are often overlooked as potential factors contributing to metabolic toxicity. Fusaric  (FA), a neglected mycotoxin, is known to disrupt mitochondrial function. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying a metabolic switch in response to FA. This study investigated the effects of FA on energy homeostasis in cultured human liver (HepG2) cells. HepG2 cells poised to undergo oxidative and glycolytic metabolism were exposed to a range of FA concentrations (4, 63 and 250 µg/mL) for 6 hours. We determined mitochondrial toxicity, acetyl CoA levels and cell viability using luminometric, fluorometric and spectrophotometric methods. Expression of metabolic proteins (PDK1, PKM2, phosphorylated-PDH E1α and HIF-1α) and mRNAs (HIF-1α, PKM2, LDHa and PDK1) were determined using western blot and qPCR respectively. Our data connects a constitutive expression of HIF-1α in response to FA, to the inhibition of pyruvate decarboxylation through up-regulation of PDK-1 and phosphorylation of Pyruvate Dehydrogenase E1α subunit. Moreover, we highlight the potential of FA to induce a glucose "addiction" and phenotype reminiscent of the Warburg effect. The findings provide novel insights into the impact of this neglected foodborne mycotoxin in the dysregulation of energy metabolism.Copyright © 2019.

Raw microarray data collected from these exposures were further analyzed using bioinformatic tools to generate a differentially expressed genes (DEGs) dataset associated with hepatic lipid dysfunction. Further analysis of the DEGs dataset resulted in 324 upregulated genes, and 275 genes that were down regulated. Meanwhile, 36 genes were either up regulated or down regulated in different chemical treatments. All identified genes were uploaded in the web application for Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) for gene ontology enrichments and to identify Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) pathways. Some of the identified pathways included /gluconeogenesis, steroid hormone biosynthesis, retinol metabolism, and metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450. The same DEGs dataset was also analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. IPA identified several pathways including PXR/RXR activation, Aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling, and xenobiotic metabolism signaling. Furthermore, the generated DEGs lists were uploaded into NCATS BioPlanet platform. Some of the identified pathways were related to fatty  omega oxidation, lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, and adipogenesis. The enrichment and clarification of the pathways and biological networks obtained from the DEGs dataset provide prior knowledge on the underlying biological key events and molecular mechanisms for the computational development of putative adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) for hepatic lipid dysfunction as a precursor to hepatic steatosis.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31522044>Comparative metatranscriptomic profiling and microRNA sequencing to reveal active metabolic pathways associated with a dinoflagellate bloom.</a></h1><p>Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have increased as a result of global climate and environmental changes, exerting increasing impacts on the aquatic ecosystem, coastal economy, and human health. Despite great research efforts, our understanding on the drivers of HABs is still limited in part because HAB species' physiology is difficult to probe in situ. Here, we used molecular ecological analyses to characterize a dinoflagellate bloom at Xiamen Harbor, China. Prorocentrum donghaiense was identified as the culprit, which nutrient bioassays showed were not nutrient-limited. Metatranscriptome profiling revealed that P. donghaiense highly expressed genes related to N- and P-nutrient uptake, phagotrophy, energy metabolism (photosynthesis, oxidative phophorylation, and rhodopsin) and carbohydrate metabolism (/gluconeogenesis, TCA cycle and pentose phosphate) during the bloom. Many genes in P. donghaiense were up-regulated at night, including phagotrophy and environmental communication genes, and showed active expression in mitosis. Eight microbial defense genes were up-regulated in the bloom compared with previously analyzed laboratory cultures. Furthermore, 76 P. donghaiense microRNA were identified from the bloom, and their target genes exhibited marked differences in amino  metabolism between the bloom and cultures and the potential of up-regulated antibiotic and cell communication capabilities. These findings, consistent with and complementary to recent reports, reveal major metabolic processes in P. donghaiense potentially important for bloom formation and provide a gene repertoire for developing bloom markers in future research.Copyright © 2018.

Neutrophils were traditionally considered transcriptionally inactive cells, but recent researches in the field led to a paradigm shift in neutrophil biology and revealed subpopulation heterogeneity, and functions pivotal to immunity and inflammation. Furthermore, recent unfolding of metabolic plasticity in neutrophils has challenged the long-standing concept of their sole dependence on glycolytic pathway. Metabolic adaptations and distinct regulations have been identified which are critical for neutrophil differentiation and functions. The metabolic reprogramming of neutrophils by inflammatory mediators or during pathologies such as sepsis, diabetes, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, glycogen storage diseases (GSDs), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer are now being explored. In this review, we discuss recent developments in understanding of the metabolic regulation, that may provide clues for better management and newer therapeutic opportunities for neutrophil centric immuno-deficiencies and inflammatory disorders.Copyright © 2019 Kumar and Dikshit.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554111>Comparison of metabolic response between the planktonic and air-dried Escherichia coli to electrolysed water combined with ultrasound by H NMR spectroscopy.</a></h1><p>The antimicrobial effects of electrolysed water and ultrasound have been well reported; however, little attention was paid to their effects on the metabolite changes of bacteria in different states. In this study, the metabolomic variations of Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 in planktonic and adherent state (air-dried on stainless steel coupons) after the combination treatment of low-concentration acidic electrolysed water (AEW, free available chlorine (FAC): 4 mg/L) and ultrasound were characterised, by conducting multivariate data analysis based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Overall, 43 metabolites were identified in two states of E. coli, including a wide range of amino , organic , nucleotides and their derivatives. The quantification of whole-cell metabolism in planktonic and air-dried cultures was quite different: air-dried E. coli exhibited more resistance to ultrasound and AEW treatments due to initiating a protective response against oxidative and  stresses, which was not observed in planktonic E. coli, whose levels of all identified metabolites were decreased significantly after the combined treatment. Further pathway analysis revealed that alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, , pyruvate metabolism and tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle were changed significantly in planktonic culture, but to a less extent in air-dried culture, in which some shifts in glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) system and some shunts like mixed  fermentation and pentose phosphate pathway were observed for maintaining metabolic balance. These findings suggest that NMR-based metabolomics strategy is promising in identifying different metabolic shifts in different states of bacteria. They also provide some guidance for food equipment sanitisation, especially for organic food processing.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Proliferating cells tend to have higher metabolic rates, and their metabolic profiles facilitate biosynthesis, as compared to those of nondividing cells of the same sort. Recent studies have elucidated specific molecules that control metabolic changes while cells shift between proliferation and quiescence. Embryonic stem cells, which are rapidly proliferating, tend to have metabolic patterns that are similar to those of nonstem cells in a proliferative state. Moreover, although adult stem cells tend to be quiescent, their metabolic profiles have been reported in multiple organs to more closely resemble those of proliferating than those of nondividing cells in some respects. The findings raise questions about whether there are metabolic profiles that are required for stemness, and whether these profiles relate to the metabolic properties that may be required for quiescence. Here, we review the literature on how metabolism changes upon commitment to proliferation and compare the proliferating and nonproliferating metabolic states of differentiated cells and embryonic and adult stem cells.© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652719>Peroxiredoxin 6 Down-Regulation Induces Metabolic Remodeling and Cell Cycle Arrest in HepG2 Cells.</a></h1><p>Peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx6) is the only member of 1-Cys subfamily of peroxiredoxins in human cells. It is the only Prdx acting on phospholipid hydroperoxides possessing two additional sites with phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and lysophosphatidylcholine-acyl transferase (LPCAT) activities. There are contrasting reports on the roles and mechanisms of multifunctional Prdx6 in several pathologies and on its sensitivity to, and influence on, the redox environment. We have down-regulated Prdx6 with specific siRNA in hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells to study its role in cell proliferation, redox homeostasis, and metabolic programming. Cell proliferation and cell number decreased while cell volume increased; import of glucose and nucleotide biosynthesis also diminished while polyamines, phospholipids, and most glycolipids increased. A proteomic quantitative analysis suggested changes in membrane arrangement and vesicle trafficking as well as redox changes in enzymes of carbon and glutathione metabolism, pentose-phosphate pathway, citrate cycle, fatty  metabolism, biosynthesis of aminoacids, and /Gluconeogenesis. Specific redox changes in Hexokinase-2 (HK2), Prdx6, intracellular chloride ion channel-1 (CLIC1), PEP-carboxykinase-2 (PCK2), and 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) are compatible with the metabolic remodeling toward a predominant gluconeogenic flow from aminoacids with diversion at 3-phospohglycerate toward serine and other biosynthetic pathways thereon and with cell cycle arrest at G1/S transition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31334125>Topical Diclofenac Reprograms Metabolism and Immune Cell Infiltration in Actinic Keratosis.</a></h1><p> Melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin are characterized by an altered glucose metabolism, but little is known about metabolic changes in precancerous skin lesions such as actinic keratosis (AK). Here, we studied the central carbon metabolism and immune cell infiltrate of actinic keratosis lesions before, under, and 4 weeks after treatment with topical diclofenac (Solaraze®).  This study was designed as a prospective, randomized, controlled, monocentric investigation (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: ). Myeloid and T cell infiltration was analyzed in skin biopsies from 28 patients by immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, immune cell activation was determined via quantitative real-time PCR (γ, IL-10, β). Glucose, amino  and Krebs' cycle metabolism was studied by mass spectrometry prior, during and after treatment with topical diclofenac. Biopsies from sun-exposed, untreated, healthy skin served as controls.  Increased lactate and decreased glucose levels suggested accelerated  in pre-treatment AK. Further, levels of Krebs' cycle intermediates other than citrate and amino  were elevated. Analysis of the immune infiltrate revealed less epidermal CD1a+ cells but increased frequencies of dermal CD8+ T cells in AK. Treatment with diclofenac reduced lactate and amino  levels in AK, especially in responding lesions, and induced an infiltration of dermal CD8+ T cells accompanied by high γ mRNA expression, suggesting improved T cell function.  Our study clearly demonstrated that not only cancers but also pre-malignant skin lesions, like AK, exhibit profound changes in metabolism, correlating with an altered immune infiltrate. Diclofenac normalizes metabolism, immune cell infiltration and function in AK lesions, suggesting a novel mechanism of action.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657265>Metabolic Remodeling in the Pressure-Loaded Right Ventricle: Shifts in Glucose and Fatty  Metabolism-A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.</a></h1><p>Background Right ventricular (RV) failure because of chronic pressure load is an important determinant of outcome in pulmonary hypertension. Progression towards RV failure is characterized by diastolic dysfunction, fibrosis and metabolic dysregulation. Metabolic modulation has been suggested as therapeutic option, yet, metabolic dysregulation may have various faces in different experimental models and disease severity. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to identify metabolic changes in the pressure loaded RV and formulate recommendations required to optimize translation between animal models and human disease. Methods and Results Medline and EMBASE were searched to identify original studies describing cardiac metabolic variables in the pressure loaded RV. We identified mostly rat-models, inducing pressure load by hypoxia, Sugen-hypoxia, monocrotaline (MCT), pulmonary artery banding (PAB) or strain (fawn hooded rats, FHR), and human studies. Meta-analysis revealed increased Hedges' g (effect size) of the gene expression of GLUT1 and HK1 and glycolytic flux. The expression of MCAD was uniformly decreased. Mitochondrial respiratory capacity and fatty  uptake varied considerably between studies, yet there was a model effect in carbohydrate respiratory capacity in MCT-rats. Conclusions This systematic review and meta-analysis on metabolic remodeling in the pressure-loaded RV showed a consistent increase in glucose uptake and , strongly suggest a downregulation of beta-oxidation, and showed divergent and model-specific changes regarding fatty  uptake and oxidative metabolism. To translate metabolic results from animal models to human disease, more extensive characterization, including function, and uniformity in methodology and studied variables, will be required.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31513460>Systematic Review: Clinical Metabolomics to Forecast Outcomes in Liver Transplantation Surgery.</a></h1><p>Liver transplantation is an effective intervention for end-stage liver disease, fulminant hepatic failure, and early hepatocellular carcinoma. Yet, there is marked patient-to-patient variation in liver transplantation outcomes. This calls for novel diagnostics to enable rational deployment of donor livers. Metabolomics is a postgenomic high-throughput systems biology approach to diagnostic innovation in clinical medicine. We report here an original systematic review of the metabolomic studies that have identified putative biomarkers in the context of liver transplantation. Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria that involved sampling of blood ( = 4), dialysate fluid ( = 4), bile ( = 5), and liver tissue ( = 5). Metabolites of amino  and nitrogen metabolism, anaerobic , lipid breakdown products, and bile  metabolism were significantly different in transplanted livers with and without graft dysfunction. However, criteria for defining the graft dysfunction varied across studies. This systematic review demonstrates that metabolomics can be deployed in identification of metabolic indicators of graft dysfunction with a view to implicated molecular mechanisms. We conclude the article with a horizon scanning of metabolomics technology in liver transplantation and its future prospects and challenges in research and clinical practice.</p></html>
