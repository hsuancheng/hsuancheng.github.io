<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10203155>Profile of urinary bile  in infants and children: developmental pattern of excretion of unsaturated ketonic bile  and 7beta-hydroxylated bile .</a></h2><p>Unusual bile , such as unsaturated ketonic and 7beta-hydroxylated bile , have been detected in urine early in life. To elucidate the normal profiles of usual and unusual urinary bile  in the neonatal and pediatric periods, we measured the concentrations of 28 kinds in urine from normal newborns, infants, and children by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The mean total bile /Cr ratio in 7-d-old infants was significantly higher than in subjects of other age groups (birth, 2-4 mo, 5-7 mo, 11-12 mo, 2-3 y, 9- y, and adult) (p < 0.05). Relatively large amounts of unusual bile  were detected during infancy, especially during the period up to 1 mo of age. At that time, 1beta,,7alpha,12alpha-tetrahydroxy-5bet a-cholan-24-oic, 7alpha, 12alpha-dihydroxy-3-oxo-5beta-chol-1-, and 7alpha,12alpha-dihydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholen-24-oic  were predominant among the unusual urinary bile  present. Moreover, the levels of ,7beta,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholan+ ++-24-oic  increased significantly after 2-4 mo of age. These results indicate that bile  synthesis and  in the liver of developing infants are significantly different from that occurring in the liver of adults. Significant amounts of urinary isomerized 7beta-hydroxylated bile  were detected after late infancy, probably because of changes in the intestinal bacterial flora response to a change in nutrition. We describe, for the first time, evidence of the epimerization of the 7alpha-hydroxyl group of cholic , which may be unique to human development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12141856>Natural products inhibiting Candida albicans secreted aspartic proteases from Lycopodium cernuum.</a></h2><p>Activity-guided fractionation of an ethanol extract of Lycopodium cernuum for Candida albicans secreted aspartic proteases (SAP) inhibition resulted in the identification of six new (1-6) and four known (7-10) serratene triterpenes, along with the known apigenin-4'-O-(2' ',6' '-di-O-p-coumaroyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (11). On the basis of spectroscopic analysis, the structures of 1-10 were established as 3beta,14alpha,15alpha,21beta,29-pentahydroxyserratane-24-oic  (lycernuic  C, 1), 3beta,14alpha,15alpha,21beta-tetrahydroxyserratane-24-oic  (lycernuic  D, 2), 3beta,14beta,21beta-trihydroxyserratane-24-oic  (lycernuic  E, 3), 3beta,21beta,29-trihydroxy-16-oxoserrat--en-24-methyl ester (lycernuic ketone A, 4), ,21beta,29-trihydroxy-16-oxoserrat--en-24-methyl ester (lycernuic ketone B, 5), ,21beta,24-trihydroxyserrat--en-16-one (lycernuic ketone C, 6), 3beta,21beta-dihydroxyserrat--  (lycernuic  A, 7), 3beta,21beta,29-trihydroxyserrat--  (lycernuic  B, 8), serrat--en-3beta,21beta-diol (9), and serrat--en-3beta,21alpha-diol (10). The 13C NMR data for the known compounds 7 and 8 are reported for the first time. Compounds 1 and 11 showed inhibitory effects against C. albicans secreted aspartic proteases (SAP) with IC50 of 20 and 8.5 microg/mL, respectively, while the other compounds were inactive.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4472430>-hydroxy-5beta-chol-11 - , a new fungal metabolite.</a></h2><p></p></html>
