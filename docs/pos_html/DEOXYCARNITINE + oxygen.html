TMA found in humans is exclusively of bacterial origin, and its metabolite, trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), has been associated with atherosclerosis and heart and renal failure. We isolated four different Rieske oxygenases and determined that there are no significant differences in their substrate panels. All three had high activity toward carnitine/, medium activity toward glycine betaine, and very low activity toward choline. We tested the influence of low  concentrations on TMA production in CntA-containing Providencia rettgeri cell cultures and discovered that this process, although dependent on the amount of , is still feasible in environments with 1 and 0.2% , which is comparable to  levels in some parts of the digestive system.© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Bovine superoxide dismutase and the Mn(2+)-containing superoxide dismutase from Escherichia coli were not inhibitory. Superoxide anion generated from xanthine/xanthine oxidase was not stimulatory and could not replace ascorbate. Thymine 7-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.6) and thymidine 2'-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.3) were not inhibited by erythrocyte superoxide dismutase or stimulated by superoxide anion.  hydroxylase was inhibited by a number of low-molecular-weight compounds, such as tetranitromethane, Nitro Blue Tetrazolium, adrenaline and Tiron, which may act as scavengers of superoxide anion. Involvement of this radical in other oxygenase reactions has been inferred from the findings that they were inhibitory for the respective enzymes. Several of these compounds also inhibited  hydroxylase. It could be concluded from these experiments, however, that mechanisms other than disposal of superoxide anion might equally well be operative, such as hydrophobic interaction with the enzyme protein and interaction with compounds required for full enzymic activity, e.g. iron and ascorbate. The results appear to rule out a requirement for superoxide anion generated in free solution, and have not yielded evidence for participation of enzyme-bound superoxide anion in 2-oxoglutarate-dependent hydroxylations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7156861> hydroxylase in human kidney.</a></h2><p>The activity of  hydroxylase [4-trimethylaminobutyrate:  oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating), EC 1.14.11.1] was determined in different parts of a human kidney removed at surgery and in five perfused human cadaver kidneys. The activity in the 100,000 g supernatant fraction of a homogenate of whole kidneys was 48 nkat X g-1 protein (range 32-70 nkat X g-1protein). The cortex and outer medulla had four to six times higher activity than the inner medulla. A 60-fold purification from the soluble fraction of kidney homogenates with a 40% recovery was achieved by ammonium sulphate fractionation followed by DEAE-cellulose and hydroxylapatite chromatography. The enzyme had a specific activity of 2.4 mukat X g-1 protein but was contaminated to a minor degree by other proteins as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The Km values for , 2-oxoglutarate and  were 0.2 mmol/l, 0.3 mmol/l and 5.5% (by volume in the gas phase). There was an absolute requirement for ferrous ion. Half-maximal activity was reached with 10 mumol/l of Fe2+ in phosphate buffer (14 mmol/l) at pH 6.5. With a reaction time of 30 min ascorbate and catalase stimulated the reaction seven- and fivefold, respectively. Optimal pH value for the reaction was 6.2-6.5 in phosphate buffer. Decarboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate in the presence of 4-trimethylaminocrotonate or 4-dimethylaminobutyrate was 40 and 20%, respectively, of that with  as substrate. None of several compounds chemically related to 2-oxoglutarate, including oxaloacetate, stimulated  hydroxylation when tested in the absence of 2-oxoglutarate. We conclude that the requirements of the human kidney enzyme are similar to those previously reported for this enzyme from other sources.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2351954>Uptake of glycine betaine and its analogues by bacteroids of Rhizobium meliloti.</a></h2><p>Bacteroids isolated from alfalfa nodules induced by Rhizobium meliloti 102F34 transported glycine betaine at a constant rate for up to 30 min. Addition of sodium salts greatly increased the uptake activity, whereas other salts or non-electrolytes had less effect. The apparent Km for glycine betaine uptake was 8.3 microM and V was about 0.84 nmol min-1 (mg protein)-1 in the presence of 200 mM-NaCl which gave maximum stimulation of the transport. Supplementing bacteroid suspensions with various energy-yielding substrates, or ATP, did not increase glycine betaine uptake rates. The uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), and the respiratory inhibitor potassium cyanide strongly inhibited glycine betaine uptake, but arsenate was totally inactive. Glycine betaine transport showed considerable structural specificity: choline, proline betaine,  and trigonelline did not competitively inhibit the system, although choline and proline betaine were transported by bacteroids. Both a high-affinity activity and a low-affinity activity were found for choline uptake. These osmoprotective compounds might have a significant role in the maintenance of nitrogenase activity in bacteroids subjected to salt stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21439360>The disruption of L-carnitine  by aluminum toxicity and oxidative stress promotes dyslipidemia in human astrocytic and hepatic cells.</a></h2><p>L-Carnitine is a critical metabolite indispensable for the  of lipids as it facilitates fatty acid transport into the mitochondrion where β-oxidation occurs. Human astrocytes (CCF-STTG1 cells) and hepatocytes (HepG2 cells) exposed to aluminum (Al) and hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), were characterized with lower levels of L-carnitine, diminished β-oxidation, and increased  accumulation compared to the controls. γ-Butyrobetainealdehyde dehydrogenase (BADH) and butyrobetaine dioxygenase (BBDOX), two key enzymes mediating the biogenesis of L-carnitine, were sharply reduced during Al and H₂O₂ challenge. Exposure of the Al and H₂O₂-treated cells to α-ketoglutarate (KG), led to the recovery of L-carnitine production with the concomitant reduction in ROS levels. It appears that the channeling of KG to combat oxidative stress results in decreased L-carnitine synthesis, an event that contributes to the dyslipidemia observed during Al and H₂O₂ insults in these mammalian cells. Hence, KG may help alleviate pathological conditions induced by oxidative stress.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The preparation was homogeneous as judged from electrophoresis in agarose and polyacrylamide gels, isoelectric focusing, and equilibrium sedimentation. The molecular mass was 95 kdaltons as determined by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation. From electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel the molecular mass was estimated to 92 kdaltons, from gel filtration through columns of Sephadex G-200 to 86 kdaltons, and from gel filtration through thin layers of Sephadex G-150 and G-200 to 82 kdaltons. Calculation of molecular mass from Stokes radius, sedimentation coefficient, and partial specific volume gave a value of 96 kdaltons, and from the sedimentation coefficient, 93 kdaltons. Gel filtration through Sephadex G-200 in 6 M guanidinium chloride and electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel containing 3.5 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate resulted in single bands with mobilities corresponding to molecular masses of 39 and 37 kdaltons, respectively, indicating that the enzyme is composed of two polypeptides chains with similar size. NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing in three cycles resulted in two amino acids in each cycle (Ala + Asn, Ala + Ile, Ala + Ile). The Stokes radius was 3.8 nm, corresponding to a diffusion coefficient of 5.7 X 10(-7) cm2/s. A sedimentation coefficient of 5.8 X 10(-13) s and a frictional ratio of 1.26 was found. The partial specific volume was 0.729 mL/g at 20 degrees C as calculated from amino acid analysis. The isoelectric point was 5.1, as determined by isoelectric focusing analysis. The light absorption in the ultraviolet and visible regions was that of a protein without light-absorbing prosthetic groups. The absorption coefficient at 280 nm of a 1.0% solution at pH 6.5 was 12.6. Amino acid analysis by ion-exchange chromatography showed a half-cystine content of 19 mol per 95 kg of protein (23 residues/1000). Thirteen sulfhydryl groups were found by colorimetric analysis before as well as after reduction with NaBH4, indicating absence of disulfide bonds. Less than 0.1 mol of iron was found per mol of enzyme.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7463087>The uptake of carnitine by slices of rat cerebral cortex.</a></h2><p>The properties of carnitine transport were studied in rat brain slices. A rapid uptake system for carnitine was observed, with tissue-medium gradients of 38 +/- 3 for L-[14CH3]carnitine and 27 +/- 3 for D-[14CH3]carnitine after 180 min incubation at 37 degrees C in 0.64 mM substrate. Uptake of L- and D-carnitine showed saturability. The estimated values of Km for L- and D-carnitine were 2.85 mM and 10.0 mM, respectively; but values of Vmax (1 mumol/min/ml intracellular fluid) were the same for the two isomers. The transport system showed stereospecificity for L-carnitine. Carnitine uptake was inhibited by structurally related compounds with a four-carbon backbone containing a terminal carboxyl group. L-Carnitine uptake was competitively inhibited by  (Ki = 3.22 mM), acetylcarnitine (Ki = 6.36 mM), and gamma-aminobutyric acid (Ki = 0.63 mM). The data suggest that carnitine and gamma-aminobutyric acid interact at a common carrier site. Transport was not significantly reduced by choline or lysine. Carnitine uptake was inhibited by an N2 atmosphere, 2,4-dinitrophenol, carbonylcyanide-N-chlorophenylhydrazone, potassium cyanide, n-ethylmaleimide, and ouabain. Transport was abolished by low temperature (4 degrees C) and absence of glucose from the medium.

After further chromatography on an anion-exchanger, each form appeared as a single band on electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel containing sodium dodecyl sulphate. The isoelectric points of isoenzymes 1, 2 and 3 were 5.6, 5.7 and 5.8 respectively, as estimated by isoelectric focusing. Their specific activities were 17-29 mu kat/g of protein. The concentrations of the three isoenzymes were about equal, possibly slightly lower for isoenzyme 1. The requirement for Fe2+ and the Km values for  and 2-oxoglutarate were about the same for the different enzyme forms. L- and D-Carnitine caused decarboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate to the same extent (8 and 29%) with the three forms. The enzyme forms had the same mass, 64 kDa, as determined by gel filtration in nondenaturing media. The same subunit mass, 42 kDa, was obtained for the multiple forms by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulphate. Isoenzyme 2 was resolved into two protein bands by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gels containing urea. Isoenzyme 1 contained only one of these bands and isoenzyme 3 the other. The three enzyme forms of  hydroxylase thus appear to be dimeric combinations of two subunits differing in charge but not in size.  hydroxylase from crude extracts of human, rat and calf liver was also separated into multiple forms by a chromatofocusing technique. The isoenzyme pattern was the same in human liver and kidney. The technique used to resolve the mammalian enzymes gave no evidence for the presence of multiple forms of the bacterial enzyme from Pseudomonas sp.

A higher L-carnitine yield was achieved when cells were incubated in a lower culture volume. The optimal pH for L-carnitine production was 5 to 5.5, whereas that of growth was 7.0, indicating that a pH shift was required.

The pharmacological treatment of angina has been largely focused on the "pump" through hemodynamic agents aimed at decreasing cardiac effort to decrease energy demand. A new concept arose focusing the "furnace" through  agents aimed at decreasing the oxygen cost of ATP production. This goal can be achieved by shifting energy production from fatty acid beta-oxidation to glucose oxidation. CPT1 inhibitors were developed to prevent the fatty acid entry into mitochondria but induced cardiac hypertrophy. Regulation of carnitine biology either by carnitine supply or by  hydroxylase inhibitors have led to controversial data both in pharmacological and clinical concerns. Trimetazidine and ranolazine increase the glucose/fatty acid oxidation balance and exhibit beneficial effects in animal studies as well as in clinical trials, both in monotherapy and in association with a traditional hemodynamic drug. The association of  and hemodynamic agents brings additive benefits in angina, whereas associations of hemodynamics do not. The mechanism of these drugs has not been fully understood in terms of specific target.

Culture techniques that are more stable and methods for the more efficient production of MSCs with therapeutic efficacy are needed. We evaluate the effects of growing bone marrow (Bm)-derived MSCs in the presence of L-carnitine, which is believed to promote  and to suppress apoptosis. The presence of L-carnitine decreased the degree of drug-induced apoptosis and suppressed adipogenic differentiation. Metabolomic analysis by means of the exhaustive investigation of metabolic products showed that, in addition to increased β-oxidation and the expression of all carnitine derivatives other than  (an intermediate in carnitine synthesis), polysaturated and polyunsaturated acids were down-regulated. An integrated analysis incorporating both serial analysis of gene expression and metabolomics revealed increases in cell survival, suggesting the utility of carnitine. The addition of carnitine elevated the oxygen consumption rate by BmMSCs that had been cultured for only a few generations and those that had become senescent following repeated replication indicating that mitochondrial activation occurred. Our exhaustive analysis of the effects of various carnitine metabolites thus suggests that the addition of L-carnitine to BmMSCs during expansion enables efficient cell production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27730694>Acylcarnitines as markers of exercise-associated fuel partitioning, xenometabolism, and potential signals to muscle afferent neurons.</a></h2><p>What is the central question of this study? Does improved metabolic health and insulin sensitivity following a weight-loss and fitness intervention in sedentary, obese women alter exercise-associated fuel  and incomplete mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO), as tracked by blood acylcarnitine patterns? What is the main finding and its importance? Despite improved fitness and blood sugar control, indices of incomplete mitochondrial FAO increased in a similar manner in response to a fixed load acute exercise bout; this indicates that intramitochondrial muscle FAO is inherently inefficient and is tethered directly to ATP turnover. With insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes mellitus, mismatches between mitochondrial fatty acid fuel delivery and oxidative phosphorylation/tricarboxylic acid cycle activity may contribute to inordinate accumulation of short- or medium-chain acylcarnitine fatty acid derivatives [markers of incomplete long-chain fatty acid oxidation (FAO)]. We reasoned that incomplete FAO in muscle would be ameliorated concurrent with improved insulin sensitivity and fitness following a ∼14 week training and weight-loss intervention in obese, sedentary, insulin-resistant women. Contrary to this hypothesis, overnight-fasted and exercise-induced plasma C4-C14 acylcarnitines did not differ between pre- and postintervention phases. These metabolites all increased robustly with exercise (∼45% of pre-intervention peak oxygen consumption) and decreased during a 20 min cool-down. This supports the idea that, regardless of insulin sensitivity and fitness, intramitochondrial muscle β-oxidation and attendant incomplete FAO are closely tethered to absolute ATP turnover rate. Acute exercise also led to branched-chain amino acid acylcarnitine derivative patterns suggestive of rapid and transient diminution of branched-chain amino acid flux through the mitochondrial branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. We confirmed our prior novel observation that a weight-loss/fitness intervention alters plasma xenometabolites [i.e. cis-3,4-methylene-heptanoylcarnitine and γ-butyrobetaine (a co-metabolite possibly derived in part from gut bacteria)], suggesting that host metabolic health regulated gut microbe . Finally, we considered whether acylcarnitine metabolites signal to muscle-innervating afferents; palmitoylcarnitine at concentrations as low as 1-10 μm activated a subset (∼2.5-5%) of these neurons ex vivo. This supports the hypothesis that in addition to tracking exercise-associated shifts in fuel , muscle acylcarnitines act as signals of exertion to short-loop somatosensory-motor circuits or to the brain.© 2016 The Authors.

Mildronate was designed to inhibit carnitine biosynthesis in order to prevent accumulation of cytotoxic intermediate products of fatty acid beta-oxidation in ischemic tissues and to block this highly oxygen-consuming process. Mildronate is efficient in the treatment of heart ischemia and its consequences. Extensive evaluation of pharmacological activities of mildronate revealed its beneficial effect on cerebral circulation disorders and central nervous system (CNS) functions. The drug is used in neurological clinics for the treatment of brain circulation disorders. It appears to improve patients' mood; they become more active, their motor dysfunction decreases, and asthenia, dizziness and nausea become less pronounced. Since the brain does not utilize fatty acids as fuel other mechanisms of action of mildronate in CNS should be considered. Several reports indicate the possible existence of an alternative, non-carnitine dependent mechanism of action of mildronate. Our recent findings suggest that CNS effects of mildronate could be mediated by stimulation of the nitric oxide production in the vascular endothelium by modification of the  and its esters pools. It is hypothesized that mildronate may increase the formation of the  esters. The latter are potent cholinomimetics and may activate eNOS via acetylcholine receptors or specific  ester receptors. This article summarizes known pharmacological effects of mildronate, its pharmacokinetics, toxicology, as well as the proposed mechanisms of action.</p></html>
