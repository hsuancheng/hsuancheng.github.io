Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common  skin condition characterized by relapsing eczematous lesions in a typical distribution. It was first described in 1933 but exists since antiquity.To determine the relationship between AD and IBS.A total of 109 patients with AD and 100 healthy controls were included in the study. They were defined for diagnosis of IBS according to ROME-III diagnostic criteria. Supporting findings, Bristol stool scale, frequency of defecation and history of AD and IBS were also evaluated. AD severity was assessed using Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis index.A total of 62 patients (56.9%) in the AD group and 28 patients (28%) in the control group were diagnosed with IBS (<0.001). Supportive findings excluding abnormal stool frequency and passage of mucus were more frequent in AD patients. There was no significant relationship between  severity according to SCORAD index and variables in AD patients.This is a rather uncultivated area in the field of AD. We observed that IBS was more common in AD group. Also, supporting findings like abnormal stool form, abdominal distension, feeling of incomplete evacuation, and straining were found more frequently in AD patients. These results may indicate the association between AD and IBS. In our opinion, patients with atopic dermatitis should be questioned in terms of IBS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626042>Risk Factors for Recurrent Community-associated Clostridiodes Difficile Infection in Children.</a></h1><p>Recurrence of community-associated (CA) Clostridiodes difficile infection (CDI) approaches 30%. Studies on risk factors and treatment of choice for pediatric CA-CDI are scarce with variable recommendations.This was a retrospective cohort study of the electronic health records of children 1-17 years with stool specimens sent for C. difficile at Kaiser Permanente Northern California from January 01, 2012 to December 31, 2016. Children with (1) CA , (2) confirmatory C. difficile laboratory testing with no other identified causes of diarrhea and (3) clinical symptoms consistent with CDI were defined as cases. Recurrent CA-CDI was defined using the above-described case criteria and onset of diarrhea within 8 weeks of primary CA-CDI.Of the 7350 children with stool samples sent for C. difficile testing, 408 had primary CA-CDI. Forty-five (11%) experienced a recurrence. Using multivariable logistic regression,  [odds ratio (OR) 7.; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.6-21.1] and cancer (OR 6.3; 95% CI: 1.6-24.1) diagnoses were risk factors for recurrent . Compared with children of Caucasian race, those with multi/other/unknown race had an OR of 3.03 (95% CI: 1.04-8.82) of recurrence. There was no statistically significant difference in the type or duration of therapy as a predictor for recurrent CA CDI. Six percent of children who received metronidazole were switched to vancomycin due to subjective metronidazole allergy or intolerance or metronidazole treatment failure.Recurrent CA-CDI in children in our population is less common than previously reported. This study supports first-line treatment with the standard, short course metronidazole in most cases of primary CA-CDI.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31566409>Status of transition care in  in Spain. Different medical perspectives.</a></h1><p>transition is important for a successful follow-up of adolescents with  (IBD). The objectives of the study were to establish the situation of transition in Spain and to identify needs, requirements and barriers to transition from pediatric and adult gastroenterologist perspectives.a structured survey for self-completion using the REDCap platform was distributed via the Spanish Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (SEGHNP) and the Spanish Working Group on Crohn's  and Ulcerative Colitis (GETECCU). The questionnaire contained closed and ranked questions concerning transition, perceived needs, organizational, clinician and patient related barriers to transition.one hundred and forty surveys were answered, 53% in pediatrics (PG) and 47% from adult gastroenterologists (AG) among 90 hospitals; 66% of them were reference centers. There was a higher response from pediatricians (18.2%) versus adult gastroenterologists (8.3%) (p = 0.03). A structured transition program is adequate in 42.2% centers. A well-structured transition was perceived as very important by 79.% of PG and 63% of AG (p = 0.03). A higher proportion of both groups identified inadequacies in the preparation of adolescents for transfer (43% and 38%, p = ns). The main deficit areas were the lack of knowledge about  and treatment as well as the lack of self-advocacy and care coordination. Lack of resources, time and critical mass of patients were the highest ranked barriers by both groups. AG and PG (54% and 55%) highlighted suboptimal training in adolescent medicine.in Spain, nearly half of the centers have developed a structured transition program. Lack of training, time and insufficient resources are the main barriers for a successful transition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31498502>Nationwide validation study of diagnostic algorithms for  in Korean National Health Insurance Service database.</a></h1><p>We conducted a nationwide validation study of diagnostic algorithms to identify cases of  (IBD) within the Korea National Health Insurance System (NHIS) database.Using the NHIS dataset, we developed 44 algorithms combining the International Classification of  (ICD)-10 codes, codes for Rare and Intractable  (RID) registration and claims data for health care encounters, and pharmaceutical prescriptions for IBD-specific drugs. For each algorithm, we compared the case identification results from electronic medical records data with the gold standard (chart-based diagnosis). A multiple sampling test verified the validation results from the entire study population.A random nationwide sample of 1697 patients (848 potential cases and 849 negative control cases) from 17 hospitals were included for validation. A combination of the ICD-10 code, ≥ 1 claims for health care encounters, and ≥ 1 prescription claims (reference algorithm) achieved excellent performance (sensitivity, 93.1% [95% confidence interval 91-94.7]; specificity, 98.1% [96.9-98.8]; positive predictive value, 97.% [96.1-98.]; negative predictive value, 94.% [92.8-95.8]) with the lowest error rate (4.2% [3.3-.3]). The multiple sampling test confirmed that the reference algorithm achieves the best performance regarding IBD diagnosis. Algorithms including the RID registration codes exhibited poorer performance compared with that of the reference algorithm, particularly for the diagnosis of patients affiliated with secondary hospitals. The performance of the reference algorithm showed no statistical difference depending on the hospital volume or IBD type, with P-value < 0.05.We strongly recommend the reference algorithm as a uniform standard operational definition for future studies using the NHIS database.© 2019 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31513295>Interventions for maintenance of surgically induced remission in Crohn's : a network meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>Crohn's  (CD) is a chronic  of the gut. About 75% of people with CD undergo surgery at least once in their lifetime to induce remission. However, as there is no known cure for the , patients usually experience a recurrence even after surgery. Different interventions are routinely used in maintaining postsurgical remission. There is currently no consensus on which treatment is the most effective.To assess the effects and harms of interventions for the maintenance of surgically induced remission in Crohn's  and rank the treatments in order of effectiveness.We searched the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase from inception to 15 January 2019. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles, abstracts from major gastroenterology meetings, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO ICTRP. There was no restriction on language, date, or publication status.We considered for inclusion randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different interventions used for maintaining surgically induced remission in people with CD who were in postsurgical remission. Participants had to have received maintenance treatment for at least three months. We excluded studies assessing enteral diet, diet manipulation, herbal medicine, and nutritional supplementation.Two review authors independently selected relevant studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or by arbitration of a third review author when necessary. We conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) using a Bayesian approach through Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. For the pairwise comparisons carried out in Review Manager , we calculated risk ratios (RR) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). For the NMA, we presented hazard ratios (HR) with corresponding 95% credible intervals (95% CrI) and reported ranking probabilities for each intervention. For the NMA, we focused on three main outcomes: clinical relapse, endoscopic relapse, and withdrawals due to adverse events. Data were insufficient to assess time to relapse and histologic relapse. Adverse events and serious adverse events were not sufficiently or objectively reported to permit an NMA. We used CINeMA (Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis) methods to evaluate our confidence in the findings within networks, and GRADE for entire networks.We included 35 RCTs (3249 participants) in the review. The average age of study participants ranged between 33.6 and 38.8 years. Risk of bias was high in 18 studies, low in four studies, and unclear in 13 studies. Of the 35 included RCTs, 26 studies (2581 participants; 9 interventions) were considered eligible for inclusion in the NMA. The interventions studied included -aminosalicylic acid (-ASA), adalimumab, antibiotics, budesonide, infliximab, probiotics, purine analogues, sulfasalazine, and a combination of sulfasalazine and prednisolone. This resulted in 30 direct contrasts, which informed 102 mixed-treatment contrasts.The evidence for the clinical relapse network (21 studies; 2245 participants) and endoscopic relapse (12 studies; 1128 participants) were of low certainty while the evidence for withdrawal due to adverse events (15 studies; 1498 participants) was of very low certainty. This assessment was due to high risk of bias in most of the studies, inconsistency, and imprecision across networks. We mainly judged individual contrasts as of low or very low certainty, except -ASA versus placebo, the evidence for which was judged as of moderate certainty.We ranked the treatments based on effectiveness and the certainty of the evidence. For clinical relapse, the five most highly ranked treatments were adalimumab, infliximab, budesonide, -ASA, and purine analogues. We found some evidence that adalimumab (HR 0.11, 95% Crl 0.02 to 0.33; low-certainty evidence) and -ASA may reduce the probability of clinical relapse compared to placebo (HR 0.69, 95% Crl 0.53 to 0.87; moderate-certainty evidence). However, budesonide may not be effective in preventing clinical relapse (HR 0.66, 95% CrI 0.27 to 1.34; low-certainty evidence). We are less confident about the effectiveness of infliximab (HR 0.36, 95% CrI 0.02 to 1.74; very low-certainty evidence) and purine analogues (HR 0.75, 95% CrI 0.55 to 1.00; low-certainty evidence). It was unclear whether the other interventions reduced the probability of a clinical relapse, as the certainty of the evidence was very low.Due to high risk of bias and limited data across the network, we are uncertain about the effectiveness of interventions for preventing endoscopic relapse. Whilst there might be some evidence of prevention of endoscopic relapse with adalimumab (HR 0.10, 95% CrI 0.01 to 0.32; low-certainty evidence), no other intervention studied appeared to be effective.Due to high risk of bias and limited data across the network, we are uncertain about the effectiveness of interventions for preventing withdrawal due to adverse events. Withdrawal due to adverse events appeared to be least likely with sulfasalazine (HR 1.96, 95% Crl 0.00 to 8.90; very low-certainty evidence) and most likely with antibiotics (HR 53.92, 95% Crl 0.43 to 259.80; very low-certainty evidence). When considering the network as a whole, two adverse events leading to study withdrawal (i.e. pancreatitis and leukopenia) occurred in more than 1% of participants treated with an intervention. Pancreatitis occurred in 2.8% (11/399) of purine analogue participants compared to 0.17% (2/1210) of all other groups studied. Leukopenia occurred in 2.% (10/399) of purine analogue participants compared to 0.08% (1/1210) of all other groups studied.Due to low-certainty evidence in the networks, we are unable to draw conclusions on which treatment is most effective for preventing clinical relapse and endoscopic relapse. Evidence on the safety of the interventions was inconclusive, however cases of pancreatitis and leukopenia from purine analogues were evident in the studies. Larger trials are needed to further understand the effect of the interventions on endoscopic relapse.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504528>Corticosteroid-Free Remission vs Overall Remission in Clinical Trials of Moderate-Severe Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's .</a></h1><p>We summarized the protocol-specified corticosteroid tapering regimens in clinical trials of moderate-severe ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's  (CD) and calculated differences in rates of clinical remission vs corticosteroid-free clinical remission (CSF-CR).Through a systematic literature review through February 28, 2019, we identified 16 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of biologics or small molecules in patients with moderate-severe UC or CD who reported CSF-CR as an outcome. We estimated the relative risk and 95% confidence interval of achieving CSF-CR vs overall clinical remission in patients treated with active intervention or placebo through random-effects meta-analysis.Across trials of UC (11 trials) and CD ( trials), a median of 53% and 49% of participants were on corticosteroids at the time of trial entry, respectively. Participants were allowed to enter trials at a median corticosteroid dose (range) of 35 (20-40) mg/d. Doses were kept stable for a median (range) of 8 (-10) weeks during induction therapy, after which a mandatory and structured taper was implemented, albeit with the investigators' discretion depending on clinical status. Pooled rates of CSF-CR in patients with UC and CD treated with placebo were 9.7% and 19.1%, respectively. In UC and CD trials, the rate of CSF-CR was 24% and 18% lower than the rate of overall clinical remission, respectively.Protocol-specified corticosteroid tapering regimens vary across trials. These findings will help to inform the design and interpretation of future clinical trials and highlight the need for standardization.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

An MEFV gene mutation has been identified as the cause of FMF. Recently, patients with MEFV gene mutations and chronic gastrointestinal mucosal inflammation mimicking  (IBD) have been reported. In this retrospective study, we analyzed the clinical characteristics of patients with IBD unclassified (IBDU) with MEFV gene mutations.MEFV gene analysis was performed on 8 patients with IBDU among 710 patients with IBD who had been treated at Kyorin University Hospital from April 2016 to December 2018. Clinical manifestations, endoscopic findings, and serological markers were also analyzed.The average of the 8 patients with IBDU (3 men,  women) was 32.7 ± 6.4 years (range 26-76 years). Their symptoms comprised diarrhea (n = 8, 100%), hematochezia (n = 3, 37.%), abdominal pain (n = 3, 37.%), high fever (n = 2, 16.%), and other periodic symptoms (n = 2, 16.%). MEFV gene mutation was confirmed in 4/8 of these patients. Colonoscopy showed various mucosal lesions, rectal sparing, right side dominant colitis, pseudopolyposis, and granular protrusions. Colchicine was administered to  of the 8 patients (4 with and 1 without MEFV mutation) who were resistant to conventional treatment for ulcerative colitis. Clinical and endoscopic improvement was observed in all of  patients treated with colchicine.Some patients diagnosed as having IBDU have enterocolitis related to MEFV gene mutation and respond to colchicine therapy.© 2019 S.

Therefore, diagnostic markers for colorectal dysplasia and cancer are urgently needed for patients with UC. Stathmin 1 (STMN1) is a novel cancer biomarker that is also a novel target for treatment in several cancers, including colon cancer. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between STMN1 expression and clinical features in colorectal dysplasia and cancer in patients with UC. The present study examined the clinical significance of STMN1 expression in colorectal dysplasia and cancer with UC. The present study performed an immunohistochemical analysis of 31 clinical colorectal samples from eight patients with colorectal dysplasia and/or cancer to assess the relationships between STMN1 expression and clinicopathological features including mismatch repair protein expression, rate of Ki-67 positivity, differentiation level, TNM stage, and UC duration. STNM1 expression was detected in 95.7% of dysplastic and cancerous lesions, whereas p53, the current diagnostic marker, was not expressed in 39.1% of dysplastic and cancerous lesions. Furthermore, STMN1 expression was associated with a high rate of positivity for Ki-67, a proliferation marker. Our data suggest that STMN1 in the colonic mucosa of UC patients may be useful as an early diagnostic marker of dysplasia and colitic cancer.Copyright: © Osone et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611228>Gallstone ileus managed with enterolithotomy.</a></h1><p>Although gallstone  is classically associated with the  sequela of cholecystitis, other presentations include gallstone ileus, Mirizzi syndrome, Bouveret syndrome and gallstone ileus. Gallstone ileus occurs when a gallstone passes from a cholecystoduodenal fistula into the gastrointestinal tract and causes obstruction, usually at the ileocaecal valve. It represents an uncommon complication of cholelithiasis, accounting for 1%-4% of all cases of mechanical  obstruction and 25% of all cases in individuals aged >65 years. It has a female predilection. Clinical presentation depends on the site of the obstruction. Diagnosis can prove challenging with the diagnosis rendered in 50% of cases intraoperatively. The authors present the case of a 79-year-old woman with a 10-day history of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and episodes of loose stools. An abdominal radiograph showed mildly distended right small  loops. Further investigation with a CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated small  obstruction secondary to a 3.3 cm calculus within the small . She underwent a laparotomy and a .0×2. cm gallstone was evident, causing complete obstruction. An enterolithotomy was performed. Her postoperative course was complicated by Mobitz type II heart block requiring pacemaker insertion. This paper will provide an overview of the clinical presentation, investigations and management of gallstone ileus. It provides a cautionary reminder of considering gallstone ileus in the differential diagnosis in elderly patients presenting with  obstruction and a history of gallstone .© BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2019.

It has a unique function in the treatment of gastrointestinal dysfunction including irritable  syndrome (IBS), is a common functional  . Its main symptoms are recurrent abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation or alternations between diarrhea and constipation. There are obvious differences in metabolites between TCM syndromes. By comparing the body fluid metabolism maps of model animals, metabolomics can discover  biomarkers, analyze the differences in metabolic pathways and understand the pathological process and the metabolic pathways of substances in the body. Thus, the evaluation of animal models tends to be comprehensive and objective. This may provide further understanding between the interaction between Tong Xie Yao Fang and the IBS model.To evaluate the effect of Tong Xie Yao Fang on IBS rats by using metabolomics method.Wistar rats were used to establish IBS models, and then randomly divided into four groups: A model control group and three Tong Xie Yao Fang treatment groups (high, medium and low doses). A normal, non-IBS group was established. The rats were treated for 2 wk. On days 0 and 14 of the experimental model, urine was collected for 12 h and was analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Nine potential biomarkers were identified, and six major metabolic pathways were found to be related to IBS.In the study of metabonomics, nine potential biomarkers including L-serine, 4-methylgallic acid, L-threonine, succinylacetone, prolyl-hydroxyproline, valyl-serine, acetyl citrate, marmesin rutinoside and -hydroxy-L-tryptophan were identified in urine, which were assigned to amino acids, organic acids, succinyl and glycosides. Furthermore, the metabolic pathway of L-serine, L-threonine and -hydroxy-L-tryptophan was found in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, which mainly involved the metabolism of cysteine and methionine, vitamin B6 metabolism, serotonin synapse, tryptophan metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, digestion, absorption of protein and amino acid metabolism. These pathways are related to intestinal dysfunction,  syndrome, nervous system dysfunction and other .Tong Xie Yao Fang has pharmacological effects on IBS, and its mechanism may be related to the metabolism of the nine potential biomarkers identified above in urine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31530738>Long-term Outcomes of Adalimumab Therapy in Korean Patients with Ulcerative Colitis: A Hospital-Based Cohort Study.</a></h1><p>Studies on long-term outcomes of adalimumab therapy in non-Caucasian patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) are lacking.We analyzed long-term outcomes of Korean UC patients treated with adalimumab at the Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.Between July 2013 and October 2018, adalimumab therapy was started in a total of 100 patients with UC (65 males [65.0%]; median age, 39. years [interquartile range, 23.3 to 49.8 years]; and median  duration, 3.0 years [interquartile range, 1.0 to 7.0 years]). The median duration of adalimumab therapy was 13. months (interquartile range, 4.0 to 32.0 months). Eight of 100 patients (8.0%) received induction therapy only, four (4.0%) of whom ultimately underwent colectomy. Of 92 patients who received adalimumab maintenance therapy, 30 (30.0%) stopped adalimumab therapy due to loss of response, and one patient (1.0%) was lost to follow-up. Among the 92 patients who received adalimumab maintenance therapy, the cumulative proportions of patients remaining on adalimumab maintenance therapy were 70.0% at 1 year and 48.9% at  years. High partial Mayo score after 8 weeks of adalimumab therapy (hazard ratio [HR], 1.217; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.040 to 1.425; p=0.014) and a history of exposure to two biologic agents before adalimumab therapy (HR, 4.722; CI, 1.033 to 21.586; p=0.045) were predictors of adalimumab discontinuation.Long-term outcomes of adalimumab therapy in Korean UC patients appear to be comparable to those in previously published Western studies. Furthermore, previous exposure to multiple biologic agents before adalimumab therapy and  activity after 8 weeks of adalimumab therapy were predictors of adalimumab discontinuation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31571837>Participation in an innovative patient support program reduces prescription abandonment for adalimumab-treated patients in a commercial population.</a></h1><p>Nonadherence to indicated therapy reduces treatment effectiveness and may increase cost of care. HUMIRA Complete, a Patient Support Program (PSP), aims to reduce nonadherence in patients prescribed adalimumab (ADA). The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between participation in the PSP and prescription abandonment rates among ADA-treated patients.This longitudinal study using patient-level data from AbbVie's PSP linked with medical and pharmacy claims data included patients ≥18 years with an ADA-approved indication, ≥1 pharmacy claim for ADA, and available data ≥3 months before and ≥6 months after the index date (defined as the initial ADA claim [01/2015 to 02/2017]). Abandonment was defined as reversal of initial ADA prescription with no paid claim during 3-month follow-up. Abandonment rates were compared between PSP and non-PSP cohorts using multivariable logistic regression controlling for potentially confounding baseline characteristics.In 17,371 patients (9,851 PSP; 7,520 non-PSP), the overall abandonment rate was 10.8-16.8% across indications. The odds of ADA abandonment were 70% less for PSP vs non-PSP patients (.6% vs 20.4%, odds ratio [OR]=0.30, [95% confidence interval (CI)=0.27-0.33] <0.001), 38% less for patients using specialty vs retail pharmacy (OR=0.62, 95% CI=0.56-0.69, <0.001), 20% less for those with income of $50-99K vs $0-49K (OR=0.80, 95% CI=0.69-0.92, <0.01), and 78% greater for those with copayment of $26-100 vs $0-25 (OR=1.78, 95% CI=1.55-2.05, <0.001).Participation in the PSP, higher income, and using a specialty pharmacy were associated with lower odds of abandoning ADA therapy, whereas increased copayments were associated with greater abandonment. PSPs should be considered to improve initiation of ADA therapy.© 2019 Brixner et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31605115>Matrix-Delivered Autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cell Therapy for Refractory Rectovaginal Crohn's Fistulas.</a></h1><p>Crohn's rectovaginal fistulizing  remains notoriously difficult to treat. A phase I clinical trial to evaluate the safety and feasibility of a novel protocol using a mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-coated Gore Bio-A fistula plug for the treatment of medically and surgically refractory Crohn's rectovaginal fistulas was conducted.Five patients underwent an autologous subcutaneous adipose tissue harvest via a 2-cm abdominal wall incision at time of exam under anesthesia (EUA) with seton placement. MSCs were isolated, expanded, and impregnated on the plug. After 6 weeks, patients returned to the operating room for placement of the MSC-coated plug. The primary end points were safety and feasibility; the secondary end point was clinical and radiographic healing at 6 months.Five female patients (median age [range], 49 [38-53] years) with a median  duration (range) of 23 (7-34) years who were on biologic (n = ) or combination therapy (n = 3) had successful harvest and expansion of MSCs and delivery of the Gore Bio-A plug. There were no serious adverse events or adverse events related to the MSCs or plug during the 6-month follow-up. At 6 months, 3 patients had complete cessation of drainage, and 2 had >50% reduction in drainage; all had a persistent fistula tract identified on magnetic resonance imaging and EUA at 6 months.Surgical placement of an autologous adipose-derived MSC-coated fistula plug in diverted patients with Crohn's rectovaginal fistulas was safe and feasible. All patients had a reduction in the size of their fistula tract, and 3 of  had cessation of drainage, but none achieved complete healing.This was a phase I clinical trial of autologous mesenchymal stem cells on a plug for rectovaginal Crohn's fistulas.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

The aim of the study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of scintigraphy with 99mTechnetium Hexamethylpropyleneamine Oxime (99mTc-HMPAO) labeled leukocytes in children with suspected IBD.Eighty-five children (age 12.4 ± 4.3 years, 47% boys) with suspected IBD based on clinical presentation, laboratory and ultrasound findings underwent scintigraphy with 99mTc-HMPAO labeled leukocytes. Abdominal scintigrams were acquired 40 min and 90 min post injection, and whole body scintigrams at 180 min. Scintigraphy was evaluated by two specialists in nuclear medicine. The results were compared with the final diagnosis established by endoscopy, histology, other imaging methods, and follow-up evaluated by an expert in pediatric gastroenterology.Scintigraphy results corresponded with the final diagnosis in 78 (91%) patients resulting in a sensitivity of 89% (95%CI 72 to 98%), specificity of 91% (95% CI 82 to 98%), and accuracy of 91% (95% CI 83 to 96%). The interobserver agreement was 0.82 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.88) and the radiation dose estimate was 4.2 ± 1. mSv. In 28 children (25 positives and 3 negatives on scintigraphy), the diagnosis of IBD was established by endoscopy, histology, MR enterography, or fluoroscopy. Five positive findings on scintigraphy were not confirmed by other methods or during follow-up.Scintigraphy with 99mTc-HMPAO labeled leukocytes in children with suspected IBD has high accuracy and offers a non-invasive option for detecting the presence of gastrointestinal inflammation. Scintigraphy is a powerful non-invasive decision-making tool in the management of suspected IBD that may spare a greater proportion of children of more invasive and demanding examinations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31575890>A Systematic Review of Technical Parameters for MR of the Small  in non-IBD Conditions over the Last Ten Years.</a></h1><p>Technical guidelines for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the small  (SB) in the setting of  (IBDs) were detailed in a 2017 consensus issued by European Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology (ESGAR) and European Society of Pediatric Radiology (ESPR); however, MRI for non-IBD conditions was not addressed. Hence, we performed a systematic review collecting researches on SB MRI for non-IBDs. The literatures were then divided into morphologic group and functional group. Information about the MRI techniques, gastrointestinal preparation, and details of cine-MRI protocols was extracted. We found that a 1. T MRI system, prone positioning, and MR enterography were frequently utilized in clinical practice. Gadolinium contrast sequences were routinely implemented, while diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was much less performed. The gastrointestinal preparation varied throughout the studies. No uniform protocols for cine imaging could be established. SB MRI examinations for non-IBDs are far from standardized, especially for functional studies. Recommendations for standard parameters in cine-MRI sequences are difficult to make due to lack of evidentiary support. MRI investigations in non-IBD conditions are needed and the standardization of non-IBD imaging in clinical practice is required.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589357>Therapeutic drug monitoring in  reduces unnecessary use of infliximab with substantial associated cost-savings.</a></h1><p>Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of infliximab (IFX) levels in  (IBD) patients can help to guide dose adjustments or changes to therapy for selected patients in remission or with secondary loss of response.To determine how IFX TDM is utilised in a real-life clinical setting and to quantify the potential for TDM to reduce the unnecessary use of IFX.Data from all public IBD IFX level testing performed across Australia was prospectively collected from June 2016 to July 2017 to assess physician-reported for testing indications (induction, in remission or loss of response) and associated results. The hypothetical influence of IFX TDM was based on an optimal therapeutic range of 6-10 mg/L for mucosal healing.Secondary loss of response (reactive TDM) was the most common indication for TDM. These patients have consistently lower median IFX levels: 3.02 mg/L (IQR 1.14 - 6.67 mg/L) vs. .22 mg/L (IQR 2.70 - 8.12 mg/L), p = 0.0001 compared with patients in remission (proactive TDM). TDM helped to identify unnecessary use of IFX in 30.6% of the TDM tests performed in luminal Crohn's  and ulcerative colitis patients, with an associated drug cost saving of $531.38 per IFX TDM test episode. Unnecessary IFX use was identified in 38.9% (96/247) of reactive IFX TDM tests performed and in 19.3% (35/181) of proactive testing.Use of both reactive and proactive IFX TDM is cost-effective for IBD management as it informs the clinician where unnecessary use of IFX can be stopped.

NX-13 is a small molecule therapeutic designed to target and activate NLRX1 to induce immunometabolic changes resulting in lower inflammation and therapeutic responses in  (IBD). This study investigates the safety of NX-13 in a seven-day, repeat-dose general toxicity study in male and female Sprague Dawley rats at oral doses of 500 and 1000 mg/kg. Weights, clinical signs, functional observational battery, clinical pathology and histopathology were used for evaluation. Daily oral dosing of NX-13 up to 1000 mg/kg did not result in any changes in weight, abnormal clinical signs or behavior. No significant differences were observed between treated and control rats in hematology or blood biochemistry. Histopathological evaluation of 12 tissues demonstrated no differences between controls and treated rats. There were no changes in weights of brain, heart, kidney, liver or spleen. Pharmacokinetic analysis of a single oral dose of NX-13 at 10 mg/kg in Sprague Dawley rats provided a maximum plasma concentration of 57 ng/mL at 0. h post-dose. Analysis of colon tissue after oral dosing with 1 and 10 mg/kg indicated high peak concentrations (10 and 100 µg/g, respectively) that scale in a dose-proportional manner. These experiments suggest that NX-13 is safe and well-tolerated in rats given oral doses as high as 1000 mg/kg with a favorable gastrointestinal localized pharmacokinetic profile, confirming NX-13 as a promising therapeutic for Crohn's  and ulcerative colitis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31546056>Discordance Between Patient-Reported Outcomes and Mucosal Inflammation in Patients With Mild to Moderate Ulcerative Colitis.</a></h1><p>Little is known about the association between rectal bleeding and increased stool frequency with endoscopic findings in patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (UC). We evaluated the associations between rectal bleeding or stool frequency and endoscopic remission in this population.We performed a post-hoc analysis of data from a phase 3 non-inferiority trial of 817 adults with mild to moderate UC who received treatment with mesalazine. We obtained information on rectal bleeding, stool frequency, and Mayo endoscopic subscores (MESs) at weeks 0, 8, and 38. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values with which rectal bleeding and stool frequency identified patients with MESs of 0 and/or 1 were calculated at weeks 8 and 38 of treatment. The associations between change in rectal bleeding and stool frequency and change in MES after treatment were quantified using the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.Among patients with a MES of 0, 7/82 patients (9%) had a rectal bleeding score of 1 or more and 40/82 patients (49%) had a stool frequency score of 1 or more at week 8; at week 38, 6/167 patients (4%) had a rectal bleeding score of 1 or more and 63/167 patients (38%) had a stool frequency score of 1 or more. Among patients with MESs of 0 or 1, 50/310 patients (16%) had a rectal bleeding score of 1 or more and 162/310 patients (52%) had had a stool frequency score of 1 or more at week 8; at week 38, 18/363 patients (%) had a rectal bleeding score of 1 or more and 141/363 patients (39%) had a stool frequency score of 1 or more. The Spearman rank correlation coefficients for change in rectal bleeding and stool frequency with change in MES at week 8 were 0.39 (95% CI, 0.32-0.45) and 0.34 (95% CI, 0.27-0.40), respectively. In patients with reduced MESs at week 8, 39/389 patients (10%) had unchanged or worsening rectal bleeding and 81/389 patients (21%) had unchanged or increasing stool frequencies.In a post-hoc analysis of data from a phase 3 trial of adults with mild to moderate UC treated with mesalazine, we found absence of rectal bleeding to identify patients in endoscopic remission. However, many patients in remission still have increased stool frequency, indicating that it may not be a sensitive marker of  activity in patients with mild to moderate UC.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

Topical tacrolimus is effective and safe in patients with refractory UP. However, it is not clear how tacrolimus suppositories fit into in the treatment algorithm of UP.We performed a randomized controlled, double-blind study at 8 hospitals in The Netherlands and Belgium from 2014 through 2017. Eighty-five patients with refractory UP (65% women) were randomly assigned to groups given once daily tacrolimus suppositories (2mg, n=43) or beclomethasone (3mg, n=42) for 4 weeks. The primary outcome was clinical response (decrease in Mayo score of 3 or more). Secondary outcomes included clinical remission, endoscopic response and remission, adverse events and quality of life. Outcomes were compared using Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney U test.Proportions of patients with clinical responses were 63% in the tacrolimus group and 59% in the beclomethasone group (P=.812); proportions of patients in clinical remission were 46% and 38%, respectively (P=.638). Proportions of patients with an endoscopic response were 68% and 60% in the tacrolimus group and in the beclomethasone group (P=.636); proportions in endoscopic remission rates were 30% and 13%, respectively (P=.092) Median increases in the  questionnaire score were 18.0 in the tacrolimus group and 20. in the beclomethasone group (P=.395). Adverse event rates did not differ significantly between groups.In a 4-week randomized controlled trial, tacrolimus and beclomethasone suppositories induce comparable clinical and endoscopic responses in patients with UP refractory to -ASA. There were no significant differences in adverse events rates. Tacrolimus and beclomethasone suppositories are therefore each safe and effective treatment options for -ASA refractory .

Women and their infants were followed to one year postpartum with maternal interviews, medical records abstraction, and physical examinations. Study outcomes were major structural birth defects, minor defects, spontaneous abortion, preterm delivery, pre and post-natal growth deficiency, serious or opportunistic infections and malignancies. 42/602 (7.0%) of pregnancies were lost-to-follow-up. 22/221 (10.0%) in the adalimumab-exposed cohort had a live born infant with a major birth defect compared to 8/106 (7.%) in the diseased unexposed cohort (adjusted odds ratio 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45 to 2.73). Women in the adalimumab-exposed cohort were more likely to deliver preterm compared to the healthy cohort (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.59, 95% CI 1.22 to .50), but not compared to the diseased unexposed cohort (aHR 0.82, 95% CI 0.66 to 7.20). No significant increased risks were noted with adalimumab exposure for any other study outcomes.Adalimumab exposure in pregnancy compared to diseased unexposed pregnancies was not associated with an increased risk for any of the adverse outcomes examined.

There was a total of 16 lesions. Endoscopic intervention was performed for 16 times. EBD was done for 11 times, and  stricturotomies were carried out. Regular follow-up and examinations were done to observe whether there was remission or recurrence of clinical symptoms and replacement surgery.  Results: All 14 patients were successfully treated by endoscopy, and the success rate was 100%. Postoperative clinical symptoms were alleviated, and serious complications, such as perforation or hemorrhaging, did not occur. Obstructive symptoms were effectively alleviated at a median follow-up of 26.1 months (.9-35.3 months) and 8.3 months (1.6-17.8 months) for patients with balloon dilatation and stricturotomy, respectively. Two patients presented with symptoms of obstruction. These were given conservative symptomatic treatment without surgical intervention.  Conclusion: Enteroscopic treatments (EBD and NKSt) are safe and effective for intestinal strictures, and can prolong the time before surgical intervention is needed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600487>HLA-DQA1*05 Carriage Associated With Development of Anti-Drug Antibodies to Infliximab and Adalimumab in Patients With Crohn's .</a></h1><p>Anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapies are the most widely used biologic drugs for treating immune-mediated , but repeated administration can induce the formation of anti-drug antibodies. The ability to identify patients at increased risk for development of anti-drug antibodies would facilitate selection of therapy and use of preventative strategies.We performed a genome-wide association study to identify variants associated with time to development of anti-drug antibodies in a discovery cohort of 1240 biologic-naïve patients with Crohn's  starting infliximab or adalimumab therapy. Immunogenicity was defined as an anti-drug antibody titer ≥10 AU/ml in a drug-tolerant ELISA assay. Significant association signals were confirmed in a replication cohort of 178 patients with .The HLA-DQA1*05 allele, carried by approximately 40% of Europeans, significantly increased the rate of immunogenicity (hazard ratio [HR], 1.90; 95% CI, 1.60-2.25; P=.88×10). The highest rates of immunogenicity, 92% at 1 year, were observed in patients treated with infliximab monotherapy who carried HLA-DQA1*05; conversely the lowest rates of immunogenicity, 10% at 1 year, were observed in patients treated with adalimumab combination therapy who did not carry HLA-DQA1*05. We confirmed this finding in the replication cohort (HR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.35-2.98; P=6.60×10). This association was consistent for patients treated with adalimumab (HR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.32-2.70) or infliximab (HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.57-2.33), and for patients treated with anti-TNF therapy alone (HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.37-2.22) or in combination with an immunomodulator (HR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.57-2.58).In an observational study, we found a genome-wide significant association between HLA-DQA1*05 and the development of antibodies against anti-TNF agents. A randomized controlled biomarker trial is required to determine whether pretreatment testing for HLA-DQA1*05 improves patient outcomes by helping physicians select anti-TNF and combination therapies.

It included 302 eligible patients aged 20 years or older who underwent elective laparoscopic surgery for CRC. Patients were randomly assigned to an intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) therapy group or to an IPC + anticoagulation therapy group. Anticoagulation therapy comprised fondaparinux or enoxaparin for postoperative VTE prophylaxis. Postoperative VTE was diagnosed based on enhanced multi-detector helical computed tomography. The primary endpoint was VTE incidence, including asymptomatic cases, the secondary endpoint was incidence of major bleeding, and we conducted an intention-to-treat analysis. This study is registered in UMINCTR (UMIN000008435).Postoperative VTE incidence was .10% with IPC therapy (n = 157) and 2.76% with IPC + anticoagulant therapy (n = 145; =.293). We identified no symptomatic VTE cases. The major bleeding rates were 1.27% with IPC alone and 1.38% with the combination (=.936). The overall bleeding rates were 7.69% for enoxaparin and 13.6% for fondaparinux (=.500), and there were no bleeding-related deaths.Anticoagulant prophylaxis did not reduce the incidence of VTE and the incidence of major bleeding was comparable between the two groups. Usefulness of perioperative anticoagulation was not demonstrated in this study. Pharmacological prophylaxis must be restricted in Japanese patients with higher risk of VTE.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663849> deficiency results in colitis susceptibility.</a></h1><p> (IBD) affects 1.-3.0 million people in the United States. IBD is genetically determined and many common risk alleles have been identified. Yet, a large proportion of genetic predisposition remains unexplained. In this study we report the identification of an ultrarare missense variant (NM_006998.3:c.230G>A;p.Arg77His) in the  gene causing Mendelian early-onset ulcerative colitis.  encodes a calcium sensor that is exclusively expressed in neuroendocrine lineages, including enteroendocrine cells and gut neurons. SCGN interacts with the SNARE complex, which is required for vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. We show that the  mutation identified impacted the localization of the SNARE complex partner, SNAP25, leading to impaired hormone release. Finally, we show that mouse models of  deficiency recapitulate impaired hormone release and susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis. Altogether, these studies demonstrate that functional deficiency in SCGN can result in intestinal inflammation and implicates the neuroendocrine cellular compartment in IBD.© 2019, Sifuentes-Dominguez et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504513>Health Care Cost for Children Newly Diagnosed With .</a></h1><p>The increasing incidence of pediatric  (IBD), along with more extensive and severe  in children, raises concern for related health care expenditures.The aim of this study was to quantify and characterize costs of pediatric IBD in the year following diagnosis.We identified all patients diagnosed with IBD at Connecticut Children's Medical Center in 2016 with a minimum of 1 year follow-up. Clinical and demographic factors were recorded at diagnosis. We examined paid service and professional costs related to outpatient medications and infusions, outpatient procedures and radiology imaging, inpatient services, and outpatient visits. Actual dollar reimbursements were from private and public payers. Data is reported as mean ± SD and median (IQR).First-year cost data were collected on 67 patients (43 Crohn's  [CD], 24 ulcerative colitis [UC], mean age 13 years [SD 3.22]) revealing a mean cost of $45,753 (SD $37,938), with $43,095 (SD $30,828) for CD and $50,516 (SD $48,557) for UC. Severe CD (n = 11) had a mean cost of $71,176 (SD $43,817) and severe UC (n = ) $134,178 (SD $40,920). Patients receiving infusion therapy had a mean cost of $59,376 (SD $38,724) compared with $27,903 (SD $28,795) for those not receiving infusions. Overall cost distribution showed 37% from infusion costs, 25% hospital costs, 18% outpatient procedures, 10% outpatient oral medications, 7% outpatient imaging, and 3% outpatient visits.Infusion therapy is a key driver of first-year costs for children newly diagnosed with IBD. Understanding cost distribution in relation to  presentation can be helpful to anticipate future related costs.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press.

UC is estimated to afflict hundreds of thousands of people in the United States alone. In addition to traditional colonoscopy, ultrasonic techniques can detect colitis, but have limited spatial resolution, which frequently results in underdiagnoses. Nevertheless, clinical diagnosis of colitis is still generally performed via colonoscopy. Optical techniques such as confocal microscopy and optical coherence tomography (OCT) have been proposed to detect UC with higher resolution. However, UC can potentially alter tissue biomechanical properties, providing additional contrast for earlier and potentially more accurate detection. Although clinically available elastography techniques have been immensely useful, they do not have the resolution for imaging small tissues, such as in small mammalian  models. However, OCT-based elastography, optical coherence elastography (OCE), is well-suited for imaging the biomechanical properties of small mammal colon tissue.In this work, we induced elastic waves in  mouse colon tissue using a focused air-pulse. The elastic waves were detected using a phase-stabilized swept source OCE system, and the wave velocity was translated into stiffness. Measurements were taken at six positions for each sample to assess regional sample elasticity. Additional contrast between the control and diseased tissue was detected by analyzing the dispersion of the elastic wave and tissue optical properties obtained from the OCT structural image.The results show distinct differences (P<0.05) in the stiffness between control and colitis  samples, with a Young's modulus of 11.8±8.0 and .1±1. kPa, respectively. The OCT signal standard deviations for control and diseased samples were .8±0.3 and .±0.2 dB, respectively. The slope of the OCT signal spatial frequency decay in the control samples was 92.7±10.0 and 87.3±4.7 dB∙µm in the colitis samples. The slope of the linearly fitted dispersion curve in the control samples was 1. mm, and 0.8 mm in the colitis samples.Our results show that OCE can be utilized to distinguish tissue based on stiffness and optical properties. Our estimates of tissue stiffness suggest that the healthy colon tissue was stiffer than diseased tissue. Furthermore, structural analysis of the tissue indicates a distinct difference in tissue optical properties between the healthy and UC-like diseased tissue.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474792>High prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver  in patients with  receiving anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver  (NAFLD) is common in patients with  (IBD). This study evaluated the prevalence of NAFLD and the associated risk factors among IBD patients who received anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy.Adult IBD patients receiving anti-TNF therapy (infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab) were enrolled. Hepatic steatosis was assessed by abdominal ultrasound. Patients with a history of excessive alcohol or recent steroid use were excluded. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed.Eighty patients, 55% male, mean age 42±15 years, were enrolled. The sonographic prevalence of NAFLD was 54% (43/80), significantly higher than the general prevalence in the US adult population (30%) (P<0.0001). NAFLD patients had a significantly higher proportion of males, as well as greater body weight and body mass index, compared to non-NAFLD. The Crohns  activity index (CDAI) was significantly higher among patients with NAFLD. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that a higher CDAI was independently associated with NAFLD, with an odds ratio of 1.6 (95% confidence interval 1.05-2.44; P=0.03).The presence of IBD is strongly associated with NAFLD. We identified a high prevalence of NAFLD among IBD patients receiving anti-TNF. CDAI was independently associated with hepatic steatosis. Further studies are still needed to evaluate the pathophysiology of NAFLD development and  progression among IBD populations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31567711>Serum γ-globulin and albumin concentrations predict secondary loss of response to anti-TNFα in  patients.</a></h1><p>Loss of response to anti-TNFα treatment occurs frequently in IBD- patients. We evaluatedthe predictive value of serum albumin and γ-globulin concentrations for treatment failure.Prospectively, all patients treated for the first time with either infliximab or adalimumab for IBD between 2007 and 2018 were included. All patients were tested for serum albumin and γ-globulin concentrations and were followed up until June 2018.128 patients (95 Crohn's , 67 females, age 40.1 ± 13.7 years) were included in the study. 81patients (63.3%) received infliximab and 47 (36.7%) adalimumab first line. Eight patients (6.3%) were primary non-responders, 50 patients (39.0%) showed a sustained clinical remission and 70 patients (54.7%) developed a secondary loss of response. Meantime to develop secondary loss of response was 24. ± 20. months. Albumin serum concentrations in the clinical response group were significantly higher than in the secondary loss of response group (39.8 ± .7 g/L vs. 35.0 ± .4 g/L). γ-globulin serum concentrations in the sustained response group were significantly lower than in the secondary loss of response group (11.8 ± 2.8 g/L vs. 14.7 ± 4. g/L). Hypoalbuminemia and hypergammaglobulinemia were associated with the loss of response. Immunosuppressant co-medication in patients with high γ-globulin serum concentrations reduced the risk of secondary loss of response.Low albumin and increased γ-globulin serum concentrations are strongly associated with a higher risk for loss of response to an anti-TNFα treatment. Increased serum γ-globulin concentrations may have a higher risk to produce anti-drug antibodies or a different phenotype of  less responsive to anti-TNFα treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560042>Utilization of Diagnostic Imaging and Ionization Radiation Exposure Among an  Inception Cohort.</a></h1><p>Abdominal imaging is important in managing  (IBD). We characterized utilization of imaging and exposure to ionizing radiation.We enumerated abdominal diagnostic imaging in a population-based cohort of IBD patients between 1994 and 2016. Trends in utilization of abdominal computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound were characterized. Cumulative doses of ionizing radiation were compared between IBD patients and non-IBD controls and between Crohn's  (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. Regression models were constructed to assess predictors of high ionizing radiation exposure.There were 72,933 incident cases of IBD. During the first  years of diagnosis, IBD patients were exposed to nearly 6-fold higher exposure to cumulative ionizing radiation attributable to abdominal imaging compared with non-IBD controls (18.6 mSv vs 2.9 mSv). Cumulative ionizing radiation exposure was higher in CD than UC (26.0 mSv vs 12.0 mSv; P < 0.001). Crohn's  patients were more than twice as likely as UC patients to exceed 50 mSv (15.6% vs 6.2%; P < 0.001) and 100 mSV (.0% vs 2.1%; P < 0.001). There was geographic variation in ionizing radiation exposure, and individuals of lower income were more likely to have high exposure. Utilization of abdominal MRI has increased substantially, peaking between 2007 and 2012 and increasing annually at 34%, which coincided with an annual 2% decline in the use of abdominal CT.Crohn's  patients are at highest risk for high exposure to ionizing radiation, with a subgroup receiving potentially harmful levels. Increasing utilization and access to abdominal MRI may alleviate exposure.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Statistical analysis were performed for clinical and biochemical remission.Vit-D and zinc deficiency were detected in 58 and 4.% of the patients respectively. In IFX-treated patients, IFX-TC, Vit-D and CRP levels were associated independently with clinical remission with an OR of 20 (95% CI 1.3-333, p = 0.03), 1.3 (95% CI 1.1-1.7, p = 0.02) and 0.4 (95% CI 0.2-0.8, p = 0.01) respectively. Serum IFX-TC and Vit-D levels correlated positively (r = 0.39, p = 0.001), while serum IFX-TC and CRP levels showed an inverse correlation (r = -0.43, p < 0.001). Only -IFX-TC associated independently with biochemical remission with a threshold of 3.1 µg/mL. In ADA-treated patients, ADA-TC associated independently with clinical and biochemical remission with an OR of 2. (95% CI 1.1-.0, p = 0.04) and 1.3 (95% CI 1.1-1.4, p = 0.03) respectively. The serum zinc level was associated neither with clinical nor with biochemical remission in either cohort.Our results indicate that serum Vit-D level may be a predictive marker in addition to drug trough levels in IBD patients treated with IFX. Furthermore, due to the correlation between serum IFX and Vit-D levels, Vit-D substitution should be conducted in patients with low Vit-D levels.© 2019 S.

Indeed, mice that lack caspase-8 die in a RIPK3- and MLKL-dependent manner during embryogenesis. In humans, caspase-8 deficiency is associated with immunodeficiency or very early onset . The substrates that are cleaved by caspase-8 to prevent necroptosis in vivo have not been defined. Here we show that knock-in mice that express catalytically inactive caspase-8(C362A) die as embryos owing to MLKL-dependent necroptosis, similar to caspase-8-deficient mice. Thus, caspase-8 must cleave itself, other proteins or both to inhibit necroptosis. Mice that express caspase-8(D212A/D218A/D225A/D387A), which cannot cleave itself, were viable, as were mice that express c-FLIP or CYLD proteins that had been mutated to prevent cleavage by caspase-8. By contrast, mice that express RIPK1(D325A), in which the caspase-8 cleavage site Asp325 had been mutated, died mid-gestation. Embryonic lethality was prevented by inactivation of RIPK1, loss of TNFR1, or loss of both MLKL and the caspase-8 adaptor FADD, but not by loss of MLKL alone. Thus, RIPK1(D325A) appears to trigger cell death mediated by TNF, the kinase activity of RIPK1 and FADD-caspase-8. Accordingly, dying endothelial cells that contain cleaved caspase-3 were abnormally abundant in yolk sacs of Ripk1 embryos. Heterozygous Ripk1 cells and mice were viable, but were also more susceptible to TNF-induced cell death than were wild-type cells or mice. Our data show that Asp325 of RIPK1 is essential for limiting aberrant cell death in response to TNF, consistent with the idea that cleavage of RIPK1 by caspase-8 is a mechanism for dismantling death-inducing complexes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474787>Clinical utility of fecal calprotectin: potential applications beyond  for the primary care physician.</a></h1><p>Fecal calprotectin (FC) is an  marker released mainly from gastrointestinal granulocytes measured in stool samples. FC is noninvasive, economical, simple, and acceptable for patients. Levels of FC have proven reliable for intestinal inflammation, with good clinical sensitivity, and are useful in screening and monitoring  (IBD), as well as in the differential diagnosis between IBD and irritable  syndrome (IBS). Given its advantages, FC represents an attractive biomarker that could be utilized in various gastrointestinal (GI)  apart from IBD, and is currently being studied extensively by many research groups with significant amounts of data emerging. In this current review we aim to provide an outline of the utility of FC in distinguishing between IBS and IBD, as well as an up-to-date summary of the available clinical experience concerning FC in various common conditions of the GI tract commonly encountered by gastroenterology practitioners, such as IBS, microscopic colitis, acute gastroenteritis,  infection, colorectal cancer, diverticular , coeliac , and other GI conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611762>Fecal Calprotectin as a Marker of the Gut Immune System Activation Is Elevated in Parkinson's .</a></h1><p>Alpha-synucleinopathy constituting a characteristic feature of Parkinson's  (PD) occurs at all levels of the brain-gut axis including the enteric nervous system (ENS). Lesions in the ENS may be connected with gut inflammation, increased intestinal permeability and dysmotility contributing to the pathogenesis of PD and its gastrointestinal manifestations.To evaluate fecal calprotectin and zonulin as biomarkers of gut inflammation and intestinal barrier dysfunction in PD patients.Quantitative evaluation of fecal biomarkers was performed by ELISA tests in 35 PD patients and 20 healthy controls. Additionally, patients filled out a short questionnaire concerning gastrointestinal symptoms.Median fecal calprotectin level (μg/g) was significantly higher in PD patients compared to the controls: 54. (29.0-137.9) vs. 9.7 (.2-23.3),  < 0.0001. Applying age-related reference ranges, the increased fecal calprotectin level was found in 43% of PD patients and in none of the control subjects ( < 0.001). No correlation between fecal calprotectin level and PD duration was observed. No statistically significant difference between the groups regarding zonulin level was found. The most frequent  symptoms reported by PD patients included constipation (69% of subjects), feeling of incomplete evacuation (51%), bloating (51%), abdominal pain (20%), and alternating  movement pattern (17%).The evaluation of fecal calprotectin level may be a useful tool to detect the signs of gut immune system activation present in a remarkable number of PD patients, also in the early stage of the .

Information about  control, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), treatment patterns and use of healthcare resources is relevant to optimizing IBD management.To describe QoL and work productivity and activity impairment (WPAI), treatment patterns and use of healthcare resources among IBD patients in Brazil.A multicenter cross-sectional study included adult outpatients who were previously diagnosed with moderate to severe Crohn's  (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). At enrolment, active CD and UC were defined as having a Harvey Bradshaw Index ≥ 8 or a CD Activity Index ≥ 220 or calprotectin > 200 µg/g or previous colonoscopy results suggestive of inadequate control (per investigator criteria) and a 9-point partial Mayo score ≥ , respectively. The PRO assessment included the QoL questionnaires SF-36 and EQ-5D-5L, the  Questionnaire (IBDQ), and the WPAI questionnaire. Information about healthcare resources and treatment during the previous 3 years was collected from medical records. Chi-square, Fisher's exact and Student's -/Mann-Whitney  tests were used to compare PROs, treatment patterns and the use of healthcare resources by  activity (α = 0.05).Of the 407 patients in this study (CD/UC: 64.9%/35.1%, mean age 42.9/45.9 years, 54.2%/56.6% female, 38.3%/37.1% employed), 44.7%/25.2% presented moderate-to-severe CD/UC activity, respectively, at baseline. Expressed in median values for CD/UC, respectively, the SF-36 physical component was 46.6/44.7 and the mental component was 45.2/44.2, the EQ-visual analog scale score was 80.0/70.0, and the IBDQ overall score was 164.0/165.0. Moderate to severe activity, female gender, being unemployed, a lower educational level and lower income were associated with lower QoL ( < 0.05). Median work productivity impairment was 20% and % for CD and UC patients, respectively, and activity impairment was 30%, the latter being higher among patients with moderate to severe  activity compared to patients with mild or no  activity (75.0%  10.0%,  < 0.001).

Lactose intolerance is a well-established carbohydrate malabsorption syndrome that causes symptoms similar to IBS such as bloating, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. However, the prevalence of sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (SID) in this population is poorly defined. SID is a condition in which sucrase-isomaltase, an enzyme produced by brush border of small intestine to metabolize sucrose, is deficient. Just like lactase deficiency, SID causes symptoms of maldigestion syndromes including abdominal pain, bloating, gas, and diarrhea. In this study, we aim to determine the prevalence of SID in patients with presumed IBS-D/M and characterize its clinical presentation.Patients with a presumed diagnosis of IBS-D/M based on symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and/or bloating who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy with duodenal biopsies and testing for disaccharidase deficiency were included. Patients with a history of , gastrointestinal malignancy, or celiac  were excluded. Odds ratio was calculated for abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bloating in patients with versus without SID.A total of 31 patients with clinical suspicion for IBS-D/M were included with a median age of 46 years (IQR 30.-60) and with 61% females. SID was present in 35% of patients. Among patients with SID, 63.6% had diarrhea, 45.4% had abdominal pain, and 36.4% had bloating. Patients with SID were less likely than controls to have abdominal pain (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.03-0.81, p = 0.04) although no difference in diarrhea or bloating was found. Only two patients with SID underwent sucrose breath testing of which only one had a positive result. However, this patient also had a positive glucose breath test and may have had small intestinal bacterial overgrowth as a confounder.SID was found in 35% of patients with presumed IBS-D/M and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with abdominal pain, diarrhea, or bloating. Further studies should better characterize the clinical features of SID and investigate the effects of dietary modification in this group of patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31580982>Novel inhibitors of leukocyte transendothelial migration.</a></h1><p>Leukocyte transendothelial migration is one of the most important step in launching an  immune response and chronic inflammation can lead to devastating . Leukocyte migration inhibitors are considered as promising and potentially effective therapeutic agents to treat  and auto-immune disorders. In this study, based on previous trioxotetrahydropyrimidin based integrin inhibitors that suboptimally blocked leukocyte adhesion, twelve molecules with a modified scaffold were designed, synthesized, and tested in vitro for their capacity to block the transendothelial migration of immune cells. One of the molecules, namely, methyl 4-((2-(tert-butyl)-6-((2,4,6-trioxotetrahydropyrimidin-(2H)-ylidene) methyl) phenoxy) methyl) benzoate, (compound 12), completely blocked leukocyte transendothelial migration, without any toxic effects on immune or endothelial cells (IC = 2.4 µM). In vivo, compound 12 exhibited significant therapeutic effects in  (IBD)/Crohn's , multiple sclerosis, fatty liver , and rheumatoid arthritis models. A detailed acute and chronic toxicity profile of the lead compound in vivo did not reveal any toxic effects. Such a type of molecule might therefore provide a unique starting point for designing a novel class of leukocyte transmigration blocking agents with broad therapeutic applications in  and auto-immune pathologies.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

It affects more than 3. million people in the western world and places a huge financial burden on healthcare systems. IBD is highly heterogeneous;  severity and outcomes in IBD are highly variable, and patients may experience episodes of relapse and remission. However, treatment often follows a step-up model whereby the patients start with anti- agents (corticosteroids or immunosuppressants) and step-up to monoclonal anti-tumour necrosis factor-α (TNFα) antibodies and then other biologics if the initial drugs cannot control . Unfortunately, many patients do not respond to the costly biologics, and thus often still require gut-resective surgery, which decreases quality of life. In order to decrease rates of surgery and ineffective treatments, it is important to identify markers that accurately predict  progression and treatment responses, to inform decisions about the best choice of therapeutics. Here we examine molecular approaches to patient stratification that aim to increase the effectiveness of treatments and potentially reduce healthcare costs. In the future, it may become possible to stratify patients based on their suitability for specific molecular-targeted therapeutic agents, and eventually use molecular stratification for personalised medicine in IBD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Neutropenia represents major feature of GSD-Ib along with metabolic disturbances. Previous research in GSD-Ib patients did not reveal significant genotype-phenotype correlation. Our objective was to explore the frequency and severity of neutropenia and it's complications in relation to genotype of GSD-Ib patients.We estimated cumulative incidence of neutropenia and severe neutropenia, relation of genotype to absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and dynamics of ANC during serious bacterial infections (SBI) in a cohort of Serbian GSD Ib patients.

Besides protecting enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidase, non-enzymatic antioxidant molecules also play an important role as radical scavengers. Within bacteria the amino acid derivative ectoine (2-methyl-3,4,,6-tetrahydropyrimidine-4-carboxylate) is the most abundant compatible solute and stress protectant. Although this compound is already produced commercially for applications as moisturizer and skin-care product, it has been a matter of debate whether ectoine also has radical-scavenging activity. Here we report on its hydroxyl radical scavenging activity in comparison to other compatible solutes and describe the reaction products obtained when ectoine is exposed to hydroxyl radicals generated by the Fenton reaction. In a sodium salicylate scavenging test system this compatible solute performed as well as mannitol. As a consequence of its reaction with hydroxyl radicals, ectoine was converted into two major products: N-acetimide aspartate and N-acetimide-β-alanine. We propose a reaction mechanism in which the heterocycle of the compatible solute ectoine is cleaved and further oxidized at the C-terminus.

Using the LAQ/TPGS ratio of 1:100, LAQ-loaded micelles were successfully prepared by thin-film dispersion method. The solubility of LAQ in water was significantly increased from 10. μg/mL in pure water to 500 μg/mL in TPGS micelles. LAQ-loaded micelles of TPGS exhibited the fine particle size of 34.6 nm and Zeta potential of -0.67 mV. Moreover, the good stability of LAQ-loaded micelles in physiology-mimicking medium was confirmed by detecting their particle size, zeta potential and leakage of the loading drug. Therapeutic effect of LAQ-loaded micelles on DSS-induced mice was proved by detecting DAI score, colon length and loss of body weight. Moreover, the morphology and colonic mucosal barrier of the injured colon of DSS-induced mice was largely recovered after treatment with LAQ-loaded micelles. Meanwhile, the inflammation of colitis colon was also obviously alleviated by LAQ-loaded micelles.

Acetylcholine and nicotine stimulate mucus production and suppress Th2 inflammation through nicotinic receptors in lungs but UC is rarely observed in smokers and the mechanism of the protection is unclear.In order to evaluate whether acetylcholine can ameliorate UC-associated pathologies, we employed a mouse model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC-like conditions, and a group of mice were treated with Pyridostigmine bromide (PB) to increase acetylcholine availability. The effects on colonic tissue morphology, Th2  factors, MUC2 mucin, and gut microbiota were analyzed.DSS challenge damaged the murine colonic architecture, reduced the MUC2 mucin and the tight-junction protein ZO-1. The PB treatment significantly attenuated these DSS-induced responses along with the eosinophilic infiltration and the pro-Th2  factors. Moreover, PB inhibited the DSS-induced loss of commensal Clostridia and Flavobacteria, and the gain of pathogenic Erysipelotrichia and Fusobacteria.Together, these data suggest that in colons of a murine model, PB promotes MUC2 synthesis, suppresses Th2 inflammation and attenuates bacterial dysbiosis therefore, PB has a therapeutic potential in UC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31503493>Enhanced Oral Bioavailability of 2-(Phosphonomethyl)-pentanedioic Acid (2-PMPA) from its (-Methyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxol-4-yl)methyl (ODOL)-Based Prodrugs.</a></h1><p>2-(Phosphonomethyl)-pentanedioic acid (2-PMPA) is a potent (IC = 300 pM) and selective inhibitor of glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) with efficacy in multiple neurological and psychiatric  preclinical models and more recently in models of  (IBD) and cancer. 2-PMPA (), however, has not been clinically developed due to its poor oral bioavailability (<1%) imparted by its four acidic functionalities ( Log  = -1.14).

We hypothesized that mRNA profiles could (1) identify genes and pathways involved in  pathogenesis; (2) identify a molecular signature that differentiates IBD from other conditions; (3) provide insight into systemic and colon-specific dysregulation through study of the concordance of the gene expression.Children (8-18 years) were prospectively recruited at the time of diagnostic colonoscopy for possible IBD. We used transcriptome-wide mRNA profiling to study gene expression in colon biopsies and paired whole blood samples. Using blood mRNA measurements, we fit a regression model for  state prediction that was validated in an independent test set of adult subjects (GSE3365).Ninety-eight children were recruited [39 Crohn's , 18 ulcerative colitis, 2 IBDU, 39 non-IBD]. There were 1,118 significantly differentially (IBD vs non-IBD) expressed genes in colon tissue, and 880 in blood. The direction of relative change in expression was concordant for 106/112 genes differentially expressed in both tissue types. The regression model from the blood mRNA measurements distinguished IBD vs non-IBD  status in the independent test set with 80% accuracy using only 6 genes. The overlap of  immune and metabolic pathways in the two tissue types was significant (p<0.001).Blood and colon tissue from patients with IBD share a common transcriptional profile dominated by immune and metabolic pathways. Our results suggest that peripheral blood expression levels of as few as 6 genes (IL7R, UBB, TXNIP, S100A8, ALAS2, and SLC2A3) may distinguish patients with IBD from non-IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31491456>Changes in colonic contractility in response to : Long-term assessment in a model of TNBS-induced inflammation in rats.</a></h1><p> is a chronic relapsing inflammation that affects the gastrointestinal tract, causing changes in colonic motility. The evolution of these changes is not completely understood and possibly related to symptoms that appear in different degrees of the intestinal inflammation. Therefore, our aim is evaluate during 14 days of assessment aspects of colonic contractility using 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) model of inflammation in rats and associate the  process with colonic motility.Contractility and  parameters were assessed in the same animal in six different moments: before intestinal inflammation induction, 2, , 8, 11, and 14 days after induction. The mechanical activity was determined by alternating current biosusceptometry (ACB) and subdivided into rhythmic propagating ripples (RPR) and rhythmic propulsive motor complexes (RPMC). We assessed inflammation by determining myeloperoxidase activity in feces.Transient and permanent changes were observed in colonic motility as a function of the  process evaluated through myeloperoxidase activity. We identified two contraction profiles: RPR and RPMC. The microscopic analysis demonstrated a depth of damage caused by an injury that was associated with changes in motility.We implemented a robust and adequate (specific) signal processing to quantify two measured colonic frequency patterns. Thus, we performed a detailed temporal analysis of the consequences of TNBS-induced inflammation on colonic motility in rats. Our approach enables further long-term assessments in the same animal with different mechanisms and duration of injury, remission, treatments and their motor consequences.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The present study aimed to determine the prevalence and patient-specific characteristics associated with polypharmacy in an ulcerative colitis (UC) population and to assess the impact of polypharmacy on  outcomes.A retrospective chart review of patients with UC who visited a tertiary medical center outpatient clinic between 2006 and 2011 was performed. Polypharmacy was defined as major ( ≥  non-UC medications) or minor (2-4 non-UC medications). UC medications were excluded in the polypharmacy grouping to minimize the confounding between  severity and polypharmacy. Outcomes of interest include  flare, therapy escalation, UC-related hospitalization, and surgery within  years of the initial visit.A total of 457 patients with UC were eligible for baseline analysis. Major polypharmacy was identified in 29.8% of patients, and minor polypharmacy was identified in 40.9% of the population. Polypharmacy at baseline was associated with advanced age (P< 0.001), female sex (P= 0.019), functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders (P< 0.001), and psychiatric  (P< 0.001). Over  years of follow-up, 265 patients remained eligible for analysis. After adjusting for age, sex, functional GI disorders, and psychiatric , major polypharmacy was found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of  flare (odds ratio, 4.00; 95% confidence interval, 1.66-9.62). However, major polypharmacy was not associated with the risk of therapy escalation, hospitalization, or surgery.Polypharmacy from non- medications was present in a substantial proportion of adult patients with UC and was associated with an increased risk of  flare.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634223>An Extraordinary Complication in a Child With Combined Familial Mediterranean Fever and : Multiple Ileal Perforations.</a></h1><p>Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a recurrent  with autosomal recessive trait and fever that is generally self-limiting.

Telemedicine-based health services may potentially bridge gaps in access to gastroenterologists in remote and underserved areas.We conducted a needs assessment for IBD specialist care in Ontario using health administrative data. As part of a separate initiative to address geographic disparities in access to care, we described the development and implementation of our Promoting Access and Care through Centres of Excellence (PACE) Telemedicine Program. Over the first 18 months, we measured wait times and potential cost savings.We found substantial deficiencies in specialist care early in the course of IBD and continuous IBD care in regions where the number of gastroenterologists per capita were low. The PACE Telemedicine Program enabled new IBD consultations within a median time of 17 days (interquartile range [IQR], 7-32 days) and visits for active IBD symptoms with a median time of 8. days (IQR, 4-14 days). Forty-five percent of new consultations and 83% of patients with active IBD symptoms were seen within the target wait time of two weeks. Telemedicine services resulted in an estimated cost savings of $47,565 among individuals who qualified for Ontario's Northern Travel Grant.The implementation of telemedicine services for IBD is highly feasible and can reduce wait times to see gastroenterologists that meet nationally recommended targets and can lead to cost savings.© The Author(s) 2018.

PubMed was searched for original articles, published between 2007 and 2017, in Italian or English. The search string consisted of a combination of free text and MeSH terms with a common part that focused on HADs and a -specific part. All identified papers were screened by two independent reviewers; exclusion criteria were the following: no details of algorithms reported, algorithm not developed in the Italian context, exclusive use of data from the death certificate register, or from general practitioner or pediatrician databases. Pertinent papers were classified according to the objective for which the algorithm had been used, and only articles that used algorithms for primary objectives (I  occurrence, II population/cohort selection, III outcome identification) were considered for algorithm extraction. The HADs used (hospital discharge records, drug prescriptions, etc.), ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes, ATC classification of drugs, followback periods, and age ranges applied by the algorithms have been reported. Further information on specific objective(s), accuracy measures, sensitivity analyses and the contribution of each HAD, have also been recorded.the search string led to the identification of 98 articles for IBD, 42 articles for CD, and 390 for CKD. By screening the references, one paper for IBD was added. Finally, this led to , 9, and 8 pertinent papers respectively for IBD, CD, and CKD. Considering the papers on IBD and CD, specific age selections were applied to focus on children and young adult populations. When a selection on age was applied for CKD, instead, it mostly considered individuals aged more than 18 years. Three algorithms for IBD, 4 for CD, and  for CKD were extracted from papers and characterized. Drug prescription databases were used for both IBD and CKD algorithms, whereas the hospital discharge database and co-payment exemption database were used for IBD and CD. Pathology records and specialist visit databases were also used for CD and CKD, respectively. For each  only one algorithm applied criteria for the exclusion of prevalent cases. External validation was performed only for Crohn's  among IBDs, in one algorithm.the results of this review indicate that case identification for IBD and CD from routinely collected data can be considered feasible and can be used to perform different kinds of epidemiological studies. The same is not true for CKD, which requires further efforts, mainly to improve the detection of early stage patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560755>Incidence, Duration, and Management of Anemia: A Nationwide Comparison Between IBD and Non-IBD Populations.</a></h1><p>Although the prevalence of anemia has been extensively studied in the  (IBD) population, no study has evaluated the duration of time IBD patients remain anemic over the course of their . Our aims were to determine the incidence, duration of anemia, and rate of receipt of iron therapy among IBD patients and compare these with non-IBD patients.We conducted a retrospective nationwide cohort study among the US veteran population from January 2011 to September 2018.  patients who were not anemic at the time of first IBD medication were included and matched with non-IBD patients. We estimated the incidence of anemia, duration of time patients spent in an anemic state per year, and rate of anemia treatment among IBD and matched non-IBD patients.A total of 3114 IBD patients were included and matched to 5568 non-IBD patients. The incidence rate of anemia was 92.75 per 1000 person-years in the IBD group vs 51.18 per 1000 person-years in the non-IBD group. The mean (SD) number of anemia days per year in the IBD and non-IBD groups was 52. (82.1) and 27.3 (62.4), respectively (P ≤ 0.001). Although anemic IBD patients were more likely to receive iron therapy compared with non-IBD anemic patients, only 37% and 2.8% of anemic IBD patients received oral or intravenous iron therapy during follow-up, respectively. patients spent almost 2 months of each year of follow-up in an anemic state.

Anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNF-α) therapy alters the gut microbiota in many , including . However, little is known about the effect of TNF-α blocker treatment on the gut microbiota in ankylosing spondylitis. Herein, the effect of a TNF-α blocker on the gut microbiota in proteoglycan-induced arthritis was investigated. Proteoglycan-induced mice were treated with an rhTNFR:Fc solution of etanercept ( µg/g) for 4 weeks. rhTNFR:Fc treatment attenuated the arthritis incidence and severity of arthritis in the proteoglycan-induced mice and decreased inflammation in the ankle joints and ameliorated ileal tissue destruction. Moreover, high gut permeability occurred, and zonula occludens-1 and occludin protein levels were reduced in proteoglycan-induced mice. These levels were significantly restored by the administration of rhTNFR:Fc. The serum TNF-α and IL-17 levels were also decreased. In addition, flora analysis via 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing revealed that rhTNFR:Fc treatment restored the gut microbiota composition to a composition similar to that in control mice. In conclusion, anti-TNF-α therapy attenuated proteoglycan-induced arthritis progression and modulated the gut microbiota and intestinal barrier function. These results provide new insights for anti-TNF-α therapy strategies via regulating the gut microbiota in ankylosing spondylitis.© 2019 The Authors.

However, few studies have been conducted to investigate whether IN is effective even in treatment-refractory cases, such as in those with steroid dependency and anti-TNF refractoriness.In the INDIGO study, 86 patients with active UC were randomly assigned to an IN group (0.-2.0 g daily) or placebo group. The rate of clinical response (CR), mucosal healing (MH), and change in fecal calprotectin (FCP) levels was compared between refractory [patients with steroid-dependent , previous use of anti-TNF-α, and concomitant use of immunomodulators (IM)] and non-refractory patients. We also analyzed factors predicting CR and MH at week 8.The rates of CR of IN group were significantly higher than placebo group, even in patients with steroid-dependent  (p < 0.001), previous use of anti-TNF-α (p = 0.002), and concomitant use of IM (p = 0.013). The rates of MH in IN group were significantly higher than in placebo group in patients with steroid-dependent  (p = 0.009). In the IN group, median FCP levels, at week 8, were significantly lower than baseline in patients with steroid-dependent  and patients with the previous use of anti-TNF-α (p < 0.001, respectively). Multivariate analysis indicated that the previous use of anti-TNF-α was not a predictive factor for CR and MH at week 8.In a sub-analysis of data from a randomized placebo-controlled trial, we found that IN may be useful even in patients with steroid-dependent  and patients with the previous use of anti-TNF-α.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624757>Hair regrowth following fecal microbiota transplantation in an elderly patient with alopecia areata: A case report and review of the literature.</a></h1><p>Alopecia areata is a hair loss  associated with genetics, autoimmunity, and other factors. There is an intriguing link between alopecia areata and gut dysbiosis. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been recommended to treat  (previously known as ) infection, and has also shown potentials in the treatment of , irritable  syndrome, and non-alcohol fatty liver .An 86-year-old man, with a history of sigmoid colon carcinoma, suffered from recurrent abdominal pain and distension, and diarrhea for six months, with inappetence. At admission, he was also diagnosed with depression. Upon physical examination, the patient presented with a 1. cm × 2.0 cm alopecia areata on his right occiput. Due to the negative results of laboratory testing, capsule endoscopy, and colonoscopy, the patient was diagnosed with noninfectious diarrhea, depressive disorder, and patchy alopecia areata. Considering that noninfectious diarrhea in the elderly patient was mainly caused by gut dysbiosis, he was given six rounds of FMT. His diarrhea improved remarkably one month after FMT, with improved appetite and disappearance of abdominal pain, distension, and depressive symptoms. Surprisingly, he reported new hair growth on the affected region of his scalp, with some of his white hair gradually turning to black, without taking any other therapies for alopecia areata before and after FMT.FMT might act as a potential therapy for patients who suffer from alopecia areata. Large and well-designed studies are required to confirm the role of FMT in alopecia areata.©The Author(s) 2019. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

Forty patients were randomized in two study arms, in which  purgation was performed either before or after PET-MR enterography. All patients underwent ileocolonoscopy with mucosal biopsies after PET-MR within 24 h. Diagnostic performance of MR morphological parameters (MRmorph), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and PET in detecting histological inflammation determined by the Nancy index was compared with each other and between study arms. Correlation between PET and histological  severity was calculated.In study arm without previous  purgation, SUV ratio of  segment (relative to SUV of the liver) facilitated the highest specificity and diagnostic accuracy compared with MRmorph and DWI.  cleansing led to markedly increased metabolic activity of  segments, resulting in significantly reduced specificity of PET compared with study arm without purgation (0.808 vs. 0.966, p = 0.007, respectively). Inter-observer concordance for assessing MRmorph was clearly increased after  cleansing (Cohen's κ, 0.847 vs. 0.665; p = 0.013, respectively), though diagnostic performance of MRmorph was not significantly improved. Our findings suggested that the change of metabolic status was mainly associated with the grade of neutrophil infiltrate and less dependent on chronic infiltrate.PET-MR enterography was an excellent non-invasive diagnostic method in the assessment of histological active inflammation in ulcerative colitis without the need of previous  purgation.https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31536670>Reversal of Hartmann's procedure in patients following failed colorectal or coloanal anastomosis: an analysis of 45 consecutive cases.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to assess outcomes of Hartmann's reversal (HR) after failure of previous colorectal anastomosis (CRA) or coloanal anastomosis (CAA).All patients planned for HR from 1997 to 2018 following the failure of previous CRA or CAA were included.From 1997 to 2018, 45 HRs were planned following failed CRA or CAA performed for rectal cancer (n = 19, 42%), diverticulitis (n = 16, 36%), colon cancer (n = 4, 9%),  (n = 2, 4%) or other aetiologies (n = 4, 9%).

Fecal calprotectin is commonly used to diagnose  (IBD) and has an average sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 96%. For diagnosing pediatric IBD, calprotectin fecal tests have similar sensitivity (92%) but substantially less specificity (76%). Low specificity, especially in pediatric patients, means a high likelihood of false negative diagnoses, suggesting that a substantial number of active IBD cases remain undiagnosed and untreated. To improve on calprotectin as an effective IBD monitoring tool in pediatric populations, specificity must be increased. To develop an assay with higher specificity in pediatric patients, we identified a panel of multiple proteins that are present in both IBD flare and remission but have distinct abundance ranges between each condition. From a pilot cohort of 10 pediatric patients in states of either active  or remission, we discovered and relatively quantified hundreds of stool proteins.

Traditionally. bismuth compounds have been administered to alleviate gastrointestinal discomfort and  symptoms. One mechanism by which this treatment occurs is through binding bacterial derived hydrogen sulfide in the intestines. With the addition of bismuth-deferiprone, bismuth-citrate and bismuth subsalicylate to reactions containing cells of D. desulfuricans ATCC 27774, the oxidation of H with sulfate as the electron acceptor was inhibited but H oxidation with nitrate, nitrite and sulfite was not reduced. Our research suggests that a target for bismuth inhibition of D. desulfuricans is the F subunit of the ATP synthase and, thus, dissimilatory sulfate reduction does not occur. At sublethal concentrations, bismuth as Bi(III) is precipitated by hydrogen sulfide produced from respiratory sulfate reduction by D. desulfuricans. Nanocrystals of bismuth sulfide were determined to be BiS through the use of high resolution transmission electron microscopy imaging with X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy analysis. In the absence of sulfate, D. desulfuricans oxidizes H with the reduction of Bi(III) to Bi and this was also established by X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy analysis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634546>Leukocyte-specific siRNA delivery revealing IRF8 as a potential anti- target.</a></h1><p>Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) protein plays a critical role in the differentiation, polarization, and activation of mononuclear phagocytic cells. In light of previous studies, we explored the therapeutic potential of IRF8 inhibition as immunomodulatory therapy for  (IBD). To this end, we utilized siRNA-loaded lipid-based nanoparticles (siLNPs) and demonstrated a ∼90% reduction of IRF8 mRNA levels in vitro (PV < 0.0001), alongside a notable reduction in IRF8 protein. Moreover, silencing IRF8 ex vivo in splenocytes lead to a profound downregulation of IRF8 protein, followed by an immunomodulatory effect, as represented by a decrease in the secretion of TNFα, IL6 and IL12/IL23 (IL12p40) proinflammatory cytokines (PV = 0.0045, 0.0330, <0.0001, respectively). In order to silence IRF8 in vivo, selectively in  leukocytes, we used siLNPs that were coated with anti-Ly6C antibodies via our recently published ASSET targeting approach. Through this strategy, we have demonstrated a selective binding of the targeted-LNPs (T-LNPs) to Ly6C +  leukocytes. Finally, an immunomodulatory effect was demonstrated in vivo in an IBD mouse model with a profound decrease of TNFα, IL6, IL12/IL23, and IL1β pro- cytokines (n = , PV < 0.0001, <0.0001, <0.0001, 0.02, respectively) and an improvement of colon-morphology as assessed by colon-length measurements and colonoscopy (PV < 0.0001). Overall, using antibody-targeted siLNPs, we showed a notable reduction of IRF8 mRNA and protein and demonstrated a targeted immunomodulation therapeutic effect ex vivo and in vivo, in the DSS colitis model. We claim that a selective silencing of IRF8 in  leukocytes (such as Ly6C+) may serve as a therapeutic approach for treating  disorders.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Results The proportion of UC patients with acute massive LGIB was 0.7% among all 1486 UC patients hospitalized during the study period.The  was moderately or severely active in these 11 patients,among whom 9 patients(81.8%)had chronic relapsing pancolitis.Cytomegalovirus infection was present in  patients,among whom 4 patients received antiviral treatments.All the 11 patients received treatments including food and water fasting,rehydration,blood transfusion,and use of somatostatin.Four patients received emergency surgical treatment after the first episode of massive bleeding,and 3 of them suffered from re-bleeding after the surgery.Among the remaining seven patients,two underwent emergency total colectomy+subtotal rectectomy+ileostomy and three received elective total resection of colon and rectum or total colectomy+subtotal rectectomy+ileostomy.Thus,9 patients underwent emergency surgery,1 patient did not receive surgey during follow-up,and 1 patient was lost to follow-up. Conclusions Acute massive LGIB is a manifestation of active UC and can be associated with poor prognosis.Optimized perioperative management is important for improving the outcomes of such patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31549893>Single Port Laparoscopic Total and Subtotal Colectomies for  in a District General Hospital.</a></h1><p> Single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is expanding, enhancing the advantages of multi-port laparoscopic surgery (MLS). Limited literature exists regarding SILS total/subtotal colectomies for  (IBD). Aim of the study was to present the initial experience with this type of approach in a district general hospital and extrapolate its feasibility and safety in this specific context based on gold standard outcomes reported in literature.  Preoperative parameters, operative details and surgical outcomes of consecutive patients who underwent colonic SILS for IBD in a -year period were reviewed retrospectively. Median length of follow-up was 26 months.  Fourteen patients underwent SILS subtotal/total colectomy. Median body mass index was 25 (18.1-35). Two patients had previous abdominal surgeries. Median operating time was 202. minutes. Two cases were converted to open. Median length of stay was  days. Three patients presented complications. Three patients developed parastomal hernias (21.4%). Five out of 12 patients with ulcerative colitis declined further surgery, 3 are awaiting laparoscopic/SILS pouch formation, 1 underwent SILS pouch formation, 1 SILS ileo-rectal anastomosis and 1 patient had SILS completion proctectomy. One patient was not followed up.  Despite literature data heterogeneity, these results provide support to the feasibility and applicability of SILS in the subgroup of patients who undergo subtotal/total colectomies for IBD, offering the option for subsequent SILS completion or restorative procedures. Further studies are required to explore the benefit of SILS over MLS (including cosmesis and quality of life) and non-inferiority of SILS regarding the parastomal hernia issue and the operative duration.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31526273>Plasma calprotectin is superior to serum calprotectin as a biomarker of intestinal inflammation in ulcerative Colitis.</a></h1><p> Despite promising results, only a few studies have been published on serum calprotectin as a biomarker in IBD. Recently, plasma measurements of calprotectin have been shown to be more reliable than serum measurements. In this study, we aim to assess plasma and serum calprotectin measurements as biomarkers of  activity in paediatric and adult ulcerative colitis.  Paediatric (-18 years) and adult (>18 years) patients scheduled for colonoscopy due to suspected or confirmed ulcerative colitis were included prospectively. Stool and blood samples were collected at time of colonoscopy and patient symptom scores were recorded. At colonoscopy the Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity was recorded. Histology was graded according to the Geboes score.  84 patients where included; 30 paediatric and 54 adult patients. Plasma calprotectin had a stronger correlation to all outcome variables than serum calprotectin. Plasma calprotectin correlated positively to  extent ( = 0.53,  < .0001), symptoms scores ( = 0.54,  = .002, only in the paediatric cohort), endoscopic scores ( = 0.39,  = .0003), histological scores (Rho 0.28,  = .01) and, when using endoscopic assessment of severity as reference, could discriminate active  from patients in remission ( = .03).  While more studies are needed to assess if plasma calprotectin can discriminate healthy individuals from ulcerative colitis, this study indicates that plasma calprotectin can be used as a biomarker of  activity, especially in cases where faecal calprotectin measurements are cumbersome either due to patient compliance or logistical requirements.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31553834>Vedolizumab versus Adalimumab for Moderate-to-Severe Ulcerative Colitis.</a></h1><p>Biologic therapies are widely used in patients with ulcerative colitis. Head-to-head trials of these therapies in patients with  are lacking.In a phase 3b, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized trial conducted at 245 centers in 34 countries, we compared vedolizumab with adalimumab in adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis to determine whether vedolizumab was superior. Previous exposure to a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor other than adalimumab was allowed in up to 25% of patients. The patients were assigned to receive infusions of 300 mg of vedolizumab on day 1 and at weeks 2, 6, 14, 22, 30, 38, and 46 (plus injections of placebo) or subcutaneous injections of 40 mg of adalimumab, with a total dose of 160 mg at week 1, 80 mg at week 2, and 40 mg every 2 weeks thereafter until week 50 (plus infusions of placebo). Dose escalation was not permitted in either group. The primary outcome was clinical remission at week 52 (defined as a total score of ≤2 on the Mayo scale [range, 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe ] and no subscore >1 [range, 0 to 3] on any of the four Mayo scale components). To control for type I error, efficacy outcomes were analyzed with a hierarchical testing procedure, with the variables in the following order: clinical remission, endoscopic improvement (subscore of 0 to 1 on the Mayo endoscopic component), and corticosteroid-free remission at week 52.A total of 769 patients underwent randomization and received at least one dose of vedolizumab (383 patients) or adalimumab (386 patients). At week 52, clinical remission was observed in a higher percentage of patients in the vedolizumab group than in the adalimumab group (31.3% vs. 22.%; difference, 8.8 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2. to 15.0; P = 0.006), as was endoscopic improvement (39.7% vs. 27.7%; difference, 11.9 percentage points; 95% CI, .3 to 18.; P<0.001). Corticosteroid-free clinical remission occurred in 12.6% of the patients in the vedolizumab group and in 21.8% in the adalimumab group (difference, -9.3 percentage points; 95% CI, -18.9 to 0.4). Exposure-adjusted incidence rates of infection were 23.4 and 34.6 events per 100 patient-years with vedolizumab and adalimumab, respectively, and the corresponding rates for serious infection were 1.6 and 2.2 events per 100 patient-years.In this trial involving patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis, vedolizumab was superior to adalimumab with respect to achievement of clinical remission and endoscopic improvement, but not corticosteroid-free clinical remission.

A retrospective cohort study was performed. The data of patients who underwent laparoscopic low anterior resection for rectal cancer and ostomy using the auxiliary incision in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from January 2010 to December 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Inclusion criteria: (1) patient underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy before operation; (2) patient was classified as tumor stage II or III; (3) patient was followed up and underwent stoma closure at our center; (4) ostomy was performed through specimen extraction incision. Patients with multiple gastrointestinal carcinomas or  were excluded. Two hundred and eight patients were included in the study and divided into the LI group (=86) and LTC group (=122). The operation parameters and postoperative complications were compared between the two groups.  There were 135 males and 73 females (1.85∶1.00). Mean age of the 208 patients was (59.6±11.6) years (range 29-85 years). There were no significant differences between LI and LTC groups in baseline data (all >0.05). All of the patients completed surgery successfully. The severe complication rate after ostomy was 2.9% (6/208). In the fecal diversion period, LI group showed significantly faster defecation [(1.6±1.0) days vs. (2.2±1.9) days, =-2.918, =0.004] and lower incidence of parastomal hernia [8.1% (7/86) vs. 19.7% (24/122), χ(2)=.290, =0.021], but higher incidence of peristomal dermatitis [18.6% (16/86) vs. 4.9% (6/122), χ(2)=9.990, =0.002] as compared to LTC group. The incidence of renal insufficiency was lower in LTC group, though the difference was not significant [4.9% (6/122) vs. 10.% (9/86), χ(2)=2.320, =0.128]. The severe complication rate after stoma closure was 1.9% (4/208). In the stoma closure period, a significantly higher incidence of wound infection was noted in LTC group [18.0% (22/122) vs. 4.7% (4/86), χ(2)=8.258, =0.004]. There were no significant differences between the two groups in the incidence of anastomotic leakage, stenosis, and incisional hernia (all >0.05). All complications were improved after treatment.  Both LI and LTC through auxiliary incision following laparoscopic low anterior resection for rectal cancer are safe and feasible. LTC is an optional method for those patients with sensitive skin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31531732>Outcomes of  surgery in obese versus non-obese patients: a meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>Obesity is considered a risk factor for many chronic  and obese patients are often considered higher risk surgical candidates. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the outcomes of obese (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m) versus non-obese patients undergoing surgery for  (IBD).PubMed, Scopus, and Embase libraries were searched up to March 2019 for studies comparing outcomes of obese with non-obese patients undergoing surgery for IBD. A meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager software to create forest plots and calculate odds ratios and mean differences.Four thousand three hundred and eleven patients from five observational studies were included. Obese patients were older at the time of surgery and more likely to have diabetes. Obese patients had longer operative times (MD 23.28, 95% CI 14.63-31.93, p < 0.001), higher intra-operative blood loss (MD 45.32, 95% CI .89-84.76, p = 0.02), longer length of stay (MD 0.90, 95% CI 0.60-1.20, p < 0.001), higher wound infection rates (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.39-2.23, p < 0.001), and higher total postoperative complication rates (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.04-1.70, p = 0.02).Obesity is associated with significantly worse outcomes following IBD-specific surgery, including longer operative times, greater blood loss, longer length of stay, higher wound infection rates, and higher total postoperative complication rates. Clinicians should be mindful of these increased risks when counselling patients and consider weight reduction strategies where possible.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618654>Transcriptional Atlas of Intestinal Immune Cells Reveals that Neuropeptide α-CGRP Modulates Group 2 Innate Lymphoid Cell Responses.</a></h1><p>Signaling abnormalities in immune responses in the small intestine can trigger chronic type 2 inflammation involving interaction of multiple immune cell types. To systematically characterize this response, we analyzed 58,067 immune cells from the mouse small intestine by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) at steady state and after induction of a type 2  reaction to ovalbumin (OVA). Computational analysis revealed broad shifts in both cell-type composition and cell programs in response to the inflammation, especially in group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s). Inflammation induced the expression of exon  of Calca, which encodes the alpha-calcitonin gene-related peptide (α-CGRP), in intestinal KLRG1 ILC2s. α-CGRP antagonized KLRG1 ILC2s proliferation but promoted IL- expression. Genetic perturbation of α-CGRP increased the proportion of intestinal KLRG1 ILC2s. Our work highlights a model where α-CGRP-mediated neuronal signaling is critical for suppressing ILC2 expansion and maintaining homeostasis of the type 2 immune machinery.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Data on the effects of continuing -aminosalicylic acid (-ASA) treatment in patients who commence on biologics as maintenance treatment remain scarce. We evaluated IBD patient outcomes after continuation/discontinuation of -ASA when biologics were administered as maintenance treatment.We retrospectively reviewed the clinical, laboratory, and imaging data of patients diagnosed with IBD (ulcerative colitis (UC), 763; Crohn's  (CD), 537) in the Gil Medical Center (GMC) from February 2005 to June 2018. We divided patients administered with biologics as maintenance treatment into those who did and did not continue on -ASA and compared the efficacies of the two treatment options using the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards models.Of 1300 total IBD patients, 128 (UC, 63; CD, 65) were prescribed biologics as induction and maintenance treatments. The median follow-up period was 109. weeks. All cases were divided into those who did or did not combine -ASA with biologics as maintenance treatments. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the event-free survival (exacerbation of  activity) of UC patients treated with biologics and -ASA (n = 42) was not significantly lower than that of those taking biologics alone (n = 21) (log rank test, P = 0.68). The same was true of CD patients (n = 42, biologics and -ASA; n = 23, biologics only) (log rank test, P = 0.87).Continuation of -ASA after initiation of anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha agents did not improve prognosis in Korean IBD patients compared with that of those who discontinued -ASA during maintenance treatment, particularly in patients who experienced more than two  aggravations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474681>Oral Supplementation of Tocotrienol-Rich Fraction Alleviates Severity of Ulcerative Colitis in Mice.</a></h1><p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is characterized by damaged colonic mucosa and submucosa layers that are caused by excessive  reactions and oxidative stress. This study aimed to examine the use of tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) in mitigating damages caused by UC on the colon epithelium. Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC mice were treated with vehicle control, TRF, alpha-tocopherol (αTP) and -aminosalicylic acid (-ASA). Observable clinical signs, quality of stool, histopathological scoring,  and oxidative markers were assessed. Vitamin E levels of colons and plasma were quantified. Oral supplementation of TRF significantly reduced the severity of DSS-induced UC by lowering the  activity index (DAI) and histopathological  scoring. TRF also attenuated the DSS-induced enlargement of spleen and shortening of the colon. TRF has demonstrated marked anti- and antioxidative properties indicated by the attenuation of DSS-induced upregulation of inflammation and oxidative stress markers including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, myeloperoxidase (MPO), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA) and pNF-κB. These improvements were similar to that of -aminosalicylic acid (-ASA) treatment. In contrast, αTP did not demonstrate evident clinical and histopathological improvements. The superior protective effect of TRF may be ascribed to the preferential absorption of TRF by the gut mucosa. TRF alleviated the signs and symptoms of acute UC in murine model via the reduction of local  reactions and oxidative stress. These effects suggested that TRF could serve as a gut health supplement for preventive measures for UC condition in patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562236>British Society of Gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of  in adults.</a></h1><p>Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's  are the principal forms of . Both represent chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, which displays heterogeneity in  and symptomatic burden between patients and within individuals over time. Optimal management relies on understanding and tailoring evidence-based interventions by clinicians in partnership with patients. This guideline for management of  in adults over 16 years of age was developed by Stakeholders representing UK physicians (British Society of Gastroenterology), surgeons (Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland), specialist nurses (Royal College of Nursing), paediatricians (British Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition), dietitians (British Dietetic Association), radiologists (British Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology), general practitioners (Primary Care Society for Gastroenterology) and patients (Crohn's and Colitis UK). A systematic review of 88 247 publications and a Delphi consensus process involving 81 multidisciplinary clinicians and patients was undertaken to develop 168 evidence- and expert opinion-based recommendations for pharmacological, non-pharmacological and surgical interventions, as well as optimal service delivery in the management of both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's . Comprehensive up-to-date guidance is provided regarding indications for, initiation and monitoring of immunosuppressive therapies, nutrition interventions, pre-, peri- and postoperative management, as well as structure and function of the multidisciplinary team and integration between primary and secondary care.

It was found that treatment with JGT or -aminosalicylic acid (-ASA) alleviated the severity of colitis symptoms by suppressing  cytokine levels of IL-6, IL-12, and IFN-γ. The non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis of gut microbiome revealed that JGT groups were clearly separated from the DSS group, suggesting that JGT administration altered gut microbiota. The operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that were decreased by DSS but increased by JGT include  and . On the other hand, OTUs that were increased by DSS but decreased by -ASA or JGT treatments include Bacteroidales S24-7, Ruminococcaceae, and Rikenellaceae, and the genera , , , and .

We used bivariate and multivariable analyses to identify predictors of inadequate response to budesonide MMX.Ninety-six patients were treated with budesonide MMX. Before initiation of budesonide MMX 55, 35, and 8% were on aminosalicylate, immunomodulator, and/or biologic therapy or no therapy for UC respectively. While 54% (52/96) of patients responded to budesonide MMX, 46% (44/96) required a transition to prednisone. Patients who required transition to prednisone were more likely to be male (39 vs. 19%,  = 0.035) and younger at the time of diagnosis (median age 23. vs. 29.0 years,  = 0.034).

Our recent study demonstrated that lower body weight, lower peripouch fat, family history of  (IBD), female gender, and dyschezia are risk factors for FPC patients with IBD. The aims of this study were to assess the relationship between pouch wall thickness and FPC, and to investigate the association between inflamed and non-inflamed pouch wall thickness.This case-control study included all eligible patients with FPC from our prospectively maintained, IRB-approved Pouchitis Registry from 2011 to 2017. We measured pouch wall thickness of fully distended pouches on cross-sectional abdominal and pelvic imaging. Patients with stoma and non-distended pouches were completely excluded. Risk factors for FPC were analyzed.A total of 140 out of 451 patients from our were found to have fully distended pouches on imaging. Of the 140 patients, 36 (25.7%) were diagnosed as having FPC. We analyzed pouch wall thickness for each subcategory of FPC as well as non-FPC conditions. The thickness of pouch wall was follows: pouch prolapse (N = 19): 1. mm (1.-2.0), afferent limb syndrome (N = 12): 1. mm (1.1-2.0), folded pouch (N = 4): 1. mm (1.1-1.9), and redundant pouch (N = 2): 1.3 mm (1.0-1.3).

However, to date few studies have examined functional outcomes or quality of life (QOL) in elderly patients after pouch construction.In December 2017, we sent questionnaires to 224 patients aged 65 years and older at the time who underwent an IPAA at our hospital between June 1987 and May 2015 regarding issues related to QOL and functional outcomes. Responders aged 65-69 years old were defined as the elderly group (EG), while those 70 years old and over comprised the super-EG (SEG).The response rate was 60.7% (136/224); 70 patients were classified as EG, and 66 were classified as SEG. The SEG were older at the time of the IPAA and during the follow-up period (p < 0.01). The stool frequency per day was 8 times in both groups (p = 0.21). There was no significant difference between the EG and SEG with regard to daytime (53 vs. 56%, p = 0.73) or nighttime (65.7 vs. 53%, p = 0.16) soiling. There was also no difference in the exacerbation of daytime or nighttime soiling compared to the first year after the operation (daytime .7 vs. 12.1%, p = 0.23; nighttime 7.1 vs. 9.1%, p = 0.76). QOL was evaluated using the modified fecal incontinence QOL (mFIQL) scale, with no significant difference between the EG and SEG (27 vs. 31 points). Since both groups had mFIQL scores <50, QOL was considered to be maintained.In our analysis of elderly patients in the long-term period following surgery for UC, some noted fecal soiling, though QOL was largely maintained, and there were no serious effects on daily life.© 2019 S.

Biotin deficiency may be due to congenital lack of biotinidase, or acquired following some conditions that interfere with its absorption, such as   disorders, a diet too rich in avidin, magnesium deficiency, smoking habit and treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, anticonvulsants and sulfonamides. This review highlights the role of biotin in the most common skin disorders such associated with biotin deficiency and an approach to their treatment. Biotin administration may improve the treatment of hair loss when deficiency is detected on the basis of a careful patient history, clinical examination and the determination of serum biotin levels. The use of biotin is rationale in seborrheic dermatitis as the vitamin intercepts the main metabolic pathways underlying the pathogenesis of the . Treatment with biotin could also be useful in comedonal acne characterized by a high rate of seborrhea, and may be helpful for acne treated with topical retinoids, contributing to the control of flaking and irritation. The tolerability of biotin is excellent and there is no risk of hypervitaminosis even in the case of high doses. It is important that administration is controlled by physicians and follows a medical diagnosis and prescription. Correct doses used in dermatological conditions are safe and are not at risk of interference with laboratory tests.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31595533>Assessment of steroid use as a key performance indicator in -analysis of data from 2385 UK patients.</a></h1><p>Patients with IBD are at risk of excess corticosteroids.To assess steroid excess in a large IBD cohort and test associations with quality improvement and prescribing.Steroid exposure was recorded for outpatients attending 19 centres and associated factors analysed. Measures taken to avoid excess were assessed.Of 2385 patients, 28% received steroids in the preceding 12 months. 14.8% had steroid excess or dependency. Steroid use was significantly lower at 'intervention centres' which participated in a quality improvement programme (exposure: 23.8% vs 31.0%, P < .001; excess 11.% vs 17.1%, P < .001). At intervention centres, steroid use fell from 2015 to 2017 (steroid exposure 30.0%-23.8%, P = .003; steroid excess 13.8%-11.%, P = .17). Steroid excess was judged avoidable in 50.7%. Factors independently associated with reduced steroid excess in Crohn's  included maintenance with anti-TNF agents (OR 0.61 [95% CI 0.24-0.95]), treatment in a centre with a multi-disciplinary team (OR 0.54 [95% CI 0.20-0.86]) and treatment at an intervention centre (OR 0.72 [95% CI 0.46-0.97]). Treatment with -ASA in CD was associated with higher rates of steroid excess (OR 1.72 [95% CI 1.24-2.09]). In ulcerative colitis (UC), thiopurine monotherapy was associated with steroid excess (OR 1.97 [95% CI 1.19-3.01]) and treatment at an intervention centre with less steroid excess (OR 0.72 [95% CI 0.45-0.95]).This study validates steroid assessment as a meaningful quality measure and provides a benchmark for this performance indicator in a large cohort.

In the biologic era, it still remains the treatment of choice in mild-to-moderate UC. Positioning of this therapeutic class in moderate-to-severe UC is less clear. : Several studies demonstrated the ability of -ASA to induce endoscopic remission to a similar extent as anti-TNF therapy on the moderate segment of UC. Histologic remission is achieved after induction in up to 45% of patients treated with topical -ASA and 30% with oral formulations. Aminosalicylates offer a favorable safety profile compared to that of immunomodulators and biologics. High-dose -ASA therapy may be a valuable option for patients with moderately active , and physicians should weigh the pros and cons of this strategy in selected patients. Whether aminosalicylates should be continued in combination with thiopurines or biologic therapy remains under debate. : In the era of biologics, aminosalicylates remain the first-line therapy in patients with mild UC, and have to be considered in case of moderate UC, given their favorable risk-benefit profile. We suggest that -ASA should be used in moderate patients without poor prognostic factors, while biologics should be preferred otherwise.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650614>HLADQA1*05 genotype predicts anti-drug antibody formation and loss of response during infliximab therapy for .</a></h1><p>Anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) are a leading contributor to infliximab loss of response and adverse drug events.

Risk of infliximab ADA formation, infliximab loss of response, adverse events and discontinuation were assessed in wild-type (GG) and variant-carrying (AG or AA) individuals.Forty per cent of all participants were HLADQA1*05A>G variant carriers, with 79% of participants with infliximab antibodies carrying at least one variant allele. The risk of infliximab antibody formation was higher in HLADQA1*05A>G variant carriers (adjusted HR = 7.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.97-17.191, P = 1.46 × 10 ) independent of age, sex, weight, dose and co-immunosuppression with an immunomodulator.

Demographic, endoscopic, and pathological findings were collected. According to the age of the patients, they were divided into 0-3 year-old group, 4-6 year-old group, 7-14 year-old group and 15-17 year-old group. The patients were also divided into 2005-2011 group and 2012-2017 group, according to the time of colonoscopy.The cohort consisted of 326 patients, including 205 boys (62.9%) and 121 girls (37.1%). In the study, 31 patients (9.%) were in 0-3 year-old group, 28 (8.6%) were in 4-6 year-old group, 96 (29.4%) were in 7-14 year-old group and 171 (52.%) in 15-17 year-old group. The terminal ileum intubation success rate was 90.% (295/326). No serious complications such as hemorrhage or perforation occurred during the procedures.

Antibiotics represent the mainstay of treatment, suggesting a crucial role of dysbiosis in the pathogenesis of this condition. Anti-tumor necrosis factor agents have been shown to adversely impact the gut microbiome and local host immunity.The aim of this study is to assess the effect of prior exposure to biologics on the development of pouchitis in patients who have ulcerative colitis.This is a retrospective case-control study.This study was conducted at a tertiary-care IBD center.Consecutive patients with ulcerative colitis who underwent restorative proctocolectomy between 2000 and 2010 were included.The primary outcome measured was the incidence of pouchitis.Four hundred seventeen patients with ulcerative colitis who underwent IPAA were included. The incidence of pouchitis was 40.4%. There were no differences in patient demographics, -specific factors, surgical approach, and short-term postoperative complications between patients who developed pouchitis compared to those that did not. Patients exposed to anti-tumor necrosis factor agents or preoperative steroids were significantly more likely to develop pouchitis (anti-tumor necrosis factor: 47.9% vs 36.%, p = 0.027; steroids: 41.7% vs 23.3%, p = 0.048). However, on multivariable analysis, only anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy was an independent predictor for pouchitis (p = 0.05). Pouchitis was not associated with adverse long-term outcomes.The retrospective design was a limitation of this study.In a large cohort of patients undergoing IPAA for ulcerative colitis with at least a -year follow-up, anti-tumor necrosis factor exposure was the only independent risk factor for the development of pouchitis.

The aim of this study was therefore to quantify the prevalence and association between IBD and psoriasis.PubMed, Web of Science and EMBASE were searched from database inception through April 2018 for studies reporting data on psoriasis among patients with IBD and vice versa. Meta-analysis was performed to estimate, respectively, the prevalence and association between IBD and psoriasis. Data extraction was according to the PRISMA guideline, and quality assessment was made using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The main outcomes were the proportion of psoriasis patients with IBD and vice versa, as well as the association (odds ratio [OR]) of IBD in psoriasis and psoriasis in IBD, respectively.Based on quantitative analysis of 93 studies, the prevalence of psoriasis in CD and UC was 3.6% (95% CI 3.1%-4.6%) and 2.8% (95% CI 2.0%-3.8%) respectively, while the prevalence of CD and UC was 0.7% (95% CI 0.2%-1.3%) and 0.% (95% CI 0.3%-0.8%), respectively, among patients with psoriasis. Presence of CD or UC was significantly associated with psoriasis given by OR=2.0 (95% CI 1.4-2.9) and OR=1. (95% CI 1.2-2.0), respectively. Presence of psoriasis was significantly associated with CD (OR=2.2, 95% CI 1.6-3.1) and UC (OR=1.6, 95% CI 1.3-2.0).We found significant bidirectional associations between psoriasis and IBD warranting increased awareness among clinicians in the diagnostic process, especially in children and adolescents with IBD. Lastly, this study showed an increased frequency of paradoxical psoriasis in patients treated with biologics.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO).

This study was performed to determine the association between  wall thickness evaluated by water-immersion ultrasonography and macroscopic severity, namely, refractory inflammation and subsequent fibrosis in CD surgical specimens.  We retrospectively evaluated 100 segments of colon and small intestine from 27 patients with CD. The resected specimens were placed in saline postoperatively, and  wall thickness was measured by water-immersion ultrasonography and compared with macroscopic findings. Correlations between  wall thickness and macroscopic findings were assessed using analysis of variance and receiver operating characteristic curves.  According to the progression of macroscopic severity, the mean  wall thickness was increased as follows: macroscopically intact: 4.1 mm, longitudinal ulcer scars: .4 mm, longitudinal open ulcers: 6.0 mm, large ulcers: 6.4 mm, cobblestone-like lesions: 7.1 mm, and fibrotic strictures: 7.4 mm. For all lesions except longitudinal ulcer scars, the  wall thickness was significantly thicker than that of macroscopically-intact areas ( < .001).

However, whether miR-219a-5p is involved in the pathogenesis of  (IBD) remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrated that miR-219a-5p expression was significantly decreased in the inflamed intestinal mucosa and peripheral blood (PB)-CD4 T cells from patients with IBD. Proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, IL-12, IL-23 and TNF-α) inhibited miR-219a-5p expression in CD4 T cells in vitro. Lentivirus-mediated miR-219a-5p downregulation facilitated Th1/Th17 cell differentiation, whereas miR-219a-5p overexpression exerted an opposite effect. Luciferase assays confirmed that ETS variant  (ETV5) was a functional target of miR-219a-5p and ETV5 expression was significantly increased in the inflamed intestinal mucosa and PB-CD4 T cells from IBD patients. ETV5 overexpression enhanced Th1/Th17 immune response through upregulating the phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT4. Importantly, supplementation of miR-219a-5p ameliorated TNBS-induced intestinal mucosal inflammation, characterized by decreased IFN-γ CD4 T cells and IL-17A CD4 T cells infiltration in the colonic lamina propria. Our data thus reveal a novel mechanism whereby miR-219a-5p suppresses intestinal inflammation through inhibiting Th1/Th17-mediated immune responses. miR-219a-5p might be a target for the treatment of IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31541367>Comparison of Lewis Score and Capsule Endoscopy Crohn's  Activity Index in Patients with Crohn's .</a></h1><p>Small  capsule endoscopy (SBCE) is used to visualize mucosal  changes in the small intestine of patients with Crohn's  (CD). The Lewis score (LS) and Capsule Endoscopy Crohn's  Activity Index (CECDAI) are used to evaluate the visualized images. We determined the score disagreement between LS and CECDAI in patients with CD.We evaluated 184 SBCE procedures in 102 CD patients with small  lesions. Patients were classified according to the Montreal classification. LS and CECDAI were calculated, and cases with disagreement between the two scores were identified. We investigated the characteristics of disagreement, and analyzed the relationships with the Crohn's  Activity Index (CDAI) and C-reactive protein.LS (504 ± 1160) correlated strongly with CECDAI (6 ± .4) (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient ρ = 0.81, p < 0.0001). LS values of 135 and 790 were equivalent to CECDAI values of 4.9 and 6.9, respectively. The  changes by LS were significantly observed in several tertiles in the CECDAI discrepancy group (LS < 135, CECDAI ≥ 4.9) compared with the normal agreement group (LS < 135, CECDAI < 4.9) (p < 0.0001). In both groups, CDAI was also significantly different between Montreal L1 and L3 groups (p = 0.0232, p = 0.0196, respectively). LS inflammation score was 0 in six cases in the LS discrepancy group (LS ≥ 135, CECDAI ≤ 4.9, n = 10); the high LS scores were in patients with high stricture scores.Discrepancies between the LS and CECDAI scores were observed in some patients. Cases with high CECDAI alone exhibited extensive inflammation and high  activity (clinical symptoms and biomarker levels). CECDAI seems to better reflect active intestinal inflammation than LS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651657>Combining faecal calprotectin and sigmoidoscopy can predict mucosal healing in paediatric ulcerative colitis.</a></h1><p>Mucosal healing is the endoscopic treatment target in . The treat-to-target strategy, emphasizing proactive assessment and optimizing treatment, is commonly applied in the clinical setting. Although colonoscopies are essential for this strategy to be successful,  preparation and sedative drugs are required for paediatric patients. We attempted to verify the usefulness of sigmoidoscopy, which is less invasive than colonoscopy, combined with faecal calprotectin, to assess mucosal healing.A total of 58 paediatric patients diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and followed up at Severance Children's Hospital from March 2015 to May 2018 were enrolled. Clinical data and laboratory findings (including faecal calprotectin and endoscopic data) were collected from medical records. The predictive power of mucosal healing of sigmoid colon and rectum (s-MH) combined with faecal calprotectin to predict mucosal healing throughout the colon was analysed.Among 58 patients (mean age 16.13 ± 2.88 years), 18 (31.0%) were in mucosal healing status. The median faecal calprotectin level was 486. μg/g. The faecal calprotectin cutoff value for predicting mucosal healing, identified using receiver-operating characteristic analyses, was 148 μg/g (area under the curve, 0.81). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of s-MH in predicting mucosal healing were 1.0, 0.82, 0.72, and 1.0, respectively. When we combined s-MH with faecal calprotectin less than the cutoff value, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 0.56, 1.0, 1.0, and 0.83, respectively.For patients with a low faecal calprotectin level, sigmoidoscopy might be sufficient to assess mucosal healing.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619405>Increased risk of chronic myeloid leukaemia following gastric conditions indicating Helicobacter pylori infection: a case-control study.</a></h1><p>Based on a previous report of increased chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) risk following peptic ulcer, we hypothesised that chronic Helicobacter pylori infection could serve as a risk factor for CML.In a population-based, retrospective case-control study we used Swedish registry data on 980 CML patients and 4 960 age- and sex-matched controls to investigate associations between markers of previous infection with Helicobacter pylori and CML incidence.Previous diagnoses of dyspepsia, gastritis or peptic ulcers, as well as previous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) medication, were all associated with a significantly increased risk of CML (relative risks 1.-2.0 p=0.0005-0.05). Meanwhile, neither  nor intake of non-steroid anti- drugs were associated with CML, indicating that it is not gastrointestinal ulcer or inflammation per se which influences risk.The consistent associations suggest a shared background between gastric conditions and CML, and strengthens the case that Helicobacter pylori could constitute this common risk factor.As the aetiology of CML is practically unknown, and Helicobacter pylori could potentially be a therapeutic target, even this indirect evidence encourages further studies on the potential involvement of Helicobacter pylori in CML aetiology.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31550095>Tumour budding predicts increased recurrence after curative resection for T2N0 colorectal cancer</a></h1><p>Tumour budding is defined as the presence of a cluster of fewer than  cells along the invasive margin. It may confer a worse prognosis in colorectal cancer, but its importance in pT2N0 colorectal cancer is unknown. This study aimed to determine the prognostic value of tumour budding in pT2N0 colorectal cancer.This was a retrospective cohort study with prospective assessment of tumour budding by 2 pathologists. We included all patients who underwent elective curative resection for pT2N0 colorectal cancer except those with hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes,  or positive resection margins, those who received neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy and those who died within 90 days of operation. Patients were classified as having high-grade tumour budding (≥ 10 budding foci per high-power field) or low-grade tumour budding (< 9 budding foci per high-power field). The main outcome measure was locoregional or distant recurrence.Of 85 patients, 36 had high-grade tumour budding and 49 had low-grade tumour budding. The overall recurrence rate was 11% (9/85) and median follow-up was 41.0 months (interquartile range 22.0–68.0). Interrater reliability for tumour budding assessment was excellent (κ = 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76–0.96). There were more recurrences in patients with high-grade tumour budding (7/36, 19.4% v. 2/49, 4.1%; p = 0.020). On multivariate analysis, after we adjusted for confounders, the presence of high-grade tumour budding was independently associated with recurrence (hazard ratio .11, 95% CI 1.01–25.9).Tumour budding was independently associated with increased recurrence after pT2N0 colorectal cancer resection.

Chemically induced colitis models are relatively easy and rapid to develop. The 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) colitis model is one of the main models in the experimental studies of  (IBD) since inflammation induced by TNBS mimics several features of Crohn's . This review aims to summarize the existing literature and discuss different protocols for the induction of chronic model of TNBS-induced colitis. We searched MEDLINE via Pubmed platform for studies published through December 2018, using MeSH terms (Crohn .kw) OR (.kw) OR (Colitis, Ulcerative.kw) AND (trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid.kw) AND ( models, animal.kw) AND (mice.all). The inclusion criteria were original articles, preclinical studies in vivo using mice, chronic model of colitis, and TNBS as the inducer of colitis and articles published in English. Chronic TNBS-induced colitis is made with multiple TNBS intrarectal administrations in an average dose of 1.2 mg using a volume lower than 150 μL in 50% ethanol.

There are no studies on long-term outcomes of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for UC-associated neoplasia (UCAN). We aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of ESD for UC-associated dysplasia (UCAD) during long-term follow-up.We retrospectively enrolled 17 consecutive UC patients with 22 UCADs, who underwent initial ESD or total proctocolectomy at the Hiroshima University Hospital. The clinicopathological features of the patients and neoplasias and clinical outcomes of ESD were evaluated and compared with those of total proctocolectomy.UCAD in the ESD and total proctocolectomy groups was mostly noted on the left side of the colon, and most lesions were superficial macroscopic lesions. In the ESD group, en bloc resection and histological complete resection rates were 83 and 67%, respectively. One patient died of malignant melanoma; however, none of the patients died of UC-associated carcinoma in both groups. Metachronous neoplasias developed in  of the 7 patients in the ESD group. Among the  patients with metachronous UCAN, 4 finally underwent total proctocolectomy and 1 underwent additional ESD.ESD for UCAD is a useful method for total excisional biopsy. UC patients with UCAD resected by ESD have a high risk of developing metachronous UCAN during the follow-up period.© 2019 S.

A total of 961 patients were randomly assigned to receive an intravenous induction dose of ustekinumab (either 130 mg [320 patients] or a weight-range-based dose that approximated 6 mg per kilogram of body weight [322]) or placebo (319). Patients who had a response to induction therapy 8 weeks after administration of intravenous ustekinumab were randomly assigned again to receive subcutaneous maintenance injections of 90 mg of ustekinumab (either every 12 weeks [172 patients] or every 8 weeks [176]) or placebo (175). The primary end point in the induction trial (week 8) and the maintenance trial (week 44) was clinical remission (defined as a total score of ≤2 on the Mayo scale [range, 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe ] and no subscore >1 [range, 0 to 3] on any of the four Mayo scale components).The percentage of patients who had clinical remission at week 8 among patients who received intravenous ustekinumab at a dose of 130 mg (15.6%) or 6 mg per kilogram (15.%) was significantly higher than that among patients who received placebo (.3%) (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Among patients who had a response to induction therapy with ustekinumab and underwent a second randomization, the percentage of patients who had clinical remission at week 44 was significantly higher among patients assigned to 90 mg of subcutaneous ustekinumab every 12 weeks (38.4%) or every 8 weeks (43.8%) than among those assigned to placebo (24.0%) (P = 0.002 and P<0.001, respectively). The incidence of serious adverse events with ustekinumab was similar to that with placebo. Through 52 weeks of exposure, there were two deaths (one each from acute respiratory distress syndrome and hemorrhage from esophageal varices) and seven cases of cancer (one each of prostate, colon, renal papillary, and rectal cancer and three nonmelanoma skin cancers) among 825 patients who received ustekinumab and no deaths and one case of cancer (testicular cancer) among 319 patients who received placebo.Ustekinumab was more effective than placebo for inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.

Herein, we identify AP-1 as the transcription factor that directs most of this remodeling. Chromatin accessibility profiling showed quick opening of closed chromatin in naive T cells within  h of activation. These newly opened regions were strongly enriched for the AP-1 motif, and indeed, ChIP-seq demonstrated AP-1 binding at >70% of them. Broad inhibition of AP-1 activity prevented chromatin opening at AP-1 sites and reduced the expression of nearby genes. Similarly, induction of anergy in the absence of co-stimulation during activation was associated with reduced induction of AP-1 and a failure of proper chromatin remodeling. The translational relevance of these findings was highlighted by the substantial overlap of AP-1-dependent elements with risk loci for multiple immune , including multiple sclerosis, , and allergic . Our findings define AP-1 as the key link between T cell activation and chromatin remodeling.© 2019 Yukawa et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634390>Decreasing Colectomy Rate for Ulcerative Colitis in the United States Between 2007 and 2016: A Time Trend Analysis.</a></h1><p>Improved treatment approaches for ulcerative colitis (UC), including novel medications, might reduce the need for colectomy. We performed a retrospective cohort study of adult patients (age 18-64) with UC in the United States to examine time trends for colectomy and biologic use from 2007 to 2016.We estimated quarterly rates for colectomy and biologic use using the IQVIA Legacy PharMetrics Adjudicated Claims Database. We used interrupted time series methods with segmented regression to assess time trends with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for biologic use and colectomy before and after the emergence of newly available biologic therapies in 2014.Among 93,930 patients with UC, 2275 (2.4%) underwent colectomy from 2007 to 2016. Biologic use rates increased significantly from 2007 to 2016, from 131 per 1000 person-years in 2007 (95% CI, 121 to 140) to 589 per 1000 person-years in 2016 (95% CI, 575 to 604; P < 0.001). Colectomy rates decreased significantly between 2007 and 2016, from 7.8 per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 7.4 to 8.2) to 4.2 per 1000 person-years in 2016 (95% CI, 3.2 to .1; P < 0.001). An interruption in 2014 was associated with a positive trend deflection for biologic use (+72 treatments per 1000 person-years per year (95% CI, 61 to 83) and a negative trend deflection for colectomy (-0.76 per 1000 person-years per year; 95% CI, -1.47 to -0.05).Among commercially insured patients in the United States from 2007 to 2016, biologic use rates increased, colectomy rates decreased, and both trends were impacted by the interruption in 2014. These findings suggest that new biologic therapies may have contributed to decreased colectomy rates.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

The study parameters included SC, fecal calprotectin (FC) and conventional blood test parameters. Clinical indices (Harvey and Walmsley) and relevant endoscopic scores were completed for each scenario (Simple Endoscopic Score Crohn  [SES-CD] and Mayo).fifty-three patients were included in the study, 51% (27 patients) with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 49% (26 patients) with Crohn's  (CD). The CS values in UC were significantly higher with an endoscopic Mayo score 2/3 (median score 10.39 mg/ml [IQR: 7.4-12.2]) compared to those with a Mayo score of 0/1 (median 4.07 mg/ml [IQR: 2.9-7.2]) (p = 0.01). The area under the ROC curve (AUCROC) was 0.85 and the sensitivity and specificity were 83.3% and 81.25%, respectively, for a SC cut-off point of 4.4 mg/dl. Furthermore, a higher AUCROC was obtained in comparison with other serological markers for activity (C-reactive protein [CRP], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], hemoglobin [Hb] and platelets). There were no statistically significant differences in the comparison between SC and endoscopic findings in CD (SES CD > 3: 20.1 [IQR: 16.8-23.4] vs SESC ≤ 3:6.25 [IQR: .4-7.1]) (p = 0.8).SC is a good indirect marker of  activity and there was a correlation with endoscopic findings in UC.

We recorded data on GMA sessions, demographic characteristics, and clinical response. Effectiveness was assessed 1 and 6 months after finishing the GMA using the partial Mayo score, C-reactive protein, and fecal calprotectin levels. Data were also compiled on VDZ intensification, use of new immunomodulators and colectomy during follow-up.Eight patients were included (mean age 46 years; 63% female; mean  duration, 132 months; 50% E3). GMA was started after a loss of response to VDZ in all cases (25% primary nonresponse and 75% secondary loss of response). All had previously received anti-TNF agents. VDZ was prescribed as the second-, third-, or fourth-line biologic in 37%, 50%, and 13% of cases, respectively. Patients had a mean baseline partial Mayo score of 7. (SD 2.1) and received a median of 15 GMA sessions (range -38). After a median follow-up of 7. months (IQR -12), partial Mayo score decreased after 1 and 6 months (P = .01 and .06, respectively). Three patients (38%) achieved steroid-free clinical remission and five (63%) withdrew VDZ. Colectomy rate was 38%. No adverse events were observed during the combination therapy.This small case series suggests that combining GMA with VDZ could be a treatment option in selected cases of UC with an inadequate response to this biologic agent.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641874>Efficacy of enteral nutrition in patients with Crohn's  on maintenance anti-TNF-alpha antibody therapy: a meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>Enteral nutrition (EN) is effective in Crohn's  (CD) patients and has been shown to have an inhibitory effect on loss of response to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha antibody therapy; however, the current level of evidence is not sufficient. The objective of this meta-analysis was to determine whether EN in combination anti-TNF-alpha antibody therapy is useful in maintaining remission. PubMed was used to identify all relevant studies. A total of nine articles were identified including one randomized control trial, two prospective cohort studies, and six retrospective cohort studies. We performed a meta-analysis on all these articles to assess the remission maintenance effect of EN (n = 857). The remission or response maintenance effect in the EN group was 203/288 (70.%), which was higher than 306/569 (53.8%) in the non-EN group. The odds ratio for long-term remission or response using fixed effects model and random effects model were 2.23 (95% CI 1.60-3.10) and 2.19 (95% CI 1.49-3.22), respectively. The usefulness of EN was unclear in two prospective studies that were conducted immediately after remission induction with anti-TNF-alpha antibody therapy was detected. Differences in the definition of relapse and the observation period among articles were considered to be limitations.

The secondary end point was to provide characterization of incident cancer types.All incident cases of cancer occurring in IBD patients from December 2011-2017 were prospectively recorded in 16 Italian Group for the Study of  units. Each of the IBD patients with a new diagnosis of cancer was matched with 2 IBD patients without cancer, according to IBD phenotype (ulcerative colitis [UC] vs Crohn's  [CD]), age (± years), sex. Risk factors were assessed by multivariate logistic regression analysis.Cancer occurred in 403 IBD patients: 204 CD (CD cases), 199 UC (UC cases). The study population included 1209 patients (403 IBD cases, 806 IBD controls). Cancer (n = 403) more frequently involved the digestive system (DS; 32%), followed by skin (14.9%), urinary tract (9.7%), lung (6.9%), genital tract (6.%), breast (.%), thyroid (1.9%), lymphoma (2.7%, only in CD), adenocarcinoma of the small  (SBA; 3.9%, 15 CD, 1 pouch in UC), other cancers (15.9%). Among cancers of the DS, colorectal cancer (CRC) more frequently occurred in UC (29% vs 17%; P < 0.005), whereas SBA more frequently occurred in CD (13% vs 6.3% P = 0.039). In CD, perforating (B3) vs non-stricturing non-perforating (B1) behavior represented the only risk factor for any cancer (odds ratio [OR], 2.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33-4.11).

We investigated features of PSC-IBD in children, compared to children with IBD without PSC.We performed a retrospective study of 74 children with PSC-IBD, diagnosed from 2000 through 2018, who were each matched with 2 children with ulcerative colitis or IBD-unclassified (controls) based on sex, date of birth, and type of IBD. We compared IBD distribution and clinical activity (remission, medication use, hospitalization, or colectomy) and patient growth between groups. Data were extracted from each hospital contact and analyzed using mixed effects analyses or Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusting for time-dependent medication exposure.Higher proportions of children with PSC-IBD had backwash ileitis, pancolitis, and rectal sparing, and more severe right-sided , than controls (P<.05). Patients with PSC-IBD were more likely to be treated with only -ASA, compared with controls (odds ratio [OR], 3.04; 95% CI, 1.44-6.41) and to have IBD in clinical remission (OR, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.78-4.87). Risk of colectomy or treatment with a biologic agent was lower in patients with PSC-IBD than controls (hazard ratio, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.12-0.52). However, determination of IBD severity based on symptoms underestimated severity based on endoscopic activity in patients with PSC-IBD. Among patients with IBD in clinical remission, those with PSC were less likely to have endoscopic remission (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.20-0.96). Patients with PSC-IBD were shorter and had lower weight over time, compared with controls.In a retrospective study, we found that features of IBD differed between children with vs without PSC, similar to adults.

We included new vedolizumab users with Crohn  (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) between 18 and 64 years with ≥12 months of continuous enrollment prior to initiating vedolizumab. Outcomes included treatment persistence >14 weeks, late steroid use, IBD-related surgery and infections associated with hospitalization. We built multivariable regression models to identify predictors of treatment persistence and late steroid use.We identified 269 CD and 187 UC vedolizumab initiators. Only 60% of CD patients and 56% of UC patients remained on vedolizumab after 14 weeks without IBD-related hospitalization, surgery, and corticosteroid use. There were no significant predictors of treatment persistence. Steroid use in the first 2 months of vedolizumab initiation was a significant predictor of late steroid use in CD (odds ratio: 23.34; 95% confidence interval: .10-153.89). In the 6 months after vedolizumab initiation, 1.9% of CD and .9% of UC patients had an IBD-related surgery. Serious infections were <4%.These data reflect the early U.S. experience with vedolizumab. The population-level response to vedolizumab therapy is just >50%. Steroids at the time of vedolizumab initiation is the strongest predictor of late steroid use in CD.

We compared patient-reported and parent-reported perspectives.To evaluate the influence of IBD diagnosis on exercise and sports participation in a pediatric population.Consecutive IBD outpatients (aged 10-18 years) and their parents completed parallel voluntary surveys. A validated, patient-reported functional activity scale, the Hospital for Special Surgery Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (HSS Pedi-FABS) was used to assess children's activity levels.There were 149 completed surveys (75% response rate) with mean participant age of 16. years [standard deviation (SD) = 4.0] and mean age at IBD diagnosis of 11.8 years (SD = 3.4). Most patients (77%) were diagnosed within 12 mo of symptom onset. Current athletic participation was reported in 65% across 65 sports. Participation was greatest before (40%) rather than after (32%) IBD diagnosis, with no reported change in 28%. IBD negatively impacted play/performance in 45% but did not change play/performance in 44%. IBD treatment improved patients' desire to exercise (70%) and subjective capacity for aerobic exercise (72%). Patients and parents agreed that IBD subjects demonstrate normal capacity for aerobic exercise (0.40, 95%CI: 0.22-0.58) and that treatment improved both participatory desire (0.33, 95%CI: 0.12-0.54) and capacity for aerobic exercise (0.52, 95%CI: 0.31-0.71).

The role of traditional risk factors such as skin type and sun protection behavior has not been studied in this population. This study aimed to examine traditional KC risk factors and thiopurine use on skin cancer development in an IBD cohort.Consecutive IBD patients were recruited from four specialist centers in Australia and New Zealand, each with varying UV exposure indices. Data pertaining to race, skin color, freckling and sun protection behavior, dose of TP therapy, and skin cancer development were elicited through a self-reported questionnaire.A total of 691 IBD patients were included with 62 reporting KC development. Thiopurine usage was similar among patients who developed skin cancer compared with those who did not (92% vs. 89%, p = 0.3). There was no statistically significant association between KC development and TP dose or 6-thioguanine nucleotide levels. In multivariate modeling, four factors were independently and significantly associated with KC: age over 61 years old versus less than 30 years old (OR 6.76; 95% CI 2.38-19.18), residing in Brisbane versus Christchurch (OR 3.3; 95% CI 1.6-6.8), never staying in the shade versus staying in the shade ≥ 50% of the time (OR 3.8; 95% CI 1.4-10.), and having a skin type that never tanned versus other skin types (OR 6.9; 95% CI 2.9-16.0).Skin type, age, and sun protection behavior are more important risk factors for KC development than thiopurine medication use in this IBD population.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647207>Autophagy: A Novel Mechanism Involved in the Anti- Abilities of Probiotics.</a></h1><p>Deregulation of the complex interaction among host genetics, gut microbiota and environmental factors on one hand and aberrant immune responses on the other hand, are known to be associated with the development of . Recent studies provided strong evidence that autophagy plays a key role in the etiology of Crohn's  (CD). Probiotics may exhibit many therapeutic properties, including anti- abilities. While successful results have been obtained in ulcerative colitis patients, probiotics remain inefficient in CD for unknown reason. It remains therefore important to better understand their molecular mechanisms of action.The activation of autophagy was examined by stimulating bone marrow-derived dendritic cells by the bacteria, followed by confocal microscopy and western blot analysis. The impact of blocking in vitro autophagy was performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using 3-methyl adenine or bafilomycin followed by cytokine secretion measurement by ELISA. The role of autophagy in the anti- capacities of the bacterial strains was evaluated in vivo using an acute trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced murine model of colitis. The impact of BMDC was evaluated by adoptive transfer, notably using bone marrow cells derived from autophagy-related 16-like 1-deficient mice.We showed that selected lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are able to induce autophagy activation in BMDCs. Blocking in vitro autophagy abolished the capacity of the strains to induce the release of the anti- cytokine interleukin-10, while it exacerbated the secretion of the pro- cytokine interleukin-1β. We confirmed in the TNBS-induced mouse model of colitis that autophagy is involved in the protective capacity of these selected strains, and showed that dendritic cells are involved in this process.We propose autophagy as a novel mechanism involved in the regulatory capacities of probiotics.© Copyright by the Author(s).

Because these subtypes of IBD are characterized by periods of activity and remission, an understanding of the modulation of biochemical markers with the clinical features of IBD or its treatment, may be useful for determining the correct treatment protocol.This study aimed to evaluate the serum levels of 27 protein biomarkers to determine their association with IBD, correlation with clinical findings of , and modulation according to the pharmacologic therapy.A case-control study was carried out in Zacatecas, Mexico. The 27 protein profiles of serum from 53 participants (23 UC, 11 CD, and 19 controls) were evaluated using the Pro Human Cytokine 27-Plex immunoassay (Bio-Rad).Considering the controls as a reference, the group with IBD endoscopic activity showed higher serum levels of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), and platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) (P < .05). Interferon-induced protein 10 (IP-10) was associated with extraintestinal symptoms of  (P = .041). Both PDGF-BB and interleukin 6 (IL-6) showed the strongest correlations with clinical features of IBD. Levels of IL-6, IL-7, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 were higher with -aminosalicylic acid (-ASA) + Azathioprine therapy than controls (P < .05). Combined therapy with -ASA + Adalimumab led to the strongest changes in marker modulation: IL-4, IL-, IL-15, and PDGF-BB, were upregulated (P < .05).Elevated serum levels of G-CSF, IL-1Ra, and PDGF-BB were associated with IBD endoscopic activity, and of IP-10 with extraintestinal manifestations of IBD. Combined therapy of -ASA + Adalimumab produced significant upregulation of IL-4, IL-, IL-15, and PDGF-BB. This information may be useful for deciding on the course of pharmacologic therapy for patients with IBD and for generating new therapy alternatives to improve the outcome of patients with IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31553433>Mucosal Biomarker of Innate Immune Activation Predicts Response to Vedolizumab in Crohn's .</a></h1><p>Mucosal barrier dysfunction plays a crucial role in intestinal inflammation in Crohn's  (CD). Intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) death resulting from innate immune activation, termed pyroptosis, was recently found to be a cause of this barrier defect. The aim of this study was to determine the predictive value of pretreatment ileal biopsy pyroptosis as a biomarker for clinical response to vedolizumab in CD.Crohn's  patients ranging 18 to 80 years old from  IBD centers with pre-vedolizumab ileal biopsies during colonoscopy were enrolled. Biopsies were stained for activated caspases, and levels of ileal IEC pyroptosis levels were quantified. The primary outcome was clinical response 6 months after therapy, defined as a reduction of Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) of ≥ points from baseline. Secondary outcomes included clinical remission, defined as HBI <, and endoscopic improvement, as measured by the Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's  (SES-CD).One hundred CD patients (45 male, 55 female), median age 47 (19, 78) years, were included; clinical response rate was 60%, and clinical remission was 36%. The response rate in patients with ileal pyroptosis <14 positive cells per 1000 IECs was significantly higher than those above the threshold: 89% (25 of 28) vs 49% (35 of 72), odds ratio (OR) 8.8 (95% CI, 2.3-48.6; P < 0.001). Corresponding remission rates were 54% (15 of 28) vs 29% (21 of 72; OR 2.8 [1.03-7.59; P = 0.036]). For endoscopic improvement, ileal pyroptosis of 22 positive cells per 1000 IECs was the optimal threshold that determines the magnitude SES-CD change.Ileal biopsy IEC pyroptosis was predictive of clinical response and endoscopic improvement to vedolizmab in CD patients.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

The clinical data of 161 children with IBD was collected from the electronic medical records in the Department of Pediatrics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine from January 2012 to December 2017. These patients were divided into Crohn's  (CD) group and ulcerative colitis (UC) group, accounting for 82.0% (132 cases) and 18.0%(29 cases), respectively. The incidence of EIMs in each group was analyzed. The potential risk factors of EIMs including the IBD phenotype, gender, age, location of the CD lesion,  activity of CD, and the presence of perianal lesion were analyzed with logistic regression model.  Eighty-eight patients (54.7%) had EIMs. The main EIMs were immune-mediated EIMs and growth retardation, accounting for 41.0% (66/161) and 24.2% (39/161), respectively. Aphthous ulcer (39/161, 23.0%) was the most common symptom among immune-mediated EIMs, followed by arthropathy (20/161, 12.4%) and skin lesions (19/161, 11.8%). Forty-three patients (26.7%) had EIMs before being diagnosed as IBD. Fifty-eight (65.9%) patients had only one EIM during the whole course of IBD. By logistic regression analysis, CD (.536, 95:1.825-16.788) and perianal  (1.969, 95:1.035-3.746) were the risk factors of immune-mediated EIMs. Meanwhile, CD (11.319, 95: 1.487-86.179), younger than six-year-old at diagnosis (8.556, 95: 3.109-23.545), moderate to severe activity of CD (3.447, 95: 1.196-9.934) and perianal  (3.361, 95: 1.720-7.793) increased the risk of growth retardation.  The children with IBD have a high incidence of EIMs, which were more common in CD than in UC. The risk factors of developing EIMs include CD, perianal , younger than six-year-old at diagnosis and moderate to severe activity of CD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586971>Reasons for diagnostic delays of axial spondyloarthritis.</a></h1><p>Introduction: The probability of development of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is estimated to be above 90% among patients with chronic back pain, presence of HLA B27 antigen and positive family history of ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriasis, reactive arthritis,  or uveitis. The nonradiographic axSpA and ankylosing spondylitis ' activity has a comparable impact on the patients' quality of life and from the practical point of view the approach to treatment of each of them is the same. The aim: The attempt to identify the reasons of diagnostic delays of AS among patients hospitalized in the Rheumatology and Connective Tissue  Department in Lublin and to suggest the ways of improving the accuracy of diagnostic track among other healthcare providers than rheumatologists.Material and methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of the records of 82 patients' with the established diagnosis of AS, hospitalized in the Rheumatology and Connective Tissue  Department in Lublin in 2000-2019, and of 45 years of age and older.Results: From among 82 patients (28 women and 54 men) the diagnosis of AS after 45 years of age was established in 25 patients (10 women and 15 men) - group t, and in the other 57 patients (group n) the diagnosis was established before 45 years of age. On average the age at the time of diagnosis in the whole group (t+n) was 40,7±10,2 (18-76) years, the age at the beginning of  back pain (age of axial symptoms) was 30,9±8, (13-51) years and the diagnostic delay (period between first axial symptoms and diagnosis establishment) was 9,75±9, (0-46) years. We did not find any statistically significant associations between sex and age at the moment of diagnosis, age of the beginning of axial symptoms and the time of diagnostic delay. There was no significant difference of incidence of enthesitis, uveitis, arthritis, prevalence of family history of spondyloarthritis and CRP level between group t and n. Antigen HLA B27 was more frequently present in group t.Conclusions: Instead of the recognition progress and worldwide popularization of knowledge about axSpA, the diagnostic delays in this field are still estimated to last many years, the patients are looking for other specialists' help, and they can be not knowledgeable of the  back pain criteria. Currently, HLA B27 antigen and C-reactive protein are the two most commonly used biomarkers for diagnostic and  activity monitoring purposes of axSpA and magnetic resonance is the only "imaging biomarker".

The aim of our study was to validate "Good2Go," the first French-language transition readiness questionnaire. We analyzed the data from 2 multicentric studies (Canada and France) involving adolescents with chronic conditions (type 1 diabetes, , cystic fibrosis, epilepsy, juvenile idiopathic arthritis). Content and construct validity were examined using factorial and Rasch analysis (structural validity), Spearman's correlation, and Mann-Whitney test (external validity). Cronbach's α and intra-class correlation coefficients explored reliability. Cognitive interviews assessed wording comprehension and item appropriateness. Good2Go was completed by 321 participants (boys = 51%; mean age = 16.4 years (standard deviation = 1.; min = 14.0; max = 18.0); Canada = 51.1%). Factor analysis identified 3 domains: "health self-advocacy," "knowledge about chronic conditions," and "self-management skills." The 3-domain structure showed a satisfying Rasch fit, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability. Good2Go domain scores were significantly higher in participants over 17 years of age, indicating satisfactory external validity.Conclusion: Good2Go is a valid 20-item questionnaire to assess transition readiness in adolescents with chronic conditions and may be useful in routine care to propose individually tailored preparation for their transfer to adult healthcare. Further research is now needed to analyze correlation between domain scores and success of transition. What is Known: • In adolescents with chronic conditions, the use of transition readiness questionnaires is recommended to propose individually tailored preparation for their transfer to adult healthcare. • However, no French-language questionnaire has been so far validated. What is New: • Based on a complete validation methodology, this study highlights that the French-language 20-items Good2Go questionnaire has good psychometric properties. • It explores all transition key points though 3 scored domains: "health self-advocacy", "knowledge about chronic " and "self-management skills".</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31574072>-Related Worries in Persons With Crohn : An Interview Study.</a></h1><p>Crohn , a chronic , affects everyday life, impairs quality of life, and creates worries. This study explored -related worries in persons with Crohn  to gain deeper insight into how this worry is experienced and handled. Eight women and 4 men with Crohn  who reported their -related worries as high or very high in a questionnaire were interviewed. The interviews were evaluated by qualitative content analysis, generating 3 categories: worries about the  itself; feelings related to the worries; and management of the worries. The unpredictable course of the , impaired function due to fatigue, and lack of  control were the most prominent causes of worry. The worries created feelings of stress, guilt, and frustration. The participants expressed a need to talk about their worries, to make them visible and recognized, and to be understood. The participants found individual ways to handle the worries. Actively gaining control by changing focus, performing relaxation exercises, and seeking information were important self-care strategies. In addition, a strong and partially unmet need for expressing and venting concerns to one's caregiver was identified.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504542>Pedictors of Perianal Fistula Relapse in Crohn's .</a></h1><p>Despite an optimal medico-surgical management of perineal Crohn's  (PCD), fistula relapse still occurs in 30% of patients. Our aim was to determine predictors of fistula relapse in patients in remission after treatment of a PCD lesion.Consecutive patients treated for fistulizing PCD have been included in a retrospective study when they achieved fistula remission within 3 months after the surgery. Remission was defined as the absence of any draining fistula at clinical examination. Primary outcome was the occurrence of a fistula relapse, defined as a subsequent perianal draining fistula or an abscess confirmed clinically and/or by pelvic MRI.One hundred and thirty-seven patients (57% female, median age: 35 years) corresponding to 157 abscess events, including 120 (76.4%) treated by anti-TNF after drainage, achieved fistula remission after surgery. During the follow-up period (median duration: 43 months [interquartile range 26 to 64]), 34 (22%) patients experienced a fistula relapse within a median time of 1.8 years. Survival without fistula was 96.7% at 1 year, 78.4% at 3 years, and 74.4% at  years. Fistula relapse rates were not different in patients receiving infliximab or adalimumab (P = 0.66). In patients treated by anti-TNF at inclusion, discontinuation of anti-TNF therapy (odds ratio 3.49, P = 0.04), colonic location (OR 6.25, P = 0.01), and stricturing phenotype (odds ratio 4.39, P = 0.01) were independently associated with fistula relapse in multivariate analysis.In patients achieving fistula remission of PCD, relapse rates are low and are not different between infliximab and adalimumab. Discontinuation of anti-TNF therapy is associated with increased relapse rate.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

A total of 137 IBD patients, including 40 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 97 patients with Crohn's  (CD), and 50 healthy controls (HCs), were recruited. Serum food-specific IgG antibodies were detected by semi-quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and serum food-specific IgE antibodies were measured by Western blot. The value of food-specific IgG antibodies was compared among different groups, and potent factors related to these antibodies were explored by binary logistic regression.Food-specific IgG antibodies were detected in 57.% of UC patients, in 90.72% of CD patients and in 42% of HCs. A significantly high prevalence and titer of food-specific IgG antibodies were observed in CD patients compared to UC patients and HCs. The number of IgG-positive foods was greater in CD and UC patients than in HCs (CD  HCs,  = 0.000; UC  HCs,  = 0.029). The top five food antigens that caused positive specific IgG antibodies in CD patients were tomato (80.68%), corn (69.32%), egg (63.64%), rice (61.36%), and soybean (46.59%). The foods that caused positive specific IgG antibodies in UC patients were egg (60.87%), corn (47.83%), tomato (47.83%), rice (26.09%), and soybean (21.74%). Significantly higher levels of total food-specific IgG were detected in IBD patients treated with anti-TNFα therapy compared to patients receiving steroids and immunosuppressants (anti-TNFα  steroids,  = 0.000; anti-TNFα  immunosuppressants,  = 0.000; anti-TNFα  steroids + immunosuppressants,  = 0.003). A decrease in food-specific IgG levels was detected in IBD patients after receiving anti-TNFα therapy ( = 0.007). Patients who smoked and CD patients were prone to developing serum food-specific IgG antibodies [Smoke: OR (95%CI): 17.6 (1.91-162.26),  = 0.011; CD patients: OR (95%CI): 12.48 (3.45-45.09),  = 0.000]. There was no difference in the prevalence of food-specific IgE antibodies among CD patients (57.1%), UC patients (65.2%) and HCs (60%) ( = 0.831).CD patients have a higher prevalence of food-specific IgG antibodies than UC patients and HCs. IBD patients are prone to rice, corn, tomato and soybean intolerance. Smoking may be a risk factor in the occurrence of food-specific IgG antibodies.

A total of 27.3% of patients developed multiple sites of GIP, and in 31% GIP recurred after curative surgery. The 30-day mortality rate after relaparotomy was 40%. A history of previous abdominal surgery (odds ratio, 2.) and early post-LT relaparotomy due to other complications (odds ratio, 2.6) were significant risk factors for GIP. No thromboembolic or steno-occlusive complications of any splanchnic vessel were detected at computed tomography scan, while histopathology examination on perforated gastrointestinal segments excluded cytomegalovirus infection, graft-vs-host , and . In all the cases, ischemic necrosis with aspecific microangiopathy and microembolization were the pathologic features detected.GIP is a severe complication after LT with frequent multiple gastrointestinal involvement and recurrence after curative surgery.

We utilized the latest available country-specific incidence rates, and aggregate data for 20 determinants, from over 50 countries accounting for more than half of the global population. We presented the associations with exponentiated beta coefficients [exp(β)] indicating the relative increase of  incidence per unit increase in the predictor variables.Country-specific incidence estimates demonstrate wide variability across the world, with a median of 4.8 new UC cases (IQR 2.4-9.3), and 3. new CD cases (IQR 0.8-.7) per 100,000 population per year. Latitude [exp(β) 1.05, 95% CI 1.04‒1.06, per degree increase], prevalence of obesity (1.05, 1.02‒1.07, per 1% increase) and of tobacco smoking (0.97, 0.95‒0.99, per 1% increase) explained 71.% of UC incidence variation across countries in the adjusted analysis. The model for CD included latitude (1.04, 1.02‒1.06), expenditure for health (1.03, 1.01‒1.05, per 100 PPP/year per capita increase) and physical inactivity prevalence (1.03, 1.00‒1.06, per 1% increase) explaining 58.3% of incidence variation across countries. Besides expenditure for health, these associations were consistent in low/middle- and high-income countries.Our analysis highlights factors able to explain a substantial portion of incidence variation across countries.

Patients with active UC have elevated tumor necrosis factor (TNF) concentrations in serum and colonic tissue. Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody directed against TNF and binds with high affinity. Target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) is reported for monoclonal antibodies meaning that their pharmacokinetics are affected by high target affinity. Here, a TMDD model is proposed to describe the interaction between infliximab and TNF in UC patients. Data from 20 patients with moderate to severe UC was used. Patients received standard infliximab induction therapy ( mg kg) at week 0, followed by infusions at week 2 and 6. IFX, anti-drug antibodies and TNF serum concentrations were measured at day 0 (1 h after infusion), 1, 4, 7, 11, 14, 18, 21, 28 and 42. A binding model, TMDD model, and a quasi-steady state (QSS) approximation were evaluated using nonlinear mixed effects modeling (NONMEM). A two-compartment model best described the concentration-time profiles of infliximab. Typical clearance of infliximab was 0.404 L day and increased with the presence of anti-drug antibodies and with lower albumin concentrations. The TMDD-QSS model best described the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics data. Estimate for TNF baseline (B was 19.8 pg mL and the dissociation constant (K) was 13.6 nM.

Here we provide a real-world comparison of these two agents.We conducted an ambidirectional cohort study. Each patient included had moderate to severe active CD. Clinical response and remission were assessed between 4 and 16 weeks after induction.Of a total of 163 patients, 97 were induced with ADA and 66 were induced with UST. Logistic regression model analysis adjusted based on effect size showed that ADA when compared to UST induced clinical response (73.2% vs. 50% (odds ratio (OR): 2.40; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14 - .07; P = 0.02)) and remission (44.3% vs. 27.7% (OR: 2.35; 95% CI: 1.07 - .16; P = 0.034) in a statistically significantly higher proportion of patients. Among tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-naive patients, when comparing ADA vs. UST, ADA was superior in inducing clinical response (69/89 (77.%) vs. 4/10 (40%) (OR: 4.26; 95% CI: 1.08 - 16.84; P = 0.04)), but not remission (41/89 (46%) vs. 3/9 (33%) (OR: 1.64; 95% CI: 0.39 - 6.97; P = 0.503)). Among TNF-experienced patients, ADA was numerically inferior in inducing clinical response (2/8 (25%) vs. 29/56 (52%) (OR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.07 - 1.94; P = 0.24)) and remission (2/8 (25%) vs. 15/56 (27%) (OR: 1.22; 95% CI: 0.22 - 6.81; P = 0.82)), but neither of these differences were statistically significant.In a real-world setting, the rate of clinical response and remission was higher among patients with CD who received ADA compared to UST. Of note, however, despite the small sample sizes of TNF-experienced patients who received ADA and TNF-naive patients who received UST, the higher effectiveness of ADA in inducing clinical response and indeed remission among patients with CD with active  appears to primarily be driven by those who are TNF-naive. Among TNF-experienced patients, UST may be superior in inducing clinical response and equally effective in inducing clinical remission when compared to ADA. Based on this study, one may infer that among TNF-experienced patients with CD with active , one could consider switching to an agent such as UST instead of a second approved TNF blocker.

Three main histological subtypes of LP have been recognized: type A (histiocytic), type B (mycosis fungoides-like), and type C (anaplastic large cell lymphoma-like). Recently, new histologic LP variants classified as type D (CD8-positive, cytotoxic form) and type E (angioinvasive form) have also been described. The etiology of LP has not been determined to date (2-4). Herein we report a case of LP type B evolving in a patient with Crohn's  after treatment with infliximab and adalimumab. A 38-year-old man suffering from terminal ileitis form of luminar Crohn's  for 10 years presented at our department. During the last 10 years, the patient had been treated with a number of conventional -modifying anti- drugs including non-steroid anti- drugs, mesalazine, and immunomodulatory agents such as corticosteroids and azathioprine. As the  was not sufficiently controlled, TNF-α inhibitor therapy was initiated. Infliximab was administered in standard dosage ( mg/kg body weight every 8 weeks after the induction period) for one year. Concomitant therapy with azathioprine was established to reduce the risk of adverse immunological reactions. Since the patient showed only partial clinical response, infliximab was switched to adalimumab (40 mg biweekly), resulting in notable improvement. 18 months after the initiation of adalimumab treatment, asymptomatic, small, red to brown papules developed on the extremities. Multiple lesions were observed, initially on the legs, but the symptoms rapidly progressed to the arms and trunk (Figure 1). An acquired ichthyosis further complicated the  course by extended, extremely xerotic, scaling skin lesions. Neither systemic symptoms nor significant lymphadenopathy was observed. The clinical picture suggested either ichthyosiform mycosis fungoides or a coincidence of LP and acquired ichthyosis. The histology of a typical papule showed perivascular and periadnexal lymphoid infiltration with massive hemorrhage in the dermis. The infiltration was dense, composed of small-to-medium-sized lymphoid cells showing focal significant epidermotropism (Figure 2). Most observed epidermal lymphocytes were CD3+, CD4+, and CD30+, while the dermal infiltration had higher CD4 and lower CD30 expression (10-15%). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of skin and peripheral blood samples did not show clonal rearrangement of T-cell receptor gamma (TcRgamma) genes. Normal phenotypes of lymphocyte subsets were detected by flow cytometry of peripheral blood. Ichthyosiform mycosis fungoides was excluded since histology of ichthyosiform skin lesions showed only hyperkeratosis with a reduced granular layer. While the cutaneous CD4+ epidermotropic infiltrate was suspicious of either mycosis fungoides or LP type B, the complexity of clinicopathological data confirmed the diagnosis of LP type B. The peripheral blood counts, serum biochemical tests, and urinalysis were within normal range, while the elevated serum anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) of IgG and IgA subclasses indicated the activity of Crohn's . Adalimumab and azathioprine were discontinued, and oral budesonide therapy was started in combination with topical corticosteroids and PUVA phototherapy. The skin lesions resolved with hyperpigmentation, and there was no relapse during the twelve-month follow-up. Recent data suggest that LP occurs more commonly in immunocompromised patients, especially in those with solid organ or bone marrow transplants (3). Though TNF-α inhibitors have dramatically advanced the treatment of various , the risk of lymphoma associated with their use remains controversial (). Several cases of cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders associated with TNF-α inhibitor treatment have been reported, including two patients with LP (6). One of the two patients with LP received infliximab for Crohn's  (7), while the other one had juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and received adalimumab (8). Our case is the third report on LP developing under TNF-α inhibitor therapy and the first LP type B in a patient with Crohn's  treated with infliximab and later with adalimumab. A further interesting aspect of our case is that it also represents an example of the known association of acquired ichthyosis with  (9). Multidisciplinary management was needed to provide optimal care and  outcome for our patient. Since it is usually difficult to prove causality in most of such cases, it is important to collect similar clinical observations.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered the reference cross-sectional technique for the assessment of CD activity. Among MRI findings, layered pattern (LP) of contrast enhancement seems to be one of the most significant signs of severe  activity; however, it has also been associated with chronic  and mural fibrosis.To systematically evaluate the accuracy of LP of contrast enhancement in the diagnosis of active inflammation in patients with CD.In February 2019, we searched the MEDLINE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases for studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of LP of contrast enhancement on MRI for the detection of active inflammation in patients with CD. To be included, studies had to use histopathologic analysis (endoscopy or surgery) as the reference standard. Risk of bias and applicability concerns of the included studies were evaluated by using items from the Quality Assessment for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were determined using a bivariate random-effect model. Heterogeneity was quantified by using the   statistic. Our meta-analysis received no funding, and the review protocol was not published or registered in advance.Of the 1383 studies identified, five articles were finally selected for quantitative and qualitative synthesis (245 patients, 238 of whom had histopathologically confirmed CD, 144 with active inflammation and 94 with inactive ). The meta-analysis showed a pooled sensitivity of 49.3% (95%CI: 41%-57.8%;  : 90.7%) and specificity of 89.1% (95%CI: 81.3%- 94.4%;  : 48.6%). Pooled PLR and NLR were 3.3 (95%CI: 1.9-.7;  : 6.1%) and 0.6 (95%CI: 0.-0.9;   70.%), respectively. SDOR was 6.8 (95%CI: 2.6-17.6;  : 27.1%). The summary ROC curve showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.82 (SE 0.06; Q* 0.76). High risk of bias and applicability concerns were observed in the domains of patient selection for one included study.LP on contrast-enhanced MRI is a specific finding to rule out active inflammation in patients with CD. Further studies using a prespecified definition of LP on contrast-enhanced MRI are needed to support our findings.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31470175>Oral Curcumin No More Effective Than Placebo in Preventing Recurrence of Crohn's  After Surgery in a Randomized Controlled Trial.</a></h1><p>Recurrence of Crohn's  (CD) after surgery is a major concern. Curcumin has anti- properties and induces endoscopic remission in patients with ulcerative colitis. We investigated the efficacy of curcumin vs placebo in preventing post-operative recurrence of CD, based on endoscopic and clinical indices, in patients receiving concomitant thiopurine therapy.We conducted a double-blind randomized controlled trial at 8 referral centers in France, from October 2014 through January 2018, of 62 consecutive patients with CD undergoing  resection. Patients received azathioprine (2. mg/kg) and were randomly assigned to groups given oral curcumin (3 g/day; n = 31) or an identical placebo (n = 31) for 6 months, and were then evaluated by colonoscopy. We also collected data on CD activity index, results from laboratory tests, and answers to quality of life questionnaires during this 6-month period. The primary endpoint was postoperative recurrence of CD in each group (Rutgeerts' index score ≥i2) at month 6 (determined by central reading). An interim analysis (intent to treat) was scheduled after 50% of the patients were enrolled.At month 6, postoperative recurrence (Rutgeerts' index score ≥i2) occurred in 18 patients (58%) receiving curcumin and 21 patients (68%) receiving placebo (P = .60). A significantly higher proportion of patients receiving curcumin (55%) had a severe recurrence of CD (Rutgeerts' index score ≥i3) than patients receiving placebo (26%) (P = .034). We observed a clinical recurrence of CD (CD activity index score >150) at month 6 in 45% of patients receiving placebo and 30% of patients receiving curcumin (P = .80). Quality of life scores at month 6 did not differ significantly between groups (P = .80). Severe adverse events developed in 6% of patients receiving placebo and 16% of patients receiving curcumin (P = .42).In a randomized controlled trial of patients who underwent surgery for CD and received thiopurine treatment, we found that curcumin was no more effective than placebo in preventing CD recurrence. There were no significant differences between groups in quality of life or severe adverse events. The study was discontinued after interim analysis due to futility.

All records of consecutive IBD patients who started a treatment with an anti-TNF from January 2006 to June 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were defined as having LLR by the presence of immunologic abnormalities (positivity for ANA and/or anti-ds-DNA), along with clinical features that included at least two of the following: arthralgia, fatigue, fever, cutaneous manifestations, or serositis, which had a clear temporal association with exposure to the anti-TNFs, and resolved without recurrence once the drug was discontinued.  760 patients (1059 total treatments with anti-TNFs) were included. Participants contributed a total of 2863. person-years of follow-up, during which 16 cases of LLRs (2.1% of patients) were reported, accounting for an incidence rate of .6 per 1000 person-years. Female gender and being former smokers were more prevalent in the LLR group (75.0% versus 44.1%,  = .02; and 18.8% versus .4%,  = .037, respectively), with a hazard ratio of 4.40 (95% CI: 1.40-13.81;  = .011) and 4.87 (95% CI: 1.37-17.38;  = .015), respectively, at Cox regression analysis. All LLRs resolved following discontinuation of the drug after a mean of 8.1 ± 4.2 weeks. Ten patients required corticosteroids to control severe symptoms.

However, the magnitude of short stature at adulthood is not well characterized. We aimed to determine the prevalence and predictors of growth impairment at diagnosis and adulthood in children with IBD.Height z-scores at diagnosis of IBD and at adulthood among 291 children with Crohn's  (CD) and 125 with ulcerative colitis (UC) were retrieved retrospectively and compared to matched controls. Growth impairment at diagnosis was defined as height z-score for age less than or equal to -1 and short stature at adulthood as less than or equal to -2.Mean height z-score at adulthood in subjects with CD or UC was significantly different from controls although mean height did differ in males only (CD 172.3 cm ± 6.7, UC 172.7 cm ± .3, controls: 174.2 cm ± 7.3, p = 0.003 and p = 0.047, respectively). Diagnosis prior to final stage of puberty and male gender were risk factors for being short statured at adulthood in CD (mean difference [MD] 2., p = 0.013 and MD 6.25, p = 0.001, respectively) and UC (MD 4.9, p = 0.011 and MD 3.3, p = 0.034, respectively).Increased proportion of pediatric-onset IBD patients has growth impairment at adulthood.

We aim to describe the quality improvement (QI) methods used at our institution to improve post-induction therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) in children initiating anti-TNF therapy (infliximab and adalimumab) and describe the frequency of subtherapeutic anti-TNF levels.Beginning in February 2016, all patients initiating anti-TNF therapy were identified and tracked. Interventions to improve TDM, including the initiation of therapy plans for infliximab, real-time reminders for practitioners, and scheduling modifications for those initiating anti-TNF therapies were implemented using the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle approach. Statistical process control charts were used to demonstrate improvement over time. Anti-TNF levels and presence of anti-drug antibodies were also recorded.Using QI methodology, we improved post-induction anti-TNF TDM from a baseline of 43% in 2015 to > 80% by the end of 2017, with sustained improvement. Infliximab post-induction TDM improved from a baseline of 59% to 82% while adalimumab post-induction TDM improved from baseline of 14% to 79%. In total, 36% of all anti-TNF post-induction levels were less than  μg/mL, with nearly 60% of post-induction infliximab levels being less than  μg/mL.Through incremental QI approaches, we improved the utilization of anti-TNF post-induction TDM with sustained improvement, approaching our goal of 90%.

We aimed to investigate its effect on long-term drug retention and clinical outcomes in pediatric patients with Crohn's  (CD).The medical records of pediatric CD patients receiving anti-TNFα agents from 2007 to 2018 were reviewed retrospectively. Patients were stratified to those who initiated anti-TNFα treatment between 2007 and 2012, an era when TDM was not available (TDM-), and patients who initiated anti-TNFα treatment between 2013 and 2018, with at least 1 TDM during firstline anti-TNFα treatment (TDM+). The main outcome measures included time to first anti-TNFα discontinuation (drug retention), flares, and hospitalizations per year of first anti-TNFα treatment, treatment intensification rate, and surgical resection rate.One hundred ninety-seven patients were included (n = 98, TDM-; n = 99, TDM+; median [interquartile range] age, 12.6 [10.1-14.2] years; females 68 [35%]). Compared with the TDM- group, the TDM+ group had a longer drug retention time (mean ± SE, 45.0 ± 2.7 vs 33. ± 2.4 months; P = 0.001), lower hospitalization rate per patient per year (mean ± SE, 0.51 ± 0.7 vs 0.92 ± 0.81; P < 0.001), and higher treatment intensification rate (70% vs 18%; P < 0.001). Surgical resection rate was not significantly different. Analysis of the entire cohort showed a longer retention time for adalimumab vs infliximab (45.3 ± 2.8 vs 34.8 ± 2. months; P = 0.007).TDM-based treatment enables longer drug retention time, reflecting better utilization of anti-TNFα agents, with several additional favorable outcomes.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

These conditions can accelerate complement activation that results in a positive feedback cycle. The known triggers for complement activation can be diverse and include, infection, autoimmune , and malignancy. Recent reports suggest that certain autoimmune and rheumatological triggers of complement activation may result in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome that does not resolve despite treating the underlying disorder. Specifically, patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and microangiopathic hemolysis may not respond to treatment of their underlying rheumatological trigger but responded to complement blockade.We report two patients with  complicated by development of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. In both cases, patients were on treatment for , that was not well controlled/flaring at the time. The first patient is a male who developed Crohn's  and microangiopathic hemolysis at age  and was treated with eculizumab successfully. Discontinuation of the medication led to multiple relapses, and the patient currently is being treated with eculizumab and has normal hematological and stable renal parameters. The second patient is a 49-year-old female with Ulcerative Colitis treated with 6-Mercaptopurine. She developed acute kidney injury and microangiopathic hemolysis. Prompt diagnosis and treatment with eculizumab resulted in the recovery of kidney injury along with a complete hematological response.These two cases are the fifth and sixth patients to be published in the literature with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and  treated with complement blockade.

The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for nonadherence.This was a single-center retrospective study evaluating patients with IBD treated at a tertiary care center and prescribed self-injectable biologic therapy using the center's specialty pharmacy. Adherence was defined using medication possession ratio (MPR). Nonadherence was defined as MPR <0.86.Four hundred sixty patients (n = 393 with CD and n = 67 with UC) were evaluated with mean MPR (interquartile range) equaling 0.89 (0.48-1). Overall, 69% of patients were adherent (defined as MPR ≥0.86), 66% of patients with CD and 87% of patients with UC. In univariate analysis, several factors increased risk of nonadherence: CD diagnosis, insurance type, psychiatric history, smoking, prior biologic use, and narcotic use (P < 0.05). In multivariable analysis, Medicaid insurance (odds ratio [OR], .; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.85-15.6) and CD diagnosis (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.3-6.0) increased risk of nonadherence. In CD, as the number of risk factors increased (narcotic use, psychiatric history, prior biologic use, and smoking), the probability of nonadherence increased. Adherence was 72% in patients with 0-1 risk factors, decreasing to 62%, 61%, and 42% in patients with 2, 3, and 4 risk factors, respectively (P < 0.05).This study identified risk factors for nonadherence to biologic therapy.

Adverse event reports received between approval and 19-May-2018 were identified using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities version 21.0 Preferred Terms. Adverse event frequencies were calculated and categorized.In approximately 208,050 patient-years of vedolizumab exposure, 32,752 patients reported 80,218 events. In patients with Crohn's  and ulcerative colitis, 37,662 and 34,259 events occurred in 14,191 and 14,042 patients, respectively, while 8297 events occurred in 4519 individuals with other [off-label] or unreported indications. Overall, 5230 [14%; Crohn's ] and 3580 [10%; ulcerative colitis] events were serious. Most frequently reported were gastrointestinal events [Crohn's , 6156 (16%) ulcerative colitis, 5701 (17%)]. Patients with Crohn's  and ulcerative colitis reported 251 malignancies [<1%], 402 hepatobiliary events [<1%] and 5876 infections [1137 serious (19%), 301 opportunistic (%)]. Patients aged ≥70 years [2326 patients] reported <10% of events.Adverse event patterns were consistent with clinical trials, with no new safety concerns. Most reported events were non-serious and event frequency was low, considering patient-years of exposure. While limitations of post-marketing safety reports require acknowledgement, these real-world data support a favourable safety profile of vedolizumab.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO).

This study aimed to investigate the safety and feasibility of Endocuff Vision-assisted high-definition white light endoscopy (HDWLE) with dye-spray chromoendoscopy for detection of dysplasia in patients with ulcerative colitis.  Patients with clinically inactive ulcerative colitis due for dysplasia surveillance were recruited. Procedural endpoints included safety, cecal intubation rate (CIR), terminal ileum intubation rate (TIR), withdrawal time, polyp detection rate, dysplasia detection rate (DDR), and sessile serrated lesion detection rate.  Twenty-five patients (9 female, median age 57 [range 28 - 82] years) were studied. Endocuff Vision-assisted HDWLE was completed in all participants, with a CIR of 100 %, in a median 4 minutes (range 2 - 16), and a TIR of 88% in a median of 6. minutes (range 3 - 19). Median withdrawal time was 18 minutes (range 10 - 55), including application of dye-spray, biopsies and polypectomy. The Mayo Endoscopic subscore was 0 in 11, 1 in 9, and 2 in  patients. The DDR was 24 % (6 patients had a total of 12 dysplastic lesions) and sessile serrated lesion detection rate was 12 % (3 patients had a total of 4 sessile serrated polyps). No serious adverse events occurred, with one patient developing clinically insignificant minor mucosal bleeding.

Defects in such mechanisms can favour the development of chronic intestinal disorders, such as Crohn's  (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), the principal forms of  (IBD) in humans, as well as systemic disorders. Over the last years, the frequency of intestinal and systemic immune- disorders has increased in previously low incidence areas, likely due to the Westernization of lifestyles, including dietary habits. The Western diet is characterized by high consumption of proteins, saturated fats and sweets, as well as by a broad use of food additives (e.g., emulsifiers, bulking agents), which are used to preserve and enhance food quality. Accumulating evidence suggests that food additives can perturb gut homeostasis, thereby contributing to promote tissue-damaging  responses. For instance, mice given the emulsifiers carboxymethylcellulose and polysorbate 80 develop dysbiosis with overgrowth of mucus-degrading bacteria. Such an effect triggers colitis in animals deficient in either interleukin-10, a cytokine exerting anti- and regulatory functions, or Toll-like receptor , a receptor recognizing the bacterial flagellin. Similarly, the polysaccharide maltodextrin induces endoplasmic reticulum stress in intestinal goblet cells, thereby impairing mucus release and increasing host susceptibility to colitis.

According to the World Health Organization, anemia is defined as a circulating hemoglobin concentration of less than 130 g/L for men and less than 120 g/L for women. Iron deficiency is categorized as either absolute (iron deficiency anemia) or functional (anemia of inflammation, and also referred to as anemia of chronic ). Several factors may contribute to iron deficiency anemia such as inadequate iron absorption, and bleeding due to an underlying  condition. Iron is needed as a substrate for the bone marrow to produce erythrocytes. The prevalence of preoperative anemia varies between % and 76% depending on the age of the patient, the nature of the condition and the type of surgery planned; the prevalence being 26% for major orthopedic surgery, and 50% for cardiac surgery. Treatment options for iron deficiency anemia include blood transfusion, oral iron, and intravenous iron. Traditionally, the focus was on the use of blood transfusion to manage anemia in the preoperative phase. However, blood transfusion is associated with risks such as infection, transfusion reaction, postoperative complications, and extended hospital stay. Furthermore, blood transfusion may have substantial cost implications. Oral iron is inexpensive and easy to administer but is associated with gastrointestinal side effects such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation and dyspepsia which negatively impact compliance. Iron dextran formulations were developed both for intramuscular and intravenous administration, however due to the associated adverse effects, they were phased out. Since then, various formulations of intravenous iron (such as iron sucrose, ferric gluconate, ferrumoxytol, ferric carboxymaltose, iron isomaltiside) have been developed. These newer formulations have shown promise in treating anemia in a number of  conditions (such as , chronic heart failure and chronic kidney . There is some suggestion that intravenous iron may be a useful treatment option for iron deficient anemia in patients undergoing surgery. The purpose of this report is to review the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of intravenous iron preparations administered preoperatively, for iron deficient adult patients undergoing elective surgery. Additionally, this report aims to review the evidence-based guidelines regarding the use of intravenous iron preparations administered preoperatively, for iron deficient adult patients undergoing elective surgery (i.e., any surgery scheduled in advance of the operation).Copyright © 2019 Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633186>Excisional Hemorrhoidectomy: Safe in Patients With Crohn's ?</a></h1><p>Due to concerns over wound healing, hemorrhoidectomy in patients with Crohn's  (CD) remains controversial. We sought to ascertain safety and efficacy of excisional hemorrhoidectomy in CD.A retrospective review of all adult CD patients undergoing excisional hemorrhoidectomy between January 1, 1995, and January 1, 2019, at 2 IBD referral centers was performed. Data collected included patient demographics, clinical characteristics of CD (anorectal symptoms; prior nonoperative hemorrhoidal therapy; presence of other perianal ; and activity, duration, and anatomic location of CD), and postoperative complications including bleeding, wound healing, and need for further therapy or surgical intervention after surgery.A total of 36 adult patients with Crohn's  with symptomatic hemorrhoidal  were included. The study cohort included 16 males (44%), and median age was 49 (range, 21 to 77) years. Predominant symptoms included pain (n = 16; 44%), prolapse (n = 8; 22%), and bleeding (n = 12; 33%). Sixteen patients (44%) had nonoperative therapy before surgery. Twenty-four patients (67%) had other perianal . At the time of hemorrhoidectomy, 9 patients (25%) were exposed to corticosteroids, 8 patients (25%) to immunomodulators, and 9 patients (25%) to biologics. During a median follow-up time of 31. (range, 1 to 255) months after hemorrhoidectomy, 4 patients (11%) had complications (1 developed a stricture, 1 developed a perianal abscess/fistula, 1 had a nonhealing wound, and 1 had hemorrhoidal recurrence).Our data suggest that excisional hemorrhoidectomy may be performed safely in CD patients who have failed nonoperative hemorrhoidal therapy without concern for de novo perianal  or need for proctectomy.Hemorrhoidal  is common in patients with Crohn's .

A literature review informed clinical endpoints with data from peer-reviewed literature. Four thousand simulated CD patients were extrapolated from summary patient data from the Project Sonar Database. Two monitoring scenarios were assessed in this population. The first scenario represented common monitoring practice (CMP) for CD (ileocolonoscopy plus imaging), while in the second scenario patients were converted to  monitoring using SBC. The cost-effectiveness of using SBC was assessed over 20 years. The cost of switching 50% of patients to SBC was assessed over  years for a health-plan including 12,000 patients with CD. Uncertainty of results was assessed using probabilistic sensitivity analysis.All patient groups showed increased quality of life with SBC versus CMP, with the highest gain in active symptomatic patients. Over 20 years, SBC reduced costs ($313,367 versus $320,015), increased life expectancy (18.15 versus 17.9 years) and increased quality of life (8.7 versus 8.0 QALY), making it a cost-effective option. SBC was cost-effective in 71% of individuals and 78% of populations including 50 patients. A payer implementing SBC in 50% of patients over  years could expect a decreased cost of monitoring (-$469 mean per patient) and surgery (-$698), but increased costs for active treatments (+$717). The discounted mean annual cost of care using CMP was $22,681 per patient over  years. The annual savings were $1135 per SBC-patient. The total savings for the payer over  years were $36. million.SBC is likely to be a cost-effective and cost-saving strategy for monitoring CD in the US.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651515>Risk factors associated with progression to intestinal complications of Crohn .</a></h1><p>Crohn  is a chronic   that causes serious complications.

Here, we report an interventional prospective cohort study performed to elucidate the extent of and processes underlying microbiota engraftment in IBD patients after FMT treatment. The cohort included two categories of patients: (1) patients with moderate to severe Crohn's  (CD)（Harvey-Bradshaw Index ≥ 7, n = 11） and (2) patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) (Montreal classification S2 and S3, n = 4). All patients were treated with a single FMT (via mid-gut, from healthy donors) and follow-up visits were performed at baseline, 3 days, one week, and one month after FMT (missing time points included). At each follow-up time point, fecal samples and clinical metadata were collected. For comparative analysis, 10 fecal samples from 10 healthy donors were included to represent the diversity level of normal gut microbiota. Additionally, the metagenomic data of 25 fecal samples from  individuals with metabolic syndrome who underwent autologous FMT treatment were downloaded from a previous published paper to represent fluctuations in microbiota induced during FMT. All fecal samples underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We found that 3 days after FMT, 11 out of 15 recipients were in remission (3 out of 4 UC recipients; 8 out of 11 CD recipients). Generally, bacterial colonization was observed to be lower in CD recipients than in UC recipients at both species and strain levels. Furthermore, across species, different strains displayed -specific displacement advantages under two- status. Finally, most post-FMT species (> 80%) could be properly predicted (AUC > 85%) using a random forest classification model, with the gut microbiota composition and clinical parameters of pre-FMT recipients acting as factors that contribute to prediction accuracy.© 2019 The Authors.

Our aim was to evaluate the length of resected small  in patients undergoing elective and emergency surgery for ileocolic Crohn's .A prospective observational study was conducted on patients undergoing surgery for ileocolonic Crohn's  in a single colorectal centre from May 2010 to April 2018. The following patients were included: (1) patients with first presentation of ileocaecal Crohn's  undergoing elective surgery; (2) patients with ileocaecal Crohn's  undergoing emergency surgery; (3) patients with recurrent Crohn's  of the distal ileum undergoing elective surgery. The primary outcomes were length of resected small  and the ileostomy rate. Operating time, complications and readmissions within 30 days were the secondary outcomes.One hundred and sixty-eight patients were included: 87 patients in the elective primary surgery group, 50 patients in the emergency surgery group and 31 in the elective redo surgery group. Eleven patients (22%) in the emergency surgery group had an ileostomy compared to 10 (11.%) in the elective surgery group (p < 0.0001).

The sulfonamides were the first effective antibiotics to be introduced into clinical medicine and have been in use continuously since the 1930’s. They are considered bacteriostatic and appear to act by inhibition of bacterial biosynthesis of folic acid, which is needed for cell growth, at least in those bacteria that are sensitive to sulfonamides. Because humans rely upon dietary folic acid, they are usually resistant to the adverse effects of inhibition of folate synthesis. Sulfonamides have a wide range of antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive and -negative organisms. Unfortunately, bacterial resistance to sulfonamides is now common, and their use has decreased with the introduction of more potent classes of antibiotics. However, sulfonamides are still widely used especially for urinary tract infections in combination with trimethoprim and for treatment or prevention of parasitic (toxoplasmosis, pneumocystosis jiroveci) and malarial infections usually combined with trimethoprim or pyrimethamine. Sulfonamides with -aminosalicyclic acid are the structural components of sulfasalazine, which is widely used for long term management of . The combination of sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine is used as prophylaxis against chloroquine-resistant malaria. Dapsone is a sulfonamide related drug that is used for the therapy of leprosy and dermatitits herpetiformis. The sulfonamides are well known to cause idiosyncratic liver injury. Hepatotoxicity appears to be a class effect, in that virtually all sulfonamides used today have been linked to rare, but convincing cases of drug induced liver injury. The pattern of injury is variable, often mixed but it can be either hepatocellular or cholestatic. Most typically, the injury appears precipitously within one to three weeks of starting therapy, often preceded or accompanied by signs of hypersensitivity such as fever, rash, facial edema, lymphadenopathy, arthralgias, and eosinophilia or atypical lymphocytosis (or both). Hepatotoxicity from sulfonamides may represent a part of a spectrum of hypersensitivity due to sulfa-derived medications and have been linked to many cases of DRESS (drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) as well as Stevens Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrosis. The severity of injury varies widely. Most instances of sulfonamide related liver injury are mild-to-moderate in severity and self-limited in course. Cases with severe cholestasis may be prolonged and can lead to vanishing bile duct syndrome. Importantly, sulfonamides can cause acute liver failure, particularly in instances with a precipitious onset and hepatocellular pattern of serum enzyme elevations. Indeed, the sulfonamides remain one of the most common causes of drug induced acute liver failure and account for % to 10% of instances in many case series. Formulations of sulfonamides currently in general use in the United States include sulfadiazine, sulfadoxine, and sulfisoxazole as well as the combination formulations including sulfasalazine and trimethoprim-sulfamethazole (TMP-SMZ, also referred to as co-trimoxazole). The term sulfonamide applies to derivatives of para-aminobenzene sulfonamide (sulfanilamide), which is composed of a benzene ring with a sulfate and amide group at one end and an amide group at the other (para-position). These agents will be discussed as groups, rather than individual medications, and cases and references are combined.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613652>Marked regional variations in the prevalence of  in a limited geographical region are not associated with compounds in the drinking water.</a></h1><p> The incidence of autoimmune , especially  (IBD), has increased substantially. Globally, there are vast differences varying from 0.2/10 in some Asian countries to over 80/10 in the Faroe Islands. Environmental factors have been suggested as triggers. The aim was to investigate the incidence and prevalence of IBD in the 33 municipalities in the county Scania in Southern Sweden, an area comprising 100 × 100 km with 1,274,069 inhabitants. Furthermore, we wanted to explore whether compounds in the drinking water could contribute to IBD; one report from Norway has suggested that iron in drinking water could contribute to UC.  Patients with CD and UC were identified through the ICD-10 diagnosis database during the period 2000-2013. Water analyses for pH, alkaline, nitrate, sulphate, iron, magnesium and calcium were based on established methods and compared with the prevalence of IBD using Student's -test.  A total number of 8925 patients were identified. The incidence for CD and UC were high (mean 16.4/10, range 13.6-17.9 and 25.3/10, range 21.3-28.0, respectively). The prevalence varied substantially ( < .0001 for both; CD mean 0.30%, range 0.15-0.42 and UC mean 0.42%, range 0.32-0.56). No correlation between IBD and the chemical compounds in the drinking water could be shown.  The incidence rates of both CD and UC were high. The prevalence varied from 200% to 300% between the municipalities, despite the limited geographical area indicating that local conditions are of importance. However, chemical compounds in the water were not associated with this variation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654243>Benefit-Risk Assessment of Alogliptin for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.</a></h1><p>The dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i) alogliptin is an oral, antidiabetic treatment that is approved in many countries to treat patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), including the USA, Europe, and Japan. Alogliptin is efficacious both as monotherapy and as add-on/combination therapy with other commonly prescribed T2DM treatments, such as metformin and pioglitazone. Overall, alogliptin is well-tolerated in patients with T2DM, including older patients, those with renal and/or hepatic impairment, and those at high risk of cardiovascular events. There is a low risk of hypoglycemia, weight gain, acute pancreatitis, and gastrointestinal adverse events with alogliptin treatment, as demonstrated in long-term trials (lasting up to 4. years) and in a real-world setting. Additionally, alogliptin has a generally favorable or similar safety profile in comparison to other antidiabetic agents (metformin, thiazolidinediones, sulfonylureas, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, α-glucosidase inhibitors, and insulin). However, further evaluation would be required to determine the mechanism and effect of alogliptin on heart failure, bullous pemphigoid, and . Of note, due to the ethnic diversity in the epidemiology of T2DM, alogliptin has been shown to be more efficacious in Asian patients than in non-Asian patients with T2DM, but with a similar tolerability profile. These data indicate that DPP-4is, including alogliptin, are important treatment options, especially for Asian patients with T2DM, for whom they have potential as a first-line therapy. This benefit-risk assessment aims to place alogliptin within the current armamentarium of T2DM and aid physicians when choosing optimal diabetes treatment for their patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613423>Peroxiredoxin 1 as an  marker in diarrhea-predominant and postinfectious irritable  syndrome.</a></h1><p>Low-grade inflammation occurs in some patients with irritable  syndrome (IBS). However, the exact  markers of IBS and the relationship of these markers with IBS subtypes and symptoms are poorly defined. Peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1) plays an important role in  responses, including intestinal inflammation. We investigated whether PRDX1 is associated with the diagnosis, subtypes, and symptom severity of IBS.A total of 177 IBS patients and 174 sex- and age-matched healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. The PRDX1 levels in the sera and colonic mucosa of the participants were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunohistochemistry. The severity of IBS symptoms was assessed using the IBS Severity Scoring System (SSS) questionnaire.The PRDX1 levels in the sera (F = 71.81, P < .001) and colonic mucosa (F = .359, P < .001) of postinfectious (PI-IBS) and diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) groups were significantly higher than those of the other three IBS subtypes and HC group. The PRDX1 level in the serum and colonic mucosa of IBS-D (serum, P < .01, mucosa, P < .001) and PI-IBS (serum, P < .05, mucosa, P < .001) groups with the most severe symptoms was significantly higher than that in the groups with mild and moderate symptoms. Correlation analysis revealed that in patients with IBS-D (P < .001) and PI-IBS (P < .05), the levels of PRDX1 and TNF-α in sera had a significant positive correlation with IBS-SSS.Elevated PRDX1 in the serum and colon mucosa may be closely related to the progression of IBS (especially IBS-D and PI-IBS) and the expression of gastrointestinal symptoms.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31569451>Protective Effect of  Extract against Dextran-Sulfate-Sodium-Induced Ulcerative Colitis in Rats.</a></h1><p> is a multifactorial  condition.

ELISA is a time-consuming method for the measurement of FC, whereas a fluorescent immunochromatography test can obtain results in around 30 minutes and thus enables a rapid response to clinical decision.Two methods, the Proglead calprotectin (FC Proglead) and the BÜHLMANN fCAL ELISA (FC BÜHLMANN), were used to quantitatively examine FC in 111 stool samples. The comparison and bias estimation of both assays were assessed using CLSI EP09c protocol.The two methods were highly correlated (rho = .96). Deming regression was employed to calculate the regression equation, with a slope of 1.01 and an intercept of -4.98 μg/g. The estimated median bias (FC Proglead - FC BÜHLMANN) was -4.19 μg/g with the 95% limits of agreement (-55.59 to 47.21 μg/g), and the estimated median percent bias was -8.71% with the 95% limits of agreement (-50.31% to 32.90%). There was 4.50% (/111) of values outside the 95% limits of agreement. Percent biases at the FC cutoff values of 50 and 200 μg/g between both methods evaluated by Deming regression were 8.96% and 1.49%, respectively. The biases were all less than the acceptable standard (10%). And, 99.10% of FC results were in agreement between both methods (kappa = .99, P < .001).FC Proglead may be used as a suitable alternative to FC BÜHLMANN for the  activity assessment for patients with IBD, considering its convenience and shorter turnaround time.© 2019 The Authors.

However, its significance in the elderly population is uncertain. The study aimed to determine whether surveillance colonoscopy should be discontinued in the elderly population.We enrolled 105 patients who underwent baseline colonoscopy between January 2004 and December 2009 and were subsequently followed-up over  years in our institution. All had diminutive colorectal polyps and were aged <80 years at baseline colonoscopy and ≥80 years at follow-up in May 2018. Patients who had undergone colectomy or who had , familial adenomatous polyposis, Lynch syndrome, and no diminutive polyps were excluded. The cumulative incidence of the target lesion was evaluated. Histopathological diagnoses included low-grade dysplasia (LGD), high-grade dysplasia (HGD), and carcinoma.The target lesion was detected in 15% (16/105) of the patients. There was no invasive carcinoma; however, two HGDs were detected. There were three lesions that had increased from previously detected diminutive lesions, all of which were LGDs. There were no target lesions detected after 84 years of age, and the cumulative incidence was 0.20.

In these patients, the over-production of ROS generated by inflamed  tissue and  cells activates a pathogenic cascade that further exacerbates inflammation and leads to increased oxidative damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids. We measured the products of protein/lipid oxidation and the total antioxidant capacity (ferric reducing ability of plasma, FRAP) in the serum of CD patients with severe  activity requiring surgery with the aim to characterize their redox status and identify associations between oxidative stress-related markers and their clinical characteristics. At the systemic level, CD was associated with increased levels of protein and lipid oxidation products when compared to healthy volunteers, even though the FRAP values were similar. Advanced oxidation protein product (AOPP) levels showed the highest difference between patients and the controls (11.25, .02-15.15, vs. 1.36, 0.75-2.70, median, interquartile range;  < 0.0001) and the analysis of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, indicated for AOPP, the best area under the curve (AUC) value for CD prediction. Advanced glycated end-products (AGEs) were also significantly higher in CD patients ( < 0.01), which is of interest since AOPP and AGEs are both able to activate the membrane receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) involved in  . Thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) levels were significantly higher in CD patients with ileal localization and aggressive  behavior, in smokers, and in patients suffering from allergies. In conclusion, our data indicate that circulating oxidative stress biomarkers may be attractive candidates as  predictors as well as for clinical or therapeutic monitoring of CD. Our results also suggest that AOPP/AGEs and RAGE signaling may represent a pathogenic factor and a potential therapeutic target in CD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635181>Geographic Distribution, Phenotype and Epidemiological Tendency in  Patients in Romania.</a></h1><p> The incidence of  (IBD) over the past years in Romania has been on the rise, but epidemiologic data are lacking. The aim of this study was to define the characteristics of IBD, the trends and phenotype among IBD patients in Romania.  We conducted a prospective study over a period of 12 years, from 2006 to 2017. All patients diagnosed with IBD on clinical, radiological, endoscopic and histological features were included. We divided the country into eight regions: west (W), north-east (NE), north-west (NW), south-east (SE), south-west (SW), south (S), central (C) and Bucharest-Ilfov (B), and data were analyzed accordingly.  A total of 2724 patients were included in this database, but only 2248 were included in the final analysis, with all data available. Of the 2248 patients, 935 were Crohn's  (CD), 1263 were ulcerative colitis (UC) and 50 were IBD-undetermined. In UC phenotypes we observed more frequent left-sided colitis (50.%,  < 0.0001), and in CD phenotype we observed more frequent colonic and ileo-colonic localization (37.8% and 37.6%,  < 0.0001). The region with the most IBD cases was NE (25.1%) and with the least IBD cases was SW (4.9%). UC was found more frequently in NE (32%), while CD was found more frequently in Bucharest (28.6%).  In Romania, ulcerative colitis is more frequent than CD. UC is predominant in the northern part of Romania, while CD has become predominant in the southern part of the country. IBD occurs more in the male population, and in urban and industrialized areas. There are differences between the regions in Romania regarding IBD phenotypes, gender distributions, age distribution, treatment, smoking status and complications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657260>Corneal Manifestations of .</a></h1><p>: To evaluate detailed corneal parameters of  (IBD) patients, including Crohn's  (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, and to assess associations between anterior segment values and other clinical variables.: This prospective cross-sectional case-control study at a tertiary referral center included 30 CD patients, 36 UC patients and 80 age- and gender-matched controls with no ocular symptoms or ocular surface disorders. All study participants underwent a comprehensive ophthalmological evaluation with special interest in dry eye  (DED). Corneal parameters were evaluated by Pentacam.: The mean age of CD patients, UC patients, and controls was 45.80 ± 11.55 years, 52.00 ± 16.05, and 50.68 ± 14.62, respectively. The average  duration was 12.72 ± .83 years for CD patients and 15.94 ± 10.09 years for UC patients. All pachymetric (center, apex and thinnest) and corneal volume (CV) measurements were significantly decreased, while anterior chamber angle width (ACA) values were significantly increased on both sides in all IBD patients compared to those in controls ( < .05). In addition, several anterior segment parameters were altered unilaterally in CD or UC patients. Negative correlations were found between corneal parameters and Schirmer I test values.: Our investigations suggest that IBD patients have thinner corneas compared to that of controls. The coexistence of reduced tear quantity seems to have an additional impact on the thinning of the cornea in IBD patients. Early recognition of corneal impairments, a possible extraintestinal manifestation of IBD, should be included in the  checkup to reduce vision-threatening developments.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31515764>Clinical profile and outcome of primary sclerosing cholangitis: A single-centre experience from western India.</a></h1><p>Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), a chronic progressive cholestatic liver  of unknown cause, is uncommon in India.

All cases were reviewed for clinical profile,  (IBD) co-morbidity and major endpoints like death, cholangiocarcinoma and liver transplantation (LT).We identified 28 (18 men) patients with PSC (19, 67% large-duct and 9, 33% small-duct) with a median age of 31. years (range 7-63 years) with median duration of follow up of 24 months (6-125 months). Six (21.4%) had autoimmune hepatitis (AIH-PSC) overlap.  was seen in 12 (43%) cases, all were ulcerative colitis (UC). During follow up, seven patients (25%) developed dominant stricture or recurrent cholangitis, 11 (39%) had  portal hypertension, 2 (7%) developed cholangiocarcinoma and  (17.8%) progressed to hepatic  decompensation on follow up. Ten (35%) patients died,  from liver-related complications, 2 from cholangiocarcinoma, 1 each from brain hemorrhage and systemic sepsis and 1 due to unknown cause; 3 underwent liver transplantation. Revised Mayo score of patients who survived was lower than those who died (1.03 vs. 1.86, p value 0.03).PSC commonly presents in young age and rapidly progresses to decompensation. Prevalence of IBD in PSC is lower and the proportion of small-duct PSC is higher than that observed in western populations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31568016>The risk of venous thromboembolism in women with  during pregnancy and the postpartum period: A systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>Pregnancy and  (IBD) are independent risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Nevertheless, the optimal VTE prevention strategy for women with IBD in pregnancy and postpartum period has not been established yet. We assessed VTE risks during pregnancy and the postpartum period in women with IBD through systematic review and meta-analysis.Systematic searches were conducted in MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CENTRAL (Ovid), and Web of Science (Tomson Reuters) from the database inception till May 2017 to identify relevant studies reporting the risk of VTE during pregnancy and/or the postpartum period in women with IBD. Random effect meta-analyses were performed to compare VTE-related outcomes between women with IBD and without IBD. Our protocol was registered: CRD 42017060199 in the PROSPERO International prospective register of systematic reviews.In the analysis of  studies reviewed, IBD population (n = 17,636) had a significantly increased risk of VTE during pregnancy (pooled risk ratio (RR) 2.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.66-2.73) and postpartum (RR 2.61, 95% CI 1.84-3.69), comparing to the non-IBD population (n = 11,251,778). According to the location of VTE, the risk of deep vein thrombosis increased significantly by RR of 2.74 (95% CI 1.73-4.36) during pregnancy, whilst risk increase of pulmonary embolism was not statistically significant. In the subgroup analysis, the degree of VTE risk was higher in both periods in the UC group than in the CD group, as compared to that in the non-IBD population (UC group, during pregnancy: RR 2.24, 95% CI 1.6-3.11; postpartum period: RR 2.85, 95% CI 1.79-4.52).Significantly increased risks of VTE during pregnancy were found in the women with IBD, according to the periods and type of IBD, which might support a detailed strategy regarding administration of prophylactic anticoagulants to women with IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613959>Cannabis for the Treatment of Crohn's  and Ulcerative Colitis: Evidence From Cochrane Reviews.</a></h1><p>We systematically reviewed the safety and effectiveness of cannabis and cannabinoids treatment for Crohn's  (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).MEDLINE, Embase, WHO ICTRP, AMED, PsychINFO, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.Gov, and the European Clinical Trials Register were searched for relevant studies.Five randomized controlled trials (3 CD and 2 UC studies, 185 participants) were included. One CD study (N = 21) showed 45% ( of 11) of the cannabis cigarette group experienced clinical remission compared with 10% (1 of 10) of the placebo group (risk ratio [RR] 4.55; 95% CI, 0.63-32.56). Another CD study (N = 19) did not show significant rates of clinical remission. Forty percent (4 of 10) of participants in the cannabis oil group experienced remission compared with 33% (3 of 9) of the placebo group (RR 1.20; 95% CI, 0.36-3.97). A UC study (N = 60) did not have significant clinical remission rates. Twenty-four percent (7 of 29) of cannabis oil participants experienced remission compared with 26% (8 of 31) of placebo participants (RR 0.94; 95% CI, 0.39-2.25). A second UC study (N = 32) showed the effects on  activity, C-reactive protein levels, and fecal calprotectin levels were uncertain. Adverse events were more prevalent in the cannabis groups for both CD and UC studies. GRADE analysis for the UC and CD studies ranged from very low to moderate.In summary, no firm conclusions can be made regarding the safety and effectiveness of cannabis and cannabinoids in adults with CD and UC.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

Surgical best practices have been largely based on single-institution results and meta-analyses, with multicenter clinical data lacking. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (ACS-NSQIP) has revolutionized the way in which large-volume surgical outcomes data have been collected. Our aim was to employ the ACS-NSQIP to collect -specific variables relevant to surgical outcomes in IBD.A collaborative of 13 high-volume IBD surgery centers was convened to collect  IBD-specific variables in NSQIP. Variables included biologic and immunomodulator medications usage, ileostomy utilization, ileal pouch anastomotic technique, and colonic dysplasia/neoplasia. A sample of the Surgical Clinical Reviewer collected data was validated by a colorectal surgeon at each institution, and kappa's agreement statistics generated.Over 1 year, data were collected on a total of 956 cases. Overall, 41.4% of patients had taken a biologic agent in the 60 days before surgery. The 2 most commonly performed procedures were laparoscopic ileocolic resections (159 cases) and subtotal colectomies (151 cases). Overall, 56.8% of cases employed an ileostomy, and 134 ileal pouches were constructed, of which 92.4% used stapled technique. A sample of 214 (22.4%) consecutive cases was validated from 8 institutions. All  novel variables were shown to be reliably collected, with excellent agreement for 4 variables (kappa ≥ 0.70) and very good agreement for the presence of colonic dysplasia (kappa = 0.68).We report the results of the initial year of implementation of the first -specific collaborative within NSQIP. The selected variables were demonstrated to be reliably collected, and this collaborative will facilitate high-quality, large case-volume research specific to the IBD patient population.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

A retrospectively descriptive cohort study was carried out. Clinical data of 2010 patients who underwent FMT and received follow-up for more than 3 months from May 2014 to November 2018 were collected, including 1,206 cases from Tongji University Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital and 804 cases from Nanjing Eastern Military General Hospital. Of the 2,010 patients, 797 were male and 1,213 were female, with a mean age of (49.4±16.) years old. Inclusion criteria were those with indications for FMT and voluntary treatment of FMT. Pregnant or lactating women, patients with end-stage , cases who were participating or participated in other clinical trials within 3 months, and patients with previous  history of pathogen infection, oral antibiotics or proton pump inhibitors (PPI) for the recent2 weeks, and those at immunosuppressive state were excluded. Informed consent was obtained from the enrolled patients and their families. There were 1,356 cases of constipation, 175 cases of , 148 cases of chronic diarrhea, 127 cases of radiation enteritis, 119 cases of irritable  syndrome, and 85 cases of autism (complicating with intestinal disorders). FMT donor requirements: (1) 18 to 30 years old non-relatives, non-pregnant healthy adults with healthy lifestyle and good eating habits as volunteers to participate in fecal donation; (2) no administration of antibiotics within 3 months; (3) no chronic  such as constipation, irritable  syndrome, , etc., no autoimmune , not in immunosuppressive state, no history of malignant ; (4) negative pathogen examination of infectious  (hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, syphilis, HIV, etc.); () negative fecal examination (C.difficile, dysentery bacillus, Shigella, Campylobacter, parasites, etc.). The donor requirements after enrollment: (1) physical examination was reviewed once every two months, and the result still met the above requirements; (2) 16S rRNA sequencing was performed for every fecal donation in order to ensure that the composition and diversity of the fecal flora was stable and reliable. The preparation of the stool suspension referred to the Amsterdam criteria and the preparation process was less than 1 hour. The preparation of the FMT capsule was processed by pre-freezing the stool suspension after the preparation of the above suspension, and the frozen sample was transferred into a freeze dryer for freezing. The dried and lyophilized powder was encapsulated in capsules, and the capsule shell was made of acid-resistant hypromellose capsule (No.0) and pediatric-specific capsule (No.3), sealed and packaged in a-20℃ refrigerator. Three ways of accepting FMT treatment pathways included 6-day transplantation after the placement of the nasointestinal tube, 6-day oral FMT capsule transplantation and one-time transplantation through colonoscopy. Intestinal preparation (nasointestinal tube feeding of polyethylene glycol until watery stool) was carried out before transplantation. Other treatments were stopped during treatment and follow-up, and any medication was not recommended when necessary.  Of the 2010 patients, 1,497 cases received nasointestinal tube transplantation (nasointestinal tube group), 452 cases oral capsule transplantation (oral capsule group) and 61 cases colonoscopy (colonoscopy group).

This study aimed to characterise inflammation, predict prognosis, and understand the impact of drug therapy using Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE).Patients with a stricture diagnosed on MRE over a -year period were reviewed for MRE  extent and inflammation, clinical course, C-Reactive Protein (CRP), response to anti-TNF therapy, endoscopic dilatation, hospitalization and surgery.136 patients had 235 (77 one and 59 ≥ two) strictures.46% of patients underwent surgery after a median 6 months; median follow-up for those not requiring surgery was 41 months. Predictors of surgery: Hospitalization due to obstruction predicted subsequent surgery (OR 2.50; 95% CI 1.06-.90) while anti-TNF therapy commenced at stricture diagnosis was associated with a reduced risk (OR 0.23; 95% CI 0.05-0.99). MRE characteristics associated with surgery were proximal  dilatation ≥30mm diameter (OR, 2.98; 95% CI 1.36-6.55), stricture  wall thickness ≥10mm (OR 2.42; 95% CI 1.11-.27), and stricture length >5cm (OR 2.56; 95% CI 1.21-.43). 81% of patients with these 3 adverse MRE features required surgery versus 17% if none were present (P<0.001). Accuracy for these 3 MRE variables predicting surgery was high (AUC 0.76).MRE findings in Crohn's  strictures are highly predictive of the  course and the need for future surgery. MRE may also identify who would benefit from treatment intensification. Anti-TNF therapy is associated with reduced risk of surgery and appears to alter the natural history of this complication.This article is protected by copyright.

However, variations in methodology and adherence to model assumptions may further contribute.We investigated how differences in methodology affect estimates of outcomes in IF patients.We applied different model assumptions and statistical methods to real-life outcome data from a well-characterized cohort of nonmalignant short  syndrome (SBS) patients. This retrospective study was based on extracts from the Copenhagen IF database and from the Danish death registry.Estimates of mortality varied substantially, depending on the study design and statistical method. The -y mortality rate obtained with the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method was estimated to be 10.1% higher if patients were only followed during HPS treatment, compared with follow-up regardless of HPS treatment. The -y cumulative incidence of weaning off HPS was overestimated by 4.4% when inappropriately using the KM method, instead of the cumulative incidence function. The -y survival rates in nonmalignant SBS-IF patients who initiated HPS were 89.1% for those aged younger than 40 y, 74.8% for patients aged 40-60 y, and 52.1% for those older than 60 y. A Cox regression analysis identified age and diagnoses other than  as significant risk factors for mortality. For HPS dependency,  anatomy was significantly associated with the ability to wean off, and no patients without a colon and less than 100 cm remnant of the small  remained continuously weaned off and alive for one year.The large variations in outcomes illustrated in this study emphasize the importance of the appropriate selection of statistical methods.

However, there may be high levels due to factors other than the activity of ulcerative colitis. Our aim was to analyse possible false positive results of calprotectin for the activity of ulcerative colitis owing to the presence of  polyps.Retrospective, observational, descriptive study. Data was collected from patients monitored for 2 years in whom a colonoscopy had been requested within 3 months after detecting high calprotectin values (>150μg/g) and before modifying the treatment.We reviewed 39 patients and in  of them, with previous diagnosis of extensive ulcerative colitis,  polyps were detected. Three patients were on treatment with mesalazine, one with azathioprine and other with infliximab. All of them were asymptomatic and the endoscopy did not show macroscopic activity (endoscopic Mayo score=0) or histological activity. The median values of calprotectin were 422μg/g (IQR: 298-2,408) and they remained elevated in a second measurement. In 4 of the patients the  polyps were multiple and small in size. The other patient had a polyp measuring 4cm.In clinical practice we can find high faecal calprotectin levels not due to the presence of ulcerative colitis activity, but due to other lesions such as  polyps.

The selected genes were catalase (CAT), α-defensin  (DEFA5), FasR, FasL, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), TNFRSF1A, TNFRSF1B, PPA2, ABCB1, NOD2, PPARγ, and PKCζ. We used the elastic net algorithm and R software.We studied 240 CpGs. Sixteen CpGs showed differential methylation profiles among aCD, iCD, and CTR. We selected for validation those with the greatest differences: DEFA5 CpG_11; CpG_13; CAT CpG_31.32; TNF CpG_4, CpG_12; and ABCB1 CpG_21. Our results validated the genes DEFA5 (methylation gain) and TNF (methylation loss) with P values < 0.001. In both cases, the methylation level was maintained and did not change with CD activity (aCD vs iCD). The subanalysis comparison between aCD and iCD showed significant differential methylation profiles in other CpGs: TNF, FAS, ABCB1, CAT, and TNFRS1BF genes.The methylation status of DEFA5 and TNF genes provides a signature biomarker that characterizes patients with CD and supports the possible implication of the environment and the immune system in CD pathogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615647>[Epidemiology, treatment and prognosis of colorectal cancer in young adults in sub-Saharan Africa].</a></h1><p>Colorectal cancer is the most common digestive cancer. The objectives of this study was to analyse the frequency, aetiologies, and the therapeutic and progressive aspects of colorectal cancer in young adults in Burkina Faso. This study was a 10-years descriptive study conducted in 2 regional hospitals in Burkina Faso. It included all patients aged 20 to 45 years admitted to these two hospitals for colon cancer or rectal cancer during the study period. A total of 116 patients were included, which was 39.2% of all patients admitted for colorectal cancer during the same period. The average age of the included patients was 35.4 years old. There were 70 male patients (60.3%). Seven patients had a history of chronic , and six had a family history of colon cancer. The average consultation time was 6.2 months. In 25 cases (19.9%), the cancer was discovered in the context of an abdominal emergency. Ninety-two patients (79.3%) were diagnosed at stage 3 or stage 4 according to the TNM Staging System. The most common histological type was adenocarcinoma (103 cases, 88.9%). Therapeutically, surgery was performed on 87 patients (75%) and chemotherapy was used in 37 cases (31.9%). Sixteen patients received radiotherapy. The intra operative mortality rate was 4.6%. The -year survival rate was 17%. In conclusion, colorectal cancer in young adults occurs without obvious risk factors in Burkina Faso. Mortality remains high because of the limited therapeutic arsenal.Copyright © 2019 Société Française du Cancer. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

Patients with UC usually suffer from a lifetime of debilitating physical symptoms. Therefore, developing effective therapeutic strategy that can manage this  better and improve patients' life quality is in urgent need. Sesamin (SSM) is a lignan derived from sesame seeds. In this study, the protective effect of SSM against UC and the underlying mechanism were investigated  and . Our data showed that SSM protected Caco-2 cells from HO-induced oxidative stress injury via GSH-mediated scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Dual luciferase reporter assay showed that the transcriptional activity of nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2 (Nrf2) was significantly increased by SSM, and the ability of SSM to activate Nrf2-targeted genes was further confirmed in Caco-2 cells using western blot and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). In contrast, Nrf2 knockdown abolished the protective effect of SSM. Additionally, we found that SSM also activated advanced protein kinase B (AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in Caco-2 cells, while either AKT or ERK inhibition can prevent SSM-mediated nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Furthermore, SSM displayed a better protective effect against dextran sulfate sodium- (DSS-) induced UC compared with -aminosalicylic acid (-ASA) in C57BL/6 mice. The enhanced Nrf2 signaling and activated AKT/ERK were also observed in the colon of mice after SSM administration. These results first demonstrate the protective effect of SSM against UC and indicate that the effect is associated with AKT/ERK activation and subsequent Nrf2 signaling enhancement. This study provides a new insight into the medicinal value of SSM and proposes it as a new natural nutrition for better managing the symptoms of UC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639193>Anastomotic Ulcers After Ileocolic Resection for Crohn's  Are Common and Predict Recurrence.</a></h1><p>Crohn's  recurrence after ileocolic resection is common and graded with the Rutgeerts score. There is controversy whether anastomotic ulcers represent  recurrence and should be included in the grading system. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of anastomotic ulcers on Crohn's  recurrence in patients with prior ileocolic resections. Secondary aims included defining the prevalence of anastomotic ulcers, risk factors for development, and their natural history.We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing an ileocolic resection between 2008 and 2017 at a large academic center, with a postoperative colonoscopy assessing the neoterminal ileum and ileocolic anastomosis. The primary outcome was  recurrence defined as endoscopic recurrence (> ulcers in the neoterminal ileum) or need for another ileocolic resection among patients with or without an anastomotic ulcer in endoscopic remission.One hundred eighty-two subjects with Crohn's  and an ileocolic resection were included. Anastomotic ulcers were present in 95 (52.2%) subjects. No factors were associated with anastomotic ulcer development. One hundred eleven patients were in endoscopic remission on the first postoperative colonoscopy. On multivariable analysis, anastomotic ulcers were associated with  recurrence (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 3.64; 95% CI, 1.21-10.95; P = 0.02). Sixty-six subjects with anastomotic ulcers underwent a second colonoscopy, with 31 patients (79.%) having persistent ulcers independent of medication escalation.Anastomotic ulcers occur in over half of Crohn's  patients after ileocolic resection. No factors are associated with their development. They are associated with Crohn's  recurrence and are persistent.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press.

In the pursuit of novel and more economic therapies, patients may increasingly look at complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Recently, CAM is increasingly favored by the general public on account of its safety, low toxicity, and effectiveness. As a branch of CAM, herbal plants and their extracts have a significant effect on the treatment of IBD. Treatment of IBD with herbaceous plants has been reported, but specific mechanisms and effects have not yet been elaborated.English abstracts were identified in PubMed and Science Direct by multiple search terms, such as "herbal," "CAM," "IBD," "ulcerative colitis," "abdominal pain," and so on. Full-length articles were selected for review.Herbaceous plants and their extracts have been shown to be effective against IBD in many studies, and herbaceous plants may be effective in treating symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, mucus, and bloody stools.Herbal medications could be used as a complementary and alternative treatment for IBD, but they require more rigorous scientific testing.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

Understanding these geographical differences is crucial for formulating effective strategies for preventing and treating IBD. We report the prevalence, mortality, and overall burden of IBD in 195 countries and territories between 1990 and 2017, based on data from the Global Burden of , Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017.We modelled mortality due to IBD using a standard Cause of Death Ensemble model including data mainly from vital registrations. To estimate the non-fatal burden, we used data presented in primary studies, hospital discharges, and claims data, and used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, to ensure consistency between measures. Mortality, prevalence, years of life lost (YLLs) due to premature death, years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were estimated. All of the estimates were reported as numbers and rates per 100 000 population, with 95% uncertainty intervals (UI).In 2017, there were 6·8 million (95% UI 6·4-7·3) cases of IBD globally. The age-standardised prevalence rate increased from 79· (75·9-83·) per 100 000 population in 1990 to 84·3 (79·2-89·9) per 100 000 population in 2017. The age-standardised death rate decreased from 0·61 (0·55-0·69) per 100 000 population in 1990 to 0·51 (0·42-0·54) per 100 000 population in 2017. At the GBD regional level, the highest age-standardised prevalence rate in 2017 occurred in high-income North America (422·0 [398·7-446·1] per 100 000) and the lowest age-standardised prevalence rates were observed in the Caribbean (6·7 [6·3-7·2] per 100 000 population). High Socio-demographic Index (SDI) locations had the highest age-standardised prevalence rate, while low SDI regions had the lowest age-standardised prevalence rate. At the national level, the USA had the highest age-standardised prevalence rate (464· [438·6-490·9] per 100 000 population), followed by the UK (449·6 [420·6-481·6] per 100 000). Vanuatu had the highest age-standardised death rate in 2017 (1·8 [0·8-3·2] per 100 000 population) and Singapore had the lowest (0·08 [0·06-0·14] per 100 000 population). The total YLDs attributed to IBD almost doubled over the study period, from 0·56 million (0·39-0·77) in 1990 to 1·02 million (0·71-1·38) in 2017. The age-standardised rate of DALYs decreased from 26· (21·0-33·0) per 100 000 population in 1990 to 23·2 (19·1-27·8) per 100 000 population in 2017.The prevalence of IBD increased substantially in many regions from 1990 to 2017, which might pose a substantial social and economic burden on governments and health systems in the coming years.

Flightless I (Flii) is an immuno-modulatory protein is a member of the gelsolin family of actin-remodelling proteins that regulates cellular and  processes critical in tissue repair. Here we investigated its involvement in UC and show that Flii is significantly elevated in colonic tissues of patients with . Using an acute murine model of colitis, we characterised the contribution of Flii to UC using mice with low (Flii), normal (Flii) and high Flii (Flii). High levels of Flii resulted in significantly elevated  severity index scores, increased rectal bleeding and degree of colon shortening whereas, low Flii expression decreased  severity, reduced tissue inflammation and improved clinical indicators of UC. Mice with high levels of Flii had significantly increased histological  severity and elevated mucosal damage with significantly increased  cell infiltrate and significantly higher levels of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL- and IL-13 pro- cytokines. Additionally, Flii overexpression resulted in decreased β-catenin levels, inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signalling and impaired regeneration of colonic crypts. These studies suggest that high levels of Flii, as is observed in patients with UC, may adversely affect mucosal healing via mechanisms involving Th and Th mediated tissue inflammation and Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31523944>[Concordance between the test of the tuberculin and Interferon Gamma Release Assay-IGRA in patients with immune-mediated  ].</a></h1><p>The immunosuppressive therapies in the treatment of the immune-mediated   (EIMI) predispose individuals to the tuberculosis, so the screening of latent tuberculosis infection (ITL) and the treatment reduces the likelihood of a progression to an active tuberculosis.

A dose of  mL kg-1 had a protective effect on intestinal inflammation, with an improvement in macroscopic damage, and a decrease in pro- markers and oxidative stress, in addition to preserving the colonic tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the downregulation of IL-17, NF-κB, and iNOS, and upregulation of SOCs-1, ZO-1, and MUC-2. These protective effects could be attributed to the phenolic compounds as well as the fibers present in xique-xique juice.

Less is known about the impact of corticosteroid-sparing IBD therapies on pneumonia risk or the efficacy of pneumococcal vaccination in reducing all-cause pneumonia in real-world IBD cohorts.We performed a population-based study using an established Veterans Health Administration cohort of 29,957 IBD patients. We identified all patients who developed bacterial pneumonia. Cox survival analysis was used to determine the association of corticosteroids at study entry and as a time-varying covariate, corticosteroid-sparing agents (immunomodulators and antitumor necrosis-alpha [TNF] inhibitors), and pneumococcal vaccination with the development of all-cause pneumonia.Patients with IBD who received corticosteroids had a greater risk of pneumonia when controlling for age, gender, and comorbidities (hazard ratio [HR] 2.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.90-2.57 for prior use; HR = 3.42; 95% CI, 2.92-4.01 for use during follow-up). Anti-TNF inhibitors (HR 1.52; 95% CI, 1.02-2.26), but not immunomodulators (HR 0.91; 95% CI, 0.77-1.07), were associated with a small increase in pneumonia. A history of pneumonia was strongly associated with subsequent pneumonia (HR = 4.41; 95% CI, 3.70-.27). Less than 15% of patients were vaccinated against pneumococcus, and this was not associated with a reduced risk of pneumonia (HR = 1.02; 95% CI, 0.80-1.30) in this cohort.In a large US cohort, corticosteroids were confirmed to increase pneumonia risk. Tumor necrosis-alpha inhibitors were associated with a smaller increase in the risk of pneumonia. Surprisingly, pneumococcal vaccination did not reduce all-cause pneumonia in this population, though few patients were vaccinated.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

Observation started with the date of the first prescription of index tumor necrosis factor α-inhibitors (anti-TNFα) or vedolizumab (VDZ) therapy and lasted 12 months. Non-persistence was assumed in case of a switch to another biologic or a treatment gap of >90 days.We included 1,248 IBD biologic treatment starters (502 adalimumab, 77 golimumab, 441 infliximab, 228 VDZ); 837/411 were biologic-naïve (bio-naïve)/ biologic-experienced (bio-experienced). Mean age of bio-naïve/bio-experienced anti-TNFα patients was 39.2/38.1 years (54.9%/56.7% female) and 42.6/37.8 years for VDZ patients (56.3%/54.9% female). Seven hundred and seventy-two patients (61.9%) were persistent with their index biologic therapy after 12 months (61.9%/61.8% bio-naïve/bio-experienced). Percentage of persistent patients was 69.7% for VDZ (65.6%/71.3%) and 60.1% for anti-TNFα (61.4%/55.%). VDZ was associated with later non-persistence in a multivariable Cox regression analysis (hazard ratio 0.675; p = 0.003) compared to anti-TNFα.Only 60-70% of IBD -patients are still persistent with their biologic therapy after 12 months.

Mice with IBD induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water exhibit depressive-like behavior. The presence of Lactobacillus in the gut microbiota is associated with major depressive disorder. Therefore, we examined whether Enterococcus faecalis 2001 (EF-2001), a biogenic lactic acid bacterium, prevents DSS-induced depressive-like behavior and changes in peripheral symptoms.We evaluated colon inflammation and used the tail suspension test to examine whether EF-2001 prevents IBD-like symptoms and depressive-like behavior in DSS-treated mice. The protein expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and cleaved caspase-3 in the rectum and hippocampus was assessed by western blotting. Hippocampal neurogenesis, altered nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) p65 morphometry, and the localization of activated NFκB p65 and XIAP were examined by immunohistochemistry.Treatment with 1.% DSS for 7 days induced IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior, increased TNF-α and IL-6 expression in the rectum and hippocampus, activated caspase-3 in the hippocampus, and decreased hippocampal neurogenesis. Interestingly, these changes were reversed by 20-day administration of EF-2001. Further, EF-2001 administration enhanced NFκB p65 expression in the microglial cells and XIAP expression in the hippocampus of DSS-treated mice.EF-2001 prevented IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior via decreased rectal and hippocampal  cytokines and facilitated the NFκB p65/XIAP pathway in the hippocampus.

SLC39A8 is ubiquitously expressed, including pluripotent embryonic stem cells; SLC39A8 expression occurs in every cell type examined. Uptake of ZIP8-mediated Mn, Zn, Fe, Se, and Co represents endogenous functions-moving these cations into the cell. By way of mouse genetic differences, the phenotype of "subcutaneous cadmium-induced testicular necrosis" was assigned to the Cdm locus in the 1970s. This led to identification of the mouse Slc39a8 gene, its most closely related Slc39a14 gene, and creation of Slc39a8-overexpressing, Slc39a8(neo/neo) knockdown, and cell type-specific conditional knockout mouse lines; the Slc39a8(-/-) global knockout mouse is early-embryolethal. Slc39a8(neo/neo) hypomorphs die between gestational day 16. and postnatal day 1-exhibiting severe anemia, dysregulated hematopoiesis, hypoplastic spleen, dysorganogenesis, stunted growth, and hypomorphic limbs. Not surprisingly, genome-wide association studies subsequently revealed human SLC39A8-deficiency variants exhibiting striking pleiotropy-defects correlated with clinical disorders in virtually every organ, tissue, and cell-type: numerous developmental and congenital disorders, the immune system, cardiovascular system, kidney, lung, liver, coagulation system, central nervous system, musculoskeletal system, eye, and gastrointestinal tract. Traits with which SLC39A8-deficiency variants are currently associated include Mn-deficient hypoglycosylation; numerous birth defects; Leigh syndrome-like mitochondrial redox deficiency; decreased serum high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels; increased body mass index; greater risk of coronary artery , hypotension, cardiovascular death, allergy, ischemic stroke, schizophrenia, Parkinson , , Crohn , myopia, and adolescent idiopathic scoliosis; systemic lupus erythematosus with primary Sjögren syndrome; decreased height; and inadvertent participation in the  progression of osteoarthritis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31607268>Infliximab for pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis: a phase 3, open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter trial in Japan.</a></h1><p>Pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC) is typically more extensive and has a more active  course than adult UC, and requires early treatment augmentation to achieve and maintain  remission. The present study aimed to investigate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic profile of infliximab (IFX) in pediatric patients with moderate-to-severe UC and inadequate response to existing treatment.This open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter, Phase 3 trial was conducted at 17 centers in Japan between April 2012 and September 2014. Pediatric patients (aged 6-17 years) diagnosed with moderate-to-severe UC received a treatment protocol comprising  mg/kg IFX at Weeks 0, 2, and 6, and Clinical Activity Index (CAI)-based responders at Week 8 also received treatment at 8-week intervals at Weeks 14 and 22, with a final evaluation at Week 30.A total of 21 patients were treated in this study. IFX therapy rapidly improved clinical symptoms, and this effect was maintained for up to 30 weeks. Overall CAI-based remission rate was 42.9% and overall Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI)-based remission rate was 19.0%. Median partial Mayo score was 6.0 at baseline and 4.0 at Week 30 (overall). Among the eight patients who underwent sigmoidoscopy, Mayo response was achieved at Week 30 (overall) in three patients (37.%).

Compared with UC alone, patients with UC-PSC were younger (younger than 20 years) at diagnosis (odds ratios [OR], 2.35; adjusted P = 0.02) and had milder UC severity (adjusted P = 0.05), despite having pancolonic involvement (OR, 7.01; adjusted P < 0.001). In the biologics era (calendar year 2005 to 2015), patients with UC-PSC less commonly received anti-TNF therapy compared with patients with UC (OR, 0.38; adjusted P = 0.009), but their response rates were similar. Fewer patients with UC-PSC received corticosteroids (OR, 0.24; adjusted P = 0.005) or rectal -aminosalicyte acid (OR, 0.26; adjusted P < 0.001). Other differences were identified that were not statistically significant in a multivariable model: patients with UC-PSC more commonly were male, had lower rates of smoking, and had higher rates of colorectal cancer and colectomy.This study identified a unique phenotype of UC with concurrent PSC, which had different clinical behavior compared with UC only. These phenotypic characteristics can help identify high-risk patients with UC before PSC is diagnosed and guide different management and monitoring strategies.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of initial immunomodulator and anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents for the treatment of CD from a US third-party perspective, incorporating current treatment algorithms, optimization strategies, and reduced costs availed by biosimilars.A 1-year Markov model was developed to simulate the cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of initial azathioprine, infliximab, and combination therapy for moderate to severe CD. Treatment was changed based on tolerability and clinical  activity at 3-monthly intervals. Efficacy data were based on published literature.Initial azathioprine had the lowest cost and utility ($35,337 and 0.63 QALYs), whereas combination therapy was the costliest yet conferred the highest health benefits ($57,638 and 0.67 QALYs). The incremental cost-effectiveness of infliximab and combination therapy compared with azathioprine were both in excess of $500,000 per QALY gained. Initial azathioprine remained the most cost-effective treatment on sensitivity analysis compared with infliximab and combination therapy, with 90% reductions in anti-TNF therapy costs and a -year time horizon, although combination therapy had an acceptable cost-effectiveness when costs were reduced in the extended model. Initial infliximab, ustekinumab, and vedolizumab were dominated by combination therapy.In the biosimilar era, initial azathioprine with escalation to infliximab appeared more cost-effective in the short term compared with infliximab or combination therapy, although initial combination therapy yields acceptable ICERs in the long term with continued reductions in anti-TNF therapy costs and will likely be the preferred treatment strategy in the future.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

At our center, preemptive appendicectomy is performed at the time of pancreas transplant to prevent any future risk in a complex transplant patient. The aim of this study was to review all histology reports from the removed appendices.The histology reports from all incidental appendicectomies performed at pancreas transplant were reviewed.Between January 2001 and June 2016, 107 pancreas transplants were performed (86 simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplants, 11 pancreas after kidney transplants, and 10 pancreas transplants alone), and 65 appendix histology reports were available from this patient group. All were preemptive appendicectomies as none of the patients had symptoms to suggest acute appendicitis. Of the 65 appendix histologies, 43 (66.2%) were reported as normal. Twenty specimens (30.8%) showed fibrosis consistent with previous inflammation of the appendix, and 12 specimens (18.%) showed fecal material in the lumen (1 due to an obstructing fecalith and another 2 showing luminal distension with feces). Three specimens (4.6%) showed lymphoid hyperplasia. There were  (7.7 %) unexpected findings upon histology. In review of histology reports, 1 patient had a 1.1-mm carcinoid tumor in an otherwise normal appendix, 1 had an Enterobius species worm infestation, 1 had focal endometriosis, 1 had crypt abscesses suggestive of , 1 had a metaplastic polyp, and 1 had melanosis coli of unknown clinical significance. There were no cases of overt acute appendicitis. No patients experienced a complication as a direct result of their appendicectomy.A policy ofroutine appendicectomy atthe time of pancreas transplant appears to be justified and safe.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640916>Long-term outcome of immunomodulator use in pediatric patients with .</a></h1><p>In the era where new biologicals are entering the market, the place of immunomodulators in the treatment of pediatric  (IBD) needs to be reassessed.All children with Crohn's  (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) followed at our center over the last 10 years were reviewed. Children who received conventional therapy (including -aminosalicylates, steroids, thiopurines and methotrexate) since diagnosis were included. Primary outcome was steroid-free clinical remission without need for rescue therapy (biologics or surgery) at 6 and 12 months after diagnosis and at last follow-up. Cox proportional hazard modelling was performed to determine variables at diagnosis associated with outcomes.In total, 176 IBD patients (121 CD, 55 UC) were identified with a median follow-up of 4.6 [2.0-8.1] years. Remission rates were 79.6% at month 6, but decreased to 60.2% at month 12, and 31.8% at last follow-up. Higher CRP [1.006 (1.001-1.011)], lower albumin [1.050 (1.012-1.086)] and growth impairment [1.214 (1.014-1.373)] in CD patients and higher PUCAI score [1.038 (1.006-1.072)] and low iron [1.023 (1.003-1.043)] in UC patients were associated with treatment failure (all p < 0.05).Only 32% pediatric IBD patients will remain free of biologics or surgery -years after diagnosis. Especially children with a high  burden at diagnosis were more likely to fail conventional therapy.Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p></html>
