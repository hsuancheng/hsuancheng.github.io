Two molecules hypothesized to regulate RNA polymerase are the protein Rsd, which binds to σ, and the non-coding  RNA which binds to the RNA polymerase-σ holoenzyme. Despite multiple studies, the functions of Rsd and  RNA remain controversial. Here we use RNA-Seq in five phases of growth to elucidate their function on a genome-wide scale. We show that Rsd and  RNA facilitate σ activity throughout bacterial growth, while  RNA also regulates widely different genes depending upon growth phase. We discover novel interactions between  RNA and Rsd and show widespread expression changes in a strain lacking both regulators. Finally, we present a mathematical model of transcription which highlights the crosstalk between Rsd and  RNA as a crucial factor in controlling sigma factor competition and global gene expression.Copyright © 2018 Lal et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900951>Children's  expenditure during object projection skill performance: New insight for activity intensity relativity.</a></h2><p>: To examine children's energy expenditure (EE) during object projection skill performance at three intensity intervals. : Children's (42,  = 8.1) average  equivalents of task (METs) were calculated using a COSMED K4b2 while they repeatedly performed blocks of kicking, throwing (overhand), and striking (two-handed) during 6, 12, and 30-s interval conditions.

Among molecular mechanisms, activation of BDNF receptor TrkB along with the inhibition of GSK3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3β) are considered as critical molecular level determinants for ketamine's antidepressant effects. Hydroxynorketamines (2R,6R)-HNK and (2S,)-HNK), non-anesthetic metabolites of ketamine, have been proposed to govern the therapeutic effects of ketamine through a mechanism not involving NMDARs. However, we have shown that nitrous oxide, another NMDAR blocking anesthetic and a putative rapid-acting antidepressant, evokes TrkB-GSK3β signaling alterations during rebound slow EEG (electroencephalogram) oscillations. We investigated here the acute effects of ketamine, 6,6-d-ketamine (a ketamine analogue resistant to ) and cis-HNK that contains (2R,6R) and (2S,) enantiomers in 1:1 ratio, on TrkB-GSK3β signaling and concomitant electroencephalographic (EEG) alterations in the adult mouse cortex. Ketamine dose-dependently increased slow oscillations and phosphorylations of TrkB and GSK3β in crude brain homogenates (i.e. sedative/anesthetic doses (>50 mg/kg, i.p.) produced more prominent effects than a subanesthetic dose (10 mg/kg, i.p.)). Similar, albeit less obvious, effects were seen in crude synaptosomes. A sedative dose of 6,6-d-ketamine (100 mg/kg, i.p.) recapitulated the effects of ketamine on TrkB and GSK3β phosphorylation while cis-HNK at a dose of 20 mg/kg produced negligible acute effects on TrkB-GSK3β signaling or slow oscillations. These findings suggest that the acute effects of ketamine on TrkB-GSK3β signaling are by no means restricted to subanesthetic (i.e. antidepressant) doses and that cis-HNK is not responsible for these effects.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

We have previously reported the synergistic anti-cancer effects of a novel compound DT-010. In the present study, we further investigated the cardioprotective effects of DT-010 in zebrafish embryos in vivo and the molecular underlying mechanisms in H9c2 cardiomyocytes in vitro. We showed that DT-010 prevented the Dox-induced morphological distortions in the zebrafish heart and the associated cardiac impairments, and especially improved ventricular functions. By using H9c2 cells model, we showed that DT-010 directly inhibited the generation of reactive oxygen species by Dox and protected cell death and cellular damage. We further observed that DT-010 protected against Dox-induced myocardiopathy via inhibiting downstream molecular  in response to oxidative stress, including reactive oxygen species-mediated MAPK signaling  ERK and JNK, and apoptotic  involving the activation of caspase 3, caspase 7, and PARP signaling. Recent studies also suggest the importance of alterations in cardiac autophagy in Dox cardiotoxicity. We further showed that DT-010 could inhibit the induction of autophagosomes formation by Dox via regulating the upstream Akt/AMPK/mTOR signaling. Since Dox-induced cardiotoxicity is multifactorial, our results suggest that multi-functional agent such as DT-010 might be an effective therapeutic agent for combating cardiotoxicity associated with chemotherapeutic agents such as Dox.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Arginine is a substrate for NO, whereas the methylated arginines-asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA)-are endogenous by-products of proteolysis that inhibit NO production.We investigated if high-plasma levels of ADMA, SDMA, and arginine/ADMA ratio were associated with 90-day mortality in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.We included 267 adult patients admitted to intensive care unit with severe sepsis or septic shock. The patients had previously been included in the randomized controlled trial "Scandinavian Starch for Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock ()." ADMA, SDMA, and arginine/ADMA ratio were measured in plasma. The risk of death within 90 days was estimated in multivariate Cox regression analyses adjusted for gender, age ≥65 years, major cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, respiratory failure, vasopressor treatment, highest quartile of creatinine and bilirubin, and lowest quartile of platelet count. In the regression analyses missing values were estimated using multiple imputation.Twenty-five patients had missing data in one or more of the baseline variables and 44 patients had missing methylarginine values. Both ADMA and SDMA were independently associated with 90-day mortality (ADMA: hazard ratio 1.54; 95% CI, 1.00-2.38; P = 0.046, and SDMA: hazard ratio 1.78; 95% CI, 1.14-2.72; P = 0.011). Arginine/ADMA ratio was not associated with 90-day mortality neither in univariate nor in multivariate analyses. The difference in mortality between patients with high and low ADMA was most pronounced in the first week after inclusion.High levels of ADMA and SDMA in plasma were associated with increased 90-day mortality in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Interfering with the methylarginine-NO systems may be a novel target in these patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27886108>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of trans-β-Aryl-δ-hydroxy-γ-lactones and Enzymatic Kinetic Resolution of Their Racemic Mixtures.</a></h2><p>Two novel and convenient routes to obtain enantiomerically enriched -β-aryl-δ-hydroxy-γ-lactones - with potential antifeedant and anticancer activity were developed. In the first method starting from corresponding enantiomers of γ,δ-unsaturated esters - derived from enzymatically resolved allyl alcohols -, both enantiomers of hydroxylactones - were synthesized with high enantiomeric excesses (73%-97%). Configurations of the stereogenic centers of the synthesized compounds were assigned based on the mechanism of acidic lactonization of esters - in the presence of -chloroperbenzoic acid (-CPBA). An alternative method for the production of optically active β-aryl-δ-hydroxy-γ-lactones - was lipase-catalyzed kinetic resolution of their racemic mixtures by transesterification with vinyl propionate as the acyl donor. The most efficient enzyme in the screening procedure was lipase B from . Its application on a preparative scale after 6 h afforded unreacted (+)-(4,5,6)-hydroxylactones - and (+)-(4,5,6)-propionates -, most of them with high enantiomeric excesses (92%-98%). Resolution of lactone  with bulky 1,3-benzodioxol ring provided products with significantly lower optical purity ( = 89% and 84% for hydroxylactone  and propionate , respectively). The elaborated methods give access to both enantiomers of β-aryl-δ-hydroxy-γ-lactones - with the defined absolute configurations of stereogenic centers, which is crucial requirement for the investigations of relationship: spatial structure-biological activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28527051>New treatments for headache.</a></h2><p>Headache disorders are common worldwide and often disabling.

Carcinogenesis alters lipid  to facilitate cell growth and survival. For instance, metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are associated with increasing colon cell proliferation. Moreover, precancerous colon lesions (i.e. adenomas) increase the risk for colorectal cancer. In this study, we investigated associations between plasma PUFAs and the number of colon polyps and polyp type (i.e. hyperplastic and adenoma). Healthy male participants (n=126) of 48-65 years of age were recruited before a routine colonoscopy screening. Plasma phospholipid (PPL) PUFAs were isolated by means of solid phase extraction and methylated. Fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed using gas chromatography. Factor analysis was used to cluster PUFAs into groups, and then generated factors and individual PUFAs were analyzed using polytomous logistic regression. In our age-adjusted and smoking-adjusted polytomous logistic regression, for each unit increase in PPL docosatetraenoic acid (DTA), individuals were 1.43 (1.00-2.06) and 1.33 (0.99-1.80) times more likely to have hyperplastic polyps and adenomas rather than no polyps, respectively. In our factor analysis, high PPL ω-6 PUFA and trans-fatty acid loading scores were associated with increased odds of adenoma presence rather than no polyps. Increases in long-chain PPL ω-6 PUFAs are associated with an increased risk for adenomas. As relative levels of DTA increase in PPLs, individuals had increased odds of having hyperplastic polyps and adenomas. Elevated conversion of ω-6 PUFAs to longer-chain ω- such as DTA may indicate altered PUFA  at the tissue level.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28574385>[CONNECTIVE TISSUE  FEATURES IN CLIMACTERIC SYNDROME'S PATIENTS WITH VARIOUS TYPES OF MENOPAUSE].</a></h2><p>The purpose of the study was investigation of the connective tissue  features among women with menopausal syndrome (MS) and MS, in which the arthropathic syndrome is leading and comparative analysis of the connective tissue indicators exchange during menopause caused in a surgical and natural way. We examined 70 women in total, menopause duration they accounted for 1,95±1,1 years, it came both as natural, and as a result of a surgery. The main group included 40 women with MS with leading arthropathic syndrome. The patients' modified menopausal index was calculated (MMI), the functional condition of the joints was assessed on a scale-questionnaire with the calculation of the clinical-functional index of WOMAC; the quantitative content and qualitative composition of glycosaminoglycans in the serum, the urinary excretion of hydroxyproline and uronic acids were determined. To determine the degree of deviation from the control (standard) indicators was used non-parametric Mann-Whitney criterion and factor analysis (main components method). It was revealed that all patients have an increased content of glycosaminoglycans and glycoprotein in the blood, which corresponds to the general age-related rearrangement of connective tissue , but the patients of the main group have more expressed indictors, which corresponds to more severe dystrophic changes and the severity of clinical symptoms. Redistribution of the fractional composition of glycosaminoglycans towards the increase of chondroitin-6 sulfate in patients of the main group indicates the presence of pre-emptive destruction of cartilage. The arthropathic syndrome availability also confirms the significant reduction CI- / CI-4s ratio and an increased content of chondroitin sulfates. Patients with a natural type of menopause showed more pronounced changes in connective tissue metabolites, in contrast to patients with surgical menopause еhat indicates a longer and more invasive pathologic course of natural menopause.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29746273>Therapeutic Engineered Hydrogel Coatings Attenuate the Foreign Body Response in Submuscular Implants.</a></h2><p>Biomedical devices are implanted into mammalian soft tissues to improve, monitor, or restore form or function. The utility of these implants is limited by the subsequent foreign body response (FBR), beginning with inflammation and terminating in a collagen envelope around the device, known as the capsule. This capsule then can contract and distort the shape of the device or limit its effectiveness in interacting with the surrounding host tissues. In the current study, we investigated the effect of therapeutic collagen-coated silicone discs in a rat model of the FBR.A 3-dimensional printed mold was used to fabricate collagen-coated silicone discs incorporating 3 therapeutic agents: colchicine, a function-blocking antibody against interleukin 8 (IL-8) receptor B, and a powerful anti-inflammatory steroid, dexamethasone. Discs were implanted submuscularly into a well-characterized rat model of the FBR and evaluated for inflammatory response, fibrotic development, and cytokine release.Coated silicone discs exhibited reduced collagen deposition and little to no foreign body giant cells at the host-silicone interface when compared with the silicone-only group. Therapeutic hydrogels demonstrate a significant decrease in cellular infiltration into the coatings over the 2-week time point in contrast to therapeutic-free hydrogel coatings. Cytokine analysis revealed significant differences between therapeutic-free and therapeutic-containing coatings when compared with silicone-only controls. Levels of IL-1β, IL-6, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, and macrophage inflammatory protein 3α were affected 48 hours after implantation, while differences in IL-18, growth-regulated oncogene/keratinocyte chemoattractant, and macrophage inflammatory protein 3α were observed 1 week after implantation.By utilizing the host's innate immune response, our engineered hydrogel coatings delivered therapeutic moieties directly to the implant microenvironment, thus delaying the FBR up to 2 weeks.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28447203>The effectiveness of daily supplementation with 400 or 800 µg/day folate in reaching protective red blood folate concentrations in non-pregnant women: a randomized trial.</a></h2><p>Folate required to achieve desirable red blood cell (RBC) folate concentrations within 4-8 weeks pre-pregnancy is not known. We studied the effect of supplementation with 400 or 800 µg/day folate in achieving RBC-folate ≥906 nmol/L.Non-pregnant women were randomized to receive multinutrient supplements containing 400 µg/day (n = 100) or 800 µg/day (n = 101) folate [folic acid and ()-5-CH-Hfolate-Ca (1:1)]. The changes of folate biomarkers were studied after 4 and 8 weeks in the 198 women who returned at least for visit 2.At baseline, 12 of the 198 participants (6.1%) had RBC-folate <340 nmol/L, but 88% had levels <906 nmol/L. The RBC-folate concentrations increased significantly in the 800 µg/day (mean ± SD = 652 ± 295 at baseline; 928 ± 330 at 4 weeks; and 1218 ± 435 nmol/L at 8 weeks) compared with the 400 µg/day [632 ± 285 at baseline (p = 0.578); 805 ± 363 at 4 weeks (p < 0.001); 1021 ± 414 nmol/L at 8 weeks (p < 0.001)]. The changes of RBC-folate were greater in the 800 µg/day than in the 400 µg/day at any time (changes after 8 weeks: 566 ± 260 vs. 389 ± 229 nmol/L; p < 0.001). Significantly more women in the 800 µg group achieved desirable RBC-folate concentrations at 4 weeks (45.5 vs. 31.3%; p = 0.041) or 8 weeks (83.8 vs. 54.5%; p < 0.001) compared with the 400 µg group. RBC-folate levels below the population median (590 nmol/L) were associated with a reduced response to supplements.88% of the women had insufficient RBC-folate to prevent birth defects, while 6.1% had deficiency. Women with low RBC-folate were unlikely to achieve desirable levels within 4-8 weeks, unless they receive 800 µg/day.

However, this function only becomes apparent when other processing enzymes are absent, raising the question of its primary physiological role. Here, we show that RNase BN itself is subject to growth phase-dependent regulation, because both rbn mRNA and RNase BN protein are at their highest levels in early exponential phase, but then decrease dramatically and are essentially absent in stationary phase. As a consequence of this variation, certain small RNAs, such as  RNA, remain low in exponential phase cells, and increase greatly in stationary phase. RNase BN affects  RNA abundance by decreasing its stability in exponential phase. RNase BN levels increase rapidly as cells exit stationary phase and are primarily responsible for the decrease in  RNA that accompanies this process. Purified RNase BN directly cleaves  RNA as shown by in vitro assays, and the  RNA:pRNA duplex is an even more favorable substrate of RNase BN. The exoribonuclease activity of RNase BN is unnecessary because all its action on  RNA is due to endonucleolytic cleavages. These data indicate that RNase BN plays an important role in determining levels of the global transcription regulator,  RNA, throughout the growth cycle.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28403055>Immunogenicity and Safety of 10-valent Pneumococcal Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae Protein D Conjugate Vaccine (PHiD-CV) Administered to Children With Sickle Cell Disease Between 8 Weeks and 2 Years of Age: A Phase III, Open, Controlled Study.</a></h2><p>Immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of the 10-valent pneumococcal nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) were evaluated in children with sickle cell disease (SCD), who are at increased risk for infections.In this phase III, open-label, single-center, controlled study in Burkina Faso (), children with SCD (S) or without SCD (NS) were assigned to 6 groups (N = 300): children 8-11 weeks of age (<6 months; < and <6NS groups) received 3 primary doses and a booster dose of PHiD-CV coadministered with routine childhood vaccines; children 7-11 months of age (7-11S and 7-11NS groups) received 2 primary doses and a booster dose of PHiD-CV; children 12-23 months of age (12-23S and 12-23NS groups) received 2 catch-up doses of PHiD-CV.

The subject of our interest was a possible relationship between a configuration of chiral centers of the studied lactones and their anticancer potency against a panel of canine cell lines representing hematopoietic (CLBL-1, GL-1, CL-1, CLB70) and mammary gland cancers (P114, CMT-U27, CMT-U309). To determine the anticancer activity of the tested compounds, cell viability and cell  activity were checked using propidium iodide staining and the MTT test. To determine whether the studied compounds cause necrotic or apoptotic cell death, two assays for apoptosis evaluation were performed, annexin V staining and detection of caspase 3/7 activation. Simultaneously, the effects of the compounds on the cell cycle were also examined. The conducted research confirmed the anticancer potential of the tested lactones against canine cancers. The investigated isomers exerted higher activity against canine lymphoma/leukemia cell lines than against mammary tumors, whereas the configuration of stereogenic centers of the examined compounds affected their activity. It has been shown that stereoisomers with 4S configuration (2,4) were more active, and the most potent one was the cis-(4S,5S,6R)-2 isomer. The investigated lactones seemed to initiate the process of apoptosis rather than acting as typical cytostatic agents, as cell death via apoptosis, and no increase in G2-M population in the cell cycle analysis were observed. The presented study demonstrated that all four stereoisomers of δ-iodo-γ-lactones with p-isopropylphenyl substituent at β-position induced apoptosis via a mitochondrial-mediated, caspase-dependent pathway.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This risk can be minimized by assuring that the donor has a low titer of anti-A and anti-B. The level of these naturally occurring antibodies has been shown to be increased by vaccination with most biologically derived vaccines. This boostering effect has been investigated for the new generation of vaccines.The 120 crew members of a Swedish naval ship deployed for 7 months to the Indian Ocean were tested for anti-A and anti-B before their predeployment vaccination program and after returning to Sweden. The vaccination program contained vaccines against cholera, diphtheria, hepatitis A and B, influenza, measles, meningitis, mumps, pertussis, polio, rubella, TBE virus, tetanus, typhus and yellow fever. Paired antibody titrations were performed for both IgM and IgG using microtube gelcards (Diamed GMBH).No crew member, including the six belonging to the "high titer" group, showed a sign of a booster effect by any of the used vaccines.The earlier reported boostering effects mediated by different vaccines cannot be replicated with the new vaccines of today.

()-8-Methyl-6,9-diazaspiro[4.5]decan-7,10-dione (alaptide), has been studied as a potential chemical permeation enhancer. Based on its structure, four selected piperazine-2,5-diones were synthesized by means of multi-step synthetic . All the compounds were investigated on their ability to enhance the permeation of the model drug theophylline from the hydrophilic medium propylene glycol:water (1:1). In vitro experiments were performed using vertical Franz diffusion cells at constant temperature 34 ± 0.5 °C and using full-thickness pig ( f. ) ear skin. Withdrawn samples were analyzed by RP-HPLC for determination of the permeated amount of theophylline. All the compounds were applied in ratio 1:10 (/) relative to the amount of theophylline. One hour after application, the permeated amount of theophylline from formulations with alaptide and (3,6)-3,6-dimethylpiperazine-2,5-dione, was ca. 15- and 12-fold higher, respectively, than from the formulation without the tested compounds. Despite the enhancement ratio of both enhancers in a steady state was ca. 2.3, the pseudo-enhancement ratio in the time range from 1 to 3 h was 4.4. These enhancement ratios indicate that the compounds are able to enhance the permeation of agents through the skin; however, the short-term application of both compound formulations seems to be more advantageous.

The antidepressant effects of (R,S)-ketamine have been linked to its conversion into (2S,;2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK); however, the connection between structure and stereochemistry of ketamine and HNK in the mitochondrial homeostatic response has not yet been fully elucidated at a  level.We used a multi-platform, non-targeted metabolomics approach to study the change in mitochondrial metabolome of PC-12 cells treated with ketamine and HNK enantiomers. The identified metabolites were grouped into  in order to assess global responses.Treatment with (2R,6R)-HNK elicited the significant change in 49 metabolites and associated  implicated in fundamental mitochondrial functions such as TCA cycle, branched-chain amino acid biosynthetic pathway, glycoxylate  pathway, and fatty acid β-oxidation. The affected metabolites included glycerate, citrate, leucine, N,N-dimethylglycine, 3-hexenedioic acid, and carnitine and attenuated signals associated with 9 fatty acids and elaidic acid. Important metabolites involved in the purine and pyrimidine  were also affected by (2R-6R)-HNK. This global  profile was not as strongly impacted by treatment with (2S,)-HNK, (R)- and (S)-ketamine and in some instances opposite effects were observed.The present data provide an overall view of the  changes in mitochondrial function produced by (2R,6R)-HNK and related ketamine compounds and offer an insight into the source of the observed variance in antidepressant response elicited by the compounds.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The role of isolated natural products in the interaction between S. albospinus RLe7 and the fungus Coniochaeta sp. FLe4, an endophyte from the same plant, was investigated. None of these isolated actinobacterial compounds were able to inhibit the fungus or induce the fungal red pigmentation observed when both endophytes interact. Further investigation using mass spectrometry approaches enabled identifying the well-known antifungal compound amphotericin B (9) as a microbial metabolite of S. albospinus RLe7.

However, the mechanism by which this occurs continues to be nebulous. The relationship between OPN and inflammation-suppressing lymphocytes present in the human AAA condition was investigated and presented herein.Serum OPN concentrations were measured in healthy, risk factor-matched non-AAA and AAA patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the source of OPN secretion using aortic tissue collected from multiorgan donors and AAA patients undergoing open surgical repair. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were exposed to various inflammatory mediators, and OPN expression was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and ELISA. The inflammatory nature of OPN and the aortic wall was determined using a TR1 suppressor cell induction assay as a surrogate and characterized by ELISA and fluorescence-activated cell sorting.OPN was found to be elevated in both the plasma and aortic homogenate of AAA patients compared with controls. On immunohistochemistry, OPN localized to the tunica media of the diseased aorta but was minimally expressed in healthy aorta. In vitro, cigarette smoke extract was the most potent stimulator of OPN secretion by VSMCs and increased both messenger RNA and supernatant concentrations. OPN demonstrated an ability to inhibit the induction of interleukin 10-secreting TR1 lymphocytes, a depleted population in the AAA patient, from naive precursors. Last, neutralizing receptor targets of OPN in the setting of AAA homogenate coincubation abrogated the inhibition of TR1 induction.OPN, secreted by the VSMCs of the tunica media, is elevated in the circulating plasma and aortic wall of patients with AAA. It can inhibit the induction of the TR1 suppressor cell, leading to an overall proinflammatory state contributing to progressive aortic wall breakdown and dilation.Copyright © 2017 Society for Vascular Surgery.

Tyramine was detected by the electrochemical reduction at -0.1V of the o- enzymatically-formed dopaquinone. Three different CaPs were explored as immobilization systems, monetite, brushite and brushite cement. Biosensors based on brushite matrices provide better analytical properties than the monetite one. Compared to brushite, a 10-fold increase of sensitivity was obtained with the brushite cement-based biosensor, which highlights the effect of brushite crystal formation in the presence of the enzyme in the biosensor performance. Several variables involved in the enzyme immobilization method such as glutaraldehyde cross-linking time, PPO/brushite ratio and thickness of the brushite-enzyme film were investigated. Furthermore, the effects of pH and temperature on biosensor performance were also optimized. Brushite cement-PPO-GA biosensor resulted in a reliable, highly sensitive, fast, inexpensive and easy analytical method for tyramine detection. Under optimal conditions (time of 15min, a ratio of 1.0 and 50μg of the brushite-enzyme mixture, 20°C and pH 6,0), a linear range of 5.8 × 10 to 1.6 × 10, sensitivity 1.50 × 10mAM cm, detection limit, 4.85 × 10M and a response time,  were obtained. The suitability of the proposed biosensor to determine the tyramine content in cheese samples has been explored. The mean analytical recovery of added tyramine in gouda and brie cheeses were found to be 95.5±5.8 and 96.9±7.5 respectively. A study of the tyramine content evolution over the course of a week under inadequate storage showed the importance of monitoring the degradation of certain foods.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Plasma transfusion may modulate innate immune responses; however, little is known about the immunomodulatory potential of various plasma products. We conducted in vitro experiments to determine the effects of fresh frozen plasma, thawed plasma, solvent/detergent plasma, and an investigational spray-dried solvent/detergent plasma product on monocyte function.Monocytes were isolated from healthy adult volunteers and cocultured with aliquots of autologous plasma (control), fresh frozen plasma, thawed plasma, solvent/detergent treated plasma, or spray-dried solvent/detergent plasma. Monocyte function was assessed by cytokine production with and without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, and flow cytometric assessment of HLA-DR cell surface expression.Monocyte cytokine production was not significantly altered after exposure to fresh frozen plasma or thawed plasma. In the absence of LPS, spray-dried solvent/detergent plasma exposure resulted in markedly increased IL-8 production compared to other plasma groups and controls (p = 0.01, analysis of variance [ANOVA]). Likewise, spray-dried SD plasma exposure resulted in higher LPS-induced IL-8, TNFα, and IL-1β production compared with autologous plasma controls (p < 0.0001; p < 0.0001, p = 0.002, respectively; ANOVA). LPS-induced IL-8 and TNFα production was lowest after exposure to solvent/detergent plasma (p < 0.0001, ANOVA).Exposure to spray-dried solvent/detergent plasma resulted in marked augmentation of monocyte inflammatory cytokine production.

Despite the availability of numerous monoaminergic-based antidepressants, most patients require several weeks, if not months, to respond to these treatments, and many patients never attain sustained remission of their symptoms. The non-competitive, glutamatergic NMDAR (N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor) antagonist (R,S)-ketamine exerts rapid and sustained antidepressant effects after a single dose in patients with depression, but its use is associated with undesirable side effects. Here we show that the  of (R,S)-ketamine to (2S,;2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK) is essential for its antidepressant effects, and that the (2R,6R)-HNK enantiomer exerts behavioural, electroencephalographic, electrophysiological and cellular antidepressant-related actions in mice. These antidepressant actions are independent of NMDAR inhibition but involve early and sustained activation of AMPARs (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptors). We also establish that (2R,6R)-HNK lacks ketamine-related side effects. Our data implicate a novel mechanism underlying the antidepressant properties of (R,S)-ketamine and have relevance for the development of next-generation, rapid-acting antidepressants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28826477>The divergent mitotic kinesin MKLP2 exhibits atypical structure and mechanochemistry.</a></h2><p>MKLP2, a kinesin-6, has critical roles during the metaphase-anaphase transition and cytokinesis. Its motor domain contains conserved nucleotide binding motifs, but is divergent in sequence (~35% identity) and size (~40% larger) compared to other kinesins. Using cryo-electron microscopy and biophysical assays, we have undertaken a mechanochemical dissection of the microtubule-bound MKLP2 motor domain during its ATPase cycle, and show that many facets of its mechanism are distinct from other kinesins. While the MKLP2 neck-linker is directed towards the microtubule plus-end in an ATP-like state, it does not fully dock along the motor domain. Furthermore, the footprint of the MKLP2 motor domain on the MT surface is altered compared to motile kinesins, and enhanced by kinesin-6-specific sequences. The conformation of the highly extended loop6 insertion characteristic of kinesin- is nucleotide-independent and does not contact the MT surface. Our results emphasize the role of family-specific insertions in modulating kinesin motor function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29981905>Impulse response timing differences in BOLD and CBV weighted fMRI.</a></h2><p>Recent advances in BOLD fMRI scan techniques have substantially improved spatial and temporal resolution, currently reaching to sub-millimeter and sub-second levels respectively. Unfortunately, there remain physiological barriers that prevent achieving this resolution in practice. BOLD contrast relies on the hemodynamic response to neuronal activity, whose associated cerebral blood oxygenation (CBO) changes may spread over several millimeters and last several seconds. Recent reports have suggested that significant improvements may be possible with cerebral blood volume (CBV)-weighted fMRI, which highlights the CBV changes rather than the BOLD changes associated with the hemodynamic response. Nevertheless, quantitative comparisons between CBV and BOLD are sparse, in particular regarding their temporal characteristics in human brain. To address this, we studied a cohort of subjects that received injection of ferumoxytol, an intravascular iron-oxide based contrast agent that introduces strong CBV contrast. An event-related visual stimulus paradigm was used to compare the impulse response (IR) for CBV and BOLD contrast, obtained with and without ferumoxytol, respectively. Experiments performed at 7 T (n = 5) at 1.2-1.5 mm spatial and 1 s temporal resolution showed that the onset time and time-to-peak of the CBV IR averaged 0.8 and 3.5 s respectively, both 0.6 s shorter than the BOLD IR. While significant, these improvements are relatively small and not expected to lead to practical advantages for the extraction of temporal information about neural activity. Nonlinearities in the observed IR were also compared and found to be similar between the CBV and BOLD, indicating that these are likely not caused by a 'ceiling' effect in the CBO response, but rather support a previously proposed model of vascular compliance, in which changes in vascular tone elicited by a preceding stimulus affect the IR.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29673813>Serum concentrations of folate vitamers in patients with a newly diagnosed prostate cancer or hyperplasia.</a></h2><p>Folate is required for synthesis of methyl groups and DNA in growing cells.

Currently, no drugs to prevent or to treat I/R injury are approved for clinical use. C1 inhibitor (C1 INH) is known to reduce activation of the plasma cascade systems that are involved in the pathophysiologic process of I/R injury. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the effect of C1 INH on complement deposition and endothelial cell activation in a rat model of hind limb I/R injury.Male Wistar rats (wild type, bred at the central animal facility, University of Bern), weighing 250 to 320 g, were used. The rats underwent 2-hour ischemia and 24-hour reperfusion by unilateral clamping of the femoral artery and additional use of a tourniquet. Five groups were divided according to intravenous treatment 5 minutes before ischemia: 50 IU/kg C1 INH (n = 5); 100 IU/kg C1 INH (n = 7); vehicle control (n = 5); nontreated control (n = 7); and normal, healthy control without intervention (n = 4). At the end, muscle edema, tissue viability, and histologic features were assessed. Deposition of immunoglobulin M, C1r, C4d, and fibrin and expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, heparan sulfate (HS), E-selectin, and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 were evaluated by fluorescence staining. In addition, high-mobility group box 1 protein was measured in plasma.Edema formation was reduced by C1 INH at two dosages, mirrored by improved histologic injury scores and preserved muscle viability. Deposition of immunoglobulin M, C4d, and fibrin was significantly decreased by 100 IU/kg C1 INH compared with nontreated controls. Pretreatment with 100 IU/kg C1 INH also significantly reduced HS shedding and expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 as well as plasma levels of high-mobility group box 1 protein.Pretreatment with both 50 and 100 IU/kg C1 INH attenuated reperfusion injury of rat hind limbs. Pretreatment with 100 IU/kg also preserved the endothelial HS layer as well as the natural, profibrinolytic phenotype of the endothelium. Prevention of endothelial cell activation by C1 INH may therefore be a promising strategy to prevent I/R injury in the clinical setting of peripheral vascular diseases and elective surgery on extremities.Copyright © 2017 Society for Vascular Surgery.

Folate-independent  are mediated by cytosolic alcohol dehydrogenase 5 (ADH5) and mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), which generate formate by oxidizing formaldehyde. Formate is a potential biomarker of B-vitamin-dependent one-carbon . This study investigated the contributions of ADH5 and ALDH2 to formate production and folate-dependent de novo purine and dTMP synthesis in HepG2 cells. knockout and ALDH2 knockdown HepG2 cells were cultured in folate-deficient [0 nM () 5-formyltetrahydrofolate] or folate-sufficient [25 nM () 5-formyltetrahydrofolate] medium. Purine biosynthesis was quantified as the ratio of [C]-formate to [H]-hypoxanthine incorporated into genomic DNA, which indicates the contribution of the de novo purine synthesis pathway relative to salvage synthesis. dTMP synthesis was quantified as the ratio of [C]-deoxyuridine to [H]-thymidine incorporation into genomic DNA, which indicates the capacity of de novo dTMP synthesis relative to salvage synthesis. The [C]-formate-to-[H]-hypoxanthine ratio was greater in  knockout than in wild-type HepG2 cells, under conditions of both folate deficiency (+30%;  < 0.001) and folate sufficiency (+22%;  = 0.02). These data indicate that ADH5 deficiency increases the use of exogenous formate for de novo purine biosynthesis. The [C]-deoxyuridine-to-[H]-thymidine ratio did not differ between  knockout and wild-type cells, indicating that ADH5 deficiency does not affect de novo dTMP synthesis capacity relative to salvage synthesis. Under folate deficiency, ALDH2 knockdown cells exhibited a 37% lower ratio of [C]-formate to [H]-hypoxanthine ( < 0.001) compared with wild-type HepG2 cells, indicating decreased use of exogenous formate, or increased endogenous formate synthesis, for de novo purine biosynthesis. In HepG2 cells, ADH5 is a source of formate for de novo purine biosynthesis, especially during folate deficiency when folate-dependent formate production is limited. Formate is also shown to be limiting in the growth of HepG2 cells.© 2017 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28388376>How Much and What Type of Protein Should a Critically Ill Patient Receive?</a></h2><p>Protein loss, manifested as loss of muscle mass, is observed universally in all critically ill patients. Depletion of muscle mass is associated with impaired function and poor outcomes. In extreme cases, protein malnutrition is manifested by respiratory failure, lack of wound healing, and immune dysfunction. Protecting muscle loss focused initially on meeting energy requirements. The assumption was that protein was being used (through oxidation) as an energy source. In healthy individuals, small amounts of glucose (approximately 400 calories) protect muscle loss and decrease amino acid oxidation (protein-sparing effect of glucose). Despite expectations of the benefits, the high provision of energy (above basal energy requirements) through the delivery of nonprotein calories has failed to demonstrate a clear benefit at curtailing protein loss. The protein-sparing effect of glucose is not clearly observed during illness. Increasing protein delivery beyond the normal nutrition requirements (0.8 g/k/d) has been investigated as an alternative solution. Over a dozen observational studies in critically ill patients suggest that higher protein delivery is beneficial at protecting muscle mass and associated with improved outcomes (decrease in mortality). Not surprisingly, new Society of Critical Care Medicine/American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition guidelines and expert recommendations suggest higher protein delivery (>1.2 g/kg/d) for critically ill patients. This article provides an introduction to the concepts that delineate the basic principles of modern medical nutrition therapy as it relates to the goal of achieving an optimal management of protein  during critical care illness, highlighting successes achieved so far but also placing significant challenges limiting our success in perspective.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29567028>Analysis of host Toll-like receptor 3 and RIG-I-like receptor gene expression in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm.</a></h2><p>Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a vascular disease relatively common in the elderly population. Although some events that contribute to the development and progression of AAA are known, there are limited data examining the association of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and RIG-I-like receptor expression with the pathogenesis of AAAs. In this study, we investigated the gene and protein expression of TLR3 and RIG-I-like receptors (RIG-I and MDA5) in aortic wall and blood of AAA patients and examined the relationship between their expression and immune response.Total RNA was extracted from aortic wall tissues and blood samples collected from 20 patients with AAA and blood samples of 17 healthy volunteers without aortic aneurysm. To evaluate the DDX58 (RIG-I), IFIH1 (MDA5), and TLR3 gene expression level, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used. Extracellular cytokine and pattern recognition receptor levels were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5 were constitutively expressed in both aortic tissues and blood samples from AAA patients and healthy volunteers. In patients with AAA, higher TLR3 expression in aortic tissues than in blood was found (P = .004). The DDX58 messenger RNA expression was higher in blood of patients with AAA compared with healthy subjects (P = .021). A significantly higher level of plasma interleukin 4 was noticed in patients with AAA than in healthy individuals (P = .008).This study suggests that RIG-I and TLR3 seem to be important factors in the pathogenesis of AAA.Copyright © 2017 Society for Vascular Surgery.

Although the direct-acting antivirals targeting HCV replication have revolutionized the treatment of hepatitis C, several obstacles persist, including resistance development, potential side-effects, and the prohibitive cost that limits their availability. Furthermore, treatment of HCV re-infection in liver transplantation remains a significant challenge. Developing novel antivirals that target viral entry could help expand the scope of HCV therapeutics and treatment strategies. Herein, we report (4R,)-2-dihydromenisdaurilide (DHMD), a natural butenolide, as an efficient inhibitor of HCV entry. Specifically, DHMD potently inhibited HCV infection at non-cytotoxic concentration. Examination on the viral life cycle demonstrated that DHMD selectively targeted the early steps of infection while leaving viral replication/translation and assembly/release unaffected. Furthermore, DHMD did not induce an antiviral interferon response. Mechanistic dissection of HCV entry revealed that DHMD could inactivate cell-free virus, abrogate viral attachment, and inhibit viral entry/fusion, with the most pronounced effect observed against the viral adsorption phase as validated using ELISA and confocal microscopy. Due to its potency, DHMD may be of value for further development as an entry inhibitor against HCV, particularly for application in transplant setting.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28747322>Ribonucleoprotein purification and characterization using RNA Mango.</a></h2><p>The characterization of RNA-protein complexes (RNPs) is a difficult but increasingly important problem in modern biology. By combining the compact RNA Mango aptamer with a fluorogenic thiazole orange desthiobiotin (TO1-Dtb or TO3-Dtb) ligand, we have created an RNA tagging system that simplifies the purification and subsequent characterization of endogenous RNPs. Mango-tagged RNP complexes can be immobilized on a streptavidin solid support and recovered in their native state by the addition of free biotin. Furthermore, Mango-based RNP purification can be adapted to different scales of RNP isolation ranging from pull-down assays to the isolation of large amounts of biochemically defined cellular RNPs. We have incorporated the Mango aptamer into the  U1 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), shown that the Mango-snRNA is functional in cells, and used the aptamer to pull down a U1 snRNA-associated protein. To demonstrate large-scale isolation of RNPs, we purified and characterized bacterial RNA polymerase holoenzyme (HE) in complex with a Mango-containing  RNA. We were able to use the combination of a red-shifted TO3-Dtb ligand and eGFP-tagged HE to follow the binding and release of the  RNA by two-color native gel analysis as well as by single-molecule fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy. Together these experiments demonstrate how the Mango aptamer in conjunction with simple derivatives of its flurophore ligands enables the purification and characterization of endogenous cellular RNPs in vitro.© 2017 Panchapakesan et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press for the RNA Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30046777>Synthesis and physicochemical characterization of ()-5-formiminotetrahydrofolate; a reference standard for metabolomics.</a></h2><p>The one-carbon carrier of the formate oxidation level derived from the interaction of tetrahydrofolate and formiminoglutamate, which has been tentatively identified as 5-formiminoltetrahydrofolate, has been prepared by chemical synthesis. Treatment of a solution of ()-tetrahydrofolate in aqueous base with excess ethyl formimidate in the presence of anti-oxidant under anaerobic conditions afforded a gummy solid which, based on mass spectral analysis, conformed to a monoformimino derivative of tetrahydrofolate. Further physicochemical characterization by validated methods strongly suggested that the product of chemical synthesis was identical to the enzymatically produced material and that it was, in fact, ()-5-formiminotetrahydrofolate. Conditions and handling methods toward maintaining the integrity of this highly sensitive compound were identified and are described, as is analytical methodology, useful for research studies using it.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29177350>Chalcogenide substitution in the [2Fe] cluster of [FeFe]-hydrogenases conserves high enzymatic activity.</a></h2><p>[FeFe]-Hydrogenases efficiently catalyze the uptake and evolution of H due to the presence of an inorganic [6Fe-]-cofactor (H-cluster). This cofactor is comprised of a [4Fe-4S] cluster coupled to a unique [2Fe] cluster where the catalytic turnover of H/H takes place. We herein report on the synthesis of a selenium substituted [2Fe] cluster [Fe{μ(SeCH)NH}(CO)(CN)] (ADSe) and its successful in vitro integration into the native protein scaffold of [FeFe]-hydrogenases HydA1 from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and CpI from Clostridium pasteurianum yielding fully active enzymes (HydA1-ADSe and CpI-ADSe). FT-IR spectroscopy and X-ray structure analysis confirmed the presence of structurally intact ADSe at the active site. Electrochemical assays reveal that the selenium containing enzymes are more biased towards hydrogen production than their native counterparts. In contrast to previous chalcogenide exchange studies, the S to Se exchange herein is not based on a simple reconstitution approach using ionic cluster constituents but on the in vitro maturation with a pre-synthesized selenium-containing [2Fe] mimic. The combination of biological and chemical methods allowed for the creation of a novel [FeFe]-hydrogenase with a [2Fe2Se]-active site which confers individual catalytic features.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27919258>Preparation and structural determination of four metabolites of senkyunolide I in rats using ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole-time-of-flight tandem mass and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra.</a></h2><p>Senkyunolide I (SEI) is one of the most important bioactive phthalides of Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort.

The ion-pair of ATR and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was used as a suitable ionophore. A graphite paste electrode was modified with ATR-CTAB ion-pair, multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), and an ionic liquid, 1-butyl-3-mtehyl-imidazolium hexafluorophosphate (BMIMPF6). The amounts of electrode ingredients were optimized (graphite powder: paraffin oil: ATR-CTAB: MWCNTs: BMIMPF6 (58:26:5:8:3 w/w%). Surface characterization was done by using scanning electron microscopy. The potential measurements were recorded at optimized pH by using acetate buffer solution (0.1molL(-1), pH5.5). At the above experimental conditions, calibration curve (E vs. log [ATR]) was linear (R(2)=0.9977) in the concentration range of 1.0×10(-9)-1.0×10(-3)molL(-1) (0.0012-1209mgL(-1)) of ATR with a Nernstian slope of 58.14±0.2mV decade(-1), and detection limit of 1.0×10(-9)molL(-1) (0.0013mgL(-1)). After each injection of ATR to the buffer solution, the potential was stabilized in a very short time (average response time~) at 25°C. The modified graphite paste electrode had a long lifetime (>4months). Recovery of the spiked drug to blood serum samples (95.3-98.2%) revealed the reliability of electrode response to ATR. Blood serum samples from consumers were analyzed by the proposed method; the results were comparable with those from HPLC standard method. The potentiometric analysis of ATR tablets by the proposed electrode resulted in a relative error of 0.8% and 1.5% for 20 and 40mg per tablets, respectively. Finally, the electrode was used in potentiometric titration of ATR (1.0×10(-3)molL(-1)) by CTAB (1.0×10(-3)molL(-1)). Excellent accuracy (≈100%) was obtained from the volume of the titrant at the endpoint.Copyright © 2016.

We biolistically transfected astrocytes in rat hippocampal slice cultures to facilitate fluorescent confocal microscopy, and subjected these slices to transient oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD) that causes delayed excitotoxic death of CA1 pyramidal neurons. This insult caused a delayed loss of mitochondria from astrocytic processes and increased colocalization of mitochondria with the autophagosome marker LC3B. The losses of neurons in area CA1 and mitochondria in astrocytic processes were blocked by ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) antagonists, tetrodotoxin, ziconotide (Ca(2+) channel blocker), two inhibitors of reversed Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange (KB-R7943, YM-244769), or two inhibitors of calcineurin (cyclosporin-A, FK506). The effects of OGD were mimicked by NMDA. The glutamate uptake inhibitor (3S)-3-[[3-[[4-(trifluoromethyl)benzoyl]amino]phenyl]methoxy]-l-aspartate increased neuronal loss after OGD or NMDA, and blocked the loss of astrocytic mitochondria. Exogenous glutamate in the presence of iGluR antagonists caused a loss of mitochondria without a decrease in neurons in area CA1. Using the genetic Ca(2+) indicator Lck-GCaMP-, we observed two types of Ca(2+) signals: (1) in the cytoplasm surrounding mitochondria (mitochondrially centered) and (2) traversing the space between mitochondria (extramitochondrial). The spatial spread, kinetics, and frequency of these events were different. The amplitude of both types was doubled and the spread of both types changed by ∼2-fold 24 h after OGD. Together, these data suggest that pathologic activation of glutamate transport and increased astrocytic Ca(2+) through reversed Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange triggers mitochondrial loss and dramatic increases in Ca(2+) signaling in astrocytic processes.Astrocytes, the most abundant cell type in the brain, are vital integrators of signaling and . Each astrocyte consists of many long, thin branches, called processes, which ensheathe vasculature and thousands of synapses. Mitochondria occupy the majority of each process. This occupancy is decreased by ∼50% 24 h after an in vitro model of ischemia/reperfusion injury, due to delayed fragmentation and mitophagy. The mechanism appears to be independent of neuropathology, instead involving an extended period of high glutamate uptake into astrocytes. Our data suggest that mitochondria serve as spatial buffers, and possibly even as a source of calcium signals in astrocytic processes. Loss of mitochondria resulted in drastically altered calcium signaling that could disrupt neurovascular coupling and gliotransmission.Copyright © 2016 the authors 0270-6474/16/367110-19$15.00/0.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28236993>[What role for paraclinical investigations within clinical trials conducted in psychiatric patients?]</a></h2><p>As in the usual care of patients, paraclinical investigations have today only a very modest role in clinical trials in psychiatry, mainly to complete the pre-therapeutical assessments prior to inclusion of subjects or to monitor treatment tolerance. Yet, the accumulation of data in neurosciences suggests the next emergence of biomarkers, whose interest is that they are closely associated to the biological disturbances underlying psychiatric illnesses, and that they are accessible by means of technological tools such as imaging devices. These tools allow to explore the effects on brain of psychotropic medications, such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, or mood stabilizers, in relation to their therapeutic action. The obtained results allow to consider the use of such biomarkers in clinical trials in addition to more conventional approaches. In particular, they could be used as targets to measure brain response to treatment in association with clinical response, to predict a therapeutic response from the neurofunctional characteristics of patients, or to establish the safety profile of drugs on the nervous system. The use of such biomarkers in clinical trials would help to better define the explored populations and their characteristics, as well as the variables to assess, and to better measure the impact of the treatments and their potential harmful effects on the nervous system.© L’Encéphale, Paris, 2016.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30048701>Characterization of the interaction interface and conformational dynamics of human TGIF1 homeodomain upon the binding of consensus DNA.</a></h2><p>The TG interacting factor-1 homeodomain (TGIF1-HD) binds with the consensus DNA motif 5'-TGTCA-3' in gene promoters through its three-amino acid loop extension (TALE) type homeodomain, and then recruits co-regulators to regulate gene expression. Although the solution NMR structure of human TGIF1-HD has been reported previously, little is known about its DNA binding mechanism. NMR titrations have been extensively used to study mechanisms of ligand binding to target proteins; however, an intermediate exchange occurred predominantly between TGIF1-HD in the free and bound states when titrated with the consensus DNA, which resulted in poor-quality NMR spectra and precluded further exploration of its interaction interface and conformational dynamics. Here, the helix α3 of TGIF1-HD was speculated as the specific DNA binding interface by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) experiments, and subsequently confirmed by chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) spectroscopy. In addition, simultaneous conformational changes in other regions, including α1 and α2, were induced by DNA binding, explaining the observation of chemical shift perturbations from extensive residues besides those located in α3. Further, low-populated DNA-bound TGIF1-HD undergoing a slow exchange at a rate of 130.2 ± 3.6 s was derived from the analysis of the CEST data, and two residues, R220 and R221, located in the middle of α3 were identified to be crucial for DNA binding.

Ketamine treatment can produce rapid antidepressant effects in MDD patients, effects that are mediated-at least partially-through glutamatergic neurotransmission. Two active metabolites of ketamine, (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK) and (2S,)-HNK, also appear to play a key role in ketamine's rapid antidepressant effects through the activation of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) glutamate receptors. In the present study, we demonstrated that estrogen plus ketamine or estrogen plus active ketamine metabolites displayed additive effects on the induction of the expression of AMPA receptor subunits. In parallel, the expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) was also significantly upregulated. Even more striking, radioligand binding assays demonstrated that [H]-ketamine can directly bind to ERα (K: 344.5 ± 13 nM). Furthermore, ketamine and its (2R,6R)-HNK and (2S,)-HNK metabolites displayed similar affinity for ERα (IC: 2.31 ± 0.1, 3.40 ± 0.2, and 3.53 ± 0.2 µM, respectively) as determined by [H]-ketamine displacement assays. Finally, induction of AMPA receptors by either estrogens or ketamine and its metabolites was lost when ERα was knocked down or silenced pharmacologically. These results suggest a positive feedback loop by which estrogens can augment the effects of ketamine and its (2R,6R)-HNK and (2S,)-HNK metabolites on the ERα-induced transcription of CYP2A6 and CYP2B6, estrogen inducible enzymes that catalyze ketamine's biotransformation to form the two active metabolites. These observations provide novel insight into ketamine's molecular mechanism(s) of action and have potential implications for the treatment of MDD.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Whereas the injurious effects of surgical preparation of the vein conduit have been extensively studied, little is known about the influence of the clinical environment of the donor leg from which the vein is obtained.We studied the cellular responses of fresh saphenous vein samples obtained before implantation in 46 patients undergoing elective lower extremity bypass surgery. Using an ex vivo model of response to injury, we quantified the outgrowth of cells from explants of the adventitial and medial layers of the vein. We correlated this cellular outgrowth with the clinical characteristics of the patients, including the Wound, Ischemia, and foot Infection classification of the donor leg for ischemia, wounds, and infection as well as smoking and diabetes.Cellular outgrowth was significantly faster and more robust from the adventitial layer than from the medial layer. The factors of leg ischemia (P < .001), smoking (P = .042), and leg infection (P = .045) were associated with impaired overall outgrowth from the adventitial tissue on multivariable analysis. Only ischemia (P = .046) was associated with impaired outgrowth of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) from the medial tissue. Co-culture of adventitial cells and SMCs propagated from vein explants revealed that adventitial cells significantly inhibited the growth of SMCs, whereas SMCs promoted the growth of adventitial cells. The AA genotype of the -838C>A p27 polymorphism (previously associated with superior graft patency) enhanced these effects, whereas the factor of smoking attenuated adventitial cell inhibition of SMC growth. Comparing gene expression, the cells cultured from the media overexpress Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes  associated with inflammation and infection, whereas those from the adventitia overexpress gene families associated with development and stem/progenitor cell maintenance.The adverse clinical environment of the leg may influence the biologic behavior of the cells in the vein wall, especially the adventitial cells. Chronic ischemia was the most significant factor that retards adventitial cell outgrowth. The cells arising from the vein adventitia may be key players in determining a healthy adaptive or a pathologic response to the injuries associated with vein grafting.Copyright © 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery.

Previous studies have reported effects on physical performance after blood donation; however, none have investigated the effects of blood donation on cognitive performance.We describe a prospective double-blinded, randomized, controlled study comprised of a battery of tests: three cognitive tests, and VO2max testing on a cycle ergometer. Testing was performed 7 days before blinded donation (baseline day), immediately after donation (Day 0), and 7 days (Day 7) after donation. The inclusion criteria included being active blood donors at the Haukeland University Hospital blood bank, where eligibility requirements were met on the testing days, and providing informed consent. Participants were randomized to either the experimental (n = 26) or control group (n = 31). Control group participants underwent a 'mock donation" in which a phlebotomy needle was placed but blood was not withdrawn.In the experimental group, mean ± SEM VO2max declined 6% from 41.35 ± 1.7 mLO2/(min·kg) at baseline to 39.0 ± 1.6 mLO2/(min·kg) on Day 0 and increased to 40.51 ± 1.5 mLO2/(min·kg) on Day 7. Comparable values in the control group were 42.1 ± 1.8 mLO2/(min·kg) at baseline, 41.6 ± 1.8 mLO2/(min·kg)) on Day 1 (1% decline from baseline), and 41.8 ± 1.8 mLO2/(min·kg) on Day 7.Comparing scores of all three cognitive tests on Day 0 and Day 7 showed no significant differences (p > 0.05).Our main findings are that executive cognitive and physical performances were well maintained after whole blood donation in healthy blood donors.

Diabetic nephropathy (DN) and cardiomyopathy (DC) are major causes of death. The pathophysiology of DN/DC includes inflammatory and oxidative stress mechanisms. NF-κB is one of the transcription factor that mediates signal transduction processes. Nowadays, it is suggested that inhibition of NF-κB activation could delay the development of DN and DC. 6-shogaol was reported to modulate NF-κB besides its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Therefore, it is worth testing it against diabetic complications. Rats were divided to 4 groups: Normal control (NC), 6-shogaol (), diabetic control (DC), diabetic rats treated with 6-shogaol (DC+). BGL, BUN, serum creatinine, total urine protein, creatine kinase (CK), LDH, NO, TNF-α NF-κB were determined in serum. Heart and kidney tissues were isolated for GSH, MDA, SOD measurement and histopathology. NF-κB was estimated in kidney tissues using immunohistopathology and western blot techniques. Results showed that diabetic rats left untreated for 16 weeks showed kidney injury as evidenced from elevated BUN, serum creatinine, urine protein, TNF-α and NF-κB. Heart tissue damage was evidence from elevated CK, LDH. Diabetic rats simultaneously treated with 6-shogaol showed a protective effect on both kidney and heart as evidenced biochemically and histopathologically.

Ketamine is extensively metabolized to several other metabolites. The major secondary metabolite (2S,;2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (6-hydroxynorketamine) is not an NMDA antagonist. However, it may modulate nociception through negative allosteric modulation of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. We studied whether 6-hydroxynorketamine could affect nociception or the effects of morphine in acute or chronic administration settings. Male Sprague Dawley rats received subcutaneous 6-hydroxynorketamine or ketamine alone or in combination with morphine, as a cotreatment during induction of morphine tolerance, and after the development of tolerance induced by subcutaneous minipumps administering 9.6 mg morphine daily. Tail flick, hot plate, paw pressure and rotarod tests were used. Brain and serum drug concentrations were quantified with high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Ketamine (10 mg/kg), but not 6-hydroxynorketamine (10 and 30 mg/kg), enhanced antinociception and decreased rotarod performance following acute administration either alone or combined with morphine. Ketamine efficiently attenuated morphine tolerance. Acutely administered 6-hydroxynorketamine increased the brain concentration of morphine (by 60%), and brain and serum concentrations of 6-hydroxynorketamine were doubled by morphine pre-treatment. This pharmacokinetic interaction did not, however, lead to altered morphine tolerance. Co-administration of 6-hydroxynorketamine 20 mg/kg twice daily did not influence development of morphine tolerance. Even though morphine and 6-hydroxynorketamine brain concentrations were increased after co-administration, the pharmacokinetic interaction had no effect on acute morphine nociception or tolerance. These results indicate that 6-hydroxynorketamine does not have antinociceptive properties or attenuate opioid tolerance in a similar way as ketamine.© 2017 The Authors.

The effect of agitation and leukoreduction on whole blood stored at 4°C requires investigation, as reductions in hemostatic capacity of whole blood may reduce its efficacy in treating trauma-induced coagulopathy and platelet dysfunction. We hypothesize that agitation of whole blood will not affect hemostatic function and that leukoreduction will reduce hemostatic function of whole blood.In this in vitro randomized controlled study, 21 units of leukoreduced and 20 nonleukoreduced whole blood units were each randomly assigned into four agitation groups. Hemostatic parameters were measured using viscoelastic assays (rotational thromboelastometry-Extrinsic Screening Test (ROTEM-EXTEM) and thromboelastography (TEG) platelet mapping), impedance aggregometry (agonists-adenosine phosphate, arachidonic acid, thrombin receptor activating peptide, and collagen), and a thrombin generation assay from these whole blood units before and after filtration and on 0, 5, 10, and 15 days of storage at 4°C.Leukoreduction compared to nonleukoreduction reduced platelet concentration on Day 0. Viscoelastic measures and thrombin generation parameters revealed significant reduction in hemostatic function between the leukoreduced units and the nonleukoreduced units at a few time points. Leukoreduced units consistently demonstrated reduced platelet aggregation compared to the nonleukoreduced units. Agitation methods did not significantly affect any of the hemostatic parameters examined.Leukoreduction of whole blood with a platelet-sparing filter caused a moderate but significant reduction in some measures of whole blood hemostatic function most evident early in storage. The benefits of leukoreduction should be weighed against the potential reduced hemostatic function of leukoreduced units.

Acute traumatic coagulopathy has historically been defined by a prolonged prothrombin time, although newer, more informative measurements of hemostatic function have been used to improve diagnosis and support clinical decision making. The underlying biochemical mechanisms of and best practice therapeutics for ATC remain under active investigation because of its significant correlation to poor outcomes. The wide range of hypothesized mechanisms for ATC results from the large number of symptoms, phenotypes, and altered states in these patients as observed by multiple research groups. Much like the ancient fable of blind men describing an elephant from their limited perspectives, the limited nature of clinical and laboratory tools used to diagnose coagulopathy or evaluate hemostatic function has made finding causation difficult. The prolonged prothrombin time, degree of fibrinolysis, depletion of coagulation factors and inhibitors, and general failure of the blood have all been identified as being primary indicators for ATC. Therapeutic interventions including recombinant coagulation factors, antifibrinolytics, and blood products have been used with varying degrees of success as they are used to address specific symptoms. To truly understand the causes of ATC, research efforts must recognize the complexity of the hemostatic system and get to the heart of the matter by answering the question: "Is ATC a pathological condition that develops from the observed deficiencies in coagulation, fibrinolysis, and autoregulation, or is ATC an adaptive response generated as the body attempts to restore perfusion and avoid massive organ failure?" Because patient management must proceed without definitive answers regarding the entire causative chain, the current therapeutic focus should be on using what knowledge has been gained to the patient's advantage: control hemorrhage, maintain appropriate homeostatic balances of coagulation proteins, and restore oxygen perfusion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30557831>Unravel a neuroactive sHA sulfation pattern with neurogenesis activity by a library of defined oligosaccharides.</a></h2><p>Sulfated hyaluronic acid (sHA) is chemically synthetic mimetic of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) presenting promising biological functions. Specific sulfation pattern, termed as sulfation code plays critical roles in regulating the binding mode between GAG and proteins. As a structural analogue of chondroitin sulfate (CS), sHA bears much higher molecular weight and is nearly free of other proteoglycan contaminants. These properties make sHA a better bioscaffold to build safer and more functionalized material. However, chemical sulfonation process on naked HA polysaccharide produces random sulfation patterns which makes it difficult in disclosing the SAR. Herein, we utilized sHA and CS oligosaccharides with defined sulfation pattern to unravel the SAR between sHA and neurogenesis. We demonstrate sHA tetrasaccharide bearing 6-O-sulfation (sHA-) but not other sulfation patterns bind to growth factors at nanomolar range and promote the neurite outgrowth of rat E18 hippocampal neurons in vitro. Furthermore, synthetic sHA polysaccharide enriched in 6-O-sulfation also promote the hippocampal neurite outgrowth in vitro.

The method was fully validated with respect to sensitivity, precision, accuracy, matrix effect, extraction recovery, and stability of analytes under various conditions. The method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study of 125 mg/m 6-leucovorin and 62.5 mg/m 6-leucovorin. The results showed that the maximum observed concentrations () of 6-leucovorin and L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate were (3137.917±408.837) and (1679.633±244.132) μg/L, respectively, and the areas under the curve from the time of dosing to the last measurable concentration (AUC) were (7504.883±1185.101) and (14001.214±2868.949) μg/L in the 125 mg/m 6-leucovorin dose group. The  values of 6-leucovorin and L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate were (3187.917±387.298) and (1739.204±224.755) μg/L, respectively, and AUC values were (7426.664±854.825) and (14884.331±1843.353) μg/L in the 62.5 mg/m 6-leucovorin dose group. There were no significant diffe-rences in the main pharmacokinetic parameters between the two dose groups, and the pharmacokinetic characteristics as well as the rate and extent of absorption were consistent. This method can provide technical support for future bioequivalence studies of sodium leucovorin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30796190>Antidepressant-relevant concentrations of the ketamine metabolite (2,6)-hydroxynorketamine do not block NMDA receptor function.</a></h2><p>Preclinical studies indicate that (2,6)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK) is a putative fast-acting antidepressant candidate. Although inhibition of NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) is one mechanism proposed to underlie ketamine's antidepressant and adverse effects, the potency of (2,6)-HNK to inhibit NMDARs has not been established. We used a multidisciplinary approach to determine the effects of (2,6)-HNK on NMDAR function. Antidepressant-relevant behavioral responses and (2,6)-HNK levels in the extracellular compartment of the hippocampus were measured following systemic (2,6)-HNK administration in mice. The effects of ketamine, (2,6)-HNK, and, in some cases, the (2,6)-HNK stereoisomer were evaluated on the following: () NMDA-induced lethality in mice, () NMDAR-mediated field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in the CA1 field of mouse hippocampal slices, () NMDAR-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) and NMDA-evoked currents in CA1 pyramidal neurons of rat hippocampal slices, and () recombinant NMDARs expressed in  oocytes. While a single i.p. injection of 10 mg/kg (2,6)-HNK exerted antidepressant-related behavioral and cellular responses in mice, the ED of (2,6)-HNK to prevent NMDA-induced lethality was found to be 228 mg/kg, compared with 6.4 mg/kg for ketamine. The 10 mg/kg (2,6)-HNK dose generated maximal hippocampal extracellular concentrations of ∼8 µM, which were well below concentrations required to inhibit synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDARs in vitro. (2,6)-HNK was more potent than (2,6)-HNK, but less potent than ketamine at inhibiting NMDARs. These data demonstrate the stereoselectivity of NMDAR inhibition by (2,6;2,6)-HNK and support the conclusion that direct NMDAR inhibition does not contribute to antidepressant-relevant effects of (2,6)-HNK.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30468546>C3 and C6 Modification-Specific OYE Biotransformations of Synthetic Carvones and Sequential BVMO Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Chiral Caprolactones.</a></h2><p>The scope for biocatalytic modification of non-native carvone derivatives for speciality intermediates has hitherto been limited. Additionally, caprolactones are important feedstocks with diverse applications in the polymer industry and new non-native terpenone-derived biocatalytic caprolactone syntheses are thus of potential value for industrial biocatalytic materials applications. Biocatalytic reduction of synthetic analogues of R-(-)-carvone with additional substituents at C3 or C6, or both C3 and C6, using three types of OYEs (OYE2, PETNR and OYE3) shows significant impact of both regio-substitution and the substrate diastereomer. Bioreduction of (-)-carvone derivatives substituted with a Me and/or OH group at C6 is highly dependent on the diastereomer of the substrate. Derivatives bearing C6 substituents larger than methyl moieties are not substrates. Computer docking studies of PETNR with both ()-Me and (6R)-Me substituted (-)-carvone provides a model consistent with the outcomes of bioconversion. The products of bioreduction were efficiently biotransformed by the Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase (BVase) CHMO_Phi1 to afford novel trisubstituted lactones with complete regioselectivity to provide a new biocatalytic entry to these chiral caprolactones. This provides both new non-native polymerization feedstock chemicals, but also with enhanced efficiency and selectivity over native (+)-dihydrocarvone Baeyer-Villigerase expansion. Optimum enzymatic reactions were scaled up to 60-100 mg, demonstrating the utility for preparative biocatalytic synthesis of both new synthetic scaffold-modified dihydrocarvones and efficient biocatalytic entry to new chiral caprolactones, which are potential single-isomer chiral polymer feedstocks.© 2019 The Authors.

The aims of this study were: (1) to validate the ability of a novel point of care (POC) assay, thrombelastography (TEG) , to detect changes in adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced whole blood clotting in volunteers and patients given clopidogrel using TEG 5000 as a reference and (2) to compare a novel, rapid parameter, area under the curve at 15 minutes (AUC15), with the traditional maximum clot amplitude (MA) in TEG .A total of 25 participants were included in whom ADP-induced clotting was measured at 4 time points: (1) 12 healthy volunteers given 600 mg of clopidogrel; (2) 12 patients with ACS given 600 mg of clopidogrel; (3) 1 healthy volunteer given 600 mg of clopidogrel on 5 separate occasions. All samples were tested using conventional TEG 5000 and the new POC TEG , and a new parameter called AUC15 was compared with MA in TEG .(1) TEG 5000 and TEG  both detected changes in ADP-induced platelet activation. Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated a good level of agreement between them. (2) For TEG , correlation between MA and the novel AUC15 was strong for both thrombin and ADP channels (R  = 0.867, R = .936, P < .001), and the AUC15 result was available on average 13.3 minutes earlier.Thrombelastography  is a rapid, easy to use and accurate test of ADP-induced clotting using TEG 5000 as a reference.

Essentially, GE primarily includes active ginger phenolics viz., 6-gingerol (6G), 8-gingerol (8G), 10-gingerol (10G), and 6-shogaol (). However, the druglikeness properties of active GE phenolics like solubility, stability, and  characteristics are poorly understood. Herein, we determined the physicochemical and biochemical properties of GE phenolics by conducting  assays and mouse pharmacokinetic studies with and without co-administration of ketoconazole (KTZ). GE phenolics showed low to moderate solubility in various pH buffers but were stable in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids, indicating their suitability for oral administration. All GE phenolics were metabolically unstable and showed high intrinsic clearance in mouse, rat, dog, and human liver microsomes. Upon oral administration of 250 mg/kg GE, sub-therapeutic concentrations of GE phenolics were observed. Treatment of plasma samples with β-glucuronidase (βgd) increased the exposure of all GE phenolics by 10 to 700-fold. Co-administration of KTZ with GE increased the exposure of free GE phenolics by 3 to 60-fold. Interestingly, when the same samples were treated with βgd, the exposure of GE phenolics increased by 11 to 60-fold, suggesting inhibition of phase I  by KTZ but little effect on glucuronide conjugation. Correlating the in vitro and in vivo results, it is reasonable to conclude that phase II  seems to be the predominant clearance pathway for GE phenolics. We present evidence that the first-pass , particularly glucuronide conjugation of GE phenolics, underlies low systemic exposure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28867713>Stereo-Selective Preparation of Teneraic Acid, trans-(2S,)-Piperidine-2,6-dicarboxylic Acid, via Anodic Oxidation and Cobalt-Catalyzed Carbonylation.</a></h2><p>Teneraic acid (piperidine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid) is a naturally occurring imino acid that comprises three stereoisomers due to its two asymmetric centers at C2 and C6. The configuration of natural teneraic acid is reported to correspond to trans-(2S,). However, a few studies are focused on the stereospecific synthesis of trans-(2S,)-teneraic acid. The present study investigates a convenient synthetic method that includes regiospecific anodic oxidation and stereospecific cobalt-catalyzed carbonylation to obtain trans-(2S,)-teneraic acid. Methyl (S)-N-benzoyl-α-methoxypipecolate, the key intermediate that displays a structure that corresponds to an intermediate (N-α-hydroxyalkyl amide) of intramolecular amidocarbonylation, was obtained via an anodic oxidation of methyl (S)-N-benzoylpipecolate. Subsequently, cobalt-catalyzed carbonylation converted the methyl (S)-N-benzoyl-α-methoxypipecolate to trans-(2S,)-N-benzoyl-teneraic acid dimethyl ester in good optical purity (>95% enantiomeric excess (ee)) and modest yield (63%). Finally, de-protection occurred via acidic hydrolysis to obtain trans-(2S,)-teneraic acid. The stereochemistry of synthesized teneraic acid was confirmed as corresponding to trans-(2S,) by comparing its physical properties with those of a cis-meso-isomer and those of a trans-(2S,)-isomer that were reported in previous studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30087006>Cardiovascular responses to ENERGY drinks in a healthy population during eXercise: The C-Energy-X Study.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28988932> RNA Mimics B-Form DNA to Regulate Escherichia coli RNA Polymerase.</a></h2><p>Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) regulate gene expression in all organisms. Bacterial  RNAs globally regulate transcription by binding RNA polymerase (RNAP) holoenzyme and competing with promoter DNA. Escherichia coli (Eco)  RNA interacts specifically with the housekeeping σ-holoenzyme (Eσ) and plays a key role in the transcriptional reprogramming upon shifts between exponential and stationary phase.

We report here the 3.8 Å resolution structure of a complex between  RNA and Eσ determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy and validation of the structure using footprinting and crosslinking approaches. Duplex RNA segments have A-form C3' endo sugar puckers but widened major groove widths, giving the RNA an overall architecture that mimics B-form promoter DNA.

The objective of this study was to define the role of p53 in regulating ischemia-induced angiogenesis and arteriogenesis and to identify mechanisms by which this regulation occurs in vivo.Surgically induced hindlimb ischemia or mesenteric artery ligation was performed in wild-type (p53) and p53 knockout (p53) mice. Limb perfusion and revascularization were assessed by laser Doppler perfusion imaging, capillary density, and collateral artery development. Mesenteric collateral artery flow and development were determined by arterial flow measurement and by histologic analysis, respectively. An in vitro aortic ring assay was performed on p53 and p53 aortic tissue to evaluate endothelial function. The p53 inhibitor and activator pifithrin-α and quinacrine, respectively, were used to modulate p53 activity in vivo after ischemia.Absence of p53 in mice resulted in increased limb perfusion (P < .05), capillary density (P < .05), and collateral artery development (P < .05) after induction of hindlimb ischemia. In the nonischemic mesenteric artery ligation model of arteriogenesis, p53 expression was induced in collateral arteries and increased arterial blood flow in mice lacking p53 (P < .05). Lack of p53 decreased apoptosis in ischemic hindlimb tissue (P < .05) and increased proangiogenic factors hypoxia-inducible factor 1α and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Endothelial cell outgrowth in vitro increased in the absence of p53 (P < .05). Pharmacologic augmentation of p53 expression after ischemia impaired perfusion and collateral artery formation and decreased VEGF levels (P < .05). Conversely, inhibition of p53 with pifithrin-α augmented limb perfusion (P < .05) and collateral artery formation (P < .05) and increased protein levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α and VEGF. Pharmacologic augmentation and inhibition of p53 had no significant effect in mice lacking p53.p53 negatively regulates ischemia-induced angiogenesis and arteriogenesis. Inhibition of p53 increases ischemia-induced arteriogenesis and limb perfusion and thus represents a potential therapeutic strategy for arterial occlusive disease.Copyright © 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery.

Among these, chondroitin sulfate (CS) and dermatan sulfate, side chains of PGs, are widely distributed in animal kingdom and show structural variations, such as sulfation patterns and degree of epimerization, which are responsible for their physiological functions through interactions with growth factors, chemokines and adhesion molecules. However, structural changes in CS, particularly the ratio of 4--sulfation to 6--sulfation (4S/) and CS chain length that occur during the aging process, are not fully understood. We found that 4S/ ratio and molecular weight of CS were decreased in polyamine-depleted cells. In addition, decreased levels of chondroitin synthase 1 (CHSY1) and chondroitin 4--sulfotransferase 2 proteins were also observed on polyamine depletion. Interestingly, the translation initiation of CHSY1 was suppressed by a highly structured sequence (positions -202 to -117 relative to the initiation codon) containing RNA G-quadruplex (G4) structures in 5'-untranslated region. The formation of the G4s was influenced by the neighboring sequences to the G4s and polyamine stimulation of CHSY1 synthesis disappeared when the formation of the G4s was inhibited by site-directed mutagenesis. These results suggest that the destabilization of G4 structures by polyamines stimulates CHSY1 synthesis and, at least in part, contribute to the maturation of CS chains.© 2018 The Author(s).

One possible comedication is the sedative α-agonist medetomidine. Advantages of that combination are the compensation of side effects of the two drugs and the anesthetic-sparing effect of medetomidine. In vitro studies showed that medetomidine has an inhibitive effect on the formation of norketamine. Norketamine is the first metabolite of ketamine and is also active. It is followed by others like 6-hydroxynorketamine and 5,6-dehydronorketamine (DHNK). In an in vivo pharmacokinetic study Beagle dogs under sevoflurane anesthesia (mean end-tidal concentration 3.0±0.2%) or following medetomidine sedation (450μg/m) received 4mg/kg racemic ketamine or 2mg/kg S-ketamine. Blood samples were collected between 0 and 900min after drug injection. 50μL aliquots of plasma were pretreated by liquid-liquid extraction prior to analysis of the reconstituted extracts with a robust enantioselective capillary electrophoresis assay using highly sulfated γ-cyclodextrin as chiral selector and electrokinetic sample injection of the analytes from the extract across a short buffer plug without chiral selector. Levels of S- and R-ketamine, S- and R-norketamine, (2S,)- and (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine and S- and R-DHNK were determined. Data were analyzed with compartmental pharmacokinetic models which included two compartments for the ketamine and norketamine enantiomers and a single compartment for the DHNK and 6-hydroxynorketamine stereoisomers. Medetomidine showed an effect on the formation and elimination of all metabolites. Stereoselectivities were detected for 6-hydroxynorketamine and DHNK, but not for ketamine and norketamine.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We hypothesized that ASC-based therapies would accelerate wound healing.Diabetes was induced in four Yorkshire swine through intravenous injection of streptozotocin. ASCs were harvested from flank fat and cultured in either M199 or EGM-2 medium. A duplicate series of seven full-thickness dorsal wounds were surgically created on each swine. The wounds in the cellular treatment group underwent injection of low-dose or high-dose ASCs or EC/ASCs on day 0, with a repeat injection of one half of the initial dose on day 15. Wounds assigned to the topical CM therapy were covered with 2 mL of either serum-free M199 primed by ASCs or human umbilical vein endothelial cells every 3 days. Wounds were assessed at day 0, 10, 15, 20, and 28. The swine were sacrificed on day 28. ImageJ software was used to evaluate the percentage of wound healing. The wounded skin underwent histologic, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay examinations to evaluate markers of angiogenesis and inflammation.We found an increase in the percentage of wound closure rates in cell-based treatments and topical therapies at various points compared with the untreated control wounds (P < .05). The results from the histologic, messenger RNA, and protein analyses suggested the treated wounds displayed increased angiogenesis and a diminished inflammatory response.Cellular therapy with ASCs, EC/ASCs, and topical CM accelerated diabetic wound healing in the swine model. Enhanced angiogenesis and immunomodulation might be key contributors to this process.Copyright © 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Many people with diabetes have peripheral arterial disease (PAD), which increases their already high risk of major amputation. Cellular therapies are a promising regenerative medicine approach to PAD that can be used to focally inject regenerative cells to endangered tissue beds. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to promote tissue regeneration through stromal support and paracrine stimulation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis). Whereas little is known about human diabetic MSCs (dMSCs), particularly those from patients with PAD, dMSCs have a limited expansion capacity but can be improved with human platelet lysate (PL) supplementation. PL is rich in many growth factors, including epidermal growth factor (EGF), which is known to be important to cell proliferation and survival signaling . We hypothesize that dMSCs have a reversible defect in EGF receptor . The objective of this work was to test this hypothesis using dMSCs from PAD patients.The secretome expression of EGF and prominent angiogens was characterized from bone marrow (BM)-derived and adipose tissue-derived (ATD) dMSCs from five patients (six limbs) undergoing major amputation. Western blot was used to characterize the AKT and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 expression in dMSCs under standard culture (5% fetal bovine serum plus fibroblast growth factor 2 [FGF2]), 5% human PL, or 5% fetal bovine serum plus EGF. Healthy donor MSCs were control cells. The angiogenic activity of BM- and ATD-dMSCs was tested on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECs). Paired t-test, analysis of variance, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used as appropriate.Both BM- and ATD-dMSCs had typical MSC surface marker expression and similar expansion profiles, and they did not express EGF in their secretome. PL supplementation of dMSCs improved AKT signaling, but they were resistant to FGF2 activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2. EGF supplementation led to similar AKT expression as with PL, but PL had greater phosphorylation of AKT at 30 and 60 minutes. The conditioned media from both BM- and ATD-dMSCs had robust levels of prominent angiogens (vascular endothelial growth factor, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, hepatocyte growth factor), which stimulated EC proliferation and migration, and the co-culture of dMSCs with ECs led to significantly longer EC sprouts in three-dimensional gel than EC-alone pellets.PL and EGF supplementation improves AKT expression in dMSCs over that of FGF2, but PL improved pAKT over that of EGF. Thus, PL supplementation strategies may improve AKT signaling, which could be important to MSC survival in cellular therapies. Furthermore, BM- and ATD-dMSCs have similar secretomes and robust in vitro angiogenic activity, which supports pursuing dMSCs from both reservoirs in regenerative medicine strategies.Copyright © 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery.

RNA sequencing of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs), the preferred targets during human rickettsioses, infected with R. prowazekii revealed the presence of 35 trans-acting and 23 cis-acting sRNAs, respectively. Of these, expression of two trans-acting (Rp_sR17 and Rp_sR60) and one cis-acting (Rp_sR47) novel sRNAs and four well-characterized bacterial sRNAs (RNaseP_bact_a, α-tmRNA, 4.5S RNA,  RNA) was further confirmed by Northern blot or RT-PCR analyses. The transcriptional start sites of five novel rickettsial sRNAs and  RNA were next determined using 5' RLM-RACE yielding evidence for their independent biogenesis in R. prowazekii. Finally, computational approaches were employed to determine the secondary structures and potential mRNA targets of novel sRNAs.

The expression of HS S-domains at the cell surface is determined by two mechanisms: tightly regulated biosynthetic machinery and enzymatic remodeling by extracellular endoglucosamine 6-sulfatases, Sulf-1 and Sulf-2. Intracellular or extracellular deposits of misfolded and aggregated proteins are characteristic of protein aggregation diseases. Although proteins can aggregate alone, deposits of protein aggregates in vivo contain a number of proteinaceous and non-protein components. HS S-domains are one non-protein component of these aggregated deposits. HS S-domains are considered to be critical for signal transduction of several growth factors and several disease conditions, such as tumor progression, but their roles in protein aggregation diseases are not yet fully understood.

During chronic renal failure, EPO deficiency is the main cause of anemia, but other factors such as iron deficiency and inflammatory syndrome are also involved. More recently, it is hypothesized that other factors such an excess of GDF-11 production may be also involved. Thus, beside Epo treatment HIF and GDF-11 are potentially new therapeutic targets in anemia of chronic kidney disease.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

All these compounds were characterized by IR, H NMR, C NMR and mass spectral data. The interaction of newly synthesized bis-pyrazoles with DNA was investigated through molecular docking and absorption spectroscopic technique. Among all bis-pyrazoles compounds, the 6h compound showed lower conformational energy through in silico analysis. The interaction of each molecule in this series 6a-t with the various concentrations of DNA was examined through the UV-visible spectroscopic studies. The UV-visible spectroscopy studies on the specific binding of compound 6a, 6b, 6g, 6h, 6d, 6i, 6k, 6n,  with DNA have exhibited spectral shifts and the results were discussed. In further the compounds 6a-t were subjected to the in-vitro cytotoxicity studies against human pancreatic adenocarcinoma, human non-small cell lung carcinoma cell lines. Among the screened compounds, N-(3-isopropoxy-1-isopropyl-4-(3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)cyclobutane carboxamide and N-(5'-Isopropoxy-2'-isopropyl-3,5-dimethyl-2'H-[1,4'] bipyrazolyl-3'-yl)-dimethane sulfonamide were found as lead molecules since they have exhibited promising activity against both the cancer cell lines used in this study, whereas the compounds 4-(trifluoromethyl)-N-(3-isopropoxy-1-isopropyl-4-(3,5-dimethyl-2H-pyrrol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)benzamide and 2,6-difluoro-N-(3-isopropoxy-1-isopropyl-4-(3,5-dimethyl-2H-pyrrol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-5-yl) benzamide were found to be active against the pancreatic cell line only.

[6 S]-5-methyltetrahydrofolate ([6 S]-5-MTHF) is an alternative to FA due to possible advantages, that is, no masking cobalamin deficiency. The study aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of [6 S]-5-MTHF in relations to FA supplementation in reducing the serum Hcy. Healthy volunteers, aged 50-65, had normal serum folate and did not use supplements with B-vitamins for 6 months. Forty subjects were divided into two groups: receiving 400 μg/d FA or the equimolar amount of [6 S]-5-MTHF. Blood was collected at baseline and after 4 weeks. In both groups, a significant decrease in the mean Hcy level after intervention period was observed. Supplementation with [6 S]-5-MTHF was slightly less effective, but not significantly, in Hcy lowering than FA (p = .243 between the groups), that is, by 7.8% and 13.4%, respectively.

We developed a new PET probe, sodium (3, 5)-3, 5-dihydroxy-7-((1 2, 6, 8)-6-hydroxy-2-methyl-8- ((1-[C]-()-2-methyl-but-2-enoyl) oxy) -1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 8-hexahydronaphthalen-1-yl) heptanoate ([C]DPV), and demonstrated its usefulness for the quantitative investigation of Oatps (gene symbol ) and Mrp2 (gene symbol ) in rats. To further analyze the species differences and verify the pharmacokinetic parameters in humans, serial PET scanning of the abdominal region with [C]DPV was performed in six healthy volunteers with and without an OATP1Bs and MRP2 inhibitor, rifampicin (600 mg, oral), in a crossover fashion. After intravenous injection, [C]DPV rapidly distributed to the liver and kidney followed by secretion into the bile and urine. Rifampicin significantly reduced the liver distribution of [C]DPV 3-fold, resulting in a 7.5-fold reduced amount of excretion into the bile and the delayed elimination of [C]DPV from the blood circulation. The hepatic uptake clearance (CL) and canalicular efflux clearance (CL) of [C]DPV (544 ± 204 and 10.2 ± 3.5 l/min per gram liver, respectively) in humans were lower than the previously reported corresponding parameters in rats (1800 and 298 l/min per gram liver, respectively) (Shingaki et al., 2013). Furthermore, rifampicin treatment significantly reduced CL and CL by 58% and 44%, respectively. These results suggest that PET imaging with [C]DPV is an effective tool for quantitatively characterizing the OATP1Bs and MRP2 functions in the human hepatobiliary transport system.Copyright © 2018 by The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30143876>Chimeric GII.3/GII.6 norovirus capsid (VP1) proteins: characterization by electron microscopy, trypsin sensitivity and binding to histo-blood group antigens.</a></h2><p>GII.3 and GII.6 noroviruses (NoVs) are similar in several aspects, including the presence of a short sequence insertion in the P2 domain of the major capsid protein (VP1) and trypsin susceptibility of VP1-containing virus-like particles (VLPs). In this study, we generated two constructs with the S or P domains of VP1 from GII.3 and GII.6 NoV strains exchanged (GII.3S/GII.6P and GII./GII.3P), and the resultant chimeric capsid proteins were expressed from recombinant baculoviruses. The assembly of VLPs was confirmed by electron microscopy, and the susceptibility of assembled VLPs to trypsin digestion was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Salivary histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) binding and binding blockade assays were performed to determine the binding characteristics of chimeric VP1-containing VLPs with and without trypsin digestion. Our results indicated that both expressed GII.3S/GII.6P and GII./GII.3P chimeric proteins successfully assembled into VLPs. Trypsin digestion of VLPs assembled from both chimeric proteins led to the generation of two fragments with molecular sizes similar to those of wild-type VP1-containing VLPs. An in vitro salivary HBGA binding assay demonstrated that VLPs assembled from both chimeric proteins exhibited enhanced binding after trypsin cleavage. An HBGA binding blockade assay indicated that the binding of GII.3S/GII.6P and GII./GII.3P VLPs against salivary HBGAs could only be blocked by GII.3 and GII.6 NoV VLP-specific hyperimmune sera, respectively. For GII.6 and GII.3S/GII.6P VLPs, a difference in binding enhancement after trypsin cleavage was observed. Our results demonstrate that the S domains of GII.3 and GII.6 NoV VP1 are interchangeable and that the S domain affects the binding of the P domain to HBGAs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625604>Novel electrochemical sensing platform based on a nanocomposite of PVA/PVP/RGO applied to IgG anti- Toxoplasma gondii antibodies quantitation.</a></h2><p>This article describes the development of a new electrochemical platform composed by a polymer mixture and graphene oxide (GO). The working electrode of a screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) was modified with nanocomposite constituted by poly-vinyl alcohol (PVA), poly-vinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and GO, which was electrochemically reduced to obtain PVA/PVP/RGO/SPCE. The interactions and morphology of the PVA/PVP/GO nanocomposite were investigated by SEM, FTIR and UV-Vis. SEM images indicated an excellent dispersion of the GO sheets in the polymer matrix. Besides, FTIR and visible UV studies revealed strong interactions between polymer mixture and GO sheets. According to electrochemical studies, the new platform increased the electroactive surface area by a factor of 20.46 compared to the unmodified SPCE. Also, the PVA/PVP/RGO/SPCE had a fast electron kinetics transfer process with a value of k = 9.6 s. The modified electrode was applied to the determination of IgG anti-T. gondii antibodies for the serological diagnosis of toxoplasmosis. The IgG anti-T. gondii antibodies quantification showed a detection limit of 0.012 U mL, and the coefficients of variation intra-day and inter-day assays were lower than 4.5% and 6.2%, respectively. The electrochemical platform proved to be a sensitive and easily applicable tool applied to the serological diagnosis of toxoplasmosis. Therefore, the developed nanocomposite represents an excellent alternative for the electrochemical biosensor fabrication.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Conventional OxFlow (Conv-OxFlow) entails four interleaves incorporated in a single pulse sequence - two for phase-contrast based measurement of tCBF in the supplying arteries of the neck, and two to measure the intra- to extravascular phase difference in the superior sagittal sinus to derive Y [Jain et al., JCBFM 2010]. However, this approach limits achievable temporal resolution thus precluding capture of rapid changes of brain  states such as the response to apneic stimuli. Here, we developed a time-efficient, multiplexed OxFlow method and evaluated its potential for measuring dynamic alterations in global CMRO during a breath-hold challenge. Two different implementations of multiplexed OxFlow were investigated: 1) simultaneous-echo-refocusing based OxFlow (SER-OxFlow) and 2) simultaneous-multi-slice imaging-based dual-band OxFlow (DB-OxFlow). The two sequences were implemented on 3T scanners (Siemens TIM Trio and Prisma) and their performance was evaluated in comparison to Conv-OxFlow in ten healthy subjects for baseline CMRO quantification. Comparison of measured parameters (Y, tCBF, CMRO) revealed no significant bias of SER-OxFlow and DB-OxFlow, with respect to the reference Conv-OxFlow while improving temporal resolution two-fold (12.5 versus 25s). Further acceleration shortened scan time to 8 and  for SER and DB-OxFlow, respectively, for time-resolved CMRO measurement. The two sequences were able of capturing smooth transitions of Y, tCBF, and CMRO over the time course consisting of 30s of normal breathing, 30s of volitional apnea, and 90s of recovery. While both SER- and DB-OxFlow techniques provide significantly improved temporal resolution (by a factor of 3 - 4 relative to Conv-OxFlow), DB-OxFlow was found to be superior for the study of short physiologic stimuli.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Both EPCs and MSCs are critical to the wound repair process, which is hindered in diabetes mellitus. Diabetes has been shown to decrease the function of these progenitor cells, whereas estrogen has beneficial wound healing effects. However, the role of estrogen in modulating EPC and MSC biology in diabetes is unknown. We investigated the effect of estrogen on improving bone marrow (BM)-derived EPC and MSC function using a murine diabetic wound healing model.Female diabetic db/db and nondiabetic control mice were wounded cutaneously and treated with topical estrogen or placebo cream. On day 5 after wounding, BM cells were harvested to quantify EPC number and colony-forming units of EPCs and MSCs. Wound healing rate was concurrently studied. Vessel density and scar density were then quantified using whole body perfusion and laser confocal microscopy. EPC recruitment was documented by immunohistochemistry to identify CD34- and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2-positive cells in the vessel wall. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance.Topical estrogen significantly increased colony-forming units of both EPCs and MSCs compared with placebo treatment, indicating improved viability and proliferative ability of these cells. Consistently, increased recruitment of EPCs to diabetic wounds and higher vessel density were observed in estrogen-treated compared with placebo-treated mice. Consequently, topical estrogen significantly accelerated wound healing as early as day 6 after wounding. In addition, scar density resulting from collagen deposition was increased in the estrogen-treated group, reflecting increased MSC activity and differentiation.Estrogen treatment increases wound healing and wound neovascularization in diabetic mice. Our data implicate that these beneficial effects may be mediated through improving the function of BM-derived EPCs and MSCs.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

GSK2292767A has a similar in vitro cellular profile to nemiralisib and reduces eosinophilia in a murine PD model by 63% ( = 5,  < 0.05). To explore whether a low-soluble compound results in effective PI3K inhibition in humans, a first time in human study was conducted with GSK2292767A in healthy volunteers who smoke. GSK2292767A was generally well tolerated, with headache being the most common reported adverse event. PD changes in induced sputum were measured in combination with drug concentrations in plasma from single (0.05-2 mg,  = 37), and 14-day repeat (2 mg,  = 12) doses of GSK2292767A. Trough bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for PK was taken after 14 days of repeat dosing. GSK2292767A displayed a linear increase in plasma exposure with dose, with marginal accumulation after 14 days. Induced sputum showed a 27% (90% confidence interval 15%, 37%) reduction in phosphatidylinositol-trisphosphate (the product of phosphoinositide 3-kinase activation) 3 hours after a single dose. Reduction was not maintained 24 hours after single or repeat dosing. BAL analysis confirmed the presence of GSK2292767A in lung at 24 hours, consistent with the preclinical lung retention profile. Despite good lung retention, target engagement was only present at 3 hours.

The inflammatory response is involved in the occurrence and development of TAD, possibly potentiated by platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs). This study aimed to determine whether expression of PDGF-B (a subunit of PDGF-BB) was increased in TAD patients and to explore the factors responsible for its upregulation and subsequent effects on TAD.Full-thickness ascending aorta wall specimens from TAD patients (n = 15) and control patients (n = 10) were examined for expression of PDGF-B and its receptor (PDGFRB) and in terms of morphology, inflammation, and fibrosis. Blood samples from TAD and control patients were collected to detect plasma levels of PDGF-BB and soluble elastins.Expression levels of PDGF-B, PDGFRB, and collagen I were significantly enhanced in ascending aorta wall specimens from TAD patients compared with controls. Furthermore, soluble elastic fragments and PDGF-BB were significantly increased in plasma from TAD patients compared with controls, and numerous irregular elastic fibers and macrophages were seen in the ascending aorta wall in TAD patients.An increase in elastic fragments in the aorta wall might be responsible for inducing the activation and migration of macrophages to injured sites, leading to elevated expression of PDGF-B, which in turn induces deposition of collagen, disrupts extracellular matrix homeostasis, and increases the stiffness of the aorta wall, resulting in compromised aorta compliance.Copyright © 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery.

While its role is well-characterized in some heterotrophic bacteria, we subjected a cyanobacterial homolog to functional analysis, thereby extending the scope of  RNA action to the special challenges of photoautotrophic lifestyles.Physiological characterization of a  RNA deletion strain (ΔssaA) demonstrates a delay in the recovery from nitrogen starvation. Significantly decelerated phycobilisome reassembly and glycogen degradation are accompanied with reduced photosynthetic activity compared to the wild type. Transcriptome profiling further revealed that predominantly genes encoding photosystem components, ATP synthase, phycobilisomes and ribosomal proteins were negatively affected in ΔssaA. In vivo pull-down studies of the RNA polymerase complex indicated that the presence of  RNA promotes the recruitment of the cyanobacterial housekeeping σ factor SigA, concurrently supporting dissociation of group 2 σ factors during recovery from nitrogen starvation.The combination of genetic, physiological and biochemical studies reveals the homologue of  RNA as an integral part of the cellular response of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 to changing nitrogen availability. According to these results,  RNA supports a rapid acclimation to changing nitrogen supply by accelerating the switch from group 2 σ factors SigB, SigC and SigE to SigA-dependent transcription. We therefore introduce the cyanobacterial  RNA as a novel candidate regulator of RNA polymerase sigma factor recruitment in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.

Then, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) was linked with -PCL by oxalyl chloride to obtain -PCL-PEG. Hydrogen-1 nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and gel-permeation chromatography were conducted to identify the structure of -PCL-PEG.

Polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by a water-in-oil-in-water double emulsion (W/O/W) solvent evaporation method. The size distribution and zeta potential of NPs were determined by dynamic light scattering. Transmission electron microscopy was used to observe the morphology of NPs. Drug-loading capacity, encapsulation efficiency, and the release behavior of ovalbumin (OVA)-loading NPs were tested by the bicinchoninic acid assay kit. The stability and activity of OVA released from NPs were detected and the uptake of NPs was evaluated by NIH-3T3 cells.All results indicated the successful synthesis of amphiphilic copolymer -PCL-PEG, which possessed excellent biocompatibility and could formulate NPs easily.

Ketamine is a chiral compound and S-ketamine is known to be the more potent enantiomer. Here, we present the development and validation of three LC-MS/MS assays; the first for the quantification of racemic KET, n-KET and DHNK in human serum, urine and feces; the second for the separation and quantification of the S- and R-enantiomers of KET, n-KET and DHNK, and the third for separation and quantification of 2S,-hydroxynorketamine (2S,-HNK) and 2R,6R-hydroxynorketamine (2R,6R-HNK) in serum and urine with the ability to separate and detect 10 additional hydroxylated norketamine metabolites of racemic ketamine. Sample preparation was done by liquid-liquid extraction using methyl tert-butyl ether. For achiral determination of KET and its metabolites, an isocratic elution with ammonium acetate (pH 3.8; 5mM) and acetonitrile on a C18 column was performed. For the separation of S- and R-enantiomers of KET, n-KET and DHNK, a gradient elution was applied using a mobile phase of ammonium acetate (pH 7.5; 10mM) and isopropanol on the CHIRAL-AGP column. The enantioselective separation of the HNK metabolites was done on the chiral column Lux-Amylose-2 with a gradient method using ammonium acetate (pH 9; 5mM) and a mixture of isopropanol and acetonitrile (4:1). The mass spectrometric detection monitored for each analyte 2-3 mass/charge transitions. D4-ketamine and D4-n-KET were used as internal standards. The assays were successfully validated according to current bioanalytical guidelines and applied to a pilot study in one healthy volunteer. Compared to previously published methods, our assays have superior analytical features such as a lower amount of required matrix, faster sample preparation, shorter analytical run time and higher sensitivity (LLOQ up to 0.1ng/ml). Moreover, our assay enables for the first time the enantioselective determination of 2R,6R- and 2S,-HNK which were shown to be responsible for the promising antidepressant effects of ketamine.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The most important factors in the development of cardiovascular diseases are dyslipidemia and impaired renal function. The aim of the study was to investigate the lipid spectrum and renal function in liver recipients in real clinical practice and the correspondence of their correction to current clinical recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of dyslipidemia and chronic kidney disease (CKD).A retrospective analysis of lipid spectrum and renal function in patients who underwent OLT in Research Institute - Regional Clinical Hospital №1, Krasnodar was performed. The level of creatinine, GFR and lipid spectrum was studied before and 36 months after liver transplantation. The GFR was calculated using the formula CKD‑EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration). Statistical analysis of the study results was made using the program Statistica 10.Liver recipients have a significantly higher total cholesterol by 31.0% (p&lt;0.01) in comparison with the baseline before surgery. Total cholesterol was increased in 13.7% (p&lt;0.01), triglycerides in 12.3% (p&lt;0.01) before transplantation. Tree years after transplantation, the increasion in cholesterol was registered in 42.6% (p&lt;0.01) and triglycerides in 37.9% (p &lt;0.01), respectively. 3 years after transplantation reduction of GFR was observed in comparison with the baseline by 22.6% (p=0.00006). Verification of chronic kidney disease and statin administration in patients were carried out in some cases. The levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides had a reliable inverse correlation with GFR (r = ‑0.42; p&lt;0.01 and r = ‑0.36; p&lt;0.05).In the long‑term postoperative period there was an impaired lipid  and decreased level of GFR. Dyslipidemia was closely related to the progression of renal dysfunction in liver recipients, an inverse correlation was established between the glomerular filtration rate and the increasion in cholesterol and triglyceride levels. It is necessary to increase the attention of physicians with regard to timely correction of lipid  disorders and detection of initial manifestations of renal dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28293867>Binding specificity of R-10G and TRA-1-60/81, and substrate specificity of keratanase II studied with chemically synthesized oligosaccharides.</a></h2><p>Recently, we established a mouse monoclonal antibody specific to hiPS/ hES cells, R-10G, which recognizes a type of keratan sulfate. Keratan sulfates (KS) comprise a family of glycosaminoglycans consisting of the repeating unit of [Gal-GlcNAc()]. However, there is a diversity in the degree of sulfation at Gal and GlcNAc residues, and also in the mode of linkage, Galβ1 - 3GlcNAc (type 1) or Galβ1 - 4GlcNAc (type 2). To gain more insight into the binding specificity of R-10G, we carried out an ELISA test on avidin-coated plates using polyethylene glycol (PEG)-biotinylated derivatives of a series of N-acetyllactosamine tetrasaccharides (keratan sulfates (KSs)). The results suggested that the minimum epitope structure is Galβ1 - 4GlcNAc()β1 - 3Galβ1 - 4GlcNAc()β1 (type 2- type 2 keratan sulfate). Removal of sulfate from GlcNAc() or addition of sulfate to Gal abolished the binding activity almost completely. We also examined the binding specificity of TRA-1-60/81 in the same assay system. The minimum epitope structure was shown to be Galβ1 - 3GlcNAcβ1 - 3Galβ1 - 4GlcNAcβ1 in agreement with the previous study involving glycan arrays (Natunen et al., Glycobiology, 21, 1125-1130 (2011)). Interestingly, however, TRA-1-60/81 was shown to bind to Galβ1 - 3GlcNAc()β1 - 3Galβ1 - 4GlcNAc()β1 (type 1- type 2 keratan sulfate) dose-dependently, being more than one-third the binding activity toward Galβ1 - 3GlcNAcβ1 - 3Galβ1 - 4GlcNAcβ1 than in the case of TRA-1-60. In addition, a substrate specificity study on keratanase II revealed that keratanase II degraded not only "type 2-type 2 keratan sulfate" but also "type 1-type 2 keratan sulfate", significantly.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30829211>Cardioprotective effect of 6-shogaol against hyperglycemia-induced toxicity in H9c2 cardiomyocytes via suppressing of NF-κB pathway.</a></h2><p>Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DC) is a serious complication of diabetes. Apoptosis, inflammatory and ROS production are among the factors that are involved in the progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy. 6-shogaol is reported to inhibit apoptosis and reduce inflammatory and ROS production. This study aimed to study the effect of 6-shogaol () on the progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy in vitro. To develop DC model, H9c2 cell line was exposed to high glucose (HG) level (33 M glucose) for 24 h and used as a model for diabetic cardiomyopathy. Another set of H9c2 cell lines were 1 h pretreated with different conc. of 6-shogaol (5-20 μM). Cell viability, apoptosis, ROS production, IL-6, TNF-alpha and NF-κB were estimated in these cell lines treated with HG level or pretreated with 6-shgoal before HG. Exposing cardiomyocytes H9c2 cells to HG produced dramatic changes in cell biology and chemistry. There is a significant reduction in cell viability and enhancement in cell apoptosis as compared with control. In addition, ROS production, IL-6, TNF-α levels were increased in H9c2 line treated with HG. Also, there is overexpression of NF-κB in cells treated with HG levels alone. On the other hand, pretreatment of cardiomyocytes H9c2 cells with 6-shogaol (5-20μM) significantly improved cell viability and reduced apoptosis, in addition,  at a dose of 10 μM abrogated the deleterious effects of HG on oxidative stress and inflammatory parameters via modulation of NF-κB pathway.

Most incidental AAAs are below the threshold for intervention at the time of detection; however, there is no evidence that commonly used cardiovascular drugs have clinical beneficial effects on AAA progression. Therefore, in addition to current cardiovascular risk-reducing treatments, an adjunctive medical therapy targeting the regulation of extracellular matrix  is still required in the clinical setting. Fucoidan is an extract of brown seaweed and a sulfated polysaccharide. Emerging evidence suggests that fucoidan has potential cardiovascular applications. Numerous investigations of fucoidan in diseases of the cardiovascular system have mainly focused on its pleiotropic anti-inflammatory effects. Specifically, fucoidan has been shown to have matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-reducing effects in several studies. We aimed to evaluate the beneficial effect of fucoidan on aneurysmal growth in a murine model of aortic aneurysm and further provide a rationale for using fucoidan as a medical adjunctive therapy.A murine model of angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced AAA was used to assess the therapeutic effects of fucoidan on AAA growth in vivo. The characteristics and quantification of AAAs were determined in situ. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were used for studying the involved  in vitro. Western blotting was used to detect the involved signaling  both in vivo and in vitro.Treatment with fucoidan significantly reduced the incidence of AAA formation. Administration of fucoidan significantly attenuated Ang II-induced aortic expansion from 1.56 ± 0.76 mm to 1.09 ± 0.30 mm. Administration of fucoidan significantly suppressed MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities and reduced the grade of elastin degradation in vivo. In vitro, we found that fucoidan could ameliorate the Ang II-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and nuclear factor κB p65, and it further reduced MMP and reactive oxygen species production.Fucoidan inhibits the progression of experimental AAA growth through the attenuation of proinflammatory nuclear factor κB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation. Fucoidan could be a potential medical adjunctive therapy for small AAAs.Copyright © 2017 Society for Vascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The cellular levels of R. sphaeroides  RNA peak toward the transition to stationary phase and strongly decrease during extended stationary phase. The synthesis of so-called product RNA transcripts (mainly 12-16-mers) on  RNA as template by RNA polymerase was found to be highest in late exponential phase. Product RNA ≥ 13-mers are expected to trigger the dissociation of  RNA:RNA polymerase complexes. A  RNA deletion in R. sphaeroides had no impact on growth under various  and oxidative stress conditions (with the possible exception of tert-butyl hydroperoxide stress). However, the  RNA knockout resulted in a robust growth defect under high salt stress (0.25 M NaCl).

A putative diol synthase from Penicillium oxalicum was found to convert palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7), oleic acid (18:1n-9), linoleic acid (18:2n-6), and α-linolenic acid (18:3n-3) to ,8R-dihydroxy-9(Z)-hexadecenoic acid, 6R,8R-dihydroxy-9(Z)-octadecenoic acid, 6R,8R-dihydroxy-9,12(Z,Z)-octadecadienoic acid, and ,8R-dihydroxy-9,12,15(Z,Z,Z)-octadecatrienoic acid, respectively, which were identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy analyses. The specific activity and catalytic efficiency of P. oxalicum 6,8-diol synthase were the highest for 18:2n-6, indicating that the enzyme is a 6R,8R-linoleate diol synthase (6R,8R-LDS) with new regiospecificity. This is the first report of a 6R,8R-LDS. LDS is a fusion protein consisting of a dioxygenase domain at the N-terminus and a cytochrome P450/hydroperoxide isomerase (P450/HPI) domain at the C-terminus. The putative active-site residues in the C-terminal domain of P. oxalicum 6R,8R-LDS were proposed based on a substrate-docking homology model. The results of the site-directed mutagenesis within C-terminal P450 domain suggested that Asn, Arg, and Arg, are catalytic importance and belong to the catalytic groove. Phe and Gln were found to be involved in the regiospecific rearrangement of hydroperoxide, while the F794E and Q889A variants of P. oxalicum 6,8-LDS acted as 7,8- and 8,11-LDSs, respectively.

Br.</a></h2><p>Tropane alkaloids (TAs), especially hyoscyamine and scopolamine, are important precursors for anticholinergic and antispasmodic drugs. Hyoscyamine and scopolamine are currently obtained at commercial scale from hybrid crosses of Duboisia myoporoides × Duboisia leichhardtii plants. In this study, we present a global investigation of the localization and organization of TA biosynthesis in a Duboisia myoporoides R. Br. wild-type line. The tissue-specific spatial distribution of TAs within D. myoporoides is presented, including quantification of the TAs littorine, 6-hydroxy hyoscyamine, hyoscyamine, scopolamine and, additionally, hyoscyamine aldehyde as well as scopolamine glucoside. Scopolamine (14.77 ± 5.03 mg g-1), and to a lesser extent hyoscyamine (3.01 ± 1.54 mg g-1) as well as 6-hydroxy hyoscyamine (4.35 ± 1.18 mg g-1), are accumulated in leaves during plant development, with the highest concentration of total TAs detected in 6-month-old plants. Littorine, an early precursor in TA biosynthesis, was present only in the roots (0.46 ± 0.07 mg g-1). During development, the spatial distribution of all investigated alkaloids changed due to secondary growth in the roots. Transcripts of pmt, tr-I and cyp80f1 genes, involved in early stages of TA biosynthesis, were found to be most abundant in the roots. In contrast, the transcript encoding hyoscyamine 6β-hydroxylase (h6h) was highest in the leaves of 3-month-old plants. This investigation presents the spatial distribution of biochemical components as well as gene expression profiles of genetic factors known to participate in TA biosynthesis in D. myoporoides. The results of this investigation may aid in future breeding or genetic enhancement strategies aimed at increasing the yields of TAs in these medicinally valuable plant species.© The Author 2017.

To further validate this method, this analysis was applied to mice fed with synthetic diets whose carbohydrate components consisted solely of either glucose or fructose.Eight glucose-fed and 12 fructose-fed mice were given  H O followed by ad libitum feeding overnight. Mice were then euthanized, hepatic glycogen was isolated and derivatized to monoacetone glucose, and  H-enrichment of positions 2, 5, and 6 were measured by  H NMR. From these data, the fraction of overnight glycogen appearance from the direct pathway and/or glycogen cycling and indirect pathway were estimated. Indirect pathway fractions were resolved into Krebs cycle and triose-phosphate sources-the latter including contributions from fructose metabolism.After overnight feeding, the fraction of overnight glycogen appearance derived from direct pathway and/or glycogen cycling in glucose-fed-mice was 63 ± 1%. For the indirect pathway, Krebs cycle and triose-phosphate sources contributed 22 ± 1% and 15 ± 1%, respectively. For fructose-fed-mice, glycogen appearance was dominated by triose-phosphate sources (60 ± 2%) with lesser contributions from Krebs cycle (14 ± 1%) and direct and/or glycogen cycling (26 ± 2%).

In previous studies, it has been suggested that aneurysm rupture depends on intraluminal thrombus (ILT) thickness, which varies across each individual aneurysm. We hypothesized that hemostatic components differentially accumulate in AAA tissue in relation to ILT thickness. Thick (A1) and thin (B1) segments of ILTs and aneurysm wall sections A (adjacent to A1) and B (adjacent to B1) from one aneurysm sac were taken from 35 patients undergoing elective repair.Factor levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of protein extract.Tissue factor (TF) activities were significantly higher in thinner segments of AAA (B1 vs A1, P = .003; B vs A, P < .001; B vs A1, P < .001; B vs B1, P = .001). Significantly higher tissue plasminogen activator was found in thick thrombus-covered wall segments (A) than in B, A1, and B1 (P = .015, P < .001, and P < .001, respectively). Plasminogen concentrations were highest in ILT. Concentrations of α-antiplasmin in thin ILT adjacent walls (B) were higher compared with wall (A) adjacent to thick ILT (P = .021) and thick ILT (A1; P < .001). Significant correlations between levels of different factors were mostly found in thick ILT (A1). However, no correlations were found at B sites, except for a correlation between plasmin and TF activities (r = 0.55; P = .004).These results suggest that higher TF activities are present in thinner AAA regions. These parameters and local fibrinolysis may be part of the processes leading to destruction of the aneurysm wall.Copyright © 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, the structural specificity of HS in these interactions remains largely undefined. Here, we used completely synthetic, structurally defined, alternating N-sulfated glucosamine (NS) and 2-O-sulfated iduronate (IS) residues to generate dodecasaccharides ([NSIS]6) that contained no, one or six glucosamine 6-O-sulfates (). The aim was to address how  contributes to the potential of defined HS dodecasaccharides to inhibit the angiogenic growth factors FGF2 and VEGF165, in vitro and in vivo. We show that the addition of a single  at the non-reducing end of [NSIS]6, i.e. [NSIS6S]-[NSIS]5, significantly augments the inhibition of FGF2-dependent endothelial cell proliferation, migration and sprouting in vitro when compared to the non- variant. In contrast, the fully 6-O-sulfated dodecasaccharide, [NSIS6S]6, is not a potent inhibitor of FGF2. Addition of a single  did not significantly improve inhibitory properties of [NSIS]6 when tested against VEGF165-dependent endothelial cell functions.In vivo, [NSIS6S]-[NSIS]5 blocked FGF2-dependent blood vessel formation without affecting tumor growth. Reduction of non-FGF2-dependent ovarian tumor growth occurred when [NSIS6S]-[NSIS]5 was combined with cisplatin. The degree of inhibition by [NSIS6S]-[NSIS]5 in combination with cisplatin in vivo equated with that induced by bevacizumab and sunitinib when administered with cisplatin. Evaluation of post-treatment vasculature revealed that [NSIS6S]-[NSIS]5 treatment had the greatest impact on tumor blood vessel size and lumen formation.

There is increasing evidence that the nature of these effects is determined by differences in disaccharide composition. However, the determination of GAG disaccharide composition in biological samples remains challenging and time-consuming. We have developed a method that uses derivatization and selected ion recording and RP-UPLCMS resulting in rapid separation and quantification of twelve heparin/heparin sulfate disaccharides from 5 μg GAG. Limits of detection and quantitation were 0.02-0.15 and 0.07-0.31 μg/ml respectively. We have applied this method to the novel analysis of disaccharide levels extracted from heparan sulfate and human cancer cell lines. Heparan sulfate disaccharides extracted from biological samples following actinase and heparinase incubation and derivatized using reductive amination with 2-aminoacridone. Derivatized disaccharides were analyzed used UPLC-MS with single ion monitoring. Eight HS disaccharide subunits were separated and quantified from HS and cell lines in eleven minutes per sample. In all samples the most abundant subunits present were the unsulfated ΔUA-GlcNAc, ΔUA-GlcNAc, and ΔUA,2S-GlcNS,. There was considerable variation in the proportions and concentrations of disaccharides between different cell lines.

The impact of viral DOM (vDOM) on the uninfected co-occurring phytoplankton remains largely unknown. Here, we conducted transcriptomic analyses to study the effects of vDOM on the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus, which is the most abundant photosynthetic organism on Earth. Using Prochlorococcus MIT9313, we showed that its growth was not affected by vDOM, but many tRNAs increased in abundance. We tested tRNA-gly and found that its abundance increased upon addition of glycine. The decreased transcript abundances of N  genes also suggested that Prochlorococcus responded to organic N compounds in vDOM. Addition of vDOM to Prochlorococcus reduced the maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II and CO fixation while increasing its respiration rate, consistent with differentially abundant transcripts related to photosynthesis and respiration. One of the highest positive fold-changes was observed for the  RNA, a noncoding RNA functioning as a global transcriptional regulator in bacteria. The high level of  RNA might be responsible for some of the observed transcriptional responses. Taken together, our results revealed the transcriptional regulation of Prochlorococcus in response to viral lysis products and suggested its  potential to utilize organic N compounds.© 2018 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29792895>Pharmacogenomics of drug-induced liver injury (DILI): Molecular biology to clinical applications.</a></h2><p>A 21-year old woman was admitted to hospital with a two-week history of painless jaundice, fatigue and anorexia having previously been fit and well.

Fish maws (the dried swim bladders of fish) have been used over many centuries as traditional medicines, tonics and a luxurious gourmet food in China and Southeast Asia. Little is known about the structural information of polysaccharides comprising this important functional material of fish tissue. In the present study, the total glycosaminoglycan (GAG) from fish maw was characterized. Two GAGs were identified, chondroitin sulfate (CS, having a molecular weight of 18-40 kDa) and heparan sulfate (HS), corresponding to 95% and 5% of the total GAG, respectively. Chondroitinase digestion showed that the major CS GAG was composed of ΔUA-1 → 3-GalNAc4S (59.7%), ΔUA-1 → 3-GalNAc4, (36.5%), ΔUA-1 → 3-GalNAc6S (2.2%) and ΔUA-1 → 3-GalNAc (1.6%) disaccharide units. H-NMR analysis and degradation with specific chondroitinases, both CS-type A/C and CS-type B were present in a ratio of 1.4:1. Analysis using surface plasmon resonance showed that fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 bound to the CS fraction (K = 136 nM). These results suggest that this CS may be involved in FGF-signal pathway, mediating tissue repair, regeneration and wound healing.

Through clinical cases of patients taken from the daily practice, we propose to look into three of these common complications, namely hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia and  acidosis. From the diagnostic approach to the patient care, these cases provide the opportunity to recall the fundamentals of these disorders and to present the recent literature date enlightening the knowledge related to them.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Its structure was mostly established by analysis of its 2D NMR and HR-(+)-ESI-MS spectra. A total synthesis starting from N-Boc-l-isoleucine gave (5S,)-aminotenuazonic acid in 8 % yield over nine steps (67 % de). The key steps of the total synthesis are a light-initiated Hofmann-Löffler-Freytag radical chain reaction and a Dieckmann cyclisation. The relative and absolute configurations of the natural product were determined by comparison of its NMR and CD spectra with those of the corresponding enantiopure synthetic compounds.  profiling of crude extracts of different mushrooms showed that aminotenuazonic acid is present in all four of the investigated Laccaria species. Aminotenuazonic acid shows phytotoxic activities against the root and shoot growth of Lepidium sativum, Pinus sylvestris and Arabidopsis thaliana comparable to those of tenuazonic acid.© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Life expectancy is dominated by cardiovascular risk, which is the leading cause of death in these patients. Up to one third of diabetic patients will develop diabetic nephropathy related to micro-angiopathy. Renal impairment further increases cardiovascular risk. Reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is a major public health issue, as well as early preventing and managing chronic kidney disease (CKD). Good glycemic control prevents the micro-vascular complications of the disease (retinopathy, nephropathy, etc.) and, more recently recognized through prolonged monitoring of the VADT cohort, prevents cardiovascular complications. Control of blood pressure and dyslipidemia are essential in primary or secondary cardiovascular prevention. In addition, the blockers of the renin-angiotensin system slow down the progression of the MRC. Elderly patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) form another growing group of the nephrologist daily patient pool. Especially for very elderly patients with comorbidities, the question of favoring conservative treatment rather than starting or pursuing dialysis may arise. Survival and quality of life are indeed not necessarily better in elderly patients undergoing dialysis, complications can occur eventually leading to discontinuation, and are occasionally associated with a feeling of stubbornness. Creation of prognostic score is a useful tool to help the decision-making process. However, dialogue with the patient and his/her family, as well as multidisciplinary collaboration remain fundamentals to determine the most suitable care.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The structures and absolute configurations of new compounds were elucidated using extensive spectroscopic analysis, including HRESIMS, 1D and 2D NMR experiments, the CD exciton chirality methods, and single-crystal X-ray crystallography. All isolated compounds were evaluated for cytotoxicity against five human cancer (HeLa, HepG2, K562, MDA231, and NCI-H460) cell lines and a murine melanoma B16 F10 cell line by MTT assay. Compounds 1-15 showed cytotoxic activities, especially compounds 3, 4, 8, 10, and 12. These five compounds showed broad spectrum activities against all the tested cancer cell lines with IC ranging from 9.2 to 35.5μM.

Atomic force microscopy images visualized, that in serum, ATIQCTPC formed particles of height <81 nm. These particles effectively avoided phagocytosis of macrophages and were stable in blood circulation. Distribution analysis indicated that ATIQCTPC accumulated and released ATIQC in the tumor tissue through a targeting manner. Thus, the antitumor and the anti-thrombotic activities of ATIQCTPC were 100-fold higher than those of ATIQC, and ATIQCTPC was able to prevent cancer patients from suffering from thrombosis. Based on the observation that ATIQCTPC decreased serum tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in S180 mice, we hypothesized that this is the mechanism that ATIQCTPC utilized to slow tumor growth. Additionally, we observed that ATIQCTPC inhibited thrombosis by decreasing serum P-selectin of thrombotic rats. The intermolecular association and the hexamerization manner of ATIQCTPC were experimentally evidenced and correlated with the formation of the nanoparticles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30427073>Ms1 RNA increases the amount of RNA polymerase in Mycobacterium smegmatis.</a></h2><p>Ms1 is a sRNA recently found in mycobacteria and several other actinobacterial species. Ms1 interacts with the RNA polymerase (RNAP) core devoid of sigma factors, which differs from  RNA that binds to RNAP holoenzymes containing the primary sigma factor. Here we show that Ms1 is the most abundant non-rRNA transcript in stationary phase in Mycobacterium smegmatis. The accumulation of Ms1 stems from its high-level synthesis combined with decreased degradation. We identify the Ms1 promoter, P , and cis-acting elements important for its activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PNPase (an RNase) contributes to the differential accumulation of Ms1 during growth. Then, by comparing the transcriptomes of wt and ΔMs1 strains from stationary phase, we reveal that Ms1 affects the intracellular level of RNAP. The absence of Ms1 results in decreased levels of the mRNAs encoding β and β' subunits of RNAP, which is also reflected at the protein level. Thus, the ΔMs1 strain has a smaller pool of RNAPs available when the transcriptional demand increases. This contributes to the inability of the ΔMs1 strain to rapidly react to environmental changes during outgrowth from stationary phase.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29685509>RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenic differentiation of macrophages in the abdominal aorta of angiotensin II-infused apolipoprotein E knockout mice.</a></h2><p>Osteoclastogenic activation of macrophages (OCG) occurs in human abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) and in calcium chloride-induced degenerative AAAs in mice, which have increased matrix metalloproteinase activity. As the activity of OCG in dissecting aneurysms is not clear, we tested the hypothesis that OCG contributes to angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced dissecting aneurysm (Ang II-induced AAA) in apolipoprotein E knockout mice.AAAs were produced in apolipoprotein E knockout mice via the administration of Ang II. Additionally, receptor activator of nuclear factor kB ligand (RANKL)-neutralizing antibody (5 mg/kg) was administered to one group of mice 7 days prior to Ang II infusion. Aneurysmal sections were probed for presence of RANKL and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase via immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining. Mouse aortas were also examined for RANKL and matrix metalloproteinase 9 expression via Western blot. In vitro murine vascular smooth muscle cells (MOVAS) and murine macrophages (RAW 264.7) were analyzed for the expression of osteogenic factors via Western blot, qPCR, and flow cytometry in response to Ang II or RANKL stimulation. The signaling pathway that mediates Ang II-induced RANKL expression in MOVAS cells was also investigated via application of TG101348, a Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitor, and Western blot analysis.Immunohistochemical staining of Ang II-induced AAA sections revealed OCG as evidenced by increased RANKL and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase expression compared with control mice. Immunofluorescence staining of AAA sections revealed co-localization of vascular smooth muscle cells and RANKL, revealing vascular smooth muscle cells as one potential source of RANKL. Systemic administration of RANKL-neutralizing antibody suppressed Ang II-induced AAA, with significant reduction of the maximum diameter of the abdominal aorta compared with vehicle controls (1.5 ± 0.4 mm vs 2.2 ± 0.2 mm). Ang II (1 μM) treatment induced a significant increase in RANKL messenger RNA expression levels in MOVAS cells compared with the vehicle control (1.0 ± 0.2 vs 2.8 ± 0.2). The activities of JAK2 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) were also significantly increased by Ang II treatment. Inhibition of JAK2/STAT5 suppressed Ang II-induced RANKL expression, suggesting the involvement of the JAK2/STAT5 signaling pathway.OCG with increased RANKL expression was present in Ang II-induced AAA, and neutralization of RANKL suppressed AAA formation. As neutralization of RANKL has been used clinically to treat osteoporosis and other osteoclast-related diseases, additional study of the effectiveness of RANKL neutralization in AAA is warranted.Copyright © 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery.

From Computational Fluid Dynamics it was calculated that the light exposure times ranged from 0.4 to 3.6 s while the exposure times to darkness were much longer, from 6 to 21 s. It was demonstrated that these times are too long for light integration, the cells fully adapting to local irradiances. This phenomenon was validated in the real outdoor raceway at different seasons. Simulations allows to confirm that if total light integration is achieved biomass productivity can increase up to 40 g/m·day compared to 29 g/m·day obtained considering local adaptation, which is close to the experimental value of 25 g/m·day. This paper provides clear evidence of microalgae cell adaptation to local irradiance because of the unfavourable cell movement pattern in raceway reactors.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, in humans predominately supplemented with high eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), there is no evidence of endurance performance enhancement. Therefore, this study examined if DHA-rich fish oil could improve repeated bouts of physiologically stressful cycling and a subsequent time trial in a state of fatigue. Twenty-six trained males took part in a double-blind study and were supplemented with either 2 × 1g/day soy oil, Control) or DHA-rich tuna fish oil (Nu-Mega) (FO) (560mg DHA / 140mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), for 8 weeks. Maximal cycling power (3 × ), isometric quadriceps strength (MVC), Wingate cycling protocol (6 × 30s) and a 5min cycling time-trial were assessed at baseline and eight weeks. The Omega-3 Index was not different at baseline (Control: 4.2 ± 0.2; FO: 4.7 ± 0.2%) and increased in the FO group after eight weeks (Control: 3.9 ± 0.2; FO: 6.3 ± 0.3%, p < .01). There was no effect of DHA-rich fish oil on power output of maximal  cycle sprinting (Control: Pre 1100 ± 49 Post 1067 ± 51; FO: Pre 1070 ± 46 Post 1042 ± 46W), during 5min time trail (Control: Pre 267 ± 19 Post 278 ± 20; FO: Pre 253 ± 16 Post 265 ± 16 W) or maximal voluntary contraction force (Control: Pre 273 ± 19 Post 251 ± 19; FO: Pre 287 ± 17 Post 283 ± 16 Nm). Nevertheless, relative oxygen consumption was reduced the FO group during the cycling time trial (Control: -23 ± 26; FO: -154 ± 59ml O2/min/100W p < .05) suggesting improved economy of cycling.

Due to significant heterogeneity, there are remarkable differences in how patients respond to treatment. A primary objective of psychiatric research is to identify biological markers that could be used to better predict and enhance responses to antidepressant treatments. Diet impacts various aspects of health, including depression. The fatty acid composition of the Western diet, which has a high ratio of -6:-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, is associated with increased incidence of depression. The brain is rich in lipids, and dietary fatty acids act within specific brain regions to regulate processes that impact emotional behavior. This manuscript reviews existing evidence demonstrating brain region-specific fatty acid profiles, and posits that specific fatty acids may serve as predictive biomarkers of response to antidepressants. Furthermore, increasing blood levels of certain fats, such as -3s, via dietary intervention may serve as an adjunct to improve the efficacy of antidepressants. Notably, most of the existing research regarding fats and depression-related brain regions has focused on -3s, as compared to -, monounsaturated, and saturated fats. This review article will help guide future work investigating the relationships between fatty acids, brain regions, and antidepressant efficacy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27469513>Effects of Ketamine and Ketamine Metabolites on Evoked Striatal Dopamine Release, Dopamine Receptors, and Monoamine Transporters.</a></h2><p>Following administration at subanesthetic doses, (R,S)-ketamine (ketamine) induces rapid and robust relief from symptoms of depression in treatment-refractory depressed patients. Previous studies suggest that ketamine's antidepressant properties involve enhancement of dopamine (DA) neurotransmission. Ketamine is rapidly metabolized to (2S,)- and (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK), which have antidepressant actions independent of N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptor inhibition. These antidepressant actions of (2S,;2R,6R)-HNK, or other metabolites, as well as ketamine's side effects, including abuse potential, may be related to direct effects on components of the dopaminergic (DAergic) system. Here, brain and blood distribution/clearance and pharmacodynamic analyses at DA receptors (D1-D5) and the DA, norepinephrine, and serotonin transporters were assessed for ketamine and its major metabolites (norketamine, dehydronorketamine, and HNKs). Additionally, we measured electrically evoked mesolimbic DA release and decay using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry following acute administration of subanesthetic doses of ketamine (2, 10, and 50 mg/kg, i.p.). Following ketamine injection, ketamine, norketamine, and multiple hydroxynorketamines were detected in the plasma and brain of mice. Dehydronorketamine was detectable in plasma, but concentrations were below detectable limits in the brain. Ketamine did not alter the magnitude or kinetics of evoked DA release in the nucleus accumbens in anesthetized mice. Neither ketamine's enantiomers nor its metabolites had affinity for DA receptors or the DA, noradrenaline, and serotonin transporters (up to 10 μM). These results suggest that neither the side effects nor antidepressant actions of ketamine or ketamine metabolites are associated with direct effects on mesolimbic DAergic neurotransmission. Previously observed in vivo changes in DAergic neurotransmission following ketamine administration are likely indirect.U.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28192258>Binding and functional pharmacological characteristics of gepant-type antagonists in rat brain and mesenteric arteries.</a></h2><p>The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is found in afferent sensory nerve fibers innervating the resistance arteries and plays a pivotal role in a number of neurovascular diseases such as migraine and subarachnoid bleedings. The present study investigates the binding and antagonistic characteristics of small non-peptide CGRP receptor antagonists (i.e. gepants) in isolated rat brain and mesenteric resistance arteries.The antagonistic behavior of gepants was investigated in isolated rat mesenteric arteries using a wire myograph setup while binding of gepants to CGRP receptors was investigated in rat brain membranes using a radioligand competitive binding assay. Furthermore, the histological location of the key components of CGRP receptor (RAMP1 and CLR) was assessed by immunohistochemistry.Our functional studies clearly show that all gepants are reversible competitive antagonists producing Schild plot slopes not significantly different from unity and thus suggesting presence of a uniform CGRP receptor population in the arteries. A uniform receptor population was also confirmed by radioligand competitive binding studies showing similar affinities for the gepants in rat brain and mesenteric arteries, the exception being rimegepant which had 50-fold lower affinity in brain than mesenteric arteries. CLR and RAMP1 were shown to be located in both vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells of rat mesenteric arteries by immunohistochemistry.The present results indicate that, despite species differences in the CGRP receptor affinity, the antagonistic nature of these gepants, the distribution pattern of CGRP receptor components and the mechanism behind CGRP-induced vasodilation seem to be similar in resistance-sized arteries of human and rats.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In order to reduce sugar and maintaining the product quality at the same time, functional ingredients and alternative sweetening agents have to be incorporated. In this study, the sourdough lactic acid bacteria Leuconostoc citreum TR116, selected for its ability to produce high amounts of mannitol, was used to produce wheat sourdough and its biochemical characteristics (cell count, pH, TTA, sugar- and acid profile, as well as mannitol production) were monitored over 48 h. The so produced sourdough was then incorporated, as a functional ingredient, into a sugar reduced burger bun system and the quality characteristics of the dough and the final product were determined. Sourdough incorporation counteract the negative effects of sugar reduction on dough properties and resulted in the same viscoelastic properties (0.423 ± 0.008) and gluten-network-development (PMT: 160 ± 12.6 s; TM: 44.0 ± 2.6 BU) as the full-sugar control dough. Furthermore, the investigation of specific volume, crumb hardness and chewiness revealed no significant differences between sugar reduced sourdough burger buns and its control. It is noteworthy that sourdough contributed to browning reaction resulting in darker crumb and crust colour (-8.2%; -9.6%) and it extended microbial shelf life of the burger buns significantly (+3.5 days). Sensory evaluation showed no significant differences in sweetness and sourness between sugar reduced buns containing sourdough and the full-sugar control. In conclusion, the incorporation of mannitol-rich sourdough fermented by Leuconostoc citreum TR116 represents a novel technological approach in the field of sugar reduction and showed high potential as a functional ingredient to ameliorate the losses of important quality parameters. Especially sourdough containing higher amounts of mannitol and lower amounts of lactate improved significantly the dough and burger bun quality.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) and their interactions with sirtuins play an important role in regulating intermediary  in this process. However, there is little research into whether PARP inhibition affects alcoholic and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH/NASH).We investigated the effects of genetic deletion of PARP1 and pharmacological inhibition of PARP in models of early alcoholic steatohepatitis, as well as on Kupffer cell activation in vitro using biochemical assays, real-time PCR, and histological analyses. The effects of PARP inhibition were also evaluated in high fat or methionine and choline deficient diet-induced steatohepatitis models in mice.PARP activity was increased in livers due to excessive alcohol intake, which was associated with decreased NAD content and SIRT1 activity. Pharmacological inhibition of PARP restored the hepatic NAD content, attenuated the decrease in SIRT1 activation and beneficially affected the -, inflammatory-, and oxidative stress-related alterations due to alcohol feeding in the liver. PARP1 animals were protected against alcoholic steatohepatitis and pharmacological inhibition of PARP or genetic deletion of PARP1 also attenuated Kupffer cell activation in vitro. Furthermore, PARP inhibition decreased hepatic triglyceride accumulation,  dysregulation, or inflammation and/or fibrosis in models of NASH.Our results suggests that PARP inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy in steatohepatitis with high translational potential, considering the availability of PARP inhibitors for clinical treatment of cancer.Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) are the most abundant nuclear enzymes. The PARP inhibitor olaparib (Lynparza) is a recently FDA-approved therapy for cancer. This study shows that PARP is overactivated in livers of subjects with alcoholic liver disease and that pharmacological inhibition of this enzyme with 3 different PARP inhibitors, including olaparib, attenuates high fat or alcohol induced liver injury, abnormal  alteration, fat accumulation, inflammation and/or fibrosis in preclinical models of liver disease.

In contrast to plants and microbes, which employ enzymes called terpene synthases (TPSs) to synthesize terpene metabolites, limited information from few species is available about the enzymatic mechanisms underlying terpene pheromone biosynthesis in insects. Several stink bugs (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), among them severe agricultural pests, release 15-carbon sesquiterpenes with a bisabolene skeleton as sex or aggregation pheromones. The harlequin bug, , a specialist pest of crucifers, uses two stereoisomers of 10,11-epoxy-1-bisabolen-3-ol as a male-released aggregation pheromone called murgantiol. We show that TPS (IDS-1), an enzyme unrelated to plant and microbial TPSs but with similarity to -isoprenyl diphosphate synthases (IDS) of the core terpene biosynthetic pathway, catalyzes the formation of (1,6,7)-1,10-bisaboladien-1-ol (sesquipiperitol) as a terpene intermediate in murgantiol biosynthesis. Sesquipiperitol, a so-far-unknown compound in animals, also occurs in plants, indicating convergent evolution in the biosynthesis of this sesquiterpene.

Phylogenetic analysis suggests that TPS is derived from a -IDS progenitor and diverged from bona fide -IDS proteins including IDS-2, which functions as an (,)-farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) synthase. Structure-guided mutagenesis revealed several residues critical to TPS and FPPS activity.

After the administration period, the aortic diameter, elastin content, macrophage infiltration, MMP levels, and levels of inflammatory cytokines, including nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), were measured.The aortic diameter was significantly suppressed in the CAM group (P < .001). No rupture death was observed in the CAM group in contrast to five deaths (38%) in the control group (P < .01). CAM significantly suppressed the degradation of aortic elastin (56.3% vs 16.5%; P < .001) and decreased the infiltration of inflammatory macrophages (0.05 vs 0.16; P < .01). Compared with the controls, the enzymatic activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was significantly reduced in the CAM group (MMP-2, 0.15 vs 0.56 [P < .01]; MMP-9, 0.12 vs 0.60 [P < .01]), and the levels of interleukin 1β (346.6 vs 1066.0; P < .05), interleukin 6 (128.4 vs 346.2; P < .05), and phosphorylation of NF-κB were also decreased (0.3 vs 2.0; P < .01).CAM suppressed the progression and rupture of AA through the suppression of inflammatory macrophage infiltration, a reduction in MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity, and the inhibition of elastin degradation associated with the suppression of NF-κB phosphorylation.Copyright © 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery.

Tropane alkaloids such as scopolamine and hyoscyamine are used in modern medicine to treat pain, motion sickness, as eye pupil dilators and antidotes against organo-phosphate poisoning. Hyoscyamine is converted to 6β-hydroxyhyoscyamine (anisodamine) and scopolamine by hyoscyamine 6β-hydroxylase (H6H), a 2-oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenase. We describe here a marked chemo-diversity in the tropane alkaloid content in Mandragora spp. M. officinarum and M. turcomanica lack anisodamine and scopolamine but display up to 10 fold higher hyoscyamine levels as compared with M. autumnalis. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that H6H is highly conserved among scopolamine-producing Solanaceae. MoH6H present in M. officinarum differs in several amino acid residues including a homozygotic mutation in the substrate binding region of the protein and its prevalence among accessions was confirmed by Cleaved-Amplified-Polymorphic-Sequence analyses. Functional expression revealed that MaH6H, a gene isolated from M. autumnalis encodes an active H6H enzyme while the MoH6H sequence isolated from M. officinarum was functionally inactive. A single G to T mutation in nucleotide 663 of MoH6H is associated with the lack of anisodamine and scopolamine in M. officinalis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, the protective mechanisms of C-strain vaccine and cellular immunity conferred by T cell receptors (TCRs) are less well defined. We aimed to analyse the association between the complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) spectratype of αβTCR in CD4 T cells and C-strain vaccine; and to find conserved CDR3 amino acid motifs in specific TCR α- and β-chains. We found that the CDR3 spectratype showed dynamic changes correlating with C-strain vaccine immunisation and that TCR AV5S/8-3S/8-4S/14/38 and BV4S//7S/15S/30 gene families showed clonal expansion in immunised pigs. The sequences of CDR3 from these clonally expanded T cells indicated a high frequency of the 'KLX' motif in the TCR α chain and the 'GGX' motif in β chain, and Jα39, Jα43, Jβ2.5 and Jβ2.3 genes were also found in high frequency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the dynamic changes of αβTCRs and conserved CDR3 amino acid motifs in CD4 T cells from C-strain vaccine-immunised pigs, which will provide a basis for the development of high-efficiency epitope vaccines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29987924>Applying an Electrophilicity-Based Strategy to Develop a Novel Nrf2 Activator Inspired from Dietary [6]-Shogaol.</a></h2><p>Activation of nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a crucial cellular defense mechanisms against oxidative stress and also an effective means to decrease the risk of oxidative stress-related diseases including cancer. Thus, identifying novel Nrf2 activators is highly anticipated. Inspired from [6]-shogaol (), an active component of ginger, herein we developed a novel potent Nrf2 activator, (1E,4E)-1-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-7-methylocta-1,4,6-trien-3-one (SA) by an electrophilicity-based strategy. Compared with the parent , SA bearing a short but entirely conjugated unsaturated ketone chain manifested the improved electrophilicity and cytoprotection (cell viability for the 10 μM - and SA-treated group being 48.9 ± 5.3% and 76.1 ± 3.2%, respectively) against tert-butylhydroperoxide ( t-BHP)-induced cell death (cell viability for the t-BHP-stimulated group being 42.4 ± 0.4%) of HepG2. Mechanistic study uncovers that SA works as a potent Nrf2 activator by inducing Keap1 modification, inhibiting Nrf2 ubiquitylation and phosphorylating ERK in a Michael acceptor-dependent fashion. Taking  as an example, this works illustrates the feasibility and importance of applying an electrophilicity-based strategy to develop Nrf2 activators with dietary molecules as an inspiration due to their low toxicity and extraordinarily diverse chemical scaffolds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28182502>Effect of Dietary Nitrate Supplementation on Swimming Performance in Trained Swimmers.</a></h2><p>Nitrate supplementation appears to be most ergogenic when oxygen availability is restricted and subsequently may be particularly beneficial for swimming performance due to the breath-hold element of this sport. This represents the first investigation of nitrate supplementation and swimming time-trial (TT) performance. In a randomized double-blind repeated-measures crossover study, ten (5 male, 5 female) trained swimmers ingested 140ml nitrate-rich (~12.5mmol nitrate) or nitrate-depleted (~0.01mmol nitrate) beetroot juice. Three hours later, subjects completed a maximal effort swim TT comprising 168m (8 × 21m lengths) backstroke. Preexercise fractional exhaled nitric oxide concentration was significantly elevated with nitrate compared with placebo, Mean (SD): 17 (9) vs. 7 (3)p.p.b., p = .008. Nitrate supplementation had a likely trivial effect on overall swim TT performance (mean difference 1.22s; 90% CI -0.18-2.; 0.93%; p = .144; d = 0.13; unlikely beneficial (22.6%), likely trivial (77.2%), most unlikely negative (0.2%)). The effects of nitrate supplementation during the first half of the TT were trivial (mean difference 0.29s; 90% CI -0.94-1.5s; 0.46%; p = .678; d = 0.05), but there was a possible beneficial effect of nitrate supplementation during the second half of the TT (mean difference 0.93s; 90% CI 0.13-1.70s; 1.36%; p = .062; d = 0.24; possibly beneficial (63.5%), possibly trivial (36.3%), most unlikely negative (0.2%)). The duration and speed of underwater swimming within the performance did not differ between nitrate and placebo (both p > .30). Nitrate supplementation increased nitric oxide bioavailability but did not benefit short-distance swimming performance or the underwater phases of the TT. Further investigation into the effects of nitrate supplementation during the second half of performance tests may be warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28333832>Immunologic effects of trauma and transfusion.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29804740>Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 regulates neointimal growth in a humanized model for restenosis.</a></h2><p>The main objective of this study was to define a role of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) in the arterial injury response of a human artery. The hypotheses were tested that injury induces an expansion of S1PR1-positive cells and that these cells accumulate toward the lumen because they follow the sphingosine-1-phosphate gradient from arterial wall tissue (low) to plasma (high).A humanized rat model was used in which denuded human internal mammary artery (IMA) was implanted into the position of the abdominal aorta of immunosuppressed Rowett nude rats. This injury model is characterized by medial as well as intimal hyperplasia, whereby intimal cells are of human origin. At 7, 14, and 28 days after implantation, grafts were harvested and processed for fluorescent immunostaining for S1PR1 and smooth muscle α-actin. Nuclei were stained with 4',6-diamidine-2'-phenylindole dihydrochloride. Using digitally reconstructed, complete cross sections of grafts, intimal and medial areas were measured, whereby the medial area had virtually been divided into an outer (toward adventitia) and inner (toward lumen) layer. The fraction of S1PR1-positive cells was determined in each layer by counting S1PR1-positive and S1PR1-negative cells.The fraction of S1PR1-postive cells in naive IMA is 58.9% ± 6.0% (mean ± standard deviation). At day 28 after implantation, 81.6% ± 4.4% of medial cells were scored S1PR1 positive (P < .01). At day 14, the ratio between S1PR1-positive and S1PR1-negative cells was significantly higher in the lumen-oriented inner layer (9.3 ± 2.1 vs 6.0 ± 1.0; P < .01). Cells appearing in the intima at day 7 and day 14 were almost all S1PR1 positive. At day 28, however, about one-third of intimal cells were scored S1PR1 negative.From these data, we conclude that denudation of IMA specifically induces the expansion of S1PR1-positive cells. Based on the nonrandom distribution of S1PR1-positive cells, we consider the possibility that much like lymphocytes, S1PR1-positive smooth muscle cells also use S1PR1 to recognize the sphingosine-1-phosphate gradient from tissue (low) to plasma (high) and so migrate out of the media toward the intima of the injured IMA.Copyright © 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery.

Here, we have systematically investigated how the xyloside concentration and the type of xyloside, as well as the cell type, influenced the structure of xyloside-primed glycosaminoglycans in terms of the heparan sulfate and chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proportion and disaccharide composition. We found that although greatest influence was exerted by the cell type, both the xyloside concentration and type of xyloside impacted the proportion of heparan sulfate and the complexity of chondroitin/dermatan sulfate. The disaccharide composition of the chondroitin/dermatan sulfate was influenced by the xyloside concentration and type of xyloside to a higher extent than that of the heparan sulfate; the proportion of 4S-sulfated disaccharides in the chondroitin/dermatan sulfate decreased and the proportions of -sulfated and/or nonsulfated disaccharides increased both with increasing concentrations of xyloside and with increasing xyloside hydrophobicity, whereas the proportion of nonsulfated disaccharides was primarily altered in the heparan sulfate with increasing concentrations of xyloside. Our results indicate that it is feasible to not only produce large amounts of glycosaminoglycans in living cells but also to fine-tune their structures by using xylosides of different types and at different concentrations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29463393>Quel pourrait être le futur de la prise en charge de la maladie rénale chronique en nutrition ?</a></h2><p>The nutrition care of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains a central question which is permanently studied.

The hyoscyamine 6β-hydroxylase genes of Hyoscyamus niger (HnH6H) and S. lurida (SlH6H) were cloned and respectively overexpressed in hairy root cultures of S. lurida, to compare their effects on promoting the production of TAs, especially the high-value scopolamine. Root cultures with SlH6H/HnH6H overexpression were confirmed by PCR and real-time quantitative PCR, suggesting that the enzymatic steps defined by H6H were strongly elevated at the transcriptional level. Tropane alkaloids, including hyoscyamine, anisodamine and scopolamine, were analyzed by HPLC. Scopolamine and anisodamine contents were remarkably elevated in the root cultures overexpressing SlH6H/HnH6H, whereas that of hyoscyamine was more or less reduced, when compared with those of the control. These results also indicated that SlH6H and HnH6H promoted anisodamine production at similar levels in S. lurida root cultures. More importantly, HnH6H-overexpressing root cultures had more scopolamine in them that did SlH6H-overexpressing root cultures. This study not only provides a feasible way of overexpressing H6H to produce high-value scopolamine in engineered root cultures of S. lurida but also found that HnH6H was better than SlH6H for engineering scopolamine production.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The aims of this study were to assess the relative value of endothelial inflammatory markers for this application and to develop molecular ultrasound contrast agents for their imaging.Human CEA specimens were obtained prospectively from asymptomatic (30) and symptomatic (30) patients. Plaques were assessed by semiquantitative immunohistochemistry for vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor 1, P-selectin, and von Willebrand factor. Established small peptide ligands to each of these targets were then synthesized and covalently conjugated to the surface of lipid-shelled microbubble ultrasound contrast agents, which were then evaluated in a flow chamber for binding kinetics to activated human aortic endothelial cells under variable shear conditions.Expression of VCAM-1 on the endothelium of CEA specimens from symptomatic patients was 2.4-fold greater than that from asymptomatic patients (P < .01). Expression was not significantly different between groups for P-selectin (P = .43), von Willebrand factor (P = .59), or lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor 1 (P = .99). Although most plaques from asymptomatic patients displayed low VCAM-1 expression, approximately one in five expressed high VCAM-1 similar to plaques from symptomatic patients. In vitro flow chamber experiments demonstrated that VCAM-1-targeted microbubbles bind cells that express VCAM-1, even under high-shear conditions that approximate those found in human carotid arteries, whereas binding efficiency was lower for the other agents.VCAM-1 displays significantly higher expression on high-risk (symptomatic) vs low-risk (asymptomatic) carotid plaques. Ultrasound contrast agents bearing ligands for VCAM-1 can sustain high-shear attachment and may be useful for identifying patients in whom more aggressive treatment is warranted.Copyright © 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery.

However, very little is known whether the donors' anti-A and/or anti-B titers change over time and whether repeated titer measurements on the same donor are required to ensure that each donation produces a low titer product.The anti-A and/or anti-B titers were measured on 56 healthy adult volunteers (47 blood donors; nine blood center personnel) every 3 months for 12 consecutive months using an automated solid phase analyzer. The results were expressed as log2 titer steps (e.g., titer 32 = 5 titer steps).Minor variations in the average anti-A and/or anti-B titers were seen over time; the maximum individual SD in each group was 1.50 (IgG anti-A) or 1.00 (IgM anti-A, IgM, and IgG anti-B). When the SDs for the four titer measurements from all 56 volunteers were combined as appropriate, the highest overall combined SD was 0.47 titer steps for IgG anti-A. This value corresponds to a 95% confidence interval for intraindividual variation in this antibody's titer over 12 months of 0.96 titer steps. Thus, based on one measurement, an IgG anti-A with a titer step of, for example, 6 would be expected to be in the range of titer step 5 to titer step 7 over the course of 1 year with 95% probability.The titers of anti-A and/or anti-B among healthy adults are stable over at least 1 year. This suggests that repeated titer measurements within a year on the same donor are not necessary if donations are made at 3 months or longer intervals.Diagnostic study, level V.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28478883>Current Issues in Fluid and Electrolyte Management.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30194276>6-Chloro-5-[4-(1-Hydroxycyclobutyl)Phenyl]-1-Indole-3-Carboxylic Acid is a Highly Selective Substrate for Glucuronidation by UGT1A1, Relative to -Estradiol.</a></h2><p>6-Chloro-5-[4-(1-hydroxycyclobutyl)phenyl]-1-indole-3-carboxylic acid (PF-06409577) is a direct activator of the human 1-containing adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (ΑMPK) isoforms. The clearance mechanism of PF-06409577 in animals and humans involves uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase (UGT)-mediated glucuronidation to an acyl glucuronide metabolite of PF-06409577 [(2,3,4,5,6)-6-((6-chloro-5-(4-(1-hydroxycyclobutyl)phenyl)-1-indole-3-carbonyl)oxy)-3,4,5-trihydroxytetrahydro-2-pyran-2-carboxylic acid (M1)], which retains selective activation of human 1-containing AMPK isoforms. This paper describes a detailed characterization of the human UGT isoform(s) responsible for glucuronidation of PF-06409577 to M1. Studies using a panel of 13 human recombinant UGT (hrUGT) enzymes indicated that PF-06409577 was converted to M1 in a highly selective fashion by UGT1A1, which was further verified in human liver microsomes treated with specific chemical inhibitors, and in different UGT1A1 expressers. Conversion of PF-06409577 to M1 by UGT1A1 occurred in a relatively selective fashion, compared with -estradiol (ES), a conventional probe substrate of UGT1A1. The Michaelis-Menten constant ( ) and   values describing the formation of M1 from PF-06409577 in hrUGT1A1 and microsomal preparations from human intestine, liver, and kidney ranged from 131 to 212 M ( ) and 107-3834 pmol/min per milligram ( ) in the presence of 2% bovine serum albumin. Relative activity factors (RAF) were determined for UGT1A1 using PF-06409577 and ES to enable estimation of intrinsic clearance from various tissues. RAF values from PF-06409577 and ES were generally comparable with the exception of intestinal microsomes, where ES overestimated the RAF of UGT1A1 due to glucuronidation by intestinal UGT1A8 and UGT1A10. Our results suggest the potential utility of PF-06409477 as a selective probe UGT1A1 substrate for UGT reaction phenotyping and inhibition studies in preclinical discovery/development.Copyright © 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30000416>Pravastatin.</a></h2><p>Levels of pravastatin in milk are low, but no relevant published information exists with its use during breastfeeding.

Enhancement of autologous fat grafts with the addition of the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) has been reported to improve long-term volume retention. Stromal vascular fraction is most commonly isolated using enzymatic digestion, but it is unknown what effect the digestion process has on the adipocytes and SVF cells that comprise the graft. Some clinicians have reported use of enzymatically digested fat grafts to alter the physical properties of the tissue in specialized applications. We have previously reported that increasing collagenase digestion duration adversely affects the viability of adipocytes and SVF cells. Here, we aimed to determine if collagenase digestion of adipocytes before grafting is detrimental to long-term graft retention and if SVF supplementation can abrogate these potential deleterious effects.We used a published xenograft model in which human lipoaspirate was implanted into the scalp of immunocompromised mice to study the effects of collagenase digestion on in vivo graft survival after 12 weeks. We used 4 experimental groups: grafts composed of collagenase-digested and nondigested adipocytes (50-minute digestion) and grafts with and without SVF supplementation. We used microcomputed tomography to serially and noninvasively quantify graft volume, in conjunction with hematoxylin-eosin staining of histological cross-sections of implanted and excised grafts to assess overall tissue viability. We found that adipocytes that were collagenase-digested before implantation had significantly lower retention rates at 12 weeks and poorer tissue health, which was assessed by quantifying the number of intact adipocytes, the number of cystic formations, and by scoring the degree of inflammation and fibrosis. Further, we found that SVF supplementation of the digested grafts improved graft survival, but not to the level observed in undigested grafts.We conclude that collagenase digestion adversely affects the long-term volume retention of fat grafts, but that graft retention is improved by SVF supplementation. These experimental results can serve as an initial framework to further elucidate the reported efficacy and safety of using collagenase-digested fat grafts and SVF in the clinical setting.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28537398>Discovery of Clinical Candidate 2-((2S,)-2-Phenyl-6-hydroxyadamantan-2-yl)-1-(3'-hydroxyazetidin-1-yl)ethanone [BMS-816336], an Orally Active Novel Selective 11β-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1 Inhibitor.</a></h2><p>BMS-816336 (6n-2), a hydroxy-substituted adamantyl acetamide, has been identified as a novel, potent inhibitor against human 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) enzyme (IC 3.0 nM) with >10000-fold selectivity over human 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11β-HSD2). 6n-2 exhibits a robust acute pharmacodynamic effect in cynomolgus monkeys (ED 0.12 mg/kg) and in DIO mice.

Tear film break-up time was measured by the Tearscope Plus™ with fine grid insert. Measurements were made in triplicate, with no fluorescein instillation (NIBUT), then following application of a minimal volume of 1μl fluorescein from the Dry Eye Test™ (mTBUT), and finally with 15-30μl of fluid instilled via a conventional fluorescein strip (TBUT). A fifteen-minute interval between each set of measurements minimised the risk of residual contamination effects.All three techniques displayed statistically significant pairwise correlation (all p<0.001). TBUT values were significantly shorter than both NIBUT (geometric mean 8. versus 10.9s, p=0.03) and mTBUT (geometric mean 8. versus 10., p=0.03), and demonstrated narrower spread (both p<0.05). No significant differences were detected between NIBUT and mTBUT (all p>0.05).Tear film break-up time values measured with conventional fluorescein instillation were shortened, while minimal fluorescein instillation and non-invasive methods produced comparable readings. This suggests that minimising instilled volumes can reduce the impact of fluorescein on clinical measurements of tear film stability.Copyright © 2017 British Contact Lens Association.

Glutamatergic and RNA interference strategies.</a></h2><p>In the second part we focus on two treatment strategies that may overcome the main limitations of current antidepressant drugs. First, we review the experimental and clinical evidence supporting the use of glutamatergic drugs as fast-acting antidepressants. Secondly, we review the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) and the use of small RNAs (e.g.., small interfering RNAs or siRNAs) to knockdown genes in monoaminergic and non-monoaminergic neurons and induce antidepressant-like responses in experimental animals. The development of glutamatergic agents is a promising venue for antidepressant drug development, given the antidepressant properties of the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine. Its unique properties appear to result from the activation of AMPA receptors by a metabolite [(2S,;2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK)] and mTOR signaling. These effects increase synaptogenesis in prefrontal cortical pyramidal neurons and enhance serotonergic neurotransmission via descending inputs to the raphe nuclei. This view is supported by the cancellation of ketamine's antidepressant-like effects by inhibition of serotonin synthesis. We also review existing evidence supporting the involvement of miRNAs in MDD and the preclinical use of RNA interference (RNAi) strategies to target genes involved in antidepressant response. Many miRNAs have been associated to MDD, some of which e.g., miR-135 targets genes involved in antidepressant actions. Likewise, SSRI-conjugated siRNA evokes faster and/or more effective antidepressant-like responses. Intranasal application of sertraline-conjugated siRNAs directed to 5-HT receptors and SERT evoked much faster changes of pre- and postsynaptic antidepressant markers than those produced by fluoxetine.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.

This study investigates the glucuronidation of  and its effect on cell cytotoxicity and Nrf2-inducing activities of .The glucuronidated metabolite of , 4-O-monoglucuronide  (-G), was synthesized and characterized for the first time. Glucuronidation of  in humans was studied using microsomes of the liver and intestine and recombinant UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGTs). The kinetics of  glucuronidation by human liver and intestinal microsomes followed the substrate inhibition kinetics model. The intrinsic glucuronidation clearance (CL ) of  in human liver microsomes was higher than that in human intestine microsomes. Among the recombinant UGTs examined, UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A6, 1A8, 1A10, 2B7, 2B15, and 2B17 exhibited glucuronidation activity toward , with UGT2B7 being the most potent one. Compared with , the glucuronidation of  largely eliminated its cell cytotoxicity against human colon cancer cell lines HT-116 and HT-29, and its Nrf2-inducing activity.The findings from current study provide foundations for understanding the role of glucuronidation in biotransformation and biological activities of .© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, an enzyme that can specifically isolate such domains through the selective digestion of other domains in polysaccharides has not yet been reported. Here, we identified a glycosaminoglycan lyase from a marine bacterium  sp. FC509. This enzyme efficiently degraded hyaluronic acid (HA) and CS variants, but not E unit-rich CS-E, into unsaturated disaccharides; therefore, we designated this enzyme a CS-E-resisted HA/CS lyase (HCLase Er). We isolated a series of resistant oligosaccharides from the final product of a low-sulfated CS-E exhaustively digested by HCLase Er and found that the E units were dramatically accumulate in these resistant oligosaccharides. By determining the structures of several resistant tetrasaccharides, we observed that all of them possessed a ΔHexUAα1-3GalNAc(4S,) at their non-reducing ends, indicating that the disulfation of GalNAc abrogates HCLase Er activity on the β1-4 linkage between the E unit and the following disaccharide. ΔHexUAα1-3GalNAc(4S,)β1-4GlcUAβ1-3GalNAc(4S,) was most strongly resistant to HCLase Er. To our knowledge, this study is the first reporting a glycosaminoglycan lyase specifically inhibited by both 4-- and 6--sulfation of GalNAc. Site-directed and truncation mutagenesis experiments indicated that HCLase Er may use a general acid-base catalysis mechanism and that an extra domain (Gly-Gln) is critical for its activity. This enzyme will be a useful tool for structural analyses and for preparing bioactive oligosaccharides of HA and CS variants, particularly from E unit-rich CS chains.© 2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30576513>Plant-specific ribosome biogenesis factors in Arabidopsis thaliana with essential function in rRNA processing.</a></h2><p>rRNA processing and assembly of ribosomal proteins during maturation of ribosomes involve many ribosome biogenesis factors (RBFs). Recent studies identified differences in the set of RBFs in humans and yeast, and the existence of plant-specific RBFs has been proposed as well. To identify such plant-specific RBFs, we characterized T-DNA insertion mutants of 15 Arabidopsis thaliana genes encoding nuclear proteins with nucleotide binding properties that are not orthologues to yeast or human RBFs. Mutants of nine genes show an altered rRNA processing ranging from inhibition of initial 35S pre-rRNA cleavage to final maturation events like the  pre-rRNA processing. These phenotypes led to their annotation as 'involved in rRNA processing' - IRP. The irp mutants are either lethal or show developmental and stress related phenotypes. We identified IRPs for maturation of the plant-specific precursor 5'-5.8S and one affecting the pathway with ITS2 first cleavage of the 35S pre-rRNA transcript. Moreover, we realized that 5'-5.8S processing is essential, while a mutant causing  accumulation shows only a weak phenotype. Thus, we demonstrate the importance of the maturation of the plant-specific precursor 5'-5.8S for plant development as well as the occurrence of an ITS2 first cleavage pathway in fast dividing tissues.© The Author(s) 2018.

The cancer tissue samples contained over twice as much chondroitin sulfate (CS)/dermatan sulfate (DS) as did the normal tissue samples, while the amount of heparan sulfate (HS) and hyaluronan (HA) in normal and cancer tissues were not significantly different. In HS, several minor disaccharide components, including NS6S, NS2S and 2S were significantly lower in cancer tissues, while the levels of major disaccharides, TriS, NS and 0S disaccharides were not significantly different in normal and cancer tissues. In regards to CS/DS, the level of 4S disaccharide (the major component of CS-type A and DS) decreased and the level of  disaccharide (the major component of CS- type C) increased in cancer tissues. We also compared the content and structure of GAGs in lung tissues from smoking and non-smoking patients. Analysis of the glycolipids showed all lipids present in these lung tissues, with the exception of sphingomyelin were higher in cancer tissues than in normal tissues. Western analysis showed that syndecan 1 and 2 proteoglycans displayed much higher expression in cancer tissue/biopsy samples.

The Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients-Removing Excess Glucose (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) study demonstrated for the first time that a glucose-lowering agent, the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin, could reduce major adverse cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization for heart failure, and overall mortality when given in addition to standard care in patients with T2DM at high cardiovascular risk. These results were entirely unexpected and have led to much speculation regarding the potential mechanisms underlying cardiovascular benefits.

R. conorii, the causative agent of Mediterranean spotted fever, is a tick-borne pathogen that primarily infects microvascular endothelium in humans. We have determined the transcriptional landscape of R. conorii during infection of Human Microvascular Endothelial Cells (HMECs) by strand-specific RNA sequencing to identify 4 riboswitches, 13 trans-acting (intergenic), and 22 cis-acting (antisense) small RNAs (termed 'Rc_sR's). Independent expression of four novel trans-acting sRNAs (Rc_sR31, Rc_sR33, Rc_sR35, and Rc_sR42) and known bacterial sRNAs (, RNaseP_bact_a, ffs, and α-tmRNA) was next confirmed by Northern hybridization. Comparative analysis during infection of HMECs vis-à-vis tick AAE2 cells revealed significantly higher expression of Rc_sR35 and Rc_sR42 in HMECs, whereas Rc_sR31 and Rc_sR33 were expressed at similar levels in both cell types. We further predicted a total of 502 genes involved in all important biological processes as potential targets of Rc_sRs and validated the interaction of Rc_sR42 with cydA (cytochrome d ubiquinol oxidase subunit I).

Four weeks after the surgery, the animals were subjected to moderate (12 m/min) or intense (21 m/min) treadmill exercises for 30 min/day, 5 days/week for 4 weeks. PTOA development in articular cartilage and SB was examined using histological and immunohistochemical analyses, micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) analysis, and biomechanical testing at 8 weeks after surgery. Gremlin-1 was injected to determine the role of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling on PTOA development following moderate exercise.Moderate exercise increased BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-6, BMP receptor 2, pSmad-5, and inhibitor of DNA binding protein-1 expression in the superficial zone chondrocytes and suppressed cartilage degeneration, osteophyte growth, SB damage, and osteoclast-mediated SB resorption. However, intense exercise had little effect on BMP expression and even caused progression of these osteoarthritis (OA) changes. Gremlin-1 injection following moderate exercise caused progression of the PTOA development down to the level of the non-exercise DMM-operated knee.Exercise regulated cartilage-SB PTOA development in DMM-operated knees in a dose-dependent manner. Our findings shed light on the important role of BMP expression in superficial zone chondrocytes in attenuation of PTOA development following physiological exercise loading. Further studies to support a mechanism by which BMPs would be beneficial in preventing PTOA progression are warranted.Copyright © 2016 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.

To improve its thermostability, we combined single disulfide bonds which our group identified previously. In this study, combining different regional disulfide bonds had greater effect than combining same regional disulfide bonds. Furthermore, mutants with 4, 5, and 6 disulfide bonds exhibited dramatically enhanced thermostability.

Molecular dynamics simulation revealed that multiple disulfide bonds resulted in more rigid structures of mutants 4s, 5s and , and prolonged enzyme unfolding times. Moreover, secretions of mutants 5s and  were significantly increased by 60% and 80% by co-expressing with the chaperone protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), which mitigated the reduced production issue caused by multiple disulfide bonds.

Zeiss Airyscan 880 ″super-resolution" or "high-resolution" imaging was done with very low levels of illumination (0.009% laser power). In cellular areas imaged every 9 s (ROI or regions of interest), transient depolarizations of variable amplitudes occurred at increasing rates for the first 30 min. The time to first depolarization events was 8.4 min (±1.1 SEM n = 21 cells). At longer times, essentially permanent and irreversible depolarizations occurred at an increasing fraction of all events. In other cellular areas surrounding the ROI, mitochondria were rarely illuminated (once per 5 min) and virtually no permanent depolarization events occurred for over 1 h of imaging. These findings suggest that photon stress due to the imaging itself plays an important role in the generation of both the transient mPTP opening events as well as the permanent mPTP opening events. Consistent with the evidence that photon "stress" in mitochondria loaded with virtually any photon absorbing substance, generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) [1-5], we show that cyclosporine-A (CsA, 10 μM) and the antioxidant n-acetyl cysteine (NAC, 10 mM), reduced the number of events by 80% and 93% respectively. Furthermore, CsA and NAC treatment led to the virtual disappearance of permanent depolarization events. Nevertheless, all transient depolarization events in any condition (control, CsA and NAC) appeared to repolarize with a similar half-time of 30 ± 6 s (n = 478) at 37 °C. Further experiments showed quantitatively similar results in cerebral vascular smooth muscle cells, using a different confocal system, and different photon absorbing reagent (TMRE; tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester). In these experiments, using modest power (1% laser power) transient depolarization events were seen in only 8 out of 23 cells while with higher power (8%), all cells showed transient events, which align with the level of photon stress being the driver of the effect. Together, our findings suggest that photon-induced ROS is sufficient to cause depolarization events of individual mitochondria in quiescent cells; without electrical or mechanical activity to stimulates mitochondrial , and without raising the mitochondrial matrix Ca. In a broad context, these findings neither support nor deny the relevance or occurrence of ΔΨ depolarization events in specific putatively physiologic mitochondrial behaviors such as MitoFlashes [6,7] or MitoWinks [8]. Instead, our findings raise a caution with regards to the physiological and pathophysiological functions attributed to singular ΔΨ depolarization events when those functions are investigated using photon absorbing substances. Nevertheless, using photon stress as a tool ("Optical Stress-Probe"), we can extract information on the activation, reversibility, permanency and kinetics of mitochondrial depolarization. These data may provide new information on mPTP, help identify the mPTP protein complex, and establish the physiological function of the mPTP protein complex and their links to MitoFlashes and MitoWinks.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, clear proofs of biodegradation were only presented for Comamonas testosteroni KT5 and Rhodococcus sp. OCT10. Hence, this study aims on the isolation of additional strains and their characterization in pilot-scale biotrickling filters. Three strains named OCT2, OCT9, and OCT14 of the genus Rhodococcus were isolated, able to mineralize gaseous 2-chlorotoluene like the previously isolated strain Rhodococcus sp. OCT10. The performance levels of these strains were tested in four biotrickling filters each containing 18.8 L of polyurethane foam package, showing elimination capacities of carbon (C) of 30.9 (OCT2), 30.1 (OCT9), 32.2 (OCT10), and 3.9 g C·m·h (OCT14) at an average crude gas level of 397.6 mg C·m and an empty bed residence time (EBRT) of 22.6 s. Since OCT10 showed the highest performance levels, this strain was characterized in a second biotrickling filter configuration at long-term conditions of 985 days, varying crude gas levels, EBRT and nutrient supply. Chloride balancing showed a recovery of 94.4% of 2-chlorotoluene eliminated out of the gas phase, pointing out mineralization of 2-chlorotoluene. German emission limit values were met at crude gas levels up to 750 mg C·m at EBRTs of 120 s or higher. The maximum elimination capacity was 51.2 g C·m·h at a specific freight of 51.9 g C·m·h and an EBRT of 254 s. Performance levels were strongly boosted by addition of ammonia as nutrient and stabilized at efficiency levels higher than 90% at a feed rate of 4 g ammonium sulfate per week and 100 L of package volume. Repetitive monitoring of the established 2-chlorotoluene degrading community by BOX-PCR fingerprinting revealed a high long-term stability of OCT10, underlining its suitability in this kind of application.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

GAG were isolated from chicken eggshell membranes and calcified shells. Disaccharide compositional analysis was performed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. All 4 groups of GAG - hyaluronan (HA), keratan sulfate (KS), chondroitin sulfate (CS), and heparan sulfate (HS) - were detected in shell membranes and in calcified shells. HA was the most plentiful GAG in shell membranes, and CS was the most abundant in calcified shells. The CS present, in both membranes and calcified shells, consisted primarily of , 4S, and 0S disaccharides. Neither 4S6S nor 2S was detectable in shell components. Small amounts of 2S4S were detected in membranes and TriS, and 2S4S and 2S6S were detected in calcified shells. HS in calcified shells contained all disaccharides except for 2S6S. In shell membranes, HS contained primarily NS and 0S as well as small amounts of TriS, NS2S, NS6S, and , but neither 2S6S nor 2S was detectable. The disaccharide composition of membrane CS, as well as membrane and calcified shell HS, were very similar in all eggshells. In contrast, the composition of calcified shell CS disaccharides was highly variable. In membranes, both HA and KS content showed a correlation with egg shape index. The 4S content correlated with eggshell strength, and 0S correlated with eggshell strength and calcified shell thickness. HS content and its disaccharide composition showed no apparent correlation to properties of calcified shells. In calcified shells, only HS  correlated with egg shape index. This study suggests that GAG content and disaccharide composition of shell membranes might impact the quality of chicken eggshells.© 2016 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28782676>Transverse relaxation of cerebrospinal fluid depends on glucose concentration.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the biophysical processes that generate specific T values and their relationship to specific cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) content.CSF T were measured ex vivo (14.1T) from isolated CSF collected from human, rat and non-human primate.

It is hypothesized that treatment of animals with resolvin D1 (RvD1) would reduce abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) formation by inhibiting NETosis.Wild-type 8- to 12-week-old C57BL/6 male mice (n = 47) and apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE) mice (n = 20) were used in two models to demonstrate the effects of RvD1 on AAA growth. In the topical elastase AAA model, wild-type mice were divided into three groups: a deactivated elastase control group, in which sham surgery was performed using deactivated elastase and mice were intravenously injected with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) once a day until harvest; an elastase group, in which active elastase was used to induce AAA and mice were injected with PBS daily until harvest; and an RvD1-treated group, in which AAA was induced and mice were injected with RvD1 daily until harvest. In the angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced AAA model, ApoE mice were fed a high-fat diet and implanted with osmotic infusion pumps containing Ang II (1000 ng/kg/min). The Ang II model was divided into two groups: an Ang II control group, in which Ang II was delivered and mice were injected with PBS daily until harvest; and an RvD1-treated group, in which Ang II was delivered and mice were injected with RvD1 daily until harvest. On postoperative day 3, day 14, or day 28, aortic and blood samples were collected for Western blot, histology, cytokine array, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and gelatin zymography after aortic diameter measurement.The day 14 RvD1-treated group demonstrated 42% reduced AAA diameter compared with the elastase group (P < .001). On postoperative day 3, the RvD1-treated group showed decreased levels of NETosis markers citrullinated histone H3 (P = .04) and neutrophil elastase (P = .002) compared with the elastase group. Among important cytokines involved in AAA formation, interleukin (IL) 1β was downregulated (P = .02) whereas IL-10, a protective cytokine, was upregulated (P = .01) in the RvD1-treated group. Active matrix metalloproteinase 2 also decreased in the RvD1-treated group (P = .03). The RvD1-treated group in the Ang II AAA model, a second model, demonstrated reduced AAA diameter compared with the Ang II control group on day 28 (P < .046). The RvD1-treated group showed decreased levels of citrullinated histone H3 on day 3 (P = .002). Cytokines interferon γ, IL-1β, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, and regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) were all decreased on day 28 (P < .05).RvD1-mediated inhibition of NETosis may represent a future medical treatment for the attenuation of AAA growth.Copyright © 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery.

Sessions consisted of a standardised running warm-up, followed by a 5km time trial (TT1), a one hour recovery period, then a repeat of the warm-up and 5km time trial (TT2). One session required the use of sports compression socks during the first warm-up and time trial (COMP), while the other did not (CON).The decline in run performance in CON from TT1 to TT2 was moderate and significantly greater than that experienced by runners in COMP (9., d=0.67, p<0.01).

TRAP has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer. Thus, this study set out to identify small-molecule inhibitors of TRAP activity. A microplate-based enzymatic assay for TRAP 5b was applied in a screen of 30,315 compounds, resulting in the identification of 90 primary hits. After removal of promiscuous compounds, unwanted groups, and false positives by orthogonal assays and three-concentration validation, the properties of 52 compounds were further investigated to better understand their mechanism of action. Full-concentration-response curves for these compounds were established under different enzyme concentrations and (pre)incubation times to remove compounds with inconsistent results and low potencies. Full-concentration-response curves were also performed for both isoforms, to examine isoform prevalence. Filtering led to six prioritized compounds, representing different clusters. One of these, CBK289001 or ()-6-[3-(2H-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl]-N-(propan-2-yl)-1H,4H,5H,6H,7H-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridine-5-carboxamide, demonstrated efficacy in a migration assay and IC values from 4 to 125 μm. Molecular docking studies and analog testing were performed around CBK289001 to provide openings for further improvement toward more potent blockers of TRAP activity.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28971709>Constituents from Apium graveolens and their anti-inflammatory effects.</a></h2><p>A phthalide glycoside, (3R, 4R)-4-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-senkyunolide (1), and a megastigmane glycoside, (, 7R)-3-oxo-megastigma-4, 8-dien-7-O-β-D-glucoside (2), along with two known aglycones (3-4), were isolated from the 70% EtOH extract of fresh whole grass of Apium graveolens L.

In the present study, we investigated the in vitro binding characteristics and in vivo analgesic effects of mirogabalin compared with those of pregabalin, a standard  ligand. Mirogabalin showed potent and selective binding affinities for the  subunits, while having no effects on 186 off-target proteins. Similar to pregabalin, mirogabalin did not show clear subtype selectivity (-1 vs. -2) or species differences (human vs. rat). However, in contrast to pregabalin, mirogabalin showed greater binding affinities for human -1, human -2, rat -1, and rat -2 subunits; further, it had a slower dissociation rate for the -1 subunit than the -2 subunit. Additionally, in experimental neuropathic pain models, partial sciatic nerve ligation rats and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, mirogabalin showed more potent and longer lasting analgesic effects. In safety pharmacological evaluations, mirogabalin and pregabalin inhibited rota-rod performance and locomotor activity in rats; however, the safety indices of mirogabalin were superior to those of pregabalin. In conclusion, mirogabalin shows potent and selective binding affinities for the human and rat  subunits, and slower dissociation rates for the -1 subunit than the -2 subunit. It shows potent and long-lasting analgesic effects in rat models of neuropathic pain, and wider safety margins for side effects of the central nervous system. These properties of mirogabalin can be associated with its unique binding characteristics.Copyright © 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29438888>Tricyclic pyrazolo[1,5-d][1,4]benzoxazepin-5(6H)-one scaffold derivatives: Synthesis and biological evaluation as selective BuChE inhibitors.</a></h2><p>BuChE inhibitors play important roles in treatment of patients with advanced Alzheimer's disease (AD). A series of tricyclic pyrazolo[1,5-d][1,4]benzoxazepin-5(6H)-one derivatives were synthesized and evaluated as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibitors. Some derivatives showed selective BuChE inhibitory activity, which was influenced by the volumes of the substituted groups at the C6 position and halogen substituents at the benzene ring of tricyclic scaffold. Among them, compounds 3f and 3o with dihalogen and 6-ethyl substituent showed the most potent activity (IC = 2.95, 2.04 μM, and mixed-type, non-competitive inhibition against BuChE, respectively). Eutomer (6R)-3o exhibited better BuChE inhibitory activity than ()-3o. Compound 3o exhibited nontoxic, good ADMET properties, and remarkable neuroprotective activity. Docking studies revealed the same binding orientation within the active site of target enzyme. Compound 3o was nicely bound to BuChE via three hydrogen bonds, one Alkyl interaction and three Pi-Alkyl interactions. The selective BuChE inhibitors had a potential use in progressive neurodegenerative disorder.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Analytical methods for the simultaneous determination of the plethora of hydroxylated, dehydrogenated and/or demethylated compounds formed after administration of ketamine hydrochloride are a prerequisite for future clinical investigations and a deeper understanding of the individual role of the isomers of these metabolites. In this study, we present development and validation of a method based on supercritical-fluid chromatography (SFC) coupled to single quadrupole MS detection that allows the separation of ketamine as well as all of its relevant metabolites detected in urine of healthy volunteers. Inherently to SFC methods, the run times of the novel protocol are four times shorter than in a comparable HPLC method, the use of organic solvents is reduced and we were able to demonstrate and validate the successful enantioselective separation and quantification of R- and S-ketamine, R- and S-norketamine, R- and S-dehydronorketamine and (2R,6R)- and (2S,)-hydroxynorketamine isomers differing in either constitution, stereochemistry, or both, in one run.

Current commercial pectinases are exclusively obtained from microbial sources, but here we report a pectin methylesterase (Sl-PME) and an endo-polygalacturonase (Sl-EPG) bioprospected from the sugarcane weevil, Sphenophorus levis, which revealed good potential for industrial applications. Sl-PME and Sl-EPG were overexpressed in Pichia pastoris, purified and enzymatically characterized. Sl-EPG presents optimal activity at pH 4-5 and 50 °C, showing that it can be used for juice extraction and clarification. On the other hand, Sl-PME presents optimal activity at pH 6-8 and 40 °C, and thus, suitable for both acidic and alkaline processing, such as coffee and tea fermentation. Sl-EPG shows V = 3.23 mM/min, K = 2.4 g/L and k = 418.6 s. While Sl-PME shows V = 0.14 mM/min, K = 4.1 g/L and k = 1.7 s. A PG inhibitor (PGIP2) weakly interfered in the Sl-EPG activity and Sl-PME was not affected by a usual PME inhibitor. Moreover, these enzymes manifested synergistic action towards methylesterified pectin. Here, we propose these enzymes as novel alternative tools for the current commercial pectinases.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Likewise, in pen cartridges, Ins in the clear phase of NPH(R-) was<1%, but 182±33%, 204±22% and 229±62% in the cloudy phases of Novo, Lilly and Sanofi NPH. Time needed to resuspend NPH (spent in tipping) in vials was brief with both Novo (5±1s) and Lilly NPH (6±1s), but longer with all pen cartridges (50±8s, 40± and 30±4s from Novo, Lilly and Sanofi, respectively; P=0.022). Time required for 50% separation into cloudy and clear parts of NPH was longer with Novo (60±7min) vs. Lilly (18±3min) in vials (P=0.021), and affected by temperature, but not by the different diameter sizes of the vials. With pen cartridges, separation into clear and cloudy parts was significantly faster than in vials (P<0.01).Ins in NPH preparations varies depending on their resuspension or not. Thus, subcutaneous injection of the same number of units of NPH in patients with diabetes may deliver different amounts of insulin depending on its prior NPH resuspension.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Only a few sRNAs have been described for Pasteurellaceae pathogens and no in-depth analysis of sRNAs has been described for Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, the causative agent of porcine pleuropneumonia, responsible for considerable losses in the swine industry. To search for sRNAs in A. pleuropneumoniae, we developed a strategy for the computational analysis of the bacterial genome by using four algorithms with different approaches, followed by experimental validation. The coding strand and expression of 17 out of 23 RNA candidates were confirmed by Northern blotting, RT-PCR, and RNA sequencing. Among them, two are likely riboswitches, three are housekeeping regulatory RNAs, two are the widely studied GcvB and  sRNAs, and 10 are putative novel trans-acting sRNAs, never before described for any bacteria. The latter group has several potential mRNA targets, many of which are involved with virulence, stress resistance, or , and connect the sRNAs in a complex gene regulatory network. The sRNAs identified are well conserved among the Pasteurellaceae that are evolutionarily closer to A. pleuropneumoniae and/or share the same host. Our results show that the combination of newly developed computational programs can be successfully utilized for the discovery of novel sRNAs and indicate an intricate system of gene regulation through sRNAs in A. pleuropneumoniae and in other Pasteurellaceae, thus providing clues for novel aspects of virulence that will be explored in further studies.© 2016 Rossi et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press for the RNA Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30414409>The Accumulation of Heparan Sulfate S-Domains in Kidney Transthyretin Deposits Accelerates Fibril Formation and Promotes Cytotoxicity.</a></h2><p>The highly sulfated domains of heparan sulfate (HS), alias HS S-domains, are made up of repeated trisulfated disaccharide units [iduronic acid (2S)-glucosamine (NS, )] and are selectively remodeled by extracellular endoglucosamine 6-sulfatases (Sulfs). Although HS S-domains are critical for signal transduction of several growth factors, their roles in amyloidoses are not yet fully understood. Herein, we found HS S-domains in the kidney of a patient with transthyretin amyloidosis. In in vitro assays with cells stably expressing human Sulfs, heparin, a structural analog of HS S-domains, promoted aggregation of transthyretin in an HS S-domain-dependent manner. Interactions of cells with transthyretin fibrils and cytotoxicity of these fibrils also depended on HS S-domains at the cell surface. Furthermore, glypican-5, encoded by the susceptibility gene for nephrotic syndrome GPC5, was found to be accumulated in the transthyretin amyloidosis kidney. Our study, thus, provides a novel insight into the pathologic roles of HS S-domains in amyloidoses, and we propose that enzymatic remodeling of HS chains by Sulfs may offer an effective approach to inhibiting formation and cytotoxicity of amyloid fibrils.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

The least follow-up time was 1 year. Medical documentations were in respect of patient's baseline characteristics, associated history, presence of comorbidities, follow-up time, and condition of wounds. Patients were divided into success group (healed or healing with wound reduction), stagnate group, and failure group (amputation or infection, need in-hospital medical service) in accordance with the treatment response of wounds. χ Test, Fisher exact test, and 1-way analysis of variance were used for variables in 3-group comparison, whereas Student t test was applied in 2-group comparison. The predictive factors with P value less than 0.1 were further investigated using the model of univariate logistic regression.With 3-group stratification according to treatment response-failure (n = 8), stagnate (n = 22), and success (n = 70)-the occurrence rate of retinopathy was higher in the treatment stagnate group (42.1%) than in the treatment failure (14.3%) and success groups (12.5%; P = 0.019); the rate of previous percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) history was higher in the treatment failure group (25%) than in the treatment stagnate (4.8%) and success groups (1.5%; P = 0.020). With 2-group stratification-failure (n = 8) versus nonfailure (n = 92), and success (n = 70) versus nonsuccess (n = 30)-PTA history was strongly associated with treatment failure (odds ratio [OR], 14.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.71-120.32; P = 0.014), whereas retinopathy (OR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.07-0.65; P = 0.006) was the major negative predictor for treatment success. Previous debridement met borderline significance to predict treatment nonsuccess (OR, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01-1.01; P = 0.051). Sex, age, associated history, dyslipidemia, hypertension, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular accident, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease and wound condition had no statistical significance.Previous PTA and retinopathy, which indicated preexisting severe vasculopathy, are univariate predictive factors for treatment failure and nonsuccess, respectively, in patients with King classification III DFU.

For this purpose, we evaluated Fibulin-3 (Fb-3) immunoexpression in human cases of MM related to FE exposure and its prognostic role. Immunohistochemical analysis of Fb-3 was carried out in eight MM patients resident in Biancavilla and the analysis showed evidence of environmental exposure to FE fibers. Six MM cases (3 epithelioid and 3 biphasic) showed a high immunoexpression of Fb-3 in neoplastic cells with nuclear and cytoplasmic localization. One epithelioid and one biphasic subtype did not show Fb-3 immunostaining.

This stratification is needed to customize the choice of hemodynamic support that is best adapted to the patient's level of risk, integrating the use of the least invasive procedures. The macro-circulatory hemodynamic approach aims to maintain a balance between oxygen supply (DO) and oxygen demand (VO). Volume replacement plays a crucial role based on the titration of fluid boluses according to their effect on measured stroke volume or indices of preload dependency. Good function of the microcirculatory system is the best guarantee to achieve this goal. An assessment of the DO/VO ratio is needed for guidance in critical situations where tissue hypoxia may occur. Overall, all of these strategies are based on objective criteria to guide vascular replacement and/or tissue oxygenation in order to improve the patient's post-operative course by decreasing morbidity and hospital stay.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Despite their ecological and biotechnological importance, studies related to microorganisms from this region are limited. Metagenomics leads to exciting discoveries, mainly regarding non-cultivable microorganisms. Herein, we report the discovery of a novel β-glucosidase (glycoside hydrolase family 1) gene from a metagenome from Lake Poraquê in the Amazon region. The gene encodes a protein of 52.9 kDa, named AmBgl-LP, which was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli and biochemically and structurally characterized. Although AmBgl-LP hydrolyzed the synthetic substrate p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (pNPβG) and the natural substrate cellobiose, it showed higher specificity for pNPβG (k/K = 6 s·mM) than cellobiose (k/K = 0.6 s·mM). AmBgl-LP showed maximum activity at 40 °C and pH 6.0 when pNPβG was used as the substrate. Glucose is a competitive inhibitor of AmBgl-LP, presenting a K of 14 mM. X-ray crystallography and Small Angle X-ray Scattering were used to determine the AmBgl-LP three-dimensional structure and its oligomeric state. Interestingly, despite sharing similar active site architecture with other structurally characterized GH1 family members which are monomeric, AmBgl-LP forms stable dimers in solution. The identification of new GH1 members by metagenomics might extend our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and diversity of these enzymes, besides enabling us to survey their industrial applications.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

To explore the underlying pathophysiology, we compared early changes in plasma cytokine concentrations between patients resuscitated with HES vs. Ringer's acetate.In a subgroup of 226 patients from the  trial, we calculated delta plasma concentrations of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 from randomization to day 2. We used multiple linear and logistic regression analyses to assess differences between the groups and associations between delta cytokine concentrations and 90-day mortality, respectively.Baseline characteristics and day 2 mortality were comparable between the groups. We observed similar delta cytokine concentrations in the HES vs. Ringer's group (mean difference in delta TNF-α: -1.5 pg/ml (95% CI, -4.9 to 1.9), P = 0.39; IL-6: 36.0 pg/ml (-24.1 to 96.1), P = 0.24; IL-10: -3.9 pg/ml (-21.1 to 28.9), P = 0.76). In all included patients, we observed a linear relationship between increases in TNF-α and 90-day mortality (P = 0.005).Resuscitation with HES 130/0.42 vs. Ringer's acetate did not appear to affect plasma concentrations of TNF-α, IL-6 or IL-10 differently during the first days after randomization into the  trial. In the overall cohort, increases in TNF-α were associated with increased 90-day mortality. Although interpretation should be done with caution, it seems unlikely that the increased mortality observed with the use HES in the  trial is signalled by early changes in three biomarkers of systemic inflammation.© 2017 The Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Foundation.

Compounds 6j, 6l, and 6d showed IC values of 1.23, 3.78, and 3.84 μM, respectively, against the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2). Most of the synthesized 2-thiouracils showed antiproliferative activity against the HepG2 cell line (hepatocellular carcinoma) in the micromolar range, for instance, 9b, 6l, 6m, 6n, and 6j displayed IC  = 7.92, 8.35, 8.51, 9.59, and 13.06 μM, respectively, relative to sorafenib (III; IC  = 10.99 μM). Also, compounds 6j, 9a, 6m, and  (IC  = 15.21, 16.96, 17.68, and 18.15 μM, respectively) are the most potent compounds against the UO-31 cell line. Further evaluation of the effect of the synthesized candidates on VEGFR-2 in the HepG2 cell line demonstrated that compounds 6j and 6l exhibit VEGFR-2 inhibitory activity of 87% and 84%, respectively, relative to sorafenib (III; 92%). In silico docking of the synthesized hits into the binding site of VEGFR-2 showed their ability to perform the main binding interactions with the key amino acids in the binding site. Studying the in silico predicted ADME (absorption, distribution, , and excretion) parameters for the synthesized thiouracils demonstrated that they have favorable pharmacokinetic and drug-likeness properties. These results demonstrate that the 2,4-disubstituted thiouracils 6 and 9 have not only favorable antiangiogenic and antiproliferative activity but also satisfy the criteria required for the development of orally bioavailable drugs. Consequently, they represent a biologically active scaffold that should be further optimized for future discovery of potential hits.© 2019 Deutsche Pharmazeutische Gesellschaft.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042590>Bioaccessibility of lipophilic and hydrophilic marine biotoxins in seafood: An in vitro digestion approach.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to assess the bioaccessibility of different marine biotoxins in naturally contaminated shellfish and fish gonads using an in vitro digestion methodology. In general, hydrophilic toxins (domoic acid, paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins and tetrodotoxins) showed higher bioaccessibility than lipophilic ones (okadaic acid and azaspiracids). The bioaccessibility of toxins from the okadaic acid group ranged from 69% (raw European razor clams) to 74% (raw donax clams). Regarding azaspiracids, 47% of the initial content was bioaccessible in steamed blue mussel. As for hydrophilic toxins, 100% of the initial content was bioaccessible after digestion in raw shellfish and puffer fish gonads. The total tetrodotoxin bioaccessibility in puffer fish gonads decreased significantly after steaming. The profile of tetrodotoxins changed during the digestion process: TTX and 11-norTTX--ol analogues decreased significantly after digestion, but the 5,6,11-trideoxy TTX analogue increased in both raw and steamed puffer fish gonads. These preliminary findings confirm the need to consider bioaccessibility data in future seafood risk assessment, as such information enables a more accurate and realistic estimation of potential seafood hazards, particularly in what concerns lipophilic toxins, therefore, constituting a crucial tool in the refinement of regulatory limits for the presence of biotoxins in seafood.Copyright © 2019.

APTT assay (polysaccharide fractions at 150 μg mL) showed clotting time of 45.6 s for F2 fraction. For polycarboxyl ulvans C1, C2, C3 and R-C3 the clotting times were 101.0, 122.2, 222.0 and 227.0 s, respectively. Comparison of the APTT assay results using ulvans chemically modified by carboxyl-reduction, desulfation, periodate oxidation and/or chlorite oxidation showed the anticoagulant activity of polycarboxyl ulvans is dependent of the sulfate groups present in the native polymer. In addition, the increase of the anticoagulant activity was accompanied by the increasing of the carboxyl groups and the content of this acidic substituent seems to be more important than its positioning.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to simulate the deposition distribution of both components of this drug within the airways based on realistic airflow measurements. Breathing parameters of 25 healthy adults (11 females and 14 males) were acquired while inhaling through Turbuhaler(®). Individual specific emitted doses and particle size distributions of Symbicort(®) Turbuhaler(®) were determined. A self-developed particle deposition model was adapted and validated to simulate the deposition of budesonide (inhaled corticosteroid; ICS) and formoterol (long acting β2 agonist; LABA) in the upper airways and lungs of the healthy volunteers. Based on current simulations the emitted doses varied between 50.4% and 92.5% of the metered dose for the ICS, and between 38% and 96.1% in case of LABA component depending on the individual inhalation flow rate. This variability induced a notable inter-individual spread of the deposited lung doses (mean: 33.6%, range: 20.4%-48.8% for budesonide and mean: 29.8%, range: 16.4%-42.9% for formoterol). Significant inter-gender differences were also observed. Average lung dose of budesonide was 29.2% of the metered dose for females and 37% for males, while formoterol deposited with 26.4% efficiency for females and 32.5% for males. Present results also highlighted the importance of breath-holding after inhalation of the drug. About a half of the total lung deposition occurred during breath-hold at 9. average breath-hold time. Calculated depositions confirmed appropriate lung deposition of Symbicort(®) Turbuhaler(®) for both genders, however more effort for optimal inhalation technique is advised for persons with low vital capacity. This study demonstrated the possibility of personalized prediction of airway deposition of aerosol drugs by numerical simulations. The methodology developed in this study will be applicable also to other marketed drugs in the future.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Uncertainties remain about the antigens implicated and their role in inducing rupture. Because antigens from the extracellular matrix (ECM) have been suspected, the aim of this experimental study was to characterize the role of adaptive immunity directed against antigens from the aortic ECM.In a first step, an experimental model of abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture based on adaptive immunity against the ECM was developed and characterized. Forty 4-week-old male Lewis rats were divided into two groups. In the ECM group (n = 20), rats were presensitized against the guinea pig aortic ECM before implantation of a decellularized aortic xenograft (DAX). In the control group (n = 20), rats were not presensitized before DAX implantation. In each group, half the rats were sacrificed at day 3 to analyze early mechanisms involved after DAX implantation. In a second step, we aimed to assess which ECM component was most efficient in inducing rupture. For this purpose, the nonfibrillar and fibrillar ECM components were sequentially extracted from the guinea pig aortic wall. Forty Lewis rats were then divided into four groups. Each group was presensitized against one ECM component (structural glycoproteins and proteoglycans, collagen, elastin alone, and elastin-associated glycoproteins) before DAX implantation. Apart from those that experienced rupture, rats were sacrificed at day 21. Xenografts were harvested for histologic, immunofluorescence, and conditioned medium analyses.In total, early aortic rupture occurred in 80% of the ECM group vs 0% of the control group (P < .001). In the ECM group, major circumferential immunoglobulin deposits were observed in combination with the C3 complement fraction, without cell infiltration. Conditioned medium analysis revealed that matrix metalloproteinase 9 and myeloperoxidase levels and elastase activities were significantly increased in this group. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that myeloperoxidase co-localized with tissue-free DNA and histone H4, highlighting local neutrophil activation and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps. Following differential presensitization, it appeared that rats presensitized against structural glycoproteins and proteoglycans were significantly more susceptible to rupture after DAX implantation.Stimulating adaptive immunity against the aortic ECM, especially structural glycoproteins and proteoglycans, triggers rupture after DAX implantation. Further studies are needed to assess the precise proteins involved.Copyright © 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc.

This study is to explore the prediction value of HBV-LP in different phase of HBV infection and during antiviral therapy in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients.A retrospective study was conducted in 2033 individuals, which included 1677 HBV infected patients in different phases and 356 healthy controls. HBV-LP, HBV serum markers and HBV DNA were detected by ELISA, CMIA and qRT-PCR, respectively. 85 CHB patients receiving PegIFNα or ETV were divided into virological response (VR) and partial virological response (PVR). The dynamic changes of HBV DNA and HBV-LP were observed.The level of HBV-LP in 2033 individuals was shown as: HBeAg-positive hepatitis > HBeAg-positive infection > HBeAg-negative hepatitis > HBeAg-negative infection > healthy controls. HBV-LP was positive in all patients whose HBV DNA > 1.0E + 06 IU/ml. When HBsAg was <0.05 IU/ml or >1000 IU/ml, HBV DNAs were all negative if HBV-LP < 1.0 S/CO. When HBsAg was between 0.05 IU/ml and 1000 IU/ml, the consistency of HBV-LP with HBV DNA was 100% in case of HBV-LP > 4.0 S/CO in HBeAg-positive patients and HBV-LP > 2.0 S/CO in HBeAg-negative ones. During antiviral therapy, baseline HBV-LP was lower in VR patients than that in PVR patients. The optimal cut-off points to predict VR by baseline HBV-LP were 32.4 and 28.6 S/CO for HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative hepatitis patients, respectively.HBV-LP may be a useful marker for distinguishing the different phases of HBV infection. Moreover, baseline HBV-LP level can be used for predicting VR of CHB patients.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the composition of GAGs present in bovine eye vitreous was characterized through disaccharide analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The interaction of GAGs with collagen type II was assessed using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The percentage of hyaluronic acid (HA), chondroitin sulfate (CS) and heparan sulfate (HS), of total GAG, were 96.2%, 3.5% and 0.3%, respectively. The disaccharide composition of CS consisted of 4S (49%), 0S (38%)  (12%), 2S6S (1.5%) and 2S4S (0.3%). The disaccharide composition of HS consisted of 0S (80%), NS2S (7%), NS (7%),  (4%), NS6S (2%), and TriS, 2S and 4S6S (each at 0.1%). The average molecular weights of CS and HS were 148 kDa and 204 kDa, respectively. SPR reveals that collagen type II binds to heparin (primarily composed of TriS) with a binding affinity (K ) of 755 nM and interacts with other GAGs, including CSB and CSE. Both bovine vitreous CS and HS interact with collagen type II, with vitreous HS showing a higher binding affinity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27255177>Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a novel series of peripheral-selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors-Part 2.</a></h2><p>Peripherally selective inhibition of noradrenaline reuptake is a novel mechanism for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence to overcome adverse effects associated with central action. Herein, we describe our medicinal chemistry approach to discover peripheral-selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors to avert the risk of P-gp-mediated DDI at the blood-brain barrier. We observed that steric shielding of the hydrogen-bond acceptors and donors (HBA and HBD) of compound 1 reduced the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) efflux ratio; however, the resulting compound 6, a methoxyacetamide derivative, was mainly metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 in the in vitro phenotyping study, implying the risk of PK variability based on the genetic polymorphism of the CYPs. Replacement of the hydrogen atom with a deuterium atom in a strategic, metabolically hot spot led to compound 13, which was mainly metabolized by CYP3A4. To our knowledge, this study represents the first report of the effect of deuterium replacement for a major  enzyme. The compound 13, N-{[(,7R)-7-(4-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-1,4-oxazepan-6-yl]methyl}-2-[(2H(3))methyloxy]acetamide hydrochloride, which exhibited peripheral NET selective inhibition at tested doses in rats, increased urethral resistance in a dose-dependent manner.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We sought to analyze the relationship between LVEDP and the incidence of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).Between January 2006 and December 2008, a total of 254 patients presenting with an acute coronary syndrome had the LVEDP assessed prior to the intervention. Contrast-induced AKI was defined as an increase in serum creatinine ≥25% from baseline or an absolute increase of >0.5 mg/dL from baseline. Patients were divided into three groups according to baseline LVEDP (<12 mmHg, 12-20 mmHg and > 20 mmHg). Baseline clinical, angiographic and procedural characteristics, as well as serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at baseline and at 24, 48 and 72 h were retrospectively collected.Baseline clinical characteristics were similar in all three groups with the exception of lower left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with elevated LVEDP (p = 0.02). Among the 17 patients with an LVEDP < 12 mmHg, only one (5.9%) developed AKI; among the 82 patients with an LVEDP = 12-20 mmHg, 15 (18.3%) developed AKI; and among the 155 patients with an LVEDP > 20 mmHg, only 22 developed AKI (13.6%). There was no correlation between LVEDP and the change in GFR at 24 h and at 48 h. Further comparison between the group of patients that developed contrast induced AKI versus those that did not, showed a that there was a significantly lower baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) among patients that developed contrast induced AKI compared to those that did not (41.4% vs. 48.3%, p = 0.045, respectively).In patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing PCI, baseline LVEDP was not associated with contrast-induced AKI. However patients with reduced ejection fraction seemed to be at a higher risk of developing AKI. More studies are needed to assess the relationship between LVEDP, LVEF and the risk of developing contrast induced AKI.Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Inc.</p></html>
