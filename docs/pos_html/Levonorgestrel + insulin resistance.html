<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9678138>Contraception guidance in women with pre-existing disturbances in carbohydrate metabolism.</a></h2><p>To review our studies on the clinical and metabolic impact of contraceptive methods in women with insulin dependent  (IDDM) and women with previous gestational  (GDM) in order to provide suggestions for the contraceptive counselling of these women.The clinical events following first insertions of copper IUDs were studied in 103 women with IDDM and in 119 non-diabetic women. Moreover we studied the effects on glycometabolic control and lipid metabolism in women with well-controlled IDDM using low-dose oral contraceptives (OCs) containing ethinylestradiol combined with norethisterone (n = 10),  (n = 9) or gestodene (n = 11). Hemostatic and endothelial function was also studied in the women using the gestodene-containing preparation. Finally, we studied the impact of oral contraceptives on the insulin sensitivity in women with previous GDM.The continuation rates and indications for medical removal of the IUDs were similar in the diabetic and the non-diabetic women. There was no increased pregnancy rate or increased frequency of pelvic inflammatory disease in the diabetic women. The glycemic control was not changed by the OCs and none of the treatment regimens were associated with changes in plasma lipids linked to increased risk of atherosclerosis. Indications of increased fibrin formation, which seemed to be compensated by increased fibrinolytic activity, were noted with the gestodene-containing preparation. None of the women developed microalbuminuria during the study. Compared to normal women, we found reduced insulin sensitivity in the women with previous GDM using the pill.Intrauterine devices and barrier methods can be used by diabetic women with the same reservations as in the general population. Low-dose OCs do not influence the glycemic control and have no adverse impact on plasma lipids. The balance between fibrin formation and resolution was maintained during intake of the gestodene-containing pill. Our findings suggest that combined oral contraceptives can be used in women with uncomplicated IDDM and in women with previous GDM if clinical and metabolic monitoring can be ensured.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28349880>Anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic effects of nicotine exposure in oral contraceptive-induced  are glucocorticoid-independent.</a></h2><p>Reports showed that estrogen-progestin oral contraceptive (COC) or tobacco smoking causes increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in premenopausal women. Studies also suggest that nicotine, a major tobacco alkaloid, may worsen or improve atherothrombotic CVD. Altered hemorheology, prothrombotic and pro-inflammatory biomarkers, have been implicated in the development of atherothrombotic CVD events. However, the effect of non-smoking nicotine exposure on these biomarkers during COC treatment is not yet established. We therefore sought to determine the effects of nicotine exposure during COC treatment on these biomarkers, and also tested the hypothesis that the nicotine effects would be glucocorticoid-dependent.Female Sprague-Dawley rats aged 10 weeks were given (po) vehicle, low-dose nicotine (0.1mg/kg) or high-dose nicotine (1.0mg/kg) with or without COC steroids (5.0μg/kg ethinylestradiol and 25.0μg/kg ) daily for 6 weeks.COC treatment or nicotine exposure led to increased  (IR), hemorheological (blood viscosity, hematocrit and plasma viscosity), prothrombotic (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1), pro-inflammatory (uric acid, C-reactive protein, neutrophil/lymphocyte and platelet/lymphocyte ratios) biomarkers and corticosterone. However, these effects except that on corticosterone were abrogated by nicotine exposure during COC treatment.Our study indicates that nicotine- or COC-induced IR may be mediated via inflammatory/thrombotic pathway. The results imply that nicotine exposure could impact negatively on atherothrombotic biomarkers in COC non-users, whereas the impact in COC users could be positive. The results also suggest that the anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic and blood viscosity-lowering effects of nicotine exposure during COC use is circulating glucocorticoid-independent.Copyright © 2016.

Subjects included 925 women using fixed-dose (monophasic) or variable-dose (triphasic) formulations and 418 premenopausal women not using OCs. The monophasics contained 150 or 250 micrograms of , 500 or 1,000 micrograms of norethindrone or 150 micrograms of desogestrel as the progestin. Triphasic progestin doses were 50-125 micrograms of  or 500-1,000 micrograms of norethindrone. All the formulations increased the fasting serum triglycerides. No changes were seen in serum total cholesterol. The effects on serum lipoproteins depended on the progestin type and dose. Monophasics containing 500 micrograms of norethindrone or 150 micrograms of desogestrel lowered low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and increased high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Monophasics containing  reduced HDL cholesterol. The triphasics did not affect LDL or HDL cholesterol but altered the balance of HDL subfractions. All the formulations caused a deterioration in glucose tolerance and  and increased pancreatic  secretion. The greatest effects were seen with formulations containing . The study showed that a reduction in the progestin dose and use of novel progestins can reduce the potentially adverse effects of OCs on metabolic risk markers for coronary heart disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29522176>Treatment Options for Hirsutism: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis.</a></h2><p>Several pharmacologic treatments for hirsutism are used in practice; however, their relative efficacy is unclear.We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL through January 2017 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with follow-up of at least 6 months that evaluated antiandrogens,  sensitizers, and oral contraceptives in women with hirsutism. Independent pairs of reviewers selected and appraised trials. Random-effects network meta-analysis was used to compare individual drugs and classes.We included 43 trials. Estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives pills (OCPs), antiandrogens, and  sensitizers were superior to placebo, with standardized mean reductions (95% confidence intervals) of -0.94 (-1.49 to -0.38), -1.29 (-1.80 to -0.79), and -0.62 (-1.00 to -0.23), respectively. Antiandrogen monotherapy, the combination of OCP and antiandrogen, the combination of OCPs and  sensitizer, and the combination of antiandrogen and  sensitizer were superior to  sensitizer monotherapy. The combination of OCPs and antiandrogen was superior to OCPs. Antiandrogen monotherapy with flutamide, finasteride, and spironolactone were each superior to placebo but similar to each other in efficacy. OCPs containing , cyproterone acetate, or drospirenone were similar in effectiveness to other OCPs or had trivial differences. The certainty in comparisons with placebo was moderate and for head-to-head comparisons was low.Estrogen-progestin OCPs, antiandrogens, and  sensitizers are superior to placebo for the treatment of hirsutism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10376866> sensitivity during postmenopausal hormone replacement with transdermal estradiol and intrauterine .</a></h2><p>The study was devised to measure the effect of intrauterinely delivered  and transdermal estradiol on  sensitivity in postmenopausal women and compare this effect with that induced by transdermal estradiol alone.An open, prospective, comparative study of healthy postmenopausal women without earlier use of hormone replacement therapy. The estrogen therapy group consisted of eight hysterectomized women, who used a transdermal patch delivering a daily dose of 50 microg of estradiol continuously for 6 months. The estrogen-progestin therapy group consisted of 13 women with an intact uterus, who received a simultaneous combination of a transdermal patch and a  (20 microg/day) intrauterine system for the same length of time. Fasting plasma concentrations of glucose,  and C-peptide and an  tolerance test were used to measure glucose metabolism and  sensitivity.Neither therapy changed the fasting plasma levels of glucose,  or C-peptide. Transdermal estrogen improved  sensitivity by 22%, as measured by an  tolerance test, while a small increase of 3.6% was observed using the combination therapy.Transdermal estradiol improves  sensitivity in healthy postmenopausal women. Combining intrauterine  to transdermal estradiol reverses this effect.

Contrasting effects of nicotine exposure on endothelial function have been reported. The effect of non-smoking nicotine exposure on endothelial dysfunction during COC treatment remains to be fully elucidated. We therefore, sought to determine the effects of nicotine exposure during COC treatment on endothelial dysfunction mediators and circulating corticosteroids. Female Wistar rats aged 10 weeks were given (po) vehicle, nicotine (1.0 mg/kg) with or without COC steroids (1.0 µg ethinylestradiol and 5.0 µg ) daily for 6 weeks. Nicotine exposure caused 113.3% increase in insulinemia whereas COC treatment led to 76.9% increased insulinemia compared with control. Furthermore, COC treatment or nicotine exposure led to glucose deregulation, , reduced nitric oxide bioavailability, elevated plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, uric acid, oxidative stress, atherogenic dyslipidemia, and corticosteroids. However, COC + NIC treatment led to 41.2% decrease in insulemina compared with COC-treated rats. Furthermore, all other alterations were alleviated by nicotine exposure in COC-treated female rats with the exception of corticosteroids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30276420>Oral ethinylestradiol- attenuates cardiac glycogen and triglyceride accumulation in high fructose female rats by suppressing pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4.</a></h2><p>Fructose (FRU) intake has increased dramatically in recent decades with a corresponding increased incidence of  (IR), particularly in young adults. The use of oral ethinylestradiol- (EEL) formulation is also common among young women worldwide. The present study aimed at determining the effect of EEL on high fructose-induced cardiac triglyceride (TG) and glycogen accumulation. The study also investigated the possible involvement of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK-4) in EEL and/or high fructose metabolic effects on the heart. Ten-week-old female Wistar rats were allotted into four groups. The control, EEL, FRU, and EEL + FRU rats received distilled water (vehicle, p.o.), 1.0 μg ethinylestradiol plus 5.0 μg  (p.o.), 10% fructose (w/v), and 1.0 μg ethinylestradiol plus 5.0 μg  and 10% fructose, respectively, daily for 8 weeks. Data showed that EEL or high fructose caused IR' impaired glucose tolerance' hyperlipidemia' increased plasma lactate, lactate dehydrogenase, PDK-4, uric acid, xanthine oxidase (XO), adenosine deaminase (ADA), malondialdehyde (MDA), cardiac uric acid, TG, TG/HDL- cholesterol, glycogen synthesis, MDA, and visceral fat content and reduced glutathione. High fructose also resulted in impaired pancreatic β-cell function, hyperglycemia, and increased cardiac PDK-4, lactate synthesis, and mass. Nonetheless, these alterations were ameliorated in EEL plus high fructose rats. This study demonstrates that high fructose-induced myocardial TG and glycogen accumulation is attributable to increased PDK-4. Besides, EEL could be a useful pharmacological utility for protection against cardiac dysmetabolism by inhibiting PDK-4.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29400073>Oral hormonal therapy with ethinylestradiol- improves , obesity, and glycogen synthase kinase-3 independent of circulating mineralocorticoid in estrogen-deficient rats.</a></h2><p>Estrogen deficiency has been associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular diseases , and recent clinical trials of standard formulations of hormonal therapies have not demonstrated consistent beneficial effects. Estrogen-progestin therapy has been used as exogenous estrogen to normalize depressed estrogen level during menopause. Ovariectomized rodents mimic an estrogen-deficient state in that they develop cardiometabolic dysfunction, including  (IR). We therefore hypothesized that hormonal therapy with combined oral contraceptive steroids, ethinylestradiol- (EEL), improves IR, obesity, and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) through reduction of circulating mineralocorticoid in ovariectomized rats. Twelve-week-old female Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups: sham-operated (SHM) and ovariectomized (OVX) rats were treated with or without EEL (1.0 μg ethinylestradiol and 5.0 μg ) daily for 8 weeks. Results showed that OVX or SHM + EEL treated rats had increased HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment of IR), 1 h postload glucose, HOMA-β, triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), TC/HDL cholesterol, TG/HDL cholesterol, plasma , GSK-3, corticosterone, and aldosterone. On the other hand, OVX + EEL treatment ameliorated all these effects except that of aldosterone. Taken together, the results demonstrate that oral hormonal replacement with EEL improves IR and pancreatic β-cell function and suppresses GSK-3 and glucocorticoid independent of circulating aldosterone, suggesting a positive cardiometabolic effect of oral EEL therapy in estrogen-deficient rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12502684>Effects of injectable or implantable progestin-only contraceptives on -glucose metabolism and diabetes risk.</a></h2><p>Progestin-only contraceptives administered by injection (Depo-Provera) or subcutaneous implant (Norplant) have been available to U.S. women for about a decade. Two epidemiological studies found their use associated with increased incidence of type 2 diabetes. In reviewing publications relating progestin injections and implants to glucose metabolism, 25 studies of various study designs and laboratory methods were identified that reported at least one  value in nondiabetic women. Research subjects were usually nonobese and often from developing countries. Of eight studies that performed sequential oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) after at least 6 months of Depo-Provera or Norplant use, seven found significant elevations (approximate doubling) of  at 2 or 3 h after glucose challenge; the effects on fasting, half-hour, or 1-h postchallenge  values were less consistent. The three studies that performed sequential intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTTs) on injection users all found an increased early-phase  response. One study used sequential hyperglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps to demonstrate reduced total-body glucose uptake per unit of  after 8 weeks of Norplant use. The metabolic studies generally did not show a reduction in the glucose tolerance of their nondiabetic subjects. However, compared with the lean and low-risk women who were usually selected for metabolic research, many U.S. women receiving these injections or implants may start out with increased  due to greater weight, sedentary lifestyle, and family or childbearing histories. Additional research could help clarify whether exposure to injectable or implantable contraceptives leads to increased risk of type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes in women with predisposing factors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8222475>Contraception in the diabetic woman.</a></h2><p>Contraceptive prescription in women with current , type I or II, and in women with previous gestational  must be highly effective and take into account the metabolic effects and risks particular to . This article concentrates on reversible, nonbarrier methods including oral contraceptives, long-acting progestins, and intrauterine devices with the goal of enabling the practitioner to develop individually tailored contraceptive therapy for these women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3279064>Prospective studies of  sensitivity in normal women receiving oral contraceptive agents.</a></h2><p>Seven normal premenopausal women were studied before (control) and after 3 and 6 months of oral contraceptive agent (OCA) administration (30 micrograms ethinyl estradiol plus 150 micrograms ). The plasma glucose responses during 75-g oral glucose tolerance tests were not altered by the OCA, but the 3- and 6-month plasma  responses significantly exceeded control values (P less than 0.05). On a separate morning a constant iv infusion of [3H]3-glucose was given throughout a 2-h basal period and during two successive 2-h euglycemic clamp procedures at iv  delivery rates of 10 and 40 mU/m2.min, respectively. Endogenous glucose production rates (milligrams per kg/min) were not altered after 3 or 6 months of OCA administration. Peripheral glucose utilization rates were expressed as M (milligrams per kg/min) or the ratio of M over the prevailing plasma  concentration (M/I). One or both parameters were significantly reduced below control values at both  infusion rates after 3 months (P less than 0.05), but returned toward control values after 6 months. Serum androgen concentrations were reduced or not altered by OCA administration. We conclude that  induced by OCA administration is manifested by reduced peripheral tissue  sensitivity and may ameliorate with time. This effect does not relate consistently to total plasma  responses during oral glucose tolerance tests or to elevated serum androgen concentrations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26855320>Improvement of oral contraceptive-induced glucose dysregulation and dyslipidemia by valproic acid is independent of circulating corticosterone.</a></h2><p>Cardiometabolic disorders are rapidly becoming major public health challenges. Valproic acid (VPA) is a widely prescribed anticonvulsant drug.We hypothesized that treatment with VPA would improve the regulation of glucose and atherogenic dyslipidemia through reduction in circulating corticosterone.Female Wistar rats recieved (p.o.) combined oral contraceptive (COC) containing 1.0 µg ethinylestradiol plus 5.0 µg  and valproic acid (VPA; 20 mg) for 8 weeks.Treatment with COC led to elevated fasting blood glucose, , corticosterone, triglycerides (TG), TG/HDL-cholesterol ratio,  (IR) and impaired glucose tolerance. VPA significantly attenuated the alterations induced by COC treatment, but did not affect the corticosterone level. However, VPA treatment led to significant increases in plasma , corticosterone, atherogenic lipids and impaired glucose tolerance in rats not treated with COC.The findings in this study suggest that VPA mitigates against the development of COC-induced  and dyslipidemia independent of elevated circulating corticosterone.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1530790>, secretion, and metabolism in users of oral contraceptives.</a></h2><p>Studies of  employing the oral glucose tolerance test demonstrate marked differences between the effects of different oral contraceptives, but provide little insight into the underlying disturbances.

Four estrogen/progestin combinations, with similar estrogen but differing progestin contents, and 1 progestin-only formulation were studied. Effects on iv glucose tolerance test glucose, , and C-peptide concentrations varied according to progestin content, with -containing combinations having the greatest effect, followed by desogestrel and norethindrone. However, these formulations increased  to a similar extent. The progestin-only formulation did not affect .  combinations increased second phase pancreatic  secretion by 60-90%, but did not affect the  half-life. The desogestrel combination increased the  half-life by 28%, but did not affect  secretion. The effects of different combined oral contraceptives on glucose tolerance test glucose, , and C-peptide concentration profiles appears to be due to a combination of estrogen-induced  and progestin-associated changes in  half-life.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8447358>Effects of desogestrel on carbohydrate metabolism.</a></h2><p>Associated with progesterone and the synthetic progestins used in oral contraceptives is a dose-dependent impairment of carbohydrate metabolism. It is well known that in the general population hyperinsulinemia and alterations in glucose metabolism are significant risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease.

Background information on NIDDM is given, including pathogenesis, effect on glucose and lipid metabolism, and management. The effect of exogenous estrogen and progestogens on glucose tolerance is briefly discussed. In reviewing the effects of Norplant on glucose metabolism, studies on women with normal glucose tolerance were reviewed, along with the one study of Norplant use in women with a past history of gestational . Norplant does have a minor effect on glucose metabolism. Studies are contradictory regarding lipid metabolism but most suggest that Norplant does not have a negative effect on the high density lipoprotein/total cholesterol ratio. Factors influencing contraceptive choice are reviewed. Protocols for management of Norplant in women with or at-risk for NIDDM are then presented, followed by a case study and a brief discussion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3332954>[Sex hormones and the metabolism of carbohydrates].</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30964093>Effect of six-month use of oral contraceptive pills on plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 & factor VIII among women with polycystic ovary syndrome: An observational pilot study.</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrinopathy warranting lifelong individualized management by lifestyle and pharmacological agents mainly oral contraceptive pills (OCPs). This study was aimed to report the impact of six-month OCP use on plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and factor VIII (FVIII) in women with PCOS.PCOS women diagnosed on the basis of Rotterdam 2003 criteria, either treated with OCPs (ethinyl estradiol-0.03 mg, -0.15 mg) for a period of six months (n=40) or drug-naïve (n=42), were enrolled in this study. Blood was drawn to estimate glucose,  levels and lipid profile. Chemiluminescence immunoassays were used to measure hormones (LH, FSH, PRL, T). Plasma levels of PAI-I and FVIII were measured by commercially available kits.Menstrual regularity, Ferriman-Gallwey score and serum total testosterone significantly improved in the OCP group compared to drug-naïve group (P<0.01). No significant difference was observed in PAI-1 levels of the two groups; however, significant decrease in FVIII levels was observed in OCP group as compared to drug-naïve group.

Soluble dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (sDPP-4) and adenosine deaminase (ADA) are involved in the initiation and/or progression of cardiometabolic disorders. We therefore, hypothesized that increased DPP-4 and ADA activities are involved in glucose deregulation and hepatic triglyceride accumulation induced by COC treatment. This study also investigated whether short-chain fatty acid, acetate, would protect against COC-induced dysmetabolic effects. Female Wistar rats received (p.o.) vehicle and COC (1.0 μg ethinylestradiol plus 5.0 μg ) with or without sodium acetate (ACE; 200 mg) for 8 weeks. Treatment with COC led to increased plasma triglyceride-glucose index, 1-h postload glucose response, , free fatty acid, , and impaired glucose tolerance. COC treatment also resulted in increased plasma and hepatic triglycerides (TG), TG/HDL-cholesterol ratio, malondialdehyde, uric acid, lactate dehydrogenase, DPP-4, ADA, and xanthine oxidase (XO) activities. On the other hand, COC led to reduction in nitric oxide level. However, ACE significantly ameliorated the alterations induced by COC treatment, but XO activity remains elevated during COC treatment. This result also demonstrates that increased DPP-4 and ADA activities are at least in part involved in glucose deregulation and hepatic TG accumulation induced by COC treatment. Therefore, sodium acetate would impact positively on cardiometabolic disorders, at least in part, by inhibition of DPP-4 and ADA activities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30557836>Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibition protects the liver of -resistant female rats against triglyceride accumulation by suppressing uric acid.</a></h2><p>Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibition has been shown to exert beneficial effects against  (IR) and type 2 diabetes. Combined oral contraceptive (COC) treatment is associated with impaired glucose and lipid metabolism but the mechanisms are elusive. We therefore, hypothesized that DPP-4 inhibition ameliorates COC-induced glucose dysregulation and hepatic triglyceride (TG) accumulation through adenosine deaminase (ADA) /xanthine oxidase (XO) /uric acid-dependent pathway. Female Wistar rats received (po) vehicle and COC (1.0 μg ethinylestradiol plus 5.0 μg ; po) with or without DPP-4 inhibitor (sitagliptin; 100 mg/kg; po) for 8 weeks (n = 6/group). Glucose dysmetabolism was assessed by elevated fasting blood glucose, impaired oral glucose tolerance test and homeostatic model assessment of IR. Treatment with COC led to increased plasma fasting glucose, triglyceride-glucose index, 1-h postload glucose response, , free fatty acid, IR and impaired glucose tolerance. COC treatment also resulted in increased plasma and hepatic TG, TG/HDL-cholesterol ratio, malondialdehyde, uric acid (plasma; 25.2 ± 0.6 mg/dl; hepatic 128.9 ± 8.0 mg/100 mg tissue), lactate dehydrogenase, DPP-4, ADA and XO (plasma;10.5 ± 1.1 U/L; hepatic 21.2 ± 1.4 U/g protein) activities. Likewise, COC led to reduction in nitric oxide level. However, DPP-4 inhibition significantly ameliorated these alterations induced by COC treatment through suppression of uric acid (plasma; 15.1 ± 1.0 mg/dl, hepatic; 75.6 ± 5.0 mg/100 mg tissue), XO (plasma; 4.1 ± 0.9 U/L, hepatic; 8.7 ± 0.4 U/g protein), ADA and DPP-4 activities suggesting their involvement in glucose dysregulation and hepatic TG accumulation induced by COC treatment.

At baseline, 3 months and 6 months, homeostasis model assessment  resistant (HOMA-IR) score,  sensitivity (HOMA-%S) and β-cell function (HOMA-%B) were calculated based on fasting  and glucose values. In addition, components of metabolic syndrome [fasting glucose (FG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, abdominal circumference] were measured. Twenty-four subjects total (8 in each arm) were needed to detect a 1.0 difference in HOMA-IR with 80% power and a two-sided alpha of 0.05.We present data on eight NHC, eight ENG-I and nine  intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) users. FG increased, and  sensitivity decreased over time among ENG-I users to a greater extent than among LNG-IUS users when compared to women using a nonhormonal method [FG change over 6 months=9.4mg/dL, 4.6mg/dL and -2.1mg/dL, respectively; p=.01); (HOMA-%S change over 6 months=-29.9%, -14.8% and 19.3%, respectively; p=.02)], while β-cell function and  did not change significantly (p>.05).While changes in FG and  sensitivity were seen in the present study among obese progestin-only contraceptive users, either progestin-only LARC method may be safely used clinically.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Based on lack of change in intermediate markers, as well as results of epidemiologic studies, low-dose OCs do not increase the risk of diabetes or cardiovascular disease. Obesity is a risk factor for impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes and coronary artery disease, and most previous OC studies excluded these women; thus, we have limited information about carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in obese OC users.This study compared changes in carbohydrate and lipid parameters in 71 normal-weight and 38 obese women initiating the OC. Women were randomized to two pills: 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol (EE)/150 mcg  (LNG) or 20 mcg EE/100 mcg LNG. Participants underwent baseline and cycle-3 measurements of fasting serum glucose; ; triglycerides and total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.Normal-weight and obese participants experienced similar changes in mean glucose,  and log homeostatic model assessment, as well as similar changes in total cholesterol, HDL and triglycerides; however, change in mean LDL (-4.9±20.6 mg/dL vs. +3.8±17.3 mg/dL) was different between the obese and normal-weight groups, respectively. Among the obese participants, change in glucose was marginally greater with the higher dose pill (p=.06); otherwise, changes between the body mass index groups were not modified by pill dose.Obesity had little effect on any OC-induced changes in carbohydrate or lipid metabolism except for a borderline adverse interaction between obesity and OC dose with respect to fasting glucose and a positive interaction between obesity and OC use with respect to LDL cholesterol.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), is the usual first choice of treatment in women with PCOS. Because OCP use has been linked to the risk of venous thrombosis and there are limited data on the effect of OCP use on the inflammatory state of women with PCOS, our objective was to compare the levels of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 between drug-naive and OCP-treated women with PCOS. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, INTERVENTIONS, AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Consequent to women diagnosed with PCOS on the basis of Rotterdam 2003 criteria, either treated with OCPs (ethinylestradiol 0.03 mg, levonogestrel-0.15 mg) for a period of 6 months (n = 50) or drug-naive (n = 51) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study.The mean ages of patients and control participants were comparable (21.99 ± 4.78 vs 21.92 ± 5.83 years; P = .947) as was body mass index (24.47 ± 3.92 vs 23.66 ± 3.43; P = .271). Clinical and androgen excess symptoms were significantly better in the OCP group compared with the drug-naive group (P = .01, P = .04). Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly higher in the OCP group (P = .01). Plasma ICAM-1 levels, TNF-α levels, and MCP-1 levels showed a higher trend in patients but reached statistical significance only in cases of ICAM-1 and TNF-α (P = .01).OCP treatment of 6 months increases plasma ICAM-1, MCP-1, and TNF-α levels among women with PCOS, although OCPs significantly help in ameliorating features of hyperandrogenism and regularizing menstrual cycles. These cytokines correlate positively with many metabolic parameters including plasma glucose, lipids, and homeostatic model assessment-. Further investigation with well designed, randomized, longitudinal studies might help to ascertain the effect of OCPs on proinflammatory profiles among women with PCOS.Copyright © 2016 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology.

From an epidemiologic viewpoint, the atherogenic impact of new low-dose OCs is less marked, including in users over 40 years of age, but thromboembolic effects still persist--though at a lower level than with standard-dose products. From a metabolic viewpoint, the adverse effects of the progestogens contained in current OCs on the lipoprotein profile and their atherogenic effect on the vessel wall seem effectively counterbalanced by the estrogen content of these new OCs. However, the progestin content seems still responsible for a low level of chronic , which might be related to vascular alterations potentially linked to syndrome-X. In conclusion, reduced metabolic effects of new low-dose OCs appear to decrease their atherogenic risk. However, thrombotic effects dose-related to the estrogen component of OCs are still persisting and seem less easily suppressible.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20695771>Hormonal contraception in women with the metabolic syndrome: a narrative review.</a></h2><p>The metabolic syndrome (MS) is a set of five cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors: elevated waist circumference, fasting plasma glucose, triglycerides and blood pressure; and reduced HDL-cholesterol. The prevalence of the MS is rising worldwide, and is linked to two diagnoses in young women: polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).This narrative review focuses on hormonal contraceptive choices available for women in Europe with features of the MS.The -intrauterine system and progestogen-only pills containing desogestrel or  have no significant effects on MS parameters. Combined oestrogen-progestogen methods do not appear to increase waist circumference or the incidence of glucose intolerance in women with PCOS or a history of GDM; their effect on HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides is comparable with that observed in women without the MS, while the effect on blood pressure remains inconclusive. The etonogestrel implant does not affect body weight, triglycerides and blood pressure but mildly reduces  sensitivity and HDL-cholesterol in healthy women. Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate increases body weight and truncal fat deposition, and lowers glucose tolerance in women with previous GDM.Low-dose hormonal contraception is safe for many women with the MS, but high-dose progestogens must be avoided.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18533124>Comparison of metabolic and inflammatory outcomes in women who used oral contraceptives and the -releasing intrauterine device in a general population.</a></h2><p>We compared the metabolic and cardiovascular parameters of a reference group of women with those of women who used 2 contraceptive regimes that are used worldwide: the -releasing intrauterine device and oral contraceptives.We investigated a cohort of 2814 women at age 31 years from the general population-based Northern Finland Birth Cohort who were born in 1966. Women were classified as oral contraceptive users (n = 687 women), -releasing intrauterine device users (n = 168 women), or no use of hormonal contraception (reference group; n = 1959 women). The analyses were adjusted for body mass index, current alcohol use, household income, and area of residence.Compared with the reference group, oral contraceptive users had higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, raised levels of inflammatory indices (C-reactive protein), and impaired  sensitivity. -releasing intrauterine device users displayed a lower high-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol, but a similar cholesterol/ high-density lipoprotein ratio, and higher leukocyte count compared with the reference group. Oral contraception users were -resistant compared with -releasing intrauterine device users with higher blood pressure, raised lipid levels (such as total cholesterol and triglycerides) and  levels, and lower homeostasis model assessment and  sensitivity, despite smaller waist and lower waist-hip ratio.Oral contraception usage was associated with adverse findings in several metabolic, cardiovascular, and inflammatory parameters, which is consistent with an increased future risk of cardiovascular and metabolic disease. These findings should invite more criticism of recent trends that encourage the prescription of oral contraceptives for years during reproductive life and especially in premenopausal women. In contrast, -releasing intrauterine device or progestin-only pills may offer long-term health benefits over oral contraceptives and should be preferred to oral contraceptives for women in their forties and/or with metabolic risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22513937>Steroidal contraceptives: effect on carbohydrate metabolism in women without diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p>Many hormonal contraceptives have been associated with changes in carbohydrate metabolism. Alterations may include decreased glucose tolerance and increased , which are risk factors for Type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. These issues have been raised primarily with contraceptives containing estrogen.To evaluate the effect of hormonal contraceptives on carbohydrate metabolism in healthy women and those at risk for diabetes due to overweight.In February 2012, we searched the computerized databases MEDLINE, POPLINE, CENTRAL, and LILACS for studies of hormonal contraceptives and carbohydrate metabolism. We also searched for clinical trials in ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP. Previous searches also included EMBASE.All randomized controlled trials were considered if they examined carbohydrate metabolism in women without diabetes who used hormonal contraceptives for contraception. Comparisons could be a placebo, a non-hormonal contraceptive, or another hormonal contraceptive that differed in drug, dosage, or regimen. Interventions included at least three cycles. Outcomes included glucose and  measures.We assessed all titles and abstracts identified during the literature searches. The data were extracted and entered into RevMan. We wrote to researchers for missing data. For continuous variables, the mean difference (MD) was computed with 95% confidence interval (CI) using a fixed-effect model. For dichotomous outcomes, the Peto odds ratio with 95% CI was calculated.We found 31 trials that met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-one trials compared combined oral contraceptives (COCs); others examined different COC regimens, progestin-only pills, injectables, a vaginal ring, and implants. None included a placebo. Of 34 comparisons, eight had any notable difference between the study groups in an outcome.Twelve trials studied desogestrel-containing COCs, and the few differences from  COCs were inconsistent. A meta-analysis of two studies showed the desogestrel group had a higher mean fasting glucose (MD 0.20; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.41). Where data could not be combined, single studies showed lower mean fasting glucose (MD -0.40; 95% CI -0.72 to -0.08) and higher means for two-hour glucose response (MD 1.08; 95% CI 0.45 to 1.71) and  area under the curve (AUC) (MD 20.30; 95% CI 4.24 to 36.36).Three trials examined the etonogestrel vaginal ring and one examined an etonogestrel implant. One trial showed the ring group had lower mean AUC  than the -COC group (MD -204.51; 95% CI -389.64 to -19.38).Of eight trials of norethisterone preparations, five compared COCs and three compared injectables. In a COC trial, a norethisterone group had smaller mean change in glucose two-hour response than a -COC group (MD -0.30; 95% CI -0.54 to -0.06). In an injectable study, a group using depot medroxyprogesterone acetate had higher means than the group using norethisterone enanthate for fasting glucose (MD 10.05; 95% CI 3.16 to 16.94), glucose two-hour response (MD 17.00; 95% CI 5.67 to 28.33), and fasting  (MD 3.40; 95% CI 2.07 to 4.73).Among five recent trials, two examined newer COCs with different estrogen types. One showed the group with nomegestrel acetate plus 17β-estradiol had lower means than the  group for incremental AUC glucose (MD -1.43; 95% CI -2.55 to -0.31) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (MD -0.10; 95% CI -0.18 to -0.02). Two trials compared extended versus conventional (cyclic) regimens. With a dienogest COC, an extended-use group had greater mean change in AUC glucose (MD 82.00; 95% CI 10.72 to 153.28). In a small trial using two  COCs, the lower-dose group showed smaller mean change in fasting glucose (MD -3.00; 95% CI -5.89 to -0.11), but the obese and normal weight women did not differ significantly.Current evidence suggests no major differences in carbohydrate metabolism between different hormonal contraceptives in women without diabetes. We cannot make strong statements due to having few studies that compared the same types of contraceptives. Many trials had small numbers of participants and some had large losses. Many of the earlier studies had limited reporting of methods.We still know very little about women at risk for metabolic problems due to being overweight. More than half of the trials had weight restrictions as inclusion criteria. Only one small trial stratified the groups by body mass index (obese versus normal).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28376377>Combined oral contraceptive and nitric oxide synthesis inhibition synergistically causes cardiac hypertrophy and exacerbates  in female rats.</a></h2><p>Combined oral contraceptive (COC) use or inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis has been shown to cause hypertension and . However, the concomitant effects of COC and NO deficiency on the heart and glucose regulation are not well known. We therefore hypothesized that COC treatment during NO deficiency would lead to the development of cardiac hypertrophy that is associated with aggravated glucose deregulation, pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic biomarkers. Eight-week-old female Wistar rats were randomly allotted into control, NO deficient (N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester: L-NAME; 20.0mg/kg b.w.), COC-treated (1.0μg ethinylestradiol+5.0μg , p.o) and L-NAME+COC-treated groups. The animals were treated daily for 6 weeks. Systolic blood pressure was estimated by tail-cuff plethysmography,  (IR) and β-cell function were estimated by homeostatic model of assessment (HOMA-IR and HOMA-β). Pro-inflammatory (C-reactive protein; CRP and uric acid) and pro-fibrotic (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; PAI-1) biomarkers were estimated in the plasma. Cardiac histological examination was also done. Results show that COC or L-NAME treatments led to increased blood pressure, HOMA-IR, impaired β-cell function, PAI-1, CRP and uric acid, without significant effect on cardiac mass. L-NAME+COC-treated group had significantly higher blood pressure, HOMA-IR, impaired β-cell function, PAI-1, CRP and cardiac mass than COC- or L-NAME-treated groups. Histological examination validated that COC use during NO deficiency causes cardiac hypertrophy. The present study demonstrates that COC treatment and NO deficiency synergistically causes cardiac hypertrophy that is associated with aggravated glucose deregulation, atherogenic dyslipidemia, pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic markers.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We studied 61 untreated symptomatic postmenopausal women randomized to receive oral (conjugated equine estrogens, 0.625 mg/d continuous + , 0.075 mg/d for 12 days of each 28-day cycle) or transdermal therapy (estradiol 17 beta, 0.05 mg/d continuous + norethindrone acetate, 0.25 mg/d for 14 days of each 28-day cycle). An untreated control group of 30 postmenopausal women not seeking HRT was also studied. Intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTT) were performed at baseline and 3, 6, and 18 months later. Mathematical modeling analysis of plasma glucose, insulin, and C-peptide concentration profiles provided measures of insulin resistance, secretion, and elimination. There were no changes in glucose or insulin concentrations with transdermal therapy. Oral therapy caused a deterioration of glucose tolerance and an increased overall plasma insulin response, apparently due to a reduction in the immediate plasma insulin response to glucose. This may have resulted from increased hepatic insulin uptake, uncompensated for by an increase in first-phase pancreatic insulin secretion. Neither treatment caused significant insulin resistance compared with baseline, but with the oral treatment insulin resistance was greater during the combined phase compared with the estrogen-only phase. Thus the oral regimen affected both insulin delivery and insulin resistance. The transdermal regimen had relatively few effects on insulin metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17327307>Effects of medical therapy on  and the cardiovascular system in polycystic ovary syndrome.</a></h2><p>We aimed to determine the impact of medical therapy for symptom management on , metabolic profiles, and surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), an -resistant pre-diabetes condition.One hundred overweight women (BMI >27 kg/m2), average age 31 years, who were nonsmokers, were not pregnant, did not have diabetes, and were off relevant medications for 3 months completed this 6-month open-label controlled trial.

COC containing drospirenone (DRSP) is an analog of spironolactone, hence its antimineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic characteristics have been deemed beneficial, although the benefits and/or negative outcome of its usage have not been fully elucidated. We therefore hypothesized that COC with DRSP component will not affect glucose regulation and circulating corticosterone. Method Ten-week-old female Wistar rats were divided into three groups: control (CON), ethinylestradiol/drospirenone COC (EE/DRSP)-treated, and ethinylestradiol/ COC (EE/LN)-treated rats. The treatment lasted for 8 weeks. Results Results showed that with the exception of lipid profiles, EE/LN but not EE/DRSP COC treatment affected body weight, glucose tolerance, plasma , corticosterone, (IR), and pancreatic β-cell dysfunction. Conclusion Taken together, the findings showed that the beneficial effect of EE/DRSP could possibly be through the DRSP component. The result also implies that COCs containing DRSP may be a better and safer means of contraception than those with LN with less cardiovascular risks.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26117991>[-releasing intrauterine system Mirena® (Bayer) for the prevention and treatment of endometrial adenocarcinoma and the incidence of other malignancies in women].</a></h2><p>The use of hormone-releasing intrauterine devices has been on the increase for the last three decades. To date, evidence of their long-term efficiency is available. The aim of the present paper was to briefly review beneficial prophylactic effects of the -releasing intrauterine system on the incidence of a variety of malignancies in women. Such an influence is of a particular importance in the light of the currently observed increased prevalence of endometrial and cervical adenocarcinomas. Low-dose releasing intrauterine systems are also available, but the hard evidence-based medical data have been derived primarily for Mirena® (Bayer) device, which topically releases from 20 to 14 pg of  daily. Consequently the risk of developing endometrial carcinoma in Mirena® users is lowered by as much as 50% compared with the general population risk To a lesser extent, the intrauterine system decreases the risk for cervical adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, as well as ovarian, pancreas, and lung carcinomas. In one population-based study Mirena® increased the risk for breast carcinoma by approximately 20%, whereas a number of other studies failed to demonstrate such a hazard. In the recent decades of the increased predominance of  and obesity and an occurrence of hormone-dependent carcinomas at earlier age, a broad application of -releasing intrauterine systems may become a particularly important component of primary prevention of malignancies in women.

After hormonal treatment for 6 months the amount of glucose infused decreased significantly in the previously gestational diabetic women (1.10 +/- 0.12 mmol/m2 X min, P = 0.01), whereas the decrease was less pronounced in the nondiabetic women (1.30 +/- 0.22 mmol/m2 X min, P = 0.09). The decrease in insulin sensitivity was not sufficient to alter glucose tolerance either in the previous gestational diabetic women nor in the nondiabetic women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28868937>Ameliorative effect of nicotine exposure on  is accompanied by decreased cardiac glycogen synthase kinase-3 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 during oral oestrogen-progestin therapy.</a></h2><p>Cigarette smoking is considered to be a major risk factor for the development of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

However, these effects with the exception of corticosterone and aldosterone were ameliorated in COC + nicotine-exposed rats.Amelioration of IR induced by COC treatment is accompanied by decreased circulating PAI-1, cardiac PAI-1 and GSK-3 instead of circulating aldosterone and corticosterone.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3781292>[Oral contraceptives and metabolic changes].</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12280210>[Influence of progestins on adverse effects of oral contraceptives].</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31336054>Oral ethinylestradiol- normalizes fructose-induced hepatic lipid accumulation and glycogen depletion in female rats.</a></h2><p>The present study investigated the effects of oral ethinylestradiol- (EEL) on hepatic lipid and glycogen contents during high fructose (HF) intake, and determined whether pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK-4) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity were involved in HF and (or) EEL-induced hepatic dysmetabolism. Female Wistar rats weighing 140-160 g were divided into groups. The control, EEL, HF, and EEL+HF groups received water (vehicle, p.o.), 1.0 μg ethinylestradiol plus 5.0 μg  (p.o.), fructose (10% ), and EEL plus HF, respectively, on a daily basis for 8 weeks. Results revealed that treatment with EEL or HF led to , hyperinsulinemia, increased hepatic uric acid production and triglyceride content, reduced glycogen content, and reduced production of plasma or hepatic glutathione- and G6PD-dependent antioxidants. HF but not EEL also increased fasting glucose and hepatic PDK-4. Nonetheless, these alterations were attenuated by EEL in HF-treated rats. Our results demonstrate that hepatic lipid accumulation and glycogen depletion induced by HF is accompanied by increased PDK-4 and defective G6PD activity. The findings also suggest that EEL would attenuate hepatic lipid accumulation and glycogen depletion by suppression of PDK-4 and enhancement of a G6PD-dependent antioxidant barrier.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24788670>Steroidal contraceptives: effect on carbohydrate metabolism in women without diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p>Many hormonal contraceptives have been associated with changes in carbohydrate metabolism. Alterations may include decreased glucose tolerance and increased , which are risk factors for Type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. These issues have been raised primarily with contraceptives containing estrogen.To evaluate the effect of hormonal contraceptives on carbohydrate metabolism in healthy women and those at risk for diabetes due to overweight.In April 2014, we searched the computerized databases MEDLINE, POPLINE, CENTRAL, and LILACS for studies of hormonal contraceptives and carbohydrate metabolism. We also searched for clinical trials in ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP. The initial search also included EMBASE.All randomized controlled trials were considered if they examined carbohydrate metabolism in women without diabetes who used hormonal contraceptives for contraception. Comparisons could be a placebo, a non-hormonal contraceptive, or another hormonal contraceptive that differed in drug, dosage, or regimen. Interventions included at least three cycles. Outcomes included glucose and  measures.We assessed all titles and abstracts identified during the literature searches. The data were extracted and entered into RevMan. We wrote to researchers for missing data. For continuous variables, the mean difference (MD) was computed with 95% confidence interval (CI) using a fixed-effect model. For dichotomous outcomes, the Peto odds ratio with 95% CI was calculated.We found 31 trials that met the inclusion criteria. No new trials were eligible in 2014. Twenty-one trials compared combined oral contraceptives (COCs); others examined different COC regimens, progestin-only pills, injectables, a vaginal ring, and implants. None included a placebo. Of 34 comparisons, eight had any notable difference between the study groups in an outcome.Twelve trials studied desogestrel-containing COCs, and the few differences from  COCs were inconsistent. A meta-analysis of two studies showed the desogestrel group had a higher mean fasting glucose (MD 0.20; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.41). Where data could not be combined, single studies showed lower mean fasting glucose (MD -0.40; 95% CI -0.72 to -0.08) and higher means for two-hour glucose response (MD 1.08; 95% CI 0.45 to 1.71) and  area under the curve (AUC) (MD 20.30; 95% CI 4.24 to 36.36).Three trials examined the etonogestrel vaginal ring and one examined an etonogestrel implant. One trial showed the ring group had lower mean AUC  than the -COC group (MD -204.51; 95% CI -389.64 to -19.38).Of eight trials of norethisterone preparations, five compared COCs and three compared injectables. In a COC trial, a norethisterone group had smaller mean change in glucose two-hour response than a -COC group (MD -0.30; 95% CI -0.54 to -0.06). In an injectable study, a group using depot medroxyprogesterone acetate had higher means than the group using norethisterone enanthate for fasting glucose (MD 10.05; 95% CI 3.16 to 16.94), glucose two-hour response (MD 17.00; 95% CI 5.67 to 28.33), and fasting  (MD 3.40; 95% CI 2.07 to 4.73).Among five recent trials, two examined newer COCs with different estrogen types. One showed the group with nomegestrel acetate plus 17β-estradiol had lower means than the  group for incremental AUC glucose (MD -1.43; 95% CI -2.55 to -0.31) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (MD -0.10; 95% CI -0.18 to -0.02). Two trials compared extended versus conventional (cyclic) regimens. With a dienogest COC, an extended-use group had greater mean change in AUC glucose (MD 82.00; 95% CI 10.72 to 153.28). In a small trial using two  COCs, the lower-dose group showed smaller mean change in fasting glucose (MD -3.00; 95% CI -5.89 to -0.11), but the obese and normal weight women did not differ significantly.Current evidence suggests no major differences in carbohydrate metabolism between different hormonal contraceptives in women without diabetes. We cannot make strong statements due to having few studies that compared the same types of contraceptives. Many trials had small numbers of participants and some had large losses. Many of the earlier studies had limited reporting of methods.We still know very little about women at risk for metabolic problems due to being overweight. More than half of the trials had weight restrictions as inclusion criteria. Only one small trial stratified the groups by body mass index (obese versus normal).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28238536>High salt intake does not aggravate glucose dysregulation and dyslipidemia induced by estrogen-progestin oral contraceptive.</a></h2><p>Estrogen-progestogen combined oral contraceptive (OC) use has been associated with increased cardiometabolic risk factors, including glucose dysregulation, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and pro-inflammatory state. However, the effect of a high-salt diet on these risk factors during OC use is not yet investigated. We therefore hypothesized that a high-salt diet would increase cardiometabolic risk factors in female rats treated with a combination of OC steroids,  (L) and ethinylestradiol (EE), and that elevated plasma levels of pro-inflammatory markers are associated with the cardiometabolic effects.Female Wistar rats were given (p.o.) vehicle, high-dose (1.0μg EE plus 5.0μgL) or low-dose (0.1μg EE plus 0.5μgL) OC with or without a high-salt diet (8%) daily for 8 weeks.  (IR) was estimated using the homeostatic model of assessment (HOMA).Results showed that OC treatment or high salt diet led to significant increases in , plasma , total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), TC/HDL-cholesterol, uric acid levels, and decreased glucose tolerance. OC treatment but not a high-salt diet resulted in increased plasma C-reactive protein and TG/HDL-cholesterol. However, a high-salt diet did not aggravate the effects of OC treatment.The results from the present study indicate that glucose dysfunction and dyslipidemia induced by OC use, but not those induced by increased dietary salt are associated with elevated plasma C-reactive protein. Besides, increased dietary salt does not worsen abnormal cardiometabolic impact of OC use.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.
