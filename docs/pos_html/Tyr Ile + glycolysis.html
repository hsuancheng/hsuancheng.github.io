<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15356277>Integrating the universal metabolism into a phylogenetic analysis.</a></h2><p>The darwinian concept of "descent with modification" applies to metabolic pathways: pathways sharing similarities must have inherited them from an exclusive, hypothetical ancestral pathway. Comparative anatomy of biochemical pathways is performed using five criteria of homology. Primary homologies of "type I" were defined as several pathways sharing the same enzyme with high specificity for its substrate. Primary homologies of "type II" were defined as the sharing of similar enzymatic functions, cofactors, functional family, or recurrence of a set of reactions. Standard cladistic analysis is used to infer the evolutionary history of metabolic development and the relative ordering of biochemical reactions through time, from a single matrix integrating the whole basic universal metabolism. The cladogram shows that the earliest pathways to emerge are metabolism of amino acids of groups I and II (Asp, Asn, Glu, and Gln). The earliest enzymatic functions are mostly linked to amino acid catabolism: deamination, transamination, and decarboxylation. For some amino acids, catabolism and biosynthesis occur at the same time (Asp, Glu, Lys, and Met). Catabolism precedes anabolism for Asn, Gln, Arg, Trp, His, , and Phe, and anabolism precedes catabolism for Pro, Ala, Leu, Val, , Cys, Gly, Ser, and Thr. The urea cycle evolves from arginine synthesis. Metabolism of fatty acids and sugars develops after the full development of metabolism of amino acids of groups I and II, and they are associated with the anabolism of amino acids of groups III and IV. Syntheses of aromatic amino acids are branched within sugar metabolism. The Krebs cycle occurs relatively late after the setting of metabolism of amino acids of groups I and II. One portion of the Krebs cycle has a catabolic origin, whereas the other portion has an anabolic origin in pathways of amino acids of groups III and IV. It is not possible to order glycolysis and gluconeogenesis with regard to the Krebs cycle, as they all belong to "period 6." Pentose-phosphate and Calvin cycles are later (periods 7 and 8, respectively). Cladistic analysis of the structure of biochemical pathways makes hypotheses in biochemical evolution explicit and parsimonious.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21677784>Biological responses to perfluorododecanoic acid exposure in rat kidneys as determined by integrated proteomic and metabonomic studies.</a></h2><p>Perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA) is a perfluorinated carboxylic chemical (PFC) that has broad applications and distribution in the environment. While many studies have focused on hepatotoxicity, immunotoxicity, and reproductive toxicity of PFCAs, few have investigated renal toxicity.Here, we used comparative proteomic and metabonomic technologies to provide a global perspective on renal response to PFDoA. Male rats were exposed to 0, 0.05, 0.2, and 0.5 mg/kg/day of PFDoA for 110 days. After 2-D DIGE and MALDI TOF/TOF analysis, 79 differentially expressed proteins between the control and the PFDoA treated rats (0.2 and 0.5 mg-dosed groups) were successfully identified. These proteins were mainly involved in amino acid metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, electron transport, and stress response. Nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabonomic analysis showed an increase in pyruvate, lactate, acetate, choline, and a variety of amino acids in the highest dose group. Furthermore, the profiles of free amino acids in the PFDoA treated groups were investigated quantitatively by high-coverage quantitative iTRAQ-LC MS/MS, which showed levels of sarcosine, asparagine, histidine, 1-methylhistidine, , Leu, Val, Trp, , Phe, Cys, and Met increased markedly in the 0.5 mg dosed group, while homocitrulline, α-aminoadipic acid, β-alanine, and cystathionine decreased.These observations provide evidence that disorders in glucose and amino acid metabolism may contribute to PFDoA nephrotoxicity. Additionally, α(2u) globulin may play an important role in protecting the kidneys from PFDoA toxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9338582>Evidence for founder effect of the Glu104Asp substitution and identification of new mutations in triosephosphate isomerase deficiency.</a></h2><p>Triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder of glycolysis characterized by multisystem disease and lethality in early childhood. Among seven unrelated Northern European kindreds with clinical TPI deficiency studied, a single missense mutation at codon 104 (GAG;Glu-->GAC;Asp) predominated, accounting for 11/14 (79%) mutant alleles. In three families molecular analysis revealed compound heterozygosity for Glu104Asp and novel missense mutations. In two cases the second mutation was a Cys to  substitution at codon 41 (TGT-->TAT) and in one an  to Val substitution at codon 170(ATT-->GTT). The origin of the Glu104Asp mutation was defined by haplotype analysis using a novel G/A polymorphism at nucleotide 2898 of the TPI gene. Cosegregation of the low frequency 2898A allele with the G-->C base change at nucleotide 315 supports a single origin for the Glu104Asp mutation in a common ancestor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2935776>Relation of protein synthesis to plasma and cell amino acids in neonates.</a></h2><p>We hypothesized that more rapidly growing preterm infants would have higher rates of protein synthesis than term infants, and that protein synthesis would be more closely related to intracellular than plasma levels of amino acids. Neutrophils, used as a cell model, were isolated from 1-3 ml blood of 63 infants 27-44 wk postconceptual age. Protein synthesis (3H-leucine incorporation, pmol/h/mg DNA), and 19 amino acids in the leukocytes (nmol/mg DNA) and plasma (nmol/ml) were quantified. Protein synthesis was related inversely to birth weight and gestational age, i.e. the smaller and more preterm the infant the higher the rate of protein synthesis. Multiple regression analysis limited to six steps indicated that some plasma amino acids (Val, , Phe, Asp, Ala, Tau) accounted for a significant (p = 0.03), but relatively small, proportion, 23%, of the variance in protein synthesis. A greater proportion of the variance in protein synthesis was explained by a set of six intracellular amino acids (Leu, Met, , Gly, Ala, Tau), with R2 = 36%, p = 0.001. Further, multiple regression identified specific combinations of six plasma amino acids which best explained ("predicted") the levels of each intracellular amino acid predictor of protein synthesis (R2 = 0.4-0.5, p less than 0.001-0.0001). Activities of some rate-limiting glycolytic enzymes, pyruvate kinase and phosphofructokinase, were correlated with protein synthesis in the leukocytes (p = 0.036, and 0.002, respectively). Phosphofructokinase, the major regulating enzyme in glycolysis, also was negatively correlated with birth weight and gestational age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p></html>
