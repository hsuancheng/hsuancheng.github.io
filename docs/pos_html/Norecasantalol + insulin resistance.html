Clinical and hormonal findings in females with NC-CAH are overlapping with other hyperandrogenic entities such as polycystic ovary syndrome hence causing difficulties in diagnostic approach. Metabolic consequences in subjects with NC-CAH are relatively unknown. We are lacking longitudinal follow of these patients regarding natural course of the disease or the therapeutic effects of the different drug regiments. Patients with NC-CAH similarly to those with classical form are characterized with deteriorated cardiovascular risk factors that are probably translated into cardiometabolic diseases and events. An increased preponderance of obesity and  in patients with NC-CAH begin at young age could result in increased rates of metabolic sequelae and cardiovascular disease later during adulthood in both sexes. On the other hand, growth disorder was not proven in patients with NC-CAH in comparison to CAH patients of both gender characterized with reduced final adult height. Similarly, decreased bone mineral density and osteoporosis are not constant findings in patients with NC-CAH and could depend on the sex, and type or dose of corticosteroids applied. It could be concluded that NC-CAH represent a particular form of CAH that is characterized with specificities in clinical presentation, diagnosis, therapeutic approach and metabolic outcomes.Copyright © 2019 Macut, Zdravković, Bjekić-Macut, Mastorakos and Pignatelli.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652310>Kinome profiling reveals abnormal activity of kinases in skeletal muscle from adults with obesity and .</a></h2><p>Obesity-related  (OIR) is one of the main contributors to type 2 diabetes and other metabolic diseases. Protein kinases are implicated in  signaling and glucose metabolism. Molecular mechanisms underlying OIR involving global kinase activities remain incompletely understood.To investigate abnormal kinase activity associated with OIR in human skeletal muscle.Stable isotopic labeling-based quantitative proteomics combined with affinity-based​​ active enzyme probes to profile in vivo kinase activity in skeletal muscle from lean control (Lean) and OIR participants.Eight Lean and eight OIR non-diabetic human adults who underwent hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with muscle biopsy.We identified the 1st active kinome comprised of 54 active protein kinases in human skeletal muscle. The activities of 23 kinases were different in OIR compared to Lean muscle (11 hyper- and 12 hypo-active), while their protein abundance was the same between the two groups. The activities of multiple kinases involved in AMPK and p38 signaling were lower in OIR compared to Lean. On the contrary, multiple kinases in the JNK signaling pathway exhibited higher activity in OIR vs. Lean. The kinase-substrate-prediction based on experimental data further confirmed a potential down-regulation of  signaling (e.g., inhibited phosphorylation of IRS1 and AKT1/2).These findings provide a global view of the kinome activity in OIR and Lean muscle, pinpoint novel specific impairment in kinase activities in signaling pathways important for skeletal muscle  and may provide potential drug targets (i.e., abnormal kinase activities) to prevent and/or reverse skeletal muscle  in humans.© Endocrine Society 2019.

Subjects were examined during an oral glucose stimulus and results compared to preoperative and 1-year (1 y) post RYGB results. Glucose tolerance, , beta-cell function and incretin hormone secretion were evaluated. 1 y weight loss was maintained late after surgery. Glycemic control, , beta-cell function and GLP-1 remained improved late after surgery in both groups. In NGT subjects, nadir glucose decreased 1 y after RYGB, but did not change further. In T2D patients, relative change in weight from 1 y to late after RYGB correlated with relative change in fasting glucose and HbA1c, whereas relative changes in glucose-stimulated  release correlated inversely with relative changes in postprandial glucose excursions. In NGT subjects, relative changes in postprandial nadir glucose correlated with changes in beta-cell glucose sensitivity. Thus, effects of RYGB on weight and glucose metabolism are maintained late after surgery in patients with and without preoperative T2D. Weight loss and improved beta-cell function both contribute to maintenance of long-term glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes, and increased glucose stimulated  secretion may contribute to postprandial hypoglycemia in NGT subjects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655133>β-Klotho gene variation is associated with liver damage in children with NAFLD.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the leading cause of chronic liver disease in adults and children. Along with obesity, diabetes and , genetic factors strongly impact on NAFLD development and progression. Dysregulated bile acid metabolism and the fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) pathway play a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis. However, it remains to be defined the mechanism through which the FGF19 receptor system is associated with liver damage in NAFLD.We evaluated the impact of the rs17618244 G>A β-Klotho (KLB) variant on liver damage in 249 pediatric patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and the association of this variant with the expression of hepatic and soluble KLB. In vitro models were established to investigate the role of KLB mutant.The KLB rs17618244 variant was associated with increased risk of ballooning and lobular inflammation. KLB plasma levels were lower in carriers of the rs17618244 minor A allele and were associated with lobular inflammation, ballooning and fibrosis. In HepG2 and Huh7 hepatoma cell lines, exposure to free fatty acids caused a severe reduction of intracellular and secreted KLB. Finally, KLB down-regulation obtained by the expression of KLB mutant in HepG2 and Huh7 cells induced intracellular lipid accumulation and up-regulation of p62, ACOX1, ACSL1, IL-1β and TNF-α gene expression.In conclusion, we showed an association between the rs17618244 KLB variant, which leads to reduced KLB expression, and the severity of NAFLD in pediatric patients. We can speculate that KLB protein may exert a protective role against lipotoxicity and inflammation in hepatocytes.Genetic and environmental factors strongly impact on NAFLD pathogenesis and progression. The FGF19/FGFR4/KLB pathway plays a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis, thus, it has been identified as a therapeutic target. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the impact of the KLB rs17618244 G>A genetic variant on liver damage severity in pediatric patients with NAFLD, and the effect of KLB mutant on hepatocellular damage.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Fifty weaned male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: the control, 13% fructose, 20% fructose, 1 µg/mL BPA, and 13% fructose + 1 µg/mL BPA (combined exposure). Rats were exposed to fructose and/or BPA through drinking water for eight weeks. Genes or proteins regulating lipid metabolism include sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty acid synthase (FAS), zinc α 2 glycoprotein (ZAG) and estrogen receptor α (ERα), and the expression of proteins regulating inflammatory response, such as TLR4 and NF-κB, were determined. Serum total cholesterol (T-CHO), triglyceride (TG), low, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, HDL-C), blood glucose, , IL-17 and TNF-α levels were also measured. Liver tissue morphology was observed by H&E staining. The results showed that the levels of gene and protein catalyzing lipogenesis were increased (SREBP1, ACC1 and FAS), while those catalyzing lipolysis were decreased (ATGL, HSL and ZAG), accompanied by dyslipidemia,  and hepatic fat accumulation, and there were higher expression of TLR4 and NF-κB protein and lower expression of ERα protein in liver, and increased serum IL-17 and TNF-α levels in fructose and/or BPA exposed rats compared with controls. Moreover, the above indicators were more serious in combined exposure group than in single exposure group. Therefore, abnormal lipid metabolism in the liver of developmental rats could be exacerbated by combined exposed to fructose and BPA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640890>The probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum 296 attenuates cardiometabolic disorders in high fat diet-treated rats.</a></h2><p>High-fat (HF) diet consumption has been associated with gut dysbiosis and increased risk of dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Probiotic administration has been suggested as a safe therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cardiometabolic disorders. This study was designed to assess the effects of probiotic Lactobacillus (L.) fermentum 296, a fruit-derived bacteria strain, against cardiometabolic disorders induced by HF diet.Male Wistar rats were divided into control diet (CTL); HF diet; and HF diet treated with Lactobacillus fermentum 296 (HF + Lf 296). The L. fermentum 296 strain at 1 × 10 colony forming units (CFU)/ml were daily administered by oral gavage for 4 weeks. The results showed that rats fed with HF diet displayed , reduced Lactobacillus spp. counts in feces, serum lipids, and oxidative profile. Rats fed on HF diet also demonstrated augmented blood pressure associated with sympathetic hyperactivity and impaired baroreflex control. The administration of L. fermentum 296 for 4 weeks recovered fecal Lactobacillus sp. counts and alleviated hyperlipidemia, sympathetic hyperactivity, and reduced systolic blood pressure in HF rats without affecting baroreflex sensibility.Our results suggest the ability of L. fermentum 296 improve biochemical and cardiovascular parameters altered in cardiometabolic disorders.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

Cookie meal testing (carbohydrates: 75 g, fats: 28.5 g), endothelial function testing using flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), and body composition evaluation were performed before and after six months of treatment. Changes in %FMD between the treatment periods and its association with metabolic biomarkers were evaluated.After six months of treatment, the body weight and body fat percentage decreased significantly, while the body muscle percentage increased significantly. The hemoglobin A1c level and fasting and postprandial plasma glucose levels were significantly decreased with treatment. Postprandial  secretion was also significantly suppressed and the  index was significantly decreased. Furthermore, the fasting and postprandial triglyceride (TG) levels decreased significantly, while total ketone bodies increased significantly after the six-month treatment. While the plasma brain natriuretic peptide level was not changed, the C-reactive protein level was decreased and FMD was significantly improved after the six-month treatment. Multiple regression analysis showed that the strongest predictive factor of FMD improvement is change in the plasma TG levels.SGLT2 inhibitors improve multiple metabolic parameters. Of these, a reduction in plasma TGs was strongly associated with endothelial function recovery in diabetic patients with CAD, and this reduction may be related to the cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659873>Muscle  in Youth with Obesity and Normoglycemia is Associated with Altered Fat Metabolism.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to phenotype and compare adipose, hepatic, and muscle  sensitivity (IS) in a diet- and physical activity-controlled cohort of normoglycemic youth with obesity with that of participants without obesity (controls) to distinguish early metabolic abnormalities in pediatric obesity.Thirty-eight participants (17 in the control group [BMI < 85th percentile] and 21 youth with obesity [BMI ≥ 95th percentile]; age: 12-21 years; 76% female; Tanner stage 4-5; sedentary) were enrolled. Tissue-specific IS was measured using a four-phase hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with glucose and glycerol isotope tracers to assess suppression of endogenous glucose release and lipolysis by . Intramyocellular lipid content was assessed by  H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and hepatic fat fraction (HFF) and visceral fat were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Calf-muscle mitochondrial activity was measured with exercise-stimulated  P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Youth with obesity had higher HFF (P < 0.001), visceral fat (P = 0.024), and intramyocellular lipid content (P = 0.017) and lower muscle (glucose clearance rate [P < 0.001]), adipose (P < 0.0001), and hepatic IS (P < 0.003). Mitochondria postexercise response was not different. In participants with obesity, muscle IS inversely correlated with HFF (r = 0.700, P = 0.002) and suppressed free fatty acid concentrations (r = -0.65, P = 0.003).Inactive normoglycemic youth with obesity had decreased muscle, adipose, and hepatic IS.

Generally, lifespans are determined by a phase in life, the reproductive lifespan, which varies among species. Numerous pathways, such as the /-like growth factor signaling pathway, the target of rapamycin pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinases pathways, influence aging and lifespan. Components of these pathways were identified as lifespan-related genes, including genes mediating growth, metabolism, development, , and other processes. Many age-related genes have been discovered in fruit flies, honeybees, and ants among other insect species. Studies of insect aging and longevity can help understand insect biology and develop new pest management technologies. In this paper, we interrogated the new Pteromalus puparum genome, from which we predicted 133 putative lifespan-related genes based on their homology with known lifespan-related genes of Drosophila melanogaster. These genes function in five signaling pathways and three physiological processes. The conserved domain structures of these genes were predicted and their expression patterns were analyzed. Amino acid sequence alignments and domain structure analysis indicate that most components remain conserved across at least six insect orders. The data in this paper will facilitate future work on parasitoid lifespans, which may have economic value in biocontrol programs.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642314> Inhibits Aβ42 Aggregation and Prevents Aβ42-Induced Membrane Disruption.</a></h2><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with self-assembly of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) into soluble oligomers.

Among multiple risk factors, host intestinal microbiota has received increasing attention in T2D etiology and progression. In the present study, we have explored the effect of long-term supplementation with a non-dairy fermented food product (FFP) in Zucker Diabetic and Fatty (ZDF) rats T2D model. The supplementation with FFP induced an improvement in glucose homeostasis according to the results obtained from fasting blood glucose levels, glucose tolerance test, and pancreatic function. Importantly, a significantly reduced intestinal glucose absorption was found in the FFP-treated rats. Supplemented animals also showed a greater survival suggesting a better health status as a result of the FFP intake. Some dissimilarities have been observed in the gut microbiota population between control and FFP-treated rats, and interestingly a tendency for better cardiometabolic markers values was appreciated in this group. However, no significant differences were observed in body weight, body composition, or food intake between groups. These findings suggest that FFP induced gut microbiota modifications in ZDF rats that improved glucose metabolism and protected from T2D development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641635>Comparison of the Different PCOS Phenotypes Based on Clinical Metabolic, and Hormonal Profile, and their Response to Clomiphene.</a></h2><p>To compare the different polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) phenotypes based on their clinical, metabolic, hormonal profile, and their differential response to clomiphene.Prospective observational study.Infertility clinic, a government hospital.164 women with PCOS-related infertility.Sample population was divided into four phenotypes based on the NIH (National Institute of Health) consensus panel criteria.

Also, the response to clomiphene citrate was studied as presence or absence of ovulation.The prevalence of phenotypes A, B, C, and D were 67.7%, 11%, 17.7%, and 3.6%, respectively. Phenotype A had significantly higher weight, body mass index, clinical, and biochemical hyperandrogenism, menstrual irregularities, ovarian reserve parameters, fasting , HOMA-IR, and more deranged lipid profile ( < 0.05). Clomiphene  was significantly more common in phenotype A ( < 0.05).

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has a correlation with metabolic syndrome and its complications.We reviewed the literature regarding the mechanisms of developing NAFLD through AGE-RAGE signaling.NAFLD, metabolic syndrome, and production of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) share many common risk factors and appear to be connected. AGE induces production of the receptor for AGE (RAGE). AGE-RAGE interaction contributes to fat accumulation in the liver leading to inflammation, fibrosis, , and other complications of the fatty liver disease. The immune system, especially macrophages, has an important defense mechanism against RAGE pathway activities.Soluble form of RAGE (sRAGE) has the capability to reduce inflammation by blocking the interaction of AGE with RAGE. However, sRAGE has some limitations, and the best method of usage is probably autotransplantation of transfected stem cells or monocytes, as a precursor of macrophages and Kupffer cells, with a virus that carries sRAGE to alleviate the harmful effects of AGE-RAGE signaling in the settings of fatty liver disease.Copyright © 2019 Kamyar Asadipooya et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638645>Advanced Glycation End Products: Building on the Concept of the "Common Soil" in Metabolic Disease.</a></h2><p>The role of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in promoting and/or exacerbating metabolic dysregulation is being increasingly recognized. AGEs are formed when reducing sugars non-enzymatically bind to proteins or lipids, a process that is enhanced by hyperglycemic and hyperlipidemic environments characteristic of numerous metabolic disorders including obesity, diabetes and its complications. In this mini-review, we put forth the notion that AGEs span the spectrum from cause to consequence of  (IR) and diabetes, and represent a "common soil" underlying the pathophysiology of these metabolic disorders. Collectively, the surveyed literature suggests that AGEs, both those that form endogenously as well as exogenous AGEs derived from environmental factors such as pollution, smoking and "Western" style diets, contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity and diabetes. Specifically, AGE accumulation in key metabolically-relevant organs induces IR, inflammation and oxidative stress, which in turn provide substrates for excess AGE formation, thus, creating a feed-forward fueled pathological loop mediating metabolic dysfunction.© Endocrine Society 2019.

Emerging data suggest that chronic vinegar ingestion impacts fat metabolism and reduces adiposity, although no study has yet corroborated the events of vinegar supplementation metabolically through a metabolomics approach. To examine the impact of daily vinegar ingestion on glucose homeostasis, adiposity, and the metabolome, an 8-week, randomized controlled trial design was implemented utilizing two parallel treatment arms: daily red wine vinegar ingestion and a control treatment. Participants were 45 healthy adults at increased risk for metabolic complications as determined by high waist circumferences. Measurements and blood samples were collected pre- and post-intervention. Central adiposity and visceral fat were assessed by waist circumference and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, respectively.

Metabolic pathway analysis revealed significant alterations in tryptophan metabolism. Although daily red wine vinegar ingestion for 8 weeks induced significant improvements in glucose homeostasis, our results indicate that daily red wine vinegar ingestion for 8 weeks is not associated with reductions in adiposity.

In this review, the beneficial effects of pterostilbene on diabetes, liver steatosis and dyslipidemia are summarized. Pterostilbene is a useful bioactive compound in preventing type 1 diabetes,  and type 2 diabetes in animal models. Concerning type 1 diabetes, the main mechanisms described to justify the positive effects of this phenolic compound are increased liver glycogen content and hepatic glucokinase and phosphofructokinase activities, the recovery of pancreatic islet architecture, cytoprotection and a decrease in serum and pancreatic pro-inflammatory cytokines. As for type 2 diabetes, increased liver glucokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase and decreased fructose-1,6-biphosphatase activities are reported. When  is induced by diets, a greater activation of  signaling cascade has been reported, increased cardiotrophin-1 levels and liver glucokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase activities, and a decreased fructose-1,6-biphosphatase activity. Data concerning pterostilbene and liver steatosis are scarce so far, but the reduction in oxidative stress induced by pterostilbene may be involved since oxidative stress is related to the progression of steatosis to steatohepatitis. Finally, pterostilbene effectivelly reduces total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride serum levels, while increases HDL-cholesterol in animal models of dyslipidemia.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661295>Effects of resistant starch on glycemic control, serum lipoproteins and systemic inflammation in patients with metabolic syndrome and related disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials.</a></h2><p>The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects of resistant starch (RS) on glycemic status, serum lipoproteins and inflammatory markers in patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS) and related disorders.

However, there is growing concern for their impact on metabolic health.Human endothelial cells were treated with Glucose, Fructose, Aspartame, Rebaudioside A, Stevioside, or Steviol. Morphological characteristics, in vitro angiogenesis and array gene expression were analyzed.High-glucose and fructose concentrations significantly decreased cell features such as angiogenic capability. Interestingly, non-caloric sweeteners did not significantly modified all cell characteristics and they did not compromised cell angiogenic ability. Array gene expression analysis revealed that the chemokine fractalkine (CX3CL1) and the enzyme transferase (HPRT1) were always significantly upregulated and downregulated respectively, after glucose and fructose treatments (P > .05), whereas they were non-differentially expressed with all the other sweeteners. Interestingly, both genes are considered as cardiovascular disease risk biomarkers. Specifically, upregulation of CX3CL1/CX3CR1 occurs in the human placenta and serum levels of the ligand are associated with markers of  in GDM.Differently from glucose and fructose, steviol glycosides do not damage endothelial cells. Prospective preclinical studies and clinical trials are warranted to confirm the long-term safety of such compounds.Copyright © 2018.

The pathophysiology underlying this complication is not well understood. Type 1 DM has been associated with a decrease in the speed of information processing, psychomotor efficiency, attention, mental flexibility, and visual perception. Longitudinal epidemiological studies of type 1 DM have indicated that chronic hyperglycemia and microvascular disease, rather than repeated severe hypoglycemia, are associated with the pathogenesis of DM-related cognitive dysfunction. However, severe hypoglycemic episodes may contribute to cognitive dysfunction in high-risk patients with DM. Type 2 DM has been associated with memory deficits, decreased psychomotor speed, and reduced frontal lobe/executive function. In type 2 DM, chronic hyperglycemia, long duration of DM, presence of vascular risk factors (e.g., hypertension and obesity), and microvascular and macrovascular complications are associated with the increased risk of developing cognitive dysfunction. The pathophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in individuals with DM include the following: (1) role of hyperglycemia, (2) role of vascular disease, (3) role of hypoglycemia, and (4) role of  and amyloid. Recently, some investigators have proposed that type 3 DM is correlated to sporadic Alzheimer's disease. The molecular and biochemical consequences of  and -like growth factor  in the brain compromise neuronal survival, energy production, gene expression, plasticity, and white matter integrity. If patients claim that their performance is worsening or if they ask about the effects of DM on functioning, screening and assessment are recommended.Copyright © 2019 Yeungnam University College of Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665391>A Combination of Metabolites Predicts Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet Pattern and Its Associations with  Sensitivity and Lipid Homeostasis in the General Population: The Fenland Study, United Kingdom.</a></h2><p>Cardiometabolic benefits of the Mediterranean diet have been recognized, but underlying mechanisms are not fully understood.We aimed to investigate how the Mediterranean diet could influence circulating metabolites and how the metabolites could mediate the associations of the diet with cardiometabolic risk factors.Among 10,806 participants (58.9% women, mean age = 48.4 y) in the Fenland Study (2004-2015) in the United Kingdom, we assessed dietary consumption with FFQs and conducted a targeted metabolomics assay for 175 plasma metabolites (acylcarnitines, amines, sphingolipids, and phospholipids). We examined cross-sectional associations of the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and its major components with each metabolite, modeling multivariable-adjusted linear regression. We used the regression estimates to summarize metabolites associated with the MDS into a metabolite score as a marker of the diet. Subsequently, we assessed how much metabolite subclasses and the metabolite score would mediate the associations of the MDS with circulating lipids, homeostasis model assessment of  (HOMA-IR), and other metabolic factors by comparing regression estimates upon adjustment for the metabolites.Sixty-six metabolites were significantly associated with the MDS (P ≤ 0.003, corrected for false discovery rate) (Spearman correlations, r: -0.28 to +0.28). The metabolite score was moderately correlated with the MDS (r = 0.43). Of MDS components, consumption of nuts, cereals, and meats contributed to variations in acylcarnitines; fruits, to amino acids and amines; and fish, to phospholipids. The metabolite score was estimated to explain 37.2% of the inverse association of the MDS with HOMA-IR (P for mediation < 0.05). The associations of the MDS with cardiometabolic factors were estimated to be mediated by acylcarnitines, sphingolipids, and phospholipids.Multiple metabolites relate to the Mediterranean diet in a healthy general British population and highlight the potential to identify a set of biomarkers for an overall diet. The associations may involve pathways of phospholipid metabolism, carnitine metabolism, and development of  and dyslipidemia.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637401>Frailty and the Metabolic Syndrome - Results of the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II).</a></h2><p>Frailty and the metabolic Syndrome (MetS) are frequently found in old subjects and have been associated with increased risk of functional decline and dependency.

However, the relationship between MetS and frailty has not yet been studied in detail. Aim of the current analysis within the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II) was to explore associations between MetS and frailty taking important co-variables such as nutrition (total energy intake, dietary vitamin D intake), physical activity and vitamin D-status into account.Complete cross-sectional data of 1,486 old participants (50.2% women, 68.7 (65.8-71.3) years) of BASE-II were analyzed. MetS was defined following the joint interim statement of the International Diabetes Federation Task Force on Epidemiology and Prevention; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; American Heart Association; World Heart Federation; International Atherosclerosis Society; and International Association for the Study of Obesity in 2009. Frailty was defined according to the Fried criteria. Limitations in physical performance were assessed via questionnaire, muscle mass was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and grip strength using a Smedley dynamometer. Adjusted regression models were calculated to assess the association between MetS and Frailty.MetS was prevalent in 37.6% of the study population and 31.9% were frail or prefrail according to the here calculated frailty index. In adjusted models the odds of being frail/prefrail were increased about 50% with presence of the MetS (OR1.5; 95% CI 1.2,1.9; p= 0.002). Moreover the odds of being prefrail/frail were significantly increased with low HDL-C (OR: 1.5 (95%CI: 1.0-2.3); p = 0.037); and elevated waist circumference (OR: 1.65 (95%CI: 1.1-2.3); p = 0.008).The current analysis supports an association between MetS and frailty. There are various metabolic, immune and endocrine alterations in MetS that also play a role in mechanisms underlying the frailty syndrome. To what extent cytokine alterations, inflammatory processes, vitamin D supply and hormonal changes in age and in special metabolic states as MetS influence the development of frailty should be subject of further research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31617909>Sexual dimorphism in obesity-associated endothelial ENaC activity and stiffening in mice.</a></h2><p>Obesity and  stiffen the vasculature with females appearing to be more adversely affected.

Here we provide evidence that female mice are more susceptible to Western diet-induced endothelial cell stiffening compared to age-matched males.

In aggregate, we demonstrate a sexual dimorphism in obesity-associated endothelial stiffening, whereby females are more vulnerable than males. In females, endothelial stiffening with obesity may be attributed to estrogen signaling through the ERα-SGK-1-EnNaC axis, thus establishing a putative therapeutic target for female obesity-related vascular stiffening.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659910> for Diabetes Mellitus: Past, Present and Future.</a></h2><p> (Radix Puerariae Lobatae), the root of , is an edible and medicinal herb which has been used in treating diabetic symptoms in the orient for thousands of years.

A worrying phenomenon worldwide is increasing obesity among ageing societies, which is occurring in parallel with a higher prevalence of sarcopenia in older populations. As a result of the combination of these two states, new medical conditions, such as sarcopenic obesity, have recently become a public health concern. Data from the literature indicate a higher risk of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and atherosclerosis among patients with sarcopenic obesity than the risks associated with simple obesity or sarcopenia alone. The mechanisms underlying sarcopenic obesity are multifactorial. There is interplay between low-grade inflammation, , hormonal changes, a sedentary lifestyle, eating habits, and ageing.

The study aims at the prevalence of NODAT, predictors for developing it and therapeutic glycemic responses in NODAT.Consecutive renal transplant recipients excluding Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD) or pretransplant diabetes were evaluated. Forty-three out of 250 persons were found to have NODAT. Ninety age-matched transplant recipients from the rest were recruited as control. Fasting blood sugar (FBS), HbA1c, lipid profile, and trough tacrolimus level (T) were examined in all. HOMA IR C-peptide and HOMA-beta C-peptide were calculated.Prevalence of NODAT in renal transplant recipients was 17.2% (43/250). Twenty-four (55.8%) developed early NODAT (<1 year) and 19 (44.2%) developed late NODAT (>1 year).

Obesity related metabolic indices including glucose tolerance, , serum lipid, liver function, hormones and inflammatory cytokines were assessed by standard protocols. For the monitoring of inflammatory response and lipid metabolism, transcriptional levels were profiled in liver and/or adipose tissues. Furthermore, gut microbiota composition analyses in the fecal samples were performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and gut microbial metabolites, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), were also tested for the assessment of the relationship between gut microbiota variation and inflammatory response.Administration with L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 significantly mitigated body weight gain and , and inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels in serum and corresponding mRNA levels in adipose tissues) was significantly inhibited in these two strains-treated mice. Moreover, L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 could partially normalized mRNA expression levels involved in lipid metabolism including Pparγ, Srebp-1c, CD36, Fabp2 and FAS.

Our results showed that  knockdown caused mice obesity, , and hepatic steatosis, which were accompanied with inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. , TWIST2 overexpression ameliorated hepatocellular steatosis, inhibited inflammation, and improved mitochondrial content and function with a fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21)-dependent pattern. NF-κB negatively regulated FGF21 transcription by directly binding to  promoter DNA, which was eliminated by TWIST2 overexpression by inhibiting NF-κB expression and translocation to nucleus. TWIST2 overexpression decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species level, increased mitochondrial DNA and biogenesis, and enhanced ATP production and antioxidation ability. Additionally, TWIST2 expression was repressed by -targeting sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) and forkhead box protein O1 and was enhanced by dexamethasone targeting Krüppel-like factor 15, which directly interacted with  promoter DNA.

In addition, apoptosis is a main contributor to the development of NAFLD. This study detected whether the inhibition of ceramide synthesis ameliorated hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in rats with NAFLD. Sprague-Dawley rats were used to establish the NAFLD model. Here, we showed that hepatic ceramide, steatosis, and fibrosis increased in liver tissue from rats with NAFLD. Chronic treatment with myriocin inhibited ceramide and lipid accumulation and improved fibrosis in liver tissue samples of high fat diet (HFD)-fed rats. In addition, hepatic inflammation and apoptosis were markedly ameliorated in HFD-fed rats treated with myriocin. Furthermore, myriocin treatment regulated the expression of pro-apoptosis and anti-apoptosis proteins by inactivating the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway in the liver of HFD-fed rats.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effects of macronutrient supplements for infants born small on later development and metabolism.We searched OvidMedline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from inception to April 1, 2019, and controlled-trials.com, clinicaltrials.gov, and anzctr.org.au. Randomised or quasirandomised trials were included if the intention was to increase macronutrient intake to improve growth or development of infants born small and assessed post-discharge outcomes. Co-primary outcomes were cognitive impairment and metabolic risk, evaluated in toddlers (<3 years), childhood (3 to 8 years), and adolescence (9 to 18 years). Two reviewers independently extracted data. Quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, and data were pooled using random-effect models. Twenty-one randomised and one quasirandomised trial of variable methodological quality involving 3,680 infants were included. In toddlers born small, supplementation did not alter cognitive impairment (relative risk [RR] 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67 to 1.49; P = 0.99), and there were no differences in cognitive scores (mean difference [MD] 0.57; 95% CI -0.71 to 1.84; P = 0.38) or motor scores (MD 1.16; 95% CI -0.32 to 2.65; P = 0.12) between supplemented and unsupplemented groups. However, fewer supplemented children had motor impairment (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94; P = 0.01). In subgroup analyses, supplementation improved cognitive scores in boys (MD 5.60; 95% CI 1.07 to 10.14; P = 0.02), but not girls born small (MD -2.04; 95% CI -7.04 to 2.95; P = 0.42), and did not alter cognitive or motor scores in the subgroup of children born SGA. In childhood, there was no difference in cognitive impairment (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.26 to 2.57; P = 0.72) or cognitive scores (MD 1.02; 95% CI -1.91 to 3.95; P = 0.50) between supplemented and unsupplemented groups. There were also no differences in blood pressure, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations (all P > 0.05). However, supplemented children had lower fasting glucose (mmol/L: MD -0.20; 95% CI -0.34 to -0.06; P = 0.005) and higher high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations (mmol/L: MD 0.11; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.19; P = 0.02). In subgroup analyses, there was no evidence of differences in blood pressure between supplemented and unsupplemented groups in boys or girls born small, or in SGA children. In adolescence, there was no difference between supplemented and unsupplemented groups in blood pressure, triglycerides, LDL and HDL concentrations, fasting blood glucose, , and fasting  concentrations (all P > 0.05). Limitations include considerable unexplained heterogeneity, low to very low quality of the evidence, and limited data beyond early childhood.In this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials, we found no evidence that early macronutrient supplementation for infants born small altered later cognitive function, although there was some evidence that supplementation may decrease motor impairment in toddlers. Contrary to the findings from observational studies, evidence from randomised trials suggests that early macronutrient supplementation for infants born small improves some metabolic outcomes in childhood.CRD42019127858.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614949>High Dose of Dietary Nicotinamide Riboside Induces Glucose Intolerance and White Adipose Tissue Dysfunction in Mice Fed a Mildly Obesogenic Diet.</a></h2><p>Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) precursor vitamin.

Here, we aimed to examine the physiological responses to high-dose NR supplementation in the context of a mildly obesogenic diet and to substantiate this with molecular data. An 18-week dietary intervention was conducted in male C57BL/6JRccHsd mice, in which a diet with 9000 mg NR per kg diet (high NR) was compared to a diet with NR at the recommended vitamin B3 level (control NR). Both diets were mildly obesogenic (40 en% fat).

Mice fed with high NR showed a reduced metabolic flexibility, a lower glucose clearance rate and aggravated systemic . This was consistent with molecular and morphological changes in eWAT, including sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)-mediated PPARγ (proliferator-activated receptor γ) repression, downregulated AKT/glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) signaling, an increased number of crown-like structures and macrophages, and an upregulation of pro-inflammatory gene markers.

Here, we aimed to examine the regulatory pathways whereby FGF21 mediates islet lipid metabolism in lipotoxicity-treated cells and animal models. Rat β-cell line (INS-1E cells) and islets isolated from C57/BL6J mice were exposed to palmitic acid (PA) with/without FGF21, mimicking lipotoxic conditions. Resultant  secretion and intracellular signaling were analyzed with Western blotting and RNA-seq. C57/BL6J and global FGF21 knockout (KO) mice were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) to induce lipotoxicity and given with a long-acting mimetic of FGF21.  and β-cell function were then assessed using homeostasis model assessment of  (HOMA-IR) and insulinogenic index. FGF21 ameliorated PA-induced lipid accumulation, reversed cell apoptosis, and enhanced glucose-stimulated  secretion (GSIS) as impaired by lipotoxicity in islet β-cells. Mechanistically, FGF21 exerted its beneficial effects through activation of AMPK-ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) pathway and peroxisome proliferation-activated receptors (PPARs) δ/γ signaling, thus increasing the levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A (CPT1A) and leading to increased fatty acid (FA) oxidation and reduced lipid deposition in β-cells. Interestingly, FGF21 reduced PA-induced cell death via restoration of the expression of apoptosis inhibitor Birc3. In vivo studies further showed that FGF21 is critical for islet insulinogenic capacity and normal function in the context of HFD-treated animals. FGF21 down-regulates islet cell lipid accumulation, probably via activation of AMPK-ACC and PPARδ/γ signaling, and reduces cell death under lipotoxicity, indicating that FGF21 is protective against lipotoxicity-induced β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis.© 2019 The Author(s).

The age, period and birth cohort effects on the mortality from esophageal cancer were examined using the age-period-cohort analysis.In Serbia, esophageal cancer mortality trend significantly increased from 1991 to 2015 in men (APC=+0.9%, 95%CI=0.3 to 1.4), but nonsignificantly increased in women (APC=+0.4%, 95%CI=-0.6 to 1.4). The age-specific mortality rates were increasing with age, but this trend has only been significant in men in the 50-59 years age group (APC = +1.5%, 95%CI= 0.8 to 2.3). The age-period-cohort analysis suggested statistically non-significant period and cohort effects, and local drifts for both genders (p>0.05 for all).The trend of esophageal cancer mortality should be elucidated in future analytical epidemiological studies in Serbia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647268>Borderline personality disorder traits associate with midlife cardiometabolic risk.</a></h2><p>There is growing interest in relationships between borderline personality disorder (BPD) pathology and physical health outcomes. Diagnostic BPD and BPD-related traits, for instance, have been shown to associate with self-reported cardiovascular disease and various cardiometabolic risk factors. However, potential confounding of these associations by comorbid depression, which itself contributes to risk for heart disease, remains unresolved, and previous research is limited by nearly uniform reliance on self-reported health status. In the present study, we examine the association of BPD traits and contemporaneously assessed depressive mood with instrumented measures of cardiometabolic risk in a midlife community sample ( = 1,295). BPD pathology was measured using dimensional, multi-informant trait measures; depressive symptomology was self-reported; and cardiometabolic risk was indexed via multiple indicators of , adiposity, dyslipidemia, and blood pressure. Structural equation modeling was used to estimate the effects of BPD traits and depressive symptoms on aggregated cardiometabolic risk, adjusting for their shared variance. Results showed both BPD features and depressive symptomatology related to the extent of cardiometabolic risk; when examined simultaneously, only BPD associated independently with risk indicators. In further supporting a link between BPD pathology and cardiovascular disease risk, these findings warrant future work to elucidate intervening behavioral and biological mechanisms.

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess the metabolic effects of PRL on glucose homeostasis in men with T2DM.Eighty male patients with T2DM compared with 25 male healthy controls matched with patients for age and weight were divided into four groups: Group (A): patients with T2DM on metformin ( = 29), Group (B): patients with T2DM on glyburide ( = 30), Group (C): patients with T2DM on glyburide plus metformin ( = 21), and Group (D): healthy male subjects as control ( = 25). Body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure measurements were determined. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycated hemoglobin, total cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, atherogenic index, fasting serum ,  (IR), and β-cell function of the pancreas were determined by homeostatic model assessment-2 (HOMA-IR). Furthermore, C-reactive protein and PRL serum level were determined in patients with T2DM and healthy control men.BMI of T2DM patients was higher as compared with control ( = 0.003). Combination therapy (glyburide plus metformin) in patients with T2DM showed better effect on most of glycemic indices and lipid profile than glyburide or metformin monotherapy ( < 0.05). PRL serum level was higher in patients with T2DM as compared with control ( = 0.001). PRL serum level was high in glyburide-treated patients as compared with metformin-treated patients ( = 0.002).This study concludes that elevated PRL serum level in patients with T2DM is associated with diabetic complications. Diabetic pharmacotherapy mainly metformin reduced PRL serum level in patients with T2DM through amelioration of IR.Copyright: © 2019 International Journal of Critical Illness and Injury Science.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621728>Effects of theabrownin on serum metabolites and gut microbiome in rats with a high-sugar diet.</a></h2><p>Evidence has proven that the gut microbiota is an important environmental factor contributing to obesity by altering host energy harvest and storage. We performed a high-throughput 16S rDNA sequencing association study and serum metabolomics profiling in rats with a high-sugar diet. Our studies revealed that the high sugar diet reduced the diversity of cecal microorganisms, while the combination of theabrownin and the high sugar diet increased the diversity of cecal microorganisms and promoted reproduction of Alloprevotella, Coprostanoligenes_group, Bacteroides, Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, Desulfovibrio, Intestinimonas, Alistipes, Bifidobacterium, Phascolarctobacterium, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010 and Staphylococcus. The combination also inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus, Prevotellaceae_Ga6A1_group and Tyzzerella. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio can be significantly reduced after the intervention of theabrownin in high sugar diet rats, and the reproduction of Bacteroides acidifaciens (BA) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus can be promoted. We found that the obesity-associated gut microbial species were linked to the changes in circulating metabolites. Serum levels of deoxycholic acid, cholic acid, 1H-indole-3-acetic acid, 3-indole acrylic acid and melatonin were negatively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but positively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum and Gut_metagenome. 2-Hydroxy-6-methylpyridin-3-carboxylic acid, l-homoserine, and 1,7-dimethylxanthine were positively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but negatively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, and Gut_metagenome. In a high sugar diet mode, theabrownin reduced the body weight and triglycerides and improved  mainly by targeting the reproduction of intestinal microorganisms such as BA, Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, Gut_metagenome and so on. A strong correlation between cecal microorganisms and serum metabolites, obesity and  was observed.

We investigated if prevailing serum 25-OH vitamin D might predict the body fat loss in a group of obese adolescents undergoing a residential weight loss program.In 92 (35 male) obese adolescents (aged 10.6 to 19 years) undergoing a residential weight loss program in Belgium, fasting serum 25-OH vitamin D (25-OH-D), , glucose and lipid levels were measured and body composition was assessed by Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA).Baseline median (range) serum 25-OH-D level was 17.7 µg/L (3.8 - 41.8). In total, 55 adolescents had a serum 25-OH-D below 20 µg/L. In 31 adolescents with a low baseline 25-OH-D level, median increase in serum 25-OH-D was 2.4 µg/L (-4.2 - 7.2) after 10 months. This resulted in normal 25-OH-D levels in seven adolescents, whereas median BMI decreased with 1.0 SDS and body fat percentage diminished with 9.9%. Obese adolescents with or without a 25-OH-D level below or above 20 µg/L at baseline had similar changes in body weight, BMI SDS, body fat percentage and body fat mass at the end of the program. The change in serum 25-OH-D did not correlate with change in serum , BMI SDS or body fat percentage and body fat mass.Vitamin D deficiency was present in 55 out of 92 obese adolescents at the start of the summer.

How long-term dietary BCAAs impact late-life health and lifespan is unknown. Here, we show that when dietary BCAAs are varied against a fixed, isocaloric macronutrient background, long-term exposure to high BCAA diets leads to hyperphagia, obesity and reduced lifespan. These effects are not due to elevated BCAA  or hepatic mTOR activation, but rather due to a shift in the relative quantity of dietary BCAAs and other AAs, notably tryptophan and threonine. Increasing the ratio of BCAAs to these AAs resulted in hyperphagia and is associated with central serotonin depletion. Preventing hyperphagia by calorie restriction or pair-feeding averts the health costs of a high BCAA diet. Our data highlight a role for amino acid quality in energy balance and show that health costs of chronic high BCAA intakes need not be due to intrinsic toxicity but, rather, a consequence of hyperphagia driven by AA imbalance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627416> Ameliorates Obesity through Activating Brown Adipose Tissue and Modulating the Composition of Gut Microbiota.</a></h2><p>Obesity is associated with disrupted energy homeostasis and intestinal dysbiosis. , traditional Chinese medicine for herbal therapy, contains a wide range of bioactive compounds and has a specific pharmacological function. However, its effects on obesity and related metabolic disorder have remained largely unexplored. In this study, we showed that the water extract of Caulis Spatholobi (WECS) has a significant effect in inhibiting body weight gain, decreasing adiposity, maintaining glucose homeostasis, reducing  and improving hepatic steatosis in diet-introduced obesity (DIO) mice. Besides, the administration of WECS significantly increased the expression levels of genes involved in the brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation and thermogenesis in DIO mice. Also, the activation of BAT treated with WECS was also confirmed in BAT primary cells. Mechanisms, the improvement of glucose homeostasis and  may be related to the upregulated MAPK and AMPK pathways in white adipose tissue (WAT) and BAT.

However, the association between BE and possible risk factors, including abdominal obesity (AO), metabolic syndrome (MetS),  (IR), and the microbiome has not reached a consensus and lacks a systematic assessment. The purpose of our study is to evaluate, quantify, and summarize the association between these factors and BE risk.A systematic search of Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases was performed to identify relevant studies before September 2018. Studies were estimated with the OR, the weighted mean difference (WMD), and the 95% CI by using a random effects model. Subgroup analysis and publication bias were also performed.A total of 46 citations were included in the analysis, and 119,273 subjects were analyzed (AO 13, MetS 15, IR 9, and microbiome: 9). The pooled results showed that AO (p < 0.01, OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.11-1.52, I2 = 31.9%), MetS (p < 0.01, OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.40-2.01, I2 = 87.6%), and IR (p < 0.01, WMD 0.23, 95% CI 0.11-0.35, I2 = 55.8%) were all significantly associated with an increased risk of BE, but except for the microbiome (p > 0.05, OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.66-2.43, I2 = 46.7%). In addition, subgroup analyses were stratified by waist-to-hip ratio, waist circumference, body mass index, diagnosis criteria, strain type, geographical region, and study design, respectively. Moreover, we observed no evidence of publication bias in Egger's and Begg's tests.Our study reveals that AO, MetS, and IR are significantly associated with BE risk, except for the microbiome.

Pre- and post-bariatric surgery thyroid function tests and thyroid ultrasonography parameters were compared.Four hundred seventy-two patients were included in the study. Mean weight loss after surgery was 30.7 ± 5.1 kg. TSH levels decreased statistically significantly parallel with weight loss and decreased BMI (p = 0.025) after bariatric surgery. However, no statistically significant change was observed in fT4 or fT3 levels (p > 0.05). A significant increase in thyroid parenchyma echogenicity, correlated with weight loss and time elapsed since surgery, was detected at ultrasonography (US) grayscale histogram analysis compared with muscle echogenicity (p = 0.032). An increase in echogenicity was even detected in patients with isoechoic thyroid parenchyma before surgery.

From April 2015 to October 2017, 15,492 consecutive patients with diabetes diagnosed within 1 year and aged ≥30 years were recruited from 46 tertiary care hospitals in 24 cities across China. Glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibody was assayed centrally and clinical data were collected locally. Classic type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were defined using the criteria of American Diabetes Association, Immunology of Diabetes Society and World Health Organization. MetS was defined using Chinese Diabetes Society's criteria. Logistic regression analysis was used to obtain odds ratios (OR) of determinants of MetS.  The overall prevalence of MetS was 66.5%, with the highest prevalence in T2DM (68.1%), followed by those in LADA (44.3%) and T1DM (34.2%) ( < 0.05 for all comparisons). After adjustment for traditional risk factors, T2DM had a 2.8-fold [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.36-3.37] MetS risk compared with LADA, whereas T1DM had significantly lower OR than LADA (OR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.50-0.92). After further adjustment for , the OR of T2DM vs. LADA was slightly reduced but the OR of T1DM vs. LADA was greatly attenuated to non-significance (OR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.70-1.33). In addition to types of diabetes, age, gender, geographical residence, education attainment, alcohol consumption and HOMA2-IR were independent determinants of MetS.

Increased consumption of unhealthy, calorie-dense foods, coupled with sedentary lifestyles, is the main factor contributing to a positive energy balance and the development of obesity. Leptin and  are key hormones implicated in pathogenesis of this disorder and are crucial for controlling whole-body energy homeostasis. Their respective function is mediated by the counterbalance of anorexigenic and orexigenic neurons located within the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus. Dysregulation of leptin and  signaling pathways within this brain region may contribute not only to the development of obesity, but also systemically affect the peripheral organs, thereby manifesting as metabolic diseases. Although the exact mechanisms detailing how these hypothalamic nuclei contribute to disease pathology are still unclear, increasing evidence suggests that altered DNA methylation may be involved. This review evaluates animal studies that have demonstrated diet-induced DNA methylation changes in genes that regulate energy homeostasis within the arcuate nucleus, and elucidates possible mechanisms causing hypothalamic leptin and  leading to the development of obesity and metabolic diseases.© 2019 The Authors.

The variables (biomarkers) are concentrations of fasting plasma glucose, , leptin, glucagon, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and very low density lipoprotein triglyceride (VLDLTG), as well as muscle lipids, hepatic lipids, pancreatic lipids, fat mass and mass of β-cells. The model predicts isocaloric high carbohydrate low fat (HCLF) diet and low carbohydrate high fat (LCHF) diet trajectories to health which vary in fat mass by at most a few kilograms at steady state. The LCHF trajectories to health are faster than isocaloric HCLF trajectories with respect to fat mass loss, although these trajectories may be slower initially if parameters are adjusting from HCLF values. On LC diets, leptin sensitivity and VLDLTG clearance are thought to increase. Increasing leptin sensitivity and VLDLTG clearance is predicted to lower lipids including fat mass and VLDLTG. The model predicts that changes in VLDLTG due to a change in diet happen rapidly, approaching steady state values after a few weeks, reflecting leptin sensitivity and VLDLTG clearance which are much harder to measure. The model predicts that if only  sensitivity increases on a LC diet, steady state fat mass would increase slightly. If leptin and  sensitivities increase concurrently, the combined effect could be a decrease in fat mass, consistent with the fact that increasing  sensitivity is often associated with fat mass loss in trials. The model predicts trajectories to fat Type II diabetes with hypertriglyceridemia due to high carbohydrate moderate fat diets, on which  rises before falling, as ectopic fat deposits increase; made fatter and more diabetic by higher lipid consumption.

Investigations revealed elevated serum and CSF anti-GAD antibody titres (98.6 and 53.4 μ/ml, respectively). Treatment included intravenous immunoglobulin and immunomodulation (infliximab and rituximab), improving her stiffness, but with no impact on the ataxia-related symptoms. Subsequent high-dose steroids led to diabetic ketoacidosis and unmasking of an -dependent diabetes mellitus.This case illustrates several key features: (1) the combined clinical picture of SPS and cerebellar ataxia is a rare phenotype associated with anti-GAD antibodies; (2) the cerebellar ataxia described was progressive and poorly responsive to immunomodulatory therapy; and (3) the potential for development of further autoimmune sequelae in response to immunosuppression, namely, the development of -dependent diabetes in response to treatment with high-dose oral steroids.© 2019 Jones et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654312>Clinical, hormonal and metabolic parameters in women with PCOS with different combined oral contraceptives (containing chlormadinone acetate versus drospirenone).</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder affecting 5-10% of women of reproductive age. It is characterized by chronic anovulation leading to menstrual disorders, and increased infertility. The syndrome can also manifest as hirsutism and acne.The aim of the study was to compare, over a duration of 6 months, the effects of drospirenone (DRSP) versus chlormadinone acetate (CMA) containing oral contraceptives (OCs) on clinical, hormonal, and metabolic parameters in 120 PCOS women.120 women with the diagnosis of PCOS according to the Rotterdam 2003 criteria were recruited to the study. All patients were divided to two treatment groups of OCs, containing: 3 mg DRSP/30 mcg EE (ethinylestradiol) (60 patients) and 2 mg CMA/30 mcg EE (60 patients). Clinical parameters such as hirsutismus and acne were evaluated. Metabolic parameters such as serum , glucose concentration, homeostatic model assessment of , body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were also measured. Among hormonal parameters, serum estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, prolactin, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and free thyroxine were measured.The use of both DRSP- or CMA-containing OCs provided similar positive therapeutic effects with regard to clinical, metabolic, and hormonal parameters. Among clinical parameters, like hirsutismus, after 6 months of continuous OC treatment, a statistically significant improvement was observed in both groups: DRSP (p <  0.0001) and CMA OC treatment (p < 0.0001). In addition, significant improvement was showed according to acne lesions both after DRSP (p < 0.0001) and CMA treatments (p < 0.0001). Among glucose,  levels and HOMA-IR, there were statistically significant higher levels in both groups after DRSP (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, p < 0.05) and CMA OC treatment (p < 0.02, p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001). Hormonal parameters such as LH, FSH, prolactin, testosterone and DHEA-S were statistically significant lower in both groups after DRSP (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, p < 0.01, p < 0,002, and p < 0.0001) and CMA OC treatment (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, p < 0.04, p < 0.002, and p < 0.0001).Further research, however, is needed not only to define optimal duration, and to clarify the effects of treatment on long-term metabolic outcomes, but also to explore different treatment options and possible combined therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632524>Mechanism of pomegranate ellagic polyphenols reducing  on gestational diabetes mellitus rats.</a></h2><p>Pomegranate ellagic polyphenols (PEP) has been used as a good medicine in many cultures throughout history. However, the mechanism of PEP regulated  on gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) rats is unclear. The main purpose of the present study was to explore the efficacy and mechanisms of PEP regulated in GDM rats.Then, ELISA assay indicated that the levels of serum RBP4, Hcy, GA and FFA were lower in PEP groups than GDM groups in a dose-dependent manner. TUNEL staining showed that PEP improved the pathological changes and inhibited the cell apoptosis in the pancreatic and placenta tissues, respectively.We found that PEP improved the weight of pregnant rats and fetal rats and the level of blood glucose, blood biochemical index,  in GDM rats. Results from H&E and immunohistochemical analysis found that PEP decreased the expressions of APN and Chemerin. Further, PEP decreased the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP), and increased the levels of 11β-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11β-HSD2) and PPARα-TRB3-AKT2-p-FOXO1-GLUT2 signal related to  sensitivity in a dose-dependent manner.In conclusion, we have demonstrated that PEP may be a candidate drug for the treatment of GDM and guide the clinical therapy.AJTR Copyright © 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620647>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease: metabolic diseases with systemic manifestations.</a></h2><p>The progression of liver disease is portrayed by several common, overarching signs and symptoms. Classically, these include findings such as spider angiomata, jaundice, palmar erythema, and as cirrhosis decompensates, ascites, variceal hemorrhage (VH), hepatic encephalopathy (HE), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Aside from these universal hallmarks among cirrhotics, patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcoholic liver disease (ALD) harbor their own distinct systemic associations and manifestations. NAFLD is tightly linked to metabolic syndrome, which appears to be a driving force for a multitude of comorbidities, such as , cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease (CKD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), as well as increased malignancy risk. ALD also maintains a variety of comorbidities congruent with systemic effects of chronic alcohol use. These findings are highlighted by cardiovascular conditions, neuronal damage, myopathy, nutritional deficiencies, chronic pancreatitis, in addition to increased malignancy risk. While a general, guideline-driven management for all cirrhotic patients remains imperative for minimizing risk of complications, a tailored treatment strategy is useful for patients with NAFLD and ALD who entertain their own constellation of unique systemic manifestations.2019 Translational Gastroenterology and Hepatology.

A series of reactions are involved in this process, including increased release of proinflammatory cytokines, and activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) receptors. Among the therapeutic tools available nowadays, physical exercise (PE) has a known hypoglycemic effect explained by complex molecular mechanisms, including an increase in  receptor phosphorylation, in AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity, in the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK) pathway, with subsequent activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), Rac1, TBC1 domain family member 1 and 4 (TBC1D1 and TBC1D4), in addition to a variety of signaling molecules, such as GTPases, Rab and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attached protein receptor (SNARE) proteins. These pathways promote greater translocation of GLUT4 and consequent glucose uptake by the skeletal muscle. Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase (PDK), atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) and some of its isoforms, such as PKC-iota/lambda also seem to play a fundamental role in the transport of glucose. In this sense, the association between autophagy and exercise has also demonstrated a relevant role in the uptake of muscle glucose. , in turn, uses a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent mechanism, while exercise signal may be triggered by the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

Here, we demonstrate that maternal high fat diet (HFD)-dependent  multigenerationally impairs synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. HFD downregulates BDNF and  signaling in maternal tissues and epigenetically inhibits BDNF expression in both germline and hippocampus of progeny. Notably, exposure of the HFD offspring to novel enriched environment restores Bdnf epigenetic activation in the male germline and counteracts the transmission of cognitive impairment to the next generations.

Studies have indicated, however, that the onset of NAFLD occurs during pre-diabetes, a condition that often precedes the onset of T2DM. Oleanolic acid has been reported to improve glucose homeostasis in diet-induced pre-diabetes; however, the effects of this triterpene on liver function have not been evaluated.This study was aimed at evaluating the therapeutic effects of oleanolic acid (OA) on selected markers of NAFLD in a pre-diabetes rat model.Pre-diabetes was induced by exposing Sprague Dawley rats to a high-fat high-carbohydrate diet for 20 weeks. The pre-diabetic rats were then treated with OA (80 mg/kg) or metformin (500 mg/kg) in the presence and absence of dietary interventions for a period of 12 weeks. The effects of OA were evaluated on parameters including plasma triglycerides (TGs), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles, bilirubin, AST, ALT, SREBP and antioxidant profile while the livers were collected for histological analysis.The findings of this study showed that the administration of OA to pre-diabetic rats ameliorated body/liver weights ratio and significantly decreased plasma triglycerides (TGs) and VLDL. Furthermore, OA also ameliorated hepatic oxidative stress, lowered the SREBP expression and intrahepatic TGs. In addition, OA administration decreased plasma concentrations of bilirubin and liver damage enzyme biomarkers.The findings of the study suggest that OA ameliorates the risk of developing pre-diabetes-related NAFLD through the prevention of intrahepatic fat accumulation while also lowering hepatic inflammation.© 2019 Gamede et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642820>Association between PNPLA3[G]/I148M variant, steatosis and fibrosis stage in hepatitis C virus - genetic matters.</a></h2><p>There is an established correlation between the PNPLA3 rs738409 C > G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected patients.

NlInR1 is strikingly homologous to the typical InR in insects and vertebrates, containing a ligand-activated intracellular tyrosine kinase catalytic domain. Herein, we report an optimized CRISPR/Cas9 system to induce mutations in the NlInR1 locus in BPH, consisting of a Cas9 plasmid that is specifically expressed in the germline via the Nlvasa promoter and versatile sgRNA expression plasmids under the control of the U6 promoter. We systematically evaluated the efficiency of injection mix compositions and demonstrated an appropriate combination of Cas9/sgRNA to target essential genes. Furthermore, we showed that homozygous mutants for the NlInR1 gene are early embryonic lethal, whereas heterozygous mutants grow more slowly, exhibit a severe reduction in body weight and wing size and live longer than the wild type. Interestingly, the severity of the mutant phenotype was different when targeting distinct important domains of the NlInR1 locus. The severity of the mutant phenotype is similar to that of /-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway deficiencies in vertebrates, suggesting a conserved function of NlInR1 in the regulation of development and longevity. Global expression profiling suggests that NlInR1 regulates many cellular processes in BPH, including , phototransduction, metabolism, endocytosis, longevity, biosynthesis and protein processing.

Diabetes is associated with low Mg, and hypomagnesemia is associated with , inflammation, and increased risk for cardiovascular disease. In subjects at high risk of inflammation and , supplementation of Mg alone ameliorates both phenotypes, slowing the development and progression of hepatic steatosis.

In response to FFAs, skeletal muscle can secrete a variety of cytokines. Irisin, one such muscle-secreted cytokine, can improve glucose tolerance, glucose uptake, and lipid metabolism. It is produced by the transmembrane protein fibronectin type Ⅲ domain containing 5 (FNDC5) by specific proteases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of the FNDC5 response to palmitate and their relationships with  in C2C12 myotubes. RNA sequencing analysis results from C2C12 myotubes treated with palmitate showed that palmitate could activate the TGF-β signaling pathway. Palmitate directly affected the expression of Smad3, but not its phosphorylation level, in C2C12 myotubes. Furthermore, knockdown and knockout of Smad3 alleviated the inhibitory effect of palmitate on the expression of FNDC5. In contrast, overexpression of Smad3 aggravated the inhibition of FNDC5 expression. There is a Smad3 binding motif in the -660 bp to -649 bp region of the Fndc5 promoter. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of this region also alleviated the inhibition of FNDC5 expression in response to palmitate. More importantly, inhibition of FNDC5 expression mediated by Smad3 led to a decrease in  sensitivity in C2C12 myotubes.

We investigated whether iron bioavailability is reduced in patients with NAFLD and contributes to reduced cardiorespiratory fitness.We collected information on weight-adjusted, submaximal physical work capacity (PWC), ultrasound-determined hepatic steatosis, iron indices, and hematologic and metabolic parameters from 390 female and 458 male participants of the Raine Study-a longitudinal study of disease development in 2868 children in Western Australia. X and linear regression analyses were used to compare characteristics of study participants according to NAFLD status at age 17 years.Fourteen percent of the cohort had NAFLD. PWC was significantly reduced in adolescents with NAFLD compared to adolescents without NAFLD (reduction of 0.17 W/kg, P=.0003, adjusted for sex and body mass index [BMI]). Iron bioavailability (assessed by mean corpuscular volume [MCV], mean corpuscular haemoglobin [MCH], transferrin saturation, and serum levels of iron) was inversely correlated with BMI in adolescents with NAFLD (P≤.01 for all, adjusted for sex) but not in adolescents without NAFLD (P>.30). MCV and MCH correlated with PWC (MCV, P=.002 for female and P=.0003 male participants; MCH, P=.004 for female and P=.01 for male participants), irrespective of NAFLD status. Reduced PWC was associated with lower transferrin saturation in adolescents with NAFLD (reduction of 0.012 W/kg per unit decrease in transferrin saturation, P=.007) but not in adolescents without NAFLD (reduction of 0.001 W/kg, P=.40), adjusted for sex. This association was independent of MCV or MCH.In a well-defined cohort of adolescents, we found NAFLD to be associated with decreased cardiorespiratory fitness, independent of BMI.

Patients and controls underwent anthropometric evaluation and measurement of fasting lipids, glucose, , homeostasis model assessment for  and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). TSH, free thyroxine (FT4 and FT3) and antithyroid autoantibodies (antithyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies) were also measured. Conventional echo-cardiography was used to assess EFT. Noninvasive ultrasound was used to measure carotid intima-media thickness and brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) responses.Compared to controls, patients had higher atherogenic index (AI) and hs-CRP (p = 0.001 for each). Conventional echocardiography revealed that patients with SH had higher EFT (p = 01) and significantly lower FMD response compared with the control (p = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, EFT values were significantly correlated with TSH (OR 1.2; 95% CI 1.04-1.34; p = 0.01), hs-CRP (OR 1.1; 95% CI 1.09-1.14; p = 0.001, AI (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.17-2.03; p = 0.001), and FMD response (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.14-2.53; p = 0.01).Our study demonstrated that EFT is higher in children with SH compared with controls and associated with FMD responses. Measurement of EFT by echocardiography in children with SH may help to identify those at high risk of developing subclinical atherosclerosis.© 2019 S.

Thus, the objective of the present study was to investigate whether and how oral administration of the ethanolic extract of  leaves (LECS) improves glucose and  homoeostasis, liver damage, and endothelial dysfunction in an experimental model of type 2 diabetes, the leptin-deficient  mice. Oxidative stress and protein expression of -dependent and  -independent signaling pathways were studied. Obese  ) vs. control () mice were treated daily with intragastric administration of either vehicle or LECS (200 mg/kg, per day) for 4 weeks. Fasting blood glucose, body weight, food intake, glucose and  tolerance, oxidative stress, and liver damage as well as vascular complications with respect to endothelial dysfunction were examined. Administration of LECS in obese mice significantly reduced blood glucose and  levels, improved glucose tolerance and  sensitivity, and restored the increase of circulating AST and ALT without modification of body weight and food intake. These effects were associated with increased activity of both  and AMPK pathways in the liver and skeletal muscles. Of particular interest, administration of LECS in obese mice completely prevented the endothelial dysfunction resulting from an increased NO and decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the aorta. Altogether, oral administration of LECS remarkably attenuates features of type 2 diabetes on glucose, hepatic inflammation, , endothelial function, and vascular oxidative stress, being as most of these effects are related to -dependent and -independent mechanisms. Therefore, this study points for the therapeutic potential of  in correcting both metabolic and vascular alterations linked to type 2 diabetes.Copyright © 2019 Camille Koffi et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660472>Three Novel Mutations I65S, R66S, and G86R Divulge Significant Conformational Variations in the PTB Domain of the IRS1 Gene.</a></h2><p> receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) is one of the major substrates for the IR, and their interaction mediates several downstream  signaling pathways. In this study, we have identified three novel mutations in the IRS1 gene of type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients, which reflected in the amino acid changes as I65S, R66S, and G86R in the phosphotyrosine binding domain of the IRS1 protein. The impact of these mutations on the structure and function of the IRS1 protein was evaluated through molecular modeling studies, and distinct conformational fluctuations were recorded. The variable binding affinities and positional displacement of these mutant models were observed in the ligand-binding cleft of IR. The mutant IRS1 models triggered conformational changes in the L1 domain of IR upon their binding.

An inverse association between body height and 2-hour postload plasma glucose (2hPG) has been demonstrated. Our aim was to evaluate the relationship between body surface area (BSA) and plasma glucose values during an OGTT.An OGTT was performed on 2659 individuals at increased cardiovascular risk aged between 45 and 70 years of age, who had not previously been diagnosed with diabetes or cardiovascular disease. Their BSA was calculated according to the Mosteller formula. Study subjects were divided into five BSA levels corresponding to 12.5, 25, 25, 25, and 12.5% of the total distribution.When adjusted for age, sex, waist circumference, alcohol intake, current smoking, and leisure-time physical activity, BSA level showed an inverse linear relationship with the 2hPG in all categories of glucose tolerance (p for linearity < 0.001). Moreover, the smaller the adjusted BSA of the study person, the higher the proportion of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes based on 2hPG in the OGTT.Body size has a considerable impact on the findings from a standardized OGTT. Smaller persons are more likely to be diagnosed as glucose intolerant than relatively larger sized individuals.This work was supported by the State Provincial Office of Western Finland, the Central Satakunta Health Federation of Municipalities, Satakunta Hospital District, and the Hospital District of Southwest Finland.Evidence before this study. We searched PubMed using the MeSH terms "glucose tolerance test", "body surface area", "body height", "body size", "glucose tolerance", "", "blood glucose" and "diabetes mellitus" on March 10, 2019 without language restrictions. We also used Cited Reference Search in Web of Science for relevant articles. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is standardized globally with a uniform glucose load of 75 g to all adults irrespective of body size. An inverse association between body height and 2-hour postload plasma glucose (2hPG) has been demonstrated. Several studies have shown that 2hPG predicts all-cause mortality better than elevated fasting glucose. However, body height or body surface area are not usually adjusted in epidemiological studies. It is well known that short adult stature is a risk factor for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Added value of this study. This is the first study to assess the relationship of body surface area and 2hPG in a typical primary care population at increased cardiovascular risk. Body surface area has a considerable impact on the result of a standardized OGTT. Smaller individuals are more likely to be diagnosed as glucose intolerant than relatively larger sized individuals. Implications of all the available evidence. There is a possibility that the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes made by an OGTT is a false positive result in a relatively small individual, and a false negative result in a relatively larger individual. Association of 2hPG concentrations and mortality may be influenced by body size as confounding factor. Given that the OGTT is a time and effort consuming test both for patients and laboratory personnel, validity of the OGTT for different body sizes should be reconsidered.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

There is a relationship between the high activity of this enzyme and the development of obesity and metabolic disorders. The inhibition of 11β-HSD1 has been shown to attenuate the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, , metabolic syndrome and other diseases mediated by excessive cortisol production. In this work, fifteen benzothiazole derivatives substituted with electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups were designed to explore their affinity for 11β-HSD1 using in silico methods. The results show that (E)-5-((benzo[d]thiazol-2-ylimino)(methylthio)methylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (C1) has good physicochemical properties and favorable interactions with 11β-HSD1 through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions in the catalytic site formed by Y183, S170 and Y177. Furthermore, C1 was synthesized and evaluated in vitro and ex vivo using clobenzorex (CLX) as a reference drug in obese Zucker rats. The in vitro results showed that C1 was a better inhibitor of human 11β-HSD1 than CLX. The ex vivo assay results demonstrated that C1 was capable of reducing 11β-HSD1 overexpression in mesenteric adipose tissue.

During aging, many alterations occur in the organism, which are associated with progressive impairment of metabolic pathways related to , autophagy dysfunction, and inflammation. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms through which NLRP3 inhibition may attenuate cardiac aging. Ablation of NLRP3-inflammasome protected mice from age-related increased  sensitivity, reduced IGF-1 and leptin/adiponectin ratio levels, and reduced cardiac damage with protection of the prolongation of the age-dependent PR interval, which is associated with atrial fibrillation by cardiovascular aging and reduced telomere shortening. Furthermore, old NLRP3 KO mice showed an inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and autophagy improvement, compared with old wild mice and preserved Nampt-mediated NAD levels with increased SIRT1 protein expression. These findings suggest that suppression of NLRP3 prevented many age-associated changes in the heart, preserved cardiac function of aged mice and increased lifespan.© 2019 The Authors.

Recently, a new score was developed to estimate body fat percentage (relative fat mass, RFM). We aimed to evaluate the value of RFM in predicting the presence and severity of NAFLD, compared with other anthropometric measurements.RFM, body mass index (BMI), and other anthropometric measurements were evaluated in two cohorts of subjects: a cohort from a Portuguese prospective epidemiological study (e_Cor) and morbidly obese patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD. We evaluated if RFM and BMI were related with the presence and severity of liver disease, which was assessed by noninvasive tools in the first cohort and by liver histology in the morbidly obese cohort. The independence of relations found in univariate analysis was assessed with multivariable logistic regression analysis.In the general population cohort, 744 subjects (48% male) were enrolled. BMI-defined obesity was present in 23% and RFM-defined obesity in 86%.  (IR) related with BMI-defined obesity (OR 4.37 [2.16-8.84]) and weight (OR 1.05 [1.02-1.08]) in men, and waist circumference (WC) (OR 1.07 [1.03-1.11]) in women. Dyslipidemia and hypertension related with RFM-defined obesity in men (OR 2.96 [1.36-6.47] and OR 5.37 [1.31-22.06], respectively). Ultrasound-diagnosed NAFLD in 33% related with weight in men (OR 1.03 [1.003-1.06] and WC in women (OR 1.06 [1.02-1.10]). In men, ALT elevation related with weight (OR 1.04 [1.02-1.07]). In women, advanced fibrosis (estimated by NAFLD Fibrosis Score) associated with BMI-defined obesity (OR 42.43 [3.61-498.13]). In the morbidly obese cohort, 152 subjects were enrolled, of whom 84% were female, 37% had steatohepatitis, and 9.4% had advanced fibrosis. Adiponectin associated inversely and leptin positively with RFM in men. The severity of steatosis increased linearly with BMI and WC in women. Higher BMI associated with steatohepatitis in women and advanced fibrosis in men.RFM-defined obesity better predicted dyslipidemia and hypertension (though not IR) and adipokine imbalance; however, it did not add value to BMI-defined obesity in predicting NAFLD or liver injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618644>Type 2 Diabetes Variants in the SLC16A11 Coding Region Are Not Loss-of-Function Mutations.</a></h2><p>This Matters Arising Response paper addresses the Hoch et al.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of genec susceptibility loci for obesity and T2DM, although the causal genes and mechanisms are largely unknown. SPRY2 is a candidate gene identified in GWAS of body fat percentage and T2DM, and has recently been linked to  production in pancreatic β-cells. In the present study, we aimed to further understand SPRY2 via functional characterisation in HepG2 cells, an in vitro model of human hepatocytes widely used to investigate T2DM and .CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing was used to target SPRY2 in HepG2 cells, and the functional consequences of SPRY2 knockout (KO) and overexpression subsequently assessed using glucose uptake and lipid droplet assays, measurement of protein kinase phosphorylation and RNA sequencing.The major functional consequence of SPRY2 KO was a significant increase in glucose uptake, along with elevated lipid droplet accumulation. These changes were attenuated, but not reversed, in cells overexpressing SPRY2. Phosphorylation of protein kinases across key signalling pathways (including Akt and mitogen activated protein kinases) was not altered after SPRY2 KO. Transcriptome profiling in SPRY2 KO and mock (control) cells revealed a number of differentially expressed genes related to cholesterol biosynthesis, cell cycle regulation and cellular signalling pathways. Phospholipase A2 group IIA (PLA2G2A) mRNA level was subsequently validated as significantly upregulated following SPRY2 KO, highlighting this as a potential mediator downstream of SPRY2.These findings suggest a role for SPRY2 in glucose and lipid metabolism in hepatocytes and contribute to clarifying the function of this gene in the context of metabolic diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652943>The CCR4-NOT Deadenylase Complex Maintains Adipocyte Identity.</a></h2><p>Shortening of poly(A) tails triggers mRNA degradation; hence, mRNA deadenylation regulates many biological events. In the present study, we generated mice lacking the  gene, which encodes an essential scaffold subunit of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex in adipose tissues (-AKO mice) and we examined the role of CCR4-NOT in adipocyte function. -AKO mice showed reduced masses of white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT), indicating abnormal organization and function of those tissues. Indeed, -AKO mice showed hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, , and glucose intolerance and they could not maintain a normal body temperature during cold exposure. Muscle-like fibrous material appeared in both WAT and BAT of -AKO mice, suggesting the acquisition of non-adipose tissue characteristics. Gene expression analysis using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) showed that the levels of adipose tissue-related mRNAs, including those of metabolic genes, decreased, whereas the levels of inflammatory response-related mRNAs increased. These data suggest that the CCR4-NOT complex ensures proper adipose tissue function by maintaining adipocyte-specific mRNAs at appropriate levels and by simultaneously suppressing mRNAs that would impair adipocyte function if overexpressed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652837>Deregulated Lysophosphatidic Acid Metabolism and Signaling in Liver Cancer.</a></h2><p>Liver cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide due to late diagnosis and scarcity of treatment options. The major risk factor for liver cancer is cirrhosis with the underlying causes of cirrhosis being viral infection (hepatitis B or C), metabolic deregulation (Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the presence of obesity and diabetes), alcohol or cholestatic disorders. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive phospholipid with numerous effects, most of them compatible with the hallmarks of cancer (proliferation, migration, invasion, survival, evasion of apoptosis, deregulated metabolism, neoangiogenesis, etc.). Autotaxin (ATX) is the enzyme responsible for the bulk of extracellular LPA production, and together with LPA signaling is involved in chronic inflammatory diseases, fibrosis and cancer. This review discusses the most important findings and the mechanisms related to ATX/LPA/LPAR involvement on metabolic, viral and cholestatic liver disorders and their progression to liver cancer in the context of human patients and mouse models. It focuses on the role of ATX/LPA in NAFLD development and its progression to liver cancer as NAFLD has an increasing incidence which is associated with the increasing incidence of liver cancer. Bearing in mind that adipose tissue accounts for the largest amount of LPA production, many studies have implicated LPA in adipose tissue metabolism and inflammation, liver steatosis, , glucose intolerance and lipogenesis. At the same time, LPA and ATX play crucial roles in fibrotic diseases. Given that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is usually developed on the background of liver fibrosis, therapies that both delay the progression of fibrosis and prevent its development to malignancy would be very promising. Therefore, ATX/LPA signaling appears as an attractive therapeutic target as evidenced by the fact that it is involved in both liver fibrosis progression and liver cancer development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630283>Beneficial effect of ER stress preconditioning in protection against FFA-induced adipocyte inflammation via XBP1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue inflammation is closely associated with the development of obesity and . Free fatty acids (FFAs) are a major inducer of obesity-related . Previously, we reported that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress potentially mediated retinal inflammation in diabetic retinopathy. The unfolded protein response (UPR) protects cells against damage induced by oxidative stress. X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) plays a major role in protecting cells by modulating the UPR. However, the link between ER stress and adipocyte inflammation has been poorly investigated. In the present study, we found that pretreatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with a low dose of ER stress inducer tunicamycin inhibited FFA-induced upregulated expression of inflammatory cytokines. In addition, FFAs induced phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB was largely inhibited by pretreatment with tunicamycin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Knockdown of XBP1 by siRNA markedly mitigated the protective effects of preconditioning against inflammation. Conversely, overexpression of XBP1 alleviated FFA-induced phosphorylation of IκB-α, IKKα/β, and NF-κB, which was accompanied by decreased inflammatory cytokine expression. Collectively, these results imply a beneficial role of ER stress preconditioning in protecting against FFA-induced 3T3-L1 adipocyte inflammation, which is likely mediated through inhibition of the IKK/NF-κB pathway via XBP1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661025>Association between cognitive impairment patient with solid cancer and .</a></h2><p>In an aging population, an increase in the number of elderly cancer patients with cognitive impairment is expected.

T2DM is correlated with obesity and most T2DM medications have been developed for enhancing  sensitivity. Silk protein fibroin (SPF) from spiders has been suggested as an attractive biomaterial for medical purposes. We generated transgenic rice (TR) expressing SPF and fed it to diabetic BKS.Cg-m+/+Lepr mice to monitor the changes in blood glucose levels and adipose tissue proteins associated with energy metabolism and  signaling. In the present study, the adipocyte size in abdominal fat in TR-SPF-fed mice was remarkably smaller than that of the control. Whereas the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-activated protein kinase and  receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) protein levels were increased in abdominal adipose tissues after TR-SPF feeding, levels of six-transmembrane protein of prostate 2 (STAMP2) proteins decreased. Phosphorylation of AMPK at threonine 172 and IRS1 at serine 307 and tyrosine 632 were both increased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice. Increased expression and phosphorylation of IRS1 at both serine 307 and tyrosine 632 in adipose tissues indicated that adipocytes obtained from abdominal fat in TR-SPF-fed mice were more susceptible to  signaling than that of the control. STAMP2 protein levels decreased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice, indicating that STAMP2 proteins were reducing adipocytes that were undergoing lipolysis. Taken together, this study showed that TR-SPF was effective in reducing blood glucose levels in diabetic mice and that concurrent lipolysis in abdominal adipocytes was associated with alterations of AMPK, IRS1, and STAMP2. Increased IRS1 expression and its phosphorylation by TR-SFP were considered to be particularly important in the induction of lipolysis in adipocytes, as well as in reducing blood glucose levels in this animal model.© Copyright 2019 The Korean Society of Developmental Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646303>27th Annual Meeting of the European Group for the study of , Lisbon, Portugal, 8-9th May 2019.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663815>Preventive Action of Sterculic Oil on Metabolic Syndrome Development on a Fructose-Induced Rat Model.</a></h2><p>The metabolic syndrome (MS) underlies metabolic disorders considered risk factors for the development of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, which are major causes of morbidity and mortality in most of the world.

We have previously demonstrated the role of obese adipose-derived stem cells (ob-ASC) and adipocytes (AD) in the mediation of inflammation through promotion of Th17 cells and activation of monocytes. Such an inflammation resulted in impaired ob-ASC adipogenesis and AD  response. In the present study, we investigated the role of IL-17A in the impairment of these functions.With this aim, we used Secukinumab, a potent human anti-IL17A monoclonal antibody which has been approved for the treatment of some IL-17A related inflammatory diseases, notably Psoriasis. This antibody was added or not to phytohemagglutinin A-activated co-cultures of ob-ASC and mononuclear cells. The conditioning media of those co-cultures were harvested and added to AD ongoing differentiation from ob-ASC. Adipogenesis,  sensitivity and secretion of inflammatory cytokines were then measured using qRT-PCR, Western blots and ELISAs, respectively.Surprisingly, we did not observe any direct effect of IL-17A on ob-ASC adipogenesis, despite sensitivity of ob-ASC to IL-17A. Moreover, IL-17A blockade, with the help of Secukinumab, did not lead to the recovery of adipogenesis and  response, when these functions were impaired by the presence of an inflammatory conditioning medium. However, the up-regulation of IL6 and IL1B mRNA expression by AD submitted to inflammatory conditioning medium was inhibited in the presence of Secukinumab, which indicates that IL-17A may play a role in the propagation of inflammation towards AD.we show herein that IL-17A does not play a major role in the impairment of adipogenesis and/or  mediated by an inflammatory environment, but contributes to the propagation of inflammation in human obese adipose tissues. This suggests a beneficial effect of anti-IL17A mAb in inflammatory pathologies, where obesity contributes to poorer response to biologic treatments.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Aberrant endometrial decidualization in early pregnancy was linked to pregnancy complications. In this study, we aimed to test whether elevated  levels compromise decidualization in early-stage pregnancy. C57BL/6J mice in high -exposed group were given a subcutaneous injection of recombinant  at a concentration of 0.05 IU daily. During decidualization in early pregnancy, serum levels of , E2, P4, LH, FSH and blood glucose were significantly altered in mice treated with high  levels. The number of embryo implantation sites and endometrial decidual markers BMP2, ER, PR was significantly decreased by high  levels in vivo. Artificial decidual induction in primary mouse endometrial stromal cells and immortal human endometrial stromal cells line were all compromised after treated with 100 nmol/L  levels. All these results on flow cytometry, transmission electron microscopy and western blotting of Bax, Bcl2, cleaved Caspase3, cleaved PARP proteins level showed that decidual cells apoptosis was significantly decreased. Mitochondrial transmembrane potential also significantly increased by the influence of high  levels. PI3K and p-Akt were much higher after  exposure and the compromised decidualization by high  treatment was rescued by PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002 both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, we demonstrated that elevated  levels could compromise mice decidualization in early-stage pregnancy and PI3K/p-Akt-regulated apoptosis was essential for this role. It provides a clue for future investigation on compromised reproduction in women with hyperinsulinemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631000>Influence of post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass weight recidivism on : a 3-year follow-up.</a></h2><p>Although some early metabolic benefits provided by bariatric surgery are known to occur regardless of weight loss, the impact of mid- to long-term weight recidivism after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) on metabolic outcomes is not profoundly understood.To investigate the effect of weight recidivism on  among nondiabetic individuals with morbid obesity after RYGB during a 3-year follow-up.Public tertiary university hospital.This is a cohort study based on a prospectively collected database of a public tertiary university hospital, which enrolled individuals with morbid obesity who underwent RYGB and were followed-up for 3 years. Weight loss was classified into the following 3 categories: (1) no weight regain; (2) expected regain (regain ≤20% of the maximum weight loss); and (3) obesity recidivism (regain >20% of the maximum weight loss). Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) values were compared over time.Of 100 patients, 20% presented obesity recidivism and 52% an expected regain after 3 years of surgery; 28% showed no regain. The recidivism group presented a significant increase in HOMA 3 years after surgery (P = .02). The recidivism group presented a significantly higher HOMA 3 years after surgery than the observed in the other groups (P < .001), as well as a significantly higher percentage of HOMA variation throughout the follow-up (P = .02).Weight recidivism after RYGB was significantly associated with a worsening of  among nondiabetic individuals with morbid obesity. Thus, weight loss seems to play a significant role in the maintenance of the early metabolic improvement achieved after RYGB.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Bariatric Surgery.

Although associated with side effects when systemically administered, biphosphonates (BPs) play a positive role in diabetic osteoporosis treatment. We hypothesized that local BP therapy would prevent decayed implant osseointegration under T2DM conditions. To assess cell proliferation and determine the optimal BP concentration, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) were treated with BPs at various relatively low concentrations (10 mmol/L) for different periods of time. Our in vitro study results demonstrated that BP application reversed the process by which high glucose inhibits bone formation and stimulates bone resorption through osteoclast-specific gene and protein expression (P<0.05). In vivo, fat accumulation and  were induced in T2DM rats. We used crosslinked hyaluronic acid as the drug delivery vehicle for BPs to ensure that BPs administered at a dose of 30 µg/kg could settle into the prepared hole in rats. Thereafter, implants were inserted into cylindrical holes of a specific size, created parallel to the long axis of the femora. The outcomes of the in vivo study revealed that BPs promoted bone formation, which reversed the reduction in the DM group according to double fluorescence labeling, micro-CT, biomechanical and histomorphometric analyses (P<0.05). Furthermore, intergroup comparisons revealed significant correlation coefficients (P<0.05) between the micro-CT and biomechanical parameters. Therefore, local administration of BPs could stimulation bone remodeling and represent an effective treatment strategy for preventing decayed implant osseointegration under T2DM conditions.AJTR Copyright © 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646128>Report of the European Group for the Study of  annual meeting, Dublin, 4-6th May 2017.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634780>High glucose inhibits myogenesis and induces  by down-regulating AKT signaling.</a></h2><p>A high glucose level is usually considered to be the factor that induces tissue and cell dysfunction and damage, commonly known as "glucose toxicity".This study aimed to explore the effects and the potential molecular mechanisms of high glucose on myoblast differentiation and  sensitivity.C2C12 cells were cultured in differentiation medium containing 25, 40, or 60 mM glucose for 1, 3, or 5 days. E-MHC positive area and GLUT4 fluorescence were evaluated through Immunofluorescence. The expression of Myf5, MyoD, myogenin were measured by performing western blot and qRT-PCR. The protein expression of GLUT4 on cell membrane and glucose uptake in C2C12 myotubes were measured through western blot and 2-NBDG assay. AKT activator SC79 and inhibitor MK2206 was utilized to reveal the important role of AKT signaling in myogenesis and  sensitivity inhibited by high glucose.60 mM glucose inhibits myogenesis by decreasing the expression of MyoD and myogenin, and induces  by reducing both basal and -stimulated GLUT4 expressions and glucose uptakes. The influences of high glucose on myogenesis and IR was related to decreased AKT activation. SC79 rescued the inhibition of high glucose on myogenesis and attenuated IR. MK2206 inhibits the myogenic differentiation and induces IR.The present study reveals that high glucose inhibited myogenisis accompanied by inducing IR, through AKT signaling inhibition, which may help to further research for resisting degenerative muscular diseases caused by glucose metabolism disorders.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

We examined sex differences in distinct components of oxygen transport and utilization during exercise using linear and logistic regression models. The data were analyzed from June 2018 to May 2019.Resting and exercise gas exchange and hemodynamic parameters obtained during cardiopulmonary exercise testing.Of 295 participants, 121 (41.0%) were men (mean [SD] age, 64 [12] years) and 174 (59.0%) were women (mean [SD] age, 61 [13] years). Compared with men, women with HFpEF in this tertiary referral cohort had fewer comorbidities, including diabetes, , and hypertension, and a more favorable adipokine profile. Exercise capacity was similar in men and women (percent predicted peak oxygen [O2] consumption: 66% in women vs 68% in men; P = .38), but women had distinct deficits in components of the O2 pathway, including worse biventricular systolic reserve (multivariable-adjusted analyses: ΔLVEF β = -1.70; SE, 0.86; P < .05; ΔRVEF β = -2.39, SE=0.80; P = .003), diastolic reserve (PCWP/CO: β = 0.63; SE, 0.31; P = .04), and peripheral O2 extraction (C(a-v)O2 β=-0.90, SE=0.22; P < .001)).Despite a lower burden of cardiometabolic disease and a similar percent predicted exercise capacity, women with HFpEF demonstrated greater cardiac and extracardiac deficits, including systolic reserve, diastolic reserve, and peripheral O2 extraction. These sex differences in cardiac and skeletal muscle responses to exercise may illuminate the pathophysiology underlying the development of HFpEF and should be investigated further.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651303>Association between plasma adipsin level and mild cognitive impairment in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes: a cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p>The adipokine adipsin contributes to  (IR), inflammation, and obesity, which are all regarded as high-risk factors for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This research aimed to uncover the role of adipsin in Chinese type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) population with early cognitive dysfunction and determine whether adipsin contributes to diabetic MCI caused by IR.In our study, 126 patients with T2DM were enrolled. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to assess cognitive impairment. Demographic data and neuropsychological test results were evaluated. Plasma adipsin level was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.The MCI group (n = 57) presented higher plasma adipsin levels compared with the healthy controls (p = 0.018). After adjustment for educational attainment, and age, begative correlations were found between plasma adipsin levels and MoCA, Mini Mental State Exam, and Verbal Fluency Test scores(r = - 0.640, p < 0.001; r = - 0.612, p < 0.001; r = - 0.288, p = 0.035; respectively).

The olive oil polyphenol hydroxytyrosol (HT) contributes to Mediterranean diet cardiometabolic benefits through mechanisms still partially unknown. We investigated HT (1 and 10 μmol/L) effects on gene expression (mRNA and microRNA) related to inflammation induced by 10 ng/mL tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in human Simpson-Golabi-Behmel Syndrome (SGBS) adipocytes. At real-time PCR, HT significantly inhibited TNF-α-induced mRNA levels, of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, C-X-C Motif Ligand-10, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, vascular endothelial growth factor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, cyclooxygenase-2, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, matrix metalloproteinase-2, Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase-1, and glutathione peroxidase, as well as surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and reverted the TNF-α-mediated inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1α, and glucose transporter-4. We found similar effects in adipocytes stimulated by macrophage-conditioned media. Accordingly, HT significantly counteracted miR-155-5p, miR-34a-5p, and let-7c-5p expression in both cells and exosomes, and prevented NF-κB activation and production of reactive oxygen species. HT can therefore modulate adipocyte gene expression profile through mechanisms involving a reduction of oxidative stress and NF-κB inhibition. By such mechanisms, HT may blunt macrophage recruitment and improve AT inflammation, preventing the deregulation of pathways involved in obesity-related diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642431>[Level of circulating Alarin in obese children and its association with ].</a></h2><p>To study the level of circulating Alarin in obese children and its association with various metabolic parameters.A total of 86 obese children with a body mass index (BMI) above the 95th percentile were enrolled as the obesity group, and 82 healthy children, matched for age and sex, with a BMI below the 85th percentile were enrolled as the healthy control group.

Hypoxia is the hallmark feature and the most important pathophysiologic pathway of OSA. Recently, receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) was found to be involved in the pathogenesis of  (IR). However, whether RAGE contributes to the IR of adipocytes under hypoxia remains unknown. In the present study, we found that hypoxia reduced glucose consumption and upregulated RAGE expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in a time-dependent manner. RAGE knockdown efficiently attenuated hypoxia-induced IR, including inhibiting serine phosphorylation of  receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), increasing the expression of phosphorylated Akt (Ser473), and improving -stimulated glucose uptake. In addition, hypoxia activated nuclear transcription factor κB (NF-κB). However, RAGE knockdown inhibited hypoxia-induced NF-κB activity in adipocytes. Finally, an NF-κB inhibitor (PDTC) significantly reduced the hypoxia-induced upregulation of RAGE expression and IR. Therefore, this study indicates that the RAGE/NF-κB pathway mediates hypoxia-induced IR in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and suggests that RAGE may be a potential therapeutic target for suppressing IR in OSA.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

It is important to combat the negative effects on age-associated hormonal decline, BP, and body composition by incorporating appropriate lifestyle interventions, such as exercise. We sought to examine the effects of a 12-week  band exercise training program on aging-related hormones including estradiol, growth hormone (GH), -like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), BP, and body composition in postmenopausal women with stage 1 hypertension.Postmenopausal women with stage 1 hypertension (n = 20) were recruited and randomly assigned to a 12-week  band exercise training group (EX, n = 10) or control group (CON, n = 10). The EX group performed a total-body  band exercise training program. Levels of estradiol, GH, IGF-1, DHEA-S, as well as BP and body composition were assessed before and after 12 weeks.There were significant group by time interactions (P < 0.05) for estradiol, GH, IGF-1, DHEA-S, and lean body mass, which significantly increased (P < 0.05), and systolic BP, total body mass, body mass index, and body fat percentage, which significantly decreased (P < 0.05) after EX compared to no changes in CON.

Methods The wild-type (WT) and TLR2 knockout (TLR2) C57BL/6 male mice, aged 28 days, were selected, with 12 mice in each group. The genotype of each mouse was identified by PCR. After mice were fed with basic diet for 3 months, the glucose tolerance test (GTT) and  test (ITT) were performed. The mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood were stimulated with GM-CSF/IFN-γ and M-CSF/IL-4/IL-13, respectively, to induce differentiation to M1-like and M2-like macrophages. The CD11b, F4/80, CD11c, CD206 and early growth response 2 (EGR2) were detected by flow cytometry to determine the phenotype of macrophages. The levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10 in the culture supernatant of macrophages were detected using ELISA. Results The result of PCR identification was consistent with the genotype of mice. Compared to WT mice, TLR2 mice exhibited the significantly improved glycemic control at 30 min during GTT and the significantly increased  sensitivity at 15 minutes during ITT. The flow cytometry showed that M1 markers decreased and M2 macrophages increased in the TLR2 mice. ELISA showed that the levels of IL-6 and TNF-α significantly decreased in the culture supernatant of M1 macrophages, while the level of IL-10 significantly increased in the culture supernatant of M2 macrophages in TLR2 mice compared with WT mice. Conclusion TLR2 signal has an effect on the polarization of macrophages and makes macrophages tend to switch to M1 phenotype. A higher number of pro-inflammatory factors secreted by M1 macrophages contribute to a low-grade inflammation state in the body, which leads to a decrease in glucose tolerance and  sensitivity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626149>Impact of metabolic syndrome-related factors on the development of benign prostatic hyperplasia and lower urinary tract symptoms in Asian population.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to investigate the metabolic syndrome-related risk factors for the development of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in healthy men.A total of 4880 healthy men who underwent transrectal ultrasonography at our hospital during routine health examinations were included in this study.

As body mass index (BMI) class increased, mean IGF-1 increased and mean IGFBP3 decreased, but these trends were not statistically significant. In cohort 2, aVAT was significantly positively correlated with BMI. The patients in the third aVAT tertiles had significantly shorter distant disease-free survival (dDFS) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy setting. In multivariate analysis, aVAT and VAT-HU were significantly associated with shorter dDFS.High aVAT and low-quality VAT were associated with poor survival outcome, increased  levels, and .

The addition of PBM in neurodegenerative diseases is a dual modality that is at present gaining traction as it is safe, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory for treating neurodegeneration with photons that stimulate mitochondria increasing adenosine triphosphate and proteasomes increasing misfolded protein removal. Neurofeedback provides neural plasticity with an increase in brain-derived nerve factor mRNA and an increase in dendrite production and density in the hippocampus coupled with overall growth in dendrites, density, and neuronal survival.  Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology is the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein neurofibrillary tangles and subsequently amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques. PBM and neurobiofeedback (NBF)address the multiple gene expression and upregulation of multiple pathogenic pathway inflammation, reactive oxidative stress, mitochondrial disorders, , methylation defects, regulation of neuroprotective factors, and regional hypoperfusion of the brain. There is no human evidence to suggest a clinical therapeutic benefit from using consistent light sources while significantly increasing safety concerns.  A PBM test with early- to mid-Alzheimer's was reported in 2017, consisting of a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in a small pilot group of early- to mid-dementia subjects under Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Clinical Trial.  PBM-treated subjects showed that active treatment subjects tended to show greater improvement in the functioning of the executive: clock drawing, immediate recall, practical memory, and visual attention and task switching (Trails A&B). A larger study using the CerebroLite helmet in Temple Texas again of subjects in a double-blind, placebo-controlled IRB-approved FDA Clinical Trial demonstrated gain in memory and cognition by increased clock drawing.  Next-generation trials with the Cognitolite for Parkinson's disease subjects will incorporate the insights regarding significant bilateral occipital hypocoherence deficits gained from the quantitative EEG analyses. Future applications will integrate noninvasive stimulation delivery, including full-body and transcranial and infrared light with pulsed electromagnetic frequencies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634771>The depressogenic potential of added dietary sugars.</a></h2><p>Added sugars are ubiquitous in contemporary Western diets. Although excessive sugar consumption is now robustly associated with an array of adverse health consequences, comparatively little research has thus far addressed its impact on the risk of mental illness. But ample evidence suggests that high-dose sugar intake can perturb numerous metabolic, inflammatory, and neurobiological processes. Many such effects are of particular relevance to the onset and maintenance of depressive illness, among them: systemic inflammation, gut microbiota disruption, perturbed dopaminergic reward signaling, , oxidative stress, and the generation of toxic advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). Accordingly, we hypothesize that added dietary sugars carry the potential to increase vulnerability to major depressive disorder, particularly at high levels of consumption. The present paper: (a) summarizes the existing experimental and epidemiological research regarding sugar consumption and depression vulnerability; (b) examines the impact of sugar ingestion on known depressogenic physiological processes; and (c) outlines the clinical and theoretical implications of the apparent sugar-depression link. We conclude that the extant literature supports the hypothesized depressogenic impact of added dietary sugars, and propose that an improved understanding of the effects of sugar on body and mind may aid in the development of novel therapeutic and preventative measures for depression.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This review examines the tissue distribution of the hcrt/orexin system and the variety of biological activities attributed to it. Factors that either stimulate or inhibit the expression of hcrt/orexin system were also addressed in addition to its link to obesity, and  and glucose metabolism. Hcrt/orexin ligands and receptors have been localized to different parts of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Hcrt/orexin, orexin 1 and orexin 2 receptors are also present in body fluids (cerebrospinal fluid, blood) and in the exocrine (pancreas, salivary, lacrimal) as well as endocrine (pancreatic islets, pituitary, adrenal) glands. Several factors including stress, glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, glutamate, nicotine, glucose, hypoglycemia stimulate the expression of Hcrt/orexin system, but it is inhibited by ageing, bone morphogenetic protein, hypoxia/hypercapnia, melanocortin receptor accessory protein 2 and glucagon. Literature reports show that hcrt/orexin can significantly increase  secretion from normal and diabetic rat pancreata. Moreover, several studies reported that the tissue expression of glucose transporter type 4 is markedly higher after treatment with orexin. Hcrt/orexin also decreases blood glucose concentration and reduces . It reduces obesity by increasing browning of fat cells and energy expenditure. Taken together, hcrt/orexin modulates obesity and the metabolism of glucose and .

Most epidemiological evidence on the association between BPA and diabetes is from cross-sectional studies or longitudinal studies with single urinary measurements. No prospective study has examined exposure to BPA analogs such as bisphenol S (BPS) in relation to incident type 2 diabetes.We aimed to investigate whether exposure to BPA and BPS, assessed at up to two time points, was associated with the incidence of type 2 diabetes.We performed a case-cohort study on 755 participants without diabetes at baseline and followed-up over 9 y as part of the French prospective cohort Data from an Epidemiological Study on the  Syndrome (D.E.S.I.R.). BPA-glucuronide (BPA-G) and BPS-glucuronide (BPS-G) were assessed in fasting spot urine samples collected during the health examinations at baseline and 3 y later. Associations with incident diabetes were examined using Prentice-weighted Cox regression models adjusted for potential confounders.A total of 201 incident cases of type 2 diabetes were diagnosed over the follow-up, including 30 in the subcohort. Compared with participants with the lowest average BPA exposure (below the first quartile), participants in the second, third, and fourth quartile groups of exposure had a near doubling of the risk of type 2 diabetes, with a hazard ratio  2.56 (95% CI: 1.16, 5.65), 2.35 (95% CI: 1.07, 5.15), and 1.56 (95% CI: 0.68, 3.55), respectively. The detection of BPS-G in urine at one or both time points was associated with incident diabetes, with an  2.81 (95% CI: 1.74, 4.53).This study shows positive associations between exposure to BPA and BPS and the incidence of type 2 diabetes, independent of traditional diabetes risk factors. Our results should be confirmed by recent, population-based observational studies in different populations and settings. Overall, these findings raise concerns about using BPS as a BPA substitute. Further research on BPA analogs is warranted. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5159.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646287>26th Annual Meeting of the European Group for the study of , Lille, France, 7-8th June 2018.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620670>Advanced Lipoprotein Analysis Shows Atherogenic Lipid Profile That Improves After Metreleptin in Patients with Lipodystrophy.</a></h2><p>Patients with lipodystrophy have dyslipidemia and . Leptin treatment with metreleptin in lipodystrophy decreases  and lowers triglycerides without changing high-density lipoprotein. Detailed measurement of lipoprotein particles with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can offer insights into cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and lipid metabolism beyond a standard lipid panel. We hypothesized that patients with lipodystrophy would have a more atherogenic lipid profile than controls at baseline, which would be ameliorated with metreleptin treatment.To characterize the lipoprotein profile in patients with lipodystrophy compared with controls and to evaluate effects of metreleptin treatment.Patients with lipodystrophy (N = 17) were studied before and after metreleptin for 2 weeks and 6 months and compared with 51 -sensitive sex-matched controls.Lipoprotein profiles were measured by NMR with the LP4 deconvolution algorithm, which reports triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles (TRLPs), high-density lipoprotein particles (HDLPs), and low-density lipoprotein particles (LDLPs).Patients with lipodystrophy had elevated large TRLPs and smaller HDLPs and LDLPs compared with controls. Five patients with lipodystrophy had chylomicrons, compared with zero controls. Metreleptin decreased the size and concentration of TRLPs, eliminated chylomicrons in all but one patient, decreased LDLPs, and increased LDLP size. Metreleptin treatment did not have major effects on HDLPs.Patients with lipodystrophy had an atherogenic lipoprotein profile at baseline consistent with elevated CVD risk, which improved after metreleptin treatment. The presence of fasting chylomicrons in a subset of patients with lipodystrophy suggests saturation of chylomicron clearance by lipoprotein lipase.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Endocrine Society 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651513>Correlation of serum vitamin D, adipose tissue vitamin D receptor, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ in women with gestational diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common complication during pregnancy. Obesity and overweight are closely related to metabolic diseases and diabetes. However, the role of adipose tissue in the pathogenesis of GDM remains to be studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation of vitamin D (VD) levels, VD receptor (VDR), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) expression with GDM in overweight or obese women.One hundred and forty pregnant women with full-term single-birth cesarean-section were selected as the study subjects and grouped (70 GDM women, including 35 non-overweight/non-obese women [group G1] and 35 women with overweight or obesity [group G2]; 70 pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance, including 35 non-overweight/non-obese women [group N1] and 35 overweight/obese women [group N2]). The levels of serum VD, blood biochemistry, and adiponectin were compared in these women. Subcutaneous adipose tissue was isolated from the abdominal wall incision. VDR and PPARγ messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript levels in these adipose tissues were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The differences between the levels of PPARγ protein and phosphorylated PPARγ Ser273 were detected by Western blotting.The serum VD level of GDM women was lower in comparison to that of women with normal glucose tolerance (G1 vs. N1: 20.62 ± 7.87 ng/mL vs. 25.85 ± 7.29 ng/mL, G2 vs. N2: 17.06 ± 6.74 ng/mL vs. 21.62 ± 7.18 ng/mL, P < 0.05), and the lowest in overweight/obese GDM women. VDR and PPARγ mRNA expression was higher in the adipose tissues of GDM women in comparison to that of women with normal glucose tolerance (VDR mRNA: G1 vs. N1: 210.00 [90.58-311.46] vs. 89.34 [63.74-159.92], G2 vs. N2: 298.67 [170.84-451.25] vs. 198.28 [119.46-261.23], PPARγ mRNA: G1 vs. N1: 100.72 [88.61-123.87] vs. 87.52 [66.37-100.04], G2 vs. N2: 117.33 [100.08-149.00] vs. 89.90 [76.95-109.09], P < 0.05), and their expression was the highest in GDM + overweight/obese women. VDR mRNA levels positively correlated with the pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), pre-delivery BMI, fasting blood glucose (FBG), homeostasis model assessment of  (HOMA-IR), and PPARγ mRNA while it negatively correlated with the VD and the adiponectin levels (r = 0.395, 0.336, 0.240, 0.190, 0.235, -0.350, -0.294, respectively, P < 0.05). The degree of PPARγ Ser273 phosphorylation increased in obese and GDM pregnant women. PPARγ mRNA levels positively correlated with pre-pregnancy BMI, pre-delivery BMI, FBG, HOMA-IR, serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, free fatty acid, and VDR mRNA, while it negatively correlated with the VD and adiponectin levels (r = 0.276, 0.199, 0.210, 0.230, 0.182, 0.214, 0.270, 0.235, -0.232, -0.199, respectively, P < 0.05).Both GDM and overweight/obese women had decreased serum VD levels and up-regulated VDR and PPARγ mRNA expression in adipose tissue, which was further higher in the overweight or obese women with GDM. VD may regulate the formation and differentiation of adipocytes through the VDR and PPARγ pathways and participate in the occurrence of GDM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646127>Metabolic clinic for individuals with HIV/AIDS: a commitment and vision to the future of HIV services.</a></h2><p>One of the biggest current challenges in managing an ageing cohort living with the HIV is handling dyslipidaemia, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

A portion of osteocalcin remains uncarboxylated (uncarboxylated osteocalcin, GluOC) that is released into blood where it functions as a hormone to regulate  secretion and  sensitivity. As  is closely associated with metabolic syndrome, this study is aimed to elucidate how GluOC regulates glucose and lipid metabolism in KKAy mice, an animal model displaying obese, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, , and hepatic steatosis. GluOC (3, 30 ng/g per day, ig) was orally administered to female KKAy mice for 4 weeks. Whole-body  sensitivity, glucose metabolism, hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia were examined using routine laboratory assays. We found that GluOC administration significantly enhanced  sensitivity in KKAy mice by activating hepatic IRβ/PI3K/Akt pathway and elevated the whole-body  sensitivity with decreased FPI and HOMA-IR index. Furthermore, GluOC administration alleviated hyperglycemia through suppressing gluconeogenesis and promoting glycogen synthesis in KKAy mice and in cultured hepatocytes in vitro. Moreover, GluOC administration dose-dependently ameliorated dyslipidemia and attenuated hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice by inhibiting hepatic de novo lipogenesis and promoting fatty-acid β-oxidation. These results demonstrate that GluOC effectively enhances hepatic  sensitivity, improves hyperglycemia and ameliorates hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice, suggesting that GluOC could be a promising drug candidate for treating metabolic syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632301>3-Weeks of Exercise Training Increases Ischemic-Tolerance in Hearts From High-Fat Diet Fed Mice.</a></h2><p>Physical activity is an efficient strategy to delay development of obesity and , and thus the progression of obesity/diabetes-related cardiomyopathy. In support of this, experimental studies using animal models of obesity show that chronic exercise prevents the development of obesity-induced cardiac dysfunction (cardiomyopathy). Whether exercise also improves the tolerance to ischemia-reperfusion in these models is less clear, and may depend on the type of exercise procedure as well as time of initiation. We have previously shown a reduction in ischemic-injury in diet-induced obese mice, when the exercise was started prior to the development of cardiac dysfunction in this model. In the present study, we aimed to explore the effect of exercise on ischemic-tolerance when exercise was initiated after the development obesity-mediated. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 20-22 weeks, where they were subjected to high-intensity interval training (HIT) during the last 3 weeks of the feeding period. Sedentary HFD fed and chow fed mice served as controls. Left-ventricular (LV) post-ischemic functional recovery and infarct size were measured in isolated perfused hearts. We also assessed the effect of 3-week HIT on mitochondrial function and myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO). Sedentary HFD fed mice developed marked obesity and , and demonstrated reduced post-ischemic cardiac functional recovery and increased infarct size. Three weeks of HIT did not induce cardiac hypertrophy and only had a mild effect on obesity and . Despite this, HIT improved post-ischemic LV functional recovery and reduced infarct size. This increase in ischemic-tolerance was accompanied by an improved mitochondrial function as well as reduced MVO. The present study highlights the beneficial effects of exercise training with regard to improving the ischemic-tolerance in hearts with cardiomyopathy following obesity and . This study also emphasizes the exercise-induced improvement of cardiac energetics and mitochondrial function in obesity/diabetes.Copyright © 2019 Boardman, Rossvoll, Lund, Hafstad and Aasum.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634770>Inhibition of midkine by metformin can contribute to its anticancer effects in malignancies: A proposal mechanism of action of metformin in context of endometrial cancer prevention and therapy.</a></h2><p>Metformin, a drug widely used in the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM), has been the focus of interest as a potential therapeutic agent for certain types of malignancies, including gynaecological cancers [i.e. endometrial cancer (EC)]. Although the exact mechanism behind the potential anticancer activity of metformin is still not completely understood, certain studies have suggested that different effects on cell functions, such as inhibition of cell migration, apoptosis and tumor cell proliferation, are involved in its preventive and therapeutic effects in certain types of malignancies, including EC. In contrast, midkine (MK), a heparin-binding growth factor and cytokine, which induces carcinogenesis and chemoresistance, promotes the development and progression of many malignant tumours by increasing diverse cell functions such as cell proliferation, cell survival and antiapoptotic activities via mainly the activation of phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. The same pathways are also subject to certain therapeutic effects of metformin, although this cytokine and this drug have some different mechanism of action pathways as well. Taken together, MK and metformin appear to have opposite effects in various biological processes such as apoptosis, cell proliferation, cell survival, cell migration, and angiogenesis. On the other hand, MK activates PI3K and MAPK cell signal pathways, whereas metformin inhibits these two pathways. It seems likely that almost all the pathways and cell functions, which play important roles in malignancies, are inhibited by metformin and activated by MK. Given the opposite relationship between the actions of metformin and MK, we hypothesize that metformin may act like a novel MK inhibitor in some malignancies. We also discuss the possible relationship between metformin and MK in the context of EC, the most common gynecological cancer worldwide, which incidence is rising rapidly, in parallel with the increase in obesity, T2DM and . In this respect, the therapeutic use of metformin may improve the survival of EC or other cancers, via inhibiting or overcoming the unwanted effects of MK in carcinogenesis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Exposure to DEHP impairs the function of islet beta cells (INS-1 cells), which is related to  and type 2 diabetes. At present, some research data have also confirmed that MEHP has a certain damage effect on INS-1 cells. In our experiment, we found that MEHP would lead to the increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the upregulation of autophagy. And downregulated ROS production by -acetyl-l-cysteine could also reduce autophagy. In addition, MEHP-induced lysosomal membrane permeability (LMP) subsequently released cathepsin D. Additionally, MEHP induced the collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and release of cytochrome . Addition of autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine relieved MEHP-induced apoptosis as assessed by the expression of cleaved caspase 3, cleaved caspase 9, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay, indicating that MEHP-induced apoptosis was autophagy dependent. Cathepsin D inhibitor, pepstatin A, suppressed MEHP-induced mitochondria release of cytochrome  and apoptosis as well. Meanwhile, pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a new B vitamin, improved the above phenomenon. Taken together, our results indicate that MEHP induces autophagy-dependent apoptosis in INS-1 cells by lysosomal-mitochondrial axis. PQQ improved this process by downregulating ROS and provided a degree of protection.

Beta-cell insufficiency following high  production over years leads to impaired glucose tolerance and later type 2 diabetes mellitus. In children and adolescents, the diagnosis of T2D is often made by screening very obese patients with oral glucose tolerance test. Usually in these patients, few or no diabetes symptoms are found. As frequently found in pediatric pharmacotherapy, only a few of the modern substances used in adults are available for pediatric patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

In last decade, the paralogous transcription factors MondoA and carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) have been revealed to be central mediators of glucose sensing in multiple metabolic organs. Under normal nutrient conditions, MondoA/ChREBP plays vital roles in maintaining glucose homeostasis. However, under chronic nutrient overload, the dysregulation of MondoA/ChREBP contributes to metabolic disorders, such as  (IR) and T2D. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of recent advances in the understanding of MondoA/ChREBP and its roles in T2D development. Specifically, we will briefly summarize the functional similarities and differences between MondoA and ChREBP. Then, we will update the roles of MondoA/ChREBP in four T2D-associated metabolic organs (i.e., the skeletal muscle, liver, adipose tissue, and pancreas) in physiological and pathological conditions. Finally, we will discuss the opportunities and challenges of MondoA/ChREBP as drug targets for anti-diabetes. By doing so, we highlight the potential use of therapies targeting MondoA/ChREBP to counteract T2D and its complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619585>A role for placental kisspeptin in β cell adaptation to pregnancy.</a></h2><p>During pregnancy the maternal pancreatic islets of Langerhans undergo adaptive changes to compensate for gestational . Kisspeptin has been shown to stimulate  release, through its receptor, GPR54. The placenta releases high levels of kisspeptin into the maternal circulation, suggesting a role in modulating the islet adaptation to pregnancy. In the present study we show that pharmacological blockade of endogenous kisspeptin in pregnant mice resulted in impaired glucose homeostasis. This glucose intolerance was due to a reduced  response to glucose as opposed to any effect on  sensitivity. A β cell-specific GPR54-knockdown mouse line was found to exhibit glucose intolerance during pregnancy, with no phenotype observed outside of pregnancy. Furthermore, in pregnant women circulating kisspeptin levels significantly correlated with  responses to oral glucose challenge and were significantly lower in women with gestational diabetes (GDM) compared with those without GDM. Thus, kisspeptin represents a placental signal that plays a physiological role in the islet adaptation to pregnancy, maintaining maternal glucose homeostasis by acting through the β cell GPR54 receptor. Our data suggest reduced placental kisspeptin production, with consequent impaired kisspeptin-dependent β cell compensation, may be a factor in the development of GDM in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637718>Developments in the study of gastrointestinal microbiome disorders affected by FGF19 in the occurrence and development of colorectal neoplasms.</a></h2><p>Colorectal neoplasms are a type of malignant digestive system tumor that has become the third-highest morbidity tumor in China and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide.

Renal histology and lipid deposits in renal tissue were analyzed.Animals on HFD developed obesity, hypertension, high levels of LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, , and glomerular hyperfiltration. No animal developed overt diabetes. Animals on HFD showed "diabetoid changes", including mesangial expansion [21.40% ± 4 vs.13.20% ± 4.0, p < 0.0001], nodular glomerulosclerosis [7.40% ± 7, 0.75 vs. 2.40% ± 4.7, p = 0.02], and glomerulomegaly (18% vs. 10%, p = 0.010) than those on SD.

Both disease phenotypes often co-occur, in the case of obesity, , diabetes mellitus type 2, and the metabolic syndrome. We explore the pathogenesis of NAFLD, the epidemiology of asCVD in NAFLD patients, shared drivers of both phenotypes, and factors caused by NAFLD that contribute to asCVD. Genetic studies support that NAFLD may drive asCVD through mixed hyperlipidemia. Next, we discuss the prospects of lifestyle improvement and pharmacological treatment of NAFLD for asCVD risk reduction. Finally, we point out that earlier identification of patients with NAFLD should be pursued by increasing awareness of the association of these two phenotypes and collaboration between the involved physicians.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

There is an urgent need for innovative approaches to overcome these limitations.We devised a structure-based chimerisation strategy in which we substituted the thermally labile and low receptor affinity core of FGF21 with an HS binding deficient endocrinised core derived from a stable and high receptor affinity paracrine FGF1 (FGF1). The thermal stability, receptor binding ability, heparan sulfate and βKlotho coreceptor dependency of the chimera were measured using a thermal shift assay, SPR, SEC-MALS and cell-based studies. The half-life, tissue distribution, glucose lowering activity and adipose tissue remodeling were analyzed in normal and diabetic mice and monkeys.The melting temperature of the engineered chimera (FGF1-FGF21) increased by ∼22 °C relative to wild-type FGF21 (FGF21), and resulted in a ∼5-fold increase in half-life in vivo. The chimera also acquired an ability to bind the FGFR1c isoform - the principal receptor that mediates the metabolic actions of FGF21 - and consequently was dramatically more effective than FGF21 in correcting hyperglycemia and in ameliorating  in db/db mice. Our chimeric FGF21 also exerted a significant beneficial effect on glycemic control in spontaneous diabetic cynomolgus monkeys.Our study describes a structure-based chimerisation approach that effectively mitigates both the intrinsically weak receptor binding affinities and short half-lives of endocrine FGFs, and advance the development of the FGF21 hormone into a potentially useful drug for Type 2 diabetes.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

This experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of dietary inulin supplementation on growth performance and meat quality in growing-finishing pigs. Thirty-six Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire White growing barrows (22.0 ± 1.0 kg) were randomly allocated to two dietary treatments consisting of a basal control diet (CON) or basal diet supplemented with 0.5% inulin (INU). Results showed that inulin supplementation tended to increase the average daily gain (ADG) at the fattening stage (0.05 <  < 0.10). Inulin significantly increased the dressing percentage ( < 0.05) and tended to increase the loin-eye area. The serum concentrations of  and IGF-I were significantly higher ( < 0.05) in the INU group than in the CON group. Moreover, inulin supplementation significantly elevated the expression level of myosin heavy chain II b () in the longissimus dorsi ( < 0.05).

Time spent in SB, LIPA and MVPA was measured by accelerometer and transformed into isometric log-ratio coordinates. The associations between time spent in SB, LIPA and MVPA and biomarkers were examined by linear regression models. The change in each outcome of reallocating time between the three behaviors was estimated.ResultsThe findings show strong positive associations of time spent in MVPA and negative associations of time spent in SB relative to time spent in the other behaviors with sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD) and homeostasis model assessment for  (HOMA-IR) and negative associations of time spent in SB with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Theoretically, reallocation of 19 minutes MVPA to SB or to LIPA was associated with a 17% and 17% larger SAD, 39% and 36% larger HOMA-IR values and 3.3% and 2.3% lower levels of HDL, respectively.ConclusionIn conclusion, our analysis from a time-use perspective supports the current evidence that sedentary time is devastating for the cardiometabolic health.

Obesity occurs when dietary energy intake exceeds energy expenditure and has arisen in many societies due to an increasingly "obesogenic" environment in which physical activity has declined and yet children continue to be exposed to unhealthy, energy-dense diets. Additional risks for the development of obesity also include psychological issues and genetic factors. Obesity has many adverse health consequences including development of , Type 2 diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome. There are also important genetic influences on the likelihood of developing . Given the limited success of therapeutic interventions to treat obesity and the metabolic syndrome, there has been an increased interest in preventative strategies. These are likely to be most successful when targeting the young and will require a combination of approaches which will need inter-disciplinary collaborations across health and local government to target families, schools, and local environments to facilitate behavior changes which influence young people's eating behaviors and habitual levels of physical activity.Copyright © 2019 Gregory.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623292>Associations of Cardiovascular and All-Cause Mortality with Metabolic Syndrome in Hemodialysis Patients: A Prospective Single-Center Study.</a></h2><p> Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of risk factors, such as abdominal obesity, , dyslipidemia and hypertension, that together increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients have multiple comorbidities and many metabolic disorders, causing the frequent occurrence of metabolic syndrome. The goal of this study was to assess the prevalence of MetS in HD patients, and its association with all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality. : A total of 138 HD patients were included in this prospective study. We analyzed demographic, anthropometric and biochemical data. Outcome measures were all-cause and CV mortality during the three-year follow-up. : MetS was diagnosed in 57.24% of enrolled patients.

Recently, studies on experimental animals showed that AM2 is an adipokine with beneficial effects on energy metabolism. However, there is little information regarding AM2 expression in human adipose tissue.To investigate the pattern and regulation of AM2 expression and that of its receptor component in human adipose tissue, in the context of obesity and type 2 diabetes.We measured metabolic parameters, serum AM2 and expression of ADM2 and its receptor component genes in abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue in obese (with or without type 2 diabetes) and normal-weight women. Serum AM2 was assessed before and 6-9 months after bariatric surgery. Expression/secretion of AM2 and its receptor was assessed in human adipocytes.ADM2 mRNA in both fat depots was higher in obese patients, whether diabetic or not. Although serum AM2 was significantly lower in obese patients, it was not changed after bariatric surgery. AM2 and its receptor complex were predominantly expressed by adipocytes, and expression of CALCRL, encoding a component of the AM2 receptor complex, was lower in both fat depots of obese patients. Incubating adipocytes with substances mimicking the microenvironment of obese adipose tissue increased ADM2 mRNA but reduced AM2 secretion into culture media and CALCRL mRNA expression.Our data indicate that AM2 signalling is suppressed in adipose tissue in obesity, involving lower receptor expression and ligand availability, likely contributing to  and other aspects of the pathophysiology associated with obesity.© Endocrine Society 2019.

In women with PCOS, effective ovulation induction serves as an important first-line treatment for anovulatory infertility. Individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis is considered as the gold standard for evidence synthesis which provides accurate assessments of outcomes from primary randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and allows additional analyses for time-to-event outcomes. It also facilitates treatment-covariate interaction analyses and therefore offers an opportunity for personalised medicine.We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of different ovulation induction agents, in particular letrozole alone and clomiphene citrate (CC) plus metformin, as compared to CC alone, as the first-line choice for ovulation induction in women with PCOS and infertility, and to explore interactions between treatment and participant-level baseline characteristics.We searched electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to 20 December 2018. We included RCTs comparing the following interventions with each other or placebo/no treatment in women with PCOS and infertility: CC, metformin, CC plus metformin, letrozole, gonadotrophin and tamoxifen. We excluded studies on treatment-resistant women. The primary outcome was live birth. We contacted the investigators of eligible RCTs to share the IPD and performed IPD meta-analyses. We assessed the risk of bias by using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for RCTs.IPD of 20 RCTs including 3962 women with PCOS were obtained. Six RCTs compared letrozole and CC in 1284 women. Compared with CC, letrozole improved live birth rates (3 RCTs, 1043 women, risk ratio [RR] 1.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17-1.75, moderate-certainty evidence) and clinical pregnancy rates (6 RCTs, 1284 women, RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.23-1.70, moderate-certainty evidence) and reduced time-to-pregnancy (6 RCTs, 1235 women, hazard ratio [HR] 1.72, 95% CI 1.38-2.15, moderate-certainty evidence). Meta-analyses of effect modifications showed a positive interaction between baseline serum total testosterone levels and treatment effects on live birth (interaction RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.01-1.65). Eight RCTs compared CC plus metformin to CC alone in 1039 women. Compared with CC alone, CC plus metformin might improve clinical pregnancy rates (8 RCTs, 1039 women, RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.00-1.39, low-certainty evidence) and might reduce time-to-pregnancy (7 RCTs, 898 women, HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.00-1.57, low-certainty evidence), but there was insufficient evidence of a difference on live birth rates (5 RCTs, 907 women, RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.87-1.35, low-certainty evidence). Meta-analyses of effect modifications showed a positive interaction between baseline  levels and treatment effects on live birth in the comparison between CC plus metformin and CC (interaction RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.06).In women with PCOS, letrozole improves live birth and clinical pregnancy rates and reduces time-to-pregnancy compared to CC and therefore can be recommended as the preferred first-line treatment for women with PCOS and infertility. CC plus metformin may increase clinical pregnancy and may reduce time-to-pregnancy compared to CC alone, while there is insufficient evidence of a difference on live birth. Treatment effects of letrozole are influenced by baseline serum levels of total testosterone, while those of CC plus metformin are affected by baseline serum levels of .

In an observational study of 188 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 25 years (97 males, 91 females) we investigated the association of metabolic function with their birth size, their growth during childhood and their body composition. High plasma leptin in early adulthood, a risk factor for cardio-metabolic syndrome, was associated with low weight at age two years (correlation coefficient controlled for adult weight = -0.21, p<0.01). It was also positively associated with pre-prandial  and with HOMA (Homeostasis Model Assessment) . Leptin, leptin-adiponectin ratio and  correlated with lean mass, fat mass and percent fat (p<0.0001). In conclusion, high leptin in early adulthood was associated with both low weight at age two years and . We speculate that high leptin is developmentally programmed and can contribute to the association between low weight in early infancy and increased cardio-metabolic risk in adulthood in heathy subjects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641012> in healthy US adults: findings from the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES).</a></h2><p> is fundamental in two-conditions that are epidemic in the United States and globally: obesity and Type 2 diabetes. We examined 's relationship to common health-related endpoints in a large population-based sample.The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey is a cross-sectional study that uses a complex multistage probability design to obtain a representative sample of the United States population. Adult participants were included from 8 successive 2-year data waves (1999-2014) including 9224 normal individuals, 7699 pre-diabetic and 3413 diabetic subjects. We examined the Homeostatic Model for  (HOMA-IR) in 20336 participants in relation to demographic, anthropometric and clinical data. We examined the relationship of HOMA-IR to 8 groups of outcome variables: general health, anthropometric/metabolic (waist size, BMI), cardiovascular (blood pressure), lipid (triglycerides, HDL), hepatic (ALT, GGT), hematologic (WBC, Hgb, platelets), inflammatory (CRP) and nutritional (vitamin D, C, serum folate and pyridoxine) variables.HOMA-IR was generally strongly, monotonically, and highly significantly associated with adjusted outcomes in normal subjects. In the normal subset, the OR and 95% CI for a quartile change in HOMA-IR for obesity (BMI >30) was 3.62 (3.30, 3.97), and for the highest quintile for the triglyceride/HDL the ratio was 2.00 (1.77-2.26), for GGT it was 1.40 (1.24-1.58), and for white blood count it was 1.28 (1.16-1.40).HOMA-IR levels are associated with poorer general health and adverse changes across a wide range of markers.Clinically, checking  levels may be helpful to identify patients that merit observation and early interventions.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634466>Nutrient metabolism, subcellular redox state and oxidative stress in pancreatic islets and β-cells.</a></h2><p>-secreting pancreatic β-cells play a critical role in blood glucose homeostasis and the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the context of . Based on data obtained at the whole cell level using poorly specific chemical probes, reactive oxygen species (ROS) like superoxide and hydrogen peroxide have been proposed to contribute to the stimulation of  secretion by nutrients (positive role) and to the alterations of cell survival and secretory function in T2D (negative role). This raised the controversial hypothesis that any attempt to decrease β-cell oxidative stress and apoptosis in T2D would further impair  secretion. Over the last decade, the development of genetically-encoded redox probes that can be targeted to cellular compartments of interest and are specific of redox couples allowed the evaluation of short- and long-term effects of nutrients on β-cell redox changes at the subcellular level. The data indicated that the nutrient regulation of β-cell redox signaling and ROS toxicity is far more complex than previously thought, and that the subcellular compartmentation of these processes cannot be neglected when evaluating the mechanisms of ROS production or the efficacy of antioxidant enzymes and antioxidant drugs under glucolipotoxic conditions and in T2D. In this review, we present what is currently known about the compartmentation of redox homeostatic systems and tools to investigate it. We then review data about the effects of nutrients on β-cell subcellular redox state under normal conditions and in the context of T2D, and discuss challenges and opportunities in the field.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We aimed to study the therapeutic effects of Berberine (BBR) on GDM and the possible mechanisms. The expressions and methylated states of HIF3A in pregnant women with GDM were compared with that in healthy controls. The IR cell models of 3T3-L1 adipocytes was constructed by 1 μmol/l dexamethasone (Dex) and 1 μmol/l  (Ins). To evaluate the effects of BBR on IR adipocyte models, cells were subjected to BBR treatment at different concentrations. Transfection of HIF3A siRNA further confirmed the role of HIF3A in the BBR-induced improving effects. Low expression and high methylation of HIF3A gene were frequent in the GDM pregnancies. BBR treatment noticeably increased the glucose usage rates, adiponectin secretion and cell differentiation of IR 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Increased HIF3A expression and decreased methylated state of HIF3A were also found in IR adipocytes. Furthermore, HIF3A silencing not only reversed the effects of BBR on improving  sensibility, but also partially abolished the expression alterations of -related genes in IR adipocytes induced by BBR treatment. Our results suggest that BBR improves  sensibility in IR adipocyte models, and the improving effects of BBR are possibly realized through the inhibition of HIF3A methylation.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661739>Associations between dietary patterns and metabolic syndrome in adolescents.</a></h2><p>Evaluate association of dietary patterns with metabolic syndrome (MetS) and metabolic markers.654 adolescents from Guadalajara, Jalisco, participated in a cross-sectional study.

Since the effect of empagliflozin or other SGLT2 inhibitors on the whole cardiac metabolic profile was never analysed before, and with the purpose to contribute to elucidate the benefits at cardiac level of the use of empagliflozin, we explored the effect of the treatment with empagliflozin for six weeks on the cardiac metabolomic profile of Zucker diabetic fatty rats, a model of early stage T2DM, using untargeted metabolomics approach. Empagliflozin reduced significantly the cardiac content of sphingolipids (ceramides and sphingomyelins) and glycerophospholipids (major bioactive contributing factors linking  to cardiac damage) and decreased the cardiac content of the fatty acid transporter cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36); induced significant decreases of the cardiac levels of essential glycolysis intermediaries 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate, and regulated the abundance of several amino acids of relevance as tricarboxylic acid suppliers and/or in the metabolic control of the cardiac function as glutamic acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid and sarcosine. Empagliflozin treatment activated the cardioprotective master regulator of cellular energyhomeostasis AMP-activatedproteinkinase (AMPK) and enhanced autophagy at cardiac level, while it decreased significantly the cardiac mRNA levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), chemerin, TNF-α and MCP-1, reinforcing the hypothesis of a direct role for empagliflozin in attenuating cardiac inflammation. Our results provide an advancement on the knowledge of the mechanisms linking the therapy with empagliflozin with protective effects on the development of cardiometabolic diseases whose course is associated with remarkable cardiac bioenergetics dysregulation and disarrangement in cardiac metabolome and lipidome.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In 122 federally employed women without diabetes, 73 black (58 African American and 15 African immigrant) and 49 white; age 44{plus minus}10 (mean{plus minus}SD); BMI 30.0{plus minus}5.6 kg/m2 we measured lipoprotein subfractions using nuclear magnetic resonance. Hepatic fat was measured by proton MRS,  sensitivity index (SI) calculated by minimal modeling from a frequently-sampled intravenous glucose test, RBC fatty acid profiles by gas chromatography were used to estimate SCD-1 indices. Hepatic fat, S, and SCD-1 were similar in black women and lower than in whites, regardless of menopausal status. Fasting and postprandial large, medium and small TRLPs, but not very small TRLPs, were lower in black women. Fasting large, medium and very small TRLPs negatively correlated with S and positively correlated with visceral and hepatic fat, and SCD-1 activity in both groups. In multivariate models, visceral fat and SCD-1 were associated with total fasting TRLP concentrations (adjR= 0.39, P=0.001). Black women had smaller postprandial changes in large (P=0.005) and medium TRLPs (P=0.007).  Lower visceral fat and SCD-1 activity may contribute to the paradoxical association of lower fasting and postprandial TRLP subfractions despite  in black compared to white pre- and post-menopausal women.

Interleukin (IL)-34 is a recently discovered pro-inflammatory cytokine that functions as a ligand for colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R). The contribution of IL-34 in the development of multiple chronic inflammatory diseases and autoimmune diseases has been recently discovered. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether IL-34 participates in the pathogenesis of GDM.A total of 120 women were enrolled in this study, which included 60 GDM patients and age- and sex-matched healthy pregnant women. The expression of IL-34 in serum, cord blood and placental tissues was analysed by ELISA and Western blot assays. The association between IL-34 levels and clinical features was also studied. We additionally evaluated the effect of recombinant mouse IL-34 (rmIL-34) on apoptosis and pancreatic β cell function.We found that IL-34 expression is highly increased in serum, cord blood and placental tissues in patients with GDM. In addition, there was a positive association between serum IL-34 and  and glucose concentrations. Our data also revealed that IL-34 contributes to the apoptosis of pancreatic β cells in GDM caused by CSF-1R.

Although obesity is usually defined as elevated body mass index (BMI), recent data indicate a superior role of waist circumference or hypertriglyceridemic waist (HTGW) over BMI in the assessment of cardiometabolic risk. In dyslipidemic patients, the specific contributions of risky waist, HTGW or BMI have not been evaluated as yet. 686 dyslipidemic subjects (322 males and 364 females) were enrolled into a cross-sectional study. In each subject basic antropometry (i.e. waist circumference, HTGW, BMI) and laboratory parameters of lipid profile and  were determined. Cardiometabolic risk was given by fulfilling the criteria (harmonized definition) of metabolic syndrome. The significance of risky waist, HTGW and BMI were assessed by comparing the respective predictive values for the presence of metabolic syndrome. Dyslipidemic patients with risky waist, HTGW or high BMI have a more atherogenic lipid profile and higher  compared to those without risky waist, HTGW or high BMI. Risky waist is stronger predictor of metabolic syndrome (PPV 66 %, NPV 90 %) and thus poses a greater cardiometabolic risk than higher BMI per se does (PPV 42 %, NPV 97 %). The contribution of triglycerides (i.e. HTGW) to these predictive values is marginal (PPV 66 %, NPV 92 %). The present results highlight the superior role of waist circumference as a screening tool over BMI for the evaluation of cardiometabolic risk in dyslipidemic subjects. HTGW brings little additional benefit in risk stratification. Lower BMI proved to be optimal for identifying the subjects with inferior risk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660753>A Complex Relationship: Dietary Folate, Arsenic Metabolism, and  in Mice.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657699>Are there any differences among psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis in terms of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk factors?</a></h2><p>Although the frequency of metabolic syndrome has been studied separately in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, there is no study that compares the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in all three diseases.

Subjects were included in our study if they had a bipolar diagnosis and were currently treated with a mood stabilizer or atypical antipsychotic. A healthy control group free of psychiatric or physical disease was also included for comparisons. Anthropometric, BMI and hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C%) were measured. Fasting skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained and methylation levels of 5-methycytosine (5-mC), 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) and 5-formylcytosine (5-fC) were measured. Skeletal muscle global methylation of 5-mC and 5-fC were significantly higher in bipolar subjects compared to healthy controls. 5-mC was significantly higher in the AAP group compared to the mood stabilizer group. Significant correlations were observed between 5-fC methylation and HbA1C%.

Fetuin-A is associated with , and the concentration of circulating fetuin-A increases in women with GDM, however, the role of fetuin-A in the placenta remains unclear. In this study, we enrolled placental samples from twenty pregnant women with GDM and twenty non-GDM pregnant women and found that the abundance of fetuin-A was upregulated in terms of mRNA and protein levels. Fetuin-A inhibited placental cell growth by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting S phase entry. Irregular alignment of mitotic chromosomes and aberrant mitotic spindle poles were observed. In addition, centrosome amplification was induced by fetuin-A treatment, and these amplified centrosomes nucleated microtubules with disorganized microtubule arrays in placental cells. Furthermore, fetuin-A inhibited autophagy, and thus blocked the growth of the primary cilium, a cellular antenna that regulates placenta development and differentiation. Thus, our study uncovered the novel function of fetuin-A in regulating placental cell growth and ciliogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625959>Homeostatic model assessment of  closely related to lobular inflammation in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p> (IR) has been established as a major risk factor for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) where it exerts effects on plasma glucose homeostasis, cellular anabolism, and organ glucose uptake.

After excluding etiologies other than NAFLD and factors contributing to IR, serum HOMA-IR was compared with patients' histologic features. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to assess their relationship. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) was calculated to assess the discriminatory ability of homeostatic model assessment of IR for advanced lobular inflammation (LI).We observed higher serum level of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and low-density lipoprotein as HOMA-IR increased. HOMA-IR is significantly associated with severity of LI (odds ratio = 1.222, 95% confidence interval = 1.135-1.315, P < 0.001), similar association remained after adjusting for age, BMI, hemoglobin A1c, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides (odds ratio = 1.205, 95% confidence interval = 1.102-1.317, P < 0.001). HOMA-IR is discriminant of LI with AUROC = 0.832 and cutoff = 2.995 (sensitivity = 0.938, specificity = 0.569).This study demonstrated a strong and independent association of HOMA-IR with the severity of liver inflammation by histological evaluation in NAFLD patients without diabetes or metabolic syndrome, and its possible role in diagnosis of LI could be translated into clinical assessment of NAFLD patients with uncertainty of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis progression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624312>HOMA-estimated  as an independent prognostic factor in patients with acute pancreatitis.</a></h2><p>This prospective study investigated the relationship between  assessed using the homeostatic model assessment of  (HOMA-IR) and the prognosis of acute pancreatitis (AP).

IR leads to accumulation of advanced-glycation-end-products (AGEs) and their receptor, RAGE. PCOS patients have increased levels of vascular-endothelial-growth-factor (VEGF), interleukin 6/8 (IL-6/8) and anti-Mϋllerian-hormone (AMH). PEDF is a secreted-glycoprotein known for its anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory properties. We aimed to elucidate the role of PEDF in the pathogenesis and treatment of PCOS. We used a prenatal PCOS mouse model and fed the female offspring a high-fat-diet, inducing metabolic PCOS (met.PCOS) characteristics. Female offspring were divided into three groups: control; met.PCOS; met.PCOS+recombinant PEDF (rPEDF). Met.PCOS mice gained more weight, had elevated serum IL-6 and higher mRNA levels of AMH, PEDF and RAGE in their granulosa-cells (GCs) than met.PCOS+rPEDF mice. An in-vitro met.PCOS model in human GCs (KGN) line was induced by prolonged incubation with /AGEs, causing development of IR. Under the same conditions, we observed an elevation of VEGF, IL-6/8 mRNAs, concomitantly with an increase in PEDF mRNA, intracellular protein levels, and an elevation of PEDF receptors (PEDF-Rs) mRNA and protein. Simultaneously, a reduction in the secretion of PEDF from GCs, was measured in the medium. The addition of rPEDF (5nM) activated P38 signaling, implying that PEDF-Rs maintained functionality, and negated AGE-induced elevation of IL-6/8 and VEGF mRNAs. Decreased PEDF secretion may be a major contributor to hyper-angiogenesis and chronic inflammation, which lie at the core of PCOS pathogenesis. rPEDF treatment may restore physiological angiogenesis-inflammatory balance, thus suggesting a potential therapeutic role in PCOS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637346>Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Nonobese Subjects of African Origin Has Atypical Metabolic Characteristics.</a></h2><p>Nonobese nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is reported in several populations.

CT was used to estimate liver and abdominal fat and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry to measure body composition. Fasting blood was collected for lipids, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), adiponectin, and fetuin-A. Homeostatic model assessment of  (HOMA-IR), whole-body  sensitivity index (WBISI), insulinogenic index (IGI), and oral disposition index (oDI) were calculated after a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test.Fifty-two percent of participants were male; mean (±SD) age was 28.5 ± 7.8 years, and body mass index was 22.4 ± 3.0 kg/m. Mean liver attenuation (MLA) and liver/spleen (LS) ratio, both inversely correlated to liver fat, were 62.8 ± 4.3 HU and 1.2 ± 0.1, respectively; 3.8% of participants had liver fat >30% (LS ratio < 1). In age, sex, and BMI-adjusted correlations, MLA was negatively associated with weight ( = -0.30;  = 0.009) and height ( = -0.28;  = 0.017) and was associated with fasting glucose ( = 0.23;  = 0.05), fasting  ( = 0.42;  ≤ 0.001) and HOMA-IR ( = 0.35;  = 0.004). Serum lipids, ALT, adiponectin, fetuin-A, WBISI, IGI, and oDI were not associated with liver fat.In nonobese Afro-Caribbean participants, greater liver fat was associated with weight and height and lower fasting  and hyperinsulinemia appears to be influential in the reduction of NAFLD.

This intervention was modeled on standard brief motivational interventions for alcohol used in the workplace that promote health knowledge and goal setting.Outcomes included changes in SSB intake, Homeostatic Model Assessment of  (HOMA-IR), and measures of abdominal adiposity. The primary associations tested were the correlation between changes in SSB intake and changes in HOMA-IR.Among the 214 study participants, 124 (57.9%) were women, with a mean (SD) age of 41.2 (11.0) years and a baseline mean (SD) body mass index of 29.4 (6.5). They reported a mean daily intake of 1050 mL (35 fl oz) of SSBs at baseline and 540 mL (18 fl oz) at follow-up-a 510-mL (17-fl oz) (48.6%) decrease (P < .001). Reductions in SSB intake correlated with improvements in HOMA-IR (r = 0.16; P = .03). Those not randomized to receive the brief intervention reduced their SSB intake by a mean (SD) of 246.0 (84.0) mL (8.2 [2.8] fl oz), while those also receiving the brief intervention reduced SSB intake by 762.0 (84.0) mL (25.4 [2.8] fl oz). From baseline to follow-up, there were significant reductions in mean (SE) waist circumference (2.1 [2.8] cm; P < .001).This study's findings suggest that the workplace sales ban was associated with a reduction in SSB intake and a significant reduction in waist circumference among employees within 10 months. The randomized clinical trial portion of this study found that targeting those at high risk with a brief motivational intervention led to additional improvements. Workplace sales bans may offer a promising new private-sector strategy for reducing the health harms of SSB intake.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629408>Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression and serum levels as markers of pre-clinical atherosclerosis in polycystic ovary syndrome.</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common reproductive endocrine disorder characterized by obesity, hyperandrogenism, and . Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is a proinflammatory and proatherogenic cytokine which is associated with atherosclerosis, , and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The pathogenesis of PCOS is not precisely known. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the potential role of ICAM-1 expression and serum ICAM-1 concentrations in pathogenesis of PCOS. Moreover, we aimed to evaluate the possible relationship between ICAM-1 gene expression with carotid intima-media thickness as well as clinic-morphological features of PCOS.This case control study enrolled 180 patients with PCOS and 120 controls groups and they were stratified according to their fasting plasma glucose (FPG) into three subgroups; normal glucose tolerance (NGT) [n = 75], those with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) [n = 65], and 40 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Circulating ICAM-1 expression levels were determined by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Serum ICAM-1 concentrations were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Our results revealed that PCOS patients had higher values of ICAM-1expression and serum levels. Among PCOS patients, T2DM patients had the highest values of ICAM-1 expression and serum levels compared to IGT and NGT subgroups. The ICAM-1 expression and serum levels were significantly positive correlated with cardiovascular risk and PCOS phenotypes. Linear regression test showed that HOMA-IR was the main predictors of serum ICAM-1 levels in PCOS. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis revealed that, the power of ICAM-1 expression levels was higher than serum ICAM-1 in diagnosis of PCOS and in differentiating T2DM from IGT and NGT subgroups. Interestingly, combination of both ICAM-1 expression and serum levels improved the diagnostic role of serum ICAM-1.ICAM-1 expression and serum levels were higher in women with PCOS compared to control group also, there was a strong independent association between higher ICAM-1 expression and serum levels with cardiovascular risks in PCOS group.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622373>Alteration of adipose tissue immune cell milieu towards the suppression of inflammation in high fat diet fed mice by flaxseed oil supplementation.</a></h2><p>The present study evaluates the effect of flaxseed oil (FXO) supplementation on adipose tissue macrophages (ATM's), E and D series resolvin (Rv) levels and adipose tissue inflammation. Male C57BL/6J mice were divided into five groups (n = 5): lean group (given standard chow diet), HFD group given high fat diet (approx. 18 weeks) till they developed  and 4, 8 or 16 mg/kg group (HFD group later orally supplemented with 4, 8 or 16 mg/kg body weight flaxseed oil) for 4 weeks.The present study showed that FXO supplementation led to enhanced DHA, EPA, RvE1-E2, RvD2, RvD5- D6, IL-4, IL-10 and arginase 1 levels in ATMs together with altered immune cell infiltration and reduced NF-κB expression. The FXO supplementation suppresses immune cell infiltration into adipose tissue and alters adipose tissue macrophage phenotype towards the anti-inflammatory state via enhancement of E and D series resolvins, arginase 1 expression and anti-inflammatory cytokines level (IL-4 and IL-10.) leading to amelioration of  in flaxseed oil supplemented HFD mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663475>Gum Acacia Functional Significance in the Management of Obesity.</a></h2><p>Consumption of diets rich in fat and refined sugars are recognized to be the cause of altered intestinal functionality and metabolic disorders like obesity, , type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.

The former is a risk factor for the latter, but a mechanistic linkage between them remains elusive. We show that prediabetic serum hyperinsulinemia is reflected in the cerebrospinal fluid and that this chronically elevated  renders neurons resistant to . This leads to abnormal electrophysiological activity and other defects. In addition, neuronal  reduces hexokinase 2, thus impairing glycolysis. This hampers the ubiquitination and degradation of p35, favoring its cleavage to p25, which hyperactivates CDK5 and interferes with the GSK3β-induced degradation of β-catenin. CDK5 contributes to neuronal cell death while β-catenin enters the neuronal nucleus and re-activates the cell cycle machinery. Unable to successfully divide, the neuron instead enters a senescent-like state. These findings offer a direct connection between peripheral hyperinsulinemia, as found in prediabetes, age-related neurodegeneration and cognitive decline.

The aim of this study was to determine the FA profile and pro-antioxidant status in sarcopenic frail elderly patients enrolled in a nutritional and physical activity program and to evaluate their correlation with clinical markers. Moreover, the possible changes, produced after a short-term clinical protocol, were evaluated. Plasma and erythrocyte FA composition and pro-antioxidant status were analyzed in sarcopenic elderly subjects recruited for the randomized clinical study and treated with a placebo or dietary supplement, a personalized diet, and standardized physical activity. Subjects were tested before and after 30 days of treatment. Pearson correlations between biochemical parameters and patients' characteristics at recruitment indicate interesting features of sarcopenic status such as negative correlation among the plasma FA profile, age, and physical characteristics. Physical activity and dietetic program alone for 30 days induced a decrease of saturated FA concentration with a significant increase of dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid. Supplementation plus physical activity induced a significant decrease of linoleic acid, omega-6 polyunsaturated FAs, and an increase of stearic and oleic acid concentration. Moreover, glutathione reductase activity, which is an indicator of antioxidant status, significantly increased in erythrocytes. Changes over time between groups indicate significant differences for saturated FAs, which suggest that the amino acid supplementation restores FA levels that are consumed during physical activity. A relationship between FA and clinical/metabolic status revealed unique correlations and a specific metabolic and lipidomic fingerprint in sarcopenic elderly. The results indicate the positive beneficial role of supplementation and physical activity on plasma FA status and the antioxidant system as a co-adjuvant approach in sarcopenic, frail, elderly patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623509>Subgingival Microbiota and Longitudinal Glucose Change: The Oral Infections, Glucose Intolerance and  Study (ORIGINS).</a></h2><p>Microbial communities along mucosal surfaces throughout the digestive tract are hypothesized as risk factors for impaired glucose regulation and the development of clinical cardiometabolic disease. We investigated whether baseline measures of subgingival microbiota predicted fasting plasma glucose (FPG) longitudinally. The Oral Infections, Glucose Intolerance and  Study (ORIGINS) enrolled 230 diabetes-free adults (77% female) aged 20 to 55 y (mean ± SD, 34 ± 10 y) from whom baseline subgingival plaque and longitudinal FPG were measured. DNA was extracted from subgingival plaque, and V3 to V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced. FPG was measured at baseline and again at 2 y; glucose change was defined as follow-up minus baseline. Multivariable linear models regressed 2-y glucose change onto baseline measures of community diversity and abundances of 369 individual taxa. A microbial dysbiosis index (MDI) summarizing top individual taxa associated with glucose change was calculated and used in regression models. Models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, smoking status, body mass index, and baseline glucose levels. Statistical significance was based on the false discovery rate (FDR; <0.05) or a Bonferroni-corrected  value of 1 × 10, derived from the initial 369 hypothesis tests for specific taxa. Mean 2-y FPG change was 1.5 ± 8 mg/dL. Baseline levels of 9 taxa predicted FPG change (all FDR <0.05), among which  sp oral taxon 097 and  spp predicted greater FPG change, while  sp oral taxon 498 predicted lesser FPG change (all 3  values, Bonferroni significant). The MDI explained 6% of variation in longitudinal glucose change ( < 0.001), and baseline glucose levels explained 10% of variation ( < 0.0001). FPG change values ± SE in the third versus first tertile of the MDI were 4.5 ± 0.9 versus 1.6 ± 0.9 ( < 1 × 10).

Increased levels of specific liver enzymes in the peripheral blood are typical findings in horses diagnosed with EMS. Current management of EMS is based on caloric restriction and increased physical activity. However, new potential treatment options are arising such as the transplantation of autologous adipose stem cells (ASC). However, cytophysiological properties of ASC derived from EMS horses are impaired which strongly limits their therapeutic potential. We hypothesized, that in vitro pharmacotherapy of those cells with 5-azacytidine (AZA) and resveratrol (RES) before their clinical application can reverse the aged phenotype of those cells and improve clinical outcome of autologous therapy. A 9 year old Dutch Warmblood Horse used for driving, was presented with severe obesity, . After EMS diagnosis, the animal received three intravenous injections of autologous, AZA/RES treated ASCs at weekly intervals. The therapeutic effect was assessed by the analysis of liver specific enzymes in the blood. ASC-transplantation reduced levels of glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate transaminase (AST).

Semaphorins are involved in axonal guidance; however, the role of secretory semaphorin 3G (SEMA3G) in regulating adipocyte differentiation remains unclear. Microarray analysis showed that the SEMA3G gene was upregulated in an in vitro model of adipogenesis. In this study, SEMA3G was highly expressed in the white adipose tissue and liver. Analysis of 3T3-L1 cell and primary mouse preadipocyte differentiation showed that SEMA3G mRNA and protein levels were increased during the middle stage of cell development. In vitro experiments also showed that adipocyte differentiation was promoted by SEMA3G; however, SEMA3G inhibition using a recombinant lentiviral vector expressing a specific small hairpin RNA (shRNA) showed the opposite results. Mice were fed a chow or high-fat diet (HFD); knockdown of SEMA3G was found to inhibit weight gain, reduce fat mass in the tissues, prevent lipogenesis in the liver tissue, reduce  and ameliorate glucose tolerance in HFD mice. Additionally, the effect of SEMA3G on HFD-induced obesity was activated through PI3K/Akt/GSK3β signaling in the adipose tissue and the AMPK/SREBP-1c pathway in the liver. Moreover, the plasma concentrations of SEMA3G and leptin were measured in 20 obese and 20 non-obese human subjects. Both proteins were increased in obese subjects, who also exhibited a lower level of adiponectin and presented with . In summary, we demonstrated that SEMA3G is an adipokine essential for adipogenesis, lipogenesis, and  and is associated with obesity. SEMA3G inhibition may, therefore, be useful for treating diet-induced obesity and its complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649313>Improving obesity and blood pressure.</a></h2><p>Obesity-associated hypertension is a serious public health concern. Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) overactivity, especially in the kidneys, is an important mechanism linking obesity to hypertension. Some adipokines play important roles in elevating blood pressure (BP). Hyperinsulinemia caused by  stimulates sodium reabsorption, enhances sodium retention, and increases circulating plasma volume. Hyperinsulinemia also stimulates both the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the SNS, resulting in the acceleration of atherosclerosis through the hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells, which contributes to increased peripheral vascular . Obesity is associated with increased RAAS activity despite volume overload, as the tissue RAASs are stimulated in obese hypertensive individuals. Mineralocorticoid receptor-associated hypertension must also be considered in obese patients with resistant hypertension. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Some components of the gut microbiota contribute to BP control; therefore, gut dysbiosis caused by obesity might lead to increased BP. The ratio of visceral fat to subcutaneous fat is higher in Japanese patients than in Caucasian patients, which may explain why Japanese patients are more susceptible to metabolic disorders even though they are less obese than Caucasian individuals. Obesity-associated kidney dysfunction directly increases BP, leading to further deterioration of kidney function. A bodyweight reduction of more than 3% or 5 kg significantly lowers BP. Gastrointestinal bypass surgery is an effective treatment for morbid obesity and its related metabolic disorders, including hypertension. Because both obesity and hypertension are representative lifestyle-related disorders, lifestyle modification, especially to improve obesity, should be performed first as a treatment for hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620616>Pharmacologic therapy for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis focusing on pathophysiology.</a></h2><p>The paradigm of chronic liver diseases has been shifting.

In mice, deficiency in both RabGAPs leads to reduced skeletal muscle glucose transport in response to  and lower GLUT4 abundance. Conversely, Tbc1d1- and Tbc1d4-deficiency results in enhanced lipid use as fuel in skeletal muscle, through yet unknown mechanisms. In humans, variants in TBC1D1 and TBC1D4 are linked to obesity and  and type 2 diabetes. While the specific function in metabolism of each of the two RabGAPs remains to be determined, TBC1D1 emerges to be controlling exercise endurance and physical capacity whereas TBC1D4 may rather be responsible for maintaining muscle  sensitivity, muscle contraction, and exercise. There is growing evidence that TBC1D1 also plays an important role in skeletal muscle development, since it has been found to be associated to meat production traits in several livestock species.

T2D presents with hyperglycemia and  resulting in increased risk for blindness, renal failure, nerve damage, and premature death. Skeletal muscle is a major site for  and is responsible for up to 80% of glucose uptake during euglycemic hyperglycemic clamps. Glucose uptake in skeletal muscle is driven by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and for this reason mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in T2D. In this review we integrate mitochondrial function with physiologic function to present a broader understanding of mitochondrial functional status in T2D utilizing studies from both human and rodent models. Quantification of mitochondrial function is explained both in vitro and in vivo highlighting the use of proper controls and the complications imposed by obesity and sedentary lifestyle. This review suggests that skeletal muscle mitochondria are not necessarily dysfunctional but limited oxygen supply to working muscle creates this misperception. Finally, we propose changes in experimental design to address this question unequivocally. If mitochondrial function is not impaired it suggests that therapeutic interventions and drug development must move away from the organelle and toward the cardiovascular system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656583>Recent advances in understanding lipodystrophy: a focus on lipodystrophy-associated cardiovascular disease and potential effects of leptin therapy on cardiovascular function.</a></h2><p>Lipodystrophy is a disease characterized by a partial or total absence of adipose tissue leading to severe metabolic derangements including marked , type 2 diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, and steatohepatitis.

Herein, we report data relative to the expression and function of TRP vanilloid 2 (TRPV2) channels in cancer. Overexpression of TRPV2 is observed in high-grade urothelial cancers and treatment with the TRPV2 agonist cannabidiol induces apoptosis. In prostate cancer, TRPV2 promotes migration and invasion, and TRPV2 overexpression characterizes the castration-resistant phenotype. In breast cancer cells, inhibition of TRPV2 by tranilast reduces the -like growth factor-1 stimulated proliferation. TRPV2 overexpression in triple-negative breast cancer cells is associated with high recurrence-free survival. Increased TRPV2 overexpression is present in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma associated with advanced disease, lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis. Increased TRPV2 transcripts have been found both in benign hepatoma and in hepatocarcinomas, where TRPV2 expression is associated with portal vein invasion and reduction of cancer stem cell expression. TRPV2 expression and function has been also evaluated in gliomagenesis. This receptor negatively controls survival, proliferation, and  to CD95- or BCNU-induced apoptosis. In glioblastoma stem cells, TRPV2 activation promotes differentiation and inhibits the proliferation in vitro and in vivo. In glioblastoma, the TRPV2 is part of an interactome-based signature complex, which is negatively associated with survival, and it is expressed in high risk of recurrence and temozolomide-resistant patients. Finally, also in hematological malignancies, such as myeloma or acute myeloid leukemia, TRPV2 might represent a target for novel therapeutic approaches. Overall, these findings demonstrate that TRPV2 exhibits an oncogenic activity in different types of cancers, controlling survival, proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and invasion signaling pathways. Thus, it prompts the pharmacological use of TRPV2 targeting in the control of cancer progression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620011>Android Fat Deposition and Its Association With Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Overweight Young Males.</a></h2><p>Excess adiposity increases the risk of type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease development.

However, there have been no longitudinal studies investigating the association of serum LBP levels and the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in general populations. Methods and Results A total of 2568 community-dwelling Japanese individuals 40 years and older without prior CVD were followed for 10 years (2002-2012). Serum LBP levels were divided into quartiles (quartile 1: 2.20-9.68 μg/mL; quartile 2: 9.69-10.93 μg/mL; quartile 3: 10.94-12.40 μg/mL; quartile 4: 12.41-24.34 μg/mL). The hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% CIs for the incidence of CVD were computed using a Cox proportional hazards model. During the follow-up period, 180 individuals developed CVD. The age- and sex-adjusted cumulative incidence of CVD increased significantly with higher serum LBP levels ( for trend=0.005). Individuals with higher serum LBP levels had a significantly greater risk of the development of CVD after adjusting for conventional cardiovascular risk factors (quartile 1: HR, 1.00 [reference]; quartile 2: HR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.60-1.78]; quartile 3: HR, 1.52 [95% CI, 0.92-2.51]; and quartile 4: HR, 1.90 [95% CI, 1.17-3.09];  for trend=0.01). This association remained significant after additional adjustment for homeostasis model assessment of  ( for trend=0.01). However, when additional adjustment was made for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, the association was attenuated to the nonsignificant level ( for trend=0.08).

INSR can be subsequently conducted to lysosome for degradation or recycled back to the plasma membrane. The metabolic fate of INSR in cellular events implies the profound influence of INSR on  signaling pathways. Disruption of INSR-coupled activities has been identified in a wide range of -related diseases such as T2DM. Accumulating evidence suggests that alterations in INSR trafficking may lead to severe . However, there is very little understanding of how altered INSR activities undermine complex signaling pathways to the development of  and T2DM. Here, we focus this review on summarizing previous findings on the molecular pathways of INSR trafficking in normal and diseased states. Through this review, we provide insights into the mechanistic role of INSR intracellular processes and activities in the development of  and diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621872>Developmental exposure to PCB153 (2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl) alters circadian rhythms and the expression of clock and metabolic genes.</a></h2><p>Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are highly persistent and ubiquitously distributed environmental pollutants. Based on their chemical structure, PCBs are classified into non-ortho-substituted and ortho-substituted congeners. Non-ortho-substituted PCBs are structurally similar to dioxin and their toxic effects and mode of action are well established. In contrast, very little is known about the effects of ortho-substituted PCBs, particularly during early development. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of exposure to an environmentally prominent ortho-substituted PCB (2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl; PCB153) on zebrafish embryos. We exposed zebrafish embryos to three different concentrations of PCB153 starting from 4 hours post-fertilization (hpf) to 120 hpf. We quantified gross morphological changes, behavioral phenotypes, gene expression changes and circadian behavior in the larvae. There were no developmental defects during the exposure period, but starting at 7 dpf, we observed spinal deformity in the 10 μM PCB153 treated group. A total of 633, 2227, and 3378 differentially expressed genes were observed in 0.1 μM (0.036 μg/mL), 1 μM (0.36 μg/mL) and 10 μM (3.6 μg/mL) PCB153 treated embryos, respectively. Of these, 301 genes were common to all treatment groups. KEGG pathway analysis revealed enrichment of genes related to circadian rhythm, FoxO signaling and  pathways. Behavioral analysis revealed that PCB153 exposure significantly alters circadian behavior. Disruption of circadian rhythms has been associated with the development of metabolic and neurological diseases. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of action of environmental chemicals in disrupting metabolism and other physiological processes is essential.© The Author(s) 2019.

Previous studies investigating the diabetogenic effects of TAC have focused on the β cells of islets. In this study, we found that TAC contributed to NODAT through directly affecting hepatic metabolic homeostasis. In mice, TAC induced hypoglycemia rather than hyperglycemia during starvation via suppressing gluconeogenetic genes, suggesting the limitation of fasting blood glucose in the diagnosis of NODAT. In addition, TAC caused hepatic  and triglyceride accumulation through IRS2/AKT and SREBP1 signaling, respectively. Furthermore, we found a pivotal role of CRTC2 in TAC-induced metabolic disorders. The restoration of hepatic CRTC2 alleviated the metabolic disorders through its downstream molecules (e.g., PCK1, IRS2, and SREBP1). Consistent with the findings from bench, low CRTC2 expression in graft hepatocytes was an independent risk factor for NODAT (OR = 2.692, P = 0.023, n = 135). Integrating grafts' CRTC2 score into the clinical model could significantly increase the predictive capacity (AUCs: 0.71 vs. 0.79, P = 0.048). Taken together, in addition to its impact on pancreatic cells, TAC induces 'hepatogenous diabetes' via CRTC2 signaling. Liver-targeted management may be of help to prevent or heal TAC-associated diabetes.© 2019 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629802>Rho-kinase activity is upregulated in the skeletal muscle of aged exercised rats.</a></h2><p>There is a gap in the knowledge regarding the regulation of glucose uptake in skeletal muscle during the development of  in the elderly. Rho-Kinase (Rock) signaling has been demonstrated as a crucial mechanism related to glucose metabolism and  sensitivity in skeletal muscle. This kinase is involved in the  receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) phosphorylation, leading to glucose uptake stimulation in the skeletal muscle; however, the mechanisms elucidating the role of Rock regulation in the context of advanced ages are still limited. In this study, we submitted old Fischer 344 rats to short-term treadmill physical exercise protocol (5 days) and evaluated the glucose tolerance and proteins involved with Rock/ signaling in the skeletal muscle. Compared to young rats, the old rats showed glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, and decreased phosphorylation in the proteins related to the  signaling pathway in the skeletal muscle, without changes in body mass and adiposity. Otherwise, when these rats were submitted to physical exercise, it was found decreased fasting glucose, higher glucose tolerance, decreased insulinemia, and upregulation of Rock2/pIRS1/pAkt/pGSK3β/GLUT4 pathway in the skeletal muscle. In summary, the aging process did not change Rock signaling, but the physical exercise was able to increase Rock2 content and  signaling pathway in the skeletal muscle. This finding suggests the benefic role of physical exercise to advanced ages, promoting -sensitive effects with Rho-kinase contribution.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Considering previous studies reporting the correlation of ApoL1 to triglyceride, we have hypothesized that ApoL1 associates with -related metabolism. The current study examined their associations in 126 non-diabetic subjects and 36 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Non-diabetic subjects demonstrated triglyceride (standardized coefficients [s.c.] = 0.204, p < 0.05), body mass index (s.c. =0.232, p < 0.05) and HDL cholesterol (s.c. = -0.203, p < 0.05) as independent determinant of ApoL1 levels, and the significant elevation of ApoL1 in metabolic syndrome. Lipoprotein fractionation analysis revealed the predominant distribution of ApoL1 in large HDL fraction, and the significant increase of ApoL1 in large LDL fraction in high ApoL1 samples with . In T2DM, ApoL1 was higher in T2DM with metabolic syndrome, however ApoL1 was lower with β cell dysfunction.  significantly promotes ApoL1 synthesis and secretion in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, circulating ApoL1 may be associated with abnormal HDL metabolism in  resistant status. This may suggest a regulation of  signal on the ApoL1 level, leading to offer a novel insight to the ApoL1 biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637181>Effect of Weight Reduction on Histological Activity and Fibrosis of Lean Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Patient.</a></h2><p>Weight reduction has evidenced benefit on attenuation of histological activity and fibrosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), but there is scarcity of data for lean NASH subgroup. We have designed this study to compare the effects of weight reduction on histological activity and fibrosis of lean and non-lean NASH.We have included 20 lean and 20 non-lean histologically proven NASH patients. BMI < 25 kg/m2 was defined as non-lean. Informed consent was taken from each subject. All methods were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Moderate exercise along with dietary restriction was advised for both groups for weight reduction. After 1 year, 16 non-lean and 15 lean had completed second liver biopsy.Age, sex, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyltrasferase (GGT), Homeostasis model assessment  (HOMA-IR), triglyceride and high density lipoprotein (HDL) was similar in both groups. Steatosis, ballooning, lobular inflammation, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) and fibrosis was similar in the two groups. In lean/non-lean group, any amount of weight reduction, ≥ 5% weight reduction and ≥ 7% weight reduction was found in respectively 8/11, 5/6 and 2/6 patients. In both lean and non-lean groups, weight reduction of any amount was associated with significant reduction of steatosis, ballooning and NAS, except lobular inflammation and fibrosis. In both groups, weight reduction of ≥ 5% was associated with significant reduction in NAS only. However, significant improvement in NAS was noted with ≥ 7% weight reduction in non-lean group only.Smaller amount of weight reduction had the good benefit of improvement in all the segments of histological activity in both lean and non-lean NASH.© 2019 Shahinul Alam, Mohammad Jahid Hasan, Md.

Pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 (PYCR1) plays a critical role in metabolic profiles of tumors. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the mechanisms of PYCR1 on cell growth and survival in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Protein and mRNA expression levels of PYCR1 in 140 pairs of tumor and adjacent normal liver tissues of HCC patients were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Expressions of PYCR1 were inhibited in BEL-7404 cells and SMMC-7721 cells using gene interference technology. The cell proliferation was detected by Celigo and MTT assay. The colony formation assay was also performed. The cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometric assay. The effect of PYCR1 interference on tumor growth was observed by xenograft nude mice assay in vivo. The downstream pathway of PYCR1 interference was searched by microarray and bioinformatics analysis, and validated by qRT-PCR and western blot.PYCR1 levels were significantly up-regulated in HCC tumor tissues than adjacent normal liver tissues in both protein and mRNA levels (P < 0.01). In vitro, the cell proliferation was significantly slower in shPYCR1 group than shCtrl group in BEL-7404 and SMMC-7721 cells (P < 0.001). The colony number was significantly smaller after PYCR1 interference (P < 0.01). The percentage of apoptosis cells significantly increased in shPYCR1 group (P < 0.01). In vivo, PYCR1 interference could obviously suppress tumor growth in xenograft nude mice. The volume and weight of tumors were significantly smaller via PYCR1 interference. The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway significantly altered, and  receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) were significantly down-regulated by PYCR1 interference in both mRNA and protein levels (P < 0.001).PYCR1 interference could inhibit cell proliferation and promote cell apoptosis in HCC through regluting JNK/IRS1 pathway. Our study will provide a drug target for HCC therapy and a potential biomarker for its diagnosis or prognosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637624>The Role of Adipokines in Breast Cancer: Current Evidence and Perspectives.</a></h2><p>The current review shows evidence for the role of adipokines in breast cancer (BC) pathogenesis summarizing the mechanisms underlying the association between adipokines and breast malignancy. Special emphasis is given also on intriguing insights into the relationship between obesity and BC as well as on the role of novel adipokines in BC development.Recent evidence has underscored the role of the triad of obesity, , and adipokines in postmenopausal BC. Adipokines exert independent and joint effects on activation of major intracellular signal networks implicated in BC cell proliferation, growth, survival, invasion, and metastasis, particularly in the context of obesity, considered a systemic endocrine dysfunction characterized by chronic inflammation. To date, more than 10 adipokines have been linked to BC, and this catalog is continuously increasing. The majority of circulating adipokines, such as leptin, resistin, visfatin, apelin, lipocalin 2, osteopontin, and oncostatin M, is elevated in BC, while some adipokines such as adiponectin and irisin (adipo-myokine) are generally decreased in BC and considered protective against breast carcinogenesis. Further evidence from basic and translational research is necessary to delineate the ontological role of adipokines and their interplay in BC pathogenesis. More large-scale clinical and longitudinal studies are awaited to assess their clinical utility in BC prognosis and follow-up. Finally, novel more effective and safer adipokine-centered therapeutic strategies could pave the way for targeted oncotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635190>A Case of Paraphilia with Osteoporosis and Administered with Depot Leuprorelin.</a></h2><p>Paraphilia is a complex psychological and psychiatric disorder that has been difficult to treat. Leuprorelin has been used as one of the therapeutic methods for paraphilia. Leuprorelin administration could change  and accelerate bone loss. The case study in this work was a 59-year-old man who visited a hospital with the chief complaints of frotteuristic behaviors in public places, a continuous increase in sexual desire, and sexual molestation behavior that started in 2007. We injected leuprorelin (3.6 mg) intramuscularly every month for this patient with paraphilia and comorbidities of osteoporosis and hyperthyroidism. The clinical global impression (CGI), Sex Addiction Screening Test (SAST), Wilson Sex Fantasy Questionnaire (WSFQ), physical examination, and laboratory tests were performed. After 12 months of leuprorelin injection for paraphilia, we found a significant improvement in abnormal sexual behavior/desire without aggravation of osteoporosis/hyperthyroidism. Gonadotrophin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) analogs could be used as alternative or supplementary treatment methods for paraphilia with osteoporosis/hyperthyroidism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644972>Mitochondrial dysfunction is the cause of one of the earliest changes seen on magnetic resonance imaging in Charcot neuroarthopathy - Oedema of the small muscles in the foot.</a></h2><p>The hypothesis laid out in this thesis states that the early changes seen on an MR imaging in those with early Charcot neuroarthopathy may be due to mitochondrial dysfunction. In a Charcot foot, there is movement between bones. In an attempt to prevent this movement, the small muscles of the foot contract continuously when the foot is weight bearing. This contraction takes energy in the form of ATP. However, the reduction of glucose transport into the muscle cells due to  / insufficiency, leads to reduction in the ATP producing capacity of the mitochondria. The ATP depletion affects the cell membrane gradient leading to mitochondrial and cellular swelling. These early cellular changes could then be picked up with MR imaging as muscle oedema.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

A Review and Evaluation of Preoperative Carbohydrate Loading in the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Model.</a></h2><p>Preoperative carbohydrate loading is a contemporary element of the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) paradigm. In addition to intraoperative surgical and anesthetic modifications and postoperative care practices, preoperative optimization is essential to good postsurgical outcomes. What was long held as dogma, a period of prolonged fasting prior to the administration of anesthesia, was later re-examined and challenged. Along with the proposed physiologic effects of decreasing the surgical stress response and , preoperative carbohydrate loading was also demonstrated to improve patient satisfaction and well-being, without an increase in perioperative complications. The benefits are most strongly observed in abdominal and cardiac surgery patients, but there has also been data which support its use in other specialties and surgeries. Barriers to the adoption of perioperative carbohydrate loading are few, but importantly include overcoming the inertia to modify older and more restrictive fasting guidelines and achieving the multidisciplinary consensus necessary to implement such changes. Despite these challenges, and with an existing body of evidence supporting its benefits, preoperative carbohydrate loading presents a significant contribution to the ERAS programs.© 2019 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.</p></html>
