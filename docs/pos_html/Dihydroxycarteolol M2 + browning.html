<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25934704>Inhibition of Sam68 triggers adipose tissue .</a></h2><p>Obesity is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes; molecular mechanisms that promote energy expenditure can be utilized for effective therapy. Src-associated in mitosis of 68 kDa (Sam68) is potentially significant, because knockout (KO) of Sam68 leads to markedly reduced adiposity. In the present study, we sought to determine the mechanism by which Sam68 regulates adiposity and energy homeostasis. We first found that Sam68 KO mice have a significantly reduced body weight as compared to controls, and the difference is explained entirely by decreased adiposity. Interestingly, these effects were not mediated by a difference in food intake; rather, they were associated with enhanced physical activity. When they were fed a high-fat diet, Sam68 KO mice gained much less body weight and fat mass than their WT littermates did, and they displayed an improved glucose and insulin tolerance. In Sam68 KO mice, the brown adipose tissue (BAT), inguinal, and epididymal depots were smaller, and their adipocytes were less hypertrophied as compared to their WT littermates. The BAT of Sam68 KO mice exhibited reduced lipid stores and expressed higher levels of Ucp1 and key thermogenic and fatty acid oxidation genes. Similarly, depots of inguinal and epididymal white adipose tissue (WAT) in Sam68 KO mice appeared browner, their multilocular Ucp1-positive cells were much more abundant, and the expression of Ucp1, Cidea, Prdm16, and Ppargc1a genes was greater as compared to WT controls, which suggests that the loss of Sam68 also promotes WAT . Furthermore, in all of the fat depots of the Sam68 KO mice, the expression of  macrophage markers was up-regulated, and that of M1 markers was down-regulated. Thus, Sam68 plays a crucial role in controlling thermogenesis and may be targeted to combat obesity and associated disorders.© 2015 Society for Endocrinology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24923386>Exercise mitigates the adverse effects of hyperhomocysteinemia on macrophages, MMP-9, skeletal muscle, and white adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Regular exercise is a great medicine with its benefits encompassing everything from prevention of cardiovascular risk to alleviation of different muscular myopathies. Interestingly, elevated levels of homocysteine (Hcy), also known as hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), antagonizes beta-2 adrenergic receptors (β2AR), gamma amino butyric acid (GABA), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) receptors. HHcy also stimulates an elevation of the M1/ macrophage ratio, resulting in a more inflammatory profile. In this review we discuss several potential targets altered by HHcy that result in myopathy and excessive fat accumulation. Several of these HHcy mediated changes can be countered by exercise and culminate into mitigation of HHcy induced myopathy and metabolic syndrome. We suggest that exercise directly impacts levels of Hcy, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), macrophages, and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs, especially Gs). While HHcy promotes the M1 macrophage phenotype, it appears that exercise may diminish the M1/ ratio, resulting in a less inflammatory phenotype. HHcy through its influence on GPCRs, specifically β₂AR, PPARγ and GABA receptors, promotes accumulation of white fat, whereas exercise enhances the  of white fat and counters HHcy-mediated effects on GPCRs. Alleviation of HHcy-associated pathologies with exercise also includes reversal of excessive MMP-9 activation. Moreover, exercise, by reducing plasma Hcy levels, may prevent skeletal muscle myopathy, improve exercise capacity and rescue the obese phenotype. The purpose of this review is to summarize the pathological conditions surrounding HHcy and to clarify the importance of regular exercise as a method of disease prevention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28346409>The metabolic ER stress sensor IRE1α suppresses alternative activation of macrophages and impairs energy expenditure in obesity.</a></h2><p>Obesity is associated with metabolic inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, both of which promote metabolic disease progression. Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) are key players orchestrating metabolic inflammation, and ER stress enhances macrophage activation. However, whether ER stress pathways underlie ATM regulation of energy homeostasis remains unclear. Here, we identified inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) as a critical switch governing M1- macrophage polarization and energy balance. Myeloid-specific IRE1α abrogation in Ern1; Lyz2-Cre mice largely reversed high-fat diet (HFD)-induced M1- imbalance in white adipose tissue (WAT) and blocked HFD-induced obesity, insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia and hepatic steatosis. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity, WAT  and energy expenditure were significantly higher in Ern1; Lyz2-Cre mice. Furthermore, IRE1α ablation augmented  polarization of macrophages in a cell-autonomous manner. Thus, IRE1α senses protein unfolding and metabolic and immunological states, and consequently guides ATM polarization. The macrophage IRE1α pathway drives obesity and metabolic syndrome through impairing BAT activity and WAT .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30071056>Association of serum concentrations of irisin and the adipokines adiponectin and leptin with epicardial  in cardiovascular surgery patients.</a></h2><p>Epicardial  located adjacent to the heart and coronary arteries is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Irisin is a myokine produced by skeletal muscle after physical exercise, and originally described as a molecule able to promote the browning of white adipose tissue and energy expenditure. In order to decrease cardiovascular risk, it has been proposed as a promising therapeutic target in obesity and type 2 diabetes. We investigated the relationships between serum concentrations of irisin and the adipokines adiponectin and leptin and body  including epicardial  in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. We obtained serum samples from 93 patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery (age 69.6 (SD 12.8) years, BMI 24.1 ± 4.8 kg/). Computed tomography (CT) and echocardiographic data were obtained from the routine preoperative examination. Subcutaneous  area (SFA, cm2) and visceral  area (VFA, cm2) near the umbilicus were automatically measured using the standard  attenuation range. Epicardial  area (EFA, cm2) was measured at the position where the heart became a long axis image with respect to the apex of the heart in the coronal section image. Total body  mass, body  percentage, and skeletal muscle volume (SMV) were estimated using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Serum irisin concentration was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and compared with adiponectin and leptin concentrations. The data were also compared with the clinical biochemical data. EFA was strongly correlated with BMI (P = 0.0001), non-HDL-C (P = 0.029), TG (P = 0.004), body  mass (P = 0.0001), and body  percentage (P = 0.0001). Serum leptin concentration showed a significant positive correlation with BMI (P = 0.0001) and TG (P = 0.001). Adiponectin, but not irisin, showed a significant negative correlation with BMI (P = 0.006) and TG (P = 0.001). Serum leptin level had a significant positive correlation with EFA, VFA, and SFA. In contrast, the serum adiponectin level was significantly negatively correlated with EFA, VFA, and SFA. The serum irisin level was also negatively correlated with EFA (r = -0.249, P = 0.015), and SFA (r = -0.223, P = 0.039), and tended to correlate with VFA (r = -0.198, P = 0.067). The serum level of adiponectin was negatively correlated with that of leptin (r = -0.296, P = 0.012), but there were no significant correlations between irisin and either adiponectin or leptin. Multivariate linear regression demonstrated that EFA showed a positive association with serum leptin level (β = 0.438, P = 0.0001) and a negative correlation with serum irisin level (β = -0.204, P = 0.038) and serum adiponectin level (β = -0.260, P = 0.015) after adjusting for age, sex, and BMI. The present study provided the first evidence of associations of the serum irisin and adipokines (adiponectin and leptin) concentrations with epicardial  in cardiovascular surgery patients. Irisin may play a role in preventing excess adiposity including epicardial , and consequently cardiovascular risk in patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28579299>SGLT2 Inhibition by Empagliflozin Promotes Fat Utilization and  and Attenuates Inflammation and Insulin Resistance by Polarizing  Macrophages in Diet-induced Obese Mice.</a></h2><p>Sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 2 inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion (UGE), leading to blood glucose reductions and weight loss. However, the impacts of SGLT2 inhibition on energy homeostasis and obesity-induced insulin resistance are less well known. Here, we show that empagliflozin, a SGLT2 inhibitor, enhanced energy expenditure and attenuated inflammation and insulin resistance in high-fat-diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. C57BL/6J mice were pair-fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or a HFD with empagliflozin for 16weeks. Empagliflozin administration increased UGE in the DIO mice, whereas it suppressed HFD-induced weight gain, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. Moreover, empagliflozin shifted energy metabolism towards fat utilization, elevated AMP-activated protein kinase and acetyl-CoA carbolxylase phosphorylation in skeletal muscle, and increased hepatic and plasma fibroblast growth factor 21 levels. Importantly, empagliflozin increased energy expenditure, heat production, and the expression of uncoupling protein 1 in brown fat and in inguinal and epididymal white adipose tissue (WAT). Furthermore, empagliflozin reduced M1-polarized macrophage accumulation while inducing the anti-inflammatory  phenotype of macrophages within WAT and liver, lowering plasma TNFα levels and attenuating obesity-related chronic inflammation. Thus, empagliflozin suppressed weight gain by enhancing fat utilization and  and attenuated obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance by polarizing  macrophages in WAT and liver.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Fewer studies have similarly shown sialic acid (SA) to be a predictor of obesity-related diseases, but importantly SA shows less intra-individual variability than CRP and acts as an integrated marker of the activity of a number of acute-phase proteins. This study examines the association between both CRP and SA with individual and combined features of the metabolic syndrome.In all, 257 women with a body mass index (BMI) ranging from 25.1 to 54.5 kg/ (geometric mean 33.1+/-5.8 kg/) and aged 19-71 y (mean 45.6+/-12.1 y) were studied. Subjects had no symptoms of intercurrent infection, known diabetes, treated dyslipidaemia, a chronic inflammatory condition, liver disease or malignancy.Linear regression demonstrates that both CRP and SA were positively associated with weight, BMI, insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia and hypertension. There was a highly significant (P<0.0001) positive association of both SA and CRP with none, one, two, three or four features of the metabolic syndrome. For a 1 s.d. (4.0 mg/l) increase in CRP, there was a significant increased risk when comparing the odds of having metabolic syndrome (defined as three or more individual features) compared with the remainder of the population (odds ratio=1.7, P<0.0001), but this was not significant after adjustment for BMI. However, for a 1 s.d. (0.34 mmol/l) increase in SA, the odds of having metabolic syndrome compared with those without metabolic syndrome was 2.5 (P<0.0001), and persisted after additional adjustment for BMI (adjusted odds ratio=1.9, P<0.0001).While SA and CRP are both univariately associated with individual features of the metabolic syndrome, SA, but not CRP, is significantly associated with the metabolic syndrome, independent of BMI. We conclude that SA identifies a subgroup of overweight individuals with an inflammatory phenotype, who are at the greatest risk of metabolic syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30122557>CXCL14, a Brown Adipokine that Mediates Brown--to-Macrophage Communication in Thermogenic Adaptation.</a></h2><p>The beneficial effects of brown adipose tissue (BAT) are attributed to its capacity to oxidize metabolites and produce heat, but recent data suggest that secretory properties of BAT may also be involved. Here, we identify the chemokine CXCL14 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand-14) as a novel regulatory factor secreted by BAT in response to thermogenic activation. We found that the CXCL14 released by brown adipocytes recruited alternatively activated () macrophages. Cxcl14-null mice exposed to cold showed impaired BAT activity and low recruitment of macrophages, mainly of the  phenotype, into BAT. CXCL14 promoted the browning of white  and ameliorated glucose/insulin homeostasis in high--diet-induced obese mice. Impairment of type 2 cytokine signaling, as seen in Stat6-null mice, blunts the action of CXCL14, promoting adipose tissue browning. We propose that active BAT is a source of CXCL14, which concertedly promotes adaptive thermogenesis via  macrophage recruitment, BAT activation, and the browning of white .Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of telmisartan on macrophage polarization in association with its  capacity, because PPARγ plays a key role in  polarization and in the  of white adipocytes. Telmisartan induced  marker expression in murine macrophages concentration dependently, which was confirmed by flow cytometry. Both PPARγ and PPARδ activations appear to be responsible for telmisartan-induced  polarization. Telmisartan-treated conditioned medium (Tel-CM) of RAW264.7 cells and of bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) induced the expressions of  markers in fully differentiated white adipocytes with reduced lipid droplets, and increased oxygen consumption rate and mitochondrial biogenesis. Levels of catecholamines (CA) released into the conditioned medium as well as intracellular tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNAs were found to be increased by telmisartan, and  effects of Tel-CM were lessened by β3 receptor antagonist (L-748,337), suggesting CA secreted into CM play a role in Tel-CM-induced adipocyte . Acute administration of telmisartan (2 weeks, p.o.) to C57BL/6J mice increased the expressions of  markers and  markers in white adipose tissues, whereas macrophage depletion by clodronate liposome pretreatment attenuated the telmisartan-induced expressions of  markers. Together, telmisartan was observed to induce the  of fully differentiated white adipocytes, at least in part, via PPAR activation-mediated  polarization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28801784>Prior Repeated Stress Attenuates Cold-Induced Immunomodulation Associated with "Browning" in Mesenteric  of Rats.</a></h2><p>Continuous exposure to cold leads to activation of adaptive thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue but also to induction of brown/beige cell phenotype in white adipose tissue. The aim of this work was to investigate whether prior exposure to immobilization (IMO) stress may affect immune response associated with adipocyte "browning" in mesenteric adipose tissue (mWAT). In the first experiment, Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to acute (3 h) or prolonged (7 days) cold exposure (4 ± 1 °C). 7-day cold stimulated gene expression of uncoupling protein 1 and other "browning"-associated factors. In the second experiment, rats were immobilized for 7 days (2 h daily) followed by exposure to continuous cold for 1 or 7 days. Prior IMO exaggerated cold-induced sympathetic response manifested by elevated tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) protein and norepinephrine in mWAT. Induction of non-sympathetic catecholamine production demonstrated by elevated TH and PNMT (phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase) mRNAs was observed after 7-day cold; however, prior IMO attenuated this response. 7-day cold-induced gene expression of anti-inflammatory mediators (IL-4, IL-13, IL-10, adiponectin), markers of  macrophages (Arg1, Retnlα), and eosinophil-associated molecules (eotaxin, IL-5), while inhibited expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFNγ, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-17) and monocytes (MCP-1, Ly6C). This immune response was accompanied by elevated expression of uncoupling protein-1 and other thermogenic factors. Rats exposed to prior IMO exhibited inhibition of cold-induced immune and "browning"-related expression pattern. Overall, we demonstrated that 7-day cold-induced browning"-associated changes in rat mWAT, while prior history of repeated stress prevented this response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29039412>Intermittent fasting promotes adipose thermogenesis and metabolic homeostasis via VEGF-mediated alternative activation of macrophage.</a></h2><p>Intermittent fasting (IF), a periodic energy restriction, has been shown to provide health benefits equivalent to prolonged fasting or caloric restriction. However, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of IF-mediated metabolic benefits is limited. Here we show that isocaloric IF improves metabolic homeostasis against diet-induced obesity and metabolic dysfunction primarily through adipose thermogenesis in mice. IF-induced metabolic benefits require fasting-mediated increases of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in white adipose tissue (WAT). Furthermore, periodic adipose-VEGF overexpression could recapitulate the metabolic improvement of IF in non-fasted animals. Importantly, fasting and adipose-VEGF induce alternative activation of adipose macrophage, which is critical for thermogenesis. Human adipose gene analysis further revealed a positive correlation of adipose VEGF- macrophage-WAT browning axis. The present study uncovers the molecular mechanism of IF-mediated metabolic benefit and suggests that isocaloric IF can be a preventive and therapeutic approach against obesity and metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7960604>A phase II trial of didemnin B in myeloma.

Evidence suggests that anti- antibody responses following influenza A virus infection are weak and/or transient. We show that the seroprevalence of anti- antibodies increased with age in 317 serum samples from healthy individuals in the United States in 2007-2008. Infection with 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus (A[H1N1]pdm09) elicited a recall serum antibody response to  protein of A(H1N1)pdm09 in 47% of the affected 118 individuals tested. Anti- antibody responses were more robust among individuals with preexisting antibodies to  protein. Moreover, the antibodies induced as a result of infection with A(H1N1)pdm09 were cross-reactive with  protein of seasonal influenza A viruses. These results emphasize the need to further investigate the possible roles of anti- antibodies in human influenza A virus infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26167415>Injecting engineered anti-inflammatory macrophages therapeutically induces white adipose tissue  and improves diet-induced insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>We recently exploited a transgenic approach to coerce macrophage anti-inflammatory  polarization in vivo by lowering Receptor Interacting Protein 140 (RIP140) level in macrophages (mφRIP140KD), which induced  of white adipose tissue (WAT). In vitro, conditioned medium from cultured adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) of mφRIP140KD mice could trigger preadipocytes' differentiation into beige cells. Here we describe a cell therapy for treating high fat diet (HFD)-induced insulin resistance (IR). Injecting  ATMs retrieved from the WAT of mφRIP140KD mice into HFD-fed obese adult wild-type mice effectively triggers their WAT , reduces their pro-inflammatory responses, and improves their insulin sensitivity. These data provide a proof-of-concept that delivering engineered anti-inflammatory macrophages can trigger white fat , stimulate whole-body thermogenesis, and reduce obesity-associated IR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474682>Co-Administration of Curcumin and Artepillin C Induces Development of Brown-Like Adipocytes in Association with Local Norepinephrine Production by Alternatively Activated Macrophages in Mice.</a></h2><p>Classical brown adipocytes, characterized by interscapular depots, have multilocular fat depots and are known to release excess energy. Recent studies have shown that induction of brown-like adipocytes, also referred to as beige or brite cells, in white adipose tissue (WAT) results in the release of excess energy through mitochondrial heat production via uncoupling protein 1. This has potential a therapeutic strategy for obesity and related diseases as well as classical brown adipocytes. In our previous studies, we found that artepillin C (ArtC, 10 mg/kg body weight), a characteristic constituent of Brazilian propolis, significantly induced the development of brown-like adipocytes in inguinal WAT (iWAT) of mice. Furthermore, we recently demonstrated that curcumin (Cur, 4.5 mg/kg) also significantly induced the development of brown-like adipocytes in mice. The combined administration of several food-derived factors can enhance their bioactivity and reduce their required functional doses. In this study, we showed that co-administration of Cur and ArtC at lower doses (Cur, 1.5 mg/kg; ArtC, 5 mg/kg) additively induce brown-like adipocyte development in mouse iWAT. Moreover, this induction is associated with the localized production of norepinephrine following accumulation of alternatively activated macrophages in iWAT. These findings suggest that co-administration of Cur and ArtC is significantly effective to reduce the dose and enhance the formation of brown-like adipocyte via a unique molecular mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31222070>Adaptive adipose tissue stromal plasticity in response to cold stress and antibody-based metabolic therapy.</a></h2><p>In response to environmental and nutrient stress, adipose tissues must establish a new homeostatic state. Here we show that cold exposure of obese mice triggers an adaptive tissue remodeling in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) that involves extracellular matrix deposition, angiogenesis, sympathetic innervation, and adipose tissue . Obese VAT is predominated by pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages; cold exposure induces an M1-to- shift in macrophage composition and dramatic changes in macrophage gene expression in both M1 and  macrophages. Antibody-mediated CSF1R blocking prevented the cold-induced recruitment of adipose tissue  macrophages, suggesting the role of CSF1R signaling in the process. These cold-induced effects in obese VAT are phenocopied by an administration of the FGF21-mimetic antibody, consistent with its action to stimulate sympathetic nerves. Collectively, these studies illuminate adaptive visceral adipose tissue plasticity in obese mice in response to cold stress and antibody-based metabolic therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26569380>Microbiota depletion promotes  of white adipose tissue and reduces obesity.</a></h2><p>Brown adipose tissue (BAT) promotes a lean and healthy phenotype and improves insulin sensitivity. In response to cold or exercise, brown fat cells also emerge in the white adipose tissue (WAT; also known as beige cells), a process known as . Here we show that the development of functional beige fat in the inguinal subcutaneous adipose tissue (ingSAT) and perigonadal visceral adipose tissue (pgVAT) is promoted by the depletion of microbiota either by means of antibiotic treatment or in germ-free mice. This leads to improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and decreased white fat and adipocyte size in lean mice, obese leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Such metabolic improvements are mediated by eosinophil infiltration, enhanced type 2 cytokine signaling and  macrophage polarization in the subcutaneous white fat depots of microbiota-depleted animals. The metabolic phenotype and the  of the subcutaneous fat are impaired by the suppression of type 2 cytokine signaling, and they are reversed by recolonization of the antibiotic-treated or germ-free mice with microbes. These results provide insight into the microbiota-fat signaling axis and beige-fat development in health and metabolic disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3965629>Phase I trial of misonidazole (NSC#261037) plus cyclophosphamide in solid tumors.</a></h2><p>Misonidazole, a hypoxic cell sensitizer, enhances the antitumor effects of cyclophosphamide in preclinical studies. Several studies also showed increased cytotoxicity for normal tissues. We undertook a phase I study of this combination. The regimen consisted of oral administration of misonidazole at one of two dose levels, 1 g/ and 2 g/, followed by an intravenous (IV) injection of cyclophosphamide four hours later. The cycle was repeated every twenty-one days. The dose of misonidazole remained constant for each regimen, but the dose of cyclophosphamide ranged from 0.4 g/ to 1.3 g/. Thirty-eight trials in 35 patients with advanced solid tumors were considered evaluable. Dose-limiting toxicity was granulocytopenia at 1 g/ of cyclophosphamide without significant thrombocytopenia or anemia. Peripheral neuropathy was negligible. Two patients received cumulative doses of 8 and 16 g/ of misonidazole without neurotoxicity. One patient developed hemorrhagic cystitis. Nausea and vomiting was mild to moderate. Possible evidence of tumor stabilization was seen in three patients, and one patient had a mixed response. The mean serum half-life for misonidazole was 11.3 hours (range, 8.4 to 20.0) and for cyclophosphamide 8.3 hours (range, 3.2 to 15.5), both within the previously reported ranges. In conclusion, it appears that this combination is well tolerated and that misonidazole does not significantly potentiate myelotoxicity caused by cyclophosphamide or alter its pharmacokinetics. The recommended starting doses for misonidazole and cyclophosphamide in phase II trials using this schedule of administration should be 2 g/ and 1 g/, respectively, with escalation for cyclophosphamide to individual tolerance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15254884>Discrimination ratio analysis of inflammatory markers: implications for the study of inflammation in chronic disease.</a></h2><p>To understand the role of inflammation in chronic disease it is important to have a reliable measure of habitual inflammatory status. A number of acute-phase response markers have been used as measures of inflammatory status, but the ability of a single measure to appropriately reflect habitual inflammatory status has not been assessed. This study compares the ability of different inflammatory markers to characterize habitual inflammatory status in overweight women. A single fasting blood sample was taken from 86 overweight women (mean body mass index [BMI], 35.2 kg/; range, 26.2 to 47.6 kg/) and a number of inflammatory markers (both acute-phase response markers and cytokines) were measured. A randomly selected subpopulation of 15 women attended on 2 further occasions for further blood samples. Using the subpopulation, discrimination ratios (DRs) were calculated for each inflammatory marker to assess the within-subject variability. The DRs were then used to determine the relationship between these markers, adjusted for within-subject variability, in the whole population. In this highly controlled experimental environment, interleukin-6 (IL-6), with a DR of 3.71, was the cytokine with the greatest ability to discriminate between subjects, suggesting that it is best able to characterize habitual inflammatory status. Sialic acid was the acute-phase response marker with the highest DR (3.16), and showed stronger correlations with other inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), than IL-6. This study suggests that use of some inflammatory markers, such as CRP, with large within-individual variability, will underestimate the relationship between inflammation and disease, and thus relationships between inflammation and chronic disease may be stronger than previously appreciated. Future studies should consider IL-6 or sialic acid to provide a more robust measure of inflammatory status.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31362242>circNrxn2 Promoted WAT  via Sponging miR-103 to Relieve Its Inhibition of FGF10 in HFD Mice.</a></h2><p>The accumulation of excess white adipose tissue (WAT) has harmful consequences on metabolic health. WAT  confers beneficial effects on adiposity, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia. In this study, it was found out that circNrxn2 sponged miR-103 and enhanced FGF10 levels in HFD mice WAT. We discovered that circNrxn2 promoted WAT  and mitochondria functions. Furthermore, circNrxn2 also increased  macrophage polarization in HFD mouse adipose tissue, and the PPARγ signaling pathway participated in these biological processes. Moreover, eliminating adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) by clodronate-crippled circNrxn2 promoted WAT , and the simulation co-culture of macrophages and adipocytes results suggested that circNrxn2 promoted WAT  through increasing  macrophage polarization. Our finding revealed that circNrxn2 acted as an endogenous miR-103 sponge, blocked miR-103 effects, and relieved its inhibition of FGF10 expression to promote WAT  through increasing  macrophage polarization.

We show that CR stimulates development of functional beige fat within the subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue, contributing to decreased white fat and adipocyte size in lean C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice kept at room temperature or at thermoneutrality and in obese leptin-deficient mice. These metabolic changes are mediated by increased eosinophil infiltration, type 2 cytokine signaling, and  macrophage polarization in fat of CR animals. Suppression of the type 2 signaling, using Il4ra(-/-), Stat6(-/-), or mice transplanted with Stat6(-/-) bone marrow-derived hematopoietic cells, prevents the CR-induced  and abrogates the subcutaneous fat loss and the metabolic improvements induced by CR. These results provide insights into the overall energy homeostasis during CR, and they suggest beige fat development as a common feature in conditions of negative energy balance.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Nutritherapeutic approaches are being considered, such as supplementary Vitamin D , to improve aspects of metabolic syndrome, namely fatty liver disease, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance associated with obesity.We analyzed female LDLR and LDLR mice on a 10-week diabetogenic diet for markers of fatty liver disease, metabolic strain, and inflammation.The groups on a high fat high sugar diet with supplementary Vitamin D , in comparison with the groups on a high fat high sugar diet alone, showed improved transaminase levels, significantly less hypertriglyceridemia and hyperinsulinemia, and histologically, there was less pericentral hepatic steatosis. Levels of non-esterified fatty acids and lipid peroxidation products were significantly lower in the group supplemented with additional Vitamin D , as were systemic markers of inflammation (serum endotoxin and IL-6).  macrophage phenotype predominated in the group supplemented with additional Vitamin D . Beneficial changes were observed as early as five weeks' supplementation with Vitamin D and extended to restoration of high fat high sugar diet induced decrease of bone mineral density.In summary, Vitamin D was a significantly beneficial dietary additive to blunt a prediabetic phenotype in diet-induced obesity of female LDLR and LDLR mice.© 2017 The Authors.

We here show that acute loss of TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) in adipocytes results in an increased rate of apoptotic adipocyte death and increased numbers of  macrophages in white adipose tissue. Mice with adipocyte-specific TAK1 deficiency have reduced adipocyte numbers and are resistant to obesity induced by a high-fat diet or leptin deficiency. In addition, adipocyte-specific TAK1-deficient mice under a high-fat diet showed increased energy expenditure, which was accompanied by enhanced expression of the uncoupling protein UCP1. Interestingly, acute induction of adipocyte-specific TAK1 deficiency in mice already under a high-fat diet was able to stop further weight gain and improved glucose tolerance. Thus, loss of TAK1 in adipocytes reduces the total number of adipocytes, increases  of white adipose tissue, and may be an attractive strategy to treat obesity, obesity-dependent diabetes, and other associated complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31374571>Persistent low body weight in humans is associated with higher mitochondrial activity in white adipose tissue.</a></h2><p>Constitutional thinness (CT) is a state of low but stable body weight (BMI ≤18 kg/). CT subjects have normal-range hormonal profiles and food intake but exhibit resistance to weight gain despite living in the modern world's obesogenic environment.The goal of this study is to identify molecular mechanisms underlying this protective phenotype against weight gain.We conducted a clinical overfeeding study on 30 CT subjects and 30 controls (BMI 20-25 kg/) matched for age and sex. We performed clinical and integrative molecular and transcriptomic analyses on white adipose and muscle tissues.Our results demonstrate that adipocytes were markedly smaller in CT individuals (mean ± SEM: 2174 ± 142 μm 2) compared with controls (3586 ± 216 μ) (P < 0.01). The mitochondrial respiratory capacity was higher in CT adipose tissue, particularly at the level of complex II of the electron transport chain (2.2-fold increase; P < 0.01). This higher activity was paralleled by an increase in mitochondrial number (CT compared with control: 784 ± 27 compared with 675 ± 30 mitochondrial DNA molecules per cell; P < 0.05). No evidence for uncoupled respiration or "" of the white adipose tissue was found. In accordance with the mitochondrial differences, CT subjects had a distinct adipose transcriptomic profile [62 differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate of 0.1 and log fold change >0.75)], with many differentially expressed genes associating with positive metabolic outcomes. Pathway analyses revealed an increase in fatty acid oxidation ( P = 3 × 10-04) but also triglyceride biosynthesis (P = 3.6 × 10-04). No differential response to the overfeeding was observed in the 2 groups.The distinct molecular signature of the adipose tissue in CT individuals suggests the presence of augm ented futile lipid cycling, rather than mitochondrial uncoupling, as a way to increase energy expenditure in CT individuals. We propose that increased mitochondrial function in adipose tissue is an important mediator in sustaining the low body weight in CT individuals. This knowledge could ultimately allow more targeted approaches for weight management treatment strategies.

Particularly, obesity-induced metabolic endotoxemia plays an important role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and inflammation. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a key regulator of antioxidant signaling that serves as a primary cellular defense against the cytotoxic effects of oxidative stress. Pharmacological stimulation of Nrf2 mitigates obesity and insulin resistance in mice; however, Nrf2 activators are not clinically available due to biosafety concerns. A recent study demonstrated that glucoraphanin, a precursor of the Nrf2 activator sulforaphane, ameliorates obesity by enhancing energy expenditure and browning of white adipose tissue, and attenuates obesity-related inflammation and insulin resistance by polarizing  macrophages and reducing metabolic endotoxemia. Thus, this review focuses on the efficiency and safety of glucoraphanin in alleviating obesity, insulin resistance, and NAFLD.

BAT contributes to non-shivering thermogenesis in a cold environment; WAT stores energy and produces adipokines that fine-tune metabolic and inflammatory responses. Obesity is often characterized by over-expansion and inflammation of WAT where inflammatory cells/mediators are abundant, especially pro-inflammatory (M1) macrophages, resulting in chronic low-grade inflammation and leading to insulin resistance and metabolic complications. Macrophages constitute the major component of innate immunity and can be activated as a M1 or  (anti-inflammatory) phenotype in response to environmental stimuli. Polarized M1 macrophage causes AT inflammation, whereas polarized  macrophage promotes WAT remodeling into the BAT phenotype, also known as WAT /beiging, which enhances insulin sensitivity and metabolic health. This review will discuss the regulation of AT homeostasis in relation to innate immunity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29376471>Emerging roles of SGLT2 inhibitors in obesity and insulin resistance: Focus on  browning and macrophage polarization.</a></h2><p>Obesity-associated low-grade inflammation underlies insulin resistance and associated metabolic comorbidities, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Excessive ectopic  deposition in obesity causes disorders of energy homeostasis and low-grade chronic inflammation in metabolic tissues. In particular, obesity-induced recruitment and activation of adipose tissue macrophages play a key role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and T2D. Therefore, treatment options for energy  and macrophage polarization in obese subjects are needed. Sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 2 inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion by inhibiting renal glucose reabsorption, thereby having subsequent anti-hyperglycemic effects and reducing body weight. We recently reported that the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin increases  utilization and browning in white adipose tissue and attenuates obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance by activating  macrophages. Thus, this review focuses on the beneficial effects of empagliflozin in energy homeostasis and obesity-related inflammation and insulin resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20403783>Monitoring of posture allocations and activities by a shoe-based wearable sensor.</a></h2><p>Monitoring of posture allocations and activities enables accurate estimation of energy expenditure and may aid in obesity prevention and treatment. At present, accurate devices rely on multiple sensors distributed on the body and thus may be too obtrusive for everyday use. This paper presents a novel wearable sensor, which is capable of very accurate recognition of common postures and activities. The patterns of heel acceleration and plantar pressure uniquely characterize postures and typical activities while requiring minimal preprocessing and no feature extraction. The shoe sensor was tested in nine adults performing sitting and standing postures and while walking, running, stair ascent/descent and cycling. Support vector machines (SVMs) were used for classification. A fourfold validation of a six-class subject-independent group model showed 95.2% average accuracy of posture/activity classification on full sensor set and over 98% on optimized sensor set. Using a combination of acceleration/pressure also enabled a pronounced reduction of the sampling frequency (25 to 1 Hz) without significant loss of accuracy (98% versus 93%). Subjects had shoe sizes (US) M9.5-11 and W7-9 and body mass index from 18.1 to 39.4 kg/ and thus suggesting that the device can be used by individuals with varying anthropometric characteristics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27556337>The Impact of Maturity Stage on Cell Membrane Integrity and Enzymatic  Reactions in High Pressure Processed Peaches (Prunus persica).</a></h2><p>Fruit maturity is an important factor associated with final product quality, and it may have an effect on the level of  in peaches that are high pressure processed (HPP).

White adipose tissue (WAT) stores fuel and its expansion underlines insulin resistance (IR) whereas brown adipose tissue (BAT) burns fuel and stimulates insulin sensitivity. These two types of fats seesaw within our bodies via a regulatory mechanism that involves intricate communication between adipocytes and blood cells, particularly macrophages that migrate into adipose deposits. The coregulator, Receptor Interacting Protein 140 (RIP140), plays a key role in regulating this communication. In mice on a high-fat diet, the level of RIP140 in macrophages is dramatically elevated to activate their inflammatory M1 polarization and enhance their recruitment into WAT, facilitating IR. Conversely, lowering the level of RIP140 in macrophages not only reduces M1 macrophages but also expands alternatively polarized, anti-inflammatory  macrophages, triggering white adipose tissue , fat burning, and restoration of insulin sensitivity. This suggests a potential therapeutic strategy for reversing IR, obesity, and atherosclerotic or even cosmetic fat deposits: therapeutic  of white adipose deposits by diminishing RIP140 levels in macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17062685>Hoosier Oncology Group randomized phase II study of docetaxel, vinorelbine, and estramustine in combination in hormone-refractory prostate cancer with pharmacogenetic survival analysis.</a></h2><p>To determine the safety and efficacy of two docetaxel doublets in hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) patients and to examine the prognostic role of polymorphisms in host genes important to docetaxel metabolism and transport.Sixty-four chemotherapy-naive patients with HRPC were randomized to docetaxel and vinorelbine (D, 20 mg/ i.v. days 1 and 8; V, 25 mg/ i.v. days 1 and 8) or docetaxel and estramustine phosphate (D, 60-70 mg/ i.v. day 1; E, 280 mg oral thrice daily days 1-5) administered q21d.

However, its role in adaptive thermogenesis has scarcely been explored. Here we showed that chronic cold exposure led to a markedly elevated production of adiponectin in adipocytes of subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT), which in turn bound to  macrophages in the stromal vascular fraction. Chronic cold exposure-induced accumulation of  macrophages, activation of beige cells, and thermogenic program were markedly impaired in scWAT of adiponectin knockout (ADN KO) mice, whereas these impairments were reversed by replenishment with adiponectin. Mechanistically, adiponectin was recruited to the cell surface of  macrophages via its binding partner T-cadherin and promoted the cell proliferation by activation of Akt, consequently leading to beige cell activation. These findings uncover adiponectin as a key efferent signal for cold-induced adaptive thermogenesis by mediating the crosstalk between adipocytes and  macrophages in scWAT.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Previous studies have shown that type 2 cytokines and  macrophages induce cold-induced  in inguinal WAT (ingWAT) by producing catecholamines. Exactly how the conditional and partial depletion of CD206 -like macrophages regulates the cold-induced  of ingWAT, however, remains unknown. We examined the role of CD206 -like macrophages in the cold-induced  of WAT using genetically engineered CD206DTR mice, in which CD206 -like macrophages were conditionally depleted. The partial depletion of CD206 -like enhanced UCP1 expression in ingWAT, as shown by immunostaining, and also upregulated the expression of Ucp1 and other -related marker genes in ingWAT after cold exposure. A flow cytometry analysis showed that the partial depletion of CD206 -like macrophages caused an increase in the number of beige progenitors in ingWAT in response to cold. Thus, we concluded that CD206 -like macrophages inhibit the proliferation of beige progenitors and that the partial depletion of CD206 -like macrophages releases this inhibition, thereby enhancing  and insulin sensitivity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797958>Deficiency of heat shock protein A12A promotes  of white adipose tissues in mice.</a></h2><p> of white adipose tissues (WAT) is critical for a variety of physiological and pathophysiological events. Given the limited understanding in molecular control of WAT , further research is needed. Heat shock protein A12A (HSPA12A) is a new member of multigene Hsp70 family. This study investigated the effect of HSPA12A on the  of WAT. WAT  in mice was induced by cold exposure for 5 days. We observed that nuclear HSPA12A content was increased in WAT after cold exposure, while deficiency of HSPA12A (Hspa12a) promoted the cold-induced  of WAT in mice compared to wild type (WT) littermates. Accordingly, Hspa12a mice showed attenuation of body temperature drop and increase of thermogenic gene expression compared to WT mice after cold exposure. However, in vitro experiments demonstrated that HSPA12A deficiency in primary white adipocytes did not affect their  and thermogenic gene expression. Further loss- and gain-of-HSPA12A functional studies revealed that HSPA12A deficiency promoted whereas HSPA12A overexpression impeded  macrophage polarization. Importantly, the conditioned medium (CM) from Hspa12a bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) enhanced the  of primary white adipocytes when compared to the CM from WT BMDMs. The data identified macrophage HSPA12A as a novel regulator of WAT  through a paracrine mechanism. Targeting HSPA12A might provide meaningful advances for the management of -associated physiological events such as hypothermia adaptation and pathophysiological disorders such as obesity and cancer-related cachexia.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we demonstrate that subcutaneous adipose tissue of type 2 diabetics contains considerably more sphingolipids than non-diabetic, BMI-matched counterparts. Whole-body and adipose tissue-specific inhibition/deletion of serine palmitoyltransferase (Sptlc), the first enzyme in the sphingolipid biosynthesis cascade, in mice markedly altered adipose morphology and metabolism, particularly in subcutaneous adipose tissue. The reduction in adipose sphingolipids increased brown and beige/brite adipocyte numbers, mitochondrial activity, and insulin sensitivity. The manipulation also increased numbers of anti-inflammatory  macrophages in the adipose bed and induced secretion of insulin-sensitizing adipokines. By comparison, deletion of serine palmitoyltransferase from macrophages had no discernible effects on metabolic homeostasis or adipose function. These data indicate that newly synthesized adipocyte sphingolipids are nutrient signals that drive changes in the adipose phenotype to influence whole-body energy expenditure and nutrient metabolism.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Obesity, a key risk factor for many chronic health problems, is rising globally and is accompanied by low-grade inflammation in adipose tissues. The precise mechanism by which helminths modulate metabolic syndrome and obesity is not fully understood. We infected high  diet (HFD)-induced obese mice with the intestinal nematode parasite Heligmosomoides polygyrus and observed that helminth infection resulted in significantly attenuated obesity. Attenuated obesity corresponded with marked upregulation of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), a key protein involved in energy expenditure, in adipose tissue, suppression of glucose and triglyceride levels, and alteration in the expression of key genes involved in . Moreover, the attenuated obesity in infected mice was associated with enhanced helminth-induced Th2/Treg responses and  macrophage polarization. Adoptive transfer of helminth-stimulated  cells to mice that were not infected with H. polygyrus resulted in a significant amelioration of HFD-induced obesity and increased adipose tissue browning.

We examined the relationship between REE, physical activity (PA) participation and diet with  formation markers of subcutaneous WAT in healthy men. Materials and methods We assessed REE, diet and body composition of 32 healthy men [age (years): 36.06 ± 7.36, body mass index (BMI): 27.06 ± 4.62 (kg/)]. Participants also underwent measurements of PA [metabolic equivalent (MET)-min/week] using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), while they undertook a subcutaneous fat biopsy from the abdominal region to assess the mRNA expressions of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ). Results We found no associations between the UCP1, PGC-1α, PPARα and PPARγ mRNAs with REE, PA levels and diet (p > 0.05). However, the PGC-1α, PPARα and PPARγ mRNAs were more expressed in individuals displaying moderate rather than low PA levels (p < 0.05). Furthermore, PGC-1α, PPARα and PPARγ mRNAs were negatively correlated with fat mass percentage (p < 0.05). PGC-1α and PPARα mRNAs were also negatively correlated with BMI, while PGC-1α mRNA was inversely associated with waist-to-hip ratio (p < 0.05).

We tested whether inhibition of myostatin in mice can reverse these HFD-induced abnormalities.C57BL/6 mice were fed a HFD for 16 weeks including the final 4 weeks some mice were treated with an anti-myostatin peptibody. Body composition, the respiratory exchange ratio plus glucose and insulin tolerance tests were examined. Myostatin knock down in C2C12 cells was performed using small hairpin RNA lentivirus. Adipose tissue-derived stem cells were cultured to measure their responses to conditioned media from C2C12 cells lacking myostatin, or to recombinant myostatin or irisin. Isolated peritoneal macrophages were treated with myostatin or irisin to determine whether myostatin or irisin induce inflammatory mechanisms.In HFD-fed mice, peptibody treatment stimulated muscle growth and improved insulin resistance. The improved glucose and insulin tolerances were confirmed when we found increased muscle expression of p-Akt and the glucose transporter, Glut4. In HFD-fed mice, the peptibody suppressed macrophage infiltration and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in both the muscle and adipocytes. Inhibition of myostatin caused the conversion of white (WAT) to brown adipose tissue, whereas stimulating fatty acid oxidation and increasing energy expenditure. The related mechanism is a muscle-to-fat cross talk mediated by irisin. Myostatin inhibition increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, coactivator 1α expression and irisin production in the muscle. Irisin then stimulated WAT . Irisin also suppresses inflammation and stimulates macrophage polarization from M1 to  types.These results uncover a metabolic pathway from an increase in myostatin that suppresses irisin leading to the activation of inflammatory cytokines and insulin resistance. Thus, myostatin is a potential therapeutic target to treat insulin resistance of type II diabetes as well as the shortage of brown/beige fat in obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24969109>Reducing RIP140 expression in macrophage alters ATM infiltration, facilitates white adipose tissue , and prevents high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) recruitment and activation play a critical role in obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance (IR). The mechanism regulating ATM activation and infiltration remains unclear. In this study, we found receptor interacting protein 140 (RIP140) can regulate the dynamics of ATM that contribute to adipose tissue remodeling. A high-fat diet (HFD) elevates RIP140 expression in macrophages. We generated mice with RIP140 knockdown in macrophages using transgenic and bone marrow transplantation procedures to blunt HFD-induced elevation in RIP140. We detected significant white adipose tissue (WAT)  and improved systemic insulin sensitivity in these mice, particularly under an HFD feeding. These mice have decreased circulating monocyte population and altered ATM profile in WAT (a dramatic reduction in inflammatory classically activated macrophages [M1] and expansion in alternatively activated macrophages []), which could improve HFD-induced IR. These studies suggest that reducing RIP140 expression in monocytes/macrophages can be a new therapeutic strategy in treating HFD-induced and inflammation-related diseases.© 2014 by the American Diabetes Association.

Tumour cells direct the development of a locally immune suppressed state, affecting the activity of anti tumour T cells and preparing the escape phase of tumour development. Macrophages in the tumour typically develop into so-called tumour associated macrophages with a distinct profile of activities which lead to a reduction in inflammation and antigen presentation.
