Plasma ammonia concentrations increased to 411 microm within 1 h of the start of infusion of ammonium acetate at 567 mmol/h. The rate constant for ammonia clearance from plasma was 0 x 054/min and the half-life was 12 x 9 min. Infusion at 567 mmol/h for 1 h followed by 1 h without infusion, repeated four times between am- and pm-milking, caused a decrease in feed intake. Compared with sodium acetate, continuous infusion of ammonium acetate at 360 mmol/h throughout an entire 10-h milking interval increased plasma ammonia concentrations to 193 microm and caused a 20% decrease in milk, protein and lactose production with no effect on percentage composition of milk or the yield of milk . Arterial concentrations of glucose and non-esterified fatty acids tended to increase; there was no effect on arterial acetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate or triacylglcerol, and branched-chain amino acids,  and  decreased. Mammary plasma flow, estimated by assuming 100% uptake/output of Phe+, was significantly correlated with milk yield. Mammary uptakes of acetate tended to be reduced by hyperammonaemia, but uptakes of other energy metabolites and amino acids were not affected. Thus, while an increase in amino acid consumption during hyperammonaemia was apparent from the drop in circulating concentrations of Leu, Ile, Val,  and , there was no evidence to support the hypothesis that milk yield is affected by the lower concentrations. An ammonia-induced depression in feed intake may have caused the decrease in milk synthesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31013895>Eight Collagen Peptides from Hydrolysate Fraction of Spanish Mackerel Skins: Isolation, Identification, and In Vitro Antioxidant Activity Evaluation.</a></h1><p>A previous report indicated that collagen hydrolysate fraction (F7) from Spanish mackerel () skins showed high reducing power and radical scavenging activities on 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) (EC value of 1.57 mg/mL) and hydroxyl (EC value of 1.20 mg/mL). In this work, eight peptides were isolated from F7 and identified as Gly-Pro- (GPY, 335.31 Da), Gly-Pro--Gly-Glu (GPTGE, 459.47 Da), Pro-Phe-Gly-Pro-Asp (PFGPD, 531.52 Da), Gly-Pro--Gly-Ala- (GPTGAKG, 586.65 Da), Pro--Gly-Ala--Gly (PYGAKG, 591.69 Da), Gly-Ala--Gly-Pro-Gln-Gly (GATGPQG, 586.61 Da), Gly-Pro-Phe-Gly-Pro-Met (GPFGPM, 604.73 Da), and -Gly-Pro-Met (YGPM, 466.50 Da), respectively. Among them, PFGPD, PYGAKG, and YGPM exhibited strong radical scavenging activities on DPPH (EC values of 0.80, 3.02, and 0.72 mg/mL for PFGPD, PYGAKG, and YGPM, respectively), hydroxyl (EC values of 0.81, 0.66, and 0.88 mg/mL for PFGPD, PYGAKG, and YGPM, respectively), superoxide anion (EC values of 0.91, 0.80, and 0.73 mg/mL for PFGPD, PYGAKG, and YGPM, respectively), and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) cation (EC values of 0.86, 1.07, and 0.82 mg/mL for PFGPD, PYGAKG, and YGPM, respectively) in a positive concentration-activity relationship. Furthermore, PFGPD, PYGAKG, and YGPM could effectively reduce Fe to Fe and inhibit lipid peroxidation. Hence, eight collagen peptides from hydrolysate of Spanish mackerel skins might be served as antioxidant candidates for various industrial applications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30005070>Fetal Huanjiang mini-pigs exhibit differences in nutrient composition according to body weight and gestational period.</a></h1><p>Low birth weight may negatively affect  storage and nutrient metabolism, and impair fetal growth and development. We analyzed effects of body weight (BW) and gestational period on nutrient composition in fetal Huanjiang mini-pigs. Fetuses with the lowest BW (LBW), middle BW (MBW), and highest BW (HBW) were collected at days 45, 75, and 110 of gestation. Crude protein (CP), crude fat, amino acid (AA), and fatty acid (FA) concentrations were determined. The BW gain, carcass weight, fat percentage, and uterus weight of sows increased as gestation progressed, as did litter weight, average individual fetal weight, fetal body weight, and dry matter (DM). The concentrations of Ala, Arg, crude fat, Gly, Pro, , C14:0, C16:0, C16:1, C18:1n9c, C18:2n6c, C18:3n3, C18:3n6, C20:0, C20:3n6, saturated FA (SFA), and monounsaturated FA (MUFA) increased significantly as gestation progressed. The percentage of skeleton, and the ratio of the liver, lung, and stomach to BW decreased as gestation progressed. There were also significant reductions in the concentrations of CP, Asp, Glu, His, Ile, Leu, , Phe, Ser, , essential AA (EAA), acidic AA, C17:0, C20:4n6, C22:6n3, unsaturated FA (UFA), polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), n-3PUFA, n-6PUFA as gestation progressed, and reductions in EAA/total AA (TAA), PUFA/SFA, and n-3/n-6 PUFA. The LBW fetuses exhibited the lowest BW and crude fat, C14:0, C16:1, C17:0, C18:2n6c, and MUFA concentrations at days 75 and 110 of gestation. They also exhibited lower  concentration at day 45 of gestation and lower Glu concentration at day 75 of gestation than HBW fetuses. These findings suggest that LBW fetuses exhibit lower amounts of crude fat and several FAs during mid-gestation and late-gestation, which may in turn affect adaptability, growth, and development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27315826>Effect of extrusion processing of soybean meal on ileal amino acid digestibility and growth performance of broiler chicks.</a></h1><p>The present experiments were conducted to investigate the efficacy of extrusion of inadequately processed soybean meal (SBM) on amino acid (AA) digestibility and performance of broiler chicks. In Exp. 1, 180 day-old Ross broiler chicks were randomly distributed between 6 pen replicates (15 chicks each) of 2 dietary treatments; diets based on SBM or extruded SBM (ESBM) as the main protein sources. Based on the results of Exp. 1 and AA digestibility assay, Exp. 2 was designed using 216 day-old Ross broiler chicks (6 replicates of 18 chicks each), in which dietary SBM content was replaced by 86% using ESBM. This replacement caused about a 9% decrease in dietary crude protein (CP) level. Results showed that coefficients of CP and AA digestibility were greater (P < 0.05) for ESBM than those of SBM. Extrusion processing of SBM increased digestibility coefficients of , , Cys, Leu, Phe, , Pro, Ser, and Gly. Except during the starter period, dietary inclusion of ESBM increased (P < 0.05) average daily feed intake (ADFI) in Exp. 1 and caused increases (P < 0.01) in average daily weight gains (ADWG) throughout the trial period. Also, using ESBM improved the (P < 0.01) feed conversion ratio (FCR) during starter and finisher periods. In Exp. 2, reducing dietary CP level using ESBM decreased both ADFI (P < 0.05) and ADWG (P < 0.01) in the starter period. During grower, finisher, and entire trial periods, however, ADFI and ADWG were not influenced by dietary treatments. Dietary inclusion of ESBM improved (P < 0.05) FCR value in the finisher period. Although carcass yield was not affected by dietary treatments, reducing dietary CP level resulted in an increase (P < 0.05) in abdominal fat percentage. Moreover, a decrease in dietary CP level reduced (P = 0.08) breast yield. The present findings indicate that extrusion of SBM could improve its nutritive value for broiler chicks. Using ESBM, one can reduce dietary CP level by about 9% without any detrimental effect on performance parameters of broiler chicks.© 2016 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6938967>Isolation and amino acid sequence of gamma-lipotropin from human pituitary glands.</a></h1><p>gamma-Lipotropin has been purified to homogeneity from human pituitary glands. It consists of 56 amino acids with one residue each of Trp, , Val, , and Phe.

Two different palmitate binding modes (1 and 2), with similar protein-ligand interaction energies, have been identified using a variety of simulation strategies. These strategies include applying experimental protein-ligand atom-atom distance restraints during the simulation, or protonating the palmitate ligand, or using the vacuum GROMOS 54B7 force-field parameter set for the ligand during the initial stages of the simulations. In both the binding modes identified the palmitate carboxylate head group hydrogen bonds with main chain amide groups in helix A, residues 4 to 19, of the protein. In binding mode 1 the hydrogen bonds are to  11, Cys 13, and Leu 14 and in binding mode 2 to  15,  16, Val 17, Ser 24 and also to the OH of  15. In both cases palmitate binding exploits irregularity of the intrahelical hydrogen-bonding pattern in helix A of barley LTP due to the presence of Pro 12. Simulations of two variants of barley LTP, namely the single mutant Pro12Val and the double mutant Pro12Val Pro70Val, show that Pro 12 is required for persistent palmitate binding in the LTP cavity. Overall, the work identifies key MD simulation approaches for characterizing the details of protein-ligand interactions in complexes where NMR data provide insufficient restraints.Copyright © 2012 The Protein Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2877919>Characterization of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) islet somatostatins.</a></h1><p>Three different somatostatins have been isolated from the pancreatic islet tissue of the coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) by gel filtration and HPLC. Two of these peptides contain 14 amino acids and the larger third peptide consists of 25 amino acids. The sequence of the salmon SST-25 is Ser-Val-Asp-Asn-Leu-Pro-Pro-Arg-Glu-Arg--Ala-Gly -Cys--Asn-Phe--Trp--Gly-Phe--Ser-Cys. The sequence of the salmon SST-14-I is Ala-Gly-Cys--Asn-Phe-Phe-Trp---Phe--Ser-Cys. The other small somatostatin (SST-14-II) which was not sequenced has an amino acid composition identical to the C-terminal 14 amino acids of the SST-25 and it is probably derived from this larger form. Evidence for low levels of a somatostatin containing 28 amino acids is also presented. This SST-28 appears to be an N-terminal extended precursor of SST-25 or a peptide derived via alternative processing of a common preprosomatostatin. Injected into juvenile salmon, SST-25 caused a decline in circulating levels of plasma insulin, depletion of liver glycogen, and activation of lipolytic pathways. Juvenile salmon treated with anti-SST-25 serum revealed elevated levels of plasma insulin as well as an increase of the glycogen content of the liver.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30609694>Preparation, Identification, and Activity Evaluation of Eight Antioxidant Peptides from Protein Hydrolysate of Hairtail () Muscle.</a></h1><p>In this report, protein of hairtail () muscle was separately hydrolyzed using five kinds of proteases (alcalase, trypsin, neutrase, pepsin, and papain), and the papain- and alcalase-hydrolysates showed higher 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radicals (DPPH•) and hydroxyl radical (HO•) scavenging activity than other three protease hydrolysates. Therefore, the protein hydrolysate of hairtail muscle (HTP) was prepared using binary-enzymes hydrolysis process (papain + alcalase). Subsequently, eight antioxidant peptides were purified from HTP using membrane ultrafiltration and chromatography technology, and their amino acid sequences were identified as Gln-Asn-Asp-Glu-Arg (TJP1), -Ser (TJP2), -Ala (TJP3), Ala--Gly (TJP4), --Ala (TJP5), Val- (TJP6), Met- (TJP7), and Ile--Gly (TJP8) with molecular weights of 660.3, 233.0, 217.1, 274.1, 318.0, 245.1, 277.0, and 351.0 Da, respectively. TJP3, TJP4, and TJP8 exhibited strong scavenging activities on DPPH• (EC 0.902, 0.626, and 0.663 mg/mL, respectively), HO• (EC 1.740, 2.378, and 2.498 mg/mL, respectively), superoxide anion radical (EC 2.082, 2.538, and 1.355 mg/mL, respectively), and 2,2'-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) radical (EC 1.652, 0.831, and 0.586 mg/mL, respectively). Moreover, TJP3, TJP4, and TJP8 showed higher reducing power and inhibiting ability on lipid peroxidation in a linoleic acid model system. These results suggested that eight isolated peptides (TJP1 to TJP8), especially TJP3, TJP4, and TJP8 might serve as potential antioxidants applied in the pharmaceutical and health food industries.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22457392>Leucine is essential for attenuating fetal growth restriction caused by a protein-restricted diet in rats.</a></h1><p>Certain amino acids, such as leucine (Leu) are not only substrates for protein synthesis but also are important regulators of protein . Moreover, it is known that alterations in intrauterine growth favor the development of chronic diseases in adulthood. Therefore, we investigated the role of Leu in combination with other BCAA on effects that are induced by maternal protein restriction on fetal growth. Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups according to the diet provided during pregnancy: control (C; 20% casein); V+I [5% casein + 2% L-valine (Val) + 2% L-isoleucine (Ile)]; KYT [5% casein + 1.8% L-lysine () + 1.2% L-tyrosine () + 1% L-threonine ()]; and BCAA (5% casein + 1.8% L-Leu + 1.2% L-Val + 1% L-Ile). Maternal protein restriction reduced the growth and organ weight of the offspring of dams receiving the V+I and KYT diets compared with the C group. Supplementation with BCAA reversed this growth deficit, minimizing the difference or restoring the mass of organs and carcass , the liver and muscle protein, and the RNA concentrations compared with newborns in the C group (P < 0.05). These effects could be explained by the activation of the mTOR signaling pathway, because phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in the liver of offspring of the BCAA group was greater than that in the C, V+I, and KYT groups. The present results identify a critical role for Leu in association with other BCAA in the activation of the mTOR signaling pathway for the control of altered intrauterine growth induced by a maternal low-protein diet.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16569279>Effects of graded levels of duodenal infusions of leucine on mammary uptake and output in lactating dairy cows.</a></h1><p>Four multiparous Holstein cows, each equipped with a duodenal cannula and an ultrasonic mammary blood flow probe, were assigned to a 4x4 Latin square to measure the effects of duodenal infusions of Leu (0, 40, 80 and 120 g/d) on lactational responses and mammary  of nutrients. Cows were fed a diet of 67.0% corn silage, 5.3% grass hay, 14.2% peas, 7.8% maize starch, 1.0% each of molasses, urea, and sodium bicarbonate and 2.4% minerals and vitamins. Requirements of the remaining 9 essential amino acids were met by infusing into the duodenum 323 g/d of a mixture of amino acids including, Ile, Val, Met, , Trp, Phe, His, , Arg,  and Glu. Milk protein content and yield were highest with 40 g/d of Leu and then progressively declined. Milk  content and yield were significantly decreased over the entire range of Leu infusions. Arterial concentrations of Leu increased linearly and corresponding mammary arterio-venous differences increased to a plateau with 80 g/d of Leu. As Leu infusions increased, extraction rates of Leu decreased linearly, whereas those of Ile, Val, , Arg,  and  were significantly increased. Leu was taken up by the mammary gland according to milk output with 0 and 40 g/d of Leu infused and then largely in excess. Based on responses of protein yield and mammary uptake to milk output ratio, Leu concentration in total amino acids absorbed in the small intestine needs to be close to 8.9% for optimal milk protein synthesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15889653>Ileal and total tract nutrient digestibility in blue foxes (Alopex lagopus) fed extruded diets containing different protein sources.</a></h1><p>This study compared apparent ileal and total tract digestibility of macronutrients and amino acids in blue foxes (Alopex lagopus) fed dry extruded diets. The control diet contained fish meal as the main protein source, while in the other diets 50% of the fish meal protein was replaced by not de-hulled solvent-extracted soybean meal, meat meal or bacterial protein meal. Ileal digestibility was obtained with animals modified with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA method). There were no significant differences in the average digestibility of CP, , Trp, Val, Ala or Glu between IRA modified and intact animals. Average ileal digestibilities of His, , Asp, Cys, Gly, Hyp, Pro, Ser, starch and total carbohydrates (CHO) were significantly lower compared with total tract values. Average ileal digestibility of Arg, Ile, Leu, Met, Phe,  and crude  was significantly higher than total tract digestibility. Digestibility measured in IRA modified animals showed less variability compared with values from intact animals. There were significant differences among diets in ileal as well as total tract digestibility of orude protein, most amino acids, starch and CHO, and in ileal digestibility of crude . Ileal crude protein digestibility of the diets ranged from 81.0-86.4% and total tract digestibility from 82.5-86.4%. Ileal amino acid digestibilities ranged from 70.1 (Asp) to 93.3% (Arg) and total tract values ranged from 72.8 (Cys) to 92.2% (Arg). Both ileal and total tract digestibilities of crude protein and most amino acids were significantly lower for diets containing meat meal or bacterial protein meal compared with the control fish meal-based diet and the diet with soybean meal. Although ileal digestibility may be more accurate than total tract digestibility in estimating the protein and amino acid supply in blue foxes, total tract digestibility may be acceptable because of numerically small differences between ileal and total tract digestibilities for protein and most amino acids. It was further concluded that ileal digestibilities of starch and CHO in the blue fox are lower than corresponding total tract digestibilities.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8731009>The oxidative inactivation of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase by peroxynitrite.</a></h1><p>The oxidative inactivation of rabbit skeletal muscle Ca(2+)-ATPase in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles by peroxynitrite (ONOO-) was investigated. The exposure of SR vesicles (10 mg/ml protein) to low peroxynitrite concentrations ( < or = 0.2 mM) resulted in a decrease of Ca(2+)-ATPase activity primarily through oxidation of sulfhydryl groups. Most of this deactivation (ca.70%) could be chemically reversed by subsequent reduction of the enzyme with either dithiothreitol (DTT) or sodium borohydride (NaBH4), indicating that free cysteine groups were oxidized to disulfides. The initial presence of 5 mM glutathione failed to protect the SR Ca(2+)-ATPase activity. However, as long as peroxynitrite concentrations were kept < or = 0.45 mM, the efficacy of DTT to reverse Ca(2+)-ATPase inactivation was enhanced for reaction mixtures which initially contained 5 mM glutathione. At least part of the disulfides were formed intermolecularly since gel electrophoresis revealed protein aggregation which could be reduced under reducing conditions. The application of higher peroxynitrite concentrations ( > or = 0.45 mM) resulted in Ca(2+)-ATPase inactivation which could not be restored by exposure of the modified protein to reducing agents. On the other hand, treatment of modified protein with NaBH4 recovered all SR protein thiols. This result indicates that possibly the oxidation of other amino acids contributes to enzyme inactivation, corroborated by amino acid analysis which revealed some additional targets for peroxynitrite or peroxynitrite-induced processes such as Met, , Phe, , Ser, Leu and .  oxidation was confirmed by a significant lower sensitivity of oxidized SR proteins to the Lowry assay. However, neither bityrosine nor nitrotyrosine were formed in significant yields, as monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy and immunodetection, respectively. The Ca(2+)-ATPase of SR is involved in cellular Ca(2+)-homeostasis. Thus, peroxynitrite mediated oxidation of the Ca(2+)-ATPase might significantly contribute to the loss of Ca(2+)-homeostasis observed under biological conditions of oxidative stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7430115>Amino acid sequence of the signal peptide of apoVLDL-II, a major apoprotein in avian very low density lipoproteins.</a></h1><p>ApoVLDL-II is a major apoprotein in avian very low density lipoproteins (Jackson, R. L., Lin, H.-Y., Chan, L., and Means, A.R. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 250-253). Partially purified apoVLDL-II mRNA was translated in vitro in a wheat germ system in the presence of various labeled amino acids. The product, designated preapoVLDL-II, was purified by immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate acrylamide gel electrophoresis. It was subjected to automated Edman degradation in a Beckman Sequencer. The signal peptide was found to be a 23-amino acid NH2-terminal extension of the mature protein with the following sequence: Met-Gln--Arg-Ala-Leu-Val-Ile-Ala-Val-Ile-Leu-Leu-Leu-Ser--Val-Pro-Glu-Val-Cys-Ser- where  is the NH2-terminal residue of mature apoVLDL-II. The abundance and distribution of the hydrophobic amino acid residues are very similar to those of other signal sequences and the average hydrophobicity for the 23 residues is -1227 cal/mol/residue. However, translocation of preapoVLDL-II would represent a unique case of vectorial migration of a protein through a membrane since apoVLDL-II is itself an apolipoprotein and binds  spontaneously.</p></html>
