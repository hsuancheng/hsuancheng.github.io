Pretreatment with ionic liquids reduces lignocellulose recalcitrance to enzymatic hydrolysis, increasing yields of sugars for conversion into biofuels. However, commercial cellulases are not compatible with many ionic liquids, necessitating extensive water washing of pretreated biomass prior to hydrolysis. To circumvent this issue, previous research has demonstrated that several thermophilic bacterial cellulases can efficiently deconstruct lignocellulose in the presence of the ionic liquid, 1-ethyl-3-methylimadizolium . As promising as these enzymes are, they would need to be produced at high titer in an industrial enzyme production host before they could be considered a viable alternative to current commercial cellulases. Aspergillus niger has been used to produce high titers of secreted enzymes in industry and therefore, we assessed the potential of this organism to be used as an expression host for these ionic liquid-tolerant cellulases. We demonstrated that 29 of these cellulases were expressed at detectable levels in a wild-type strain of A. niger, indicating a basic level of compatibility and potential to be produced at high levels in a host engineered to produce high titers of enzymes. We then profiled one of these enzymes in detail, the β-glucosidase A5IL97, and compared versions expressed in both A. niger and Escherichia coli. This comparison revealed the enzymatic activity of A5IL97 purified from E. coli and A. niger is equivalent, suggesting that A. niger could be an excellent enzyme production host for enzymes originally characterized in E. coli, facilitating the transition from the laboratory to industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29211928>Effect of tannic acid on skin  .</a></h2><p>In this study, we investigated how tannic acid (TA) protects the skin from inflammation caused by external irritation. The effects of TA were evaluated using a mouse 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13- (TPA)-induced skin inflammation model and a reconstructed human epidermal model. We then used Lucifer Yellow for visual confirmation of TA's suppression effect at the stratum corneum (SC) surface. TA treatment of the skin prevented Lucifer Yellow from permeating the skin.

The parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) is a high throughput screening tool applied to evaluate the passive permeability and adapted to predict BBB penetration. Herein, a new PAMPA model was developed using an in-house brain lipid extract capable of discriminating BBB permeable from non-permeable compounds. The apparent permeability (Papp) of 18 reference molecules and 10 test compounds was assessed and compared with phosphatidylcholine and commercial porcine polar brain lipid (PBL). The physicochemical selectivity of the in-house brain lipid extract was demonstrated by correlating Papp values with physicochemical properties and its predictive capacity estimated by establishing in vitro-in vivo correlations. The strong correlations achieved between 2% (w/v) in-house lipid extract and PBL for reference (r(2)=0.77) and test compounds (r(2)=0.94) support an equivalent discriminatory capacity and validate the presented model. Moreover, PAMPA studies performed with PBL and in-house lipid extract exhibited a higher correlation with the in vivo parameter logBB (r(2)=0.76 and r(2)=0.72, respectively) than phosphatidylcholine (r(2)=0.51). Overall, the applied lipid extraction process was reproducible, economical and provided lipid extracts that can be used to reliably assess BBB permeation.Copyright © 2016.

Liver failure has been reported to alter expression and activity of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp2) at the blood-brain  (BBB). The aim of this study was to investigate whether ammonia is involved in abnormalities of expression and activity of P-gp and Mrp2 at the BBB. Hyperammonemic rats were developed by an intraperitoneal injection of ammonium  (NH4 Ac, 4.5 mmol/kg). Results showed that Mrp2  markedly increased in cortex and hippocampus of rats at 6 h following NH4 Ac administration. Significant increase in  of P-gp was observed in hippocampus of rats. Meanwhile, such alterations were in line with the increase in mRNA and protein levels of P-gp and Mrp2. Significant increase in levels of nuclear amount of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 was also observed. Primarily cultured rat brain microvessel endothelial cells (rBMECs) were used for in vitro study. Data indicated that 24 h exposure to ammonia significantly increased  and expression of P-gp and Mrp2 in rBMECs, accompanied with activation of NF-κB. Furthermore, such alterations induced by ammonia were reversed by NF-κB inhibitor. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that hyperammonemia increases the  and expression of P-gp and Mrp2 at the BBB via activating NF-κB pathway. Hyperammonemia, a proverbial main factor responsible for neurocognitive disorder and blood-brain  (BBB) dysfunction resulting from liver failure, could increase the expression and activity of P-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp2) at the BBB both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, the NF-κB activation stimulated by hyperammonemia may be the potential mechanism underlying such abnormalities induced by hyperammonemia.© 2014 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26341347>Epicuticular wax on cherry laurel (Prunus laurocerasus) leaves does not constitute the cuticular transpiration .</a></h2><p>Epicuticular wax of cherry laurel does not contribute to the formation of the cuticular transpiration , which must be established by intracuticular wax.  properties of cuticles are established by cuticular wax deposited on the outer surface of the cuticle (epicuticular wax) and in the cutin polymer (intracuticular wax). It is still an open question to what extent epi- and/or intracuticular waxes contribute to the formation of the transpiration . Epicuticular wax was mechanically removed from the surfaces of isolated cuticles and intact leaf disks of cherry laurel (Prunus laurocerasus L.) by stripping with different polymers (collodion, cellulose  and gum arabic). Scanning electron microscopy showed that two consecutive treatments with all three polymers were sufficient to completely remove epicuticular wax since wax platelets disappeared and cuticle surfaces appeared smooth. Waxes in consecutive polymer strips and wax remaining in the cuticle after treatment with the polymers were determined by gas chromatography. This confirmed that two treatments of the polymers were sufficient for selectively removing epicuticular wax. Water permeability of isolated cuticles and cuticles covering intact leaf disks was measured using (3)H-labelled water before and after selectively removing epicuticular wax. Cellulose  and its solvent acetone led to a significant increase of cuticular permeability, indicating that the organic solvent acetone affected the cuticular transpiration . However, permeability did not change after two subsequent treatments with collodion and gum arabic or after treatment with the corresponding solvents (diethyl ether:ethanol or water). Thus, in the case of P. laurocerasus the epicuticular wax does not significantly contribute to the formation of the cuticular transpiration , which evidently must be established by the intracuticular wax.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28852737>PROTECTIVE EFFECTS OF ETHYL  EXTRACTION FROM GASTRODIA ELATA BLUME ON BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER IN FOCAL CEREBRAL ISCHEMIA REPERFUSION.</a></h2><p>Damage of the blood brain barrier (BBB) during the process of cerebral ischemic injury is a key factor which influences the therapeutic efficacy to the cerebral ischemic injury. The present study was designed to verify the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of the ethyl  (EtOAc) extraction from Gastrodia elata Blume (GEB) on the BBB by developing a model of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in rats.MCAO/R model in rats was developed through a thread embolism method. The neurological scales, the moisture and the evans blue (EB) contents of brains were detected. Meanwhile, the release of nitric oxide (NO) and activities of NO synthase (NOS) in brain tissues were measured. Western blotting analyses were also performed to assess the protein expressions of AQP-4, Occludin and Claudin-5 in brain tissue.After rats were pretreated with different concentrations of EtOAc extractions from GEB, the neurologic scores, the EB contents in the brain tissues and the moisture of the brains were significantly decreased. Meanwhile, the release of NO, the activities of nNOS and iNOS were notably inhibited. Furthemore, the protein expression of AQP-4 was markedly decreased, but the protein expressions of -5 and Occludin were significantly increased.the EtOAc extracts of GEB may decrease the permeability of BBB when focal cerebral ischemia occurs. The inhibition of the NOS pathways, the attenuation of the protein expression of AQP-4 and the enhancement of the expressions of the tight junction proteins may contribute to the protective effects of the EtOAc extracts from GEB on BBB.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26268064>Enhancing Effect of Trachelogenin from Trachelospermi caulis Extract on Intestinal  .</a></h2><p>Trachelospermi caulis is used widely as an herbal medicine in oriental countries to attenuate fever and pain. We wished to reveal the novel  of this herb and its active component on   in intestinal epithelial cells. Monolayers of intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-2) were used to evaluate the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and quantity of permeated ovalbumin (OVA) as indices of  . T. caulis increased TEER values on cell monolayers and decreased OVA permeation across cell monolayers. To ascertain the active component of T. caulis, the extract was isolated to five fractions, and the effect of each of these fractions on intestinal   examined. Chloroform and ethyl  fractions showed increased TEER values and decreased OVA flux. Chloroform and ethyl  fractions contained mainly trachelogenin and its glycoside, tracheloside. Trachelogenin increased TEER values and decreased OVA flux by enhancing the tight-junction protein occludin (but not tracheloside) in Caco-2 monolayers. These findings demonstrated that trachelogenin, an active component of T. caulis, might help to attenuate food allergy or inflammatory bowel disease through inhibition of allergen permeation or enhancement of the intestinal .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24199489>Role of Se+Zn in regeneration (Ki-67) following Pb toxicity (p53andcad) in the germinal epithelium of adult Wistar rats.</a></h2><p>The germinal epithelium is the delicate epithelial lining of the seminiferous tubule lying on the blood-testes ; formed by the sustenacular cells of Sertoli and the adjoining basement epithelium this study addresses the effect of lead (Pb) toxicity on the epithelium and the proliferative effect of Zinc (Zn) and Selenium (Se) administered in trace concentration. Sixty F1 generation adult male Wistar rats were divided into four groups of 15 animals each. Group 1 received normal saline, group 2: 100 mg kg(-1) of lead , group 3: 100 mg kg(-1) of lead  then 2.25 mg kg(-1) each of Zinc (Chelated zinc) and Selenium (Sodium Selenium) and group 4: 2.25 mg kg(-1) of zinc and selenium (Se+Zn). The duration of treatment was 56 days following which the animals were sacrificed on the 57th day and the testes harvested and fixed in Bouin's fluid. Pb induced toxicity can follow a mitochondria pathway involving Cathepsin D (CAD) or a cytoplasmic pathway involving p53 (protein 53; a 53 KDa nucleolase), the most predominant form of cell death is apoptosis which can result from both pathways. Se+Zn treatment improves proliferation and counters Pb toxicity by substitution, activation of enzymes (radical scavengers and vitamins), growth factors, activation of endothelial factors and activation of oxygen radical scavengers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25354024>Short communication: a repeated simian human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase/herpes simplex virus type 2 cochallenge macaque model for the evaluation of microbicides.</a></h2><p>Epidemiological studies suggest that prevalent herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection increases the risk of HIV acquisition, underscoring the need to develop coinfection models to evaluate promising prevention strategies. We previously established a single high-dose vaginal coinfection model of simian human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)/HSV-2 in Depo-Provera (DP)-treated macaques. However, this model does not appropriately mimic women's exposure. Repeated limiting dose SHIV challenge models are now used routinely to test prevention strategies, yet, at present, there are no reports of a repeated limiting dose cochallenge model in which to evaluate products targeting HIV and HSV-2. Herein, we show that 20 weekly cochallenges with 2-50 TCID50 simian human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase (SHIV-RT) and 10(7) pfu HSV-2 results in infection with both viruses (4/6 SHIV-RT, 6/6 HSV-2). The frequency and level of vaginal HSV-2 shedding were significantly greater in the repeated exposure model compared to the single high-dose model (p<0.0001). We used this new model to test the Council's on-demand microbicide gel, MZC, which is active against SHIV-RT in DP-treated macaques and HSV-2 and human papillomavirus (HPV) in mice. While MZC reduced SHIV and HSV-2 infections in our repeated limiting dose model when cochallenging 8 h after each gel application, a  effect of carrageenan (CG) that was not seen in DP-treated animals precluded evaluation of the significance of the antiviral activity of MZC. Both MZC and CG significantly (p<0.0001) reduced the frequency and level of vaginal HSV-2 shedding compared to no gel treatment. This validates the use of this repeated limiting dose cochallenge model for testing products targeting HIV and HSV-2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25487741>Characterization of anode and anolyte community growth and the impact of impedance in a microbial fuel cell.</a></h2><p>A laboratory-scale two-chamber microbial fuel cell employing an aerated cathode with no catalyst was inoculated with mixed inoculum and  as the carbon source. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to study the behavior of the MFC during initial biofilm (week 1) and maximum power density (week 20). EIS were performed on the anode chamber, biofilm (without anolyte) and anolyte (without biofilm). Nyquist plots of the EIS data were fitted with two equivalent electrical circuits to estimate the contributions of intrinsic resistances to the overall internal MFC impedance at weeks 1 and 20, respectively.The results showed that the system tended to increase power density from 15 ± 3 (week 1) to 100 ± 15 mW/m(2) (week 20) and current density 211 ± 7 (week 1) to 347 ± 29 mA/m(2) (week 20). The Samples were identified by pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and showed that initial inoculum (week 1) was constituted by Proteobacteria (40%), Bacteroidetes (22%) and Firmicutes (18%). At week 20, Proteobacterial species were predominant (60%) for electricity generation in the anode biofilm, being 51% Rhodopseudomonas palustris. Meanwhile on anolyte, Firmicutes phylum was predominant with Bacillus sp. This study proved that under the experimental conditions used there is an important contribution from the interaction of the biofilm and the anolyte on cell performance. Table 1 presents a summary of the specific influence of each element of the system under study.The results showed certain members of the bacterial electrode community increased in relative abundance from the initial inoculum. For example, Proteobacterial species are important for electricity generation in the anode biofilms and Firmicutes phylum was predominant on anolyte to transfer electron. R1 is the same in the three systems and no variation is observed over time. The biofilm makes a significant contribution to the charge transfer processes at the electrode (R2 and Cdl) and, consequently, on the performance of the anode chamber. The biofilm can act as a  which reduces diffusion of the anolyte towards the electrode, all the while behaving like a porous material. The anolyte and its interaction with the biofilm exert a considerable influence on diffusion processes, given that it presents the highest values for Rd which increased at week 20.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312663>Severe burn injury alters intestinal microbiota composition and impairs intestinal  in mice.</a></h2><p>The intestinal  integrity is crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis, and the mechanisms of intestinal  disruption induced by burn injury remain obscure. This study was aimed to investigate the changes of intestinal microbiota and   in burned mice to further comprehend the mechanisms of burn-induced intestinal  dysfunction.Samples were from mice inflicted with 30% total body surface area (TBSA) full-thickness burns. The intestinal permeability, tight junction proteins expressions, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) localization, inflammatory cytokines expressions, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) contents were determined. The microbial community was assessed via 16S rDNA Illumina sequencing.The intestinal permeability was increased after severe burn injury, peaking at 6 h post-burn, with approximately 20-folds of the control ( < 0.001). The expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, occludin, claudin-1, and claudin-2) was significantly altered ( < 0.05). The ZO-1 morphology was dramatically changed following burn injury. The fecal SCFAs' contents (, propionate, butyrate, isobutyrate, and isovalerate) were noticeably declined after burn injury ( < 0.05). The expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6) in ileal mucosa were increased, whereas the expressions of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13) were decreased following burn injury ( < 0.05).

Dietary fiber, which is a negative risk factor of colon cancer, improves characteristics of the colonic environment, such as the content of organic acids and microflora. We hypothesized that dietary PA would improve the colonic luminal environment in rats fed a high-fat diet. To test this hypothesis, rats were fed diets containing 30% beef tallow with 2.04% sodium PA, 0.4% MI, or 1.02% sodium PA + 0.2% MI for 3 weeks. Compared with the control diet, the sodium PA diet up-regulated cecal organic acids, including , propionate, and n-butyrate; this effect was especially prominent for cecal butyrate. The sodium PA + MI diet also significantly increased cecal butyrate, although this effect was less pronounced when compared with the sodium PA diet. The cecal ratio of Lactobacillales, cecal and fecal mucins (an index of intestinal  ), and fecal β-glucosidase activity were higher in rats fed the sodium PA diet than in those fed the control diet. The sodium PA, MI, and sodium PA + MI diets decreased levels of serum tumor necrosis factor α, which is a proinflammatory cytokine. Another proinflammatory cytokine, serum interleukin-6, was also down-regulated by the sodium PA and sodium PA + MI diets. These data showed that PA may improve the composition of cecal organic acids, microflora, and mucins, and it may decrease the levels of serum proinflammatory cytokines in rats fed a high-fat, mineral-sufficient diet.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We hypothesized that β2→1-fructan dietary fibers confer protection on intestinal epithelial cell   via Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), and we studied whether β2→1-fructan chain-length differences affect this process. T84 human intestinal epithelial cell monolayers were incubated with 4 β2→1-fructan formulations of different chain-length compositions and were stimulated with the proinflammatory phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA). Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was analyzed by electric cell substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) as a measure for tight junction-mediated  . To confirm TLR2 involvement in  modulation by β2→1-fructans, ECIS experiments were repeated using TLR2 blocking antibody. After preincubation of T84 cells with short-chain β2→1-fructans, the decrease in TEER as induced by PMA (62.3 ± 5.2%, P < 0.001) was strongly attenuated (15.2 ± 8.8%, P < 0.01). However, when PMA was applied first, no effect on recovery was observed during addition of the fructans. By blocking TLR2 on the T84 cells, the protective effect of short-chain β2→1-fructans was substantially inhibited. Stimulation of human embryonic kidney human TLR2 reporter cells with β2→1-fructans induced activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, confirming that β2→1-fructans are specific ligands for TLR2. To conclude, β2→1-fructans exert time-dependent and chain length-dependent protective effects on the T84 intestinal epithelial cell  mediated via TLR2. These results suggest that TLR2 located on intestinal epithelial cells could be a target of β2→1-fructan-mediated health effects.© 2014 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24485135>Multiple sclerosis: current and emerging disease-modifying therapies and treatment strategies.</a></h2><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating central nervous system disease that typically strikes young adults, especially women. The pathobiology of MS includes inflammatory and neurodegenerative mechanisms that affect both white and gray matter. These mechanisms underlie the relapsing, and often eventually progressive, course of MS, which is heterogeneous; confident prediction of long-term individual prognosis is not yet possible. However, because revised MS diagnostic criteria that incorporate neuroimaging data facilitate early diagnosis, most patients are faced with making important long-term treatment decisions, most notably the use and selection of disease-modifying therapy (DMT). Currently, there are 10 approved MS DMTs with varying degrees of efficacy for reducing relapse risk and preserving neurological , but their long-term benefits remain unclear. Moreover, available DMTs differ with respect to the route and frequency of administration, tolerability and likelihood of treatment adherence, common adverse effects, risk of major toxicity, and pregnancy-related risks. Thorough understanding of the benefit-risk profiles of these therapies is necessary to establish logical and safe treatment plans for individuals with MS. We review the available evidence supporting risk-benefit profiles for available and emerging DMTs. We also assess the place of individual DMTs within the context of several different MS management strategies, including those currently in use (sequential monotherapy, escalation therapy, and induction and maintenance therapy) and others that may soon become feasible (combination approaches and "personalized medicine").

DMPA is highly effective and is among the most commonly used form of hormonal contraception in areas of high HIV prevalence. Thus, defining the biological mechanisms that contribute to the potential negative synergy between DMPA and HIV is key and may facilitate the identification of alternative contraceptive strategies. Proposed mechanisms include thinning or disruption of the cervicovaginal epithelial , induction of mucosal inflammation, interference with innate and adaptive soluble and cellular immune responses, and/or alterations in the vaginal microbiome. DMPA may also indirectly increase the risk of HIV by promoting genital herpes or other sexually transmitted infections. However, there is a paucity of rigorous in vitro, animal model and clinical data to support these potential mechanisms highlighting the need for future research.© 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

This internal ecosystem, far from being a static environment, can be manipulated by diet and dietary components. Feeding animals with high-fat sucrose (HFS) diets entails diet-induced obesity, a model which is usually used in research to mimic the obese phenotype of Western societies. The aim of the present study was to identify gut microbiota dysbiosis and associated metabolic changes produced in male Wistar rats fed a HFS diet for 6 weeks and compare it with the basal microbial composition. For this purpose, DNA extracted from faeces at baseline and after treatment was analysed by amplification of the V4-V6 region of the 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene using 454 pyrosequencing. Short-chain fatty acids, i.e. , propionate and butyrate, were also evaluated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. At the end of the treatment, gut microbiota composition significantly differed at phylum level (Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria) and class level (Erisypelotrichi, Deltaproteobacteria, Bacteroidia and Bacilli). Interestingly, the class Clostridia showed a significant decrease after HFS diet treatment, which correlated with visceral adipose tissue, and is likely mediated by dietary carbohydrates. Of particular interest, Clostridium cluster XIVa species were significantly reduced and changes were identified in the relative abundance of other specific bacterial species (Mitsuokella jalaludinii, Eubacterium ventriosum, Clostridium sp. FCB90-3, Prevotella nanceiensis, Clostridium fusiformis, Clostridium sp. BNL1100 and Eubacterium cylindroides) that, in some cases, showed opposite trends to their relative families. These results highlight the relevance of characterising gut microbial population differences at species level and contribute to understand the plausible link between diet and specific gut bacterial species that are able to influence the inflammatory status, intestinal   and obesity development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25798593>Molecular mechanisms linking high dose medroxyprogesterone with HIV-1 risk.</a></h2><p>Epidemiological studies suggest that medroxyprogesterone  (MPA) may increase the risk of HIV-1. The current studies were designed to identify potential underlying biological mechanisms.Human vaginal epithelial (VK2/E6E7), peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC), and polarized endometrial (HEC-1-A) cells were treated with a range of concentrations of MPA (0.015-150 μg/ml) and the impact on gene expression, protein secretion, and HIV infection was evaluated.Treatment of VK2/E6E7 cells with high doses (>15 μg/ml] of MPA significantly upregulated proinflammatory cytokines, which resulted in a significant increase in HIV p24 levels secreted by latently infected U1 cells following exposure to culture supernatants harvested from MPA compared to mock-treated cells. MPA also increased syndecan expression by VK2/E6E7 cells and cells treated with 15 μg/ml of MPA bound and transferred more HIV-1 to T cells compared to mock-treated cells. Moreover, MPA treatment of epithelial cells and PBMC significantly decreased cell proliferation resulting in disruption of the epithelial  and decreased cytokine responses to phytohaemagglutinin, respectively.We identified several molecular mechanisms that could contribute to an association between DMPA and HIV including proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses that could activate the HIV promoter and recruit immune targets, increased expression of syndecans to facilitate the transfer of virus from epithelial to immune cells and decreased cell proliferation. The latter could impede the ability to maintain an effective epithelial  and adversely impact immune cell . However, these responses were observed primarily following exposure to high (15-150 μg/ml) MPA concentrations. Clinical correlation is needed to determine whether the prolonged MPA exposure associated with contraception activates these mechanisms in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29424049>Astrocyte disruption of neurovascular communication is linked to cortical damage in an animal model of multiple sclerosis.</a></h2><p>To elucidate mechanisms contributing to cortical pathology in multiple sclerosis (MS), we investigated neurovascular aberrations, in particular the association of astrocytes with cortical neurons and blood vessels, in mice induced with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Blood-brain  (BBB) dysfunction was evident by leakage of the tracer sodium fluorescein, along with reduced expression of claudin-5 by endothelial cells and desmin by pericytes. Immunohistological and ultrastructural analyses revealed detachment of the astroglial cell bodies from the blood vessels and loss of their connections with both the blood vessels and the neuronal synapses. Furthermore, examination of individual astrocytic processes at cortical layer IV, where well-defined neuronal columns (barrels) are linked to functional properties, revealed loss of astrocytic confinement to the functional neuronal boundaries. Thus, in contrast to the highly modulated patches of astrocyte processes in naïve mice overlapping the barrel cores, in EAE-mice process distribution was uniform ignoring the barrel boundaries. These aberrations are attributed to the surrounding inflammation, indicated by T-cells presence in the cortex as well as in the subcortical white matter and the meninges. Immunomodulatory treatment with glatiramer  partially abrogated the neurovascular damage. These combined findings indicate that under inflammatory conditions, activated perivascular astrocytes fail in neuro-hemodynamic coupling, resulting in obstructed cross-talk between the blood vessels and the neurons. We propose that loss of cortical astrocytic regulation and fine-tuning between the blood supply and the neuronal needs contributes to the neurological impairment and cognitive decline occurring in EAE/MS as well as to the disease progression.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796695>Synthesis and evaluation of fluorine-substituted phenyl  derivatives as ultra-short recovery sedative/hypnotic agents.</a></h2><p>Soft drugs are molecules that are purposefully designed to be rapidly metabolized (metabolically labile). In anesthesia, the soft drug is useful because it enables precise titration to effect and rapid recovery, which might allow swift and clear-headed recovery of consciousness and early home readiness. Propofol may cause delayed awakening after prolonged infusion. Propanidid and AZD3043 have a different metabolic pathway compared to propofol, resulting in a short-acting clinical profile. Fluorine imparts a variety of properties to certain medicines, including an enhanced absorption rate and improved drug transport across the blood-brain . We hypothesized that the introduction of fluorine to the frame structure of propanidid and AZD3043 would further accelerate the swift and clear-headed recovery of consciousness. To test this hypothesis, we developed a series of fluorine-containing phenyl  derivatives.Fluorine-containing phenyl  derivatives were synthesized, and their hypnotic potencies and durations of LORR following bolus or infusion administration were determined in mice, rats and rabbits. The metabolic half-lives in the blood of various species were determined chromatographically. In vitro radioligand binding and γ-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor electrophysiology studies were performed. Among the 12 synthesized fluorine-containing phenyl  derivatives, compound 5j induced comparable duration of LORR with AZD3043, but more rapid recovery than AZD3043, propanidid and propofol. The time of compound 5j to return to walk and behavioral recovery are approximately reduced by more than 50% compared to AZD3043 in mice and rats and rabbits.

Thus, the effect of raw potato starch (RPS), a widely adopted RS material, on microbial composition and   of cecum for meat ducks was determined. Cherry Valley male ducks, 360,1-day-old, were randomly divided and fed diets with 0% (control), 12%, or 24% RPS for 35 d. Diets Supplemented with RPS significantly elevated villus height and villus height: crypt depth ratio in the cecum. The 16S rRNA sequence analysis indicated that the diet with 12% RPS had a higher relative abundance of Firmicutes and the butyrate-producing bacteria Faecalibacterium, Subdoligranulum, and Erysipelatoclostridium were enriched among all diets. Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium were significantly increased in the 24% RPS diet vs. the control diet. When compared with the control diet, the diet with 12% RPS also was found to notably increase , propionate and butyrate contents, and up-regulated -related genes including Claudin-1, Zonula occludens (ZO)-1, mucin-2, and proglucagon of cecum. Furthermore, addition of 12% RPS significantly reduced plasma tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and endotoxin concentrations. These data revealed that diets supplemented with 12% RPS partially improved cecal   in meat ducks by enhancing intestinal morphology and  markers expression, modulating the microbiota composition, and attenuating inflammatory markers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26297475>High levels of fish oil enhance neutrophil development and activation and influence colon mucus   in a genetically susceptible mouse model.</a></h2><p>Dietary fatty acids influence immunologic homeostasis, but their effect on initiation of colitis, an immune-mediated disease, is not well established. Previously, our laboratory demonstrated that high doses of dietary fish oil (FO) increased colon inflammation and dysplasia in a model of infection-induced colitis. In the current study, we assessed the effects of high-dose dietary FO, 6% by weight, on colon inflammation, neutrophil recruitment and , and mucus layer integrity in a genetically susceptible, colitis-prone mouse model in the absence of infection. FO-fed SMAD3(-/-) mice had increased colon inflammation evidenced by increased numbers of systemic and local neutrophils and increased neutrophil chemoattractant and inflammatory cytokine gene expression in the colon. Mucus layer thickness in the cecum and goblet cell numbers in the cecum and colon in FO-fed mice were reduced compared to control. FO consumption affected colitis in male and female mice differently. Compared to female control mice, neutrophils from FO-fed female mice had reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon ex vivo stimulation with phorbol myristate  while FO-fed male mice produced increased ROS compared to control-fed male mice. In summary, dietary FO impaired mucus layer integrity and was associated with colon inflammation characterized by increased neutrophil numbers and altered neutrophil . High-dose FO may have detrimental effects in populations genetically susceptible for inflammatory bowel disease and these effects may differ between males and females.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Measurement is complicated by the formation of low m/z degradation products and the formation of adducts with various cations, which make accurate quantitation difficult. Adduct formation caused the sample matrix or mobile phase to partition bryostatin 1 into products of different mass. Degradation of the 927 [M+Na](+) ion to a 869m/z product was strongly influenced by ionization conditions. We validated a bryostatin 1 assay in biological tissues using capillary column HPLC with nanospray ionization (NSI) in a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer in selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode. Adduct formation was controlled by adding 1mM acetic acid and 0.1mM sodium  to the HPLC buffer, maximizing the formation of the [M+Na](+) ion. Efficient removal of contaminating cholesterol from the sample during solvent extraction was also critical. The increased sensitivity provided by NSI and capillary-bore columns and the elimination of signal partitioning due to adduct formation and degradation in the ionization source enabled a detection limit of 1×10(-18)mol of bryostatin 1 and a LLOQ of 3×10(-18)mol from 1μl of sample. Bryostatin 1 at low pmol/l concentrations enabled measurement in brain and other tissues without the use of radioactive labels. Despite bryostatin 1's high molecular weight, considerable brain access was observed, with peak brain concentrations exceeding 8% of the peak blood plasma concentrations. Bryostatin 1 readily crosses the blood-brain , reaching peak concentrations of 0.2nM, and specifically activates and translocates brain PKCɛ.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The diabetic, acidotic coma as an acute deficiency of acetyl-CoA and ATP].</a></h2><p>The mechanisms of beta-oxidation of fatty acids developed more than a century before have no compliance with actual physical chemical data. The oxidation of long-chain C 16:0 palmitic saturated fatty acid occurs not by sequential formation of eight molecules of acetyl-KoA but by force of formation of double bond and its hydrolysis on two short-chain C 8:0 fatty acids. Only short-chain fatty acids can become shorter under "chipping" of C 2- with formation of C 4-butyric acid (butyrate) and its metabolites (beta-hidroxibutirate, acetoacetate, acetone). The critical moment of oxidation is a hydrolysis of acetoacetyl-KoA on two molecules of acetyl-KoA. The molecule of ATP is to be expended on hydrolysis. The foundation of nonspecific biological reaction of stress--ketoacidosis,--is a decrease in mitochondrions of acetyl-KoA pool formed both from glycogen and glucose and fatty acids. The oxalate  inputs into Krebs cycle inadequate amount of acetyl-KoA which limits synthesis of ATP. The insulin has no direct involvement into development of ketoacidosis but prepares conditions to facilitate nonspecific etiological factor to initiate diabetic ketoacidosis. These are the pooling of small amount of glycogen in cytozol and the predominance in cytozol of cells and adipocytes of palmitic triglycerides which are slowly hydrolyzed by hormone-dependent lipase to release non-esterified fatty acids into intercellular medium. The increase of their concentration in blood plasma precedes ketoacidosis which is developing in patients without diabetes mellitus too. When cells begin to oxidize unsaturated linoleic and linolenic acids with large number of double binds instead of medium-chain fatty acids, oleinic and palmitic fatty acids to support beta-oxidation in mitochondrions and synthesis of ATP the amount of butyric acid, beta-hidroxibutiryl-KoA and acetoacetyl-KoA increases and of acetyl-KoA decreases. The cause of fatal outcome is the development of metabolic acidosis, hyperhydration of cerebral cells with development of edema and a physiologic respiratory compensation of metabolic acidosis. The decarboxylation of acetoacetate and formation of acetone--initial stage of gluconeogenesis--formation of glucose from fatty acids--is manifested poorly both in primates and humans. From theoretical positions, to arrest ketoacidosis and to restore synthesis of AFT, it is reasonable to apply the infusion of optimal amount of acetyl-KoA which as nonpolar tioester can get over hematoencephalic , plasma membrane and inner membrane of mitochondrions. It is supposed that diabetes mellitus is to be considered primarily as pathology of metabolism of fatty acids and only secondly as pathology of glucose.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26173414>ALDH2 Deficiency Promotes Ethanol-Induced Gut  Dysfunction and Fatty Liver in Mice.</a></h2><p>Acetaldehyde, the toxic ethanol (EtOH) metabolite, disrupts intestinal epithelial  . Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) detoxifies acetaldehyde into . Subpopulations of Asians and Native Americans show polymorphism with loss-of- mutations in ALDH2. We evaluated the effect of ALDH2 deficiency on EtOH-induced disruption of intestinal epithelial tight junctions and adherens junctions, gut  dysfunction, and liver injury.Wild-type and ALDH2-deficient mice were fed EtOH (1 to 6%) in Lieber-DeCarli diet for 4 weeks. Gut permeability in vivo was measured by plasma-to-luminal flux of FITC-inulin, tight junction and adherens junction integrity was analyzed by confocal microscopy, and liver injury was assessed by the analysis of plasma transaminase activity, histopathology, and liver triglyceride.EtOH feeding elevated colonic mucosal acetaldehyde, which was significantly greater in ALDH2-deficient mice. ALDH2(-/-) mice showed a drastic reduction in the EtOH diet intake. Therefore, this study was continued only in wild-type and ALDH2(+/-) mice. EtOH feeding elevated mucosal inulin permeability in distal colon, but not in proximal colon, ileum, or jejunum of wild-type mice. In ALDH2(+/-) mice, EtOH-induced inulin permeability in distal colon was not only higher than that in wild-type mice, but inulin permeability was also elevated in the proximal colon, ileum, and jejunum. Greater inulin permeability in distal colon of ALDH2(+/-) mice was associated with a more severe redistribution of tight junction and adherens junction proteins from the intercellular junctions. In ALDH2(+/-) mice, but not in wild-type mice, EtOH feeding caused a loss of junctional distribution of tight junction and adherens junction proteins in the ileum. Histopathology, plasma transaminases, and liver triglyceride analyses showed that EtOH-induced liver damage was significantly greater in ALDH2(+/-) mice compared to wild-type mice.These data demonstrate that ALDH2 deficiency enhances EtOH-induced disruption of intestinal epithelial tight junctions,  dysfunction, and liver damage.Copyright © 2015 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27658293>Increases in Endogenous or Exogenous Progestins Promote Virus-Target Cell Interactions within the Non-human Primate Female Reproductive Tract.</a></h2><p>Currently, there are mounting data suggesting that HIV-1 acquisition in women can be affected by the use of certain hormonal contraceptives.

To gain mechanistic insights into this increased acquisition, we studied how mucosal   and CD4+ T-cell and CD68+ macrophage density and localization changed in the presence of natural progestins or after injection with high-dose DMPA. The presence of natural or injected progestins increased virus penetration of the columnar epithelium and the infiltration of susceptible cells into a thinned squamous epithelium of the vaginal vault, increasing the likelihood of potential virus interactions with target cells.

Although women have several options to play an active role in the couple family planning, men are very limited in terms of contraceptive methods. Several approaches have been proposed to develop a male contraceptive and can be divided in two major groups: hormonal and non-hormonal methods. Within the testis, the somatic Sertoli cell (SC) is known as the "nurse cell" since it provides the physical and nutritional support for the developing germ cells. Moreover, adjacent SCs form the Sertoli/blood testis  (BTB), which divides the seminiferous epithelium into the basal and the apical compartments, controlling the passage of substances to the site where germ cells develop. Among the several functions of SC, its metabolism and the production of lactate,  and other metabolic factors are essential for the normal occurrence of spermatogenesis. In the last years, several works have highlighted that the metabolic cooperation established between SCs and developing germ cells is compromised in several diseases associated with male subfertility/infertility. Notably, several metabolismassociated proteins are specifically expressed in the testis. Thus, there are several evidences illustrating that the control of male fertility can be achieved by targeting testicular cells metabolism. Herein, we discuss the metabolic cooperation in testis as a potential pharmacological target to counteract subfertility/infertility promoted by several diseases, particularly metabolic diseases. We also discuss how it can contribute to the development of a male contraceptive.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31213556>Bifidobacterium dentium Fortifies the Intestinal Mucus Layer via Autophagy and Calcium Signaling Pathways.</a></h2><p>Much remains unknown about how the intestinal microbiome interfaces with the protective intestinal mucus layer.  species colonize the intestinal mucus layer and can modulate mucus production by goblet cells.

In vivo, honokiol crossed the blood-brain or -cerebrospinal fluid , suggesting that it may be an effective drug for the treatment of brain tumors, including glioblastoma. This study examined the effect of honokiol on intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) and apoptosis in DBTRG-05MG human glioblastoma cells. Honokiol concentration-dependently induced a [Ca(2+)]i rise. The signal was decreased partially by removal of extracellular Ca(2+). Honokiol-triggered [Ca(2+)]i rise was not suppressed by store-operated Ca(2+) channel blockers (nifedipine, econazole, SK&F96365) and the protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol 12-myristate 13  (PMA), but was inhibited by the PKC inhibitor GF109203X. GF109203X-induced inhibition was not altered by removal of extracellular Ca(2+). In Ca(2+)-free medium, pretreatment with the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) pump inhibitor thapsigargin (TG) or 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone (BHQ) abolished honokiol-induced [Ca(2+)]i rise. Conversely, incubation with honokiol abolished TG or BHQ-induced [Ca(2+)]i rise. Inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC) with U73122 abolished honokiol-induced [Ca(2+)]i rise. Honokiol (20-80μM) reduced the cell viability, which was not reversed by prechelating cytosolic Ca(2+) with BAPTA-AM (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester). Honokiol (20-60μM) enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, released cytochrome c, and activated caspase-9/caspase-3. Together, honokiol induced a [Ca(2+)]i rise by inducing PLC-dependent Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum and Ca(2+) entry via PKC-dependent, non store-operated Ca(2+) channels.

An antioxidant-based therapy can be effective to ameliorate the deleterious effects of oxidative stress. Resveratrol (RSV) has been shown to be effective at removing excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) or reactive nitrogen species generation in the central nervous system (CNS), but the delivery of RSV into the brain through systemic administration is inefficient. Here, we have developed a RSV delivery vehicle based on polylactic acid (PLA)-coated mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNPs), conjugated with a ligand peptide of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) to enhance their transcytosis across the blood-brain  (BBB).Resveratrol was loaded into MSNPs (average diameter 200 nm, pore size 4 nm) at 16 μg/mg (w/w). As a gatekeeper, the PLA coating prevented the RSV burst release, while ROS was shown to trigger the drug release by accelerating PLA degradation. An in vitro BBB model with a co-culture of rat brain microvascular endothelial cells (RBECs) and microglia cells using Transwell chambers was established to assess the RSV delivery across BBB. The conjugation of LDLR ligand peptides markedly enhanced the migration of MSNPs across the RBECs monolayer. RSV could be released and effectively reduce the activation of the microglia cells stimulated by phorbol-myristate- or lipopolysaccharide.These ROS responsive LDLR peptides conjugated PLA-coated MSNPs have great potential for oxidative stress therapy in CNS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27007679>Medroxyprogesterone  and levonorgestrel increase genital mucosal permeability and enhance susceptibility to genital herpes simplex virus type 2 infection.</a></h2><p>Depot-medroxyprogesterone  (DMPA) is a hormonal contraceptive especially popular in areas with high prevalence of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI). Although observational studies identify DMPA as an important STI risk factor, mechanisms underlying this connection are undefined. Levonorgestrel (LNG) is another progestin used for hormonal contraception, but its effect on STI susceptibility is much less explored. Using a mouse model of genital herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection, we herein found that DMPA and LNG similarly reduced genital expression of the desmosomal cadherin desmoglein-1α (DSG1α), enhanced access of inflammatory cells to genital tissue by increasing mucosal epithelial permeability, and increased susceptibility to viral infection. Additional studies with uninfected mice revealed that DMPA-mediated increases in mucosal permeability promoted tissue inflammation by facilitating endogenous vaginal microbiota invasion. Conversely, concomitant treatment of mice with DMPA and intravaginal estrogen restored mucosal   and prevented HSV-2 infection. Evaluating ectocervical biopsy tissue from women before and 1 month after initiating DMPA remarkably revealed that inflammation and  protection were altered by treatment identically to changes seen in progestin-treated mice.

Here, we show that the angiogenic endothelium is characterized by the presence of functional podosome rosettes. These extracellular-matrix-degrading and adhesive structures are precursors of de novo branching points and represent a key feature in the formation of new blood vessels. VEGF-A stimulation induces the formation of endothelial podosome rosettes by upregulating integrin α6β1. In contrast, the binding of α6β1 integrin to the laminin of the vascular basement membrane impairs the formation of podosome rosettes by restricting α6β1 integrin to focal adhesions and hampering its translocation to podosomes. Using an ex vivo sprouting angiogenesis assay, transgenic and knockout mouse models and human tumour sample analysis, we provide evidence that endothelial podosome rosettes control blood vessel branching and are critical regulators of pathological angiogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25027317>Intranasal administration as a route for drug delivery to the brain: evidence for a unique pathway for albumin.</a></h2><p>A variety of compounds will distribute into the brain when placed at the cribriform plate by intranasal (i.n.) administration. In this study, we investigated the ability of albumin, a protein that can act as a drug carrier but is excluded from brain by the blood-brain , to distribute into the brain after i.n. administration. We labeled bovine serum albumin with [(125)I] ([(125)I]Alb) and studied its uptake into 11 brain regions and its entry into the blood from 5 minutes to 6 hours after i.n. administration. [(125)I]Alb was present throughout the brain at 5 minutes. Several regions showed distinct peaks in uptake that ranged from 5 minutes (parietal cortex) to 60 minutes (midbrain). About 2-4% of the i.n. [(125)I]Alb entered the bloodstream. The highest levels occurred in the olfactory bulb and striatum. Distribution was dose-dependent, with less taken up by whole brain, cortex, and blood at the higher dose of albumin. Uptake was selectively increased into the olfactory bulb and cortex by the fluid-phase stimulator PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-), but inhibitors to receptor-mediated transcytosis, caveolae, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase were without effect. Albumin altered the distribution of radioactive leptin given by i.n. administration, decreasing uptake into the blood and by the cerebellum and increasing uptake by the hypothalamus. We conclude that [(125)I]Alb administered i.n. reaches all parts of the brain through a dose-dependent mechanism that may involve fluid-phase transcytosis and, as illustrated by leptin, can affect the delivery of other substances to the brain after their i.n. administration.U.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29920474>The short chain fatty acids and lipopolysaccharides status in Sprague-Dawley rats fed with high-fat and high-cholesterol diet.</a></h2><p>Short chain fatty acids (SCFA) are produced by the gut microbiota during the fermentation of non-digestible polysaccharides.

Orientin, one of the C-glycosyl flavonoids, has been known to have anxiolytic and antioxidative activities. However, the effect of orientin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory response has not been studied. Here we investigated the  protective effects of orientin against pro-inflammatory responses induced by LPS and the associated signaling pathways. We found that orientin inhibited LPS-induced  disruption, expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), and adhesion/transendothelial migration of monocytes to human endothelial cells. Orientin induced potent inhibition of phorbol-12-myristate 13- (PMA) and LPS-induced EPCR shedding. Orientin also suppressed LPS-induced hyperpermeability and leukocyte migration in vivo. Furthermore, orientin suppressed the production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) or Interleukin (IL)-6 and the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) or extracellular regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2 by LPS. Moreover, treatment with orientin resulted in reduced LPS-induced lethal endotoxemia.

This reservoir is the major  to HIV-1 eradication. Current approaches to purging the latent reservoir involve pharmacologic induction of HIV-1 transcription and subsequent killing of infected cells by cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs) or viral cytopathic effects. Agents that reverse latency without activating T cells have been identified using in vitro models of latency. However, their effects on latently infected cells from infected individuals remain largely unknown. Using a new ex vivo assay, we demonstrate that none of the latency-reversing agents (LRAs) tested induced outgrowth of HIV-1 from the latent reservoir of patients on ART. Using a quantitative reverse transcription PCR assay specific for all HIV-1 mRNAs, we demonstrate that LRAs that do not cause T cell activation do not induce substantial increases in intracellular HIV-1 mRNA in patient cells; only the protein kinase C agonist bryostatin-1 caused significant increases. These findings demonstrate that current in vitro models do not fully recapitulate mechanisms governing HIV-1 latency in vivo.

We aimed to investigate the relationship between bacterial produced short-chain fatty acids, gut  , and stress measures.A fecal sample, hair sample, and questionnaire data were collected from 113 Belgian children (8-16 years old). Biological measures of stress included hair cortisol (most proximal 3 cm) and 5-minute heart rate variability (high frequency). Self-report measures of stress included emotional problems and negative events. Fecal calprotectin was determined as a marker of intestinal inflammation and an indirect indicator of gut  integrity. Fecal short-chain fatty acids (butyrate, propionate, , valerate, isobutyrate, and isovalerate) were measured with gas chromatography. Linear regression analyses were adjusted for sex, age, socioeconomic status, body mass index, fiber intake, and protein intake.Emotional problems were significantly associated with higher butyrate (β = 0.263), valerate (β = 0.230), isovalerate (β = 0.231), and isobutyrate (β = 0.233). Heart rate variability reflecting higher parasympathetic activity was related to lower valerate levels (β = -0.217). Hair cortisol was not associated with the short-chain fatty acids. None of the stress measures and none of the fecal short-chain fatty acids were significantly related to fecal calprotectin.In healthy children, the impact of chronic stress is manifested more obviously in short-chain fatty acids than in intestinal inflammation as measured by levels of calprotectin.

Severity of colitis, levels of short cahin fatty acids [SCFA] in caecum contents, expression of STAT 3 and STAT 4 proteins, CD4(+) CD45(+) lymphocytes, CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells [Tregs] and cytokines in the lamina propria [LP], epithelial expression of tight junction proteins, TNF-α/TNFR2 mRNA expression, and epithelial apoptosis in the proximal colon were measured at the end of the experiment.MF feeding effectively attenuated disease activity index and colitis associated with decreased lamina propria CD4(+) CD45(+) lymphocytes, IFN-γ/IL-17A mRNA expression, and p-STAT 3 and p-STAT 4 expression in colonic mucosa of IL-10(-/-) mice [p < 0.05]. Furthermore, CD4(+)Foxp3(+) Tregs in the LP and concentrations of total SCFA, , propionate, and butyrate in the caecum were markedly increased after MF feeding in IL-10(-/-) mice. After MF feeding, increased epithelial expression and correct localisation of tight junction proteins [occludin and zona occludens protein 1], as well as reduced TNF-α/TNFR2 mRNA expression and epithelial apoptosis, were also observed in IL-10(-/-) mice.These results indicated that EEN supplemented with the tested fibre mix, known to modulate the intestinal microbiota composition and SCFA production, could possibly improve efficacy in inducing remission in patients with active CD.Copyright © 2016 European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO).

Moreover, the preventive effect of zinc chloride (ZnCl) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was investigated. Pups were injected subcutaneously with saline (0.9% NaCl solution), ZnCl (27 mg/kg/day), NAC (5 mg/kg/day) or ZnCl plus NAC for 5 days (3rd-7th postnatal days), and with saline (0.9% NaCl solution) or AcPb (7 mg/kg/day) in the five subsequent days (8th-12th postnatal days). Animals were sacrificed 21 days after the last AcPb exposure. Pups exposed to AcPb presented inhibition of blood porphobilinogen-synthase (PBG-synthase) activity without changes in hemoglobin content. ZnCl pre-exposure partially prevented PBG-synthase inhibition. Regarding neurotoxicity biomarkers, animals exposed to AcPb presented a decrease in cerebrum acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and an increase in Pb accumulation in blood and cerebrum. These changes were prevented by pre-treatment with ZnCl, NAC, and ZnCl plus NAC. AcPb exposure caused no alteration in behavioral tasks. In short, results show that AcPb inhibited the activity of two important enzymatic biomarkers up to 21 days after the end of the exposure. Moreover, ZnCl and NAC prevented the alterations induced by AcPb.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25249339>Anti-inflammatory effects of Baicalin, Baicalein, and Wogonin in vitro and in vivo.</a></h2><p>Here, three structurally related polyphenols found in the Chinese herb Huang Qui, namely baicalin, baicalein, and wogonin, were examined for its effects on inflammatory responses by monitoring the effects of baicalin, baicalein, and wogonin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated vascular inflammatory responses. We found that each compound inhibited LPS-induced  disruption, expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), and adhesion/transendothelial migration of monocytes to human endothelial cells. Each compound induced potent inhibition of phorbol-12-myristate 13- and LPS-induced endothelial cell protein C receptor shedding. It also suppressed LPS-induced hyperpermeability and leukocytes migration in vivo. Furthermore, each compound suppressed the production of tumor necrosis factor-α or interleukin-6 and the activation of nuclear factor-κB or extracellular regulated kinases 1/2 by LPS. Moreover, treatment with each compound resulted in reduced LPS-induced lethal endotoxemia. These results suggest that baicalin, baicalein, and wogonin posses anti-inflammatory functions by inhibiting hyperpermeability, expression of CAMs, and adhesion and migration of leukocytes, thereby endorsing its usefulness as a therapy for vascular inflammatory diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24781306>The short-chain fatty acid  reduces appetite via a central homeostatic mechanism.</a></h2><p>Increased intake of dietary carbohydrate that is fermented in the colon by the microbiota has been reported to decrease body weight, although the mechanism remains unclear. Here we use in vivo(11)C- and PET-CT scanning to show that colonic  crosses the blood-brain  and is taken up by the brain. Intraperitoneal  results in appetite suppression and hypothalamic neuronal activation patterning. We also show that  administration is associated with activation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and changes in the expression profiles of regulatory neuropeptides that favour appetite suppression. Furthermore, we demonstrate through (13)C high-resolution magic-angle-spinning that (13)C  from fermentation of (13)C-labelled carbohydrate in the colon increases hypothalamic (13)C  above baseline levels. Hypothalamic (13)C  regionally increases the (13)C labelling of the glutamate-glutamine and GABA neuroglial cycles, with hypothalamic (13)C lactate reaching higher levels than the 'remaining brain'.

On the other hand, lead is highly carcinogenic and exhibits liver and kidney toxicity. This element can also cross the blood-brain , reduce learning and memory ability and damage the structure of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. To further investigate the mechanism of lead neurotoxicity, 4-week-old Kunming mice were used to explore the effects of different concentrations of Pb (0, 2.4, 4.8 and 9.6 mM) for 9 days. In this study, pathological and ultrastructural changes in brain cells of the treated group were related to damages to mitochondria, chromatin and the nucleus. Lead content in blood was tested by atomic absorption spectroscopy, which showed high lead concentrations in the blood with increasing doses of lead. Distribution of lead in nerve cells was analysed by transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy. Data showed the presence of lead in nucleopores, chromatin and nuclear membrane of nerve cells in the treatment groups, whereas lead content increased with increasing doses of lead . Finally, microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) mRNA and protein expression levels were detected by real-time PCR and Western blotting, which showed a reduction in MAP2 expression with increasing lead doses in the mouse brain. These findings suggest that acute lead poisoning can cause significant dose-dependent toxic effects on mouse brain  and can contribute to better understanding of lead-induced toxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24145137>The 3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane scaffold for subtype selective nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ligands. Part 2: carboxamide derivatives with different spacer motifs.</a></h2><p>3,7-Diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (bispidine) based nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) ligands have been synthesized and evaluated for nAChRs interaction. Diverse spacer motifs were incorporated between the hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) part and a variety of substituted (hetero)aryl moieties. Bispidine carboxamides bearing spacer motifs often showed high affinity in the low nanomolar range and selectivity for the α4β2(∗) nAChR. Compounds 15, 25, and 47 with Ki values of about 1 nM displayed the highest affinities for α4β2(∗) nAChR.

It has been reported that SCFAs can repair the dysfunction of intestinal , however, the underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. Here, we investigated the stimulative and protective effects of SCFAs on intestinal   and the possible mechanisms.To investigate the effects of SCFAs on intestinal  , the Caco-2 monolayers were exposed to , propionate, butyrate respectively or simultaneously without or with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Next, Caco-2 cells were treated with trichostatin A and etomoxir to identify whether SCFAs act as HDAC inhibitors or energy substances. To activate NLRP3 inflammasome and autophagy, Caco-2 cells were treated with LPS+ATP and rapamycin respectively without or with SCFAs. The transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and paracellular permeability were respectively detected with a Millicell-ERS voltohmmeter and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence were applied to analyze the expression and distribution of tight junction proteins, and the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and autophagy. (0.5mM), propionate(0.01mM) and butyrate (0.01mM) alone or in combination significantly increased TER, and stimulated the formation of tight junction. SCFAs also dramatically attenuated the LPS-induced TER reduction and paracellular permeability increase, accompanying significantly alleviated morphological disruption of ZO-1 and occludin. Meanwhile, the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and autophagy induced by LPS were significantly inhibited by SCFAs. Trichostatin A imitated the inhibiting action of SCFAs on NLRP3 inflammasome, whereas etomoxir blocked the action of SCFAs on protecting intestinal  and inhibiting autophagy. In addition, the activation of autophagy and NLRP3 inflammasome by rapamycin and LPS+ATP resulted in TER reduction, paracellular permeability increase and morphological disruption of both ZO-1 and occludin, which was alleviated by SCFAs.It is suggested that SCFAs stimulate the formation of intestinal , and protect the intestinal  from the disruption of LPS through inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome and autophagy. In addition, SCFAs act as energy substances to protect intestinal  and inhibit autophagy, but act as HDAC inhibitors to suppress NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, the mutual promoting action between NLRP3 inflammasome and autophagy would destroy intestinal  , which could be alleviated by SCFAs.© 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.

Small intestinal epithelium is exposed to high concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), but their role in regulating intestinal mucosal   and motility is not fully understood. What is the main finding and its importance? By perfusing the duodenal segment in anaesthetized rats, we show that  and propionate significantly decrease mucosal paracellular permeability and transepithelial net fluid flux and increase mucosal bicarbonate secretion. Likewise, SCFAs administered i.v. decrease mucosal permeability but decrease bicarbonate secretion. Altered luminal chemosensing or aberrant signalling in response to SCFAs might contribute to symptoms observed in patients with suppressed mucosal  . Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are produced by bacterial fermentation in the large intestine, particularly from diets containing fibres and carbohydrates. The small intestinal epithelium is exposed to SCFAs derived mainly from oral bacteria or food supplementation. Although luminal nutrients are important in regulation of intestinal functions, the role of SCFAs in regulation of small intestinal mucosal   and motility has not been fully described. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the effects of  and propionate on duodenal mucosal   and motility. Rats were anaesthetized with thiobarbiturate, and a 30 mm segment of proximal duodenum with an intact blood supply was perfused. The effects on duodenal bicarbonate secretion, blood-to-lumen clearance of  Cr-EDTA, motility and transepithelial net fluid flux were investigated. Perfusion of the duodenum with  or propionate significantly decreased mucosal paracellular permeability and transepithelial net fluid flux and significantly increased bicarbonate secretion.  or propionate administered as an i.v. infusion decreased the mucosal paracellular permeability, but significantly decreased bicarbonate secretion. Luminal SCFAs changed the duodenal motility pattern from migrating motor complexes to fed patterns. Systemic administration of glucagon-like peptide-2 induced increases in both bicarbonate secretion and net fluid absorption, but did not change motility. Glucagon-like peptide-2 infusion during luminal perfusion of SCFAs significantly reduced the motility. In conclusion, SCFAs decreased duodenal paracellular permeability and net fluid flux. Short-chain fatty acids induced opposite effects on bicarbonate secretion after luminal and i.v. administration. Presence of SCFAs in the lumen induces fed motility patterns. Altered luminal chemosensing and aberrant signalling in response to SCFAs might contribute to symptoms observed in patients with suppressed  .© 2017 The Authors.

However, it is not clear whether AA plays some TRPV3-mediated pathological roles in the development of edema. Pharmacological and histological studies using ICR and ICR mice indicated that higher ear edema responses to topical application of AA were observed in ICR mice compared with ICR mice. However, there was no difference in the ear edema response to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-, skin histology, and skin   between these mouse strains. Furthermore, oxidized fatty acids from the lesional site were analyzed to elucidate the TRPV3-mediated pathological roles of AA, and the results revealed that there were no differences in the level of COX or LOX metabolites derived from AA between both mouse strains. We concluded that AA plays a role in the development of TRPV3-mediated ear edema and that this result may contribute to better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the development of a certain type of edema.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25095388>[Simultaneous determination of six Salvia miltiorrhiza gradients in rat plasma and brain by LC-MS/MS].</a></h2><p>To develop a LC-MS/MS method for the determination of protocatechuic acid, protocatechuic aldehyde, salvianolic acid A, salvianolic acid B, cryptotanshinone and tanshinone II(A) in rat plasma and brain.

The purpose of this study was to characterize the blood-brain  permeability of twelve coumarins from APR including umbelliferone (1), osthol (2), scopoletin (3), peucedanol (4), ulopterol (5), angepubebisin (6), psoralen (7), xanthotoxin (8), bergapten (9), isoimperatorin (10), columbianadin (11), and columbianetin  (12) with an in vitro model using a MDCK-pHaMDR cell monolayer. The cell monolayer was validated to be suitable for the permeation experiments. The samples' transports were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography and their apparent permeability coefficients (Papp) were calculated. According to the Papp value, most coumarins could be characterized as well-absorbed compounds except for 4, 10 and 11 which were moderately absorbed ones, in concentration-dependent and time-dependent manners. The results of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor (verapamil) experiments showed that the transport of coumarin 4 was affected by the transport protein P-gp. Sigmoid functions between permeability log(Papp AP-BL*MW0.5) and log D (at pH 7.4) were established to analyze the structure-activity relationship of coumarins.

The increase in intestinal permeability allows the translocation of luminal antigens across the intestinal epithelium, leading to the exacerbation of colitis. Thus, therapies targeted at specifically restoring tight junction   are thought to have great potential as an alternative or supplement to immunology-based therapies. In this study, we screened Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, and Lactobacillus species for beneficial microbes to strengthen the intestinal epithelial , using the human intestinal epithelial cell line (Caco-2) in an in vitro assay. Some Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species prevented epithelial  disruption induced by TNF-α, as assessed by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER). Furthermore, live Bifidobacterium species promoted wound repair in Caco-2 cell monolayers treated with TNF-α for 48 h.

Therefore, biomarkers that reflect the protective capacity against MeHg are needed. The critical role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of MeHg cytotoxicity has been demonstrated. Because MeHg has high affinity for selenohydryl groups, sulfhydryl groups, and selenides, and causes posttranscriptional defects in selenoenzymes, proteins with selenohydryl and sulfhydryl groups should play a critical role in mediating MeHg-induced oxidative stress. Here, plasma oxidative stress markers and selenoproteins were investigated in MeHg-intoxicated rats showing neuropathological changes after 4 weeks of MeHg exposure. The thiol antioxidant  (-SHp) level significantly decreased 2 weeks after MeHg exposure, which is an early stage at which no systemic oxidative stress, histopathological changes, or clinical signs were detected. Diacron reactive oxidant metabolite (d-ROM) levels significantly increased 3 weeks after MeHg exposure, indicating the occurrence of systemic oxidative stress. Rats treated with lead  or cadmium chloride showed no changes in levels of -SHp and d-ROM. Selenoprotein P1 abundance significantly decreased in MeHg-treated rats, whereas it significantly increased in rats treated with Pb or Cd. Plasma selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (GPx3) activity also significantly decreased after MeHg exposure, whereas plasma non-selenoenzyme glutathione reductase activity significantly increased in MeHg-treated rats. The results suggest that decreased capacity of -SHp and selenoproteins (GPx3 and selenoprotein P) can be useful biomarkers of ongoing MeHg cytotoxicity and the individual protective capacity against the MeHg body burden.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28255937>How Biomechanical Improvements in Running Economy Could Break the 2-hour Marathon .</a></h2><p>A sub-2-hour marathon requires an average velocity (5.86 m/s) that is 2.5% faster than the current world record of 02:02:57 (5.72 m/s) and could be accomplished with a 2.7% reduction in the metabolic cost of running. Although supporting body weight comprises the majority of the metabolic cost of running, targeting the costs of forward propulsion and leg swing are the most promising strategies for reducing the metabolic cost of running and thus improving marathon running performance. Here, we calculate how much time could be saved by taking advantage of unconventional drafting strategies, a consistent tailwind, a downhill course, and specific running shoe design features while staying within the current International Association of Athletic Federations regulations for record purposes. Specifically, running in shoes that are 100 g lighter along with second-half scenarios of four runners alternately leading and drafting, or a tailwind of 6.0 m/s, combined with a 42-m elevation drop could result in a time well below the 2-hour marathon .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24251808>New and emerging immune-targeted drugs for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.</a></h2><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease with a major inflammatory component that constitutes the most common progressive and disabling neurological condition in young adults.

Results showed that, within the range of ethanol concentration, the initial conversion rate was varied significantly with the concentration of ethanol and the maximum was obtained at 8% (v/v) ethanol, which was increased by 32.6% compared with the control. A series of cell features closely relevant to biotransformation efficiency were further analyzed. It indicated that ethanol acting on cell wall and membrane could be used as a mediator to enhance cell permeability, which facilitated the penetration of substrate across cell  within a short time, resulting in the elevated initial conversation rate. The observation of fatty acids composition suggested that the increased unsaturated fatty acids, especially cis-isomers, in the presence of ethanol led to the disorganization of the native arrangement of lipids and thus increased cell permeability. Our findings demonstrated that another facilitation of ethanol was to promote substrate transport into cells by permeabilization, which would provide the guidance in the practical application of organic solvents in steroid biotransformation.© 2014 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25460153>Pulmonary delivered polymeric micelles--pharmacokinetic evaluation and biodistribution studies.</a></h2><p>Polymeric micelles represent interesting delivery systems for pulmonary sustained release.

Liver TJs preserve cellular polarity by delimiting functional bile-canalicular structures, forming the blood-biliary . In acetaminophen-hepatotoxicity, the mechanism by which tissue cohesion and polarity are affected remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that acetaminophen, even at low-dose, disrupts the integrity of TJ and cell-matrix adhesions, with indicators of cellular stress with liver injury in the human hepatic HepaRG cell line, and primary hepatocytes. In mouse liver, at human-equivalence (therapeutic) doses, dose-dependent loss of intercellular hepatic TJ-associated ZO-1 protein expression was evident with progressive clinical signs of liver injury. Temporal, dose-dependent and specific disruption of the TJ-associated ZO-1 and cytoskeletal-F-actin proteins, correlated with modulation of hepatic ultrastructure. Real-time impedance biosensing verified in vitro early, dose-dependent quantitative decreases in TJ and cell-substrate adhesions. Whereas treatment with NAPQI, the reactive metabolite of acetaminophen, or the PKCα-activator and TJ-disruptor phorbol-12-myristate-13-, similarly reduced TJ integrity, which may implicate oxidative stress and the PKC pathway in TJ destabilization.

As a result of these non-specific immune defence parameters, we compared the antibacterial capacity of skin mucus in these species via in vitro dual bacteria strains-skin mucus co-culture growths. We used Pseudomonas anguilliseptica and Vibrio anguillarum as marine pathogenic bacteria and Escherichia coli as non-pathogenic. For each fish species, in the respective zymograms, we determined a pattern of proteolytic digestion bands. A high-molecular-weight band (around 200 kDa; H-band) was evident in sea bream and sea bass, and showed chymotrypsin activity. One or two intermediate-molecular-weight bands (around 75 kDa; I-bands) with non-trypsin and non-chymotrypsin activity, and putatively with metalloprotease activity, were evident in all species. Finally, low-molecular-weight bands (between 14 and 30 kDa; L-bands) showed distinct patterns for each species and matched trypsin activity. Despite the conservative pattern of digestion bands, the levels of total proteolytic activity (TPA) were 5 and 10 times higher in meagre than in sea bass and sea bream, respectively. In parallel, three carboxylesterase activities were detected in the mucus of the three fish species, using myristate (pNPM-CE activity), butyrate (pNPB-CE activity) and  (pNPA-CE activity) as substrates. Both pNPB-CE and pNPA-CE were the most abundant in fish mucus, and meagre was again the species with the highest levels. In contrast, the antioxidant power of meagre skin mucus was the lowest. We established the capacity of skin mucus to block or limit bacterial growth (lytic activity) using 24 h growth curves. The log-growth phase of V. anguillarum was strongly blocked by sea bream and meagre mucus for a few hours; but not by sea bass mucus. However, if mucus was not renewed, log-growth was at the end of 24 h studied period. For its part, P. anguilliseptica growth curve was delayed by the three mucus types during the entire growth period. Only meagre achieved lytic activity against E. coli growth. All parameters studied here will be of a great interest as non-invasive bioindicators of non-specific immune defences in fish skin mucus.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

To examine efficacy of dogwood borer control in orchards, all  trials were replicated in field tests, both in combination with mating disruption and without it. Trunk inspections to determine whether mating disruption and barriers effectively reduced actual tree infestation showed pheromone disruption significantly reduced infestation compared with the untreated check, but was not as effective as trunk handgun sprays of chlorpyrifos. EVA trunk barriers were effective in preventing borer infestation compared with untreated trees. The elastomer did not differ from the check or the EVA treatment. There was no interaction between disruption and  treatments.  field life and durability was assessed over 2 yr by comparing degradation over time due to weathering and other environmental effects including animal damage. The EVA persisted and remained more intact than the elastomer, but was in need of reapplication after 2 yr. Barriers were also screened for efficacy against voles in small-plot trials in nonorchard locations with known high vole pressure; they were tested either alone, combined with a repellent (thiram), or, in the case of the elastomer only, combined with an abrasive (sand). Only the EVA significantly lowered vole chewing damage relative to the untreated checks.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31255775>Hair removal and bioavailability of chemicals: Effect of physicochemical properties of drugs and surfactants on skin permeation ex vivo.</a></h2><p>Cosmetic hair removal procedures are everyday routines in our society. However, it is unclear if such routines lead to increased uptake of applied substances such as drugs or formulation compounds, potentially resulting in skin irritation or sensitization. The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of common depilation and epilation methods on skin penetration of two surfactants and four model drugs of different physicochemical properties using the porcine ear model. It should be elucidated whether the substances' skin penetration behavior would be affected by hair removal procedures and if potential effects would be related to their polarity. Confocal Raman spectroscopy revealed no effect of hair removal on total penetration depths of SDS and sulfathiazole. Significantly higher relative penetrated amounts within 0-6 µm of stratum corneum depth were found for SDS after dry shaving, depilatory cream and waxing and for sulfathiazole after all depilation methods and partly after epilation. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy revealed no effect of hair removal on the penetration depth of lecithin LPC80, but higher relative amounts at the skin surface after wet shaving and electric epilation. Diffusion cell experiments using a lecithin-based microemulsion as carrier system for fluconazole, fludrocortisone  and flufenamic acid showed higher cumulative amounts, higher drug fluxes and shorter lag times for the more lipophilic drugs for some of the methods, but only shorter lag times in some cases for fluconazole. In summary, the observed effects appeared to depend on drug polarity and experimental setup.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The samples were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography and the apparent permeability coefficients (Papp) were calculated. Among the fifteen test compounds, benzonfuran-type, dibenzylbutane-type and arylnaphthalene-type lignans showed poor to moderate permeabilities with Papp values at 10(-8)-10(-6) cm/s; those of 8-O-4'-neolignan and tetrahydrofuran-lignan were at 10(-6)-10(-5) cm/s, meaning that their permeabilities are moderate to high; the permeabilities of malabaricones were poor as their Papp values were at 10(-8)-10(-7) cm/s. To 5-methoxy-dehydrodiisoeugenol (2), erythro-2-(4-allyl-2,6-dimethoxyphenoxy)-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-propan-1-ol  (6), verrucosin (8), and nectandrin B (9), an efflux way was involved and the main transporter for 6, 8 and 9 was demonstrated to be P-glycoprotein.

As these analogs induce de novo synthesis of endogenous prostaglandins, their therapeutic, hypotensive effect could potentially be inhibited by anti-inflammatory treatment. We therefore evaluated whether topical 1% prednisolone  alters the effects of 0.005% latanoprost on pupil diameter (PD) and intraocular pressure (IOP).Ten healthy Labrador retriever dogs from the Israel Guide Dog Center for the Blind.Pupil diameter and IOP were measured hourly, 8 AM-4 PM, with the right and left eyes serving as control (CE) and treated (TE) eyes, respectively. Measurements were conducted during four sessions: (1) without treatment (n = 10), (2) following latanoprost treatment (n = 10) at 8 AM, (3) following prednisolone treatment (n = 7) at 8 AM, and (4) bilateral latanoprost treatment at 8 AM, prednisolone treatment in TE at 11 AM (n = 8). The different number of dogs in sessions 3 and 4 is because some dogs were matched with their new owners earlier than expected.Pupil diameters were not affected by the addition of prednisolone and, at 4 PM, were 3.82 ± 0.47 and 3.97 ± 0.36 mm in TE and CE, respectively (P = 0.175, Wilcoxon).

Numerous studies have shown that inflammatory response played an important role in ICH-induced brain injury. Theaflavin (TF) extracted from black tea has various biological functions including anti-inflammatory activity. In this study, we investigated whether TF could inhibit ICH-induced inflammatory response in rats and explored its mechanism.ICH rat models were induced with type VII collagenase and pretreated with TF by gavage in different doses (25 mg/kg-100 mg/kg). Twenty-four hours after ICH attack, we evaluated the rats' behavioral performance, the blood-brain  (BBB) integrity, and the formation of cerebral edema. The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokines were examined by 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Nissl staining and transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) were aimed to detect the neuron loss and apoptosis, the mechanism of which was explored by Western blot.It was found that in the pretreated ICH rats TF significantly alleviated the behavioral defects, protected BBB integrity, and decreased the formation of cerebral edema and the levels of ROS as well as inflammatory cytokines (including interleukin-1 beta [IL-1β], IL-18, tumor nectosis factor-alpha, interferon-γ, transforming growth factor beta, and (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 [CXCL1]). Nissl staining and TUNEL displayed TF could protect against the neuron loss and apoptosis via inhibiting the activation of nuclear transcription factor kappa-β-p65 (NF-κβ-p65), caspase-1, and IL-1β. We also found that phorbol 12-myristate 13-, a nonspecific activator of NF-κβ-p65, weakened the positive effect of TF on ICH-induced neural defects and neuron apoptosis by upregulating NF-κβ-related signaling pathway.TF could alleviate ICH-induced inflammatory responses and brain injury in rats via inhibiting NF-κβ-related pathway, which may provide a new way for the therapy of ICH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31058160>The Effects of Vegetarian and Vegan Diets on Gut Microbiota.</a></h2><p>The difference in gut microbiota composition between individuals following vegan or vegetarian diets and those following omnivorous diets is well documented. A plant-based diet appears to be beneficial for human health by promoting the development of more diverse and stable microbial systems. Additionally, vegans and vegetarians have significantly higher counts of certain -related operational taxonomic units compared to omnivores. Fibers (that is, non-digestible carbohydrates, found exclusively in plants) most consistently increase lactic acid bacteria, such as , and , and reduce  and  species. Polyphenols, also abundant in plant foods, increase  and , which provide anti-pathogenic and anti-inflammatory effects and cardiovascular protection. High fiber intake also encourages the growth of species that ferment fiber into metabolites as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including , propionate, and butyrate. The positive health effects of SCFAs are myriad, including improved immunity against pathogens, blood-brain  integrity, provision of energy substrates, and regulation of critical functions of the intestine. In conclusion, the available literature suggests that a vegetarian/vegan diet is effective in promoting a diverse ecosystem of beneficial bacteria to support both human gut microbiome and overall health.

However, little is known about their influences on intestinal bacterial communities. Here, we described a response in intestinal microbiome to CGA using a porcine model. Twenty-four weaned pigs were allotted to two groups and fed with a basal diet or a basal diet containing 1000 mg/kg CGA. Results showed that CGA significantly increased the length of the small intestine (P < 0.05) and enhanced the activity of diamine oxidase (DAO) and the concentration of MHC-II in the jejunal and ileal mucosa (P < 0.05). Moreover, the  concentration in ileum and cecum digesta, and the propionate and butyrate concentrations in the cecum digesta, were significantly elevated by CGA (P < 0.05). Interestingly, CGA significantly increased the total 16S rRNA gene copies and bacterial alpha diversity in the cecum (P < 0.05). The relative abundance of bacteria from phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes was increased in the cecum digesta (P < 0.05), whereas the abundance of bacteria from phylum Protebacteria was decreased by CGA (P < 0.05). Importantly, pigs on CGA-containing diet had higher abundance of Lactobacillus spp., Prevotella spp., Anaerovibrio spp., and Alloprevotella spp. in the cecum (P < 0.05). Not only did our study suggest a synergic response of intestinal   and microbiota to the CGA, but the result will also contribute to understanding of the mechanisms behind the CGA-modulated gut health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24741637>Oxidative stress is differentially present in multiple sclerosis courses, early evident, and unrelated to treatment.</a></h2><p>Oxidative stress is well documented in multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions, but its correspondence at peripheral level is still controversial. Objective. To evaluate peripheral oxidative stress markers in MS patients.We studied total blood levels of Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), oxidized and reduced forms of glutathione, malondialdehyde, reactive oxygen species (ROS), anti-oxidized-low-density lipoproteins (anti-oxLDL) antibodies, and antioxidant power (PAO) in 87 patients with different MS clinical phenotypes and in 77 controls.CoQ10 was lower whereas anti-oxLDL antibodies titer was higher in MS patients than in controls. The benign variant of MS displayed both higher CoQ10 and higher anti-oxLDL than other MS clinical variants. Female patients had lower CoQ10 and PAO and higher ROS than male patients. Differences were greater in younger patients with shorter disease duration. Surprisingly, there was no difference for these markers between treated and untreated patients.We found lower antioxidant agents and higher anti-oxLDL antibodies in MS, and the highest antibody titers occurred in the benign form. We suggest that natural anti-oxLDL antibodies can be protective against MS, saving blood brain  integrity. Our findings also suggest that milder MS is associated with a distinct oxidative stress pattern, which may provide a useful biomarker of disease prognosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24823859>Protein kinase C restricts transport of carnitine by amino acid transporter ATB(0,+) apically localized in the blood-brain .</a></h2><p>Carnitine (3-hydroxy-4-trimethylammoniobutyrate) is necessary for transfer of fatty acids through the inner mitochondrial membrane. Carnitine, not synthesized in the brain, is delivered there through the strongly polarized blood-brain  (BBB). Expression and presence of two carnitine transporters - organic cation/carnitine transporter (OCTN2) and amino acid transporter B(0,+) (ATB(0,+)) have been demonstrated previously in an in vitro model of the BBB. Due to potential protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation sites within ATB(0,+) sequence, the present study verified effects of this kinase on transporter  and localization in the BBB. ATB(0,+) can be regulated by estrogen receptor α and up-regulated in vitro, therefore its presence in vivo was verified with the transmission electron microscopy. The analyses of brain slices demonstrated ATB(0,+) luminal localization in brain capillaries, confirmed by biotinylation experiments in an in vitro model of the BBB. Brain capillary endothelial cells were shown to control carnitine gradient. ATB(0,+) was phosphorylated by PKC, what correlated with inhibition of carnitine transport. PKC activation did not change the amount of ATB(0,+) present in the apical membrane of brain endothelial cells, but resulted in transporter exclusion from raft microdomains. ATB(0,+) inactivation by a lateral movement in plasma membrane after transporter phosphorylation has been postulated.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Indeed, an intracellular form of renin has been described in the brain, but whether it displays angiotensin (Ang) I-generating activity (AGA) is unknown. Here, we quantified brain (pro)renin, before and after buffer perfusion of the brain, in wild-type mice, renin knockout mice, deoxycorticosterone  salt-treated mice, and Ang II-infused mice. Brain regions were homogenized and incubated with excess angiotensinogen to detect AGA, before and after prorenin activation, using a renin inhibitor to correct for nonrenin-mediated AGA. Renin-dependent AGA was readily detectable in brain regions, the highest AGA being present in brain stem (>thalamus=cerebellum=striatum=midbrain>hippocampus=cortex). Brain AGA increased marginally after prorenin activation, suggesting that brain prorenin is low. Buffer perfusion reduced AGA in all brain areas by >60%. Plasma renin (per mL) was 40× to 800× higher than brain renin (per gram). Renin was undetectable in plasma and brain of renin knockout mice. Deoxycorticosterone  salt and Ang II suppressed plasma renin and brain renin in parallel, without upregulating brain prorenin. Finally, Ang I was undetectable in brains of spontaneously hypertensive rats, while their brain/plasma Ang II concentration ratio decreased by 80% after Ang II type 1 receptor blockade. In conclusion, brain renin levels (per gram) correspond with the amount of renin present in 1 to 20 μL of plasma. Brain renin disappears after buffer perfusion and varies in association with plasma renin. This indicates that brain renin represents trapped plasma renin. Brain Ang II represents Ang II taken up from blood rather than locally synthesized Ang II.© 2017 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29486847>Development of active packaging material based on cellulose  butyrate/polyethylene glycol/aryl ammonium cation modified clay.</a></h2><p>Active packaging is one of the interesting concepts in food industry which extend the shelf-life of the food products.

Exposure to high doses of radiation triggers a number of potentially lethal effects. Among the most severe is the gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity syndrome caused by the destruction of the intestinal , resulting in bacterial translocation, systemic bacteremia, sepsis, and death. The lack of effective radioprotective agents capable of mitigating radiation-induced damage has prompted a search for novel countermeasures that can mitigate the effects of radiation post exposure, accelerate tissue repair in radiation-exposed individuals, and prevent mortality. We report that a single injection of regenerative peptide TP508 (rusalatide , Chrysalin) 24 h after lethal radiation exposure (9 Gy, LD100/15) appears to significantly increase survival and delay mortality by mitigating radiation-induced intestinal and colonic toxicity. TP508 treatment post exposure prevents the disintegration of GI crypts, stimulates the expression of adherens junction protein E-cadherin, activates crypt cell proliferation, and decreases apoptosis. TP508 post-exposure treatment also upregulates the expression of DCLK1 and LGR5 markers of stem cells that have been shown to be responsible for maintaining and regenerating intestinal crypts. Thus, TP508 appears to mitigate the effects of GI toxicity by activating radioresistant stem cells and increasing the stemness potential of crypts to maintain and restore intestinal integrity. These results suggest that TP508 may be an effective emergency nuclear countermeasure that could be delivered within 24 h post exposure to increase survival and delay mortality, giving victims time to reach clinical sites for advanced medical treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29431236>Crystal Nucleation of Tolbutamide in Solution: Relationship to Solvent, Solute Conformation, and Solution Structure.</a></h2><p>The influence of the solvent in nucleation of tolbutamide, a medium-sized, flexible and polymorphic organic molecule, has been explored by measuring nucleation induction times, estimating solvent-solute interaction enthalpies using molecular modelling and calorimetric data, probing interactions and clustering with spectroscopy, and modelling solvent-dependence of molecular conformation in solution. The nucleation driving force required to reach the same induction time is strongly solvent-dependent, increasing in the order: acetonitrile<ethyl <n-propanol<toluene. The combined DFT and MD modelling results show that in acetonitrile, ethyl  and n-propanol the nucleation difficulty is a  of the strength of solvent-solute interaction, with emphasis on the interaction with specific H-bonding polar sites of importance in the crystal structure. A clear exception from this rule is the most difficult nucleation in toluene despite the weakest solvent-solute interactions. However molecular dynamics modelling predicts that tolbutamide assumes an intramolecularly H-bonded conformation in toluene, substantially different from and more stable than the conformation in the crystal structure, and thus presenting an additional  to nucleation. This explains why nucleation in toluene is the most difficult and why the relatively higher propensity for aggregation of tolbutamide molecules in toluene solution, as observed with FTIR spectroscopy, does not translate into easier nucleation. Thus, our combined experimental and molecular modelling study suggests that the solvent can influence on the nucleation not only via differences in the desolvation but also through the influence on molecular conformation.© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Pullulan  (PA) nanoparticles (NPs) are a promising nanocarrier derived from natural polysaccharide; however, their transplacental transport ability and mechanism are unknown.In this study, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated PA (PA-FITC) was synthesized. PA-FITC NPs were characterized by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The cytotoxicity of PA-FITC NPs at concentrations of 15, 30, 60, 125, 250, 500, 1,000 and 2,000 μg/mL was studied by cell counting kit-8. The human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) cytokine assay was conducted to evaluate the biological  of BeWo b30 cells. Endocytic mechanisms of PA-FITC NPs were investigated via fluorescence analysis. The monolayer properties were characterized by TEM, tight junction staining, transepithelial electrical resistance and fluorescein sodium transportation. The transport ability was measured in the cell based transwell model by confocal imaging and SEM.PA-FITC NPs were almost spherical shape with a size range of 200-300 nm. Cell viability of BeWo b30 cells was up to 100% in all groups. The concentrations of HCG increased with increasing numbers of cells and culture time, which showed the good biological  of BeWo b30 cells. PA-FITC NPs were rapidly endocytosed through caveolae-mediated endocytosis and pinocytosis, with uptake inhibition rates with nystatin (NY) and colchicines (Col) of 55% and 51% respectively. BeWo b30 cell monolayer was formed over 5 days. PA-FITC NPs were found in the cytoplasm of cells on the transwell membranes; while some NPs were found in the basolateral (fetal) compartment over 24 h.In summary, PA-FITC NPs are nontoxic, can cross the blood-placental , and show mainly internalization to BeWo b30 cells through caveolae-mediated endocytosis and pinocytosis pathways, major via the former pathway.

In sensitized subjects, ingested nickel (Ni) may induce gastrointestinal symptoms similar to IBS, in addition to typical systemic cutaneous lesions (systemic nickel allergy syndrome [SNAS]). A low nickel diet could improve the systemic manifestations. We evaluated prevalence of nickel allergy in IBS and effects of low Ni diet on (1) gastrointestinal symptoms control, (2) intestinal  , (3) quality of life, and (4) psychological status of patients with IBS and Ni-sensitized patients.Twenty consecutive patients affected by IBS and suspected SNAS underwent intestinal permeability tests.

We have previously shown that epidermal deficiency of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17), the principal EGFR ligand sheddase, results in postnatal skin  defects in mice due to impeded TG activity. However, the mechanism by which ADAM17/EGFR signalling maintains TG activity during epidermal differentiation remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that ADAM17-dependent EGFR signalling promotes TG activity in keratinocytes committed to terminal differentiation by direct induction of TG1 expression. Restored TG1 expression of EGF-stimulated differentiated Adam17 keratinocytes was strongly repressed by inhibitors for PLCγ1 or protein kinase C (PKC) pathways, while treatment with the PKC stimulator 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- restored TG activity in the epidermis of keratinocyte-specific Adam17 (AD17) mice. Further investigations emphasized the expression of PKCη, a mediator of TGM1 transcription, to be sensitive to EGFR activation. In agreement, topical skin application of cholesterol sulfate, an activator of PKCη, significantly improved TG activity in epidermis of AD17 mice. Our results suggest ADAM17/EGFR-driven PLCγ1 and PKC pathways as important promoters of TG1 expression during terminal keratinocyte differentiation. These findings may help to identify new therapeutic targets for inflammatory skin diseases related to epidermal  defects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25259616>A MIV-150/zinc  gel inhibits SHIV-RT infection in macaque vaginal explants.</a></h2><p>To extend our observations that single or repeated application of a gel containing the NNRTI MIV-150 (M) and zinc  dihydrate (ZA) in carrageenan (CG) (MZC) inhibits vaginal transmission of simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-RT in macaques, we evaluated safety and anti-SHIV-RT activity of MZC and related gel formulations ex vivo in macaque mucosal explants. In addition, safety was further evaluated in human ectocervical explants. The gels did not induce mucosal toxicity. A single ex vivo exposure to diluted MZC (1∶30, 1∶100) and MC (1∶30, the only dilution tested), but not to ZC gel, up to 4 days prior to viral challenge, significantly inhibited SHIV-RT infection in macaque vaginal mucosa. MZC's activity was not affected by seminal plasma. The antiviral activity of unformulated MIV-150 was not enhanced in the presence of ZA, suggesting that the antiviral activity of MZC was mediated predominantly by MIV-150. In vivo administration of MZC and CG significantly inhibited ex vivo SHIV-RT infection (51-62% inhibition relative to baselines) of vaginal (but not cervical) mucosa collected 24 h post last gel exposure, indicating  effect of CG. Although the inhibitory effect of MZC (65-74%) did not significantly differ from CG (32-45%), it was within the range of protection (∼75%) against vaginal SHIV-RT challenge 24 h after gel dosing. Overall, the data suggest that evaluation of candidate microbicides in macaque explants can inform macaque efficacy and clinical studies design.

Acetylsalicylic acid supplementation also improved ( < 0.001) amino acid utilization efficiency (as assessed by plasma urea level) and tended to decrease ( < 0.10) PGE production in the liver without affecting small intestinal histology and tight junction protein mRNA expression in the jejunal epithelium. Vitamin E supplementation greater than 100 IU/kg diet sustained both the plasma Vit E concentration ( < 0.001) and plasma haptoglobin content ( < 0.001) after weaning. However, there was no additive effects of the combined supplementation of ASA and Vit E on performance, intestinal   and inflammatory responses of weaned pigs.Although ASA and vitamin E improved amino acid utilization efficiency and reduced acute inflammatory responses, ASA and vitamin E did not additively reduce production of PGE and inflammatory responses in weaner pigs experimentally infected with an enterotoxigenic strain of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30354816>Prebiotics, Probiotics, and  Supplementation Prevent Hypertension in a Model of Obstructive Sleep Apnea.</a></h2><p>Disruption of the gut microbiota, termed gut dysbiosis, has been described in animal models of hypertension and hypertensive patients. We have shown that gut dysbiosis plays a causal role in the development of hypertension in a rat model of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Functional analysis of the dysbiotic microbiota in OSA demonstrates a loss of short chain fatty acid-producing bacteria. However, measurements of short chain fatty acid concentrations and testing of their role in blood pressure regulation are lacking. We hypothesized that reduced short chain fatty acids in the gut are responsible for OSA-induced hypertension. OSA significantly increased systolic blood pressure at 7 and 14 days ( P<0.05), an effect that was abolished by the probiotic Clostridium butyricum or the prebiotic Hylon VII. The 16S rRNA analysis identified several short chain fatty acid-producing bacteria that were significantly increased by Cbutyricum and Hylon treatment.  concentration in the cecum was decreased by 48% after OSA ( P<0.05), an effect that was prevented by Cbutyricum and Hylon. Cbutyricum and Hylon reduced OSA-induced dysbiosis, epithelial goblet cell loss, mucus  thinning, and activation of brain microglia ( P<0.05 for each). To examine the role of  in OSA-induced hypertension, we chronically infused  into the cecum during 2 weeks of sham or OSA. Restoring cecal  concentration prevented OSA-induced gut inflammation and hypertension ( P<0.05). These studies identify  as a key player in OSA-induced hypertension. We demonstrate that various methods to increase cecal  concentrations are protective from the adverse effects of OSA on the microbiota, gut, brain, and blood pressure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24070677>The internalization and lysosomal degradation of brain AQP4 after ischemic injury.</a></h2><p>The membrane-bound water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4) plays a significant role in maintaining brain water homeostasis. In ischemic brain, changes in the expression level of AQP4 have been reported. Previous studies suggest that the internalization of several membrane-bound proteins, including AQP4, may occur with or without lysosomal degradation. In this study, the internalization of AQP4 was detected in the ischemic rat brain via double immunofluorescence labeling. Specifically, AQP4 and early endosome antigen-1 (EEA1) co-localized after 1 h post-ischemic injury. Moreover, the co-expression of AQP4 and lysosomal-associated membrane protein-1 (LAMP1) was observed after 3 h post-ischemia. These findings suggest that AQP4 is internalized and the lysosome is involved in degrading the internalized AQP4 in the ischemic brain. AQP4 is known to be downregulated by the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) in vivo and in vitro. The results in this study displayed that PMA infusion could decrease brain edema accompanied by AQP4 downregulation in ischemic brain. However, compared with vehicle infusion, PKC activator infusion did not increase the ratio of internalized or lysosomal degraded AQP4. That is, we have not found out evidence to prove protein kinase C activator PMA can promote the internalization or lysosomal degradation of AQP4 in the ischemic brain.Crown Copyright © 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Separation was achieved using an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (50mm×2.1mm, particle size 1.7μm) with a gradient mobile phase consisting of water and methanol at a flow rate of 0.25ml/min. Detection was performed in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode using electrospray ionization (ESI) in the positive ion mode. The liquid-liquid extraction method with ethyl  was used for both pretreatment of plasma and brain homogenates. The calibration curves of chlorbipram showed good linearity over the concentration range of 0.5-200ng/ml (R(2)>0.994) for mouse plasma and over the range of 0.25-100ng/ml (R(2)>0.994) for mouse brain homogenate. The extraction recovery was in the range of 78.3-84.8% for chlorbipram and the internal standard (IS) ZXI14 in two different biological matrices. The intra- and inter-day precision values were less than 13.0% and the accuracy ranged from 97.8% to 106.0% for quality control samples. No noteworthy matrix effects and instability were observed for chlorbipram. This validated method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study of chlorbipram in mice after intravenous administration. The results show that this novel drug crosses the blood-brain  and provides the basis for further studies on chlorbipram.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To test whether this influences tumour formation, we chemically induced tumours in EPI-/- mice, which lack three  proteins-Envoplakin, Periplakin, and Involucrin. EPI-/- mice were highly resistant to developing benign tumours when treated with 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA). The DMBA response was normal, but EPI-/- skin exhibited an exaggerated atopic response to TPA, characterised by abnormal epidermal differentiation, a complex immune infiltrate and elevated serum thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). The exacerbated TPA response could be normalised by blocking TSLP or the immunoreceptor NKG2D but not CD4+ T cells. We conclude that atopy is protective against skin cancer in our experimental model and that the mechanism involves keratinocytes communicating with cells of the immune system via signalling elements that normally protect against environmental assaults.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01888.001.Copyright © 2014, Cipolat et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29327435>Impact of dietary induced precocious gut maturation on cecal microbiota and its relation to the blood-brain  during the postnatal period in rats.</a></h2><p>Precocious maturation of the gastrointestinal  (GIB) in newborn mammals can be induced by dietary provocation, but how this affects the gut microbiota and the gut-brain axis remains unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate effects of induced GIB maturation on gut microbiota composition and blood-brain  (BBB) permeability.Suckling rats were studied at 72 h after gavage with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or microbial protease (PT) to induce maturation of GIB. For comparison, untreated suckling and weaned rats were included (n = 10). Human serum albumin (HSA) was administered orally and analyzed in blood to assess permeability of the GIB, while intraperitoneally injected bovine serum albumin (BSA) was measured in the brain tissue for BBB permeability. The cecal microbial composition, plasma lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) levels and short-chain fatty acids in serum and brain were analyzed.Cessation of HSA passage to blood after PHA or PT treatment was similar to that seen in weaned rats. Interestingly, concomitant increases in cecal Bacteroidetes and plasma LBP levels were observed after both PHA and PT treatments. The BBB passage of BSA was surprisingly elevated after weaning, coinciding with lower plasma LBP levels and specific microbial taxa and increased  uptake into the brain.This study provides evidence that the gut microbiota alteration following induced precocious GIB maturation may induce low-grade systemic inflammation and alter SCFAs utilization in the brain which may also play a potential role in GIB-BBB dysfunction disorders in neonates.© 2018 The Authors.

The FGT is composed of upper and lower parts, distinct in their morphological and functional characteristics. Co-factors in the genital microenvironment, such as presence of hormones, semen, and other sexually transmitted infections, can facilitate or deter HIV infection and play a critical role in determining susceptibility to HIV. In this review, we examine some of these co-factors and their potential influence. Presence of physical and chemical barriers such as epithelial tight junctions, mucus, and anti-microbial peptides can actively block and inhibit viral replication, presenting a significant deterrent to HIV. Upon exposure, HIV and other pathogens first encounter the genital epithelium: cells that express a wide repertoire of pattern recognition receptors that can recognize and directly initiate innate immune responses. These and other interactions in the genital tract can lead to direct and indirect inflammation and enhance the number of local target cells, immune activation, and microbial translocation, all of which promote HIV infection and replication. Better understanding of the dynamics of HIV transmission in the female genital tract would be invaluable for improving the design of prophylactic strategies against HIV.© 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

In this organism, the catabolism of pentose sugars such as arabinose depends on the interaction of the pentose phosphate pathway with the Embden-Myerhoff and Entner-Doudoroff pathways. Although the values for H yield have been determined using pentose-supplemented complex medium and predicted by metabolic pathway reconstruction, the actual effect of pathway elimination on hydrogen production has not been reported due to the lack of a genetic method for the creation of targeted mutations. Here, a spontaneous and genetically stable pyrE deletion mutant was isolated and used as a recipient to refine transformation methods for its repair by homologous recombination. To verify the occurrence of recombination and to assess the frequency of crossover events flanking the deleted region, a synthetic pyrE allele, encoding synonymous nucleotide substitutions, was used. Targeted inactivation of araA (encoding arabinose isomerase) in the pyrE mutant was accomplished using a divergent, codon-optimized Thermosipho africanus pyrE allele fused to the T. maritima groES promoter as a genetic marker. Mutants lacking araA were unable to catabolize arabinose in a defined medium. The araA mutation was then repaired using targeted recombination. Levels of synthesis of H using arabinose-supplemented complex medium by wild-type and araA mutant cell lines were compared. The difference between strains provided a direct measurement of H production that was dependent on arabinose consumption. Development of a targeted recombination system for genetic manipulation of T. maritima provides a new strategy to explore H formation and life at an extremely high temperature in the bacterial domain.We describe here the development of a genetic system for manipulation of Thermotoga maritima T. maritima is a hyperthermophilic anaerobic bacterium that is well known for its efficient synthesis of molecular hydrogen (H) from the fermentation of sugars. Despite considerable efforts to advance compatible genetic methods, chromosome manipulation has remained elusive and hindered use of T. maritima or its close relatives as model hyperthermophiles. Lack of a genetic method also prevented efforts to manipulate specific metabolic pathways to measure their contributions to H yield. To overcome this , a homologous chromosomal recombination method was developed and used to characterize the contribution of arabinose catabolism to H formation. We report here a stable genetic method for a hyperthermophilic bacterium that will advance studies on the basic and synthetic biology of Thermotogales.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31546582>Protective Effect of Probiotic Bacteria and Estrogen in Preventing HIV-1-Mediated Impairment of Epithelial  Integrity in Female Genital Tract.</a></h2><p>Approximately 40% of global HIV-1 transmission occurs in the female genital tract (FGT) through heterosexual transmission. Epithelial cells lining the FGT provide the first  to HIV-1 entry. Previous studies have suggested that certain hormonal contraceptives or a dysbiosis of the vaginal microbiota can enhance HIV-1 acquisition in the FGT. We examined the effects of lactobacilli and female sex hormones on the  functions and innate immune responses of primary endometrial genital epithelial cells (GECs). Two probiotic strains,  RC-14 and  GR-1, were tested, as were sex hormones estrogen (E2), progesterone (P4), and the hormonal contraceptive medroxyprogesterone  (MPA). Our results demonstrate that probiotic lactobacilli enhance   without affecting cytokines. Treatment of GECs with MPA resulted in reduced  . In contrast, E2 treatment enhanced   and reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines. Comparison of hormones plus lactobacilli as a pre-treatment prior to HIV exposure revealed a dominant effect of lactobacilli in preventing loss of   by GECs. In summary, the combination of E2 and lactobacilli had the best protective effect against HIV-1 seen by enhancement of   and reduction in proinflammatory cytokines.

Unfortunately, the high volatility of WHO-approved organophosphate alternatives, e.g. malathion, translates into an early loss of residual efficacy. This laboratory study explored the concept of trilayer films as potential wall or ceiling linings. In the proposed design, the fugitive liquid insecticide is trapped in an inner core layer. The two sheath layers act as low-permeability membranes controlling the release of the insecticide. The concept was explored using poly(ethylene-co-vinyl ) (EVA) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) as core and sheath polymers respectively. The polarity of the EVA polymer matrix allowed incorporation of substantial quantities (up to 30 wt%) of malathion. The low polarity of the LDPE provided the necessary  properties and, in addition, allowed film blowing to be conducted at relatively low processing temperatures. Trilayer films containing about 6 wt% malathion were prepared on a film blowing line. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the trilayer film structure. Confocal Raman microscopy studies revealed a malathion concentration gradient across the thickness of the polyethylene layers. Mass loss measurements and FTIR spectroscopy studies showed that the malathion release followed first-order kinetics. Bioassays, on samples aged at 22 °C, indicated that the residual efficacy against mosquitoes can be maintained for up to about six months. This suggests that trilayer films impregnated with organophosphates, may have potential as alternative mosquito control interventions in pyrethroid resistant settings.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Results were restricted to systematic reviews, randomized control trials/controlled clinical trials, and observational studies published in English from January 1994 to January 2015. Searches were updated on a regular basis and incorporated in the guideline to June 2015. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology-related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, clinical trial registries, and national and international medical specialty societies.The quality of the evidence in this document was rated using the criteria described in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (Table). Chapter 1: Contraception in Canada Summary Statements  1. Canadian women spend a significant portion of their lives at risk of an unintended pregnancy. (II-2)  2. Effective contraceptive methods are underutilized in Canada, particularly among vulnerable populations. (II-2)  3. Long-acting reversible contraceptive methods, including contraceptive implants and intrauterine contraception (copper-releasing and levonorgestrel-releasing devices/systems), are the most effective reversible contraceptive methods and have the highest continuation rates. (II-1)  4. Canada currently does not collect reliable data to determine the use of contraceptive methods, abortion rates, and the prevalence of unintended pregnancy among reproductive-age women. (II-2)  5. A universal subsidy for contraceptive methods as provided by many of Canada's peer nations and a few Canadian provinces may produce health system cost-savings. (II-2)  6. Health Canada approval processes for contraceptives have been less efficient than those of other drug approval agencies and Health Canada processes for other classes of pharmaceuticals. (II-2)  7. It is feasible and safe for contraceptives and family planning services to be provided by appropriately trained allied health professionals such as midwives, registered nurses, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists. (II-2) Recommendations 1. Contraceptive counselling should include a discussion of typical use failure rates and the importance of using the contraceptive method consistently and correctly in order to avoid pregnancy. (II-2A) 2. Women seeking contraception should be counselled on the wide range of effective methods of contraception available, including long-acting reversible contraceptive methods (LARCs). LARCs are the most effective methods of reversible contraception, have high continuation rates, and should be considered when presenting contraceptive options to any woman of reproductive age. (II-2A) 3. Family planning counselling should include counselling on the decline of fertility associated with increasing female age. (III-A) 4. Health policy supporting a universal contraception subsidy and strategies to promote the uptake of highly effective methods as cost-saving measures that improve health and health equity should be considered by Canadian health decision makers. (III-B) 5. Canadian health jurisdictions should consider expanding the scope of practice of other trained professionals such as nurses, nurse practitioners, midwives, and pharmacists and promoting task-sharing in family planning. (II-2B) 6. The Canadian Community Health Survey should include adequate reproductive health indicators in order for health care providers and policy makers to make appropriate decisions regarding reproductive health policies and services in Canada. (III-B) 7. Health Canada processes and policies should be reviewed to ensure a wide range of modern contraceptive methods are available to Canadian women. (III-B) Chapter 2: Contraceptive Care and Access Summary Statements  8. Although there are many contraceptive options in Canada, only a narrow range of contraceptive methods are commonly used by those of reproductive age. (II-3)  9. Condom use decreases with longer relationship tenure and when the sexual partner is considered to be the main partner, likely due to a lower perceived risk of sexually transmitted infection in that relationship. Condom use may also decrease markedly as an unintended consequence when an effective non- method, such as hormonal contraception or intrauterine contraception, is initiated. (II-3) 10. Family planning counselling provides a natural segue into screening for concerns about sexual  or intimate partner violence. (III) 11. Well-informed and well-motivated individuals who have developed skills to practise safer sex behaviours are more likely to use contraceptive and safer sex methods effectively and consistently. (II-2) Recommendations 8. Comprehensive family planning services, including abortion services, should be accessible to all Canadians regardless of geographic location. These services should be confidential, non-judgemental, and respectful of individuals' privacy and cultural contexts. (III-A) 9. A contraceptive visit should include history taking, screening for contraindications, dispensing or prescribing a method of contraception, and exploring contraceptive choice and adherence in the broader context of the individual's sexual behaviour, reproductive health risk, social circumstances, and relevant belief systems. (III-B) 10. Health care providers should provide practical information on the wide range of contraceptive options and their potential non-contraceptive benefits and assist women and their partners in determining the best user-method fit. (III-B) 11. Health care providers should assist women and men in developing the skills necessary to negotiate the use of contraception and the correct and consistent use of a chosen method. (III-B) 12. Contraceptive care should include discussion and management of the risk of sexually transmitted infection, including appropriate recommendations for condom use and dual protection, STI screening, post-exposure prophylaxis, and Hepatitis B and human papillomavirus vaccination. (III-B) 13. Health care providers should emphasize the use of condoms not only for protection against sexually transmitted infection, but also as a back-up method when adherence to a hormonal contraceptive may be suboptimal. (I-A) 14. Health care providers should be aware of current media controversies in reproductive health and acquire relevant evidence-based information that can be briefly and directly communicated to their patients. (III-B) 15. Referral resources for intimate partner violence, sexually transmitted infections, sexual dysfunction, induced abortion services, and child protection services should be available to help clinicians provide contraceptive care in the broader context of women's health. (III-B) Chapter 3: Emergency Contraception Summary Statements 12. The copper intrauterine device is the most effective method of emergency contraception. (II-2) 13. A copper intrauterine device can be used for emergency contraception up to 7 days after unprotected intercourse provided that pregnancy has been ruled out and there are no other contraindications to its insertion. (II-2) 14. Levonorgestrel emergency contraception is effective up to 5 days (120 hours) after intercourse; its effectiveness decreases as the time between unprotected intercourse and ingestion increases. (II-2) 15. Ulipristal  for emergency contraception is more effective than levonorgestrel emergency contraception up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse. This difference in effectiveness is more pronounced as the time from unprotected intercourse increases, especially after 72 hours. (I) 16. Hormonal emergency contraception (levonorgestrel emergency contraception and ulipristal  for emergency contraception) is not effective if taken on the day of ovulation or after ovulation. (II-2) 17. Levonorgestrel emergency contraception may be less effective in women with a body mass index > 25 kg/m2 and ulipristal  for emergency contraception may be less effective in women with a body mass index > 35 kg/m2. However, hormonal emergency contraception may still retain some effectiveness regardless of a woman's body weight or body mass index. (II-2) 18. Hormonal emergency contraception is associated with higher failure rates when women continue to have subsequent unprotected intercourse. (II-2) 19. Hormonal contraception can be initiated the day of or the day following the use of levonorgestrel emergency contraception, with back-up contraception used for the first 7 days. (III) 20. Hormonal contraception can be initiated 5 days following the use of ulipristal  for emergency contraception, with back-up contraception used for the first 14 days. (III) Recommendations 16. All emergency contraception should be initiated as soon as possible after unprotected intercourse. (II-2A) 17. Women should be informed that the copper intrauterine device (IUD) is the most effective method of emergency contraception and can be used by any woman with no contraindications to IUD use.

Recognition that the androgen receptor (AR) axis continues to drive disease progression has led to the development of several AR-directed approved agents, including abiraterone  and enzalutamide. An investigational agent, darolutamide (ODM-201, BAY-1841788), has completed early-phase clinical trials, and two global phase III trials are currently accruing patients. Areas covered: The unmet clinical need, pharmacokinetics, preclinical development, and clinical efficacy and safety of darolutamide for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer are reviewed. The design of two ongoing phase III trials (ARAMIS and ARASENS) of darolutamide in men with non-metastatic CRPC and metastatic HSPC, respectively, are also discussed. Expert opinion: Darolutamide is an oral, investigational, high-affinity AR antagonist which has activity against known AR mutants that confer resistance to other second-generation antiandrogens, has minimal blood-brain  penetration, and does not significantly increase serum testosterone. These features may offer potential advantages over the second-generation antiandrogens. In the phase I/II ARADES trial, darolutamide demonstrated promising antitumor activity and a favorable safety profile in men with metastatic CRPC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28804104>α-Cyperone Inhibits PMA-Induced EPCR Shedding through PKC Pathway.</a></h2><p>α-Cyperone, a sesquiterpene compound represents 25.23% of the total oil and is the most abundant compound in Cyperus rotundus oil. Endothelial cell protein C receptor (EPCR) is a main member in protein C (PC) anti-coagulation system. EPCR could be shed from cell surface, and is mediated by tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme (TACE). Nothing that EPCR is a marker of vascular  integrity in vascular inflammatory disease and takes part in systemic inflammatory disease. In this study, we investigated whether α-cyperone could inhibit EPCR shedding. To observe the effect, we investigated this issue by detection the effect of α-cyperone on phorbol-12-myristate 13- (PMA)-induced EPCR shedding in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The cells were pretreated with α-cyperone for 12 h, and then stimulated by PMA for 1 h. The solute EPCR (sEPCR) and expression of membrane EPCR (mEPCR) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot. The mRNA, protein level and activity of TACE were tested by quantitative (q)RT-PCR, Western blot and InnoZyme TACE activity assay kit. Furthermore, we measured the protein level of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and protein kinase C (PKC) pathway under this condition by Western blot. The results showed that α-cyperone could suppress PMA-induced EPCR shedding through inhibiting the expression and activity of TACE. In addition, α-cyperone could inhibit PKC translocation, but not have an effect on phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 and extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) 1/2. Given these results, α-cyperone inhibits PMA-induced EPCR shedding through PKC pathway, which will provide an experimental basis for further research on α-cyperone.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26351284>The Candida albicans ATO Gene Family Promotes Neutralization of the Macrophage Phagolysosome.</a></h2><p>Candida albicans is an opportunistic human fungal pathogen that causes a variety of diseases, ranging from superficial mucosal to life-threatening systemic infections, the latter particularly in patients with defects in innate immune . C. albicans cells phagocytosed by macrophages undergo a dramatic change in their metabolism in which amino acids are a key nutrient. We have shown that amino acid catabolism allows the cell to neutralize the phagolysosome and initiate hyphal growth. We show here that members of the 10-gene ATO family, which are induced by phagocytosis or the presence of amino acids in an Stp2-dependent manner and encode putative  or ammonia transporters, are important effectors of this pH change in vitro and in macrophages. When grown with amino acids as the sole carbon source, the deletion of ATO5 or the expression of a dominant-negative ATO1(G53D) allele results in a delay in alkalinization, a defect in hyphal formation, and a reduction in the amount of ammonia released from the cell. These strains also form fewer hyphae after phagocytosis, have a reduced ability to escape macrophages, and reside in more acidic phagolysosomal compartments than wild-type cells. Furthermore, overexpression of many of the 10 ATO genes accelerates ammonia release, and an ato5Δ ATO1(G53D) double mutant strain has additive alkalinization and ammonia release defects. Taken together, these results indicate that the Ato protein family is a key mediator of the metabolic changes that allow C. albicans to overcome the macrophage innate immunity .Copyright © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

In contrast to the well-characterized role of TJs in maintaining cerebrovascular integrity, the specific  of endothelial podosomes remains unknown. Intriguingly, we discovered cross-talk between podosomes and TJs in human brain endothelial cells. Tight junction scaffold proteins ZO-1 and ZO-2 localize at podosomes in response to phorbol-12-myristate-13- treatment. We found that both ZO proteins are essential for podosome formation and . Rather than being derived from new protein synthesis, podosomal ZO-1 and ZO-2 are relocated from a pre-existing pool found at the peripheral plasma membrane with enhanced physical interaction with cortactin, a known protein marker for podosomes. Sequestration of ZO proteins in podosomes weakens tight junction complex formation, leading to increased endothelial cell permeability.

This study proposes a novel approach to enhance the adaptability of anammox granules to heavy metal [Zn(II)] shock by organic carbon (sodium , NaAc) treatment, paying special attention to optimization of the treatment dosage and duration. For granules treated with 200 mg chemical oxygen demand (COD)/L NaAc for 2 d, the activity recovery (six cycles) efficiency after Zn(II) (40 mg/L) shock reached 127.4%. The extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) production increased by 168% and heterotrophic bacteria mildly proliferated (increased by 14%) in such granules compared with the control. The dramatic recovery capacity was likely due to the entrapment and   of EPS and the outer-layer proliferated heterotrophic bacteria. This finding offers a useful process to enable maximum adaptability of anammox granules from heavy metals shocks, allowing anammox technology to be more widely applied.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Nonetheless, when dysfunctional, QECs contribute to multiple diseases. Previously, we demonstrated that proliferating endothelial cells (PECs) use fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) for de novo dNTP synthesis. We report now that QECs are not hypometabolic, but upregulate FAO >3-fold higher than PECs, not to support biomass or energy production but to sustain the tricarboxylic acid cycle for redox homeostasis through NADPH regeneration. Hence, endothelial loss of FAO-controlling CPT1A in CPT1A mice promotes EC dysfunction (leukocyte infiltration,  disruption) by increasing endothelial oxidative stress, rendering CPT1A mice more susceptible to LPS and inflammatory bowel disease. Mechanistically, Notch1 orchestrates the use of FAO for redox balance in QECs. Supplementation of  (metabolized to acetyl-coenzyme A) restores endothelial quiescence and counters oxidative stress-mediated EC dysfunction in CPT1A mice, offering therapeutic opportunities. Thus, QECs use FAO for vasculoprotection against oxidative stress-prone exposure.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, with aging of the population and the high incidence of diabetes, hypertension and obesity, this trend may prevail. An important cytoprotective enzyme that has been shown to improve renal  is heme-oxygenase (HO). HO is known to abate apoptosis and necrosis, and improves cell vitality, which in turn, may enhance tissue regeneration. Consistently, HO has been shown to restore tissue morphology by potentiating potentiate proteins of repair/regeneration and promoting neovascularization. The formation of new tissue may replace damaged or dysfunctional tissue to preserve cellular integrity and  after injury. Emerging evidence indicate that HO-inducers improve kidney  in several models including, (i) streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, (ii) Zucker-diabetic-fatty rats, (iii) Zucker-fatty rats, (iii) spontaneously hypertensive rats, (iv) uninephrectomized deoxycorticosterone- hypertensive rats, (v) N(ω)-nitro-l-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME)-induced hypertensive rats, (vi) glycerol induced renal failure, (vii) nephrotoxic nephritis, (viii) sepsis-induced kidney injury, (ix) cystic renal disease, (x) cisplatin-mediated acute kidney injury, and (xi) rhabdomyolysis-induced renal injury. The mechanisms underlying the HO-mediated reno-protection include: (i) the restoration of renal morphology by enhancing proteins of regeneration, (ii) the potentiation of the HO-adiponectin-atrial natriuretic peptide axis, with corresponding suppression of oxidative/inflammatory insults and extracellular matrix/profibrotic factors, and (iii) the potentiation of podocyte cytoskeletal proteins such as nephrin, podocin, podocalyxin and CD2-associated-protein, which are fundamental for forming the glomerular filtration  that selectively allows small molecules to pass through but not large protein molecules. Thus, this review highlights the HO-adiponectin-atrial natriuretic peptide axis in renoprotection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24160248>Skin repair properties of d-Limonene and perillyl alcohol in murine models.</a></h2><p>The orange-peel derived terpene d-Limonene, probably through its metabolite, perillyl alcohol (POH), has been reported to have tissue-repair properties. Two murine models of respectively 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA)-induced dermatitis and mechanical skin lesion were used here to assess the efficacy of d-Limonene or POH applied topically. Macroscopic and microscopic evaluation of skin lesions was performed as well as that of P-selectin expression, together with measurements of serum concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in the first model. Healing and angiogenesis around the scar were examined in the second model. Because differences in angiogenesis were noted, the effect of both d-Limonene and POH was further tested on an in vitro model of endothelial microtubules formation. Both d-Limonene and POH reduced the severity and extension of TPA-induced skin lesions with significantly lowered macroscopic and microscopic scores (p<0.04 in both cases). Moreover, the expression of P-selectin induced by TPA was abrogated by POH and significantly lower serum concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-α were observed in d-Limonene- and POH-treated mice (p<0.04 and 0.03). In the second model, tissue regeneration was improved, especially by POH, and was clearly associated with reduced neovascularization. This surprising anti-angiogenic effect was confirmed in the matrigel model of endothelial microtubules formation. These studies show that d-Limonene and POH demonstrate significant anti-inflammatory effects in murine dermal inflammation and wound-healing. The decreased systemic cytokine production as well as a consistent inhibition of endothelial P-selectin expression and neo-vascularization induced by these terpenic compounds contribute to their healing effects on the epidermal .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27285923>The effect of monensin concentration on dry matter intake, ruminal fermentation, short-chain fatty acid absorption, total tract digestibility, and total gastrointestinal   in beef heifers.</a></h2><p>In a 4 × 4 Latin square design (24-d periods), 4 ruminally cannulated Hereford × Angus/Simmental heifers were used to evaluate the effect of increasing levels of monensin concentration on DMI, ruminal fermentation, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) absorption across the reticulorumen, and total tract  . Heifers were fed a barley-based finishing diet (76% rolled barley grain, 12% barley silage, 8% mineral and vitamin supplement, and 4% canola meal) containing 0, 22, 33 or 48 mg/kg monensin. Urinary recovery of Cr-EDTA was used as an indicator of total tract   (d 18 to 20). Days 20 to 23 were used to evaluate ruminal fermentation and total tract digestibility measurements, and SCFA absorption was measured using the temporarily isolated and washed reticulorumen technique on d 24. Data were analyzed using PROC MIXED of SAS with linear and quadratic contrasts to evaluate the effect of increasing monensin dose. Increasing monensin linearly decreased DMI (10.0, 9.9, 9.3, and 9.1 kg/d for diets containing 0, 22, 33 or 48 mg/kg monensin, respectively; = 0.01) but did not affect the variation in DMI among days. Urinary Cr-EDTA recovery was not ( ≥ 0. 61) affected by increasing dose of monensin, nor was ruminal pH (mean, minimum, maximum, duration less than 5.5, and area under curve; ≥ 0.21). The -to-propionate ratio linearly decreased (1.9, 1.8, 1.4, and 1.3 for diets containing 0, 22, 33 or 48 mg/kg monensin, respectively; = 0.03) with increasing monensin. There was no response ( ≥ 0. 17) for the rate of SCFA absorption with monensin concentration.

MUC2 deficiency results in impaired epithelial  , imbalance in gut microbiota, and spontaneous colitis. Probiotics have been shown to have a protective effect against colitis. In this study we used Muc2 mucin-deficient (Muc2) and Muc2 littermates to test whether the probiotic mixture VSL#3 requires an intact mucin  to exert its beneficial effect. VSL#3 alone reduced basal colonic proinflammatory cytokine levels and improved epithelial   in Muc2 animals. Similarly, in dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis, VSL#3 dampened the proinflammatory chemokines KC, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 and upregulated the tissue regeneration growth factors transforming growth factor-β, fibroblast growth factor-1, and vascular endothelial growth factor-A, which accelerated resolution of colitis symptoms in Muc2 animals. Importantly, improved colonic health in VSL#3-treated animals was associated with attenuated reactive oxygen species production by peritoneal macrophages, restoration of antimicrobial peptide gene expression in the small intestine, and increased abundance of bacterial commensals in the gut. The beneficial effects of VSL#3 in Muc2 animals were mediated by , an important short-chain fatty acid produced by gut bacteria. These studies provide evidence for the first time that VSL#3 can enhance epithelial   by dampening the proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine response, accelerating restitution, and altering commensal microbiota in the absence of a functional mucus .It is unclear whether probiotics require an intact mucin  to first colonize and/or exert their protective functions. In this study we used mucin-deficient (Muc2) mice to interrogate if the multispecies probiotic mixture VSL#3 could enhance epithelial  .

Results were restricted to systematic reviews, randomized control trials/controlled clinical trials, and observational studies published in English from January 1994 to January 2015. Searches were updated on a regular basis and incorporated in the guideline to June 2015. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology-related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, clinical trial registries, and national and international medical specialty societies.The quality of the evidence in this document was rated using the criteria described in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (Table). Chapter 1: Contraception in Canada Summary Statements 1. Canadian women spend a significant portion of their lives at risk of an unintended pregnancy. (II-2) 2. Effective contraceptive methods are underutilized in Canada, particularly among vulnerable populations. (II-2) 3. Long-acting reversible contraceptive methods, including contraceptive implants and intrauterine contraception (copper-releasing and levonorgestrel-releasing devices/systems), are the most effective reversible contraceptive methods and have the highest continuation rates. (II-1) 4. Canada currently does not collect reliable data to determine the use of contraceptive methods, abortion rates, and the prevalence of unintended pregnancy among reproductive-age women. (II-2) 5. A universal subsidy for contraceptive methods as provided by many of Canada's peer nations and a few Canadian provinces may produce health system cost-savings. (II-2) 6. Health Canada approval processes for contraceptives have been less efficient than those of other drug approval agencies and Health Canada processes for other classes of pharmaceuticals. (II-2) 7. It is feasible and safe for contraceptives and family planning services to be provided by appropriately trained allied health professionals such as midwives, registered nurses, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists. (II-2) Recommendations 1. Contraceptive counselling should include a discussion of typical use failure rates and the importance of using the contraceptive method consistently and correctly in order to avoid pregnancy. (II-2A) 2. Women seeking contraception should be counselled on the wide range of effective methods of contraception available, including long-acting reversible contraceptive methods (LARCs). LARCs are the most effective methods of reversible contraception, have high continuation rates, and should be considered when presenting contraceptive options to any woman of reproductive age. (II-2A) 3. Family planning counselling should include counselling on the decline of fertility associated with increasing female age. (III-A) 4. Health policy supporting a universal contraception subsidy and strategies to promote the uptake of highly effective methods as cost-saving measures that improve health and health equity should be considered by Canadian health decision makers. (III-B) 5. Canadian health jurisdictions should consider expanding the scope of practice of other trained professionals such as nurses, nurse practitioners, midwives, and pharmacists and promoting task-sharing in family planning. (II-2B) 6. The Canadian Community Health Survey should include adequate reproductive health indicators in order for health care providers and policy makers to make appropriate decisions regarding reproductive health policies and services in Canada. (III-B) 7. Health Canada processes and policies should be reviewed to ensure a wide range of modern contraceptive methods are available to Canadian women. (III-B) Chapter 2: Contraceptive Care and Access Summary Statements 8. Although there are many contraceptive options in Canada, only a narrow range of contraceptive methods are commonly used by those of reproductive age. (II-3) 9. Condom use decreases with longer relationship tenure and when the sexual partner is considered to be the main partner, likely due to a lower perceived risk of sexually transmitted infection in that relationship. Condom use may also decrease markedly as an unintended consequence when an effective non- method, such as hormonal contraception or intrauterine contraception, is initiated. (II-3) 10. Family planning counselling provides a natural segue into screening for concerns about sexual  or intimate partner violence. (III) 11. Well-informed and well-motivated individuals who have developed skills to practise safer sex behaviours are more likely to use contraceptive and safer sex methods effectively and consistently. (II-2) Recommendations 8. Comprehensive family planning services, including abortion services, should be accessible to all Canadians regardless of geographic location. These services should be confidential, non-judgemental, and respectful of individuals' privacy and cultural contexts. (III-A) 9. A contraceptive visit should include history taking, screening for contraindications, dispensing or prescribing a method of contraception, and exploring contraceptive choice and adherence in the broader context of the individual's sexual behaviour, reproductive health risk, social circumstances, and relevant belief systems. (III-B) 10. Health care providers should provide practical information on the wide range of contraceptive options and their potential non-contraceptive benefits and assist women and their partners in determining the best user-method fit. (III-B) 11. Health care providers should assist women and men in developing the skills necessary to negotiate the use of contraception and the correct and consistent use of a chosen method. (III-B) 12. Contraceptive care should include discussion and management of the risk of sexually transmitted infection, including appropriate recommendations for condom use and dual protection, STI screening, post-exposure prophylaxis, and Hepatitis B and human papillomavirus vaccination. (III-B) 13. Health care providers should emphasize the use of condoms not only for protection against sexually transmitted infection, but also as a back-up method when adherence to a hormonal contraceptive may be suboptimal. (I-A) 14. Health care providers should be aware of current media controversies in reproductive health and acquire relevant evidence-based information that can be briefly and directly communicated to their patients. (III-B) 15. Referral resources for intimate partner violence, sexually transmitted infections, sexual dysfunction, induced abortion services, and child protection services should be available to help clinicians provide contraceptive care in the broader context of women's health. (III-B) Chapter 3: Emergency Contraception Summary Statements 12. The copper intrauterine device is the most effective method of emergency contraception. (II-2) 13. A copper intrauterine device can be used for emergency contraception up to 7 days after unprotected intercourse provided that pregnancy has been ruled out and there are no other contraindications to its insertion. (II-2) 14. Levonorgestrel emergency contraception is effective up to 5 days (120 hours) after intercourse; its effectiveness decreases as the time between unprotected intercourse and ingestion increases. (II-2) 15. Ulipristal  for emergency contraception is more effective than levonorgestrel emergency contraception up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse. This difference in effectiveness is more pronounced as the time from unprotected intercourse increases, especially after 72 hours. (I) 16. Hormonal emergency contraception (levonorgestrel emergency contraception and ulipristal  for emergency contraception) is not effective if taken on the day of ovulation or after ovulation. (II-2) 17. Levonorgestrel emergency contraception may be less effective in women with a body mass index > 25 kg/m2 and ulipristal  for emergency contraception may be less effective in women with a body mass index > 35 kg/m2. However, hormonal emergency contraception may still retain some effectiveness regardless of a woman's body weight or body mass index. (II-2) 18. Hormonal emergency contraception is associated with higher failure rates when women continue to have subsequent unprotected intercourse. (II-2) 19. Hormonal contraception can be initiated the day of or the day following the use of levonorgestrel emergency contraception, with back-up contraception used for the first 7 days. (III) 20. Hormonal contraception can be initiated 5 days following the use of ulipristal  for emergency contraception, with back-up contraception used for the first 14 days. (III) Recommendations 16. All emergency contraception should be initiated as soon as possible after unprotected intercourse. (II-2A) 17. Women should be informed that the copper intrauterine device (IUD) is the most effective method of emergency contraception and can be used by any woman with no contraindications to IUD use.

However, its heterogeneity is the major  to efficient conversion to biofuels. MSW paper mix was generated and blended with corn stover (CS). It has been shown that both of them can be efficiently pretreated in certain ionic liquids (ILs) with high yields of fermentable sugars. After pretreatment in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium  ([C2C1Im][OAc]), over 80% glucose has been released with enzymatic saccharification. We have also applied an enzyme-free process by adding mineral acid and water directly into the IL/biomass slurry to induce hydrolysis. With the acidolysis process in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([C2C1Im]Cl), up to 80% glucose and 90% xylose are released. There is a correlation between the viscosity profile and hydrolysis efficiency; low viscosity of the hydrolysate generally corresponds to high sugar yields. Overall, the results indicate the feasibility of incorporating MSW as a robust blending agent for biorefineries.Copyright © 2015.

Recent advances in this field reveal a possible relationship between the compositional pattern of gut microbiota and genesis of obesity. Several study results have shown that short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs, microbiota-induced fermentation products) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS, an integral component of Gram negative microorganisms) play the key role in linking the two. Though several SCFAs are produced as microbiota-fermentation products, three of them, i.e., butyrate, propionate and  have been found to be definitely involved in obesity; though individually they are neither purely obesogenic nor antiobesogenic. Out of these, butyrate and propionate are predominantly antiobesogenic. Butyrate, though a major energy source for colonocytes, has been found to increase mitochondrial activity, prevent metabolic endotoxemia, improve insulin sensitivity, possess anti-inflammatory potential, increase intestinal   and protect against diet-induced obesity without causing hypophagia. Propionate has been found to inhibit cholesterol synthesis, thereby antagonizing the cholesterol increasing action of , and to inhibit the expression of resistin in adipocytes. Moreover, both these SCFAs have been found to cause weight regulation through their stimulatory effect on anorexigenic gut hormones and to increase the synthesis of leptin. Unlike butyrate and propionate, , which is substantially absorbed, shows more obesogenic potential, as it acts as a substrate for hepatic and adipocyte lipogenesis. High fat diet increases the absorption of LPS, which, in turn, has been found to be associated with metabolic endotoxemia and to induce inflammation resulting in obesity. Multiple independent and interrelated mechanisms have been found to be involved in such linking processes which are discussed in this review work along with some possible remedial measures for prevention of weight gain and obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27371732>Phospholipase C-ε signaling mediates endothelial cell inflammation and  disruption in acute lung injury.</a></h2><p>Phospholipase C-ε (PLC-ε) is a unique PLC isoform that can be regulated by multiple signaling inputs from both Ras family GTPases and heterotrimeric G proteins and has primary sites of expression in the heart and lung. Whereas the role of PLC-ε in cardiac  and pathology has been documented, its relevance in acute lung injury (ALI) is unclear. We used PLC-ε(-/-) mice to address the role of PLC-ε in regulating lung vascular inflammation and injury in an aerosolized bacterial LPS inhalation mouse model of ALI. PLC-ε(-/-) mice showed a marked decrease in LPS-induced proinflammatory mediators (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, macrophage inflammatory protein 2, keratinocyte-derived cytokine, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor), lung neutrophil infiltration and microvascular leakage, and loss of VE-cadherin compared with PLC-ε(+/+) mice. These data identify PLC-ε as a critical determinant of proinflammatory and leaky phenotype of the lung. To test the possibility that PLC-ε activity in endothelial cells (EC) could contribute to ALI, we determined its role in EC inflammation and  disruption. RNAi knockdown of PLC-ε inhibited NF-κB activity in response to diverse proinflammatory stimuli, thrombin, LPS, TNF-α, and the nonreceptor agonist phorbol 13-myristate 12- (phorbol esters) in EC. Depletion of PLC-ε also inhibited thrombin-induced expression of NF-κB target gene, VCAM-1. Importantly, PLC-ε knockdown also protected against thrombin-induced EC  disruption by inhibiting the loss of VE-cadherin at adherens junctions and formation of actin stress fibers. These data identify PLC-ε as a novel regulator of EC inflammation and permeability and show a hitherto unknown role of PLC-ε in the pathogenesis of ALI.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29515566>The Metabolic Sensor GPR43 Receptor Plays a Role in the Control of  Infection in the Lung.</a></h2><p>Pneumonia is one of the leading causes of death and mortality worldwide. The inflammatory responses that follow respiratory infections are protective leading to pathogen clearance but can also be deleterious if unregulated. The microbiota is known to be an important protective  against infections, mediating both direct inhibitory effects against the potential pathogen and also regulating the immune responses contributing to a proper clearance of the pathogen and return to homeostasis. GPR43 is one receptor for , a microbiota metabolite shown to induce and to regulate important immune functions. Here, we addressed the role of GPR43 signaling during pulmonary bacterial infections. We have shown for the first time that the absence of GPR43 leads to increased susceptibility to  infection, which was associated to both uncontrolled proliferation of bacteria and to increased inflammatory response. Mechanistically, we showed that GPR43 expression especially in neutrophils and alveolar macrophages is important for bacterial phagocytosis and killing. In addition, treatment with the GPR43 ligand, , is protective during bacterial lung infection. This was associated to reduction in the number of bacteria in the airways and to the control of the inflammatory responses. Altogether, GPR43 plays an important role in the "gut-lung axis" as a sensor of the host gut microbiota activity through  binding promoting a proper immune response in the lungs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26482935>Anti-inflammatory effects of vicenin-2 and scolymoside in vitro and in vivo.</a></h2><p>Two structurally related flavonoids found in Cyclopia subternata, namely vicenin-2 and scolymoside, were examined for its effects on inflammatory responses by monitoring the effects of vicenin-2 and scolymoside on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated vascular inflammatory responses.The anti-inflammatory activities of vicenin-2 and scolymoside were determined by measuring permeability,monocytes adhesion and migration, and activation of pro-inflammatory proteins in LPS-activated HUVECs and mice.We found that post-treatment of each compound inhibited LPS-induced  disruption, expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), and adhesion/transendothelial migration of human neutrophils to human endothelial cells.

We hypothesized that interference with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ in smooth muscle would augment myogenic responses in cerebral arteries. We studied transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative mutation in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ selectively in smooth muscle (S-P467L) and nontransgenic littermates. Myogenic tone in middle cerebral arteries from S-P467L was elevated 3-fold when compared with nontransgenic littermates. Rho kinase is thought to play a major role in cerebrovascular disease. The Rho kinase inhibitor, Y-27632, abolished augmented myogenic tone in middle cerebral arteries from S-P467L mice. CN-03, which modifies RhoA making it constitutively active, elevated myogenic tone to ≈60% in both strains, via a Y-27632-dependent mechanism. Large conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels (BKCa) modulate myogenic tone. Inhibitors of BKCa caused greater constriction in middle cerebral arteries from nontransgenic littermates when compared with S-P467L. Expression of RhoA or Rho kinase-I/II protein was similar in cerebral arteries from S-P467L mice. Overall, the data suggest that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ in smooth muscle normally inhibits Rho kinase and promotes BKCa , thus influencing myogenic tone in resistance arteries in brain. These findings have implications for mechanisms that underlie large- and small-vessel disease in brain, as well as regulation of cerebral blood flow.© 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25993513>Studying the effects of reproductive hormones and bacterial vaginosis on the glycome of lavage samples from the cervicovaginal cavity.</a></h2><p>The cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) coating the vaginal epithelium is an important immunological mediator, providing a  to infection. Glycosylation of CVF proteins, such as mucins, IgG and S-IgA, plays a critical role in their immunological functions. Although multiple factors, such as hormones and microflora, may influence glycosylation of the CVF, few studies have examined their impact on this important immunological fluid. Herein we analyzed the glycosylation of cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) samples collected from 165 women under different hormonal conditions including: (1) no contraceptive, post-menopausal, (2) no contraceptive, days 1-14 of the menstrual cycle, (3) no contraceptive, days 15-28 of the menstrual cycle, (4) combined-oral contraceptive pills for at least 6 months, (5) depo-medroxyprogesterone  (Depo-Provera) injections for at least 6 months, (6) levonorgestrel IUD for at least 1 month. Glycomic profiling was obtained using our lectin microarray system, a rapid method to analyze carbohydrate composition. Although some small effects were observed due to hormone levels, the major influence on the glycome was the presence of an altered bacterial cohort due to bacterial vaginosis (BV). Compared to normal women, samples from women with BV contained lower levels of sialic acid and high-mannose glycans in their CVL. The change in high mannose levels was unexpected and may be related to the increased risk of HIV-infection observed in women with BV, as high mannose receptors are a viral entry pathway. Changes in the glycome were also observed with hormonal contraceptive use, in a contraceptive-dependent manner. Overall, microflora had a greater impact on the glycome than hormonal levels, and both of these effects should be more closely examined in future studies given the importance of glycans in the innate immune system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24144481>Lead exposure results in hearing loss and disruption of the cochlear blood-labyrinth  and the protective role of iron supplement.</a></h2><p>This study was designed to investigate the impact of lead (Pb(2+)) on the auditory system and its molecular mechanisms. Pb(AC)2 was administrated to male SD rats aged 21-22 d for 8 weeks at a dose of 300ppm. Male guinea pigs were also administrated with 50mg/kg Pb(AC)2 two times a week for 8 weeks. The auditory nerve-brainstem evoked responses (ABR) was recorded and the morphological changes of the outer hair cells (OHCs) were observed with Phallodin-FITC staining. In addition, the integrity of the blood-labyrinth  was observed by TEM and the expression of tight junction proteins (TJPs) in the cochlear stria vascularis was determined by immunofluorescence. Our results showed that Pb(2+) exposure resulted in increased ABR threshold in both rats and guinea pigs. Abnormal shapes and loss of OHCs were found in the cochlear basilar membrane following the Pb(2+) exposure. TEM study showed that the tight junctions between the endothelial cells and the border cells were lost and disrupted. Down-regulation of the occludin, ZO-1 and claudin-5 in the stria vascularis suggested that the increased permeability of the blood-labyrinth  may attribute to the Pb(2+)-induced decrease of TJPs' expression. Additionally, Fe(2+) supplement partly reversed the Pb(2+)-induced hearing loss and down-regulation of TJPs. Taken together, these data indicate that the disruption of blood-labyrinth  by down-regulating the expression of TJPs plays a role in the Pb(2+)-induced hearing loss, and Fe(2+) supplement protects the auditory system against Pb(2+)-induced toxicity and may have significant clinical implications.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This low pH, in turn, is thought to damage epithelial  . The present study applied a model of simulated ruminal acidosis ex vivo to investigate if SCFA directly contribute to epithelial  failure beyond their role as proton donors. Epithelial tissues from the rumen of slaughtered sheep were mounted in Ussing chambers and incubated under 3 different conditions. Two groups were incubated in the absence of SCFA at mucosal pH 6.1 (control) and pH 5.1, respectively, for 7 h. A third group was first incubated in a mucosal solution containing 100 mM SCFA at pH 5.1 for 2 h and, thereafter, in a mucosal solution without SCFA at pH 6.1 for the remaining 5 h. Transepithelial conductance (G), short-circuit current (I), and fluorescein fluxes were determined. After 7 h of incubation, the expression levels of claudin-1, claudin-4, claudin-7, and occludin were measured by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR and Western blot. Furthermore, the local distribution of these tight junction (TJ) proteins was examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy. A 7-h incubation at pH 5.1 in the absence of SCFA did not influence either G or fluorescein flux rates of ruminal tissues ex vivo compared with the control. In contrast, incubation at pH 5.1 with SCFA for only 2 h induced increases in G and fluorescein flux rates that continued even after tissues were returned back to pH 6.1. Expression analysis showed that pH 5.1 without SCFA for 7 h induced no changes in mRNA expression of claudin-1, claudin-4, claudin-7, and occludin and a selective decrease in protein expression of only claudin-4 compared with the control. However, a 2-h incubation at pH 5.1 in the presence of SCFA decreased the mRNA-expression of claudin-7, as well as the protein expression of claudin-4, claudin-7, and occludin. The decreased expression of these TJ proteins in the group incubated with SCFA was also evident in immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry additionally evidenced a considerable retraction of all tested TJ proteins out of the TJ in that group. We conclude that a low mucosal pH of 5.1 is tolerated well by ruminal epithelia for several hours. However, a low pH in combination with SCFA induces damage to the TJ and disturbs  , which is not immediately reversible upon the removal of the acidotic insult.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.

The signalling mechanisms involved in the dephosphorylation of eNOS have not yet been clarified. This study identifies myosin phosphatase (MP) holoenzyme consisting of protein phosphatase-1 catalytic subunit (PP1c) and MP target subunit-1 (MYPT1) as an eNOS phosphatase. In support of this finding are: (i) eNOS and MYPT1 interacts in various endothelial cells (ECs) and in in vitro binding assays (ii) MYPT1 targets and stimulates PP1c toward eNOS substrate (iii) phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr696 (MYPT1) controls the activity of MP on eNOS. Phosphatase inhibition suppresses both NO production and transendothelial resistance (TER) of ECs. In contrast, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) signals ECs via the 67 kDa laminin-receptor (67LR) resulting in protein kinase A dependent activation of protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A). PP2A dephosphorylates MYPT1 and thereby stimulates MP activity inducing dephosphorylation of eNOS and the 20 kDa myosin II light chains. Thus an interplay of MP and PP2A is involved in the physiological regulation of EC functions implying that an EGCG dependent activation of these phosphatases leads to enhanced NO production and EC  improvement.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26156414>Therapeutic Impact of Sphingosine 1-phosphate Receptor Signaling in Multiple Sclerosis.</a></h2><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a female predominant autoimmune demyelinating disease of central nervous system. The proper etiology is not clear. The existing therapies with interferon beta (Betaseron, Rebif), glatiramer  (copolymer 1, copaxone) are found to be promising for MS patients. The alpha-4 integrin antagonist monoclonal antibody Natalizumab has been found to decrease brain inflammation in relapsing-remitting MS via inhibition of alpha-4 beta- 1 integrinmediated mode of action of antigen -primed T cells to enter into central nervous system through blood brain . The advancement of drug development introduced prospects of CD52 monoclonal antibody Alemtuzumab and CD20 monoclonal antibody Rituximab in MS therapy. The benefit versus risk ratios of these therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are currently under clinical trial. The ongoing researches demonstrated the importance of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor statins, NF-κBp65 inhibitor NBD peptide, and antagonist of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), animal model for MS. Recently, the clinical trials indicated the therapeutic prospect of G-protein coupled sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) in MS patients. Recent studies showed remyelination through selective activation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. In the context, role of S1PR-mediated signals following interaction with natural ligand S1P and agonist Fingolimod (FTY720) gain profound therapeutic importance in prevention of demyelination in MS brain. The S1PR agonist Fingolimod (FTY 720) has recently been approved by Food and Drug Administration for MS therapy. In the review, we provided an insight on S1PR mode of action in the aspect of treatment of autoimmune disorder, re-myelination and regeneration of axons in damaged central nervous system in multiple sclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26809801>Potassium  Blocks Clostridium difficile Toxin A-Induced Microtubule Disassembly by Directly Inhibiting Histone Deacetylase 6, Thereby Ameliorating Inflammatory Responses in the Gut.</a></h2><p>Clostridium difficile toxin A is known to cause deacetylation of tubulin proteins, which blocks microtubule formation and triggers  dysfunction in the gut. Based on our previous finding that the Clostridium difficile toxin A-dependent activation of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC-6) is responsible for tubulin deacetylation and subsequent microtubule disassembly, we herein examined the possible effect of potassium  (PA; whose acetyl group prevents the binding of tubulin to HDAC-6) as a competitive/false substrate. Our results revealed that PA inhibited toxin A-induced deacetylation of tubulin and recovered toxin A-induced microtubule disassembly. In addition, PA treatment significantly decreased the production of IL-6 (a marker of inflamed tissue) in the toxin A-induced mouse enteritis model. An in vitro HDAC assay revealed that PA directly inhibited HDAC-6-mediated tubulin deacetylation, indicating that PA acted as a false substrate for HDAC-6. These results collectively indicate that PA treatment inhibits HDAC-6, thereby reducing the cytotoxicity and inflammatory responses caused by C. difficile toxin A.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30011654>Cherry tomato supplementation increases the area of the intestinal mucosa and the number of muscle layers in rats.</a></h2><p>Tomatoes act as prebiotics in the gut. The effects of cherry tomatoes on gastrointestinal health have not yet been studied. Four cherry tomato supplementation diets (CTSDs) were prepared from the juice and cake of fresh and processed (heat-treated) cherry tomatoes. The contents of the gut and histological changes in the cecum and intestine were analyzed at 4weeks in rats fed CTSDs. The lactic acid bacteria level in fecal contents of rats fed CTSDs increased compared with the control. The gut length was longer in rats fed CTSDs than that in control animals. In addition, the cecal propionate level significantly increased (p<0.05), and  and butyrate levels decreased compared with control animals, however, regardless of the type of CTSD, the total concentration of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in all rats fed different CTSDs was similar with the control. The thicknesses of the mucosa and muscle of the cecum and colon increased in rats fed CTSDs compared with the control. CTSDs increased the area of the mucosa and the number of muscle layers in the intestine and cecum of rats, which strengthened the   and promoted gastrointestinal health.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we investigate the anti-inflammatory potential of SR1001, a synthetic RORα/γ inverse agonist, in mouse models of atopic dermatitis and acute irritant dermatitis. Topical treatment with SR1001 reduces epidermal and dermal features of MC903-induced atopic dermatitis-like disease and suppresses the production of type 2 cytokines and other inflammatory mediators in lesional skin. In the epidermis, SR1001 treatment blocks MC903-induced expression of TSLP and reverses impaired keratinocyte differentiation. SR1001 is also effective in alleviating acute dermatitis triggered by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-. Overall, our results suggest that RORα/γ are important therapeutic targets for cutaneous inflammation and suggest topical usage of inhibitory ligands as an approach to treating skin diseases of inflammatory etiology.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

To achieve this, a PTX amorphous solid dispersion (ASD) was prepared by the solvent cast method. Among the enteric polymers tested, hypromellose  succinate (HPMCAS) MF was found to be the most suitable polymer for maintaining PTX supersaturation and inhibiting crystallization in vitro. The dissolution rate and extent of the ASD was remarkably improved compared with a physical mixture (PM) of PTX, HPMCAS-MF, and Poloxamer 188 (F68), reaching an apparent drug concentration of 25-30 μg/mL and maintaining it for more than 2 h. The liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) concentration of PTX in the presence of HPMCAS-MF was determined to be 23 μg/mL, which was different to that of 40 μg/mL in the absence of polymer. It indicated that HPMCAS was substantially incorporated into the drug-rich phase. Also, HPMCAS could absorb to the PTX surface and provided an interfacial  for crystal growth, as well as retard the incorporation of PTX from solution into the growing crystal lattice. The results of X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry analysis, and transmission electron microscopy confirmed that PTX existed in the amorphous state in the solid dispersion. Compared with the PM group, the ASD prepared with HPMCAS-MF and F68 achieved a 1.78-fold increase in relative oral bioavailability, while PTX solution yielded a 1.56-fold increase, which could be explained that the solubility and the permeability of PTX were not increased simultaneously through supersaturation in vivo. Likely, it was because Cremophor inhibited P-glycoprotein in the intestine to some extent and maintained PTX at a higher concentration for a longer time.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28148966>Endoplasmic reticulum stress inhibition attenuates hypertensive chronic kidney disease through reduction in proteinuria.</a></h2><p>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is implicated in chronic kidney disease (CKD) development in patients and in animal models. Here we show that ER stress inhibition through 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) administration decreases blood pressure, albuminuria, and tubular casts in an angiotensin II/deoxycorticosterone /salt murine model of CKD. Lower albuminuria in 4-PBA-treated mice was associated with higher levels of cubilin protein in renal tissue membrane fractions. 4-PBA decreased renal interstitial fibrosis, renal CD3 T-cell and macrophage infiltration, mRNA expression of TGFβ1, Wnt signaling molecules, and ER stress-induced pro-inflammatory genes. CHOP deficient mice that underwent this model of CKD developed hypertension comparable to wild type mice, but had less albuminuria and tubular casts. CHOP deficiency resulted in higher nephrin levels and decreased glomerulosclerosis compared to wild type mice; this effect was accompanied by lower macrophage infiltration and fibrosis. Our findings portray ER stress inhibition as a means to alleviate hypertensive CKD by preserving glomerular  integrity and tubular . These results demonstrate ER stress modulation as a novel target for preserving renal  in hypertensive CKD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30349136>Dietary fibers inhibit obesity in mice, but host responses in the cecum and liver appear unrelated to fiber-specific changes in cecal bacterial taxonomic composition.</a></h2><p>Dietary fibers (DF) can prevent obesity in rodents fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Their mode of action is not fully elucidated, but the gut microbiota have been implicated. This study aimed to identify the effects of seven dietary fibers (barley beta-glucan, apple pectin, inulin, inulin  ester, inulin propionate ester, inulin butyrate ester or a combination of inulin propionate ester and inulin butyrate ester) effective in preventing diet-induced obesity and links to differences in cecal bacteria and host gene expression. Mice (n = 12) were fed either a low-fat diet (LFD), HFD or a HFD supplemented with the DFs, barley beta-glucan, apple pectin, inulin, inulin  ester, inulin propionate ester, inulin butyrate ester or a combination of inulin propionate ester and inulin butyrate ester for 8 weeks. Cecal bacteria were determined by Illumina MiSeq sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Host responses, body composition, metabolic markers and gene transcription (cecum and liver) were assessed post intervention. HFD mice showed increased adiposity, while all of the DFs prevented weight gain. DF specific differences in cecal bacteria were observed. Results indicate that diverse DFs prevent weight gain on a HFD, despite giving rise to different cecal bacteria profiles. Conversely, common host responses to dietary fiber observed are predicted to be important in improving   and genome stability in the gut, maintaining energy homeostasis and reducing HFD induced inflammatory responses in the liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29019369>In situ generation of layered single- or double-hydroxide inorganic platelets (LSH and LDH) assisted by bola amphiphiles.</a></h2><p>A novel preparation route for layered hydroxide based hybrid phases has been investigated combining the polyol route with the in situ generation of inorganic platelets, in the presence of an amphiphilic polymer as well as bola-amphiphiles. The polyol route consists of hydrolysis in an alcoholic medium containing  metal cations as precursor(s), to yield an LDH ZnAl cation composition or LSH-Zn (layered single hydroxide). A bola amphiphile is described as hydrophobic polymer segment-telechelic-chains terminated by two anionic hydrophilic end groups, using volatile ammonium cations as counter ions. The impact of both process conditions as well as the chosen system with regard to the metal hydroxide framework on the morphology of the obtained hybrid phases is scrutinized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and compared to that of the corresponding physical mixture. For the ex situ approach, the diffusion of large cumbersome polymers or amphiphilic bolas between the inorganic platelets was found to be efficient, mostly driven by an anion exchange reaction between interleaved  anions and carboxylate functions of the molecular backbones, and keeping intact the inner sheet integrity through a topotactic process. In particular with LSH-Zn, a multi-stratified assembly has been observed combining an  pristine structure and a partly bola diffused structure, leading to a biphasic structure, aggregated and intercalated. To the best of our knowledge, observation of LSH-Zn single platelets has never been reported, making the combined process polyol/in situ an interesting new route to reach exfoliation. Indeed, it leads to the generation of either LSH or LDH platelets of lateral size ranging from 10 up to 200 nm. However, the platelets were found to be porous; it is considered as a drawback for barrier properties. It is our belief that such porosity may open new insights in "tectonic" architecture by intertwining 2D and 1D-type fillers. Rather counterintuitively, the ex situ approach based on a topotactic exchange reaction matches the in situ templating reaction in many cases as a function of the dispersion state regardless of the polymer or bolas as well as the platelet cation composition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28093351>In vitro uptake and transport studies of PEG-PLGA polymeric micelles in respiratory epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>Polymeric micelles are considered promising carriers for pulmonary drug delivery. Their interaction with the respiratory epithelium, however, is mostly unknown. In the present study, methoxypoly (ethylene glycol) (mPEG)-poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) micelles containing curcumin  (CA) or a mixture of CA and Nile Red (NR) were prepared using the solvent evaporation method. Calu-3 and NCI-H441 human respiratory epithelial cell monolayers were used as in vitro models of upper and lower respiratory tract epithelium , respectively, to study the cellular uptake and transport of the vesicles. The results show that Calu-3 and NCI-H441 cells internalized micellar particles and that micelles were able to translocate across the cell monolayers. Micelles were more readily internalized into and permeated across Calu-3 cell monolayers when compared to NCI-H441 cells. Furthermore, the presence of inhibitors of endocytic processes, such as methyl-β-cyclodextrin, NaN and hypertonic sucrose attenuated the cellular uptake and trafficking of micelles. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that mPEG-PLGA micelles translocate human respiratory epithelium in vitro through clathrin-, energy- and cholesterol-mediated endocytosis.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We assessed the gut-health-promoting potential of kidney beans in healthy mice and their ability to attenuate colonic inflammation following dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) exposure (via drinking water, 2% DSS w/v, 7 days). C57BL/6 mice were fed one of three isocaloric diets: basal diet control (BD), or BD supplemented with 20% cooked white (WK) or dark red kidney (DK) bean flour for 3 weeks. In healthy mice, anti-inflammatory microbial-derived cecal short chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels (, butyrate and propionate), colon crypt height and colonic Mucin 1 (MUC1) and Resistin-like Molecule beta (Relmβ) mRNA expression all increased in WK- and DK-fed mice compared to BD, indicative of enhanced microbial activity, gut  integrity and antimicrobial defense response. During colitis, both bean diets reduced (a) disease severity, (b) colonic histological damage and (c) increased mRNA expression of antimicrobial and  integrity-promoting genes (Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4), MUC1-3, Relmβ and Trefoil Factor 3 (TFF3)) and reduced proinflammatory mediator expression [interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, interferon (IFN)γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1], which correlated with reduced colon tissue protein levels. Further, bean diets exerted a systemic anti-inflammatory effect during colitis by reducing serum levels of IL-17A, IFNγ, TNFα, IL-1β and IL-6. In conclusion, both WK and DK bean-supplemented diets enhanced microbial-derived SCFA metabolite production, gut  integrity and the microbial defensive response in the healthy colon, which supported an anti-inflammatory phenotype during colitis. Collectively, these data demonstrate a beneficial colon- priming effect of bean consumption that mitigates colitis severity.Crown Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Biological samples were processed with ethyl  extraction. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and water (containing 10mM ammonium , adjusted with acetic acid to pH 4.25) with gradient elution at a flow rate of 0.4mL/min. Detection was performed on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer using positive ion ESI in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The calibration curves for all analytes had good linearity (r(2)>0.9910). The intra- and inter-day precisions (RSD) were within 13.9%, and accuracy (RE) was between -12.0% and 13.7%. This method was successfully applied to the pharmacokinetic and brain distribution study after administration of the extracts of YZ and CR. The pharmacokinetic study indicated that the AUC of plasma and brain increased, and the CL of the two matrixes decreased after administration of YZ when compared with CR (p<0.05).

Cholesterol and its derivatives control epidermal  integrity and are protective against environmental insults. To determine the role of the gene in skin cholesterol homeostasis, we applied 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA) to the skin of Tm7sf2(+/+) and Tm7sf2(-/-) mice. TPA increased skin cholesterol levels by inducing de novo synthesis and up-take only in Tm7sf2(+/+) mouse, confirming that the gene maintains cholesterol homeostasis under stress conditions. Cholesterol sulfate, one of the major players in skin permeability, was doubled by TPA treatment in the skin of wild-type animals but this response was lost in Tm7sf2(-/-) mice. The expression of markers of epidermal differentiation concomitant with farnesoid-X-receptor and p38 MAPK activation were also disrupted in Tm7sf2(-/-) mice. We then subjected Tm7sf2(+/+) and Tm7sf2(-/-) mice to a classical two-stage skin carcinogenesis protocol. We found that the loss of Tm7sf2 increased incidence and multiplicity of skin papillomas. Interestingly, the null genotype showed reduced expression of nur77, a gene associated with resistance to neoplastic transformation. In conclusion, the loss of Tm7sf2 alters the expression of proteins involved in epidermal differentiation by reducing the levels of cholesterol sulfate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25821957>Copolymer-1 promotes neurogenesis and improves functional recovery after acute ischemic stroke in rats.</a></h2><p>Stroke triggers a systemic inflammatory response that exacerbates the initial injury. Immunizing with peptides derived from CNS proteins can stimulate protective autoimmunity (PA). The most renowned of these peptides is copolymer-1 (Cop-1) also known as glatiramer . This peptide has been approved for use in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Cop-1-specific T cells cross the blood-brain  and secrete neurotrophins and anti-inflammatory cytokines that could stimulate proliferation of neural precursor cells and recruit them to the injury site; making it an ideal therapy for acute ischemic stroke. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of Cop-1 on neurogenesis and neurological recovery during the acute phase (7 days) and the chronic phase of stroke (60 days) in a rat model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAo). BDNF and NT-3 were quantified and infarct volumes were measured. We demonstrated that Cop-1 improves neurological deficit, enhances neurogenesis (at 7 and 60 days) in the SVZ, SGZ, and cerebral cortex through an increase in NT-3 production. It also decreased infarct volume even at the chronic phase of tMCAo. The present manuscript fortifies the support for the use of Cop-1 in acute ischemic stroke.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30272228>The response of ruminal fermentation, epithelium-associated microbiota, and epithelial   to severe feed restriction in pregnant ewes.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the changes in the ruminal fermentation, epithelium-associated microbiota, and ruminal epithelial   in response to severe feed restriction (SFR) in pregnant ewes. Sixteen pregnant ewes (108 d of gestation) were randomly blocked and assigned to 1 of 2 treatments: control (CON, n = 8) and SFR (n = 8). Ewes were fed a common diet with a 60:40 forage to concentrate ratio for 7-d baseline period followed by a SFR challenge period. Ewes on the SFR treatment were restricted to 30% of the base for 15 d. At the end of the experimental period, all animals were slaughtered and then ruminal contents and ruminal epithelial tissue were collected. Results showed that ruminal pH was greater in SFR group (P = 0.040) compared with CON group, while SFR decreased (P < 0.05) the concentrations of ruminal , propionate, butyrate, and total volatile fatty acid. A plot of principal coordinate analysis and analysis of molecular variance revealed that the composition of ruminal epithelial bacterial communities in the CON group was distinct from that of the ruminal epithelial microbiome in the SFR animals. At the genus level, SFR increased the abundance of unclassified Neisseriaceae, Comamonas, and Papillibacter, and decreased the proportion of Howardella, Desulfobulbus, and Suttonella (P < 0.05) compared with CON group. The metagenome of ruminal epithelium-associated microbiota predicted by PICRUSt revealed that the SFR significantly affected 14 metabolic pathways, and 9 were significantly enriched in the SFR group. In particular, SFR markedly increased relative abundances of dominant gene families involved in amino acid metabolism (P = 0.003), cellular processes and signaling (P = 0.021), and lipid metabolism (P = 0.001). The real-time PCR results showed SFR decreased the mRNA expression of IL-10 (P = 0.003) and upregulated the mRNA expression of IL-6 (P = 0.003) and TLR4 (P = 0.021). The mRNA expression of Claudin-1 (P = 0.001) and ZO-1 (P = 0.009) were lower in the SFR group compared with the CON group. Generally, our data suggest that SFR decreased most ruminal fermentation parameters, altered the composition of rumen epithelium-associated microbiota, and compromised the   of rumen epithelium. These findings are of great importance for understanding the alteration in the rumen  following SFR in pregnant ewes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26005885>Attenuation of lead neurotoxicity by supplementation of polyunsaturated fatty acid in Wistar rats.</a></h2><p>Among various types of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), omega-3 fatty acids play a crucial role in development and  of the brain. This study was undertaken to investigate the possible neuroprotective efficacy of omega-3 fatty acid on lead-induced neurotoxicity in rats.The experiment was carried out on 32 male Wistar rats divided into four groups. The first group (control) was treated with distilled water and second group with lead  at the doses of 3 mg/kg b.wt. (body weight)/oral, whereas third and fourth groups were simultaneously treated with lead  (3 mg/kg b.wt.) plus omega-3 fatty acid (300 mg/kg b.wt./oral) and lead  (3 mg/kg b.wt.) plus vitamin E (100 mg/kg b.wt./oral), respectively, for a period of 90 days. Their biochemical and histopathological investigations have been carried out.The level of lead was markedly elevated in brain (4.71-fold) and blood (5.65-fold), also increased levels of ROS, GSH, LPO with concomitant reduction in the activities of delta-ALAD, CAT, SOD, and GPx. In addition, lead-induced brain damage was indicated by histopathological changes. Omega-3 fatty acid resulted in marked improvement in most of the biochemical parameters as well as histopathological changes in rats. The results obtained were compared with vitamin E as the standard antioxidant agents.Omega-3 fatty acid significantly (P < 0.05) decreased the effect of lead-induced brain damage as well as biochemical changes similar to that of standard drug, vitamin E. So, our result suggested that omega-3 fatty acid may play a protective role in lead-induced neurotoxicity and associated human health risk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30915065>Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs)-Mediated Gut Epithelial and Immune Regulation and Its Relevance for Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.</a></h2><p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), collectively known as Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), are caused by a complex interplay between genetic, immunologic, microbial and environmental factors. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome is increasingly considered to be causatively related to IBD and is strongly affected by components of a Western life style. Bacteria that ferment fibers and produce short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are typically reduced in mucosa and feces of patients with IBD, as compared to healthy individuals. SCFAs, such as , propionate and butyrate, are important metabolites in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Several studies have indeed shown that fecal SCFAs levels are reduced in active IBD. SCFAs are an important fuel for intestinal epithelial cells and are known to strengthen the gut  . Recent findings, however, show that SCFAs, and in particular butyrate, also have important immunomodulatory functions. Absorption of SCFAs is facilitated by substrate transporters like MCT1 and SMCT1 to promote cellular metabolism. Moreover, SCFAs may signal through cell surface G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), like GPR41, GPR43, and GPR109A, to activate signaling cascades that control immune functions. Transgenic mouse models support the key role of these GPCRs in controlling intestinal inflammation. Here, we present an overview of microbial SCFAs production and their effects on the intestinal mucosa with specific emphasis on their relevance for IBD. Moreover, we discuss the therapeutic potential of SCFAs for IBD, either applied directly or by stimulating SCFAs-producing bacteria through pre- or probiotic approaches.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24125684>In vitro model systems for studying the impact of organic chemicals on the skin  lipids.</a></h2><p>This paper describes two synthetic lipid models designed to replace human stratum corneum (SC) in studies of the impact of volatile organic chemicals on the molecular organization of the skin  lipids. The models built upon previously developed self-assembled lipid membranes which have composition and 3D organization similar to those of the lipid matrix in SC. In one model the target chemicals were incorporated in the lipids before their self-assembly, and in the other one they were applied on top of a preformed lipid membrane. The chemicals could be incorporated within the model membranes in quantities close to those reached within human SC upon heavy surface loading. The dose-dependent effects of the chemicals on the lateral molecular organization in the models were qualitatively identical to those observed by infrared spectroscopy in human SC. The models facilitated the interpretation of X-ray diffraction profiles used to determine the nature of the interactions between the chemicals and the lipid lamellae and the position of the exogenous molecules within the unit cell of the lipid phases. These model systems are suitable for in vitro studies in the areas of skin biophysics, dermatology, transdermal drug delivery, and risk assessment.© 2013.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30028571>Key Role of Lanthanum Oxychloride: Promotional Effects of Lanthanum in NiLaO /NaCl for Hydrogen Production from Ethyl  and Water.</a></h2><p>The hydrogen economy is accelerating technological evolutions toward highly efficient hydrogen production. In this work, the catalytic performance of NiO/NaCl for hydrogen production via autothermal reforming of ethyl  and water is further improved through lanthanum modification, and the resulted 3%-NiLaO /NaCl catalyst achieves as high as 93% H selectivity and long-term stability at 600 °C. The promoting effect is caused by the strong interactions between lanthanum and NiO/NaCl, by which LaNiO and a novel LaOCl phase are formed. The key role of LaOCl in promoting low-temperature hydrogen production is highlighted, while effects of LaNiO are well known. The LaOCl (010) facet possesses high adsorption capacity toward co-chemisorbing ethyl  and water. LaOCl strongly interacts with ethyl  and H O in the form of hydrogen bonding and coordination effect. The interactions induce tensions inside ethyl  and H O, activate the molecules, and hence decrease the energy  for reaction. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) reveals that LaOCl along with NaCl enhances the adsorption ability of NiO/NaCl. Moreover, LaOCl improves the dispersion of Ni species in NiO-LaNiO -LaOCl nanosheets, which possess abundant active sites. The effects together promote hydrogen evolution. Furthermore, the NiLaO /NaCl catalyst can be easily reborn after deactivation due to the water solubility of NaCl.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Previous data also indicates that incubating an extract of endophyte-infected tall fescue seed causes an increase in the amount of VFA absorbed per unit of blood flow, which could result from an alteration in the absorptive or   of the rumen epithelium. An experiment was conducted to determine the acute effects of an endophyte-infected tall fescue seed extract (EXT) on total, passive or facilitated  and butyrate flux across the isolated bovine rumen as well as the   measured by inulin flux and tissue conductance (G t ). Flux of ergovaline across the rumen epithelium was also evaluated. Rumen tissue from the caudal dorsal sac of Holstein steers (n=6), fed a common diet, was collected and isolated shortly after slaughter and mounted between two halves of Ussing chambers. In vitro treatments included vehicle control (80% methanol, 0.5% of total volume), Low EXT (50 ng ergovaline/ml) and High EXT (250 ng ergovaline/ml). Results indicate that there is no effect of acute exposure to ergot alkaloids on total, passive or facilitated flux of  or butyrate across the isolate bovine rumen epithelium (P>0.51). Inulin flux (P=0.16) and G t (P>0.17) were not affected by EXT treatment, indicating no alteration in   due to acute ergot alkaloid exposure. Ergovaline was detected in the serosal buffer of the High EXT treatment indicating that the flux rate is ~0.25 to 0.44 ng/cm2 per hour. Data indicate that specific pathways for VFA absorption and   of the rumen epithelium are not affected by acute exposure to ergot alkaloids from tall fescue at the concentrations tested. Ergovaline has the potential to be absorbed from the rumen of cattle that could contribute to reduced blood flow and motility and lead to reduced growth rates of cattle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24128398>Enhancement of Taihu blue algae anaerobic digestion efficiency by natural storage.</a></h2><p>Taihu blue algae after different storage time from 0 to 60 d were anaerobic fermented to evaluate their digestibility and process stability. Results showed that anaerobic digestion (AD) of blue algae under 15 d natural storage led to the highest CH4 production of 287.6 mL g(-1) VS at inoculum substrate ratio 2.0, demonstrating 36.69% improvement comparing with that from fresh algae. Storage of blue algae led to cell death, microcystins (MCs) release and VS reduction by spontaneous fermentation. However, it also played an important role in removing algal cell wall , pre-hydrolysis and pre-acidification, leading to the improvement in CH4 yield. Closer examination of volatile fatty acids (VFA) variation, VS removal rates and key enzymes change during AD proved short storage time (≤ 15 d) of blue algae had higher efficiencies in biodegradation and methanation. Furthermore, AD presented significant biodegradation potential for MCs released from Taihu blue algae.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Indeed, inherited or acquired up-regulation of TRPC6 activities are suggested to play a role in podocytopathies. Yet, we possess limited information about the regulation of TRPC6 in human podocytes. Therefore, in this study, we aimed at defining how the protein kinase C (PKC) system, one of the key intracellular signalling pathways, regulates TRPC6  and expression. On human differentiated podocytes, we identified the molecular expressions of both TRPC6 and several PKC isoforms. We also showed that TRPC6 channels are functional since the TRPC6 activator 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) induced Ca(2+) -influx to the cells. By assessing the regulatory roles of the PKCs, we found that inhibitors of the endogenous activities of classical and novel PKC isoforms markedly augmented TRPC6 activities. In contrast, activation of the PKC system by phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) exerted inhibitory actions on TRPC6 and suppressed its expression. Importantly, PMA treatment markedly down-regulated the expression levels of PKCα, PKCβ, and PKCη reflecting their activation. Taken together, these results indicate that the PKC system exhibits a 'tonic' inhibition on TRPC6 activity in human podocytes suggesting that pathological conditions altering the expression and/or activation patterns of podocyte-expressed PKCs may influence TRPC6 activity and hence podocyte functions. Therefore, it is proposed that targeted manipulation of certain PKC isoforms might be beneficial in certain proteinuric kidney diseases with altered TRPC6 functions.© 2015 The Authors.

We examined whether immunity in women using injectable depot medroxyprogesterone  (DMPA), combined oral contraceptives (COC), or no HCs differs by the presence of cervicovaginal infections. Immune mediators were quantified in cervical swabs from 832 HIV-uninfected reproductive-age Ugandans and Zimbabweans. Bacterial infections and HIV were diagnosed by PCR, genital herpes serostatus by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), altered microflora by Nugent score, and Trichomonas vaginalis and Candida albicans infection by wet mount. Generalized linear models utilizing Box-Cox-Power transformation examined associations between levels of mediators, infection status, and HCs. In no-HC users, T. vaginalis was associated with broadest spectrum of aberrant immunity (higher interleukin 1β [IL-1β], IL-8, macrophage inflammatory protein 3α [MIP-3α], β-defensin 2 [BD2], and IL-1 receptor antigen [IL-1RA]). In women with a normal Nugent score and no genital infection, compared to the no-HC group, COC users showed higher levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1RA, while DMPA users showed higher levels of RANTES and lower levels of BD2, both associated with HIV seroconversion. These effects of COC were blunted in the presence of gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, candidiasis, and an abnormal Nugent score; however, RANTES was increased among COC users with herpes, chlamydia, and abnormal Nugent scores. The effect of DMPA was exacerbated by lower levels of IL-1RA in gonorrhea, chlamydia, or herpes, SLPI in gonorrhea, and IL-1β, MIP-3α, and IL-1RA/IL1β ratio in trichomoniasis. Thus, the effects of HC on cervical immunity depend on the genital tract microenvironment, and a weakened mucosal  against HIV may be a combined resultant of genital tract infections and HC use.In this article, we show that in young reproductive-age women most vulnerable to HIV, hormonal contraceptives are associated with altered cervical immunity in a manner dependent on the presence of genital tract infections. Through altered immunity, hormones may predispose women to bacterial and viral pathogens; conversely, a preexisting specific infection or disturbed vaginal microbiota may suppress the immune activation by levonorgestrel or exacerbate the suppressed immunity by DMPA, thus increasing HIV risk by their cumulative action. Clinical studies assessing the effects of contraception on HIV susceptibility and mucosal immunity may generate disparate results in populations that differ by microbiota background or prevalence of undiagnosed genital tract infections. A high prevalence of asymptomatic infections among HC users that remain undiagnosed and untreated raises even more concerns in light of their combined effects on biomarkers of HIV risk. The molecular mechanisms of the vaginal microbiome's simultaneous interactions with hormones and HIV remain to be elucidated.Copyright © 2015 Fichorova et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24359447>Strong, low- hydrogen bonds may be available to enzymes.</a></h2><p>The debate over the possible role of strong, low- hydrogen bonds in stabilizing reaction intermediates at enzyme active sites has taken place in the absence of an awareness of the upper limits to the strengths of low- hydrogen bonds involving amino acid side chains. Hydrogen bonds exhibit their maximal strengths in isolation, i.e., in the gas phase. In this work, we measured the ionic hydrogen bond strengths of three enzymatically relevant model systems in the gas phase using anion photoelectron spectroscopy; we calibrated these against the hydrogen bond strength of HF2(-), measured using the same technique, and we compared our results with other gas-phase experimental data. The model systems studied here, the formate-formic acid, -acetic acid, and imidazolide-imidazole anionic complexes, all exhibit very strong hydrogen bonds, whose strengths compare favorably with that of the hydrogen bifluoride anion, the strongest known hydrogen bond. The hydrogen bond strengths of these gas-phase complexes are stronger than those typically estimated as being required to stabilize enzymatic intermediates. If there were to be enzyme active site environments that can facilitate the retention of a significant fraction of the strengths of these isolated (gas-phase), hydrogen bonded couples, then low- hydrogen bonding interactions might well play important roles in enzymatic catalysis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27983793>Enhanced Brain Delivery of Dimethyl Fumarate Employing Tocopherol--Based Nanolipidic Carriers: Evidence from Pharmacokinetic, Biodistribution, and Cellular Uptake Studies.</a></h2><p>Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is an approved drug for the management of relapsing multiple sclerosis. Despite efficacy, DMF is also reported to be a challenging drug owing to concerns like gastrointestinal tract flushing, multiple dosing, lower brain permeability, less patient compliance, and economic hurdles. The present study aims to develop DMF-tocopherol  nanolipidic carrier (NLCs) to enhance brain permeability and improve the gastric tolerance. The developed DMF-tocopherol  NLCs offered an average size of 69.70 nm, PDI of 0.317, and a zeta potential of -9.71 mV. Higher drug entrapment (90.12%) and drug loading (20.13%) assured controlled drug release behavior both in gastric and intestinal pH. Cellular uptake studies on Caco-2 and SH-SY5Y monolayers confirmed better intestinal absorption and neuronal uptake of the developed system, which was further corroborated by the pharmacokinetic and biodistribution studies. The oral bioavailability was enhanced by 4.09 times and brain availability was substantially improved vis-à-vis plain drug. The findings are promising and offer preclinical evidence for better brain availability of DMF, which can be exploited in the better management of diseases like multiple sclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24936444>Hyperglycaemia promotes human brain microvascular endothelial cell apoptosis via induction of protein kinase C-ßI and prooxidant enzyme NADPH oxidase.</a></h2><p>Blood-brain  disruption represents a key feature in hyperglycaemia-aggravated cerebral damage after an ischaemic stroke. Although the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown, activation of protein kinase C (PKC) is thought to play a critical role. This study examined whether apoptosis of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) might contribute to hyperglycaemia-evoked  damage and assessed the specific role of PKC in this phenomenon. Treatments with hyperglycaemia (25 mM) or phorbol myristate  (PMA, a protein kinase C activator, 100 nM) significantly increased NADPH oxidase activity, O2 (•-) generation, proapoptotic protein Bax expression, TUNEL-positive staining and caspase-3/7 activities. Pharmacological inhibition of NADPH oxidase, PKC-a, PKC-ß or PKC-ßI via their specific inhibitors and neutralisation of O2 (•-) by a cell-permeable superoxide dismutase mimetic, MnTBAP normalised all the aforementioned increases induced by hyperglycaemia. Suppression of these PKC isoforms also negated the stimulatory effects of hyperglycaemia on the protein expression of NADPH oxidase membrane-bound components, Nox2 and p22-phox which determine the overall enzymatic activity. Silencing of PKC-ßI gene through use of specific siRNAs abolished the effects of both hyperglycaemia and PMA on endothelial cell NADPH oxidase activity, O2 (•-) production and apoptosis and consequently improved the integrity and  of an in vitro model of human cerebral  comprising HBMEC, astrocytes and pericytes. Hyperglycaemia-mediated apoptosis of HBMEC contributes to cerebral  dysfunction and is modulated by sequential activations of PKC-ßI and NADPH oxidase.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26527183>Immune cell trafficking across the barriers of the central nervous system in multiple sclerosis and stroke.</a></h2><p>Each year about 650,000 Europeans die from stroke and a similar number lives with the sequelae of multiple sclerosis (MS). Stroke and MS differ in their etiology. Although cause and likewise clinical presentation set the two diseases apart, they share common downstream mechanisms that lead to damage and recovery. Demyelination and axonal injury are characteristics of MS but are also observed in stroke. Conversely, hallmarks of stroke, such as vascular impairment and neurodegeneration, are found in MS. However, the most conspicuous common feature is the marked neuroinflammatory response, marked by glia cell activation and immune cell influx. In MS and stroke the blood-brain  is disrupted allowing bone marrow-derived macrophages to invade the brain in support of the resident microglia. In addition, there is a massive invasion of auto-reactive T-cells into the brain of patients with MS. Though less pronounced a similar phenomenon is also found in ischemic lesions. Not surprisingly, the two diseases also resemble each other at the level of gene expression and the biosynthesis of other proinflammatory mediators. While MS has traditionally been considered to be an autoimmune neuroinflammatory disorder, the role of inflammation for cerebral ischemia has only been recognized later. In the case of MS the long track record as neuroinflammatory disease has paid off with respect to treatment options. There are now about a dozen of approved drugs for the treatment of MS that specifically target neuroinflammation by modulating the immune system. Interestingly, experimental work demonstrated that drugs that are in routine use to mitigate neuroinflammation in MS may also work in stroke models. Examples include Fingolimod, glatiramer , and antibodies blocking the leukocyte integrin VLA-4. Moreover, therapeutic strategies that were discovered in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of MS, turned out to be also effective in experimental stroke models. This suggests that previous achievements in MS research may be relevant for stroke. Interestingly, the converse is equally true. Concepts on the neurovascular unit that were developed in a stroke context turned out to be applicable to neuroinflammatory research in MS. Examples include work on the important role of the vascular basement membrane and the BBB for the invasion of immune cells into the brain. Furthermore, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), the only established drug treatment in acute stroke, modulates the pathogenesis of MS. Endogenous tPA is released from endothelium and astroglia and acts on the BBB, microglia and other neuroinflammatory cells. Thus, the vascular perspective of stroke research provides important input into the mechanisms on how endothelial cells and the BBB regulate inflammation in MS, particularly the invasion of immune cells into the CNS. In the current review we will first discuss pathogenesis of both diseases and current treatment regimens and will provide a detailed overview on pathways of immune cell migration across the barriers of the CNS and the role of activated astrocytes in this process.

Twenty-one Holstein steers were fed for ad libitum intake for 5 d (control [CON]), fed at 25% of ad libitum intake for 5 d (LFI), or provided 2 d of ad libitum intake followed by 1-d of feed restriction (25% of ad libitum intake), 1 d where 30% of ad libitum dry matter intake (DMI) was provided as pelleted barley followed by the full allocation (RA) and fed for ad libitum intake the following day. Tissues and digesta from the rumen, omasum, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, proximal, and distal colon were collected. Permeability was assessed using the mucosal-to-serosal flux of inulin (JMS-inulin) and mannitol (JMS-mannitol). Digesta pH was 0.81, 0.63, and 0.42 pH units less for RA than CON in the rumen, cecum, and proximal colon; while, LFI had pH that was 0.47 and 0.36 pH units greater in the rumen and proximal colon compared to CON. Total ruminal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentration were less for LFI (92 mM; P = 0.010) and RA (87 mM; P = 0.007) than CON (172 mM) steers. In the proximal colon, the proportion of butyrate (P = 0.025 and P = 0.022) and isobutyrate (P = 0.019 and P = 0.019) were greater, and  (P = 0.028 and P = 0.028) was less for LFI and RA, respectively, when compared to CON steers. Ruminal papillae length, width, perimeter, and surface area were 1.21 mm, 0.78 mm, 3.84 mm, and 11.15 mm2 less for LFI than CON; while, RA decreased papillae width by 0.52 mm relative to CON. The JMS-mannitol was less for LFI steers than CON in the proximal colon (P = 0.041) and in the distal colon (P = 0.015). Increased gene expression for claudin 1, occludin, tight-cell junction protein 1 and 2, and toll-like receptor 4 were detected for LFI relative to CON in the rumen, jejunum, and proximal colon. For RA steers, expression of toll-like receptor 4 in the rumen, and occludin and tight-cell junction protein 1 were greater in the jejunum than CON. An acute RA challenge decreased pH in the rumen and large intestine but did not increase tissue permeability due to increases in the expression of genes related to   within 1 d of the challenge. Steers exposed to LFI for 5 d had reduced ruminal SCFA concentrations, smaller ruminal papillae dimensions, and increased tissue permeability in the proximal and distal colon despite increases for genes related to   and immune .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27793206>MOG-IgG in NMO and related disorders: a multicenter study of 50 patients.

Median age at onset was 31 years (range 6-70). The disease followed a multiphasic course in 80 % (median time-to-first-relapse 5 months; annualized relapse rate 0.92) and resulted in significant disability in 40 % (mean follow-up 75 ± 46.5 months), with severe visual impairment or functional blindness (36 %) and markedly impaired ambulation due to paresis or ataxia (25 %) as the most common long-term sequelae. Functional blindess in one or both eyes was noted during at least one ON attack in around 70 %. Perioptic enhancement was present in several patients. Besides acute tetra-/paraparesis, dysesthesia and pain were common in acute myelitis (70 %). Longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions were frequent, but short lesions occurred at least once in 44 %. Fourty-one percent had a history of simultaneous ON and myelitis. Clinical or radiological involvement of the brain, brainstem, or cerebellum was present in 50 %; extra-opticospinal symptoms included intractable nausea and vomiting and respiratory insufficiency (fatal in one). CSF pleocytosis (partly neutrophilic) was present in 70 %, oligoclonal bands in only 13 %, and blood-CSF- dysfunction in 32 %. Intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) and long-term immunosuppression were often effective; however, treatment failure leading to rapid accumulation of disability was noted in many patients as well as flare-ups after steroid withdrawal. Full recovery was achieved by plasma exchange in some cases, including after IVMP failure. Breakthrough attacks under azathioprine were linked to the drug-specific latency period and a lack of cotreatment with oral steroids. Methotrexate was effective in 5/6 patients. Interferon-beta was associated with ongoing or increasing disease activity. Rituximab and ofatumumab were effective in some patients. However, treatment with rituximab was followed by early relapses in several cases; end-of-dose relapses occurred 9-12 months after the first infusion. Coexisting autoimmunity was rare (9 %). Wingerchuk's 2006 and 2015 criteria for NMO(SD) and Barkhof and McDonald criteria for multiple sclerosis (MS) were met by 28 %, 32 %, 15 %, 33 %, respectively; MS had been suspected in 36 %. Disease onset or relapses were preceded by infection, vaccination, or pregnancy/delivery in several cases.Our findings from a predominantly Caucasian cohort strongly argue against the concept of MOG-IgG denoting a mild and usually monophasic variant of NMOSD. The predominantly relapsing and often severe disease course and the short median time to second attack support the use of prophylactic long-term treatments in patients with MOG-IgG-positive ON and/or myelitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30451726>Glycocalyx Degradation Is Independent of Vascular  Permeability Increase in Nontraumatic Hemorrhagic Shock in Rats.</a></h2><p>Glycocalyx shedding after traumatic hemorrhagic or septic shock, as well as different resuscitation fluids, has been causally linked to increased vascular  permeability (VBP) resulting in tissue edema. In nontraumatic hemorrhagic shock (NTHS), it remains questionable whether glycocalyx degradation in itself results in an alteration of VBP. The composition of fluids can also have a modulatory effect on glycocalyx shedding and VBP. We hypothesized that the shedding of the glycocalyx during NTHS has little effect on VBP and that the composition of fluids can modulate these effects.Fully instrumented Wistar-albino rats were subjected to a pressure-controlled NTHS (mean arterial pressure of 30 mm Hg) for 60 minutes. Animals were fluid resuscitated with Ringer's , balanced hydroxyethyl starch (HES) solution, or 0.9% normal saline to a mean arterial pressure of 80 mm Hg and compared with shams or nonresuscitated NTHS. Glycocalyx shed products were determined at baseline and 60 minutes after fluid resuscitation. Skeletal muscle microcirculation was visualized using handheld vital microscopy. VBP changes were assessed using plasma decay of 3 fluorescent dyes (40- and 500-kDa dextran and 70-kDa albumin), Evans blue dye exclusion, intravital fluorescence microscopy, and determination of tissue edema (wet/dry weight ratio).All glycocalyx shedding products were upgraded as a result of NTHS. Syndecan-1 significantly increased in NTHS (mean difference, -1668; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2336 to -1001; P < .0001), balanced crystalloid (mean difference, -964.2; 95% CI, -1492 to -436.4; P = .0001), and HES (mean difference, -1030; 95% CI, -1594 to -465.8; P = .0001) groups at the end of the experiment compared to baseline. Hyaluronan levels were higher at the end of the experiment in nonresuscitated NTHS (-923.1; 95% CI, -1216 to -630; P = .0001) and balanced crystalloid (-1039; 95% CI, -1332 to -745.5; P = .0001) or HES (-394.2; 95% CI, -670.1 to -118.3; P = .0027) groups compared to controls. Glycocalyx shedding resulted in microcirculation alterations as observed by handheld video microscopy. Total vessel density was altered in the normal saline (mean difference, 4.092; 95% CI, 0.6195-7.564; P = .016) and hemorrhagic shock (mean difference, 5.022; 95% CI, 1.55-8.495; P = .0024) groups compared to the control group, as well as the perfused vessel density and mean flow index. Despite degradation of endothelial glycocalyx, VBP as determined by 4 independent assays remained intact and continued to be so following fluid resuscitation.NTHS induced glycocalyx shedding and microcirculation alterations, without altering VBP. Fluid resuscitation partially restored the microcirculation without altering VBP. These results challenge the concept that the glycocalyx  is a significant contributor to VBP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24316150>Involvement of CTR1 and ATP7A in lead (Pb)-induced copper (Cu) accumulation in choroidal epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>The blood-cerebrospinal fluid  (BCB) plays a key role in maintaining copper (Cu) homeostasis in the brain. Cumulative evidences indicate that lead (Pb) exposure alters cerebral Cu homeostasis, which may underlie the development of neurodegenerative diseases. This study investigated the roles of Cu transporter 1 (CTR1) and ATP7A, two Cu transporters, in Pb-induced Cu accumulation in the choroidal epithelial cells. Pb exposure resulted in increased intracellular (64)Cu retention, accompanying with up-regulated CTR1 level. Knockdown of CTR1 using siRNA before Pb exposure diminished the Pb-induced increase of (64)Cu uptake. The expression level of ATP7A was down-regulated following the Pb exposure. ATP7A siRNA knockdown, or PCMB treatment, inhibited the (64)Cu efflux from the cells, while the following additional incubation with Pb failed to further increase the intracellular (64)Cu retention. Cu exposure, or intracellular Cu accumulation following the tetracycline (Tet)-induced overexpression of CTR1, did not result in significant change in ATP7A expression. Taken together, these data indicate that CTR1 and ATP7A play important roles in Cu transport in choroidal epithelial cells, and the Pb-induced intracellular Cu accumulation appears to be mediated, at least in part, via the alteration of CTR1 and ATP7A expression levels following Pb exposure.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

They do not receive early enteral feeding and have limited opportunities for skin to skin contact with their mothers. Many of these infants receive gastric acid suppression therapies. All these factors increase the risk of gut dysbiosis in these infants. Gut dysbiosis is known to be associated with increased risk of infections and other morbidities in ICU patients. Experimental studies have shown that probiotics inhibit gut colonization with pathogenic bacteria, enhance gut  , facilitate colonization with healthy commensals, protect from enteropathogenic infection through production of , reduce antimicrobial resistance, enhance innate immunity, and increase the maturation of the enteric nervous system and promote gut peristalsis. Through these mechanisms, probiotics have the potential to decrease the risk of sepsis and inflammation, improve feed tolerance and minimise cholestasis in neonates with CGISC. Among preterm non-surgical infants, evidence from more than 35 RCTs and multiple observational studies have shown probiotics to be safe and beneficial. A RCT in neonates (N=24) with gastroschisis found that probiotic supplementation partially attenuated gut dysbiosis. Two ongoing RCTs (total N=168) in neonates with gastrointestinal surgical conditions are expected to provide feasibility data to enable the conduct of large RCTs. Rigorous quality assurance of the probiotic product, ongoing microbial surveillance and clinical vigilance are warranted while conducting such RCTs.© 2018 The Authors.

However, little information is available regarding the vaginal delivery of larger and more polar molecules that currently require parenteral administration because the vaginal epithelium is perceived as a  to absorption of larger molecular weight (MW) molecules. Six healthy women underwent administration of 18 or 36mg of leuprolide, a GnRH agonist and a larger MW peptide, via a novel ethylene vinyl  (EVA) ring transvaginal drug delivery system (TVDS). Serum levels rose within 8h following insertion: low dose at 310pg/ml and high dose at 1220pg/ml, i.e. levels typically following parenteral injections of leuprolide. GnRHa biological activity was validated by secretion of gonadotropins and sex steroids. These results demonstrate that the non-keratinized vaginal epithelium permits a rapid absorption of a biologically active peptide and that there is significant potential for a novel TVDS to deliver peptides and possibly other macromolecules therapeutically.Current routes of administration of medications can include oral, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, transcutaneous, etc. Many of these approaches have limitations, including pain, poor tolerability, lack of adherence, and inadequate delivery. Peptides, in particular, cannot typically be given orally because they are broken down in the intestinal tract before they are absorbed. While the skin is an attractive way to deliver medications, its superb intrinsic   often makes this route untenable at times. The vaginal epithelium, in contrast, is not keratinized and can allow absorption of other molecules. In this study, we demonstrate that a novel transvaginal drug delivery system (TVDS) is capable of delivering peptide therapeutics to women in a non-parenteral fashion as demonstrated by both blood levels and biologic effects of its delivery.Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

Evidence is accumulating that use of DMPA might be associated with an increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition by women; however, mechanisms of this association are not completely understood. The goal of this study was to gain insight into mechanisms underlying the possible link between use of DMPA and risk of HIV-1 acquisition, exploring transcription profiling of ectocervical tissues.Healthy women received either DMPA (n = 31) or combined oral contraceptive (COC), which has not been linked to an increased risk of HIV acquisition (n = 32). We conducted a comparative microarray-based whole-genome transcriptome profiling of human ectocervical tissues before and after 6 weeks of hormonal contraception use.The analysis identified that expression of 235 and 76 genes was significantly altered after DMPA and COC use, respectively. The most striking effect of DMPA, but not COC, was significantly altered expression (mostly downregulation) of many genes strategically involved in the maintenance of mucosal  ; the alterations, as indicated by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), were most likely due to the DMPA-induced estrogen deficiency. Furthermore, IPA predicted that transcriptome alterations related to ectocervical immune responses were in general compatible with an immunosuppressive effect of DMPA, but, in some women, also with an inflammatory-like response.Our results suggest that impairment of cervicovaginal mucosal integrity in response to DMPA administration is an important mechanism contributing to the potential increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition in DMPA users.ClinicalTrials.gov .This study was supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under Cooperative Agreement GPO-A-00-08-00005-00.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27535915>Prelimbic to Accumbens Core Pathway Is Recruited in a Dopamine-Dependent Manner to Drive Cued Reinstatement of Cocaine Seeking.</a></h2><p>Glutamate inputs to nucleus accumbens (NAc) facilitate conditioned drug-seeking behavior and primarily originate from medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), basolateral amygdala (BLA), and ventral subiculum of the hippocampus (vSub). These regions express Fos (a marker of neural activity) during cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking, but only subpopulations of neurons within these regions drive drug seeking. One way to identify and functionally distinguish neural subpopulations activated during drug-seeking is to examine their projection targets. In rats, we examined Fos expression during cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine- and sucrose-seeking in prelimbic cortex (PL), infralimbic cortex (IL), BLA, and vSub neurons that project to NAc core (NAcC) or NAc shell (NAcSh). Neurons in PL, BLA, and vSub that project to NAcC, but not NAcSh, expressed Fos during cue-induced cocaine seeking, but not sucrose seeking. However, only activation of the PL-NAcC pathway positively correlated with cocaine reinstatement behavior, unlike BLA or vSub inputs to NAcC. To confirm a functional role for the PL-NAcC pathway, and to test the hypothesis that this pathway is recruited in a dopamine-dependent manner, we used a pharmacological disconnection approach whereby dopamine signaling was blocked in PL and glutamate signaling was blocked in the contralateral NAcC. This disconnection attenuated cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking but had no effect on reinstatement of sucrose seeking. Our results highlight a role for the PL-NAcC pathway in cocaine seeking and show that these glutamatergic projections are recruited in a dopamine-dependent manner to drive reinstatement.Relapse represents a significant  to the successful treatment of cocaine addiction. Here, we characterize the relative activation of glutamatergic inputs to nucleus accumbens during cued reinstatement of cocaine seeking versus sucrose seeking. Prelimbic cortex (PL) projections to nucleus accumbens core (NAcC) uniquely expressed Fos in a manner that positively correlated with cocaine-seeking, but not sucrose-seeking, behavior. Additional functional experiments showed that the PL-NAcC pathway was recruited by drug-associated cues in a dopamine-dependent manner to drive cocaine-seeking, but not sucrose-seeking, behavior. These data highlight PL neurons that project to NAcC, and their regulation by dopamine, as potential targets for therapeutics designed to treat cocaine relapse that do not affect natural reward seeking.Copyright © 2016 the authors 0270-6474/16/368700-12$15.00/0.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27889530>Identification of proximal biomarkers of PKC agonism and evaluation of their role in HIV reactivation.</a></h2><p>The HIV latent CD4 T cell reservoir is broadly recognized as a  to HIV cure. Induction of HIV expression using protein kinase C (PKC) agonists is one approach under investigation for reactivation of latently infected CD4 T cells (Beans et al., 2013; Abreu et al., 2014; Jiang et al., 2014; Jiang and Dandekar, 2015). We proposed that an increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms of action of PKC agonists was necessary to inform on biological signaling and pharmacodynamic biomarkers. RNA sequencing (RNA Seq) was applied to identify genes and pathways modulated by PKC agonists.Human CD4 T cells were treated ex vivo with Phorbol 12-myristate 13-, prostatin or ingenol-3-angelate. At 3 h and 24 h post-treatment, cells were harvested and RNA-Seq was performed on RNA isolated from cell lysates. The genes differentially expressed across the PKC agonists were validated by quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR). A subset of genes was evaluated for their role in HIV reactivation using siRNA and CRISPR approaches in the Jurkat latency cell model.Treatment of primary human CD4 T cells with PKC agonists resulted in alterations in gene expression. qPCR of RNA Seq data confirmed upregulation of 24 genes, including CD69, Egr1, Egr2, Egr3, CSF2, DUSP5, and NR4A1. Gene knockdown of Egr1 and Egr3 resulted in reduced expression and decreased HIV reactivation in response to PKC agonist treatment, indicating a potential role for Egr family members in latency reversal.Overall, our results offer new insights into the mechanism of action of PKC agonists, biomarkers of pathway engagement, and the potential role of EGR family in HIV reactivation.Copyright © 2016.

The human intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2 was used to reproduce monolayer-cells. Cells were divided into control group, LPS group, and SCFA+ LPS group according to the random number table. Cells in control group were only routinely cultured with DMEM medium. Cells in LPS group were cultured with DMEM medium and LPS with final mass concentration of 10 μg/mL. Cells in SCFA+ LPS group were cultured with DMEM medium, LPS and SCFA (consisting of 0.5 mmol/L , 0.01 mmol/L propionate, and 0.01 mmol/L butyrate) with final mass concentration of 10 μg/mL. At post culture hour (PCH) 0, 1, 2, 6, 12, and 24, transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) of cells was determined with an ohmmeter, with sample number of 72. Another portion of cells were divided and treated as above, and then Western blotting was employed to detect the protein expressions of zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1), occludin, and claudin-1 at PCH 24, with sample number of 6. Another portion of cells were divided and treated as above and then immunofluorescence was used to observe cellular morphology and distribution of ZO-1. Data were processed with analysis of variance of factorial design, one-way analysis of variance, least-significant difference test, and Bonferroni correction.  (1) Compared with that in control group, TER of cells in LPS group was significantly reduced from PCH 1 to 24 (<0.01), while TER of cells in SCFA+ LPS group showed no obvious change (>0.05). TER of cells in SCFA+ LPS group was significantly higher than that in LPS group from PCH 1 to 24 (<0.01). (2) Compared with the protein expressions of ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1 of cells in control group (1.25±0.10, 1.17±0.04, and 1.24±0.20), those of cells in LPS group (0.74±0.23, 0.76±0.11, and 0.77±0.11) at PCH 24 were significantly decreased (<0.05), while those of cells in SCFA+ LPS group (1.23±0.46, 1.05±0.09, and 1.01±0.13) showed no significant differences (>0.05). Protein expressions of occludin and claudin-1 of cells in SCFA+ LPS group were significantly higher than those in LPS group at PCH 24 (<0.05). Protein expression of ZO-1 of cells in SCFA+ LPS group was higher than that in LPS group at PCH 24 with no significant difference (>0.05). (3) At PCH 24, cells in control group were compact in arrangement with pebble-like appearance, and ZO-1 was distributed smoothly and continuously along the cell membrane. In LPS group, cells were sparse in arrangement with change in appearance, and ZO-1 was distributed uncontinuously along the cell membrane with curls and breaks. In SCFA+ LPS group, the appearance of cells and distribution of ZO-1 were remarkably ameliorated compared with those in LPS group.

However, pneumococci are also responsible for numerous local as well as severe systemic infections, especially in children under the age of five and the elderly. Under certain conditions, pneumococci are able to conquer the epithelial , which can lead to a dissemination of the bacteria into underlying tissues and the bloodstream. Here, specialized macrophages represent an essential part of the innate immune system against bacterial intruders. Recognition of the bacteria through different receptors on the surface of macrophages leads thereby to an uptake and elimination of bacteria. Accompanied cytokine release triggers the migration of leukocytes from peripheral blood to the site of infection, where monocytes differentiate into mature macrophages. The rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton during phagocytosis, resulting in the engulfment of bacteria, is thereby tightly regulated by receptor-mediated phosphorylation cascades of different protein kinases. The molecular cellular processes including the modulation of central protein kinases are only partially solved. In this study, the human monocytic THP-1 cell line was used as a model system to examine the activation of Fcγ and complement receptor-independent signal cascades during infection with S. pneumoniae. Pneumococci cultured either in chemically defined or complex medium showed no significant differences in pneumococcal phagocytosis by phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) differentiated THP-1 cells. Double immuno-fluorescence microscopy and antibiotic protection assays demonstrated a time-dependent uptake and killing of S. pneumoniae 35A inside of macrophages. Infections of THP-1 cells in the presence of specific pharmacological inhibitors revealed a crucial role of actin polymerization and importance of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Protein kinase B (Akt) as well during bacterial uptake. The participation of essential host cell signaling kinases in pneumococcal phagocytosis was deciphered for the kinase Akt, ERK1/2, and p38 and phosphoimmunoblots showed an increased phosphorylation and thus activation upon infection with pneumococci. Taken together, this study deciphers host cell kinases in innate immune cells that are induced upon infection with pneumococci and interfere with bacterial clearance after phagocytosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30457418>Influence of protamine shell on nanoemulsions as a carrier for cyclosporine-A skin delivery.</a></h2><p>Novel protamine-based nanosystems have been studied for cyclosporine-A (CsA) skin delivery. Core-shell structure systems have been developed to this end. These vehicles have particles sizes of 200-300 nm, a low polydispersity index and a zeta potential which varies between -16 mV and +35 mV. The resulting four nanosystems efficiently encapsulated CsA in their oily nucleus (60-80%) and released this drug in a controlled manner. These formulations have shown a high stability in aqueous suspension in storage conditions at 4 °C (for at least 21 months) and in  buffer at a physiological temperature of 37 °C (for at least 24 h). Ex vivo transdermal diffusion experiments using Franz diffusion cells and 2- to 3-day-old pig skin as a biological  were performed. All nanoformulations designed produced an increase in CsA transdermal delivery and two of these nanosystems presented a marked promoting effect; the more relevant parameters were smaller particle size (200 ± 7 nm) and negative superficial charge. Finally, the ability of these nanosystems to enhance retention of CsA in the skin was also studied. The protamine disposition in the shell influenced CsA skin retention.

Previous in vitro and animal studies have shown that arabinoxylans (AX) have the potential to modulate gut microbiota and gut  and therefore could have a protective role. Primary aim of the study was to investigate the effect of AX on intestinal permeability. Secondary aims included the effect of AX on gene transcription and protein expression of tight junctions (TJ), intestinal microbiota composition and activity, immune response and metabolic markers in overweight and obese individuals.In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 47 overweight subjects were randomly assigned to groups receiving 7.5 g/d AX (n = 16), 15 g/d AX (n = 17) or 15 g/d placebo (n = 14) for 6 wks. Intestinal permeability was investigated using a multi-sugar test. Sigmoid colon tissue was obtained from a subgroup (n = 26) for analyzing gene transcription and mucosal expression of TJ proteins. Fecal samples were collected to assess microbial composition and activity. Furthermore, the production of cytokines by stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was examined. Blood was also sampled for measuring metabolic markers.No significant changes in gastrointestinal permeability and TJ protein expression were observed after 6 wks AX supplementation compared to placebo. However, gene transcription of occludin was upregulated in the 7.5 g AX group, and transcription of claudin-3 and claudin-4 were upregulated in the 15 g AX group compared to placebo. Furthermore, fecal microbiota diversity was decreased after 6 wks 15 g AX treatment, but no change in relative abundance of dominant phyla was observed. AX intake significantly decreased fecal pH and increased fecal concentrations of total SCFAs, , propionate and butyrate, compared to placebo. Additionally, a decreased TNFα production by stimulated PBMCs was observed after 15 g AX treatment. No changes in metabolic markers were detected.Regular consumption of AX resulted in a more beneficial fermentation profile in overweight and obese individuals.

Nevertheless, during the past decade, there have been a growing number of publications focused on human genetics, the gut microbiome, and proteomics, suggesting that loss of mucosal  , particularly in the gastrointestinal tract, may substantially affect antigen trafficking, ultimately causing chronic inflammation, including autoimmunity, in genetically predisposed individuals. The gut mucosa works as a semipermeable  in that it permits nutrient absorption and also regulates immune surveillance while retaining potentially harmful microbes and environmental antigens within the intestinal lumen. Celiac disease (CD), a systemic, immune-mediated disorder triggered by gluten in genetically susceptible individuals, is associated with altered gut permeability. Pre-clinical and clinical studies have shown that gliadin, a prolamine component of gluten that is implicated in CD pathogenesis, is capable to disassembling intercellular junctional proteins by upregulating the zonulin pathway, which can be inhibited by the zonulin antagonist larazotide . In this review, we will focus on CD as a paradigm of chronic inflammatory diseases in order to outline the contribution of gut paracellular permeability toward disease pathogenesis; moreover, we will summarize current evidence derived from available clinical trials of larazotide  in CD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25984965>A pre-clinical pharmacokinetic study in rats of three naturally occurring iridoid glycosides, Picroside-I, II and III, using a validated simultaneous HPLC-MS/MS assay.</a></h2><p>A selective and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography-electro-spray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) method was developed for the simultaneous quantitative determination of Picroside-I, II, and III in rat plasma and tissue homogenate to aid the pre-clinical studies. The chromatographic separation was performed on a Hypersil GOLD AQ C18 column using a gradient elution program with a mobile phase consisting of 2mM ammonium  and acetonitrile. The detection was achieved using a triple quadrupole tandem MS in negative ionization multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. One-step protein precipitation was selected for plasma and tissue sample preparation while liquid-liquid extraction failed to achieve satisfactory recoveries. The calibration curves of all three analytes in either plasma or tissue homogenate showed good linearity over the concentration range of 0.5-500ng/mL with a limit of quantitation at 0.5ng/mL. Both the intra- and inter-day accuracy and precision were within ±10%. The extraction recoveries were >70%, and the relative matrix effect ranged from 80.4% to 107.4% in all the biological samples. All the analytes were stable in matrices for at least 24h at room temperature, or 21 days in frozen. Three freeze/thaw cycles did not cause degradation. The method was successfully applied for quantification of the three iridoid glycosides in the collected plasma and various tissues following intravenous administration in rats. Picroside-I, II, and III were all eliminated rapidly with large volume of distribution. Among the three glycosides, Picroside-II showed the highest liver uptake, and only Picroside-I and II were found to get across the blood brain  (BBB). These results were consistent with their hepatoprotective or neuroprotective effects reported clinically. With the aid of the efficient and reliable simultaneous LC-ESI-MS/MS assay this pharmacokinetic study provided insights into their therapeutic targets of these three iridoid glycosides as well as valuable experimental basis for an expansion of their clinical indications.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This study was designed to investigate Zn transport by the blood-CSF  (BCB) in the choroid plexus, with a particular focus on Zn transporter-2 (ZnT2), and to understand if lead (Pb) accumulation in the choroid plexus disturbed the Zn regulatory  in the BCB. Confocal microscopy, quantitative PCR and western blot demonstrated the presence of ZnT2 in the choroidal epithelia; ZnT2 was primarily in cytosol in freshly isolated plexus tissues but more toward the peripheral membrane in established choroidal Z310 cells. Exposure of rats to Pb (single ip injection of 50 mg Pb /kg) for 24 h increased ZnT2 fluorescent signals in plexus tissues by confocal imaging and protein expression by western blot. Similar results were obtained by in vitro experiments using Z310 cells. Further studies using cultured cells and a two-chamber Transwell device showed that Pb treatment significantly reduced the cellular Zn concentration and led to an increased transport of Zn across the BCB, the effect that may be due to the increased ZnT2 by Pb exposure. Taken together, these results indicate that ZnT2 is present in the BCB; Pb exposure increases the ZnT2 expression in choroidal epithelial cells by a yet unknown mechanism and as a result, more Zn ions may be deposited into the intracellular Zn pool, leading to a relative Zn deficiency state in the cytoplasm at the BCB.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25481489>The role of toll-like receptors 2 and 4 in the pathogenesis of feline pyometra.</a></h2><p>Pyometra is the most common uterine disease in queens. To protect itself from infection, the female reproductive tract possesses several immune mechanisms that are based on germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors (toll-like receptors [TLRs]). The aim of our study was to examine endometrial immunolocalization of TLR2/4, study the influence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α on messenger RNA expression of both receptors in pyometric queens, and compare these patterns between estrous cycling queens and those hormonally treated with medroxyprogesterone  (MPA). Thirty-six queens, ranging in age from 7 months to 11 years, were allocated into seven groups (anestrus, estrus, mid-diestrus and late diestrus, short-term and long-term hormonally treated queens, and pyometric queens). At the messenger RNA level, the real-time polymerase chain reaction was applied, whereas at the TLR2/4 protein level, the expression was tested by immunohistochemistry. In queens at estrus, gene expression of TLR2 was upregulated after stimulation of endometrial explants by TNF (P < 0.001) and by TNF together with the LPS (P < 0.01). Moreover, gene expression of TLR2 was significantly upregulated after stimulation by TNF (P < 0.001) and LPS (P < 0.01) explants derived from queens that had been long-term hormonally treated with MPA. Endometrial gene expression of TLR4 was significantly upregulated after incubation of explants with TNF (P < 0.001) in queens at estrus and with LPS (P < 0.05) in queens short-term hormonally treated with MPA. Immunolocalization reported that TLR2/4 receptors are mainly localized in the surface and glandular epithelia. These data show that short-term and especially long-term administration of progesterone derivatives impairs TLRs in the endometrial epithelium, presumably enabling pathogens to break through this first natural  and thereby increase the risk of pyometra development.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, a direct link between sympathetic dysregulation and gut dysbiosis remains to be illustrated. Bone marrow (BM)-derived immune cells continuously interact with the gut microbiota to maintain homeostasis in the host. Their  is largely dependent upon the sympathetic nervous system acting via adrenergic receptors present on the BM immune cells. In this study, we utilized a novel chimera mouse that lacks the expression of BM beta1/2 adrenergic receptors (b1/2-ARs) to investigate the role of the sympathetic drive to the BM in gut and microbiota homeostasis. Fecal analyses demonstrated a shift from a dominance of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes phylum in the b1/2-ARs KO chimera, resulting in a reduction in Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. Meanwhile, a significant reduction in Proteobacteria phylum was determined. No changes in the abundance of -, butyrate-, and lactate-producing bacteria, and colon pathology were observed in the b1/2-ARs KO chimera. Transcriptomic profiling in colon identified Killer Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D, Member 1 (Klrd1), Membrane-Spanning 4-Domains Subfamily A Member 4A (Ms4a4b), and Casein Kinase 2 Alpha Prime Polypeptide (Csnk2a2) as main transcripts associated with the microbiota shifts in the b1/2-ARs KO chimera. Suppression of leukocyte-related transcriptome networks (i.e., , differentiation, migration), classical compliment pathway, and networks associated with intestinal ,  integrity, and excretion was also observed in the colon of the KO chimera. Moreover, reduced expression of transcriptional networks related to intestinal diseases (i.e., ileitis, enteritis, inflammatory lesions, and stress) was noted. The observed suppressed transcriptome networks were associated with a reduction in NK cells, macrophages, and CD4 T cells in the b1/2-ARs KO chimera colon. Thus, sympathetic regulation of BM-derived immune cells plays a significant role in modifying inflammatory networks in the colon and the gut microbiota composition. To our knowledge, this study is the first to suggest a key role of BM b1/2-ARs signaling in host-microbiota interactions, and reveals specific molecular mechanisms that may lead to generation of novel anti-inflammatory treatments for many immune and autonomic diseases as well as gut dysbiosis across the board.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28650928>Circulating Exosomes Isolated from Septic Mice Induce Cardiovascular Hyperpermeability Through Promoting Podosome Cluster Formation.</a></h2><p>Septic shock increases vascular permeability, leading to multiple organ failure including cardiac dysfunction, a major contributor to septic death. Podosome, an actin-based dynamic membrane structure, plays critical roles in extracellular matrix degradation and angiogenesis. However, whether podosome contributes to endothelial  dysfunction during septic shock remains unknown. In this study, we found that the endothelial hyperpermeability, stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13- and thrombin, was accompanied by increased formation of podosome clusters at the cell periphery, indicating a positive correlation between podosome clusters and endothelial leakage. Interestingly, we observed that circulating exosomes collected from septic mice were able to stimulate podosome cluster formation in cardiac endothelial cells, together with increased permeability in vitro/in vivo and cardiac dysfunction. Mechanistically, we identified that septic exosomes contained higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) than normal ones, which were effectively transported to endothelial cells (ECs). Depletion of ROS in septic exosomes significantly reduced their capacity for promoting podosome cluster formation and thereby dampened vascular leakage. Finally, we elucidated that podosome cluster-induced endothelial hyperpermeability was associated with fragmentation/depletion of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) at the cell periphery. Our results demonstrate that septic exosomes were enriched with high amounts of ROS, which can be transported to ECs, leading to the generation of podosome clusters in target ECs and thereby, causing ZO-1 relocation, vascular leakage, and cardiac dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27103789>Multiple-unit tablet of probiotic bacteria for improved storage stability, acid tolerability, and in vivo intestinal protective effect.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to formulate probiotics-loaded pellets in a tablet form to improve storage stability, acid tolerability, and in vivo intestinal protective effect. Bacteria-loaded pellets primarily prepared with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose  succinate were compressed into tablets with highly compressible excipients and optimized for flow properties, hardness, and disintegration time. The optimized probiotic tablet consisted of enteric-coated pellets (335 mg), microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel PH102, 37.5 mg), and porous calcium silicate (25 mg) and allowed whole survival of living bacteria during the compaction process with sufficient tablet hardness (13 kp) and disintegration time (14 minutes). The multiple-unit tablet showed remarkably higher storage stability under ambient conditions (25°C/60% relative humidity) over 6 months and resistance to acidic medium compared to uncoated strains or pellets. Repeated intake of this multiple-unit tablet significantly lowered plasma level of endotoxin, a pathogenic material, compared to repeated intake of bare probiotics or marketed products in rats. These results, therefore, suggest that the multiple-unit tablet is advantageous to better bacterial viability and gain the beneficial effects on the gut flora, including the improvement of intestinal  .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28160859>Lindersin B from Lindernia crustacea induces neuritogenesis by activation of tyrosine kinase A/phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Neurotrophic factors such as nerve growth factor (NGF) play important roles in nervous system. NGF is a potential therapeutic drug for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. However, because of physicochemical property, NGF cannot pass through the blood-brain  (BBB). Hence, small molecules which exhibit NGF-mimic activity and can pass through the BBB are considered to be promising drug candidates for treatment of such diseases.The present study was designed to isolate NGF-mimic substance from extract of natural products, determine their structures and investigate mechanism of action of the active substance.Extract of Lindernia crustacean was partitioned between water and ethyl  to obtain water layer and ethyl  layer samples, respectively, and then evaluated their neuritogenic activity in PC12 cells. The active sample was separated by open columns, followed by HPLC purification to obtain active compound. Then, specific inhibitors were used to investigate signaling pathway of neurite outgrowth induced by the active compound. Finally, western blot analysis was performed to confirm the pathway proposed by inhibitor experiments.The ethyl  layer sample of extract of Lindernia crustacea exhibited significant neuritogenic activity. Two new compounds, named as linderside A and lindersin B, were isolated; their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic and chemical derivatization methods. Linderside A is a cucurbitane glycoside, whereas lindersin B is a cucurbitane triterpenoid. Each compound has an unusual isopentene unit, namely, a double bond bound to an unmodified isopropyl group at the end of cucurbitane triterpenoid side chain. Among them, lindersin B induced significant neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, while linderside A was inactive against PC12 cells. Western blotting analysis results showed that lindersin B-induced neuritogenic activity depended on the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Moreover, tyrosine kinase A (TrKA) and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) were also involved in the signaling pathway.Two new cucurbitane triterpenoids, linderside A and lindersin B, were isolated from Lindernia crustacean. Neurite outgrowth induced by lindersin B in PC12 cells depends on activation of TrkA/PI3K/ERK signaling pathway.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

We likewise saw treating mice with 1.0 mg of DMPA reduced vaginal CCAM expression and increased genital pathogen susceptibility. Herein, we used dose-response studies to delimit DMPA doses and serum MPA levels in mice associated with impaired genital mucosal   and enhanced susceptibility to low-dose herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection.We compared genital CCAM expression, genital mucosal permeability, and susceptibility to genital inoculation with 10 plaque-forming units of HSV-2 among mice in estrus vs. after treatment with 0.01 mg, 0.1 mg, 0.3 mg, or 1.0 mg of DMPA.Compared to mice in estrus, DMPA treatment in a dose-dependent fashion significantly reduced desmoglein 1α (Dsg1a) and desmocollin-1 (Dsc1) gene expression, reduced DSG1 protein levels, and increased genital mucosal permeability to a low molecular weight molecule. While no mice infected with HSV-2 in estrus died, we respectively saw 50% and 100% mortality in mice administered 0.1 mg or 0.3 mg of DMPA. At time of infection, mean serum MPA levels in mice administered the 0.1 mg or 0.3 mg doses were 3.8 nM and 13.0 nM respectively (values comparable to trough and peak MPA serum levels in women using DMPA).Mice with pharmacologically relevant serum MPA concentrations display significant changes in genital CCAM expression, genital mucosal  , and HSV-2 susceptibility.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The resulting impairment of intestinal barrier function may cause diarrhea associated with growth retardation or even death of piglets. Orally applied Zn is commonly used to prevent and treat diarrhea, but its mode of action still needs to be elucidated. To analyze the molecular mechanism whereby Zn acts on porcine intestinal barrier function, ex vivo studies on piglet jejunum and accompanying in vitro studies on a porcine jejunal epithelial cell line, IPEC-J2/PS, were performed with electrophysiological tools. Feeding pharmacological Zn doses exerted no significant electrophysiologically ascertainable short- and long-term effects on jejunal barrier function ex vivo. However, in IPEC-J2/PS, basolateral Zn was cytotoxic since its application caused a release of lactate dehydrogenase and an irreversible breakdown of the epithelial barrier. In contrast, apical Zn application caused an immediate increase in paracellular resistance and a decrease in permeability to the paracellular marker fluorescein, reflecting overall barrier strengthening in vitro. Apical effects were fully reversible upon washout. This indicates that Zn supplemented to feed was completely washed out during ex vivo jejunum preparation. We conclude that there is no evidence for long-term barrier effects through prophylactic Zn supplementation and that extracellular Zn acts acutely and reversibly from the apical side via tightening the paracellular route, thus counteracting leak-flux diarrhea. Therapeutically administered Zn successfully treats diarrhea in veterinary and human medicine. Here we present data that Zn strengthens the porcine jejunal epithelial barrier by reversibly tightening the paracellular route for inorganic ions and small solutes. Acute or long-lasting Zn effects on transcellular transport (Cl secretion) were not detected. We therefore conclude that Zn is useful for acutely treating leak-flux diarrhea rather than secretory diarrhea. Suitability as prophylactic feed supplement, however, is questionable.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25356028>Alcoholic disease: liver and beyond.</a></h2><p>The harmful use of alcohol is a worldwide problem. It has been estimated that alcohol abuse represents the world's third largest risk factor for disease and disability; it is a causal factor of 60 types of diseases and injuries and a concurrent cause of at least 200 others. Liver is the main organ responsible for metabolizing ethanol, thus it has been considered for long time the major victim of the harmful use of alcohol. Ethanol and its bioactive products, acetaldehyde-, fatty acid ethanol esters, ethanol-protein adducts, have been regarded as hepatotoxins that directly and indirectly exert their toxic effect on the liver. A similar mechanism has been postulated for the alcohol-related pancreatic damage. Alcohol and its metabolites directly injure acinar cells and elicit stellate cells to produce and deposit extracellular matrix thus triggering the "necrosis-fibrosis" sequence that finally leads to atrophy and fibrosis, morphological hallmarks of alcoholic chronic pancreatitis. Even if less attention has been paid to the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract, ethanol produces harmful effects by inducing: (1) direct damaging of the mucosa of the esophagus and stomach; (2) modification of the sphincterial pressure and impairment of motility; and (3) alteration of gastric acid output. In the intestine, ethanol can damage the intestinal mucosa directly or indirectly by altering the resident microflora and impairing the mucosal immune system. Notably, disruption of the intestinal mucosal  of the small and large intestine contribute to liver damage. This review summarizes the most clinically relevant alcohol-related diseases of the digestive tract focusing on the pathogenic mechanisms by which ethanol damages liver, pancreas and gastrointestinal tract.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29378000>Effect of individual SCFA on the epithelial  of sheep rumen under physiological and acidotic luminal pH conditions.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to investigate whether individual short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) have a different potential to either regulate the formation of the ruminal epithelial  (REB) at physiological pH or to damage the REB at acidotic ruminal pH. Ruminal epithelia of sheep were incubated in Ussing chambers on their mucosal side in buffered solutions (pH 6.1 or 5.1) containing no SCFA (control), 30 mM of either , propionate or butyrate, or 100 mM . Epithelial conductance (Gt), short-circuit current (Isc), and fluorescein flux rates were measured over 7 h. Thereafter, mRNA and protein abundance, as well as localization of the tight junction proteins claudin (Cldn)-1, -4, -7, and occludin were analyzed. At pH 6.1, butyrate increased Gt and decreased Isc, with additional decreases in claudin-7 mRNA and protein abundance (each P < 0.05) and disappearance of Cldn-7 immunosignals from the stratum corneum. By contrast, the mRNA abundance of Cldn-1 and/or Cldn-4 were upregulated by 30 mM propionate, 30 mM butyrate, or 100 mM  (P < 0.05), however, without coordinated changes in protein abundance. At luminal pH 5.1, neither Gt, Isc, nor TJ protein abundance was altered in the absence of SCFA; only fluorescein flux rates were slightly increased (P < 0.05) and fluorescein signals were no longer restricted to the stratum corneum. The presence of , propionate, or butyrate at pH 5.1 increased fluorescein flux rates and Gt, and decreased Isc (each P < 0.05). Protein abundance of Cldn-1 was decreased in all SCFA treatments but 30 mM butyrate; abundance of Cldn -4 and -7 was decreased in all SCFA treatments but 30 mM ; and abundance of occludin was decreased in all SCFA treatments but 30 mM propionate (each P < 0.05). Immunofluorescence staining of SCFA-treated tissues at pH 5.1 showed disappearance of Cldn-7, discontinuous pattern for Cldn-4 and blurring of occludin and Cldn-1 signals in tight junction complexes. The fluorescein dye appeared to freely diffuse into deeper cell layers. The strongest increase in Gt and consistent decreases in the abundance and immunosignals of tight junction proteins were observed with 100 mM  at pH 5.1. We conclude that SCFA may contribute differently to the REB formation at luminal pH 6.1 with possible detrimental effects of butyrate at 30 mM concentration. At luminal pH 5.1, all SCFA elicited REB damage with concentration appearing more critical than SCFA species.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189237>[Effect of lead exposure on the accumulation of copper and iron in central nervous system of rats].</a></h2><p> To investigate the dynamic changes of copper and iron contents in brain tissue, body fluids and barriers of rats exposed to lead at different periods in order to provide a theoretical basis for the study of the mechanism of lead nerve injury.

After exposure for 3, 6, 9 and 12 weeks, the samples including blood, choroid plexus, cerebrospinal fluid, cortex, hippocampus, striatum, hypothalamus, amygdala, substantia nigra and cerebellum were obtained. Lead, copper and iron content in all kinds of samples were detected by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry(ICP-MS). The measurement data were presented as , Comparison of metal contents in different tissues of rats at different time analyzed using repeated measurement analysis of variance, Two-variable correlation analysis using Spearman correlation test.The relationship between lead exposure experiod and copper and iron in samples was studied by using trend test.

Here, we characterize benzoxaborole phosphodiesterase (PDE)-4 inhibitors, a new topical class that has demonstrated therapeutic benefit for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis in phase 2 or phase 3 studies. Crisaborole [AN2728, 4-((1-hydroxy-1,3-dihydrobenzo[c][1,2]oxaborol-5-yl)oxy)benzonitrile], compd2 [2-ethoxy-6-((1-hydroxy-1,3-dihydrobenzo[c][1,2]oxaborol-5-yl)oxy)nicotinonitrile], compd3 [6-((1-hydroxy-1,3-dihydrobenzo[c][1,2]oxaborol-5-yl)oxy)-2-(2-isopropoxyethoxy)nicotinonitrile], and compd4 [5-chloro-6-((1-hydroxy-1,3-dihydrobenzo[c][1,2]oxaborol-5-yl)oxy)-2-((4-oxopentyl)oxy)nicotinonitrile] are potent PDE4 inhibitors with similar affinity for PDE4 isoforms and equivalent inhibition on the catalytic domain and the full-length enzyme. These benzoxaboroles are less active on other PDE isozymes. Compd4 binds to the catalytic domain of PDE4B2 with the oxaborole group chelating the catalytic bimetal and overlapping with the phosphate in cAMP during substrate hydrolysis, and the interaction extends into the adenine pocket. In cell culture, benzoxaborole PDE4 inhibitors suppress the release of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-23, IL-17, interferon-γ, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-22, and these cytokines contribute to the pathologic changes in skin structure and  functions as well as immune dysregulation in atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. Treatment with compd3 or N(6),2'-O-dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate increases cAMP response element binding protein phosphorylation in human monocytes and decreases extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation in human T cells; these changes lead to reduced cytokine production and are among the mechanisms by which compd3 blocks cytokine release. Topical compd3 penetrates the skin and suppresses phorbol myristate -induced IL-13, IL-22, IL-17F, and IL-23 transcription and calcipotriol-induced thymic stromal lymphopoietin expression in mouse skin. Skin thinning is a major dose-limiting side effect of glucocorticoids. By contrast, repeated application of compd3 did not thin mouse skin.

In the present study, 180 weaned pigs (7.98 ± 0.29 kg initial BW) were randomly assigned to 1 of 5 treatments, including a basal diet (CON) and CON supplemented with AB (20 mg/kg colistin sulfate; ABD) or 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/kg MccJ25. On d 0 to 14, dietary supplementation with MccJ25 and ABD had positive effects on ADG, ADFI, diarrhea incidence, and G:F ( < 0.05). Pigs fed the 2.0 mg/kg MccJ25 diet had greater ADG ( < 0.05) and marginally greater G:F ( < 0.10) compared with pigs fed the ABD diet. Compared with the CON diet, the 2.0 mg/kg MccJ25 diet sharply improved ( < 0.05) ADG and G:F and decreased ( < 0.05) diarrhea incidence (d 15 to 28 and d 0 to 28). Apparent digestibility of nutrients in pigs fed 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg MccJ25 was improved ( < 0.05) compared with that of pigs fed CON and ABD. The serum cytokines IL-6 and IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α levels in pigs fed MccJ25 were greater than in pigs fed CON ( < 0.05). Additionally, the IL-10 concentration in pigs fed MccJ25 was sharply increased ( < 0.05) compared with that of pigs fed CON. Pigs fed 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg MccJ25 diets had remarkably decreased lactate, diamine oxidase, and endotoxin concentrations and fecal numbers ( < 0.05) and improved fecal and numbers ( < 0.05). Compared with the ABD diet, the diet containing 2.0 mg/kg MccJ25 did not increase lactate, diamine oxidase, and endotoxin (d 14) concentrations ( < 0.05) or decrease the and (d 28) numbers ( < 0.05). The diets containing 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg MccJ25 and ABD (d 28) improved lactate concentration and short-chain fatty acid concentrations, including , propionate, and butyrate, in feces ( < 0.05). Moreover, the pigs fed 2.0 mg/kg MccJ25 had greater lactate, butyrate (d 14), and propionate concentrations than the pigs fed the ABD diet ( < 0.05). In conclusion, dietary supplemented MccJ25 effectively improved performance, attenuated diarrhea and systematic inflammation, enhanced intestinal  , and improved fecal microbiota composition of weaned pigs. Therefore, MccJ25 could be a potential effective alternative to AB for weaned pigs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27197704>Effects of carbohydrate/protein ratio on the microstructure and the  and sorption properties of wheat starch-whey protein blend edible films.</a></h2><p>Starch and whey protein isolate and their mixtures were used for making edible films.

The role of sodium  on cardiac uric acid (UA) production and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)-dependent antioxidant defense in pregnancy is not known. The study therefore sought to test the hypothesis that rats exposed to elevated testosterone in late pregnancy would have increased cardiac UA production and defective G6PD-dependent antioxidant defense. We also hypothesized that sodium  (SAc) or androgen receptor blocker, flutamide (Flu) would ameliorate these effects through endoglin inhibition. Twenty-four pregnant Wistar rats were treated (sc) with olive oil, testosterone propionate (0.5 mg/kg) singly or in combination with SAc (200 mg/kg; po) or Flu (7.5 mg/kg; po) in the late gestation between gestational day 14 and 19. The results showed that in the late gestation, testosterone exposure led to increased plasma and cardiac endoglin. In the heart of rats exposed to gestational testosterone there were elevated lactate dehydrogenase, adenosine deaminase, xanthine oxidase, uric acid (UA), cardiac injury markers and decreased G6PD-dependent antioxidant defense. However, either SAc or Flu comparably ameliorated these testosterone-induced effects. The data from the present study revealed that testosterone exposure in the late gestation causes elevated cardiac Eng that is accompanied by increased UA production and defective G6PD-dependent anti-oxidant defenses. Besides, the findings also suggest that the inhibitory effect of SAc or Flu on endoglin attenuates UA production and enhances the G6PD-dependent anti-oxidant , thereby implying that endoglin may be a potentially novel therapeutic intervention for cardiac dysfunction particularly in pregnancy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In addition, sacran significantly increased water content of the stratum corneum which regulates the skin  . Furthermore, sacran significantly inhibited inflammatory cytokine and chemokine mRNA levels in the dermatitis skin as well as the IgE antibody level in serum. Sacran inhibited inflammatory cytokines mRNA production from Jurkat cells derived from human leukemia T cells after stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-/ionomycin. Meanwhile, sacran did not inhibit the proliferation of primary B cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. These results suggest that sacran has good anti-allergic effect on AD model mice, probably due to the amelioration of skin   and suppression of immune responses.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We found that following 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13- (TPA) topical treatment, DLX3 expression is significantly upregulated in the epidermis and keratinocytes from mice overexpressing PKCα by transgenic targeting (K5-PKCα), resulting in cell cycle block and terminal differentiation. Epidermis lacking DLX3 (DLX3cKO), which is linked to the development of a DLX3-dependent epidermal hyperplasia with hyperkeratosis and dermal leukocyte recruitment, displays enhanced PKCα activation, suggesting a feedback regulation of DLX3 and PKCα. Of particular significance, transcriptional activation of epidermal , antimicrobial peptide and cytokine genes is significantly increased in DLX3cKO skin and further increased by TPA-dependent PKC activation. Furthermore, when inhibiting PKC activity, we show that epidermal thickness, keratinocyte proliferation and inflammatory cell infiltration are reduced and the PKC-DLX3-dependent gene expression signature is normalized. Independently of PKC, DLX3 expression specifically modulates regulatory networks such as Wnt signaling, phosphatase activity and cell adhesion. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis of primary suprabasal keratinocytes showed binding of DLX3 to the proximal promoter regions of genes associated with cell cycle regulation, and of structural proteins and transcription factors involved in epidermal differentiation. These results indicate that Dlx3 potentially regulates a set of crucial genes necessary during the epidermal differentiation process. Altogether, we demonstrate the existence of a robust DLX3-PKCα signaling pathway in keratinocytes that is crucial to epidermal differentiation control and cutaneous homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26414923>Pharmacological approaches in celiac disease.</a></h2><p>Celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of gluten, characterized by immune responses toward gluten constituents and the autoantigen transglutaminase 2. The only current treatment available for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet, however there are a plethora of therapies in development for the treatment of celiac disease (e.g. vaccine), management of symptoms while consuming gluten (e.g. Necator americanus) or adjuvant therapies in conjunction with the gluten-free diet (e.g. larazotide ). Current approaches in development target  , immune responses, detoxifying gluten or sequestering gluten. Developing therapies include those targeting environmental factors, such as the microbiota or proteases.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It is consumed as a herbal tea by local Uyghur people to treat high blood pressure and diarrhea. Our previous study confirmed that the ethyl  extract of Coreopsis tinctoria (AC) had a protective effect on diabetic nephropathy (DN) in an in vivo experiment. Here we aim to elucidate the protective mechanism of AC and marein, the main ingredient in Coreopsis tinctoria on renal fibrosis and inflammation in vitro under high glucose (HG) conditions.A HG-induced  dysfunction model in rat mesangial cells (HBZY-1) was established. The cells were exposed to AC and marein and/or HG for 24 h. Then, the renal protective effects of AC and marein via transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)/Smads, AMP-activated kinase protein (AMPK), and nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-κB) signaling were assessed.Both AC and marein suppressed rat mesangial cell hyperplasia and significantly attenuated the expression of HG-disrupted fibrotic and inflammatory proteins in HBZY-1 cells. It was also confirmed that AC and marein remarkably attenuated HG-induced renal inflammation and fibrosis by regulating the AMPK, TGF-β1/Smads, and NF-κB signaling pathways.These results indicated that AC and marein may delay the progression of DN, at least in part, by suppressing HG-induced renal inflammation and fibrosis. Marein may be one of the bioactive compounds in AC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31329991>Effect of dietary graded resistant potato starch levels on growth performance, plasma cytokines concentration, and intestinal health in meat ducks.</a></h2><p>The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of dietary graded raw potato starch (RPS) levels on growth performance, plasma cytokines concentration, ileal  , and cecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) concentration in meat ducks from 1 to 35 D of age. This study included 2 experiments. In experiment (Exp.) 1, sixteen 35-day-old meat ducks were used to evaluate the AME of RPS by orogastric administration. Results showed the AME value of RPS on ducks is 2.76 kcal/g. In Exp. 2, a total of 600 one-day-old ducklings were randomly assigned to 5 isonitrogenous and isoenergetic dietary treatments that included 0 (control), 6, 12, 18, and 24% RPS, respectively. Samples were collected at both of 14 and 35 D. Neither growth performance nor ileal parameters (length, weight, and pH) at both of 14 and 35 D was affected by dietary RPS. However, the mucosal thickness (14 D), villus height (except for 18% RPS at 14 D), and the villus height: crypt depth ratio (14 and 35 D) of the ileum were increased in the 12 and 18% RPS diets when compared to 0% RPS diet. Meanwhile, proinflammatory factors such as plasma interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 (14 D) reduced in 12% RPS diet and tumor necrosis factor α decreased in 12% (except for 14 D) and 18% RPS groups. When compared with the control group, diets with 18% RPS significantly increased mucin 2 gene expression at 14 D, and 12% RPS elevated the mRNA expression of tight junction proteins including Zonula occludens-1 and Claudin 1 (except for 14 D) in the ileal mucosa of birds. Furthermore, ducks fed 12% RPS diet had higher concentrations of , propionate, and butyrate in cecal digesta than other groups. These findings indicated that diets with 12 and/or 18% RPS increased the cecal SCFA concentration, which subsequently enhanced the   and improved intestinal health in the ileum for 14 and 35-day-old meat ducks.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24904283>Strategies to increase the activity of microglia as efficient protectors of the brain against infections.</a></h2><p>In healthy individuals, infections of the central nervous system (CNS) are comparatively rare. Based on the ability of microglial cells to phagocytose and kill pathogens and on clinical findings in immunocompromised patients with CNS infections, we hypothesize that an intact microglial  is crucial to protect the brain from infections. Phagocytosis of pathogens by microglial cells can be stimulated by agonists of receptors of the innate immune system. Enhancing this pathway to increase the resistance of the brain to infections entails the risk of inducing collateral damage to the nervous tissue. The diversity of microglial cells opens avenue to selectively stimulate sub-populations responsible for the defence against pathogens without stimulating sub-populations which are responsible for collateral damage to the nervous tissue. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), an endogenous lipid, increased phagocytosis of bacteria by microglial cells in vitro without a measurable proinflammatory effect. It was tested clinically apparently without severe side effects. Glatiramer  increased phagocytosis of latex beads by microglia and monocytes, and dimethyl fumarate enhanced elimination of human immunodeficiency virus from infected macrophages without inducing a release of proinflammatory compounds. Therefore, the discovery of compounds which stimulate the elimination of pathogens without collateral damage of neuronal structures appears an achievable goal. PEA and, with limitations, glatiramer  and dimethyl fumarate appear promising candidates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30343040>Impact of topical corticosteroid pretreatment on susceptibility of the injured murine cornea to Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization and infection.</a></h2><p>Research with animal models of Pseudomonas aeruginosa keratitis has shown that use of a topical corticosteroid alone against an established infection can significantly increase the number of colonizing bacteria or worsen clinical disease. Moreover, retrospective analysis has suggested that corticosteroid use in humans is associated with an increased risk of keratitis in eyes with pre-existing disease. Thus, while corticosteroids are often used to reduce ocular inflammation in the absence of infection, the risk of opportunistic infection remains a concern. However, the effect of corticosteroids on the intrinsic   of uninfected corneas is unknown. Here, we tested if short-term topical corticosteroid treatment of an uninfected murine cornea would increase susceptibility to P. aeruginosa colonization or infection after epithelial injury. Topical prednisolone  (1%) was administered to one eye of C57BL/6 mice three times a day for 3 days; control eyes were treated with sterile PBS. Prior to inoculation with a cytotoxic P. aeruginosa corneal isolate strain 6206, corneas were subject to superficial-injury by tissue paper blotting, or scratch-injured followed by 12 h of healing. Previously we have shown that blotting renders mouse corneas susceptible to P. aeruginosa adhesion, but not infection, while 12 h healing reduces susceptibility to infection after scratching. Corneas were evaluated at 48 h for bacterial colonization and microbial keratitis (MK). To monitor impact on wound healing, corneal integrity was examined by fluorescein staining immediately after scarification and after 12 h healing. For both the tissue paper blotting and scratch-injury models, there was no significant difference in P. aeruginosa colonization at 48 h between corticosteroid-pretreated eyes and controls. With the blotting model, one case of MK was observed in a control (PBS-pretreated) cornea; none in corticosteroid-pretreated corneas. With the 12 h healing model, MK occurred in 6 of 17 corticosteroid-pretreated eyes versus 2 of 17 controls, a difference not statistically significant. Corticosteroid-pretreated eyes showed greater fluorescein staining 12 h after scarification injury, but this did not coincide with increased colonization or MK. Together, these data show that short-term topical corticosteroid therapy on an uninfected murine cornea does not necessarily enhance its susceptibility to P. aeruginosa colonization or infection after injury, even when it induces fluorescein staining.Copyright © 2018.

Both inulin and AXOS decreased the pH during incubation (-1.5 pH units), leading to increased productions of , propionate, and butyrate. Differences in terms of metabolites production could be linked to specific microbial alterations at genus level upon inulin/AXOS supplementation (i.e., Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, Prevotella and unclassified Erysipelotrichaceae), as shown by 16S-targeted Illumina sequencing. Both products stimulated gut  and immune  with increases in TEER, NF-KB, IL-10, and IL-6.

In the initial state of the reaction, a partial oxido radical (0.44 spins) is formed ligated to Mn. This radical is involved in a nucleophylic attack by bulk water in the OO bond reaction formation step, in which the oxido fractional unpaired electron is delocalized toward the outermost Mn of the μ-oxo bridge, instead of the ligated Mn center. The reaction then follows with a series of proton-coupled electron transfer steps, in which the oxidation state, as well as the bond strength of the OO moiety increase, while the OOMn(1) bond gets weaker until O is released. In this model, basic  ions from the buffer solution capture protons in the proton-transfer steps. In each step there is reduction of the OOMn(1) binding strength, with concomitant increase of the OO bond strength, which culminates with the release of O in the last step. This last step is entropy driven, while formation of hydroperoxide and superoxide moieties is enthalpy driven. According with experiments, the rate-limiting step is the double oxidation of Mn(IV,III) or peroxymonosulfate binding, which occur prior to the OO bond formation step. This supports our findings that the barriers of all intermediate steps are below the experimental  of 19-21kcal/mol. The implications of these findings for understanding photosynthetic water-splitting catalysis are also discussed.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This technique, however, requires harsh conditions for cell fixation and permeabilization, which can denature surface antigens or antibody-conjugated fluorochromes. These are among several technical limitations which have been a  to quantify signaling in unique B cell subsets. One such immature subset, transitional B cells (TrBs), may play a role in suppressing solid organ transplant rejection, graft-versus-host disease, autoimmunity, and even the immune response to malignancy. Here we sought to optimize a protocol for quantification of signaling in human TrBs compared with mature B cell subsets.TrBs were defined by surface marker expression as CD19CD24CD38. Key parameters optimized included antibody clone selection, sequence of surface epitope labeling in relation to paraformaldehyde-based fixation and methanol-based permeabilization, photomultiplier tube (PMT) voltages, and compensation. Special attention was paid to labeling of CD38 with regard to these parameters, and an optimized protocol enabled reliable identification of TrBs, naïve (CD24CD38), early memory (CD24CD38), and late memory (CD24CD38) B cells. Phospho flow cytometry enabled simultaneous quantification of phosphorylation among at least three different signaling molecules within the same sample. Among normal donors, transitional B cells exhibited diminished mitogen activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase and Akt phospho signaling upon nonspecific stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateand ionomycin stimulation.We optimized an effective protocol to quantify B cell subset signaling upon stimulation.

In our previous study, we found that skullcap could inhibit allergen permeation and regulate Th1/2 immune balance. To reveal the key fractions and components of skullcap, we fractionated skullcap extract into five fractions: hexane, chloroform, ethyl , butanol, and water fraction. Among these fractions, the hexane fraction significantly suppressed the production of Th2-mediated cytokines (Interleukin (IL)-4, 5, 10 and 13) and increased Th1-mediated cytokines (Interferon (IFN)-γ and IL-12). Furthermore, the hexane fraction inhibited the permeation of ovalbumin (OVA), used as an allergen, across the intestinal epithelial cell monolayer. To confirm the active compounds in the hexane fraction, fatty acids were analyzed. Linoleic acid (LA, C18:2 (>59.7%)) was identified as the most important fatty acid in the skullcap hexane fraction. LA significantly suppressed IL-4 production and increased IFN-γ secretion, as well as inhibiting OVA permeation.

Skin-resident T cells orchestrate numerous immunological functions that are critically involved in both tissue homeostasis and cutaneous immunity. The impact of chronic ethanol (EtOH) exposure on skin T cells has not previously been examined; given their important role in maintaining the immune   of the skin further study is warranted.Mice were administered EtOH in the drinking water for 12 to 16 weeks. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate impact of EtOH feeding on skin T cell numbers, rates of proliferation, and apoptosis as well as activation marker expression and cytokine production after ex vivo stimulation.Chronic EtOH feeding caused a baseline reduction in dendritic epidermal T cell (DETC) numbers that corresponded with reduced expression of the activation marker JAML following phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA)/ionomycin stimulation. Chronic EtOH feeding did not alter total numbers of dermal T cells, but specific subset loss was observed in Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) as well as CD3hi, Vγ3(+) and CD3int, Vγ3(-) dermal γδ T cells. EtOH-induced dysfunction in the latter population, which represents prototypical interleukin-17 (IL-17)-producing dermal γδT17s, was made evident by diminished IL-17 production following anti-CD3 stimulation. Additionally, the capacity of lymph node γδ T cells to produce IL-17 following anti-CD3 and PMA/ionomycin stimulation was impaired by chronic EtOH feeding.Chronic EtOH feeding induced defects in both numbers and  of multiple skin T cell subsets. The decreased density and poor responsiveness of DETCs and γδT17 cells in particular would be expected to compromise immune effector mechanisms necessary to maintain a protective  and restrict pathogen invasion. These findings demonstrate the sensitivity of skin T cells to EtOH and provide new mechanisms to help explain the propensity of alcoholics to suffer skin infection.Copyright © 2014 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28315049>Antihypertensive Effects of Probiotics.</a></h2><p>The present review focuses in the hypertension-associated changes in the microbiota and the current insights regarding the impact of probiotics on blood pressure in animal models and in human hypertensive patients.Gut dysbiosis in hypertension is characterized by (i) the gut microbioma that is less diverse and less rich with an increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and (ii) a decrease in - and butyrate-producing bacteria and an increase in lactate-producing bacterial populations.

The saturated solubility of DA in different oils, surfactants and co-surfactants was tested. The ratio of surfactant to co-surfactant was selected by constructing pseudo three phase diagrams to investigate the maximal microemulsion area. In vitro permeation studies of DA from microemulsion and suspension were performed to optimize the formulation further.

The permeation enhancement of microemusion was 6.00-fold as that of suspension, and the DA from microemulsion retained in the skin was 4.79-fold as that of suspension. DSC and ATR-FTIR results suggested that microemulsion could affect the intercellular lipid lamellae and keratin of the stratum corneum.

The human interfollicular epidermis can be subdivided into five different layers: (1) stratum basale, (2) stratum spinosum, (3) stratum granulosum, (4) stratum lucidum, and (5) stratum corneum, all originating from basal keratinocytes by differentiation (Hameetman et al., BMC cancer 13:58, 2013; Ramirez et al., Differentiation 58(1):53-64, 1994). The epidermis is also able to generate different appendages: hair follicles (HF) and their associated sebaceous glands (Sibilia et al., Cell 102(2):211-220, 2000) as well as sweat glands (Luetteke et al., Genes Dev 8(4):399-413, 1994). The skin has important functions in several biological processes like environmental , tissue regeneration, hair cycling, and wound repair. During these processes, stem cells from the interfollicular epidermis and from the hair follicle bulge are activated to renew the epidermis or hair. The epidermis and hair undergo continuous homeostatic regeneration and mutations, upon mutations which disturb the balance of homeostatic regeneration of epidermis and hair and lead to enhanced proliferation of keratinocytes, development of skin cancer is developed. Tumors that arise in the skin are mainly of three types: malignant melanoma, arising from melanocytes, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), the latter two both arising from keratinocytes or hair follicle cells. In this chapter, we will describe some genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) that aim at modeling human BCC and SCC and their respective precancerous lesions. We will describe the experimental approaches used in our laboratory to analyze tumor-bearing mice focusing on methods necessary for the induction of tumor growth as well as for the molecular and histological analysis of tumor tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27088187>Effects of UV-ozone irradiation on copper doped nickel  and its applicability to perovskite solar cells.</a></h2><p>The effects of UV-ozone (UVO) irradiation on copper-doped nickel  and its applicability to perovskite solar cells were investigated. UVO irradiation of copper-doped nickel  significantly increased the electrical conductivity (from 4.28 × 10(-4) S cm(-1) to 5.66 × 10(-2) S cm(-1)), which is due to the increased carrier concentration (from 3.53 × 10(13) cm(-3) to 2.41 × 10(16) cm(-3)), and the charge extraction efficiency was enhanced, leading to better compatibility with the hole transport layer. By UVO irradiation, the work  was increased from 4.95 eV to 5.33 eV by the surface dipole formation, which effectively reduced the interface  between the hole transport layer and the MAPbI3 light absorbing layer. UVO Irradiation of the underlying layer also allows the MAPbI3 precursors to form better morphology with highly arranged crystallinity. Compared to the cells using non-irradiated copper doped nickel , UVO-irradiated copper-doped nickel  devices showed an enhanced open-circuit voltage (3% increase), short circuit current (16% increase), fill factor (5% increase), showing an enhanced power conversion efficiency of 12.2% (21% increase).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25123184>Epigalloccatechin-3-gallate inhibits ocular neovascularization and vascular permeability in human retinal pigment epithelial and human retinal microvascular endothelial cells via suppression of MMP-9 and VEGF activation.</a></h2><p>Epigalloccatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is the main polyphenol component of green tea (leaves of Camellia sinensis). EGCG is known for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and anti-carcinogenic properties. Here, we identify EGCG as a new inhibitor of ocular angiogenesis and its vascular permeability. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) play a key role in the processes of extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and microvascular permeability during angiogenesis. We investigated the inhibitory effects of EGCG on ocular neovascularization and vascular permeability using the retina oriented cells and animal models induced by VEGF and alkaline burn. EGCG treatment significantly decreased mRNA and protein expression levels of MMP-9 in the presence of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in human retinal pigment epithelial cells (HRPECs). EGCG also effectively protected ARPE-19 cells from cell death and attenuated mRNA expressions of key angiogenic factors (MMP-9, VEGF, VEGF Receptor-2) by inhibiting generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). EGCG significantly inhibited proliferation, vascular permeability, and tube formation in VEGF-induced human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs). Furthermore, EGCG significantly reduced vascular leakage and permeability by blood-retinal  breakdown in VEGF-induced animal models. In addition, EGCG effectively limited upregulation of MMP-9 and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM/CD31) on corneal neovascularization (CNV) induced by alkaline burn. Our data suggest that MMP-9 and VEGF are key therapeutic targets of EGCG for treatment and prevention of ocular angiogenic diseases such as age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and corneal neovascularization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29695409>Soy Phosphatidylglycerol Reduces Inflammation in a Contact Irritant Ear Edema Mouse Model In Vivo.</a></h2><p>We have previously shown that phosphatidylglycerol (PG) regulates the  of keratinocytes, the predominant cells that compose the epidermis, inhibiting the proliferation of rapidly dividing keratinocytes. In particular, soy PG, a PG mixture with a high proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids, is efficacious at inhibiting these proliferating keratinocytes. Psoriasis is a skin disorder characterized by hyperproliferation of keratinocytes and inflammation. Data in the lung suggest that PG in pulmonary surfactant inhibits inflammation. To investigate the possibility of using PG containing polyunsaturated fatty acids for the treatment of psoriasis, we examined the effect of soy PG on inflammation induced by the application of 12--tetradecanoylphorbol 13- (TPA), a contact irritant, to mouse ears in vivo. We monitored ear thickness and weight as a measure of ear edema, as well as CD45-positive immune cell infiltration. Our results indicate that soy PG when applied together with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (vitamin D), an agent known to acutely disrupt the skin , suppressed ear edema and inhibited the infiltration of CD45-positive immune cells. On the other hand, neither PG nor vitamin D alone was effective. The combination also decreased tumor necrosis factor- (TNF) levels. This result suggested the possibility that PG was not permeating the skin  efficiently. Therefore, in a further study we applied PG in a penetration-enhancing vehicle and found that it inhibited inflammation induced by the phorbol ester and decreased CD45-positive immune cell infiltration. Our results suggest the possibility of using soy PG as a topical treatment option for psoriasis.U.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28526793>Genomic Analysis of Calderihabitans maritimus KKC1, a Thermophilic, Hydrogenogenic, Carboxydotrophic Bacterium Isolated from Marine Sediment.</a></h2><p> KKC1 is a thermophilic, hydrogenogenic carboxydotroph isolated from a submerged marine caldera. Here, we describe the  sequencing and feature analysis of the  KKC1 genome. Genome-based phylogenetic analysis confirmed that  KKC1 was most closely related to the genus , which includes well-studied acetogenic members. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that, like ,  KKC1 retained both the CO-reducing Wood-Ljungdahl pathway and energy-converting hydrogenase-based module activated by reduced ferredoxin, but it lacked the HydABC and NfnAB electron-bifurcating enzymes and pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase required for ferredoxin reduction for acetogenic growth. Furthermore,  KKC1 harbored six genes encoding CooS, a catalytic subunit of the anaerobic CO dehydrogenase that can reduce ferredoxin via CO oxidation, whereas  possessed only two CooS genes. Our analysis revealed that three  genes formed known gene clusters in other microorganisms, i.e., -acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) synthase (which contained a frameshift mutation), -energy-converting hydrogenase, and -FAD-NAD oxidoreductase, while the other three had novel genomic contexts. Sequence composition analysis indicated that these  genes likely evolved from a common ancestor. Collectively, these data suggest that  KKC1 may be highly dependent on CO as a low-potential electron donor to directly reduce ferredoxin and may be more suited to carboxydotrophic growth compared to the acetogenic growth observed in , which show adaptation at a thermodynamic limit. KKC1 and members of the genus  are phylogenetically related but physiologically distinct. The former is a hydrogenogenic carboxydotroph that can grow on carbon monoxide (CO) with H production, whereas the latter include acetogenic bacteria that grow on H plus CO with  production. Both species may require reduced ferredoxin as an actual "energy equivalent," but ferredoxin is a low-potential electron carrier and requires a high-energy substrate as an electron donor for reduction. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that  KKC1 lacked specific electron-bifurcating enzymes and possessed six CO dehydrogenases, unlike  species. This suggests that  KKC1 may be more dependent on CO, a strong electron donor that can directly reduce ferredoxin via CO dehydrogenase, and may exhibit a survival strategy different from that of acetogenic , which solves the energetic  associated with endergonic reduction of ferredoxin with hydrogen.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24191027>MCPIP1 restricts HIV infection and is rapidly degraded in activated CD4+ T cells.</a></h2><p>HIV-1 primarily infects activated CD4+ T cells and macrophages. Quiescent CD4+ T cells, however, possess cellular factors that limit HIV-1 infection at different postentry steps of the viral life cycle. Here, we show that the previously reported immune regulator monocyte chemotactic protein-induced protein 1 (MCPIP1) restricts HIV-1 production in CD4+ T cells. While the ectopic expression of MCPIP1 in cell lines abolished the production of HIV-1, silencing of MCPIP1 enhanced HIV-1 production. Subsequent analysis indicated that MCPIP1 imposes its restriction by decreasing the steady levels of viral mRNA species through its RNase domain. Remarkably, common T-cell stimuli induced the rapid degradation of MCPIP1 in both T-cell lines and quiescent human CD4+ T cells. Lastly, blocking the proteosomal degradation of MCPIP1 by MG132 abrogated HIV-1 production in phorbol 12-myristate 13-/ionomycin-stimulated human CD4+ T cells isolated from healthy donors. Overall, MCPIP1 poses a potent  against HIV-1 infection at a posttranscriptional stage. Although the observed HIV restriction conferred by MCPIP1 does not seem to be overcome by any viral protein, it is removed during cellular stimulation. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms of cellular activation-mediated HIV-1 production in CD4+ T cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24236208>Trophoblast cell fusion and differentiation are mediated by both the protein kinase C and a pathways.</a></h2><p>The syncytiotrophoblast of the human placenta is an epithelial  that interacts with maternal blood and is a key for the transfer of nutrients and other solutes to the developing fetus. The syncytiotrophoblast is a true syncytium and fusion of progenitor cytotrophoblasts is the cardinal event leading to the formation of this layer. BeWo cells are often used as a surrogate for cytotrophoblasts, since they can be induced to fuse, and then express certain differentiation markers associated with trophoblast syncytialization. Dysferlin, a syncytiotrophoblast membrane repair protein, is up-regulated in BeWo cells induced to fuse by treatment with forskolin; this fusion is thought to occur through cAMP/protein kinase A-dependent mechanisms. We hypothesized that dysferlin may also be up-regulated in response to fusion through other pathways. Here, we show that BeWo cells can also be induced to fuse by treatment with an activator of protein kinase C, and that this fusion is accompanied by increased expression of dysferlin. Moreover, a dramatic synergistic increase in dysferlin expression is observed when both the protein kinase A and protein kinase C pathways are activated in BeWo cells. This synergy in fusion is also accompanied by dramatic increases in mRNA for the placental fusion proteins syncytin 1, syncytin 2, as well as dysferlin. Dysferlin, however, was shown to be dispensable for stimulus-induced BeWo cell syncytialization, since dysferlin knockdown lines fused to the same extent as control cells. The classical trophoblast differentiation marker human chorionic gonadotropin was also monitored and changes in the expression closely parallel that of dysferlin in all of the experimental conditions employed. Thus different biochemical markers of trophoblast fusion behave in concert supporting the hypothesis that activation of both protein kinase C and A pathways lead to trophoblastic differentiation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26342333>Influence of the set anode potential on the performance and internal energy losses of a methane-producing microbial electrolysis cell.</a></h2><p>The effect of the set anode potential (between + 200 mV and - 200 mV vs. SHE, standard hydrogen electrode) on the performance and distribution of internal potential losses has been analyzed in a continuous-flow methane-producing microbial electrolysis cell (MEC).Both  removal rate (at the anode) and methane generation rate (at the cathode) were higher (1 gCOD/L day and 0.30 m(3)/m(3) day, respectively) when the anode potential was controlled at + 200 mV. However, both the yields of  conversion into current and current conversion into methane were very high (72-90%) under all the tested conditions. Moreover, the sum of internal potential losses decreased from 1.46 V to 0.69 V as the anode potential was decreased from + 200 mV to - 200 mV, with cathode overpotentials always representing the main potential losses. This was likely to be due to the high energy  which has to be overcome in order to activate the cathode reaction. Finally, the energy efficiency correspondingly increased reaching 120% when the anode was controlled at - 200 mV.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29747348>[Cerebral cavernous malformation 3 gene deficiency promotes early changes in Alzheimer disease-like lesions induced by low lead exposure].</a></h2><p> To investigate the effects of cerebral cavernous malformation 3 (CCM3) gene knockout on the lead exposure-induced blood-brain  malfunction in mice brain, and the relationship between CCM3 knockout and the Alzheimer's disease (AD).  Wide type (WT) mice and CCM3(+)/- mice were divided into 4 groups, control group and lead exposed group in WT as well as CCM3(+/-) mice. Lead exposed groups were treated with 0.05% lead  in drinking water for 12 weeks, while control group drink deionized water freely. Blood lead and brain lead levels in each group were detected by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. The brain tissue of each group was made into paraffin sections, whose morphology were observed by HE staining. The expression of Aβ(1-42) in brain tissue was detected by immunohistochemistry and the brain capillaries were labeled by VRGFR2. The protein expression of Claudin-5, ZO-1, and p-Tau was detected by Western blot. The brain tissue RNA was extracted and the relative expression of LRP-1 mRNA was detected by qRT-PCR.  The levels of blood lead WT (216.07±84.16) and CCM3(+/-) (189.64±101.86) μg/L in lead exposed group were higher than those in control group WT (19.52±11.46) and CCM3(+/-) (11.79±8.20) μg/L, the difference was statistically significant (4.18, 0.006; 3.79, 0.016). The levels of brain lead WT (1.78±0.69) and CCM3(+/-) (1.74±0.66) μg/L were higher than those in control group WT (1.06±0.87) and CCM3(+/-) (0.97±0.64) μg/L, the difference was statistically significant (3.67, 0.018; 3.88, 0.015). The HE staining showed no obvious lesions in the brain of each group of mice. The results of immunohistochemistry showed that there was no Aβ(1)-42 deposition in the brain of mice in each group. The numbers of microvessels in the brain of CCM3(+/-) mice in the lead exposed group were decreased. Compared with the relative expression levels of Claudin-5 (WT: 1.30±0.03, CCM3(+/-): 1.07±0.08) in control group mice brain, the relative expression of Claudin-5 (WT: 0.96±0.04, CCM3(+/-): 0.59±0.01) was decreased with statistical significance (=199.27, 0.001). The relative expression level of LRP-1 gene mRNA in brain of lead exposed group (WT: 0.32±0.10, CCM3(+/-): 0.06±0.01) was higher than that of unexposed group (WT:1.00±0.06, CCM3(+/-):2.12±0.18), the difference was statistically significant (288.29, 0.001). The relative expression level of LRP-1 gene mRNA in brain of CCM3(+)/- mice exposed to lead was lower than that of WT mice ((0.06±0.01)vs(0.32±0.10), 26.90, 0.001).  The mice did not show significant AD-like lesions under low-does lead exposure, but resulted in early damage of brain blood-brain  and early changes of AD-like lesions in mice, with CCM3(+/-) mice being sensitive to lead exposure stronger than that of WT mice, suggesting that deletion of CCM3 gene may be one of the potential risk factors for accelerating the development of AD in mice exposed to lead.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26927152>Chitosan Coagulation to Improve Microbial and Turbidity Removal by Ceramic Water Filtration for Household Drinking Water Treatment.</a></h2><p>The use of porous ceramic filters is promoted globally for household water treatment, but these filters are ineffective in removing viruses from water. In order to increase virus removal, we combine a promising natural coagulant, chitosan, as a pretreatment for ceramic water filters (CWFs) and evaluate the performance of this dual  water treatment system. Chitosan is a non-toxic and biodegradable organic polymer derived by simple chemical treatments from chitin, a major source of which is the leftover shells of crustacean seafoods, such as shrimp, prawns, crabs, and lobsters. To determine the effectiveness of chitosan, model test water was contaminated with Escherichia coli K011 and coliphage MS2 as a model enteric bacterium and virus, respectively. Kaolinite clay was used to model turbidity. Coagulation effectiveness of three types of modified chitosans was determine at various doses ranging from 5 to 30 mg/L, followed by flocculation and sedimentation. The pre-treated supernatant water was then decanted into the CWF for further treatment by filtration. There were appreciable microbial removals by chitosan HCl, , and lactate pretreatment followed by CWF treatment, with mean reductions (95% CI) between 4.7 (± 1.56) and 7.5 (± 0.02) log10 for Escherichia coli, and between 2.8 (± 0.10) and 4.5 (± 1.04) log10 for MS2. Turbidity reduction with chitosan treatment and filtration consistently resulted in turbidities < 1 NTU, which meet turbidity standards of the US EPA and guidance by the World Health Organization (WHO). According to WHO health-based microbial removal targets for household water treatment technology, chitosan coagulation achieved health protective targets for both viruses and bacteria. Therefore, the results of this study support the use of chitosan to improve household drinking water filtration processes by increasing virus and bacteria reductions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28752929>Progesterone-mediated angiogenic activity of endothelial progenitor cell and angiogenesis in traumatic brain injury rats were antagonized by progesterone receptor antagonist.</a></h2><p>Progesterone (P4) has the potential therapeutic effects for traumatic brain injury (TBI) whose recovery depended on the enhanced angiogenesis. Endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) plays an essential role in vascular biology. We previously demonstrated that P4 administration improved circulating EPC level and neurological recovery of rat with TBI. Here, we hypothesized that P4 augmented angiogenic potential of EPC and the angiogenesis-related neurorestoration after TBI through classical progesterone receptor (PR).EPC derived from rats were stimulated with graded concentrations (0, 10 , 10 , 5 × 10 , 10 , 10  mol/L) of P4 or 10  mol/L ulipristal  (UPA, a PR antagonist). Male rats were subjected to cortical impact injury and treated with (i) DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), (ii) P4 and (iii) P4 and UPA.It showed that P4 improved the angiogenic potential of EPC, including tube formation, adhesion, migration and vascular endothelial growth factor secretion, in a dose-dependent fashion with the maximal effect achieved at 10  mol/L P4. High concentration (10  mol/L) of P4 impaired the angiogenic potential of EPC. Notably, 10  mol/L UPA antagonized the stimulatory effects of 10 mol/L P4. After administrating P4, a significant improvement of neurological  and the restoration of the leaked blood-brain  were observed as well as a reduction of the brain water content. Both vessel density and expression of occludin of vessels were increased. When UPA was administered with P4, the neural restoration and angiogenesis were all reversed. Western blot showed that 10  mol/L P4 increased the content of PRA and PRB of EPC, while 10  mol/L P4 reduced the content of both PR isoforms, but there was no change found in the TBI rats.It may suggest that P4-mediated angiogenic activity of EPC and angiogenesis in TBI rats were antagonized by PR antagonist.© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p></html>
