The involvement of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) in necroptosis has not been studied.We performed experiments in mice with an  deletion in collecting duct (CD) principal cells (PCs), and cultured tubular epithelial cells treated with an ILK inhibitor or ILK siRNA knockdown. deletion in CD PCs resulted in acute tubular injury and early mortality in mice. Progressive interstitial fibrosis and inflammation associated with the activation of the canonical TGF- signaling cascade were detected in the kidneys of the mice lacking ILK in the CD PCs. In contrast to the minimal apoptosis detected in the animals' injured CDs, widespread necroptosis was present in ILK-deficient PCs, characterized by cell swelling, deformed , and rupture of plasma membrane. In addition, ILK deficiency resulted in increased expression and activation of necroptotic proteins MLKL and RIPK3, and membrane translocation of MLKL in CD PCs. ILK inhibition and siRNA knockdown reduced cell survival in cultured tubular cells, concomitant with increased membrane accumulation of MLKL and/or phospho-MLKL. Administration of a necroptosis inhibitor, necrostatin-1, blocked cell death  and significantly attenuated inflammation, interstitial fibrosis, and renal failure in ILK-deficient mice.The study demonstrates the critical involvement of ILK in necroptosis through modulation of the RIPK3 and MLKL pathway and highlights the contribution of CD PC injury to the development of inflammation and interstitial fibrosis of the kidney.Copyright © 2019 by the American Society of Nephrology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669621>In silico simulation of reversible and irreversible swelling of : the role of membrane rigidity.</a></h2><p> have been widely accepted as the main source of ATP in the cell. The inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) is important for the maintenance of ATP production and other functions of . The electron transport chain (ETC) generates an electrochemical gradient of protons known as the proton-motive force across the IMM and thus produces the mitochondrial membrane potential that is critical to ATP synthesis. One of the main factors regulating the structural and functional integrity of the IMM is the changes in the matrix volume. Mild (reversible) swelling regulates mitochondrial metabolism and function; however, excessive (irreversible) swelling causes mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. The central mechanism of mitochondrial swelling includes the opening of non-selective channels known as permeability transition pores (PTPs) in the IMM by high mitochondrial Ca and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The mechanisms of reversible and irreversible mitochondrial swelling and transition between these two states are still unknown. The present study elucidates an upgraded biophysical model of reversible and irreversible mitochondrial swelling dynamics. The model provides a description of the PTP regulation dynamics using an additional differential equation. The rigidity tensor was used in numerical simulations of the mitochondrial parameter dynamics with different initial conditions defined by Ca concentration in the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum. We were able to estimate the values of the IMM rigidity tensor components by fitting the model to the previously reported experimental data. Overall, the model provides a better description of the reversible and irreversible mitochondrial swelling dynamics.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and  Research Society.

This condition is life-threatening. In contrast, a ketogenic diet, achieving plasma levels of ketone bodies of about 4-5 mM, can be used for treating different brain diseases. However, the factors leading to the conversion of the neuroprotective ketone bodies' action to the neurotoxic action during ketoacidosis are still unknown. We investigated the influence of high concentration (25 mM) of the main ketone body, β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), on intrasynaptosomal pH (pHi), synaptic vesicle cycle, plasma membrane, and mitochondrial potentials. Using the fluorescent dye BCECF-AM, it was shown that BHB at concentrations of 8 and 25 mM did not influence pHi in synaptosomes. By means of the fluorescent dye acridine orange, it was demonstrated that 25 mM of BHB had no effect on exocytosis but inhibited compensatory endocytosis by 5-fold. Increasing buffer capacity with 25 mM HEPES did not affect endocytosis. Glucose abolished BHB-induced endocytosis inhibition. Using the fluorescent dye DiSC3(5), it was shown that 25 mM of BHB induced a significant plasma membrane depolarization. This effect was not impacted by glucose. Using the fluorescent dye rhodamine-123, it was shown that BHB alone (25 mМ) did not alter the potential of intrasynaptosomal .Importantly, the high concentration of BHB (25 mМ) causes the depolarization of the plasma membrane and stronger inhibition of endocytosis compared with the intermediate concentration (8 mM).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648943>Tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme activities in a mouse model of methylmalonic aciduria.</a></h2><p>Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) is a propionate pathway disorder caused by dysfunction of the mitochondrial enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MMUT). MMUT catalyzes the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, an anaplerotic reaction which feeds into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. As part of the pathological mechanisms of MMA, previous studies have suggested there is decreased TCA activity due to a "toxic inhibition" of TCA cycle enzymes by MMA related metabolites, in addition to reduced anaplerosis. Here, we have utilized  isolated from livers of a mouse model of MMA (Mut-ko/ki) and their littermate controls (Ki/wt) to examine the amounts and enzyme functions of most of the TCA cycle enzymes. We have performed mRNA quantification, protein semi-quantitation, and enzyme activity quantification for TCA cycle enzymes in these samples. Expression profiling showed increased mRNA levels of fumarate hydratase in the Mut-ko/ki samples, which by contrast had reduced protein levels as detected by immunoblot, while all other mRNA levels were unaltered. Immunoblotting also revealed decreased protein levels of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase 2. Interesting, the decreased protein amount of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase was reflected in decreased activity for this enzyme while there is a trend towards decreased activity of fumarate hydratase and malate dehydrogenase 2. Citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase 2/3, succinyl-CoA synthase, and succinate dehydrogenase are not statistically different in terms of quantity of enzyme or activity. Finally, we found decreased activity when examining the function of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase in series with succinate synthase and succinate dehydrogenase in the Mut-ko/ki mice compared to their littermate controls, as expected. This study demonstrates decreased activity of certain TCA cycle enzymes and by corollary decreased TCA cycle function, but it supports decreased protein quantity rather than "toxic inhibition" as the underlying mechanism of action. SUMMARY: Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) is an inborn metabolic disorder of propionate catabolism. In this disorder, toxic metabolites are considered to be the major pathogenic mechanism for acute and long-term complications. However, despite optimized therapies aimed at reducing metabolite levels, patients continue to suffer from late complications, including metabolic stroke and renal insufficiency. Since the propionate pathway feeds into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, we investigated TCA cycle function in a constitutive MMA mouse model. We demonstrated decreased amounts of the TCA enzymes, Mdh2 and Ogdh as semi-quantified by immunoblot. Enzymatic activity of Ogdh is also decreased in the MMA mouse model compared to controls. Thus, when the enzyme amounts are decreased, we see the enzymatic activity also decreased to a similar extent for Ogdh. Further studies to elucidate the structural and/or functional links between the TCA cycle and propionate pathways might lead to new treatment approaches for MMA patients.Copyright © 2019.

TMEM70 absence causes severe ATP-synthase deficiency and leads to a neonatal mitochondrial encephalocardiomyopathy in humans. However, the exact biochemical function of TMEM70 remains unknown. Using TMEM70 conditional knockout in mice, we show that absence of TMEM70 impairs the early stage of enzyme biogenesis by preventing incorporation of hydrophobic subunit c into rotor structure of the enzyme. This results in the formation of an incomplete, pathologic enzyme complex consisting of F domain and peripheral stalk but lacking F proton channel composed of subunits c and a. We demonstrated direct interaction between TMEM70 and subunit c and showed that overexpression of subunit c in  cells partially rescued TMEM70 defect. Accordingly, TMEM70 knockdown prevented subunit c accumulation otherwise observed in F-deficient cells. Altogether, we identified TMEM70 as specific ancillary factor for subunit c. The biologic role of TMEM70 is to increase the low efficacy of spontaneous assembly of subunit c oligomer, the key and rate-limiting step of ATP-synthase biogenesis, and thus to reach an adequately high physiologic level of ATP synthase in mammalian tissues.-Kovalčíková, J., Vrbacký, M., Pecina, P., Tauchmannová, K., Nůsková, H., Kaplanová, V., Brázdová, A., Alán, L., Eliáš, J., Čunátová, K., Kořínek, V., Sedlacek, R., Mráček, T., Houštěk, J.

For instance, at the cellular level, the viscosity of subcellular organelles (, lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, nucleus, etc.) is much greater than that of cytoplasm; at the organismal level, compared with normal states of health, blood or lymphatic fluid viscosity will increase to some extent in diabetes, hypertension, inflammation, tumors and so on. However, due to the design shortcoming, there is a lack of efficient tool for detecting biomolecules in viscous living systems. Herein, we propose a rational design strategy for constructing ratiometric fluorescent probes with superior response signal-to-background (S/B) ratio in viscous systems based on rigid-fluorophore-molecular rotor platform, and a practical sulfur dioxide (SO2) probe (RFC-MRC) based on conmarin-cyanine dyad was prepared as a proof-of-concept. The probe performs a significant enhancement (71.5-fold) of ratiometric response signal stimulated by SO2 in viscous aqueous media. The cationic probe can selectively in  and was successfully utilized to sense SO2 in living HeLa cells through ratiometric fluorescence imaging. What's more, in the fluorescence imaging experiments of monitoring SO2 in apoptotic cells using probe RFC-MRC, a more obvious superior of S/B ratio was observed in the early apoptotic cells than in the lately apoptotic cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651552>A Novel Approach to Investigating Brain Waste Removal in Humans.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671682>Syntaxin-17-Dependent Mitochondrial Dynamics is Essential for Protection Against Oxidative-Stress-Induced Apoptosis.</a></h2><p>In this study, cell death induced by the oxidant tert-butylhydroperoxide (tBH) was observed in UOS cells; this phenotype was rescued by Syntaxin 17 (STX17) knockout (KO) but the mechanism is unknown. STX17 plays dual roles in autophagosome-lysosome fusion and mitochondrial fission. However, the contribution of the two functions of STX17 to apoptosis has not been extensively studied. Here, we sought to dissect the dual roles of STX17 in oxidative-stress-induced apoptosis by taking advantage of STX17 knockout cells and an autophagosome-lysosome fusion defective mutant of STX17. We generated STX17 knockout UOS cells using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system and the STX17 knockout cells were reconstituted with wild-type STX17 and its autophagosome-lysosome fusion defective mutant.

Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and mitochondrial dynamics were examined by staining the different indicator proteins. Apoptosis was evaluated by caspase cleavage assay. The general reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected by flow cytometry. In STX17 complete knockout cells, sealed autophagosomes were efficiently formed but their fusion with lysosomes was less defective.

STX17 knockout cells were highly resistant to oxidative stress, largely due to the function of STX17 in mitochondrial fission rather than autophagy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659873>Muscle Insulin Resistance in Youth with Obesity and Normoglycemia is Associated with Altered Fat Metabolism.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to phenotype and compare adipose, hepatic, and muscle insulin sensitivity (IS) in a diet- and physical activity-controlled cohort of normoglycemic youth with obesity with that of participants without obesity (controls) to distinguish early metabolic abnormalities in pediatric obesity.Thirty-eight participants (17 in the control group [BMI < 85th percentile] and 21 youth with obesity [BMI ≥ 95th percentile]; age: 12-21 years; 76% female; Tanner stage 4-5; sedentary) were enrolled.

The results of C8G hepatotoxicity proteomics shows that, a total of 773 differentially expressed proteins were screened and analyzed using GO analysis and Pathway enrichment analysis. Our results show that C8G can lead to abnormal oxidative phosphorylation by inhibiting the function of mitochondrial complexes, resulting in decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), and eventually resulting in mitochondrial damage and apoptosis. Western blot results verified the accuracy of quantitative proteomic results, and also evaluated the expression of Bax, caspase-3, -8, -9, Bcl-2, Cyt C in the  and cytosolic. The mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes activity assay result also confirmed that C8G could inhibit the activity of all mitochondrial complexes.

Biogenesis, maintenance, and functions of  require correct assembly of resident proteins and lipids, which require their transport into and within . Mitochondrial normal functions also require an exchange of small metabolites between the cytosol and , which is primarily mediated by a metabolite channel of the outer membrane (OM) called porin or voltage-dependent anion channel. Here, we describe recently revealed novel roles of porin in the mitochondrial protein and lipid transport. First, porin regulates the formation of the mitochondrial protein import gate in the OM, the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex, and its dynamic exchange between the major form of a trimer and the minor form of a dimer. The TOM complex dimer lacks a core subunit Tom22 and mediates the import of a subset of mitochondrial proteins while the TOM complex trimer facilitates the import of most other mitochondrial proteins. Second, porin interacts with both a translocating inner membrane (IM) protein like a carrier protein accumulated at the small TIM chaperones in the intermembrane space and the TIM22 complex, a downstream translocator in the IM for the carrier protein import. Porin thereby facilitates the efficient transfer of carrier proteins to the IM during their import. Third, porin facilitates the transfer of lipids between the OM and IM and promotes a back-up pathway for the cardiolipin synthesis in . Thus, porin has roles more than the metabolite transport in the protein and lipid transport into and within , which is likely conserved from yeast to human.© 2019 The Author(s).

Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are highly conserved across species and play major roles in mounting the stress response. The emerging information now suggests that Hsp90 family of chaperones display additional cellular roles contributing to diseases like cancer. For this reason, pharmacological targeting of Hsp90 has emerged as a novel antitumor strategy. However, its mitochondrial homologue TRAP1 has not been implicated in cancer with conclusive mechanistic insights. Since understanding the mutational spectrum of cancer cells indicates the outcome of the disease as well as treatment response, we examined mutational spectrum of TRAP1. Our in silico analyses of TRAP1 SNPs and CNVs correlated with the aggressive cancer phenotypes, and are found to be predominant over Hsp90 itself. The increased CNVs have been correlated with increased expression of TRAP1 in metastatic cancer cells, increased ATP production, and decreased oxygen consumption rate of . Examining TRAP1 knockdown as well as over expression in metastatic cancer cells furthered our understanding that TRAP1 likely to facilitate the altered energy metabolism in the functional compromise of mitochondrial OXPHOS. Interestingly, the increased ATP levels in the TRAP1 background are found to be independent of glucose oxidation. Our results suggest TRAP1 role in triggering the alternate energy metabolism in cancer cells. Since targeting tumor metabolism is considered as an alternate strategy to combat cancer, we propose pharmacological targeting of TRAP1 to target alternate energy metabolism.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and  Research Society.

We found 3-fold more variants and up to 9-fold more heteroplasmic regions in tumor when compared to paired IC samples. Moreover, tumor presented more heteroplasmic variants when compared to EC, while IC and EC showed no significant difference when compared to each other. Tumor also presented substantially more variants in the following regions: MT-RNR1, MT-ND5, MT-ND4, MT-ND2, MT-DLOOP1 and MT-CO1.

SIRT1 is a metabolic sensor of cellular energy and exerts essential functions on energy metabolism, oxidative stress response, apoptosis, or aging. Importantly, SIRT1 deacetylates the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1α (PGC-1α), the master regulator of energy metabolism involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid utilization. However, the exact role of SIRT1 in controlling cardiac energy metabolism is still incompletely understood and conflicting results have been obtained. We generated a cardio-specific inducible model of Sirt1 gene deletion in mice () to decipher the role of SIRT1 in control conditions and following cardiac stress induced by pressure overload. SIRT1 deficiency induced a progressive cardiac dysfunction, without overt alteration in mitochondrial content or properties. Sixteen weeks after  deletion an increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and a higher rate of oxidative damage were observed, suggesting disruption of the ROS production/detoxification balance.

While the effects of Condensin II depletion on nuclear genome organization are well-studied, effects on essential cytoplasmic and metabolic processes are not as well understood. Excitingly, we observe that Condensin II Chromosome Associated Protein (CAP) subunits individually localize to different regions of , suggesting possible mitochondrial-specific functions independent from the canonical Condensin II holocomplex. Changes in cellular ATP levels and mitochondrial respiration are observed in Condensin II CAP subunit-deficient cells. Surprisingly, we find that loss of NCAPD3 also sensitizes cells to oxidative stress. Together, these studies identify new, and possibly independent, roles for Condensin II CAP subunits in preventing mitochondrial damage and dysfunction. These findings reveal a new area of Condensin protein research that could contribute to the identification of targets to treat diseases where aberrant function of Condensin II proteins is implicated.© 2019.

Quantitative iTRAQ analyses were performed to examine proteomic changes in rainbow trout stimulated with physiological concentrations of cortisol and cortisol-BSA, a membrane-impermeable cortisol conjugate.

Functional clustering analysis revealed an upregulation of proteins associated with  and oxidative phosphorylation. These results were validated by Western blot analysis. Additionally, using rainbow trout myotubes, the participation of membrane glucocorticoid receptors in gene expression was evaluated. The results obtained suggest that cortisol acts through a membrane canonical glucocorticoid receptor and mediates the expression of proteins associated with mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, inactivation of POR1, encoding VDAC1, produces defective growth in the presence of non-fermentable carbon source. Here, we characterized the whole-genome expression pattern of a VDAC1-null strain (Δpor1) by microarray analysis, discovering that the expression of mitochondrial genes was completely abolished, as consequence of the dramatic reduction of mtDNA. To overcome organelle dysfunction, Δpor1 cells do not activate the rescue signaling retrograde response, as ρ cells, and rather carry out complete metabolic rewiring. The TCA cycle works in a "branched" fashion, shunting intermediates towards mitochondrial pyruvate generation via malic enzyme, and the glycolysis-derived pyruvate is pushed towards cytosolic utilization by PDH bypass rather than the canonical mitochondrial uptake. Overall, Δpor1 cells enhance phospholipid biosynthesis, accumulate lipid droplets, increase vacuoles and cell size, overproduce and excrete inositol.

Here, we investigated mechanisms through which PE21 delays yeast chronological aging and extends yeast longevity. We show that PE21 causes a remodeling of lipid metabolism in chronologically aging yeast, thereby instigating changes in the concentrations of several lipid classes. We demonstrate that such changes in the cellular lipidome initiate three mechanisms of aging delay and longevity extension. The first mechanism through which PE21 slows aging and prolongs longevity consists in its ability to decrease the intracellular concentration of free fatty acids. This postpones an age-related onset of liponecrotic cell death promoted by excessive concentrations of free fatty acids. The second mechanism of aging delay and longevity extension by PE21 consists in its ability to decrease the concentrations of triacylglycerols and to increase the concentrations of glycerophospholipids within the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. This activates the unfolded protein response system in the endoplasmic reticulum, which then decelerates an age-related decline in protein and lipid homeostasis and slows down an aging-associated deterioration of cell resistance to stress. The third mechanisms underlying aging delay and longevity extension by PE21 consists in its ability to change lipid concentrations in the mitochondrial membranes. This alters certain catabolic and anabolic processes in , thus amending the pattern of aging-associated changes in several key aspects of mitochondrial functionality.Copyright: © 2019 Medkour et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666868>Synthesis of a dihalogenated pyridinyl silicon rhodamine for mitochondrial imaging by a halogen dance rearrangement.</a></h2><p> Since their first synthesis, silicon xanthenes and the subsequently developed silicon rhodamines (SiR) gained a lot of attention as attractive fluorescence dyes offering a broad field of application.

Therefore, we sought to investigate the -targeted methylglyoxal scavenger, MitoGamide, in an experimental model of spontaneous diabetic cardiomyopathy.Male 6-week-old Akita or wild type mice received daily oral gavage of MitoGamide or vehicle for 10 weeks. Several morphological and systemic parameters were assessed, as well as cardiac function by echocardiography.Akita mice were smaller in size than wild type counterparts in terms of body weight and tibial length. Akita mice exhibited elevated blood glucose and glycated haemoglobin. Total heart and individual ventricles were all smaller in Akita mice. None of the aforementioned parameters was impacted by MitoGamide treatment. Echocardiographic analysis confirmed that cardiac dimensions were smaller in Akita hearts. Diastolic dysfunction was evident in Akita mice, and notably, MitoGamide treatment preferentially improved several of these markers, including e'/a' ratio and E/e' ratio.Our findings suggest that MitoGamide, a novel -targeted approach, offers cardioprotection in experimental diabetes and therefore may offer therapeutic potential for the treatment of cardiomyopathy in patients with diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673096> damaged by Oxygen Glucose Deprivation can be Restored through Activation of the PI3K/Akt Pathway and Inhibition of Calcium Influx by Amlodipine Camsylate.</a></h2><p>Amlodipine, a L-type calcium channel blocker, has been reported to have a neuroprotective effect in brain ischemia. Mitochondrial calcium overload leads to apoptosis of cells in neurologic diseases. We evaluated the neuroprotective effects of amlodipine camsylate (AC) on neural stem cells (NSCs) injured by oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) with a focus on mitochondrial structure and function. NSCs were isolated from rodent embryonic brains. Effects of AC on cell viability, proliferation, level of free radicals, and expression of intracellular signaling proteins were assessed in OGD-injured NSCs. We also investigated the effect of AC on mitochondrial structure in NSCs under OGD by transmission electron microscopy. AC increased the viability and proliferation of NSCs. This beneficial effect of AC was achieved by strong protection of . AC markedly enhanced the expression of mitochondrial biogenesis-related proteins and mitochondrial anti-apoptosis proteins.

This study examined whether PKCα regulates recovery of mitochondrial and kidney functions after ischemia-induced acute injury (AKI) in vivo. Markers of kidney injury were increased after bilateral ischemia and returned to normal levels in wild-type (WT) mice. Maximum mitochondrial respiration and activities of respiratory complexes and F F -ATPase decreased after ischemia and recovered in WT mice. Reperfusion after ischemia was accompanied by translocation of active PKCα to . PKCα deletion reduced mitochondrial respiration and activities of respiratory complex I and F F -ATPase in non-injured kidneys, indicating that PKCα is essential in developing fully functional renal . These changes in PKCα-deficient mice were accompanied by lower levels of complex I subunits (NDUFA9 and NDUFS3) and the γ-subunit of F F -ATPase. Also, lack of PKCα exacerbated ischemia-induced decreases in respiration, complex I and F F -ATPase activities, and blocked their recovery after injury, indicating a crucial role of PKCα in promoting mitochondrial recovery after AKI. Further, PKCα deletion exacerbated acetylation and succinylation of key mitochondrial proteins of energy metabolism after ischemia due to decreases in deacetylase and desuccinylase (sirtuin3 and sirtuin5) levels in renal . Thus, our data show a novel role for PKCα in regulating levels of mitochondrial sirtuins and acetylation and succinylation of key mitochondrial proteins. We conclude that PKCα deletion: 1) affects renal physiology by decreasing mitochondrial capacity for maximum respiration, 2) blocks recovery of mitochondrial functions, renal morphology and functions after AKI, and 3) decreases survival after AKI.© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649242>Leishmania donovani parasite requires Atg8 protein for infectivity and survival under stress.</a></h2><p>The importance of autophagy in parasites with a digenetic life cycle like Leishmania spp. is significant. The parasite survives as promastigotes in the insect gut and as immotile amastigotes in mammals. This study demonstrates increased autophagy in Leishmania parasite during progression of in vitro life cycle and upon exposure to stress stimuli like starvation, oxidative stress, and drugs. Autophagy inhibition during stress exposure increased cell death, indicating the importance of autophagy in cellular defense against adverse conditions. Atg8 protein, a homolog of mammalian autophagy protein LC3 is expressed in Leishmania parasite but its function remains unknown. Overexpression of Atg8 (Atg8-OE) rendered the parasites resistant to stress and capable of infecting macrophages in substantial numbers; however, disruption of the Atg8 gene (ΔAtg8) resulting in suppression of Atg8 protein expression, increased susceptibility to stress and reduced the capability to cause infection. A critical event in the Leishmania parasite lifecycle is the differentiation of promastigote forms to the disease causing amastigote forms. The failure of ΔAtg8 parasites lacking Atg8 protein to differentiate into amastigotes, unlike the Atg8-OE and vector-transfected parasites, clearly indicated Atg8 involvement in a crucial event. The inability of ΔAtg8 parasites to infect macrophages in vitro was verified in an in vivo mouse model of leishmaniases where infection could not be induced by the ΔAtg8 parasites. Autophagy is known to be involved in the remodeling of damaged organelles. The accumulation of Atg8 around damaged  suggested increase of autophagy in the vicinity of the organelle. This buildup was prevented when  generated reactive oxygen species that were quenched, suggesting them as possible signaling molecules for sensing mitochondrial instability. In summary, our study provides new evidences for a crucial role of Atg8 protein in sustaining Leishmania parasite survival during life cycle and stress exposure, differentiation to amastigotes, and their infective abilities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669623>Ironing the : Relevance to its dynamics.</a></h2><p>The mitochondrion is "jack of many trades and master of one". Despite being a master in energy generation, it plays a significant role in other cellular processes, including calcium homeostasis, cell death, and iron metabolism. Since  employ the majority of cellular iron, it plays a central role in the iron homeostasis. Iron could be a major regulator of mitochondrial dynamics as the excess of iron leads to oxidative stress, which causes a disturbance in mitochondrial dynamics. Remarkably, abnormal iron accumulation has been observed in the brain regions of the neurodegenerative disorders patients. These neurodegenerative disorders are also often associated with the abnormal mitochondrial dynamics.

In the current study, we show that crd1Δ cells exhibit decreased levels of glutamate and cysteine and are deficient in the essential antioxidant, glutathione, a tripeptide of glutamate, cysteine, and glycine. Glutathione is the most abundant non-protein thiol essential for maintaining intracellular redox potential in almost all eukaryotes, including yeast. Consistent with glutathione deficiency, the growth defect of crd1Δ cells at elevated temperature was rescued by supplementation of glutathione or glutamate and cysteine. Sensitivity to the oxidants iron (FeSO) and hydrogen peroxide (HO), was rescued by supplementation of glutathione. The decreased intracellular glutathione concentration in crd1Δ was restored by supplementation of glutamate and cysteine, but not by overexpressing YAP1, an activator of expression of glutathione biosynthetic enzymes. These findings show for the first time that CL plays a critical role in regulating intracellular glutathione metabolism.Copyright © 2019.

Here, we find a newly synthesized flavonoid named GL-V9, which inhibits glycolysis and induces apoptosis of human breast cancer cell lines, and investigate the underlying mechanism. Results show that hexokinase II (HKII) plays important roles in the anticancer effects of GL-V9. GL-V9 not only downregulates the expression of HKII in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, but also induces dissociation of HKII from voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) in , resulting in glycolytic inhibition and mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. The dissociation of mitochondrial HKII is attributed to GSK-3β-induced phosphorylation of mitochondrial VDAC. Our in vivo experiments also show that GL-V9 significantly inhibits the growth of human breast cancer due to activation of GSK-3β and inactivation of AKT. Thus, GL-V9 induces cytotoxicity in breast cancer cells via disrupting the mitochondrial binding of HKII.

They participate in the transport, sorting, storage, recycling, degradation, and release of multiple substances. They interchange cargo with other organelles and participate in their renovation and degradation. We have used focused ion beam milling and scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) to obtain stacks of serial sections from the neuropil of the somatosensory cortex of the juvenile rat. Using dedicated software, we have 3D-reconstructed 1618 MVBs. The mean density of MVBs was 0.21 per cubic micron. They were unequally distributed between dendrites (39.14%), axons (18.16%), and nonsynaptic cell processes (42.70%). About one out of five MVBs (18.16%) were docked on , representing the process by which the endosomal pathway participates in mitochondrial maintenance. Other features of MVBs, such as the presence of tubular protrusions (6.66%) or clathrin coats (19.74%) can also be interpreted in functional terms, since both are typical of early endosomes. The sizes of MVBs follow a lognormal distribution, with differences across cortical layers and cellular compartments.

Thus, it might be a good strategy to decrease oxidative stress and improve mitochondrial changes in skeletal muscle. In the present study, we investigate the role of the most biologically active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) in oxidative stress and mitochondrial changes in tertiary butyl-hydrogen (tBHP)-treated C2C12 muscle cells. Differentiated C2C12 muscle cells were pretreated with tBHP, followed by 1,25(OH)2D for additional 24 h. An exogenous inducer of oxidative stress, tBHP significantly increased oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, intracellular damage, and cell death which were reversed by 1,25(OH)2D in C2C12 myotubes. 1.25(OH)2D improves tBHP-induced mitochondrial morphological changes such as swelling, irregular cristae, and smaller size and number, as observed by transmission electron microscope. In addition, 1,25(OH)2D treatment increases mtDNA contents as well as gene expression involved in mitochondrial biogenesis such as PGC1α, NRF1, and Tfam. Significant increments in mRNA levels related to antioxidant enzymes such as Nrf2, HMOX1, and TXNRD1, myogenic differentiation markers including myoglobin, muscle creatine kinase (MCK), and MHCІ and ІІ, and vitamin D metabolism such as CYP24, CYP27, and vitamin D receptor (VDR) were found in 1,25(OH)2D-treated myotubes. Moreover, upon t-BHP-induced oxidative stress, significant incremental changes in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) levels, activities of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/sirtulin 1 (SIRT1), and SIRT1 expression were noted in 1,25(OH)2D-treated C2C12 muscle cells. Taken together, these results suggest the observed potent inhibitory effect of 1,25(OH)2D on muscle oxidative stress and mitochondrial dynamics might be at least involved in the activation of AMPK and SIRT1 activation in muscle cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666474>The Effects of BCAAs on Insulin Resistance in Athletes.</a></h2><p>The toxic catabolic intermediates of branched chain amino acids can cause insulin resistance, and are involved in different mechanisms in different metabolic tissues. In skeletal muscle, 3-hydroxy-isobutyrate produced by valine promotes skeletal muscle fatty acid uptake, resulting in the accumulation of incompletely oxidized lipids in skeletal muscle, causing skeletal muscle insulin resistance. In the liver, branched-chain α-keto acids decompose in large amounts, promote hepatic gluconeogenesis, and lead to the accumulation of multiple acylcarnitines, which damages the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle, resulting in the accumulation of incomplete oxidation products, oxidative stress in , and hepatic insulin resistance. In adipose tissue, the expression of branched-chain amino acid catabolic enzymes (branched-chain amino acid transaminase, branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase) is reduced, resulting in an increased level of plasma branched-chain amino acids, thereby causing massive decomposition of branched-chain amino acids in tissues such as skeletal muscle and liver, and inducing insulin resistance. However, branched-chain amino acids, as a common nutritional supplement for athletes, do not induce insulin resistance. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that exercise can enhance the mitochondrial oxidative potential of branched-chain amino acids, alleviate or even eliminate the accumulation of branched-chain amino acid catabolic intermediates, and promotes branched-chain amino acids catabolism into beta-aminoisobutyric acid, increasing plasma beta-aminoisobutyric acid concentration, improving insulin resistance.

The exosome markers, cluster of differentiation 63 (CD63) and tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101), were positively expressed in intestinal villi during turtle hibernation. The distribution and formation processes of MVBs and exosomes in turtle MRCs, GCs, and ACs were further confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. During hibernation, abundantly secreted early endosomes (ees) were localized in the luminal and basal cytoplasm of the MRCs and ACs, and late endosomes (les) were dispersed with the supranuclear parts of the MRCs and ACs. Many "heterogeneous" MVBs were identified throughout the cytoplasm of the MRCs and ACs. Interestingly, the ees, les, and MVBs were detected in the cytoplasm of the GCs during hibernation; however, they were absent during nonhibernation. Furthermore, the exocytosis pathways of exosomes and autophagic vacuoles were observed in the MRCs, GCs, and ACs during hibernation. In addition, the number of different MVBs with intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) and heterogeneous endosome-MVB-exosome complexes was significantly increased in the MRCs, GCs, and ACs during hibernation. All these findings indicate that intestinal epithelial cells potentially perform a role in the secretion of MVBs and exosomes, which are essential for mucosal immunity, during hibernation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648561>KLF15-activating Twist2 ameliorated hepatic steatosis by inhibiting inflammation and improving mitochondrial dysfunction  NF-κB-FGF21 or SREBP1c-FGF21 pathway.</a></h2><p>Twist-related protein 2 (TWIST2) is identified as a basic helix-loop-helix (b-HLH) transcription repressor by dimerizing with other b-HLH proteins. The significance of TWIST2 has been emphasized in various tumors; however, few studies report its functions in metabolism and metabolic diseases. Here we aimed to explore the novel role and regulation mechanism of TWIST2 in hepatic steatosis. Our results showed that  knockdown caused mice obesity, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis, which were accompanied with inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. , TWIST2 overexpression ameliorated hepatocellular steatosis, inhibited inflammation, and improved mitochondrial content and function with a fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21)-dependent pattern. NF-κB negatively regulated FGF21 transcription by directly binding to  promoter DNA, which was eliminated by TWIST2 overexpression by inhibiting NF-κB expression and translocation to nucleus. TWIST2 overexpression decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species level, increased mitochondrial DNA and biogenesis, and enhanced ATP production and antioxidation ability. Additionally, TWIST2 expression was repressed by insulin-targeting sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) and forkhead box protein O1 and was enhanced by dexamethasone targeting Krüppel-like factor 15, which directly interacted with  promoter DNA.

The regulatory mechanisms of these two processes share B-cell lymphoma-2 family proteins and AMBRA1, which are present in both the endoplasmic reticulum and . B-cell lymphoma-2 family proteins sense different stresses and interact with AMBRA1 to regulate autophagy and apoptosis, which are respectively mediated by Beclin1 and Caspases. Therefore, we investigated how different levels of stress on B-cell lymphoma-2 family proteins that bind to AMBRA1 in the endoplasmic reticulum and  regulate the switch from autophagy to apoptosis.In this paper, we considered the responses of B-cell lymphoma-2 family proteins, which bind to AMBRA1 in both the endoplasmic reticulum and , to two different levels of stress in a model originally proposed by Kapuy et al. We investigated how these two stress levels affect the transition from autophagy to apoptosis and their effects on apoptosis activation over time. Additionally, we analyzed how the feedback regulation in this model affects the bifurcation diagrams of two levels of stress and cell fate decisions between autophagy and apoptosis.Autophagy is activated for minor stress in  regardless of endoplasmic reticulum stress, while apoptosis is activated for only significant stress in . Apoptosis is only sensitive to  stress. The time duration before apoptosis activation is longer in the presence of high AMBRA1 levels with high endoplasmic reticulum and  stress. AMBRA1 can compete with B-cell lymphoma-2 family proteins to bind and activate Beclin1 and thus promote the autophagy process for a long time before apoptosis. Furthermore, apoptosis is prone to occur with increasing activation of Caspases, inactivation of Beclin1-A and the Michaelis constant of Caspases.A novel mathematical model has been developed to understand the complex regulatory mechanisms of autophagy and apoptosis.

It is a symptom of many chronic diseases, including cancer, liver failure, congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease, and there is as yet no effective treatment. While the mechanisms underlying cachexia are complex, it is often accompanied by elevated angiotensin II (Ang II). Human placental extract (HPE) is a source of numerous biologically active molecules and has been used clinically to treat chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and other chronic diseases. Here, we investigated the effects of HPE in an Ang II-induced cachexia model in mice. HPE treatment preserved both fat mass and lean body mass and suppressed weight loss in the cachexia model, though food intake was unaffected. Ang II infusion also caused cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. HPE suppressed these effects as well as Ang II-induced cardiac expression of genes related to heart failure and cardiac remodeling.

Mitochondrial dysfunction and elevated oxidative stress precede characteristic loss of dopamine-producing neurons from the midbrain in PD. The majority of PD cases are classified as sporadic (sPD) with an unknown etiology, whereas mutations in a handful of genes cause monogenic form called familial (fPD). Both sPD and fPD is characterized by proteinopathy and mitochondrial dysfunction leading to increased oxidative stress. These pathophysiological mechanisms create a vicious cycle feeding into each other, ultimately tipping the neurons to its demise. Effect of iron accumulation and dopamine oxidation adds an additional dimension to mitochondrial oxidative stress and apoptotic pathways affected. Nrf2 is a redox-sensitive transcription factor which regulates basal as well as inducible expression of antioxidant enzymes and proteins involved in xenobiotic detoxification. Recent advances, however, shows a multifaceted role for Nrf2 in the regulation of genes connected with inflammatory response, metabolic pathways, protein homeostasis, iron management, and mitochondrial bioenergetics.

Platelets are one of the crucial factors for hemostasis and thrombosis. In terminally differentiated MKs many molecular process such as caspase activation and a massive cytoskeletal rearrangement drive the formation of cytoplasmic extensions called proplatelets. These cytoplasmic extensions packed with granules and organelles are then released from the bone marrow into the blood circulation as platelets. Classically, caspase activation is associated with apoptosis and recent reports suggest their involvement in cell differentiation and maturation. There is no clear evidence demonstrating the stimulus for caspase activation during megakaryocyte development. In the current study, we attempted to understand the importance of endoplasmic reticulum stress in the caspase activation during megakaryocyte maturation. We used human megakaryoblstic cell line (Dami cells) as an experimental model. We induced these cells with PMA (Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) a known inducer of megakaryocyte to understand the involvement of ER stress during maturation, with increased cell size in association with ER stress induced caspase activation. We used Thapsigargin, a non-competitive inhibitor of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum CaATPase (SERCA) as a positive control to induce ER stress.Upon its treatment, we observed larger and adherent cells with the increased expression of megakaryocytic markers (CD41 and CD61) and UPR markers in PMA or Thapsigargin treated cells as compared to control. Also, Thapsigargin treatment induced increased caspase activity and PARP cleavage and showed decrease in ER calcium levels leading to reduced activity of calcium-dependent ER chaperones and accumulation of unfolded protein. The increased megakaryocyte maturation markers alongside with ER stress and caspase activation suggests the importance of ER stress in caspase activation during MK maturation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and  Research Society.

In this study, we identify the host cell factors that activate in vivo and in vitro MCF autoprocessing as ADP-Ribosylation Factor 1 (ARF1) and ADP-ribosylation Factor 3 (ARF3). Autoprocessing activity is enhanced when ARF1 is in its active (GTP-bound) form compared to the inactive (GDP-bound) form.

Acetylation apparently does not dictate subcellular localization, as MCF is found localized throughout the cell. However, the cleaved form of MCF gains the ability to bind to the specialized lipid phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate enriched in Golgi and other membranes necessary for endocytic trafficking, suggesting a fraction of MCF may be subcellular localized. Traditional thin-section electron microscopy, high-resolution cryoAPEX localization, and fluorescent microscopy show that MCF causes Golgi dispersal resulting in extensive vesiculation. In addition, host  are disrupted and fragmented. Mass spectrometry analysis found no reproducible modifications of ARF1 suggesting ARF1 is not post-translationally modified by MCF. Further, catalytically active MCF does not stably associate with ARF1. Our data indicate that ARF1 is a cross-kingdom activator of MCF, but also that MCF may mediate cytotoxicity by directly targeting another yet to be identified protein. This study begins to elucidate the biochemical activity of this important domain and gives insight into how it may promote disease progression.This article is protected by copyright.

Here, we investigated its functions on -mediated apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC-7721 cells. DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining, annexin V-fluorexcein isothiocyanate (FITC) apoptosis detection, and western blotting were applied to explore the apoptotic effect of Ivalin. Next, the induction effect of Ivalin on the mitochondrial pathway was also confirmed via a series of phenomena including the damage of  membrane potential,  cytochrome c escape, cleaved caspase-3 induction, and the reactive oxygen species generation. In this connection, we understood that Ivalin induced apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway and the overload of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, we found that the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and subsequent p53 induction were associated with the apoptotic effect of Ivalin. These data confirmed that Ivalin might be a promising pro-apoptotic compound that can be utilized as a potential drug for clinical treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658599>Redox-Mediated Mechanism of Chemoresistance in Cancer Cells.</a></h2><p>Cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) status is stabilized by a balance of ROS generation and elimination called redox homeostasis. ROS is increased by activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase family members and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis of . Increased ROS is detoxified by superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxiredoxins. ROS has a role as a secondary messenger in signal transduction. Cancer cells induce fluctuations of redox homeostasis by variation of ROS regulated machinery, leading to increased tumorigenesis and chemoresistance. Redox-mediated mechanisms of chemoresistance include endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated autophagy, increased cell cycle progression, and increased conversion to metastasis or cancer stem-like cells.

Mitochondrial dynamics, regulated by mitochondrial fission, fusion, and trafficking, ensure restructuring of this complex reticulum in response to nutrient availability, molecular signals, and cellular stress. Aberrant mitochondrial structures have long been observed in aging and age-related diseases indicating that mitochondrial dynamics are compromised as cells age. However, the specific mechanisms by which aging affects mitochondrial dynamics and whether these changes are causally or casually associated with cellular and organismal aging is not clear. Here, we review recent studies that show specifically how mitochondrial fission, fusion, and trafficking are altered with age. We discuss factors that change with age to directly or indirectly influence mitochondrial dynamics while examining causal roles for altered mitochondrial dynamics in healthy aging and underlying functional outputs that might affect longevity. Lastly, we propose that altered mitochondrial dynamics might not just be a passive consequence of aging but might constitute an adaptive mechanism to mitigate age-dependent cellular impairments and might be targeted to increase longevity and promote healthy aging.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672358>Melatonin ameliorates ochratoxin A-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in porcine oocytes.</a></h2><p>Melatonin is a hormone which is generated from pineal gland, and it is responsible for the regulation of wake-sleep cycle. Melatonin is a well-known antioxidant and free radical scavenger to protect against multiple type of tissue damage. While ochratoxin A (OTA) is a mycotoxin found widely in contaminated food and foodstuffs, which causes nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, immunotoxicity, and reproductive damage in humans and animals. In present study we report the toxicity of OTA on porcine oocyte quality and the protective effects of melatonin on OTA-exposed oocytes. Using transcriptome analysis our results show that OTA exposure alters the expression of multiple genes in oocytes, indicating its effect on oocyte maturation. The cellular changes following OTA treatment are examined, and the results show that OTA adversely affects oocyte polar body extrusion, which is confirmed by the delay of Cdc2-mediated cell cycle progression. OTA exposure also disrupts meiotic spindle formation, which is confirmed by altered phosphorylated MAPK expression. RNA-seq screening and further fluorescence staining results show that OTA induces aberrant  distribution and oxidative phosphorylation defects, which then causes oxidative stress, followed by early apoptosis and autophagy. Treatment with melatonin significantly ameliorates oxidative stress and apoptosis, which further protects cell cycle and spindle formation in OTA-exposed oocytes. Collectively, these results show the protective effects of melatonin against defects induced by OTA during porcine meiotic oocyte maturation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Ubiquinol has been increasingly reported to exert antioxidant functions, in addition to its role in the cell energy-producing system of  and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. The aim of this study was to assess the potential beneficial effects of QH on anti-fatigue and ergogenic functions following physiological challenge. Forty 8-week-old male Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were divided into four groups ( = 10 for each group): Group 1 (vehicle control or oil only); Group 2 (1X QH dose or 102.5 mg/kg); Group 3 (2X QH dose or 205 mg/kg); Group 4 (6X QH dose or 615 mg/kg). Anti-fatigue activity and exercise performance were studied using the forelimb grip strength experiment and exhaustive weight-loaded swimming time, and levels of serum lactate, ammonia, glucose, BUN (blood urea nitrogen), creatine kinase (CK), and free fatty acids (FFA) after an acute exercise challenge. The forelimb grip strength and exhaustive weight-loaded swimming time of the QH-6X group were significantly higher than those of the other groups. QH supplementation dose-dependently reduced serum lactate, ammonia, and CK levels and increased the FFA concentration after acute exercise. In addition, QH increased the liver and muscle glycogen content, an important energy source during exercise. Therefore, the results suggest that QH formulation is a safe dietary supplement for amelioration of fatigue and for promoting exercise performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661873>Comparison of Mitochondrial Superoxide Detection Ex Vivo/In Vivo by mitoSOX HPLC Method with Classical Assays in Three Different Animal Models of Oxidative Stress.</a></h2><p>Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS such as HO, nitric oxide) are generated within the organism. Whereas physiological formation rates confer redox regulation of essential cellular functions and provide the basis for adaptive stress responses, their excessive formation contributes to impaired cellular function or even cell death, organ dysfunction and severe disease phenotypes of the entire organism. Therefore, quantification of RONS formation and knowledge of their tissue/cell/compartment-specific distribution is of great biological and clinical importance.Here, we used a high-performance/pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay to quantify the superoxide-specific oxidation product of the -targeted fluorescence dye triphenylphosphonium-linked hydroethidium (mitoSOX) in biochemical systems and three animal models with established oxidative stress. Type 1 diabetes (single injection of streptozotocin), hypertension (infusion of angiotensin-II for 7 days) and nitrate tolerance (infusion of nitroglycerin for 4 days) was induced in male Wistar rats.The usefulness of mitoSOX/HPLC for quantification of mitochondrial superoxide was confirmed by xanthine oxidase activity as well as isolated stimulated rat heart  in the presence or absence of superoxide scavengers. Vascular function was assessed by isometric tension methodology and was impaired in the rat models of oxidative stress. Vascular dysfunction correlated with increased mitoSOX oxidation but also classical RONS detection assays as well as typical markers of oxidative stress.mitoSOX/HPLC represents a valid method for detection of mitochondrial superoxide formation in tissues of different animal disease models and correlates well with functional parameters and other markers of oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671122>Mitochondrial dysfunctions in leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation (LBSL).</a></h2><p>Several inherited human diseases have been linked to mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (mtARSs). Leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation (LBSL) is a leukodystrophy caused by mutations in the DARS2 gene which encodes mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase. As mitochondrial ARSs are key components of the mitochondrial translation apparatus, we investigated the effects of DARS2 mutations on mitochondrial functions and mitochondrial morphology in an LBSL patient. In fibroblasts from the patient with LBSL, biosynthesis of respiratory chain complex proteins encoded by mitochondrial DNA was decreased, while those encoded by nuclear DNA were not. Cellular oxygen consumption rates and respiratory control ratio were decreased in the LBSL patient; in addition, fragmentation of  was increased, while their tubular elongation and interconnectivity were decreased. Taken together, these findings suggest that DARS2 mutations impair translations of mitochondrial DNA-encoded respiratory chain complex proteins, consequently causing dysfunction of cellular respiration and impediment of mitochondrial dynamics, which highlights the role of mtARSs in the maintenance of normal mitochondrial bioenergetics and dynamics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654229>Evaluation of circulating leukocyte transcriptome and its relationship with immune function and blood markers in dairy cows during the transition period.</a></h2><p>Dairy cows during the transition period are faced with important physiological changes which include a dysfunctional immune system and an increased inflammatory state. New data are necessary to understand the key factors involved in the immune system regulation. Six dairy cows were sampled during transition period to investigate the leukocyte transcriptome changes and its relationship with blood biomarkers. Blood samples were collected at - 20 ± 2, - 3 ± 1, 3, and 7 days from parturition (DFP). Leukocyte transcriptome was analyzed by deep sequencing technology (Hiseq1000 Illumina, USA). Plasma was analyzed for metabolic biomarkers. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) were used to run an enrichment analysis through the Dynamic Impact Approach (DIA). Considering - 20 DFP as references time, the main KEGG impacted pathways were activated before calving (- 3 DFP) and were connected to lipid metabolism, lipid transport in plasma, and phagosome. The greatest differences were found after parturition with 281 DEG (179 upregulated and 102 downregulated). The activated pathways were mainly related to immunity and endocrine aspects, while metabolic pathways related to lipid and amino acid metabolism were inhibited. Plasma BHBA had a substantial inhibitory impact on KEGG pathways related to DNA replication and cell cycle, while plasma IL-1β had an inhibitory impact on fatty acid elongation in  and an activated impact in several pathways related to cellular energy metabolism. Overall, this study confirmed that many changes in lipid metabolism and immune competence of the circulating leukocytes occurred in dairy cow around calving.

Considering the limited efficacy and toxicity of currently available -targeting agents, it is necessary to develop effective -targeting anticancer drugs. By screening a large chemical library consisting of natural products with diverse chemical entities, we identified gracillin, a steroidal saponin, as a -targeting antitumor drug. Gracillin displayed broad-spectrum inhibitory effects on the viability of a large panel of human cancer cell lines, including those carrying acquired resistance to chemotherapy or EGFR-targeting drugs, by inducing apoptosis. We show that gracillin attenuates -mediated cellular bioenergetics by suppressing ATP synthesis and by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mechanistically, gracillin disrupts complex II (CII) function by abrogating succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity without affecting the succinate:ubiquinone reductase. The gracillin-induced cell death was potentiated by 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NPA) or thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA), which inhibit CII by binding to the active site of SDHA or to the ubiquinone-binding site, respectively. Finally, we show that gracillin effectively suppressed the mutant-Kras-driven lung tumorigenesis and the growth of xenograft tumors derived from cell lines or patient tissues. Gracillin displayed no obvious pathophysiological features in mice. Collectively, gracillin has potential as a CII-targeting antitumor drug.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669619>The Changing Landscape of Clinical Trials for Mitochondrial Diseases: 2011 to Present.</a></h2><p>We reviewed the status of interventional clinical trials for primary mitochondrial diseases.

The novel chemotherapeutic drugs are needed urgently to treat gastric cancer and cervical cancer with high anticancer activity and metabolic stability. Previously we have reported the synthesis, characterization and identification of a novel combretastatin A-4 analog, 3-(3-methoxyphenyl)-6-(3-amino-4- methoxyphenyl) -7H-[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4] thiadiazine (XSD-7). In this study, we sought to investigate its anticancer mechanisms in a human gastric cancer cell line (SGC-7901 cells) and human cervical carcinoma cell line (HeLa cells). The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay showed that XSD-7 induced cytotoxicity in SGC-7901 and HeLa cells with inhibitory concentration 50 values of 0.11 ± 0.03 and 0.12 ± 0.05 µM, respectively. Immunofluorescence studies proved that XSD-7 inhibited microtubule polymerization during cell division in SGC-7901 and HeLa cells. Then, these cells were arrested at G2/M cell cycle and subsequently progressed into apoptosis. In further study, mitochondrial membrane potential analysis and Western blot analysis demonstrated that XSD-7 treatment-induced SGC-7901 cell apoptosis via both the -mediated pathway and the death receptor-mediated pathway. In contrast, XSD-7 induced apoptosis in HeLa cells mainly via the -mediated pathway. Hence, our data indicate that XSD-7 exerted antiproliferative activity by disrupting microtubule dynamics, leading to cell cycle arrest, and eventually inducing cell apoptosis. XSD-7 with novel structure has the potential to be developed for therapeutic treatment of gastric cancer and cervical cancer.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659282>RNA binding protein HuD contributes to β-cell dysfunction by impairing  dynamics.</a></h2><p>Imbalanced mitochondrial dynamics in pancreatic β-cells contributes to β-cell dysfunction in diabetes; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial dynamics in the pathology of diabetes are not fully elucidated. We previously reported the reduction of RNA binding protein HuD in pancreatic β-cells of diabetes. Herein, we demonstrate that HuD plays a novel role in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics by promoting mitochondrial fusion. We show enhanced mitochondrial fragmentation in the pancreas of db/db mice and HuD KO mice. Downregulation of HuD increases the number of cells with fragmented  and reduces the mitochondrial activity determined by mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production in mouse insulinoma βTC6 cells. HuD binds to 3'-untraslated region of mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) mRNA and positively regulates its expression. Ectopic expression of Mfn2 in βTC6 cells stably expressing short hairpin RNA against HuD (shHuD) restores HuD-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction. Taken together, our results suggest that HuD regulates mitochondrial dynamics by regulating Mfn2 level and its reduced expression leads to mitochondrial dysfunction in pancreatic β-cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672706>Tumor protein D54 defines a new class of intracellular transport vesicles.</a></h2><p>Transport of proteins and lipids from one membrane compartment to another is via intracellular vesicles. We investigated the function of tumor protein D54 (TPD54/TPD52L2) and found that TPD54 was involved in multiple membrane trafficking pathways: anterograde traffic, recycling, and Golgi integrity. To understand how TPD54 controls these diverse functions, we used an inducible method to reroute TPD54 to . Surprisingly, this manipulation resulted in the capture of many small vesicles (30 nm diameter) at the mitochondrial surface. Super-resolution imaging confirmed the presence of similarly sized TPD54-positive structures under normal conditions. It appears that TPD54 defines a new class of transport vesicle, which we term intracellular nanovesicles (INVs). INVs meet three criteria for functionality. They contain specific cargo, they have certain R-SNAREs for fusion, and they are endowed with a variety of Rab GTPases (16 out of 43 tested). The molecular heterogeneity of INVs and the diverse functions of TPD54 suggest that INVs have various membrane origins and a number of destinations. We propose that INVs are a generic class of transport vesicle that transfer cargo between these varied locations.© 2019 Larocque et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642809>Discovery proteomics in aging human skeletal muscle finds change in spliceosome, immunity, proteostasis and .</a></h2><p>A decline of skeletal muscle strength with aging is a primary cause of mobility loss and frailty in older persons, but the molecular mechanisms of such decline are not understood. Here, we performed quantitative proteomic analysis from skeletal muscle collected from 58 healthy persons aged 20 to 87 years. In muscle from older persons, ribosomal proteins and proteins related to energetic metabolism, including those related to the TCA cycle,  respiration, and glycolysis, were underrepresented, while proteins implicated in innate and adaptive immunity, proteostasis, and alternative splicing were overrepresented. Consistent with reports in animal models, older human muscle was characterized by deranged energetic metabolism, a pro-inflammatory environment and increased proteolysis.

There is growing evidence that reprogramming of cellular lipid metabolism contributes to malignant transformation and progression. Lipid metabolism is implicated in cell differentiation and metastatic colonization and it is involved in the mechanisms of sensitivity/resistance to different anti-tumor agents. The role played by lipids in the anti-tumor activity of ATRA has never been studied.We used 16 breast cancer cell-lines whose degree of sensitivity to the anti-proliferative action of ATRA is known. We implemented a non-oriented mass-spectrometry based approach to define the lipidomic profiles of each cell-line grown under basal conditions and following treatment with ATRA. To complement the lipidomic data, untreated and retinoid treated cell-lines were also subjected to RNA-sequencing to define the perturbations afforded by ATRA on the whole-genome gene-expression profiles. The number and functional activity of  were determined in selected ATRA-sensitive and -resistant cell-lines. Bio-computing approaches were used to analyse the high-throughput lipidomic and transcriptomic data.ATRA perturbs the homeostasis of numerous lipids and the most relevant effects are observed on cardiolipins, which are located in the mitochondrial inner membranes and play a role in oxidative-phosphorylation. ATRA reduces the amounts of cardiolipins and the effect is associated with the growth-inhibitory activity of the retinoid. Down-regulation of cardiolipins is due to a reduction of , which is caused by an ATRA-dependent decrease in the expression of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. This demonstrates that ATRA anti-tumor activity is due to a decrease in the amounts of  causing deficits in the respiration/energy-balance of breast-cancer cells.The observation that ATRA anti-proliferative activity is caused by a reduction in the respiration and energy balance of the tumor cells has important ramifications for the therapeutic action of ATRA in breast cancer.

However, the effect of iron-overload on the brain of Thalassemic condition has never been investigated. An iron chelator (deferiprone) provides neuroprotective effects against metal toxicity. Furthermore, a T-type calcium channels blocker (efonidipine) effectively attenuates cardiac dysfunction in thalassemic mice with iron-overload. However, the effects of both drugs on brain of iron-overload Thalassemia has not been determined. We hypothesize that iron-overload induces neurotoxicity in Thalassemic and wild-type mice, and not only deferiprone, but also efonidipine, provides neuroprotection against iron-overload condition.Mice from both wild-type (WT) and β-thalassemic type (HT) groups were assigned to be fed with a standard-diet or high-iron diet containing 0.2% ferrocene/kg of diet (HFe) for 4 months consecutively. After three months of HFe, 75-mg/kg/d deferiprone or 4-mg/kg/d efonidipine were administered to the HFe-fed WT and HT mice for 1 month.HFe consumption caused an equal impact on circulating iron-overload, oxidative stress, and inflammation in WT and HT mice. Brain iron-overload and iron-mediated neurotoxicity, such as oxidative stress, inflammation, glial activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and Alzheimer's like pathologies, were observed to an equal degree in HFe fed WT and HT mice. These pathological conditions were mitigated by both deferiprone and efonidipine.These findings indicate that iron-overload itself caused neurotoxicity, and T-type calcium channels may play a role in this condition.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The open reading frame (ORF) of OcicCuZnSOD2 and OcMnSOD are 462 and 672 bp encoding 153 and 223 amino acids, respectively. OcicCuZnSOD2 contains two signature sequences, one potential N-glycosylation site, and seven copper/zinc binding sites. OcMnSOD includes a  targeting sequence of 7 amino acids at N-terminal, one signature sequence, two N-glycosylation sites, and four manganese binding sites. The secondary structure and homology model of OcicCuZnSOD2 include nine β sheets, two Greek-key motifs, and one electrostatic loop. OcMnSOD contains nine α-helices and three β-sheets. Phylogenetic analysis shows that OcMnSOD is evolutionarily conserved while OcicCuZnSOD2 may be gene duplication and is paralogous to OcicCuZnSOD1. OcMnSOD expressed widely in all tissues and developmental stages. OcicCuZnSOD2 showed testis-specific expression and expressed highest in the 5th-instar nymph and the adult. The optimum temperatures and pH values of the recombinant OcicCuZnSOD2 and OcMnSOD were 40 °C and 8.0. They were stable at 25-55 °C and at pH 5.0-12.0 and pH 6.0-12.0, respectively. The activity and mRNA expression of each OcSOD were assayed after chlorpyrifos treatments. Total SOD and CuZnSOD activities first increased then declined under chlorpyrifos stress. Chlorpyrifos induced the mRNA expression and activity of OcMnSOD as a dose-dependent manner and inhibited OcicCuZnSOD2 transcription. The role of each OcSOD gene in chlorpyrifos stress was investigated using RNAi and disc diffusion assay with Escherichia coli overexpressing OcSOD proteins. Silencing of OcMnSOD significantly increased ROS content in chlorpyrifos-exposed grasshoppers. Disc diffusion assay showed that the plates with E. coli overexpressing OcMnSOD had the smaller inhibition zones around the chlorpyrifos-soaked filter discs. These results implied that OcMnSOD played a significant role in defense chlorpyrifos-induced oxidative stress.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we characterized cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca signals during spontaneous skeletal muscle contractions in zebrafish embryos expressing bioluminescent GFP-aequorin (GA, cytoplasm) and mitoGFP-aequorin (mitoGA, trapped in the mitochondrial matrix). The Ca transients measured with GA and mitoGA reflected contractions of the trunk observed by transmitted light. The mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP and the inhibitor of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), DS16570511, abolished mitochondrial Ca transients whereas they increased the frequency of cytosolic Ca transients and muscle contractions, confirming the subcellular localization of mitoGA. Mitochondrial Ca dynamics were also determined with mitoGA and were found to follow closely cytoplasmic changes, with a slower decay. Cytoplasmic Ca kinetics and propagation along the trunk and tail were characterized with GA and with the genetically encoded fluorescent Ca indicator, Twitch-4.

Our previous work revealed that diverse upstream events correlated with altered mitochondrial proteome in human muscle biopsies. However, several proteins showed relatively unchanged expression suggesting that post-translational modifications, mainly protein phosphorylation could influence their activity and regulate mitochondrial processes. We conducted mitochondrial phosphoprotein profiling, by proteomics approach, of healthy human skeletal muscle (n = 10) and three muscle diseases (n = 10 each): Dysferlinopathy, Polymyositis and Distal Myopathy with Rimmed Vacuoles. Healthy human muscle mitochondrial proteins displayed 253 phosphorylation sites (phosphosites), which contributed to metabolic and redox processes and mitochondrial organization etc. Electron transport chain complexes accounted for 84 phosphosites. Muscle pathologies displayed 33 hyperphosphorylated and 14 hypophorphorylated sites with only 5 common proteins, indicating varied phosphorylation profile across muscle pathologies. Molecular modelling revealed altered local structure in the phosphorylated sites of Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 1 and complex V subunit ATP5B1. Molecular dynamics simulations in complex I subunits NDUFV1, NDUFS1 and NDUFV2 revealed that phosphorylation induced structural alterations thereby influencing electron transfer and potentially altering enzyme activity. We propose that altered phosphorylation at specific sites could regulate mitochondrial protein function in the skeletal muscle during physiological and pathological processes.Copyright © 2019.

While there is no antiviral therapy available against this potentially lethal disease, the efficacy of the only approved vaccine is not optimal and its safety has been recently questioned. In order to develop better vaccines based on attenuated and/or chimeric viruses, one must consider how the human immune system is engaged during DENV infection. The activation of the innate immunity through the detection of viruses by cellular sensors is the first line of defence against those pathogens. This triggers a cascade of events which establishes an antiviral state at the cell level and leads to a global immunological response. However, DENV has evolved to interfere with the innate immune signalling at multiple levels, hence dampening antiviral responses and favouring viral replication and dissemination. This review elaborates on the interplay between DENV and the innate immune system.

Chaperone-Mediated Autophagy (CMA) activation in relation to reactive oxygen species (ROS) release has been measured by monitoring the expression of specific genes. Treatments with HO were used to test their potential in reverting resistance. Fluctuations of cytoplasmic ROS levels were accountable for CMA induction and cytotoxic effects observed in TMZ sensitive cells after treatment. On the other hand, in resistant cells, TMZ failed in producing an increase in cytoplasmic ROS levels and CMA activation, preventing GBM cell toxicity. By increasing oxidative stress, CMA activation was recovered, as also cell cytotoxicity, especially in combination with TMZ treatment. Herein, for the first time, it is shown the relation between mitochondrial ROS release, CMA activation and TMZ-responsiveness in GBM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666566>Using high-throughput sequencing to explore the anti-inflammatory effects of α-mangostin.</a></h2><p>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) causes an inflammatory response, and α-mangostin (α-MG) is an ingredient of a Chinese herbal medicine with anti-inflammatory effects. We investigated the mechanism by which α-MG reduces LPS-stimulated IEC-6 cells inflammation. A genome-wide examination of control, LPS-stimulated, and α-MG-pretreated cells was performed with the Illumina Hiseq sequencing platform, and gene expression was verified with quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Among the 37,199 genes profiled, 2014 genes were regulated in the LPS group, and 475 genes were regulated in the α-MG group. GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) showed that they were mainly related to inflammation and oxidative stress. Based on the transcriptomic results, we constructed a rat model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with LPS and investigated the effects of α-MG on NLRP3 inflammasomes. After LPS stimulation, the rat intestinal villi were significantly detached, with congestion and hemorrhage; the intestinal epithelial cell nuclei were deformed; and the  were swollen. However, after pretreatment with α-MG, the intestinal villus congestion and hemorrhage were reduced, the epithelial nuclei were rounded, and the mitochondrial morphology was intact. qPCR and western blotting were used to detect NLRP3, caspase 1, interleukin (IL)-18, and IL-1β expression at the gene and protein levels. Their expression increased at both the transcript and protein levels after LPS stimulation, whereas it decreased after pretreatment with α-MG. This study provides new methods and ideas for the treatment of inflammation. α-MG may have utility as a drug for intestinal inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660842>Synthesis, Anticancer and Antibacterial Activity of Betulinic and Betulonic Acid C-28-Triphenylphosphonium Conjugates with Variable Alkyl Linker Length.</a></h2><p>Conjugation of triterpenoids such as betulinic acid 1 with Triphenylphosphonium (TPP) group is a powerful approach to generating medicinal compounds. Their development proposes structure optimization in respect of availability and activity towards target cells and organelles. Selection of 1 or its precursor betulonic acid 2 and the optimal linker is of particular importance for drug candidate identification among the TPP-triterpenoid conjugates.In this study new C-28-TPP conjugated derivatives of 1 and 2 with the alkyl/alkoxyalkyl linkers of variable length were synthesized and compared regarding their anticancer, antibacterial, and -targeted effects.The TPP conjugates of 1 and 2 [6a-f, 7a-f] were synthesized by the reaction of halogenalkyl esters [3a-f, 4a-f, 5] with triphenylphosphine in acetonitrile upon heating. Cytotoxicity (MTT assay), antibacterial activity (microdilution assay) and mitochondrial effects (flow cytofluorometry) were studied.Conjugation with the TPP group greatly increased cytotoxicity of the triterpenoids up to 30 times. The conjugates were up to 10-17 times more active against MCF-7 (IC50 = 0.17µM, 72h, 6c) and PC-3 (IC50 = 0.14µM, 72h, 6a) cancer cells than for human skin fibroblasts. Enhanced antibacterial (bactericidal) activity of the TPP-triterpenoid conjugates with MIC for Gram-positive bacteria as low as 2µM (6a, 7a) was for the first time revealed. The conjugates were found to effectively inhibit oxidation of 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin probe in cytosol, decrease transmembrane potential and increase superoxide radical level in .Relationships between the effects and structure of the TPP-triterpenoid conjugates were evaluated and are discussed. Based on the results, 6a can be selected for further preclinical investigation as a potential anticancer compound.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665641>Maternal Lipid Metabolism Directs Fetal Liver Programming following Nutrient Stress.</a></h2><p>The extreme metabolic demands of pregnancy require coordinated metabolic adaptations between mother and fetus to balance fetal growth and maternal health with nutrient availability. To determine maternal and fetal contributions to metabolic flexibility during gestation, pregnant mice with genetic impairments in mitochondrial carbohydrate and/or lipid metabolism were subjected to nutrient deprivation. The maternal fasting response initiates a fetal liver transcriptional program marked by upregulation of lipid- and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (Pparα)-regulated genes. Impaired maternal lipid metabolism alters circulating lipid metabolite concentrations and enhances the fetal response to fasting, which is largely dependent on fetal Pparα. Maternal fasting also improves metabolic deficits in fetal carbohydrate metabolism by increasing the availability of alternative substrates. Impairment of both carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in pregnant dams further exacerbates the fetal liver transcriptional response to nutrient deprivation. Together, these data demonstrate a regulatory role for mitochondrial macronutrient metabolism in mediating maternal-fetal metabolic communication, particularly when nutrients are limited.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

The identification of human FA blood biomarkers related to disease severity and neuro-pathomechanism could support clinical trials of drug efficacy. To try to identify human biomarkers of neuro-pathomechanistic relevance, we compared the overlapping gene expression changes of primary blood and skin cells of FA patients with changes in the Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) of the KIKO FA mouse model. As DRG is the primary site of neurodegeneration in FA, our goal was to identify which changes in blood and skin of FA patients provide a 'window' into the FA neuropathomechanism inside the nervous system. In addition, gene expression in frataxin-deficient neuroglial cells and FA mouse hearts were compared for a total of 5 data sets. The overlap of these changes strongly supports mitochondrial changes, apoptosis and alterations of selenium metabolism. Consistent biomarkers were observed, including three genes of mitochondrial stress (MTIF2, ENO2), apoptosis (DDIT3/CHOP), oxidative stress (PREX1), and selenometabolism (SEPW1). These results prompted our investigation of the GPX1 activity as a marker of selenium and oxidative stress, in which we observed a significant change in FA patients. We believe these lead biomarkers that could be assayed in FA patient blood as indicators of disease severity and progression, and also support the involvement of , apoptosis and selenium in the neurodegenerative process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661433>Role of Nanomedicine in Redox Mediated Healing at Molecular Level.</a></h2><p>Nanomedicine, the offspring born from the marriage of nanotechnology and medicine, has already brought momentous advances in the fight against a plethora of unmet diseases from cardiovascular and neurodegenerative to diabetes and cancer. Here, we review a conceptual framework that will provide a basic understanding about the molecular mechanism of action of a therapeutic nanomaterial inside biological milieu. In this review, we highlight how the catalytic nature of a transition metal oxide nanomaterial influences the cellular redox homeostasis, supports the cellular antioxidant defence system and reactivates the reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated signalling to perform normal cell functions like cell cycle, differentiation, apoptosis, inflammation, toxicity, and protein interactions. With numerous examples, we describe the redox modulatory nature of d-block metal oxide nanomaterials and their biomimetic nanozyme activities to protect the , the cellular redox mediator which prevents an organism from various diseases.

We have demonstrated a new kind of oxygen nanosensors based on a ruthenium complex doped solid silica nanoparticles, which showed high oxygen sensing performance (I0/I100 = 3.29, t95 < 3 s) and ease of surface functionalization. Their sensing performance can be tuned by changing types of oxygen-sensitive probes and particle morphology. The nanosensors showed excellent control in both sensor size (from 30 to 200 nm), monodispersity, morphology, surface chemistry, and batch to batch consistency. Their uniform size distribution and good biocompatibility made them suitable for intracellular studies. Because the sensor surface can be easily functionalized with arbitrary units (such as transmembrane motifs, drugs, organelle-targeting groups, imaging reagent, multiple sensor probes), these nanosensors provide a general platform to build easy-to-use tools for intracellular applications. The ease of surface functionalization was demonstrated by modifying the sensors outer surface with morpholinopropylamine and (3-carboxypropyl) triphenyl phosphonium, to actively target intracellular lysosomes and  of the tested cell lines (HeLa, MCF-7, MCF-10A). Applying the -targeting oxygen nanosensor together with our custom-built rapid phosphorescent lifetime imaging system, variations of intracellular oxygen have been quantitatively imaged and traced (in millisecond intervals) in real time and in-situ.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672329>From  to healthy aging: The role of branched-chain amino acids treatment: MATeR a randomized study.</a></h2><p>Malnutrition often affects elderly patients and significantly contributes to the reduction in healthy life expectancy, causing high morbidity and mortality. In particular, protein malnutrition is one of the determinants of frailty and sarcopenia in elderly people.To investigate the role of amino acid supplementation in senior patients we performed an open-label randomized trial and administered a particular branched-chain amino acid enriched mixture (BCAAem) or provided diet advice in 155 elderly malnourished patients. They were followed for 2 months, assessing cognitive performance by Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), muscle mass measured by anthropometry, strength measure by hand grip and performance measured by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, the 30 s Chair Sit to Stand (30-s CST) test and the 4 m gait speed test. Moreover we measured oxidative stress in plasma and mitochondrial production of ATP and electron flux in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.Both groups improved in nutritional status, general health and muscle mass, strength and performance; treatment with BCAAem supplementation was more effective than simple diet advice in increasing MMSE (1.2 increase versus 0.2, p = 0.0171), ATP production (0.43 increase versus -0.1, p = 0.0001), electron flux (0.50 increase versus 0.01, p < 0.0001) and in maintaining low oxidative stress. The amelioration of clinical parameters as MMSE, balance, four meter walking test were associated to increased mitochondrial function.Overall, our findings show that sustaining nutritional support might be clinically relevant in increasing physical performance in elderly malnourished patients and that the use of specific BCAAem might ameliorate also cognitive performance thanks to an amelioration of  bioenergetics.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Oxygen regulation is key in this symbiosis. Fixation is performed by an oxygen-intolerant nitrogenase enzyme but requires respiration to meet its high energy demands. To satisfy these opposing constraints the symbiotic partners cooperate intimately, employing a variety of mechanisms to regulate and respond to oxygen concentration. During symbiosis rhizobia undergo significant changes in gene expression to differentiate into nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. Legumes host these bacteroids in specialized root organs called nodules. These generate a near-anoxic environment using an oxygen diffusion barrier, oxygen-binding leghemoglobin and control of  localization. Rhizobia sense oxygen using multiple interconnected systems which enable a finely-tuned response to the wide range of oxygen concentrations they experience when transitioning from soil to nodules. The oxygen-sensing FixL-FixJ and hybrid FixL-FxkR two-component systems activate at relatively high oxygen concentration and regulate fixK transcription. FixK activates the fixNOQP and fixGHIS operons producing a high-affinity terminal oxidase required for bacterial respiration in the microaerobic nodule. Additionally or alternatively, some rhizobia regulate expression of these operons by FnrN, an FNR-like oxygen-sensing protein. The final stage of symbiotic establishment is activated by the NifA protein, regulated by oxygen at both the transcriptional and protein level. A cross-species comparison of these systems highlights differences in their roles and interconnections but reveals common regulatory patterns and themes. Future work is needed to establish the complete regulon of these systems and identify other regulatory signals.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Cells have well-defined different membrane-surrounded organelles like , endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, peroxisomes, etc., however, on demand they can create membrane-less organelles as stress granules, nucleoli and P bodies to cover vital functions and regulatory activities. However, the mechanism of intracellular molecule assembly into functional compartments within a living cell remains till now not fully understood. (Soft Matter 2019, 15 (6):1135-1154). In vitro and in vivo investigations unveiled that MLOs emerge after preceding liquid-liquid, liquid-gel, liquid-semi-crystalline, or liquid-crystalline phase separations. Liquid-liquid and liquid-gel MLOs form the majority of cellular phase separation events, while the occurrence of micro-sized crystals in cells was only rarely observed, however can be considered as a result of a preceding protein phase separation event. In vivo, also known and termed as in cellulo crystals, are reported since 1853 (Botanische Zeitung, 13, 881-8 821 855; CR Mem. Soc. Biol. 5, 450-454, 1853). In some cases, they have been linked to vital cellular functions, such as storage and detoxification. However, the occurrence of in cellulo crystals is also associated to diseases like cataract, hemoglobin C diseases etc. (Biology Chemistry De Gruyter 2018, 399 (7):751-752).

Current research has shown that hepatic fatty acid accumulation can cause hepatic insulin resistance through increased gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and impaired insulin signal pathway.  are the major sites of fatty acid β-oxidation, which is the major degradation mechanism of fatty acids. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to be involved in the development of hepatic fatty acid-induced hepatic insulin resistance. Mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy), a catabolic process, selectively degrades damaged  to reverse mitochondrial dysfunction and preserve mitochondrial dynamics and function. Therefore, mitophagy can promote mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation to inhibit hepatic fatty acid accumulation and improve hepatic insulin resistance. Here, we review advances in our understanding of the relationship between mitophagy and hepatic insulin resistance. Additionally, we also highlight the potential value of mitophagy in the treatment of hepatic insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2019 Su, Nie, Huang, Zhu, Feng, Tang and Zheng.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647556>Mass spectrometry-based methods for analyzing the mitochondrial interactome in mammalian cells.</a></h2><p>Protein-protein interactions are essential biologic processes that occur at inter- and intra-cellular levels.

Most brain aging studies are focused on neurons and less on astrocytes which are the most abundant cells in the brain known to be in charge of various functions including the maintenance of brain physical formation, ion homeostasis, and secretion of various extracellular matrix proteins. Altered mitochondrial dynamics, defective mitophagy or mitochondrial damages are causative factors of mitochondrial dysfunction, which is linked to age-related disorders. Etoposide is an anti-cancer reagent which can induce DNA stress and cellular senescence of cancer cell lines. In this study, we investigated whether etoposide induces senescence and functional alterations in cultured rat astrocytes. Senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity was used as a cellular senescence marker. The results indicated that etoposide-treated astrocytes showed cellular senescence phenotypes including increased SA-β-gal-positive cells number, increased nuclear size and increased senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASP) such as IL-6. We also observed a decreased expression of cell cycle markers, including Phospho- Histone H3/Histone H3 and CDK2, and dysregulation of cellular functions based on wound-healing, neuronal protection, and phagocytosis assays. Finally, mitochondrial dysfunction was noted through the determination of mitochondrial membrane potential using tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) and the measurement of mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR). These data suggest that etoposide can induce cellular senescence and mitochondrial dysfunction in astrocytes which may have implications in brain aging and neurodegenerative conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655022>FOXO1 inhibition prevents renal ischemia-reperfusion injury via promotion of CREB/PGC-1α-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis.</a></h2><p>Background And Purpose Growing evidence indicates targeting mitochondrial dynamics and biogenesis could accelerate recovery from renal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Transcription factor forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) is a key regulator of mitochondrial homeostasis and plays a pathologic role in the progression of renal disease. Experimental Approach A mouse model of renal I/R injury and a hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury model for human renal tubular epithelial cells (HK2s) were used. Key Results I/R injury up-regulated renal expression of FOXO1, and treatment with FOXO1-selective inhibitor AS1842856 prior to I/R injury decreased serum urea nitrogen, serum creatinine and the tubular damage score after injury. Post-I/R injury AS1842856 treatment could also ameliorate renal function and improve the survival rate of mice following injury. AS1842856 administration reduced mitochondrial mediated apoptosis, suppressed the overproduction of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) and accelerated recovery of ATP both in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, FOXO1 inhibition improved mitochondrial biogenesis and suppressed mitophagy. Expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α), a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, was down-regulated in both I/R and H/R injury, which could be abrogated by FOXO1 inhibition. Experiments using integrated bioinformatics analysis and coimmunoprecipitation established that FOXO1 inhibited PGC-1α transcription by competing with CREB for its binding to transcriptional coactivators CREBBP/EP300 (CBP/P300).

Although a number of LYRM proteins have been described to participate in a variety of defined processes, the functions of others remain either partially or entirely unknown. We profiled the interaction network of NDUFAB1 to reveal associations with 9 known LYRM proteins as well as more than 20 other proteins involved in mitochondrial respiratory chain complex and mitochondrial ribosome assembly. Subsequent knockout and interaction network studies in human cells revealed the LYRM member AltMiD51 to be important for optimal assembly of the large mitoribosome subunit, consistent with recent structural studies. In addition, we used proteomics coupled with topographical heat-mapping to reveal that knockout of LYRM2 impairs assembly of the NADH-dehydrogenase module of complex I, leading to defects in cellular respiration. Together, this work adds to the catalogue of functions executed by LYRM family of proteins in building mitochondrial complexes and emphasises the common and essential role of NDUFAB1 as a protagonist in mitochondrial metabolism.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652604>Hyperacetylation of Cardiac Mitochondrial Proteins Is Associated with Metabolic Impairment and Sirtuin Downregulation after Chronic Total Body Irradiation of ApoE  Mice.</a></h2><p>Chronic exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Alteration in energy metabolism has been suggested to contribute to radiation-induced heart pathology, mitochondrial dysfunction being a hallmark of this disease. The goal of this study was to investigate the regulatory role of acetylation in heart  in the long-term response to chronic radiation. ApoE-deficient C57Bl/6J mice were exposed to low-dose-rate (20 mGy/day) gamma radiation for 300 days, resulting in a cumulative total body dose of 6.0 Gy. Heart  were isolated and analyzed using quantitative proteomics. Radiation-induced proteome and acetylome alterations were further validated using immunoblotting, enzyme activity assays, and ELISA. In total, 71 proteins showed peptides with a changed acetylation status following irradiation. The great majority (94%) of the hyperacetylated proteins were involved in the TCA cycle, fatty acid oxidation, oxidative stress response and sirtuin pathway. The elevated acetylation patterns coincided with reduced activity of mitochondrial sirtuins, increased the level of Acetyl-CoA, and were accompanied by inactivation of major cardiac metabolic regulators PGC-1 alpha and PPAR alpha. These observations suggest that the changes in mitochondrial acetylation after irradiation is associated with impairment of heart metabolism. We propose a novel mechanism involved in the development of late cardiac damage following chronic irradiation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665043>Arabidopsis thaliana alternative dehydrogenases: a potential therapy for mitochondrial complex I deficiency? Perspectives and pitfalls.</a></h2><p>Complex I (CI or NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) deficiency is the most frequent cause of mitochondrial respiratory chain defect. Successful attempts to rescue CI function by introducing an exogenous NADH dehydrogenase, such as the NDI1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScNDI1), have been reported although with drawbacks related to competition with CI. In contrast to ScNDI1, which is permanently active in yeast naturally devoid of CI, plant alternative NADH dehydrogenases (NDH-2) support the oxidation of NADH only when the CI is metabolically inactive and conceivably when the concentration of matrix NADH exceeds a certain threshold. We therefore explored the feasibility of CI rescue by NDH-2 from Arabidopsis thaliana (At) in human CI defective fibroblasts.We showed that, other than ScNDI1, two different NDH-2 (AtNDA2 and AtNDB4) targeted to the  were able to rescue CI deficiency and decrease oxidative stress as indicated by a normalization of SOD activity in human CI-defective fibroblasts. We further demonstrated that when expressed in human control fibroblasts, AtNDA2 shows an affinity for NADH oxidation similar to that of CI, thus competing with CI for the oxidation of NADH as opposed to our initial hypothesis. This competition reduced the amount of ATP produced per oxygen atom reduced to water by half in control cells.In conclusion, despite their promising potential to rescue CI defects, due to a possible competition with remaining CI activity, plant NDH-2 should be regarded with caution as potential therapeutic tools for human mitochondrial diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640957>[Interaction between necroptosis and apoptosis in MC3T3-E1 cell death induced by dexamethasone].</a></h2><p>To investigate the relationship between necroptosis and apoptosis in MCET3-E1 cell death induced by glucocorticoids.MC3T3-E1 cells were incubated with 10-6 mol/L dexamethasone followed by treatment with the apoptosis inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (40 μmol/L) or the necroptosis inhibitor necrostatin-1 (40 μmol/L) for 2 h.

The expressions of RIP-1 and RIP-3 in the cells were detected by Western blotting.At a concentration of 10-6 mol/L, dexamethasone induced both apoptosis and necroptosis in MC3T3- E1 cells. Annexin V/PI double staining showed that inhibition of cell apoptosis caused an increase in cell necrosis manifested by such changes as mitochondrial swelling and plasma membrane disruption, as shown by electron microscopy; Hoechst staining showed that the percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly reduced. When necroptosis was inhibited by necrostatin-1, MC3T3-E1 cells showed significantly increased apoptosis as shown by both AV/PI and Hoechst staining, and such changes were accompanied by changes in mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP level in the cells.In the process of dexamethasone-induced cell death, necroptosis and apoptosis can transform reciprocally accompanied by functional changes of the .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653054>Suppression of the Peripheral Immune System Limits the Central Immune Response Following Cuprizone-Feeding: Relevance to Modelling Multiple Sclerosis.</a></h2><p>Cuprizone (CPZ) preferentially affects oligodendrocytes (OLG), resulting in demyelination. To investigate whether central oligodendrocytosis and gliosis triggered an adaptive immune response, the impact of combining a standard (0.2%) or low (0.1%) dose of ingested CPZ with disruption of the blood brain barrier (BBB), using pertussis toxin (PT), was assessed in mice. 0.2% CPZ(±PT) for 5 weeks produced oligodendrocytosis, demyelination and gliosis  marked splenic atrophy (37%) and reduced levels of CD4 (44%) and CD8 (61%). Conversely, 0.1% CPZ(±PT) produced a similar oligodendrocytosis, demyelination and gliosis but a smaller reduction in splenic CD4 (11%) and CD8 (14%) levels and  splenic atrophy. Long-term feeding of 0.1% CPZ(±PT) for 12 weeks produced similar reductions in CD4 (27%) and CD8 (43%), as well as splenic atrophy (33%), as seen with 0.2% CPZ(±PT) for 5 weeks. Collectively, these results suggest that 0.1% CPZ for 5 weeks may be a more promising model to study the 'inside-out' theory of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). However, neither CD4 nor CD8 were detected in the brain in CPZ±PT groups, indicating that CPZ-mediated suppression of peripheral immune organs is a major impediment to studying the 'inside-out' role of the adaptive immune system in this model over long time periods. Notably, CPZ(±PT)-feeding induced changes in the brain proteome related to the suppression of immune function, cellular metabolism, synaptic function and cellular structure/organization, indicating that demyelinating conditions, such as MS, can be initiated in the absence of adaptive immune system involvement.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657540>Task-Specific Design of Immune-Augmented Nanoplatform to Enable High-Efficiency Tumor Immunotherapy.</a></h2><p>Potentiating systemic immunity against breast cancer is in the most urgent demand as breast cancer is low sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Although phototherapy and some chemotherapy can trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD) for T cell-mediated antitumor immune response, their immunotherapy efficacy is severely restricted by insufficient phototherapeutic capability and severe multidrug resistance (MDR). Inspired by both the hypersensitivity to phototherapy and the key role in MDR for , a rationally engineered immunity amplifier via -targeted photo-chemotherapeutic nanoparticles was, for the first time, achieved to fight against low-immunogenic breast cancer without additional immune agent. The newly synthesized task-specific -targeted IR780 derivative (T780) was integrated with chemotherapeutic doxorubicin (DOX) to form multifunctional nanoparticles via assembling strategy along with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as biomimetic corona (BSA@T780/DOX NPs). The in situ enhancement in both phototherapy and MDR reversal by targeting  with BSA@T780/DOX NPs boosted high-efficient ICD toward excellent antitumor immune response. The newly developed strategy not only eradicated the primary tumor, but also eliminated the bilateral tumors efficiently, as well as preventing metastasis and postsurgical recurrence, demonstrating great interest for fighting against low-immunogenic breast cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666206>Icariin protects human nucleus pulposus cells from hydrogen peroxide-induced -mediated apoptosis by activating nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2.</a></h2><p>Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is a well-known cause of lower back pain. Icariin has been shown to exert a protective effect on human nucleus pulposus (NP) cells and accordingly has implications for the prevention and treatment of IVDD; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying its action are not fully established. In this study, the mechanisms underlying its protection against hydrogen peroxide (HO)-induced oxidative stress injury were investigated. In vitro, we demonstrated that icariin inhibits HO-induced -mediated apoptosis. It upregulates oxidative stress mediators, i.e., reactive oxygen species, and downregulates mitochondrial membrane potential. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) is a key factor involved in the regulation of the endogenous defense system. It was proved that icariin could activate the Nrf-2 signaling pathway, upregulate the protein expression of nuclear respiratory factor-1 and the mitochondrial transcription factor, promoting mitochondrial biogenesis in human NP cells. An Nrf-2 agonist and inhibitor promoted or partly abolished the protective effects of icariin on mitochondrial homeostasis. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the Nrf-2 signaling pathway could be inhibited by the phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/AKT pathway. In vivo, icariin ameliorated IVDD in a rat model by promoting Nrf-2 activity, and preserving extracellular matrix in NP cells. These data suggest that icariin could ameliorate IVDD in rat models in vivo. In summary, the protective effects of icariin on human NP cells may suppress the pathogenesis of IVDD via the Nrf-2 signaling pathway. Our findings suggest that the Nrf-2 signaling pathway is a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of IVDD.Copyright © 2019.

Transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) channel is a Ca permeable cation channel that can be activated by HO and plays an important role in cellular functions. It is also able to promote susceptibility to cell death. We studied expression and functionality of TRPM2 in KGN cells and examined GCT tissue microarrays (TMAs) to explore in vivo relevance. We employed live cell, calcium and mitochondrial imaging, viability assays, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. We confirmed that KGN cells produce HO and found that they express functional TRPM2. HO increased intracellular Ca levels and N-(p-Amylcinnamoyl)anthranilic acid (ACA), a TRPM2 inhibitor, blocked this action. HO caused mitochondrial fragmentation and apoptotic cell death, which could be attenuated by a scavenger (Trolox). Immunohistochemistry showed parallel expression of NOX4 and TRPM2 in all 73 tumor samples examined. The results suggest that GCTs can be endowed with a system that may convey susceptibility to cell death. If so, induction of oxidative stress may be beneficial in GCT therapy. Our results also imply a therapeutic potential for TRPM2 as a drug target in GCTs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661838>Fatty Acid-Binding Protein 3 is Critical for α-Synuclein Uptake and MPP-Induced Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Cultured Dopaminergic Neurons.</a></h2><p>α-Synuclein is an abundant neuronal protein that accumulates in insoluble inclusions in Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies. Fatty acids partially regulate α-Synuclein accumulation, and mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons highly express fatty acid-binding protein 3 (FABP3). We previously demonstrated that FABP3 knockout mice show decreased α-Synuclein oligomerization and neuronal degeneration of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons . In this study, we newly investigated the importance of FABP3 in α-Synuclein uptake, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP)-induced axodendritic retraction, and mitochondrial dysfunction. To disclose the issues, we employed cultured mesencephalic neurons derived from wild type or FABP3 C57BL6 mice and performed immunocytochemical analysis. We demonstrated that TH neurons from FABP3 mice take up α-Synuclein monomers while FABP3 TH neurons do not. The formation of filamentous α-Synuclein inclusions following treatment with MPP was observed only in FABP3, and not in FABP3 neurons. Notably, detailed morphological analysis revealed that FABP neurons did not exhibit MPP-induced axodendritic retraction. Moreover, FABP3 was also critical for MPP-induced reduction of mitochondrial activity and the production of reactive oxygen species. These data indicate that FABP3 is critical for α-Synuclein uptake in dopaminergic neurons, thereby preventing synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659418>Cinnamaldehyde inhibits Candida albicans growth by causing apoptosis and its treatment on vulvovaginal candidiasis and oropharyngeal candidiasis.</a></h2><p>The invasion of Candida albicans is one of the most common fungal infections seen in clinical practice, and serious drug resistance has been reported in recent years. Therefore, new anti-C. albicans drugs must be introduced. In this research, it was demonstrated that cinnamaldehyde (CA) shows strong antimicrobial activity, with 0.26 mg/mL CA being the minimum inhibitory concentration to manage C. albicans. Extraordinarily, we detected that CA accumulated the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhanced the calcium concentration in the cytoplasm and  through flow cytometry. In addition, we observed that C. albicans cells released Cytochrome c from the  to the cytoplasm, depolarized the mitochondrial membrane potential, and activated the metacaspase when exposed to 0.065, 0.13, 0.26, and 0.52 mg/mL CA. Furthermore, to confirm that CA introduces the C. albicans apoptosis, we discovered that when the phosphatidylserine was exposed, DNA damage and chromatin condensation occurred, which were detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. Finally, demonstrations of phenotype investigation, colony-forming unit (CFU) counts, and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining were conducted to prove that CA possessed the ability to treat oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC).

In this study, we explored nanoparticle (NP) interactions with A549 cells.After exposure to PNP or ambient pollution particles (PM0.2), live single A549 cells were studied using confocal laser scanning microscopy. PNP uptake and egress were investigated and activation of autophagy was confirmed by immunolabeling with LC3-II and LC3-GFP transduction/colocalization with PNP. Mitochondrial membrane potential, mitophagy, and lysosomal membrane permeability (LMP) were assessed in the presence/absence of apical nanoparticle (NP) exposure.PNP uptake into A549 cells decreased in the presence of cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of macropinocytosis. PNP egress was not affected by increased cytosolic [Ca]. Autophagy activation was indicated by increased LC3 expression and LC3-GFP colocalization with PNP. Increased LMP was observed following PNP or PM0.2 exposure.

PDT consumes tissue oxygen and destroys tumor vasculature, further hampering its own efficacy in promoting tumor deterioration. Therefore, overcoming the photodynamic exacerbation of tumor hypoxia is urgent.  Herein, we report a photodynamic nanoparticle with sustainable hypoxia remission skills by both intratumoral HO catalysis and targeted mitochondrial destruction. The MnO@MSNs@IR780 nanoparticles are formed by absorbing a photosensitizer (IR780) into 90 nm mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) and capping the surface pores with 5 nm MnO nanoparticles.  These MnO nanoparticles can accumulate in tumors and respond to the HO-enriched tumor microenvironment by decomposing and catalyzing HO into O. Afterwards, IR780 is released and activated, spontaneously targeting the  due to its natural mitochondrial affinity. Under laser irradiation, this self-generated oxygen-enhanced PDT can destroy  and inhibit cell respiration, resulting in sustainable hypoxia remission in tumor tissues and consequently enhancing the therapeutic outcome.  experiments suggest that MnO@MSNs@IR780 exhibited highly mitochondrion-targeted properties and could sustainably inhibit tumor hypoxia. Additionally, the highest photoacoustic signal of HbO with the lowest Hb was observed in tumors from mice after PDT, indicating that these nanoparticles can also prevent tumor hypoxia .  Taken together, our study indicated a new approach for overcoming the sustainable hypoxia limitation in traditional PDT by targeted oxygen supplementation and  destruction.© The author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647975>Autophagy as a novel therapeutic target in vascular calcification.</a></h2><p>The autophagy pathway is a key regulator of cellular metabolism and homeostasis, and plays a critical role in maintaining normal vascular cell function. It is well recognized that autophagy can regulate endothelial cell homeostasis, vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotype transition, and calcium (Ca) homeostasis in VSMCs. Emerging evidence has demonstrated that autophagy directly protects against vascular calcification (VC). Crosstalk between endosomes, dysfunctional , autophagic vesicles and Ca and phosphate (Pi) enriched matrix vesicles (MVs) may underpin the pathogenesis of VC. In this review, we summarize the current experimental evidence in understanding how autophagy maintains normal vascular cell function and its protective role against vascular calcification. We also discuss the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms through which autophagy inhibits vascular calcification. Pharmacological modulation of autophagy may offer an exciting new strategy for the treatment of vascular calcification.Copyright © 2019.

In the current study, we explored the upstream mediator for cardiomyocytes necrosis induced by hypoxia-reoxygenation (HR) injury with a focus on mitochondrial function and JNK-Bnip3 pathway.  Cell necrosis was determined via MTT assay, TUNEL staining and PI staining. siRNA transfection was performed to inhibit Ripk3 activation in response to HR injury. Pathway blocker was applied to prevent JNK activation.  Ripk3 was rapidly increased in HR-treated cardiomyocytes and correlated with the necrosis of cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, silencing of Ripk3 attenuated HR-mediated cardiomyocytes necrosis. At the molecular levels, Ripk3 deletion sustained mitochondrial bioenergetics and stabilized mitochondrial glucose metabolism. Besides, Ripk3 deletion also reduced mitochondrial oxidative stress and inhibited mPTP opening. To the end, we found Ripk3 activation was along with JNK pathway activation and Bnip3 upregulation. Interestingly, blockade of JNK pathway abolished the harmful effects of HR injury on mitochondrial function, energy metabolism and redox balance. Moreover, overexpression of Bnip3 abrogated the protection action played by Ripk3 deletion on cardiomyocytes survival.  Taken together, these data may identify Ripk3 upregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction and JNK-Bnip3 axis activation as the novel mechanisms underlying cardiomyocytes necrosis achieved by HR injury.

In Experiment 1, assessment of cell membrane integrity by trypan blue exclusion staining was used to select the best cryoprotectant solution for each cryopreservation method. Primary growth (PG) oocytes showed the best percentage of membrane integrity (63.5 ± 2.99%) when SF4 solution (2 M methanol + 0.1 M trehalose + 10% egg yolk solution) was employed. The vitrification solution, which presented the highest membrane integrity (V2; 1.5 M methanol + 5.5 M MeSO + 0.5 M sucrose + 10% egg yolk solution) was selected for Experiment 2. Experiment 2 aimed to compare the vitrification and slow freezing techniques in the following parameters: morphology, oxidative stress, mitochondrial activity, and DNA damage. Frozen ovarian tissue showed higher ROS levels and lower mitochondrial activity than vitrified ovarian tissue. Ultrastructural observations of frozen PG oocytes showed rupture of the plasma membrane, loss of intracellular contents and a large number of damaged , while vitrified PG oocytes had intact  and cell plasma membranes.

Among ciliates, anaerobic and aerobic lineages are interspersed, demonstrating that the switch to an anaerobic lifestyle with hydrogenosomes has occurred repeatedly and independently. To investigate the molecular details of this transition we generated genomic and transcriptomic datasets from anaerobic ciliates representing three distinct lineages. Our data demonstrate that hydrogenosomes have evolved from ancestral  in each case and reveal different degrees of independent mitochondrial genome and proteome reductive evolution, including the first example of complete mitochondrial genome loss in ciliates. Intriguingly, the FeFe-hydrogenase used for generating H2 has a unique domain structure among eukaryotes and appears to have been present, potentially through a single lateral gene transfer from an unknown donor, in the common aerobic ancestor of all three lineages. The early acquisition and retention of FeFe-hydrogenase helps to explain the facility whereby mitochondrial function can be so radically modified within this diverse and ecologically important group of microbial eukaryotes.© The Author(s) 2019.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) occurs when fat is deposited (steatosis) in the liver due to causes other than excessive alcohol use and is associated with liver fibrosis. In this study, we asked whether miR-29a could reduce experimental high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and liver fibrosis in mice. We performed systematical expression analyses of miR-29a transgenic mice (miR-29aTg mice) and wild-type littermates subjected to HFD-induced NAFLD. The results demonstrated that increased miR-29a not only alleviated HFD-induced body weight gain but also subcutaneous, visceral, and intestinal fat accumulation and hepatocellular steatosis in mice. Furthermore, hepatic tissue in the miR-29aTg mice displayed a weak fibrotic matrix concomitant with low fibrotic collagen1α1 expression within the affected tissues compared to the wild-type (WT) mice fed the HFD diet. Increased miR-29a signaling also resulted in the downregulation of expression of the epithelial mesenchymal transition-executing transcription factor , mesenchymal markers , and such pro-inflammation markers as  and  within the liver tissue. Meanwhile, miR-29aTg-HFD mice exhibited significantly lower levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), mitochondrial transcription factor A TFAM, and  DNA content in the liver than the WT-HFD mice. An in vitro luciferase reporter assay further confirmed that miR-29a mimic transfection reduced fatty acid translocase CD36 expression in HepG2 cells.

In this study, the structure and composition of APS was determined, following the evaluation of in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity of APS targeted macrophages and host immune system based on immunoregulated strategy. The results indicated that APS had no direct cytotoxicity against 4T1 cells, but APS mediated macrophages could significantly inhibit the growth of 4T1 cells by the induction of cell cycle arrest (G2 phase) and cell apoptosis. APS mediated macrophages promoted the apoptosis of 4T1 cells mainly through the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. The in vivo findings demonstrated that APS could markedly improve the thymus index and spleen index, and restore the structure of the damaged thymus and spleen tissue. APS could significantly enhance the proliferation of spleen lymphocytes and increase phagocytosis of peritoneal macrophages in mice. Furthermore, APS was capable of up-regulating the expression of IL-2, TNF-α and IFN-γ in peripheral blood.

We previously reported that a single nucleotide polymorphism in the gene encoding LKB1 is a risk factor for multiple sclerosis (MS). Since astrocyte activation and metabolic function have important roles in regulating neuroinflammation and neuropathology, we examined the serine/threonine kinase LKB1 in astrocytes in a chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mouse model of MS. To reduce LKB1, a heterozygous astrocyte-selective conditional knockout (het-cKO) model was used. While disease incidence was similar, disease severity was worsened in het-cKO mice. RNAseq analysis identified Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways enriched in het-cKO mice relating to mitochondrial function, confirmed by alterations in mitochondrial complex proteins and reductions in mRNAs related to astrocyte metabolism. Enriched pathways included major histocompatibility class II genes, confirmed by increases in MHCII protein in spinal cord and cerebellum of het-cKO mice. We observed increased numbers of CD4+ Th17 cells and increased neuronal damage in spinal cords of het-cKO mice, associated with reduced expression of choline acetyltransferase, accumulation of immunoglobulin-γ, and reduced expression of factors involved in motor neuron survival. In vitro, LKB1-deficient astrocytes showed reduced metabolic function and increased inflammatory activation.

The highly metabolically active cells of the renal tubule also pair their energetic needs to the regulation of diverse cellular processes, including energy generation, antioxidant responses, autophagy and mitochondrial quality control. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is essential not only for the harvesting of energy from substrates but also for an array of regulatory reactions that determine cellular health. In acute kidney injury (AKI), substantial decreases in the levels of NAD impair energy generation and, ultimately, the core kidney function of selective solute transport. Conversely, augmentation of NAD may protect the kidney tubule against diverse acute stressors. For example, NAD augmentation can ameliorate experimental AKI triggered by ischaemia-reperfusion, toxic injury and systemic inflammation. NAD-dependent maintenance of renal tubular metabolic health may also attenuate long-term profibrotic responses that could lead to chronic kidney disease. Further understanding of the genetic, environmental and nutritional factors that influence NAD biosynthesis and renal resilience may lead to novel approaches for the prevention and treatment of kidney disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647776>Treatment of Neurodegeneration: Integrating Photobiomodulation and Neurofeedback in Alzheimer's Dementia and Parkinson's: A Review.</a></h2><p> A review of photobiomodulation (PBM) in Alzheimer's dementia is submitted. The addition of PBM in neurodegenerative diseases is a dual modality that is at present gaining traction as it is safe, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory for treating neurodegeneration with photons that stimulate  increasing adenosine triphosphate and proteasomes increasing misfolded protein removal. Neurofeedback provides neural plasticity with an increase in brain-derived nerve factor mRNA and an increase in dendrite production and density in the hippocampus coupled with overall growth in dendrites, density, and neuronal survival.  Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology is the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein neurofibrillary tangles and subsequently amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques. PBM and neurobiofeedback (NBF)address the multiple gene expression and upregulation of multiple pathogenic pathway inflammation, reactive oxidative stress, mitochondrial disorders, insulin resistance, methylation defects, regulation of neuroprotective factors, and regional hypoperfusion of the brain. There is no human evidence to suggest a clinical therapeutic benefit from using consistent light sources while significantly increasing safety concerns.  A PBM test with early- to mid-Alzheimer's was reported in 2017, consisting of a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in a small pilot group of early- to mid-dementia subjects under Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Clinical Trial.  PBM-treated subjects showed that active treatment subjects tended to show greater improvement in the functioning of the executive: clock drawing, immediate recall, practical memory, and visual attention and task switching (Trails A&B). A larger study using the CerebroLite helmet in Temple Texas again of subjects in a double-blind, placebo-controlled IRB-approved FDA Clinical Trial demonstrated gain in memory and cognition by increased clock drawing.  Next-generation trials with the Cognitolite for Parkinson's disease subjects will incorporate the insights regarding significant bilateral occipital hypocoherence deficits gained from the quantitative EEG analyses. Future applications will integrate noninvasive stimulation delivery, including full-body and transcranial and infrared light with pulsed electromagnetic frequencies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669489>The spatio-temporal organization of mitochondrial FF ATP synthase in cristae depends on its activity mode.</a></h2><p>FF ATP synthase is a key enzyme of mitochondrial energy metabolism which works in two directions. It is not known whether ATP synthase and ATPase function are correlated with different spatio-temporal organization of the enzyme. To analyze this, we have tracked and localized individual ATP synthase/ATPase molecules in situ by live cell microscopy. Under normal conditions, ATP synthase is restricted mainly to cristae. A mobile fraction exist that displays orthogonal trajectories following the cristae membranes but also move in the IBM. By inhibiting glycolysis, we induced ATP hydrolysis in addition to ATP synthesis. The coexistence of two subpopulations was supported by data from single molecule localization and tracking analysis. We found that the spatial-temporal organization of ATP synthase was flexible and mirrored the physiological data. The clear cristae-related structuring of the ATP synthase/ATPase was obliterated when glycolysis was inhibited. At the same time, ATP synthase dimers decreased. The ratiometric change in dimeric/monomeric, respectively more mobile/less mobile ATP synthase was reversible. In IF1-KO cells, ATP synthase was more mobile, while inhibition of ATPase activity decreased the mobility. Together this data strongly supports the model of distinct subpopulations of ATP synthase and ATP hydrolase, the latter with higher mobility and likely present in the IBM compartment. Obviously, ATP synthase reacts quickly and reversibly to metabolic conditions, not only through functional but also through spatial and structural re-organization.Copyright © 2019.

Six MOM associated protein degradation (MAD) pathways center on three AAA ATPases: Cdc48 in the cytoplasm, Msp1 integral to MOM, and Yme1 integral to the inner membrane. These pathways survey MOM proteome from the cytoplasmic and the inter-membrane space (IMS) sides. They detect and degrade MOM proteins with misfolded cytoplasmic and IMS domains, remove mistargeted tail-anchored proteins, and clear mitochondrial precursor proteins clogged in the TOM import complex.

However, excessive autophagy can be deleterious to cardiomyocytes. CCN1/Cyr61, a matricellular protein, is expressed in the stressed heart to induce cardiomyopathy. The role of autophagy in CCN1-associated cardiotoxicity was not clear. Here, we found that autophagy was induced in the myocardium of the isoproterenol (ISO; 100 mg/kg/day for 5 days; s.c.) treated mice, where CCN1 expression is colocalized. The knock-in mice carrying an integrin α6β1-binding-defective mutant allele Ccn1-dm were resistant to the ISO-induced cardiac injury and autophagy. Our in vitro studies demonstrated that CCN1 dose- and time-dependently induced GFP-LC3-labeled autophagosome formation in rat cardiomyoblast H9c2 cells. The formation of autolysosomes in response to CCN1 (5 μg/ml; 3 h) treatment was identified by the acridine orange staining. The autophagy induction was confirmed by the elevated protein levels of Beclin 1, Atg5, and LC3-II, and the decrease of p62. Inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine or by silencing Atg5 gene enabled CCN1-induced apoptosis in H9c2 cells, suggesting a protective role of autophagy. CCN1 binds to integrin α6β1 to induce autophagy through reactive oxygen species, and the activation of ERK and JNK. Furthermore, mitophagy was observed after CCN1 treatment for the clearance of depolarized . Together, these results demonstrated that autophagy is induced in response to CCN1/α6β1 signaling in cardiomyocytes to alleviate CCN1-associated cardiotoxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655204>The humanin peptide mediates ELP nanoassembly and protects human retinal pigment epithelial cells from oxidative stress.</a></h2><p>Humanin (HN) is a hydrophobic 24-amino acid peptide derived from mitochondrial DNA that modulates cellular responses to oxidative stress and protects human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells from apoptosis. To solubilize HN, this report describes two genetically-encoded fusions between HN and elastin-like polypeptides (ELP). ELPs provide steric stabilization and/or thermo-responsive phase separation. Fusions were designed to either remain soluble or phase separate at the physiological temperature of the retina. Interestingly, the soluble fusion assembles stable colloids with a hydrodynamic radius of 39.1 nm at 37 °C. As intended, the thermo-responsive fusion forms large coacervates (> 1,000 nm) at 37 °C. Both fusions bind human RPE cells and protect against oxidative stress-induction of apoptosis (TUNEL, caspase-3 activation). Their activity is mediated through STAT3; furthermore, STAT3 inhibition eliminates their protection. These findings suggest that HN polypeptides may facilitate cellular delivery of biodegradable nanoparticles with potential protection against age-related diseases, including macular degeneration.Copyright © 2019.

Aβ42O also regulate the proliferative and differentiative properties of stem cells.We aimed to study whether Aβ42O-induced mtDNA damage is involved in the regulation of stem cell differentiation.Human iPSCs-derived neural stem cell (NSC) was applied to investigate the effect of Aβ42O on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and DNA damage using mitoSOX staining and long-range PCR lesion assay, respectively. mtDNA repair activity was measured by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) in vitro assay using  isolates and the expression and localization of NHEJ components were determined by Western blot and immunofluorescence assay. The expressions of Tuj-1 and GFAP, detected by immunofluorescence and qPCR, respectively, were examined as an index of neurons and astrocytes production.We show that in NSC Aβ42O treatment induces ROS production and mtDNA damage and impairs DNA end joining activity. NHEJ components, such as Ku70/80, DNA- PKcs, and XRCC4, are localized in  and silencing of XRCC4 significantly exacerbates the effect of Aβ42O on mtDNA integrity. On the contrary, pre-treatment with Phytic Acid (IP6), which specifically stimulates DNA-PK-dependent end-joining, inhibits Aβ42O-induced mtDNA damage and neuronal differentiation alteration.Aβ42O-induced mtDNA repair impairment may change cell fate thus shifting human NSC differentiation toward an astrocytic lineage. Repair stimulation counteracts Aβ42O neurotoxicity, suggesting mtDNA repair pathway as a potential target for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders like AD.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660692>Macrophage autophagy regulates -mediated apoptosis and inhibits necrotic core formation in vulnerable plaques.</a></h2><p>The vulnerable plaque is a key distinguishing feature of atherosclerotic lesions that can cause acute atherothrombotic vascular disease. This study was designed to explore the effect of autophagy on -mediated macrophage apoptosis and vulnerable plaques. Here, we generated the mouse model of vulnerable carotid plaque in ApoE mice. Application of ApoE mice with rapamycin (an autophagy inducer) inhibited necrotic core formation in vulnerable plaques by decreasing macrophage apoptosis. However, 3-methyladenine (an autophagy inhibitor) promoted plaque vulnerability through deteriorating these indexes. To further explore the mechanism of autophagy on macrophage apoptosis, we used macrophage apoptosis model in vitro and found that 7-ketocholesterol (7-KC, one of the primary oxysterols in oxLDL) caused macrophage apoptosis with concomitant impairment of , characterized by the impairment of mitochondrial ultrastructure, cytochrome c release, mitochondrial potential dissipation, mitochondrial fragmentation, excessive ROS generation and both caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation. Interestingly, such mitochondrial apoptotic responses were ameliorated by autophagy activator, but exacerbated by autophagy inhibitor. Finally, we found that MAPK-NF-κB signalling pathway was involved in autophagy modulation of 7-KC-induced macrophage apoptosis. So, we provide strong evidence for the potential therapeutic benefit of macrophage autophagy in regulating -mediated apoptosis and inhibiting necrotic core formation in vulnerable plaques.© 2019 The Authors.

We have used the Scanning Ion-selective Electrode Technique to measure transport of Na, K, H, Cl, NH  and Ca across the nuchal organ and body surface of embryos and neonates bathed in dechlorinated Hamilton tap water. Influx of Na and efflux of H and NH  were measured across the nuchal organ of both embryos and neonates. We propose that the efflux of K and Cl across the nuchal organ in embryos is related to the expansion of the haemocoel and release of intracellular solutes into the extracellular space during development. K is taken up across the nuchal organ later during development, coincident with expansion of the intracellular compartment through development of gills and other organs. Ca influx across the nuchal organ and body surface of neonates but not embryos is presumably related to calcification of the exoskeleton. Increases in the levels of Na and Ca in the water within the brood chamber suggests maternal provisioning of ions for uptake by the embryos. Our data thus support roles of the nuchal organ in ionoregulation, pH regulation, and nitrogenous waste excretion.© 2019.

Exposure to DEHP impairs the function of islet beta cells (INS-1 cells), which is related to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. At present, some research data have also confirmed that MEHP has a certain damage effect on INS-1 cells. In our experiment, we found that MEHP would lead to the increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the upregulation of autophagy. And downregulated ROS production by -acetyl-l-cysteine could also reduce autophagy. In addition, MEHP-induced lysosomal membrane permeability (LMP) subsequently released cathepsin D. Additionally, MEHP induced the collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and release of cytochrome . Addition of autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine relieved MEHP-induced apoptosis as assessed by the expression of cleaved caspase 3, cleaved caspase 9, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay, indicating that MEHP-induced apoptosis was autophagy dependent. Cathepsin D inhibitor, pepstatin A, suppressed MEHP-induced  release of cytochrome  and apoptosis as well. Meanwhile, pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a new B vitamin, improved the above phenomenon. Taken together, our results indicate that MEHP induces autophagy-dependent apoptosis in INS-1 cells by lysosomal-mitochondrial axis. PQQ improved this process by downregulating ROS and provided a degree of protection. Our study provides a new perspective for MEHP on the cytotoxic mechanism and PQQ protection in INS-1 cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647942>The compartmentalised nature of the mechanisms governing superoxide formation and scavenging in cells exposed to arsenite.</a></h2><p>In this study, respiration-proficient (RP) and -deficient (RD) cells were exposed to 2.5 or 10 μM arsenite to generate superoxide (O) respectively in the mitochondrial respiratory chain or via NADPH oxidase activation. These treatments, while causing similar, although mitochondrial permeability transition-dependent (RP-cells) or independent (RD-cells), delayed apoptosis, surprisingly generated identical kinetics and levels of dihydrorhodamine oxidation, indicative of O formation. These similarities were attributable to the involvement of a common upstream event resulting in activation of the two O-generating systems, and to intrinsic features of the cells. Both mechanisms required an initial and sequential mobilization of Ca from the inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor and the ryanodine receptor (RyR), with however different implications. The close contacts existing between the RyR and the  created optimal conditions for the Ca clearance, and the ensuing formation of O in RP-cell . Exposure to low concentrations of l-ascorbic acid (AA) transported by high affinity mechanisms in cells and , suppressed O formation. Much more Ca, and hence more arsenite, was necessary to promote NADPH oxidase activation in RD-cells, as a consequence of the cytosolic dilution and mitochondrial clearance of Ca. For the same reasons, an exposure to high concentrations of AA was required to suppress O formation under these conditions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The study was to investigate their role in cardioprotection against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and the underlying mechanism. Isolated hearts from male Sprague-Dawley rats were Langendorff-perfused and cardiac I/R was achieved by 30 min of global ischemia followed by 120 min of reperfusion. Different concentrations of polyamines (0.1, 1, 10, and 15 μmol/L of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine), cyclosporin A (0.2 μmol/L), or atractyloside (20 μmol/L) were given 10 min before the onset of reperfusion. The hemodynamics were monitored; the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in the coronary effluent were measured spectrophotometrically; infarct size was determined by the 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining method; and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening was determined spectrophotometrically by the Ca-induced swelling of isolated cardiac . The results showed that compared to I/R alone, 0.1 and 1 μmol/L polyamines treatment improved heart function, reduced LDH release, decreased infarct size, and these effects were inhibited by atractyloside (MPTP activator). In isolated  from normal rats, 0.1 and 1 μmol/L polyamines treatment inhibited MPTP opening. However, 10 and 15 μmol/L polyamines treatment had the opposite effects, and these effects were inhibited by cyclosporin A (MPTP inhibitor).

The copy numbers of these mitochondrial genes not only varied during leaf development but also differed among each other, and there was no correlation between the copy numbers of the mitochondrial genes and their transcript levels.

However, for hypermetabolic conditions stemming from burn trauma or cancer cachexia, browning is thought to contribute to energy wasting and supraphysiological nutritional requirements. Metformin's impact on this phenomenon and underlying mechanisms have not been explored.We used both a murine burn model and human ex vivo adipose explants to assess metformin and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR)'s effects on the development of subcutaneous beige adipose. Enzymes involved in fat homeostasis and browning, as well as mitochondrial dynamics, were assessed to determine metformin's effects.Treatment with the biguanide metformin lowers lipolysis in beige fat by inducing protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) independently of adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) activation. Increased PP2A activity catalyzes the dephosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Ser 79) and hormone sensitive lipase (Ser 660), thus promoting fat storage and the "whitening" of otherwise lipolytic beige adipocytes. Moreover, co-incubation of metformin with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid countered the anti-lipolytic effects of this biguanide in human adipose. Additionally, we show that metformin does not activate this pathway in the WAT of control mice and that AICAR sustains the browning of white adipose, offering further evidence that metformin acts independently of this cellular energy sensor.This work provides novel insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of metformin's therapeutic benefits and potential as an agent to reduce the lipotoxicity associated with hypermetabolism and adipose browning.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Resveratrol triggers signaling dependent on the protein kinase activated by adenosine monophosphate (AMPK), the sensor of cellular energy metabolism that regulates autophagy, eliminates damaged , and increases energy sources. In the present study, we investigated the participation of AMPK activation in the protective effect of resveratrol on cerebral ischemia and excitotoxicity.

Resveratrol (1.8 mg/Kg; i. v.; administered at the beginning of reperfusion) decreased the infarct area and increased survival of rats subjected to MCAO. In neuronal cultures, resveratrol treatment (40 μM, after excitotoxicity) reduced the production of superoxide anion, prevented the overload of intracellular Ca associated to mitochondrial failure, reduced the release of the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme, and reduced death. It also promoted mitophagy (increased Beclin 1 level, favored the recruitment of LC3-II, reduced LAMP1, and reduced mitochondrial matrix protein HSP60 levels).

Fifteen broilers per group were respectively euthanized, and some samples were respectively collected from the control and the heat stress groups at the end of the 1st week or the 2nd week of heat stress.

However, when the heat stress lasted for the end of the 2nd week, there was no significant difference (P ＞ 0.05) in ADFI, ADG, FCR and serum contents of corticosterone, MDA and GSH. Regardless of duration of thermal stress, the localization of ABCG2 protein had no change.

(ELA) and the potential mechanism in vivo and in vitro.The therapeutic effect of ELA on ischemic cerebral stroke was measured on a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model. Protective effect of ELA on oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R)-induced PC12 cells was measured by MTT assay. The apoptotic cells were observed by Hoechst 33258 staining and acridine orange/ethidium bromide double staining assay.  were observed by Mitotracker staining assay. The mitochondrial membrane potential was determined by JC-1 staining assay. Western blot was used to investigate the effects of ELA on apoptosis-related proteins.We showed that ELA was an effective neuroprotective agent. In vivo experiments, ELA exerted significant protective effect on MCAO model. TTC staining showed that ELA could reduce cerebral infarction area against MCAO insult. HE and Nissl's staining indicated that ELA could reverse the damage of cortex and hippocampus caused by MCAO. In vitro experiments, ELA showed significant protective effect on OGD/R-induced PC12 cells by reducing the number of apoptotic cells, increasing mitochondrial membrane potential, and reducing superoxide aggregation, further suppressing mitochondrial caspase-9/3 apoptosis pathway. Moreover, protective effect of ELA on mitochondrial function may be exerted by inhibiting p53/Puma signal pathway.Our results suggest that ELA exerts a marked neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemia potentially via suppressing p53/Puma-mediated mitochondrial caspase-9/3 apoptosis pathway.Copyright © 2019.

This continual and highly coordinated trafficking process, which takes place via the axon, has fascinated researchers since the early twentieth century. Ramon y Cajal first proposed the existence of axonal trafficking of biological material after observing that dissociation of the axon from the cell body led to neuronal degeneration. Since these first indirect observations, the field has come a long way in its understanding of this fundamental process. However, these advances in our knowledge have been aided by breakthroughs in other scientific disciplines, as well as the parallel development of novel tools, techniques and model systems. In this review, we summarise the evolution of tools used to study axonal transport and discuss how their deployment has refined our understanding of this process. We also highlight innovative tools currently being developed and how their addition to the available axonal transport toolkit might help to address key outstanding questions.

Their maximal activity is specifically triggered in tumors by light and toxicity of even systemically delivered drug is prevented in non-illuminated parts of the body. Photosensitizers exert their therapeutic effect by producing reactive oxygen species  a light-activated reaction with molecular oxygen. Consequently, the lowering of pO deep in solid tumors limits their treatment and makes essential the design of oxygen-independent sensitizers. In this perspective, we have recently developed Ir(III)-based molecules able to oxidize biomolecules by type I processes under free-oxygen conditions. We examine here their photo-toxicity in relevant biological models. We show that drugs, which are -accumulated, induce upon light irradiation a dramatic decrease of the cell viability, even under low oxygen conditions. Finally, assays on 3D tumor spheroids highlight the importance of the light-activation step and the oxygen consumption rate on the drug activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656131>Mitochondrial Protein Poldip2 Controls VSMC Differentiated Phenotype by O-Linked GlcNAc Transferase-Dependent Inhibition of a Ubiquitin Proteasome System.</a></h2><p> The mitochondrial protein polymerase interacting protein 2 (Poldip2) is required for the activity of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. As a consequence, Poldip2 deficiency induces metabolic reprograming with repressed mitochondrial respiration and increased glycolytic activity. Though homozygous deletion of Poldip2 is lethal, heterozygous mice are viable and show protection against aneurysm and injury-induced neointimal hyperplasia, diseases linked to loss of VSMC differentiation. Thus, we hypothesize that the metabolic reprograming induced by Poldip2 deficiency controls VSMC differentiation.  To determine the role of Poldip2-mediated metabolic reprograming in phenotypic modulation of VSMC.  We show that Poldip2 deficiency in vascular smooth muscle in vitro and in vivo induces the expression of the serum response factor (SRF), Myocardin, and MRTFA and dramatically represses KLF4. Consequently, Poldip2-deficient VSMC and mouse aorta express high levels of contractile proteins and, more significantly, these cells do not dedifferentiate nor acquire macrophage-like characteristics when exposed to Cholesterol or PDGF. Regarding the mechanism, we found that Poldip2 deficiency upregulates the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway and OGT-mediated protein O-GlcNAcylation. Increased protein glycosylation causes the inhibition of a nuclear UPS responsible for SRF stabilization and KLF4 repression and is required for the establishment of the differentiated phenotype in Poldip2-deficient cells.  Our data show that Poldip2 deficiency induces a highly differentiated phenotype in VSMCs through a mechanism that involves regulation of metabolism and proteostasis. Additionally, our study positions -initiated signaling as key element of the VSMC differentiation programs that can be targeted to modulate VSMC phenotype during vascular diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646322>Ferroptosis was involved in the oleic acid-induced acute lung injury in mice.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of ferroptosis in acute lung injury (ALI) mouse model induced by oleic acid (OA). ALI was induced in the mice via the lateral tail vein injection of pure OA. The histopathological score of lung, lung wet-dry weight ratio and the protein content of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were used as the evaluation indexes of ALI. Iron concentration, glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in the lung tissues were measured using corresponding assay kits. The ultrastructure of pulmonary cells was observed by transmission electron microscope (TEM), and the expression level of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) mRNA was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR). Protein expression levels of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), ferritin and transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) in lung tissues were determined by Western blot. The results showed that histopathological scores of lung tissues, lung wet-dry weight ratio and protein in BALF in the OA group were higher than those of the control group. In the OA group, the  of pulmonary cells were shrunken, and the mitochondrial membrane was ruptured. The expression level of PTGS2 mRNA in the OA group was seven folds over that in the control group. Iron overload, GSH depletion and accumulation of MDA were observed in the OA group. Compared with the control group, the protein expression levels of GPX4 and ferritin in lung tissue were down-regulated in the OA group. These results suggest that ferroptosis plays a potential role in the pathogenesis of ALI in our mouse model, which may provide new insights for development of new drugs for ALI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657561>Proteasome independent protein knockdown by small-molecule inhibitor for the undruggable lung adenocarcinoma.</a></h2><p>Therapeutic target identification and corresponding drug development is a demanding task for the treatment of lung adeno-carcinoma, especially the most malignant proximal-proliferative subtype without druggable protein kinase mutations. Using a cell-SELEX-generated aptamer, we discovered a new tumor driver protein, leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein (LRPPRC), which is specifically overexpressed in the most lethal subtype of lung adenocarcinoma. Tar-geted LRPPRC protein knockdown is a promising therapeutic strategy for the undruggable LUAD (lung adenocarcinoma). Nevertheless, LRPPRC is mainly located in  and degraded by protease. Current protein knockdown approaches, such as proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), have limitations in their applications to the proteins degraded through proteasome-independent ways. Here, we designed an aptamer-assisted high-throughput method to screen small molecules which could bind to LRPPRC directly, disrupt the interaction of LRPPRC with its stabilizing chaperon protein, and lead to LRPPRC degradation by mitochondrial protease. The screened compound, gossypol-acetic acid (GAA), is an old medicine which can accomplish the new function for targeted LRPPRC knockdown. It showed significant antitumor effects even with the LRPPRC positive patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) model. This work not only extended the application of ap-tamers to screen small-molecule inhibitors for the undruggable lung cancers, but more importantly provided a new strategy to develop protein knockdown methods beyond the proteasome system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640182>N-Acetylcysteine Attenuates the Increasing Severity of Distant Organ Liver Dysfunction after Acute Kidney Injury in Rats Exposed to Bisphenol A.</a></h2><p>Distant organ liver damage after acute kidney injury (AKI) remains a serious clinical setting with high mortality. This undesirable outcome may be due to some hidden factors that can intensify the consequences of AKI. Exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), a universal chemical used in plastics industry, is currently unavoidable and can be harmful to the liver. This study explored whether BPA exposure could be a causative factor that increase severity of remote liver injury after AKI and examined the preventive benefit by N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in this complex condition. Male Wistar rats were given vehicle, BPA, or BPA + NAC for 5 weeks then underwent 45 min renal ischemia followed by 24 h reperfusion (RIR), a group of vehicle-sham-control was also included. RIR not only induced AKI but produced liver injury, triggered systemic oxidative stress as well as inflammation, which increasing severity upon exposure to BPA. Given NAC to BPA-exposed rats diminished the added-on effects of BPA on liver functional impairment, oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis caused by AKI. NAC also mitigated the abnormalities in mitochondrial functions, dynamics, mitophagy, and ultrastructure of the liver by improving the mitochondrial homeostasis regulatory signaling AMPK-PGC-1α-SIRT3. The study demonstrates that NAC is an effective adjunct for preserving mitochondrial homeostasis and reducing remote effects of AKI in environments where BPA exposure is vulnerable.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653868>Regulation of the ER stress response by a mitochondrial microprotein.</a></h2><p>Cellular homeostasis relies on having dedicated and coordinated responses to a variety of stresses. The accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a common stress that triggers a conserved pathway called the unfolded protein response (UPR) that mitigates damage, and dysregulation of UPR underlies several debilitating diseases. Here, we discover that a previously uncharacterized 54-amino acid microprotein PIGBOS regulates UPR. PIGBOS localizes to the mitochondrial outer membrane where it interacts with the ER protein CLCC1 at ER- contact sites. Functional studies reveal that the loss of PIGBOS leads to heightened UPR and increased cell death. The characterization of PIGBOS reveals an undiscovered role for a mitochondrial protein, in this case a microprotein, in the regulation of UPR originating in the ER. This study demonstrates microproteins to be an unappreciated class of genes that are critical for inter-organelle communication, homeostasis, and cell survival.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661602>Tracking 's intra- and inter-organelle signaling.</a></h2><p> are as highly specialized organelles and masters of the cellular energy metabolism in a constant and dynamic interplay with their cellular environment, providing adenosine trisphosphate, buffering Ca and fundamentally contributing to various signaling pathways.

ROS are also produced by NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidases in response to growth factors and cytokines by normal physiological signaling pathways. NADPH oxidase, a member of NOX family, utilizes molecular oxygen (O2) to generate ROS such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide (O2•-). Imbalance between ROS production and its elimination is known to be the major cause of various human diseases. NOX family proteins are exclusively involved in ROS production which makes them attractive target(s) for the treatment of ROS-mediated diseases including cancer. Molecules such as Keap1/Nrf2, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDRs), NF-κB, KRAS, kallistatin, gene associated with retinoic-interferon-induced mortality-19 and deregulated metabolic pathways are involved in ROS production in association with NADPH oxidase. Therapeutic strategies targeting NADPH oxidases in ROS driven cancers are not very effective due to its complex regulatory circuit. Tumor suppressor miRNAs viz. miR-34a, miR-137, miR-99a, and miR-21a-3p targeting NADPH oxidases are predominantly downregulated in ROS driven cancers. miRNAs also regulate other cellular machineries such as Keap1/Nrf2 pathway and NMDRs involved in ROS production and consequently drug resistance. Here we discuss the structure, function and metabolic role of NADPH oxidase, NOX family protein-protein interaction, their association with other pathways and NADPH oxidase alteration by miRNAs. Moreover, we also discuss and summarize studies on NADPH oxidase-associated with various malignancies and their therapeutic implications. Targeting NADPH oxidases through miRNAs appears to be a promising strategy for the treatment of ROS driven cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658733>20(S)-Ginsenoside Rg3 Promotes HeLa Cell Apoptosis by Regulating Autophagy.</a></h2><p>20()-Ginsenoside Rg3 (GRg3) has various bioactivities including anti-cancer effects and inhibition of autophagy. However, no reports have investigated the appearance of autophagy or the connection between autophagy and apoptosis in HeLa cells treated with 20()-GRg3. Cell viability was measured by CCK-8 (cell counting kit-8) assays. Apoptosis and the cell cycle were analyzed by Hoechst 33342 staining and flow cytometry. Apoptotic pathways were examined by ROS (reactive oxygen species) determination and rhodamine 123 assays. Western blot analysis was used to determine changes in protein levels. Autophagy induction was monitored by acidic vesicular organelle staining and EGFP-LC3 transfection. 20()-GRg3 inhibited autophagy of cells in a starved state, making it impossible for cells to maintain a steady state through autophagy, and then induced apoptosis. 20()-GRg3 blocked the late stage of autophagy (fusion of lysosomes and degradation of autophagic lysosomes), including a decrease in acidic vesicular organelle fluorescence, increased LC3 I-II conversion, accumulation of EGFP-LC3 fluorescence, GFP-mRFP-LC3 red-green fluorescence ratio, degradation of the substrate p62, and loss of the balance between autophagy and apoptosis, which induced apoptosis. ROS increased, the mitochondrial membrane potential decreased, apoptotic inducer AIF was released from , and nuclear transfer occurred, triggering a series of subsequent apoptotic events. Autophagy inducer rapamycin inhibited the apoptosis induced by 20()-GRg3, whereas autophagy inhibitor BA1 promoted apoptosis induced by 20()-GRg3. Therefore, 20()-GRg3 promoted HeLa cell apoptosis by regulating autophagy. In the autophagic state, 20()-GRg3 can be used as a novel autophagy inhibitor in synergy with tumor-blocking therapies such as chemotherapy, which supports its application in the medical field.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659149>Tunneling nanotube-mediated intercellular vesicle and protein transfer in the stroma-provided imatinib resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia cells.</a></h2><p>Intercellular communication within the bone marrow niche significantly promotes leukemogenesis and provides protection of leukemic cells from therapy. Secreted factors, intercellular transfer of  and the receptor-ligand interactions have been shown as mediators of this protection. Here we report that tunneling nanotubes (TNTs)-long, thin membranous structures, which have been identified as a novel mode of intercellular cross-talk-are formed in the presence of stroma and mediate transfer of cellular vesicles from stroma to leukemic cells. Importantly, transmission of vesicles via TNTs from stromal cells increases resistance of leukemic cells to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib. Using correlative light-electron microscopy and electron tomography we show that stromal TNTs contain vesicles, provide membrane continuity with the cell bodies and can be open-ended. Moreover, trans-SILAC studies to reveal the non-autonomous proteome showed that specific sets of proteins are transferred together with cellular vesicles from stromal to leukemic cells, with a potential role in survival and adaptation. Altogether, our findings provide evidence for the biological role of the TNT-mediated vesicle exchange between stromal and leukemic cells, implicating the direct vesicle and protein transfer in the stroma-provided protection of leukemic cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671612>Successful Targeting of the Warburg Effect in Prostate Cancer by Glucose-Conjugated 1,4-Naphthoquinones.</a></h2><p>Treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains challenging due to the development of drug resistance. The Warburg effect describes the ability of cancer cells to consume larger amounts of glucose compared to normal tissues. We identified derivatives of natural 1,4-naphthoquinones to be active in CRPC and further synthetically modified them via glucose conjugation to increase selectivity by Warburg effect targeting. Mechanisms of action were examined by quantitative proteomics followed by bioinformatical analysis and target validation. Four synthesized molecules revealed the highest selectivity towards human CRPC cells, which correlated with higher GLUT-1 activity and expression. The compounds were able to induce pro-apoptotic signs and to inhibit the pro-survival processes and mechanisms of drug resistance (i.e., AR-signaling and autophagy). Proteome analysis suggested a disruption of the /oxidative phosphorylation, which was validated by further functional analysis: thus,  depolarization, elevated levels of cytotoxic ROS, an increase of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio as well as release of mitochondrial AIF and cytochrome C to cytoplasm were observed. In conclusion, glucose-conjugated 1,4-naphthoquinones show potent activity and selectivity in human CRPC exerted via mitochondrial targeting. The compounds can overcome drug resistance against current standard therapies and suppress pro-survival mechanisms. This unique combination of properties makes them new promising candidates for the treatment of CRPC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667702>Seawater Immersion Aggravates Early Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Increases Neuronal Apoptosis After Traumatic Brain Injury.</a></h2><p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability in naval warfare. Due to the unique physiochemical properties of seawater, immersion in it exacerbates TBI and induces severe neural damage and complications. However, the characteristics and underlying mechanisms of seawater-immersed TBI remain unclear. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a major cause of TBI-associated brain damage because it leads to oxidative stress, decrease in energy production, and apoptosis. Thus, the present study aimed to further elucidate the current understanding of the pathology of seawater-immersed TBI, particularly the role of mitochondrial dysfunction, using a well-defined rat model of fluid percussion injury and a stretch injury model comprising cultured neurons. The biochemical and pathological markers of brain-related and neuronal injuries were evaluated. Histological analysis suggested that seawater immersion enhanced brain tissue injury and induced a significant increase in apoptosis in rats with TBI. Additionally, lactate dehydrogenase release occurred earlier and at higher levels in stretched neurons at 24 h after seawater immersion, which was consistent with more severe morphological changes and enhanced apoptosis. Furthermore, seawater immersion induced more rapid decreases in mitochondrial membrane potential, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content, and H-ATPase activity in the cortices of TBI rats. In addition, the immunochemical results revealed that seawater immersion further attenuated mitochondrial function in neurons exposed to stretch injury. The increases in neuronal damage and apoptosis triggered by seawater immersion were positively correlated with mitochondrial dysfunction in both in vivo and in vitro models. Thus, the present findings strengthen the current understanding of seawater-immersed TBI. Moreover, because seawater immersion aggravates mitochondrial dysfunction and contributes to post-traumatic neuronal cell death, it is important to consider  as a therapeutic target for seawater-immersed TBI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669061>The impact of nandrolone decanoate abuse on experimental animal model: Hormonal and biochemical assessment.</a></h2><p>Nandrolone decanoate (ND) is one of the most commonly abused anabolic androgenic steroids compounds in the world owing to its ability to improve physical performance but its abuse is associated with several adverse effects. The current study was performed to evaluate the effect of recommended and overdose of nandrolone decanoate (ND) for short and long term on the alterations of biochemical markers related to kidney, liver, adrenal, thyroid gland functions and oxidant and antioxidant activities. Sixty male rats were randomly assigned into two major groups. The first was treated with ND for 6 weeks and the second was treated with same drug for 12 weeks. Each of these groups was further subdivided into three sub groups: 1-Control (untreated rats), 2- Rats intraperitoneally injected with ND 3 mg/kg weekly, 3- Rats intraperitoneally injected with ND 15 mg/kg weekly.

However, we do not know the mechanism that explain this effect. The aim of this study was to assess the role that the subcellular organelle phenotype plays in early cardiac reverse after short-term treatment with esmolol.14-Month-old male SHRs were randomly assigned to receive esmolol (300 μg/kg/min) (SHR-E) or vehicle (SHR).

We compared the mt genomes of the 27 fungal species in the Pezizomycotina and Basidiomycotina subphyla, with the results revealing that H. marmoreus is a sister to Tricholoma matsutake and the phylogenetic distribution of this fungus based on the mt genome. Phylogenetic analysis shows that Ascomycetes  started to diverge earlier than that of Basidiomycetes and supported the robustness of the hyper metric tree. The fungal sequences are highly polymorphic and gene order varies significantly in the dikarya data set, suggesting a correlation between the gene order and divergence time in the fungi mt genome. To detect the mt genome variations in H. marmoreus, we analyzed the mtDNA sequences of 48 strains. The phylogeny and variation sited type statistics of H. marmoreus provide clear-cut evidence for the existence of four well-defined cultivations isolated lineages, suggesting female ancestor origin of H. marmoreus. Furthermore, variations on two loci were further identified to be molecular markers for distinguishing the subgroup containing 32 strains of other strains. Fifteen conserved protein-coding genes of mtDNAs were analyzed, with fourteen revealed to be under purifying selection in the examined fungal species, suggesting the rapid evolution was caused by positive selection of this gene.Our studies have provided new reference mt genomes and comparisons between species and intraspecies with other strains, and provided future perspectives for assessing diversity and origin of H. marmoreus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645842>Metformin restores the mitochondrial membrane potentials in association with a reduction in TIMM23 and NDUFS3 in MPP+-induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells.</a></h2><p>SH-SY5Y cells exposed to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP) develop mitochondrial dysfunction and other cellular responses similar to those that occur in the dopaminergic neurons of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). It has been shown in animal models of PD that neuronal death can be prevented by metformin, an anti-diabetic drug. Both MPP and metformin inhibit complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. It has been reported that decreased levels of the mitochondrial inner membrane proteins TIMM23 and NDUFS3 are associated with the increased generation of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial depolarization. In the present study, we investigated the effects of metformin on MPP-induced neurotoxicity using differentiated human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. The results showed that pretreatment with metformin increased the viability of MPP-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Pretreatment with metformin decreased the expression of TIMM23 and NDUFS3 in MPP-treated SH-SY5Y cells. This was correlated with reduced mitochondrial fragmentation and an improvement in the mitochondrial membrane potential.

Therefore to investigate, we treated Raw264.7 cells with IL-6 (1hr prior to irradiation) and examined the glycolytic flux. Increased expression of mRNA and protein levels of key glycolytic enzymes was observed after IL-6 treatment, which conferred glycolysis dependent resistance from radiation induced cell death. We further established that IL-6 induced glycolysis is activated by Akt signaling and knocking down Akt or inhibition of pan Akt phosphorylation significantly abrogated the IL-6 induced radio-resistance. Moreover, reduction of IL-6 induced pAkt level suppressed the expression of Hexokinase-2 and its translocation to the , thereby inhibiting the glycolysis induced resistance to radiation. IL-6 induced glycolysis also minimized the radiation induced mitochondrial damage. These results suggest that IL-6 induced glycolysis observed in cells may be responsible for IL-6 mediated therapeutic radio-resistance in cancer cells, partly by activation of Akt signaling.© The Author(s) 2019.

Autosomal-dominant inheritance of a R94Q mutation in MFN2 causes the axonal subtype 2A2A which is characterized by early onset and progressive atrophy of distal muscles caused by motoneuronal degeneration. Here, we studied mitochondrial shape, respiration, cytosolic, and mitochondrial ATP content as well as mitochondrial quality control in MFN2-deficient fibroblasts stably expressing wildtype or R94Q MFN2. Under normal culture conditions, R94Q cells had slightly more fragmented  but a similar mitochondrial oxygen consumption, membrane potential, and ATP production as wildtype cells. However, when inducing mild oxidative stress 24 h before analysis using 100 µM hydrogen peroxide, R94Q cells exhibited significantly increased respiration but decreased mitochondrial ATP production. This was accompanied by increased glucose uptake and an up-regulation of hexokinase 1 and pyruvate kinase M2, suggesting increased pyruvate shuttling into . Interestingly, these changes coincided with decreased levels of PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy in R94Q cells. We conclude that  harboring the disease-causing R94Q mutation in MFN2 are more susceptible to oxidative stress, which causes uncoupling of respiration and ATP production possibly by a less efficient mitochondrial quality control.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654556>PINK1 overexpression protects against cerebral ischemia through Parkin regulation.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial dynamics and function are important for cell survival regulation under stress.

PINK1 overexpression mice significantly improved mitochondrial function by increased mitochondrial complex I, II, and III activities and ATP levels with concomitant decline in reactive oxygen species levels. PINK1 overexpression mice after I/R injury significantly reduced apoptosis through downregulation of cytochrome c, p53 expressions compared to cerebral I/R injury rats. Furthermore, we showed from parkin siRNA studies that PINK1 regulated phosphorylation parkin is critical to the protection against cerebral I/R injury. Altogether, we show that PINK1 mediated parkin regulation is key to the protection against cerebral I/R injury through regulation of mitochondrial function and apoptosis.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661466>Uncoupled turnover disrupts mitochondrial quality control in diabetic retinopathy.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial quality control (MQC) is crucial for regulating central nervous system homeostasis and its disruption has been implicated in the pathogenesis of some of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. In healthy tissues, the maintenance of MQC depends upon an exquisite balance between mitophagy (removal of damaged  by autophagy) and biogenesis (de-novo synthesis of ). Here, we show that mitophagy is disrupted in diabetic retinopathy (DR) and decoupled from mitochondrial biogenesis during the progression of the disease. Diabetic retinas from human post-mortem donors and experimental mice exhibit a net loss of mitochondrial contents during the early stages of the disease process. Using novel diabetic mitophagy-reporter mice (mitoQC-Ins2Akita) alongside pMitoTimer (a molecular clock to address mitochondrial-age dynamics), we demonstrate that mitochondrial loss arose due to an inability of mitochondrial biogenesis to compensate for diabetes-exacerbated mitophagy. However, as diabetes duration increases, Pink1-dependent mitophagy deteriorates, leading to the build-up of  primed for degradation in DR. Impairment of mitophagy during prolonged diabetes is linked with the development of retinal senescence, a phenotype that blunted hyperglycaemia-induced mitophagy in mitoQC primary Müller cells. Our findings suggest that normalizing mitochondrial turnover may preserve MQC and provide novel therapeutic options for the management of DR-associated complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669238>The basic machineries for mitochondrial protein quality control.</a></h2><p> play pivotal roles in cellular energy metabolism, the synthesis of essential biomolecules and the regulation of cell death and aging.

The mitochondrial gatekeeper, voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), mediates transport of metabolites and ions in and out of , and is involved in -mediated apoptosis. Here, we compared the effects of reducing hVDAC1 expression in a glioblastoma xenograft using human-specific si-RNA (si-hVDAC1) for a short (19 days) and a long term (40 days). Tumors underwent reprograming, reflected in rewired metabolism, eradication of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and differentiation. Short- and long-term treatments of the tumors with si-hVDAC1 similarly reduced the expression of metabolism-related enzymes, and translocator protein (TSPO) and CSCs markers. In contrast, differentiation into cells expressing astrocyte or neuronal markers was noted only after a long period during which the tumor cells were hVDAC1-depleted. This suggests that tumor cell differentiation is a prolonged process that precedes metabolic reprograming and the "disappearance" of CSCs. Tumor proteomics analysis revealing global changes in the expression levels of proteins associated with signaling, synthesis and degradation of proteins, DNA structure and replication and epigenetic changes, all of which were highly altered after a long period of si-hVDAC1 tumor treatment. The depletion of hVDAC1 greatly reduced the levels of the multifunctional translocator protein TSPO, which is overexpressed in both the  and the nucleus of the tumor. The results thus show that VDAC1 depletion-mediated cancer cell metabolic reprograming involves a chain of events occurring in a sequential manner leading to a reversal of the unique properties of the tumor, indicative of the interplay between metabolism and oncogenic signaling networks.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668873>Proteomics-Based Comparative Mapping of the Secretomes of Human Brown and White Adipocytes Reveals EPDR1 as a Novel Batokine.</a></h2><p>Adipokines secreted from white adipose tissue play a role in metabolic crosstalk and homeostasis, whereas the brown adipose secretome is less explored. We performed high-sensitivity mass-spectrometry-based proteomics on the cell media of human adipocytes derived from the supraclavicular brown adipose and from the subcutaneous white adipose depots of adult humans. We identified 471 potentially secreted proteins covering interesting categories such as hormones, growth factors, extracellular matrix proteins, and proteins of the complement system, which were differentially regulated between brown and white adipocytes. A total of 101 proteins were exclusively quantified in brown adipocytes, and among these was ependymin-related protein 1 (EPDR1). EPDR1 was detected in human plasma, and functional studies suggested a role for EPDR1 in thermogenic determination during adipogenesis. In conclusion, we report substantial differences between the secretomes of brown and white human adipocytes and identify novel candidate batokines that can be important regulators of human metabolism.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we show that the cytochrome c oxidase (COX)-1, a core catalytic subunit of mitochondrial complex IV, was acetylated and deactivated both in 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride-treated NIH/3T3 cells and hydrogen peroxide-treated primary neuronal cells, correlating with apoptotic cell death induction by oxidative stress. Inhibition of Sirt3 by small interfering RNA or the inhibitor nicotinamide induced accumulation of acetylation of COX-1, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, and increased cell apoptosis. In contrast, overexpression of Sirt3 enhanced deacetylation of COX-1 and inhibited oxidative stress-induced apoptotic cell death. Significantly, rats treated with ischemia/reperfusion injury, a typical oxidative stress-related disease, presented an inhibition of Sirt3-induced hyperacetylation of COX-1 in the brain tissues. Furthermore, K13, K264, K319, and K481 were identified as the acetylation sits of COX-1 in response to oxidative stress.

However, the molecular mechanisms regulating apoptosis during mycobacterial infection are not well known. Recent reports suggest that bacterial infection regulates mitochondrial fusion and fission in various ways. Here, we investigated the role of  in  (Mtb)-infected macrophages. Mtb H37Rv (Rv) infection induced mitofusin 2 (MFN2) degradation, leading to mitochondrial fission. Interestingly, Mtb H37Ra (Ra) infection induced significantly greater mitochondrial fragmentation than Rv infection. Mtb-mediated Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, contributed to the degradation of MFN2. To evaluate the role of endoplasmic reticulum stress in the production of Parkin during Mtb infection, we analyzed Parkin production in 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA)-pretreated macrophages. Pretreatment with 4-PBA reduced Parkin production in Mtb-infected macrophages. In contrast, the level of MFN2 production recovered to a level similar to that of the unstimulated control. In addition, Ra-infected macrophages had reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) compared to those infected with Rv. Interestingly, intracellular survival of mycobacteria was decreased in siMFN2-transfected macrophages; in contrast, overexpression of MFN2 in macrophages increased Mtb growth compared with the control.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660989>Genetic relevance and determinants of mitral leaflet size in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.</a></h2><p>Whether mitral leaflet elongation is a primary phenotype of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is controversial. We investigated the genetic relevance and determinants of mitral leaflet size by performing extensive gene analyses in patients with HCM.Anterior mitral leaflet (AML) lengths were measured in HCM patients (n = 211) and age- and sex-matched controls (n = 30) using echocardiography with hemodynamic and chamber geometric assessments. We analyzed 82 nuclear DNA (8 sarcomeric genes, 74 other HCM-associated genes) and mitochondrial DNA. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) was performed in the 132 HCM patients.Average indexed AML was significantly longer for HCM than for controls (17.2 ± 2.3 vs. 13.3 ± 1.6 mm/m, P <  0.001). Average AML length correlated with body surface area (BSA), left ventricular (LV) end-systolic volume (P <  0.001) and LV mass by CMR (P < 0.001). Average indexed AML by BSA of pure-apical HCM was significantly shorter than other typed HCM (16.6 ± 2.0 vs. 17.4 ± 2.4 mm/m, P = 0.025). Indexed AML was independently correlated with left atrial wall stress. The thin filament mutation group showed larger average AML (31.9 ± 3.8 vs. 29.6 ± 3.8 mm, P = 0.045), but this was not significant with the indexed value. No difference in AML size among subgroups was observed based on the presence of sarcomere protein or -related gene variants (P > 0.05).AML elongation was a unique finding of HCM. However, the leaflet size was more related to chamber geometry and hypertrophy pattern rather than genetic factors within overt HCM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669601>Alteration of mitochondrial DNA homeostasis in drug-induced liver injury.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes for 13 proteins involved in the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) process. In liver, genetic or acquired impairment of mtDNA homeostasis can reduce ATP output but also decrease fatty acid oxidation, thus leading to different hepatic lesions including massive necrosis and microvesicular steatosis. Hence, a severe impairment of mtDNA homeostasis can lead to liver failure and death. An increasing number of investigations report that some drugs can induce mitochondrial dysfunction and drug-induced liver injury (DILI) by altering mtDNA homeostasis. Some drugs such as ciprofloxacin, antiretroviral nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors and tacrine can inhibit hepatic mtDNA replication, thus inducing mtDNA depletion. Drug-induced reduced mtDNA levels can also be the consequence of reactive oxygen species-mediated oxidative damage to mtDNA, which triggers its degradation by mitochondrial nucleases. Such mechanism is suspected for acetaminophen and troglitazone. Other pharmaceuticals such as linezolid and tetracyclines can impair mtDNA translation, thus selectively reducing the synthesis of the 13 mtDNA-encoded proteins. Lastly, some drugs might alter the mtDNA methylation status but the pathophysiological consequences of such alteration are still unclear. Drug-induced impairment of mtDNA homeostasis is probably under-recognized since preclinical and post-marketing safety studies do not classically investigate mtDNA levels, mitochondrial protein synthesis and mtDNA oxidative damage.Copyright © 2019.

These pathological conditions make  of a particular interest in the regulation of cell function and death by both apoptosis and autophagy. Therefore, this work was undertaken to investigate  function, autophagy and apoptosis protein markers in the kidney from rat model of intra-abdominal obesity and renal damage induced by high sucrose diet.  from sucrose fed (SF) kidney in the presence of pyruvate/malate generated hydrogen peroxide (HO) at a higher rate than from control (79.81 ± 4.98 vs 65.84 ± 1.95 pmol/min/mg protein). With succinate, the release of HO was significantly higher compared with pyruvate/malate and it remained higher in SF than in control  (146.4 ± 8.8 vs 106.1 ± 5.9 pmol/min/mg protein). However, cytochrome c release from SF kidney  was lower than from control. In addition, cardiolipin, a mitochondrial-specific phospholipid was found increased in SF  due to the enhanced amount of both cardiolipin synthase and tafazzin. Cardiolipin was also found enriched with saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids which are less susceptible to peroxidative stress involved in cytochrome c release. Furthermore, Beclin-1, LC3-B, as autophagy protein markers, and caspase 9 as apoptosis protein marker, were found decreased in SF kidney. These results suggest that the decline of autophagy protein markers and the lack of apoptosis process could be a pathological mechanism of cell dysfunction leading to the progression of renal disease in SF rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664682>Identification of PP2A and S6 Kinase as Modifiers of Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase-Induced Neurotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Mutations in LRRK2 are currently recognized as the most common monogenetic cause of Parkinsonism. The elevation of kinase activity of LRRK2 that frequently accompanies its mutations is widely thought to contribute to its toxicity. Accordingly, many groups have developed LRRK2-specific kinase inhibitors as a potential therapeutic strategy. Given that protein phosphorylation is a reversible event, we sought to elucidate the phosphatase(s) that can reverse LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation, with the view that targeting this phosphatase(s) may similarly be beneficial. Using an unbiased RNAi phosphatase screen conducted in a Drosophila LRRK2 model, we identified PP2A as a genetic modulator of LRRK2-induced neurotoxicity. Further, we also identified ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K), a target of PP2A, as a novel regulator of LRRK2 function. Finally, we showed that modulation of PP2A or S6K activities ameliorates LRRK2-associated disease phenotype in Drosophila.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647067>A cyanine-derivative photosensitizer with enhanced photostability for -targeted photodynamic therapy.</a></h2><p>A cyanine-derivative photosensitizer, CYBF2, was synthesized for photodynamic therapy of cancer.

To investigate the underlying systems biology of Allo action in AD models in vivo, we assessed the regulation of Allo on the bioenergetic system of the brain. Outcomes of these analysis indicated that Allo significantly reversed deficits in mitochondrial respiration and biogenesis and key mitochondrial enzyme activity and reduced lipid peroxidation in the 3xTgAD mice in vivo. To explore the mechanisms by which Allo regulates the brain metabolism, we conducted targeted transcriptome analysis. These data further confirmed that Allo upregulated genes involved in glucose metabolism, mitochondrial bioenergetics, and signaling pathways while simultaneously downregulating genes involved in Alzheimer's pathology, fatty acid metabolism, and mitochondrial uncoupling and dynamics. Upstream regulatory pathway analysis predicted that Allo induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) and coactivator 1-alpha (PPARGC1A) pathways while simultaneously inhibiting the presenilin 1 (PSEN 1), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) pathways to reduce AD pathology. Collectively, these data indicate that Allo functions as a systems biology regulator of bioenergetics, cholesterol homeostasis, and β-amyloid reduction in the brain. These systems are critical to neurological health, thus providing a plausible mechanistic rationale for Allo as a therapeutic to promote neural cell function and reduce the burden of AD pathology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672551>Fasting reveals largely intact systemic lipid mobilization mechanisms in respiratory chain complex III deficient mice.</a></h2><p>Mice homozygous for the human GRACILE syndrome mutation (Bcs1l) display decreased respiratory chain complex III activity, liver dysfunction, hypoglycemia, rapid loss of white adipose tissue and early death. To assess the underlying mechanism of the lipodystrophy in homozygous mice (Bcs1l), these and wild-type control mice were subjected to a short 4-hour fast. The homozygotes had low baseline blood glucose values, but a similar decrease in response to fasting as in wild-type mice, resulting in hypoglycemia in the majority. Despite the already depleted glycogen and increased triacylglycerol content in the mutant livers, the mice responded to fasting by further depletion and increase, respectively. Increased plasma free fatty acids (FAs) upon fasting suggested normal capacity for mobilization of lipids from white adipose tissue into circulation. Strikingly, however, serum glycerol concentration was not increased concomitantly with free FAs, suggesting its rapid uptake into the liver and utilization for fuel or gluconeogenesis in the mutants. The mutant hepatocyte  were capable of responding to fasting by appropriate morphological changes, as analyzed by electron microscopy, and by increasing respiration. Mutants showed increased hepatic gene expression of major metabolic controllers typically associated with fasting response (Ppargc1a, Fgf21, Cd36) already in the fed state, suggesting a chronic starvation-like metabolic condition. Despite this, the mutant mice responded largely normally to fasting by increasing hepatic respiration and switching to FA utilization, indicating that the mechanisms driving these adaptations are not compromised by the CIII dysfunction. SUMMARY STATEMENT: Bcs1l mutant mice with severe CIII deficiency, energy deprivation and post-weaning lipolysis respond to fasting similarly to wild-type mice, suggesting largely normal systemic lipid mobilization and utilization mechanisms.Copyright © 2019.

Our study focuses on N -methylation of Adenosine ribonucleotides (m A-RNA) in plant . m A is a prevalent modification in nuclear-encoded mRNAs. The biological significance of this dynamic modification is under investigation, but it is widely accepted that m A mediates structural switches which affect RNA stability and/or activity. Using m A-pulldown/RNA-seq (m A-RIP-seq) assays of Arabidopsis and cauliflower , we provide here with information on the m A-RNA landscapes in Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica oleracea . The results show that m A targets different types of mitochondrial transcripts, including known genes, mtORFs, as well as non-coding (transcribed intergenic) RNA species. While ncRNAs undergo multiple m A modifications, m A-modifications within mRNAs seem preferably positioned near start-codons and may modulate their translatability.© 2019 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671879>Autophagy in Cancer Cell Death.</a></h2><p>Autophagy has important functions in maintaining energy metabolism under conditions of starvation and to alleviate stress by removal of damaged and potentially harmful cellular components. Therefore, autophagy represents a pro-survival stress response in the majority of cases. However, the role of autophagy in cell survival and cell death decisions is highly dependent on its extent, duration, and on the respective cellular context. An alternative pro-death function of autophagy has been consistently observed in different settings, in particular, in developmental cell death of lower organisms and in drug-induced cancer cell death. This cell death is referred to as autophagic cell death (ACD) or autophagy-dependent cell death (ADCD), a type of cellular demise that may act as a backup cell death program in apoptosis-deficient tumors. This pro-death function of autophagy may be exerted either via non-selective bulk autophagy or excessive (lethal) removal of  via selective mitophagy, opening new avenues for the therapeutic exploitation of autophagy/mitophagy in cancer treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668496>The NADH Dehydrogenase Nde1 Executes Cell Death after Integrating Signals from Metabolism and Proteostasis on the Mitochondrial Surface.</a></h2><p>The proteolytic turnover of mitochondrial proteins is poorly understood. Here, we used a combination of dynamic isotope labeling and mass spectrometry to gain a global overview of mitochondrial protein turnover in yeast cells. Intriguingly, we found an exceptionally high turnover of the NADH dehydrogenase, Nde1. This homolog of the mammalian apoptosis inducing factor, AIF, forms two distinct topomers in , one residing in the intermembrane space while the other spans the outer membrane and is exposed to the cytosol. The surface-exposed topomer triggers cell death in response to pro-apoptotic stimuli. The surface-exposed topomer is degraded by the cytosolic proteasome/Cdc48 system and the mitochondrial protease Yme1; however, it is strongly enriched in respiratory-deficient cells. Our data suggest that in addition to their role in electron transfer, mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenases such as Nde1 or AIF integrate signals from energy metabolism and cytosolic proteostasis to eliminate compromised cells from growing populations.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The liver-related burden of NASH is likely to increase and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is probably to be the leading indication for liver transplantation by 2020, as a consequence of increased disease prevalence and of the lack of an effective treatment. The first step in the NAFLD development is represented by fat accumulation in the liver, a condition that is commonly associated with features of the metabolic syndrome. Notably, it has been acknowledged that the step from nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) to NASH is key step in the NASH formation, and the mechanisms behind this transition have been extensively studied. Emerging evidence indicates that innate immunity is a driving force in NAFLD progression because it directly regulates all key pathogenic features of the disease processes, including metabolic dysregulation, inflammation, and fibrosis.

Though novel combination chemotherapy of autophagy inducers with chemotherapeutic agents is extensively investigated, nanomedicine-based combination therapy for ACD remains in infancy. In attempt to actively trigger ACD for synergistic chemotherapy, here we incorporated autophagy inducer rapamycin (RAP) into 7pep-modified PEG-DSPE polymer micelles (7pep-M-RAP) to specifically target and efficiently priming ACD of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells with high expression of transferrin receptor (TfR).

The placenta provides the fetus with the necessary nutrition and oxygen and takes away the metabolic waste. Patients with GDM are diagnosed and treated merely on the basis of the blood glucose level; this approach does nothing to help evaluate the status of the placenta, which is worth noting in GDM.

It is generated through multiple mechanisms at various intracellular sites. Due to its chemical stability it can reach distant sites of action. However, its hydrophilicity can hamper lipid membrane passage. We therefore studied the kinetics of HO diffusion through subcellular membranes employing the HO biosensor HyPer in insulin-producing RINm5F cells. Plasma- and ER-membrane-bound HyPer sensors facing the cytosolic compartment reacted twice as fast to HO compared to sensors expressed in peroxisomes and . Overexpression of the HO-inactivating enzyme catalase in the ER-lumen and in the peroxisomes retarded the reaction time of HyPer, both localised within the peroxisomes as well as at the cytosolic surface of the ER. The unsaturated fatty acid oleic acid did not affect the reaction of the peroxisomal HyPer sensor to HO, while the saturated fatty acid palmitic acid accelerated its reaction time to HO in this organelle. The results show that the plasma-, peroxisomal, and mitochondrial membrane of insulin-producing RINm5F cells are permeable for HO. Nonetheless, the organelle membranes retard HO diffusion due to a barrier function of the lipid membrane, as documented by retarded reaction times of the intraorganellar sensors. Accelerated decomposition of HO by catalase, expressed in the peroxisomes or the ER, further retarded the HyPer sensor reaction time. The results show that redox signalling and oxidative stress mediated toxicity are crucially dependent on physicochemical membrane properties and antioxidative defence mechanisms in health and disease.Copyright © 2019.

Due to the little exchange of seawater and to anoxic conditions, S. constricta is exposed to considerable amounts of sulfide during low tide, but exhibits strong sulfide tolerance. Mitochondrial sulfide oxidation is a particular defense strategy against sulfide toxicity of sulfide-tolerant organisms, for which sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQR) is the first key enzyme. In order to investigate the mechanism of sulfide tolerance in S. constricta, its SQR (designated as ScSQR), was cloned and characterized. The full-length cDNA of ScSQR was 3698 bp and encoded 443 amino acids. The deduced ScSQR protein contained conserved FAD-binding domains, two cysteine residues, two histidines, and one glutamic acid, which are the essential elements for the catalytic mechanism of SQR. Subcellular localization analysis by the TargetP 1.1 prediction and the Western blot confirmed that ScSQR was only located in the . The response of ScSQR in the gill and liver of S. constricta were investigated during sulfide exposure (50, 150, and 300 μM sulfide) for 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h by qRT-PCR. Moreover, the time-course expressions of ScSQR protein in the S. constricta gill were detected when exposed to 150 μM sulfide by Western blot. The expression level of ScSQR increased significantly and showed a time-dependent pattern. In addition, under sulfide stress, the expression level of the gill was higher than that of liver. Together, our results suggest that ScSQR may perform important roles in protecting cells from sulfide stress by participating in mitochondrial sulfide detoxification and providing high sulfide tolerance to S. constricta.Copyright © 2019.

Besides the well-characterized binding proteins contributing to the pro-apoptotic functions of Cc, many novel protein targets have been recently described. Among them, histone chaperones were identified as key partners of Cc following DNA breaks, indicating that Cc might modulate chromatin dynamics through competitive binding to histone chaperones. In this article, we review the ample set of recently discovered anti-apoptotic proteins-involved in DNA damage, transcription and energetic metabolism-reported to interact with Cc in the cytoplasm and even the nucleus upon DNA breaks.© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663667> Targeting Selenophene Modified BODIPY-Based Photosensitizers for Treatment of Hypoxic Cancer Cells.</a></h2><p>Two red absorbing, water soluble and  (MT) targeting selenophene substituted BODIPY based photosensitizers (PSs) were realized (BOD-Se, BOD-Se-I) and their potential as photodynamic therapy (PDT) agents were evaluated. BOD-Se-I showed higher 1O2 generation yield thanks to the enhanced heavy atom effect and this derivative was further tested detailly in cell culture studies under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. BOD-Se-I not only effectively functioned under hypoxic conditions but also showed highly selective photocytotoxicity towards cancer cells. The selectivity is believed to arise from difference in mitochondrial membrane potentials of healthy and cancerous cells. To best of our knowledge this marks the first example of a MT targeted BODIPY PS that functions under hypoxic conditions. Remarkably, thanks to the design strategy all these properties where realized by a compound that was synthesized in only five steps with 32% overall yield. Hence, this material holds great promise towards realization of next generation PDT drugs towards treatment of hypoxic solid tumors.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

A previous study focused on its antioxidant mechanism, whereas in this study, we investigated the cytotoxicity of a series of 28 analogues and the mechanism of apoptosis of the most cytotoxic compound against wild-type (HCT-116) and p53 mutant (HT-29) colorectal cancer cell lines. The series of analogues comprise of different families, namely hydrazone, oxadiazole, thiosemicarbazides and triazoles. In the initial cytotoxicity screening, N-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzylidene)-4-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyloxy) benzohydrazide, henceforth known as, P5H, was found to be most cytotoxic against human colorectal cancer cell lines (IC for HCT-116 = 11.79 μM and HT-29 = 18.52 μM). Additionally, P5H was found to have some degree of selectivity towards cancer cells compared to normal human colon cells (CCD-112 CoN). Subsequent investigation had brought insight on P5H ability to induce apoptosis in both HCT-116 and HT-29 cell lines. Cell cycle analysis showed both cell lines were arrested at the G2/M phase upon treatment. Our study concluded that P5H induced the death receptor, DR5 in HCT-116 and -mediated apoptosis pathway in HT-29. Therefore, P5H may be a promising candidate as a chemotherapy agent against colon cancer.

The CMT2K axonal form is associated with GDAP1 dominant mutations, which according to the affected domain cause a gradient of severity. Indeed, the p.C240Y mutation, located within GDAP1 glutathione S-transferase (GST) domain and associated to a mitochondrial complex I defect, is related to a faster disease progression, compared to other mutations, such as the p.R120W located outside the GST domain. Here, we analysed the pathophysiology of six CMT2K fibroblast cell lines, carrying either the p.C240Y or p.R120W mutations. We show that complex I deficiency leads to a redox potential alteration and a significant reduction of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) expression, a major deacetylase sensitive to the cellular redox state, and NRF1 the downstream target of SIRT1. In addition, we disclosed that the p.C240Y mutation is associated with a greater mitochondrial oxidative stress than the p.R120W mutation. Moreover, complex I activity is further restored in CMT2K mutant cell lines exposed to resveratrol. Together, these results suggest that the reduction of oxidative stress may constitute a promising therapeutic strategy for CMT2K.Copyright © 2018.

Based on this, we constructed a two-step precise targeting nanoplatform which can realize the drug release and drug action triggered by the microenvironment of lysosomes (endosomes) and , respectively. To begin with, the mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were modified with triphenylphosphonium (TPP) and loaded with 2,2'-azobis[2-(2-imidazolin-2-yl) propane] dihydrochloride (AIPH). Then, folic acid (FA) targeted pH-sensitive liposomes containing docetaxel (Lipo/DTX-FA) were prepared by thin-film dispersion method, and the core-shell AIPH/MSN-TPP@Lipo/DTX-FA nanoparticles were constructed by self-assembly during the hydration of the liposomes. When this nanoplatform entered into the tumor cells through FA receptor-mediated endocytosis, the pH-sensitive liposomes were destabilized in the lysosomes, resulting in the release of DTX and AIPH/MSN-TPP nanoparticles. After that, AIPH was delivered to  by AIPH/MSN-TPP, and the alkyl radicals produced by AIPH under the high temperature environment can cause oxidative damage to . Not only that, the DTX could enhance the anti-tumor effect of AIPH by downregulating the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein. The in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that this delivery system could induce apoptosis based on organelles' s own microenvironment, which provides a new approach for tumor therapy.Copyright © 2019.

Several cases of renal injury and serum electrolytes disturbances have been reported in IFO-treated patients. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are suspected of being involved in the mechanism of IFO nephrotoxicity. Carnosine is a dipeptide which its antioxidant and  protecting properties have been mentioned in different experimental models. The current study aimed to evaluate the nephroprotective properties of carnosine against IFO-induced renal injury.Rats were treated with IFO (50 mg/kg, i.p) alone or in combination with carnosine. Serum and urine biomarkers of renal injury in addition to kidney markers of oxidative stress were evaluated. Moreover, kidney  were isolated, and some mitochondrial indices were assessed.Elevated serum creatinine and BUN, hypokalemia, and hypophosphatemia, in addition, to an increase in urine glucose, protein, γ-GT, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), were evident in IFO-treated animals. IFO also caused an increase in kidney reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation (LPO). Renal GSH levels and antioxidant capacity were also depleted with IFO therapy. Mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity, GSH level, membrane potential, and ATP content were decreased while mitochondrial LPO and permeabilization were increased in IFO group. Carnosine (250 and 500 mg/kg, i.p) mitigated IFO-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial impairment in renal tissue.Our data suggest mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress as fundamental mechanisms of renal injury induced by IFO.

Pink1 mutations are the second most common cause of autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease (PD). In addition to characteristic motor impairments, PD patients also commonly exhibit cognitive impairments. As the hippocampus plays a prominent role in cognition, we tested if loss of Pink1 in mice influences learning and memory. While wild-type mice were able to perform a contextual discrimination task, age-matched Pink1 knockout (Pink1) mice showed an impaired ability to differentiate between two similar contexts. Similarly, Pink1 mice performed poorly in a delayed alternation task as compared to age-matched controls. Poor performance in these cognitive tasks was not the result of overt hippocampal pathology. However, a significant reduction in hippocampal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) protein levels was detected in the Pink1 mice. This decrease in hippocampal TH levels was also associated with reduced DOPA decarboxylase and dopamine D2 receptor levels, but not post-synaptic dopamine D1 receptor levels. These presynaptic changes appeared to be selective for dopaminergic fibers as hippocampal dopamine beta hydroxylase, choline acetyltransferase, and tryptophan hydroxylase levels were unchanged in Pink1 mice. Administration of the dopamine D1 receptor agonist SKF38393 to Pink1 mice was found to improve performance in the context discrimination task. Taken together, our results show that Pink1 loss may alter dopamine signaling in the hippocampus, which could be a contributing mechanism for the observed learning and memory impairments.Copyright © 2018.

T2D presents with hyperglycemia and insulin resistance resulting in increased risk for blindness, renal failure, nerve damage, and premature death. Skeletal muscle is a major site for insulin resistance and is responsible for up to 80% of glucose uptake during euglycemic hyperglycemic clamps. Glucose uptake in skeletal muscle is driven by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and for this reason mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in T2D. In this review we integrate mitochondrial function with physiologic function to present a broader understanding of mitochondrial functional status in T2D utilizing studies from both human and rodent models. Quantification of mitochondrial function is explained both in vitro and in vivo highlighting the use of proper controls and the complications imposed by obesity and sedentary lifestyle. This review suggests that skeletal muscle  are not necessarily dysfunctional but limited oxygen supply to working muscle creates this misperception. Finally, we propose changes in experimental design to address this question unequivocally. If mitochondrial function is not impaired it suggests that therapeutic interventions and drug development must move away from the organelle and toward the cardiovascular system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647288>Effect of chronic continuous normobaric hypoxia on functional state of cardiac  and tolerance of isolated rat heart to ischemia and reperfusion: role of µ and delta2 opioid receptors.</a></h2><p>Chronic continuous normobaric hypoxia (CNH) increases cardiac tolerance to ischemia/reperfusion injury in vivo and this effect is mediated via µ and delta2 opioid receptors (ORs) activation. CNH has also been shown to be cardioprotective in isolated rat heart. In this study, we hypothesize that this cardioprotective effect of CNH is mediated by activation of µ and delta2 ORs and preservation of mitochondrial function. Hearts from rats adapted to CNH (12 % oxygen) for 3 weeks were extracted, perfused in the Langendorff mode and subjected to 45 min of global ischemia and 30 min of reperfusion. Intervention groups were pretreated for 10 min with antagonists for different OR types: naloxone (300 nmol/l), the selective delta OR antagonist TIPP(psi) (30 nmol/l), the selective delta1 OR antagonist BNTX (1 nmol/l), the selective delta2 OR antagonist naltriben (1 nmol/l), the selective peptide delta OR antagonist CTAP (100 nmol/l) and the selective kappa OR antagonist nor-binaltorphimine (3 nmol/l). Creatine kinase activity in coronary effluent and cardiac contractile function were monitored to assess cardiac injury and functional impairment. Additionally, cardiac tissue was collected to measure ATP and to isolate  to measure respiration rate and calcium retention capacity. Adaptation to CNH decreased myocardial creatine kinase release during reperfusion and improved the postischemic recovery of contractile function. Additionally, CNH improved mitochondrial state 3 and uncoupled respiration rates, ADP/O, mitochondrial transmembrane potential and calcium retention capacity and myocardial ATP level during reperfusion compared to the normoxic group. These protective effects were completely abolished by naloxone, TIPP(psi), naltriben, CTAP but not BNTX or nor-binaltorphimine.

They are required for the generation of cellular energy, regulation of calcium homeostasis and controlling programmed cell death. Defective mitochondrial homeostasis is frequently reported in a broad range of neurological disorders. Many lines of evidence suggest that it plays an essential role in aging, and neurodegeneration. Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder and its aetiology is still largely unexplored. Overwhelming evidence indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in PD pathogenesis. Various genes involved in maintaining the mitochondrial homeostasis are also associated with the PD pathophysiology. Alterations in mitochondrial functions such as generation of reactive oxygen species, impaired mitophagy, altered mitochondrial dynamics, impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and Ca buffering, may precede the development of PD pathology. In addition, recent studies have also shown the involvement of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases including PD. In this context, -targeted therapies that can ameliorate the mitochondrial abnormalities may have great promise in the prevention and treatment of PD. This review aims to discuss the mitochondrial dysfunction associatedwithPD pathogenesis and various mitochondrial targeted therapies that can improve the mitochondrial function and deplete the severity of disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and  Research Society.

Owing to lethality of PPR mutants, functions of many PPR proteins remain obscure. Here, we report the function of PPR20 in intron splicing in  and its role in maize seed development. PPR20 is a P-type PPR protein targeted to . The ppr20 mutants display slow embryo and endosperm development. Null mutation of PPR20 severely reduces the cis-splicing of mitochondrial nad2 intron 3, resulting in reduction in the assembly and activity of mitochondrial complex I. The ppr20-35 allele with a Mu insertion in the N-terminal region shows a much weaker phenotype. Molecular analyses revealed that the mutant produces a truncated transcript, coding for PPR20ΔN120 lacking the N-terminal 120 amino acids. Subcellular localization revealed that PPR20ΔN120: GFP is able to target to  as well, suggesting the sequence diversity of the mitochondrial targeting peptides.

While most genes expressed "in the remaining" oligodendrocytes are downregulated in schizophrenia, only a few are upregulated. To the latter group belong prohibitin 2 and DISC 1, which were recently identified as -located mitophagy receptors. Their overexpression, together with greatly reduced numbers and densities of oligodendroglial  and the structurally "normal appearance of the remaining " in these cells as reported by Uranova's group (Uranova et al., 2001, 2004, 2018), point to enhanced mitophagy in oligodendrocytes in schizophrenia, which is possibly even cell protective by preventing apoptosis. Since massive loss of white matter oligodendrocytes is a characteristic feature of schizophrenia, we assume that increased mitophagy is a late event in the development and/or further progression of white matter pathologic changes. Moreover, altered oligodendroglial mitophagy might in part result from antipsychotic treatment. Further studies are clearly needed to substantiate our hypothesis on enhanced mitochondrial autophagy in schizophrenia, whereby the "drug-naïve state" and the possible influence of antipsychotic treatment could be elegantly simulated using animal models of the disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The prevention at high concentrations is evidenced by the significant inhibition of mitochondrial swelling induced by Ca and phosphate; in this condition, AGM both prevents the release of Apoptosis Inducing Factor (AIF) and enhances the release of other pro-apoptotic factors, such as cytochrome c (cyt c) and Smac/DIABLO. As these factors are released without MPT induction, the involvement of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) could be hypothesized. Cyclosporin A (CsA), a powerful inhibitor of MPT, enhanced the AGM-mediated inhibition of swelling, and surprisingly, prevented the release of cyt c and Smac/DIABLO. In the presence of Ca, AGM also activated the Bcl-2 family protein Bax, a key factor in inducing MOMP, which is inactivated by CsA. Together with the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), Bax forms channels in the outer membrane further supporting the involvement of MOMP in the release of pro-apoptotic factors. In view of the fact that VDAC was inactivated by ruthenium red, which in turn inhibited the release of cyt c, it can be hypothesized that, on the one hand, AGM inhibits MPT induction and, on the other, it selectively permeabilizes the outer membrane via MOMP induction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654396>PTEN inhibition attenuates endothelial cell apoptosis in coronary heart disease via modulating the AMPK-CREB-Mfn2-mitophagy signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Atherosclerosis (AS) is a major pathogenic factor in patients with cardiovascular diseases, and endothelial dysfunction (ED) plays a primary role in the occurrence and development of AS. In our study, we attempted to evaluate the role of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in endothelial cell apoptosis under oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) stimulation and identify the associated mechanisms. The results of our study demonstrated that ox-LDL induced human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) death via mitochondrial apoptosis, as evidenced by reduced mitochondrial potential, increased  permeability transition pore opening, cellular calcium overload, and caspase-9/-3 activation. In addition, ox-LDL also suppressed cellular energy production via downregulating the mitochondrial respiratory complex. Moreover, ox-LDL impaired HUVECs migration. Western blot analysis showed that PTEN expression was upregulated after exposure to ox-LDL and knockdown of PTEN could attenuate ox-LDL-mediated endothelial cell damage. Furthermore, we found that ox-LDL impaired mitophagy activity, whereas PTEN deletion could improve mitophagic flux and this effect relied on the activity of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-Mitofusin-2 (Mfn2) axis. When the AMPK-CREB-Mfn2 pathway was inhibited, PTEN deletion-associated HUVECs protection was significantly reduced, suggesting that the AMPK-CREB-Mfn2-mitophagy axis is required for PTEN deletion-mediated endothelial cell survival under ox-LDL. Taken together, our results indicate that ox-LDL-induced endothelial cell damage is associated with PTEN overexpression, and inhibition of PTEN could promote endothelial survival via activating the AMPK-CREB-Mfn2-mitophagy signaling pathway.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665639>Dysregulation of Mitochondrial Ca Uptake and Sarcolemma Repair Underlie Muscle Weakness and Wasting in Patients and Mice Lacking MICU1.</a></h2><p>Muscle function is regulated by Ca, which mediates excitation-contraction coupling, energy metabolism, adaptation to exercise, and sarcolemmal repair. Several of these actions rely on Ca delivery to the mitochondrial matrix via the mitochondrial Ca uniporter, the pore of which is formed by mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU). MCU's gatekeeping and cooperative activation are controlled by MICU1. Loss-of-protein mutation in MICU1 causes a neuromuscular disease. To determine the mechanisms underlying the muscle impairments, we used MICU1 patient cells and skeletal muscle-specific MICU1 knockout mice. Both these models show a lower threshold for MCU-mediated Ca uptake. Lack of MICU1 is associated with impaired mitochondrial Ca uptake during excitation-contraction, aerobic metabolism impairment, muscle weakness, fatigue, and myofiber damage during physical activity. MICU1 deficit compromises mitochondrial Ca uptake during sarcolemmal injury, which causes ineffective repair of the damaged myofibers. Thus, dysregulation of mitochondrial Ca uptake hampers myofiber contractile function, likely through energy metabolism and membrane repair.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The pathogenesis of atherosclerosis involves a number of risk factors and complex events including hypercholesterolemia, endothelial dysfunction, increased permeability to low density lipoproteins (LDL) and their sequestration on extracellular matrix in the intima of lesion-prone areas. These events promote LDL modifications, particularly by oxidation, which generates acute and chronic inflammatory responses implicated in atherogenesis and lesion progression. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) (which include both free radical and non-free radical oxygen intermediates), play a key-role at each step of atherogenesis, in endothelial dysfunction, LDL oxidation, and inflammatory events involved in the initiation and development of atherosclerosis lesions. Most advanced knowledge supporting the "oxidative theory of atherosclerosis" i.e. the nature and the cellular sources of ROS and antioxidant defences, as well as the mechanisms involved in the redox balance, is based on the use of genetically engineered animals, i.e. transgenic, genetically modified, or altered for systems producing or neutralizing ROS in the vessels. This review summarizes the results obtained from animals genetically manipulated for various sources of ROS or antioxidant defences in the vascular wall, and their relevance (advance or limitation), for understanding the place and role of ROS in atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2019.

Foodborne toxins are often overlooked as potential factors contributing to metabolic toxicity. Fusaric acid (FA), a neglected mycotoxin, is known to disrupt mitochondrial function. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying a metabolic switch in response to FA. This study investigated the effects of FA on energy homeostasis in cultured human liver (HepG2) cells. HepG2 cells poised to undergo oxidative and glycolytic metabolism were exposed to a range of FA concentrations (4, 63 and 250 µg/mL) for 6 hours. We determined mitochondrial toxicity, acetyl CoA levels and cell viability using luminometric, fluorometric and spectrophotometric methods. Expression of metabolic proteins (PDK1, PKM2, phosphorylated-PDH E1α and HIF-1α) and mRNAs (HIF-1α, PKM2, LDHa and PDK1) were determined using western blot and qPCR respectively. Our data connects a constitutive expression of HIF-1α in response to FA, to the inhibition of pyruvate decarboxylation through up-regulation of PDK-1 and phosphorylation of Pyruvate Dehydrogenase E1α subunit. Moreover, we highlight the potential of FA to induce a glucose "addiction" and phenotype reminiscent of the Warburg effect.

In advanced age cerebromicrovascular endothelial dysfunction impairs NVC responses, which contribute to age-related cognitive decline.

The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that -targeted overexpression of catalase also confers protection against age-related impairment of NVC responses. To achieve this goal, NVC responses were assessed in aged (24 months old) mCAT mice and compared with those in age-matched wild-type mice and young control mice by measuring CBF responses (laser speckle contrast imaging) evoked by contralateral whisker stimulation. We found that mitochondrial overexpression of catalase resulted in improved NVC in aged mice due to preserved NO-mediated (L-NAME inhibitable) component of the response. Thus, our present and previous findings demonstrate that interventions that boost mitochondrial antioxidative defenses confer significant cerebromicrovascular protective effects, which preserve NVC responses in aged mice.

The age-related declines in skeletal muscle regenerative capacity have been attributed to the changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM) composition. Therefore, mitochondrial deterioration in the muscle may be implicated in the sarcopenic process, and a possible link between ECM remodeling and mitochondrial dysfunction may be suggested. While exercise training improves elderly muscle function, the contradictory results obtained from different studies, the lack of a well-defined training program as well as age-related falls may raise questions regarding the overall benefits of this interventional strategy for sarcopenic elderly who have limited ability to perform physical exercise. Thus, it remains important to be able to offer less cumbersome but equally effective alternatives such as pharmacological approaches to help elderly patients. In this review, we discuss the involvement of  dysfunction as well as the ECM remodeling in sarcopenia and we suggest that the future of sarcopenia drug development may be targeting ECM/ pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and  Research Society.
