Silkworm midgut is the major organ for digestion and nutrient absorption, importantly it is also a  against foreign substances and chemical pesticides. The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanism of oxidative injury in silkworm midgut with  induction. The results showed that the transcription level of oxidative phosphorylation signaling pathway genes of midgut under  stress. Digital gene expression (DGE) analysis revealed that 24 electron transport chain (ETC)-related genes were upregulated. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction results indicated that the ETC the genes encoding NADH-CoQ1, Succinic-Q, cyt c reductase-S, cyt c oxidase-S, cytochrome c oxidase polypeptide IV, ATP synthase, and vacuolar H+ ATP synthase were all significantly up-regulated by 1.50-, 1.31-, 1.42-, 1.44-, 1.70-, 2.03- and 1.43-fold, respectively.  induction enhanced the activity of ETC complex in mitochondria, and induced the accumulation of ROS in midgut. These results indicated that trace  enhanced respiration in midgut, and the imbalance between the activity changes of ETC may led to reactive oxygen species accumulation. The ETC of mitochondria may be potential biomarkers of midgut toxicity in B. mori caused by  exposure.© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The objective of this study was to explore the effect of vitamin E on -induced oxidative stress in the intestinal tissues of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Forty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to a control group and three treatment groups: treatment group 1 (: 20 mg/kg·BW), treatment group 2 (: 180 mg/kg·BW), and treatment 3 (vitamin E + : 200 mg/kg·BW + 180 mg/kg·BW).  was given by gavage administration once a day for 28 days. The results showed that  significantly reduced jejunum villus height in rats (P < 0.05), and decreased the mRNA expression of junction protein genes of rats, including Occlidin and Claudin-4 (P < 0.05).  reduced GSH content and T-AOC level in the intestinal mucosa (P < 0.05). The mRNA expression levels of oxidative stress-related genes (Nrf2 and GPx2) were decreased. The mRNA expression of SOD was significantly increased. In addition,  increased the level of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in jejunum mucosa and significantly reduced the level of IL-8 in ileum mucosas, while significantly increased TNF-α secretion. The mRNA expression levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 were significantly decreased, and mRNA expression of TNF-α was significantly increased (P < 0.05).  also increased the DNA expression of total cecal bacteria and Escherichia coli, inhibited the DNA expression of Lactobacillus and destroyed the intestinal . Two hundred milligrams per kilogram BW vitamin E reduced the effect of  on intestinal structure, alleviated the oxidative stress in intestinal tissue, and decreased the level of TNF-α. The mRNA expressions of antioxidative stress genes (SOD and GPx2) were significantly increased. The DNA expression level of Lactobacillus was significantly increased. In conclusion, vitamin E helped reduce the toxicity of organophosphate pesticides, such as  on rat intestinal tissue.</p></html>
