Generally, two different ligand-decoration procedures are utilized; ligands are either conjugated with nanoparticle ingredients and incorporated during nanoparticle preparation, or they are attached to preformed nanoparticles by utilizing functionalized reactive surface groups (e.g., maleimide). Although the two procedures result in nanoparticles with very similar physicochemical properties, formulations obtained through the latter manufacturing process typically contain nonconjugated reactive surface groups. In the current study, we hypothesized that the different ligand-decoration procedures might affect the extent of interaction between nanoparticles and immune cells (especially phagocytes). In order to investigate our hypothesis, we decorated lipidic nanoparticles with a widely used cyclic --Asp (cRGD) peptide using the two different procedures. As proven from in vivo experiments in mice, the presence of nonconjugated surface moieties results in increased recognition by the immune system. This is important knowledge considering the emerging focus on understanding and optimizing ways to target and track immune cells and the development of nanomedicine-based strategies in the field of .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28792792>The Effect of RGD/NGR Peptide Modification of Melanoma Differentiation-Associated Gene-7/Interleukin-24 on Its Receptor Attachment, an In Silico Analysis.</a></h1><p>Melanoma differentiation-associated gene-7 (mda-7/interleukin [IL]-24), a unique tumor suppressor gene, induces selective apoptosis in tumor cells. Secreted IL-24 binds to heterodimeric receptor complexes of IL-20R1/IL-20R2, IL-22R1/IL-20R2, or sigma-1 receptor (Sig1R) that consequently enhances apoptosis. However, this mechanism is not well understood and most likely involves different pathways. Targeting of cytokine by tumor homing peptides (THPs) to the tumor cell surface molecule-like integrin shows to be beneficial in gene  approaches. In this study, the in silico targeting of RGD/NGR-modified IL-24 to tumor cells was conducted. In this regard, the sequences of six new synthetic IL-24s that have been modified by RGD (--Asp) or NGR (CRNGRGPDC) were aligned and their structures were modeled through homology modeling to evaluate their attachment potential to cognate receptor complexes such as IL-20R1/IL-20R2, IL-22R1/IL-20R2, or Sig1R. The results of homology modeling showed that modification of IL-24 with RGD motif in N-terminal and middle of this protein exhibited stronger interaction with cognate receptors. These results also demonstrated that modified IL-24 with RGD motif in the C-terminal has lost native activity. However, the interaction of THP-modified IL-24 with Sig1R would not be affected to that extent, interestingly. Conclusively, in silico analysis showed that modification of IL-24 with THPs needs a more detailed study as these modifications may disrupt native interaction with receptors and reduce apoptosis induction property. This structural analysis gives us a better understanding of mda-7/IL-24 interaction with cognate receptors and helps a more rational design for further cytokine modification.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31132380>Photothermal therapy mediated by phase-transformation nanoparticles facilitates delivery of anti-PD1 antibody and synergizes with antitumor  for melanoma.</a></h1><p>Melanoma remains one of the most challenging malignant tumor related deaths worldwide and alternative approaches to efficiently treat melanoma are eagerly needed. Anti-PD1 antibody (aPD1)  is the most significant and impactful therapy for melanoma by immune checkpoint inhibition and T cell stimulation to mediate tumor killing. But the clinical remission rate of aPD1  is limited in melanoma. Here we show a potent combination of aPD1 and photothermal therapy (PTT) by effective delivery of a multifunctional phase-transformation nanocarrier to melanoma tumor. We successfully synthesized multifunctional nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated with aPD1, iron oxide and perfluoropentane (PFP) in lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) shell modified with poly ethylene glycol (PEG) and ---Asp-Ser (GRGDS) peptides (GOP@aPD1). In vitro, GOP@aPD1 NPs were characterized for particle size and drug-loading efficiency. The NPs were also tested for photothermal property, optical droplet vaporization (ODV) capacity and the ability of aPD1 release profile. In vivo, GOP@aPD1 NPs were systemically administered to melanoma-bearing mice demonstrated no toxicity and accumulation at tumor site. When mediated with PTT, this synergistic treatment achieved enhanced antitumor efficacy, due to combination of the effective aPD1 release and increased CD8+ T cell infiltration in tumor site. In conclusion, GOP@aPD1 NPs combined with PTT could potentiate the efficacy of aPD1 not only by tumor-targeted delivery of aPD1 but also by activating the immune system in the tumor microenvironment, which is a highly effective approach to treat melanoma.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Nevertheless, the introduction of ACT into clinics requires overcoming not only medical but also technical challenges, such as the ex vivo expansion of large amounts of specific T-cells. Nanostructured surfaces represent a novel T-cell stimulation technique that enables us to fine-tune the density and orientation of activating molecules presented to the cells. In this work, we studied the influence of integrin-mediated cell-adhesion on T-cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation using nanostructured surfaces, which provide a well-defined system at the nanoscale compared with standard cultures. Specifically, we synthesized a polymeric polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel cross-linked with two fibronectin-derived peptides, cyclic --Asp (cRGD) and cyclic Leu-Asp-Val (cLDV), that are known to activate different integrins. Moreover, the hydrogels were decorated with a quasi-hexagonal array of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) functionalized with the activating antibody CD3 to initiate T-cell activation. Both cLDV and cRGD hydrogels showed higher T-cell activation (CD69 expression and IL-2 secretion) than nonfunctionalized PEG hydrogels. However, only the cRGD hydrogels clearly supported proliferation giving a higher proportion of cells with memory (CD4CD45RO) than naı̈ve (CD4CD45RA) phenotypes when interparticle distances smaller than 150 nm were used. Thus, T-cell proliferation can be enhanced by the activation of integrins through the RGD sequence.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28153100>Systemic Delivery of Tumor-Targeted Bax-Derived Membrane-Active Peptides for the Treatment of Melanoma Tumors in a Humanized SCID Mouse Model.</a></h1><p>Melanoma is a highly metastatic and deadly form of cancer. Invasive melanoma cells overexpress integrin αβ, which is a well-known target for --Asp-based (RGD) peptides. We developed a sophisticated method to synthetize milligram amounts of a targeted vector that allows the RGD-mediated targeting, internalization, and release of a mitochondria-disruptive peptide derived from the pro-apoptotic Bax protein. We found that 2.5 μM Bax[109-127] was sufficient to destabilize the mitochondria in ten different tumor cell lines, even in the presence of the anti-apoptotic Bcl2 protein, which is often involved in tumor resistance. This pore-forming peptide displayed antitumor activity when it was covalently linked by a disulfide bridge to the tetrameric RAFT-c[RGD]-platform and after intravenous injection in a human melanoma tumor model established in humanized immuno-competent mice. In addition to its direct toxic effect, treatment with this combination induced the release of the immuno-stimulating factor monocyte chimoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) in the blood and a decrease in the level of the pro-angiogenic factor FGF2. Our novel multifunctional, apoptosis-inducing agent could be further customized and assayed for potential use in tumor-targeted therapy.Copyright © 2017 The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy.

The separation of beneficial T cells from potentially harmful T cells can be achieved by using the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I-Streptamer isolation technology, which has proven its feasibility for the fast and pure isolation of T-cell populations with a single specificity. We have analyzed the feasibility of the simultaneous isolation of multiple antigen-specific T-cell populations in one procedure by combining different MHC I-Streptamers.First, the effect of combining different amounts of MHC I-Streptamers used in the isolation procedure on the isolation efficacy of target antigen-specific T cells and on the number of off-target co-isolated contaminating cells was assessed. The feasibility of this approach was demonstrated in large-scale validation procedures targeting both high and low frequent T-cell populations using the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-compliant CliniMACS Plus device.T-cell products targeting up to 24 different T-cell populations could be isolated in one, simultaneous MHC I-Streptamer procedure, by adjusting the amount of MHC I- Streptamers per target antigen-specific T-cell population. Concurrently, the co-isolation of potentially harmful contaminating T cells remained below our safety limit. This technology allows the reproducible isolation of high and low frequent T-cell populations. However, the expected therapeutic relevance of direct clinical application without in vitro expansion of these low frequent T-cell populations is questionable.This study provides a feasible, fast and safe method for the generation of highly personalized MHC I-Streptamer isolated T-cell products for adoptive .Copyright © 2018 International Society for Cellular Therapy.

Several viruses have undergone evaluation in clinical trials in the last decades, and the first agent is about to be approved to be used as a novel cancer therapy modality. In the current review, an overview is presented on recent (pre)clinical developments in the field of oncolytic viruses that have previously been or currently are being evaluated in clinical trials.

However, excessive activity and poor control over such engineered T cells cause significant safety challenges, such as cytokine release syndrome and organ toxicities. To enhance the specificity and controllable activity of CAR-T cells, we report a novel switchable dual-receptor CAR-engineered T (sdCAR-T) cell and a new switch molecule of FITC-HM-3 bifunctional molecule (FHBM) in this study.We designed a fusion molecule comprising FITC and HM-3. HM-3, an antitumor peptide including an --Asp sequence, can specifically target integrin αvβ3 that is presented on some tumor cells. Moreover, to improve the specificity of CAR-T cells, we also generated the sdCAR-T cell line against cognate tumor cells expressing human mesothelin (MSLN) and integrin αvβ3. Finally, the activity of sdCAR-T cell and FHBM is verified via in vitro and in vivo experiments.In the presence of FHBM, the designed sdCAR-T cells exerted high activity including activation and proliferation and had specific cytotoxicity in a time- and dose-dependent manner in vitro. Furthermore, using a combination of FHBM in nude mice, sdCAR-T cells significantly inhibited the growth of MSLN K562 cells and released lower levels of the cytokines (e.g., interleukin-2, interferon γ, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor α) relative to conventional CAR-T cells, obtaining specific, controllable, and enhanced cytotoxicity.Our data indicate that FHBM can accurately control timing and dose of injected CAR-T cells, and sdCAR-T cells exert significant antitumor activity while releasing lower levels of cytokines for the cognate tumor cells expressing both MSLN and integrin αvβ3. Therefore, combination therapies using sdCAR-T cells and the switch molecule FHBM have significant potential to treat malignancies.</p></html>
