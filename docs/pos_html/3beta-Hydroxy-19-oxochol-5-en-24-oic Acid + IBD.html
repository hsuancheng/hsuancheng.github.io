Herein lies the importance of nanotechnology having a wide range of applications in the field of nano-medicine, particularly in drug delivery systems. The exclusive properties particularly small size and high surface area (which can be modified as required), exhibited by these nanoparticlesrender these structures more suitable for the purpose of drug delivery. Various nanostructures, like liposomes, dendrimers, mesoporous silica nanoparticles, etc. have been designed for the said purpose. These nanostructures have several advantages over traditional administration of medicine. Apart from overcoming the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics limitations of many potential therapeutic molecules, they may also be useful for advanced drug delivery purposes like targeted drug delivery, controlled release, enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. In this review, we attempt to describe an up-to-date knowledge on various strategically devised nanostructures to overcome the problems related to oral drug administration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30765332>The Food Additive Maltodextrin Promotes Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Driven Mucus Depletion and Exacerbates Intestinal Inflammation.</a></h2><p>Food additives, such as emulsifiers, stabilizers, or bulking agents, are present in the Western diet and their consumption is increasing. However, little is known about their potential effects on intestinal homeostasis. In this study we examined the effect of some of these food additives on gut inflammation.Mice were given drinking water containing maltodextrin (MDX), propylene glycol, or animal gelatin, and then challenged with dextran sulfate sodium or indomethacin. In parallel, mice fed a MDX-enriched diet were given the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA). Transcriptomic analysis, real-time polymerase chain reaction, mucin-2 expression, phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase quantification, and H&E staining was performed on colonic tissues. Mucosa-associated microbiota composition was characterized by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. For the in vitro experiments, murine intestinal crypts and the human mucus-secreting HT29-methotrexate treated cell line were stimulated with MDX in the presence or absence of TUDCA or a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor.Diets enriched in MDX, but not propylene glycol or animal gelatin, exacerbated intestinal inflammation in both models. Analysis of the mechanisms underlying the detrimental effect of MDX showed up-regulation of inositol requiring protein 1β, a sensor of ER stress, in goblet cells, and a reduction of mucin-2 expression with no significant change in mucosa-associated microbiota. Stimulation of murine intestinal crypts and HT29-methotrexate treated cell line cells with MDX induced inositol requiring protein 1β via a p38 MAP kinase-dependent mechanism. Treatment of mice with TUDCA prevented mucin-2 depletion and attenuated colitis in MDX-fed mice.MDX increases ER stress in gut epithelial cells with the downstream effect of reducing mucus production and enhancing colitis susceptibility.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Obesity, dyslipidemia and metabolic disorders are of increasing public health concern worldwide, and novel therapeutics that target both the liver and the GI tract (gut-liver axis) are much needed. In addition to aiding fat digestion, bile  act as important signaling molecules that regulate lipid, glucose and energy metabolism via activating nuclear receptor, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), Takeda G protein receptor 5 (TGR5) and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2). Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is synthesized by two sphingosine kinase isoforms and is a potent signaling molecule that plays a critical role in various diseases such as fatty liver, inflammatory bowel disease () and colorectal cancer.

These vesicles are secreted from the variety of cells and are composed of a distinctive component such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic . EVs have different classified subgroups regarding their cell origin, in this context, exosomes are the most appealing particles in cell biology, especially clinical in recent years and are represented as novel therapeutic agents with numerous advantages alongside and/or over cell therapy. However, cell therapy had a hopeful outcome in gastrointestinal diseases which have minimal alternatives in their treatments. Inflammatory bowel disease (), liver fibrosis, gastrointestinal cancers are the examples that cell therapy and immunotherapy were applied in their treatment, therefore, the cell products like exosomes are the beneficial option in their treatment even cancers with promising results in animal models. In this review, we consider the main defined biogenesis, function, and component of secreted exosomes in different cells with a specific focus on the potential application of these exosomes as a cell-free therapeutic approach in gastrointestinal diseases like , gastric cancer, and colon cancer. Additionally, exosomes role as therapeutic reagents mainly mesenchymal stem cells and dendritic cell-derived exosomes in different studies have been under intense investigation and even they are being studied in different clinical trials. Therefore, all these striking functions described for secretome implies the importance of these biocarriers.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31556290>2--β-d-Glucopyranosyl-l-ascorbic , an Ascorbic  Derivative Isolated from the Fruits of  L., Modulates Gut Microbiota and Palliates Colitis in Dextran Sodium Sulfate-Induced Colitis in Mice.</a></h2><p>In this study, the effects of 2--β-d-glucopyranosyl-l-ascorbic  (AA-2βG), a natural ascorbic  derivative from the fruits of , on treating the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice were investigated.

About 75% of people with CD undergo surgery at least once in their lifetime to induce remission. However, as there is no known cure for the disease, patients usually experience a recurrence even after surgery. Different interventions are routinely used in maintaining postsurgical remission. There is currently no consensus on which treatment is the most effective.To assess the effects and harms of interventions for the maintenance of surgically induced remission in Crohn's disease and rank the treatments in order of effectiveness.We searched the Cochrane  Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase from inception to 15 January 2019. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles, abstracts from major gastroenterology meetings, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO ICTRP. There was no restriction on language, date, or publication status.We considered for inclusion randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different interventions used for maintaining surgically induced remission in people with CD who were in postsurgical remission. Participants had to have received maintenance treatment for at least three months. We excluded studies assessing enteral diet, diet manipulation, herbal medicine, and nutritional supplementation.Two review authors independently selected relevant studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or by arbitration of a third review author when necessary. We conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) using a Bayesian approach through Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. For the pairwise comparisons carried out in Review Manager 5, we calculated risk ratios (RR) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). For the NMA, we presented hazard ratios (HR) with corresponding 95% credible intervals (95% CrI) and reported ranking probabilities for each intervention. For the NMA, we focused on three main outcomes: clinical relapse, endoscopic relapse, and withdrawals due to adverse events. Data were insufficient to assess time to relapse and histologic relapse. Adverse events and serious adverse events were not sufficiently or objectively reported to permit an NMA. We used CINeMA (Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis) methods to evaluate our confidence in the findings within networks, and GRADE for entire networks.We included 35 RCTs (3249 participants) in the review. The average age of study participants ranged between 33.6 and 38.8 years. Risk of bias was high in 18 studies, low in four studies, and unclear in 13 studies. Of the 35 included RCTs, 26 studies (2581 participants; 9 interventions) were considered eligible for inclusion in the NMA. The interventions studied included 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA), adalimumab, antibiotics, budesonide, infliximab, probiotics, purine analogues, sulfasalazine, and a combination of sulfasalazine and prednisolone. This resulted in 30 direct contrasts, which informed 102 mixed-treatment contrasts.The evidence for the clinical relapse network (21 studies; 2245 participants) and endoscopic relapse (12 studies; 1128 participants) were of low certainty while the evidence for withdrawal due to adverse events (15 studies; 1498 participants) was of very low certainty. This assessment was due to high risk of bias in most of the studies, inconsistency, and imprecision across networks. We mainly judged individual contrasts as of low or very low certainty, except 5-ASA versus placebo, the evidence for which was judged as of moderate certainty.We ranked the treatments based on effectiveness and the certainty of the evidence. For clinical relapse, the five most highly ranked treatments were adalimumab, infliximab, budesonide, 5-ASA, and purine analogues. We found some evidence that adalimumab (HR 0.11, 95% Crl 0.02 to 0.33; low-certainty evidence) and 5-ASA may reduce the probability of clinical relapse compared to placebo (HR 0.69, 95% Crl 0.53 to 0.87; moderate-certainty evidence). However, budesonide may not be effective in preventing clinical relapse (HR 0.66, 95% CrI 0.27 to 1.34; low-certainty evidence). We are less confident about the effectiveness of infliximab (HR 0.36, 95% CrI 0.02 to 1.74; very low-certainty evidence) and purine analogues (HR 0.75, 95% CrI 0.55 to 1.00; low-certainty evidence). It was unclear whether the other interventions reduced the probability of a clinical relapse, as the certainty of the evidence was very low.Due to high risk of bias and limited data across the network, we are uncertain about the effectiveness of interventions for preventing endoscopic relapse. Whilst there might be some evidence of prevention of endoscopic relapse with adalimumab (HR 0.10, 95% CrI 0.01 to 0.32; low-certainty evidence), no other intervention studied appeared to be effective.Due to high risk of bias and limited data across the network, we are uncertain about the effectiveness of interventions for preventing withdrawal due to adverse events. Withdrawal due to adverse events appeared to be least likely with sulfasalazine (HR 1.96, 95% Crl 0.00 to 8.90; very low-certainty evidence) and most likely with antibiotics (HR 53.92, 95% Crl 0.43 to 259.80; very low-certainty evidence). When considering the network as a whole, two adverse events leading to study withdrawal (i.e. pancreatitis and leukopenia) occurred in more than 1% of participants treated with an intervention. Pancreatitis occurred in 2.8% (11/399) of purine analogue participants compared to 0.17% (2/1210) of all other groups studied. Leukopenia occurred in 2.5% (10/399) of purine analogue participants compared to 0.08% (1/1210) of all other groups studied.Due to low-certainty evidence in the networks, we are unable to draw conclusions on which treatment is most effective for preventing clinical relapse and endoscopic relapse. Evidence on the safety of the interventions was inconclusive, however cases of pancreatitis and leukopenia from purine analogues were evident in the studies. Larger trials are needed to further understand the effect of the interventions on endoscopic relapse.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804707>Nuclear Receptors in the Pathogenesis and Management of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Nuclear receptors (NRs) are ligand-dependent transcription factors that regulate the transcription of target genes. Previous epidemiological and genetic studies have documented the association of NRs with the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (). Although the mechanisms of action of NRs in  have not been fully established, accumulating evidence has demonstrated that NRs play complicated roles in regulating intestinal immunity, mucosal barriers, and intestinal flora. As one of the first-line medications for the treatment of , 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA) activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR) to attenuate colitis. The protective roles of rifaximin and rifampicin partly depend on promoting pregnane X receptor (PXR) expression. The aims of this review are to discuss the roles of several important NRs, such as PPAR, PXR, vitamin D receptor (VDR), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and RAR-related orphan receptor gammat (RORt), in the pathogenesis of  and management strategies based on targeting these receptors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30990833>Comparison of the systemic phospholipid profile in dogs diagnosed with idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease or food-responsive diarrhea before and after treatment.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease () and food-responsive diarrhea (FRD) are common chronic enteropathies in dogs, of which the exact pathogenesis has not been fully understood.

Studies on the phospholipid profile in dogs with  and FRD are still lacking.To investigate the systemic phospholipid profile of dogs with  or FRD and to evaluate possible differences in phospholipids before and after treatment.The phospholipids in whole blood and EDTA plasma of 32 dogs diagnosed with either  (n = 16) or FRD (n = 16) were analyzed by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) prior to and after initiation of treatment, which included an elimination diet enriched with PUFAs.A clear separation of the phospholipids between whole blood and plasma was demonstrated on principal component analysis plots. In addition to the type of specimen, treatment and disease severity were the most significant factors determining the variance of the phospholipid profile. An increase in lysolipids was observed after treatment. The phosphatidylcholine (PC) species changed from PC 38:4 before treatment to mainly lysophosphatidylcholine 18:0 after treatment. Furthermore, several differences in the abundance of individual phospholipids were identified between dogs with  and dogs with FRD and between treatment statuses using random forest analysis.Significant variances were identified in the phospholipid profiles of dogs with  and FRD. These were particularly determined by type of specimen used, disease severity and treatment status. After treatment, a shift of phospholipid species towards lysophosphatidylcholine 18:0 was observed.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of 350 extracts (175 water extracts and 175 ethanol extracts) from 71 single plants, 97 mixtures of two plants, and seven formulations based on traditional medicine, to find herbal formulations to treat inflammatory bowel disease (). In the in vitro screening, nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and interleukin (IL)-6 levels were determined in LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells and the TNF-α induced monocyte-epithelial cell adhesion assay was used for the evaluation of the anti-inflammatory activity of the compounds.

KM1608, composed of   and Aucklandia lappa, was prepared based on the screening experiments. The oral administration of KM1608 significantly attenuated the severity of colitis symptoms, such as weight loss, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding, in TNBS-induced colitis. In addition, inflammatory mediators, such as myeloperoxidase, TNF-α, and IL-6 levels decreased in the lysate of colon tissues treated with KM1608.

Recent studies have thus sought to identify a dietary component that can inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-κB) signaling to ameliorate . We now assessed if the lactic  bacteria (LAB) from kimchi, suppresses the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in peritoneal macrophages induced by LPS. Leuconostoc lactis EJ-1, an isolate from LAB, reduced the expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β in peritoneal macrophages induced by LPS. We further tested whether EJ-1 alleviates colitis induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS) in mice. TNBS significantly increased myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression, macroscopic colitis scores, and colon shortening. Oral administration of L. lactis EJ-1 resulted in an increase in TNBS-induced loss in body weight, colon shortening, MPO activity, and nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-κB) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression; it also led to a marked reduction in cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. L. lactis EJ-1 also inhibited the TNBS-induced expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6; however, it induced the expression of IL-10. M2 macrophage markers arginase I, IL-10 and CD206 were elevated by EJ-1. Collectively, these results suggest that EJ-1 inhibits the NF-κB signaling and polarizes M1 to M2- macrophage transition, which help in ameliorating colitis. This article is protected by copyright.

Colitis was reactivated in some mice by re-treating at 28 days with TNBS and assessing 2 days later (d30). Epithelial responsiveness to secretagogues, microbiota composition, colonic infiltration, and immune activation was compared between all groups.At day 28, the distal colon had healed, mucosa was restored, and innate immune response had subsided, but colonic transepithelial transport (P = 0.048), regulatory T-cell (TREG) infiltration (P = 0.014), adherent microbiota composition (P = 0.0081), and responsiveness of stimulated innate immune bone marrow cells (P < 0.0001 for IL-1β) differed relative to health. Two days after subsequent instillation of TNBS (d30 mice), the effects on inflammatory damage (P < 0.0001), paracellular permeability (P < 0.0001), and innate immune infiltration (P < 0.0001 for Ly6C+ Ly6G- macrophages) were reduced relative to d2 colitis. However, TREG infiltration was increased (P < 0.0001), and the responsiveness of stimulated T cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes shifted from pro-inflammatory at d2 to immune-suppressive at d30 (P < 0.0001 for IL-10). These effects were observed despite similar colonic microbiota composition and degradation of the mucosal layer between d2 and d30.Collectively, these results indicate that acute colitis chronically alters epithelial barrier function and both innate and adaptive immune responses. These effects reduce the consequences of a subsequent colitis event, warranting longitudinal studies in human  subjects.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press.

In the present study, we found that increased expression of E3 ligase FBXW7 in the inflamed intestine was significantly correlated to  severity in both human diseases and mice model. Myeloid-Fbxw7 deﬁciency protected mice from dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) and 2,6,4-trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS) induced colitis. Fbxw7 deficiency resulted in decreased production of chemokines CCL2 and CCL7 by colonic CX3CR1hi resident macrophages and reduced accumulation of CX3CR1int pro-inﬂammatory MPh in colitis colon tissue. Mice received AAV-shFbxw7 administration showed significantly improved survival rate and alleviated colitis. Mechanisms screening demonstrated that FBXW7 suppresses H3K27me3 modiﬁcation and promotes Ccl2 and Ccl7 expression via degradation of histone-lysine N-methyltransferase EZH2 in macrophages. Taken together, our results indicate that FBXW7 degrades EZH2 and increases Ccl2/Ccl7 in CX3CR1hi macrophages, which promotes the recruiting CX3CR1int pro-inﬂammatory MPh into local colon tissues with colitis.

Prediction of kinship from RNA-seq data would be useful for confirming the expected relationships in family based studies and for highlighting samples from related individuals in case-control or population based studies. Currently, reconstruction of pedigrees is largely based on SNPs or microsatellites, obtained from genotyping arrays, whole genome sequencing and whole exome sequencing. Potential problems with using RNA-seq data for kinship detection are the low proportion of the genome that it covers, the highly skewed coverage of exons of different genes depending on expression level and allele-specific expression. In this study we assess the use of RNA-seq data to detect kinship between individuals, through pairwise identity by descent () estimates. First, we obtained high quality SNPs after successive filters to minimize the effects due to allelic imbalance as well as errors in sequencing, mapping and genotyping. Then, we used these SNPs to calculate pairwise  estimates. By analysing both real and simulated RNA-seq data we show that it is possible to identify up to second degree relationships using RNA-seq data of even low to moderate sequencing depth.© The Author(s) 2019.

Accumulating evidence highlights the meaningful impact of estrogen receptors in physiology and pathophysiology of the colon. However, the significance of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) on Crohn's disease (CD), one of the inflammatory bowel disease () types, is still elusive. Our study revealed GPER overexpression at the mRNA and protein levels in patients with CD. To evaluate the effects of GPER activation/inhibition on colitis development, a murine 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS)-induced model of CD was used. We showed that activation of GPER reduces mortality, improves macroscopic and microscopic scores and lowers C-reactive protein (CRP) level. The impact of estrogen signaling on the suppression of the intestinal inflammation was proved by immunohistochemistry. It was demonstrated that GPER activation is accompanied by modulation of extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway and expression level of genes involved in signal transmission and immune response as well as the expression of some microRNAs (miR-145, miR-148-5p and miR-592).

Topical tacrolimus is effective and safe in patients with refractory UP. However, it is not clear how tacrolimus suppositories fit into in the treatment algorithm of UP.We performed a randomized controlled, double-blind study at 8 hospitals in The Netherlands and Belgium from 2014 through 2017. Eighty-five patients with refractory UP (65% women) were randomly assigned to groups given once daily tacrolimus suppositories (2mg, n=43) or beclomethasone (3mg, n=42) for 4 weeks. The primary outcome was clinical response (decrease in Mayo score of 3 or more). Secondary outcomes included clinical remission, endoscopic response and remission, adverse events and quality of life. Outcomes were compared using Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney U test.Proportions of patients with clinical responses were 63% in the tacrolimus group and 59% in the beclomethasone group (P=.812); proportions of patients in clinical remission were 46% and 38%, respectively (P=.638). Proportions of patients with an endoscopic response were 68% and 60% in the tacrolimus group and in the beclomethasone group (P=.636); proportions in endoscopic remission rates were 30% and 13%, respectively (P=.092) Median increases in the inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire score were 18.0 in the tacrolimus group and 20.5 in the beclomethasone group (P=.395). Adverse event rates did not differ significantly between groups.In a 4-week randomized controlled trial, tacrolimus and beclomethasone suppositories induce comparable clinical and endoscopic responses in patients with UP refractory to 5-ASA. There were no significant differences in adverse events rates. Tacrolimus and beclomethasone suppositories are therefore each safe and effective treatment options for 5-ASA refractory disease.

However, side effects from cervical vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) are often reported by patients. Here we hypothesized that stimulating the vagus nerve closer to the end organ will have fewer off-target effects and will effectively reduce intestinal inflammation. Specifically, we aimed to: (i) compare off-target effects during abdominal and cervical VNS; (ii) verify that VNS levels were suprathreshold; and (iii) determine whether abdominal VNS reduces chemically-induced intestinal inflammation in rats. An electrode array was developed in-house to stimulate and record vagal neural responses. In a non-recovery experiment, stimulation-induced off-target effects were measured by implanting the cervical and abdominal vagus nerves of anaesthetized rats ( = 5) and recording changes to heart rate, respiration and blood pressure during stimulation (10 Hz; symmetric biphasic current pulse; 320 nC per phase). In a chronic experiment, the efficacy of VNS treatment was assessed by implanting an electrode array onto the abdominal vagus nerve and recording  electrically-evoked neural responses during the implantation period. After 14 days, the intestine was inflamed with TNBS (2.5% 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic ) and rats received therapeutic VNS ( = 7; 10 Hz; 320 nC per phase; 3 h/day) or no stimulation ( = 8) for 4.5 days. Stool quality, plasma C-reactive protein and histology of the inflamed intestine were assessed. Data show that abdominal VNS had no effect (two-way RM-ANOVA:  ≥ 0.05) on cardiac, respiratory and blood pressure parameters. However, during cervical VNS heart rate decreased by 31 ± 9 beats/minute ( ≥ 0.05), respiration was inhibited and blood pressure decreased. Data addressing efficacy of VNS treatment show that electrically-evoked neural response thresholds remained stable (one-way RM ANOVA:  ≥ 0.05) and therapeutic stimulation remained above threshold. Chronically stimulated rats, compared to unstimulated rats, had improved stool quality (two-way RM ANOVA:  < 0.0001), no blood in feces ( < 0.0001), reduced plasma C-reactive protein (two-way RM ANOVA:  < 0.05) and a reduction in resident inflammatory cell populations within the intestine (Kruskal-Wallis:  < 0.05). In conclusion, abdominal VNS did not evoke off-target effects, is an effective treatment of TNBS-induced inflammation, and may be an effective treatment of  in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30654310>Extracellular vesicles containing miR-146a attenuate experimental colitis by targeting TRAF6 and IRAK1.</a></h2><p>Accumulating evidence indicates that microRNA-146a (miR-146a), a well-known anti-inflammatory miRNA, acts as a negative feedback regulator of the innate immune response, but its role in modulation of inflammatory bowel disease () remains unclear and the issue related to the stability of exogenous miR-146a in blood is up in the air. In this study, extracellular vesicles (EVs) from cultured medium of bone-marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) transfected with recombinant lentiviruses can serve as a stable delivery system and overexpress miR-146a, which significantly inhibited TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) expression in TNBS-induced colitis of rats. Moreover, the increased phosphorylation levels of NF-κB p65 and IκBα were down-regulated by the administration of EVs containing miR-146a. Coupled with the associated influence of over-expressed miR-146a on phosphorylated proteins above, the production of inflammation factors such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Interleukin-1β is apparently suppressed by this non-coding RNA. Collectively, these data elucidated that EVs containing miR-146a ameliorates experimental colitis caused 2,4,6‑trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS) by targeting TRAF6 and IRAK1.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

There is emerging evidence that the gut flora plays a major role in the pathogenesis of certain diseases. We aimed to analyze the evolution of gastrointestinal microbiome research and evaluate publications qualitatively and quantitatively.We obtained a record of 2891 manuscripts published between 1998 and 2018 from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) of Thomson Reuters; this record was obtained on June 23, 2018. The WoSCC is the most frequently used source of scientific information. We used the term "Gastrointestinal Microbiomes" and all of its hyponyms to retrieve the record, and restricted the subjects to gastroenterology and hepatology. We then derived a clustered network from 70,169 references that were cited by the 2891 manuscripts, and identified 676 top co-cited articles. Next, we used the bibliometric method, CiteSpace V, and VOSviewer 1.6.8 to identify top authors, journals, institutions, countries, keywords, co-cited articles, and trends.We identified that the number of publications on gastrointestinal microbiome is increasing over time. 112 journals published articles on gastrointestinal microbiome. The United States of America was the leading country for publications, and the leading institution was the University of North Carolina. Co-cited reference analysis revealed the top landmark articles in the field. Gut microbiota, inflammatory bowel disease (), probiotics, irritable bowel disease, and obesity are some of the high frequency keywords in co-occurrence cluster analysis and co-cited reference cluster analysis; indicating gut microbiota and related digestive diseases remain the hotspots in gut microbiome research. Burst detection analysis of top keywords showed that bile , obesity, and Akkermansia muciniphila were the new research foci.This study revealed that our understanding of the link between gastrointestinal microbiome and associated diseases has evolved dramatically over time. The emerging new therapeutic targets in gut microbiota would be the foci of future research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31540027>Profiling of Amino  in Urine Samples of Patients Suffering from Inflammatory Bowel Disease by Capillary Electrophoresis-Mass Spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Urine represents a convenient biofluid for metabolomic studies due to its noninvasive collection and richness in metabolites. Here, amino  are valuable biomarkers for their ability to reflect imbalances of different biochemical pathways. An impact of amino  on pathology, prognosis and therapy of various diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (), is therefore the subject of current clinical research. This work is aimed to develop a capillary electrophoresis-tandem mass spectrometry (CE-MS/MS) method for the quantification of the 20 proteinogenic amino  in human urine samples obtained from patients suffering from  and treated with thiopurines. The optimized CE-MS/MS method, with minimum sample preparation (just "dilute and shoot"), exhibited excellent linearity for all the analytes (coefficients of determination were higher than 0.99), with inter-day and intra-day precision yielding relative standard deviations in the range of 0.91-15.12% and with accuracy yielding relative errors in the range of 85.47-112.46%. Total analysis time, an important parameter for the sample throughput demanded in routine practice, was shorter in ca. 17% when compared to established CE-MS methods. Favorable performance of the proposed CE-MS/MS method was also confirmed by the comparison with corresponding ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) method. Consistent data for the investigated amino  metabolome were obtained using both methods. For the first time, the amino  profiling by CE-MS approach was applied on the clinical  samples. Here, significant differences observed in the concentration levels of some amino  between  patients undergoing thiopurine treatment and healthy volunteers could result from the simultaneous action of the disease and the corresponding therapy. These findings indicate that amino  analysis could be a valuable tool for the study of mechanism of the  treatment by thiopurines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30537794>Immunotherapeutic Effects of β-D Mannuronic  on IL-4, GATA3, IL-17 and RORC Gene Expression in the PBMC of Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases () are chronic relapsing immune-mediated disorders that result from an aberrant immunological response.  comprises of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).

The increasing number of hospitalisation coupled with the high economic burden faced by  patients, calls for more concerted research efforts, to design a potent and credible treatment option for these strata of patients. This research was designed to test the efficacy and potency of β-D Mannuronic  (M2000) in the treatment of . Ten ml of blood was aseptically collected from 24  patients and 24 normal controls.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which release immunomodulatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced gene/protein 6 (TSG-6) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), have been suggested as an alternative therapeutic option for  treatment in veterinary medicine. Furthermore, although it is known that MSCs pre-treated with pro-inflammatory cytokines show enhanced anti-inflammatory properties via the secretion of soluble factors, the underlying mechanisms of  remain unclear. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the therapeutic effects and corresponding mechanisms of canine adipose tissue-derived (cAT)-MSCs stimulated with TNF-α in mouse models of . Mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)- or dinitrobenzene sulfonic  (DNBS)-induced colitis were injected intraperitoneally with cAT-MSCs pre-treated with TNF-α. Colitis severity was assessed and colon tissues were collected for histopathological, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and flow cytometry analysis. cAT-MSCs stimulated with TNF-α secreted higher concentrations of immunomodulatory factors such as TSG-6 and PGE2, which play a key role in inducing phenotypic alterations in macrophages. Consequently, TNF-α-pre-treated cAT-MSCs further regulated colonic inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-10, and ameliorated DSS- or DNBS-induced colitis in mice. Additionally, we demonstrated that M1 macrophages (F4/80/iNOS cells) were decreased in colon tissues from mice treated with TNF-α-pre-treated cAT-MSCs, whereas M2 macrophages (F4/80/CD206 cells) were increased.

It has caused heavy economic losses in the commercial poultry industry for many years in worldwide. Attenuated live vaccine has widely used in poultry showing some promising signs against IBDV infection. But it has defects such as generating enhanced virulence and immunosuppression prohibits. Therefore, the development of mucosal vaccines using the food-grade lactic  bacterium is necessary. Here, we construct a recombinant Lactococcus co-expressing the major IBDV antigens VP2 and RCK protein of Salmonella enterica to prevent .The recombinant fusion protein VP2-RCK was expressed in a soluble and stable form in the cytoplasm of the recombinant Lactococcus lactis. Animal experiments showed that: (1) the survival rates of the injected immunization inactivated recombinant LAB group and oral immunization live recombinant LAB group were 100% and 80%, respectively; (2) ELISA titers of all serum samples from all experimental groups were negative, but high amounts of specific neutralizing antibodies were detected (1:2 to 1:2); and (3) the bursas of the injected immunization inactivated recombinant LAB group did not suffer damage, as confirmed by clinical observation and bursal histopathological examination. Our results indicate that r-L. lactis-OptiVP2-RCK induces a specific neutralizing-antibody-mediated immune response that confers full protection against very-virulent IBDV (vvIBDV) challenge.Lactococcus lactis NZ3900 strain and its matching plasmid pNZ8149 could express the recombinant fusion protein VP2-RCK in a soluble form in the cytoplasm. The protective efficacy of r-L. lactis-OptiVP2-RCK (100%) was better than r-L. lactis-OptiVP2 (0%) which prove RCK protein played its unique role. The neutralizing antibodies titers against infectious bursal disease virus via one-time vaccination with inactivated r-L. lactis-OptiVP2-RCK could reach 1:2 to 1:2, but ELISA titers of all serum samples were negative. For this phenomenon, perhaps because of the change of delivery pathway or the spatial structure of fusion protein.

Many patients even avoid certain foods that aggravate their symptoms. Although interest in nutritional interventions is rising among physicians, the current application of nutritional interventions in the  population is limited due to the lack of scientific evidence from clinical trials. Several studies, however, have identified associations between diet, gut microbiota, intestinal epithelial integrity, and mucosal immune responses. In patients consuming predominantly a Western diet high in n-6 poly-unsaturated fatty  (PUFAs), sugars, and meat, and low in fruits and vegetables, an impaired gut epithelial barrier and disturbances in the intestinal microbiota have been observed, resulting in a chronic mucosal inflammation.

An increased risk of malignancies, mainly colorectal cancer (CRC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), has been reported in PSC- patients. Our aim was to determine the clinical characteristics and management of PSC in  patients, and the factors associated with malignancies.PSC- patients were identified from the Spanish ENEIDA registry of GETECCU. Additional data were collected using AEG-REDCap electronic data capture tool.Two hundred seventy-seven PSC- patients were included, with an incidence rate of 61 PSC cases per 100,000  patient-years, 69.7% men, 67.5% ulcerative colitis, mean age at PSC diagnosis 40±16 years. Most patients (85.2%) were treated with ursodeoxycholic . Liver transplantation was required in 35 patients (12.6%) after 79 months (IQR 50-139). It was more common in intra- and extrahepatic PSC compared with small-duct PSC (16.3% vs. 3.3%; OR 5.7: 95%CI=1.7-19.3). The incidence rate of CRC since PSC diagnosis was 3.3 cases per 1,000 patient-years (95%CI=1.9-5.6). Having symptoms of PSC at PSC diagnosis was the only factor related with increased risk of CRC after  diagnosis (HR=3.3: 95%CI=1.1-9.9).

All adult patients from 27 Finnish gastroenterology centres with a diagnosis of Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) who had at least one vedolizumab infusion since it's availability in Finland were included in the study. Data were collected from medical charts at baseline (vedolizumab treatment initiation), week 14, and month 6. The majority of patients who used corticosteroids at the baseline and persisted on vedolizumab treatment for 6 months were taken off corticosteroid treatment by the 6-month time point (CD, 54.5%; UC, 69.8%). Modest corticosteroid dose reductions were observed among treatment persistent CD patients from the baseline until month 6. Corticosteroid users had less vedolizumab discontinuations due to primary ineffectiveness and more discontinuations due to adverse events than patients not using corticosteroids. Vedolizumab may have a corticosteroid sparing effect in real-world clinical practice.

Mannich curcuminoids, C142 or C150 synthetized in our laboratory, have been tested for anti-inflammatory activity in a rat model of TNBS (2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulphonic ) induced colitis. Treatment with C142 or C150 reduced leukocyte infiltration to the submucosa and muscular propria of the inflamed gut. C142 or C150 rescued the loss of body weight and C150 decreased the weight of standard colon preparations proportional with 20% less tissue oedema. Both C142 and C150 curcumin analogues caused 25% decrease in the severity of colonic inflammation and haemorrhagic lesion size. Colonic MPO (myeloperoxidase) enzyme activity as an indicator of intense neutrophil infiltration was 50% decreased either by C142 or C150 Mannich curcuminoids. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) co-treatment with Mannich curcuminoids inhibited NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa B) activity on a concentration-dependent manner in an NF-κB-driven luciferase expressing reporter cell line.

As mast cell mediators are known to increase the permeability of epithelial tight junctions, we hypothesized that antigen responses in sensitized animals might be enhanced under inflammatory conditions. This would contribute to a vicious circle by further enhancing the entry of luminal antigens into the colonic wall and thereby continuing the inadequate immune response during . Therefore, one group of rats was sensitized against ovalbumin. In a second group of animals additionally a colitis was induced by rectal administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS) dissolved in ethanol. Specimens from distal colon and jejunum (as intestinal segment located distantly from the inflamed area) were mounted in Ussing chambers to measure tissue conductance, short-circuit current (I) induced by antigen exposure and paracellular permeability (fluorescein flux). This was paralleled by determination of mast cell markers and tight junction proteins with immunofluorescence and qPCR. In contrast to the initial hypothesis, antigen-induced I was not upregulated, but tended to be downregulated in the tissues from the colitis animals, both in colon and in jejunum. Only in the jejunum mast cell degranulation evoked an increase in fluorescein flux. Mast cell density was not altered significantly in the colon of the colitis animals. In the jejunum, sensitization induced a strong increase in mast cell density, which was unaffected by additional induction of colitis. Expression of sealing tight junction components claudin-3 and -4 were increased on the protein level in the sensitized animals in comparison to non-sensitized animals. Additional induction of colitis evoked a downregulation of claudin-3 in both intestinal segments and an upregulation of claudin-4 in the jejunum. Consequently, these data indicate segment differences in mast cell - epithelium interaction, but no enhancement of ion secretion in the TNBS/ethanol model of acute colitis after prior sensitization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30562421>Disease course of inflammatory bowel disease unclassified in a European population-based inception cohort: An Epi- study.</a></h2><p>A definitive diagnosis of Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) is not always possible, and a proportion of patients will be diagnosed as inflammatory bowel disease unclassified (IBDU).

These processes are critically involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory-based disorders of the gut, like inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Accordingly, our aim was to investigate the role of the EphB/ephrin-B system in intestinal inflammation by assessing the local and systemic effects produced by its pharmacological manipulation in 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS)- (Th1-dependent model) and dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)- (innate response model) induced colitis in mice. To this purpose, we administered chimeric Fc-conjugated proteins, allegedly able to uni-directionally activate either forward (ephrin-B1-Fc) or reverse (EphB1-Fc) signaling, and the soluble monomeric EphB4 extracellular domain protein, that, simultaneously interfering with both signaling pathways, acts as EphB/ephrin-B antagonist.The blockade of the EphB/ephrin-B forward signaling by EphB4 and EphB1-Fc was ineffective against DSS-induced colitis while it evoked remarkable beneficial effects against TNBS colitis: it counteracted all the evaluated inflammatory responses and the changes elicited on splenic T lymphocytes subpopulations, without preventing the appearance of a splice variant of ephrin-B2 gene elicited by the haptenating agent in the colon. Interestingly, EphB4, preferentially displacing EphB4/ephrin-B2 interaction over EphB1/ephrin-B1 binding, was able to promote Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFα) release by splenic mononuclear cells . On the whole, the collected results point to a potential role of the EphB/ephrin-B system as a pharmacological target in intestinal inflammatory disorders and suggest that the therapeutic efficacy of its blockade seemingly works through the modulation of immune responses, independent of the changes at the transcriptional and translational level of EphB4 and ephrin-B2 genes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30986886>[Primary bile  diarrhea in a community gastroenterology practice].</a></h2><p>When first described in 1976, primary bile  diarrhea (BAD Type 1) was regarded as a very rare cause of chronic diarrhea.

There is no permanent cure from  except constant medication or surgery to keep the disease in remission. In the present study, the effect of menthol, a major ingredient of peppermint has been investigated in acetic -induced colitis model in Wistar rats. Menthol (50 mg/kg/day) was orally administered for either 3 days before or 30 min after  induction for 7 days. The changes in body weight, macroscopic and microscopic analysis of the colon of rats of different experimental groups were observed on day 0, 2, 4 and 7. Acetic  caused a significant reduction in mean body weight and induced macroscopic and microscopic ulceration along with a significant decline of glutathione (GSH) levels, an antioxidant substrate concomitant to increased malondialdehyde (MDA) level, a marker of lipid peroxidation and raised myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, itself a marker for neutrophil activation. Acetic  also induced the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, acetic  also raised the levels of calprotectin, a protein released by neutrophils under inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. Treatment with menthol significantly improved -induced reduction in mean body weight and mean macroscopic and microscopic ulcer scores and reduced activities of MPO and levels of MDA with concomitant increase in GSH level. Additionally, menthol treatment significantly reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1, interleukin-23 and tumor necrosis factor-α with no significant change in interleukin-6 levels.

However, related changes in glomerular structural have rarely been investigated. This study was aimed at clarifying the changes in collagens and glomerular filtration barrier (GFB)-related proteins of glomeruli in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model. Acute colitis was induced by administering 3.5% DSS in Slc:ICR strain mice for eight days. Histological changes to glomeruli were examined by periodic -Schiff (PAS) and Masson's trichrome staining. Expressions of glomerular collagens and GFB-related proteins were analyzed by immunofluorescent staining and Western blot analysis. DSS-colitis mice showed an elevated disease activity index (DAI), colon shortening, massive cellular infiltration and colon damage, confirming that DSS-colitis mice can be used as an  animal model. DSS-colitis mice showed increased glycoprotein and collagen deposition in glomeruli. Interestingly, we observed significant changes in glomerular collagens, including a decrease in type IV collagen, and an increment in type I and type V collagens. Moreover, declined GFB-related proteins expressions were detected, including synaptopodin, podocalyxin, nephrin and VE-cadherin. These results suggest that renal disease in DSS-colitis mice might be associated with changes in glomerular collagens and GFB-related proteins. These findings are important for further elucidation of the clinical pathological mechanisms underlying -associated renal disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30503585>Sulphur dioxide ameliorates colitis related pathophysiology and inflammation.</a></h2><p>Colitis is an inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. Inflammation, oxidative stress and cell death constitute the backbone of colitis. Most of the drugs prescribed for inflammatory bowel disease () have various side effects. In this scenario, we would like to determine the therapeutic role sulphur dioxide, a gaso-transmitter produced through the metabolism of cysteine in colitis. Colitis was induced through intrarectal administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS) in male Wistar rats. Rats were administered with 0.9% saline containing NaSO and NaHSO (3:1 ratio; i.e., 0.54 mmol/kg and 0.18 mmol/kg body weight) orally 1 h after colitis induction followed by the administration of the same solution after each 12 h for 72 h. TNBS administration resulted in increased oxidative stress, NF-ĸ B and inflammasome activation, ER stress and autophagy. Moreover, TNBS administration also resulted in activation of p53 and apoptosis. SO reversed all these alterations and ameliorated colitis in rats. Administration of an inhibitor of endogenous SO production along with TNBS exacerbated colitis. Results suggest that down-regulation of SO / glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase pathway is involved in . The protective role of SO in colitis is attributed to its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant nature. Down-regulation of SO/glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase pathway is involved in . Since SO is not toxic at low concentration and endogenously produced, it may be used with prescribed drugs for synergistic effect after intensive research. Our result demonstrated the therapeutic role of SO in colitis for the first time.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we used transmission (TEM) and osmium-maceration scanning (SEM) electron microscopy to evaluate the ultrastructure of colonic epithelial cells in rat models of  induced by TNBS. Histological evaluation revealed that the intestinal crypts in the most regions of the -model colons were deformed and we classified them as having high cell migration rates (HMIG). The remaining regions in the intestinal crypts retained a relatively normal structure and we classified them as having low cell migration rates (LMIG). Osmium-maceration SEM revealed the mucosal fluid flowing in spaces without secretory granules in crypt goblet cells of both HMIG and LMIG regions, indicating the depletion of goblet cell mucin that is found in patients with . The Golgi apparatus in absorptive cells was stacked and curled in both regions. Osmium-maceration SEM showed membrane network structures resembling endoplasmic reticulum that were large and expanded in absorptive cells with HMIG rather than with LMIG regions in -model colons.

Colitis was induced in C57BL/6 mice by 3% w/v dextran-sodium-sulfate (DSS) in drinking water ad libitum over 9-days with MetT (15 mg/kg; via i. p. injection) or vehicle control (10% v/v DMSO+90% v/v phosphate buffered saline) administered twice daily during DSS challenge. MetT attenuated body-weight loss (50%, p < 0.05, n = 6), improved clinical score (53%, p < 0.05, n = 6) and inhibited serum lipid peroxidation. Histopathological damage decreased markedly in MetT-treated mice, as judged by maintenance of crypt integrity, goblet cell density and decreased cellular infiltrate. Colonic Ly6C, MPO-labelled cells and 3-chlorotyrosine (3-Cl-Tyr) decreased in MetT-treated mice, although biomarkers for nitrosative stress (3-nitro-tyrosine-tyrosine; 3-NO-Tyr) and low-molecular weight thiol damage (assessed as glutathione sulfonamide; GSA) were unchanged. Interestingly, MetT did not significantly impact colonic IL-10 and IL-6 levels, suggesting a non-immunomodulatory pathway. Overall, MetT ameliorated the severity of experimental , likely via a mechanism involving the modulation of MPO-mediated damage.Copyright © 2019.

This study hypothesized that as a standard of treatment and the primary alternative to biologics, conventional therapy should present robust effectiveness results in  outcomes.To investigate the effectiveness of conventional therapy for MS-.A systematic review with no time limit was conducted in July 2017 through the Cochrane Collaboration, MEDLINE, and LILACS databases. The inclusion criteria encompassed meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomized clinical trials, observational and case-control studies concerning conventional therapy in adult patients with MS-, including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Corticosteroids (prednisone, hydrocortisone, budesonide, prednisolone, dexamethasone), 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA) derivatives (mesalazine and sulfasalazine) and immunosuppressants [azathioprine (AZA), methotrexate (MTX), mycophenolate, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP)] were considered conventional therapy. The exclusion criteria were sample size below 50; narrative reviews; specific subpopulations (., pregnant women, comorbidities); studies on postoperative ; and languages other than English, Spanish, French or Portuguese. The primary outcome measures were clinical remission (induction or maintenance), clinical response and mucosal healing. As secondary outcomes, fecal calprotectin, hospitalization, death, and surgeries were analyzed. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria.The search strategy identified 1995 citations, of which 27 were considered eligible (7 meta-analyses, 20 individual studies). For induction of clinical remission, four meta-analyses were selected (AZA and 6-MP showed no advantage over placebo, MTX or 5-ASA in CD; MTX showed no statistically significant difference versus placebo, 6-MP, or 5-ASA in UC; tacrolimus was superior to placebo for UC in two meta-analyses). Only one meta-analysis evaluated clinical remission maintenance, showing no statistically significant difference between MTX and placebo, 5-ASA, or 6-MP in UC. AZA and 6-MP had no advantage over placebo in induction of clinical response in CD. Three meta-analyses showed the superiority of tacrolimus  placebo for induction of clinical response in UC. The clinical response rates for cyclosporine were 41.7% in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 55.4% in non-RCTs for UC. For induction of mucosal healing, one meta-analysis showed a favorable rate with tacrolimus versus placebo for UC. For secondary outcomes, no meta-analyses specifically evaluated fecal calprotectin, hospitalization or death. Two meta-analyses were retrieved evaluating colectomy rates for tacrolimus and cyclosporine in UC.

This role has largely been attributed to nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) signaling since the latter is considered a major inducer of RICK activation. In this study, we explored the molecular mechanisms accounting for RICK-mediated inhibition of inflammatory bowel disease (). In an initial series of studies focused on trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS)-colitis and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-colitis we showed that down-regulation of intestinal RICK expression in NOD2-intact mice by intra-rectal administration of a plasmid expressing RICK-specific siRNA was accompanied by down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine responses in the colon and protection of the mice from experimental colitis. Somewhat surprisingly, intra-rectal administration of RICK-siRNA also inhibited TNBS-colitis and DSS-colitis in NOD2-deficient and in NOD1/NOD2-double deficient mice. In complementary studies of humans with  we found that expression of RICK, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2 (cIAP2) and downstream signaling partners were markedly increased in inflamed tissue of  compared to controls without marked elevations of NOD1 or NOD2 expression. In addition, the increase in RICK expression correlated with disease activity and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses.

The  model was prepared by a single colon perfusion of 3-nitrobenzene sulfonic . At 3 days after modeling, the rats in the short peptide group were fed with short peptide formula (100 mL/kg), and those in the short peptide+glutamine group were fed with short peptide formula (100 mL/kg) and glutamine (0.5 g/kg). The course of intervention was 1 week. General conditions were observed after the experiment and their intestinal mucosal tissue was obtained. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used to observe the pathological change of the intestinal mucosa. RT-PCR was used to measure the expression of apoptosis-regulating genes (bax and bc1-2) and apoptotic signal transduction factors (Caspase-3 and Caspase-9) in the intestinal mucosa. Western blot was used to measure the expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in the colonic mucosa.The  model group had poorer general conditions than the other three groups (blank control, short peptide and short peptide+glutamine), and the short peptide+glutamine group had better general conditions than the  model and short peptide groups. The  model group had significantly higher mRNA expression of bax than the other three groups (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the mRNA expression of bcl-2, Caspase-3 and Caspase-9 among the 4 groups (P>0.05).

Intervention studies with dietary fibres in murine models of colonic inflammation have yielded conflicting results on whether fibres ameliorate or exacerbate . Herein, we examined how replacing the insoluble fibre, cellulose, with the fermentable fibres, inulin or pectin, impacted murine colitis resulting from immune dysregulation via inhibition of interleukin (IL)-10 signalling and/or innate immune deficiency (KO).Mice were fed with diet containing either cellulose, inulin or pectin and subjected to weekly injections of an IL-10 receptor (αIL-10R) neutralising antibody. Colitis development was examined by serological, biochemical, histological and immunological parameters.Inulin potentiated the severity of αIL10R-induced colitis, while pectin ameliorated the disease. Such exacerbation of colitis following inulin feeding was associated with enrichment of butyrate-producing bacteria and elevated levels of caecal butyrate. Blockade of butyrate production by either metronidazole or hops β- ameliorated colitis severity in inulin-fed mice, whereas augmenting caecal butyrate via tributyrin increased colitis severity in cellulose containing diet-fed mice. Elevated butyrate levels were associated with increased IL-1β activity, while inhibition of the NOD-like receptor protein 3 by genetic, pharmacologic or dietary means markedly reduced colitis.These results not only support the notion that fermentable fibres have the potential to ameliorate colitis but also caution that, in some contexts, prebiotic fibres can lead to gut dysbiosis and surfeit colonic butyrate that might exacerbate .© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

The efficacy of anti-adhesion therapies led us to investigate whether impaired trafficking of T-regulatory (Treg) cells contributes to the pathogenesis of CD. We also investigated whether proper function could be restored to Treg cells by ex vivo expansion in the presence of factors that activate their regulatory activities.We measured levels of the integrin α4β7 on Treg cells isolated from peripheral blood or lamina propria of patients with CD and healthy individuals (controls). Treg cells were expanded ex vivo and incubated with rapamycin with or without agonists of the retinoic  receptor-α (RARA), and their gene expression profiles were analyzed. We also studied the cells in cytokine challenge, suppression, and flow chamber assays and in SCID mice with human intestinal xenografts.We found that Treg cells from patients with CD express lower levels of the integrin α4β7 than Treg cells from control patients. The pathway that regulates the expression of integrin subunit α is induced by retinoic  (RA). Treg cells from patients with CD incubated with rapamycin and an agonist of RARA (RAR568) expressed high levels of integrin α4β7, as well as CD62L and FOXP3, compared with cells incubated with rapamycin or rapamycin and all-trans retinoic . These Treg cells had increased suppressive activities in assays and migrated under conditions of shear flow; they did not produce inflammatory cytokines, and RAR568 had no effect on cell stability or lineage commitment. Fluorescently labeled Treg cells incubated with RAR568 were significantly more likely to traffic to intestinal xenografts than Treg cells expanded in control medium.Treg cells from patients with CD express lower levels of the integrin α4β7 than Treg cells from control patients. Incubation of patients' ex vivo expanded Treg cells with rapamycin and an RARA agonist induced expression of α4β7 and had suppressive and migratory activities in culture and in intestinal xenografts in mice.

Intestinal ethanolamine is however readily accessible during periods of intestinal inflammation, and enables pathogens to outcompete the host microbiota under such circumstances.Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) to determine expression of genes central to ethanolamine metabolism; transmission electron microscopy to detect presence of bacterial microcompartments (MCPs); in vitro infections of both murine and human macrophage cell lines examining intracellular replication of the AIEC-type strain LF82 and clinical E. coli isolates in the presence of ethanolamine; determination of E. coli ethanolamine utilization (eut) operon transcription in faecal samples from healthy patients, patients with active CD and the same patients in remission following treatment.Growth on the intestinal short chain fatty  propionic  (PA) stimulates significantly increased transcription of the eut operon (fold change relative to glucose: >16.9; p-value <.01). Additionally ethanolamine was accessible to intra-macrophage AIEC and stimulated significant increases in growth intracellularly when it was added extracellularly at concentrations comparable to those in the human intestine. Finally, qRT-PCR indicated that expression of the E. coli eut operon was increased in children with active CD compared to healthy controls (fold change increase: >4.72; P < .02). After clinical remission post-exclusive enteral nutrition treatment, the same CD patients exhibited significantly reduced eut expression (Pre vs Post fold change decrease: >15.64; P < .01).Our data indicates a role for ethanolamine metabolism in selecting for AIEC that are consistently overrepresented in the CD intestine. The increased E. coli metabolism of ethanolamine seen in the intestine during active CD, and its decrease during remission, indicates ethanolamine use may be a key factor in shaping the intestinal microbiome in CD patients, particularly during times of inflammation.

Accumulating data implicate a potential role of disturbed tryptophan metabolism in . Kynurenic  (KYNA), a derivative of tryptophan (TRP) along the kynurenine (KYN) pathway, displays cytoprotective and immunomodulating properties, whereas 3-OH-KYN is a cytotoxic compound, generating free radicals.The expression of lymphocytic mRNA encoding enzymes synthesizing KYNA (KAT I-III) and serum levels of TRP and its metabolites were evaluated in 55 patients with , during remission or relapse [27 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 28 patients with Crohn's disease (CD)] and in 50 control individuals.The increased expression of KAT1 and KAT3 mRNA characterized the entire cohorts of patients with UC and CD, as well as relapse-remission subsets. Expression of KAT2 mRNA was enhanced in patients with UC and in patients with CD in remission. In the entire cohorts of UC or CD, TRP levels were lower, whereas KYN, KYNA and 3-OH-KYN were not altered. When analysed in subsets of patients with UC and CD (active phase-remission), KYNA level was significantly lower during remission than relapse, yet not  control. Functionally, in the whole groups of patients with UC or CD, the TRP/KYN ratio has been lower than control, whereas KYN/KYNA and KYNA/3-OH-KYN ratios were not altered. The ratio KYN/3-OH-KYN increased approximately two-fold among all patients with CD; furthermore, patients with CD with relapse, manifested a significantly higher KYNA/3-OH-KYN ratio than patients in remission.The presented data indicate that  is associated with an enhanced expression of genes encoding KYNA biosynthetic enzymes in lymphocytes; however, additional mechanisms appear to influence KYNA levels. Higher metabolic conversion of serum TRP in  seems to be followed by the functional shift of KYN pathway towards the arm producing KYNA during exacerbation. We propose that KYNA, possibly  interaction with aryl hydrocarbon receptor or G-protein-coupled orphan receptor 35, may serve as a counter-regulatory mechanism, decreasing cytotoxicity and inflammation in . Further longitudinal studies evaluating the individual dynamics of TRP and KYN pathway in patients with , as well as the nature of precise mechanisms regulating KYNA synthesis, should be helpful in better understanding the processes underlying the observed changes.© The Author(s), 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880316>Role of inulin as prebiotics on inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>The present review is focused on the prebiotic impact of inulin on the management of the gastrointestinal disorder. Prebiotics can be described as "non-digestible food ingredient stimulating the growth of a certain number of bacteria in the colon, which can improve the host health".

Prebiotics shows a positive effect in the prevention of  by modulating the trophic functions of the flora. Inulin enhances the growth of indigenous lactobacilli and/or bifidobacteria by inducing colonic production of short chain fatty  (SCFA's) and these properties are related to decreased mucosal lesion scores and diminished mucosal inflammation. Inulin shows a positive approach to retain microbial populations and to support epithelial barrier function by their prebiotic effect which helps in the host defense against invasion and pathogens translocation (endogenous and/or exogenous) and in the inhibition of gastrointestinal diseases and this impact should be verified in further clinical studies. In the present review, we discussed the positive effect of prebiotics in rat  models and in human subjects along with their potential protective mechanisms.

Synbiotic, which is a two-point approach carrying probiotic and prebiotic components in mitigating inflammation in , is thought to be a pragmatic approach owing to the synergistic outcomes. In this study, the impacts of dietary supplementation with probiotic  MTCC5856 spores () and prebiotic whole plant sugar cane fibre (PSCF) was assessed using a murine model of . Eight-week-old C57BL/6 mice were fed a normal chow diet supplemented with either , PSCF or its synbiotic combination. After seven days of supplementation, colitis was induced with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for seven days during the continuation of the supplemented diets. Synbiotic supplementation ameliorated disease activity index and histological score (-72%, 7.38, respectively), more effectively than either  (-47%, 10.1) and PSCF (-53%, 13.0) alone. Synbiotic supplementation also significantly ( < 0.0001) prevented the expression of tight junction proteins and modulated the altered serum IL-1β (-40%), IL-10 (+26%), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (-39%) levels. Synbiotic supplementations also raised the short-chain fatty  (SCFA) profile more extensively compared to the unsupplemented DSS-control. The synbiotic health outcome effect of the probiotic and prebiotic combinations may be associated with a synergistic direct immune-regulating efficacy of the components, their ability to protect epithelial integrity, stimulation of probiotic spores by the prebiotic fibre, and/or with stimulation of greater levels of fermentation of fibres releasing SCFAs that mediate the reduction in colonic inflammation. Our model findings suggest synbiotic supplementation should be tested in clinical trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783951>Clinical significance of low transaminase levels in children with inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Low alanine aminotransaminase (LALT) levels may be seen in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (), but there has been no study about the frequency and its clinical significance.

LALT was defined as ALT levels < 5 U/L. Demographic and clinical findings and outcome of the patients with and without LALT were compared.LALT was found 47.1% of the patients. At initial examination, it was more common in female patients (92.3 vs. 41.3%, P < 0.001) and patients with CD (57.7 vs. 30.2%, P = 0.01). 75% of the patients with penetrating Crohn's disease (CD) had LALT (P = 0.002). Hemoglobin (10.4 ± 2.1 vs. 11.7 ± 1.9 g/dL, P = 0.01), folic  (5.2 ± 3.3 vs. 8.6 ± 5.9 ng/mL, P = 0.02) and serum albumin levels (3.6 ± 0.8 vs. 4.7 ± 5 g/dL, P = 0.002) were significantly low in patients with LALT. LALT was associted with the disease relapse within 2 weeks in 12 of the 16 patients with LALT whereas it was seen in 16 of the 73 patients without LALT during the follow-up (75 vs. 21.9%, P < 0.001). Additionally, steroid dependency was more common in patients with LALT during the follow-up (62.5 vs. 12.3%, P < 0.001).LALT is common in children with  especially in CD and associated with low hemoglobin, albumin and folic  levels.

Exosome-induced regulation in inflammatory bowel disease () is becoming increasingly popular due to their potential functions of exosomal pathways. Exosomes, which are involved in the regulation of , can be released from various cell types, or found in many physiological fluids, and plants. The specific functions of exosomes in  primarily depend on the internal functional components, including RNAs, proteins, and other substances.

The aim of the review was to analyze literature data in order to identify the main risk conditions described in literature and the proposed treatment.A research on the databases PubMed, Medline, Embase and Google Scholar was performed by using the keywords "renal calculi/lithiasis/stones" and "inflammatory bowel diseases". A research on textbooks of reference for Pediatric Nephrology was also performed, with focus on secondary forms of nephrolithiasis.Historical studies have demonstrated that the prevalence of symptomatic nephrolithiasis is higher in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (), compared to general population, typically in patients who underwent extensive small bowel resection or in those with persistent severe small bowel inflammation. In , kidney stones may arise from chronic inflammation, changes in intestinal absorption due to inflammation, surgery or intestinal malabsorption. Kidney stones are more closely associated with Crohn's Disease (CD) than Ulcerative Colitis (UC) in adult patients for multiple reasons: mainly for malabsorption, but in UC intestinal resection may be an additional risk. Nephrolithiasis is often under-diagnosed and might be a rare but noticeable extra-intestinal presentation of pediatric . Secondary enteric hyperoxaluria the main risk factor of UL in , this has been mainly studied in CD, whether in UC has not been completely explained. In the long course of CD recurrent urolithiasis and calcium-oxalate deposition may cause severe chronic interstitial nephritis and, as a consequence, chronic kidney disease. ESRD and systemic oxalosis often develop early, especially in those patients with multiple bowel resections. Even if we consider that many additional factors are present in  as hypomagnesuria, acidosis, hypocitraturia, and others, the secondary hyperoxaluria seems to finally have a central role. Some medications as parenteral vitamin D, long-term and high dose steroid treatment, sulfasalazine are reported as additional risk factors. Hydration status may also play an important role in this process. Intestinal surgery is a widely described independent risk factor. Patients with ileostomy post bowel resection may have relative dehydration from liquid stool, which, added to the acidic pH from bicarbonate loss, is responsible for this process. In this acidic pH, the urinary citrate level excretion reduces. The stones most commonly seen in these patients contain uric  or are mixed. In addition, the risk of calcium containing stones also increases with ileostomy. The treatment of UL in  involves correction of the basic gastrointestinal tract inflammation, restricted dietary oxalate intake, and, at times, increased calcium intake. Citrate therapy that increases both urine pH and urinary citrate could also provide an additional therapeutic benefit.

A Review.</a></h2><p>Chronic inflammation takes part in the pathogenesis of some malignancies of the gastrointestinal tract including colorectal (CRC), gastric, and esophageal cancers. The use of ω3 polyunsaturated fatty  (ω3-PUFA) supplements for chemoprevention or adjuvant therapy of gastrointestinal cancers is being investigated in recent years. Most evidence has been reported in CRC, although their protective role has also been reported for -induced gastric cancer or Barrett's esophagus-derived adenocarcinoma. Studies based on ω3-PUFA supplementation in animal models of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and CRC revealed positive effects on cancer prevention, reducing the number and size of tumors, down-regulating arachidonic -derived eicosanoids, upregulating anti-oxidant enzymes, and reducing lipid peroxidation, whereas contradictory results have been found in induced colitis and colitis-associated cancer. Beneficial effects have also been found in FAP and ulcerative colitis patients. Of special interest is their positive effect as adjuvants on radio- and chemo-sensitivity, specificity, and prevention of treatment complications. Some controversial results obtained in CRC might be justified by different dietary sources, extraction and preparation procedures of ω3-PUFAs, difficulties on filling out food questionnaires, daily dose and type of PUFAs, adenoma subtype, location of CRC, sex differences, and genetic factors. Studies using animal models of inflammatory bowel disease have confirmed that exogenous administration of active metabolites derived from PUFAs called pro-resolving mediators like lipoxin A4, arachidonic -derived, resolvins derived from eicosapentaenoic (EPA), docosahexaenoic (DHA), and docosapentaenoic (DPA)  as well as maresin 1 and protectins DHA- and DPA-derived improve disease and inflammatory outcomes without causing immunosuppression or other side effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31145641>Daphnetin ameliorates experimental colitis by modulating microbiota composition and T/T17 balance.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are characterized by chronic pathologies associated with extensive gut dysbiosis and intestinal inflammation. Hence, endeavors to improve the inflammatory pathology by manipulating gut microbiota are ongoing. Daphnetin (DAPH) is a coumarin derivative extracted from  with anti-inflammatory and immune-regulatory properties that has been widely used in treating inflammatory disorders. Herein, we showed that DAPH remarkably alleviated experimental colitis by reducing colonic inflammation, improving colonic integrity, and reestablishing immune and metabolic homeostasis in the inflicted intestines. Our analysis showed that DAPH modified the composition of gut microbiota and altered the metabolic profiles in dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice. In particular, this agent significantly elevated the abundance of short-chain fatty  (SCFA)-producing gut microbiota, causatively related with the enhanced development of T cells and the reduced proinflammatory T17 cell differentiation. More critically, the protective effect of DAPH was shown to be transmissible among colitic mice through cohousing or fecal microbiota transplantation, further substantiating the importance of SCFA-producing gut microbiota in DAPH action. We thus for the first time reveal the potential of DAPH in resetting the gut microbiome and reestablishing immune homeostasis in colitic mice, which may have clinical implications for treating .-Ji, J., Ge, X., Chen, Y., Zhu, B., Wu, Q., Zhang, J., Shan, J., Cheng, H., Shi, L.

According to the capacity of M2000 in suppressing some molecules involved in Toll Like Receptors (TLRs) signaling and reducing oxidative stress we hypothesize that, this molecule may have a potential role in decreasing inflammatory responses in . The aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxicity of M2000 and its effect on the gene expression of TLR2 and TLR4.HEK293 cell line was grown and divided into 96-well cell plate and MTT assay was performed. HT29 cells were cultured and treated with low and high doses of M2000. Total RNA was extracted and cDNA synthesized and quantitative real-time PCR was done to quantify the TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA expression.We found that M2000 at the concentration of ≤ 1000µg/ml had no obvious cytotoxicity effect on the HEK293 cells. Also, low and high doses of M2000 could significantly down-regulate both TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA expression. Moreover, a significant reduction in gene expression of TLR2 and TLR4 in an inflammatory condition resulted in high doses of M2000 in the presence of LPS.Our study which was conducted in colonic epithelial cell model, shows that M2000 can be considered as a new anti-inflammatory agent in .

Currently, biopsies are the most used diagnostic tests for these diseases and metabolomics could represent a less invasive approach to identify biomarkers of disease presence and progression.The lipid and the polar metabolite profile of plasma samples of patients affected by inflammatory bowel disease have been compared with healthy individuals with the aim to find their metabolomic differences. Also, a selected sub-set of samples was analysed following solid phase extraction to further characterise differences between pathological samples.A total of 200 plasma samples were analysed using drift tube ion mobility coupled with time of flight mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography for the lipid metabolite profile analysis, while liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry was used for the polar metabolite profile analysis.Variations in the lipid profile between inflammatory bowel disease and healthy individuals were highlighted. Phosphatidylcholines, lyso-phosphatidylcholines and fatty  were significantly changed among pathological samples suggesting changes in phospholipase A and arachidonic  metabolic pathways. Variations in the levels of cholesteryl esters and glycerophospholipids were also found.

GLP-2 and its analogs have reported to increase remission rates in patients with Crohn's disease and improve experimental colitis in rodents. In the present study, we investigated the ameliorative effect of GPR40 activation in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced murine colitis model using a specific GPR40 agonist, AS2034178. The daily administration of AS2034178 attenuated DSS-induced increases in the disease activity index, the shortening of the colon length, and the histological colonic injury, and increased the myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and expression of inflammatory cytokines, in a dose-dependent manner. These effects were abolished by treatment with DC260126, a GPR40 antagonist, or GLP-2 (3-33), a GLP-2 antagonist. GPR40 was expressed in the colonic mucosa, which was colocalized with proglucagon, a precursor of GLP-2. AS2034178 significantly increased the amount of GLP-2 in the colonic tissue, which was abolished by DC260126 but not GLP-2 (3-33).

Here, we generate intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific RORα-deficient (RORα) mice and find that RORα is crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis by attenuating nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcriptional activity. RORα mice exhibit excessive intestinal inflammation and highly activated inflammatory responses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse colitis model. Transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of RORα leads to up-regulation of NF-κB target genes in IECs.

A possible mechanism postulates that the lack of the NLRP1 inflammasome creates permissive niches in the gut for pathogenic bacteria to flourish, causing dysbiosis and increased  susceptibility. To evaluate this hypothesis, we characterized the gut microbiome of wild-type, Nlrp1b-/-, and Asc-/- mice under naïve conditions by sequencing the V3 region of the 16s rRNA gene. For both genetically modified mouse lines, the microbiome composition reflected overrepresentation of bacteria associated with dysbiosis relative to wild-type animals. Measurement of short- and medium-chain fatty  by mass spectrometry further revealed significant differences between genotypes. However, prior to concluding that the NLRP1 inflammasome plays a role in regulating the composition of the microbiome, we evaluated two additional strategies for cohousing wild-type and Nlrp1b-/- mice: breeding homozygous parents and cohousing at weaning, and breeding from heterozygous parents and cohousing littermates. We found that maternal influence was the greater predictor of microbiome composition rather than genotype.

While  has been associated with dramatic changes in the gut microbiota, changes in the gut metabolome-the molecular interface between host and microbiota-are less well understood. To address this gap, we performed untargeted metabolomic and shotgun metagenomic profiling of cross-sectional stool samples from discovery (n = 155) and validation (n = 65) cohorts of CD, UC and non- control patients. Metabolomic and metagenomic profiles were broadly correlated with faecal calprotectin levels (a measure of gut inflammation). Across >8,000 measured metabolite features, we identified chemicals and chemical classes that were differentially abundant in , including enrichments for sphingolipids and bile , and depletions for triacylglycerols and tetrapyrroles. While > 50% of differentially abundant metabolite features were uncharacterized, many could be assigned putative roles through metabolomic 'guilt by association' (covariation with known metabolites). Differentially abundant species and functions from the metagenomic profiles reflected adaptation to oxidative stress in the  gut, and were individually consistent with previous findings. Integrating these data, however, we identified 122 robust associations between differentially abundant species and well-characterized differentially abundant metabolites, indicating possible mechanistic relationships that are perturbed in . Finally, we found that metabolome- and metagenome-based classifiers of  status were highly accurate and, like the vast majority of individual trends, generalized well to the independent validation cohort.

The SEP was successfully extracted and encapsulated by CS/F NPs. When the SEP/CS/F weight ratio was 0.2/3/1, the NPs were spherical with 100 nm in diameter and 10 mV in zeta potential. The NPs were stable in simulated gastric  (pH = 1.2), and released 50% of SEP when disintegrated in imitating intestinal environment (pH = 7.4). The SEP-CS/F NPs had good biocompatibility and presented high antioxidant activities. Using co-culture Caco-2 and RAW264.7 cells for immunomodulatory assessment, the SEP-CS/F NPs effectively reduced the amount of NO and inhibited the TNF-α and IL-6 production. Moreover, the SEP-CS/F NPs could protect the IECs from disruption caused by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) evidenced by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance and paracellular permeability of fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran. Briefly, the CS/F NPs are potential carriers for SEP delivery to ameliorate LPS-induced intestinal epithelial inflammation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

They play a critical role in store-operated Ca entry (SOCE; i.e., the influx of external Ca that is induced by the depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca stores). Of the three Orai homologs that are present in mammals (Orai1-3), the physiological function of Orai1 is the best described. CRACs are formed by both homomeric assemblies and heteromultimers of Orais. Orai1 and Orai2 can form heteromeric channels that differ in conductivity during SOCE, depending on their Orai1-to-Orai2 ratio. The present study explored the potential consequences of ORAI1 overexpression in neurons where the dominant isoform is Orai2. We established the Tg(ORAI1) transgenic mouse line that overexpresses ORAI1 in brain neurons. We observed seizure-like symptoms in aged (≥15-month-old) female mice but not in males of the same age. The application of kainic  and bicuculline to slices that were isolated from 8-month-old (±1 month) female Tg(ORAI1) mice revealed a significantly lower frequency of interictal bursts compared with samples that were isolated from wildtype mice. No differences were observed in male mice of a similar age. A battery of behavioral tests showed that context recognition decreased only in female transgenic mice. The phenotype that was observed in female mice suggests that ORAI1 overexpression may affect neuronal activity in a sex-dependent manner.

Local delivery of biologics directly to the inflamed mucosa via rectal enema administration addresses the problems associated with systemic administration. Hydrogels are potentially useful delivery vehicles enabling rectal administration of biologics. Here, we prepared a hydrogel system based on methylcellulose (MC) and hyaluronic  (HA), which possesses mucosal healing properties, incorporating a model macromolecular drug, namely (fluorescently-labeled) bovine serum albumin (BSA). The BSA-loaded MCHA hydrogel showed temperature-dependent gelation (liquid-like at 20 °C and gel-like at 37 °C) and shear thinning behavior, with these being important and desirable characteristics for rectal application (enabling easy application and retention). BSA release from the MCHA system at 37 °C was linear, with 50% of the loaded drug released within 2 h. The system demonstrated acceptable toxicity towards intestinal (colon) Caco-2 epithelial cells, even at high concentrations. Importantly, application of the BSA-loaded MCHA hydrogel to polarized Caco-2 monolayers, with or without an exemplar absorption enhancer, resulted in transintestinal permeability of BSA. The study therefore indicates that the MCHA hydrogel shows potential for topical (rectal) delivery of biologics in .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30989902>[Application of active components from traditional Chinese medicine in treatment of inflammatory bowel disease].</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease() is a non-specific and chronic recurrent autoimmune disease that involves the gastrointestinal tract.

In the biologic era, it still remains the treatment of choice in mild-to-moderate UC. Positioning of this therapeutic class in moderate-to-severe UC is less clear. : Several studies demonstrated the ability of 5-ASA to induce endoscopic remission to a similar extent as anti-TNF therapy on the moderate segment of UC. Histologic remission is achieved after induction in up to 45% of patients treated with topical 5-ASA and 30% with oral formulations. Aminosalicylates offer a favorable safety profile compared to that of immunomodulators and biologics. High-dose 5-ASA therapy may be a valuable option for patients with moderately active disease, and physicians should weigh the pros and cons of this strategy in selected patients. Whether aminosalicylates should be continued in combination with thiopurines or biologic therapy remains under debate. : In the era of biologics, aminosalicylates remain the first-line therapy in patients with mild UC, and have to be considered in case of moderate UC, given their favorable risk-benefit profile. We suggest that 5-ASA should be used in moderate patients without poor prognostic factors, while biologics should be preferred otherwise.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31281735>Gut microbiota metabolite regulation of host defenses at mucosal surfaces: implication in precision medicine.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiota has a well-established role in the regulation of host homeostasis. Multiple factors control the composition and function of the microbiota. The westernization of diet, a shift away from nutrient-dense foods toward diets high in saturated fats, has been implicated in the rise of chronic inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (). Diet is critical in the development and maintenance of a healthy microbiome, where dietary fiber (found in the highest amounts in fruits, vegetables, and legumes) is metabolized by the microbiome. In turn, the bacterial metabolites of dietary fiber, short chain fatty  (SCFAs), regulate gut homeostasis. SCFAs engage G-protein coupled receptors (GPRs) and act as histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) to module epithelial and immune cell functions in the intestines, where they generally promote an anti-inflammatory state. This review highlights the functions of SCFAs and their roles in the pathogenesis of  to provide insights into their potential therapeutic application for the treatment of  for the purposes of precision medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827390>Novel variant strains of infectious bursal disease virus isolated in China.</a></h2><p>Infectious bursal disease () is one of the most important immunosuppressive diseases that seriously threaten poultry farming and food safety worldwide. The variant strain of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) has been greatly neglected for more than 30 years. Recently, the subclinical infection of suspected , causing considerable economic losses, occurred in the main chicken-farming regions of China. Through RT-PCR, sequencing, and phylogenic analyses, novel variant IBDVs were first identified in six provinces of eastern China. Immunological detection further confirmed the antigenic variation of the Chinese variant IBDVs. The Chinese IBDV variants were obviously different from the American IBDV variants, with less than a 97.7% (VP1) or 98.7% (VP2) amino  sequence identity. Animal experiments further confirmed the serious threat of the variant IBDVs to chickens, demonstrating irreversible damage to the central immune organ, obvious immunosuppression, and growth retardation. This study not only identified the pandemic nature of the novel variant IBDVs for the first time but also discovered the distinct molecular epidemiological characteristics of these viruses, which will contribute more to the control of the disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

CRYAB expression was assessed in cultured HT29 and Caco-2 cells and inflamed mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease () and colitis models in mice. Lentivirus-overexpressing and CRSIPR/Cas9 systems were used in different cells to upregulate and silence CRYAB expression, respectively. Cell permeable recombined fusion protein TAT-CRYAB was injected intraperitoneally into dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)- or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS)-induced colitis in mice to assess its anti-inflammatory effects. CRYAB was found to be significantly decreased in the inflamed mucosa from  patients and DSS-induced colitis in mice, and negatively correlated with the levels of TNF-α and IL-6, respectively. Enforced expression of CRYAB suppressed expression of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-8) via inhibiting the IKK complex formation, whereas lack of CRYAB expression markedly enhanced proinflammatory responses. Consistently, administration of TAT-CRYAB fusion protein significantly alleviated DSS- or TNBS-induced colitis in mice and protected intestinal barrier integrity. CRYAB regulates inflammatory response in intestinal mucosa by inhibiting IKKβ-mediated signaling and may serve as a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31574900>Omega Fatty  and Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: An Overview.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases () are chronic, inflammatory processes that affect the gastrointestinal tract and are mainly represented by ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Omega 3 (ω3) fatty  (eicosapentanoic  and docosahexaenoic ) show an indispensable role in the inflammatory processes and, for these reasons, we aimed to review the effects of these  on UC and CD. Databases such as PUMED and EMBASE were searched, and the final selection included fifteen studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The results showed that ω3 fatty  reduce intestinal inflammation, induce and maintain clinical remission in UC patients, and are related with the reduction of proinflammatory cytokines, decrease disease activity and increase the quality of life of CD patients. Furthermore, the consumption of these fatty  may be related to a reduced risk of developing . Many studies have shown the beneficial effects of ω3 as adjunctive in the treatment or prevention of UC or CD. Nevertheless, most were performed with a small number of patients and there are many variations in the mode of consumption, the type of food or the type of formulation used.

However, oral delivery of nucleic  (NAs) to an inflamed colon is challenged by multiple barriers presented by the gastrointestinal, extracellular and intracellular compartments. Therefore, we screened a series of polyaspartic -derived amphiphilic cationic polymers with varied hydrophobicity for their ability to deliver NAs into mammalian cells. Using the most effective TAC6 polymer, we then engineered biocompatible and stable nanogels composed of polyplexes (TAC6, NA) and an anionic polymer, sodium polyaspartate, that were able to deliver the NAs across mammalian cells using caveolae-mediated cellular uptake. We then utilized these nanogels for oral delivery of PIAS1 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT1), a SUMO 3 ligase, encoding plasmid DNA since PIAS1 is a key nodal therapeutic target for  due to its ability to control NF-κB-mediated inflammatory signaling. We show that plasmid delivery using TAC6-derived nanogels diminished gut inflammation in a murine colitis model. Therefore, our study presents engineering of orally deliverable nanogels that can target SUMOylation machinery to combat gut inflammation with very high efficacy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312216>Epidemiology and Clinical Outcomes of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Hospital-Based Study in Central Taiwan.</a></h2><p>The incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease () are low but increasing in Taiwan. We aimed to investigate the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of  in central Taiwan. We retrospectively analyzed patients with  diagnosed at our hospital between January 2000 and September 2018. The diagnostic criteria were based on endoscopic and pathologic findings. Clinical characteristics, treatment regimens, and treatment outcomes were analyzed. A total of 190 patients with  were enrolled (80 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 110 with ulcerative colitis (UC)). The mean age at diagnosis was 38.4 years (CD: 36 years, UC: 40 years). Male patients accounted for the majority of patients (71.1%). The male-to-female ratio was 3 : 1 for CD and 2.1 : 1 for UC. Current and ever smokers accounted for 30.5% of all patients. Only 4.2% of patients had a family history of . Extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) were reported in 7.9%, and colorectal cancers (CRCs) were reported in 2.1% of all patients. In patients with CD, the ileal type was the most common disease phenotype (57.5%), and the stricturing type was the most common disease behavior (60.0%). In patients with UC, left-sided colitis was the predominant disease extent (42.7%). The seroprevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) was 13.3%. The incidence of perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (p-ANCA) in patients with UC was 22%. 5-Aminosalicylic  were the preferred treatment for UC, whereas corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and biologic agents were preferred for CD. In patients with CD, the bowel resection rate was 38.8%, and the incidence of hip avascular necrosis was 3.8%. In Taiwan, patients with  showed a male predominance, lack of familial clustering, a higher prevalence of HBV infection, and a lower prevalence of p-ANCA, EIMs, and CRC.

Epidemiology studies demonstrated higher incidence rates in the more westernized countries. The change of habitual diets in these countries is perceived as the reason for the development of . Besides, molecular biological studies showed some pathogenic substances produced after digestion of daily diet decrease the diversity of intestinal microbiota and cause dysbiosis of microbiome. Then, chronic inflammation occurs in some genetically susceptible subjects and  developed. As a result, many researchers started to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of nutrients and dietary intervention on the clinical course and pathogenesis of . Carbohydrates, fats, proteins and fibers are investigated and their molecular roles in the inflammatory process are discovered gradually. The undigested carbohydrates are proved to cause overgrowth of colonic bacteria and inflammation occurs by altering colonic microbiome. ω-3 poly-unsaturated fatty  are more favored over ω-6 poly-unsaturated fatty  due to its less pro-inflammatory properties. High fibers produce more short-chain fatty  in colon and facilitate the diversity of colonic microbiota. Moreover, some dietary interventions were designed and studied with promising results. Low FODMAP is recommended in IBS and is also suggested in patients of  with IBS-like symptoms. Specific Carbohydrate Diet was designed for celiac disease at first and is proved to be effective to decrease inflammation and to induce remission by decreasing non-digested carbohydrates into colon. Exclusive Enteral Nutrition has been investigated and is suggested to be the first line of management in pediatric CD in many literatures. Paleolithic diet and semi-vegetarian diet are evaluated and might be beneficial in some clinical settings. These findings are promising but limited to the evidence without high quality level. Some more well-designed studies with randomization and double-blind are needed and the primary endpoints should be more focused on the decrease of inflammation in pathology and mucosal healing in endoscopy instead of relief of the symptoms.Copyright © 2019.

The samples were subjected for virus adaptation in primary chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells followed by confirmation by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for partial VP sequence and phylogenetic analysis.The isolation of IBDV from field samples took seven blind passages for adaptation in CEF. The cytopathic effects included rounding, aggregation, vacuolation, and detachment of the cells. The RT-PCR showed amplification of 627 bp amplicon specific to the primers for VP gene fragment which confirmed successful adaptation and isolation of IBDV using CEF. The nucleotide and deduced amino  based on phylogeny clustered the current isolate in a distinct clade with classical virulent and antigenic variants. It showed divergence from very virulent (vv) and vaccine strains of Indian origin. The isolate showed unique amino  substitution at A329V as compared to all other IBDVs. The variation in key amino  was reported at A222, I242, Q249, Q253, A256, T270, N279, T284, I286, L294, N299, and V329. It shared conserved amino  at position A222, I242, and Q253 as reported in vvIBDV isolates. However, the amino  reported at position T270, N279, T284, L294, and N299 are conserved in classic, antigenic variant and attenuated strains of IBDV. The amino  at positions N279 and T284 indicated that the isolate has key amino  for cell culture replication.The IBDV field isolate does not reveal the full nucleotide sequence signature of vvIBDV as well as vaccine strains. Hence, we can conclude that it might not belong to vvIBDVs of Indian origin and the vaccine strain used in the region. This may be suggestive of the evolution of the IBDV in the field due to the coexistence of circulating field strains and live attenuated hot strains, resulting into morbidity and mortality, warranting the need for safer protective vaccines, and implementation of stringent biosecurity measures to minimize loss to farmers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30916990>Tethering soluble meprin α in an enzyme complex to the cell surface affects -associated genes.</a></h2><p>Biologic activity of proteases is mainly characterized by the substrate specificity, tissue distribution, and cellular localization. The human metalloproteases meprin α and meprin β share 41% sequence identity and exhibit a similar cleavage specificity with a preference for negatively charged amino . However, shedding of meprin α by furin on the secretory pathway makes it a secreted enzyme in comparison with the membrane-bound meprin β. In this study, we identified human meprin α and meprin β as forming covalently linked membrane-tethered heterodimers in the early endoplasmic reticulum, thereby preventing furin-mediated secretion of meprin α. Within this newly formed enzyme complex, meprin α was able to be activated on the cell surface and detected by cleavage of a novel specific fluorogenic peptide substrate. However, the known meprin β substrates amyloid precursor protein and CD99 were not shed by membrane-tethered meprin α. On the other hand, being linked to meprin α, activation of or substrate cleavage by meprin β on the cell surface was not altered. Interestingly, proteolytic activity of both proteases was increased in the heteromeric complex, indicating an increased proteolytic potential at the plasma membrane. Because meprins are susceptibility genes for inflammatory bowel disease (), and to investigate the physiologic impact of the enzyme complex, we performed transcriptome analyses of intestinal mucosa from meprin-knockout mice. Comparison of the transcriptional gene analysis data with gene analyses of  patients revealed that different gene subsets were dysregulated if meprin α was expressed alone or in the enzyme complex, demonstrating the physiologic and pathophysiological relevance of the meprin heterodimer formation.-Peters, F., Scharfenberg, F., Colmorgen, C., Armbrust, F., Wichert, R., Arnold, P., Potempa, B., Potempa, J., Pietrzik, C.

Chemically induced colitis models are relatively easy and rapid to develop. The 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS) colitis model is one of the main models in the experimental studies of inflammatory bowel disease () since inflammation induced by TNBS mimics several features of Crohn's disease. This review aims to summarize the existing literature and discuss different protocols for the induction of chronic model of TNBS-induced colitis.

All-trans retinoic  (ATRA), a key vitamin A metabolite, was earlier shown by us to stimulate DRA expression in intestinal epithelial cells. However, its role in modulating DRA in gut inflammation has not been investigated.Our aim was to analyze the efficacy of ATRA in counteracting inflammation-induced decrease in DRA in vitro and in vivo.Interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-treated Caco-2 cells and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated C57BL/6J mice served as in vitro and in vivo models of gut inflammation, respectively. The effect of ATRA on IFN-γ-mediated inhibition of DRA function, expression, and promoter activity were elucidated. In the DSS colitis model, diarrheal phenotype, cytokine response, in vivo imaging, myeloperoxidase activity, and DRA expression were measured in the distal colon.All-trans retinoic  (10 μM, 24 h) abrogated IFN-γ (30 ng/mL, 24 h)-induced decrease in DRA function, expression, and promoter activity in Caco-2 cells. All-trans retinoic  altered IFN-γ signaling via blocking IFN-γ-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-1.

Multiple environmental factors, including food ingredients, have been implicated in the development of these diseases. For example, animal fat-rich diets are predisposing factors for ulcerative colitis, whereas n-3 unsaturated fatty  such as docosahexaenoic  (DHA) show protective effects in experimental colitis and are negatively correlated with the incidence of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Given that DHA exhibits agonistic activity on retinoid X receptor (RXR), activation of RXR could be a therapeutic strategy for . However, conventional full RXR agonists are known to show considerable adverse effects. We therefore took advantage of a partial RXR agonist, CBt-PMN, to minimize the adverse effects, and evaluated its efficacy in dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis. Administration of CBt-PMN efficiently ameliorated the symptoms of colitis. This effect was attributed to the down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Tnf and Il6 in colon-infiltrating monocytes. Down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines by CBt-PMN was also evident in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Among many RXR-associated nuclear receptors, activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ) and nuclear hormone receptor 77 (Nur77) suppressed cytokine production by BMDMs. These observations suggest that the activation of PPARδ/RXR and Nur77/RXR heterodimers by CBt-PMN through the permissive mechanism is responsible for diminishing the monocyte-mediated inflammatory response in the gut. Our data highlight the importance of RXR activation in the regulation of colitis.© The Japanese Society for Immunology. 2018. All rights reserved.

Trinitrobenzene sulfonic  was injected into the colon of mice to establish  model. The mice were divided into four groups (n = 4): control, model, Ad5, and Ad5-CDC42. After establishing  model, mice which were treated with AD5 empty vector and AD5-CDC42 expression vector served as the Ad5 group and Ad5-CDC42 group, respectively. The mRNA and protein levels of interleukin 10 (IL-10), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), IL-4, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in the colon tissues were evaluated by RT-PCR and western blot, respectively. Their levels in the serum and colon tissues were examined by ELISA assay and immunohistochemical analysis, respectively. Their changes in the mRNA and protein levels were consistent and similar changes in the colon tissues and the serum were found among various groups. The levels of IL-10, IFN-γ, IL-4, and TNF-α were lowest in the control group. Their levels in the model group and the Ad5 group were similar (p > .05) and significantly higher than those in the control group (p < .05). In comparison with the model group and the Ad5 group, their levels were significantly reduced in the Ad5-CDC42 group (p < .05).

Developing novel efficient therapeutics is still a common interest for clinicians. Increasing evidence have shown that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6) contributes to the pathological pain state in some pain models. Resveratrol (RSV) has showed promising potential for the treatment of neuropathic pain and inflammatory pain. However, whether RSV has analgesic effect on visceral pain and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we established the colitis model through intrarectal administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS), and found that TNBS induced colonic inflammation and visceral hypersensitivity. Meanwhile, astroglial marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), TRAF6, phosphorylation of NF-κB (pNF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels were increased in L6-S1 spinal cord after TNBS enema. Then, intrathecal injection of TRAF6 siRNA attenuated visceral pain, blocked the upregulation of pNF-κB, TNF-α and IL-1β levels in the spinal cord in TNBS mice. Furthermore, spinal administration of NF-κB inhibitor, BAY11-7082 reversed the pain behavior and suppressed spinal TNF-α and IL-1β expression in TNBS mice. Finally, repeated intrathecal injection of RSV reversed TNBS-induced visceral pain hypersensitivity in a dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, TNBS-induced enhancement of spinal GFAP, TRAF6, pNF-κB, TNF-α and IL-1β were reduced by the same treatment of RSV. In conclusion, our results suggest that RSV exerts the effects of antinociception on colitis-induced visceral hyperalgesia through inhibition of spinal TRAF6/NF-κB signaling pathway and the production of inflammatory mediators in the spinal cord, suggesting a new application of RSV for the treatment of visceral pain.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Forty male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups. An OJ rat model was established by the following protocols. Seven days after obstruction, an SD rats model with 70% partial hepatectomy was established by different drainage methods of OJ. Blood and liver tissue samples were collected from rats 72 h after surgery; 72 h after partial hepatectomy (PH), the liver regeneration rate, the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and the level of mitotic index (MI) in the internal biliary drainage () group were higher than those in external biliary drainage (EBD) group (P less than 0.05). Those in the EBD group were higher compared to the OJ group (P less than 0.05). There was no significant difference among the  group, EBD+CA group and (SO) sham operation group (P>0.05). Bax expressions had the same trend as AI in the five groups. The expression of Bcl-2 was increased in the  group and EBD+CA group, which was statistically higher compared to the SO group (P less than 0.05).

An inadequate immune response against bacteria of the gastrointestinal tract is the basic mechanism mediating the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (). The risk of  is partially heritable and approximately 12 % of patients have a family history of . Large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were able to identify 240 genetic regions associated with . Many of the implicated genes have a function in the immune system, are associated with primary immunodeficiencies or the defense against mycobacteria. Together these 240 genetic regions form an excellent framework for further investigations into the pathogenesis and therapy of . However, GWAS so far were able to unravel only a fraction of the genetic  risk. New strategies like genome wide sequencing are currently used to identify additional (rare) genetic variants. In rare cases,  is also inherited as a monogenetic disease. Moreover, there likely is significant interaction between genes and environmental factors which can only be unraveled if both, genes and the environment are simultaneously considered. Interestingly, the information provided by genetic risk factors for  is unable to predict the clinical course of . New GWAS therefore focus on  prognosis and first insights have already been made. The gastrointestinal tract harbors a huge number of microorganisms (microbiota). It remains an enormous challenge for the immune system to contain this bacterial load while enabling the host to benefit from the many essential contributions of the microbiota. In , the microbiota is altered to a dysfunctional (dysbiotic) state showing reduced diversity and a higher amount of potential pathogenic Proteobacteriae, such as Escherichia coli. In , the microbiota is also more dynamic in its composition over time compared to health. Further,  dysbiosis is more pronounced in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis. In animal experiments, dysbiosis could be transferred by fecal microbiota transplantation from one mouse to another, triggering inflammation in the recipient. In contrast, a healthy microbiota can downregulate the immune response of the host, for instance by bacterial short chain fatty  (SCFA) synthesis. In addition, some bacteria with close physical contact to the intestinal wall also have specific immunosuppressive properties. So far, the highly complex network of microbiota, genetics, immune system and environment is only partially understood. The microbiota is a potential therapeutic target which up to now can only be non-specifically influenced by antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics or fecal microbiota transplantation. A better understanding of the microbiota will likely yield in the discovery of new therapeutic options in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524414>Inhibitory Effect of Ursodeoxycholic  on  Germination Is Insufficient to Prevent Colitis: A Study in Hamsters and Humans.</a></h2><p> Bile  (BA) influence germination and growth of . Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), a BA minor in human, used for cholestatic liver diseases, inhibits germination and growth of , but was never tested  with an infectious challenge versus control.

Then, we challenged with spores of  at D6 hamsters treated with UDCA (50 mg/kg/day) from D1 to D13, versus control. In human, we analyzed the database of a cohort on CDI in acute flares of inflammatory bowel disease (). As PSC- patients were under UDCA treatment, we compared PSC- patients to  patients without PSC.  , UDCA inhibited germination and growth of  at 0.05 and 0.1%, competing with 0.1% TCA (with 0.1%: 0.05% ± 0.05% colony forming unit versus 100% ± 0%,  < 0.0001). In hamsters, UDCA reached high levels only when administered with antibiotics (43.5% UDCA at D5). Without antibiotics, UDCA was in small amount in feces (max. 4.28%), probably because of UDCA transformation into LCA by gut microbiota. During infectious challenge, mortality was similar in animals treated or not with UDCA (62.5%,  = 5/8,  = 0.78). UDCA percentage was high, similar and with the same kinetics in dead and surviving hamsters. However, dead hamsters had a higher ratio of primary over secondary BA compared to surviving hamsters. 9% ( = 41/404) of  patients without PSC had a CDI, versus 25% ( = 4/12) of PSC- patients treated with UDCA.  We confirmed the inhibitory effect of UDCA on growth and germination of , with 0.05 or 0.1% UDCA.

Intestinal permeability maintains the circulation of minerals and nutrients from digested foods. Life and all the metabolic processes depend either directly or indirectly on proper functioning of GI tract. Compromised intestinal permeability and related disorders are common among all the patients with inflammatory bowel disease (), which is a collective term of inflammatory diseases including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Many synthetic drugs are currently in use to treat  such as 5-aminosalicylic  corticosteroids. However, they all have some drawbacks as long-term use result in many complications. These problems encourage us to look out for alternative medicine. Numerous in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that the plant-derived secondary metabolites including phenolic compounds, glucosinolates, alkaloids, terpenoids, oligosaccharides, and quinones could reduce permeability, ameliorate-related dysfunctions with promising results. In addition, many of them could modulate enzymatic activity, suppress the inflammatory transcriptional factors, ease oxidative stress, and reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion.

Despite extensive clinical use, the exact pharmacological mechanism underlying the anti-colitic effects of 5-ASA has not yet been elucidated. A potential molecular mechanism underlying 5-ASA-mediated anti-colitic activity was investigated.An anti-inflammatory pharmacology of 5-ASA was scrutinized in human colon carcinoma cells and murine macrophages and in a TNBS-induced rat colitis model.5-ASA induced phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its substrate acetyl-CoA carboxylase in cells. 5-ASA activation of AMPK occurred regardless of the presence of the pro-inflammatory mediators, Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-α) and lipopolysaccharide. 5-ASA inhibits TNF-α-dependent Nuclear Factor-Kappa B (NF-κB) activation, which was dampened by AMPK inhibition. Oral gavage of sulfasalazine (a colon-specific prodrug of 5- ASA) or rectal administration of 5-ASA ameliorated 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS)- induced rat colitis and activated AMPK in the inflamed colonic tissues while markedly diminishing the levels of NF-κB-regulated pro-inflammatory mediators cyclooxygenase-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-3, elevated by the induction of inflammation. Rectal co-administration of 5-ASA and an AMPK inhibitor undermined 5-ASA-mediated activation of AMPK and its anti-colitic effects.These findings suggest that the activation of AMPK is involved in 5-ASA-mediated anticolitic effects at least partly via interference with pro-inflammatory NF-κB signaling.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31249397>Microbial genes and pathways in inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Perturbations in the intestinal microbiome are implicated in inflammatory bowel disease ().

Substantial evidence connects decreased levels of F. prausnitzii with the onset and progression of certain forms of inflammatory bowel disease, which has been attributed to its anti-inflammatory potential. Two phylogroups of F. prausnitzii have been identified, with a decrease in phylogroup I being a more sensitive marker of intestinal inflammation.

Little analysis of F. prausnitzii genomes has been performed so far and genetic differences between phylogroups I and II are poorly understood.In this study we sequenced 11 additional F. prausnitzii genomes and performed comparative genomics to investigate intraspecies diversity, functional gene complement and the mobilome of 31 high-quality draft and complete genomes. We reveal a very low level of average nucleotide identity among F. prausnitzii genomes and a high level of genome plasticity. Two genomogroups can be separated based on differences in functional gene complement, albeit that this division does not fully agree with separation based on conserved gene phylogeny, highlighting the importance of horizontal gene transfer in shaping F. prausnitzii genomes.

Initially termed the "gut-brain axis" it is now renamed the "microbiota-gut-brain axis" considering the pivotal role of gut microbiota in maintaining local and systemic homeostasis. Different cellular and molecular pathways act along this axis and strong attention is paid to neuroactive molecules (neurotransmitters, i.e., noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin, gamma aminobutyric  and glutamate and metabolites, i.e., tryptophan metabolites), sustaining a possible interkingdom communication system between eukaryota and prokaryota.

Using a Connectivity Map (CMAP) approach, we identified an inverse-correlation between an exemplar EPHX2 inhibitor (EPHX2i) compound response and an inflammatory bowel disease patient-derived signature. To validate the gene-disease link, we tested a pre-clinical tool EPHX2i (GSK1910364) in a mouse disease model, where it showed improved outcomes comparable to or better than the positive control Cyclosporin A. Up-regulation of cytoprotective genes and down-regulation of proinflammatory cytokine production were observed in colon samples obtained from EPHX2i-treated mice. Follow-up immunohistochemistry analysis verified the presence of EPHX2 protein in infiltrated immune cells from Crohn's patient tissue biopsies. We further demonstrated that GSK2256294, a clinical EPHX2i, reduced the production of IL2, IL12p70, IL10 and TNFα in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patient-derived explant cultures. Interestingly, GSK2256294 reduced IL4 and IFNγ in ulcerative colitis, and IL1β in Crohn's disease specifically, suggesting potential differential effects of GSK2256294 in these two diseases.

PSC is a chronic cholestatic liver disorder for which there is no established medical therapy. Preclinical data suggest curcumin may have a beneficial effect in PSC.  Subjects with PSC and a serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP) greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) received curcumin 750 mg orally twice daily for 12 weeks in an open-label pilot study. The primary composite endpoint was proportion of subjects who had a reduction of SAP to less than 1.5 times ULN or a 40% reduction in SAP between baseline and week 12. Secondary endpoints included changes in serum aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, Mayo PSC risk score and self-reported health questionnaires.  Two-hundred and fifty-eight patients with PSC were screened and 15 subjects were enrolled and all completed 12 weeks of therapy. The most common reason for subject exclusion was SAP less than 1.5 times the ULN ( = 98). Curcumin did not result in a significant median (interquartile range) change in SAP times the ULN [3.43 (2.10-4.32) to 2.46 (1.89-4.41),  = .36], and only 20% (3/15) subjects achieved the primary endpoint. Similarly, there was no significant change in the secondary endpoints. There were no serious adverse events reported.  While curcumin was well tolerated, it was not associated with significant improvements in cholestasis or symptoms. Moreover, this study also illustrates that a low SAP is common among those with PSC.

Ascl2 (achaete-scute complex homologue 2), identified as a homologue of the Drosophila achaete-scute gene, has been shown to play an essential for the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and cancers. However, whether it is associated with the pathogenesis of  remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that Ascl2 was greatly down-regulated in human  and experimental colitis. Interestingly, CD4 T cell expression of Ascl2 was regulated by intestinal microbiota. Moreover, we revealed that Ascl2 inhibited the differentiation of Th17 cells and restrained their pathogenicity through facilitating IL-10 production. We further showed that Blimp-1 might be involved in the Ascl2-inducing IL-10 expression in CD4 T cells under Th17 differentiating condition. Notably, lentivirus-mediated overexpression of Ascl2 remarkably alleviated the severity of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  solution (TNBS)-induced colitis in mice, with decreased level of colonic IL-17A. Our findings demonstrated an unappreciated mechanism whereby Ascl2 negatively modulates pathogenic Th17 cell differentiation via promoting IL-10 production, and alleviates intestinal inflammation.

There are growing interests in using whole-food-based strategies to prevent colonic inflammation via potential synergistic interactions among different components within the whole foods. However, limited research is focused on the inhibitory effects of the whole P. eryngii mushroom against inflammatory bowel disease ().The protective effects of P. eryngii mushroom against  are determined in the dextran-sodium-sulfate-induced colitis model in mice. Dietary administration of P. eryngii (1 and 3% w/w) alleviates colonic inflammation, which is evidenced by decreased disease index, increased colon length, and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines in the colonic mucosa. Sequencing the 16S rRNA genes of fecal microbiota demonstrates that P. eryngii mushroom significantly alters the structure of microbiota and partially reverses the shifts of fecal microbiota induced by DSS treatment. The levels of SCFAs in the cecum are increased by P. eryngii mushroom.Overall, the results demonstrate the anti-inflammatory and microbiota-modulating effects of P. eryngii mushroom as a whole-food-based ingredient against , and its potential as a prebiotic agent to prevent inflammation-related disorders in humans.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This updated Cochrane review summarizes current evidence on the use of 5-ASA formulations for maintenance of surgically-induced remission in CD.To assess the efficacy and safety of 5-ASA agents for the maintenance of surgically-induced remission in CD.We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, the Cochrane  Group Specialized Register from inception to 16 July 2018. We also searched references, conference abstracts, and trials registers.Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that included participants with CD in remission following surgery and compared 5-ASAs to no treatment, placebo or any other active intervention with duration of at least three months were considered for inclusion.We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcome was clinical relapse. Secondary outcomes included endoscopic recurrence, radiologic and surgical relapse, adverse events, serious adverse events and withdrawal due to adverse events.Fourteen RCTs (1867 participants) were included in the review. Participants (15 to 70 years) were recruited from gastroenterology hospitals and medical clinics in Europe and North America and followed up between 3 and 72 months. The risk of bias was assessed as 'low' in one study, 'unclear' in seven and as 'high' in six.At 12 months, 36% (20/55) of participants in the 5-ASA group experienced clinical relapse compared to 51% (28/55) in the no treatment control group (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.10; low certainty evidence). Moderate certainty evidence suggests that 5-ASAs are more effective for preventing clinical relapse than placebo. During a follow-up period of 12 to 72 months, 36% (131/361) of 5-ASA participants relapsed compared to 43% (160/369) of placebo participants (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.96; I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence). At 12 months, 17% (17/101) of the 4 g/day mesalamine group relapsed compared to 26% (27/105) of the 2.4 g/day group (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.13; moderate certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in clinical relapse rates when 5-ASA compounds were compared to purine antimetabolites. At 24 months, 61% (103/170) of mesalamine participants relapsed compared to 67% (119/177) of azathioprine participants (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.07; I² = 28%; low certainty evidence). During 24 months, 50% (9/18) of 5-ASA participants had clinical relapse compared to 13% (2/16) of adalimumab participants (RR 4.0, 95% CI 1.01 to 15.84; low certainty evidence). The effects of sulphasalazine compared to placebo on clinical relapse rate is uncertain. After 18 to 36 months, 66% (95/143) of participants treated with sulphasalazine relapsed compared to 71% (110/155) in the placebo group (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.38; I² = 38%; low certainty evidence).The effect of 5-ASA drugs on safety was uncertain. During 24 months follow-up, 4% (2/55) of 5-ASA participants experienced adverse events compared to none (0/55) in the no treatment control group (RR 5.00, 95% CI 0.25 to 101.81; very low certainty evidence). An equal proportion of 5-ASA participants (10%; 23/241) and placebo (9%; 20/225) groups experienced an adverse event during a follow-up of 3 to 72 months (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.91; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence). Adverse event rates were similar in the 5-ASA and purine analogues groups. However, serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events were more common in participants who received purine analogues than 5-ASA. At 52 weeks to 24 months, 52% (107/207) of 5-ASA participants had an adverse event compared to 47% (102/218) of purine analogue participants (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.27, I² = 0%; low certainty evidence). Four per cent (6/152) of 5-ASA participants had a serious adverse event compared to 17% (27/159) of purine analogue participants (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.80; very low certainty evidence). Eight per cent (17/207) of 5-ASA participants withdrew due to an adverse event compared to 19% (42/218) of purine analogue participants (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.83; low certainty evidence). Adverse event rates were similar in high and low dose mesalamine participants. After 12 months, 2% (2/101) of 4 g/day mesalamine participants had an adverse event compared to 2% (2/105) of 2.4 g/day participants (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.15 to 7.24; low certainty evidence). The proportion of participants who experienced adverse events over a 24 month follow-up in the mesalamine group was 78% (14/18) compared to 69% (11/16) of adalimumab participants (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.71; very low certainty evidence). None (0/32) of the sulphasalazine participants had an adverse event at 18 months follow-up compared to 3% (1/34) of the placebo group (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.38; very low certainty evidence). Commonly reported adverse events in the included studies were diarrhoea, nausea, increased liver function tests, pancreatitis, and abdominal pain.5-ASA preparations are superior to placebo for the maintenance of surgically-induced clinical remission in patients with CD (moderate certainty). The number needed to treat to prevent one relapse was 13 patients. The evidence for endoscopic remission is uncertain. The sulphasalazine class of 5-ASA agents failed to demonstrate superiority against placebo, 5-ASAs failed to demonstrate superiority compared to no treatment (very low and low certainty). The efficacy of two different doses of the same 5-ASA and the efficacy of 5-ASA compared to purine antimetabolites (azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine) in maintaining surgically-induced remission of CD remains unclear. However, purine analogues lead to more serious adverse events and discontinuation due to adverse events. There is a low certainty that 5-ASA is inferior for maintaining surgically-induced remission of CD compared to biologics (anti TNF-ɑ). 5-ASA formulations appear to be safe with no difference in the occurrence of adverse events or withdrawal when compared with placebo, no treatment or biologics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135224>Dietary  Fruit Attenuates Colitis-Associated Tumorigenesis: A Pivotal Role of the NF-κB/IL-6/JAK1/STAT3 Pathway.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease () including ulcerative colitis (UC) is one of the risk factors for the development of colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC). CAC is a type of colorectal cancer (CRC), the third leading cause of cancer death.  (ZJ) fruit contains bioactive components such as polysaccharides, triterpenoid , and flavonoids, and it has shown anti-inflammatory property. The aim of the study was to investigate the protective effect of dietary ZJ on colitis-associated colorectal tumorigenesis in mice. Mice ( = 42, two sets) were injected with azoxymethane (AOM) followed by three cycles of 2% (w/v) dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water to induce CAC. Simultaneously, those mice were fed with ZJ diet for 70 days (5% or 10% w/w). Data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by LSD Bonferroni test. Dietary ZJ decreased fecal blood, diarrhea, disease activity index (DAI), spleen weight ( < 0.001), and the number of tumors ( < 0.001). In addition, dietary ZJ increased colon length ( < 0.001) and suppressed the activation of NF-кB/IL-6/JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway. In conclusion, we suggest that dietary ZJ attenuates inflammation by interfering NF-κB/IL-6/JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway, thereby inhibits AOM/DSS-induced colon tumorigenesis in mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30963247>Impact and risk factors of non-adherence to 5-aminosalicylates in quiescent ulcerative colitis evaluated by an electronic management system.</a></h2><p>To determine the impact of non-adherence to 5-Aminosalicylates (5-ASA) on the risk of flares and to identify risk factors of non-adherence.Observational, cohort study of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients in clinical remission at least 6 months on 5-ASA monotherapy maintenance prescribed by an electronic management program. Adherence was considered when 80% of the prescribed 5-ASA had been dispensed at the pharmacy. The study analyzed the existence and degree of 5-ASA adherence, disease course, UC phenotypic expression, and 5-ASA dose and regimen, and consumption of non-UC chronic drugs during 2-year follow-up.The study included 274 patients, 49% males with a median age of 38 (27-49) years old. Overall, 41% of patients were non-adherent to 5-ASA. Risk of flares was reduced in the adherent group (36% vs 54%; OR = 0,484; p = 0,004), mainly the mild ones (26% vs 38%; OR = 0,559; p = 0,031). Non-adherence was associated with younger age at diagnosis (32 (26-45) vs 41.5 (21-50), p = 0.000) and no-consumption of other chronic treatments (1.1 vs 2.1; OR = 1709; p = 0,048).Non-adherence to 5-ASA evaluated by the pharmaceutical management system was at 41% with a higher risk of relapse.

Nanoparticles (NPs) formulated were of average size of 200-287 nm. INF loading of NPs (INF-NPs) resulted in an increase in size and zeta potential. No cytotoxicity was observed for any of the NPs. Cellular interaction and uptake of PU NPs were similar compared with polycaprolactone (PCL) NPs and significantly higher to Poly(lactic-co-glycolic)  (PLGA) NPs. Cellular interaction was higher for corresponding PEG-NPs. INF-PU and INF-PU-PEG NPs showed a rapid rate and extent of recovery of the epithelial barrier function in inflamed Caco-2 cell monolayers and decreased cytokine levels in inflamed monocytes. Results obtained in this study are promising and the potential of PU and PU-PEG NPs for drug delivery and targeting to treat gastrointestinal inflammation warrants further investigation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The triggers that initiate and perpetuate this continuous inflammation are the subject of much speculation and research, although the central role of the intestinal microbiota is recognized, and is even a target for treatment in some circumstances. The mainstay of modern  treatment is suppression of the immune response towards as yet unspecified antigens, and conventional therapy includes corticosteroids, 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA), thiopurines and methotrexate. Reducing activity of specific mediators has proven efficacious, including adhesion molecules, such as the gut-homing integrin α β expressed on the surface of circulating immune cells, and cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α). This has been achieved using biologic agents including monoclonal antibodies. Recent discoveries in immunology and neuroscience have revealed that signals in the peripheral nervous system regulate inflammation, including levels of TNF-α. The understanding of the mechanisms of the neuro-immune communication involved in inflammation control in the gut is evolving, but is as yet incomplete. Clinical studies using implanted vagus nerve stimulators for treatment of  show encouraging results.

The effect of pre- and probiotic combination has been less studied in . Using genomic and proteomic array technologies, this study examined the efficacy of a new combination of natural alternatives: prebiotics (grape pomace extract, GP) and probiotics (lactobacilli mixture, Lb mix) on inflammation and intracellular signalling routes in a cellular model of inflammation. Caco-2 cells challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 4 h were treated with GP extract (50 μg/ml gallic  equivalent) and Lb combination (3 × 108 colony-forming units/ml total Lb) for 24 h. The profile expressions of forty key inflammatory markers and twenty-six signalling kinases were analysed. Other markers involved in inflammation were also investigated (NF-κB/RELA, Nrf2, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, Cyp1A1, Cyp1B1); 57·5 and 60 % of investigated genes and proteins, respectively, were down-regulated by the synbiotic combination. Relevant cytokines and chemokines involved in response to microbial infection and inflammation were reduced under the level induced by LPS treatment and toward the unchallenged control. As expected, the reduction effect seems to imply mitogen-activated protein kinase and NF-κB pathway. Most of the signalling molecules activated by LPS were decreased by GP extract and Lb mix. Our study indicates that the synbiotic combination of GP extract and Lactobacillus sp. mixture exerted anti-inflammatory properties, which are able to decrease the majority of inflammatory genes, their proteins and associated signalling markers. Due to protective role of GP compounds on lactobacilli probiotic, this synbiotic combination might serve as a promising adjunctive therapy in intestinal inflammations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894816>Sishen Wan Ameliorated Trinitrobenzene-Sulfonic--Induced Chronic Colitis  NEMO/NLK Signaling Pathway.</a></h2><p>The nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathway plays an important role in the initialization and development phase of inflammatory injuries, including inflammatory bowel disease (). Sishen Wan (SSW) is a classic Chinese patent medicine listed in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, which is usually used to treat chronic colitis; however, it is unclear whether SSW can treat   the NF-κB signaling pathway. In the present study, the therapeutic effect of SSW was demonstrated by the decreased index of colonic weight, macroscopic and microscopic score, and pathological observation in chronic colitis induced by trinitrobenzene sulfonic . In colonic mucosa of rats with chronic colitis, SSW reduced the levels of calprotectin and eliminated oxidative lesions; downregulated expression of interferon-γ, interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-17; increased expression of IL-4; and suppressed expression of NF-κB p65, and NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO)-like kinase (NLK). Furthermore, SSW inhibited ubiquitinated NEMO, ubiquitin-activated enzyme, and E2i activation, and phosphorylation of downstream proteins (cylindromatosis protein, transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase and P38).

In IL-10mice, various experimental regimens including piroxicam, 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS) or dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), respectively were used for promoting colitis; colitis was induced with DSS in FVB mice. Using clinical and small animal ultrasound scanners, evolution of inflammation in proximal, middle and distal colon, was monitored with USMI by using MB at multiple time points. Imaged colon segments were analyzed  for inflammatory changes on H&E staining and for P-selectin expression on immunofluorescence staining. : Sustained colitis was not detected with USMI in IL-10 or FVB mice with various experimental regimens. USMI signals either gradually decreased after the colitis enhancing/inducing drug/agents were discontinued, or the mortality rate of mice was high. Inflammation was observed on H&E staining in IL-10 mice with piroxicam promotion, while stable overexpression of P-selectin was not found on immunofluorescence staining in the same mice. : Sustained colitis in IL-10 mice induced with piroxicam, TNBS or DSS, and in FVB mice induced with DSS, was not detected with USMI using MB, and this was verified by immunofluorescence staining for inflammation marker P-selectin.

Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome is increasingly considered to be causatively related to  and is strongly affected by components of a Western life style. Bacteria that ferment fibers and produce short chain fatty  (SCFAs) are typically reduced in mucosa and feces of patients with , as compared to healthy individuals. SCFAs, such as acetate, propionate and butyrate, are important metabolites in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Several studies have indeed shown that fecal SCFAs levels are reduced in active . SCFAs are an important fuel for intestinal epithelial cells and are known to strengthen the gut barrier function. Recent findings, however, show that SCFAs, and in particular butyrate, also have important immunomodulatory functions. Absorption of SCFAs is facilitated by substrate transporters like MCT1 and SMCT1 to promote cellular metabolism. Moreover, SCFAs may signal through cell surface G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), like GPR41, GPR43, and GPR109A, to activate signaling cascades that control immune functions. Transgenic mouse models support the key role of these GPCRs in controlling intestinal inflammation.

The non-persistence rate and associated reasons were determined in patients who initiated therapy between 2010 and 2012.A total of 131,158 patients with UC and 57,286 with CD were identified. Of these 1747 UC (1.3%) and 3731 (6.5%) CD patients had received anti-TNFα therapy and were included in the analysis. Infliximab was prescribed more frequently than adalimumab (84.6% vs 15.4% in UC and 80.7% vs 19.4% in CD); 81.0% of UC and 72.0% of CD patients received anti-TNFα alone or in combination with 5-aminosalicylic .

Characterization of the virus is important for its control and eradication. The circulating IBDVs are classified on the basis of their antigenic and pathogenic properties. The virus is categorised as classical, variant and very virulent IBDV (vvIBDV). IBDV is a non-envelop, icosahedral double stranded virus. Viral protein 2 (VP2) is the major structural protein of capsid that determines the host-pathogen relationship. The aim of this study was to characterise the  virus of Pak-Asian region.IBDV suspected flocks were examined in Punjab, Pakistan from 2014-2018. Two hundred and fifty samples were collected with complete history of the disease. The suspected samples were collected from broiler, layer and rural poultry farms. RNA was extracted and hyper-variable region of VP2 gene was amplified using specific primers. Nucleotide sequence of the VP2 gene was determined and its Amino  sequence was deduced. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis was also performed.The current classifications based in a hyper-variable region of the capsid protein VP2 (hvVP2), classification of IBDVs is split into newly proposed geno-groups according to Jackwood group.

The APLAID patients presented with early-onset blistering skin lesions, posterior uveitis, inflammatory bowel disease () and recurrent sinopulmonary infections caused by a humoral defect, but lacked circulating autoantibodies and had no cold-induced urticaria, contrary to the patients with the related PLAID syndrome.  We describe a new APLAID patient who presented with vesiculopustular rash in the 1st weeks of life, followed by , posterior uveitis, recurrent chest infections, interstitial pneumonitis, and also had sensorineural deafness and cutis laxa. Her disease has been refractory to most treatments, including IL1 blockers and a trial with ruxolitinib has been attempted.  In this patient, we found a unique  heterozygous missense L848P mutation in the  gene, predicted to affect the PLCγ2 structure. Similarly to S707Y, the L848P mutation led to the increased basal and EGF-stimulated PLCγ2 activity . Whole blood assays showed reduced production of IFN-γ and IL-17 in response to polyclonal T-cell stimulation and reduced production of IL-10 and IL-1β after LPS stimulation. Reduced IL-1β levels and the lack of clinical response to treatment with IL-1 blockers argue against NLRP3 inflammasome hyperactivation being the main mechanism mediating the APLAID pathogenesis.  Our findings indicate that L848P is novel a gain-of-function mutation that leads to PLCγ2 activation and suggest cutis laxa as a possible clinical manifestations of the APLAID syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31549280>VPR-254: an inhibitor of ROR-gamma T with potential utility for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Retinoic  Related Orphan Nuclear Receptor gamma T (RORγT) is a lineage specifying transcription factor for IL-17 expressing cells, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (). VPR-254 is a selective in vitro inhibitor of RORγT.The main goals of our study were twofold: (1) To determine if ex vivo treatment with VPR-254 reduced relevant cytokine (IL-17 and IL-21) secretion from colonic strips of mice with colitis; (2) To determine if treatment of mice with VPR-254 attenuated parameters of colitis, using three murine  models.VPR-254 was evaluated ex vivo in a colonic strip assay, using tissue from mice with Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. In vivo, VPR-254 was evaluated for efficacy in DSS, Trintirobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS) and Anti-CD40 antibody-induced murine models of colitis.VPR-254 reduced the production of key pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-17) in ex vivo and in vivo models of colitis.

Thus, in the current study, the influence of cyanocobalamin (CNCBL) or methylcobalamin (MECBL) ingestion on  symptoms will be investigated. Then, whether and how the application of various cobalamins would modify the taxonomic and functional composition of the gut microbiome in mice will be examined carefully. Dextran-sulfate-sodium-induced  mice were treated with MECBL or CNCBL; disease activity index (DAI) scores and intestinal inflammatory conditions of mice were evaluated. Fecal samples were collected; microbiota composition was determined with a 16s rRNA analysis; functional profiles were predicted by phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt); and short-chain fatty  were measured. The consequence of higher relative abundances of Enterobacteriaceae and isomeric short-chain fatty  by cobalamin treatment revealed that a high concentration of CNCBL but not MECBL supplementation obviously aggravated . A microbial ecosystem rich in Escherichia/ Shigella and low in Lactobacillus, Blautia, and Clostridium XVIII was observed in  mice after a high concentration of CNCBL supplementation. In cobalamin-dependent enzymes, CNCBL was more efficient in the adenosylcobalamin system than MECBL and vice versa in the MECBL system. The distinct effects of various cobalamins were associated with the distribution and efficiency of vitamin-B-dependent riboswitches. CNCBL had a strong inhibitory effect on all riboswitches, especially on btuB and pocR riboswitches from Enterobacteriaceae. CNCBL aggravated  via enhancing the proportion of Enterobacteriaceae organisms through riboswitch and enzyme systems.

In this study we aimed to investigate the dietary preferences of  patients, and to explore the interactions among gut microbiota composition, dietary components, and metabolites in relation to .Dietary preferences of  patients (including those with ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD]) and health controls were investigated, and their gut microbiota were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomic analyses of fecal and biopsy samples. The metabolite profiles of the samples were then analyzed using gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses.The daily intake of folic , niacin, vitamins C and D, calcium, and selenium differed significantly between patients with  and healthy controls. A decrease in long-chain (such as arachidic, and oleic ) and medium-chain fatty  (sebacic  and isocaproic ) as well as bile  was observed in patients with . Compared with healthy controls, 22 microbial species (including Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, and Clostridium clostridioforme CAG132) in the UC group and 37 microbial species (such as Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium nucleatum) in the CD group were found to be correlated to diet and metabolites.

We sought to investigate serum fatty  composition in CD, and associations of fatty  with disease activity, cytokines, and adipokines. Serum was prospectively collected from 116 CD subjects and 27 non- controls. Clinical disease activity was assessed by the Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI). Serum fatty  were measured by gas chromatography. Serum cytokines and adipokines were measured by Luminex assay. Dietary histories were obtained from a subset of patients. Nine serum cytokines and adipokines were increased in CD versus controls. CD subjects had increased percentage serum monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA), dihomo-gamma linolenic  (DGLA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosapentaenoic  (DPA), and oleic , but decreased arachidonic  (AA) versus controls. The % total n-3 fatty  and % EPA directly correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and HBI, whereas the % total n-6 fatty  were inversely correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and HBI. CD subjects had increased caloric intake versus controls, but no alterations in total fat or PUFA intake. We found differences in serum fatty , most notably PUFA, in CD that correlated both with clinical disease activity and inflammatory cytokines.

Succinate is also produced in large amounts during bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber. Elevated succinate levels within the gut lumen have been reported in association with microbiome disturbances (dysbiosis), as well as in patients with inflammatory bowel disease () and animal models of intestinal inflammation. Recent studies indicate that succinate can activate immune cells via its specific surface receptor, succinate receptor 1(SUCNR1), and enhance inflammation. However, the role of succinate in inflammatory processes within the gut mucosal immune system is unclear.

Phytochemical evaluation of  yielded prenylated toluhydroquinones and toluquinones, from which semi-synthetic analogs were derived, and a carotenoid metabolite. The bioactivities of  fractions, natural products, and semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated using various in vitro assays.  Sargahydroquinoic  isolated from  was converted to several structural derivatives by semi-synthetic modification. Potential modulation of  by  crude fractions, natural compounds, and sargahydroquinoic  analogs was evaluated through in vitro anti-inflammatory activity, anti-oxidant activity, cytotoxicity against HT-29 and Caco-2 colorectal cancer cells, and PPAR-γ activation.  Sargahydroquinoic  acts on various therapeutic targets relevant to  treatment.  Conversion of sargahydroquinoic  to sarganaphthoquinoic  increases peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) activity, compromises anti-oxidant activity, and has no effect on cytotoxicity against the tested cell lines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599507>Ethnic Variations in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Among Israel's Populations.</a></h2><p>Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the two major classic presentations of inflammatory bowel diseases ().

Alcohol consumption was found in both groups, but Arabs smoked more (46% vs. 12%, respectively, P < 0.05). Obstructive phenotype was lower in Arabs (10% vs. 32%, P < 0.05). 5-aminosalicylic  and anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha were prescribed for the Arab and Ashkenazi groups (89% and 21%, respectively). The need for surgical intervention due to disease severity and/or complications was not significant (22% vs. 24%).Despite similar reports of NOD2/CARD15 mutations, Crohn's disease is more common than ulcerative colitis within the Arab-Israeli population.

They represent an increasing public health concern and an aetiological enigma due to unknown causal factors. The current knowledge on the pathogenesis of  is that genetically susceptible individuals develop intolerance to a dysregulated gut microflora (dysbiosis) and chronic inflammation develops as a result of environmental triggers. Among the environmental factors associated with , diet plays an important role in modulating the gut microbiome, and, consequently, it could have a therapeutic impact on the disease course. An overabundance of calories and some macronutrients typical of the Western dietetic pattern increase gut inflammation, whereas several micronutrients characteristic of the Mediterranean Diet have the potential to modulate gut inflammation, according to recent evidence. Immunonutrition has emerged as a new concept putting forward the role of vitamins such as vitamins A, C, E, and D, folic , beta carotene and trace elements such as zinc, selenium, manganese and iron. However, when assessed in clinical trials, specific micronutrients showed a limited benefit. Further research is required to evaluate the role of individual food compounds and complex nutritional interventions with the potential to decrease inflammation as a means of prevention and management of . The current dietary recommendations for disease prevention and management are scarce and non evidence-based. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the complex interaction between diet, microbiome and immune-modulation in , with particular focus to the role of the Mediterranean Diet as a tool for prevention and treatment of the disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30623320>TGR5 Protects Against Colitis in Mice, but Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy Increases Colitis Severity.</a></h2><p>Bariatric surgery, such as vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG), is the most effective long-term treatment for obesity. However, there are conflicting reports on the effect of bariatric surgery on inflammatory bowel disease (). Bariatric surgery increases bile  concentrations, which can decrease inflammation by signaling through the bile  receptor, TGR5. TGR5 signaling protects against chemically induced colitis in mice. VSG increases circulating bile  concentrations to increase TGR5 signaling, which contributes to improved metabolic regulation after VSG. Therefore, we investigated the effect of VSG on chemically induced colitis development and the role of TGR5 in this context.VSG or sham surgery was performed in high fat diet-fed male Tgr5 and Tgr5 littermates. Sham-operated mice were food restricted to match their body weight to VSG-operated mice. Colitis was induced with 2.5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in water post-operatively. Body weight, energy intake, fecal scoring, colon histopathology, colonic markers of inflammation, goblet cell counts, and colonic microRNA-21 levels were assessed.VSG decreased body weight independently of genotype. Consistent with previous work, genetic ablation of TGR5 increased the severity of DSS-induced colitis. Notably, despite the effect of VSG to decrease body weight and increase TGR5 signaling, VSG increased the severity of DSS-induced colitis. VSG-induced increases in colitis were associated with increased colonic expression of TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1, and microRNA-21.While our data demonstrate that TGR5 protects against colitis, they also demonstrate that VSG potentiates chemically induced colitis in mice. These data suggest that individuals undergoing VSG may be at increased risk for developing colitis; however, further study is needed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30683828>High activity of the endogenous opioid system and acute but not chronic stress influence experimental colitis development in mice.</a></h2><p>Exposition to environmental factors is one of the major underlying causes in inflammatory bowel diseases (), with several endogenous systems involved. Our aim was to characterize the impact of stress on the colitis development in relation to the endogenous opioid system (EOS) activity in mice. A unique mouse model of high and low activity of EOS (namely high (HA)/low (LA) stress-induced analgesia) was employed. Mice were bred using bidirectional selection and classified as HA or LA line based on the measurement of analgesia. Colitis was induced by instillation of trinitrobenzenesulfonic  in 30% EtOH/0.9% NaCl. After 4 days, the macroscopic score was assessed and samples for molecular and histological studies were collected. To evaluate the influence of stress on colitis development, chronic mild stress (exposure to stress stimuli for 2 and 5 weeks) and acute stress (short restraint over 3 days) were applied before colitis induction. We observed a difference in the colitis development between non-stressed HA and LA mice, as indicated by macroscopic and ulcer scores. Acute stress improved colitis in HA mice but did not change the inflammation score in LA line as compared to respective non-stressed mice. Chronic mild stress had no influence on colitis in either of mouse lines. Our study supports the hypothesis that the activity of EOS may be crucial in  development. We also evidence that acute, but not chronic stress influenced  exacerbation, depending on EOS function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31145706>Enteric hyperoxaluria: role of microbiota and antibiotics.</a></h2><p>Enteric hyperoxaluria is commonly observed in malabsorptive conditions including Roux en Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and inflammatory bowel diseases (). Its incidence is increasing secondary to an increased prevalence of both disorders. In this review, we summarize the evidence linking the gut microbiota to the risk of enteric hyperoxaluria.In enteric hyperoxaluria, fat malabsorption leads to increased binding of calcium to free fatty  resulting in more soluble oxalate in the intestinal lumen. Bile  and free fatty  in the lumen also cause increased gut permeability allowing more passive absorption of oxalate. In recent years, there is more interest in the role of the gut microbiota in modulating urinary oxalate excretion in enteric hyperoxaluria, stemming from our knowledge that microbiota in the intestines can degrade oxalate. Oxalobacter formigenes reduced urinary oxalate in animal models of RYGB. The contribution of other oxalate-degrading organisms and the microbiota community to the pathophysiology of enteric hyperoxaluria are also currently under investigation.Gut microbiota might play a role in modulating the risk of enteric hyperoxaluria through oxalate degradation and bile  metabolism. O. formigenes is a promising therapeutic target in this population; however, further studies in humans are needed to test its effectiveness.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31593809>Evaluation of the therapeutic activity of melatonin and resveratrol in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A longitudinal PET/CT study in an animal model.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory Bowel Disease () is a group of chronic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, which two main types are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Although conventional therapeutic strategies have demonstrated to be effective in the  treatment, it is necessary to incorporate novel therapeutic agents that target other mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the disease, such as oxidative stress. For this reason, the efficacy in vivo of two antioxidant compounds, melatonin and resveratrol, has been investigated in an animal model of TNBS (2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic ) induced colitis. PET/CT (Positron emission tomography/Computer Tomography) scans were performed to assess disease activity and evaluate treatment response. SUV (Standardized Uptake Value) values, body weight changes and histological evaluation were used as inflammatory indices to measure the efficacy of both treatments. SUV values increased rapidly after induction of colitis, but after the beginning of the treatment (day 3) a statistically significant decrease was observed on days 7 and 10 in treated animals compared to the non-treated group. This remission of the disease was also confirmed by histological analysis of the colon tissue using the Nancy histological index (p value < 0.05 for differences between non-treated and both groups of treated animals). Moreover, statistical analysis showed a correlation (R = 65.52%) between SUV values and weight changes throughout the treatment. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of resveratrol, and melatonin in lower extent, as therapeutic agents in the  treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Kefir is a fermented dairy product including yeast and bacterial species. We aimed to investigate the effect of kefir on trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS)-induced colitis in rats using two different doses. Fifty-four Wistar rats were divided into six groups. For 14 days, the normal control and colitis control groups were given tap water, kefir10 control, kefir10 colitis, and kefir30 control, and the kefir30 colitis groups were given phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% or 30% kefir, respectively, instead of tap water. Colitis was induced by intracolonically administrating TNBS in the colitis control, kefir10 colitis, and kefir30 colitis groups. On the 14th day, the rats were sacrificed. The weights and lengths of the colons were measured and macroscopically evaluated, and the distal 10 cm segments were subjected to a histopathological examination. The incidence of bloody stool and diarrhea in the kefir10 colitis group was found to be less than the colitis control and kefir30 colitis groups. The colonic weight/length ratio in the kefir10 colitis group was lower than that in the colitis control and kefir30 colitis groups. We detected that the 10% kefir treatment reduced TNBS-induced macroscopic colonic damage, while it was exacerbated by the 30% kefir treatment.

The assay coverage also includes markers of gut health and inflammation, including citrulline and neopterin. The method was designed in 96-well plate format for application in multiday, multiplate clinical and epidemiology population studies. A chromatographic cycle time of 7 min enables the analysis of two 96-well plates in 24 h. To protect chromatographic column lifespan, samples underwent a two-step extraction, using solvent protein precipitation followed by delipidation via solid-phase extraction (SPE). Analytical validation reported accuracy of each analyte <20% for the lowest limit of quantification and <15% for all other quality control (QC) levels. The analytical precision for each analyte was 2.1-12.9%. To test the applicability of the method to multiplate and multiday preparations, a serum pool underwent periodic repeat analysis during a run consisting of 18 plates.

Inflammatory bowel disease () is an idiopathic inflammatory condition characterized as an autoimmune disorder that includes dysfunctions in the T helper (Th)/T regulatory cell (Treg) balance, which normally plays pivotal roles in immune homeostasis. The aim of this study was to explore the potential of DHA to ameliorate  by restoring the Th/Treg cell balance. To this end, we established mouse models of colitis induced by oxazolone (OXA) and 2,4,6-trinitro-benzene sulfonic  (TNBS). We then treated mice with DHA at 4, 8, or 16 mg/kg/day. DHA treatment ameliorated colitis signs and reduced lymphocyte infiltration and tissue fibrosis. Moreover, DHA decreased the numbers of Th1 and Th17 cells and Th9 and Th22 cells in TNBS- or OXA-induced colitis, respectively, and increased Tregs in both models. DHA (0.8 mg/mL) also inhibited activated CD4+ T lymphocytes, which was accompanied by apoptosis induction. Moreover, it promoted heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) production in vitro and in vivo, concomitant with CD4+ T cell apoptosis and restoration of the Th/Treg balance, and these effects were blocked by treatment with the HO-1 inhibitor Sn-protoporphyrin IX.

It remained largely unknown how antibiotic-induced dysbiosis confers the risk for enhanced inflammatory response. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that SCFAs, their receptors and transporters mediate the antibiotic long-term effects on the functional state of colonic mucosa and susceptibility to the experimental colitis. Male Wistar rats were treated daily for 14 days with antibiotic ceftriaxone (300 mg/kg, i.m.) or vehicle; euthanized by CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation in 1, 14 or 56 days after antibiotic withdrawal. We found increased cecum weight and sustained changes in microbiota composition after ceftriaxone treatment with increased number of conditionally pathogenic enterobacteria, E. coli, Clostridium, Staphylococcus spp. and hemolytic bacteria even at 56 days after antibiotic withdrawal. The concentration of SCFAs was decreased after ceftriaxone withdrawal. We found decreased immunoreactivity of the FFA2, FFA3 receptors, SMCT1 and increased MCT1 & MCT4 transporters of SCFAs in colon mucosa. These changes evoked a significant shift in colonic mucosal homeostasis: the disturbance of oxidant-antioxidant balance; activation of redox-sensitive transcription factor HIF1α and ERK1/2 MAP kinase; increased colonic epithelial permeability and bacterial translocation to blood; morphological remodeling of the colonic tissue.

For effective and safe  treatment, herein a smart nanotherapy (i.e. oxidation-responsive nanoparticles containing a proresolving annexin A1-mimetic peptide Ac2-26, defined as AON) is developed, which can release packaged Ac2-26, in response to highly expressed reactive oxygen species (ROS) at diseased sites. AON effectively protects Ac2-26 from degradation in the enzyme-rich environment of the gastrointestinal tract. By delivering this nanotherapy to the inflamed colons of mice with , site-specific release and accumulation of Ac2-26 in response to high levels of ROS at the inflammatory sites are achieved. Mechanistically, the Ac2-26-containing, oxidation-labile nanotherapy AON effectively decreases the expression of proinflammatory mediators, attenuates trafficking and infiltration of inflammatory cells, promotes efferocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils, and increases phenotypic switching of macrophages. Therapeutically, AON reduces symptoms of inflammation, accelerates intestinal mucosal wound healing, reshapes the gut microbiota composition, and increases short-chain fatty  production. Additionally, oral delivery of this nanomedicine shows excellent safety profile in a mouse model, conferring the confidence for further development of a targeted precision therapy for  and other inflammatory diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680990>Dysbiosis-Associated Enteric Glial Cell Immune-Activation and Redox Imbalance Modulate Tight Junction Protein Expression in Gulf War Illness Pathology.</a></h2><p>About 14% of veterans who suffer from Gulf war illness (GWI) complain of some form of gastrointestinal disorder but with no significant markers of clinical pathology. Our previous studies have shown that exposure to GW chemicals resulted in altered microbiome which was associated with damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP) release followed by neuro and gastrointestinal inflammation with loss of gut barrier integrity. Enteric glial cells (EGC) are emerging as important regulators of the gastrointestinal tract and have been observed to change to a reactive phenotype in several functional gastrointestinal disorders such as IBS and . This study is aimed at investigating the role of dysbiosis associated EGC immune-activation and redox instability in contributing to observed gastrointestinal barrier integrity loss in GWI via altered tight junction protein expression. Using a mouse model of GWI and  studies with cultured EGC and use of antibiotics to ensure gut decontamination we show that exposure to GW chemicals caused dysbiosis associated change in EGCs. EGCs changed to a reactive phenotype characterized by activation of TLR4-S100β/RAGE-iNOS pathway causing release of nitric oxide and activation of NOX2 since gut sterility with antibiotics prevented this change. The resulting peroxynitrite generation led to increased oxidative stress that triggered inflammation as shown by increased NLRP-3 inflammasome activation and increased cell death. Activated EGCs  and  were associated with decrease in tight junction protein occludin and selective water channel aquaporin-3 with a concomitant increase in Claudin-2. The tight junction protein levels were restored following a parallel treatment of GWI mice with a TLR4 inhibitor SsnB and butyric  that are known to decrease the immunoactivation of EGCs. Our study demonstrates that immune-redox mechanisms in EGC are important players in the pathology in GWI and may be possible therapeutic targets for improving outcomes in GWI symptom persistence.Copyright © 2019 Kimono, Sarkar, Albadrani, Seth, Bose, Mondal, Li, Kar, Nagarkatti, Nagarkatti, Sullivan, Janulewicz, Lasley, Horner, Klimas and Chatterjee.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691236>Serum Metabolomics Identifies Altered Bioenergetics, Signaling Cascades in Parallel with Exposome Markers in Crohn's Disease.</a></h2><p> Inflammatory bowel disease () has stimulated much interest due to its surging incidences and health impacts in the U.S. and worldwide. However, the exact cause of  remains incompletely understood, and biomarker is lacking towards early diagnostics and effective therapy assessment. To tackle these, the emerging high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)-based metabolomics shows promise. Here, we conducted a pilot untargeted LC/MS metabolomic profiling in Crohn's disease, for which serum samples of both active and inactive cases were collected, extracted, and profiled by a state-of-the-art compound identification workflow. Results show a distinct metabolic profile of Crohn's from control, with most metabolites downregulated. The identified compounds are structurally diverse, pointing to important pathway perturbations ranging from energy metabolism (e.g., β-oxidation of fatty ) to signaling cascades of lipids (e.g., DHA) and amino  (e.g., L-tryptophan). Importantly, an integral role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease is highlighted. Xenobiotics and their biotransformants were widely detected, calling for massive exposomic profiling for future cohort studies as such. This study endorses the analytical capacity of untargeted metabolomics for biomarker development, cohort stratification, and mechanistic interpretation; the findings might be valuable for advancing biomarker research and etiologic inquiry in .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31254739>Flos Abelmoschus manihot extract attenuates DSS-induced colitis by regulating gut microbiota and Th17/Treg balance.</a></h2><p>Flos Abelmoschus manihot is widely used as traditional drug in China. Abelmoschus manihot (AM) extracted from Flos Abelmoschus manihot that has been applied for treating chronic inflammatory diseases. Here we showed that AM significantly alleviated DSS-induced colitis in mice. AM modified gut microbiota composition, increased microbial diversity, and in particularly, elevated the abundance of short chain fatty  (SCFAs)-producing gut microbiota in colitic mice. Consequently, levels of SCFAs especially butyrate and acetate were increased upon AM treatment, which, primarily through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) pathway, led to the enhanced Treg generation and the suppressed Th17 development. Together, we herein provide the first evidences to support that AM, a natural plant-derived complex, can potentially reset gut microbiome and metabolism, resume immune and tissue homeostasis, and hence prevent colitis, which may provide a new perspective on  pathogenesis and suggest a novel microbiota-targeting therapy for inflammatory gut diseases.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In consequence, PTSO can be a potential candidate for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases.The anti-inflammatory effects of PTSO are studied in two mice models of colitis: 2,4-dinitrobenzene sulfonic  (DNBS) (PTSO doses: 0.01-10 mg kg ) and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) (PTSO doses: 0.01-0.1 mg kg ). The immunomodulatory effects of PTSO (0.1-25 µm) are also shown in vitro in Caco-2 and THP-1 cells, reducing the production of pro-inflammatory mediators and downregulating mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathways. This compound displays beneficial effects in both models of mouse colitis by reducing the expression of different pro-inflammatory mediators and improving the intestinal epithelial barrier integrity. Moreover, PTSO ameliorates the altered gut microbiota composition observed in DSS colitic mice.PTSO exerts intestinal anti-inflammatory activity in experimental colitis in mice. This anti-inflammatory activity can be associated with the immunomodulatory properties of PTSO through the regulation of the activity of cells involved in the inflammatory response.

In contrast to drug therapies, which exert several side effects, herbal remedies have constantly attracted the attention of researchers. Therefore, in the present study, a mother tincture (MT) from fresh, young, non-woody  L. branches with leaves was obtained using distillation-based techniques. Further, this was used to assess its in vitro and in vivo antioxidant activities and anti-inflammatory properties, and to validate it as a potential phytotherapeutic treatment for . The characterization of the tincture included common phytochemical screening assays for antioxidant capacity measurement, cell viability assays on Caco-2 colon cells, and in vivo assessment of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects by histopathological and ultrastructural analysis of the intestinal mucosa, measurement of reduced glutathione, lipid peroxidation, and gene expression of the inflammation markers (interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α) in intestine after oral administration to an experimental mouse model of colon inflammation (colitis) developed by intrarectal administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS). Our study proved that administration of 25 or 50 mg  MT/kg of body weight/day by gavage for 7 days succeeded in inhibiting the inflammatory process induced by TNBS in the intestine, most probably because of its rich contents of flavonoids and phenolic compounds.

L-arginine (Arg) is a semi-essential amino  with a variety of physiological effects. In this context, our aim was to investigate the role of dietary Arg in experimental colitis. We used two models of colitis in C57BL/6 mice, the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) model of injury and repair, and  infection. Animals were given diets containing (1) no Arg (Arg), 6.4 g/kg (Arg), or 24.6 g/kg Arg (Arg); or (2) the amino  downstream of Arg: 28 g/kg L-ornithine (Orn) or 72 g/kg L-proline (Pro). Mice with DSS colitis receiving the Arg diet had increased levels of Arg, Orn, and Pro in the colon and improved body weight loss, colon length shortening, and histological injury compared to Arg and Arg diets. Histology was improved in the Arg vs. Arg group. Orn or Pro diets did not provide protection. Reduction in colitis with Arg diet also occurred in -infected mice. Diversity of the intestinal microbiota was significantly enhanced in mice on the Arg diet compared to the Arg or Arg diets, with increased abundance of Bacteroidetes and decreased Verrucomicrobia.

Although the precise etiology of  remains incompletely understood, accumulating evidence suggests that various environmental factors, including dietary nutrients, contribute to its pathogenesis. Dietary nutrients are known to have an impact on host physiology and diseases. The interactions between dietary nutrients and intestinal immunity are complex. Dietary nutrients directly regulate the immuno-modulatory function of gut-resident immune cells. Likewise, dietary nutrients shape the composition of the gut microbiota.

The colonic tissue samples were collected for macroscopic, wet weight, microscopic and biochemical (myeloperoxidase (MPO), glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), nitrate/nitrite (NO/NO), cytokines, and cyclooxygenase (COX-2)) analyses.Treatment with PLS reduced the intestinal damage induced by acetic  as it reduced macroscopic and microscopic scores and the wet weight of the colon. In addition, MPO activity and levels of GSH, MDA, NO/NO, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and COX-2 expression reduced.This study suggests that PLS exhibits anti-inflammatory action against intestinal damage by reducing inflammatory cell infiltration, oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory action of cytokines, and COX-2 expression in the inflamed colon.

In these patients, the over-production of ROS generated by inflamed bowel tissue and inflammatory cells activates a pathogenic cascade that further exacerbates inflammation and leads to increased oxidative damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids. We measured the products of protein/lipid oxidation and the total antioxidant capacity (ferric reducing ability of plasma, FRAP) in the serum of CD patients with severe disease activity requiring surgery with the aim to characterize their redox status and identify associations between oxidative stress-related markers and their clinical characteristics. At the systemic level, CD was associated with increased levels of protein and lipid oxidation products when compared to healthy volunteers, even though the FRAP values were similar. Advanced oxidation protein product (AOPP) levels showed the highest difference between patients and the controls (11.25, 5.02-15.15, vs. 1.36, 0.75-2.70, median, interquartile range;  < 0.0001) and the analysis of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, indicated for AOPP, the best area under the curve (AUC) value for CD prediction. Advanced glycated end-products (AGEs) were also significantly higher in CD patients ( < 0.01), which is of interest since AOPP and AGEs are both able to activate the membrane receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) involved in inflammatory diseases. Thiobarbituric  reactive substance (TBARS) levels were significantly higher in CD patients with ileal localization and aggressive disease behavior, in smokers, and in patients suffering from allergies. In conclusion, our data indicate that circulating oxidative stress biomarkers may be attractive candidates as disease predictors as well as for clinical or therapeutic monitoring of CD.

Current, population-based data from Switzerland show a prevalence of 0.4 % for  in Switzerland (one affected person in 250 inhabitants) with equal shares for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (one affected person in 500 inhabitants each). The mortality rate of Swiss  patients is comparable with the one of patients without . Roughly 80 % of patients with  suffer from co-morbidities. The most frequent co-morbidities concern cardiovascular diseases, followed by rheumatologic conditions, -related disorders, pain, and psychologic disorders. The yearly costs for the care of  patients are constantly increasing. The biggest proportion of the annual costs for  care is related to outpatient costs of which drug costs represent the major cost driver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30779922>MicroRNA-31 Reduces Inflammatory Signaling and Promotes Regeneration in Colon Epithelium, and Delivery of Mimics in Microspheres Reduces Colitis in Mice.</a></h2><p>Levels of microRNA 31 (MIR31) are increased in intestinal tissues from patients with inflammatory bowel diseases and colitis-associated neoplasias. We investigated the effects of this microRNA on intestinal inflammation by studying mice with colitis.We obtained colon biopsy samples from 82 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), 79 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), and 34 healthy individuals (controls) at Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital. MIR31- knockout mice and mice with conditional disruption of Mir31 specifically in the intestinal epithelium (MIR31 conditional knockouts) were given dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS) to induce colitis. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase assays to study proteins that regulate expression of MIR31, including STAT3 and p65, in LOVO colorectal cancer cells and organoids derived from mouse colon cells. Partially hydrolyzed alpha-lactalbumin was used to generate peptosome nanoparticles, and MIR31 mimics were loaded onto their surface using electrostatic adsorption. Peptosome-MIR31 mimic particles were encapsulated into oxidized konjac glucomannan (OKGM) microspheres, which were administered by enema into the large intestines of mice with DSS-induced colitis. Intestinal tissues were collected and analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry.Levels of MIR31 were increased in inflamed mucosa from patients with CD or UC, and from mice with colitis, compared with controls. STAT3 and nuclear factor-κB activated transcription of MIR31 in colorectal cancer cells and organoids in response to tumor necrosis factor and interleukin (IL)6. MIR31-knockout and conditional-knockout mice developed more severe colitis in response to DSS and TNBS, with increased immune responses, compared with control mice. MIR31 bound to 3' untranslated regions of Il17ra and Il7r messenger RNAs (RNAs) (which encode receptors for the inflammatory cytokines IL17 and IL7) and Il6st mRNA (which encodes GP130, a cytokine signaling protein). These mRNAs and proteins were greater in MIR31-knockout mice with colitis, compared with control mice; MIR31 and MIR31 mimics inhibited their expression. MIR31 also promoted epithelial regeneration by regulating the WNT and Hippo signaling pathways. OKGM peptosome-MIR31 mimic microspheres localized to colonic epithelial cells in mice with colitis; they reduced the inflammatory response, increased body weight and colon length, and promoted epithelial cell proliferation.MIR31, increased in colon tissues from patients with CD or UC, reduces the inflammatory response in colon epithelium of mice by preventing expression of inflammatory cytokine receptors (Il7R and Il17RA) and signaling proteins (GP130). MIR31 also regulates the WNT and Hippo signaling pathways to promote epithelial regeneration following injury. OKGM peptosome-MIR31 microspheres localize to the colon epithelium of mice to reduce features of colitis. Transcript Profiling: GSE123556.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Among postinflammatory sequelae, one-third of patients with  are suffering from functional symptoms or psychological comorbidities that persist during remission. The aim of our study was to assess functional and behavioral sequelae of chronic colitis in rats with quiescent intestinal inflammation. Chronic colitis was induced by a weekly intrarectal injection of increasing concentrations of trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS) for 3 wk (15-45 mg of TNBS) in 30 rats, whereas the control rats ( = 24) received the vehicle. At 50 days post-TNBS, visceral sensitivity was assessed by visceromotor response to colorectal distension, and transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) expression was also quantified in the colon and dorsal root ganglia. Barrier function and inflammatory response were assessed by studying intestinal permeability, tight junction protein, myeloperoxidase activity, histological score, and cytokine production (IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α). Anxiety behavioral tests were performed from 50 to 64 days after the last TNBS injection. Chronic TNBS induced ) a visceral hypersensitivity ( = 0.03), ) an increased colon weight-to-length ratio ( = 0.01), ) higher inflammatory and fibrosis scores ( = 0.0390 and  = 0.0016, respectively), and ) a higher colonic IL-6 and IL-10 production ( = 0.008 and  = 0.005, respectively) compared with control rats. Intestinal permeability, colonic production of TNF-α, myeloperoxidase activity, and TRPV1 expression did not differ among groups. Chronic TNBS increased anxiety-related behavior in the open-field test and in the acoustic stress test. In conclusion, chronic colitis induced functional sequelae such as visceral hypersensitivity and increased anxiety with a low-grade intestinal inflammation. Development of a representative animal model will allow defining novel therapeutic approaches to achieve a better management of -related sequelae.  Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases have impaired quality of life. Therapeutic progress to control mucosal inflammation provides us an opportunity to develop novel approaches to understand mechanisms behind postinflammatory sequelae. We used a chronic colitis model to study long-term sequelae on visceral pain, gut barrier function, and psychological impact. Chronic colitis induced functional symptoms and increased anxiety in the remission period. It might define novel therapeutic approaches to achieve a better inflammatory bowel disease-related sequelae management.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187350>Electroacupuncture inhibits visceral pain via adenosine receptors in mice with inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>To investigate the involvement of peripheral adenosine receptors in the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on visceral pain in mice with inflammatory bowel disease (). 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS) was used to induce the visceral pain model. EA (1 mA, 2 Hz, 30 min) treatment was applied to bilateral acupoints "Dachangshu" (BL25) 1 day after TNBS injection once daily for 7 consecutive days. Von Frey filaments were used to measure the mechanical pain threshold. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression levels of adenosine 1 receptor (A1R), adenosine 2a receptor (A2aR), adenosine 2b receptor (A2bR), adenosine 3 receptor (A3R), substance P (SP), and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) in colon tissue. EA significantly ameliorated the disease-related indices and reduced the expression of SP and IL-1β in the colon tissues of mice with . EA increased the expression of A1R, A2aR, and A3R and decreased the expression of A2bR in the colon tissue. Furthermore, the administration of adenosine receptor antagonists influenced the effect of EA. EA can inhibit the expression of the inflammatory factors SP and IL-1β by regulating peripheral A1, A2a, A2b, and A3 receptors, thus inhibiting visceral pain in  mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30615542>LB-9, Novel Probiotic Lactic  Bacteria, Ameliorates Dextran Sodium Sulfate-Induced Colitis in Mice by Inhibiting TNF-α-Mediated Apoptosis of Intestinal Epithelial Cells.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (), including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease, is a group of chronic and relapsing inflammatory conditions within the gastrointestinal tract. An increase in intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) apoptosis is a major characteristic of UC. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) plays an essential role in the regulation of apoptosis. Aberrant activation of the immune response to resident microflora contributes to overproduction of TNF-α in the mucosal tissue of the gastrointestinal tract; a hallmark of UC. There are no curative medications for . Thus, establishment of novel strategies for the treatment of this disease is imperative. Lactic  bacteria (LAB) have been characterized as probiotics that can alleviate imbalances in indigenous microflora in UC, exhibiting beneficial effects for the treatment and prevention of . In this study, we elucidate the potential of LB-9, a novel probiotic LAB, to protect against colitis development using a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced mouse model of UC. Treatment using LB-9 reduced clinical symptoms of colitis. In addition, both colitis-induced and NF-κB-mediated IEC apoptosis was markedly reduced in mice treated with LB-9. Moreover, these results were closely associated with reduced TNF-α levels. Our study demonstrates that the LB-9 probiotic exhibits therapeutic potential for UC through suppression of TNF-α-mediated IEC apoptosis in a murine DSS-induced colitis model, with important biological implications for treatment of  in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31067299>A Manganese-Superoxide Dismutase From Thermus thermophilus HB27 Suppresses Inflammatory Responses and Alleviates Experimentally Induced Colitis.</a></h2><p>Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is an attractive therapeutic agent to ameliorate oxidative stress that is critical for the initiation and progression of inflammatory bowel disease ().

Onion is one of the most commonly used plants in the traditional medicine for the management of various conditions including inflammatory and gastrointestinal diseases. However, little is known regarding the molecular mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effects of onion particularly in inflammatory bowel disease ().To test the anti-inflammatory effects of onion bulb extract (OBE) in an  mouse model and the molecular mechanisms responsible for these effects such as modulation of the expression and/or the activity profile of various pro-inflammatory molecules.Colitis was induced in mice by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) daily administration for 5 days. Animals were sacrificed, colons were removed and the severity of the inflammation was determined by the gross and histological assessments. The colonic level/activity of various cytokines and chemokines were measured using proteome profiling-based assay, western blotting, and immunofluorescence techniques.DSS-induced colitis was significantly reduced by the daily OBE treatment and 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA, positive control), particularly at 100-200 mg/kg doses, at both the gross and histological levels. OBE was also shown to reduce colonic expression and activity of several pro-inflammatory molecules and signaling pathways, such as mitogen activated protein kinase family, mammalian target of rapamycin, cyclooxygenase-2, and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases.

This study aimed to examine the effect of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) coated with the anti-vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM 1) antibody on experimental colitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS The antibody was coated onto the MSCs isolated from male BALB/C mice to generate anti-VCAM 1 antibody-coated MSC (V-MSC). The Transwell assay was used to detect migration rate. 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS) was used to generate experimental colitis. MSCs were injected intravenously into experimental models. Weight changes, disease activity index, and histological changes were evaluated. The SRY gene were used for cell tracking. Expression of Ki67 and claudin 1 was used to measure local repair using immunohistochemistry. T helper (Th)1, Th2, Th17, and T regulatory cells were counted. RESULTS V-MSCs were successfully generated through coating MSCs with VCAM1 antibody. Analysis showed that the V-MSCs had similar surface types and differentiation as uncoated MSCs. Transwell assays showed that V-MSCs had higher migration rate than MSCs. After injection of V-MSCs, the expression of the SRY gene was enhanced in diseased colon and all indices (including weight changes, DAI score, histological changes, and the expressions of Ki67 and claudin 1) recovered rapidly. The ratio of proinflammatory Th1 and Th17 cells decreased, but the ratio of anti-inflammatory Th2 and Treg cells increased after the treatment. CONCLUSIONS V-MSCs enhance homing and modulating immune balance in the experimental colitis, suggesting that they are potentially useful for treating inflammatory bowel disease or other immune diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666146>A pilot study of fecal bile  and microbiota profiles in inflammatory bowel disease and primary sclerosing cholangitis.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease () is thought to arise from an abnormal immune response to the gut microbiota.  is associated with altered intestinal microbial community structure and functionality, which may contribute to inflammation and complications such as colon cancer and liver disease.

Secondary BAs significantly increase after anti-TNF alpha treatment (1.54 0.83 μM). Furthermore, multivariate analysis based on sBA concentration highlighted a different qualitative sBAs profile for UC and CD patients treated with conventional therapy.According to our results, anti-TNF alpha in CD restores the sBA profile by re-establishing the physiological levels.

Hence, we used an isolated murine  strain (designated 139) and  type strain ATCC, to investigate their anti-inflammatory properties in cell models and in Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS)-induced chronic colitis of mice. , the two  strains exerted similar anti-inflammatory properties as they both reduced IL-8 production by TNF-α-stimulated HT-29 cells. However, neither of the strains showed capacity to increase the differentiation of regulatory T (Treg)-cells from CD4+ T cell populations significantly. , both  strains exerted anti-inflammatory effects on chronic colitis as they improved clinical parameters including spleen weight, colon inflammation index, and colon histological score.

'Leaky gut' has been found in intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases. However, functional evaluation of intestinal permeability is not widely used as a diagnostic marker, possibly owing to significant limitations of currently used permeability assays. There is an unmet need for development of a new, non-invasive test to assess intestinal function. What is the main finding and its importance? We show that an increased blood-to-stool ratio of the concentration of gut bacteria-produced short-chain fatty  may be used as a marker of gut permeability. Our findings lay the groundwork for establishing a new, non-invasive, risk-free diagnostic tool in diseases associated with intestinal barrier malfunction, such as inflammatory bowel disease.Intestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (), are characterized by an impaired gut-blood barrier commonly referred to as 'leaky gut'. Therefore, functional evaluation of the gut-blood barrier is a promising diagnostic marker. We hypothesized that short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) produced by gut bacteria might serve as a marker in . Animal experiments were performed on male Sprague-Dawley rats with acetic -induced colitis and in sham control animals. The gut-blood barrier permeability was determined by assessing the ratios of the following: (i) portal blood concentration of SCFAs (C ) to faecal concentration of SCFAs (C ); (ii) systemic blood concentration of SCFAs (C ) to faecal concentration of SCFAs (C ); and (iii) C and C of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran administered into the colon. As a clinical study, we evaluated C , C and the C /C ratio of SCFAs in six paediatric patients with , assessed as mild/moderate/severe by the Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) and the Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) at the time of sample collection, and nine age-matched healthy control subjects. Rats with histologically confirmed  had significantly increased ratios of C /C and C /C for SCFAs. This was positively correlated with the plasma FITC-dextran concentration. Likewise,  patients showed a significantly higher C /C ratio for SCFAs, including acetic, valeric, isocaproic, caproic and propionic , in comparison to control subjects. In conclusion, in the rats and in paediatric patients with  we found an increased blood-to-stool ratio of SCFAs, suggesting an increased gut-to-blood penetration of SCFAs.

Patients with UC usually suffer from a lifetime of debilitating physical symptoms. Therefore, developing effective therapeutic strategy that can manage this disease better and improve patients' life quality is in urgent need. Sesamin (SSM) is a lignan derived from sesame seeds. In this study, the protective effect of SSM against UC and the underlying mechanism were investigated  and . Our data showed that SSM protected Caco-2 cells from HO-induced oxidative stress injury via GSH-mediated scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Dual luciferase reporter assay showed that the transcriptional activity of nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2 (Nrf2) was significantly increased by SSM, and the ability of SSM to activate Nrf2-targeted genes was further confirmed in Caco-2 cells using western blot and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). In contrast, Nrf2 knockdown abolished the protective effect of SSM. Additionally, we found that SSM also activated advanced protein kinase B (AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in Caco-2 cells, while either AKT or ERK inhibition can prevent SSM-mediated nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Furthermore, SSM displayed a better protective effect against dextran sulfate sodium- (DSS-) induced UC compared with 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA) in C57BL/6 mice. The enhanced Nrf2 signaling and activated AKT/ERK were also observed in the colon of mice after SSM administration. These results first demonstrate the protective effect of SSM against UC and indicate that the effect is associated with AKT/ERK activation and subsequent Nrf2 signaling enhancement. This study provides a new insight into the medicinal value of SSM and proposes it as a new natural nutrition for better managing the symptoms of UC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504527>Application of Herbaceous Medications for Inflammatory Bowel Disease as a Complementary and Alternative Therapy.</a></h2><p>Conventional medicine for the treatment of  is prevailingly composed of sulfadiazine, 5-aminosalicylic , glucocorticoid, and immunosuppressants, which have the merits of alleviating intestine inflammation, but long-term use of these drugs may cause toxic side effects; additionally, these drugs may be expensive. In the pursuit of novel and more economic therapies, patients may increasingly look at complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Recently, CAM is increasingly favored by the general public on account of its safety, low toxicity, and effectiveness.

Previously, our study revealed significant loss of Roseburia intestinalis from the gut of untreated patients with CD, and that R. intestinalis exerted anti‑inflammatory functions in TNBS‑induced colitis; however, the function of R. intestinalis supernatant is unknown. Therefore, LPS‑induced macrophages, including RAW264.7 macrophages and bone marrow‑derived macrophages were treated with R. intestinalis supernatant. The results indicated that R. intestinalis supernatant suppressed expression of interleukin (IL)‑6 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) by macrophages. Additionally, these findings were further verified in vivo in DSS‑ and TNBS‑induced mouse models of colitis. It was observed that R. intestinalis supernatant ameliorated  colitis by reducing the number of inflammatory macrophages and Th17 cells in the colon, and by downregulating the expression of IL‑6 and STAT3. Finally, the non‑protein components of R. intestinalis supernatant were examined using gas chromatography‑mass spectrometry analysis and identified the presence of short‑chain fatty . In conclusion, the results of the present study indicated that R. intestinalis supernatant may regulate immune responses and ameliorate colitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31298421>No increased risk of nephrotoxicity associated with 5-aminosalicylic  in : a population-based cohort and nested case-control study.</a></h2><p>There is conflicting evidence about nephrotoxicity risk associated with 5-aminosalicylates for treatment of .To determine population-based temporal trends for 5-aminosalicylates and estimated risk of nephrotoxicity associated with 5-aminosalicylate use for ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD).Retrospective cohort and nested case-control study, using the Health Improvement Network primary care database linked to hospital discharge coding for patients in England, 1996-2017. Nephrotoxicity risk analysis was a first recorded renal impairment diagnosis adjusted for key variables and was assessed between 2008 and 2017.A total of 35 601 patients with prevalent UC or CD were included. The proportion of patients prescribed 5-aminosalicylates fell from 83% in 1996-1999 to 71% in 2012-2015 for UC patients and 64% to 45% for CD patients. Thirty per cent of patients had prolonged 5-aminosalicylate use. Between 2008 and 2017, the incident rate of nephrotoxicity was similar and stable for UC (12.6/1000 person-years) and CD (10.9/1000 person-years) patients. Multivariate analysis showed no evidence for association between current prescription of 5-aminosalicylate and nephrotoxicity in UC or CD patients, comparing ≤ 30 days prescription prior to index vs 31-≤180 days. However, active disease, disease duration, concomitant cardiovascular disease or diabetes and nephrotoxic drug use were independently associated with development of nephrotoxicity in UC and CD.Despite the paucity of evidence for their benefit, 5-aminosalicylates were prescribed to approximately half of CD patients (30% prolonged therapy). Nephrotoxicity was rare in this patient cohort, and was not associated with 5-aminosalicylate use, but rather with disease status, comorbidity and use of nephrotoxic drugs.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580446>Combination therapy of mesenchymal stromal cells and sulfasalazine attenuates trinitrobenzene sulfonic  induced colitis in the rat: The S1P pathway.</a></h2><p>Adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) transplantation is a novel immunomodulatory therapeutic tool to ameliorate the symptom of inflammatory bowel disease (). The objective of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effects of combined sufasalazine and ASCs therapy in a rat model of . After induction of colitis in rats, ASCs were cultured and intraperitoneally injected (3 × 10 cells/kg) into the rats on Days 1 and 5 after inducing colitis, in conjunction with daily oral administration of low dose of sulfasalazine (30 mg/kg). The regenerative effects of combination of ASCs and sulfasalazine on ulcerative colitis were assessed by measuring body weight, colonic weight/length ratio, disease activity index, macroscopic scores, histopathological examinations, cytokine, and inflammation markers profiles. In addition, western blot analysis was used to assess the levels of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and apoptosis related proteins in colitis tissues. Simultaneous treatment with ASCs and sulfasalazine was associated with significant amelioration of disease activity index, macroscopic and microscopic colitis scores, as well as inhibition of the proinflammatory cytokines in trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS)-induced colitis. Moreover, combined ASCs and sulfasalazine therapy effectively inhibited the NF-κB signaling pathway, reduced the expression of Bax and prevented the loss of Bcl-2 proteins in colon tissue of the rats with TNBS-induced colitis. Furthermore, combined treatment with ASCs and sulfasalazine shifted inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages by decreasing the levels of MCP1, CXCL9 and increasing IL-10, Arg-1 levels. In conclusion, combination of ASCs with conventional  therapy is potentially a much more powerful strategy to slow the progression of colitis via reducing inflammatory and apoptotic markers than either therapy alone.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31198116>Identification of quinolone and colistin resistance genes in Escherichia coli strains isolated from mucosal samples of patients with colorectal cancer and healthy subjects.</a></h2><p>Antibiotic resistance and extensive use of antibiotics is one of the major causes of failure in antibiotic treatment. The purpose of this study was to investigate antibiotic resistance patterns and to identify resistance genes of quinolones and colistin in Escherichia coli. There are very few patents on E. coli isolated from colorectal cancer. So, this study demonstrated that some bacteria resistant to ciprofloxacin are not present resistance genes. As well as, new patterns for E. coli are presented for samples of patients with colorectal cancer.Of the three healthy, inflammatory bowel diseases () and colorectal cancer groups, 40 E. coli strains isolated after confirmation by biochemical and molecular methods. The susceptibility of isolates to antibiotics was investigated using disk diffusion test. After deoxyribonucleic  (DNA) extraction, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to identify genes encoding resistance to ciprofloxacin (qnr A, qnr B) and colistin (mcr-1).The results showed that E. coli isolates from colorectal cancer patients had the highest resistance to piperacillin (67.5%), ceftazidime (47.5%), and cefepime (42.5%). Also, E. coli strains isolated from  patients showed resistance to antibiotic ceftazidime 13%. More than 95% of E. coli strains isolated from healthy people were susceptible to antibiotics. Based on the results, 18 (15%) E. coli strains were showed resistance to ciprofloxacin. The qnr A gene was detected in 61.11% isolate; however qnr B was detected in 9 (50%). Isolates resistant to colistin were not observed.These findings indicate increased resistance of E. coli to ciprofloxacin in comparison with prior studies.

With increasing use of immunosuppressive agents and biological agents, opportunistic infections are becoming a hot topic in the perspective of drug safety in  patients. Despite the well-established role of opportunistic infections in the prognosis of  patients, there are few epidemiological data investigating the incidence of opportunis-tic infections in  patients in China. Besides, the risk factors for opportunistic infection in Chinese  patients remain unclear.To predict the incidence of opportunistic infections related to  in China, and explore the risk factors for opportunistic infections.A single-center, prospective study of  patients was conducted. The patients were followed for up to 12 mo to calculate the incidence of infections. For each infected  patient, two non-infected  patients were selected as controls. A conditional logistic regression analysis was used to assess associations between putative risk factors and opportunistic infections, which are represented as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Seventy (28.11%) out of 249  patients developed opportunistic infections.  infections and respiratory syncytial virus infections were found in 24 and 16 patients, respectively. In a univariate analysis, factors such as the severity of , use of an immunosuppressant or immunosuppressants, high levels of fecal calprotectin, and C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate were individually related to a significantly increased risk of opportunistic infection. Multivariate analysis indicated that the use of any immunosuppressant yielded an OR of 3.247 (95%CI: 1.128-9.341), whereas the use of any two immunosuppressants yielded an OR of 6.457 (95%CI: 1.726-24.152) for opportunistic infection. Interestingly, when immunosuppressants were used in combination with infliximab (IFX) or 5-aminosalicylic , a significantly increased risk of opportunistic infection was also observed. The relative risk of opportunistic infection was greatest in  patients with severe disease activity (OR = 9.090; 95%CI: 1.532-53.941, relative to the remission stage). However, the use of IFX alone did not increase the risk of opportunistic infection.Factors such as severe , elevated levels of fecal calprotectin, and the use of immunosuppressive medications, especially when used in combination, are major risk factors for opportunistic infections in  patients. The use of IFX alone does not increase the risk of opportunistic infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30532751>An Insight Into the Intestinal Web of Mucosal Immunity, Microbiota, and Diet in Inflammation.</a></h2><p>The rising global incidence of autoimmune and inflammatory conditions can be attributed to changes in the large portion of the immune system that belongs to our gastrointestinal tract (GI). The intestinal immune system serves as a gatekeeper to prevent pathogenic invasions and to preserve a healthier gut microbiota. The gut microbiota has been increasingly studied as a fundamental contributor to the state of health and disease. From food fermentation, the gut microbiota releases metabolites or short chain fatty  (SCFAs), which have anti-inflammatory properties and preserve gut homeostasis. Immune responses against food and microbial antigens can cause inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease () and celiac disease. As such, many autoimmune and inflammatory diseases also have a "gut origin". A large body of evidence in recent years by ourselves and others has uncovered the link between the immune system and the SCFAs in specific diseases such as autoimmune type 1 diabetes (T1D), obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease, infections, allergies, asthma, and . Thus, the power of these three gut dynamic components-the mucosal immunity, the microbiota, and diet-can be harnessed in tandem for the prevention and treatment of many inflammatory and infectious diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30502453>The crystalline salt form of a selected candidate drug showed photo-, thermal- and humidity induced form transitions.</a></h2><p>AZ3411 was selected as a lead compound for the treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (). The present research aimed to perform an early pharmaceutical assessment of this NK antagonist candidate focusing on the challenging solid-state part of the evaluation. X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), hot stage XRPD and microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetrical analysis measurements, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and liquid chromatographic analysis were used to characterize AZ3411. The amorphous, free base form of AZ3411 was transformed to a poorly crystalline material by salt formation using maleic . Suspensions of the poorly crystalline form (type A), prepared in various solvents, exhibited phase transformation on storage. Some precipitate was identified as a new, more crystalline form (type B) of the maleate salt of AZ3411. Also, a third crystalline form was observed at high temperatures (type C). AZ3411 maleate type A, maleate type B and amorphous, free base form was stored in 40 °C/75% relative humidity (RH), 60 °C and 80 °C for three months. Form B was found to be the most chemically stable at all conditions. After three months at 40 °C/75%RH, both type A and type B had transformed to the anhydrous type C. Moreover, type B was transformed to form C at 60 °C and 80 °C, while type A remained unchanged. These results, together with the loss of water with temperature, suggest that type B is a hydrate. The relative stability between the hydrate type B and anhydrous type C depend on humidity and temperature. Moreover, the photosensitivity of maleate type A, maleate type B and amorphous free base has been investigated under three different illumination conditions. In similarity to the previous study, Form B was the most chemically stable form. However, after completion the study, at the highest energy conditions (765 W/m, 250-800 nm), the crystalline type B had transformed to type C, while type A had lost in crystallinity. A similar photostability study was performed on solutions of pH 1 and pH 7. The degradation pattern was similar for the two pHs but appeared different from the unstressed solution stability study performed on different pHs between pH 1 and 7. Neither was there any obvious correlation between the degradation patterns obtained after the stressed thermal- and photostability studies performed on the drug substance in solid-state. The salt of AZ3411 fulfils basic requirements for further development of an oral immediate release (IR) dosage form, although the compound displays signs of light sensitivity and there may be a risk of solid-state transitions during formulation development and long-term storage.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Long-term UC remission has shed light on the necessity of modified therapeutic strategies. In this study, UC was induced in rats by intrarectal administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS). The anticolitis effect of methylene blue (MB), a well-known dye and antioxidant and a potent mitochondrial enhancer was tested. MB was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) at a dose of 1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg, and colosalazine was administered orally (p.o.) at a dose of 500 mg/kg 11 days after the administration of TNBS, which was injected on the 8th day. All treatment group results were compared to the TNBS group results. Macroscopically, limited body weight loss and decrease in the colon weight per unit length ratio were observed in the MB groups. MB improved histological damage and decreased the expression of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and accumulation of CD4 lymphocytes observed by immunohistochemistry. Downregulation of Bax/Bcl protein expression was detected using Western blotting, and increased mRNA expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) was measured by qPCR. MB produced biochemical alterations, such as significant decrease in interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-17 (IL-17) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) levels measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Significant decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) levels as well as significant increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase levels were observed with MB, and these effects were similar to those produced by colosalazine. Thus, MB altered disease pathogenesis and could be a promising and challenging therapeutic target for UC treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621721>Intestinal anti-inflammatory activity of xique-xique (Pilosocereus gounellei A.

The presence of Lactobacillus in the gut microbiota is associated with major depressive disorder. Therefore, we examined whether Enterococcus faecalis 2001 (EF-2001), a biogenic lactic  bacterium, prevents DSS-induced depressive-like behavior and changes in peripheral symptoms.We evaluated colon inflammation and used the tail suspension test to examine whether EF-2001 prevents -like symptoms and depressive-like behavior in DSS-treated mice.

In particular, an antigenically modified isolate of very virulent IBDV (vvIBDV) called 99323 was detected in Egypt nearly twenty years ago; this isolate was shown to be experimentally controlled by an antigenically classical live vaccine. However, acute  is still reported, even in vaccinated flocks, and little is known about the genetic and antigenic properties of viruses currently circulating in Egypt. In the present study, ten samples collected in Egyptian broiler farms in 2015 as well as five samples collected in 2001 were analyzed. Genetic analyses of partial VP2 sequences revealed that 8 isolates clustered with vvIBDV strains, and 5 with tissue culture adapted and vaccine strains. Similar results were observed for partial VP1 sequences with the exception of isolate 160019, for which VP2 clustered with the vaccine strain Bursine while VP1 clustered with vvIBDV, suggesting reassortment. For isolates genetically related to vvIBDV, antigenic profiling revealed two patterns: while some isolates exhibited typical European vvIBDV reactivity with lack of binding of mAbs 5, other revealed extensive antigenic modifications, with lack of binding of mAbs 3, 5, 6, 8 and 9, similar to isolate 99323. These different patterns were associated with a single amino  mutation at position 321 of VP2 that is located within peak P.

Nonetheless, earlier studies suggest that the oxidation of butyrate in  patients is altered. We propose that inflammation may decrease epithelial butyrate consumption.Non- controls and  patients were recruited for the study. Stool samples were used for short-chain fatty  and bacterial butyryl CoA:acetate CoA-transferase quantification. Colonic biopsies and ex vivo differentiated epithelial organoids (d-EpOCs) treated with butyrate and/or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) were used for analyzing the expression of transporters MCT1 and ABCG2, metabolic enzyme ACADS, and butyrate receptor GPR43, and for butyrate metabolism and consumption assays.We observed that lower stool content of butyrate-producing bacteria in active  patients did not correlate with decreased butyrate concentrations. Indeed, the intestinal epithelial expression of MCT1, ABCG2, ACADS, and GPR43 was altered in active  patients. Nonetheless, d-EpOCs derived from  patients showed SLC16A1 (gene encoding for MCT1 protein), ABCG2, ACADS, and GPR43 expression levels comparable to controls. Moreover, - and non--derived d-EpOCs responded similarly to butyrate, as assessed by transcriptional regulation. TNFα significantly altered SLC16A1, ABCG2, and GPR43 transcription in d-EpOCs, mimicking the expression profile observed in biopsies from active  patients and resulting in reduced butyrate consumption.We provide evidence that the response to butyrate is not intrinsically altered in  patients. However, TNFα renders the epithelium less responsive to this metabolite, defeating the purpose of butyrate supplementation during active inflammation.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

Thus, in vitro and preclinical findings of study clearly confirmed that C-SBLNs could be a stable and efficacious alternative platform for curcumin delivery with strong competence in  chemotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31094471>Markers of dysbiosis in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.</a></h2><p>The aim of the study was to study the taxonomic and functional composition of the gut microbiota in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) patients to identify key markers of dysbiosis in .Fecal samples obtained from 95  patients (78 UC and 17 CD) as well as 96 healthy volunteers were used for whole-genome sequencing carried out on the SOLiD 5500 W platform. Taxonomic profiling was performed by aligning the reeds, not maped on hg19, on MetaPhlAn2 reference database. Reeds were mapped using the HUNAnN2 algorithm to the ChocoPhlAn database to assess the representation of microbial metabolic pathways. Short-chain fatty  (SCFA) level were measured in fecal samples by gas-liquid chromatographic analysis.Changes in  patients gut microbiota were characterized by an increase in the representation of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes phyla bacteria and decrease in the number of Firmicutes phylum bacteria and Euryarchaeota phylum archaea; a decrease in the alpha-diversity index, relative representation of butyrate-producing, hydrogen-utilizing bacteria, and Methanobrevibacter smithii; increase in the relative representation of Ruminococcus gnavus in UC and CD patients and Akkermansia muciniphila in CD patients. Reduction of Butyryl-CoA: acetate CoA transferase gene relative representation in CD patients, decrease of absolute content of SCFA total number as well as particular SCFAs and main SCFAs ratio in  patients may indicate inhibition of functional activity and number of anaerobic microflora and/or an change in SCFA utilization by colonocytes.the revealed changes can be considered as typical signs of dysbiosis in  patients and can be used as potential targets for  patients personalized treatment development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31322753>Mucosal gene expression changes induced by anti-TNF treatment in inflammatory bowel disease patients.</a></h2><p>In the last two decades anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy for inflammatory bowel disease () has been widely used to induce and maintain clinical and endoscopical remission, completely changing management of the disease. In this study, we aimed to identify gene expression changes in inflamed mucosa from Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients treated with 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA) (N = 25) or anti-TNF agents (N = 12) compared to drug-free  patients (N = 12) and non- control subjects (N = 18). The mucosal expression of 84 genes previously associated with  was evaluated by qPCR. We found that both therapeutic regimens induce a decrease in LCN2, NOS2, and TFF1, the levels of which are overexpressed in drug-free patients compared to non- control subjects. Interestingly, a stronger effect of anti-TNF drugs was observed on LCN2 and TFF1 levels. However, 5-ASA seems to induce a more robust reduction of NOS2 expression. Moreover, we found that anti-TNF treatment significantly increased ABCB1, leading to levels similar to those found in non- control subjects.© 2019 The Authors.

The aim was to investigate the correlation between gastroduodenal (GD) symptoms, gastric emptying, and serum levels of active ghrelin and leptin in . Twenty-seven  patients and 26 healthy volunteers were asked to complete the Porto Alegre Dyspeptic Symptoms Questionnaire. A gastric emptying test for solids was performed using a C13 octanoic  breath test. During this test, serum samples were collected for measuring active ghrelin and leptin concentrations by radioimmunoassay.Patients with  demonstrated delayed gastric emptying compared with healthy volunteers. In patients with GD symptoms, the delay in gastric emptying was more pronounced, and there were significant correlations of satiety and vomiting with gastric emptying. Basal leptin, but not active ghrelin, increased in patients with GD symptoms compared with patients without these symptoms. There were negative correlations between basal active ghrelin with total Porto Alegre score and epigastric pain in  patients with GD symptoms. Key Messages: In , satiety and vomiting were associated with delay in gastric emptying. Conversely, epigastric pain had a negative correlation with active ghrelin. Our results suggest that different pathophysiological mechanisms contribute to GD symptoms in .© 2019 S.

Various studies have reported complications of the CD. However, arterial thrombosis is an extremely rare complication of CD. We report a patient with CD with extensive thrombosis of the extremities and mesenteric arteries.A 41-year-old man came to our hospital for 2 months of discomfort in the right upper abdomen and had previous left lower extremity arterial occlusive disease and left upper limb ischemic contraction for more than 2 months. The patient developed fever and abdominal pain repeatedly after admission; because of the increased abdominal pain, we urgently performed a laparotomy for him. And according to the findings in the surgery, we decided to perform partial small intestine resection, cholecystectomy, common bile duct exploration, and T-tube drainage.Pathological findings of postoperative specimens showed Crohn's disease and mesenteric atherosclerosis with mesenteric artery thrombosis. We performed a series of treatments such as 5-aminosalicylic , intravenous infusion, broad-spectrum antibiotic infection treatment, nutritional support, and low molecular weight heparin. The patient was successfully discharged from the hospital.The occurrence of  with arterial thromboembolism is extremely rare but can lead to serious consequences. During  treatment, we should be aware of the possibility of TEs (especially arterial TEs) and should be alert to the possibility of arterial TEs in young patients with  with active and extensive disease.Copyright © 2019.
