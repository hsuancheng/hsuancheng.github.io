<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30076920> as apoptosis activator: Molecular mechanisms, mathematical modeling and chemical modifications.</a></h1><p>A natural product  (BA) has gained a huge significance in the recent years for its strong cytotoxicity. Surprisingly, in spite of being an interesting cancer protecting agent on a variety of tumor cells, the normal cells and tissues are rarely affected by BA.  and analogues (BAs) generally exert through the mechanisms that provokes an event of direct cell death and bypass the resistance to normal chemotherapeutics. Although the major mechanism associated with its ability to induce direct cell death is mitochondrial apoptosis, there are several other mechanisms explored recently. Importantly, mathematical modeling of apoptosis has been an important tool to explore the precise mechanism involved in mitochondrial apoptosis. Thus, this review is an endeavor to sum up the molecular mechanisms underlying the action of BA and future directions to apply mathematical modeling technique to better understand the precise mechanism of BA-induced apoptosis. The last section of the review encompasses the plausible structural modifications and formulations to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of BA.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Although a few studies indicated mitophagy is related with drug resistance, its role in different cancer types and anticancer agents treatment remains largely unclear. Here, we find that B5G1, a new derivative of BA, induces cell death in multidrug resistant cancer cells HepG2/ADM and MCF-7/ADR through mitochondrial-apoptosis pathway. B5G1 also triggers mitophagy independent on Atg5/Beclin 1. Further mechanistic study indicates that B5G1 upregulates PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) to recruit Parkin to  followed by ubiquitination of Mfn2 to initiate mitophagy. Inhibition of mitophagy by PINK1 siRNA, mdivi-1, or bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1) promotes B5G1-induced cell death. In addition, ROS production and mitochondrial damage in B5G1-treated HepG2/ADM cells cause mitochondrial apoptosis and mitophagy. In vivo study shown that B5G1 dramatically inhibits HepG2/ADM xenograft growth accompanied by apoptosis and mitophagy induction. Together, our results provide the first demonstration that B5G1, as a novel mitophagy inducer, has the potential to be developed into a drug candidate for treating multidrug resistant cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31277238> Suppresses Ovarian Cancer Cell Proliferation through Induction of Apoptosis.</a></h1><p>Ovarian cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths worldwide in women, and the most malignant cancer among the different gynecological cancers. In this study, we explored potentially anticancer compounds from  (Cornaceae), the MeOH extract of which has been reported to show considerable cytotoxicity against several cancer cell lines. Phytochemical investigations of the MeOH extract of the stem and stem bark of  by extensive application of chromatographic techniques resulted in the isolation of 14 compounds (-). The isolated compounds were evaluated for inhibitory effects on the viability of A2780 human ovarian carcinoma cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms were investigated. An 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was employed to assess the anticancer effects of compounds - on A2780 cells, which showed that compound  () reduced the viability of these cells in a concentration-dependent manner and had an half maximal (50%) inhibitory concentration (IC) of 44.47 μM at 24 h. Nuclear staining and image-based cytometric assay were carried out to detect the induction of apoptosis by .  significantly increased the condensation of nuclei and the percentage of apoptotic cells in a concentration-dependent manner in A2780 cells. Western blot analysis was performed to investigate the underlying mechanism of apoptosis. The results indicated that the expression levels of cleaved caspase-8, -3, -9, and Bax were increased in A2780 cells treated with , whereas those of Bcl-2 were decreased. Thus, we provide the experimental evidence that  can induce apoptosis in A2780 cells through both -dependent and -independent pathways and suggest the potential use of  in the development of novel chemotherapeutics for ovarian cancer therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25797115>Induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by -rich fraction from Dillenia suffruticosa root in MCF-7 cells involved p53/p21 and mitochondrial signalling pathway.</a></h1><p>Dillenia suffruticosa (Family: Dilleniaceae) or commonly known as "Simpoh air" in Malaysia, is traditionally used for treatment of cancerous growth including breast cancer.D. suffruticosa root dichloromethane extract (DCM-DS) has been reported to induce G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in caspase-3 deficient MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The present study was designed to investigate the involvement of p53/p21 and mitochondrial pathway in DCM-DS-treated MCF-7 cells as well as to identify the bioactive compounds responsible for the cytotoxicity of DCM-DS.Extraction of D. suffruticosa root was performed by the use of sequential solvent procedure. GeXP-based multiplex system was employed to investigate the expression of p53, p21, Bax and Bcl-2 genes in MCF-7 cells treated with DCM-DS. The protein expression was then determined using Western blot analysis. The bioactive compounds present in DCM-DS were isolated by using column chromatography. The structure of the compounds was elucidated by using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The cytotoxicity of the isolated compounds towards MCF-7 cells was evaluated by using MTT assay. The percentage of  (BA) in DCM-DS was determined by HPLC analysis.The expression of p53 was significantly up-regulated at protein level. The expression of p21 at both gene and protein levels was significantly up-regulated upon treatment with DCM-DS, suggesting that the induction of G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest in MCF-7 cells was via p53/p21 pathway. Bcl-2 protein was down-regulated with no change at the mRNA level, postulating that post-translational modification has occurred resulting in the degradation of Bcl-2 protein. Overall, treatment with DCM-DS increased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 that drove the cells to undergo apoptosis. A total of 3 triterpene compounds were isolated from DCM-DS.  appears to be the most major and most cytotoxic compound in DCM-DS.DCM-DS induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in MCF-7 cells via p53/p21 pathway. In addition, DCM-DS induced apoptosis by increasing the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2. , which is one of the major compounds, is responsible for the cytotoxicity of the DCM-DS. Therefore, BA can be used as a marker for standardisation of herbal product from D. suffruticosa. DCM-DS can also be employed as BA-rich extract from roots of D. suffruticosa for the management of breast cancer.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The antitumor pharmacological effects of BA consist of triggering apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway, regulating the cell cycle and the angiogenic pathway via factors, including specificity protein transcription factors, cyclin D1 and epidermal growth factor receptor, inhibiting the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and nuclear factor‑κB signaling , preventing the invasion and metastasis of tumor cells, and affecting the expression of topoisomerase I, p53 and lamin B1. In previous years, several studies have shown its antitumor effect, initially applied to malignant melanoma, however, it also has broad efficacies against most solid types of tumor from different regions of the body. There have been few investigations in hematological malignancies, however, this direction may offer potential in such a novel field of research. In this review, the primary pharmacological effects of BA in tumors, particularly in hematological malignancies are discussed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25531780>Glycolytic switch in response to  in non-cancer cells.</a></h1><p>The naturally occurring triterpenoid  (BA) shows pronounced polypharmacology ranging from anti-inflammatory to anti-lipogenic activities. Recent evidence suggests that rather diverse cellular signaling events may be attributed to the same common upstream switch in cellular metabolism. In this study we therefore examined the metabolic changes induced by BA (10 µM) administration, with focus on cellular glucose metabolism. We demonstrate that BA elevates the rates of cellular glucose uptake and aerobic glycolysis in mouse embryonic fibroblasts with concomitant reduction of glucose oxidation. Without eliciting signs of obvious cell death BA leads to compromised mitochondrial function, increased expression of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCP) 1 and 2, and liver kinase B1 (LKB1)-dependent activation AMP-activated protein kinase. AMPK activation accounts for the increased glucose uptake and glycolysis which in turn are indispensable for cell viability upon BA treatment. Overall, we show for the first time a significant impact of BA on cellular bioenergetics which may be a central mediator of the pleiotropic actions of BA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27773704>Membrane damage by  provides insights into cellular aging.</a></h1><p>Cell senescence is a process of central importance to the understanding of aging as well as to the development of new drugs. It is related with genomic instability, which has been shown to occur in the presence of autophagy deficiency. Yet, the mechanism that triggers genomic instability and senescence from a condition of autophagy deficiency remains unknown. By analyzing the consequences of treating human keratinocytes (HaCaT) with the pentacyclic triterpenoid  (BA) we were able to propose that cell senescence can develop as a response to parallel damage in the membranes of mitochondria and lysosome.We performed biochemical, immunocytochemical and cytometric assays after challenging HaCaT cells with BA. We also evaluated membrane leakage induced by BA in liposomes and giant unilamellar vesicles.By destabilizing lipid bilayers of mitochondria and lysosomes, BA triggers the misbalance in the mitochondrial-lysosomal axis leading to perceived autophagy impairment, lipofuscinogenesis, genomic instability and cell senescence. The progressive accumulation of mitochondria and lipofuscin, which comes from imperfect mitophagy triggered by BA, provides a continuous source of reactive species further damaging lysosomes and leading to cell aging.This work reveals that the initial trigger of cell senescence can be the physical damage in the membranes of lysosomes and mitochondria.This concept will help in the search of new drugs that act as senescence-inductors. BA is under evaluation as chemotherapeutic agent against several types of tumors and induction of cell senescence should be considered as one of its main mechanisms of action.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In cancer research, lead structures of compounds from natural sources can be used to design novel chemotherapies with enhanced biological properties.  (3β-hydroxy-lup-20(29)-en-28-oic acid or BetA) is a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpene with a wide variety of biological activities, including potent antitumor properties. Non-malignant cells and normal tissues are not affected by BetA. Because BetA exerts its effects directly on the mitochondrion and triggers death of cancerous cells, it is an important alternative when certain chemotherapy drugs fail. Mitochondrion-targeted agents such as BetA hold great promise to circumvent drug resistance in human cancers. BetA is being developed by a large network of clinical trial groups with the support of the U.S. National Cancer Institute. This article discusses recent advances in research into anticancer activity of BetA, relevant modes of delivery, and the agent's therapeutic efficacy, mechanism of action, and future perspective as a pipeline anticancer drug. BetA is a potentially important agent in cancer therapeutics.© 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25585916>A potent tumoricidal co-drug 'Bet-CA'--an ester derivative of  and dichloroacetate selectively and synergistically kills cancer cells.</a></h1><p>Selective targeting of cancer cells employing multiple combinations as co-drug holds promise for new generation therapeutics.  (BA), a plant secondary metabolite kills cancer cells and Dichloroacetate (DCA) is capable of reversing the Warburg phenotype by inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK). Here, we report synthesis, characterization and tumoricidal potential of a co-drug Bet-CA, where a DCA molecule has been appended on C-3 hydroxyl group of BA to generate an ester derivative for increased solubility and subsequent cleavage by internal esterase(s) to release one unit each of BA and DCA. In vitro studies revealed pronounced synergistic cytotoxicity of Bet-CA against a broad spectrum of cancer cells and it selectively killed them when co-cultured with human fibroblasts. Bet-CA treatment increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, significantly altered mitochondrial membrane potential gradient (ΔΨm); followed by the release of cytochrome c (Cyt c) which prompted cells to undergo mitochondria mediated apoptosis. In vivo experimentation expectedly exhibited tumor inhibitory potential of Bet-CA and clinically achievable doses did not produce any apparent toxicity. Taken together, results suggestively raise an important corollary hypothesis stating that Bet-CA selectively and synergistically combats cancer without producing toxic manifestations and emerges to be the prospect for the new generation therapeutics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25358079>Incorporation of pentacyclic triterpenes into mitochondrial membrane--studies on the interactions in model 2D lipid systems.</a></h1><p>Three representatives of naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpenes (PTs) were subjected to comprehensive studies aimed at the analysis of their interactions with phospholipids found naturally in mitochondrial membrane. To reach this goal, the selected compounds--α-amyrin (AMalf),  (BAc), and ursolic acid (Urs)--were incorporated into two-component and multicomponent Langmuir monolayers acting as a model of mitochondrial membrane. As the lipids characteristic for , phosphatidylcholine (POPC), phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE), and cardiolipin (BHCL) were chosen. Our studies were motivated by the fact that, according to the literature, the anticancer activity of PTs is correlated with their ability to incorporate into mitochondrial membrane and modify its properties. The undertaken studies were based on the surface pressure (π)-molecular area (A) isotherm registration complemented with the thermodynamic analysis and BAM visualization. It was found that all three terpenes with the exception of high  proportion (30 and 50%) interact beneficially with POPC in two-component monolayers, while incorporation of BAc and Urs into POPE film is energetically unfavorable. As far as the model mitochondrial membrane composed of POPC/POPE/BHCL is concerned, the largest destructive influence (high positive values of ΔG(Exc) and decrease of the model monolayer condensation) was found in the case of terpene acids, while the effect of α-amyrin was energetically favorable. We postulated that the origin of the observed findings is connected with the specific interactions between bolaamphlilic terpene acids and POPE, known from its propensity to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660842>Synthesis, Anticancer and Antibacterial Activity of Betulinic and Betulonic Acid C-28-Triphenylphosphonium Conjugates with Variable Alkyl Linker Length.</a></h1><p>Conjugation of triterpenoids such as  1 with Triphenylphosphonium (TPP) group is a powerful approach to generating medicinal compounds. Their development proposes structure optimization in respect of availability and activity towards target cells and organelles. Selection of 1 or its precursor betulonic acid 2 and the optimal linker is of particular importance for drug candidate identification among the TPP-triterpenoid conjugates.In this study new C-28-TPP conjugated derivatives of 1 and 2 with the alkyl/alkoxyalkyl linkers of variable length were synthesized and compared regarding their anticancer, antibacterial, and -targeted effects.The TPP conjugates of 1 and 2 [6a-f, 7a-f] were synthesized by the reaction of halogenalkyl esters [3a-f, 4a-f, 5] with triphenylphosphine in acetonitrile upon heating. Cytotoxicity (MTT assay), antibacterial activity (microdilution assay) and mitochondrial effects (flow cytofluorometry) were studied.Conjugation with the TPP group greatly increased cytotoxicity of the triterpenoids up to 30 times. The conjugates were up to 10-17 times more active against MCF-7 (IC50 = 0.17µM, 72h, 6c) and PC-3 (IC50 = 0.14µM, 72h, 6a) cancer cells than for human skin fibroblasts. Enhanced antibacterial (bactericidal) activity of the TPP-triterpenoid conjugates with MIC for Gram-positive bacteria as low as 2µM (6a, 7a) was for the first time revealed. The conjugates were found to effectively inhibit oxidation of 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin probe in cytosol, decrease transmembrane potential and increase superoxide radical level in .Relationships between the effects and structure of the TPP-triterpenoid conjugates were evaluated and are discussed.

The objective of this study was to investigate the potential splenocytes protective effect and underlying mechanism of BA using dexamethasone (Dex)-induced mice as a model system. Pretreatment with BA (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg) dose-dependently ameliorated Dex-induced oxidative damage and apoptosis after 14 days of feeding. In addition to reactive oxygen species scavenging activity in Dex-induced splenocytes, BA administration up-regulated antioxidant enzymes, decreased lipid peroxidation, restored mitochondrial function, decreased the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax, prevented the decline of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, inhibited caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation, and improved cell survival. These findings reveal that BA was able to mitigate Dex-induced oxidative stress and might play an important role in repairs of oxidative damage in immunological system.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

These were screened for their anticancer activity against different cancer cells and normal human PBMC by MTT assay. Compound 2c [(3S)-3-{2-(4-(hydroxymethyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)acetyloxy}-lup-20(29)-en-28-oic acid] was found as the most potent inhibitor of cell line HT-29 with IC50 value 14.9 μM. Its role as an inducer of apoptosis was investigated in this cell line by Annexin-V/PI binding assay and by following its capability for ROS generation, depolarization of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, activation of caspases, PARP cleavage, nuclear degradation and expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins. It exhibited much higher cytotoxicity than the standard drug 5-fluorouracil but showed negligible cytotoxicity towards normal PBMC. Elevated level of ROS generation, activation of caspase 3 and caspase 9, DNA fragmentation, higher expression of Bax and Bad, lower expression of Bcl2 and Bcl-xl, and increased level of Bax/Bcl-xl ratio identified 2c as a promising inducer of apoptosis that follows a mitochondria dependent pathway.

The present study was focused on deciphering the detailed molecular mechanism of BA-induced apoptosis. In the present study, results indicated that BA was highly effective against HeLa cells via induction of time-dependent apoptosis, and the authors demonstrated that the BA treatment acted through downregulating a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) subunit and suppressing the Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473 after increasing the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Then, BA induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, which was consistent with the cell cycle-related protein results in which BA significantly enhanced the expression of p27Kip and p21Waf1/Cip1 in HeLa cells. This target-specific inhibition was associated with mitochondrial apoptosis, as reflected by the increased expression of Bad and caspase-9, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the decline in mitochondrial membrane potential. Moreover, preincubation of the cells with glutathione (antioxidant) blocked the process of apoptosis, prevented the phosphorylation of downstream substrates. These results established that ROS acted as a key factor to effect apoptosis by BA treatment in HeLa cells. Therefore, these findings demonstrated that BA induced apoptosis in HeLa cells by downregulating the expression of PI3K/Akt signaling molecules via ROS, and triggering a mitochondrial pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28671831>-Targeted Lupane Triterpenoid Derivatives and Their Selective Apoptosis-Inducing Anticancer Mechanisms.</a></h1><p>Betulin and  have been widely studied for their anticancer activities.

For instance, normal cells take up fatty acids (FAs) from the circulation, while tumour cells generate their own and become dependent on de novo FA synthesis, which could provide a vulnerability to target tumour cells.  (BetA) is a natural compound that selectively kills tumour cells through an ill-defined mechanism that is independent of BAX and BAK, but depends on mitochondrial permeability transition-pore opening. Here we unravel this pathway and show that BetA inhibits the activity of steroyl-CoA-desaturase (SCD-1). This enzyme is overexpressed in tumour cells and critically important for cells that utilize de novo FA synthesis as it converts newly synthesized saturated FAs to unsaturated FAs. Intriguingly, we find that inhibition of SCD-1 by BetA or, alternatively, with a specific SCD-1 inhibitor directly and rapidly impacts on the saturation level of cardiolipin (CL), a mitochondrial lipid that has important structural and  functions and at the same time regulates mitochondria-dependent cell death. As a result of the enhanced CL saturation mitochondria of cancer cells, but not normal cells that do not depend on de novo FA synthesis, undergo ultrastructural changes, release cytochrome c and quickly induce cell death. Importantly, addition of unsaturated FAs circumvented the need for SCD-1 activity and thereby prevented BetA-induced CL saturation and subsequent cytotoxicity, supporting the importance of this novel pathway in the cytotoxicity induced by BetA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28033541>Rhodamine B conjugates of triterpenoic acids are cytotoxic mitocans even at nanomolar concentrations.</a></h1><p>Triterpenoic acids 1-6 exhibited very low or no cytotoxicity at all, but their corresponding 2,3-di-O-acetyl-piperazinyl amides 13-18 showed low EC values for several human tumor cell lines.

Evidence is accumulating that BA is cytotoxic against multiple types of human cancer cells; however, its effects on renal carcinoma cells remain obscure. This study aimed to evaluate the anticancer activity of BA in human renal cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. In the current study, we found that BA inhibited renal cancer cell proliferation in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner in vitro. Moreover, flow cytometry analysis revealed that BA affected the survival of renal cancer cells via the induction of apoptosis. Western blot analysis showed that the occurrence of apoptosis was associated with upregulation of Bcl2-associated X protein and cleaved caspase-3 and downregulation of B-cell lymphoma 2 in renal cancer cells. Additionally, BA treatment augmented the production of reactive oxygen species and induced a significant loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in renal cancer cells, suggesting that BA may trigger apoptosis via the -mediated apoptotic pathway. Furthermore, the migrative and invasive capabilities of renal cancer cells were markedly repressed by BA treatment, which was related to upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2, MMP9, and vimentin, and downregulation of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 and E-cadherin. Notably, administration of BA retarded tumor growth in 786-O-bearing mice in vivo.

However, the source of ROS overproduction and the role of  were poorly identified, and the weak in vivo antitumour activity of these compounds limits their development as drugs.Cytotoxicity was detected using MTT assays. In vivo anti-HCC effects were assessed using nude mice bearing HepG2 tumour xenografts. Cell cycle analysis, apoptosis rate and mitochondrial membrane potential were measured by flow cytometry. ROS production was detected using a microplate reader or a fluorescence microscope. Changes in gene and protein levels were measured by RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. Other assays were performed using related detection kits.B5G9, a piperazidine derivative of 23-hydroxy  (23-HBA), showed excellent in vivo anti-HCC effects, with a tumour growth inhibitory rate of greater than 80%, and no significant side effects. B5G9 stimulated the production of ROS, which were derived from the , but it had no effect on various other antioxidant systems. Moreover, B5G9 induced mitochondrial dysfunction, which was characterized by morphological changes, membrane potential collapse, membrane permeabilization, and decreases in the O consumption rate and ATP production. Furthermore, mtDNA-depleted ρ0 HepG2 cells were less sensitive to B5G9 treatment than wt HepG2 cells, indicating the importance of  in B5G9-induced cell death.We discovered a piperazidine derivative of 23-HBA, B5G9, with excellent anti-HCC effects both in vivo and in vitro and no obvious toxic effects. The underlying mechanism was associated with -derived ROS overproduction, and  played essential roles in B5G9-induced cell death. This study identified a potential agent for anti-HCC therapy and elucidated the -related mechanism of BA and its derivatives.</p></html>
