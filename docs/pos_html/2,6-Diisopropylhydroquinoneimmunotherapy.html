Previous work has described an association between CMV seropositivity and cardiovascular disease amongst patients with dialysis dependent end stage renal disease. Whether CMV seropositivity is associated with cardiovascular disease in non-dialysis dependent CKD has not been established.Investigate whether past CMV infection is associated with prevalent cardiovascular disease in patients with non-dialysis dependent CKD.A retrospective observational study using the Renal Impairment in Secondary Care (RIISC) cohort, a study evaluating bio-clinical determinants of outcomes in patients with progressive CKD.We assayed cryopreserved serum samples collected at inception for anti-CMV IgG antibodies from 764 patients with stages  to 5 CKD (pre-dialysis) and investigated its relationship with prevalent cardiovascular disease.Median eGFR was 24 ml/min/1.73m2 (IQR 19-32). Sixty-eight percent of patients were CMV seropositive. CMV seropositivity was associated with older age, non-Caucasian ethnicity, diabetes and higher social deprivation index score. On univariable analysis, CMV seropositivity correlated with higher systolic blood pressure (p = 0.044), prevalent cardiovascular disease (p < 0.001), ischaemic heart disease (p < 0.001) and cerebrovascular disease (p = 0.022). On multivariable analysis, CMV seropositive patients nearly twice as likely to have cardiovascular disease compared to seronegative patients (OR = 1.998, CI 1.231-3.242, p = 0.005).In patients with non-dialysis CKD, CMV seropositivity is independently associated with a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease.© The Author(s) 2019.

In this study, we explored the role of selenophosphate synthetase 1 (SEPHS1) in the pluripotency maintenance and reprogramming. We found that high level of SEPHS1 is retained in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells (ESCs), which is decreased during their differentiation. SEPHS1 knockdown significantly reduced reprogramming efficiency, proving that SEPHS1 is required for acquisition of pluripotency. However, SEPHS1 knockdown did not affect the expression of significant pluripotency genes, suggesting that SEPHS1 may be involved in the survival of pluripotent stem cells rather than in the regulation of pluripotency genes. Transcriptome analysis revealed altered expression of the gene set related to the ROS pathway and apoptosis in SEPHS1-knockdown cells. We also demonstrated the role of SEPHS1 in human ESC clonogenicity, and we found improved single-cell survival of hESCs by selenium treatment in a concentration-dependent manner. Our study implies that hSEPHS1 is a regulator of selenium-mediated redox-signaling in human pluripotent stem cells and plays a role in their survival.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Such agents could be given in combination or in sequence on the basis of previous response. We aimed to assess the clinical value of maximising responses by using therapeutic agents with different modes of action, the use of which is directed by the response to the initial combination therapy. We aimed to assess response-adapted intensification treatment with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (CVD) versus no intensification treatment in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who had a suboptimal response to initial immunomodulatory triplet treatment which was standard of care in the UK at the time of trial design.The Myeloma XI trial was an open-label, randomised, phase 3, adaptive design trial done at 110 National Health Service hospitals in the UK. There were three potential randomisations in the study: induction treatment, intensification treatment, and maintenance treatment. Here, we report the results of the randomisation to intensification treatment. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had symptomatic or non-secretory, newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, had completed their assigned induction therapy as per protocol (cyclophosphamide, thalidomide, and dexamethasone or cyclophosphamide, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone) and achieved a partial or minimal response. For the intensification treatment, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to cyclophosphamide (500 mg daily orally on days 1, 8, and 15), bortezomib (1·3 mg/m subcutaneously or intravenously on days 1, 4, 8, and 11), and dexamethasone (20 mg daily orally on days 1, , 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12) up to a maximum of eight cycles of 21 days or no treatment. Patients were stratified by allocated induction treatment, response to induction treatment, and centre. The co-primary endpoints were progression-free survival and overall survival, assessed from intensification randomisation to data cutoff, analysed by intention to treat. Safety analysis was per protocol. This study is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN49407852, and clinicaltrialsregister.eu, number 2009-010956-93, and has completed recruitment.Between Nov 15, 2010, and July 28, 2016, 583 patients were enrolled to the intensification randomisation, representing 48% of the 1217 patients who achieved partial or minimal response after initial induction therapy. 289 patients were assigned to CVD treatment and 294 patients to no treatment. After a median follow-up of 29·7 months (IQR 17·0-43·5), median progression-free survival was 30 months (95% CI 25-36) with CVD and 20 months (15-28) with no CVD (hazard ratio [HR] 0·60, 95% CI 0·48-0·75, p<0·0001), and 3-year overall survival was 77·3% (95% Cl 71·0-83·5) in the CVD group and 78·5% (72·3-84·6) in the no CVD group (HR 0·98, 95% CI 0·67-1·43, p=0·93). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events for patients taking CVD were haematological, including neutropenia (18 [7%] patients), thrombocytopenia (19 [7%] patients), and anaemia (8 [3%] patients). No deaths in the CVD group were deemed treatment related.Intensification treatment with CVD significantly improved progression-free survival in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and a suboptimal response to immunomodulatory induction therapy compared with no intensification treatment, but did not improve overall survival. The manageable safety profile of this combination and the encouraging results support further investigation of response-adapted approaches in this setting. The substantial number of patients not entering this trial randomisation following induction therapy, however, might support the use of combination therapies upfront to maximise response and improve outcomes as is now the standard of care in the UK.Cancer Research UK, Celgene, Amgen, Merck, Myeloma UK.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Although several studies have examined the risk of OFCs, little has been reported on allergic reactions during OFCs depending on the indication. This study assessed the prevalence, severity and treatment of allergic reactions depending on the indication for OFCs.We performed a prospective multicenter study between March 2012 and May 2013. Severity of symptoms elicited by OFCs was classified according to grading of anaphylaxis that ranges from grade 1 (most mild) to grade 5 (most severe).A total of 5062 cases (median age, 3.8 years; males, 65.%) were analyzed. Allergic reactions were elicited in 2258 (44.6%) OFCs, of which 991 (43.9%) were classified as grade 1, 736 (32.6%) were classified as grade , 340 (15.1%) were classified as grade 3, and 191 (8.5%) were classified as grade 4-5. Epinephrine was administered in 7.1% (n=160) of positive OFCs. Among the top three most common food allergens (hen's egg, cow's milk, and wheat), severity differed significantly depending on the indication for OFC, and adjusted standardized residuals indicated that severity of allergic reactions was higher for the indication to assess threshold level for oral . In addition, the prevalence of epinephrine use was highest for the indication to determine safe intake quantity.Our study suggested that prevalence, severity, and treatment of allergic reactions differ depending on the indication for OFC. Further studies are needed to determine differences in risks depending on the indication for OFC.© 2019 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

Conventional subcutaneous  (SCIT) and sublingual  (SLIT) cannot meet patients' needs owing to the side effects caused by both the use of conventional whole antigen molecules in the pollen extract and the administration routes. To address these issues, a surface-modified antigen and transcutaneous administration route are introduced in this research. First, the pollen extract (PE) was conjugated to galactomannan (PE-GM) to mask immunoglobulin E (IgE)-binding epitopes in the PE to avoid side effects. Second, as a safer alternative to SCIT and SLIT, transcutaneous  (TCIT) with a solid-in-oil (S/O) nanodispersion system carrying PE-GM was proposed. Hydrophilic PE-GM was efficiently delivered through mouse skin using S/O nanodispersions, reducing the antibody secretion and modifying the type 1 T helper (Th1)/ type  T helper (Th2) balance in the mouse model, thereby demonstrating the potential to alleviate Japanese cedar pollinosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31567703>Sarcoid-like Reaction Discovered on EBUS-TBNA of Intrathoracic Lymph Nodes During  for Metastatic Melanoma.</a></h1><p>The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors has dramatically improved outcomes for patients with advanced melanoma and other malignancies. Checkpoint inhibitors are associated with a unique set of toxicities collectively known as immune-related adverse events, the incidence of which is rising in parallel with their increasing use in clinical practice. Immune-related adverse events are widely variable in their presentation and can affect virtually any organ system in the body. Sarcoid-like reactions in patients being treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors are rare and are typically multisystemic in nature with isolated pulmonary involvement representing only a small minority of cases reported in the literature. Herein we describe  patients who developed progressively enlarging lymphadenopathy while receiving checkpoint inhibitors for metastatic melanoma. Both patients were initially noted to have an excellent clinical response to  but their treatment was interrupted pending further investigation as they were suspected to have progressive disease. They were ultimately diagnosed with sarcoid-like reactions after an endobronchial ultrasound-guided lymph node biopsy revealed noncaseating granulomas and were able to resume their  without any further interventions or negative effect on their disease course. These  cases illustrate the importance of obtaining a tissue diagnosis when imaging reveals enlarging lymph nodes while on  for solid malignancies as the differential diagnosis includes benign entities such as sarcoid-like reactions in addition to disease progression. Timely diagnosis through minimally invasive tissue sampling techniques, such as endobronchial ultrasound, can help rule out malignant etiologies of lymphadenopathy and minimize interruptions in treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649889>Vitiligo Adverse Event Observed in a Patient With Durable Complete Response After Nivolumab for Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma.</a></h1><p> Renal cell carcinoma is the third most prevalent urological cancer worldwide and about 30% of patients present with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Systemic treatments for metastatic renal cell carcinoma have improved recently. Vascular endothelial growth factor targeting therapies were the previous standard of care. However, immune checkpoint inhibitors used in second line therapy have now been shown to improve patient survival. We report a case of metastatic renal cell carcinoma with nivolumab as a second-line therapy after progression with tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Unusual adverse events in metastatic renal cell carcinoma, such as vitiligo, were observed in this patient who developed a remarkable documented pathological complete response to his renal tumor.  A 60-year-old caucasian male was diagnosed with a pulmonary metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Sunitinib was used as first line treatment without success. He received nivolumab in second-line treatment. He developed several immune-related adverse events, most notably vitiligo. The patient had a radiological complete response on metastatic sites, with a significant decrease of renal tumor volume and underwent cytoreductive nephrectomy after  years of treatment, confirming the pathological complete response. The patient remains disease-free for 10 months without further systemic therapy after nivolumab discontinuation.  Pathological complete response with nivolumab in metastatic renal cell carcinoma is rare. This case further highlights the potentially predictive role of immune-related adverse events during nivolumab therapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma and raises questions concerning the role of nephrectomy after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Further studies are needed to better identify predictive factors for treatment response to  in metastatic renal cell carcinoma, and to better understand the role of nephrectomy after nivolumab treatment.Copyright © 2019 Billon, Walz, Brunelle, Thomassin, Salem, Guerin, Vicier, Dermeche, Albiges, Tantot, Nenan, Pignot and Gravis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602268>Targeting  for bladder cancer by using anti-CD3 × CD155 bispecific antibody.</a></h1><p>To investigate whether CD155 is an attractive target for T cell-mediated  against human bladder cancer, we examined the novel bispecific antibody anti-CD3 x anti-CD155 (CD155Bi-Ab) for its ability to redirect activated T cells (ATCs) to target bladder cancer cells was examined. Expression of CD155 was detected by flow cytometry on the surface of bladder cancer cells, including T24 and Pumc-91 cells, and their chemotherapeutic drug-resistant counterparts. ATCs generated from healthy donors were stimulated with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody and interleukin- (IL-) for 14 days. The cytotoxic activity of ATCs armed with CD155Bi-Ab against bladder cancer cells was detected by LDH and luciferase quantitative assay. Furthermore, ATCs generated from bladder cancer patients were also armed with CD155Bi-Ab to verity the cell killing by the same methods. In contrast to unarmed ATCs, CD155Bi-armed ATCs against bladder cancer cells were increased cytotoxic activity at effector/target (E/T) ratios of 5:1, 10:1, and 20:1, with more IFN-γ, TNF-α secreting. It is worth noting that in spite of the presence of immunosuppression in bladder cancer patients and the drug resistance in chemotherapeutic drug-resistant cancer cell lines, not only the anti-tumor effect of CD155Bi-armed ATCs generated from bladder cancer patients still showed significantly but only higher level of activation marker CD69 was expressed. Taken together, our results suggest that CD155 is an effective target for the CD155-positive bladder cancer. And CD155Bi-Ab-armed ATCs are promisingly to provide a novel strategy for current CD155-positive bladder cancer therapy.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31605507>Localization of PD-L1 on single cancer cells by iSERS microscopy with Au/Au core/satellite nanoparticles.</a></h1><p>Programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is an important predictive biomarker. The detection of PD-L1 can be crucial for patients with advanced cancer where the use of  is considered. Here, we demonstrate the use of immuno-SERS microscopy (iSERS) for localizing PD-L1 on single cancer SkBr-3 cells. A central advantage of iSERS is that the disturbing autofluorescence from cells and tissues can be efficiently minimized by red to near-infrared laser excitation. In this study we employed Au/Au core/satellite nanoparticles as SERS nanotags because of their remarkable signal brightness and colloidal stability upon red laser excitation. False-color iSERS images of the positive and negative controls clearly reveal the specific localization of PD-L1 with SERS nanotag-labeled antibodies. This article is protected by copyright.

Novel insights on molecular mechanisms and regimens to enhance the efficacy of  are warranted, as only a minority of patients (˜20%) respond to checkpoint blockade. Taking into account the multiple mechanisms adopted by tumor cells to evade the immune system through cancer immunoediting, the frontline combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors with chemotherapy appears to be a successful strategy as: 1) it enhances the recognition and elimination of tumor cells by the host immune system (immunogenic cell-death), and ) it reduces the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Remarkably, the immune checkpoint inhibitors pembrolizumab and atezolizumab have already been approved by the FDA in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC and many other chemo-immunotherapeutic regimens have been evaluated as an initial therapeutic approach in metastatic NSCLC. Concurrently, several preclinical studies are evaluating the molecular mechanisms underlying immunomodulation by conventional chemotherapeutic agents (platinum salts, antimitotic agents, antimetabolites and anthracyclines), unraveling drug- and dose/schedule-dependent effects on the immune system that should be exploited to achieve synergistic clinical activity. The current review provides a detailed overview of the immunobiological rationale and molecular basis for combining immune checkpoint inhibitors with chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced NSCLC. Moreover, current evidence and future perspectives towards a better selection of patients who are more likely to benefit from chemo- combinations are discussed.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Animal models demonstrate that T lymphocytes may mediate analgesia by producing endogenous opioids, but definitive clinical data are limited. Transfer of ex vivo adoptive cellular therapy (ACT) is being tested as an anticancer therapy. We retrospectively reviewed the medical charts of 357 patients with various malignancies who received 3 intravenous infusions of autologous cytokine-activated T-cell-enriched products. Among these were 55 patients who required opioids for moderate or severe cancer-related pain. Opioid dosage and cancer pain score were recorded daily for  consecutive weeks before and  weeks after the ACT infusions. The average oral morphine equivalent doses and cancer pain scores were significantly decreased after the ACT infusions. The proportion of patients with breakthrough pain also declined. Moreover, higher frequencies of expanded CD3, CD3/CD4, and CD3/CD8 T cells within the ACT product were associated with favorable analgesic effects. Transient elevations in CD3 and CD3/CD8T-cell subpopulations and decreases in CD4CD25 Treg were observed in patients' blood after the ACT. In conclusion, ACT was capable of reducing cancer pain severity and opioid consumption and favorably modulating peripheral blood T-cell populations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672558>Effectiveness of Multi-Prognostic Index in older patients with advanced malignancies treated with .</a></h1><p>Older adults with cancer are less likely to be offered treatment for cost-benefit concern.

In addition to routine oncological evaluation, each patient received a comprehensive geriatric assessment with MPI calculation. Overall survival (Cox-adjusted curve) was stratified by tertiles of MPI score. Drug toxicity was assessed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (Version 4.03: June 14, 2010).Seventy-nine patients [26.6% women, mean age (±SD) 74.0 ± 6.1 years] were enrolled with the following diagnosis: melanoma (51.9%), non-small cell lung cancer (25.3%), renal cell cancer (12.7%), urothelial cancer (8.9%) and Merkel cell carcinoma (1.%).

Until 2006, non-specific  with high dose interleukin- (HD IL-) was considered as standard therapy of mccRCC. The transition from cytokine to targeted therapy, and now to novel immunotherapeutic agents, significantly increased the overall survival (OS) of patients with mccRCC. Currently, 7 targeted agents and the combination of nivolumab/ipilimumab (immune checkpoint inhibitors, ICIs) have been approved as first-line therapy for mccRCC. Based on evidence from randomized phase III clinical trials, sunitinib and pazopanib (Tyrosine kinase inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGF-TKIs) are the most effective first-line options, especially in favorable and indermediate risk patients. Nivolumab/ipilimumab (dual checkpoint inhibitors) seem to be the preferred first-line therapy in poor-risk patients, although cabozantinib, temsirolimus, sunitinib and pazopanib are also recommended. HD IL- remains a reasonable first-line treatment option in selected, favorable-risk younger patients with good performance status. Based on data of previous phase I and II studies, several phase III trials investigating the efficacy and safety of the combination of ICI/VEGF-TKI versus sunitinib in untreated mccRCC are currently underway. These emerging therapies include the combinations of pembrolizumab/lenvatinib, pembrolizumab/axitinib, avelumab/axitinib and atezolizumab/ bevacizu-mab and seem to introduce the mccRCC therapy in a new auspicious era. Moreover, emerging new targeted therapies and other, beyond ICIs, immunotherapies are currently underway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618420>Recurrent glioblastoma versus late posttreatment changes: diagnostic accuracy of O-(-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine positron emission tomography (18F-FET PET).</a></h1><p>Diagnostic accuracy in previous studies of O-(-[18F]-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (18F-FET) PET in patients with suspected recurrent glioma may be influenced by prolonged dynamic PET acquisitions, heterogeneous populations, different non-standard-of-care therapies, and PET scans performed at different time points post radiotherapy. We investigated the diagnostic accuracy of a 20-minute 18F-FET PET scan in MRI-suspected recurrent glioblastoma 6 months after standard radiotherapy and its ability to prognosticate overall survival (OS).In total, 146 glioblastoma patients with 168 18F-FET PET scans were reviewed retrospectively. Patients with MRI responses to bevacizumab or undergoing re-irradiation or  after 18F-FET PET were excluded. Maximum and mean tumor-to-background ratios (TBRmax, TBRmean) and biological tumor volume (BTV) were recorded and verified by histopathology or clinical/radiological follow-up. Thresholds of 18F-FET parameters were determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Prognostic factors were investigated in Cox proportional hazards models.Surgery was performed after 104 18F-FET PET scans, while clinical/radiological surveillance was used following 64, identifying 152 glioblastoma recurrences and 16 posttreatment changes. ROC analysis yielded thresholds of .0 for TBRmax, 1.8 for TBRmean, and 0.55 cm3 for BTV in differentiating recurrent glioblastoma from posttreatment changes with the best performance of TBRmax (sensitivity 99%, specificity 94%; P < 0.0001) followed by BTV (sensitivity 98%, specificity 94%; P < 0.0001). Using these thresholds, 166 18F-FET PET scans were correctly classified. Increasing BTV was associated with shorter OS (P < 0.0001).A 20-minute 18F-FET PET scan is a powerful tool to distinguish posttreatment changes from recurrent glioblastoma 6-month postradiotherapy, and predicts OS.© The Author(s) 2019.

The emergence of broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance in S. aureus has made the treatment process more difficult. Therefore, it is obvious that an effective prevention strategy against the pathogen could significantly reduce costs related to care in hospitals. In this report, we describe a simple approach to conjugate S. aureus capsular polysaccharide 5 (CP5) from S. aureus Reynolds strain and 8 (CP8) from S. aureus Becker strain to a fusion protein (Hla-MntC-SACOL0723) and investigation of its bioactivity. The conjugation was done by using ADH (as a bridge) and EDAC (as a coupling agent). The immunoconjugates were characterized by routine polysaccharide/protein contents assays followed by reverse phase chromatography and FTIR spectroscopy. The groups of mice were immunized with conjugate vaccines, capsular polysaccharides, and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as a control group. The functional activity of the vaccine candidates was evaluated by ELISA, opsonophagocytosis tests, and determination of bacterial load in challenge study. The results showed that the specific antibody (total IgG) titers raised against conjugate molecules were higher than those of the nonconjugated capsular polysaccharides. The opsonic activity of the conjugate vaccines antisera was significantly higher than polysaccharides alone (58% reduction in the number of bacteria versus 16.3% at 1: dilution, p < .05), Further, the conjugate vaccine group had a significant reduction in bacterial load after challenge with S. aureus COL strain cells as compared to the PBS and nonconjugated controls. In conclusion, the immunoconjugates could be developed as a potential vaccine candidate against S. aureus.© 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31570447>Expression of Immune Checkpoint Receptors on T-Cells and Their Ligands on Leukemia Blasts in Childhood Acute Leukemia.</a></h1><p>Possible correlations between the expression of immune checkpoint molecules and prognosis in childhood acute leukemia were investigated.The expression of programmed-death 1 (PD1), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), and B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) was determined by flow cytometry on peripheral αβ and γδ T-cells from patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n=9) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n=12), and from healthy volunteers (n=7).

The expression of CTLA-4 on γδ T-cells and the B7- ligand on blasts was higher in patients with high-risk ALL (p=0.02 and 0.02, respectively). In AML, PD1 expression on αβ T-cells was higher in the intermediate-risk group (p=0.05), whereas HVEM expression was significantly higher in the low-risk group (p=0.02). Expression of CTLA-4 on γδ+ T-cells and PD-L1 on blasts were both associated with poor relapse-free survival outcomes in ALL (p=0.049).The higher expression of immune checkpoint molecules, in particular, CTLA-4 and PD-L1 are associated with a poorer prognosis in ALL, suggesting that selective use of the immune checkpoint blockade might improve the clinical outcomes in patients with ALL.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

In this study we evaluated the potential of microneedles to deliver peanut protein extract (PE) into skin and assessed if the ensuing immune responses could desensitize mice that were sensitized to peanuts. Peanut sensitized mice were either treated through cutaneous  using PE-coated microneedles or not treated, and then orally challenged with PE. After oral challenge, the clinical symptoms of peanut-induced anaphylaxis were significantly lower in the microneedle treated mice as compared to untreated mice, and this was accompanied by down-regulation of systemic anaphylaxis mediators such as histamine and mast cell protease-1 (MCPT-1) in the microneedles treated group. Overall, there was an up-regulation of Th1 cytokines (IL- and IFN-γ) as compared to Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-5) in splenocyte culture supernatants of the microneedle treated group as compared to untreated group, suggesting that microneedles promoted immune modulation towards the Th1 pathway. Furthermore, mice treated with PE-coated microneedles were observed to retain integrity of their small intestine villi and had reduced eosinophilic infiltration as compared to the untreated but peanut sensitized mice, which further confirmed the desensitization capability of peanut cutaneous  using coated microneedles. Thus, our current study represents a novel minimally invasive microneedle based cutaneous , which may provide a novel route of desensitization for the treatment of peanut allergies.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The effects of mPRSon and PRW on the expression of morphological change, surface molecules, phagocytic activity, and cytokine release in BMDCs were determined by flow cytometry and a mouse cytokine array. The results showed that both mPRSon and PRW could induce phenotypic and functional maturation of BMDCs. At the same time, mPRSon upregulated the expression of membrane phenotypic marker CD86 and PRW markedly upregulated CD40, CD80, and CD86. In addition, mPRSon could bind to the dectin-1 receptor and stimulate the release of MIP-1α, MIP-, and IL-, while PRW could bind to complement receptor 3 and toll-like receptor  with an upregulation of the expression of IL-, IL-6, MIP-1α, MIP-, RANTES, IL-12p40p70, IL-12p70, TIMP-1, IFN-γ, KC, MCP-1, and GCSF. The study provides additional information on how structural differences in sclerotial polysaccharides influence their immunomodulatory activities on BMDCs involving different PAMP receptors. It is anticipated that more understanding of the interactions between the sclerotial polysaccharides and their receptors in immune cells can facilitate their future application for cancer .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31578023>Effectiveness and Safety of Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Low-Dose Oral  with Low Allergen Egg-Containing Cookies for Severe Hen's Egg Allergy: A Single-Center Analysis.</a></h1><p>The usefulness of low-dose oral  (OIT) for the treatment of egg allergy has been unclear.To evaluate the efficacy and safety of OIT with low allergen cookies (LACs) containing a low dose of hen's egg.Thirty-three patients with severe hen's egg allergy were randomly administered either OIT with LACs (n = 21) or placebo (n = 12). Two patients in the LACs group withdrew before completing OIT. The primary endpoint was the number of good responders (G-R), patients with negative results in the oral food challenge (OFC) with a final dose of  g hard-boiled egg whites after 4 months of OIT, in each group. Total OFC Aichi score for anaphylaxis/cumulative protein dose (TS/Pro) as the marker of severity of food allergy was also compared. Adverse events during OIT were evaluated using patients' diaries.The proportion of G-R in the LACs group was higher than in the placebo group (7/19 [37%] vs. 1/12 [8%], χ test; p = 0.077). The TS/Pro after OIT in the LACs group was lower than in the placebo group (median score, 44. vs. 104.1, p = 0.059; Mann-Whitney U test). The threshold and TS/Pro before and after OIT significantly improved in the LACs group (p = 0.015, p = 0.027, respectively; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). There were 99 recorded incidences of symptoms of 1,938 intake events in the LACs group during OIT. Of these, 90 were mild; no severe symptoms occurred.OIT with LACs potentially increases the OFC threshold and decreases allergy severity and is a relatively safe treatment modality.© 2019 S.

In May 2018, 718 HCWs from the department related to the diagnosis and treatment of influenza in 17 hospitals (6 tertiary hospitals, 5 secondary hospitals and 6 primary hospitals) from Guangzhou, Jiangmen, Zhuhai and Dongguan were selected by using stratified sampling method. Questionnaire survey and face-to-face interview were used to collect the information of influenza vaccination, the intention of the quadrivalent influenza vaccine, the acceptance of free and required vaccination policies, and recommendations for increasing influenza vaccination intentions from 2015 to 2017. The multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze factors associated with the vaccination intention.  A total of 718 HCWs were surveyed and 147 of them were interviewed face to face. Among them, the vaccination rate of primary hospitals [17.39%(40/230)] was higher than that of other hospitals (χ()=15.80, 0.05). If the vaccine could be free, 84.82% (609/718) of HCWs would like to be vaccinated. The multivariate logistic regression showed that the factors, HCWs who were aged ≥50 years (3.44, 95:1.43-8.28), worked in department of prevention and health care (.35, 95:1.16-4.75), learned about the quadrivalent influenza vaccine (.94, 95:.08-4.18), knowed that HCWs are priority (.33, 95:1.56-3.48), and had a history of trivalent influenza vaccination from 2015 to 2017 (4.70, 95:3.08-7.15), were associated with the vaccination intention.

However, the therapeutic efficacy is still very limited for solid tumors. An immunosuppressive microenvironment is one of the main reasons for the limited efficacy. Some chemotherapeutic agents exhibit immune microenvironment modulation. Therefore, combination with chemotherapeutic agents may be one of the promising strategies to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of CAR-T against solid tumors. Sunitinib modulates the antitumor immune response by improving T-cell infiltration and function while reducing immunosuppressive factors. The authors constructed a second-generation CAR targeting human renal cell carcinoma (RCC)-specific antigen carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) with the costimulatory domain of 4-1BB. The results of cytokine releasing and cell killing assays showed that the CAIX-CAR-T cells have specific effector functions against CAIX renal cancer cells in vitro. Combination therapy with CAIX-CAR-T and sunitinib showed synergistic efficacy against a mouse lung metastasis model of human RCC. CAIX-CAR-T cells in the mice of the combination therapy group showed stronger proliferation and tumor infiltration than that in the mice of the CAIX-CAR-T monotherapy group. The possible mechanisms of the synergistic efficacy are: (1) sunitinib caused upregulation of CAIX in tumor cells; () sunitinib decreased frequency of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the tumor microenvironment. Our study supplied an innovative immunotherapeutic approach whereby combining CAIX-CAR-T with sunitinib induces a potent antitumor response in an experimental model of metastatic RCC. The combination strategy should be considered as a potential approach to augment adoptive CAR-T cell .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581055>Safety and efficacy of nivolumab in challenging subgroups with advanced melanoma who progressed on or after ipilimumab treatment: A single-arm, open-label, phase II study (CheckMate 172).</a></h1><p>Limited data are available on nivolumab in challenging subgroups with advanced melanoma.

Not unexpectedly, the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to James P. Allison and Tasuku Honjo for their development of cancer therapy by the blockade of co-inhibitory signals. Unfortunately, manipulation of the co-inhibitory receptors has also resulted in a safety issue: widespread iatrogenic immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Autoimmunity is emerging as the nemesis of . Originally, it was assumed that CTLA-4 blockade selectively targets T cells relevant to the antitumour immune response. However, an uncontrolled pan T cell activation was induced compromising tolerance to healthy self-tissues. The irAEs are very similar to that of a chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) reaction following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). We hypothesized that ipilimumab induced a graft-versus-malignancy (GVM) effect, which eradicated metastatic melanoma in a minority of patients, but also involved an auto-GVHD reaction that resulted in widespread autoimmunity in the majority. Therefore, we argued for a profound theoretical point against the consensus of experts. The task is not to desperately put the genie back in the bottle by immune-suppressive treatments, but instead to harness the autoimmune forces. In this way, the same goal could be achieved by an antibody as by the adoptive transfer of alloreactive donor lymphocytes, but without severe GVHD.

As randomized clinical trials with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have not been performed in patients with metastatic UM, we analyzed the real-world outcomes in a nationwide population-based study. Clinical data of patients with UM were extracted from the Danish Metastatic Melanoma database, a nationwide database containing unselected records of patients diagnosed with metastatic melanoma in Denmark. Survival before (pre-ICI,  = 32) and after (post-ICI,  = 94) the approval of first-line treatment with ICI was analyzed. A partial response to first-line treatment was observed in 7% of patients treated with anti-programmed cell death protein (PD)-1 monotherapy and in 21% with combined anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)-4 plus anti-PD-1 therapy. Median progression-free survival was .5 months for patients treated in the pre-ICI era compared to 3.5 months in the post-ICI era (hazard ratio (HR) 0.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28-0.67;  < 0.001). The estimated one-year overall survival rate increased from 25.0% to 41.9% and the median overall survival improved from 7.8 months to 10.0 months, respectively (HR 0.52; 95% CI 0.34-0.79;  = 0.003). Thus, the introduction of ICI as first-line treatment appears to have significantly improved the real-world survival of patients with metastatic UM, despite relatively low response rates compared to cutaneous melanoma.

We studied 390 patients who received atezolizumab as part of the POPLAR or OAK trial, and analyzed the differences in baseline characteristics, outcomes and genetic mutations in blood samples between Asian and white patients. Overall survival (OS) was longer in Asian compared to white patients (median OS: 18.7 vs. 11.1 months; p = 0.005). Race was identified as an independent prognostic factor for OS (Asian vs. white: hazard ratio 0.647, 95% confidence interval 0.447-0.936, p = 0.021), together with performance status, histology, baseline sum of the longest tumor diameters (BLSLD) and number of metastatic sites. The two groups also differed in terms of characteristics including smoking history, BLSLD, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation frequency, programmed death-ligand 1 expression and blood-based tumor-mutation burden. Blood mutations of STK11, EGFR, KEAP1, POLE, GRM3, ATM and STAG2 were associated with treatment response, and TP53, KEAP1, APC, RB1, CREBBP, EPHA5 and STAG2 mutations were associated with OS.

Although immune-related adverse events (irAEs) associated with nivolumab are largely tolerable, severe irAEs have occurred in some patients. However, the mechanisms underlying the development of irAEs are not fully clarified.We report  patients with metastatic melanoma who developed colitis, an irAEs caused by nivolumab. Both patients experienced colitis after nivolumab administration. Pathological examination of the colon showed robust infiltration of CD8 cells and T-bet expressing CD4 cells in both cases, indicating helper T cells (Th) 1 to be responsible for the dominant response. Additionally, we observed the serum C-reactive protein level (CRP) as well as interleukin-6 (IL-6) reflected the clinical course of irAEs clearly in the two cases.Our two cases suggested that the development of irAEs due to nivolumab is associated with Th1 dominant response.

Dysfunction of miRNAs is a major cause of aberrant expression of IRs and contributes to the immune escape of cancer cells. How miRNAs regulate immune checkpoint proteins in breast cancer remains largely unknown. In this study, downregulation of miRNAs was observed in PD-1-overexpressing CD8 T cells using miRNA array analysis of mouse breast cancer homografts. The data reveal that miR-149-3p was predicted to bind the 3'UTRs of mRNAs encoding T-cell inhibitor receptors PD-1, TIM-3, BTLA and Foxp1. Treatment of CD8 T cells with an miR-149-3p mimic reduced apoptosis, attenuated changes in mRNA markers of T-cell exhaustion and downregulated mRNAs encoding PD-1, TIM-3, BTLA and Foxp1. On the other hand, T-cell proliferation and secretion of effector cytokines indicative of increased T-cell activation (IL-, TNF-α, IFN-γ) were upregulated after miR-149-3p mimic treatment. Moreover, the treatment with a miR-149-3p mimic promoted the capacity of CD8 T cells to kill targeted 4T1 mouse breast tumour cells.

Functional TCR subunit genes are formed by somatic rearrangement, and some of the resulting TCRs recognize autoantigens, the body's own molecules. The autoreactive T cells that carry such TCRs pose a threat of inducing immune reactions against their own organism. In the course of the immune system's development, some autoreactive T lymphocytes are eliminated by apoptosis, some differentiate into immunosuppressive regulatory T cells, which support immunological tolerance to autoantigens, and the rest fall into a non-functional state of anergy. Suppression of effector T cells by regulatory T cells is mediated by immunosuppressive cytokines and costimulatory molecules, depletion of stimulating IL-, removal of autoreactive peptides together with MHC molecules, and in other ways. Impairment of self-tolerance leads to autoimmune diseases. However, the loss of immunological tolerance can be employed in tumor treatment, allowing  and the use of the potential of autoreactive effector T cells.

In general, these drugs fall into two categories: anti-angiogenic agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Anti-angiogenic agents currently approved by the FDA and/or EMA for advanced NSCLC treatment include bevacizumab, nintedanib, and ramucirumab. Anlotinib has been approved in advanced NSCLC by Chinese Food and Drug Administration (CFDA). These anti-angiogenic agents can induce anti-angiogenesis by targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF2 or inhibiting multiple small molecules involved in angiogenic and proliferative pathways such as platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) and fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs). Although these drugs show significant therapeutic efficacy, most patients inevitably experience disease progression resulting in death. ICIs approved by the FDA and/or EMA for advanced NSCLC treatment include nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab. These ICIs can significantly improve efficacy compared with standard chemotherapy by targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) receptor or PD- receptor with longer response duration and acceptable toxicity. However, the response rate of ICIs is suboptimal, and only a few patients ultimately benefit from .

Increasing antibiotic resistance has severely limited treatment options. A mechanism that Neisseria gonorrhoeae uses to evade complement attack is binding of the complement inhibitor C4b-binding protein (C4BP). We screened 107 PorB1a and 83 PorB1b clinical isolates randomly selected from a Swedish strain collection over the last 10 years and noted that 96/107 (89.7%) PorB1a and 16/83 (19.3%) PorB1b bound C4BP; C4BP binding significantly correlated with the ability to evade complement-dependent killing (r = 0.78; p<0.0001). We designed two chimeric proteins that fused C4BP domains to the backbone of immunoglobulins IgG or IgM (C4BP-IgG; C4BP-IgM) with the aim of enhancing complement activation and killing of gonococci. Both proteins bound gonococci (Kd C4BP-IgM = .4 nM; Kd C4BP-IgG 981 nM), but only hexameric C4BP-IgM efficiently out-competed heptameric C4BP from bacterial surface resulting in enhanced complement deposition and bacterial killing. Furthermore, C4BP-IgM significantly attenuated the duration and burden of colonization of two C4BP-binding gonococcal isolates, but not a C4BP non-binding strain in the mouse vaginal colonization model using human factor H/C4BP transgenic mice.

Recently, a lot of effort has been put into assessing the potential of gram-positive strains such as lactic acid bacteria for new applications in the production of heterologous proteins. Ama r  is a respiratory allergen from Amaranthus retroflexus, whose recombinant production in the probiotic host could be introduced as a specific and effective way to rapid diagnosis and  of this allergy. Consequently, the production of this recombinant protein using the prokaryotic system, requires a suitable SP to protect disulfide bonds and to prevent misfolding.

In this study, 42 signal sequences were selected from SP databases and the most important features of them were evaluated. First, n, h and c regions of the SPs and their probabilities were investigated by signalP software version 4.1. Then, their physicochemical properties were evaluated by Portparam and SOLpro.

The aim of the current study was to investigate the impact of Exo-PD-L1 and soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and explore the concordance between Exo-PD-L1 and PD-L1 expression in matched tumor tissues in NSCLC patients.85 consecutive patients from April 2017 to December 2017 at General Hospital of Eastern Command Theatre who were primarily diagnosed with NSCLC and 27 healthy individuals were enrolled in this study. Two milliliters of whole blood samples were collected from each participant and further centrifuged. Exosomes were derived from serum using the commercial kit (Total Exosome Isolation Kit), which was further identified by Western blotting analysis (CD63/TSG101), transmission electron microscope analysis (TEM) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). Exosomes were next solubilized for Exo-PD-L1 detection by enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA). PD-L1 expression in matched tissue were assessed by PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) (clone 28-8) assay. Tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥ 1% was deemed as "positive" in this study and TPS < 1% was deemed as "negative". Written informed consent were obtained before acquisition of all data and biological sample. Data were analyzed using SPSS 20.0 and Graphpad Prism 5 software. Chi square test was conducted to estimate the correlation between Exo-PD-L1 levels, sPD-L1 levels, PD-L1 IHC profiles and clinicopathological features. For all analysis, a two-sided p < 0.05 was considered significant statistically.Exo-PD-L1 levels were higher in NSCLC patients with advanced tumor stage, larger tumor size (> .5 cm) (p < 0.001), positive lymph node status (p < 0.05) and distant metastasis (p < 0.05). In contrast, sPD-L1 levels were not different between NSCLC patients and healthy donors, it was not correlated with any clinicopathologic features except for tumor size (> .5 cm) (p < 0.05). In addition, Exo-PD-L1 levels showed slight correlation with sPD-L1 levels (Spearman's correlation at r = 0.3, p = 0.0027) while no correlation with PD-L1 IHC profiles was detected.In conclusion, Exo-PD-L1, but not sPD-L1, was correlated with NSCLC disease progression, including tumor size, lymph node status, metastasis and TNM stage. However, Exo-PD-L1 was not associated with PD-L1 IHC status.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639039>Efficacy and tolerability of anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody (Avelumab) treatment in advanced thymoma.</a></h1><p>Thymic epithelial tumors are PD-L1-expressing tumors of thymic epithelial origin characterized by varying degrees of lymphocytic infiltration and a predisposition towards development of paraneoplastic autoimmunity. PD-1-targeting antibodies have been evaluated, largely in patients with thymic carcinoma. We sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the anti-PD-L1 antibody, avelumab (MSB0010718C), in patients with relapsed, advanced thymic epithelial tumors and conduct correlative immunological studies.Seven patients with thymoma and one patient with thymic carcinoma were enrolled in a phase I, dose-escalation trial of avelumab (MSB0010718C), and treated with avelumab at doses of 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg every  weeks until disease progression or development of intolerable side effects. Tissue and blood immunological analyses were conducted.Two of seven (29%) patients with thymoma had a confirmed Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors-defined partial response, two (29%) had an unconfirmed partial response and three patients (two thymoma; one thymic carcinoma) had stable disease (43%). Three of four responses were observed after a single dose of avelumab. All responders developed immune-related adverse events that resolved with immunosuppressive therapy. Only one of four patients without a clinical response developed immune-related adverse events. Responders had a higher absolute lymphocyte count, lower frequencies of B cells, regulatory T cells, conventional dendritic cells, and natural killer cells prior to therapy.These results demonstrate anti-tumor activity of PD-L1 inhibition in patients with relapsed thymoma accompanied by a high frequency of immune-related adverse events.

Clinical and biological disease characteristics did not differ between the two subgroups of adolescents, including minimal residual disease (MRD) results during initial therapy, except for ETV6-RUNX1 frequency and gender. With a median follow-up of 8.8 years, the 5-year EFS and OS were 76.% (1.5) and 84.9% (1.3), respectively, for those aged 10-14 years and 70.0% (.8) and 78.8% (.5) for those aged 15-17 years (p = 0.06; 0.05). There was no significant difference in the cumulative incidence of relapses [17.8% (1.4) and 18.3% (.4); p = 0.98], while the incidence of treatment-related deaths as a first event was .6% (0.6) versus 7.4% (1.6) (p < 0.001) with, in particular, a higher incidence in the high-risk arm.Further prospective studies and biological investigations are required to define optimal treatment for adolescents, in particular for those aged 15-17 years. Newer agents (, targeted therapy) in early treatment phases of patients at higher risk of treatment failure could replace most toxic treatment elements, with the aim of reducing both toxicity and the risk of relapses.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this case study, we report a case of successful alternation of one PD-1 inhibitor for another after a hypersensitivity reaction.Nivolumab (Opdivo, Bristol-Myers Squibb) has been Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for a variety of malignancies, including a recent approval for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Infusion-related reactions occur in less than 1% of patients, and although such reactions are rare, recognition of infusion-related reactions induced by nivolumab is an important aspect of its usage. The PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab is also FDA approved for subsequent-line therapy in treatment of HCC. Thus far, approximately 0.% of patients experienced severe infusion-related reaction in studies using pembrolizumab. A 70-year-old male with HCC had an infusion reaction to nivolumab that presented as facial flushing, dyspnea, and back pain. The patient received prompt administration of diphenhydramine and hydrocortisone, which led to the amelioration of symptoms and allowed the patient to complete his  treatment. For the third dose of nivolumab, the patient received premedications prior to treatment, including diphenhydramine, hydrocortisone, and famotidine. During his infusion, the patient experienced facial flushing, coughing, chest tightness, and an itchy throat. The patient again received diphenhydramine and hydrocortisone to treat infusion-related symptoms and his therapy was discontinued. Because of the nivolumab infusion-related reaction, nivolumab was discontinued, and the patient was started on pembrolizumab. The patient tolerated pembrolizumab without any subsequent infusion-related reactions. Prompt recognition and attention to  infusion-related reactions could potentially prevent the fatal complication of anaphylaxis with immune checkpoint inhibitors. In this report, we describe the successful transition from one anti-PD-1 therapy to another for continued  treatment without any subsequent infusion reactions.A patient with HCC was successfully treated with pembrolizumab after experiencing adverse effects with nivolumab.© American Society of Health-System Pharmacists 2019.

However, the majority of cancer types, including high-risk neuroblastoma remain immunologically unresponsive. High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive technique that can mechanically fractionate tumors, transforming immunologically 'cold' tumors into responsive 'hot' tumors.We treated <% of tumor volume in previously unresponsive, large, refractory murine neuroblastoma tumors with mechanical HIFU, and assessed systemic immune response using flow-cytometry, ELISA, and gene sequencing. In addition, we combined this treatment with αCTLA-4 and αPD-L1 to study its effect on the immune response and long-term survival.Combining HIFU with αCTLA-4 and αPD-L1 significantly enhances anti-tumor response, improving survival from 0 to 62.5%. HIFU alone causes upregulation of splenic and lymph node NK cells and circulating IL-, IFN-Ɣ, and DAMPs, whereas immune regulators like CD4+Foxp3+, IL-10, and VEGF-A are significantly reduced. HIFU combined with checkpoint inhibitors induced significant increases in intratumoral CD4+, CD8ɑ+, and CD8α+CD11c+ cells, CD11c+ in regional lymph nodes, and decrease in circulating IL-10 compared to untreated group. We also report significant abscopal effect following unilateral treatment of mice with large, established bilateral tumors using HIFU and checkpoint inhibitors compared to tumors treated with HIFU or checkpoint inhibitors alone (61.1% survival, p<0.0001). This combination treatment significantly also induces CD4+CD44+CD62L+ and, CD8α+CD44+CD62L+ population and are adoptively transferable imparting immunity, slowing subsequent  tumor engraftment.Mechanical fractionation of tumors using HIFU can effectively induce immune sensitization in a previously unresponsive murine neuroblastoma model, and promises a novel yet efficacious immuno-adjuvant modality to overcome therapeutic resistance.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31568796>Persistence of the clinical effect of grass allergen peptide  after the second and third grass pollen season.</a></h1><p>Grass allergen peptides are in development for the treatment of grass pollen-induced allergic rhinoconjunctivitis(ARC).

Participants were not treated further and both participants and study personnel remained blinded. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in mean TRSS(reported every 30 minutes) from GPS1 baseline to the follow-up PTC, calculated across all time points over days -4 for GPS2, and across hours 1-3 over days -4 for GPS3. Secondary efficacy endpoints and safety were also assessed.122 and 85 participants were enrolled in GPS2 and GPS3 respectively. A greater improvement from baseline in mean TRSS at PTC was observed in the 8x6nmolQ2W group compared to placebo in GPS2(-6.0 vs. -3.6, P=.0535) and GPS3(-6. vs. -3.6, P=.1128). Similar findings were observed for the 4x12nmolQ2W group at GPS3(-6.4 vs. -3.6, P=.0759).

However, in comparison with widely adopted mono-immune checkpoint inhibitors, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy, the advantage of combination therapy of α-PD-1 and α-CTLA-4 in response rate and prognosis is controversial especially considering probably increased treatment related adverse event. Thus, we conducted this meta-analysis to explore the efficacy and safety of combination treatment of α-PD-1 and α-CTLA-4.This meta-analysis involved 8 clinical trials. In most trials, the primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Thus we calculated risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) to compare ORR of patients undergoing different treatment strategies. Moreover, the co-primary endpoints in few trials included progression-free survival and overall survival. Hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI were employed to weigh the influence of different treatments on prognosis of patients. Subgroup analysis was conducted in patients with high and low expression of PD-L1. Lastly, the safety of combination therapy was evaluated by comparing treatment related adverse events among various treatment groups.Our results showed that ORR was significantly higher in patients receiving α-PD-1 plus α-CTLA-4 compared with α-PD-1 (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.16-1.48) or α-CTLA-4 monotherapy (RR .11, 95% CI 1.84-.43), chemotherapy and targeted therapy (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.26-1.58). α-PD-1 plus α-CTLA-4 treated patients had a great advantage on monotherapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy treated patients in PFS. Notably, no significant alteration in total adverse event rate was observed in α-PD-1 plus α-CTLA-4 treated patients. Results of subgroup analysis showed that combination therapy could enhance anti-tumor response in comparison with other treatments, especially for low PD-L1 expression patients undergoing nivolumab treatment (ORR: RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.11-1.65).Combination treatment of α-PD-1 and α-CTLA-4 is a feasible strategy with enhanced efficacy and acceptable adverse event. Moreover, for some low PD-L1 expression patients, α-CTLA-4 might decrease the risk of resistance to α-PD-1 and demonstrate the synergistic anti-tumor effect.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650066>First-in-human phase I clinical trial of a combined immune modulatory approach using TetMYB vaccine and Anti-PD-1 antibody in patients with advanced solid cancer including colorectal or adenoid cystic carcinoma: The MYPHISMO study protocol (NCT03287427).</a></h1><p>MYB is a transcription factor that is overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) and also a driver mutation in adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC). Therefore, the MYB protein is an ideal target to vaccinate against to aid recruitment of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) against these tumours. The Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre (Melbourne, Australia) has engineered a DNA vaccine, TetMYB, based on the pVAX1 plasmid vector carrying a fusion construct consisting of the universal tetanus toxin T-cell epitopes flanking an inactivated  gene.This prospective first-in-human phase I single-arm multi-centre clinical trial involves patients with metastatic CRC or AdCC. Stage 1 will evaluate the safety profile of escalating doses of TetMYB vaccine, given sequentially and in combination with an anti-PD-1 inhibitory antibody, to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Stage  will assess the MTD in an expanded cohort. The calculated sample size is 32 patients: 12 in Stage 1 and 20 in Stage . The expected total duration of the trial is 3 years with 15 months of recruitment followed by a minimum of 18 months follow-up.MYB transcription factor is aberrantly overexpressed in a range of epithelial cancers, not limited to the above tumour types. Based on promising pre-clinical data of vaccine-induced tumour clearance and establishment of anti-tumour memory, we are embarking on this first-in-human trial. If successful, the results from this trial will allow progression to a Phase II trial and validation of this breakthrough immunotherapeutic approach, not only in CRC and AdCC, but other MYB over-expressing cancers.ClinicalTrials.gov ID: .

These findings, together with the unequivocal role of DNA repair in therapeutic response, have fueled efforts toward the clinical exploitation of research findings. The successful example of PARP1/ inhibitors has also supported these efforts and led to numerous preclinical and clinical trials with a large number of small molecules targeting various components involved in DNA repair singularly or in combination with other therapies.

Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive active intervention (lifestyle advice delivered by renal dietitians using behaviour change techniques) versus passive intervention (leaflet advice alone). Primary outcome was six-month change in insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity and disposition index. Secondary outcomes included patient-reported outcomes, cardio-metabolic parameters, clinical outcomes and safety endpoints.Between August 17 2015 and December 18 2017, 130 individuals were recruited of whom 103 completed the study (drop-out rate 20.8%).

With >50% of patients now reaching a second line of treatment and a significant improvement in the survival rate, an assessment of quality of life (QoL) during the whole course of the disease becomes necessary. The objective of this study was to describe the QoL of patients with MM in France, from their diagnosis of advanced disease to their death, in real life.QoL data were collected through MelBase, a prospective, French, multicentric cohort dedicated to the follow-up of adults with MM. QoL was assessed using the EuroQoL-5D questionnaire and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment (FACT)-Melanoma questionnaire at the time of study inclusion, every 3 months, and at the time of each treatment change until death. To assess longitudinal changes from baseline to death, mixed-effect models for repeated-measures analyses were used to control for baseline covariates.QoL was assessed in 1435 patients who were included in the study between 2013 and 2018. The median follow-up was 9.4 months, and 47% of patients died during follow-up. During first-line treatment, the model-based, mean utility score was 0.830 (95% CI, 0.818-0.843), the mean FACT-General score was 77.22 (95% CI, 76.23-78.22), and the mean FACT-Melanoma score was 129.46 (95% CI, 128.02-130.90).

Targeting an appropriate B cell epitope in pathological tau could in theory produce an effective reduction of pathology without disrupting the function of normal native tau. Recent data demonstrate that the N-terminal region of tau (aa -18), termed the "phosphatase activation domain (PAD)", is hidden within native Tau in a 'paperclip'-like conformation. Conversely, PAD is exposed in pathological tau and plays an essential role in the inhibition of fast axonal transport and tau polymerization. Thus, we hypothesized that anti-tau2-18 antibodies may safely and specifically reduce pathological tau and prevent further aggregation, which in turn would neutralize tau toxicity. Therefore, we evaluated the immunogenicity and therapeutic efficacy of our MultiTEP platform-based vaccine targeting tau2-18 formulated with Advax adjuvant (AV-1980R/A) in PS19 tau transgenic mice. The AV-1980R/A induced extremely high antibody responses and the resulting sera recognized neurofibrillary tangles and plaque-associated dystrophic neurites in AD brain sections. In addition, under non-denaturing conditions AV-1980R/A sera preferentially recognized AD-associated tau. Importantly, vaccination also prevented age-related motor and cognitive deficits in PS19 mice and significantly reduced insoluble total and phosphorylated tau species. Taken together, these findings suggest that predominantly targeting misfolded tau with AV-1980R/A could represent an effective strategy for AD .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673523>Changing equipoise in the landscape of radiation for oligometastatic lung cancer.</a></h1><p>There is growing interest in exploring use of local therapies in the management of oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to provide durable local and distant disease control. Prospective phase II studies have incorporated local therapy (predominantly stereotactic ablative radiotherapy or SABR) to both primary and metastatic sites. For patients who received these treatments, median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) exceeded that of historical controls treated with systemic therapy alone (9.7-23.5 and 13.5-41. months, respectively). Additionally, three trials randomized oligometastatic NSCLC patients to standard of care systemic therapy regimens  local consolidative therapy (LCT) plus standard of care systemic therapy (or observation) and all demonstrated a significant improvement in PFS, with two showing OS benefits to date. Notably, a majority of these trials selected patients with at least stable disease after completion of systemic therapy for local therapy and defined the oligometastatic state as one with no more than five metastatic sites spread across three organs. For patients with oligometastatic NSCLC, there are many important factors that should drive use and timing of local therapy, including metastatic presentation sequence (synchronous  metachronous), extent of disease (number and distribution of sites), and quality of life goals. The referenced clinical trials accrued patients prior to the approval of  for metastatic NSCLC, so the benefits of any local therapy in this setting remain uncertain. To ultimately clarify the role of local therapy in oligometastatic NSCLC in the era of improving systemic therapy efficacy (i.e.,  and targeted therapy combinations with cytotoxics), we recommend enrollment in in phase III studies with OS endpoints (i.e., NRG LU 002 and SARON) whenever possible.

Furthermore, we analyzed six pulmonary colloid adenocarcinomas (CAD), including one primary tumor, one metastasis, and two sample pairs consisting of the primary colloid lung tumor and a matching metastasis and an acinar component, respectively. All samples were characterized using immunohistochemistry (TTF-1, CK7, CK20, CDX2, Ki-67, ALK and PD-L1) and a next generation sequencing panel covering 404 cancer-related genes (FoundationOne® gene panel).While Ki-67 expression was comparably low in IMA (range: 8-15%) and in primary CAD (range: 5-8%), we observed considerably higher proliferation rates in the non-colloid tumor compartment (16%) and metastases (72%) from CAD, as well as in the PEAD-group (36-71%). The overall tumor mutational burden was lowest in IMA (.5 mutations per megabase), intermediate in CAD (5.8 mutations per megabase) and highest in PEAD (16.8 mutations per megabase). KRAS mutations were frequent in all three tumor subtypes, but TP53 mutations were mostly limited to PEAD. While chromosomal alterations were rare in IMA, we discovered MYC amplifications in three of four CAD. Comparing primary and metastatic CAD, we observed the acquisition of multiple mutations and chromosomal alterations. PEAD had a variety of chromosomal alterations, including two cases with RICTOR amplification. PD-L1 expression (20%, 50% and 80% of tumor cells) was limited to three PEAD samples, only. In conclusion, we provide a detailed insight into the molecular alterations across and within the different subtypes of pulmonary adenocarcinomas with intestinal differentiation.

As these patients were considered quiescent on clinical and serological grounds, particular attention was paid to the presence of active vasculitis.Retrospective noncomparative case series.Patients with GPA who had open lacrimal drainage surgery under the care of a single surgeon between 1991 and 2017. All patients had paired biopsies of both nasal and ipsilateral lacrimal sac mucosa.Biopsies of the nasal and lacrimal sac mucosa, taken from the operative site during either primary or revisional open dacryocystorhinostomy, were reported by experienced ophthalmic histopathologists. Outcome measures were the surgical appearance of the tissues and the proportion of each tissue showing histological evidence of active vasculitis, chronic inflammation with or without fibrosis, marked fibrosis without inflammation, or acute-on-chronic inflammatory changes.Paired tissues were available from 47 patients (25 females; 53%) who had undergone 64 procedures (57 primary, 7 revisional). All patients had systemic disease, this being known prior to surgery in 43 patients (with 41/43 on long-established systemic immunosuppression) and suspected clinically after the initial lacrimal examination in 4/47. Most lacrimal sacs and nasal spaces showed a variety of abnormalities, this commonly being extensive scarring. Despite most patients being considered to have inactive systemic GPA, active vasculitis was evident in 23/64 (36%) lacrimal sac biopsies and 32/64 (50%) nasal mucosal biopsies-suggesting that serological markers may not be reliable guide to disease activity where disease is of limited volume (as, for example, with limited sino-nasal disease). Chronic lymphocytic inflammation was present in a further 35/64 (55%) sacs-associated with marked fibrosis in 5-and a further 25/64 (41%) nasal biopsies (with fibrosis in ).The lacrimal sac and nasal space are highly abnormal in most patients with GPA undergoing lacrimal drainage surgery. Despite having clinically and serologically inactive disease on established systemic , histological examination often shows unrecognized active vasculitis, which might indicate inadequate systemic immunosuppression for the underlying condition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616224>Fear of stinging insects in relation to state anxiety and trait anxiety in a group of patients with hymenoptera venom allergy undergoing .</a></h1><p>The level of fear of hymenoptera associated with stinging or envenomation may depend on situational factors and on trait anxiety characteristic of each patient.To assess the relationship between fear of stinging insects on the one hand and state anxiety and trait anxiety on the other in a group of patients with hymenoptera venom allergy.The study was conducted by the Department of Allergy, Clinical Immunology and Internal Diseases, Dr J.

The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and a dedicated scale developed by the authors for this study were used.State anxiety was found to significantly ( < 0.05) correlate with anxiety in the present moment ( = 0.247), in a situation of real danger (appearance of an insect) ( = 0.223) and during the spring and summer seasons ( = 0.278). Trait anxiety was found to significantly ( < 0.05) correlate with anxiety before  (R = 0.261), in the present moment ( = 0.257), in a situation of real danger (appearance of an insect) ( = 0.254), and after an insect sting ( = 0.236). These were also weak correlations. The correlation between trait anxiety and anxiety during the spring and summer seasons was moderate ( = 0.331).The levels of trait and state anxiety are associated with the magnitude of the fear of the danger.

Notably, TE cancers are characterized by spurious transcription and faulty mRNA processing in a large set of genes, such as interferon/JAK/STAT and TNF/NF-κB pathways, leading to their suppression. The TE subtype of tumors in renal cell carcinoma and metastatic melanoma patients significantly correlate with poor response and outcome in . Given the importance of investigating TE cancers-as it portends a significant roadblock against -the goal of this protocol is to establish an in vitro TE mouse model to study these widespread, non-genetic transcriptional abnormalities in cancers and gain new insights, novel uses for existing drugs, or find new strategies against such cancers. We detail the use of chronic flavopiridol mediated CDK9 inhibition to abrogate phosphorylation of serine  residue on the C-terminal repeat domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II), suppressing the release of RNA Pol II into productive transcription elongation. Given that TE cancers are not classified under any specific somatic mutation, a pharmacological model is advantageous, and best mimics the widespread transcriptional and epigenetic defects observed in them. The use of an optimized sublethal dose of flavopiridol is the only efficacious strategy in creating a generalizable model of non-genetic widespread disruption in transcription elongation and mRNA processing defects, closely mimicking the clinically observed TE characteristics. Therefore, this model of TE can be leveraged to dissect, cell-autonomous factors enabling them in resisting immune-mediated cell attack.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612917>Identification of serum microRNAs predicting the response of esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma to nivolumab.</a></h1><p>Nivolumab, a programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor, showed promising activity for the treatment of advanced esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma in a phase II study (ONO-4538-07; JapicCTI-No.142422). We explored serum microRNA (miRNA) candidate predictive markers of the response to nivolumab.In the phase II study, 19 patients received nivolumab (3 mg/kg IV Q2W) at National Cancer Center Hospital. The expression of 2565 serum miRNAs before and during treatment was analyzed using a 3D-Gene Human miRNA Oligo Chip (Toray Industries, Inc.). Immune-related response evaluation criteria used to evaluate response and miRNA expression were compared between responders and non-responders. The top 20 miRNAs by accuracy in receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were identified by leave-one-out cross-validation, and those with the area under curve values > 0.8, cross-validated accuracy > 0.8, and a 0.5 difference in the average log2 expression level between responders and non-responders were further analyzed.Of the 19 patients, five responded to nivolumab. We identified miRNAs related to the response to nivolumab, including one detected in the serum before treatment (miR-1233-5p; AUC = 0.895) and three present after treatment (miR-6885-5p, miR-4698 and miR-128--5p; AUC = 0.93, 0.97 and 0.93, respectively).Candidate miRNAs capable of predicting the response to nivolumab were identified in the serum of patients with advanced esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma in ONO-4538-07.© The Author(s) 2019.

An Internet panel survey was conducted during March 27-April 8, 2019, among women aged 18-49 years who reported being pregnant any time since August 1, 2018. Influenza vaccination before or during pregnancy was assessed among respondents with known influenza vaccination status who were pregnant any time during October 2018-January 2019 (,097). Tdap receipt during pregnancy was assessed among respondents with known Tdap status who reported a live birth by their survey date (817).From 2010-11 to 2017-18, pregnant women accounted for 24%-34% of influenza-associated hospitalizations per season among females aged 15-44 years. From 2010 to 2017, a total of 3,928 pertussis-related hospitalizations were reported among infants aged < months (annual range = 262-743). Maternal influenza and Tdap vaccination coverage rates reported as of April 2019 were 53.7% and 54.9%, respectively. Among women whose health care providers offered vaccination or provided referrals, 65.7% received influenza vaccine and 70.5% received Tdap. The most commonly reported reasons for nonvaccination were believing the vaccine is not effective (influenza; 17.6%) and not knowing that vaccination is needed during each pregnancy (Tdap; 37.9%), followed by safety concerns for the infant (influenza =15.9%; Tdap = 17.1%).Many pregnant women do not receive the vaccines recommended to protect themselves and their infants, even when vaccination is offered.

We synthesized and manufactured a mannose-modified poly (β-amino ester) (PBAE) nano-vaccines with easily tuneable and pH-sensitive characteristics to co-deliver the tumor-associated antigen polypeptide Trp- and the TLR4 agonist monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA). To reduce immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, PD-L1 antagonist, was administrated along with PBAE nano-vaccines to delay melanoma development. We found that mannosylated Trp- and MPLA-loaded PBAE nano-vaccines can target and mature DCs, consequently boosting antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity against melanoma. The prophylactic study indicates that combination therapy with PD-L1 antagonist further enhanced anti-tumor efficacy by 3.7-fold and prolonged median survival time by 1.6-fold more than free Trp-/MPLA inoculation. DC-targeting PBAE polymers have a great potential as a nanotechnology platform to design vaccines and achieve synergistic anti-tumor effects with immune checkpoint therapy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This can enhance clinical efficacy of future and novel therapies and reduces any adverse reactions arising from the latter. This review discusses tumor treatment strategies using regulatory T (Treg) cell therapy in a tumor microenvironment (TME). It also discusses factors affecting TME instability as well as relevant treatments to prevent future immune disorders. It is prognosticated that PD-1 inhibitors are risky and their adverse effects should be taken into account when they are administered to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML), lung adenocarcinoma, and prostate adenocarcinoma. In contrast, Treg molecular markers FoxP3 and CD25 analyzed here have stronger expression in almost all kinds of cancers compared with normal people. However, CD25 inhibitors are more effective compared to FoxP3 inhibitors, especially in combination with TGF-β blockade, in predicting patient survival. According to the data obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas, we then concentrate on AML  and discuss different therapeutic strategies including anti-CD25/IL-, anti-CTLA-4, anti-IDO, antityrosine kinase receptor, and anti-PI3K therapies and highlight the recent advances and clinical achievements in AML . In order to prognosticate the risk and adverse effects of key target inhibitors (namely against CTLA-4, FoxP3, CD25, and PD-1), we finally analyzed and compared the Cancer Genome Atlas derived from ten common cancers. This review shows that Treg cells are strongly increased in AML and the comparative review of key markers shows that Tregbased  is not effective for all kinds of cancer. Therefore, blocking CD25(+)FoxP3(+) Treg cells is suggested in AML more than other kinds of cancer; meanwhile, Treg markers studied in other cancers have also great lessons for AML .Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628024>DNA methylation of indoleamine ,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas correlates with IDO1 expression, HPV status, patients' survival, immune cell infiltrates, mutational load, and interferon γ signature.</a></h1><p>The immune checkpoint, indoleamine ,3-dioxygenase 1, is under investigation as target of novel immunotherapies for cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). The aim of our study was to analyze DNA methylation of the encoding gene (IDO1) in HNSCC.Methylation of three CpG sites within the promoter, promoter flank, and gene body was investigated and correlated with mRNA expression, immune cell infiltration, mutational burden, human papillomavirus (HPV)-status, and overall survival in a cohort of N = 528 HNSCC patients obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas. In addition, IDO1 immunohistochemistry and DNA methylation analysis was performed in an independent cohort of N = 138 HNSCC samples.Significant inverse correlations of IDO1 methylation and IDO1 mRNA expression were found in the promoter and promoter flank region (Spearman's ρ = -0.163 and ρ = -0.377, respectively) while a positive correlation was present in the gene body (ρ = 0.502; all P < 0.001). IDO1 DNA methylation significantly correlated with IDO1 protein expressing immune cells as well as tumor cells. IDO1 promoter flank hypermethylation was significantly associated with poor overall survival (P < 0.001). In addition, we discovered significant correlations between IDO1 methylation and expression with RNA signatures of immune cell infiltrates and with HPV-status, mutational load (methylation only), and interferon γ signature.Our results suggest IDO1 expression levels are epigenetically regulated by DNA methylation. This study provides rationale to test IDO1 methylation as potential biomarker for prediction of response to IDO1 immune checkpoint inhibitors in HNSCC.Crown Copyright © 2019.

To determine the safety of administering Seprehvir systemically, we conducted the first-in-human phase I trial of intravenous injection in young patients with relapsed or refractory extra-cranial solid cancers. We delivered a single dose of 5 × 10 infectious units (iu)/kg (maximum dose of  × 10) or .5 × 10 iu/kg (maximum dose of 1 × 10 iu) of Seprehvir via the peripheral vein, monitored adverse events, and measured tumor responses by imaging. We monitored HSV-1 serology as well as viremia and shedding by PCR and culture. We administered a single dose of Seprehvir to seven patients and multiple doses to two patients. We did not observe any dose-limiting toxicities. All five HSV-1 seronegative patients seroconverted by day 28. Four of nine patients had detectable HSV-1 genomes in peripheral blood appearing on day +4 consistent with de novo virus replication. Two patients had stable disease in response to Seprehvir. Intravenous Seprehvir is well tolerated without viral shedding in children and young adults with late-stage cancer. Viremia consistent with virus replication holds promise for future Seprehvir studies at higher doses and/or in combination with other anti-neoplastic therapies.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

CDC used data from the National Immunization Survey-Child (NIS-Child) to assess vaccination coverage with the recommended number of doses of each vaccine at the national, state, territorial, and selected local levels* among children born in 2015 and 2016. Coverage by age 24 months was at least 90% nationally for ≥3 doses of poliovirus vaccine, ≥1 dose of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR), ≥3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine (HepB), and ≥1 dose of varicella vaccine, although MMR coverage was <90% in 20 states. Children were least likely to be up to date by age 24 months with ≥ doses of influenza vaccine (56.6%). Only 1.3% of children born in 2015 and 2016 had received no vaccinations by the second birthday. Coverage was lower for uninsured children and for children insured by Medicaid than for those with private health insurance. Vaccination coverage can be increased by improving access to vaccine providers and eliminating missed opportunities to vaccinate children during health care visits. Increased use of local vaccination coverage data is needed to identify communities at higher risk for outbreaks of measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631993>Immunogenicity And Safety Of The 13-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine In Patients With Monoclonal Gammopathy Of Undetermined Significance - Relationship With Selected Immune And Clinical Parameters.</a></h1><p>Patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) have an increased risk of developing infections.  vaccinations are recommended for immunocompromised patients, including patients with lymphoproliferative disorders such as MGUS. The objective of the study was to assess the immune response to the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in treatment-naive MGUS patients versus healthy subjects. All study groups were evaluated for the levels of specific pneumococcal antibodies, the levels of IgG and IgG subclasses, and selected peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations, including the proportion of plasmablasts before and after immunization.A total of 22 previously untreated patients with MGUS and 15 healthy age- and sex-matched volunteers were included in the study. All participants were immunized with PCV13 Prevenar13 (Pfizer). The following parameters were assessed: 1) serum-specific pneumococcal antibody titers before and 30 days after vaccination, ) percentage of plasmablasts, defined as CD19+/IgD-/CD27++, before and 7 days after vaccination, 3) serum total IgG and IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4 levels before and 30 days after vaccination.PCV13 vaccination in MGUS patients is safe and effectively protects against  infection. In unvaccinated individuals, vaccination should be carried out as soon as possible after diagnosis. It can protect patients against serious infectious complications, which can contribute to extending the time to progression and transformation into more aggressive diseases. PCV13 vaccination is more effective in MGUS patients with a lower concentration of M protein. Serum M protein concentration in patients diagnosed with MGUS may be a useful predictor of the effectiveness of vaccination.© 2019 Pasiarski et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680369></a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597860>[Hematopoietic cell transplantation for chronic active EBV infection].</a></h1><p>Chronic active EBV infection (CAEBV) is one of the EBV-associated T/NK lymphoproliferative diseases.

The ADCC of tumor cells is employed in the treatment of various cancers overexpressing unique antigens, and only natural killer (NK) cells are known to be major effectors of antibody mediated ADCC activity. Canine NK cells are still defined as non-B, non-T large granular lymphocytes because of the lack of information regarding the NK cell-restricted specific marker in dogs, and it has never been demonstrated that canine NK cells have ADCC ability against tumor cells. In the present study, we investigated whether canine non-B, non-T NK cells have ADCC ability against target antibody-coated tumor cells, using cetuximab and trastuzumab, the only human antibodies reported binding to canine cancer cells.Activated canine non-B, non-T NK cells (CD3CD21CD5TCRαβTCRγδ) for 13~17 days ex vivo showed ADCC ability against trastuzumab- or cetuximab-coated target tumor cells expressing various levels of human epidermal growth factor receptor  (HER-) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Trastuzumab and cetuximab induced significant ADCC responses of canine NK cells even in CMT-U334 and CF41.Mg cells expressing low levels of HER- and/or EGFR, as well as in SKBR3 and DU145 cells overexpressing HER- and/or EGFR. The trastuzumab-mediated ADCC activity of NK cells was significantly enhanced by treatment with rcIL-21.The results of this study suggest that canine non-B, non-T NK lymphocytes have a potential ADCC function and that combinational strategies of monoclonal antibodies with either cytokines, which activate NK cells in vivo, or adoptive transfer of NK cells may be a feasible method for amplifying the efficacy of  against malignant cancers even with very low expression of target molecules in dogs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646065>CD4 Th1 to the rescue in HER-+ breast cancer.</a></h1><p>HER2 overexpression leads to downregulation of MHC class-I.

Immunotherapeutical agents represent an emerging option for breast cancer treatment, including the human epidermal growth factor  positive (HER2+) subtype. The immune system holds the ability to spontaneously implement a defensive response against HER2+ BC cells through complex mechanisms which can be exploited to modulate this response for obtaining a clinical benefit. Initial immune system modulating strategies consisted mostly in vaccine therapies, which are still being investigated and improved. However, the entrance of trastuzumab into the scenery of HER2+ BC treatment was the real game changing event, which embodied a dominant immune-mediated mechanism. More recently, the advent of the immune checkpoint inhibitors has caused a new paradigm shift for immuno-oncology, with promising initial results also for HER2+ BC. Breast cancer has been traditionally considered poorly immunogenic, being characterized by relatively low tumor mutation burden (TMB). Nevertheless, recent evidence has revealed high tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in a considerable proportion of HER2+ BC patients. This may translate into a higher potential to elicit anti-cancer response and, therefore, wider possibilities for the use and implementation of  in this subset of BC patients. We are herein presenting and critically discussing the most representative evidence concerning  in HER2+ BC cancer, both singularly and in combination with therapeutic agents acting throughout HER2-block, immune checkpoint inhibition and anti-cancer vaccines.

Recently, a new global transcriptomic immune classification of solid tumours has identified six immune subtypes (ISs) (C1-C6). Our aim was to specifically characterise ISs in colorectal cancer (CRC) and assess their interplay with the consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs).Clinical and molecular information, including CMSs and ISs, were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (N = 625). Immune cell populations, differential gene expression and gene set enrichment analysis were performed to characterise ISs in the global CRC population by using CMSs.Only 5 ISs were identified in CRC, predominantly C1 wound healing (77%) and C2 IFN-γ dominant (17%). CMS1 showed the highest proportion of C2 (53%), whereas C1 was particularly dominant in CMS2 (91%). CMS3 had the highest representation of C3 inflammatory (7%) and C4 lymphocyte depleted ISs (4%), whereas all C6 TGF-β dominant cases belonged to CMS4 (.3%). Prognostic relevance of ISs in CRC substantially differed from that reported for the global TCGA, and ISs had a greater ability to stratify the prognosis of CRC patients than CMS classification. C2 had higher densities of CD8, CD4 activated, follicular helper T cells, regulatory T cells and neutrophils and the highest M1/M2 polarisation.

Diverse types and etiologies of NORSE are reported in various groups. Limbic encephalitis (LE) is reported as one of etiologies of NORSE. In this study, we investigated whether there were any intersections between NORSE and limbic encephalitis, as well as the presence of prognostic factors in intersection patients.We retrospectively analyzed patients who met both the definition of NORSE and diagnostic criteria of LE at the initial presentation from our database. Clinical characteristics and blood test, cerebrospinal fluid, electroencephalography, and magnetic resonance imaging results were reviewed. Prognosis was recorded as ICU admission stay, total length of hospitalization, and modified Rankin Scale at discharge. In particular, we determined which factors were associated with patients' prognosis.Thirteen patients were selected. Nine of the 13 patients had myalgia and 8 patients had fever in the prodromal period. Twelve of the 13 patients had acute memory impairment or confusion before SE development. In addition, 46.% of the patients showed leukopenia or thrombocytopenia. Median body temperature at hospital arrival was 37.6 °C. Nine patients showed generalized tonic-clonic SE. All patients were treated with  and 11 of the 13 patients achieved burst suppression through induced coma therapy. Ten patients showed lesion extension on follow-up imaging. The most common extension site was the claustrum. Patients with more lesion extension showed poorer outcomes than those without lesion extension.Subsequent extratemporal lesion extension was closely associated with poor prognosis in NORSE-LE patients. This study explores a new subtype of NORSE and suggests a possible common underlying pathomechanism between NORSE and LE.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To achieve this goal, immuno-modulatory properties of the common gamma-chain (γ) family of cytokines, that includes IL-, IL-7, IL-15 and IL-21, have been used to fine-tune and/or complement current immunotherapeutic protocols. These agents potentiate CD8 T cell expansion and functions particularly in the context of immune checkpoint (IC) blockade, shape their differentiation, improve their persistence in vivo and alternatively, influence distinct aspects of the T cell exhaustion program. Despite these properties, the intrinsic impact of cytokines on CD8 T cell exhaustion has remained largely unexplored impeding optimal therapeutic use of these agents. In this review, we will discuss current knowledge regarding the influence of relevant γ cytokines on CD8 T cell differentiation and function based on clinical data and preclinical studies in murine models of cancer and chronic viral infection. We will restate the place of these agents in current immunotherapeutic regimens such as IC checkpoint blockade and adoptive cell therapy. Finally, we will discuss how γ cytokine signaling pathways regulate T cell immunity during cancer and whether targeting these pathways may sustain an effective and durable T cell response in patients.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Germline and somatic BRCA1/ mutations have been widely studied in breast and ovarian carcinomas as they have been found to enhance the risk for disease progression. Olaparib, an oral poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose)polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, has been approved for the treatment strategy of ovarian cancer with any BRCA1/ mutations. There is a lack of studies which focus on the treatment of other cancer with BRCA-Mutation.This report describes a patient whose presenting complaints were "Physical examination showed that the pancreas was occupied for one month." He initially was diagnosed with stage IV PC based on conventional imaging and pathologic assessment. He had a known germline BRCA  mutation, which exhibited a good response to PARP inhibitor therapy.Through the biopsy histopathological examination, imaging examination, and genetic testing, the patient was diagnosed as metastatic PC with BRCA2 mutation.He received gemcitabine and albumin-bound paclitaxel chemotherapy from March 15, 2017 to June 30, 2017, and Nivolumab  as the maintenance therapy. After serum CA-199 level increased, Olaparib was orally administered from August 17, 2017 to March. After tumor relapsed, he received multiple lines of chemotherapy, including Trametinib Oxaliplatin, S-1, bevacizumab, and irinotecan liposome injection till July 17, 2018.We observed the patient had a good progression-free survival (7.4 months); the lesion of the pancreas was classified as partial disease through Olaparib treatment, which indicated significant shrinkage. But it is difficult to conclude whether such therapy could help prolong the overall survival for such patients.The targeted therapy Olaparib showed early signs of potential in treating PC in patients with mutations of the BRCA genes. With emerging therapeutic modalities and next-generation sequencing development, it is increasingly relevant to consider mutation screenings of patients with PC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31580660>-Benzyl/Aryl Substituted Tryptanthrin as Dual Inhibitors of Indoleamine ,3-Dioxygenase and Tryptophan ,3-Dioxygenase.</a></h1><p>Indoleamine ,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), which catalyzes the initial and rate-limiting step of the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan catabolism, has emerged as a key target in cancer  because of its role in enabling cancers to evade the immune system.

Starting from our previously discovered tryptanthrin IDO1 inhibitor scaffold, we synthesized novel -benzyl/aryl substituted tryptanthrin derivatives and evaluated their inhibitory efficacy on IDO1, TDO, and IDO2. Most compounds showed similar high inhibitory activities on both IDO1 and TDO, which were significantly superior over that of IDO2 with magnitude difference. We showed that -benzyl/aryl substituted tryptanthrin directly interacted with IDO1, TDO, and IDO2, significantly augmented the proliferation of T cells in vitro, blocked the kynurenine pathway, and suppressed tumor growth when administered to LLC and H22 tumor-bearing mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31595457>Expression Profile of Markers for Targeted Therapy in Gastric Cancer Patients: HER-, Microsatellite Instability and PD-L1.</a></h1><p>The assessment of human epidermal growth factor receptor  (HER2), microsatellite instability (MSI) and programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression is relevant for the selection and effectiveness of targeted therapy in gastric cancer (GC).We aimed to investigate the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of GC patients according to these profiles.GC patients who underwent gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy were eligible. HER2, MSI status and PD-L1 expression were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Patients were grouped as follows: HER2+ group,  (IT) group (MSI and/or PD-L1+), and non-targeted therapy (NTT) group (stable microsatellite and HER2/PD-L1-).Among 282 patients, 50 (17.7%) were HER2+ and 79 (28%) MSI/PD-L1+. Fifteen had HER2+ and MSI/PD-L1+, while 168 (59.6%) were in the NTT group. HER2+ GCs were related to male gender (p = 0.007), intestinal type (p = 0.001) and less advanced pTNM stage (p = 0.029). Older age (p = 0.003), subtotal gastrectomy (p = 0.025), intestinal type (p = 0.008), pN0 status (p = 0.002) and less advanced pTNM stage (p = 0.001) were associated with the IT group. IT GC had better disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival than the NTT group (p = 0.015 and p = 0.027, respectively). Concerning patients eligible for the standard adjuvant therapy, the treatment impacted positively on DFS for HER2+ and NTT groups (p = 0.003 and p = 0.042, respectively). No difference in DFS was seen between IT patients who received perioperative/adjuvant therapy and those treated only with surgery (p = 0.160).GC patients who exhibited markers that can serve as an indication for known targeted therapy represent 40.4% of cases.

We recently reported that dendritic cells (DCs) infected with BV stimulated antitumor immunity. The recombinant BV (rBV) also strongly stimulated peptide-specific T-cells and antitumor immunity. In this study, the stimulation of an immune response against EG7-OVA tumors in mice by a recombinant baculovirus-based combination vaccine expressing fragment C-ovalbumin (FrC-OVA-BV; rBV) was evaluated.We constructed an rBV expressing fragment C (FrC) of tetanus toxin containing a promiscuous MHC II-binding sequence and a p30-ovalbumin (OVA) peptide that functions in the MHC I pathway. The results showed that rBV activated the CD8 T-cell-mediated response much more efficiently than the wild-type BV (wtBV). Experiments with EG7-OVA tumor mouse models showed that rBV significantly decreased tumor volume and increased survival compared with those in the wild-type BV or FrC-OVA DNA vaccine groups. In addition, a significant antitumor effect of classic prophylactic or therapeutic vaccinations was observed for rBV against EG7-OVA-induced tumors compared with that in the controls.Our findings showed that FrC-OVA-BV (rBV) induced antitumor immunity, paving the way for its use in BV  against malignancies.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673426>Stereotactic body radiation therapy in combination with systemic therapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma: a prospective multicentre study.</a></h1><p>Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and checkpoint inhibitors have been established as effective treatment for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), but only a minority of patients achieve complete response. Additional strategies are necessary to improve these agents' efficacy.Patients with stable disease for at least 4 months on TKI or checkpoint inhibitors were included. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) was delivered to an organ with comparable lesions, where one lesion was in the treatment target and the other one was intentionally left untreated (control lesion). Response in both lesions was scored using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors V.1.1 criteria  months after completion of SBRT. The primary endpoint was the rate of SBRT adverse events, and the secondary endpoints included the rate of reduction in target lesion size.17 patients were enrolled (14 men and 3 women, median age: 54.5 years old). SBRT was delivered to the lungs (n=5), bones (n=4), lymph nodes (n=4), liver (n=1), primary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (n=1) and locally recurrent RCC (n=). The equivalent dose in  Gy with an alpha to beta ratio of .6 was 114 Gy. With a median follow-up of 8 months, the cumulative rate of SBRT-related toxicity (grade 1) was 12% (n=), consisting of oesophagitis and skin erythema. No grade  or higher toxicity was detected. Radiographic response in the target lesion was seen in 13 patients (76%), with complete response in 5 (29%) patients and partial response in 8 (47%), including abscopal effect in 1 patient. Control lesions remained stable in 16 patients. The difference between response in the target and control lesions as judged by the mean sizes of these lesions before and at  months after SBRT was statistically significant (p<0.01). Fraction size of 10 Gy or greater was associated with complete response (p<0.01).Extracranial SBRT in patients with mRCC treated with TKI or checkpoint inhibitors is well tolerated and could be effective..© Author (s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

To help address this issue, we present a novel tamoxifen-gated photoactivatable split-Cre recombinase optogenetic system, called TamPA-Cre, that features high spatiotemporal control to limit CAR T cell activity to the tumor site. We created and optimized a novel genetic AND gate switch by integrating the features of tamoxifen-dependent nuclear localization and blue-light-inducible heterodimerization of Magnet protein domains (nMag, pMag) into split Cre recombinase. By fusing the cytosol-localizing mutant estrogen receptor ligand binding domain (ERT2) to the N-terminal half of split Cre(-59aa)-nMag, the TamPA-Cre protein ERT2-CreN-nMag is physically separated from its nuclear-localized binding partner, NLS-pMag-CreC(60-343aa). Without tamoxifen to drive nuclear localization of ERT2-CreN-nMag, the typically high background of the photoactivation system was significantly suppressed. Upon blue light stimulation following tamoxifen treatment, the TamPA-Cre system exhibits sensitivity to low intensity, short durations of blue light exposure to induce robust Cre-loxP recombination efficiency. We finally demonstrate that this TamPA-Cre system can be applied to specifically control localized CAR expression and subsequently T cell activation. As such, we posit that CAR T cell activity can be confined to a solid tumor site by applying an external stimulus, with high precision of control in both space and time, such as light.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665718>Landscape of Immune-Related Pneumonitis in Cancer Patients with Asthma Being Treated with Immune Checkpoint Blockade.</a></h1><p>Predicting the factors that increase the risk of immune-related pneumonitis, a potentially life-threatening complication of treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors for cancer, is a clinical challenge.

It was graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.A total of 187 patients were included. A diagnosis of asthma was found in the records of 26 cases (13.9%). Pneumonitis was found in 10 cases (5.35%); 50% were grade  and 50% were grade 3-4. Two of the grade 3-4 cases (40%) occurred in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. Three patients with asthma developed pneumonitis (11.5% of patients with asthma), all grade 3-4. Only 28.6% of the non-asthma-pneumonitis cases were grade 3-4. All (100%) of the asthma-pneumonitis patients were former smokers, while 71.4% of the non-asthma-pneumonitis patients were former smokers.A history of asthma may be associated with a higher grade of pneumonitis if it develops, and a history of smoking may augment this relationship.© 2019 S.

These structures can be covered by filter-like diaphragms. A transmembrane PLVAP (plasmalemma vesicle associated protein) protein has been shown to be necessary for the formation of diaphragms. The expression, subcellular localization and fenestra-forming role of PLVAP in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) have remained controversial. Here we show that fenestrations in LSEC contain PLVAP-diaphragms during the fetal angiogenesis, but they lose the diaphragms at birth. Although it is thought that PLVAP only localizes to diaphragms, we found luminal localization of PLVAP in adult LSEC using several imaging techniques. Plvap-deficient mice revealed that the absence of PLVAP and diaphragms did not affect the morphology, the number of fenestrations or the overall vascular architecture in the liver sinusoids. Nevertheless, PLVAP in fetal LSEC (fenestrations with diaphragms) associated with LYVE-1 (lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1), neuropilin-1 and VEGFR2 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ), whereas in the adult LSEC (fenestrations without diaphragms) these complexes disappeared. Collectively, our data show that PLVAP can be expressed on endothelial cells without diaphragms, contradict the prevailing concept that biogenesis of fenestrae would be PLVAP-dependent, and reveal previously unknown PLVAP-dependent molecular complexes in LSEC during angiogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679251>T Cell Receptors for Gene Transfer in Adoptive T Cell Therapy.</a></h1><p>The past decade has seen enormous progress in cancer . Checkpoint inhibitors are a class of  that act to recruit endogenous T cells of a patient's immune system against cancer-associated peptide- MHC antigens. In this process, mutated antigenic peptides referred to as neoantigens often serve as the target on cancer cells that are recognized by the T cell receptor (TCR) on endogenous T cells. Another successful  has involved adoptive T cell therapy, where therapeutic doses of T cells expressing a gene for an anti-cancer receptor are delivered to a patient. This approach has been used primarily against hematopoietic cancers using synthetic receptors called chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). CARs typically contain an antibody fragment (single-chain Fv, scFv) against a cancer cell surface antigen such as the B cell molecule CD19. While therapeutic CARs (and full antibodies) target antigens expressed on cell surfaces, TCRs can target a much larger array of intracellular proteins by binding to any cellular peptide associated with an MHC product. These cancer targets include self-peptides from aberrantly expressed/overexpressed proteins or neoantigens. In this review, we discuss the use of TCRs in adoptive T cell therapy and their target antigens. We focus on two properties that impact sensitivity, potency, and possible toxic cross-reactivity of TCR-mediated therapy: (1) the affinity of the TCR for the target antigen, and () the density of the target antigen. Finally, we provide a comprehensive listing of the current clinical trials that involve TCRs in adoptive T cell cancer therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628220>Early F-FDG PET/CT response predicts survival in Relapsed/Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma treated with Nivolumab.</a></h1><p>Anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies (anti PD-1 mAbs) such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab are associated with high response rates in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). To date, no prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) has been established with these agents in HL. We examined whether the first early response assessment evaluated using F-Fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT (ePET), may be associated with OS in this setting.  This retrospective study included 45 patients from 34 institutions. In a blinded, centralized review, three independent radiologists classified ePET obtained at a median of .0 months (interquartile range: 1.7-3.7 months) after nivolumab initiation using existing criteria (i.e., Lugano 2014, LYRIC 2016). Patients were classified at ePET according to 4 possible response categories: complete metabolic response (CMR), partial metabolic response (PMR), no metabolic response (NMR), or progressive metabolic disease (PMD). As the OS of patients with NMR and PMR were similar, they were grouped together. OS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between groups using log-rank testing.  Eleven patients (24%) died after a median follow-up of 21. months. The classification at ePET was identical between Lugano and LYRIC since all 16 progression events at ePET classified as indeterminate response per LYRIC were confirmed on subsequent evaluations. Both Lugano and LYRIC 2016 classified patients as CMR in 13 pts (29%), PMD in 16 pts (36%), NMR in 4 pts (9%) and PMR in 12 pts (27%). The -year OS [95CI] was significantly different in patients with PMD (0.53 [0.32-0.87]), NMR or PMR (0.80 [0.63-1.00]), and CMR (1.00 [1.00-1.00]) in the overall population ( = 0.02,  = 45 pts) as well as according to a landmark analysis at 3 months ( = 0.05,  = 32 pts).  In R/R HL patients treated with anti PD-1 mAbs, ePET assessment using either Lugano or LYRIC predicts OS and allows early risk-stratification suggesting that ePET may be used to develop risk-adapted strategies.Copyright © 2019 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680346></a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31574294>"NRF2 addiction" in lung cancer cells and its impact on cancer therapy.</a></h1><p>Nuclear factor erythroid -like factor  (NRF2) is a master regulator of the antioxidant enzymes and the detoxification proteins that play major roles in redox homeostasis. Although it plays a protective role against tumorigenesis, emerging evidence has shown that the NRF2 pathway is frequently altered in different types of cancer, including lung cancer. NRF2 activation influences many of the hallmarks of cancer and their signaling pathways, mainly apoptosis, proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and metabolic reprogramming to establish cellular metabolic processes leading to "NRF2 addiction" in lung cancer cells. Intriguingly, constitutive activation of NRF2 promotes cancer development as well as resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and these malignant phenotypes lead to a poor prognosis in lung cancer patients.

Tumor-infiltrating CD8-positive (CD8+) T lymphocytes play a central role in anti-tumor immune responses. Non-invasive imaging of CD8+ T cells may provide new insights into the mechanisms of  and potentially predict treatment response. We are studying the safety and utility of Zr-IAB22M2C, a radiolabeled minibody against CD8+ T cells, for targeted imaging of CD8+ T cells in patients with cancer.  The intial dose escalation phase of this first-in-human prospective study included 6 patients (melanoma, 1; lung, 4; HCC, 1). Patients received approximately 111 MBq (3 mCi) of Zr-IAB22M2C (at minibody mass doses of 0., 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 5, or 10 mg) as a single dose, followed by PET/CT scans at ~1-, 6-8, 24, 48, and 96-144 h post-injection (p.i.). Biodistribution in normal organs, lymph nodes, and lesions was evaluated. In addition, serum samples were obtained at ~5, 30, and 60 min and later at the times of imaging. Patients were monitored for safety during infusion and up to the last imaging time point.  Zr-IAB22M2C infusion was well tolerated with no immediate or delayed side effects observed after injection. Serum clearance was typically bi-exponential and dependent on the mass of minibody administered. Areas under the serum time-activity curve normalized to administered activity ranged from 1.3 h/l for 0. mg to 8.9 h/l for 10 mg. Biodistribution was dependent on the minibody mass administered. The highest uptake was always seen in spleen, followed by bone marrow. Liver uptake was more pronounced with higher minibody masses. Kidney uptake was typically low. Prominent uptake was seen in multiple normal lymph nodes as early as  h p.i., reaching peak levels by 24-48 h p.i. Uptake in tumor lesions was seen on imaging as early as  h p.i., with a majority of Zr-IAB22M2C-positive lesions detectable by 24 h. Lesions were visualized early in patients receiving treatment, with SUV ranging from 5.85-22.8 in 6 target lesions.  Zr-IAB22M2C imaging is safe and has favorable kinetics for early imaging. Biodistribution suggests successful targeting of CD8+ T cell-rich tissues. The observed targeting of tumor lesions suggests this may be informative for CD8+ T cell accumulation within tumors.

Here, the fAGP was analyzed in sera prospectively obtained from 39 patients with advanced lung cancer who underwent  with anti-PD-1 antibody, nivolumab. Twenty-three patients had significantly high fAGP levels above the cut-off value (H-fAGP) at one month after starting the treatment and 20 patients in this group, whose tumor sizes did not decrease, maintained high fAGP levels continuously and subsequently died. However, the other 16 patients, whose fAGP levels decreased or maintained below the cut-off value (L-fAGP), survived during a -year observation even though 5 patients in this group had no tumor shrinkage. Accordingly, the overall survival rate was found to significantly correlate with the fAGP level. Multivariate analyses revealed that the H-fAGP was an independent risk factor for cancer progression.

However, there are two main challenges in successfully utilizing macrophages for . First, macrophage colony stimulating factor (MCSF) secreted by cancer cells binds to colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1-R) on macrophages and in turn activates the downstream signaling pathway responsible for polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to immunosuppressive M2 phenotype. Second, ligation of signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα) expressed on myeloid cells to CD47, a transmembrane protein overexpressed on cancer cells, activates the Src homology region  (SH2) domain -phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP- in macrophages. This results in activation of "eat-me-not" signaling pathway and inhibition of phagocytosis. Here, it is reported that self-assembled dual-inhibitor-loaded nanoparticles (DNTs) target M2 macrophages and simultaneously inhibit CSF1R and SHP2 pathways. This results in efficient repolarization of M2 macrophages to an active M1 phenotype, and superior phagocytic capabilities as compared to individual drug treatments.

Beta-adrenergic receptors expressed on immune cells mediate the modulation of immune response by neural activity. Activation of beta-adrenergic signaling results in suppression of antitumor immune response and limits the efficacy of cancer . Beta-adrenergic signaling is also involved in regulation of hematopoietic reconstitution, which is critical to the graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect and to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). In this review, the function of beta-adrenergic signaling in mediating tumor immunosuppression will be highlighted. We will also discuss the implication of targeting beta-adrenergic signaling to improve the efficacy of cancer  including the GVT effect, and to diminish the adverse effects including GVHD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600181>National Update on Measles Cases and Outbreaks - United States, January 1-October 1, 2019.</a></h1><p>During January 1-October 1, 2019, a total of 1,249 measles cases and 22 measles outbreaks were reported in the United States. This represents the most U.S. cases reported in a single year since 1992 (1), and the second highest number of reported outbreaks annually since measles was declared eliminated* in the United States in 2000 (). Measles is an acute febrile rash illness with an attack rate of approximately 90% in susceptible household contacts (3). Domestic outbreaks can occur when travelers contract measles outside the United States and subsequently transmit infection to unvaccinated persons they expose in the United States. Among the 1,249 measles cases reported in 2019, 1,163 (93%) were associated with the 22 outbreaks, 1,107 (89%) were in patients who were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status, and 119 (10%) measles patients were hospitalized. Closely related outbreaks in New York City (NYC) and New York State (NYS; excluding NYC), with ongoing transmission for nearly 1 year in large and close-knit Orthodox Jewish communities, accounted for 934 (75%) cases during 2019 and threatened the elimination status of measles in the United States. Robust responses in NYC and NYS were effective in controlling transmission before the 1-year mark; however, continued vigilance for additional cases within these communities is essential to determine whether elimination has been sustained. Collaboration between public health authorities and undervaccinated communities is important for preventing outbreaks and limiting transmission. The combination of maintenance of high national vaccination coverage with measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) and rapid implementation of measles control measures remains the cornerstone for preventing widespread measles transmission (4).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647786>Global Routine Vaccination Coverage, 2018.</a></h1><p>Endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 2012, the Global Vaccine Action Plan 2011-2020 (GVAP) (1) calls on all countries to reach ≥90% national coverage with all vaccines in the country's national immunization schedule by 2020. Building on previous analyses () and using the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) global vaccination coverage estimates as of 2018, this report presents global, regional, and national vaccination coverage estimates and trends, including vaccination dropout rates. According to these estimates, global coverage with the first dose of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis-containing vaccine (DTP1) remained relatively unchanged from 2010 (89%) to 2018 (90%). Global coverage with the third DTP dose (DTP3) followed a similar global trend to that of DTP1, remaining relatively consistent from 2010 (84%) to 2018 (86%) (3). Globally, 19.4 million children (14%) were not fully vaccinated in 2018, and among them, 13.5 million (70%) did not receive any DTP doses. Overall, dropout rates from DTP1 to DTP3 decreased globally from 6% in 2010 to 4% in 2018. Global coverage with the first dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) remained between 84% and 86% during 2010-2018. Among countries that offer a second MCV dose (MCV2) during the second year of life, coverage increased from 19% in 2007 to 54% in 2018; among countries offering MCV2 to older age groups (children aged 3-14 years), coverage also increased, from 36% in 2007 to 69% in 2018 (3). Globally, the estimated difference in coverage with MCV1 and MCV2 in 2018 was 17%. However, among new and underused vaccines, global coverage increased from 2007 to 2018 for completed series of rotavirus vaccine, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), rubella vaccine, Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (Hib), and hepatitis B vaccine (HepB). To reach global vaccination coverage goals for vaccines recommended during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, tailored strategies that address local determinants for incomplete vaccination are needed, including targeting hard-to-reach and hard-to-vaccinate populations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31591378>ADP secreted by dying melanoma cells mediates chemotaxis and chemokine secretion of macrophages via the purinergic receptor P2Y12.</a></h1><p>Melanoma  is still not satisfactory due to immunosuppressive cell populations within the tumor stroma. Targeting tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) can help to restore an anti-tumor immunity. Previously, we could show that classical TAM markers expressed in vivo need a 7 day M-CSF/dexamethasone/IL-4 (MDI) stimulation for their induction in peripheral blood monocytes (pBM) in vitro. To identify possible novel therapeutic targets on TAM, gene expression analysis of MDI-treated pBM was performed. This identified up-regulation of the purinergic G-protein coupled receptor P2Y12, the therapeutic target of the clinically approved anti-thrombotic drugs cangrelor, clopidogrel, ticagrelor, and prasugrel. We generated a peptide antibody and validated its specificity using transgenic P2Y12 U937 cells. With the help of this antibody, P2Y12 expression was confirmed on CD68 CD163 TAM of melanoma in situ. Functional analysis revealed that treatment of transgenic P2Y12 U937 cells with the receptor agonist -MeSADP induced ERK1/ and Akt phosphorylation and increased the secretion of the chemokines CXCL2, CXCL7, and CXCL8. These effects could be abolished with the P2Y12 antagonist PSB0739 or with Akt and ERK inhibitors. In addition, P2Y12 macrophages migrated towards the ADP-rich culture medium of puromycin-treated dying B16F1 melanoma cells. Cangrelor treatment blocked migration. Taken together, our results indicate that P2Y12 is an important chemotaxis receptor, which triggers migration of macrophages towards nucleotide-rich, necrotic tumor areas, and modulates the inflammatory environment upon ADP binding.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659584>Clinical characteristics and long-term follow-up of seven cases of anti-GABABR encephalitis in patients of Han Chinese descent.</a></h1><p>To improve the diagnosis and treatment of anti-GABAB receptor (anti-GABABR) encephalitis and prevent misdiagnosis or non-diagnosis.We retrospectively examined the chief clinical manifestations, auxiliary examination results, treatment strategies, treatment efficacy, and long-term follow-up results of seven consecutive patients with anti-GABABR encephalitis.Epileptic seizures were the first symptom in 100% of the patients; 85.7% had memory deficit in the hospital, 42.8% had residual symptoms of cognitive impairment at discharge, and 28.6% had cognitive impairment at the end of follow-up; 71.4% of the patients had psychosis in the hospital, 57.1% had residual symptoms of psychosis at discharge, and 14.3% still had psychosis at the end of follow-up. However, the clinical symptoms (psychiatric disorders, cognitive decline) and signs (consciousness disturbance) at onset and after follow-up were not significantly different (P > 0.05). In 71.4% of the patients, anti-GABABR antibody serum levels were higher than those in the cerebrospinal fluid (especially in patients with lung cancer). Magnetic resonance imaging in 71.4% of patients indicated that the marginal lobe demonstrated encephalitis lesions. The average modified Rankin Scale score (.0 ± .31) at follow-up was significantly better than that (3.86 ± 0.90) at the time of admission (P < 0.05).The clinical characteristics of anti-GABABR encephalitis were refractory epilepsy, psychiatric disorders, and cognitive impairment. Multiple antiepileptic drugs are crucial for the treatment of intractable epilepsy. Clinicians should eliminate the possibility of small-cell lung cancer in patients with high anti-GABABR antibody levels.

Scientometric analysis is effective and widely used to summarize the most influential studies within a certain field. We present the first scientometric analysis of recurrent glioma.We conducted a generalized search for articles on recurrent glioma in the Web of Science database and evaluated the top 100 most cited articles among a total of 4,651 articles.The number of citations from the top 100 cited articles on recurrent glioma ranged from 149 to 1,471; the majority of these articles were published in oncology-specific journals (66) and were submitted by institutions in the United States of America (67). The top-cited articles consisted of 98 articles and  literature reviews. Articles were classified into 4 major categories based on subject matter: 82 pertained to treatment, 6 pertained to genetic mechanisms, 7 pertained to diagnosis, and 5 pertained to prognosis. Treatment-related articles were subdivided into the following 7 categories: targeted therapy (21), chemotherapy (20),  (12), combination therapy (12), radiotherapy (9), surgical resection (6), a new therapy (physiotherapy) (1), and treatment summary (1).The results of the analysis indicated that the core problem is the treatment of recurrent glioma. Although the number of citations on targeted therapy and combination therapy has increased in recent years, the proportion of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), basic medical research, literature reviews and meta-analyses is relatively low; thus, there is an urgent need to conduct these types of studies on recurrent glioma.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Thus, its natural history is not well defined and treatment recommendations come from small retrospective studies. Data on managing PTFL with radiation therapy alone is particularly sparse. Here, we describe a 17 year-old male who presented in June 2017 with a slowly enlarging right-sided cervical neck mass. An initial core biopsy was performed which showed reactive follicular hyperplasia. Four months later, the mass had enlarged significantly and an excision biopsy again showed reactive follicular hyperplasia. Further excision of five cervical lymph-nodes revealed expanded follicles with attenuated mantle-zones. Follicles were composed of medium sized atypical lymphoid cells; centroblasts were increased. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated follicles with cells expressing CD20, CD10, PAX-5, OCT-, BOB-1 and BCL-6; Cyclin D1 was negative. MIB-1 was greater than 90% in follicles. Polymerase chain reaction analysis identified a clonal B-cell profile. Fluorescent in-situ hybridization did not detect t(14;18), BCL2 or BCL6 rearrangement and breaks in IRF-4/DUSP22 and MYC were not detected. These findings were in keeping with a diagnosis of PTFL. PET/CT imaging confirmed disease isolated to the right neck, but unfortunately unresectable due to anatomic location. The patient declined treatment with chemo- and was thus treated with local radiotherapy, which was well tolerated. He achieved a complete response and remains in remission six months later. In our experience, radiation therapy is a suitable treatment for PTFL when excision and/or CIT is not possible.This article is protected by copyright.

It is an overwhelming task to discover drug-like inhibitors of glycosyl transferases that block the synthesis of specific branching processes in cancer cells, killing tumor cells selectively. It has long been known that -glycan biosynthesis can be inhibited by disruption of the first committed enzyme, dolichyl-phosphate -acetylglucosaminephosphotransferase 1 (DPAGT1). Selective DPAGT1 inhibitors have the promising therapeutic potential for certain solid cancers that require increased branching of -linked glycans in their growth progressions. Recently, we discovered that an anti- molecule, aminouridyl phenoxypiperidinbenzyl butanamide (APPB) showed DPAGT1 inhibitory activity with the IC value of 0.25 μM. It was confirmed that APPB inhibits -glycosylation of β-catenin at .5 nM concentration. A sharp difference between APPB and tunicamycin was that the hemolytic activity of APPB is significantly attenuated (IC > 200 μM RBC). Water solubility of APPB is >350-times greater than that of tunicamycin (78.8 mg/mL for APPB, <0. mg/mL for tunicamycin). A novel DPAGT1 inhibitor, APPB selectively inhibits growth of the solid tumors (. KB, LoVo, SK-OV-3, MDA-MB-432S, HCT116, Panc-1, and AsPC-1) at low μM concentrations, but does not inhibit growth of a leukemia cell (L1210) and the healthy cells (Vero and HPNE) at these concentrations.  metabolic stability using rat liver microsomes indicated that a half-life ( ) of APPB is sufficiently long (>60 min) for  studies (PK/PD, safety profiles, and  efficacy) using animal models. We have refined all steps in the previously reported synthesis for APPB for larger-scale. This article summarizes protocols of gram-scale synthesis of APPB and its physicochemical data, and a convenient DPAGT1 assay. •Remember that the abstract is what readers see first in electronic abstracting & indexing services.•This is the advertisement of your article.

T‑cells are divided into different groups based on their cytokine secretion: T‑helper type 1 (Th1) and type  (Th2) cells. The allergic immune response is caused by activation of specific Th2 cells. With specific , the mislead hyperactivated "allergic" immune response is reduced to a reaction within the normal range. The inflammatory forms of chronic rhinosinusitis are called endotypes, and, in the future, could enable a targeted, pathomechanistic therapy. These endotype-based treatment approaches target specific signaling pathways that have already shown good effects for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps using monoclonal antibodies.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have emerged as intracellular messengers participating in both physiological and pathological adaptations in skeletal muscle. A complex interplay between ROS-producing enzymes and antioxidant networks exists in different subcellular compartments of mature skeletal muscle. Recent evidence suggests that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases (NOXs) are a major source of contraction- and insulin-stimulated oxidants production, but they may paradoxically also contribute to muscle insulin resistance and atrophy.  Pharmacological and molecular biological tools, including redox-sensitive probes and transgenic mouse models, have generated novel insights into compartmentalized redox signaling and suggested that NOX2 contributes to redox control of skeletal muscle metabolism.  Major outstanding questions in skeletal muscle include where NOX2 activation occurs under different conditions in health and disease, how NOX2 activation is regulated, how superoxide/hydrogen peroxide generated by NOX2 reaches the cytosol, what the signaling mediators are downstream of NOX2, and the role of NOX2 for different physiological and pathophysiological processes.  Future research should utilize and expand the current redox-signaling toolbox to clarify the NOX2-dependent mechanisms in skeletal muscle and determine whether the proposed functions of NOX2 in cells and animal models are conserved into humans.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650415>Metachronous rectal metastasis from pulmonary adenocarcinoma after 11 years of chemo-, immuno-, and radiotherapy for recurrent lesions: a case report.</a></h1><p>Rectal metastasis from pulmonary adenocarcinoma is rare, and it has been regarded as an end-stage phenomenon. Recently, however, advances in lung cancer treatment have improved the chance of long-term survival of patients with unresectable distant metastases. We describe the occurrence and management of metastatic spread of a pulmonary carcinoma to the rectum.The patient was a 79-year-old woman who had undergone thoracoscopic left lobectomy for pulmonary adenocarcinoma and then, over the next 11 years, various drugs (carboplatin + paclitaxel (as adjuvant therapy), gefitinib, gemcitabine + vinorelbine, S1 (an oral 5-fluorouracil-based drug), carboplatin + pemetrexed + bevacizumab, erlotinib, nivolumab, afatinib, and carboplatin+ S1) were administered, especially for hilar and mediastinal lymph node recurrences. During the eleventh postoperative year, left and right iliac bone metastases were detected, and radiation therapy was undertaken for local control of these lesions. When F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography was performed for evaluation of the disease, tracer accumulation in the upper rectum was seen. Colonoscopic examination of the rectum revealed an intramural mass with central ulceration, and the mass was diagnosed histologically as an adenocarcinoma. The bone metastases appeared to be controlled, and the patient's performance status was good, but she had suffered constipation for about a year and desired treatment. Thus, laparoscopic low anterior resection was performed. Histopathologic analysis revealed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma existing mainly between the submucosa and serosa, and immunohistochemical analysis showed the tumor to be positive for cytokeratin (CK) 7, negative for CK20, positive for thyroid transcription factor-1, and negative for special AT-rich sequence-binding protein  and caudal type homeobox , confirming the diagnosis of rectal metastasis from the primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma. The patient recovered well without any change in her functional status. Systemic chemotherapy was resumed, and she continues to do well, now 6 months after surgery.Surgery may be a good option for the management of an isolated rectal metastasis from pulmonary cancer in patients whose functional status is good.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590677>Predicting response to pembrolizumab in metastatic melanoma by a new personalization algorithm.</a></h1><p>At present, immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab, are widely used in the therapy of advanced non-resectable melanoma, as they induce more durable responses than other available treatments. However, the overall response rate does not exceed 50% and, considering the high costs and low life expectancy of nonresponding patients, there is a need to select potential responders before therapy. Our aim was to develop a new personalization algorithm which could be beneficial in the clinical setting for predicting time to disease progression under pembrolizumab treatment.We developed a simple mathematical model for the interactions of an advanced melanoma tumor with both the immune system and the  drug, pembrolizumab. We implemented the model in an algorithm which, in conjunction with clinical pretreatment data, enables prediction of the personal patient response to the drug. To develop the algorithm, we retrospectively collected clinical data of 54 patients with advanced melanoma, who had been treated by pembrolizumab, and correlated personal pretreatment measurements to the mathematical model parameters. Using the algorithm together with the longitudinal tumor burden of each patient, we identified the personal mathematical models, and simulated them to predict the patient's time to progression. We validated the prediction capacity of the algorithm by the Leave-One-Out cross-validation methodology.Among the analyzed clinical parameters, the baseline tumor load, the Breslow tumor thickness, and the status of nodular melanoma were significantly correlated with the activation rate of CD8+ T cells and the net tumor growth rate. Using the measurements of these correlates to personalize the mathematical model, we predicted the time to progression of individual patients (Cohen's κ = 0.489). Comparison of the predicted and the clinical time to progression in patients progressing during the follow-up period showed moderate accuracy (R = 0.505).Our results show for the first time that a relatively simple mathematical mechanistic model, implemented in a personalization algorithm, can be personalized by clinical data, evaluated before  onset. The algorithm, currently yielding moderately accurate predictions of individual patients' response to pembrolizumab, can be improved by training on a larger number of patients. Algorithm validation by an independent clinical dataset will enable its use as a tool for treatment personalization.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31582515>HER2-overexpressing/amplified breast cancer as a testing ground for antibody-drug conjugate drug development in solid tumors.</a></h1><p>Efficacy data from the KATHERINE clinical trial comparing ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) to trastuzumab in patients with early-stage human epidermal growth factor receptor  (HER2)-overexpressing breast cancer with residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy (hazard ratio for invasive disease or death, 0.50; P<0.001). This establishes foundational precedent for antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) as effective therapy for treatment of subclinical micrometastasis in an adjuvant (or post-neoadjuvant) early-stage solid tumor setting. Despite this achievement, general principles from proposed systems pharmacokinetic modeling for intracellular processing of ADCs indicate potential shortcomings of T-DM1: 1) Cmax limited by toxicities, ) slow internalization rate, 3) resistance mechanisms due to defects in intracellular trafficking (loss of lysosomal transporter solute carrier family 46 member 3, [SLC46A3]), and increased expression of drug transporters MDR1 and MRP1, and 4) lack of payload bystander effects limiting utility in tumors with heterogeneous HER2 expression. These handicaps may explain the inferiority of T-DM1-based therapy in the neoadjuvant and first-line metastatic HER2+ breast cancer settings, and lack of superiority to chemotherapy in HER2+ advanced gastric cancer. In this review, we discuss how each of these limitations are being addressed by manipulating internalization and trafficking using HER2:HER2 bispecific or biparatopic antibody backbones, using site-specific, fixed DAR conjugation chemistry, and payload swapping to exploit alternative intracellular targets and promote bystander effects. Newer HER2-directed ADCs have impressive clinical activity even against tumors with lower levels of HER2 expression.

The combination of quercetin (Q) and alantolactone (A) was found to induce synergistic immunogenic cell death (ICD) at a molar ratio of 1:4 (Q:A). To achieve ratiometric loading and delivery, the micellar delivery of Q and A (QA-M) was developed with high entrapment efficiency and drug loading at an optimal ratio. QA-M achieved prolonged blood circulation and increased tumor accumulation for both drugs.

AIT is usually delivered by sublingual, subcutaneous route. Both sublingual  (SLIT) and subcutaneous  (SCIT) are given at increasing doses in the build-up phase and then at maintenance dose. The allergen dose is regularly administered throughout the year or pre/co-seasonally, depending on the causal allergen and the type of allergen extract. AIT with one or multiple allergens currently represents the only causal treatment able to change the natural history of allergic airways diseases (1). Significant progresses have been made in terms of AIT efficacy and safety since the first report of the treatment of hay-fever by SCIT using pollen extracts, described by Noon and Freeman in 1911 (; 3). The first randomized study on SLIT dates back to 1986 (4). Several placebo-controlled studies on AIT in the subsequent years have allowed systematic reviews suggesting evidence for improvement of symptoms and reduction of medication use for both allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma (5). However, AIT remains underused since interpretation of evidence remains challenging for heterogeneity among studied populations, selection of potential responders, outcomes, regimens and products for AIT. Moreover, the use of AIT is hampered by fluctuating availability of AIT products, different educational level of physicians and lack of consciousness of AIT in the general population (6).Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620854>Imaging for diagnosis, staging and response assessment of Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.</a></h1><p>Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma are common malignancies in children and are now highly treatable. Imaging plays a major role in diagnosis, staging and response using conventional CT and MRI and metabolic imaging with positron emission tomography (PET)/CT and PET/MRI. Cross-sectional imaging has replaced staging laparotomy and splenectomy by demonstrating abdominal nodal groups and organ involvement. [F-18]-fluoro--deoxyglucose (FDG) PET provides information on bone marrow involvement, and MRI elucidates details of cortical bone and confirmation of bone marrow involvement. The staging system for Hodgkin lymphoma is the Ann Arbor system with Cotswald modifications and is based on imaging, whereas the non-Hodgkin staging system is the St. Jude Classification by Murphy or the more recent revised International Pediatric Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Staging System (IPNHLSS). Because all pediatric lymphomas are metabolically FDG-avid and identify all nodal, solid organ, cortical bone and bone marrow disease, staging evaluations require FDG PET as PET/CT or PET/MRI in both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Both diseases have in common issues of airway compromise at presentation demonstrated by imaging. Differences exist in that Hodgkin lymphoma has several independent poor prognostic factors seen by imaging such as large mediastinal adenopathy, Stage IV disease, systemic symptoms, pleural effusion and pericardial effusion. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma includes more organ involvement such as renal, ovary, central nervous system and skin. Early or interim PET-negative scans are a reliable indicator of improved clinical outcome and optimize risk-adapted therapy and patient management; imaging may not, however, predict who will relapse. A recent multicenter trial has concluded that it is usually sufficient for pediatric lymphoma at staging and interim assessment to evaluate children with PET imaging from skull base to mid-thigh. Various systems of assessment of presence of disease or response are used, including the Deauville visual scale, where avidity is compared to liver; Lugano, which includes size change as part of response; or quantitative PET, which uses standardized uptake values to define more accurate response. Newer methods of  can produce challenges in FDG PET evaluation because of inflammatory changes that may not represent disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608101>The Construction and Comprehensive Analysis of ceRNA Networks and Tumor-Infiltrating Immune Cells in Bone Metastatic Melanoma.</a></h1><p> As a malignant and melanocytic tumor, cutaneous melanoma is the devastating skin tumor with high rates of recurrence and metastasis. Bone is the common metastatic location, and bone metastasis may result in pathologic fracture, neurologic damage, and severe bone pain. Although metastatic melanoma was reported to get benefits from , molecular mechanisms and immune microenviroment underlying the melanoma bone metastasis and prognostic factors are still unknown.  Gene expression profiling of 112 samples, including 104 primary melanomas and 8 bone metastatic melanomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, was assayed to construct a ceRNA network associated with bone metastases. Besides, we detected the fraction of 22 immune cell types in melanoma  the algorithm of "cell type identification by estimating relative subsets of RNA transcripts (CIBERSORT)." Based on the significant ceRNAs or immune cells, we constructed nomograms to predict the prognosis of patients with melanoma. Ultimately, correlation analysis was implemented to discover the relationship between the significant ceRNA and immune cells to reveal the potential signaling pathways.  We constructed a ceRNA network based on the interaction among 8 pairs of long noncoding RNA-microRNA and 15 pairs of microRNA-mRNA. CIBERSORT and ceRNA integration analysis discovered that AL118506.1 has both significant prognostic value ( = 0.002) and high correlation with T follicular helper cells ( = 0.033). Meanwhile, T cells CD8 and macrophages M2 were negatively correlated ( < 0.001). Moreover, we constructed two satisfactory nomograms (area under curve of 3-year survival: 0.899; 5-year survival: 0.885; and concordance index: 0.780) with significant ceRNAs or immune cells, to predict the prognosis of patients.  In this study, we suggest that bone metastasis in melanoma might be related to AL118506.1 and its role in regulating thrombospondin  and T follicular helper cells. Two nomograms were constructed to predict the prognosis of patients with melanoma and demonstrated their value in improving the personalized management.Copyright © 2019 Huang, Zeng, Li, Song, Yan, Yin, Hu, Zhu, Chang, Zhang, Zhang, Meng and Huang.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31582519>Intratumoral delivery of plasmid interleukin-12 via electroporation leads to regression of injected and non-injected tumors in Merkel cell carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Interleukin-12 (IL-12) promotes adaptive type-1 immunity and has demonstrated anti-tumor efficacy, but systemic administration leads to severe adverse events (AEs), including death. This pilot trial investigated safety, efficacy, and immunologic activity of intratumoral delivery of IL-12 plasmid DNA (tavo) via in vivo electroporation (i.t.-tavo-EP) in patients with Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), an aggressive virus-associated skin cancer.Fifteen MCC patients with superficial injectable tumor(s) received i.t.-tavo-EP on days 1, 5, and 8 of each cycle. Patients with locoregional MCC (Cohort A, N=3) received one cycle before definitive surgery in week 4. Patients with metastatic MCC (Cohort B, N=12) received up to 4 cycles total, administered at least six weeks apart. Serial tumor and blood samples were collected.All patients successfully completed at least one cycle with transient, mild (Grade 1, ) AEs and without significant systemic toxicity. Sustained (day 22) intratumoral expression of IL-12 protein was observed along with local inflammation and increased tumor-specific CD8+ T cell infiltration, which led to systemic immunologic and clinical responses. The overall response rate was 25% (3/12) in Cohort B, with two patients experiencing durable clinical benefit (16 and 55+ months respectively). Two Cohort A patients (one with pathologic complete remission) were recurrence-free at 44+ and 75+ months.I.t.-tavo-EP was safe and feasible without systemic toxicity. Sustained local expression of IL-12 protein and local inflammation led to systemic immune responses and clinically meaningful benefit in some patients.

The complete remission (CR) rates by the Lugano criteria were 88% and 46% for patients with FL and tFL, respectively. All patients with FL who achieved CR remained in remission at a median follow-up of 24 months. The median duration of response for patients with tFL was 10. months at a median follow-up of 38 months. Cytokine release syndrome occurred in 50% and 39%, and neurotoxicity in 50% and 23% of patients with FL and tFL, respectively, with no severe adverse events (grade ≥3).

Hemorrhaging, clotting, and associated inflammation regulate early wound healing. We investigated treatment with a virus-derived immune modulating serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN), Serp-1, which inhibits thrombolytic proteases and inflammation, in a mouse excisional wound model. Saline or recombinant Serp-1 were applied directly to wounds as single doses of 1 μg or  µg or as two 1 µg boluses. A chitosan-collagen hydrogel was also tested for Serp-1 delivery. Wound size was measured daily for 15 days and scarring assessed by Masson's trichrome, Herovici's staining, and immune cell dynamics and angiogenesis by immunohistochemistry. Serp-1 treatment significantly accelerated wound healing, but was blocked by urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPAR) antibody. Repeated dosing at a lower concentration was more effective than single high-dose serpin. A single application of Serp-1-loaded chitosan-collagen hydrogel was as effective as repeated aqueous Serp-1 dosing. Serp-1 treatment of wounds increased arginase-1-expressing M2-polarized macrophage counts and periwound angiogenesis in the wound bed. Collagen staining also demonstrated that Serp-1 improves collagen maturation and organization at the wound site. Serp-1 has potential as a safe and effective immune modulating treatment that targets thrombolytic proteases, accelerating healing and reducing scar in deep cutaneous wounds.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610376>Effective Virtual Screening Strategy toward heme-containing proteins: Identification of novel IDO1 inhibitors.</a></h1><p>Developing small molecules occupying the heme-binding site using computational approaches remains a challenging task because it is difficult to characterize heme-ligand interaction in heme-containing protein. Indoleamine ,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is an intracellular heme-containing dioxygenase which is associated with the immunosuppressive effects in cancer. With IDO1 as an example, herein we report a combined virtual screening (VS) strategy including high-specificity heme-binding group (HmBG)-based pharmacophore screening and cascade molecular docking to identify novel IDO1 inhibitors. A total of four hit compounds were obtained and showed proper binding with the heme iron coordinating site. Further structural optimization led to a promising compound S18-3, which exerted potent anti-tumor efficacy in BALB/c mice bearing established CT26 tumors by activating the host's immune system. These results suggest that S18-3 merits further study to assess its potential for the intervention of cancer.

Two thousands and two patients were included in our study where programmed ligand 1 was evaluated with DAKO technique and BIOCARE. Cell blocks were obtain with convex probe ebus-tbna 22G needle.  The Deming regression between DAKO and BIOCARE clone revealed an amazingly strong linear relationship as the coefficient of determination indicated (R=0.999) and the variance ratio close to 1 (0.978), proving that both techniques can equally well be substituted for each other. The regression coefficient equals to 1 and the intercept hardly differs from 0 (0.936). In practice, this relationship permits adopting the economically affordable BIOCARE clone for further medical considerations.  No statistical difference was observed between DAKO and BIOCARE, therefore we propose that both techniques can be used in order to investigate the expression of programmed ligand 1 with safety.

Current treatment strategies for HNSCC are surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy,  or combinatorial therapies. However, the overall 5-year survival rate of HNSCC patients remains at about 50%. Cancer stem cells (CSCs), a small population among tumor cells, are able to self-renew and differentiate into different tumor cell types in a hierarchical manner, similar to normal tissue. In HNSCC, CSCs are proposed to be responsible for tumor initiation, progression, metastasis, drug resistance, and recurrence. In this review, we discuss the molecular and cellular characteristics of CSCs in HNSCC. We summarize current approaches used in the literature for identification of HNSCC CSCs, and mechanisms required for CSC regulation. We also highlight the role of CSCs in treatment failure and therapeutic targeting options for eliminating CSCs in HNSCC.© The Author(s) 2019.

Low-dose IL- therapy was shown to restore Treg homeostasis in patients with active SLE and its clinical efficacy is currently evaluated in clinical trials. Lupus nephritis (LN), a challenging organ manifestation in SLE, is characterized by the infiltration of pathogenic CD4+ T cells into the inflamed kidney. However, the role of the Treg-IL- axis in the pathogenesis of LN and the mode of action of IL- therapy in the inflamed kidneys are still poorly understood. Using the (NZB × NZW) F1 mouse model of SLE we studied whether intrarenal Treg are affected by a shortage of IL- in comparison with lymphatic organs and whether and how intrarenal T cells and renal inflammation can be influenced by IL- therapy. We found that intrarenal Treg show phenotypic signs that are reminiscent of IL- deprivation in parallel to a progressive hyperactivity of intrarenal conventional CD4+ T cells (Tcon). Short-term IL- treatment of mice with active LN induced an expansion the intrarenal Treg population whereas long-term IL- treatment reduced the activity and proliferation of intrarenal Tcon, which was accompanied by a clinical and histological amelioration of LN.

Currently, these protein toxins were used in the immunotoxins as a cancer therapy strategy. Despite the successful use of immunotoxins,  strategies are still expensive and limited to hematologic malignancies. In the current study, for the first time, a nano-toxin comprised of truncated pseudomonas exotoxin (PE38) loaded silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were prepared and their cytotoxicity effect was investigated on human breast cancer cells. The PE38 protein was cloned into pET28a and expressed in Escherichia coli, BL21 (DE3), and purified using metal affinity chromatography and was analyzed by 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. AgNPs were biologically prepared using cell-free supernatant of E. Coli K12 strain. Nanoparticle formation was characterized by energy dispersive spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and dynamic light scattering. The PE38 protein was loaded on AgNPs and prepared the PE38-AgNPs nano-toxin. Additionally, in vitro release indicated a partial slow release of toxin in about 100 hr. The nano-toxin exhibited dose-dependent cytotoxicity on MCF-7 cells. Also, real-time polymerase chain reaction results demonstrated the ability of nano-toxin to upregulate Bax/Bcl- ratio and caspase-3, -8, -9, and P53 apoptotic genes in the MCF-7 tumor cells. Apoptosis induction was determined by Annexin-V/propidium flow cytometry and caspases activity assay after treatment of cancer cells with the nano-toxin.

We sought to determine whether putative procarcinogenic bacteria (enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Escherichia coli harboring the colibactin toxin) could be durably transmitted from donors to patients during FMT.METHODSStool samples were collected from 11 pediatric rCDI patients and their respective FMT donors prior to FMT as well as from the patients at -10 weeks, 10-20 weeks, and 6 months after FMT. Bacterial virulence factors in stool DNA extracts and stool cultures were measured by quantitative PCR: Bacteroides fragilis toxin (bft), Fusobacterium adhesin A (fadA), and Escherichia coli colibactin (clbB).RESULTSFour of 11 patients demonstrated sustained acquisition of a procarcinogenic bacteria. Whole genome sequencing was performed on colony isolates from one of these donor/recipient pairs and demonstrated that clbB+ E. coli strains present in the recipient after FMT were identical to a strain present in the donor, confirming strain transmission. Conversely,  patients exhibited clearance of procarcinogenic bacteria following FMT from a negative donor.CONCLUSIONBoth durable transmission and clearance of procarcinogenic bacteria occurred following FMT, suggesting that additional studies on appropriate screening measures for FMT donors and the long-term consequences and/or benefits of FMT are warranted.FUNDINGCrohn's & Colitis Foundation, the Bloomberg~Kimmel Institute for Cancer  at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, the National Cancer Institute, and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31582532>Dual inhibition of angiopoietin-TIE2 and MET alters the tumor microenvironment and prolongs survival in a metastatic model of renal cell carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown clinical benefit in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) but novel therapeutic strategies are needed. The angiopoietin/Tie2 and MET pathways have been implicated in tumor angiogenesis, metastases, and macrophage infiltration. In our study, we used trebananib, an angiopoietin 1/ inhibitor and a novel small molecule MET kinase inhibitor in patient derived xenograft (PDX) models of ccRCC. Our goal was to assess the ability of these compounds to alter the status of tumor infiltrating macrophages, inhibit tumor growth and metastases, and prolong survival. Seven-week-old SCID mice were implanted subcutaneously or orthotopically with human ccRCC models. One month post implantation, mice were treated with angiopoietin 1/ inhibitor trebananib (AMG 386), MET kinase inhibitor or combination. In our metastatic ccRCC PDX model, RP-R-02LM, trebananib alone and in combination with a MET kinase inhibitor significantly reduced lung metastases and M2 macrophage infiltration (p=0.0075 and p=0.0205 respectively). Survival studies revealed that treatment of the orthotopically implanted RP-R-02LM tumors yielded a significant increase in survival in both trebananib and combination groups. Additionally, resection of the subcutaneously implanted primary tumor allowed for a significant survival advantage to the combination group compared to vehicle and both single agent groups. Our results show that the combination of trebananib with a MET kinase inhibitor significantly inhibits the spread of metastases, reduces infiltrating M2 type macrophages, and prolongs survival in our highly metastatic ccRCC PDX model, suggesting a potential use for this combination therapy in treating patients with ccRCC.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628775>Mandatory notifications of type 1 diabetes incident cases in Chilean children, 2006-2014: a population-based study.</a></h1><p>Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) incidence in children varies across regions and countries, showing a continuous rise globally.

A significantly increasing linear trend of T1D incidence was observed in groups of 0-4 years (β 0.33, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.59, P = 0.02), 5-9 years (β 0.68 95% CI 0.27 to 1.10, P = 0.006), and 10-14 (β 0.94, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.20, P < 0.001), but increase was less pronounced in the oldest children aged between 15-19 years (β 0.22, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.44, P = 0.052). The lowest regional T1D incidence was observed in the Araucanía region, which has the highest rate of indigenous population.Incidence rates of T1D in Chile, evaluated through a mandatory notification program, are rapidly increasing in children and adolescents. If increasing trends persist, Chile will reach T1D incidence rates of Western developed countries in the next decade. This article is protected by copyright.

In the present study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the landscape of tumor fusion neoantigens in cancer and proposed a score scheme to quantitatively assess their immunogenic potentials. By analyzing three large-scale tumor datasets, we demonstrated that (1) the tumor fusion candidate neoantigen burden is not related to the  outcome; () fusion neoantigens tend to have notably higher immunogenic potentials than SNV&indel-based candidate neoantigens, making them better candidates for cancer vaccines; (3) fusion candidate neoantigens distribute sparsely between individual patients. Although several recurrent candidate neoantigens exist, they usually have extremely low immunogenic potentials, suggesting that vaccination-based cancer  must be personalized; (4) compared with fusion mutations involving tumor passenger genes, fusion mutations involving oncogenic genes have remarkably low immunogenic potentials, indicating that they undergo selection pressure during tumorigenesis.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

In this study, we have developed CD47-targeted bismuth selenide nanoparticles (Ab-PEG-BiSe) that increase phagocytosis of cancer cells by macrophages to actualize improved photothermal therapy (PTT). The functionalized nanoparticles were constructed by conjugating anti-CD47 antibody (Ab) to PEGylated bismuth selenide nanoparticles (PEG-BiSe). The anti-CD47 antibody modified on the nanoparticles enhanced the phagocytic activity of macrophages toward tumor cells by specifically blocking the crosstalk between CD47 and SIRPα. Meanwhile, Ab-PEG-BiSe showed excellent photothermal performance including strong near infrared (NIR) absorbance, high photothermal conversion efficiency and photostability, and exhibited outstanding in vitro PTT effect under NIR laser irradiation. In vivo therapeutic experiments revealed that this CD47-targeted PTT nanoagent, with the assistance of enhanced macrophage phagocytosis, achieved the goal of tumor eradication. Besides, toxicity studies confirmed that Ab-PEG-BiSe had good biocompatibility. In conclusion, Ab-PEG-BiSe may serve as an efficient PTT platform in combination with macrophage-mediated  to improve antitumor efficacy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We performed single-cell RNA sequencing analysis on macrophages sorted from either a biologic matrix [urinary bladder matrix (UBM)] or synthetic biomaterial [polycaprolactone (PCL)]. Implantation of UBM promotes tissue repair through generation of a tissue environment characterized by a T helper  (T)/interleukin (IL)-4 immune profile, whereas PCL induces a standard foreign body response characterized by T17/IL-17 and fibrosis. Unbiased clustering and pseudotime analysis revealed distinct macrophage subsets responsible for antigen presentation, chemoattraction, and phagocytosis, as well as a small population with expression profiles of both dendritic cells and skeletal muscle after UBM implantation. In the PCL tissue environment, we identified a CD9IL-36γ macrophage subset that expressed T17-associated molecules. These macrophages were virtually absent in mice lacking the IL-17 receptor, suggesting that they might be involved in IL-17-dependent immune and autoimmune responses. Identification and comparison of the unique phenotypical and functional macrophage subsets in mouse and human tissue samples suggest broad relevance of the new classification. These distinct macrophage subsets demonstrate previously unrecognized myeloid phenotypes involved in different tissue responses and provide targets for potential therapeutic modulation in tissue repair and pathology.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Among these, the accumulation of adenosine (Ado) contributes to tumor progression and represents a promising immunotherapeutic target. Ado has been shown to impair T cell effector function, but the role and mechanisms employed by Ado/Ado receptors (AdoRs) in modulating human peripheral and tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) function are still puzzling.CD8 T cell cytokine production following stimulation was quantified by intracellular staining and flow cytometry. The cytotoxic capacity of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) was quantified by the chromium release assay following co-culture with autologous or anti-CD3-loaded tumor cell lines. The CD8 T cell metabolic fitness was evaluated by the seahorse assay and by the quantification of -NBDG uptake and CD71/CD98 upregulation upon stimulation. The expression of AdoRs was assessed by RNA flow cytometry, a recently developed technology that we validated by semiquantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), while the impact on T cell function was evaluated by the use of selective antagonists and agonists. The influence of Ado/AdoR on the PKA and mTOR pathways was evaluated by phosphoflow staining of p-CREB and p-S6, respectively, and validated by western blot.Here, we demonstrate that Ado signaling through the A2A receptor (A2AR) in human peripheral CD8 T cells and TILs is responsible for the higher sensitivity to Ado-mediated suppression of T central memory cells. We confirmed that Ado is able to impair peripheral and tumor-expanded T cell effector functions, and we show for the first time its impact on metabolic fitness. The Ado-mediated immunosuppressive effects are mediated by increased PKA activation that results in impairment of the mTORC1 pathway.Our findings unveil A2AR/PKA/mTORC1 as the main Ado signaling pathway impairing the immune competence of peripheral T cells and TILs. Thus, p-CREB and p-S6 may represent useful pharmacodynamic and efficacy biomarkers of immunotherapies targeting Ado. The effect of Ado on T cell metabolic fitness reinforces the importance of the adenosinergic pathway as a target for next-generation .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677498>Evaluation of the prognostic role of platelet-lymphocyte ratio in cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors: A systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>Whether platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) is a prognostic factor for cancer patients treated with  is under debate. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between PLR and survival of cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).A systematical search was performed in databases including PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library to retrieve potential eligible clinical studies assessing the prognosis of cancer patients with high versus low PLR after , from the establishment of the database to June 2019. Quality evaluation of included studies was performed, and meta-analyses with regards to overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were conducted using RevMan 5.3 and STATA 11.A total of 12 eligible studies with 1340 cancer patients were included. Combined results showed that elevated PLR was a negative factor affecting the efficacy of ICIs in cancer patients. Patients with high PLR had a significantly shorter OS compared to those with low PLR (hazard ratio (HR) = .02, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.46 to .80, P < 0.0001), as well as PFS (HR = 1.74, 95%CI: 1.27 to .38, P = 0.0006). Similar results were observed in sensitivity analyses. Subgroup analyses revealed that the prognostic role of PLR on OS and PFS was dependent on cancer type, region, and cutoff value. For NSCLC patients, the disease stage, ICIs agent, and line of treatment may not influence the prognostic role of PLR.PLR could be a routinely potential prognostic factor for ICIs.

Immunotherapies such as those that target immune checkpoint molecules can be used to augment immune-mediated elimination of tumours and have resulted in durable responses in patients with cancer that did not respond to previous treatments. However, only a subset of patients benefit from  and more knowledge about what is required for successful treatment is needed. Although the role of tumour neoantigen-specific CD8 T cells in tumour rejection is well established, the roles of other subsets of T cells have received less attention. Here we show that spontaneous and -induced anti-tumour responses require the activity of both tumour-antigen-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells, even in tumours that do not express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. In addition, the expression of MHC class II-restricted antigens by tumour cells is required at the site of successful rejection, indicating that activation of CD4 T cells must also occur in the tumour microenvironment. These findings suggest that MHC class II-restricted neoantigens have a key function in the anti-tumour response that is nonoverlapping with that of MHC class I-restricted neoantigens and therefore needs to be considered when identifying patients who will most benefit from .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31578302>Autologous nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for neuromyelitis optica.</a></h1><p>To determine if autologous nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) could be a salvage therapy for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD).Thirteen patients were enrolled in a prospective open-label cohort study (11 NMOSD aquaporin-4-immunoglobulin G [AQP4-IgG]-positive, 1 NMOSD without AQP4, and 1 NMOSD AQP4-IgG-positive with neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]). Following stem cell mobilization with cyclophosphamide ( g/m) and filgrastim, patients were treated with cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg) divided as 50 mg/kg IV on day -5 to day -, rATG (thymoglobulin) given IV at 0.5 mg/kg on day -5, 1 mg/kg on day -4, and 1.5 mg/kg on days -3, -, and -1 (total dose 6 mg/kg), and rituximab 500 mg IV on days -6 and +1. Unselected peripheral blood stem cells were infused on day 0. AQP4-IgG antibody status was determined by Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-validated ELISA or flow cytometry assays. Cell-killing activity was measured using a flow cytometry-based complement assay.Median follow-up was 57 months. The patient with coexistent SLE died of complications of active lupus 10 months after HSCT. For the 12 patients with NMOSD without other active coexisting autoimmune diseases, 11 patients are more than 5 years post-transplant, and 80% are relapse-free off all immunosuppression ( < 0.001). At 1 and 5 years after HSCT, Expanded Disability Status Scale score improved from a baseline mean of 4.4 to 3.3 ( < 0.01) at 5 years. The Neurologic Rating Scale score improved after HSCT from a baseline mean of 69.5 to 85.7 at 5 years ( < 0.01). The Short Form-36 health survey for quality of life total score improved from mean 34. to 62.1 ( = 0.001) at 5 years. In the 11 patients whose baseline AQP4-IgG serostatus was positive, 9 patients became seronegative by the immunofluorescence or cell-binding assays available at the time; complement activating and cell-killing ability of patient serum was switched off in 6 of 7 patients with before and after HSCT testing. Two patients remained AQP4-IgG-seropositive (with persistent complement activating and cell-killing ability) and relapsed within  years of HSCT.

KOC1, FOXM1, and KIF20A are cancer antigens that could be ideal targets for anticancer  against pediatric refractory solid tumors with positive expression for these antigens. This nonrandomized, open-label, phase I clinical trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of the NCCV Cocktail-1 vaccine, which is a cocktail of cancer peptides derived from KOC1, FOXM1, and KIF20A, in patients with pediatric refractory solid tumors. Twelve patients with refractory pediatric solid tumors underwent NCCV Cocktail-1 vaccination weekly via intradermal injections. The primary endpoint was the safety of the NCCV Cocktail-1 vaccination, and the secondary endpoints were the immune response, as measured by interferon-r enzyme-linked immunospot assay, and the clinical outcomes including tumor response and progression-free survival (PFS). The NCCV Cocktail-1 vaccine was well-tolerated. The clinical response of this trial showed that four patients had stable disease after 8 weeks and two patients maintained remission for > 11 months. In four, eight, and five patients, the NCCV Cocktail-1 vaccine induced the sufficient number of peptide-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) for KOC1, FOXM1, and KIF20A, respectively. Patients with high peptide-specific CTL frequencies for KOC1, FOXM1, and KIF20A had better PFS than those with low frequencies. The findings of this clinical trial showed that the NCCV Cocktail-1 vaccine could be one of the novel therapeutic strategies, with resulting in adequate anticancer effects, against pediatric refractory solid tumors. Future large-scale trials should evaluate the efficacy of the NCCV Cocktail-1 vaccination.© 2019 The Authors.

Twenty-five male Fisher 344 rats, 250 g, provided with feed and water ad libitum, were randomly divided into 5 groups (5 rats/group): G, no treatment; G, tumor induction; G, tumor induction, 5-Fluorouracil applied; G, induction of the tumor, supplemented with probiotic; G, tumor induction, 5-Fluorouracil applied, supplemented with probiotic. For tumor induction 20 mg/kg of 1,-dimethylhydrazine was applied intraperitoneally over 4 weeks, followed by an interval of 15 days, and then repeated for a further 4 weeks. Five weeks after the final dose of the carcinogen, treatment was initiated with 5-Fluorouracil (15 mg/kg, intraperitoneally/week) and a commercial probiotic (1 × 10 CFU, daily/gavage). Data were analyzed by One Way Variance Analysis and means compared by Dunnett's test. GraphPad Prism statistical software was used. The histopathological analyzes were evaluated by the chi-square test. A 5% type-I error was considered statistically significant. Compared with the G, the G (p < 0.0373) and G (p < 0.0003) demonstrated an attenuated effect on the aggressiveness of the colorectal tumor, with a reduction in the count of Aberrant Crypt foci; and a lower percentage of malignant neoplastic lesions in the G (40% low grade tubular adenoma, 40% carcinoma in situ, 20% low grade adenocarcinoma) and G (40% low grade tubular adenoma and 60% carcinoma in situ). Probiotic supplementation has the potential to decrease the formation of aberrant crypts and ameliorate tumor malignancy, enhancing the antitumor effect of 5-Fluorouracil chemotherapy in colic segments.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

With over 350 million people affected worldwide, HBV infection remains the leading cause of liver cancer. This is a major concern, especially in developing countries. Failure of the immune system to mount an effective response against HBV leads to chronic infection. Although HBV vaccine is present and novel antiviral medicines are being created, eradication of virus-reservoir cells remains a major health topic. Described here is a method for the generation of viral antigen (Ag) -specific CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (i.e., iPSC-CTLs), which have the ability to suppress HBV replication. HBV replication is efficiently induced in mice through hydrodynamic injection of an HBV expression plasmid, pAAV/HBV1., into the liver. Then, HBV surface Ag-specific mouse iPSC-CTLs are adoptively transferred, which greatly suppresses HBV replication in the liver and blood as well as prevents HBV surface Ag expression in hepatocytes. This method demonstrates HBV replication in mice after hydrodynamic injection and that stem cell-derived viral Ag-specific CTLs can suppress HBV replication. This protocol provides a useful method for HBV .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629915>Nivolumab Monotherapy and Nivolumab Plus Ipilimumab in Recurrent Small Cell Lung Cancer: Results From the CheckMate 032 Randomized Cohort.</a></h1><p>Nivolumab monotherapy is approved in the US for third-line or later metastatic SCLC based on pooled data from non-randomized and randomized cohorts of the multicenter, open-label, phase 1/ trial of nivolumab ± ipilimumab (CheckMate 032; ).

Resetting tumor-associated macrophages represents an attractive target for an effective cancer . WCCP-N-b, a novel linear 3-O-methylated galactan, isolated from Cantharellus cibarius, can convert tumor-promoting M2-like macrophages to tumor-inhibiting M1-like phenotype. On a cellular mechanistic level, WCCP-N-b inhibited M2-like macrophages polarization through suppression of STAT6 activation. Furthermore, WCCP-N-b increased the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and degradation of IκB-α through targeting Toll-like receptor  (TLR2). The activation of MAPKs and degradation of IκB-α were responsible for converting M2-like macrophages to M1-like macrophages.

Although the association of type  diabetes with CVD has been well described, the mechanisms, risk stratification and screening strategies of CVD in type 1 diabetes (T1D) are less understood. This review aims to evaluate recent literature and guidelines regarding CVD in T1D. At the cellular level, the early stage of CVD is characterized by endothelial dysfunction. Recent studies have shown that endothelial function is unaffected in younger T1D patients but there is a significant degree of endothelial dysfunction in the older T1D population compared with healthy age-matched controls, highlighting the importance of the endothelial dysfunction in T1D as a major age-dependent cardiovascular risk factor. T1D risk assessment tools have been developed similar to those seen in type  diabetes. Foremost among these are the Danish Steno Type 1 risk engine, the Swedish T1D risk score, the Scottish T1D risk score and the QRISK risk calculator. The latter risk prediction tool is used for all patients but contains T1D as an independent risk variable and has the advantage of being derived from, and validated in, a large and diverse population. The latest version (QRISK3) is likely to be recommended for routine use in T1D patients in upcoming guidelines by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence. Mortality in adults with T1D is increasingly due to CVD. This is driven by hyperglycaemia-mediated oxidative stress and vascular inflammation, resulting in atherosclerosis and cardiac autonomic neuropathy. Coronary artery disease is the most significant contributor to CVD and in T1D, has a propensity towards a more silent and severe form. Routine screening of coronary artery disease does not alter outcomes and is therefore not recommended; however, risk prediction tools are being developed to aid identification of high-risk individuals for aggressive risk factor modification strategies.Copyright © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess its efficacy on previously treated advanced metastatic cutaneous melanoma.The PubMed electronic database was searched from inception to 17 December 2018 to identify studies administering TIL-ACT and recombinant interleukin- (IL-) following non-myeloablative chemotherapy in previously treated metastatic melanoma patients. Objective response rate (ORR) was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints were: complete response rate (CRR), overall survival (OS), duration of response (DOR) and toxicity. Pooled estimates were derived from fixed or random effect models, depending on the amount of heterogeneity detected. Analysis was performed separately for high-dose (HD) and low-dose (LD) IL-. Sensitivity analyses were performed.Among 1,211 records screened, 13 studies (published 1988-2016) were eligible for meta-analysis. Among 410 heavily pretreated patients (some with brain metastasis), 332 received HD-IL- and 78 LD-IL-. The pooled overall ORR estimate was 41% (95% CI: [35-48%]), and the overall CRR was 12% (95% CI: [7-16%]). For the HD-IL- group, the ORR was 43% (95% CI: [36-50%]), while for the LD-IL- it was 35% (95% CI: [25-45%]). Corresponding pooled estimates for CRR were: 14% (95% CI: [7-20%]) and 7% (95%CI: [1-12%]). The majority of HD-IL- complete responders (27/28) remained in remission during the extent of follow-up after CR (median: 40 months). Sensitivity analyses yielded similar results. Higher number of infused cells was associated with a favorable response. The ORR for HD-IL- compared favorably to the nivolumab/ipilimumab combination following anti-PD-1 failure.TIL-ACT therapy, especially when combined with HD-IL-, achieves durable clinical benefit and warrants further investigation. We discuss the current position of TIL-ACT in the therapy of advanced melanoma, particularly in the era of immune checkpoint blockade therapy, and review future opportunities for improvement of this approach.© The Author 2019.

Those patients who present with minimal symptoms often are observed without therapy until significant progression occurs. When treatment is needed, initial options include single agent rituximab (R, anti-CD20), or various forms of chemoimmunotherapy including either R or the newer anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody obinutuzumab (O), with or without maintenance administration. Recent data suggest that the immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide can also be effective in combination with rituximab in both the upfront and relapsed setting. Patients with recurrent disease are frequently treated with chemoimmunotherapy or phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors. Current information suggests that the most important prognostic feature of FL is the presence or absence of early progression (within  years of initial treatment/diagnosis). Ongoing efforts are focused on biomarkers to optimally match treatment to patient populations and further improve clinical outcomes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589878>Early decrease in basophil sensitivity to Ara h  precedes sustained  unresponsiveness after peanut oral .</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632065>Decreased IFIT2 Expression In Human Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Tissues Is Associated With Cancer Progression And Poor Survival Of The Patients.</a></h1><p>IFIT2 (interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats ), also known as ISG54, is an important interferon-stimulated gene family protein, which has been confirmed to play a crucial role in anti-cancer as well as anti-virus process. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the IFIT2 expression in human non-small-cell cancer (NSCLC) tissues and its clinical implications.The immunohistochemistry assay was used to identify the clinical significance and prognostic value of IFIT2 expression in NSCLC tissues. The depletion of IFIT2 was achieved using RNAi approach to assess the role of IFIT2 in the regulation of biological behaviors in human lung cancer cell lines.Decreased IFIT2 expression was found in human NSCLC tissues (both in lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma) in contrast to the adjacent normal tissues (both <0.0001, respectively). We did not find any significant correlations between the IFIT2 expression and patient's clinicopathological features. The survival analysis showed that the overall survival (OS) of patients in IFIT2 low expression group was significantly poorer than that in IFIT2 high expression group (in lung adenocarcinoma: =0.027; and in lung squamous cell carcinoma: =0.029). The Cox model analysis also indicated that the distant metastasis (=0.043) could be used as an independent prognostic factor for lung adenocarcinoma patients, and the lymph node metastasis (=0.045) and IFIT2 low expression (=0.020) could be used as independent prognostic factors for lung squamous cell carcinoma patients. Moreover, the depletion of IFIT2 in human lung cancer cell lines A549, H1975 and SK-MES-1 significantly increased the cellular abilities, such as viability, migration and invasion.Decreased IFIT2 was involved in the initiation and the progression of human NSCLC, and its underlying mechanisms still needs further investigation.© 2019 Su et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31605795>Quantitative assessment of CMTM6 in the tumor microenvironment and association with response to PD-1 pathway blockade in advanced-stage non-small-cell lung cancer.</a></h1><p>CMTM6 has been described as a PD-L1 regulator at the protein level by modulating stability via ubiquitination. In this study, we describe the patterns of CMTM6 expression and assess its association with response to PD-1 pathway blockade in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).We used multiplexed quantitative immunofluorescence to determine the expression of CMTM6 and PD-L1 in 438 NSCLCs represented in tissue microarrays, including two independent retrospective cohorts of  treated (n = 69) and untreated (n = 258) patients, and a third collection of EGFR and KRAS genotyped tumors (n = 111).Tumor and stromal CMTM6 expression was detected in approximately 70 % of NSCLCs. CMTM6 expression was not associated with clinical features or EGFR/KRAS mutational status and showed a modest correlation with T-cell infiltration (R < 0.40). We found a significant correlation between CMTM6 and PD-L1, higher in the stroma (R = 0.51) than tumor cells (R = 0.35). In our retrospective NSCLC cohort, neither CMTM6 nor PD-L1 expression alone significantly predicted  outcomes. However, high CMTM6 and PD-L1 co-expression in the stroma and CD68 compartments (adjusted HR 0.38, p = 0.03), but not in tumor cells (p = 0.15), was significantly associated with longer OS in treated patients, but not observed in the absence of .This study supports the mechanistic role for CMTM6 in stabilization of PD-L1 in patient tumors and suggests that high co-expression of CMTM6 and PD-L1, particularly in stromal immune-cells (macrophages), might identify the greatest benefit from PD-1 axis blockade in NSCLC.Copyright © 2019 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.

We aimed to evaluate the frequency of reduced immunoglobulin (Ig) concentrations and its association with  and disease course in two independent MS cohorts.In our retrospective cross-sectional study, MS patients and control patients with head or neck pain from Bern University Hospital (Bern, Switzerland) and Eginition University Hospital (Athens, Greece) were included. The lower limits of normal (LLN) for serum Ig concentration were IgG < 700 mg/dl, IgM < 40 mg/dl, and IgA < 70 mg/dl. Mann-Whitney  test, analysis of variance test, and multiple linear regression analysis were employed.In total, 327 MS patients were retrospectively identified (Bern/Athens:  = 226/101). Serum IgG concentrations were frequently under LLN in both MS cohorts (Bern/Athens: 15.5%/14.9%), even when considering only untreated patients (Bern/Athens: 7.9%/8.6%). MS patients ( = 327) were significantly more likely to have IgG concentrations below LLN and below 600 mg/dl in comparison with controls ( = 58) ( = 0.015 and 0.047, respectively). Between both patient groups, no significant differences were found in frequencies of IgA and IgM concentrations under LLN [ (MS patients/controls): IgA 203/30, IgM 224/24]. Independently of age, secondary progressive MS patients had lower IgG concentrations than relapsing-remitting and primary progressive patients (both:  ⩽ 0.01). After adjusting for sex, age, and disease course, IgG concentrations were lower in patients treated with rituximab ( = 0.001;  = 42/327), intravenous corticosteroids ( < 0.001;  = 16/327), natalizumab ( < 0.001;  = 48/327), and fingolimod ( = 0.003;  = 6/327).Our study demonstrated high prevalence rates of reduced serum IgG concentrations in MS patients with and without disease-modifying treatments. The significance of lower IgG concentrations at the levels noted is unclear considering that infections or interference with antibody production generally occur when IgG levels are much lower, at or below 400 mg/dl. However, the information is useful to monitor IgG levels especially with anti-B-cell therapies and consider IgG substitution when levels drop below 400 mg/dl.© The Author(s), 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661704>Clinical Heterogeneity in Patients with Glutamate Decarboxylase Antibody.</a></h1><p>To explore the diversity and clinical features of anti-glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) antibody-associated neurological diseases.Clinical data of a series of 5 patients positive for anti-GAD antibodies were retrospectively analyzed.All 5 patients were female, with a median age of 41.5 years (range 19-60 years).

We describe the clinical course of a 70-year-old female diagnosed with primary leptomeningeal melanoma (LMN) whose case represents the diagnostic and management challenges of this tumor. Targeted genomic sequencing of 315 genes from this tumor revealed GNAQ Q209L mutation and low (4 mutations/Megabase) tumor mutation burden (TMB). Wildtype NRAS, KIT, and BRAF were also observed. A cohort of 4,787 melanomas was subsequently analyzed to identify additional primary central nervous system melanomas, of which 10 additional tumors met pathologic criteria (0.21% of total melanoma cohort). These tumors were genomically assessed according to the same targeted sequencing panel, and 6 of the tumors were also found to harbor a GNAQ mutation. All 10 tumors had low (less than or equal to  mutations/Megabase) TMB indicating a potential trend between G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) alterations and low TMB in LMNs. GPCR alterations were found to significantly correlate with TMB across the cohort of 4,787 melanomas, supporting this potential finding in the limited LMN subset.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Patients with other histopathologic diagnoses or who did not have an EOM biopsy were excluded. The main outcome measures were histologic evaluation and clinical follow-up including tumor response, recurrence, and survival.Twenty-five patients were included, 16 female; 9 male; median age 64.7 years (range 33.8-92.6 years). Unilateral involvement was present in 23 cases (92%). Lymphoma was found to be primary in 15 patients (60%), and any EOM could be affected by disease. Fourteen patients (56%) displayed impaired duction in the direction of the affected muscle. The commonest histologic type was extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue in 16 cases (64%) followed by follicular lymphoma in 3 cases (12%), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in  cases (8%), gamma delta T-cell lymphoma in  cases (8%), small lymphocytic lymphom and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma in 1 case each (4%). All 4 patients with high-grade lymphomas (diffuse large B-cell or T cell lymphoma) were found to have systemic disease. Patients were treated with combinations of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or , with low toxicity. Two patients developed treatment-related complications. With a median follow-up of 26 months (range 3-108 months), there was only 1 recurrence, which was successfully salvaged with Rituximab, and no deaths due to lymphoma.Lymphoma of the EOM is a rare tumor with good response to treatment, few treatment-related complications and low risk of recurrence or mortality.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642136>Oral Immune-Related Adverse Events Associated with PD-1 Inhibitor Therapy: A Case Series.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to characterize clinical and histopathological features, and management outcomes of patients with oral immune-related related adverse events (irAEs) secondary to Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors.This was a case series of cancer patients receiving PD-1 inhibitor therapy who were referred to Oral Medicine for the development of oral irAEs. Demographic, clinical, and histopathological data were collected from electronic medical records.There were 13 patients (7 males) with a median age of 68 years (range: 39- 82) who were treated with nivolumab (n=7) or pembrolizumab (n=6). Oral irAEs included lichenoid lesions (n=10), erythema multiforme (EM) (n=), and acute graft-vs-host disease re-activation (n=1), with or without ulcerations (n=8). Four patients (31%) presented with only oral irAEs. Oral biopsies showed lichenoid mucositis (n=4). Management with topical and systemic steroids led to complete symptomatic response in most patients (n=12). PD-1 inhibitor therapy was temporarily discontinued (n=3) and discontinued indefinitely (n=) due to severe oral irAEs.Patients receiving PD-1 inhibitors may develop oral irAEs characterized by lichenoid lesions, ulcers or EM. Topical and systemic steroids appear to be effective in managing oral lesions although the severity of irAEs may necessitate PD-1 inhibitor therapy dose modification.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Autosomal-dominant inheritance of a R94Q mutation in MFN2 causes the axonal subtype 2A2A which is characterized by early onset and progressive atrophy of distal muscles caused by motoneuronal degeneration. Here, we studied mitochondrial shape, respiration, cytosolic, and mitochondrial ATP content as well as mitochondrial quality control in MFN2-deficient fibroblasts stably expressing wildtype or R94Q MFN2. Under normal culture conditions, R94Q cells had slightly more fragmented mitochondria but a similar mitochondrial oxygen consumption, membrane potential, and ATP production as wildtype cells. However, when inducing mild oxidative stress 24 h before analysis using 100 µM hydrogen peroxide, R94Q cells exhibited significantly increased respiration but decreased mitochondrial ATP production. This was accompanied by increased glucose uptake and an up-regulation of hexokinase 1 and pyruvate kinase M2, suggesting increased pyruvate shuttling into mitochondria. Interestingly, these changes coincided with decreased levels of PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy in R94Q cells. We conclude that mitochondria harboring the disease-causing R94Q mutation in MFN2 are more susceptible to oxidative stress, which causes uncoupling of respiration and ATP production possibly by a less efficient mitochondrial quality control.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31609094>Novel therapeutic targets in salivary duct carcinoma uncovered by comprehensive molecular profiling.</a></h1><p>Salivary duct carcinoma (SDC) is a rare, aggressive salivary gland malignancy, which often presents at an advanced stage. A proportion of SDC are characterized by HER2 amplification and/or overexpression of androgen receptor (AR), which could be targeted in a subset of patients, but the presence of AR splice variant-7 (AR-V7) in some SDC cases could result in resistance to anti-androgen therapy. We evaluated a cohort of 28 cases of SDC for potentially targetable biomarkers and pathways using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and next-generation sequencing (DNA and RNA) assays. Pathogenic genetic aberrations were found in all but 1 case and affected TP53 (n = 19), HRAS (n = 7), PIK3CA, ERBB2 (HER2), and NF1 (n = 5 each); KMT2C (MLL3) and PTEN (n = 3 each); BRAF (p.V600E), KDM5C and NOTCH1 (n =  each). Androgen receptor was expressed in all cases and 13 of 27 harbored the AR-V7 splice variant (including a case without any other detectable genetic alteration). HER2 IHC was expressed in 11 of 28 cases. The majority of SDC cases had no biomarkers predictive of  response: 5 cases exhibited low (1%-8%) programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in tumor cells,  cases exhibited elevated TMB, and no samples exhibited microsatellite instability. Notably, the pre-treatment biopsies from  patients with metastatic disease, who demonstrated clinical responses to anti-androgen therapy, showed AR expression and no AR splice variants. We conclude that comprehensive molecular profiling of SDCs can guide the selection of patients for targeted therapies involving AR, HER2, PD-L1, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and PIK3CA pathways.© 2019 The Authors.

However, in the case of advanced cSCC (acSCC), a multimodality approach also involving systemic therapies needs to be considered.One hundred and ninety-five patients diagnosed with acSCC (stages III and IV) treated in our centre between 2011 and 2018 were included. Patient and tumour characteristics along with treatment patterns were documented and analyzed. Descriptive analysis was performed and survival rates were estimated according to Kaplan-Meier and compared with the Log-rank test.

However, the effective targeted delivery of various drugs remains a challenge. We generated a peptide assembling tumor-targeted nanodelivery system based on a breast cancer homing and penetrating peptide for the codelivery of a programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) small interfering RNA (siRNA) (siPD-L1) and an indoleamine ,3-dioxygenase inhibitor as a dual blockade of an immune checkpoint. The vector is capable of specifically accumulating in the breast cancer tumor site in a way that allows the siRNA to escape from endosomal vesicles after being endocytosed by tumor cells. The drug within these cells then acts to block tryptophan metabolism. The results showed that locally released siPD-L1 and 1-methyl-dl-tryptophan favor the survival and activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, resulting in apoptosis of breast cancer cells. Therefore, this study provides a potential approach for treating breast cancer by blocking immunological checkpoints through the assembly of micelles with functional peptides.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671072>A composite immune signature parallels disease progression across T1D subjects.</a></h1><p>At diagnosis, most people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) produce measurable levels of endogenous insulin, but the rate at which insulin secretion declines is heterogeneous. To explain this heterogeneity, we sought to identify a composite signature predictive of insulin secretion, using a collaborative assay evaluation and analysis pipeline that incorporated multiple cellular and serum measures reflecting beta cell health and immune system activity. The ability to predict decline in insulin secretion would be useful for patient stratification for clinical trial enrollment or therapeutic selection. Analytes from 12 qualified assays were measured in shared samples from subjects newly diagnosed with T1D. We developed a computational tool to identify a composite panel associated with decline in insulin secretion over  years after diagnosis. The tool employs multiple filtering steps to reduce data dimensionality, incorporates error-estimation techniques including cross-validation and sensitivity analysis, and is flexible to assay type, clinical outcome and disease setting. Using this novel analytical tool, we identified a panel of immune markers that, in combination, are highly associated with loss of insulin secretion. The methods used here represent a novel process for identifying combined immune signatures that predict outcomes relevant for complex and heterogeneous diseases like T1D.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31570897>In vivo molecular imaging for  using ultra-bright near-infrared-IIb rare-earth nanoparticles.</a></h1><p>The near-infrared-IIb (NIR-IIb) (1,500-1,700 nm) window is ideal for deep-tissue optical imaging in mammals, but lacks bright and biocompatible probes. Here, we developed biocompatible cubic-phase (α-phase) erbium-based rare-earth nanoparticles (ErNPs) exhibiting bright downconversion luminescence at ~1,600 nm for dynamic imaging of cancer  in mice. We used ErNPs functionalized with cross-linked hydrophilic polymer layers attached to anti-PD-L1 (programmed cell death-1 ligand-1) antibody for molecular imaging of PD-L1 in a mouse model of colon cancer and achieved tumor-to-normal tissue signal ratios of ~40. The long luminescence lifetime of ErNPs (~4.6 ms) enabled simultaneous imaging of ErNPs and lead sulfide quantum dots emitting in the same ~1,600 nm window. In vivo NIR-IIb molecular imaging of PD-L1 and CD8 revealed cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the tumor microenvironment in response to , and altered CD8 signals in tumor and spleen due to immune activation.

Recently,  has demonstrated clinical activity in extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC). The CASPIAN trial assessed durvalumab, with or without tremelimumab, in combination with etoposide plus either cisplatin or carboplatin (platinum-etoposide) in treatment-naive patients with ES-SCLC.This randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial was done at 209 sites across 23 countries. Eligible patients were adults with untreated ES-SCLC, with WHO performance status 0 or 1 and measurable disease as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1. Patients were randomly assigned (in a 1:1:1 ratio) to durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide; durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum-etoposide; or platinum-etoposide alone. All drugs were administered intravenously. Platinum-etoposide consisted of etoposide 80-100 mg/m on days 1-3 of each cycle with investigator's choice of either carboplatin area under the curve 5-6 mg/mL per min or cisplatin 75-80 mg/m (administered on day 1 of each cycle). Patients received up to four cycles of platinum-etoposide plus durvalumab 1500 mg with or without tremelimumab 75 mg every 3 weeks followed by maintenance durvalumab 1500 mg every 4 weeks in the  groups and up to six cycles of platinum-etoposide every 3 weeks plus prophylactic cranial irradiation (investigator's discretion) in the platinum-etoposide group. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. We report results for the durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide group versus the platinum-etoposide group from a planned interim analysis. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of their assigned study treatment. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, , and is ongoing.Patients were enrolled between March 27, 2017, and May 29, 2018. 268 patients were allocated to the durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide group and 269 to the platinum-etoposide group. Durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide was associated with a significant improvement in overall survival, with a hazard ratio of 0·73 (95% CI 0·59-0·91; p=0·0047]); median overall survival was 13·0 months (95% CI 11·5-14·8) in the durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide group versus 10·3 months (9·3-11·) in the platinum-etoposide group, with 34% (26·9-41·0) versus 25% (18·4-31·6) of patients alive at 18 months. Any-cause adverse events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 163 (62%) of 265 treated patients in the durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide group and 166 (62%) of 266 in the platinum-etoposide group; adverse events leading to death occurred in 13 (5%) and 15 (6%) patients.First-line durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide significantly improved overall survival in patients with ES-SCLC versus a clinically relevant control group. Safety findings were consistent with the known safety profiles of all drugs received.AstraZeneca.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Indoleamine ,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is another IFNγ inducible gene that has potent immunosuppressive effects. There have been reports of IDO expression in prostate cancer; however, it is unknown whether IDO expression might similarly increase in prostate tumors following T-cell-based .Blood samples from normal male blood donors (n = 12) and patients with different stages of prostate cancer (n = 89), including patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with a DNA vaccine and/or pembrolizumab, were evaluated for IDO activity by kynurenine and tryptophan levels. Metastatic tissue biopsies obtained pre- and post-treatments were evaluated for IDO expression. IDO suppression of vaccine-induced T-cell function was assessed by ELISPOT.Overall, IDO activity was increased in patients with more advanced prostate cancer. This activity, and IDO expression as detected immunohistochemically, increased following treatment with either a DNA vaccine encoding the prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) tumor antigen or PD-1 blockade with pembrolizumab. Increased IDO activity after treatment was associated with the absence of clinical effect, as assessed by lack of PSA decline following treatment. Increased antigen-specific T-cell response, as measured by IFNγ release, to the vaccine target antigen was detected following in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood cells with 1-methyltryptophan.These findings suggest that IDO expression is a mechanism of immune evasion used by prostate cancer and that future clinical trials using T-cell-based immune strategies might best include IDO inhibition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644544>The impact on the bioenergetic status and oxidative-mediated tissue injury of a combined protocol of hypothermic and normothermic machine perfusion using an acellular haemoglobin-based oxygen carrier: The cold-to-warm machine perfusion of the liver.</a></h1><p>The combination of hypothermic and normothermic machine perfusion (HMP+NMP) of the liver provides individual benefits of both techniques, improving the rescue of marginal organs. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect on the bioenergetic status and the oxidative-mediated tissue injury of an uninterrupted combined protocol of HMP+NMP using a single haemoglobin-based oxygen carrier (HBOC)-based perfusate.Ten discarded human donor livers had either  hours of dual hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (D-HOPE) with sequential controlled rewarming (COR) and then NMP using the HBOC-based perfusate uninterruptedly (cold-to-warm group); or  hours of hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) with an oxygen carrier-free perfusate, followed by perfusate exchange and then NMP with an HBOC-based perfusate. Markers of liver function, tissue adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels and tissue injury were systematically assessed.The hypothermic phase downregulated mitochondrial respiration and increased ATP levels in both groups. The cold-to-warm group presented higher arterial vascular resistance during rewarming/NMP (p = 0.03) with a trend of lower arterial flow (p = 0.09). At the end of NMP tissue expression of markers of reactive oxygen species production, oxidative injury and inflammation were comparable between the groups.The uninterrupted combined protocol of HMP+NMP using an HBOC-based perfusate-cold-to-warm MP-mitigated the oxidative-mediated tissue injury and enhanced hepatic energy stores, similarly to an interrupted combined protocol; however, it simplified the logistics of this combination and may favour its clinical applicability.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31591706>Efficacy and safety of single versus multiple intralesional  with purified protein derivative (PPD) in the treatment of multiple verruca vulgaris.</a></h1><p>Despite the numerous studies on the use of purified protein derivative (PPD), a protein extracted from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, in verruca vulgaris, there is no standardized regimen, and efficacy of single versus multiple injections has not been compared.This is a randomized, open-label, superiority trial.

Proteins encoded by these genes are key players in DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR). Advances in next generation sequencing and gene panels for breast cancer testing have generated a large amount of data on gene variants implicated in hereditary breast cancer, particularly in genes such as , , , , , and . These genes are involved in DNA repair. Most of these variants have been reported for Caucasian, Jewish, and Asian population, with few reports for other communities, like those in Latin American (LA) countries. We reviewed 81 studies from 11 LA countries published between 2000 and 2019 but most of these studies focused on  genes. In addition to these genes, breast cancer-related variants have been reported for , , , , , , , ,  and  genes. Some of these variants are unique to LA populations.

How myeloid cells acquire the protumoral properties during tumorigenesis is poorly understood. We report here that the polarity protein TIPE2 (tumor necrosis factor-α-induced protein 8-like ) mediates the functional polarization of murine and human MDSCs by specifying their pro- and antitumoral properties. Tumor cells induced the expression of TIPE2 in Gr1CD11b cells through reactive oxygen species (ROS). TIPE2 in turn increased the expression of protumoral mediators such as CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β while inhibiting the expression of antitumoral mediators. Consequently, tumor growth in TIPE2-deficient mice was significantly diminished, and TIPE2-deficient MDSCs markedly inhibited tumor growth upon adoptive transfer. Pharmaceutical blockade of ROS inhibited TIPE2 expression in MDSCs and reduced tumor growth in mice. These findings indicate that TIPE2 plays a key role in the functional polarization of MDSCs and represents a new therapeutic target for cancer .© 2019 Yan et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31580408>Current targeted therapies in lymphomas.</a></h1><p>This article summarizes current targeted therapies that have received regulatory approval for the treatment of B- and T-cell lymphomas.Over the last 20 years, new drug therapies for lymphomas of B cells and T cells have expanded considerably. Targeted therapies for B-cell lymphomas include: (1) monoclonal antibodies directed at the CD20 lymphocyte antigen, examples of which are rituximab, ofatumumab, and obinutuzumab; () gene transfer therapy, an example of which is chimeric antigen receptor-modified T-cell (CAR-T) therapy directed at the CD19 antigen expressed on the cell surface of both immature and mature B cells; and (3) small-molecule inhibitors (ibrutinib, acalabrutinib, copanlisib, duvelisib, and idelalisib) that target the B-cell receptor signaling pathway. Of note, brentuximab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate that targets CD30, another lymphocyte antigen expressed on the cell surface of both Hodgkin lymphoma (a variant of B-cell lymphoma) and some T-cell lymphomas. Although aberrant epigenetic signaling pathways are present in both B- and T-cell lymphomas, epigenetic inhibitors (examples include belinostat, vorinostat, and romidepsin) are currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for T-cell lymphomas only. In addition, therapies that target the tumor microenvironment have been developed. Examples include mogamulizumab, bortezomib, lenalidomide, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab. In summary, the efficacy of these agents has led to the development of supportive care to mitigate adverse effects, due to the presence of on- or off-target toxicities.The therapeutic landscape of lymphomas has continued to evolve. In turn, the efficacy of these agents has led to the development of supportive care to mitigate adverse effects, due to the presence of on- or off-target toxicities. Further opportunities are warranted to identify patients who are most likely to achieve durable response and reduce the risk of disease progression.

Repeat chemotherapy shows decreasing efficacy and increasing toxicity with each course. Newer therapies targeting BRAF/MEK or Bruton's tyrosine kinase are effective but generally leave MRD. Rituximab has modest activity as a single agent and can achieve MRD-negative CR in combination with purine analogs, but there is significant toxicity from the chemotherapy. Moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk (Moxe) is a biologic containing an antibody fragment (Fv) binding to CD22, attached to a portion of  exotoxin A. Binding to CD22 enables the toxin to enter and kill cells. Moxe is administered by 30-minute infusions on days 1, 3, and 5 of up to six cycles spaced 4 weeks apart. In phase I testing, 64% of 33 patients at the highest dose level achieved CR, most without MRD. Lack of MRD correlated with prolonged CR duration; of 11 MRD-negative CRs, 10 were still in CR after a median of 42 months of observation. In pivotal testing, 75% of 80 patients had a hematologic response, 41% with CR; 82% (27/33) of CRs were MRD-negative, and only 4 of the 27 MRD-negative patients relapsed during the follow-up period. Hemolytic uremic syndrome and capillary leak syndrome were each observed in 9% of patients, all reversible. In September 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Moxe for the treatment of relapsed/refractory HCL after ≥ prior therapies. Moxe is undergoing further development in combination with rituximab. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) has effective treatments including purine analogs with and without rituximab, and oral inhibitors of BRAF, MEK and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). Despite these therapies, relapse occurs, and moxetumomab pasudotox has an important role in relapsed and refractory HCL because of its ability to achieve high rates of complete remissions (CRs) without chemotherapy; most of these CRs are without minimal residual disease (MRD). CR duration is enhanced in patients who achieve eradication of MRD. To improve the efficacy of this recombinant immunotoxin, a phase I trial is underway in combination with rituximab to reduce tumor burden and decrease immunogenicity.Published 2019.

The aim of this study was to design a more efficient vaccine against novel target for the treatment of hypertension.The epitope CE12, derived from the human L-type calcium channel (Ca 1.), was designed and conjugated with Qβ bacteriophage virus-like particles to test the efficacy in hypertensive animals. Further, the HBcAg-CE12-CQ10 vaccine, a bivalent vaccine based on hepatitis B core antigen virus-like particles and targeting both human angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT R) and Ca 1., was developed and evaluated in hypertensive rodents.The Qβ-CE12 vaccine effectively decreased the blood pressure in hypertensive rodents. Monoclonal antibody against CE12 specifically bound to L-type calcium channel and inhibited the channel. Injection with monoclonal antibody against CE12 effectively reduced the blood pressure in angiotensin II-induced hypertensive mice. The HBcAg-CE12-CQ10 vaccine showed antihypertensive effect in hypertensive mice and relatively superior antihypertensive effects in spontaneously hypertensive rats and ameliorated L-NAME-induced renal injury. In addition, no obvious immune-mediated damage or electrophysiological adverse effects were detected. against both AT R and Ca 1. decreased the blood pressure in hypertensive rodents effectively, and provided protection against hypertensive target organ damage without obvious feedback activation of renin-angiotensin system or induction of dominant antibodies against the carrier protein.

This inefficacy might be due to inefficient generation of anti-tumor cellular immune responses.This study aimed to assess the potential of using self-assembled nanofibers as a new vaccine platform to elicit potent HPV antigen - specific anti-tumor immunity.A HPV16 E7 peptide was chemically appended to the N terminus of self-assembling peptide Q11. The nanofibers were prepared and used to immunize mice through a preventive or therapeutic strategy in a TC-1 graft tumor model.Preventive immunization with nanofibers almost completely suppressed the growth of primarily grafted TC-1 tumors and even a re-challenge of tumor cells after a six-week rest. Therapeutic immunization significantly increased the levels of effector Th1 cells, CTLs and the cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α in E7 peptide-stimulated splenocytes, and the immunization reduced Th2, MDSC and IL-4 contents compared to the controls. The nanofiber immunization significantly suppressed the growth of established tumors and achieved 66.7% and 50% tumor-free in mice carrying -3 mm tumors and even larger tumors with a diameter of 5-6 mm respectively. In addition, the nanofibers were more efficient than the corresponding unassembled peptides for the treatment of established larger size tumors.The results indicated that self-assembling nanofibers could elicit robust HPV antigen -specific anti-tumor cellular immunity and are a potent antigen delivery system for HPV related tumor vaccines.© 2019 Li et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670623>Non-Ige Mediated Food Allergy.</a></h1><p>Food allergies, defined as an immune response to food proteins, affect as many as 8% of young children and % of adults in westernized countries, and their prevalence appears to be rising like all allergic diseases. In addition to well-recognized urticaria and anaphylaxis triggered by IgE antibody-mediated immune responses, there is an increasing recognition of cell-mediated disorders such as eosinophilic esophagitis and food protein-induced enterocolitis. Non-IgE-Mediated gastrointestinal food allergies are an heterogeneous group of food allergies in which there is an immune reaction against food but the primary pathogenesis is not a production of IgE and activation of mastcells and basophils. Those diseases tend to affect mainly the gastrointestinal tract and can present as acute (FPIES) or chronic reaction such as Celiac disease, Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE), Food Protein Induced Allergic Proctocolitis (FPIAP). The role of food allergy in Non-EoE gastrointestinal Eosinophilc disorders (Non-EoE EGID) is poorly defined. In some diseases like Celiac Disease and possibly EoE T cell seems to play a major role in initiating the immunological reaction against food, however in FPIES and FPIAP the mechanism of sensitization is not clear. Diagnosis require food challenges and/or endoscopies in most of the patients. Celiac disease have some validated biomarkers but none of the other Non-IgE mediated food allergies have such biomarkers that can be used for monitoring or diagnosis of the diseases. Treatment of Non-IgE food allergy rely on diet (FPIES, Celiac disease and EoE) and/or use of drugs (i.e steroids, PPI) in EoE and Non-EoE EGID.

The objectives of this study were to examine the patterns of response and survival in patients treated with combination ipilimumab and anti-PD-1 therapy (IPI + PD1) and to explore the nature of pseudoprogression and acquired resistance.Patients with metastatic melanoma who received treatment with first-line IPI + PD1 had all metastases ≥5 mm measured on computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging studies. The lesional response rate (LRR) and the overall response rate (ORR) were determined according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1.In total, 140 patients who had 833 metastases were studied. The ORR and the overall complete response (CR) rate decreased as tumor burden or the number of metastases increased. Metastases that had a CR (49%) were smaller than metastases without a CR (median, 13 vs 17 mm; P < .0001). Soft-tissue and lung metastases had the highest LRR (79% and 77%, respectively), whereas liver metastases had the lowest (46%). In multivariate analysis, patients with lung metastases had superior ORR (odds ratio [OR], .75; P = .02) and progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; P = .02), whereas those with liver metastases had inferior ORR (OR, 0.33; P = .02), progression-free survival (HR, 4.03; P < .01), and overall survival (HR, 3.17; P = .01). Pseudoprogression occurred in one-third of patients who had progressive disease as their best response, with an overall survival that was comparable to that of patients without disease progression. Acquired resistance occurred in 12% of responders after a median of 9.6 months, with an overall survival rate of 83% at 1 year from progression.Metastases in different anatomical locations display distinct response patterns and also are associated with overall response and survival with combination .

Like many infectious agents, EBV has evolved strategies to block host cell death, including through expression of viral homologues of cellular BCL- pro-survival proteins (vBCL-2s), such as BHRF1. Small molecule inhibitors of the cellular pro-survival BCL- family proteins, termed 'BH3-mimetics', have entered clinical trials for blood cancers with the BCL- inhibitor venetoclax already approved for treatment of therapy refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and acute myeloid leukaemia in the elderly. The generation of BH3-mimetics that could specifically target vBCL- proteins may be an attractive therapeutic option for virus-associated cancers, since these drugs would be expected to only kill virally infected cells with only minimal side effects on normal healthy tissues. To achieve this, a better understanding of the contribution of vBCL- proteins to tumorigenesis and insights into their biochemical functions is needed. In the context of Burkitt lymphoma (BL), BHRF1 expression conferred strong resistance to diverse apoptotic stimuli. Furthermore, BHRF1 expression in mouse haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells accelerated MYC-induced lymphoma development in a model of BL. BHRF1 interacts with the cellular pro-apoptotic BCL- proteins, BIM, BID, PUMA and BAK, but its capability to inhibit apoptosis could not be mapped solely to one of these interactions, suggesting plasticity is a key feature of BHRF1. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed a site in BHRF1 that was critical for its interaction with PUMA and blocking DNA-damage-induced apoptosis, identifying a potentially therapeutically targetable vulnerability in BHRF1.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662753>Factors Influencing the Efficacy of Anti-PD-1 Therapy in Chinese Patients with Advanced Melanoma.</a></h1><p>Anti-PD-1 antibody improves the survival of patients with advanced melanoma. However, the efficacy and safety of anti-programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody have not been fully elucidated in Chinese melanoma patients, who show high frequency of mucosal and acral melanoma subtypes; besides, the factors influencing the efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibody have not been evaluated broadly.Patients with advanced melanoma treated with regimens containing anti-PD-1 antibody from June 2016 to January 2019 were evaluated. Baseline characteristics and blood parameters were assessed, and outcome and adverse events were evaluated according to different regimens. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for univariate and multivariate analyses.A total of 51 patients with advanced melanoma were included in this study. The overall objective response rate (ORR) was 17.6%, the disease control rate was 58.5%, and the median time to progression was 5. months. The ORR of patients with PD-1 blockade-based combination therapy, without liver metastases and higher level of C-reactive protein (CRP) before PD-1 blockade, is higher than that of those not. Univariate analysis based on clinical features showed that ECOG scores, liver metastasis, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and CRP levels were the factors affecting time to progression (TTP). Multivariate analysis showed that elevated CRP before PD-1 blockade was an independent predictive factor for ORR of PD-1 blockade therapy (=0.009), while only Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score was an independent predictor for TTP (=0.032). The treatment was well tolerated in these cohort patients, and there was no treatment-related death.Anti-PD-1 antibody-containing regimen was safe and effective in Chinese patients with advanced melanoma, and elevated CRP and ECOG score were independent factors predicting the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy.Copyright © 2019 Lingdi Zhao et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608213>Efficacy and Safety of 12-week Interferon-based Danoprevir Regimen in Patients with Genotype 1 Chronic Hepatitis C.</a></h1><p> Genotype (GT) 1 remains the predominant hepatitis c virus (HCV) GT in Chinese patients.

Overall, 140 patients completed the 12-week treatment, and 97.1% (136/140) patients achieved sustained virologic response at 12 weeks (per protocol population group, 95% confidence interval: 92.9-99.%). Only drug-related serious adverse event occurred. Most of the adverse events were grade 1 and grade  alanine aminotransferase elevation or liver dysfunction. One patient discontinued treatment because of severe head injury in a car accident.  The triple regimen of ritonavir-boosted danoprevir plus pegylated-interferon α-2a and ribavirin produced a sustained virologic response rate of 97.1% after 12 weeks treatment in noncirrhotic HCV GT1-infected Chinese patients, and was safe and well tolerated.

It is most commonly applied to patients with myeloid malignancies who are not suitable candidates for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. This review highlights the past  years of work on stem/progenitor cell products in the field of nonengrafting donor leukocyte infusion (NE-DLI), with a focus on applications of MST in acute myeloid leukemia (AML).Assessing the utility of MST is hampered by lack of randomized controlled trials and by variability in donor selection algorithms, treatment timing, and unknown factors. The inherent complexity of the bidirectional alloreactive reactions, implicating many cell types, makes it challenging to move beyond correlative, population-level biology toward mechanistic explanations for MST's actions in any given patient-donor pair. Yet there are indicators that by stimulating a recipient-vs.-tumor effect, MST might substantially improve complete remission rates in AML and that it might find a role in postremission therapy.The mechanistic underpinnings of MST are gradually being disentangled and its clinical development remains in early stages.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679206>Pancreatic Cancer: An Emphasis on Current Perspectives in .</a></h1><p>Pancreatic cancer affects both male and female individuals with higher incidences and death rates among the male population. Detection of this malignancy is delayed due to the lack of symptoms in the early-stage cancer, which makes it extremely difficult to treat. Identifying effective strategies has been a challenge for improving the survival rates in pancreatic cancer patients. Resistance to chemotherapy is often developed in pancreatic cancer treatment. Although many strategies are under clinical trials to target certain markers associated with cancer, immunotherapeutic approaches are currently gaining importance.  for pancreatic cancer is in the limelight after preclinical research showed some promise.  approaches were tested along with other treatment options to enhance the treatment effect. Adoptive cell transfer and immune checkpoint inhibitors are currently in clinical trials. The Food and Drug Administration approved pembrolizumab in a fast-tracked review for advanced pancreatic cancer patients. Pembrolizumab blocks the checkpoint protein, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), on T cells to boost the response of the immune system against cancer cells, thereby shrinking tumors. The recent developments in  and the early success in other cancers are encouraging to further test  in pancreatic cancer. The combination of pembrolizumab and pelareorep, an isolate of human reovirus, is in phase II clinical study in metastatic disease. Depending on the results of current clinical trials and testing, the strategies in the pipeline are expected to increase the use of  in the clinical testing setting. Success in  is urgently needed to address the side-effects, treating patients with advanced disease and reducing metastasis for increasing the survival rate in pancreatic cancer patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31570675>[Association between admission diagnosis and  outcome in patients with autoimmune epilepsy].</a></h1><p>To evaluate the impact of admission diagnosis on seizure outcome in patients with autoimmune epilepsy (AE).  Methods: We conducted a retrospective study on 40 AE patients at Department of Neurology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University from Jan. 1st, 2017 to Nov. 21st, 2018. According to their admission diagnosis, these patients were further assigned into  groups: An AE diagnosed group and an AE undiagnosed group. Demographic data, clinical characteristics, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), electroencephalogram, and brain imaging were compared between the  groups. Favorable seizure outcome was defined as >50% reduction of seizure frequency at the first follow-up. The impact of admission diagnosis on seizure outcome of AE patients was analyzed.  Results: The ages of 40 AE patients were (33.23±16.41) years, comprising 19 males and 21 females. No significant difference was found between the AE diagnosed group and the AE undiagnosed group in gender, age, central nervous system-specific Ab profile, CSF, and brain imaging. Duration of symptom onset to Ab detection was significantly longer in the AE undiagnosed group than that in the AE diagnosed group (P<0.01). Duration of symptom onset to  was also significantly longer in the AE undiagnosed group than that in the AE diagnosed group (P<0.001). There were more patients with favorable seizure outcome in the AE diagnosed group than the AE undiagnosed group (P<0.05).  Conclusion: Admission diagnosis for patients with AE is associated with seizure outcome after . For adult-onset epilepsy or epilepsy with unknown etiology, the diagnosis of AE should be considered. Early diagnosis of AE and prompt initiation of immunosuppressive treatment are crucial to increase the likelihood of achieving favorable seizure outcome.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667366>Identification of a monoclonal antibody that targets PD-1 in a manner requiring PD-1 Asn58 glycosylation.</a></h1><p>Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) is inhibitory receptor and immune checkpoint protein. Blocking the interaction of PD-1 and its ligands PD-L1/ L2 is able to active T-cell-mediated antitumor response. Monoclonal antibody-based drugs targeting PD-1 pathway have exhibited great promise in cancer therapy. Here we show that MW11-h317, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, displays high affinity for PD-1 and blocks PD-1 interactions with PD-L1/L2. MW11-h317 can effectively induce T-cell-mediated immune response and inhibit tumor growth in mouse model. Crystal structure of PD-1/MW11-h317 Fab complex reveals that both the loops and glycosylation of PD-1 are involved in recognition and binding, in which Asn58 glycosylation plays a critical role. The unique glycan epitope in PD-1 to MW11-h317 is different from the first two approved clinical PD-1 antibodies, nivolumab and pembrolizumab. These results suggest MW11-h317 as a therapeutic monoclonal antibody of PD-1 glycosylation-targeting which may become efficient alternative for cancer therapy.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626462>[Challenges in the implementation of HPV vaccination for cancer prevention].</a></h1><p>In France, every year, HPVs cause approximately 6,300 cancers -cervix, anus, oropharynx, penis, vulva, vagina, oral cavity, larynx- representing % of all incident cancers, 35,000 precancerous le-sions of the cervix, and at least 50,000 condylomas in the under- 30s. All 3,000 new cases of cervical cancers are attributable to HPV infections. Cervical cancer prevention is based on the combination of two complementary strategies: vaccination of 11 to 14-years-old girls against HPV and organized screening of cervical cancer for women between 25 and 65 years old. In France, the vaccination coverage rate -VCR- against HPV for  vaccine doses is less than 25% while it reaches more than 80% in the United Kingdom, Portugal, Australia, etc. This low level of VCR can be explained by the mistrust in these vaccines especially regarding their effectiveness and safety. However, more than 10 years after their commercialization, HPV vaccines have already demonstrated, in many countries, their effectiveness against HPV infections, genital warts and precancerous cervical lesions. In addition, no association between vaccines and autoimmune diseases has been demonstrated, either by national or international surveillance authorities, or by scientific publications, after the commercialization of 200 million doses worldwide. As the International Papillomavirus Society has declared that the combination of a high VCR against HPV and a high participation in cervical cancer screening, combined with appropriate treatment, can lead to the elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem, it is important to better communicate the scientific findings in order to better understand vaccination's benefits.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31582344>Development of a topical liposomal formulation of Amphotericin B for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis.</a></h1><p>Currently, there is no topical treatment available for any form of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in most of the endemic areas. The aim of the current study was to develop a topical nano-liposomal Amphotericin B (AmB) for the treatment of CL.Liposomes containing 0.1, 0. and 0.4% AmB (Lip-AmB) were formulated and characterized for the size, entrapment efficiency, long term stability, and skin penetration properties using Franz diffusion cells. Liposomes diameters were around 100 nm with no change during more than 20 months' storage either at 4 °C or at room temperature. Franz diffusion cells studies showed that almost 4% of the applied formulations penetrated across the skin and the highest skin retention (73.92%) observed with Lip-AmB 0.4%. The median effective doses (ED), the doses of AmB required to kill 50% of L. major amastigotes were 0.151, 0.151, and 0.0856 (μg/mL) in Lip-AmB 0.1, 0., 0.4%, respectively. Lip-AmB 0.4% caused 80% reduction in fluorescence intensity of GFP+ L. tropica infected macrophages at 5 μg/mL of AmB concentration. Topical Lip-AmB was applied twice a day for 4 weeks to the skin of BALB/c mice to treat lesions caused by L. major. Results showed the superiority of Lip-AmB 0.4% compared to Lip-AmB 0. and 0.1%. The parasite was completely cleared from the skin site of infection and spleens at week 8 and 12 post-infection in mice treated with Lip-AmB 0.4%. The results suggest that topical Lip-AmB 0.4% may be a useful tool in the treatment of CL and merits further investigation.Copyright © 2019.

However, even in the EGFR canonical-mutant LADC, other accompanying alterations surface which may have a major impact in prognosis and open possibilities to explore new therapeutic approaches.Complex genomic rearrangements, including chromothripsis and chromoplexy, are the origin of most-known fusion oncogenes, including echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase, Cluster of Differentiation 74-c-ros oncogene 1, and kinesin-1 heavy chain- rearranged during transfection. Quite often LADCs driven by fusion oncogenes are accompanied by SET domain containing  (SETD2) mutations. SETD2 mutations have been described in renal cancer and have been related to cisplatin resistance in LADCs. Suppression of the SETD2 function inhibits the signal transducer and transcription activator function and the interferon-signaling pathway, which could partially explain the lack of effectiveness of  in LADCs driven by fusion oncogenes.Targeted next-generation sequencing of DNA in the tumor tissue or in the circulating plasma of LADC is becoming indispensable for the accurate classification of LADCs that can receive appropriate targeted therapy. It is unquestionable that additional techniques, like RNA sequencing or the nCounter technology, can accomplish accurate assessment of an ample array of fusion oncogenes involved in LADCs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619447>Anti-NMDAR encephalitis: A single-center, longitudinal study in China.</a></h1><p>To describe the detailed clinical characteristics, , and long-term outcomes of patients with anti-NMDA receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis in China.A single-center, prospective study.

Despite increased complexity of anticancer therapies, studies evaluating physician-level experience and cancer treatment outcomes are lacking.A population-based study was conducted of older adults (aged ≥66 years) diagnosed with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2004 through 2011 using SEER-Medicare data. Analysis focused on outcomes in patients receiving rituximab, the first approved monoclonal anticancer . We hypothesized that lower physician experience using rituximab and managing its infusion-related reactions would be associated with early treatment discontinuation. A 12-month look-back from each initiation of rituximab was used to categorize physician volume (0, 1-, or ≥3 initiations per year). Modified Poisson regression was used to account for provider-level correlation and estimated relative risk (RR) of early rituximab discontinuation (<3 cycles within 180 days of rituximab initiation). Cox proportional hazards were used to measure the impact of rituximab discontinuation on survival.Among 15,110 patients who initiated rituximab with ,684 physicians, 7.6% experienced early rituximab discontinuation. Approximately one-fourth of patients (26.1%) initiated rituximab with a physician who had no rituximab initiations during the preceding 12 months. Compared with patients treated by physicians who had ≥3 rituximab initiations in the prior year, those treated by physicians without initiations were 57% more likely to experience early discontinuation (adjusted RR [aRR], 1.57; 95% CI, 1.35-1.82; P<.001 for 0 vs ≥3, and aRR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.03-1.37; P=.02 for 1- vs ≥3). Additionally, rituximab discontinuation was associated with higher risk of death (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.28-1.52; P<.001).Lower oncologist experience with rituximab was associated with increased risk of early rituximab discontinuation in Medicare beneficiaries with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

A complete leukocyte blood count, the lymphocytic subpopulations and the percentages of both HLA-DR monocytes and dendritic cells (DC) were monitored. Disease control was defined as partial/complete response and stable disease on computed tomography scan according to RECIST 1.1. The predictive value of the immune cell parameters investigated was evaluated by patients' survival analysis. Forty percent of patients showed a clinical response, and the global median overall survival was 7.0 months (95% confidence interval: 3.5-10.5). Patients with an initial neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) ≥5., and/or an amount of HLA-DR monocytes ≥11% and/or a total DC level ≤0.4% of leukocytes did rarely respond to PD-1 inhibitor therapy. Otherwise, the -induced decrease of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and/or HLA-DR monocytes and the increase of total DC frequencies were correlated with improved therapy response and prolonged overall survival.

Before its introduction in the market, nivolumab was made available to NSCLC patients through an expanded access program (EAP). Here we present the Italian cohort of patients with non-squamous NSCLC enrolled in a worldwide nivolumab EAP, with subgroup analyses involving elderly patients, patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases and patients receiving nivolumab beyond progression.Pretreated patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC received nivolumab at 3 mg/kg every  weeks up to 24 months. Efficacy data (investigator-assessed tumour response, progression date and survival) and safety data were collected.1588 patients were treated across 153 Italian centres. Overall response rate and disease control rate were 18% and 44%, respectively; median overall survival (OS) was 11.3 months (95% CI: 10.-12.4). Elderly patients (≥70 n = 522; ≥75 n = 232) achieved outcomes similar to the global study population; patients with CNS metastases (n = 409) had an OS of 8.6 months (95% CI: 6.4-10.8), and a 1-year OS rate of 43%. Nivolumab was administered beyond progression to 276 patients (26%), 57 of whom achieved subsequent disease control; the median OS of patients receiving nivolumab beyond progression was 16. months (95% CI: 14.0-18.4), while 1-year OS rate was 62%.To date, this is the largest clinical experience with nivolumab in a real-world setting.

However, whether peripheral blood could be used as an alternative minimally invasive source to identify lymphocytes targeting neoantigens in patients with GI cancer with relatively low mutation burden is unclear. We used a personalized high-throughput screening strategy to investigate whether PD-1 expression in peripheral blood could be used to identify CD8+ or CD4+ lymphocytes recognizing neoantigens identified by whole-exome sequencing in 7 patients with GI cancer. We found that neoantigen-specific lymphocytes were preferentially enriched in the CD8+PD-1+/hi or CD4+PD-1+/hi subsets, but not in the corresponding bulk or PD-1- fractions. In 6 of 7 individuals analyzed we identified circulating CD8+ and CD4+ lymphocytes targeting 6 and 4 neoantigens, respectively. Moreover, neoantigen-reactive T cells and a T cell receptor (TCR) isolated from the CD8+PD-1+ subsets recognized autologous tumor, albeit at reduced levels, in  patients with available cell lines. These data demonstrate the existence of circulating T cells targeting neoantigens in GI cancer patients and provide an approach to generate enriched populations of personalized neoantigen-specific lymphocytes and isolate TCRs that could be exploited therapeutically to treat cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602489>Potential clinical application of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte therapy for ovarian epithelial cancer prior or post-resistance to chemotherapy.</a></h1><p> has become a powerful treatment option for several solid tumor types.

The average number of intraepithelial TILs (iTILs) and the average density of stromal TILs (sTILs) were calculated separately.High iTIL count (≥ per high-power field) was associated with MSI-high, whereas high sTIL density (≥20% on ×200 magnification) was not. High iTIL count and high sTIL density were related to distal tumor location, medullary carcinoma, high Crohn-like lymphoid reaction counts, and fewer pancreatic invasions. SIAC patients with high iTIL count or high sTIL density had better survival than those with low values. On multivariate analysis, MSI, high sTIL density, proximal locations, lower N category, and absence of lymphovascular invasions and retroperitoneal seeding were the best independent prognostic predictors.High sTIL density can be used as a prognostic indicator and high iTIL count may provide a basis for the clinical use of targeted  in SIAC patients.© American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2019.

Although axicabtagene ciloleucel is administered only at authorized treatment centers, community oncologists play a critical role in the CAR T-cell treatment journey, recognizing potentially eligible patients for referral and then, after treatment, closely collaborating with treatment centers to monitor and manage patients long term. ZUMA-1, the pivotal, multicenter, phase I/II study of 108 patients treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel, resulted in an objective response rate of 83%, including 58% complete responses. With a 27.1-month median follow-up, 39% of patients had ongoing responses. CAR T-cell therapy is associated with the potentially life-threatening adverse events (AEs) of cytokine release syndrome and neurologic events, which generally occur early after treatment. In ZUMA-1, cytokine release syndrome and neurologic events were generally reversible and grade ≥3 cytokine release syndrome and neurologic events occurred in 11% and 32% of patients, respectively. Frequent prolonged AEs included hypogammaglobulinemia, B-cell aplasia, and cytopenias requiring supportive care until recovery of hematopoietic function. Rate of treatment-related mortality was low, at <%. With appropriate management of common AEs, axicabtagene ciloleucel offers the potential for long-term durable responses in patients who otherwise lack curative treatment options. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Community oncologists should be familiar with key aspects of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell indications and eligibility to help recognize and refer potential patients for this paradigm-changing treatment option at the appropriate time during the disease course. To ensure optimal long-term outcomes for patients who have been treated with CAR T-cell therapy, oncologists must also be familiar with common prolonged AEs and their monitoring and management.© AlphaMed Press 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624089>Amphiphysin-IgG autoimmune neuropathy: A recognizable clinicopathologic syndrome.</a></h1><p>To define the clinicopathologic features of amphiphysin-immunoglobulin G (IgG)-mediated neuropathy.Patients examined at our institution from January 1, 1995, to September 30, 2018, with amphiphysin-IgG by indirect immunofluorescence and Western blot, were reviewed.

Of 33 (60%) patients with neuropathy, 21 had amphiphysin-IgG alone, and 12 had coexisting autoantibodies (ANNA1-IgG, n = 8; CRMP5-IgG, n = ; ANNA1-IgG and CRMP5-IgG, n = ). The neuropathies in isolated amphiphysin-IgG autoimmunity included polyradiculoneuropathy (62%), diffuse sensory neuronopathy (35%), and facial neuropathy with gastroparesis (3%). Among these, pain (80%), breast cancer (63%), and CNS (57%) involvements commonly coexisted, and neuropathy frequently prompted breast cancer diagnosis (76%). Stiff-person spectrum disorder was the most common CNS accompaniment (45%). Nerve biopsies showed axonal loss (n = 6/6), subperineurial edema (n = 4/6), and CD4 predominant inflammation (n = /6). Median mRS score at last follow-up was 3.5; 58% of patients were -responsive. Patients with amphiphysin-IgG alone had more favorable  response than patients with CRMP5-IgG polyneuropathy (n = 45) (44% vs 16%,  = 0.028, odds ratio 4., 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 15.5). Only 1/9 (11%) patients with amphiphysin-IgG with coexisting CRMP5-IgG or ANNA1-IgG had  response. RNA amphiphysin expression occurred at low levels in nerve.Amphiphysin-IgG autoimmune neuropathy has a recognizable phenotype, is frequently immune responsive, and can prompt early diagnosis of breast cancer.© 2019 American Academy of Neurology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652645>Epigenetic Reprogramming for Targeting -Mutant Malignant Gliomas.</a></h1><p>Targeting the epigenome has been considered a compelling treatment modality for several cancers, including gliomas. Nearly 80% of the lower-grade gliomas and secondary glioblastomas harbor recurrent mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (). Mutant IDH generates high levels of -hydroxyglutarate (-HG) that inhibit various components of the epigenetic machinery, including histone and DNA demethylases. The encouraging results from current epigenetic therapies in hematological malignancies have reinvigorated the interest in solid tumors and gliomas, both preclinically and clinically. Here, we summarize the recent advancements in epigenetic therapy for lower-grade gliomas and discuss the challenges associated with current treatment options. A particular focus is placed on therapeutic mechanisms underlying favorable outcome with epigenetic-based drugs in basic and translational research of gliomas. This review also highlights emerging bridges to combination treatment with respect to epigenetic drugs. Given that epigenetic therapies, particularly DNA methylation inhibitors, increase tumor immunogenicity and antitumor immune responses, appropriate drug combinations with immune checkpoint inhibitors may lead to improvement of treatment effectiveness of , ultimately leading to tumor cell eradication.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31571226>Recent developments and highlights in allergic rhinitis.</a></h1><p>Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a disease with high prevalence all over the world and therefore needs to be thoroughly investigated and treated accordingly. The mechanisms underlying the pathology and treatment of AR have been widely studied, but many aspects remain unclear and warrant further investigations. This review presents an overview of recently published papers highlighting the risk factors, mechanisms, and treatment of AR. Additionally, recent studies discussing the role of single nucleotide polymorphism, DNA methylation, regulatory B cells, group  innate lymphoid cells, , and biologics in AR are also covered.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S .

In the current study, the authors explored the association between types of fat and survival in patients treated with .A retrospective analysis of 90 patients who were treated with  on phase 1 clinical trials at the Winship Cancer Institute in Atlanta, Georgia, from 2009 through 2017 was performed. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were used to measure clinical outcomes. Baseline BMI and radiographic images at the middle of the third lumbar vertebrae were obtained. Fat densities were calculated and converted to indices (subcutaneous fat index [SFI], intermuscular fat index [IFI], and visceral fat index [VFI]) after dividing by height in meters squared. Risk groups were created using recursive partitioning and the regression trees method for SFI and IFI, which were selected by stepwise variable selection among all fat-related variables. The Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier method were used for the association with OS and PFS.The majority of patients (59%) were male and diagnosed with melanoma (33%) or gastrointestinal cancers (22%). The median BMI was 27.4 kg/m , the median SFI was 62.78, the median IFI was 4.06, and the median VFI was 40.53. Low-risk patients (those with an SFI ≥73) had a significantly longer OS (hazard ratio, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.09-0.46 [P < .001]) and PFS (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20-0.72 [P = .003]) compared with patients at intermediate risk (those with an SFI <73 and IFI <3.4) and poor risk (those with an SFI <73 and IFI ≥3.4). The Uno concordance statistics were found to be higher for fat risk groups than BMI in predicting OS (0.603 vs 0.574; P = .581) and PFS (0.602 vs 0.586; P = .71).Increased BMI, increased SFI, and decreased IFI may be associated with prolonged survival in patients with cancer who are treated with .

Typically, CARs contain a scFv. Most often, scfvs are derived from a monoclonal antibody of murine origin and may be a trigger for host immune system that leads to the T-cell clearance. Nanobody is a specific antigen-binding fragment derived from camelid that has great homology to human VH and low immunogenic potential. Therefore, in this study, nanobody was employed instead of scFv in CAR construct.In this study, a CAR was constructed based on a nanobody against PSMA (NBPII-CAR). At first, Jurkat cells were electroporated with NBPII-CAR, and then flow cytometry was performed for NBPII-CAR expression. For functional analysis, CAR T cells were co-cultured with prostate cancer cells and analyzed for IL- secretion, CD25 expression, and cell proliferation.Flow cytometry results confirmed the expression of NBPII-CAR on the transfected Jurkat cells. Our data showed the specificity of engineered Jurkat cells against prostate cancer cells by not only increasing the IL- cytokine (about 370 pg/ml) but also expressing the T-cell activation marker CD25 (about 30%). In addition, proliferation of engineered Jurkat cells increased nearly 60% when co-cultured with LNCaP (PSMA+), as compared with DU145 (PSMA-).Here, we describe the ability of nanobody-based CAR to recognize PSMA that leads to the activation of Jurkat cells. This construct might be used as a promising candidate for clinical applications in prostate cancer therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31588654>Neuronal antibodies in adult patients with new-onset seizures: A prospective study.</a></h1><p> in addition to antiepileptic drugs can improve seizure freedom rates in autoimmune epilepsy, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis. A diagnosis of autoimmune epilepsy can be supported by presence of serum antibodies to neuronal antigens. We asked how often neuronal antibodies are found in the serum of unselected adult patients with new-onset seizures and whether such testing could improve detection of autoimmune epilepsy.We included 44 patients over the age of 25 presenting after at least one unprovoked seizure to the Neurology Clinic at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden. The median time between the first-ever seizure in life and the serum sampling was 50 days (range 22-11,000). Antibody testing in serum was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The patients were followed for at least 1 year.Epilepsy could be diagnosed already at the first visit in 21/44 patients (47.7%). Two patients (4.5%) were positive for neuronal antibodies: one against contactin-associated protein  (CASPR-) and one against glutamate acid decarboxylase (GAD). Three patients (6.7%) displayed very weak immunoreactivity that was deemed clinically insignificant. One of the antibody-positive patients had only a single seizure. The other had a focal cortical dysplasia and was seizure-free on levetiracetam. None of the five patients with antibodies or immunoreactivity displayed any feature of autoimmune epilepsy.We conclude that indiscriminate testing in patients presenting to a first seizure clinic with new-onset seizures or epilepsy is unlikely to improve detection of autoimmune epilepsy.© 2019 The Authors.
