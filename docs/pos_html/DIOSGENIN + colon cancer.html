In this study, the effects of dioscin against human cervical carcinoma HeLa and SiHa cells were further confirmed, and the possible mechanism(s) were investigated. A transmission electron microscopy (TEM) assay and DAPI staining were used to detect the cellular morphology. Flow cytometry was used to assay cell apoptosis, ROS and Ca(2+) levels. Single cell gel electrophoresis and immunofluorescence assays were used to test DNA damage and cytochrome C release. The results showed that dioscin significantly inhibited cell proliferation and caused DNA damage in HeLa and SiHa cells. The mechanistic investigation showed that dioscin caused the release of cytochrome C from mitochondria into the cytosol. In addition, dioscin significantly up-regulated the protein levels of Bak, Bax, Bid, p53, caspase-3, caspase-9, and down-regulated the protein levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl. Our work thus demonstrated that dioscin notably induces apoptosis in HeLa and SiHa cells through adjusting ROS-mediated DNA damage and the mitochondrial signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29389802>Dioscin inhibits  cells' growth by reactive oxygen species-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and p38 and JNK pathways.</a></h2><p>Dioscin is a natural steroid saponin derived from several plants that shows potent anticancer effects against a variety of  cells. Here, we investigated the antitumor effect of dioscin against human  cells and evaluated the molecular mechanism involved in this process. The cell cytotoxicity was studied by the MTT assay and BrdU incorporation. The proapoptotic mechanism of dioscin was characterized by flow cytometry analysis. A western blot and an immunofluorescence staining were used to investigate how dioscin induces apoptosis in vitro. In our study, dioscin could significantly inhibit the growth of  cells in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner. Dioscin induces apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, promoting the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, Bax translocation to the mitochondria, cytochrome C release to cytosol, activations of caspase-9/3, PARP cleavage, and subsequent apoptosis. Dioscin-induced apoptosis was accompanied by sustained phosphorylation of JNK, p38-MAPK. N-acetyl-L-cysteine, a scavenger of ROS, significantly reversed dioscin-induced cell death and activation of JNK and p38. Collectively, the data indicate that the induction of apoptosis by dioscin is mediated through ROS proteins, which are critical upstream signals for JNK/p38-MAPK activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25821990>Chemistry and anticarcinogenic mechanisms of glycoalkaloids produced by eggplants, potatoes, and tomatoes.</a></h2><p>Inhibition of  can occur via apoptosis, a genetically directed process of cell self-destruction that involves numerous biomarkers and signaling pathways. Glycoalkaloids are nitrogen-containing secondary plant metabolites found in numerous Solanaceous plants including eggplants, potatoes, and tomatoes. Exposure of  cells to glycoalkaloids produced by eggplants (α-solamargine and α-solasonine), potatoes (α-chaconine and α-solanine), and tomatoes (α-tomatine) or their hydrolysis products (mono-, di-, and trisaccharide derivatives and the aglycones solasodine, solanidine, and tomatidine) inhibits the growth of the cells in culture (in vitro) as well as tumor growth in vivo. This overview comprehensively surveys and consolidates worldwide efforts to define the following aspects of these natural compounds: (a) their prevalence in the three foods; (b) their chemistry and structure-activity relationships; (c) the reported factors (biomarkers, signaling pathways) associated with apoptosis of bone, breast, cervical, , gastric, glioblastoma, leukemia, liver, lung, lymphoma, melanoma, pancreas, prostate, and squamous cell carcinoma cell lines in vitro and the in vivo inhibition of tumor formation and growth in fish and mice and in human skin cancers; and (d) future research needs. The described results may make it possible to better relate the structures of the active compounds to their health-promoting function, individually, in combination, and in food, and allow the consumer to select glycoalkaloid-containing food with the optimal content of nontoxic beneficial compounds. The described findings are expected to be a valuable record and resource for further investigation of the health benefits of food-related natural compounds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25111127>Dioscin inhibits  tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis through regulating VEGFR2 and AKT/MAPK signaling pathways.</a></h2><p>Dioscin has shown cytotoxicity against  cells, but its in vivo effects and the mechanisms have not elucidated yet. The purpose of the current study was to assess the antitumor effects and the molecular mechanisms of dioscin. We showed that dioscin could inhibit tumor growth in vivo and has no toxicity at the test condition. The growth suppression was accompanied by obvious blood vessel decrease within solid tumors. We also found dioscin treatment inhibited the proliferation of  and endothelial cell lines, and most sensitive to primary cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). What's more, analysis of HUVECs migration, invasion, and tube formation exhibited that dioscin has significantly inhibitive effects to these actions. Further analysis of blood vessel formation in the matrigel plugs indicated that dioscin could inhibit VEGF-induced blood vessel formation in vivo. We also identified that dioscin could suppress the downstream protein kinases of VEGFR2, including Src, FAK, AKT and Erk1/2, accompanied by the increase of phosphorylated P38MAPK. The results potently suggest that dioscin may be a potential anticancer drug, which efficiently inhibits angiogenesis induced by VEGFR2 signaling pathway as well as AKT/MAPK pathways.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Keeping its stereochemistry rich architecture intact, a scheme for the synthesis of novel  analogues was designed using Cu (I)-catalysed alkyne-azide cycloaddition in order to study their structure-activity relationship. Both  and its analogues exhibited interesting anti-proliferative effect against four human  cell lines viz. HBL-100 (breast), A549 (lung), HT-29 () and HCT-116 () using [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide] (MTT) assay. Among the synthesized analogues, Dgn-1 bearing a simple phenyl R moiety attached via triazole to the parent molecule was identified as the most potent analogue against A549  cell line having IC of 5.54μM, better than the positive control (BEZ-235). Dgn-2 and Dgn-5 bearing o-nitrophenyl and o-cyanophenyl R moieties respectively, displayed impressive anti-proliferative activity against all the tested human  cell lines with IC values ranging from 5.77 to 9.44μM. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) revealed that the analogues with simple phenyl R moiety or electron withdrawing ortho substituted R moieties seem to have beneficial impact on the anti-proliferative activity.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.
