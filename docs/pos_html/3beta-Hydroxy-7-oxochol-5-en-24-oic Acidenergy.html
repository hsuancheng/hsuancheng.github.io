To this end, the retention of 22 analogues have been determined with phenyl, diol, bidentate anchored C18 (BDC18) and Diamond Hydride™ C18 (DHC18) substituted silica hydride stationary phases under isocratic chromatographic conditions using mobile phases containing 0.1 (% v/v) formic  and different acetonitrile or methanol contents from 10 to 90% (v/v) in 10% increments. In general, these compounds showed decreasing retention with increased acetonitrile or methanol content in the mobile phase with all the stationary phases. The retention order generally followed their log P values, although some unique selectivity variations were apparent depending on the nature of the selected stationary and mobile phases. These 22 compounds contained different backbone functionalities linking the phenyl ring A to phenyl ring B and different numbers of hydroxyl groups in the phenyl ring A/phenyl ring B. Structure-retention descriptors, derived according to LSER concepts, were analysed by PCA methods to provide group classification of these resveratrol analogues from the associated PC1 versus PC2 score plots. These results revealed that the selectivity of these compounds was dominated by hydrophobic and steric interactions. Based on the number and position of hydroxyl groups in a specific resveratrol analogue, a reliable curve fitting approach (indicated by R > 0.99 for the correlation between experimental and predicted log k values) was derived for prediction of the retention of these analytes under different mobile phase isocratic separation conditions. The application of similar methods are anticipated to find general utility for the analysis of diverse classes of other low molecular mass compounds in the different modes of liquid chromatography, permitting enhanced levels of prediction and evaluation of the retention attributes of polar and non-polar compounds.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Results showed that SCA pretreatment can selectively remove lignin with minimal impact on cellulose and hemicellulose. After up to 200 min of SCA treatment, 79.4% of lignin was removed and over 90% of the holocellulose was retained. The physicochemical changes after pretreatment were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy, X-ray diffractometer and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, showing that the majority of lignin was removed from secondary cell walls and cell middle lamella while the chlorite-resistant lignin remained in the cell corner. Lignin removal significantly enhanced the biodegradability from 59.6% to 86.4% and increased methane production by 38.3%.  balance showed that SCA pretreatment was efficient to increase the  output of hybrid Pennisetum.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

MMUT catalyzes the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, an anaplerotic reaction which feeds into the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle. As part of the pathological mechanisms of MMA, previous studies have suggested there is decreased TCA activity due to a "toxic inhibition" of TCA cycle enzymes by MMA related metabolites, in addition to reduced anaplerosis. Here, we have utilized mitochondria isolated from livers of a mouse model of MMA (Mut-ko/ki) and their littermate controls (Ki/wt) to examine the amounts and enzyme functions of most of the TCA cycle enzymes. We have performed mRNA quantification, protein semi-quantitation, and enzyme activity quantification for TCA cycle enzymes in these samples. Expression profiling showed increased mRNA levels of fumarate hydratase in the Mut-ko/ki samples, which by contrast had reduced protein levels as detected by immunoblot, while all other mRNA levels were unaltered. Immunoblotting also revealed decreased protein levels of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase 2. Interesting, the decreased protein amount of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase was reflected in decreased activity for this enzyme while there is a trend towards decreased activity of fumarate hydratase and malate dehydrogenase 2. Citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase 2/3, succinyl-CoA synthase, and succinate dehydrogenase are not statistically different in terms of quantity of enzyme or activity. Finally, we found decreased activity when examining the function of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase in series with succinate synthase and succinate dehydrogenase in the Mut-ko/ki mice compared to their littermate controls, as expected. This study demonstrates decreased activity of certain TCA cycle enzymes and by corollary decreased TCA cycle function, but it supports decreased protein quantity rather than "toxic inhibition" as the underlying mechanism of action. SUMMARY: Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) is an inborn metabolic disorder of propionate catabolism. In this disorder, toxic metabolites are considered to be the major pathogenic mechanism for acute and long-term complications. However, despite optimized therapies aimed at reducing metabolite levels, patients continue to suffer from late complications, including metabolic stroke and renal insufficiency. Since the propionate pathway feeds into the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle, we investigated TCA cycle function in a constitutive MMA mouse model. We demonstrated decreased amounts of the TCA enzymes, Mdh2 and Ogdh as semi-quantified by immunoblot. Enzymatic activity of Ogdh is also decreased in the MMA mouse model compared to controls. Thus, when the enzyme amounts are decreased, we see the enzymatic activity also decreased to a similar extent for Ogdh. Further studies to elucidate the structural and/or functional links between the TCA cycle and propionate pathways might lead to new treatment approaches for MMA patients.Copyright © 2019.

They play three major roles:  metabolism, structural, and signaling. They are dynamic molecules strongly influenced by endogenous and exogenous factors including genetics, diet, age, lifestyle, drugs, disease and inflammation. As precision medicine starts to become mainstream, there is a huge burgeoning interest in lipids and their potential to act as unique biomarkers or prognostic indicators. Lipids comprise a large component of all metabolites (around one-third), and our expanding knowledge about their dynamic behavior is fueling the hope that mapping their regulatory biochemical pathways on a systems level will revolutionize our ability to prevent, diagnose, and stratify major human diseases. Up to now, clinical lipid measurements have consisted primarily of total cholesterol or triglycerides, as a measure for cardiovascular risk and response to lipid lowering drugs. Nowadays, we are able to measure thousands of individual lipids that make up the lipidome. nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry (NMR) metabolomics is also being increasingly used in large cohort studies where it can report on total levels of selected lipid classes, and relative levels of fatty  saturation. To support the application of lipidomics research, LIPID MAPS was established in 2003, and since then has gone on to become the go-to resource for several lipid databases, lipid drawing tools, data deposition, and more recently lipidomics informatics tools, and a lipid biochemistry encyclopedia, LipidWeb. Alongside this, the recently established Lipidomics Standards Initiative plays a key role in standardization of lipidomics methodologies.

While it is clear that these monocopper enzymes have extended substrate-binding surfaces for interacting with their fibrous substrates, the structural determinants of LPMO substrate specificity remain largely unknown. To gain additional insight into substrate specificity in LPMOs, here we generated a mutant library of a cellulose-active family AA10 LPMO from  A3(2) (LPMO10C, also known as CelS2) having multiple substitutions at five positions on the substrate-binding surface that we identified by sequence comparisons. Screening of this library using a newly developed MS-based high-throughput assay helped identify multiple enzyme variants that contained four substitutions and exhibited significant chitinolytic activity and a concomitant decrease in cellulolytic activity. The chitin-active variants became more rapidly inactivated during catalysis than a natural chitin-active AA10 LPMO, an observation likely indicative of suboptimal substrate binding leading to autocatalytic oxidative damage of these variants. These results reveal several structural determinants of LPMO substrate specificity and underpin the notion that productive substrate binding by these enzymes is complex, depending on a multitude of amino  located on the substrate-binding surface.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636052>The Role of Diet in the Prevention of Diabetes among Women with Prior Gestational Diabetes: A Systematic Review of Intervention and Observational Studies.</a></h1><p>Women with prior gestational diabetes (GDM) have an increased lifetime risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). There are no up-to-date systematic reviews analyzing the relationship of diet with risk of developing T2DM following GDM.To systematically review the evidence from intervention and observational studies on effects of dietary interventions and associations of dietary intake with T2DM outcomes in women with a GDM history.Six electronic databases were searched (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Embase, Medline, Cochrane Central, Proquest, and Scopus) for articles published until May 2019. This review includes intervention and observational studies among women of any age with a history of GDM that reported on the effects of dietary interventions or association of dietary intake (, nutrients, foods, dietary patterns) with T2DM, impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, or prediabetes.The systematic review identified five articles reporting results from four intervention studies, and seven articles reporting results from four observational studies. Findings from intervention studies indicated trends toward beneficial effects of a low-glycemic index diet, a low-carbohydrate diet, and a diet in line with general population dietary guidelines, but studies had unclear or high risk of bias. Findings from two cross-sectional and one prospective study indicated poorer diabetes outcomes for women with higher intakes of branched-chain amino , total and heme iron, and a diet relatively low in carbohydrates and high in animal fat and protein, and better outcomes among those consuming diets rich in fruit, vegetables, nuts, fish, and legumes, and low in red and processed meats and sugar-sweetened beverages, after adjustment for confounders, including body mass index.Findings from observational studies support current dietary guidelines for the prevention of T2DM. Further dietary intervention studies are needed to confirm whether or not dietary modification following a GDM pregnancy reduces women's risk of developing T2DM.Copyright © 2019 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

Several halogen-containing L-phenylalanine-based ligands display high affinity and high selectivity for LAT1; nonetheless, their molecular mechanism of binding remains unclear. In this study, a combined in silico strategy consisting of homology modeling, molecular docking, and Quantum Mechanics-Molecular Mechanics (QM-MM) simulation was applied to elucidate the molecular basis of ligand binding in LAT1. First, a homology model of LAT1 based on the atomic structure of a prokaryotic homolog was constructed. Docking studies using a set of halogenated ligands allowed for deriving a binding hypothesis. Selected docking poses were subjected to QM-MM calculations to investigate the halogen interactions. Collectively, the results highlight the dual nature of the ligand-protein binding mode characterized by backbone hydrogen bond interactions of the amino  moiety of the ligands and residues I63, S66, G67, F252, G255, as well as hydrophobic interactions of the ligand's side chains with residues I139, I140, F252, G255, F402, W405. QM-MM optimizations indicated that the electrostatic interactions involving halogens contribute to the binding free . Importantly, our results are in good agreement with the recently unraveled cryo-Electron Microscopy structures of LAT1.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658402>GeTFEP: A general transfer free  profile of transmembrane proteins.</a></h1><p>Free  of transferring amino  side-chains from aqueous environment into lipid bilayers, known as transfer free  (TFE), provides important information on the thermodynamic stability of membrane proteins. In this study, we derived a TFE profile named General Transfer Free  Profile (GeTFEP) based on computation of the TFEs of 58 β-barrel membrane proteins (βMPs). The GeTFEP agrees well with experimentally measured and computationally derived TFEs. Analysis based on the GeTFEP shows that residues in different regions of the TM segments of βMPs have different roles during the membrane insertion process. Results further reveal the importance of the sequence pattern of transmembrane strands in stabilizing βMPs in the membrane environment. In addition, we show that GeTFEP can be used to predict the positioning and the orientation of βMPs in the membrane. We also show that GeTFEP can be used to identify structurally or functionally important amino  residue sites of βMPs. Furthermore, the TM segments of α-helical membrane proteins can be accurately predicted with GeTFEP, suggesting that the GeTFEP is of general applicability in studying membrane protein.© 2019 The Protein Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658614>Inducible Cardiac-Specific Deletion of Sirt1 in Male Mice Reveals Progressive Cardiac Dysfunction and Sensitization of the Heart to Pressure Overload.</a></h1><p>Heart failure is associated with profound alterations of  metabolism thought to play a major role in the progression of this syndrome. SIRT1 is a metabolic sensor of cellular  and exerts essential functions on  metabolism, oxidative stress response, apoptosis, or aging. Importantly, SIRT1 deacetylates the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1α (PGC-1α), the master regulator of  metabolism involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty  utilization. However, the exact role of SIRT1 in controlling cardiac  metabolism is still incompletely understood and conflicting results have been obtained. We generated a cardio-specific inducible model of Sirt1 gene deletion in mice () to decipher the role of SIRT1 in control conditions and following cardiac stress induced by pressure overload. SIRT1 deficiency induced a progressive cardiac dysfunction, without overt alteration in mitochondrial content or properties. Sixteen weeks after  deletion an increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and a higher rate of oxidative damage were observed, suggesting disruption of the ROS production/detoxification balance. Following pressure overload, cardiac dysfunction and alteration in mitochondrial properties were exacerbated in  mice. Overall the results demonstrate that SIRT1 plays a cardioprotective role on cardiac  metabolism and thereby on cardiac function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647087>Daily red wine vinegar ingestion for eight weeks improves glucose homeostasis and affects the metabolome but does not reduce adiposity in adults.</a></h1><p>Some studies have reported that vinegar ingestion at mealtime attenuates postprandial glycemia in healthy adults and individuals with type 2 diabetes. Emerging data suggest that chronic vinegar ingestion impacts fat metabolism and reduces adiposity, although no study has yet corroborated the events of vinegar supplementation metabolically through a metabolomics approach. To examine the impact of daily vinegar ingestion on glucose homeostasis, adiposity, and the metabolome, an 8-week, randomized controlled trial design was implemented utilizing two parallel treatment arms: daily red wine vinegar ingestion and a control treatment. Participants were 45 healthy adults at increased risk for metabolic complications as determined by high waist circumferences. Measurements and blood samples were collected pre- and post-intervention. Central adiposity and visceral fat were assessed by waist circumference and dual- X-ray absorptiometry, respectively. Plasma metabolites were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS) and liquid chromatography-MS/MS. Analysis showed significant reductions in fasting glucose (p = 0.003) and insulin (p < 0.001). Insulin resistance was reduced 8.3% in the red wine vinegar group and increased 9.7% in the control group (p < 0.001). No significant between-group differences in body mass index, body weight, waist circumference, or visceral fat were observed. Significant differences were observed in amino valerate and indole-3-acetic  (p < 0.05), with high magnitudes of fold change (>2) between groups. Metabolic pathway analysis revealed significant alterations in tryptophan metabolism. Although daily red wine vinegar ingestion for 8 weeks induced significant improvements in glucose homeostasis, our results indicate that daily red wine vinegar ingestion for 8 weeks is not associated with reductions in adiposity. This is the first study to investigate the effects of daily red wine vinegar supplementation using a metabolomics approach. Our results provide strong rationales for larger prospective studies to further clarify associations among obesity, chronic diseases, and functional foods such as vinegar using metabolomics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663327>Triple-Shelled Co-VSex Hollow Nanocages as Superior Bifunctional Electrode Materials for Efficient Pt-Free Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells and Hydrogen Evolution Reactions.</a></h1><p>Complex nanostructures with distinct spatial architectures and more active sites hold broad prospects in new  conversion fields. Herein, a facile strategy was carried out to construct triple-shelled Co-VSex nanocages, starting via an ion-exchange process about Co-based zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) nanopolyhedrons and VO3-, followed by the formation of triple-shelled Co-VSex hollow nanocages during the process of rising the solvothermal temperature under the assistance of SeO32-. Meanwhile, triple-shelled Co-VSx and yolk-double shell Co-VOx nanocages were fabricated as references by a similar process. Benefiting from the larger surface areas and more electrolyte adsorption sites, the triple-shelled Co-VSex nanocages exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performances when applied as the electrochemical catalysts for dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). More concretely, the DSSC based on Co-VSex counter electrode (CE) showed outstanding power conversion efficiency of 9.68% when Pt counterpart was 8.46%.

The abundance of E. faecalis in the intestine of silkworm is affected by fluoride exposure. However, the response mechanism of E. faecalis toward fluoride remains largely unknown. In this study, a strain of E. faecalis (named TV4), which is a symbiotic bacteria of silkworm, was isolated and characterized. Inhibition assay showed that fluoride could significantly inhibit the growth of the TV4 strain (P<0.05) after culture for 4 h. Finally, Illumina X-Ten platform was used to investigate the response mechanism of E. faecalis TV4 under fluoride exposure. We found that the TV4 strain demonstrated significant changes in its carbohydrate transport and metabolism and  metabolism. The transcriptome sequencing results revealed that 237 genes were differentially expressed for TV4 grown after fluoride exposure, i.e., 92 genes were differentially up-regulated and 145 genes were differentially down-regulated. Many of the down-regulated genes were involved in cell carbohydrate transport and metabolism and  production, whereas the up-regulated genes were mostly related to ethanolamine utilization and amino  synthesis and metabolism. Our results revealed that strain TV4 reduced its carbohydrate metabolism and  metabolism and increased ethanolamine utilization and amino  metabolism to adapt and survive under fluoride exposure. This study enhances our understanding about the response mechanism of E. faecalis after fluoride exposure and has important implications for investigations on the three-way interaction among fluoride, symbiotic bacteria and silkworm.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Due to its robust properties, it is also increasingly considered for use as a cell factory. It produces several industrially important compounds such as 1,3-propanediol and reuterin natively, but for cell factory purposes, developing improved strategies for engineering and fermentation optimization is crucial. Genome-scale metabolic models can be highly beneficial in guiding rational metabolic engineering. Reconstructing a reliable and a quantitatively accurate metabolic model requires extensive manual curation and incorporation of experimental data.A genome-scale metabolic model of L. reuteri JCM 1112 was reconstructed and the resulting model, Lreuteri_530, was validated and tested with experimental data. Several knowledge gaps in the metabolism were identified and resolved during this process, including presence/absence of glycolytic genes. Flux distribution between the two glycolytic pathways, the phosphoketolase and Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathways, varies considerably between LAB species and strains. As these pathways result in different  yields, it is important to include strain-specific utilization of these pathways in the model. We determined experimentally that the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway carried at most 7% of the total glycolytic flux. Predicted growth rates from Lreuteri_530 were in good agreement with experimentally determined values. To further validate the prediction accuracy of Lreuteri_530, the predicted effects of glycerol addition and adhE gene knock-out, which results in impaired ethanol production, were compared to in vivo data. Examination of both growth rates and uptake- and secretion rates of the main metabolites in central metabolism demonstrated that the model was able to accurately predict the experimentally observed effects. Lastly, the potential of L. reuteri as a cell factory was investigated, resulting in a number of general metabolic engineering strategies.We have constructed a manually curated genome-scale metabolic model of L. reuteri JCM 1112 that has been experimentally parameterized and validated and can accurately predict metabolic behavior of this important platform cell factory.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671870>Microbiological Insights into the Stress-Alleviating Property of an Endophytic  WR10 in Wheat under Low-Phosphorus and High-Salinity Stresses.</a></h1><p>An indole-3-acetic  producing  WR10 was previously isolated from the root of wheat (  L.). In this study, the strain WR10 was used for relieving abiotic stresses in wheat under low phosphorus and high saline in hydroponic co-culture models. Significantly, strain WR10 improved wheat seed relative germination rate under salinity stress (200/400 mM NaCl) and the root dry weight in wheat seedlings under phosphorus stress (10 μM KHPO) when insoluble phosphates are available. To provide insights into its abiotic stress-alleviating properties, the strain was characterized further. WR10 grows well under different culture conditions. Particularly, WR10 resists salt (12% NaCl) and hydrolyzes both inorganic and organic insoluble phosphates. WR10 uses many plant-derived substrates as sole carbon and  sources. It produces catalase, amylase, phosphatase, phytase, reductase, and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase. In addition, WR10 possesses long peritrichous flagella, and its biofilm formation, as well as phytase production, is induced by abiotic stresses. Overall, the salinity-alleviating property of WR10 in wheat can be attributed to its inherent tolerance to NaCl, formation of biofilm, and production of enzymes, like catalase, amylase, and ACC deaminase. Meanwhile,  WR10 reduces low-phosphorus stress in wheat by production of phosphatases and phytases in the presence of insoluble phosphates.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640139>Synthesis and Thermophysical Characterization of Fatty Amides for Thermal  Storage.</a></h1><p>Nine monoamides were synthesized from carboxylic  (C8-C18) and crude glycerol.

The natural histological course of untreated BE is non-dysplastic or benign BE (ND) than low-grade (LGD), and high-grade dysplastic (HGD) BE, with the expected increase in malignancy transfer to oesophagal adenocarcinoma (EAC). The gold standard for BE diagnostics involves high-resolution white-light endoscopy, followed by uniform endoscopy findings description (Prague classification) with biopsy performance according to Seattle protocol. The medical treatment of GERD and BE includes the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) regarding symptoms control. It is noteworthy that long-term use of PPIs increases gastrin level, which can contribute to transfer from BE to EAC, as a result of its effects on proliferation of BE epithelium. Endoscopy treatment includes a wide range of resection and ablative techniques, such as radio-frequency ablation (RFA), often concomitantly used in everyday endoscopy practice (multimodal therapy). RFA promotes mucosal necrosis of treated oesophagal region via high-frequency . Laparoscopic surgery, partial or total fundoplication, is reserved for PPIs and endoscopy indolent patients or in those with progressive disease. This review aims to explain distinct effects of PPIs and RFA modalities, illuminate certain aspects of molecular mechanisms involved, as well as the effects of their concomitant use regarding the treatment of BE and prevention of its transfer to EAC.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635821>Humic  promotes arsenopyrite bio-oxidation and arsenic immobilization.</a></h1><p>The bio-oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite, the most severe arsenic contamination source, can be mediated by organic substances, but pertinent studies on this subject are scarce. In this study, the bio-oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite by Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans and arsenic immobilization were evaluated in the presence of humic  (HA). The mineral dissolution was monitored through analyses of the parameters in solution, phase and element speciation transformations on the mineral surface, and arsenic immobilization on the surfaces of cells and jarosites-HA. The results show that the presence of HA enhances the dissolution of arsenopyrite, e.g., 7.1% of arsenopyrite was in the residue after 12 d of bio-oxidation compared to 19.3% in the absence of HA. Meanwhile, the presence of HA led to changes of the fates of As and Fe and no accumulation of elemental sulfur (S) or ferric arsenate on the mineral surface. Moreover, a flocculent porous structure was formed on the surfaces of both microbial cells and jarosites, on which a large amount of arsenic was adsorbed. These results clearly indicate that HA can simultaneously promote the dissolution of arsenopyrite and arsenic immobilization, which may be significant for bioleaching of arsenopyrite-bearing contaminated sites.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, the comparative untargeted metabolomic analysis was performed in this study. The results revealed that glycolysis pathway and tricarboxylic  cycle (TCA) were significantly enhanced in yellowed rice, indicating the activated  metabolism was trigged during the yellowing process. In addition, the increased aromatic compounds (4-hydroxycinnamic  and benzoic ) and their precursors (phenylalanine, tyrosine) suggested the activation of shikimate-phenylpropanoid biosynthesis in yellowed rice, which is an antioxidant defense related pathway. In particular, the pathways involved in the metabolism of glutamate and arginine also significantly altered in yellowed rice. Therefore, the enriched pathways of increased amino , sugars, sugar alcohols, and intermediates of the TCA cycle during yellowing process are proposed to be associated with the response of heat and dry induced by the yellowing process.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Deletion of both NDH-2 encoding genes (Δndh-2 mutant) reveals that the essentiality of NDH-2 as shown in standard growth media is due to the presence of fatty . The Δndh-2 mutant is only mildly attenuated in mice and not differently susceptible to clofazimine, a drug in clinical use proposed to engage NDH-2.

However, the occurrence and concentrations of a large number of cytostatics in waters and wastewaters are unknown. Thus, this study sought to analyze the concentrations of these compounds in different aquatic environments worldwide to assess the risk that these compounds pose to aquatic organisms. The top five most monitored cytostatics in aquatic environments are fluorouracil, methotrexate, tamoxifen, ifosfamide, and cyclophosphamide. Risk quotients (RQs) based on maximum reported measured concentrations revealed that mycophenolic  and tamoxifen pose a high risk to aquatic organisms (RQ ≥ 1) at concentrations observed in surface waters. Moreover, methotrexate and tegafur were categorized as moderate risk compounds, and bicalutamide was found to pose a low risk. Importantly, the available analytical methodologies for the quantification of some cytostatics (e.g., cisplatin, fluorouracil, daunorubicin, imatinib, and mycophenolic ) in water could not rule out potential risk to aquatic biota, since estimated risks for these compounds using the lowest method detection limits reported in the literature (RQ MDL) were all ≥0.01 (i.e., low risk or higher). Moreover, risks based on predicted concentrations (RQ PEC) were consistently lower than those based on measured concentrations, highlighting the importance of risk assessment based on measured values. Thus, accurate and sensitive analytical methods are crucial to identify and quantify cytostatic exposure in aquatic ecosystems in order to preserve biodiversity and ensure a safer environment.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The basic idea of the DLAAM is that the unknown C recovery RF(C) of the 1-C amino , essential for the calculation of the net CO production, can be approximated by the easily measureable N recovery RF(N) of the α-NH labelled amino . In four healthy adult men (76-97 kg) the DLAAM was tested parallel to the IC and in one man (74 kg) parallel to the DLWM. Using the approximation RF(C) ≈ RF(N) the RCO (in l CO d) was calculated to 387.0 ± 30.3 (DLAAM) vs. 382.8 ± 22.6. (IC). The Bland-Altman plot shows that the difference between the DLAAM and IC of individual RCO is within the 95 % confidence interval (mean ± 2 SD): +4.3 ± 37.5 l CO d. We conclude that the DLAAM and IC may be used interchangeably. The physical activity level (PAL) was calculated based on the DLAAM vs. DLWM to about 1.5.

The Graphene Oxide (GO) films are deposited on substrates and patterned using plasma-enhanced liftoff techniques. The substrate is initially treated with oxygen plasma to increase surface  and enhance wettability thus increasing the bond between the GO flakes and the substrate. The GO film is then deposited on the substrate from a GO aqueous solution via a spin coating approach. Photolithography is then used to pattern the GO film. Finally, the GO film is chemically reduced to rGO using hydroiodic . The fabrication method is found to be very compatible with polymer substrates. In addition, the developed patterned rGO electrodes are employed in manipulating living cells in a microfluidic device using dielectrophoresis.© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649131>EVI1 triggers metabolic reprogramming associated with leukemogenesis and increases sensitivity to L-asparaginase.</a></h1><p>Metabolic reprogramming of leukemia cells is important for survival, proliferation, and drug resistance under conditions of metabolic stress in the bone marrow. Deregulation of cellular metabolism, leading to development of leukemia, occurs through abnormally high expression of transcription factors such as MYC and Ecotropic Virus Integration site 1 protein homolog (EVI1). Overexpression of EVI1 in adults and children with mixed lineage leukemia-rearrangement acute myeloid leukemia (MLL-r AML) has a very poor prognosis. To identify a metabolic inhibitor for EVI1-induced metabolic reprogramming in MLL-r AML, we used an XFp extracellular flux analyzer to examine metabolic changes during leukemia development in mouse models of AML expressing MLL-AF9 and Evi1 (Evi1/MF9). Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in Evi1/MF9 AML cells accelerated prior to activation of glycolysis, with a higher dependency on glutamine as an  source. Furthermore, EVI1 played a role in glycolysis as well as driving production of metabolites in the tricarboxylic  cycle. L-asparaginase (L-asp) exacerbated growth inhibition induced by glutamine starvation and suppressed OXPHOS and proliferation of Evi1/MF9 both in vitro and in vivo; high sensitivity to L-asp was caused by low expression of asparagine synthetase (ASNS) and L-asp-induced suppression of glutamine metabolism. Also, samples from patients with EVI1+MF9 showed low ASNS expression, suggesting that it is a sensitive marker of L-asp treatment. Clarification of metabolic reprogramming in EVI1+ leukemia cells may aid development of treatments for EVI1+MF9 refractory leukemia.Copyright © 2019, Ferrata Storti Foundation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675623>A DFT study on reaction force approach of ammonia catalysed amide bond formation reaction between ammonia and formic .</a></h1><p>A reaction force approach of ammonia catalysed stepwise amide bond formation between ammonia and formic  is investigated using B3LYP/6-31G (d,p) level of density functional theory in gas phase. The stepwise amide bond formation mechanism involves two transition states, namely, TS1, in initial stage and TS2, in final stage of reaction pathway. The potential  surfaces obtained from IRC calculations on transition state geometries are subjected to reaction force and reaction work calculations. The estimated reaction works of structural and electronic activities in the progress of reaction reflect the unfavorable formation of diol intermediate and preferential formation of formamide. While 91% of the activation  comes from structural changes in preparative region of TS1 path, the structural and electronic rearrangements respectively, share 57.6% and 42.4% of total activation  of TS2 pathway. The atomic resolution of IRC pathways and natural charge analysis reveal the importance of hydrogen atom of catalyst in TS1 path and the oxygen of water molecule in TS2 path in the progress of reaction.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Despite the critical role of the taste system in determining food selection and consumption, the effects of chronic sucrose consumption on the peripheral taste system in mammals have received limited attention. We offered female Sprague Dawley rats free access to water and one of three diets for up to 40 days: (1) sucrose-free chow or "NS" diet; (2) a high-sucrose dry diet or "HS"; or (3) 30% sucrose solution and the NS diet, designated "LiqS" diet. Sucrose consumption by LiqS rats gradually increased and by day 14 was equal to that of HS rats. Food intake decreased in LiqS rats, but their  intake remained higher than for NS or HS rats. There was no significant difference in weight gain of the groups during the study. Recordings from the chorda tympani nerve (CT), which innervates taste buds on the anterior tongue, revealed decreased responses to 1 M sucrose in both LiqS and HS rats and to acesulfame K and salt tastants in LiqS rats after 40 days on diet. Umami, bitter, and  response magnitudes were unchanged in both groups. These results demonstrate that chronic sucrose exposure inhibits taste responses to higher concentrations of sweet stimuli. More surprisingly, CT responses to NaCl and 0.5M NaAc were significantly reduced in rats on the LiqS diet. Thus, the physical form of the diet influences taste responsiveness to salt and sweet taste function. These data suggest that taste buds are previously unappreciated targets of chronic sucrose consumption.Copyright © 2019.

However, it is extremely challenging to increase membrane water flux and simultaneously achieve high rejection rates of cations or organic dyes. Herein, we report a tannic  (TA) assisted exfoliation method to fabricate TA-modified MoS (TAMoS) nanosheets with high production yield (90 ± 5%). The TAMoS nanosheets membranes show excellent non-swelling stability in water. It is found that a hybrid membrane with 1 wt% of TAMoS in MoS nanosheets demonstrates overall better performance than pure MoS and TAMoS membrane. Such a hybrid membrane with a thickness of 5 µm shows fast water flux at around 32 L m h (LMH) and >97% rejection of various cations under static diffusion mode. Under vacuum-driven filtration condition, the as-prepared hybrid membrane demonstrates ultrafast water flux of 15,000 ± 100 L/(m h bar) and 99.87 ± 0.1% rejection of multiple model organic dyes. To the best of our knowledge, the above performances are superior to those of all MoS-based membranes reported previously in terms of water flux and ion/dye rejection. This work represents a leap forward towards the practical applications of 2D TAMoS membranes in various engineering and environmental areas.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Optimal process conditions for dicarboxylic- yield and recovery include slow growth, low pH and high CO . To quantify and understand how these process parameters affect yeast physiology, this study investigates individual and combined impacts of low pH (3.0) and high CO (50 %) on slow-growing chemostat and retentostat cultures of the reference strain S. cerevisiae CEN.PK113-7D. Combined exposure to low pH and high CO led to increased maintenance- requirements and death rates in aerobic, glucose-limited cultures. Further experiments showed that these effects were predominantly caused by low pH. Growth under ammonium-limited, -excess conditions did not aggravate or ameliorate these adverse impacts. Despite the absence of a synergistic effect of low pH and high CO on physiology, high CO strongly affected genome-wide transcriptional responses to low pH. Interference of high CO with low-pH signaling is consistent with low-pH and high-CO signals being relayed via common (MAPK-)signaling pathways, notably the cell wall integrity (CWI), high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) and calcineurin pathways. This study highlights the need to further increase robustness of cell factories to low pH for carboxylic- production, even in organisms that are already applied at industrial scale.

The molecular systems have potential applications as sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells. Three molecules were taken from the literature, and seven are proposals inspired in the above, including the azomethine group in the π-bridge expecting a better charge transfer. These molecular structures are composed of triphenylamine (donor part); different combinations of azomethine, thiophene, and benzene derivatives (π-bridge); and cyanoacrylic  (acceptor part). This study focused on the effect that the azomethine group caused on the π-bridge. Ground-state geometry optimization, the highest occupied molecular orbital, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, and their  levels were obtained and analyzed. Absorption wavelengths, oscillator strengths, and electron transitions were obtained via time-dependent density functional theory using the M06-2X density functional and the 6-31G(d) basis set. The free  of electron injection (ΔG) was calculated and analyzed. As an important part of this study, chemical reactivity parameters are discussed, such as chemical hardness, electrodonating power, electroaccepting power, and electrophilicity index. In conclusion, the inclusion of azomethine in the π-bridge improved the charge transfer and the electronic properties of triphenylamine-based dyes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661440>Modelling gas-liquid mass transfer in wastewater treatment: when current knowledge needs to encounter engineering practice and vice versa.</a></h1><p>Gas-liquid mass transfer in wastewater treatment processes has received considerable attention over the last decades from both academia and industry. Indeed, improvements in modelling gas-liquid mass transfer can bring huge benefits in terms of reaction rates, plant  expenditure, -base equilibria and greenhouse gas emissions. Despite these efforts, there is still no universally valid correlation between the design and operating parameters of a wastewater treatment plant and the gas-liquid mass transfer coefficients. That is why the current practice for oxygen mass transfer modelling is to apply overly simplified models, which come with multiple assumptions that are not valid for most applications. To deal with these complexities, correction factors were introduced over time. The most uncertain of them is the α-factor. To build fundamental gas-liquid mass transfer knowledge more advanced modelling paradigms have been applied more recently. Yet these come with a high level of complexity making them impractical for rapid process design and optimisation in an industrial setting. However, the knowledge gained from these more advanced models can help in improving the way the α-factor and thus gas-liquid mass transfer coefficient should be applied. That is why the presented work aims at clarifying the current state-of-the-art in gas-liquid mass transfer modelling of oxygen and other gases, but also to direct academic research efforts towards the needs of the industrial practitioners.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655646>A novel electrochemiluminescence sensor based on resonance  transfer system between nitrogen doped graphene quantum dots and boron nitride quantum dots for sensitive detection of folic .</a></h1><p>Electrochemiluminescence resonance  transfer (ECL-RET) between quantum dots (QDs) was firstly proposed. In this work, boron nitride quantum dots (BNQDs) as the donor and nitrogen doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs) as the acceptor were confirmed by the absorption spectrum, the emission spectrum and fluorescence spectrum. Based on the reaction between FA and the SO in the ECL system of NGQDs/BNQDs/KSO, the ECL sensing platform for FA was successfully constructed. Surprisingly, a stable and strong ECL signal was obtained based on the RET, which was used for signal-off detection of FA in the presence of coreactant KSO. Notably, about 10-fold enhancement was observed compared with the absence of BNQDs. The proposed sensor showed wide linear ranges of 1.0 × 10 M to 1.0 × 10 M and a low detection limit of 5.13 × 10 M. Simultaneously, the sensor was successfully applied to detection of FA in human serum samples with excellent recoveries. Therefore, the NGQDs/BNQDs system provided a new perspective for development of novel ECL-RET sensors.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Chemical model systems with different amino  precursors (proline, phenylalanine, and glycine) were examined at different times (4, 8, 12, and 16 min) and temperatures (150, 180, 210, 240, and 270 °C). PhIP was detected using high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with fluorescence detector (HPLC-FLD). The good fit in first-order suggested that PhIP formation was influenced by the types of amino  and PhIP concentration significantly increased with time and temperature (up to 240 °C). PhIP was detected in proline and phenylalanine model systems but not in the glycine model system. The phenylalanine model system demonstrated low activation  (Ea) of 95.36 kJ/mol that resulted in a high rate of PhIP formation (great amount of PhIP formed). Based on the ∆S values both proline and phenylalanine demonstrated bimolecular rate-limiting steps for PhIP formation. Altogether these kinetic results could provide valuable information in predicting the PhIP formation pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659726>Growth and Nutrition in Cystic Fibrosis.</a></h1><p>Optimal nutrition support has been integral in the management of cystic fibrosis (CF) since the disease was initially described. Nutritional status has a clear relationship with disease outcomes, and malnutrition in CF is typically a result of chronic negative  balance secondary to malabsorption. As the mechanisms underlying the pathology of CF and its implications on nutrient absorption and  expenditure have been elucidated, nutrition support has become increasingly sophisticated. Comprehensive nutrition monitoring and treatment guidelines from professional and advocacy organizations have unified the approach to nutrition optimization around the world. Newborn screening allows for early nutrition intervention and improvement in short- and long-term growth and other clinical outcomes. The nutrition support goal in CF care includes achieving optimal nutritional status to support growth and pubertal development in children, maintenance of optimal nutritional status in adult life, and optimizing fat soluble vitamin and essential fatty  status. The mainstay of this approach is a high calorie, high-fat diet, exceeding age, and sex  intake recommendations for healthy individuals. For patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, enzyme replacement therapy is required to improve fat and calorie absorption. Enzyme dosing varies by age and dietary fat intake. Multiple potential impediments to absorption, including decreased motility, altered gut luminal bile salt and microbiota composition, and enteric inflammation must be considered. Fat soluble vitamin supplementation is required in patients with pancreatic insufficiency. In this report, nutrition support across the age and disease spectrum is discussed, with a focus on the relationships among nutritional status, growth, and disease outcomes.Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645469>Serum elaidic  concentration and risk of dementia: The Hisayama study.</a></h1><p>The associations between trans fatty  and dementia have been unclear. We investigated the prospective association between serum elaidic  (trans 18:1 n-9) levels, as an objective biomarker for industrial trans fat, and incident dementia and its subtypes.In total, 1,628 Japanese community residents aged 60 and older without dementia were followed prospectively from when they underwent a screening examination in 2002-2003 to November 2012 (median 10.3 years, interquartile range 7.2-10.4 years). Serum elaidic  levels were measured using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and divided into quartiles. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratios for all-cause dementia, Alzheimer disease (AD), and vascular dementia by serum elaidic  levels.During the follow-up, 377 participants developed some type of dementia (247 AD, 102 vascular dementia). Higher serum elaidic  levels were significantly associated with greater risk of developing all-cause dementia ( for trend = 0.003) and AD ( for trend = 0.02) after adjustment for traditional risk factors. These associations remained significant after adjustment for dietary factors, including total  intake and intakes of saturated and polyunsaturated fatty  (both  for trend <0.05). No significant associations were found between serum elaidic  levels and vascular dementia.The findings suggest that higher serum elaidic  is a possible risk factor for the development of all-cause dementia and AD in later life.

FXR plays critical roles in other lipid metabolic pathways, including fat oxidation; however, little is known about cafestol's effects on fatty  metabolism. Thus, the goal was to investigate cafestol's effects on fatty  metabolism using Caenorhabditis elegans. Cafestol at 60 µM reduced fat accumulation and increased locomotor activity (an indicator of  expenditure) by 20% and 38%, respectively, compared to the control. Cafestol's effects were dependent on daf-12 (a functional homolog of the human FXR) with upregulation of ech-1.1 (a homolog of enoyl-CoA hydratase involved in fatty  β-oxidation) and tub-1 (an ortholog of the human TUBBY involved in the neurological regulation of  expenditure) without any effects on lipogenesis, lipolysis or lipid uptake and transport. Therefore, cafestol increased fat oxidation and  expenditure via DAF-12-dependent pathway in C. elegans.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this work is to investigate the protective effects of Mentha spicata extract (ME) supplementation on the testis and brain of nicotine-induced oxidative damage rats. ME extract showed interesting hydrogen peroxide-scavenging activity. HPLC-DAD analysis of ME revealed the presence of nine compounds among them gallic  was the major one (165.44 µg/g ME). Thirty-two rats were randomly divided into four groups: control, a nicotine-treated group (1 mg/kg i.p.), a group receiving ME (100 mg/kg), and a group receiving both ME (100 mg/kg) and nicotine (1 mg/kg). After 2 months of treatment, the in vivo results showed that nicotine exhibited an increase in the body, brain, testis and accessory sex organ weights, sperm count and sperm motility. In addition, exposure to nicotine significantly (p < 0.01) increased acetylcholinesterase level (AChE) in brain, lipid peroxidation level in brain and testis as compared to control group. The antioxidant enzymes results showed that nicotine treatment induced a significant decrease (p < 0.01) in brain and testis antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase as compared to control group. Interestingly, pretreatment with ME significantly (p < 0.01) restored the majority of these biological parameters to normal levels, as well as a histological improvement. Obtained results suggest that ME contains promising substances that counteract the nicotine-intoxication and can be efficient in the prevention of brain and testis toxicity complications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636691>Flaxseed oil ameliorated high-fat-diet-induced bone loss in rats by promoting osteoblastic function in rat primary osteoblasts.</a></h1><p>α-Linolenic  (ALA) is a plant-derived omega-3 unsaturated fatty  that is rich in flaxseed oil (FO). The effect of FO on bone health is controversial. This study aims to evaluate the effect of FO on bone damage induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) and to explore the possible mechanism.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a normal control diet (NC, 10% fat), FO diet (NY, 10% fat), HFD (60% fat), or HFD containing 10% FO (HY, 60% fat) for 22 weeks. Micro CT and three-point bending tests were conducted to evaluate bone microstructure and biomechanics. Serum was collected for the detection of ALP, P1NP, and CTX-1. Rat primary osteoblasts (OBs) were treated with different concentrations of ALA with or without palmitic  (PA) treatment. The ALP activity, osteogenic-related gene and protein expression were measured.Rats in the HFD group displayed decreased biomechanical properties, such as maximum load, maximum fracture load, ultimate tensile strength, stiffness,  absorption, and elastic modulus, compared with the NC group (   < 0.05). However, HY attenuated the HFD-induced decreases in bone biomechanical properties, including maximum load, maximum fracture load, and ultimate tensile strength ( < 0.05). Trabecular bone markers such as trabecular volume bone mineral density (Tb. vBMD trabecular bone volume/total volume (Tb. BV/TV), trabecular number (Tb. N), trabecular thickness (Tb. Th) were decreased, trabecular separation (Tb. Sp) and the structure model index (SMI) were increased in the HFD group compared with the NC group, and all parameters were remarkably improved in the HY group compared to the HFD group (p < 0.05). However, cortical bone markers such as cortical volume bone mineral density (Ct. vBMD), cortical bone volume/total volume (Ct. BV/TV) and cortical bone thickness (Ct. Th) were not significantly different among all groups. Moreover, the serum bone formation markers ALP and P1NP were higher and the bone resorption marker CTX-1 was lower in the HY group compared with levels in the HFD group. Compared with the NC group, the NY group had no difference in the above indicators. In rat primary OBs, PA treatment significantly decreased ALP activity and osteogenic gene and protein (β-catenin, RUNX2, and osterix) expression, and ALA dose-dependently restored the inhibition induced by PA.FO might be a potential therapeutic agent for HFD-induced bone loss, most likely by promoting osteogenesis.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667409>Optimization of the antioxidant-rich xanthone extract from mangosteen (.) pericarp via microwave-assisted extraction.</a></h1><p>Total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant properties of xanthone extract from mangosteen pericarp via microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) method was optimized by response surface methodology (RSM). The MAE extraction conditions to obtain optimum antioxidant-rich xanthone extract were at 2.24 min of irradiation time, 25 mL/g of solvent-to-solid ratio and 71% of ethanol concentration.

The forelimb grip strength and exhaustive weight-loaded swimming time of the QH-6X group were significantly higher than those of the other groups. QH supplementation dose-dependently reduced serum lactate, ammonia, and CK levels and increased the FFA concentration after acute exercise. In addition, QH increased the liver and muscle glycogen content, an important  source during exercise. Therefore, the results suggest that QH formulation is a safe dietary supplement for amelioration of fatigue and for promoting exercise performance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656947>Branched chain amino  impact health and lifespan indirectly via amino  balance and appetite control.</a></h1><p>Elevated branched chain amino  (BCAAs) are associated with obesity and insulin resistance. How long-term dietary BCAAs impact late-life health and lifespan is unknown. Here, we show that when dietary BCAAs are varied against a fixed, isocaloric macronutrient background, long-term exposure to high BCAA diets leads to hyperphagia, obesity and reduced lifespan. These effects are not due to elevated BCAA  or hepatic mTOR activation, but rather due to a shift in the relative quantity of dietary BCAAs and other AAs, notably tryptophan and threonine. Increasing the ratio of BCAAs to these AAs resulted in hyperphagia and is associated with central serotonin depletion. Preventing hyperphagia by calorie restriction or pair-feeding averts the health costs of a high BCAA diet. Our data highlight a role for amino  quality in  balance and show that health costs of chronic high BCAA intakes need not be due to intrinsic toxicity but, rather, a consequence of hyperphagia driven by AA imbalance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663724>Lithium-Templated Formation of Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsesquioxanes (POSS).</a></h1><p>A coordination complex, lithium hepta(-butyl)silsesquioxane trisilanolate (; Li-T), a stable intermediate in silsesquioxane (SQ) syntheses, was successfully isolated in 65% yield and found to be highly soluble in nonpolar solvents such as hexane. The structure of Li-T was confirmed by NMR, IR spectroscopy, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, and computational simulation, providing detailed elucidation of the intermolecular self-association of the SQ cage with a box-shaped LiO polyhedron through strong coordination bonds. After  treatment, Li-T undergoes lithium-proton cationic exchange, yielding hepta(-butyl)silsesquioxane trisilanol (; H-T) quantitatively. The high yield of H-T seems to be influenced by Li-O bonding in the Li-T complex that affects the selective formation of hepta(-butyl)silsesquioxane trisilanolate and the bulky -butyl groups which may prevent decomposition or SQ cage-rearrangement even at reflux under alkaline conditions. Single-crystal X-ray crystallography confirms the presence of the dumbbell-shaped SQ partial cages through strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Interestingly, lowering the polarity of the reaction solution by adding dichloromethane results in formation of the cubic octa(-butyl)silsesquioxane (; T) cage in a good yield (47%), which is isolated by crystallization from the reaction solution.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665369>Voluntary folic  fortification levels of food staples in Ireland continue to decline: further implications for passive folic  intakes?</a></h1><p>Ireland previously had widespread voluntary fortification but research at Dublin City University carried out in 2014 by our research group demonstrated a major decline in the number of food staples fortified with folic  in Irish supermarkets over the previous 10 years. The aim of the study was to repeat the audit conducted 3 years ago to compare the levels of folic  fortification of foodstuffs over this time-frame.Over a period of 8-weeks between June and August 2017, the nutrition labels of all foodstuffs that might typically be fortified with micronutrients for sale in the supermarkets with the majority of market share in Ireland were examined. The amount of added folic  detailed on the label was compared with those captured in 2014.In total, 1081 products with added micronutrients were examined. In percentage terms, there has been a decline of Folic  (FA) fortified products within the food groups-spreads, breads, cereals, cereal snacks, milks, fruit juices, yogurts/yogurt drinks and  drinks since 2014.The number of food staples fortified with FA continues to decline demonstrating that voluntary fortification in Ireland is no longer an effective measure for passively augmenting the folic  levels of consumers.© The Author(s) 2019.

A few studies have examined the effects of TeaCrine® on cognitive perception, but no research exists examining its effects on resistance exercise performance. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of TeaCrine®, a caffeine-like compound, on maximal muscular strength, endurance, and power performance in resistance-trained men.Twelve resistance-trained men participated in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over designed study. Each participant performed one-repetition maximum (1RM) bench press, 1RM squat, bench press repetitions to failure (RTF) at 70% 1RM, squat RTF at 70% 1RM, and 2-km rowing time trial 90 min after consumption of: (1) Caffeine 300 mg (CAFF300); (2) TeaCrine® 300 mg (TEA300); (3) TeaCrine® + Caffeine (COMBO; 150 mg/150 mg); (4) Placebo 300 mg (PLA). Power and velocity were measured using a TENDO Power Analyzer. Visual analogue scales for , focus, motivation to exercise, and fatigue were administered at baseline and 90 min post-treatment ingestion (pre-workout). Rating of perceived exertion was assessed after bench press RTF and squat RTF.There were no differences between groups for 1RM, RTF, and power in the bench press and squat exercises.

This study investigated the potential of Serratia sp. K3 (K3) assisted with straw biogas residue (SBR) or leavening fertilizer (LF) on improving the Cd migration efficiency and micro-environment in soil-vetiveria zizanioides L. system. The results showed that the  soluble Cd in soil was increased by 2.83-29.79% in treatments compared with control (CK). In addition, Cd accumulation in the roots and shoots of vetiveria zizanioides were significantly enhanced by the combination of K3 and SBR/LF. Especially, the translocation factor of Cd increased by 21.53-62.37% in groups with K3 compared with the groups without K3, correspondingly. Furthermore, SBR/LF effectively changed bacterial community structure, and improved bacterial abundance. Relative abundance of functional genes related with carbohydrate//amino  metabolism were increased in groups of SBRB/LFB rhizosphere compared with CK. These results provide insight into the change of phytoremediation efficiency and soil bacterial communities in the vetiveria zizanioides rhizosphere after inoculation.

New data are necessary to understand the key factors involved in the immune system regulation. Six dairy cows were sampled during transition period to investigate the leukocyte transcriptome changes and its relationship with blood biomarkers. Blood samples were collected at - 20 ± 2, - 3 ± 1, 3, and 7 days from parturition (DFP). Leukocyte transcriptome was analyzed by deep sequencing technology (Hiseq1000 Illumina, USA). Plasma was analyzed for metabolic biomarkers. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) were used to run an enrichment analysis through the Dynamic Impact Approach (DIA). Considering - 20 DFP as references time, the main KEGG impacted pathways were activated before calving (- 3 DFP) and were connected to lipid metabolism, lipid transport in plasma, and phagosome. The greatest differences were found after parturition with 281 DEG (179 upregulated and 102 downregulated). The activated pathways were mainly related to immunity and endocrine aspects, while metabolic pathways related to lipid and amino  metabolism were inhibited. Plasma BHBA had a substantial inhibitory impact on KEGG pathways related to DNA replication and cell cycle, while plasma IL-1β had an inhibitory impact on fatty  elongation in mitochondria and an activated impact in several pathways related to cellular  metabolism. Overall, this study confirmed that many changes in lipid metabolism and immune competence of the circulating leukocytes occurred in dairy cow around calving.

Recent evidences seem to link vitamin D deficiency to fatigue. The aim of this study was to assess and compare vitamin D status in a cohort of older subjects with and without fatigue. We recruited a total of 480 subjects, 240 patients with fatigue and 240 controls without fatigue, from the Cannizzaro Hospital of Catania (Italy). Fatigue severity was measured by the fatigue severity scale, whereas mental and physical fatigue were measured through the Wessely and Powell fatigue scale, respectively. We also measured several blood parameters and 25-OH vitamin D. Subjects with fatigue showed lower levels of vitamin D as compared with those without fatigue. Blood levels of parameters related to fatigue were normal in both groups of subjects, however, platelet, hemoglobin, hematocrit ( < 0.05), mean corpuscular volume, C-reactive protein (CRP), iron, vitamin B12, and folic  ( < 0.001) were significantly higher in the fatigue group with respect to the control group. Moreover, compared to controls, patients showed higher scores in the physical ( < 0.001), mental ( < 0.001), and severity ( < 0.001) fatigue scales. Finally, vitamin D inversely correlated with fatigue severity ( = -0.428,  < 0.01), whereas creatine kinase and CRP levels did not correlate with vitamin D. In conclusion, our data showed a direct link between vitamin D and fatigue in older subjects, suggesting translational implications in the diagnosis and management of these patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646413>Synthesis and Crystallographic, Absorption and Emission Studies of 4-Pyridine Carboxamide of Zn(II) 4-Chlorophenylacetate.</a></h1><p>A new zinc(II) complex, [Zn(CB)(INA)] (where CB is 4-chlorophenylacetate and INA is 4-pyridine carboxamide) was synthesized. The structure of the complex was characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR spectroscopy and single-crystal X-ray diffraction technique. Besides, the thermal stability of the complex was investigated by TGA/DTA analysis method. Moreover, the optical absorption and the emission features of the complex were examined by using UV-Vis and fluorescence spectrophotometers, respectively. Furthermore, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to support the experimental results. Accordingly, it was determined that the complex crystallized in a monoclinic system with space group Pc, a = 8.3329 (2) Å, b = 25.6530 (4) Å, c = 13.5048 (3) Å, α = 90°, β = 91.703 (3)° and γ = 90°. The complex consists two crystallographically independent molecules. In each molecule, the Zn ion adopts a distorted trigonal pyramidal coordination formed by two O atoms from the two 4 chlorophenylacetate ligand and two N atoms of the two 4-pyridine carboxamide ligands. It was observed that the linear absorption spectra of the complex were similar to linear absorption spectra of the semiconductors. In addition, two emission peaks were observed in the fluorescence spectra which could be due to the formation of excimer and the interactions of the benzene and pyridine rings. The  gap (ΔE = E - E) of the complex has been calculated as 3.712 eV and this value is very close to the experimentally measured value (3.86 eV). Therefore, because of higher fluorescence intensity of emission peak that was observed between 309 and 556 nm wavelength besides other traits, the complex could potentially be used in the blue light OLED application by filtering of the emission peak around 710 nm wavelength.

Both intentional design and environmental or biological processes induce many nanoholes in SLMoS. However, the effects of nanoholes on the environmental stability and ecotoxicity of SLMoS remain largely unknown. The present work discovered that visible-light irradiation induced nanoholes (diameters, approximately 20 nm) in the plane of SLMoS, with irregular edges and increased interplanar crystal spacing. The ratios of Mo to S in pristine and transformed SLMoS were 0.53 and 0.33, respectively. After 96 h exposure at concentrations from 0.1-1 mg/L, the above nanoholes promoted algal division, induced a stress-response hormesis, decreased the generation of •OH and mitigated the cell shrinkage and wall rupture of Chlorella vulgaris induced by SLMoS. In terms of stress response, the nanohole-bearing SLMoS induced fewer vacuoles and polyphosphate bodies of Chlorella vulgaris than the pristine form. Metabolomic analysis revealed that nanoholes perturbed the metabolisms of , carbohydrates and fatty . This work proposes that nanoholes cause obvious effects on the environmental fate and ecotoxicity of SLMoS and that the environmental risks of engineered nanomaterials should be reevaluated using nanohole-bearing rather than pristine forms for testing.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671233>Effects of acute heat stress on intestinal microbiota in grow-finishing pigs, and associations with feed intake and serum profile.</a></h1><p>This study was conducted to assess the effects of acute heat stress (HS) on intestinal microbiota, and the associations with the changes in feed intake (FI) and serum profile.Twenty four individually housed pigs (Duroc × Large White × Landrace, 30 ± 1 kg body weight) were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 treatments (8 pigs / treatment): 1) thermal neutral (TN) conditions (25 ± 1°C), 2) HS conditions (35 ± 1°C), 3) pair-feeding (PF) with HS under TN conditions. After 24-h treatment, pigs were monitored to assess feed intake (FI), and samples of serum and feces were collected to investigate serum profile, microbial composition, and short chain fatty  (SCFAs). The results showed that HS decreased (P < 0.05) FI compared with the TN group. Compared with TN group, HS changed serum profile by affecting biochemical parameters and hormones related with  metabolism and stress response; immune indicators were also altered in HS group. Most of changes in serum profile were independent of FI reduction. Additionally, HS shifted the diversity and composition of fecal microbial community by increasing (P < 0.05) Proteobacteria and decreasing (P < 0.05) Bacteroidetes. Moreover, HS decreased (P < 0.05) the concentrations of propionate, butyrate, valerate, iso-valerate, and total SCFAs in feces with a FI-independent manner. Furthermore, the Spearman correlation analysis implied that changes of serum profile have potential correlation with alterations of fecal microbiota and their metabolites SCFAs in acute HS-treated grow-finishing pigs.Metabolism disorders caused by 24-h acute HS associated with changes of fecal microbiota and their metabolites SCFAs with a FI-independent manner in grow-finishing pigs.These results give us a new insight of the intestinal damage caused by acute HS and the underlying mechanisms.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665044>Role of mitochondria and cardiolipins in growth inhibition of breast cancer cells by retinoic .</a></h1><p>All-trans-retinoic- (ATRA) is a promising agent in the prevention/treatment of breast-cancer. There is growing evidence that reprogramming of cellular lipid metabolism contributes to malignant transformation and progression. Lipid metabolism is implicated in cell differentiation and metastatic colonization and it is involved in the mechanisms of sensitivity/resistance to different anti-tumor agents. The role played by lipids in the anti-tumor activity of ATRA has never been studied.We used 16 breast cancer cell-lines whose degree of sensitivity to the anti-proliferative action of ATRA is known. We implemented a non-oriented mass-spectrometry based approach to define the lipidomic profiles of each cell-line grown under basal conditions and following treatment with ATRA. To complement the lipidomic data, untreated and retinoid treated cell-lines were also subjected to RNA-sequencing to define the perturbations afforded by ATRA on the whole-genome gene-expression profiles. The number and functional activity of mitochondria were determined in selected ATRA-sensitive and -resistant cell-lines. Bio-computing approaches were used to analyse the high-throughput lipidomic and transcriptomic data.ATRA perturbs the homeostasis of numerous lipids and the most relevant effects are observed on cardiolipins, which are located in the mitochondrial inner membranes and play a role in oxidative-phosphorylation. ATRA reduces the amounts of cardiolipins and the effect is associated with the growth-inhibitory activity of the retinoid. Down-regulation of cardiolipins is due to a reduction of mitochondria, which is caused by an ATRA-dependent decrease in the expression of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. This demonstrates that ATRA anti-tumor activity is due to a decrease in the amounts of mitochondria causing deficits in the respiration/-balance of breast-cancer cells.The observation that ATRA anti-proliferative activity is caused by a reduction in the respiration and  balance of the tumor cells has important ramifications for the therapeutic action of ATRA in breast cancer. The study may open the way to the development of rational therapeutic combinations based on the use of ATRA and anti-tumor agents targeting the mitochondria.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675519>Ensiling characteristics, physicochemical structure and enzymatic hydrolysis of steam-exploded hippophae: Effects of calcium oxide, cellulase and Tween.</a></h1><p>To find a comprehensive way to enhance the utilizability of steam-exploded hippophae, calcium oxide (CaO) preimpregnation, cellulase-added storage and saccharification with addition of Tween 20 were investigated in this study. Both CaO preimpregnation and cellulase addition promoted the ensiling fermentation of anaerobically stored steam-exploded hippophae indicated by lower cellulose proportion and higher organic  content, but led to the decrease of saccharification yield by 11.83% and 46.77-51.22%, respectively. When taking into account of organic  being utilizable  source, storing with addition of cellulase enhanced the utilizability of the materials in whole. Moreover, the addition of Tween 20 enhanced saccharification yield of the steam-exploded hippophae by 26.69-45.25%. Additionally, FTIR and XRD spectra clearly illustrated the structural alteration during storage. It is concluded that storing with addition of cellulase and hydrolyzing with addition of Tween 20 can enhance the utilizability of steam-exploded hippophae.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

As the thermal sensitivity of bioenergetic pathways depends on the structural and kinetic properties of its component enzymes, optimization of their  function to different thermal niches is expected to have occurred through selection. In the present study, we sought to characterize mitochondrial phenotypic adjustments to thermal niches in eight ray-finned fish species occupying a wide range of thermal habitats by comparing the activities of key mitochondrial enzymes in their hearts. We measured the activity of four enzymes that control substrate entrance into the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle: pyruvate kinase (PK), pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc), carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT), and hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HOAD). We also assayed enzymes of the electron transport system (ETS): complexes I, II, I + III, and IV. Enzymes were assayed at five temperatures (5, 10, 15, 20, and 25°C). Our results showed that the activity of CPT, a gatekeeper of the fatty  pathway, was higher in the cold-water fish than in the warmer-adapted fish relative to the ETS (complexes I and III) when measured close to the species optimal temperatures. The activity of HOAD showed a similar pattern relative to CI + III and thermal environment. By contrast, PDHc and PK did not show the similar patterns with respect to CI + III and temperature. Cold-adapted species had high CIV activities compared to those of upstream complexes (I, II, I + III) whereas the converse was true for warm-adapted species. Our findings reveal a significant variability of heart mitochondrial organization among species that can be linked to temperature adaptation. Cold-adapted fish do not appear to compensate for PDHc activity but likely adjust fatty  oxidation through higher activities of CPT and HOAD relative to complexes I + III.Copyright © 2019 Hunter-Manseau, Desrosiers, Le François, Dufresne, Detrich, Nozais and Blier.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652987>Synthesis of a Smart Conductive Block Copolymer Responsive to Heat and Near Infrared Light.</a></h1><p>A method for the synthesis of a linear block copolymer (PNIPAM--PANI), containing a thermoresponsive block (poly(-isopropylacrylamide), PNIPAM) and a Near Infrared (NIR) light-absorbing block (polyaniline, PANI), is reported. The synthetic approach involves a two-step successive polymerization reaction. First, the radical polymerization of NIPAM is done using 4-aminothiophenol as a chain transfer agent for the obtention of thermosensitive block terminated with an aniline (ANI) moiety. Second, the oxidative polymerization of ANI is initiated in ANI moiety of thermosensitive block to grow the second conductive PANI block. H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and FT-IR spectroscopy shows the characteristics peaks of both polymeric blocks revealing the successful copolymerization process. Static Light Scattering (SLS) and UV-Visible combined measurements allowed the determination of the  for PNIPAM--PANI macromolecule: 5.5 × 10 g mol. The resulting copolymer is soluble in water (8.3 g L) and in non-aqueous solvents, such as ethanol, formic , acetonitrile, and others. Both polymer blocks chains show the properties of the polymer chains. The block copolymer shows a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) at the same temperature (32-34 °C) than PNIPAM, while the copolymer shows pH dependent UV-vis-NIR absorption similar to PANI. The PNIPAM block suffers a coil to globule transition upon NIR light irradiation (785 nm, 100 mW), as shown by turbidimetry and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), due to local heating (more than 9 °C in 12 min) induced by the NIR absorption at the PANI block. Furthermore, the electrical conductivity of PNIPAM--PANI thin films is demonstrated (resistivity of 5.3 × 10 Ω cm), indicating that the PANI block is present in its conductive form.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644673>IS THERE ANY CHANGE IN PHENOTYPIC CHARACTERISTICS COMPARING 5 TO 10 YEARS OF FOLLOW-UP IN OBESE PATIENTS UNDERGOING ROUX-EN-Y GASTRIC BYPASS?</a></h1><p>: Bariatric surgery promotes significant weight loss and improvement of associated comorbidities; however, nutrients deficiencies and weight regain may occur in the middle-late postoperative period.To investigate nutritional status in 10 years follow-up.: Longitudinal retrospective study in which anthropometric, biochemical indicators and nutritional intake were assessed before and after one, two, three, four, five and ten years of Roux-en Y gastric bypass through analysis of medical records.: After ten years there was a reduction of 29.2% of initial weight; however, 87.1% of patients had significant weight regain.

This may result from altered  metabolism or dietary habits.We hypothesized that a lower intake of BCAAs improves tissue-specific insulin sensitivity.This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, crossover trial examined well-controlled T2D patients receiving isocaloric diets (protein: 1 g/kg body weight) for 4 wk. Protein requirements were covered by commercially available food supplemented ≤60% by an AA mixture either containing all AAs or lacking BCAAs. The dietary intervention ensured sufficient BCAA supply above the recommended minimum daily intake. The patients underwent the mixed meal tolerance test (MMT), hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps (HECs), and skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue biopsies to assess insulin signaling.After the BCAA- diet, BCAAs were reduced by 17% during fasting (P < 0.001), by 13% during HEC (P < 0.01), and by 62% during the MMT (P < 0.001). Under clamp conditions, whole-body and hepatic insulin sensitivity did not differ between diets. After the BCAA- diet, however, the oral glucose sensitivity index was 24% (P < 0.01) and circulating fibroblast-growth factor 21 was 21% higher (P < 0.05), whereas meal-derived insulin secretion was 28% lower (P < 0.05). Adipose tissue expression of the mechanistic target of rapamycin was 13% lower, whereas the mitochondrial respiratory control ratio was 1.7-fold higher (both P < 0.05). The fecal microbiome was enriched in Bacteroidetes but depleted of Firmicutes.Short-term dietary reduction of BCAAs decreases postprandial insulin secretion and improves white adipose tissue metabolism and gut microbiome composition.

Using water spray to simulate rain, we demonstrate that jasmonic  (JA) signaling plays a key role in early gene-expression changes, well before it leads to developmental changes in flowering and plant architecture. The JA-activated transcription factors MYC2/MYC3/MYC4 modulate transiently induced expression of 266 genes, most of which peak within 30 min, and control 52% of genes induced >100-fold. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing analysis indicates that MYC2 dynamically binds >1,300 promoters and -activation assays show that MYC2 activates these promoters. By mining our multiomic datasets, we identified a core MYC2/MYC3/MYC4-dependent "regulon" of 82 genes containing many previously unknown MYC2 targets, including transcription factors  and  bHLH19 can in turn directly activate the  promoter, indicating that MYC2/MYC3/MYC4 initiate a hierarchical network of downstream transcription factors. Finally, we also reveal that rapid water spray-induced accumulation of JA and JA-isoleucine is directly controlled by MYC2/MYC3/MYC4 through a positive amplification loop that regulates JA-biosynthesis genes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656935>Nanometer-Scale Distribution of a Lubricant Modifier on Iron Films: A Frequency-Modulation Atomic Force Microscopy Study Combined with a Friction Test.</a></h1><p>Liquid lubricants used in mechanical applications are low-vapor-pressure hydrocarbons modified with a small quantity of polar compounds. The polar modifiers adsorbed on the surface of sliding solids dominate the friction properties when the sliding surfaces are in close proximity. However, a few methods are available for the characterization of the adsorbed modifiers of a nanometer-scale thickness. In this study, we applied frequency-modulation atomic force microscopy to evaluate the vertical and lateral density distributions of the adsorbed modifier in a real lubricant, namely, poly-α-olefin (PAO) modified with an orthophosphoric  oleyl ester. The liquid-induced force on the probing tip was mapped on a plane that was perpendicular to the lubricant-iron interface with a force sensitivity on the order of 10 pN. The PAO in the absence of the ester modifier was directly exposed to the film, which produced a few liquid layers parallel to the film surface with layer-to-layer distances of 0.6-0.7 nm. A monomolecular layer of the modifier was intermittently adsorbed with increasing ester concentration in the bulk lubricant, with complete coverage seen at 20 ppm. The CH chains of the oleyl esters fluctuating in the lubricant produced a repulsive force on the tip, which monotonically decayed with the tip-to-surface distance. The dynamic friction coefficient of sliding steel-lubricant-steel interfaces, which was separately determined using a friction tester, was compared with the force map determined on the iron film immersed in the corresponding lubricant. The complete monomolecular layer of the ester modifier on the static lubricant-iron boundary is a requirement for achieving smooth and stable friction at the sliding interface.Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652004>Drude polarizable force field for cation-π interactions of alkali and quaternary ammonium ions with aromatic amino  side chains.</a></h1><p>Cation-π interactions play important roles in molecular recognition and in the stability and function of proteins. However, accurate description of the structure and energetics of cation-π interactions presents a challenge to both additive and polarizable force fields, which are rarely designed to account for the complexation of charged groups with aromatic moieties. We calibrate the Drude polarizable force field for complexes of alkali metal ions (Li , Na , K , Rb , Cs ), ammonium (NH  ), tetramethylammonium (TMA ), and tetraethylammonium (TEA ) with aromatic amino  side chain model compounds (benzene, toluene, 4-methylphenol, 3-methylindole) using high-level ab initio quantum chemical properties of these complexes. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that cation-π complexes of the hard and tightly coordinated Li and Na ions are not stable in water but that larger ions form stable complexes, with binding free energies ranging between -0.8 and -2.9 kcal/mol. Like in gas phase, all complexes at equilibrium adopt an "en-face" complexation mode in water. The optimized Drude polarizable model provides an accurate description of the cation-π interactions involving small ions and proteins.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652992>Electrowinning of Iron from Spent Leaching Solutions Using Novel Anion Exchange Membranes.</a></h1><p>In the Pyror process, electrowinning (EW) is used to recover  and iron from spent leaching solutions (SLS), where a porous Terylene membrane acts as a separator between the cathode and anode. In this study, a novel anion exchange membrane (AEM)-based EW process is benchmarked against a process without and with a porous Terylene membrane by comparing the current efficiency, specific  consumption (SEC), and sulfuric  generation using an in-house constructed EW flow cell. Using an FAP-PK-130 commercial AEM, it was shown that the AEM-based process was more efficient than the traditional processes. Subsequently, 11 novel polybenzimidazole (PBI)-based blend AEMs were compared with the commercial AEM. The best performing novel AEM (BM-5), yielded a current efficiency of 95% at an SEC of 3.53 kWh/kg Fe, which is a 10% increase in current efficiency and a 0.72 kWh/kg Fe decrease in SEC when compared to the existing Pyror process. Furthermore, the use of the novel BM-5 AEM resulted in a 0.22 kWh/kg Fe lower SEC than that obtained with the commercial AEM, also showing mechanical stability in the EW flow cell. Finally, it was shown that below 5 g/L Fe, side reactions at the cathode resulted in a decrease in process efficiency, while 40 g/L yielded the highest efficiency and lowest SECs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672317>Protein intake and amino  supplementation regulate exercise recovery and performance through the modulation of mTOR, AMPK, FGF21, and immunity.</a></h1><p>Exercise is considered to be the best approach to improve quality of life, and together with a healthy and adequate dietary pattern, exercise represents the best strategy to reduce the risk of chronic metabolic and inflammatory diseases, such as those related to obesity. The regularity and intensity of exercise is modulated at the molecular level in the skeletal muscle by two protein kinases, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which act as sensors of external stimuli, showing the  status of muscular fibers. The mTOR pathway is activated by insulin and amino  availability, and its metabolic actions culminate in increased protein synthesis and reduced autophagy, leading to an increase in muscle mass. In contrast, AMPK activation induces a transcriptional program aimed to increase the mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle, transforming fast-twitch glycolytic fibers to slow-twitch oxidative fibers and increasing resistance to fatigue. In addition, inadequate exercise training induces imbalance in the immune response, generating excessive inflammation and/or immunosuppression. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent studies that provide insight into dietary protein interventions and/or amino  supplementation that may improve outcomes after exercise by modulating 1) mTOR and AMPK activation during early exercise recovery, leading to increased muscle protein synthesis or increased oxidative capacity; 2) undesirable inflammatory responses; and 3) fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) levels that may have relevant implications in skeletal muscle metabolism, particularly during the exercise recovery and performance of obese subjects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This study aimed to characterize main constituents of Ocimum basilicum L. (OB) aqueous extract and examine its protective effect on doxorubicin/irradiation (DOXO/IR)-induced testicular injury in rats.Spectrophotometric analysis showed considerable amount of polyphenolic (146.31 µg/mg) and flavonoid contents (28.63 µg/mg); UPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis revealed that the major flavonoid was apigenin-O-glucoside (7.53%) followed by luteolin (5.94%), while rosmarinic  was the major polyphenolic (15.76%) followed by caftaric  (9.39%); rutin and querctin were also present and were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography. Administration of OB extract (200 mg/kg per day; p.o.) to DOXO/IR rats resulted in marked improvement of associated testicular damage.Ocimum basilicum L. significantly decreased testicular levels of nuclear factor-kappa B and B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl2)-associated protein X, along with caspase-3 immunohistochemical staining. In addition, OB elevated testicular total antioxidant capacity, nuclear erythroid-related factor-2, Bcl2 and testosterone contents and Ki-67 immunohistochemical staining. Such changes were also accompanied by restoration of testicular architecture.The study highlights the protective role of OB aqueous extract in hampering most of the harmful chemotherapy/radiotherapy-induced outcomes via its antioxidant, antiapoptotic and cell regeneration abilities.

The identification of new effective biological markers for AMI is a prerequisite for treatment. Most proteomic studies have focused on atherosclerotic plaques, vascular cells, monocytes and platelets in the blood; however, the concentration of these factors in plasma is low, making it difficult to measure the complexity of plasma components. Moreover, some studies have examined the plasma protein of patients with acute coronary syndrome with histochemistry; however, the results are not consistent. Therefore, it is necessary to further investigate the differential proteins in the plasma of patients with AMI via proteomics to identify new biomarkers of AMI.In this study, immunodepletion of high-abundance plasma proteins followed by an isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomic approach was used to analyze plasma samples from 5 control individuals and 10 AMI patients.Four hundred sixty-eight proteins were identified from two samples, and 33 proteins were differentially expressed in AMI patients compared to the controls. Among the 33 proteins, 12 proteins showed a ≥1.5-fold change between AMI and control samples. These proteins included fatty  binding protein 3 (FABP3, ratio =6.36), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB ratio =4.89), adenylate kinase1 (AK1 ratio =4.16), pro-platelet basic protein (PPBP ratio =3.29), creatine kinase (CK ratio =2.88), platelet factor 4 (PF4 ratio =2.62), peptidyl prolyl isomerase Cyclophilin A (PPIA ratio =2.05), Cofilin-1 (CFL1 ratio =1.81), coronin1A (CORO1A ratio =1.71), protein kinase M (PKM ratio =1.63), ribonuclease inhibitor (RNH1, ratio =1.67), and triose phosphate isomerase (TPI1 ratio =1.56). By contrast, there was a decrease of 19 proteins, such as adiponectin (ADIPOQ ratio =0.70), insulin-like growth factor binding protein6 (IGFBP6 ratio =0.70), Dickkopf-related protein 3 (DKK3 ratio =0.70) and complement 4B (C4B ratio =0.68). The most over-represented term was regulation of cell proliferation in the cellular component category of Gene Ontology (GO). The top 3 biological process terms were regulation of cell proliferation, response to wounding and wound healing. These proteins included immune proteins, blood coagulation proteins, lipid metabolism proteins, cytoskeleton proteins,  metabolism proteins, gene regulation proteins, myocutaneous proteins, and myocardial remodeling proteins and were highly connected with each other, which indicates that the functional network of these processes contribute to the pathophysiology of AMI.In conclusion, the present quantitative proteomic study identified novel AMI biomarker candidates and might provide fundamental information for the development of an AMI biomarker.2019 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

The ZIF-8@SiO@FeO derived from self-assembly of ZIF-8 and SiO@FeO were then synthesized and used for ceftazidime (CAZ) removal. ZIF-8 was a regular dodecahedral particle with uniform particle size. The pore diameter was 6.47 nm and the specific surface area was 1182.5 m²·g in ZIF-8@SiO@FeO. The adsorption of CAZ on ZIF-8@SiO@FeO as a function of adsorption temperature, contact time, ionic strength solution pH, and humic  concentration were investigated. The error of equilibrium adsorption capacity between model fitting and actual experiments is only 1.19%. Kinetics for CAZ removal on ZIF-8@SiO@FeO was found to follow pseudo-second-order kinetics. Langmuir, Freundlich and Sips isotherm fitted the adsorption data well and gave similar correlation coefficients, suggesting a single layer adsorption of CAZ on ZIF-8@SiO@FeO. The ZIF-8@SiO@FeO showed no apparent loss in CAZ adsorption after five cycles. These features indicate that the ZIF-8@SiO@FeO may be a promising adsorbent for CAZ removal from aqueous solution.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Such a method normally uses fluorescent proteins or chemical labeling methods which are often only accessible to surface exposed residues and risk disturbing target protein structures. Here, we demonstrate that the genetic incorporation of a synthetic fluorescent amino , L-(7-hydroxycoumarin-4-yl) ethylglycine (Cou), and natural endogenous fluorophore Tryptophan (Trp) residues of a protein, could serve as an efficient FRET pair to monitor protein interactions, using the signaling transducer β-arrestin-1 as a model system. We used this technology to record the dynamic spectra in both binding and competition experiments of β-arrestin-1, the contribution of each specific phosphate in ternary complex formation, in a rapid and efficient manner. The determined Kd value for the association between the active arres-tin and Fab30 is 0.68 μM in the three components interaction system. Moreover, we were able to determine the contributions of the site 3 phospho-site and the site 6 phospho-site binding each contributed to the high affinity ternary complex assem-bling as 2.7 folds and 15.5 folds respectively, which were never determined before. These results thus highlighted the poten-tial usage of this new method in measurement of the allosteric induced enhanced affinity with small amount proteins and in a fast manner and in a complex system. Collectively, our newly developed Trp : Cou FRET system based on genetic expan-sion technology has extended the molecular toolboxes available for biochemical and structural biology studies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666638>UGCG influences glutamine metabolism of breast cancer cells.</a></h1><p>UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase (UGCG) is the key enzyme in glycosphingolipid (GSL) metabolism by being the only enzyme that generates glucosylceramide (GlcCer) de novo. Increased UGCG synthesis is associated with pro-cancerous processes such as increased proliferation and multidrug resistance in several cancer types. We investigated the influence of UGCG overexpression on glutamine metabolism in breast cancer cells. We observed adapted glucose and glutamine uptake in a limited  supply environment following UGCG overexpression. Glutamine is used for reinforced oxidative stress response shown by increased mRNA expression of glutamine metabolizing proteins such as glutathione-disulfide reductase (GSR) resulting in increased reduced glutathione (GSH) level. Augmented glutamine uptake is also used for fueling the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle to maintain the proliferative advantage of UGCG overexpressing cells. Our data reveal a link between GSL and glutamine metabolism in breast cancer cells, which is to our knowledge a novel correlation in the field of sphingolipid research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658932>Metabolisable  of grass and red clover silages fed to sheep at maintenance level.</a></h1><p>This study investigated the effect of forage type (grass or red clover) and harvesting time (primary growth or regrowth) of silage on  and N utilisation by sheep fed at maintenance level. Specifically, the assumption of constant loss of  of digestible organic matter from  losses in urine and CH4 applied in evaluation of silage metabolisable  (ME) was investigated. Urinary excretion of high- phenolic compounds related to solubilisation of lignin was assumed to affect urinary  (UE) losses from sheep fed highly digestible grass silage (GS). A total of 25 primary growth and regrowth silages of timothy (Phleum pratense) and meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis) grass mixtures and red clover (Trifolium pratense) samples collected in digestibility trials with sheep, including faecal and urine samples, were used for  and N determinations. Urinary concentration of monophenolic compounds and CH4 emissions in vitro were also analysed. Daily faecal N output, CH4 yield (MJ/kg DM intake), proportion of CH4  in digestible  (DE) and proportion of UE in DE were greater (P ≤ 0.03) in sheep fed red clover silage (RCS) than GS. Furthermore, less (P = 0.01)  was lost as UE of DE in sheep fed primary growth GS compared with the other treatments. The relationship between UE and silage N intake or urinary N output for both silage types (i.e. grass v. red clover) was strong, but the fit of the regressions was better for GS than RCS. The CH4/DE ratio decreased (P < 0.05) and the UE/DE ratio increased (P < 0.05) with increasing organic matter digestibility in RCS. These relationships were not significant (P < 0.05) for the GS diets. The regression coefficient was higher (P < 0.05) for GS than RCS when regressing ME concentration on digestible organic matter. The results of this study imply that ME/DE ratio is not constant across first-cut GS of different maturities. The ME production response may be smaller from highly digestible first-cut GS but could not be clearly related to urinary excretion of monophenols derived from solubilisation of lignin. Furthermore,  lost in urine was not clearly defined for RCS and was much more predictable for GS from silage N concentration.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647635>Inhibiting Charge Recombination in -Ru(NCS) Diimine Sensitizers with Aromatic Substituents.</a></h1><p>A series of -[Ru(LL)(dcbH)(NCS)] compounds, where dcbH = 2,2'-bipyridine-4,4'-dicarboxylic , and LL = 1,0-phenanthroline (Ru(phen)), 4,7-dipyrrole-1,10-phenanthroline (Ru(pyr)), 4,7-diindole-1,10-phenanthroline (Ru(ind)), or 4,7-dicarbazole-1,10-phenanthroline (Ru(cbz)), was investigated for application as sensitizers in mesoporous TiO Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs). A systematic increase in the number of rings of the aromatic substituents at the 4,7-positions of 1,10-phenanthroline allowed to tune the molecular size of the sensitizers and the  stored in the excited state, while maintaining the same ground-state Ru reduction potentials. These small structural changes had a significant influence on the rates and/or efficiencies of electron injection, back-electron transfer, recombination to oxidized mediators, lateral self-exchange electron transfer and regeneration through iodide oxidation that were reflected in distinct photoelectrochemical performance of full operating DSSCs. The global efficiencies, open-circuit voltages and short-circuit current densities of the DSSCs consistently followed the trend Ru(pyr) < Ru(ind) < Ru(phen) < Ru(cbz) and the most optimal performance of Ru(cbz) was ascribed to dramatically slower recombination to the oxidized redox mediators. Transient photovoltage and transient absorption experiments both revealed significantly slower recombination as the size of the aromatic substituents increased with Ru(cbz) providing the most promising behavior for application in dye-sensitization.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657547>A Green In-situ Growth Solid Electrolyte Interphase Layer with High Rebound Resilience For Long-life Lithium Metal Anodes.</a></h1><p>Lithium (Li) metal is one of the most promising anodes for the high- density lithium batteries.

Because the intensity and quality of sunlight can change dramatically throughout the day, various regulatory mechanisms help plants adjust their photosynthetic output accordingly, including the regulation of light  accumulation to prevent the generation of damaging reactive oxygen species. Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) is a regulatory mechanism that dissipates excess light , but how it is regulated is not fully elucidated. Herein, we report a new NPQ-regulatory protein named Day-Length-dependent Delayed-Greening1 (DLDG1). The Arabidopsis DLDG1 associates with the chloroplast envelope membrane, and the dldg1 mutant had a large NPQ value compared with wild type. The mutant also had a pale-green phenotype in developing leaves but only under continuous light; this phenotype was not observed when dldg1 was cultured in the dark for ≥8 h per day. DLDG1 is a homolog of the plasma-membrane-localizing cyanobacterial proton-extrusion-protein A that is required for light-induced H+ extrusion, and also shows similarity in its amino- sequence to that of Ycf10 encoded in the plastid genome. Arabidopsis DLDG1 enhances the growth-retardation phenotype of the Escherichia coli K+/H+ antiporter mutant, and the everted membrane vesicles of the E. coli expressing DLDG1 show the K+/H+ antiport activity. Our findings suggest that DLDG1 functionally interacts with Ycf10 to control H+ homeostasis in chloroplasts, which is important for the light-acclimation response, by optimizing the extent of NPQ.© The Author(s) 2019.

Planktonically grown  is known to prioritize the consumption of organic  including lactic  over catabolism of glucose using a CCR strategy termed "reverse diauxie."  is an opportunistic pathogen with well-documented biofilm phenotypes that are distinct from its planktonic phenotypes. Reverse diauxie has been described in planktonic cultures, but it has not been documented explicitly in  biofilms. Here a combination of exometabolomics and label-free proteomics was used to analyze planktonic and biofilm phenotypes for reverse diauxie.  biofilm cultures preferentially consumed lactic  over glucose, and in addition, the cultures catabolized the substrates completely and did not exhibit the acetate secreting "overflow" metabolism that is typical of many model microorganisms. The biofilm phenotype was enabled by changes in protein abundances, including lactate dehydrogenase, fumarate hydratase, GTP cyclohydrolase, L-ornithine N(5)-monooxygenase, and superoxide dismutase. These results are noteworthy because reverse diauxie-mediated catabolism of organic  necessitates a terminal electron acceptor like O, which is typically in low supply in biofilms due to diffusion limitation. Label-free proteomics identified dozens of proteins associated with biofilm formation including 16 that have not been previously reported, highlighting both the advantages of the methodology utilized here and the complexity of the proteomic adaptation for  biofilms. Documenting the reverse diauxic phenotype in  biofilms is foundational for understanding cellular nutrient and  fluxes, which ultimately control growth and virulence.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660489>Type 1 cluster of differentiation 36 deficiency-related cardiomyopathy accelerates heart failure with co-existing mitral valve prolapse: a case report.</a></h1><p>Free fatty  is a major  source in the healthy heart and cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) partially regulates the rate of myocardial fatty  uptake.

Cluster of differentiation 36 deficiency was found based on the absence of myocardial l-15-(p-iodophenyl)-3-(R,S)-methyl pentadecanoic  (BMIPP) uptake by myocardial scintigraphy. Type I CD36 deficiency was further diagnosed by the lack of CD36 in both platelets and monocytes by flow cytometry. Left ventricular muscle was obtained intraoperatively, and a histological examination reflected compensative hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes with myofibrillar loss and reactive fibrosis. The microvascular structure around the cardiomyocytes was highlighted by immunohistochemical staining for CD31, while CD36 expression was absent. He had an operation of mitral valve replacement and improved heart failure.Cluster of differentiation 36 deficiency potentially mediates various pathological conditions in the heart. Incidental CD36 deficiency-related cardiomyopathy may accelerate heart failure in the presence of co-existing heart diseases. BMIPP scintigraphy might be helpful for predicting CD36 deficiency.© The Author(s) 2019.

It requires many and different radioactivity measurements in order to radiation protection, radioactive waste management and environmental protection. An accurate and reliable determination of Strontium-90 in various environment matrices has been studied with many techniques such as co-precipitation, ion exchange, solvent extraction and extraction chromatography for environmental contamination monitoring purposes. In this study, the method used for dissolution and radiochemical separation to determine strontium-90 activity concentration in tea matrix used as proficiency test sample with liquid scintillation counter was investigated. As a result of these studies, the average mean activity concentration of strontium-90 in proficiency test material was determined as 155 ± 16 Bq kg dry matter (k = 2) by liquid scintillation efficiency tracing (CIEMAT/NIST) method for seven selected samples. This value was also confirmed by Joint Research Center-Geel with the CIEMAT/NIST method. The proficiency test results for consistency were checked by Dioxon's Q-test. Uncertainties arising from counting statistics, background, weighing, half-life, chemical recovery, efficiency and homogeneity were calculated.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Epitopes centering GSTA sequence are also predicted by NetMHC programs to bind to MHC molecules. Detecting MUC1 glycopeptide epitopes remains a challenge since antigenic epitopes are often shorter than 10 amino .In this study, we used pronase from Streptomyces griseus, which has no amino  sequence preference for enzymatic cleavage sites, to digest synthetic glycopeptides RPAPGST (Tn)APPAHG and RPAPGS (Tn)TAPPAHG, and analyzed the digests by LC-MS using electron transfer dissociation (ETD) and higher- collisional dissociation (HCD) methods with Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribid Mass Spectrometer.We found that short glycopeptides containing 8 to 11 amino  could be efficiently generated by pronase digestion. Such glycopeptides of minimal epitope lengths were clearly distinguished by characteristic MS/MS ion patterns and elution profiles of liquid chromatography. A glycopeptide library was generated which may serve as standards for measuring neoantigen epitopes centering GSTA sequence.Our data established the LC-MS/MS identities of a clinically-relevant MUC1 glycopeptide neoantigen epitope centering GSTA motif. A library of short MUC1 glycopeptides centered on GSTA motif was created, which is a critical step for analysis of such antigen epitopes in real biological samples.This article is protected by copyright.

The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) primarily regulates the expression of target genes involved in  control as well as lipid and glucose metabolism. Although the pivotal roles of these receptors on female fertility have been reported, there are limited studies addressing PPARs role(s) in the male. This study was designed to determine and compare  and  mRNA expression in sperm cells of normozoospermic and asthenozoospermic men. In addition, flow cytometric analyses, immunofluorescence and western blot were used to evaluate PPARγ protein levels in spermatozoa. We have compared the sperm  mRNA relative expression in 27 normozoospermic and 28 asthenozoospermic samples and monitored sperm PPARγ protein levels in 39 normozoospermic and 40 asthenozoospermic samples using flow cytometry. We have also assessed in a sub-group of seven normozoospermic and eight asthenozoospermic samples, PPARγ protein levels by western blotting. Relative expression of PPARγ mRNA in normozoospermic men was found to be significantly higher (P = 0.004) than in asthenozoospermic men while  and  relative expression was similar in the two groups. Likewise,  showed a positive correlation with motility (r = 0.34; P < 0.05), sperm concentration (r = 0.33) and the percentage of progressive motile spermatozoa (r = 0.31). In agreement with the mRNA behavior, sperm PPARγ protein levels as measured by flow cytometry (P = 0.066) and western blot (P = 0.089) showed a tendency to be higher in normozoospermic than asthenozoospermic men. The present study proposes a link between PPARγ gene expression level and motility in human sperm.

Herein, a highly active electrocatalyst of nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanosheets coupled with MoC nanoparticles (MoC/NPC) was synthesized by a novel method with high BET surface area of 1380 m g using KOH to activate carbon composite materials. The KOH plays a key role in etching out MoS to produce Mo precursor; simultaneously, it corrodes carbon to form porous structure and produce reducing gas such as H and CO.

In our previous study, we showed bitter melon extract (BME) prevents carcinogen induced mouse oral cancer. RNA sequence analysis from mouse tongue revealed a significant modulation in "Metabolic Process" by altering glycolysis and lipid metabolic pathways in BME fed group as compared to cancer group. In present study, we evaluated the effect of BME on glycolysis and lipid metabolism pathways in human oral cancer cells.Cal27 and JHU022 cells were treated with BME. RNA and protein expression were analysed for modulation of glycolytic and lipogenesis genes by quantitative real-time PCR, western blot analyses and immunofluorescence. Lactate and pyruvate level was determined by GC/MS. Extracellular acidification and glycolytic rate were measured using the Seahorse XF analyser. Shotgun lipidomics in Cal27 and JHU022 cell lines following BME treatment was performed by ESI/ MS. ROS was measured by FACS.Treatment with BME on oral cancer cell lines significantly reduced mRNA and protein expression levels of key glycolytic genes SLC2A1 (GLUT-1), PFKP, LDHA, PKM and PDK3. Pyruvate and lactate levels and glycolysis rate were reduced in oral cancer cells following BME treatment. In lipogenesis pathway, we observed a significant reduction of genes involves in fatty  biogenesis, ACLY, ACC1 and FASN, at the mRNA and protein levels following BME treatment. Further, BME treatment significantly reduced phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and plasmenylethanolamine, and reduced iPLA2 activity. Additionally, BME treatment inhibited lipid raft marker flotillin expression and altered its subcellular localization. ER-stress associated CHOP expression and generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species were induced by BME, which facilitated apoptosis.Our study revealed that bitter melon extract inhibits glycolysis and lipid metabolism and induces ER and oxidative stress-mediated cell death in oral cancer. Thus, BME-mediated metabolic reprogramming of oral cancer cells will have important preventive and therapeutic implications along with conventional therapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649621>Mitochondrial Dysfunction Pathway Networks and Mitochondrial Dynamics in the Pathogenesis of Pituitary Adenomas.</a></h1><p>Mitochondrion is a multi-functional organelle, which is associated with various signaling pathway networks, including  metabolism, oxidative stress, cell apoptosis, cell cycles, autophagy, and immunity process. Mitochondrial proteins have been discovered to modulate these signaling pathway networks, and multiple biological behaviors to adapt to various internal environments or signaling events of human pathogenesis. Accordingly, mitochondrial dysfunction that alters the bioenergetic and biosynthetic state might contribute to multiple diseases, including cell transformation and tumor. Multiomics studies have revealed that mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and cell cycle dysregulation signaling pathways operate in human pituitary adenomas, which suggest mitochondria play critical roles in pituitary adenomas. Some drugs targeting mitochondria are found as a therapeutic strategy for pituitary adenomas, including melatonin, melatonin inhibitors, temozolomide, pyrimethamine, 18 beta-glycyrrhetinic , gossypol acetate, Yougui pill, T-2 toxin, grifolic , cyclosporine A, dopamine agonists, and paeoniflorin. This article reviews the latest experimental evidence and potential biological roles of mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial dynamics in pituitary adenoma progression, potential molecular mechanisms between mitochondria and pituitary adenoma progression, and current status and perspectives of mitochondria-based biomarkers and targeted drugs for effective management of pituitary adenomas.Copyright © 2019 Li and Zhan.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646261>The association of food consumption and nutrient intake with endometriosis risk in Iranian women: A case-control study.</a></h1><p>Endometriosis, defined as the attendance of endometrial-like lesions in extra uterine locations, causes pain, infertility, and reduced quality of life.To evaluate the relationship between food consumption and nutrient intake with risk of endometriosis.Of the 156 women approached for the study, 78 women had endometriosis and 78 healthy women were included in the control group.

By taking into account that storage is a key factor in the effective use of renewable , the present article is an overview about storage systems which are appropriate for BIPV and BIPVT applications. The literature review shows that there are multiple storage solutions, based on different kinds of materials (batteries, Phase Change Material (PCM) components, etc.). In terms of BIPV and BIPVT with batteries or PCMs or water tanks as storage systems, most of the installations are non-concentrating, façade- or roof-integrated, water- or air-based (in the case of BIPVT) and include silicon-based PV cells, lead- or lithium-ion batteries, paraffin- or salt-based PCMs. Regarding parameters that affect the environmental profile of storage systems, in the case of batteries critical factors such as material manufacturing, accidental release of electrolytes, inhalation toxicity, flammable elements, degradation and end-of-life management play a pivotal role. Regarding PCMs, there are some materials that are corrosive and present fire-safety issues as well as high toxicity in terms of human health and ecosystems. Concerning water storage tanks, based on certain studies about tanks with volumes of 300 L and 600 L, their impacts range from 5.9 to 11.7 GJ and from 0.3 to 1.0 t CO. Finally, it should be noted that additional storage options such as Trombe walls, pebble beds and nanotechnologies are critically discussed. The contribution of the present article to the existing literature is associated with the fact that it presents a critical review about storage devices in the case of BIPV and BIPVT applications, by placing emphasis on the environmental profile of certain storage materials.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Cu and In2O3 catalysts both show catalytic activity for acetic  hydrogenation. However, monometallic Cu catalysts are less active in the dissociative adsorption of acetic  through C-O bond breaking, while the H2 adsorption and dissociation ability of In2O3 is weak. In this work, Cu4/In2O3 is designed to enhance the dissociation of both acetic  and H2. The detailed mechanism of acetic  hydrogenation to ethanol on Cu4/In2O3 is explored using periodic density functional theory (DFT). The results show that the H2 adsorption and dissociation are enhanced by the Cu cluster, while the H atom spillover from Cu to In2O3 is favorable on the Cu4/In2O3(110) surface. Additionally, a synergistic effect exists between the Cu cluster and In2O3 surface: H2 adsorbs on the Cu cluster and the dissociated H atoms react with acetic  activated by the In2O3 oxygen vacancy. Finally, compared with a Cu2In(100) surface, the Cu4/In2O3(110) surface possesses higher catalytic activity owing to the reduced  barriers of acetic  dissociation and hydrogenation of the intermediates (CH3COO*, CH3CHO*, and CH3CH2O*). The Cu4/In2O3 catalyst proposed in this work can provide promising guidance for related catalyst design.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652604>Hyperacetylation of Cardiac Mitochondrial Proteins Is Associated with Metabolic Impairment and Sirtuin Downregulation after Chronic Total Body Irradiation of ApoE  Mice.</a></h1><p>Chronic exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Alteration in  metabolism has been suggested to contribute to radiation-induced heart pathology, mitochondrial dysfunction being a hallmark of this disease. The goal of this study was to investigate the regulatory role of acetylation in heart mitochondria in the long-term response to chronic radiation. ApoE-deficient C57Bl/6J mice were exposed to low-dose-rate (20 mGy/day) gamma radiation for 300 days, resulting in a cumulative total body dose of 6.0 Gy. Heart mitochondria were isolated and analyzed using quantitative proteomics. Radiation-induced proteome and acetylome alterations were further validated using immunoblotting, enzyme activity assays, and ELISA. In total, 71 proteins showed peptides with a changed acetylation status following irradiation. The great majority (94%) of the hyperacetylated proteins were involved in the TCA cycle, fatty  oxidation, oxidative stress response and sirtuin pathway. The elevated acetylation patterns coincided with reduced activity of mitochondrial sirtuins, increased the level of Acetyl-CoA, and were accompanied by inactivation of major cardiac metabolic regulators PGC-1 alpha and PPAR alpha. These observations suggest that the changes in mitochondrial acetylation after irradiation is associated with impairment of heart metabolism. We propose a novel mechanism involved in the development of late cardiac damage following chronic irradiation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644270>Super Strong and Tough Hydrogel through Physical Crosslinking and Molecular Alignment.</a></h1><p>Hydrogels are attracting increasing attention due to their potential use in various fields. However, most of the existing hydrogels have limitations in either dissipating mechanical  or maintaining high stretchability under deformation, thus don't possess high mechanical properties. Herein, poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA)-tannic  (TA) hydrogels with both high mechanical strength and stretchability were obtained via a step by step physical crosslinking and molecular alignment method. Saline triggered physical interactions serve as "sacrifice domains" to dissipate  and endow PVA based hydrogel with high mechanical strength (≈ 16 MPa) and stretchability (≈ 1000 %). Due to the reversible arranging and disassociating property of physical interactions, PVA-TA hydrogels show excellent shape memory performance. We further demonstrated an effective approach to fabricate strong and aligned PVA-TA thread. The resultant well-aligned PVA-TA dry thread reveals an ultra-high mechanical tensile strength of up to 750 MPa, nearly 45 times higher than PVA-TA thread with no alignment. Wide-angle X-ray (WXRD) 2D diffraction images further confirmed the alignment of PVA fibers in stretching direction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658659>A Facile Method to Prepare Silver Doped Graphene Combined with Polyaniline for High Performances of Filter Paper Based Flexible Electrode.</a></h1><p>A flexible filter paper based composite electrode was prepared via the convenient one-step synthesis of silver doped graphene for the first time, followed by in-situ polymerization of aniline monomers. Using L-ascorbic  for simultaneous reduction of grapheme oxide and silver nitrate, we provided a new and green method to prepare graphene hybrid sheets without toxicity. It was found that the as-fabricated hybrid electrode formed a three-dimensional porous architecture, which not only increased the specific surface area of composite, but also facilitated the ion diffusion of the electrolyte. In addition, according to the tests of electrochemical performances, the flexible hybrid electrode subsequently exhibited exceptional specific capacitance of 437.3 F/g,  density of 1133.5 W·h/kg and power density of 88.8 kW/kg, respectively. Meanwhile, the as-prepared hybrid demonstrated a good cycling stability with only 10.99% specific capacitance deterioration after 5000 times of cycling. This preparation technology presented here shows great potential for the development and application of wearable and portable  storage devices, particularly for flexible supercapacitors.

The transport and retention of CuO NPs are vital to understanding the fate as well as the life cycle of CuO NPs in the environment. This study systematically investigates the transport and retention of CuO NPs in saturated porous media, and the experimental results were explained by the CFT and DLVO theory. The van der Waals force between CuO NPs and collector was repulsive, resulting in the unfavorable deposition condition. Column experiments were conducted with saturated quartz sand under environmentally relevant pH (6, 8, 9), ionic strength (IS, 1, 10, 50 mM), and humic  (HA, 0.1-10 mg-C/mL). Experimental results show that the breakthrough curves (BCTs) were affected by different pH and IS. Under pH 6 and 9, the mobility of CuO NPs was enhanced by high IS while the mobility was inhibited by high IS under pH 8. The mobility of CuO NPs was enhanced by humic  and the effect was best at 0.5 mg-C/mL HA. The experimental results were successfully explained by CFT and DLVO theory, the main mechanisms were aggregation of CuO NPs, interaction  and collision between CuO NPs and collector. In general, these findings can improve our understanding of the transport and retention of CuO NPs in subsurface environments, and suggest pH, IS, HA may be key factors governing mobility and stability of CuO NPs in natural environment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Significant advances in the chemoselectivity and enantioselectivity of [2+2] photocycloadditions have been made, but exceptional and tunable diastereoselectivity and regioselectivity (head-to-head versus head-to-tail adducts) is required for the synthesis of bioactive molecules.

The ratios of the slopes of the correlations between -DlnA values and individual DBPs concentrations (S/S) were observed to be linearly correlated with the ratios of the Gibbs free energies (ΔG/ΔG) of the corresponding reactions of chloramine and chlorine with acetaldehyde which was used as a model DBP precursor in QC simulations. Further QC examination of the kinetics of chlorination and chloramination of the model compound acetoacetic  showed that the activation  of reactions between monochloramine that directly participates in substitution reactions to form mono-, di and tri-halogenated intermediates are 2-3 times higher than those of HOCl formed via the hydrolysis monochloramine. This result confirms that the interactions of chloramine with NOM and ensuing DBP formation are primarily mediated by the free chlorine released as a result of the hydrolysis of monochloramine while direct halogenation of NOM by monochloramine is likely to provide a small contribution to DBP formation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Triplet excited states of these drugs have been shown as reporters of FQ self-association using laser flash photolysis technique. A study using low-temperature phosphorescence technique was performed with quinolone derivatives such as enoxacin (ENX), norfloxacin (NFX), pefloxacin (PFX), ciprofloxacin (CPX, ofloxacin (OFX), nalidixic  (NLA), pipemidic  (PPA) and piromidic  (PRA) to explore emission changes associated with self-associations and to shed some light on the triplet excited state  (E) discrepancies described in the literature for most of these drugs. The emissions obtained at 77 K in buffered aqueous medium revealed that the amphoteric nature of the quinolones CPX, NFX, PFX, ENX, OFX and PPA must generate their self-associations because a redshift of their phosphorescence maxima is produced by FQ concentrations increases. Hence, this effect was not observed for NLA and PRA or when all quinolones were analysed using ethanol or ethylene glycol aqueous mixtures as glassed solvents. Interestingly, the presence of these organic mixtures produced a blue-shift in the phosphorescence emission maximum of each FQ. Additionally, laser flash photolysis experiments with PRA and the amphoteric quinolone PPA, compounds with the same skeleton but different peripheral substituent, confirm the expected correlations between the amphoteric nature of compounds and their self-associations in aqueous media because the excimer generation was only detected for PPA. Now, the discrepancies described in the literature for the E of FQs can be understood considering that changes of medium polarity or proticity as well as the temperature can considerably modify their E values. Thereby, low-temperature phosphorescence technique, is an effective way to detect molecular self-associations and surrounding changes in quinolones that opens the possibility to evaluate these effects in other drug families.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, modulation of the inflammatory response towards biomaterials can potentially enable a favorable healing response associated with functional tissue formation and tissue regeneration. In this work, incorporation of nicotinic  in 3D silk scaffolds is explored as an immunomodulatory strategy for implantable biomaterials. Silk scaffolds were fabricated from dissolved Bombyx mori silk fibers by freeze-drying, resulting in silk scaffolds with high porosity (>94%), well-connected macropores, a high swelling degree (>550%) and resistance to in vitro degradation. Furthermore, drug-loaded scaffolds displayed a sustained drug release and excellent cytocompatibility could be observed with osteoblast-like MG63 cells. Cultivating M1-like macrophages on the scaffolds revealed that scaffolds loaded with nicotinic  suppress gene expression of pro-inflammatory markers TNF-α, CXCL10 and CD197 as well as secretion of TNF-α in a concentration dependant manner. Hence, this study provides insights into the possible application of nicotinic  in tissue engineering to control inflammatory responses towards biomaterials and potentially help minimizing FBR.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671747>Integrated Process for Sequential Extraction of Bioactive Phenolic Compounds and Proteins from Mill and Field Olive Leaves and Effects on the Lignocellulosic Profile.</a></h1><p>The extraction of bioactive compounds in a biorefinery context could be a way to valorize agri-food byproducts, but there is a remaining part that also requires attention. Therefore, in this work the integrated extraction of phenolic compounds, including the bioactive oleuropein, and proteins from olive mill leaves was addressed following three schemes, including the use of ultrasound. This affected the total phenolic content (4475.5-6166.9 mg gallic  equivalents/100 g), oleuropein content (675.3-1790.0 mg/100 g), and antioxidant activity (18,234.3-25,459.0 µmol trolox equivalents/100 g). No effect was observed on either the protein recovery or the content of sugars and lignin in the extraction residues. Concerning the recovery of proteins, three operational parameters were evaluated by response surface methodology. The optimum (63.1%) was achieved using NaOH 0.7 M at 100 °C for 240 min. Then, the selected scheme was applied to olive leaves from the field, observing differences in the content of some of the studied components.

Interestingly the HER activity increases with increasing concentration of Pt4+ species in the nanoparticles, and the optimized catalyst even outperforms commercial Pt/C, exhibiting an overpotential of only -7.7 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm-2 and a Tafel slope of -26.3 mV dec-1.

Polystyrene was used as sacrificial support, SnO was selected as inorganic matrix, surface imprinting using catechol as fragment template and 4-vinylphenylboronic  as boronate-affinity functional monomer. A thin layer of poly 2-anilinoethanol (2-AE) was formed to coat the boronate-affinity hollow SnO surface through self-polymerization, it has strong hydrophilicity and limited residual boric  content, avoiding non-specific binding. The hollow structure could bind to target molecules effectively and facilitate the removal of template molecules. The Bh@SnO-FMIPs were used to extract three cis-diol polyphenols containing catechin, chlorogenic , and caffeic  in tea and juice samples. Combination with seven characterizations of the material confirmed the successful preparation. Effecting the imprinting conditions and extraction efficiency parameters were optimized separately. Selective and competitive adsorption experiments indicated that the materials could specific recognition polyphenols. Using solid phase extraction and high performance liquid chromatography method, the detection limits were 0.005-0.046 μg mL and the recoveries were between 82.3-104.3%. The improved adsorption performance may be assigned to the synergistic effects among boronate-affinity, hollow SnO, and 2-AE self-polymerization. It may enhance binding cavities, hydrophilicity, biocompatibility of adsorbent material, and prevent the aggregation of Sn during the preparation processes.Copyright © 2019.

The atypical profilin Arabidopsis AtPRF3 has been reported to cooperate with canonical profilin isoforms in suppressing formin-mediated actin polymerization during plant innate immunity responses. AtPRF3 has a 37-amino--long N terminal extension (NTE), and its suppressive effect on actin assembly is derived from enhanced interaction with the poly-proline (Poly-P) of the formin AtFH1. However, the molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we solved the crystal structures of AtPRF3Δ22 and AtPRF3Δ37, as well as AtPRF2 apo form and in complex with AtFH1 Poly-P at 1.5-3.6 Å resolutions. By combining these structures with molecular modeling, we found that AtPRF3Δ22 NTE has high plasticity, with a primary "closed" conformation that can adopt an open conformation that enables Poly-P binding. Furthermore, using molecular dynamics simulation and free- calculations of protein-protein binding, along with experimental validation, we show that the AtPRF3Δ22 binds to Poly-P in an adaptive manner, thereby enabling different binding modes that maintain the interaction through disordered sequences. Together, our structural and simulation results suggest that the dynamic conformational changes of the AtPRF3 NTE upon Poly-P binding modulate their interactions to fine-tune formin-mediated actin assembly.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653845>Anomalous hydrogen evolution behavior in high-pH environment induced by locally generated hydronium ions.</a></h1><p>Most fundamental studies of electrocatalysis are based on the experimental and simulation results obtained for bulk model materials. Some of these mechanistic understandings are inapplicable for more active nanostructured electrocatalysts. Herein, considering the simplest and most typical electrocatalytic process, the hydrogen evolution reaction, an alternative reaction mechanism is proposed for nanomaterials based on the identification of a new intermediate, which differs from those commonly known for the bulk counterparts. In-situ Raman spectroscopy and electrochemical thermal/kinetic measurements were conducted on a series of nanomaterials under different conditions. In high-pH electrolytes with negligible hydronium (HO) concentration in bulk phase, massive HO intermediates are found generating on the catalytic surface during water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption processes. These HO intermediates create a unique -like local reaction environment on nanostructured catalytic surfaces and cut the  barrier of the overall reaction. Such phenomena on nanostructured electrocatalysts explain their widely observed anomalously high activity under high-pH conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634809>Untargeted metabolomic profiling reveals that different responses to self and cross pollination in each flower morph of the heteromorphic plant Plumbago auriculata.</a></h1><p>Heteromorphic self-incompatibility (HetSI), which is regulated by sporophytes, occurs in some species as a strategy to promote cross-pollination. This research aimed to reveal metabolic changes occurring in HetSI. We used fluorescence microscopy as a tool to compare growth behavior in self-incompatible (SI) and self-compatible (SC) pollination in both pin and thrum flowers of Plumbago auriculata and to identify the ideal timepoint for sample collection for subsequent experiments. We also employed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to evaluate intermorph structural differences in the pollen grains and stigmas in relation to HetSI. Importantly, UPLC-MS/MS was applied in this study to identify metabolites, compare metabolic differences between pin and thrum styles and monitor metabolic changes in SC and SI pollinations in the two types of flowers. The metabolites mainly included amino /peptides, flavonoids, glycosides/sugars, phenols, other organic , fatty  (derivatives)/lipids, amines, aldehydes, alkaloids, alcohols and other compounds. Surprisingly, -related nutrients such as amino /peptides and tricarboxylic  cycle-related metabolites were found at higher levels in SI pollinations than in SC pollinations. This result indicates that physiological changes in pollen-stigma interactions differ in pin and thrum styles and SC and SI pollinations and that  deficiency is not one of the reasons for HetSI.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

A very simple and truly cost-effective synthetic strategy is proposed to prepare SACs via a impregnation-pyrolysis method, through one-step pyrolysis of graphene oxide aerogel. Compared with other traditional methods, this process is fast and free of repeated  etching, and thus it has great potential for facile operation and large-scale manufacturing. Both X-ray absorption fine structure and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy images confirm the presence of isolated nickel atoms, with a high Ni loading of ≈2.6 wt%. The obtained 3D porous Ni- and N-codoped graphene aerogel exhibits excellent activity toward electroreduction of CO to CO, in particular exhibiting a remarkable CO Faradaic efficiency of 90.2%. Density functional theory calculations reveal that free energies for the formation of intermediate *COOH on coordinatively unsaturated NiN sites are significantly lower than that on NiN site, suggesting the outstanding activities of CO electroreduction originate from coordinatively unsaturated NiN sites in catalysts.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This condition is accompanied by an extensive series of relatively serious neuropsychiatric symptoms. The diagnosis of PANS is made by "exclusion", as the individual PANS symptoms overlap with a multiplicity of psychiatric disorders with onset in childhood. Several researchers accumulated evidence to support the hypothesis that PANS was closely associated with a variety of infections. In the last decade, metabolomics played an essential role in improving the knowledge of complex biological systems and identifying potential new biomarkers, as indicators of pathological progressions, or pharmacologic responses to therapy. The metabolome is considered the most predictive phenotype, capable to catch epigenetic differences, reflecting more closely the clinical reality at any given moment and thus providing extremely dynamic data. In the present work, we review the most recent hypothesis and suggested mechanisms of this condition and describe the case of a 10 year -year-old girl with PANS, before and after clarithromycin treatment. The main results of this case report are discussed from a metabolomics point of view. The alteration of several metabolic pathways concerning the microbial activity highlights the possible role of the microbiome in the development of PANS. Furthermore, different metabolic perturbations at the level of the protein biosynthesis,  and amino  metabolisms were observed and discussed. Based on our observations, we believe that metabolomics is a promising technology to unravel the mysteries of PANS in the near future.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638767>Quantification of Cellular Deoxyribonucleoside Triphosphates by Rolling Circle Amplification and Förster Resonance  Transfer.</a></h1><p>The quantification of cellular deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) levels is important for studying pathologies, genome integrity, DNA repair, and the efficacy of pharmacological drug treatments. Current standard methods, such as enzymatic assays or high-performance liquid chromatography, are complicated, costly, and labor-intensive, and alternative techniques that simplify dNTP quantification would present very useful complementary approaches. Here, we present a dNTP assay based on isothermal rolling circle amplification (RCA) and rapid time-gated Förster resonance  transfer (TG-FRET), which used a commercial clinical plate reader system. Despite the relatively simple assay format, limits of detection down to a few picomoles of and excellent specificity for each dNTP against the other dNTPs, rNTPs, and dUTP evidenced the strong performance of the assay. Direct applicability of RCA-FRET to applied nucleic  research was demonstrated by quantifying all dNTPs in CEM-SS leukemia cells with and without hydroxyurea or auranofin treatment. Both pharmacological agents could reduce the dNTP production in a time- and dose-dependent manner.

MΦs display a spectrum of functional phenotypes as a result of microenvironmental and stress-induced stimuli. Evidence has emerged demonstrating that metabolism is not only crucial for the generation of  and biomolecular precursors, but also contributes to the function and plasticity of MΦs. Here, 1D H NMR-based metabolomics was employed to identify metabolic pathways that are differentially modulated following primary human monocyte-derived MΦ activation with pro-inflammatory (M1) or anti-inflammatory (M2a) stimuli relative to resting (M0) MΦs. The metabolic profiling of M1 MΦs indicated a substantial increase in oxidative stress as well as a decrease in mitochondrial respiration. These metabolic profiles also provide compelling evidence that M1 MΦs divert metabolites from  glycerophospholipid synthesis to inhibit oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, glycolysis and lactic  fermentation were significantly increased in both M1 and M2a MΦs. These metabolic patterns highlight robust metabolic activation markers of MΦ phenotypes. Overall, our study generates additional support to previous observations, presents novel findings regarding the metabolic modulation of human MΦs following activation, and contributes new knowledge to the rapidly evolving field of immunometabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648082>Effect of nanofluid on CO-wettability reversal of sandstone formation; implications for CO geo-storage.</a></h1><p>Nanofluid treatment is a promising technique which can be used for wettability reversal of CO-brine-mineral systems towards a further favourable less CO-wet state in the existence of organic . However, literature requires more information and study with respect to organic  and nanoparticles' effect at reservoir (high pressure and high temperature) conditions.Therefore, we have measured in this study that what influence small amounts of organic  exposed to quartz for aging time of (7 days and 1 year) have on their wettability and how this impact can be reduced by using different concentrations of nanoparticles at reservoir conditions. Precisely, we have tested lignoceric  (C), stearic  (C), lauric  (C) and hexanoic  (C) at 10 Molarity, as well as, we have also used different concentrations (0.75 wt%, 0.25 wt%, 0.1 wt%, 0.05 wt%) of silica nanoparticles at realistic storage conditions.The quartz surface turned significantly hydrophobic when exposed to organic  for longer aging time of 1 year, and significantly hydrophilic after nanofluid treatment at optimum concentration of 0.1 wt%. It was observed that most nanoparticles were mechanistically irreversibly adsorbed on the surface of quartz sample.

The involved molecular mechanisms were investigated for the first time using transcriptome and metabolome in this study. Results showed that subinhibitory concentration of PT (0.5 mg/ml) induced significant changes in MRSA at both transcriptional and metabolic levels, as 370 genes and 19 metabolites were differentially expressed. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the varying genes and metabolites were mainly involved in pathways of membrane transport, amino , carbohydrate, and  metabolism. The highlighted changes were those related to osmotic regulation, intracellular pH regulation, amino  synthesis and metabolism, glycolysis, TCA cycle and iron metabolism, suggesting the multifaceted effects including cell membrane damage, amino  limitation,  metabolism disorder and iron deprivation induced by PT.

However, high pressure devices are essential for observing mechanical responses of carbon dots, but they limit the widespread application of mechanical responsive CDs. Two kinds of CDs were prepared using pyrene derivative (pyrene-1-butyric , PyBA) as carbon source, and had fluorescence enhancement via simply grinding. An apparent 20-30 times emission enhancement can be observed after the treatment of grinding because of CDs packed structure and morphology changes. To the best of our knownledge, it is the first example of mechanical responsive CDs with fluorescence enhancement without the stimulation of any complex pressure instrumentation. This simple approach could be extended to other carbon sources with π-conjugated structure for building new intelligentized CDs, and provide new routes for the applications of CDs toward mechanical sensing.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In our previous study, the distribution and toxicity to plants of soil Al species and soil labile Al fractions were examined. However, the toxicity of different forms of Al on the bacterial community has not been completely studied. In this study, five soil samples (pH: 4.92, 6.17, 6.62, 6.70, 8.51) were collected from Lichuan, China. Tall fescue was planted in rhizosphere boxes with those soils for 120 days. The toxicity of soil Al species and soil labile Al fractions on the bacterial community of near-rhizosphere (NR) soils and far-rhizosphere (FR) soils were analyzed. The effect of different forms of Al on bacterial community between NR and FR soils was small, but the difference was obvious according to the different spatial distribution of samples. An individual bacterial community has eosinophilia, and most bacterial communities are tolerant of heavy metals (e.g., Cu, Zn, Cd). The toxicity of exchangeable Al has a strong effect on the bacterial community. Meanwhile, the toxicity of Al to the bacterial community is strong. In this study, the key finding was that the toxicity of the Al-F complex toward the bacterial community and plants was different. AlF, AlF, AlF, and AlF are toxic for the bacterial community, and the correlation decreases with the addition of F. This finding is of considerable significance to the treatment of -contaminated soil and the study of the tolerance mechanism of plants toward Al.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Data from two non-consecutive food records from the National Dietary Survey/Household Budget Survey 2008-2009 were used to estimate the usual dietary folate intake in µg dietary folate equivalents (DFEs). The National Cancer Institute method was used to account for within-person variance and the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) cut-point method was used to calculate the POFI.

However, the understanding of the kinetics, evolved gases and mechanisms for biomass pyrolysis is limited. We first propose a novel temperature response mechanism for the pyrolysis of sugar cane residue using thermogravimetric analysis-Fourier transform infrared spectrometry-mass spectrometry (TG-FTIR-MS) combined with Gaussian model and two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D COS). The existence and contribution of distinct peaks in TG-FTIR spectra were innovatively distinguished and quantified, and the temperature-dependent dynamics of gas amounts were determined using Gaussian deconvolution. The 2D-TG-FTIR/MS-COS results revealed for the first time that the primary sequential temperature responses of gases occurred in the order: H2O/CH4 > phenols/alkanes/aromatics/alcohols > carboxylic /ketones > CO2/ethers > aldehyde groups/acetaldehyde. Subtle sequential changes even occurred within the same gases during pyrolysis. The quantity dynamics and sequential responses of gases were fitted to the combined effects of the order-based, diffusion and chemical reaction mechanisms for the component degradation. The combination of TG-FTIR-MS, Gaussian model and 2D COS is a promising approach for the online monitoring and real-time management of biomass pyrolysis, providing favorable strategies for pyrolysis optimization, by-product recovery,  generation and gas emission control in engineering and environmental applications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671238>Humic  functionalized hyperbranched polytriazine based dispersive solid-phase extraction for acaricides determination in tea matrix.</a></h1><p>Hyperbranched polytriazine functionalized with humic  was prepared and developed as new sorbents for dispersive solid-phase extraction of three acaricides (clofentezine, fenpyroximate and pyridaben) in tea samples combined with HPLC detection.

To assess the role of selected parameters that can impact ureolysis in urine, the activity of six ureolytic heterotrophs ( and ) was tested at different salinities, urea, and amino  concentrations. The interaction of the ureolytic heterotrophs with a nitrifying consortium ( ATCC 19718 and  ATCC 25931) was also tested. Lastly, microgravity was simulated in a clinostat utilizing hardware for in-flight experiments with active microbial cultures.

Here, we investigated the physiological and metabolic responses of drought-tolerant Populus simonii and drought-susceptible P. deltoides cv. 'Danhong' to drought. Under drought conditions, P. simonii grew better and had a higher photosynthetic rate than P. deltoides cv. 'Danhong'. Global untargeted metabolite profiling was analyzed using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry system. A total of 69 and 53 differentially accumulated metabolites were identified in drought-stressed P. simonii and P. deltoides cv. 'Danhong', respectively. The metabolisms of carbohydrate, amino , lipid and  were involved in the drought responses common to both poplar species. The citric  cycle was significantly inhibited to conserve , whereas multiple carbohydrates acting as osmolytes and osmoprotectants were induced to alleviate the adverse effects of drought stress. Unlike P. deltoides cv. 'Danhong', P. simonii underwent a specific metabolic reprogramming that enhanced non-enzymatic antioxidants, coordinated the cellular carbon/nitrogen balance, and regulated wax biosynthesis. These results provide a reference for characterizing the mechanisms involved in poplar response to drought and for enhancing the drought tolerance of forest trees.

The paper describes the development of an improved magnetic material with increased stability, thanks to a two-step covering of the magnetic core, for the enrichment of phosphopeptides in biological samples. Four materials were prepared featuring a polymeric shell with tunable hydrophilicity, obtained by "grafting from" polymerization of glycidyl methacrylate with 0-8.3% of polyethylene glycol methacrylate (PEGMA), the latter used to modulate the hydrophilicity of the material surface. Finally, the materials were functionalized with iminodiacetic  for Ti ion immobilization. The materials were analyzed for their composition by a combination of CHN elemental analysis and thermogravimetric analysis, also hyphenated to gas chromatography and mass spectrometric detection. Surface characteristics were evaluated by water contact angle measurements, scanning electron microscopy and  dispersive X-ray spectrometry. These materials were applied to the enrichment of phosphopeptides from yeast protein digests. Peptides were identified by proteomics techniques using nano-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and bioinformatics. Qualitatively the peptides identified by the four systems were comparable, with 1606-1693 phosphopeptide identifications and a selectivity of 47-54% for all materials. The physico-chemical features of the identified peptides were also the same for the four materials. In particular, the grand average of hydropathy index values indicated that the enriched phosphopeptides were hydrophilic (ca. 90%), and only some co-enriched non-phosphorylated peptides were hydrophobic (21-28%), regardless of the material used for enrichment. Peptides had a pI ≤ 7, which indicated a well-known bias for acidic peptides binding, attributed to the interaction with the metal center itself. The results indicated that the enrichment of phosphopeptides and the co-enrichment of non-phosphorylated peptides is mainly driven by interactions with Ti and does not depend on the amount of PEGMA chains in the polymer shell.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656522>The effects of post-partum drops in body condition on indices of  metabolism in mid-lactation Holstein cows.</a></h1><p>Evaluation of  metabolism indices in mid-lactation Holstein cows is critical to monitor health status.  The objective of this study was to assess the effects of low (≤0.75) . high (>0.75) drops in body condition score (BCS) until day 60 post-partum on  metabolism indices during mid-lactation in Holstein cows.Twenty-eight Holstein cows were included in the study from the day of calving to day 120 of lactation. Whole blood samples were taken on 60, 90, and 120 days in milk (DIM). Serum was analyzed for insulin, glucose, non-esterified fatty  (NEFA) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels.In cows with low BCS drop (LoD group), insulin did not change significantly through days 60 to 120 of lactation, but increased in high drop cows (HiD group) (P<0.001). Glucose concentrations decreased linearly in the LoD cows (P=0.039) and showed a quadratic increase in the HiD group on day 90 (P=0.028). Concentrations of non-esterified fatty  showed both linear (P=0.04) and quadratic (P=0.002) changes in the HiD group. The HiD cows had significantly higher concentrations of insulin on day 120 (P=0.017) compared to the LoD group. Glucose concentration was lower (P<0.01) in HiD cows on 60 DIM. The concentration of non-esterified fatty  was higher in HiD cows on day 90 (P<0.01). Surrogate indices of insulin resistance (calculated based on the concentrations of the measured metabolites) were different between the groups on day 90, indicating decreased insulin sensitivity in the HiD cows.Greater depletion of body reserves during early lactation may result in some inconsistencies in  metabolism during mid-lactation periods. Controlling BCS loss during early lactation may help alleviate such alterations possibly through modifying insulin sensitivity of the tissues.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668396>PAR2 controls cholesterol homeostasis and lipid metabolism in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h1><p>Increases in hepatic and plasma cholesterol occur in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), although the reason for this is not well understood. We investigated whether Protease-Activated Receptor 2 (PAR2) plays a role in cholesterol and lipid homeostasis in NAFLD.Human liver biopsies (n = 108) were quantified for PAR2 expression from NAFLD cases randomly selected and stratified by liver fibrosis stage, the primary predictor for clinical outcomes, while controlling for age, gender, and BMI between fibrosis groups. Demographic data and laboratory studies on plasma samples were obtained within 6 months of liver biopsy. Wild-type and PAR2-KO (C57BL/6 F2rl1) mice were fed either normal or high fat diet for 16 weeks and plasma and liver assayed for lipids and soluble metabolites.Severity of NAFLD and plasma cholesterol levels significantly correlated with hepatocyte PAR2 expression in NAFLD patients. Conversely, PAR2 deficiency in mice resulted in reduced expression of key hepatic genes involved in cholesterol synthesis, a 50% drop in plasma and total liver cholesterol, and induced a reverse cholesterol transport system that culminated in 25% higher fecal bile  output. PAR2-deficient mice exhibited enhanced fatty  β-oxidation with a ketogenic shift and an unexpected increase in liver glycogenesis. Mechanistic studies identified G-Jnk1/2 as key downstream effectors of protease-activated PAR2 in the regulation of lipid and cholesterol homeostasis in liver.These data indicate that PAR2 may be a new target for the suppression of plasma cholesterol and hepatic fat accumulation in NAFLD and related metabolic conditions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Low-dose antibiotics (LDA) have been widely used to enhance growth rate of pigs, providing a good animal model to study the underlying mechanism. In present study, 28 female piglets, weaned at 21 d, were randomly classified into two groups, receiving either a control diet or a diet supplemented with LDA for 4 weeks. The total bacterial load and intestinal microbiota were determined by qPCR and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. UPLC-QTRAP-MS/MS and RNA-seq were further used to determine the colonic SCFAs and transcriptomes. Results showed that LDA significantly increased growth rate and food intake. The F/B index, Methanosphaera species, and the pathway of "carbohydrate metabolism" were improved by LDA exposure, indicating the better carbohydrate degradation and  utilization. Furthermore, correlation analysis indicated the microbial community contributing to SCFAs production was enriched upon LDA exposure, associating with increased concentrations of short-chain and branched-chain fatty  (caproate, 2-methyl butyrate and 4-methyl valerate). A multivariate linear fitting model analysis highlighted that caproate was positively correlated with two genera (Faecalibacterium and Allisonella) and four differentially expressed genes (ZNF134, TBX5, NEU4 and SEMA6D), which were all significantly increased upon LDA exposure. Collectively, our study indicates that the growth-promoting effect of LDA exposure in early life is associated with the shifts of colonic microbiota to increase utilization of carbohydrates and , enhanced SCFAs production and colonic functions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

It is important to design probes with good fluorescence and two-photon (TP) active cross-sections (Φ) to explore the concentration distribution of Ca. In this manuscript, a novel TP fluorescence calcium probe (BAPTAVP) with positive charges, based on the classical Ca indicator of BAPTA (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane--tetra acetic ), and a conjugated polymer (PCBMB) with negative charges were designed and synthesized. The results from transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and the zeta potential (ZP) showed that nanoparticles were obtained by the self-assembly of PCBMB and BAPTAVP. Moreover, the fluorescence properties of BAPTAVP were effectively improved by fluorescence resonance  transfer (FRET) with PCBMB and attenuating the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) after the addition of Ca. The quantum yield and Φ of PCBMB-BAPTAVP increased by about four and six times in comparison to those of BAPTAVP, respectively. The TP fluorescence imaging experiments indicated that the PCBMB-BAPTAVP system could effectively detect Ca in living cells with high sensitivity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664750>Unconventional Route to Oxygen Vacancies-Enabled Highly Efficient Electron Extraction and Transport in Perovskite Solar Cells.</a></h1><p>The ability to effectively transfer photoexcited electrons and holes represents an important endeavor toward achieving high-efficiency solar  conversion. Herein, we develop a simple yet robust -treatment strategy to judiciously create an amorphous TiO 2 buffer layer intimately situated on the anatase TiO 2 surface as electron transport layer (ETL) for efficient electron transport. The facile  treatment is capable of weakening the bonding of zigzag octahedral chains in anatase TiO 2 , thereby shortening staggered octahedron chains to form an amorphous buffer layer on the anatase TiO 2 surface. Such amorphous TiO 2 -coated ETL possesses an increased electron density due to the presence of oxygen vacancies, leading to efficient electron transfer from perovskite to TiO 2 . Compared to pristine TiO 2 -based devices, the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with -treated TiO 2 ETL exhibit enhanced short circuit current and power conversion efficiency. These findings demonstrate an unconventional route to crafting effective ETLs by deliberately creating an intimate, tailored amorphous semiconductor buffer layer for high-performance PSCs. This study may provide insights into the importance of rational design of efficient electron transporting layers in PSCs.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, for hypermetabolic conditions stemming from burn trauma or cancer cachexia, browning is thought to contribute to  wasting and supraphysiological nutritional requirements. Metformin's impact on this phenomenon and underlying mechanisms have not been explored.We used both a murine burn model and human ex vivo adipose explants to assess metformin and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR)'s effects on the development of subcutaneous beige adipose. Enzymes involved in fat homeostasis and browning, as well as mitochondrial dynamics, were assessed to determine metformin's effects.Treatment with the biguanide metformin lowers lipolysis in beige fat by inducing protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) independently of adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) activation. Increased PP2A activity catalyzes the dephosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Ser 79) and hormone sensitive lipase (Ser 660), thus promoting fat storage and the "whitening" of otherwise lipolytic beige adipocytes. Moreover, co-incubation of metformin with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic  countered the anti-lipolytic effects of this biguanide in human adipose. Additionally, we show that metformin does not activate this pathway in the WAT of control mice and that AICAR sustains the browning of white adipose, offering further evidence that metformin acts independently of this cellular  sensor.This work provides novel insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of metformin's therapeutic benefits and potential as an agent to reduce the lipotoxicity associated with hypermetabolism and adipose browning.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

These products are widely produced by spontaneous fermentation using of cereal grains as raw material. They have a unique taste and flavour, are rich sources of  and their non-alcoholic nature makes them ideal for consumption by the entire population, including children. Lactic  bacteria dominate the fermentation process and lead to a low pH of around 4, which suppresses the growth of pathogenic bacteria, thereby increasing the shelf-life and safety of the food. Knowledge about processing practices, consumption patterns and bacterial communities is essential to regulate processing and design appropriate mixes of micro-organisms to produce starter cultures for commercial production of standard-quality fermented foods that meet desired quality characteristics. In four regions of Zambia, we surveyed processing practices and consumption patterns of a spontaneously fermented cereal-based beverage called Munkoyo, commonly produced in Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Variations in processing practices exist in cooking time of the unfermented maize porridge and time allowed for fermentation. Consumption is mainly at household level and the product is considered as an  drink. Characterisation of the bacterial communities of over 90 samples with 16S amplicon sequencing on DNA extracted from the entire bacterial community revealed six dominant families, namely Streptococcaceae, Leuconostocaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Lactabacillales, Bacillaceae and Aeromonadaceae, and a Shannon index of up to 1.18 with an effective number of 3.44 bacterial species. Bacterial communities that underlie the fermentation in Munkoyo differ in their composition for the different regions using common processing steps, suggesting that different combinations of bacteria can be used to achieve successful Munkoyo fermentation. Analysis of aroma profiles in 15 different samples from two different Provinces showed that aldehydes, esters, organic , alkanes, alkenes and alcohols dominated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672442>Active pyruvate dehydrogenase and impaired gluconeogenesis in orthotopic hepatomas of rats.</a></h1><p>Therapies targeting altered activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and pyruvate carboxylase (PC) have been proposed for hepatomas. However, the activities of these pathways in hepatomas in vivo have not been distinguished. Here we examined pyruvate entry into the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle through PDH versus PC in vivo using hepatoma-bearing rats.Hepatoma-bearing rats were generated by intrahepatic injection of H4IIE cells. Metabolism of C-labeled glycerol, a physiological substrate for both gluconeogenesis and  production, was measured with C NMR analysis. The concentration of key metabolites and the expression of relevant enzymes were measured in hepatoma, surrounding liver, and normal liver.In orthotopic hepatomas, pyruvate entry into the TCA cycle occurred exclusively through PDH and the excess PDH activity compared to normal liver was attributed to downregulated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) 2/4. However, pyruvate carboxylation via PC and gluconeogenesis were minimal, which was linked to downregulated forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) by Akt activity. In contrast to many studies of cancer metabolism, lactate production in hepatomas was not increased which corresponded to reduced expression of lactate dehydrogenase. The production of serine and glycine in hepatomas was enhanced, but glycine decarboxylase was downregulated.The combination of [U-C]glycerol and NMR analysis enabled investigation of multiple biochemical processes in hepatomas and surrounding liver. We demonstrated active PDH and other related metabolic alterations in orthotopic hepatomas that differed substantially not only from the host organ but also from many earlier studies with cancer cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we adopted an approach based on direct observation of symbiotic or axenic flies feeding on dishes seeded with drops of full diet (containing all amino ) or full diet supplemented with bacteria at similar concentrations to explore the effects of intestinal bacteria on foraging decision and fitness of Bactrocera dorsalis.The results show that intestinal probiotics elicit beneficial foraging decision and enhance the female reproduction fitness and survival of B. dorsalis (symbiotic and axenic), yet preferences for probiotic diets were significantly higher in axenic flies to which they responded faster compared to full diet. Moreover, females fed diet supplemented with Pantoea dispersa and Enterobacter cloacae laid more eggs but had shorter lifespan while female fed Enterococcus faecalis and Klebsiella oxytoca enriched diets lived longer but had lower fecundity compared to the positive control. Conversely, flies fed sugar diet (negative control) were not able to produce eggs, but lived longer than those from the positive control.These results suggest that intestinal bacteria can drive the foraging decision in a way which promotes the reproduction and survival of B. dorsalis. Our data highlight the potentials of gut bacterial isolates to control the foraging behavior of the fly and empower the sterile insect technique (SIT) program through the mass rearing.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654134>Copper-induced synthesis of palladium/copper popcorn nanoparticles as sensors for differential pulse voltammetric determination of dopamine.</a></h1><p>Popcorn nanoparticles (pop-NPs) consisting of a Pd/Cu alloy were synthesized using a seed-mediated growth method.

The same synthesis method with a reduced volume of the Cu(II) salt leads to Pd/Cu alloy nanoparticles with branches (br-NPs). Large Pd nanocubes (Pd NCs) were prepared via epitaxial deposition and using tetrachloropalladate (PdCl) only. The high-resolution TEM analysis results show the pop-NPs and br-NPs to be single crystals with [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] planes, respectively. The results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry measurements corroborated that Pd is enriched on both surfaces.

We also aimed to examine the relationship between nutrient intakes and knee OA severity.One hundred female participants with symptomatic primary knee OA were matched for age with 100 apparently healthy females and were sequentially recruited from the Orthopaedics Department, Faculty of Medicine, King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Saudi Arabia, in a case-control study design. Radiographic disease severity of OA was assessed by the Kellgren-Lawrence grading system. Symptomatic severity was evaluated according to the Western Ontario McMaster University Osteoarthritis scores. Dietary intake was assessed using a prevalidated food frequency questionnaire. The DAQ score was calculated considering the risk of an inadequate intake (<2/3 reference nutrient intake) for selenium, zinc, vitamins A, C and E.A higher intake of saturated fatty  [15.4 (0.3) as a mean (SD) percentage of  supplied] and monounsaturated fatty  [16.6 (0.2) as a percentage of  supplied] than the recommendations was evident among the study population. OA patients consume less antioxidants than non-OA subjects as determined by their DAQ score [8.41 (0.1) versus 9.17 (0.1), P < 0.0001]. After adjusting for potential confounders, DAQ score, and monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty , most of the micronutrient intakes were found to be negatively associated with the prevalence of radiographic knee OA.Dietary antioxidants could be implicated in the development and progression of knee OA.

S components rotate within the membrane to expose their binding pockets alternately to the exterior and the cytoplasm. In contrast to vitamin transporters, metal-specific systems rely on additional proteins with essential but poorly understood functions. CbiN, a membrane protein composed of two transmembrane helices tethered by an extracytoplasmic loop of 37 amino- residues represents the auxiliary component that temporarily interacts with the CbiMQO Co transporter. CbiN was previously shown to induce significant Co transport activity in the absence of CbiQO in cells producing the S component CbiM plus CbiN or a Cbi(MN) fusion. Here we analyzed the mode of interaction between the two protein domains. Any deletion in the CbiN loop abolished transport activity. In silico predicted protein-protein contacts between segments of the CbiN loop and loops in CbiM were confirmed by cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and crosslinking. Likewise, an ordered structure of the CbiN loop was observed by electron paramagnetic resonance analysis after site-directed spin labeling. The N-terminal loop of CbiM containing three of four metal ligands was partially immobilized in wild-type Cbi(MN) but completely immobile in inactive variants with CbiN loop deletions. Decreased dynamics of the inactive form was also detected by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance of isotope-labeled protein in proteoliposomes. In conclusion, CbiM-CbiN loop-loop interactions facilitate metal insertion into the binding pocket.Copyright © 2019.

The mutations in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) causing its misfolding and aggregation are found linked to the motor neuron disorder, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Since the mutations are scattered throughout SOD1 structure, determining the exact molecular mechanism underlying the ALS pathology remains unresolved. In this study, we have investigated the major molecular factors that mainly contribute to SOD1 destabilization, intrinsic disorder, and misfolding using sequence and structural information. We have analysed 153 ALS causing SOD1 point mutants for aggregation tendency using four different aggregation prediction tools, viz., Aggrescan3D (A3D), CamSol, GAP and Zyggregator. Our results suggest that 74-79 mutants are susceptible to aggregation, due to distorted native interactions originated at the mutation site. Majority of the aggregation prone mutants are located in the buried regions of SOD1 molecule. Further, the mutations at the hydrophobic amino  primarily promote the aggregation tendency of SOD1 protein through different destabilizing mechanisms including changes in hydrophobic free , loss of electrostatic interactions in the protein's surface and loss of hydrogen bonds that bridges the protein core and surface.Copyright © 2019.

Featuring unique physical microenvironment, the tumor microenvironment (TME) provides a new research direction for designing more efficient and safer treatment paradigm. In this study, we fabricated a polydopamine (PDA)-based TME-responsive nanosystem, which successfully integrate glucose degradation, Fenton reaction and photothermal therapy for efficient cancer therapy. Through a convenient hydrothermal method, Fe2+ doped Fe(Ⅱ)-PDA nanoparticle was successfully fabricated, which shows excellent photothermal effect and interesting reactivity for Fenton reaction. Instead of introducing of toxic anticancer agents, natural glucose oxidase (GOD) was grafted on the Fe(Ⅱ)-PDA, forming a cascade catalytic nanomedicine for specific response to the glucose in TME. The GOD grafted on the Fe(Ⅱ)-PDA-GOD is ought to catalyze rich glucose in TME into gluconic  and H2O2. The concomitant generation of H2O2 can enhance the efficiency of sequential Fenton reaction, producing abundant hydroxyl radicals (OH) for cancer therapy. Besides, the extra consumption of intratumoral glucose also could inhibit tumor growth by reducing the  supply. Taken together, the in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor studies of such TME-based Fe(Ⅱ)-PDA-GOD nanosystems displayed a favorable synergistic potency of glucose degradation, Fenton reaction and photothermal therapy against tumor growth.

The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of supplementing SFA in the form of triglycerides (TSFA), as compared to CSFA, on yields, efficiency and diet digestibility in high-yielding dairy cows. Twenty-eight (14 cows in each group) multiparous cows were fed a basal diet supplemented (on DM basis) with either 12 g/kg TSFA (~350 g/cow per day - contained 980 g/kg fat; 882.3 g/kg SFAs) or 14 g/kg CSFA (~440 g/cow per day - contained 800 g/kg fat; 566.4 g/kg SFAs). The supplement amounts in the diet were balanced according to fat content. Rumen samples were taken for measurements of ammonia and volatile fatty  concentrations, and fecal samples were taken for digestibility measurements. The CSFA cows produced 3% higher milk yields (47.6 v. 46.2 kg/day; P < 0.0001) and 4.7% higher 4% fat-corrected milk (FCM; 44.7 v. 42.7 kg/day; P = 0.02) than the TSFA cows. No difference in milk-fat content was observed, but milk-protein content was higher in the TSFA than CSFA cows. Yields of fat and protein were similar, but lactose yields were higher in TSFA cows. There were no differences in dry matter intake or efficiency calculations between groups. The ruminal ammonia concentrations were similar between groups, whereas acetate concentrations and acetate : propionate ratio were greater for CSFA than TSFA cows. The apparent total-tract digestibility of dry (P < 0.0007) and organic matters (P < 0.0003), fat (P < 0.0001), NDF and ADF (P = 0.02) were lower in the TSFA v. CSFA cows. In conclusion, the CSFA-supplemented cows produced 3% higher milk and 4.7% higher 4% FCM than the TSFA cows. However, TSFA supplementation did not depress milk-protein content. The apparent total-tract digestibility was lower for all dietary components in the TSFA cows, which was probably due to the effects of both degree of saturation and triglyceride form of the TSFA supplement. Considering that diets were balanced according to the fat content of the supplements, the lower yields of milk and FCM observed in the TSFA than CSFA cows were likely due to the lower digestibility of the fat and other nutrients in the TSFA cows, which might have negatively influenced the dietary  content.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669707>Regulation of metabolism during hibernation in brown bears (Ursus arctos): Involvement of cortisol, PGC-1α and AMPK in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle.</a></h1><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate changes in expression of known cellular regulators of metabolism during hyperphagia (Sept) and hibernation (Jan) in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue of brown bears and determine whether signaling molecules and transcription factors known to respond to changes in cellular  state are involved in the regulation of these metabolic adaptations. During hibernation, serum levels of cortisol, glycerol, and triglycerides were elevated, and protein expression and activation of AMPK in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue were reduced. mRNA expression of the co-activator PGC-1α was reduced in all tissues in hibernation whereas mRNA expression of the transcription factor PPAR-α was reduced in the vastus lateralis muscle and adipose tissue only. During hibernation, gene expression of ATGL and CD36 was not altered; however, HSL gene expression was reduced in adipose tissue. During hibernation gene expression of the lipogenic enzyme DGAT in all tissues and the expression of the FA oxidative enzyme LCAD in the vastus lateralis muscle were reduced. Gene and protein expression of the glucose transporter GLUT4 was decreased in adipose tissue in hibernation. Our data suggest that high cortisol levels are a key adaptation during hibernation and link cortisol to a reduced activation of the AMPK/PGC-1α/PPAR-α axis in the regulation of metabolism in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Moreover, our results indicate that during this phase of hibernation at a time when metabolic rate is significantly reduced metabolic adaptations in peripheral tissues seek to limit the detrimental effects of unduly large  dissipation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Protein phosphorylation carries out an important regulatory function in plant defense responses, while the global phosphoproteome changes in rice response to SA-mediated defense response has not been reported. In this study, a comparative phosphoproteomic profiling was conducted by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, with two near-isogenic rice cultivars after SA treatment.Thirty-seven phosphoprotein spots were differentially expressed after SA treatment, twenty-nine of which were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS, belonging to nine functional categories. Phosphoproteins involved in photosynthesis, antioxidative enzymes, molecular chaperones were similarly expressed in the two cultivars, suggesting SA might alleviate decreases in plant photosynthesis, regulate the antioxidant defense activities, thus improving basal resistance response in both cultivars. Meanwhile, phosphoproteins related to defense, carbohydrate metabolism, protein synthesis and degradation were differentially expressed, suggesting phosphorylation regulation mediated by SA may coordinate complex cellular activities in the two cultivars. Furthermore, the phosphorylation sites of four identified phosphoproteins were verified by NanoLC-MS/MS, and phosphorylated regulation of three enzymes (cinnamoyl-CoA reductase, phosphoglycerate mutase and ascorbate peroxidase) was validated by activity determination.Our study suggested that phosphorylation regulation mediated by SA may contribute to the different resistance response of the two cultivars. To our knowledge, this is the first report to measure rice phosphoproteomic changes in response to SA, which provides new insights into molecular mechanisms of SA-induced rice defense.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671941>Determination of surface  parameters of hydrophilic porous membranes via a corrected contact angle approach.</a></h1><p>While contact angle is a well applied indicator of membrane hydrophobicity and surface , the interference of surface roughness and porosity in contact angle measurement and surface  calculation has been long neglected in the field of porous membrane study. We propose an improved method to straightforwardly derive the surface  of porous membrane from contact angles with the interference effect corrected. A linearized model was established combining the Young-Dupré and Cassie-Baxter equations, from which the surface  (Lifshitz-van der Waals and Lewis /base components) and roughness index (surface area difference) can be solved simultaneously at a given porosity using contact angles measured with a set of standard polar/nonpolar test liquids. The model solution was examined using hydrophilic microfiltration membranes with different pore morphologies (including perforated plate-like PCTE, irregular particulate bed-like PVDF and fibrous mesh-like PTFE membranes), with the robustness of the results evaluated via Monte Carlo simulation. In comparison with the verified results of the model solution, it was found that the Lifshitz-van der Waals, Lewis  and base  values for the tested membranes would deviate by 50-87%, 30-160% and 52-97% respectively if surface roughness and porosity were neglected in the calculation. The profound effect of roughness and porosity on surface  determination was further confirmed via theoretical analysis of the Young-Dupré and Cassie-Baxter relationships. This improved approach may apply to the surface  characterization of hydrophilic rough porous membranes (e.g. hydrophilic microfiltration membranes).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657548>In Silico Design of Novel Mutant Anti-MUC1 Aptamers for Targeted Cancer Therapy.</a></h1><p>The transmembrane glycoprotein mucin 1 (MUC1) is an attractive tumor marker for cancer therapy and diagnosis. The nine amino  extracellular epitope APDTRPAPG of this protein is selectively recognized by the S2.2 single-stranded DNA anti-MUC1 aptamer, which has emerged as a promising template for designing novel targeting agents for MUC1-directed therapy. In this work, 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, MM/GBSA binding free  calculations, and conformational analysis were employed to propose a novel prospective anti-MUC1 aptamer with increased affinity towards the MUC1 epitope resulting from the double mutation of the T11 and T12 residues with PSU and U nucleosides, respectively. The double mutant aptamer exhibits a tight interaction with the MUC1 epitope and adopts a groove conformation that structurally favors the intermolecular contact with the epitope through the intermediate T11-A18 region leaving the 3´and 5´ends free for further chemical conjugation with a nanocarrier or pharmaceutical. These results are valuable to gain understanding about the molecular features governing aptamer-epitope interactions and constitute a first key step for the design of novel aptamer-based nanocarriers for MUC1-targeted cancer therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669471>Sensitive glycoprofiling of insulin-like growth factor receptors isolated from colon tissue of patients with colorectal carcinoma using lectin-based protein microarray.</a></h1><p>Glycosylation of cell receptors influences their function and development of tumour induces changes in glycosylation. Cell growth depends on the activation of receptors which bind growth factors and the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptors are among the most important ones. Usually, only small quantities of isolated receptors are available thus there is a need of suitable assay to study receptors glycosylation. Therefore, we developed a lectin-based reverse-phase protein microarray method for screening the glycosylation pattern of receptors in picomolar (pM) concentrations. The method was applied to glycoprofile IGF1 and IGF2 receptors and the solubilised membrane proteins isolated from tumour and non-tumour colon tissue of patients with colorectal cancer. We found that common to both receptors was partial overlapping of the major glycan structures with those present in the entire glycome of membrane proteins. In contrast, receptors possess higher level of α2,3 sialic  residues and lower level of tri-/tetra-antennary complex type N-glycans and terminal mannose in high-mannose structures. Increased levels of fucosylation and branched mannose structures were observed in both receptors derived from tumour tissue compared to non-tumour tissue. The described method enabling glycan analysis of receptors has a big application potential in e.g. biomarker research, biology and diagnostics.Copyright © 2019.

The XPS analysis of elements and their chemical states at the surface of MNPs and f-MNPs revealed differences in chemical bonding of atoms, content of carbon-oxygen groups, iron oxide forms, iron oxide magnetic properties, adsorbed molecules, surface coverage, and overlayer thickness, whereas the Auger parameters (derived from XPS and Auger spectra) and elastic and inelastic scattering probabilities of electrons on atoms and valence band electrons (derived from REELS spectra) indicated modification of surface charge redistribution, electronic, and optical properties. These modified properties of f-MNPs influenced their biological properties. The surfaces biocompatible for L929 cells showed various cytotoxicity for HeLa cells (10.8-5.3% of cell death), the highest for MNPs functionalized with oxalic . The samples exhibiting the largest efficiency possessed smaller surface coverage and thickness of adsorbed molecules layers, the highest content of oxygen and carbon-oxygen functionalizing groups, the highest ratio of lattice O and OH to C sp hybridizations on MNP surface, the highest ratio of adsorbed O and OH to C sp hybridizations on adsorbed molecule layers, the closest electronic and optical properties to FeO, and the lowest degree of admolecule polymerization. This high cytotoxicity was attributed to interaction of cells with a surface, where increased content of oxygen groups, adsorbed O, and OH may play the role of additional adsorption and catalytic sites and a large content of adsorbed molecule layers of carboxylic groups facilitating Fenton reaction kinetics leading to cell damage.Copyright © 2019 Lesiak, Rangam, Jiricek, Gordeev, Tóth, Kövér, Mohai and Borowicz.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636304>A new method for biological synthesis of agriculturally relevant nanohydroxyapatite with elucidated effects on soil bacteria.</a></h1><p>The study describes a novel and environment friendly route of biosynthesis of nanohydroxyapatite (nHAP).

The composition, chain conformation and rheological properties were investigated. PPS mainly consisted of arabinose, galacturonic , xylose, and rhamnose. The intrinsic viscosity [η] was 0.71 dL/g in 0.1 M NaNO solution. The weight-average molar mass Mw and polydispersity index were 3.77 × 10 g/mol and 1.25, suggesting high homogeneity. The average radius of gyration (R), hydrodynamic radius (R), R/R ratio and conformation parameter v were 25.5, 18.2, 1.40 and 0.21, respectively, indicating compact coil chain conformation with branched structure. Molecular morphology revealed that PPS displayed chain shape comprised of spheres with a diameter range of 15-50 nm and apparent length of chains mainly ranged from 100 to 300 nm. The aggregation caused by molecular self-association enhanced with concentration increasing. Additionally, Newtonian behavior was observed at various concentrations.

The biosynthetic machinery responsible for the production of these secondary metabolites (SMs) (also called natural products) is often encoded by collocated groups of genes called biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). High-throughput genome sequencing of both isolates and metagenomic samples combined with the development of specialized computational workflows is enabling systematic identification of BGCs and the discovery of novel SMs. In order to advance exploration of microbial secondary metabolism and its diversity, we developed the largest publicly available database of predicted BGCs combined with experimentally verified BGCs, the Integrated Microbial Genomes Atlas of Biosynthetic gene Clusters (IMG-ABC) (https://img.jgi.doe.gov/abc-public).

Here, 5-ALA-loaded hyaluronic  dissolving microneedles (5-ALA@HAMNs) are prepared for photodynamic therapy of superficial tumors. The HAMNs can not only assist the loaded 5-ALA to effectively penetrate the stratum corneum but also provide 5-ALA with an acidic and oxygen-free environment to reduce the dimerization of 5-ALA molecules via Schiff-base bonds and formation of inactive pyrazine derivatives, thus maintaining its chemical structure and biological activity. The chemical stability of 5-ALA in HAMNs is confirmed by UV-vis spectra and mass spectra measurements. The 5-ALA@HAMNs display remarkable tumor elimination both in vitro and in vivo, even after storage at room temperature for nine months, making it a highly potential device for effective delivery of 5-ALA in cancer photodynamic therapy.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Adipose tissue is a vital metabolic organ in  balance and glucose homeostasis. In this study, we investigated the role of VDR expressed on adipose tissue in the balance of  metabolism. This study was conducted in VDR-KO mice, VDR-Tg mice and wild-type mice.  metabolism was determined based on the  expenditure, oxygen consumption, respiratory exchange rate, food and water intake, and a cool room test. VDR expression in the tissues of VDR-Tg mice was assessed by western blotting. The levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty , leptin, and glucose were assessed using the respective kits. Insulin resistance in the whole body was evaluated by an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance test. mRNA associated with  metabolism expression in adipose and skeletal muscle tissue was examined by RT-PCR. Our results show that overexpression of VDR in adipose tissue induced an increase in body weight, fat mass, and serum lipid levels, and a decline in  metabolism; these changes were ameliorated by VDR-KO mice. Overexpression of VDR in the adipose tissue of VDR-Tg mice induced a state of insulin resistance, which corresponded with decreased expression of UCP1, UCP2, UCP3, CPT2 and HK in both white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue; these changes were also reversed by VDR-KO mice.

The purpose of the study was to test the hypothesis that improvements in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function induced by AET observed in previous literature would persist when measured after restoring EB conditions 72 hours removed from the last exercise bout.Participants were 14 premenopausal women (age = 31.2 ± 6.7 years, BMI = 26.6 ± 5.1 kg/m). The AET program required 3 monitored training sessions per week for 8-16 weeks. Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained at baseline and following 8-16 weeks of AET (≥72 hrs after the last exercise bout). All food was provided for 72 hours prior to biopsies and EB was managed 24 hours prior to testing within ±100 kcal of measured  requirements using a whole-room calorimeter. Mitochondrial oxidative capacity was quantified in permeabilized muscle fibers from the vastus lateralis.We found that AET increased coupled respiration (154%) and uncoupled respiration (90%) rates using a fatty  substrate (palmitoyl carnitine) (P<0.05). However, when rates were normalized to complex IV activity (a marker of mitochondrial content), no significant differences were observed.

In this study, the use of a 16mm twin screw extruder (TSE) as a platform technology for solid feeds is investigated using four solid pharmaceutical ingredients (PI) in a mixture of water and IPA. In order for comparison, the same experiments were also carried out in a batch traditional stirred tank vessel (STV). The objectives of this work are to gain further scientific understanding on dissolution kinetics and to compare kinetics in both a batch and continuous system. The concentration of each PI during dissolution is monitored using an in-line UV-ATR probe, allowing the extraction of dissolution kinetics. Faster dissolution rates are achieved in the TSE than in the STV due to higher power dissipation generated by the aggressive shear mixing and thermal  within the TSE.

A challenge for triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC) processes is to realize these features in solid materials without undesired phase segregation and detrimental dye aggregation. To achieve this, we combine a palladium porphyrin sensitizer and a 9,10-diphenylanthracene annihilator within a crystalline mesoporous metal-organic framework using an inverted design. In this modular TTA system, the framework walls constitute the fixed sensitizer, while caprylic  coats the channels providing a solvent-like environment for the mobile annihilator in the channel.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) comprise <0.1% of the tumor bulk and possess high self-renewal, tumor initiating properties, and are responsible for therapeutic resistance, disease recurrence, and tumor metastasis. Hence, it is imperative to understand the metabolic rewiring occurring in CSCs, especially their lipid metabolism, on which there have been recent reports. CSCs rely highly upon lipid metabolism for maintaining their stemness properties and fulfilling their biomass and  demands, ultimately leading to cancer growth and invasion. Hence, in this review we will shed light on the aberrant lipid metabolism that CSCs exploit to boost their survival, which comprises upregulation in de novo lipogenesis, lipid droplet synthesis, lipid desaturation, and β-oxidation. Furthermore, the metabolic regulators involved in the process, such as key lipogenic enzymes, are also highlighted. Finally, we also summarize the therapeutic strategies targeting the key regulators involved in CSCs' lipid metabolism, which thereby demonstrates the potential to develop powerful and novel therapeutics against the CSC lipid metabolome.

To assess the underlying mechanism of the lipodystrophy in homozygous mice (Bcs1l), these and wild-type control mice were subjected to a short 4-hour fast. The homozygotes had low baseline blood glucose values, but a similar decrease in response to fasting as in wild-type mice, resulting in hypoglycemia in the majority. Despite the already depleted glycogen and increased triacylglycerol content in the mutant livers, the mice responded to fasting by further depletion and increase, respectively. Increased plasma free fatty  (FAs) upon fasting suggested normal capacity for mobilization of lipids from white adipose tissue into circulation. Strikingly, however, serum glycerol concentration was not increased concomitantly with free FAs, suggesting its rapid uptake into the liver and utilization for fuel or gluconeogenesis in the mutants. The mutant hepatocyte mitochondria were capable of responding to fasting by appropriate morphological changes, as analyzed by electron microscopy, and by increasing respiration. Mutants showed increased hepatic gene expression of major metabolic controllers typically associated with fasting response (Ppargc1a, Fgf21, Cd36) already in the fed state, suggesting a chronic starvation-like metabolic condition. Despite this, the mutant mice responded largely normally to fasting by increasing hepatic respiration and switching to FA utilization, indicating that the mechanisms driving these adaptations are not compromised by the CIII dysfunction.

In the present study, proteomic analyses were performed for leaf samples from control (healthy) and susceptible BCMV infected plants. The differential expression of proteins was evaluated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). Approximately, 1098 proteins were spotted, amongst which 107 proteins were observed to be statistically significant with differential expression. The functional categorization of the differential proteins illustrated that they were involved in biotic/abiotic stress (18%),  and carbon metabolism (11%), photosynthesis (46%), protein biosynthesis (10%), chaperoning (5%), chlorophyll (5%) and polyunsaturated fatty  biosynthesis (5%). This is the first report on the comparative proteome study of compatible plant-BCMV interactions in P. vulgaris which contributes largely to the understanding of protein-mediated disease resistance/susceptible mechanisms.Copyright © 2019.

Polyphenolic plant derivatives have been shown to alleviate such pathological features and have been used in models of neurodegenerative disorders in previous reports. In the current study, we utilized a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned rat model of PD to explore the protective efficacy of polyphenolic phytochemical ferulic  (FA) against mitochondrial dysfunction and explored its effect on gene and protein expression of mitochondrial dynamics regulators dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)/mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) in lesioned animals. We also evaluated its effect on expression of mitochondrial biogenesis regulator PGC1α and apoptotic regulators BAX, cyt c, p53, and cleaved PARP. We found that oral FA supplementation alleviated 6-OHDA induced oxidative stress, DNA fragmentation, morphological changes, and blocked apoptotic cascade. FA also reduced mitochondrial Drp1 expression and increased gene and protein expression of PGC1α, thereby regulating expression of its downstream target Mfn2 and restoring mitochondrial dynamics in lesioned animals. Our data suggest that targeting mitochondrial dynamics through modulation of PGC1α can prove to be a potent preventive strategy against PD pathology.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655930>Fluorometric visualization of mucin 1 glycans on cell surfaces based on rolling-mediated cascade amplification and CdTe quantum dots.</a></h1><p>A rolling-mediated cascade (RMC) amplification strategy is described for improved visualization of profiling glycans of mucin 1 (MUC 1) on cell surfaces. CdTe quantum dots (QDs) are used as fluorescent labels. The RMC based amplification allows even distinct glycoforms of MUC1 to be visualized on the surface of MCF-7 cell via an amplified Förster resonance  transfer (FRET) imaging strategy that works at excitation/emission wavelengths of 345/610 nm. This is achieved by utilizing antibody against MUC1 modified with the fluorescent label 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic  (AMCA) as the  donor in FRET. The QDs (used to label surface glycans) act as acceptors. N-Azidoacetylgalactosamine-Acetylated (Ac4GalNAz) as a non-natural azido sugar, can be incorporated into the glycans of the cell surface, which can promote further labeling. The method has the advantage of only requiring a small amount of non-natural sugar to be introduced in metabolic glycan labeling since too much of an artificial sugar will interfere with the physiological functions of cells.

We are investigating a hydrocarbon pathway from mixed sugars via 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) and furfural intermediates. To achieve this goal, we must first convert glucose and xylose to HMF and furfural in favorable yields. Current processes to produce HMF/furfural generally involve the use of  catalysts in biphasic systems or solvents such as ionic liquids. However, the yield from transforming glucose to HMF is lower than the yield of furfural from xylose.In this study, we present an efficient chemical pathway simultaneously transforming glucose and xylose to HMF and furfural via ketose intermediates, i.e., fructose and xylulose, which were generated from glucose and xylose via enzymatic isomerization. In the enzymatic isomerization, by adding sodium borate to complex with the ketoses, xylose conversion reached equilibrium after 2 h with a conversion of 91% and glucose conversion reached 84% after 4 h. By enzymatically isomerizing the aldoses to ketoses, the following dehydration reactions to HMF and furfural could be performed at low process temperatures (i.e., 110-120 °C) minimizing the side reactions of the sugars and limiting the degradation of furfurals to humins and carboxylic . At 120 °C, pH 0.5, and 15 min reaction time, mixed ketose sugars were converted to HMF and furfural in yields of 77% and 96%, respectively (based on starting aldose concentrations).Taken together, our results demonstrate that this combined biological and chemical process could be an effective pathway to simultaneously convert biomass-derived glucose and xylose to HMF and furfural, for use as intermediates in the production of hydrocarbons.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633875>The displacement study of  Tc-DTPA-Human serum albumin binding in presence of furosemide and metformin by using equilibrium dialysis and molecular docking.</a></h1><p>The  Tc-DTPA (Technetium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic ), is a radiopharmaceutical used in renal scintigraphy.

Anaerobic processes are suitable for the treatment of wastewater high in organics to achieve pollution control and recovery of  as methane and hydrogen, or intermediates for production of biofuels and valuable biochemicals. A distinction between protein hydrolysis and amino  fermentation, especially for dissolved proteins, is needed to target which one is truly rate-limiting and to effectively harvest bioproducts during anaerobic conversion of these wastewaters. This study explored mesophilic anaerobic hydrolysis and amino  fermentation of gelatine, as a model for dissolved proteins, at pH 7 and at pH 5.The results showed that at pH 7, protein hydrolysis (first-order rate of 0.15 h) was approximately 5 times faster than acidification of the hydrolysis products (first-order rate of 0.03 h), implying that not hydrolysis but acidification was the rate-limiting step in anaerobic dissolved protein degradation. This was confirmed by (temporary) accumulation of amino . Nineteen different amino  were detected during the first 8 incubation hours of gelatine at neutral pH and the total chemical oxygen demand (COD) of these 19 amino  was up to approximately 40% of the COD of the gelatine that was added. Protein hydrolysis at pH 5 was 2-25 times slower than at pH 7. Shifting the initial pH from neutral to acidic conditions (pH 5) inhibited protein degradation and changed the volatile fatty  (VFA) product profile. Furthermore, the presence or absence of methanogenic activity did not affect the rates of protein hydrolysis and acidification.The findings in this study can help to set a suitable solid retention time to accomplish anaerobic degradation of protein-rich wastewaters in continuous reactor systems. For example, if the target is harvesting VFAs, methanogens can be washed-out for a shorter retention time while amino  fermentation, instead of hydrolysis as assumed previously, will govern the design and solutions to improve the system dealing with dissolved proteins.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662435>Structural comparisons of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinases reveal the evolutionary trajectories of these phosphodiester -conversion enzymes.</a></h1><p>Inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) consists of two phosphate molecules and can act as an  and phosphate donor in cellular reactions similar to ATP. Several kinases use PPi as a substrate and these kinases have recently been suggested to have evolved from ATP-dependent functional homologs, which have significant amino  sequence similarity to PPi-utilizing enzymes. In contrast, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) can be divided into three types according to the phosphate donor (ATP, GTP, or PPi), and the amino  sequence similarity of these PEPCKs is too low to confirm that they share a common ancestor. Here, we solved the crystal structure of a PPi-PEPCK homolog from the bacterium Actinomyces israelii (AiPEPCK) at 2.6 Å resolution and compared it with previously reported structures from ATP- and GTP-specific PEPCKs to assess the degrees of similarities and divergences among these PEPCKs and to determine the structural basis for the PPi specificity of PPi-type PEPCKs. These comparisons revealed that the amino  residues directly contributing to substrate recognition, except for those that recognize purine moieties, are conserved. Furthermore, the order of secondary structure elements between PPi-, ATP- and GTP-specific PEPCKs was strictly conserved. The structure-based comparisons of the three PEPCK types provide key insights into the structural basis for PPi specificity and suggest that all of these PEPCKs are derived from a common ancestor.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666479>Diosgenin Supplementation Prevents Lipid Accumulation and Induces Skeletal Muscle-Fiber Hypertrophy in Rats.</a></h1><p>Diosgenin (Dio) is a steroid sapogenin found in plants such as Dioscorea species, and is recognized as a phytochemical against various disorders as well as a natural precursor of steroidal drugs. The present study used rats fed high-cholesterol (Chol) diets supplemented with or without 0.5% Dio for 6 wk to investigate the effects of dietary Dio on lipid metabolism. Dio supplementation significantly increased serum high-density lipoprotein Chol concentrations and fecal Chol content, and significantly decreased fecal bile  content compared rats fed a high-Chol diet alone, showing that dietary Dio may facilitate excretion of Chol rather than bile . A reduction in the liver triglyceride content and intra-abdominal visceral fat was observed in Dio-supplemented rats. Interestingly, dietary Dio also significantly increased the skeletal muscle-fiber diameter and area in the thigh muscles of the rats. Mouse myoblast-derived C2C12 cells were used to examine whether Dio directly affected skeletal muscle. Dio promoted fusion of myoblasts into multinucleated cells or myotubes. Furthermore, in myotube C2C12 cells, protein levels of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) increased with Dio treatment in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that Dio may not only induce myoblast fusion and enhance skeletal muscle as an  expenditure organ, but may also activate the catabolic pathway via AMPK in skeletal muscle cells. Thus, these effects of Dio on skeletal muscles may contribute to inhibition of visceral fat accumulation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670353>Electrosynthesis of amino  from biomass-derivable  on titanium dioxide.</a></h1><p>Seven amino  were electrochemically synthesized from biomass-derivable α-keto  and NH2OH with faradaic efficiencies (FEs) of 77-99% using an earth-abundant TiO2 catalyst.

These enzymes present in a diverse array of species, including fungi and bacteria. Since this enzyme is in the market for different usages from industry to medicine, having a better knowledge of its structures and properties from diverse sources will be useful to select the most appropriate candidate for different purposes. In the current study, sequence- and structure-based characteristics of these enzymes from fungi and bacteria, including pseudo amino  composition (PseAAC), physicochemical characteristics, and their secondary structures, are being compared and classified. Autodock 4 software was used for docking analysis between these laccases and some phenolic and non-phenolic compounds. The results indicated that features including molecular weight, aliphatic, extinction coefficient, and random coil percentage of these protein groups present high degrees of diversity in most cases. Categorization of these enzymes by the notion of PseAAC, showed over 96% accuracy. The binding free  between fungal laccases and their substrates showed to be considerably higher than those of bacterial ones. According to the outcomes of the current study, data mining methods by using different machine learning algorithms, especially neural networks, could provide valuable information for a fair comparison between fungal and bacterial laccases.

In their lifespan, cardiomyocytes undergo a dynamic maturation process from the fetal to adult stage, radically changing their metabolism, morphology, contractile and electrical properties. Before employing cells of human origin, in vitro models often use neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCM) to obtain key proof-of-principles. Nevertheless, NRCM monolayers de-differentiate when maintained under standard culture conditions, significantly decreasing the expression of mature hallmark-proteins. Supplementation of free fatty  (FFA), the main  source for mature cardiomyocytes, and co-culture with fibroblasts are each by itself known to promote the shift from fetal to adult cardiomyocytes. Using a co-culture system, our study investigates the effects of FFA on the cardiomyocyte phenotype in comparison to glucose as typical fetal  source, and to 10% serum used as standard control condition. Compared to the control condition, FFA- and glucose-supplementation both preserved cardiomyocyte differentiation and functionality with a higher expression of specific (troponin-I) and mature (myosin-light-chain-2v) cardiac markers at the protein- and mRNA-levels. FFA caused a significant increase in the cardiomyocyte contractility compared to the glucose-condition. Moreover, only FFA-supplementation enhanced beta-oxidation-based metabolism, typical of mature cardiomyocytes. Our findings indicate that cardiomyocytes in co-culture with fibroblasts benefit from FFA-supplementation by better maintaining their differentiated state in vitro.Copyright © 2019.

We studied the responses of soil bacterial and fungal communities, the soil's nutritional state and strawberry yield, when the soil was biofumigated each year for five consecutive years using fresh chicken manure (BioFum). BioFum significantly increased the soil's NH-N, NO-N, available P and K and organic matter. Fusarium spp. and Phytophthora spp. which are known to cause plant disease, were significantly decreased after BioFum. In addition, Biofum increased the soil's temperature, enhanced chlorophyll levels in the leaves of strawberry plants, and the soluble sugar and ascorbic  content in strawberry fruit. We used high-throughput gene sequencing to monitor changes in the soil's bacterial and fungal communities. Although BioFum significantly decreased the diversity of these communities, it increased the relative abundance of some biological control agents in the phylum Actinobacteria and the genera Pseudomonas, Bacillus and Chaetomium. An increase in these biological control agents would reduce the incidence of soil-borne pathogens and plant disease. Although strawberry marketable yield using BioFum was higher in the first three years, the decline in the final two years could be due to the accumulation of P and K which may have delayed flowering and fruiting. Methods to overcome yield losses using BioFum need to be developed in the future. Our research, however, showed that BioFum enhanced soil fertility, reduced the presence of soil pathogens, increased the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria and fungi and improved strawberry quality. Unlike chemical soil treatments that can cause pest and disease resistance when used continuously over many years, our multi-year research program on BioFum showed that this treatment provided significant benefits to the soil, plant and strawberry fruit.Copyright © 2019.

The interacting quantum atoms (IQA) method is used to decompose the binding  into electrostatic and quantum mechanical contributions. In addition, bond energies are also estimated by means of multipolar electrostatic calculations. No simple correlation exists between bond energies and structural/electronic descriptors unless the data are segregated by the type of ligand or metal. The electrostatic attraction of some molecules (H 2 O, NH 3 , CH 3 OH) towards the metal cations is well reproduced using their (unrelaxed) atomic multipoles, but the same comparison is much less satisfactory for other ligands ( e.g. , benzene, thiol/thiolate groups, etc.).

Xylan, the major hemicellulosic component, contributes to the structural stability of wood and represents a tremendous quantity of biobased chemicals for fuel production. Monomeric xylose conversion to value-added chemicals such as furfural, xylitol, and xylonic  could greatly improve the economics of pulp-paper industry and biorefinery. Acetic  (HAc) is used as a friendly and recyclable selective catalyst amenable to xylan degradation and xylooligosaccharides production from lignocellulosic materials. However, HAc catalyst usually works much feebly at inert woods than agricultural straws. In this study, effects of different iron species in HAc media on poplar xylan degradation were systematically compared, and a preferable Fe-assisted HAc hydrolysis process was proposed for comparable xylose-hydrolysate recovery (XHR) and enzymatic saccharification of cellulose.In presence of 6.5% HAc with 0.17-0.25 wt% Fe, xylose yield ranged between 72.5 and 73.9%. Additionally, pretreatment was effective in poplar delignification, with a lignin yield falling between 38.6 and 42.5%. Under similar conditions, saccharification efficiency varied between 60.3 and 65.9%. Starting with 100 g poplar biomass, a total amount of 12.7-12.8 g of xylose and 18.8-22.8 g of glucose were harvested from liquid streams during the whole process of Fe-HAc hydrolysis coupled with enzymatic saccharification. Furthermore, the enhancement mechanism of Fe coupled with HAc was investigated after proof-of-concept experiments. Beechwood xylan and xylose were treated under the same condition as poplar sawdust fractionation, giving understanding of the effect of catalysts on the hydrolysis pathway from wood xylan to xylose and furfural by Fe-HAc.The Fe-assisted HAc hydrolysis process was demonstrated as an effective approach to the wood xylose and other monosaccharides production.

The intravitreous injection of VEGF antibodies has been reported to be an effective treatment to relieve symptoms of WAMD. However, the limitations of this treatment are high costs and invasiveness. For this reason, oral delivery route can be considered as a cost-effective way and the safest method to deliver drug molecules to the eyes. Accordingly, ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) was included in the oral formulation as the potential substance for the cure of WAMD in the animal model. Various pharmacological activities, such as antioxidant or anti-inflammatory effects, have been reported for UDCA and recent reports support the effects of UDCA in ocular treatment. However, due to poor water solubility and low pKa (around 5.0), it has been challenging to formulate aqueous solution of UDCA in the neutral pH range. In the present study, we confirmed the aqueous solubility of the oral UDCA formulation and performed a preclinical study, including pharmacokinetic profiling and WAMD model efficacy study in mice after oral administration of the drug solution. The results demonstrated that the formulation improved bioavailability of UDCA and efficiently delivered UDCA to the eye tissues after oral absorption. UDCA formulation was found to have inhibitory effects of choroidal neovascularization with a functional recovery in mice retinas. Taken together, our results suggest that the oral UDCA formulation could be used as a potent supplement for the cure of WAMD and related retinal diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646753>Manipulation of β-carotene levels in tomato fruits results in increased ABA content and extended shelf-life.</a></h1><p>Tomato fruit ripening is controlled by the hormone ethylene and by a group of transcription factors, acting upstream of ethylene. During ripening, the linear carotene lycopene accumulates at the expense of cyclic carotenoids. Fruit-specific overexpression of LYCOPENE β-CYCLASE (LCYb) resulted in increased β-carotene (provitamin A) content. Unexpectedly, LCYb-overexpressing fruits also exhibited a diverse array of ripening phenotypes, including delayed softening and extended shelf life. These phenotypes were accompanied, at the biochemical level, by an increase of abscisic  (ABA) content, decreased ethylene production, increased density of cell wall material containing linear pectins with a low degree of methylation, and a thicker cuticle with a higher content of cutin monomers and triterpenoids. The levels of several primary metabolites and phenylpropanoid compounds were also altered in the transgenic fruits, which could be attributed to delayed fruit ripening and/or to ABA. Network correlation analysis and pharmacological experiments with the ABA biosynthesis inhibitor, abamine, indicated that altered ABA levels were a direct effect of the increased β-carotene content and were in turn responsible for the extended shelf life phenotype. Thus, manipulation of β-carotene levels results not only in an improvement of the nutritional value of tomato fruits, but also of their shelf life.© 2019 The Authors.

Anthropometry measurements were conducted on the index child at birth and approximately 1 and 2 years of age. A directed acyclic graph was used to identify minimal sufficient adjustment sets. Log-binomial regression was used to estimate the relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPY), a metabolite of chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos methyl, and 4-nitrophenol, a metabolite of parathion and methyl parathion, were detected in nearly all women with geometric mean (95% CI) values of 3.17 (2.82-3.56) and 18.66 (17.03-20.46) µg/g creatinine, respectively. 3-phenoxybenzoic  (3-PBA), a non-specific metabolite of several pyrethroids, and 2-isopropyl-4-methyl-6-hydroxypyrimidine (IMPY), a diazinon metabolite, were detected in 19.8% and 16.1% of women, respectively. The remaining four pesticide biomarkers were detected in <10% of women. Women in the highest quartile of 4-nitrophenol were more than 3 times more likely to deliver preterm than women in the lowest quartile: unadjusted RR (95% CI), 3.57 (1.65, 7.73). Women in the highest quartile of 4-nitrophenol were also at increased risk of having a child born small for gestational age: RR (95% CI) adjusted for household income, maternal education, and maternal total  and meat intake, 3.81 (1.10, 13.21). Women with detectable concentrations of IMPY were at increased risk of having a child born with low birth weight compared to women with non-detectable concentrations: adjusted RR (95% CI), 2.13 (1.12, 4.08).

We examined the effects of acute or chronic intraperitoneal treatment with PEA (20 μg·g body weight) on parameters related to food intake and its regulatory mechanisms, locomotor activity, glucose and lipid metabolism, and the possible involvement of transcription factors and clock genes on metabolic changes in the liver. Acute PEA treatment induced a decrease in food intake at 6 and 8 h post-injection, comparable to that observed in mammals. This PEA anorectic effect in goldfish could be mediated through interactions with leptin and NPY, as PEA increased hepatic expression of leptin aI and reduced hypothalamic expression of npy. The PEA chronic treatment reduced weight gain, growth rate, and locomotor activity. The rise in glycolytic potential together with the increased potential of glucose to be transported into liver suggests an enhanced use of glucose in the liver after PEA treatment. In addition, part of glucose may be exported to be used in other tissues. The activity of fatty  synthase (FAS) increased after chronic PEA treatment, suggesting an increase in the hepatic lipogenic capacity, in contrast with the mammalian model. Such lipogenic increment could be linked with the PEA-induction of REV-ERBα and BMAL1 found after the chronic treatment. As a whole, the present study shows the actions of PEA in several compartments related to  homeostasis and feeding behavior, supporting a regulatory role for this N-acylethanolamine in fish.Copyright © 2019.

The highest yield of collagen was 84.14% based on protein weight after ultrasonic treatment for 36 min. Using SDS-PAGE, the extracted protein was identified as collagen-II and its structural integrity was observed using scanning electron microscopy. The triple helical structure remained the same, but some changes in the secondary structure were observed after longer ultrasonication treatments (≥36 min). The amino  profile exhibited high thermal stability. The rheological and functional characteristics of collagen were also considerably improved after ultrasonication for the optimal period (24 min). The ultrasonication treatment is an effective process for the extraction of collagen-II from land animal co-products, which will further meet the increasing industrial demand.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Unfortunately, there are few effective systemic treatment options, particularly for disseminated disease. Glypican-3 (GPC3) is a proteoglycan cell surface receptor overexpressed in most HCCs and provides a unique target for molecular therapies. We have previously demonstrated that PET imaging using a Zr-conjugated monoclonal anti-GPC3 antibody (GPC3) can bind to minute tumors and allow imaging with high sensitivity and specificity in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model of HCC and that serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels are highly correlated with tumor size in this model. In the present study, we conjugated Y, a high- beta-particle-emitting radionuclide, to our GPC3 antibody to develop a novel antibody-directed radiotherapeutic approach for HCC. Luciferase-expressing HepG2 human hepatoblastoma cells were orthotopically implanted in the livers of athymic nude mice, and tumor establishment was verified at 6 weeks after implantation by bioluminescent imaging and serum AFP concentration. Tumor burden by bioluminescence and serum AFP concentration was highly correlated in our model. Yttrium-90 was conjugated to GPC3 using the chelating agent 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic  (DOTA) and injected via the tail vein into the experimental mice at a dose of 200 Ci/mouse or 300 Ci/mouse. Control mice received DOTA-GPC3 without radionuclide. At 30 days after a single dose of the radioimmunotherapy agent, mean serum AFP levels in control animals increased dramatically, while animals treated with 200 Ci only experienced a minor increase, indicating cessation of tumor growth, and animals treated with 300 Ci experienced a reduction in serum AFP concentration, indicating tumor shrinkage. Mean tumor-bearing liver weight in control animals was also significantly greater than that in animals that received either dose of Y-GPC3. These results were achieved without significant toxicity as measured by body condition scoring and body weight. The results of this preclinical pilot demonstrate that GPC3 can be used as a target for radioimmunotherapy in an orthotopic mouse model of HCC and may be a target of clinical significance, particularly for disseminated HCC.Copyright © 2019 Andrew D.

However, little is known about how the diet fed to BSFL affects their nutritional value, especially their fatty  composition. In this study, BSFL were fed 11 diets based on four different organic waste sources (mussels, bread, fish and food waste). Fatty  and proximate composition (dry matter, crude fat, crude protein and ash) were analysed in the diets, in two-week-old larvae and substrate residues. Larval weight, survival and feed conversion were also recorded. The diet was found to affect all parameters investigated. Irrespective of diet, the larval fat consisted mainly of lauric  and other saturated fatty  and these were found to be synthesised by the larvae. However, both the fatty  composition of the substrate, and the larval weight were found to affect the fatty  profile of the larvae. In general, larvae with a higher weight contained a higher percentage of saturated fatty  and a lower percentage of unsaturated fatty , such as eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA). It was concluded that the possibilities to tailor the fatty  composition of the BSFL through the diet are limited; thus, the BSFL fat may not be suitable to replace fish oil, but has potential of inclusion in other food, feed and fuel products.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Analytes were separated using an Zorbax Extend-Agilent C (1.8 μm, 4.6 × 30 mm) column following a simple methanol precipitation treatment. The mobile phase consisted of methanol and water containing 0.1% formic , and the total gradient program time was 1.5 min. Method validation results showed TH was linear in 2-500 ng/mL (r > 0.99), and the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 2 μg/mL. The intra-run and inter-run precision (coefficient of variation, CV) was within 2.80%, and the accuracy (relative error, RE) was within ±11.10%. Stability of TH was evaluated in different storage conditions, including short-term I-III, long-term I-III, 2 and 4 h in the artificial gastrointestinal tract, respectively. There was no obvious interference between TH and internal standards (IS). With the established Caco-2 monolayer permeability model, Papp(AB) of TH was calculated as 46.29 ± 8.31 × 10 cm/s, and the efflux ratio (ER) value was calculated as 0.22, indicating a high permeability character of TH. The transmembrane transport of TH followed the concentration-dependent, temperature-independent, and -free manner. Collectively, these characteristics indicate that TH is a highly permeable drug and the transport mechanism is mainly via passive diffusion.Copyright © 2019.

We have previously demonstrated its neuroprotective and neurotrophic properties in PC12 cells treated with the dopaminergic neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+). Now, we have investigated the neuroprotective effects and mechanisms of p-BTX-I against the toxicity of acrolein in PC12 cells. Studies have demonstrated that acrolein might play an important role in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is characterized by neuronal and synaptic loss. Our results showed that not only acrolein reduced cell differentiation and cell viability, but also altered the expression of markers of synaptic communication (synapsin I),  metabolism (AMPK-α, Sirt I and glucose uptake), and cytoskeleton (β-III-tubulin). Treatment with p-BTX-I increased the percentage of differentiation in cells treated with acrolein and significantly attenuated cell viability loss, besides counteracting the negative effects of acrolein on synapsin I, AMPK-α, Sirt I, glucose uptake, and β-III-tubulin. Additionally, p-BTX-I alone increased the expression of apolipoprotein E (apoE) gene, associated with the proteolytic degradation of β-amyloid peptide aggregates, a hallmark of AD. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that p-BTX-I protects against acrolein-induced neurotoxicity and might be a tool for the development of novel drugs for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663260>Evidence of non-covalent complexes in some natural extracts: Ceylon tea and Mate extracts.</a></h1><p>Considering the high complexity of natural extracts, due to the presence of organic molecules of different chemical nature, the possibility of formation of non-covalent complexes should be taken into account. In a previous investigation the formation of bimolecular complexes between caffeine and catechins in green tea extracts (GTE) has been experimentally proven by means of mass spectrometric and  H nuclear magnetic resonance experiments. The same approaches have been employed in the present study to evaluate the presence of bimolecular complexes in Ceylon tea and Mate extracts. The obtained results show that in the case of Ceylon tea extracts protonated theaflavin is detectable, together with theaflavin/caffein complexes, while caffeine/catechin complexes, already detected in green tea, are still present, but at lower concentration. This aspect is evidenced by the comparison of precursor ion scans performed on protonated caffeine for the two extracts. The spectra obtained in these conditions for GTE and Ceylon tea show that the complexes of caffeine with epigallocatechin (EGC), epicatechin gallate (ECG) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), highy abundant in the case of GTE (signal-to-chemical noise ratio in the range 50-100), are negligible (signal-to-chemical noise ratio in the range 2-3) in the case of Ceylon tea. Mate extracts show the formation of bimolecular complexes involving caffeine but not catechins, and chlorogenic  becomes responsible for other complex formation. Under positive ion and negative ion conditions, accurate mass measurements allow the identification of malealdehyde, chlorogenic , caffeine, two isomers of dicaffeoylquinic , rutin and kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside. These data indicate that the formation of complexes in natural extracts is a common behaviour and their presence must be considered in the description of natural extracts and, consequently, in their biological activity.This article is protected by copyright.

Mitochondria are important mediators of metabolic flexibility and dysfunction is associated with metabolic inflexibility and pathology. Foodborne toxins are often overlooked as potential factors contributing to metabolic toxicity. Fusaric  (FA), a neglected mycotoxin, is known to disrupt mitochondrial function. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying a metabolic switch in response to FA. This study investigated the effects of FA on  homeostasis in cultured human liver (HepG2) cells. HepG2 cells poised to undergo oxidative and glycolytic metabolism were exposed to a range of FA concentrations (4, 63 and 250 µg/mL) for 6 hours. We determined mitochondrial toxicity, acetyl CoA levels and cell viability using luminometric, fluorometric and spectrophotometric methods. Expression of metabolic proteins (PDK1, PKM2, phosphorylated-PDH E1α and HIF-1α) and mRNAs (HIF-1α, PKM2, LDHa and PDK1) were determined using western blot and qPCR respectively. Our data connects a constitutive expression of HIF-1α in response to FA, to the inhibition of pyruvate decarboxylation through up-regulation of PDK-1 and phosphorylation of Pyruvate Dehydrogenase E1α subunit. Moreover, we highlight the potential of FA to induce a glucose "addiction" and phenotype reminiscent of the Warburg effect. The findings provide novel insights into the impact of this neglected foodborne mycotoxin in the dysregulation of  metabolism.Copyright © 2019.

The polyamide-adsorbed tetrachloroaurate can be readily reduced to gold nanoparticles by using sodium borohydride, ascorbic , hydrogen peroxide, UV light, or by heating. All reduction methods led to polyamide-anchored nanoparticles with an even size distribution and high dispersion. The particle sizes were somewhat dependent on the reduction method, but the average diameters were typically about 20 nm. Particle sizes were determined by using a combination of single-particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, helium ion microscopy, and powder X-ray diffraction. Dispersion of the particles was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy with -dispersive spectroscopy. Due to the high adsorption selectivity of polyamide-12 toward tetrachloroaurate, the three-dimensional-printed filters were first used as selective gold scavengers for the acidic leachate of electronicwaste (WEEE). The supported nanoparticles were then generated directly on the filter via a simple reduction step. These objects were used as catalysts for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol. The described method provides a direct route from waste to catalysts. The selective laser sintering method can be used to customize the flow properties of the catalytically active filter object, which allows the optimization of the porous catalytic object to meet the requirements of catalytic processes.Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662816>Maternal Diet-Induced Obesity Compromises Oxidative Stress Status and Angiogenesis in the Porcine Placenta by Upregulating Nox2 Expression.</a></h1><p>Maternal obesity is associated with placental oxidative stress. However, the mechanism underlying this association remains poorly understood. In the present study, a gilt obesity model was developed by exposure to different  diets and used to investigate the role of NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2) in the placenta. Specifically, 99 gilts (Guangdong Small-ear Spotted pig) at day 60 of gestation were randomly assigned to one of the following three treatments: low- group (L, DE = 11.50 MJ/kg), medium- group (M, DE = 12.41 MJ/kg), and high- group (H, DE = 13.42 MJ/kg), with 11 replicate pens per treatment and 3 gilts per pen. At the start of the study, maternal body weight and backfat thickness were not significantly different in the three treatments. After the study, data indicated that the H group had higher body weight and backfat thickness gain for gilts during gestation and lower piglet birth weight compared with the other two groups. Additionally, the H group showed glucolipid metabolic disorders and increased triglyceride and nonesterified fatty  contents in the placenta of gilts. Compared with the L group, the H group exhibited lower mitochondrial biogenesis and increased oxidative damage in the placenta. Importantly, increased mRNA expression and protein abundance of Nox2 were observed for the first time in H group placentae. Furthermore, compared with the L group, the H group showed a decrease in the density of placental vessels and the protein levels of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), and phosphorylation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (p-VEGFR2) as well as the immunostaining intensity of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (CD31). Our findings suggest that maternal high- diet-induced obesity increases placental oxidative stress and decreases placental angiogenesis possibly through the upregulation of Nox2.Copyright © 2019 Chengjun Hu et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657891>NOx Adsorption and optical detection in Rare Earth Metal-Organic Frameworks.</a></h1><p> gases (e.g., NOx, SOx), commonly found in complex chemical and petrochemical streams, require material development for their selective adsorption and removal. Here, we report the NOx adsorption properties in a family of rare earth (RE) metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) materials. Fundamental understanding of the structure-property relationship of NOx adsorption in the RE-DOBDC materials platform was sought via a combined experimental and molecular modeling study. No structural change was noted following humid NOx exposure. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations indicated that H2O has a stronger affinity to bind with the metal center than NO2, while NO2 preferentially binds with the DOBDC ligands. Further modeling results indicate no change in binding  across the RE elements investigated. Also, stabilization of the NO2 and H2O molecules following adsorption was noted, predicted to be due to hydrogen bonding between the framework ligands and the molecules and nanoconfinement within the MOF structure. This interaction also caused distinct changes in emission spectra, identified experimentally. Calculations indicated that this is due to the adsorption of NO2 molecules onto the DOBDC ligand altering the electronic transitions and the resulting photoluminescent properties, a feature that has potential applications in future sensing technologies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646963>The microbiota structure in the cecum of laying hens contributes to dissimilar HS production.</a></h1><p>Host genotype plays a crucial role in microbial composition of laying hens, which may lead to dissimilar odor gas production. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship among layer breed, microbial structure and odor production.Thirty Hy-Line Gray and thirty Lohmann Pink laying hens were used in this study to determine the impact of cecal microbial structure on odor production of laying hens. The hens were managed under the same husbandry and dietary regimes. Results of in vivo experiments showed a lower hydrogen sulfide (HS) production from Hy-Line hens and a lower concentration of soluble sulfide (S) but a higher concentration of butyrate in the cecal content of the Hy-Line hens compared to Lohmann Pink hens (P < 0.05), which was consistent with the in vitro experiments (P < 0.05). However, ammonia (NH) production was not different between genotypes (P > 0.05). Significant microbial structural differences existed between the two breed groups. The relative abundance of some butyrate producers (including Butyricicoccus, Butyricimonas and Roseburia) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (including Mailhella and Lawsonia) were found to be significantly correlated with odor production and were shown to be different in the 16S rRNA and PCR data between two breed groups. Furthermore, some bacterial metabolism pathways associated with  extraction and carbohydrate utilization (oxidative phosphorylation, pyruvate metabolism,  metabolism, two component system and secretion system) were overrepresented in the Hy-Line hens, while several amino  metabolism-associated pathways (amino  related enzymes, arginine and proline metabolism, and alanine-aspartate and glutamate metabolism) were more prevalent in the Lohmann hens.The results of this study suggest that genotype of laying hens influence cecal microbiota, which in turn modulates their odor production. Our study provides references for breeding and enteric manipulation for defined microbiota to reduce odor gas emission.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663498>Algoriphagus sanaruensis sp. nov., a member of the family Cyclobacteriaceae, isolated from a brackish lake in Hamamatsu, Japan.</a></h1><p>Strain M8-2, which was isolated from brackish lake water (Lake Sanaru) in Japan, was characterized for representation of a novel species in the genus Algoriphagus. Cells of strain M8-2 were aerobic, Gram-stain-negative and curved-rod-shaped (0.2-0.5 µm wide and 0.7-1.9 µm long). Strain M8-2 grew optimally at 30 °C, pH 6.5-7.5 and in the presence of 0.5-1.0 % (w/v) NaCl. MK-7 was the sole isoprenoid quinone.

In addition to the electrical conductivity and stability, the number of inner tubes or walls also influence the electrocatalytic activity of the supported catalysts. Here we study the electrocatalytic activity of Pt nanoparticles (NPs) supported on CNTs (Pt/CNTs) as a function of number of walls towards ORR in both alkaline and  solutions. The results indicate that the mechanism of ORR on Pt/CNTs does not change with the number of walls of CNTs support but the number of walls of CNTs supports has a significant effect on the electrocatalytic activity of supported Pt NPs. Pt NPs supported on double-walled CNTs (DWCNTs) exhibit a much better activity for ORR, as compared with that supported on single-walled and multi-walled CNTs (SWCNTs and MWCNTs). The high electrocatalytic activity of DWCNTs-supported Pt NPs is contributed to the fast electron transfer between the outer wall and inner tubes of DWCNTs for ORR through electron tunnelling process under the electrochemical polarization driving force.</p></html>
