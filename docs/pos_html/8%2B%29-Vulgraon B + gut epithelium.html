IgA induction in the -associated lymphoid tissues (GALTs) is dependent on microbial sampling and cellular interaction in the subepithelial dome (SED). However it is unclear how IgA induction is predominantly initiated in the SED. Here we show that previously unrecognized mesenchymal cells in the SED of GALTs regulate bacteria-specific IgA production and diversify the  microbiota. Mesenchymal cells expressing the cytokine RANKL directly interact with the   to control CCL20 expression and microfold (M) cell differentiation. The deletion of mesenchymal RANKL impairs M cell-dependent antigen sampling and  cell-dendritic cell interaction in the SED, which results in a reduction in IgA production and a decrease in microbial diversity. Thus, the subepithelial mesenchymal cells that serve as M cell inducers have a fundamental role in the maintenance of intestinal immune homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27008212>Regulation of the intestinal tight junction by natural polyphenols: A mechanistic perspective.</a></h2><p>Impairment of the epithelial barrier function is closely linked to the pathogenesis of various gastrointestinal diseases, food allergies, type I diabetes, and other systematic diseases. Plant-derived polyphenols are natural secondary metabolites and exert various physiological benefits, including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, anti-carcinogenic, and anti-aging effects. Recent studies also show the role of plant polyphenols in regulation of the intestinal barrier and prevention of intestinal inflammatory diseases. Here we summarize the regulatory pathways and mediators linking polyphenols to their beneficial effects on tight junction and  epithelial barrier functions, and provide useful information about using polyphenols as nutraceuticals for intestinal diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27717419>Autoimmunity in Crohn's Disease-A Putative Stratification Factor of the Clinical Phenotype.</a></h2><p>Inflammation in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) has been linked to a loss of tolerance to self-antigens suggesting the existence of autoantibodies in specific disease phenotypes. However, the lack of clearly defined autoantigenic targets has slowed down research. Genome-wide association studies have identified an impressive number of immune-related susceptibility loci for IBD with no clearly discernible pattern among them. Growing evidence supports the hypothesis that innate immune responses to a low-diversity and impaired  microbiota may be of key importance in initiating and perpetuating chronic inflammation in IBD. Increasing evidence suggests that reduced microbial diversity and microbial-mucosal  interaction (including adhesion and clearance) are critically involved in IBD pathogenesis. Along these lines the discovery of autoantigenic targets in Crohn's disease (CD) has refocused research in IBD on the possible role of autoimmune responses. The identification of the major zymogen granule membrane glycoprotein 2 (GP2) as an autoantigen in CD patients and its proposed role in the sensing of the microbiota lends credence to this trend. Loss of tolerance to GP2 occurs in up to 40% of patients with CD. Corresponding autoantibodies appear to be associated with distinct disease courses (types or phenotypes) in CD. Here, we critically review autoantibodies in CD for their impact on clinical practice and future IBD research. The immunomodulatory role of GP2 in innate and adaptive intestinal immunity is also discussed.© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Composed of a single layer of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) held together by tight junctions, this delicate structure prevents the transfer of harmful microorganisms, antigens, and toxins from the  lumen into the circulation. The equilibrium between the rate of apoptosis and shedding of senescent epithelial cells at the villus tip, and the generation of new cells in the crypt, is key to maintaining tissue homeostasis. However, in both localized and systemic inflammation, this balance may be disturbed as a result of pathological IEC shedding. Shedding of IECs from the epithelial monolayer may cause transient gaps or microerosions in the epithelial barrier, resulting in increased intestinal permeability. Although pathological IEC shedding has been observed in mouse models of inflammation and human intestinal conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains limited. This process may also be an important contributor to systemic and intestinal inflammatory diseases and  barrier dysfunction in domestic animal species. This review aims to summarize current knowledge about intestinal epithelial cell shedding, its significance in  barrier dysfunction and host-microbial interactions, and where research in this field is directed.© The Author(s) 2014.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27590109>Biphasic Ccl20 regulation by Toll-like receptor 9 through the activation of ERK-AP-1 and non-canonical NF-κ signaling pathways.</a></h2><p>Chemokines play key roles in immune homeostasis and inflammatory response. Considering the role of Ccl20 and Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) in  homeostasis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), regulation of Ccl20 by bacterial DNA, the TLR9 ligand, merits in-depth studies.We analyzed Ccl20 expression in various epithelial cell (EC) lines by q-PCR and ELISA. In-vivo expression was investigated in isolated murine colonocytes by immunoblotting. Transcriptional regulation of Ccl20 was studied by reporter assays, gene knock-down, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Activation of upstream kinases was checked by immunoblotting.We showed low levels of Ccl20 expression in mouse colonic ECs, but marked induction by in vivo treatment with bacterial DNA. This corroborated with persistent Ccl20 induction in different EC lines. We found involvement of MAP-kinases during the early hours after stimulation, and a novel AP-1site (-252bp) regulated the expression in colonic ECs. More importantly, mutually exclusive transcriptional regulation by AP-1 (cjun/cfos) and non-canonical NF-κ (RelB/p52) downstream of MEK-ERK and NIK-IKK-α-NF-κB2 (p100) phosphorylation, respectively was responsible for persistent Ccl20 expression in the colonic cells, while canonical NF-κ isoforms played no role.Persistent Ccl20 induction by TLR9 in colonic ECs involves early and delayed activation of two independent signaling pathways. This is the first report of non-canonical NF-κ activation and Ccl20 expression in the colonic ECs by TLR9.Our study will help to better understand immune regulation by Ccl20 in the intestine and may be exploited for future development of novel therapeutics against IBD.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier .V.

LNFs with solid matrices may be typically categorized into three major types of formulations, viz., solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) and lipid-drug conjugate nanoparticles (LDC-NPs). Solid matrix based LNFs are, potentially, the most appropriate delivery systems for poorly water soluble drugs in need of improved drug solubility, permeability, absorption, or increased oral BA. In addition, LNFs as matrices are able to encapsulate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs in a single matrix based on their excellent ability to form cores and shells. Interestingly, LNFs also act as delivery devices to impart chemical stability to various orally administered drugs. : Aim of the review is to forecast the presentation of pharmacokinetic characteristics of solid lipid matrix based nanocarriers which are typically biocompatible, biodegradable and non-toxic carrier systems for efficient oral delivery of various drugs. Efficient delivery is broadly mediated by the fact that lipophilic drugs are readily soluble in lipidic substrates that are capable of permeating across the   following oral administration, subsequently delivering the moiety of interest more efficiently across the  mucosal membrane. This enhances the overall BA of many drugs facing oral delivery challenges by improving their pharmacokinetic profile. This article specifically focuses on the biopharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic aspects of such solid lipid matrix based nanoformulations and possible mechanisms for better drug absorption and improved BA following oral administration. It also briefly reviews methods to access the efficacy of LNFs for improving oral BA of drugs, regulatory aspects and some interesting lipid-derived commercial formulations, with a concluding remark. : LNFs enhance the overall BA of many drugs facing oral delivery challenges by improving their pharmacokinetic profile.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30249770>Smooth muscle: a stiff sculptor of epithelial shapes.</a></h2><p>Smooth muscle is increasingly recognized as a key mechanical sculptor of epithelia during embryonic development. Smooth muscle is a mesenchymal tissue that surrounds the epithelia of organs including the , blood vessels, lungs, bladder, ureter, uterus, oviduct and epididymis. Smooth muscle is stiffer than its adjacent  and often serves its morphogenetic function by physically constraining the growth of a proliferating epithelial layer. This constraint leads to mechanical instabilities and epithelial morphogenesis through buckling. Smooth muscle stiffness alone, without smooth muscle cell shortening, seems to be sufficient to drive epithelial morphogenesis. Fully understanding the development of organs that use smooth muscle stiffness as a driver of morphogenesis requires investigating how smooth muscle develops, a key aspect of which is distinguishing smooth muscle-like tissues from one another  and in culture. This necessitates a comprehensive appreciation of the genetic, anatomical and functional markers that are used to distinguish the different subtypes of smooth muscle (for example, vascular versus visceral) from similar cell types (including myofibroblasts and myoepithelial cells). Here, we review how smooth muscle acts as a mechanical driver of morphogenesis and discuss ways of identifying smooth muscle, which is critical for understanding these morphogenetic events.This article is part of the Theo Murphy meeting issue 'Mechanics of Development'.© 2018 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26778296>Bacteria sensing mechanisms in Drosophila : Local and systemic consequences.</a></h2><p>All insects are colonized by microorganisms on their exoskeleton, their  and even in some cases within their own somatic and germ line cells.

Mainly through ingestion of contaminated food, the mouth- axis represents the first and principal access of external bacteria to the host.

Recognition and the role of antimicrobial peptides in  immunity and Drosophila-microbe interactions.</a></h2><p>Drosophila melanogaster lives, breeds and feeds on fermenting fruit, an environment that supports a high density, and often a diversity, of microorganisms. This association with such dense microbe-rich environments has been proposed as a reason that D. melanogaster evolved a diverse and potent antimicrobial peptide (AMP) response to microorganisms, especially to combat potential pathogens that might occupy this niche. Yet, like most animals, D. melanogaster also lives in close association with the beneficial microbes that comprise its microbiota, or microbiome, and recent studies have shown that antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) of the epithelial immune response play an important role in dictating these interactions and controlling the host response to  microbiota. Moreover, D. melanogaster also eats microbes for food, consuming fermentative microbes of decaying plant material and their by-products as both larvae and adults. The processes of nutrient acquisition and host defence are remarkably similar and use shared functions for microbe detection and response, an observation that has led to the proposal that the digestive and immune systems have a common evolutionary origin. In this manner, D. melanogaster provides a powerful model to understand how, and whether, hosts differentiate between the microbes they encounter across this spectrum of associations.This article is part of the themed issue 'Evolutionary ecology of arthropod antimicrobial peptides'.© 2016 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28560287>Mend Your Fences: The Epithelial Barrier and its Relationship With Mucosal Immunity in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>The intestinal  can be easily disrupted during  inflammation as seen in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. For a long time, research into the pathophysiology of IBD has been focused on immune cell-mediated mechanisms. Recent evidence, however, suggests that the intestinal  might play a major role in the development and perpetuation of IBD. It is now clear that IBD can be triggered by disturbances in epithelial barrier integrity via dysfunctions in intestinal epithelial cell-intrinsic molecular circuits that control the homeostasis, renewal, and repair of intestinal epithelial cells. The intestinal  in the healthy individual represents a semi-permeable physical barrier shielding the interior of the body from invasions of pathogens on the one hand and allowing selective passage of nutrients on the other hand. However, the intestinal  must be considered much more than a simple physical barrier. Instead, the  is a highly dynamic tissue that responds to a plenitude of signals including the intestinal microbiota and signals from the immune system. This epithelial response to these signals regulates barrier function, the composition of the microbiota, and mucosal immune homeostasis within the lamina propria. The  can thus be regarded as a translator between the microbiota and the immune system and aberrant signal transduction between the  and adjacent immune cells might promote immune dysregulation in IBD. This review summarizes the important cellular and molecular barrier components of the intestinal  and emphasizes the mechanisms leading to barrier dysfunction during intestinal inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27027557>Intraluminal tranexamic acid inhibits intestinal sheddases and mitigates  and lung injury and inflammation in a rodent model of hemorrhagic shock.</a></h2><p>Intravenous tranexamic acid (TXA) is an effective adjunct after hemorrhagic shock (HS) because of its antifibrinolytic properties.

A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM-17) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) are effective sheddases of intestinal syndecan-1, which when shed, exposes the underlying intestinal  to digestive proteases and subsequent systemic insult.

Clinical manifestations associated with mutations of the human COL4A1 gene include perinatal cerebral hemorrhage and porencephaly, hereditary angiopathy, nephropathy, aneurysms and muscle cramps (HANAC), ocular dysgenesis, myopathy, Walker–Warburg syndrome and systemic tissue degeneration. In Drosophila, the phenotype associated with dominant temperature sensitive mutations of col4a1 include severe myopathy resulting from massive degradation of striated muscle fibers, and in the , degeneration of circular visceral muscle cells and epithelial cells following detachment from the BM. In order to determine the consequences of altered BMfunctions due to aberrant COL4A1 protein, we have carried out a series of tests using Drosophila DTS-L3 mutants from our allelic series of col4a1 mutations with confirmed degeneration of various cell types and lowest survival rate among the col4a1 mutant lines at restrictive temperature. Results demonstrated epithelial cell degeneration in the , shortened , enlarged midgut with multiple diverticulae, intestinal dysfunction and shortened life span. Midgut immunohistochemistry analyses confirmed altered expression and distribution of BM components integrin PSI and PSII alpha subunits, laminin gamma 1, and COL4A1 both in larvae and adults. Global gene expression analysis revealed activation of the effector AMP genes of the primary innate immune system including Metchnikowin, Diptericin, Diptericin , and edin that preceded morphological changes. Attacin::GFP midgut expression pattern further supported these changes. An increase in ROS production and changes in  bacterial flora were also noted and may have further enhanced an immune response.

Samples obtained from nine infants colonized by  EVC001 and from 10 infants colonized by higher levels of mucolytic taxa (controls), including , were compared. Previously performed untargeted nano-high-performance liquid chromatography-chip/time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to detect and quantify glycans originating from colonic mucin. Colonic mucin-derived -glycans from control infants composed 37.68% (± 3.14% SD) of the total glycan structure pool, whereas colonic mucin-derived -glycans made up of only 1.78% (± 0.038% SD) of the total in  EVC001 samples.

At present, it is not resolved if components of the  microbiota can augment innate immune sensing in the intestinal  via the up-regulation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Here, we report that colonization of germ-free (GF) Swiss Webster mice with a complex  microbiota augments expression of TLR2. The microbiota-dependent up-regulation of components of the TLR2 signaling complex could be reversed by a 7 day broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. TLR2 downstream signaling via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2) and protein-kinase  (AKT) induced by bacterial TLR2 agonists resulted in increased proliferation of the small intestinal epithelial cell line MODE-K. Mice that were colonized from birth with a normal  microbiota (conventionally-raised; CONV-R) showed signs of increased small intestinal renewal and apoptosis compared with GF controls as indicated by elevated mRNA levels of the proliferation markers Ki67 and Cyclin D1, elevated transcripts of the apoptosis marker Caspase-3 and increased numbers of TUNEL-positive cells per intestinal villus structure. In accordance, TLR2-deficient mice showed reduced proliferation and reduced apoptosis.

They are involved in inflammatory reactions associated with innate immune defence against parasitic infections and are also involved in pathological processes in response to allergens. Recently, however, it has become clear that eosinophils also play crucial non-inflammatory roles in the generation and maintenance of adaptive immune responses. Eosinophils, being a major source of the plasma cell survival factor APRIL (activation and proliferation-induced ligand), are essential not only for the long-term survival of plasma cells in the bone marrow, but also for the maintenance of these cells in the lamina propria which underlies the  . At steady state under non-inflammatory conditions eosinophils are resident cells of the gastrointestinal tract, although only few are present in the major organized lymphoid tissue of the  - the Peyer's patches (PP). Surprisingly, however, lack of eosinophils abolishes efficient class-switching of  cells to immunoglobulin (Ig)A in the germinal centres of PP. Thus, eosinophils are required to generate and to maintain mucosal IgA plasma cells, and as a consequence their absence leads to a marked reduction of IgA both in serum and in the -associated lymphoid tissues (GALT). Eosinophils thus have an essential part in long-term humoral immune protection, as they are crucial for the longevity of antibody-producing plasma cells in the bone marrow and, in addition, for  immune homeostasis.© 2015 British Society for Immunology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27173933>Defensive Mutualism Rescues NADPH Oxidase Inactivation in  Infection.</a></h2><p>NOX/DUOX family of NADPH oxidases are expressed in diverse tissues and are the primary enzymes for the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

It is secreted by the kidneys, liver, and intestine. To evaluate potential transport mechanisms for TC, we measured affinity of the drug to the human uptake and efflux transporters known to be of pharmacokinetic relevance. Affinity of TC to the uptake transporters OATP1A2, -1B1, -1B3, -2B1, OCT1, -2, -3, OCTN2, NTCP, and ASBT and the efflux carriers P-gp, MRP2 and MRP3 transfected in HEK293 and MDCK2 cells was measured. To identify relevant pharmacokinetic mechanisms in the bladder urothelium, mRNA expression of multidrug transporters, drug metabolizing enzymes, and nuclear receptors, and the uptake of TC into primary human bladder urothelium (HBU) cells were measured. TC was shown to be a substrate of OATP1A2 (Km = 6.9 ± 1.3 μmol/L; Vmax = 41.6 ± 1.8 pmol/mg·min), OCT1 (Km = 106 ± 16 μmol/L; Vmax = 269 ± 18 pmol/mg·min), and P-gp (Km = 34.9 ± 7.5 μmol/L; Vmax = 105 ± 9.1 pmol/mg·min, lipovesicle assay).

Affinity of TC to OCT1 and P-glycoprotein may be the reason for incomplete oral absorption, wide distribution into liver and kidneys, and substantial intestinal and renal secretions.

First, how melatonin is synthesized and degraded in the  and exerts potentially diverse phenotypic effects through its diverse metabolites. Second, how melatonin mediates the activation and proliferation of intestinal mucosal immune cells with paracrine and autocrine properties. By modulating T/ cells, mast cells, macrophages and dendritic cells, melatonin immunomodulatory involved in regulating T-cell differentiation, intervening T/ cell interaction and attenuating the production of pro-inflammatory factors, achieving its antioxidant action via specific receptors. Third, how melatonin exerts antimicrobial action and modulates microbial components, such as lipopolysaccharide, amyloid-β peptides via nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated  cells (NF-κ) or signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT1) pathway to modulate intestinal immune function in immune-pineal axis. The last, how melatonin mediates the effect of intestinal bacterial activity signals on the body rhythm system through the NF-κ pathway and influences the mucosal  oscillation via clock gene expression. These processes are achieved at mitochondrial and nuclear levels to control the host immune cell development.

This work illustrates that  is capable of enhancing the intestinal mucus layer and goblet cell function via upregulation of gene expression and autophagy signaling pathways, with a net increase in mucin production. Microbe-host interactions in the intestine occur along the mucus-covered . In the gastrointestinal tract, mucus is composed of glycan-covered proteins, or mucins, which are secreted by goblet cells to form a protective gel-like structure above the . Low levels of mucin or alterations in mucin glycans are associated with inflammation and colitis in mice and humans. Although current literature links microbes to the modulation of goblet cells and mucins, the molecular pathways involved are not yet fully understood. Using a combination of gnotobiotic mice and mucus-secreting cell lines, we have identified a human-derived microbe, , which adheres to intestinal mucus and secretes metabolites that upregulate the major mucin MUC2 and modulate goblet cell function. Unlike other  species,  does not extensively degrade mucin glycans and cannot grow on mucin alone. This work points to the potential of using  and similar mucin-friendly microbes as therapeutic agents for intestinal disorders with disruptions in the mucus barrier.Copyright © 2019 Engevik et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30355158>Lactobacillus plantarum 299v Supplementation Improves Vascular Endothelial Function and Reduces Inflammatory Biomarkers in Men With Stable Coronary Artery Disease.</a></h2><p>A strong association has emerged between the  microbiome and atherosclerotic disease. Our recent data suggest Lactobacillus plantarum 299v (Lp299v) supplementation reduces infarct size in male rats. Limited human data are available on the impact of Lp299v on the vasculature.To determine whether oral Lp299v supplementation improves vascular endothelial function and reduces systemic inflammation in humans with stable coronary artery disease (CAD).Twenty men with stable CAD consumed a drink containing Lp299v (20 billion CFU) once daily for 6 weeks. After a 4-week washout, subjects were given an option of additionally participating in a 10-day study of oral liquid vancomycin (250 mg QID). Vascular endothelial function was measured by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation. Before and after Lp299v, plasma short-chain fatty acids, trimethylamine oxide, and adipokine levels were measured. Additional plasma samples underwent unbiased metabolomic analyses using liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy. 16S rRNA sequencing was used to determine changes of the stool microbiome. Arterioles from patients with CAD were obtained, and endothelium-dependent vasodilation was measured by video microscopy after intraluminal incubation with plasma from Lp299v study subjects. Lp299v supplementation improved brachial flow-mediated dilation ( P=0.008) without significant changes in plasma cholesterol profiles, fasting glucose, or body mass index. Vancomycin did not impact flow-mediated dilation. Lp299v supplementation decreased circulating levels of IL (interleukin)-8 ( P=0.01), IL-12 ( P=0.02), and leptin ( P=0.0007) but did not significantly change plasma trimethylamine oxide concentrations ( P=0.27). Plasma propionate ( P=0.004) increased, whereas acetate levels decreased ( P=0.03). Post-Lp299v plasma improved endothelium-dependent vasodilation in resistance arteries from patients with CAD ( P=0.02).16S rRNA analysis showed the Lactobacillus genus was enriched in postprobiotic stool samples without other changes.Lp299v improved vascular endothelial function and decreased systemic inflammation in men with CAD, independent of changes in traditional risk factors and trimethylamine oxide. Circulating -derived metabolites likely account for these improvements and merit further study.URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov .

The functional role of IL-36R signalling in the intestine was addressed in experimental colitis and wound healing models in vivo by using mice with defective IL-36R signalling (-/-) or Myd88, neutralising anti-IL-36R antibodies, recombinant IL-36R ligands and RNA-seq genome expression analysis.Expression of IL-36α and IL-36γ was significantly elevated in active human IBD and experimental colitis. While IL-36γ was predominantly detected in nuclei of the intestinal , IL-36α was mainly found in the cytoplasm of CD14 inflammatory macrophages. Functional studies showed that defective IL-36R signalling causes high susceptibility to acute dextran sodium sulfate colitis and impairs wound healing. Mechanistically, IL-36R ligands released upon mucosal damage activated IL-36R colonic fibroblasts via Myd88 thereby inducing expression of chemokines, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-6. Moreover, they induced proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and expression of the antimicrobial protein lipocalin 2. Finally, treatment of experimental intestinal wounds with IL-36R ligands significantly accelerated mucosal healing in vivo.IL-36R signalling is activated upon intestinal damage, stimulates IECs and fibroblasts and drives mucosal healing. Modulation of the IL-36R pathway emerges as a potential therapeutic strategy for induction of mucosal healing in IBD.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

It must remain tightly balanced to allow nutrient absorption, but maintain barrier function and immune homoeostasis, a failure of which results in chronic infection or debilitating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The intestinal  mainly consists of absorptive enterocytes and secretory goblet and Paneth cells and has recently come to light as being an essential modulator of immunity as opposed to a simple passive barrier. Each epithelial sub-type can produce specific immune modulating factors, driving innate immunity to pathogens as well as preventing autoimmunity. The enteroendocrine cells comprise just 1% of this , but collectively form the bodies' largest endocrine system. The mechanisms of enteroendocrine cell peptide secretion during feeding, metabolism and nutrient absorption are well studied; but their potential interactions with the enriched numbers of surrounding immune cells remain largely unexplored. This review focuses on alterations in enteroendocrine cell number and peptide secretion during inflammation and disease, highlighting the few in depth studies which have attempted to dissect the immune driven mechanisms that drive these phenomena. Moreover, the emerging potential of enteroendocrine cells acting as innate sensors of intestinal perturbation and secreting peptides to directly orchestrate immune cell function will be proposed. In summary, the data generated from these studies have begun to unravel a complex cross-talk between immune and enteroendocrine cells, highlighting the emerging immunoendocrine axis as a potential target for therapeutic strategies for infections and inflammatory disorders of the intestine.© 2015 Authors; published by Portland Press Limited.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25629818>Modulation of Intestinal Epithelial Defense Responses by Probiotic Bacteria.</a></h2><p>Probiotics are live microorganisms, which when administered in food confer numerous health benefits.

The mechanism of probiotic action is an area of interest. Among all possible routes of modulation by probiotics of intestinal epithelial cell-mediated defense responses, modulations of intestinal barrier function, innate, and adaptive mucosal immune responses, as well as signaling pathways are considered to play important role in the intestinal defense responses against pathogenic bacteria. This review summarizes the beneficial effects of probiotic bacteria to intestinal health together with the mechanisms affected by probiotic bacteria: barrier function, innate, and adaptive defense responses such as secretion of mucins, defensins, trefoil factors, immunoglobulin A (IgA), Toll-like receptors (TLRs), cytokines,  associated lymphoid tissues, and signaling pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30808700>Cuts Both Ways: Proteases Modulate Virulence of Enterohemorrhagic .</a></h2><p>Enterohemorrhagic  (EHEC) is a major cause of foodborne gastrointestinal illness.

These features make M-cells attractive targets for oral drug delivery studies, but this has been poorly explored. New and reproducible tissue-like in vitro models for studying intestinal sampling and permeability mechanisms are needed. The combination of different cell players in such models offers improved microenvironments with higher physiologic relevance. Here, a tissue-engineered model was established, by co-culturing Caco-2 absorptive cells, HT29-MTX mucus-producing cells and Raji  lymphocytes. After 3 weeks of cell co-culture, the presence of M-like cells was evidenced by the loss of brush-border organization, detected by the lack of microvilli. The triple-culture model showed to be efficient for insulin transport, a process that was influenced by the tightness of junctions between epithelial cells and the presence of mucus and M-like cells.

Previously, we reported that Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats increased the abundance of Proteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria. However, theoretically, these Gram-negative bacteria may elevate lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels. Therefore, in this study we further investigated the potential mechanisms by which RYGB improves glucose homeostasis, endotoxemia, and inflammatory stress in ZDF rats.Rats were divided into three groups: (a) an RYGB group (RY); () a sham-operated group pair-fed with the RY group; and (c) a sham-operated group fed ad libitum. Changes in LPS, cytokine levels, intestinal permeability (evaluated using the fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran method), and intestinal epithelial tight junction proteins zona occludins (ZO)-1, occludin, and claudin-1 were assessed 10 weeks postoperatively.Rats that underwent RYGB exhibited sustained weight loss and reduced glucose, as well as lower cytokine and LPS concentrations, than rats in the control groups. In the colonic , ZO1 and claudin-1 (Cldn1) mRNA levels were higher in the RY than control groups. Intestinal permeability declined in the RY group and was positively correlated with LPS levels and negatively correlated with ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1 expression.The results demonstrate that RYGB can reduce the extent of endotoxemia and inflammation, which is associated with improved tight junction integrity and intestinal barrier strength. These effects may explain why a low level of inflammation is maintained after RYGB and the postoperative increase in Gram-negative bacteria.© 2019 Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27487076>Outer Membrane Vesicles from the Probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 and the Commensal ECOR12 Enter Intestinal Epithelial Cells via Clathrin-Dependent Endocytosis and Elicit Differential Effects on DNA Damage.</a></h2><p>Interactions between intestinal microbiota and the human host are complex. The  mucosal surface is covered by a mucin layer that prevents bacteria from accessing the epithelial cells. Thus, the crosstalk between microbiota and the host mainly rely on secreted factors that can go through the mucus layer and reach the . In this context, vesicles released by commensal strains are seen as key players in signaling processes in the intestinal mucosa. Studies with Gram-negative pathogens showed that outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are internalized into the host cell by endocytosis, but the entry mechanism for microbiota-derived vesicles is unknown. Escherichia coli strains are found as part of normal human  microbiota. In this work, we elucidate the pathway that mediate internalization of OMVs from the probiotic E.coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) and the commensal ECOR12 strains in several human intestinal epithelial cell lines. Time course measurement of fluorescence and microscopy analysis performed with rhodamine -R18-labeled OMVs in the presence of endocytosis inhibitors showed that OMVs from these strains enter epithelial cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Vesicles use the same endocytosis pathway in polarized epithelial monolayers. Internalized OMVs are sorted to lysosomal compartments as shown by their colocalization with clathrin and specific markers of endosomes and lysosomes. OMVs from both strains did not affect cell viability, but reduce proliferation of HT-29 cells. Labeling of 8-oxo-dG adducts in DNA revealed that neither OMVs from EcN nor from ECOR12 promoted oxidative DNA damage. In contrast, flow cytometry analysis of phosphorylated γH2AX evidenced that OMVs from the probiotic EcN significantly produced more double strand breaks in DNA than ECOR12 OMVs. The EcN genotoxic effects have been attributed to the synthesis of colibactin. However, it is not known how colibactin is exported and delivered into host cells. Whether colibactin is secreted via OMVs is an open question that needs further study.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28230606>Secretions of Bifidobacterium infantis and Lactobacillus acidophilus Protect Intestinal Epithelial Barrier Function.</a></h2><p>The secreted metabolites of probiotics are cytoprotective to intestinal  and have been shown to attenuate inflammation and reduce  permeability. The present study was designed to determine the protective effects of probiotic conditioned media (PCM) from Bifidobacterium infantis (BCM) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (LCM) on interleukin (IL)-1β-induced intestinal barrier compromise.The epithelial barrier was determined by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) across a Caco-2 cell monolayer using a Transwell model. The paracellular permeability was determined by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran flux. The expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins and nuclear factor-kappa  (NF-κ) p65 were determined using Western blot and the distribution of NF-κ p65 was determined by immunofluorescence staining.BCM and LCM induced a dose-dependent increase in Caco-2 TER after 4 and 24 hours of incubation (P < 0.05). The maximal increase of Caco-2 TER occurred at 4 hours of treatment with a PCM concentration of 15%. Preincubation with BCM and LCM for 4 hours significantly prevented the decrease of Caco-2 TER induced by 24 hours of stimulation with 10 ng/mL IL-1β. BCM and LCM decreased paracellular permeability in both stimulated and unstimulated Caco-2 monolayers (P < 0.05). IL-1β stimulation decreased occludin expression and increased claudin-1 expression in Caco-2 cells (P < 0.05), which was prevented in cells treated with BCM or LCM. The changes of claudin-1 expression in H4 cells were similar to Caco-2 cells in response to PCM treatment and IL-1β stimulation; however, a similar response in occludin was not demonstrated. The IL-1β-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κ p65 in Caco-2 cells was prevented by pretreatment with both PCMs.BCM and LCM protected the intestinal barrier against IL-1β stimulation by normalizing the protein expression of occludin and claudin-1 and preventing IL-1β-induced NF-κ activation in Caco-2 cells, which may be partly responsible for the preservation of intestinal permeability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30254647>Complex Network of NKT Cell Subsets Controls Immune Homeostasis in Liver and .</a></h2><p>The liver- immune axis is enriched in several innate immune cells, including innate-like unconventional and adaptive T cells that are thought to be involved in the maintenance of tolerance to -derived antigens and, at the same time, enable effective immunity against microbes.

Overwhelming experimental data suggest that while iNKT cells are pathogenic, type II NKT cells are protective in the liver.

In this study, we found that fusion of C-CPE with PspA augmented the antigenicity of C-CPE itself. These findings allowed us to hypothesize that fusion of C-CPE and another food poisoning vaccine act as a bivalent food poisoning vaccine. Therefore, we constructed an adjuvant-free bivalent vaccine against CPE and cholera toxin (CT), which is a major food poisoning in developing country, by genetically fusing CT  subunit to C-CPE. Because of the low antigenicity of C-CPE, immunization of mice with C-CPE alone did not induce C-CPE-specific immune responses. However, immunization with our vaccine induced both C-CPE- and CT-specific neutralizing antibody. The underlying mechanism of the augmented antigenicity of C-CPE included the activation of T cells by CTB. Moreover, neutralizing antibodies lasted for at least 48 weeks and the quality of the antibody was dependent on the binding activity of CTB-C-CPE to its receptors.

Disruption of this homeostasis is associated with disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the mechanisms of this process are not clear. We investigated how Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a conserved mammalian NAD-dependent protein deacetylase, senses environmental stress to alter intestinal integrity.We performed studies of mice with disruption of Sirt1 specifically in the intestinal  (SIRT1 iKO, villin-Cre+, Sirt1 mice) and control mice (villin-Cre-, Sirt1) on a C57BL/6 background. Acute colitis was induced in some mice by addition of 2.5% dextran sodium sulfate to drinking water for 5-9 consecutive days. Some mice were given antibiotics via their drinking water for 4 weeks to deplete their microbiota. Some mice were fed with a cholestyramine-containing diet for 7 days to sequester their bile acids. Feces were collected and proportions of microbiota were analyzed by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR. Intestines were collected from mice and gene expression profiles were compared by microarray and quantitative PCR analyses. We compared levels of specific mRNAs between colon tissues from age-matched patients with ulcerative colitis (n=10) vs without IBD (n=8, controls).Mice with intestinal deletion of SIRT1 (SIRT1 iKO) had abnormal activation of Paneth cells starting at the age of 5-8 months, with increased activation of NF-κ, stress pathways, and spontaneous inflammation at 22-24 months of age, compared with control mice. SIRT1 iKO mice also had altered fecal microbiota starting at 4-6 months of age compared with control mice, in part because of altered bile acid metabolism. Moreover, SIRT1 iKO mice with defective  microbiota developed more severe colitis than control mice. Intestinal tissues from patients with ulcerative colitis expressed significantly lower levels of SIRT1 mRNA than controls. Intestinal tissues from SIRT1 iKO mice given antibiotics, however, did not have signs of inflammation at 22-24 months of age, and did not develop more severe colitis than control mice at 4-6 months.In analyses of intestinal tissues, colitis induction, and  microbiota in mice with intestinal epithelial disruption of SIRT1, we found this protein to prevent intestinal inflammation by regulating the  microbiota. SIRT1 might therefore be an important mediator of host-microbiome interactions. Agents designed to activate SIRT1 might be developed as treatments for IBDs.Copyright © 2017 AGA Institute.

Then, in an experimental study of the free-living predatory soil mite Pergamasus longicornis (Berlese), quantitative micro-anatomical changes in the   are critically assessed from a temporal series of histological sections during and after feeding on larval dipteran prey. An argued functional synthesis based upon comparative kinetics is offered for verification in other mesostigmatids. Mid- and hind- epithelia cell types interconvert in a rational way dependent upon the physical consequences of ingestion, absorption and egestion. The fasted transitional pseudo-stratified  rapidly becomes first squamous on prey ingestion (by stretching), then columnar during digestion before confirmed partial disintegration ( 'lumenation') during egestion back to a pseudo-stratified state. Exponential processes within the mid- and endodermic hind- exhibit 'stiff' dynamics. Cells expand rapidly ([Formula: see text] 22.9-49.5 min) and vacuolate quickly ([Formula: see text] 1.1 h). Cells shrink very slowly ([Formula: see text] 4.9 days) and devacuolate gently ([Formula: see text] 1.0-1.7 days). Egestive cellular degeneration has an initial [Formula: see text] 7.7 h. Digestion appears to be triggered by maximum  expansion-estimated at 10 min post start of feeding. Synchrony with changes in  lumen contents suggests common changes in physiological function over time for the cells as a whole tightly-coupled . Distinct in architecture as a tissue over time the various constituent cell types appear functionally the same. Functional phases are: early fluid transportation (0-1 h) and extracellular activity (10-90 min); through rising food absorption (10 min to [Formula: see text] day); to slow intracellular meal processing and degenerative egestive waste material production (1 to [Formula: see text] days) much as in ticks. The same  is both absorptive and degenerative in role. The switch in predominant physiology begins 4 h after the start of feeding. Two separate pulses of clavate cells appear to be a mechanism to facilitate transport by increasing epithelial surface area in contact with the lumen. Free-floating cells may augment early extracellular lumenal digestion. Possible evidence for salivary enzyme alkaline-related extra-corporeal digestion was found. Giant mycetome-like cells were found embedded in the mid- wall. Anteriorly, the mid- behaves like a temporally expendable food processing tissue and minor long-term resistive store. Posteriorly the mid- behaves like a major assimilative/catabolic tissue and 'last-out' food depot (i.e., a 'hepatopancreas' function) allowing the mite to resist starvation for up to 3.5 weeks after a single meal. A 'conveyor-belt' wave of physiology (i.e., feeding and digestion, then egestion and excretion) sweeps posteriorly but not necessarily pygidially over time. Assimilation efficiency is estimated at 82%. The total feeding cycle time histologically from a single meal allowing for the bulk of intracellular digestion and egestive release is not 52.5 h but of the order of 6 days ([Formula: see text] total  emptyings per day), plus typically a further 3 days for subsequent excretion to occur. Final complete  system clearance in this cryptozooid may take much longer ([Formula: see text] days). A common physiology across the anactinotrichid acarines is proposed.

We recently described the existence of a new anatomical structure, the ' vascular barrier' (GVB), both in murine and human intestines that plays a fundamental role in avoiding indiscriminate trafficking of bacteria from the  into the blood circulation. The vascular barrier integrity could be altered by Salmonella typhimurium, a pathogen capable of systemic dissemination, through the modulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Here we have analyzed the differences in  endothelial gene expression profiles during Salmonella infection and have identified some interesting characteristics of endothelial to mesenchymal transition. These findings add new insights in the -liver axis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29330471>SLC26A3 (DRA) prevents TNF-alpha-induced barrier dysfunction and dextran sulfate sodium-induced acute colitis.</a></h2><p>SLC26A3 encodes a Cl/HCO ion transporter that is also known as downregulated in adenoma (DRA) and is involved in HCO/mucus formation. The role of DRA in the epithelial barrier has not been previously established. In this study, we investigated the in vivo and in vitro mechanisms of DRA in the colon epithelial barrier. Immunofluorescence (IF) and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) studies reveal that DRA binds directly to tight junction (TJ) proteins and affects the expression of TJ proteins in polarized Caco-2BBe cells. Similarly, DRA colocalizes with ZO-1 in the intestinal . Knockdown or overexpression of DRA leads to alterations in TJ proteins and epithelial permeability. In addition, TNF-α treatment downregulates DRA by activating NF-к and subsequently affecting intestinal epithelial barrier integrity. Furthermore, overexpression of DRA partly reverses the TNF-α-induced damage by stabilizing TJ proteins. Neutralization of TNF-α in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice demonstrates improved the outcomes, and the therapeutic effect of the TNF-α neutralizing mAb is mediated in part by the preservation of DRA expression. These data suggest that DRA may be one of the therapeutic targets of TNF-α. Moreover, DRA delivered by adenovirus vector significantly prevents the exacerbation of colitis and improves epithelial barrier function by promoting the recovery of TJ proteins in DSS-treated mice. In conclusion, DRA plays a role in protecting the epithelial barrier and may be a therapeutic target in  homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27029421>Immuno-physiological adaptations confer wax moth Galleria mellonella resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis.</a></h2><p>Microevolutionary mechanisms of resistance to a bacterial pathogen were explored in a population of the Greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella, selected for an 8.8-fold increased resistance against the entomopathogenic bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) compared with a non-selected (suspectible) line. Defense strategies of the resistant and susceptible insect lines were compared to uncover mechanisms underpinning resistance, and the possible cost of those survival strategies. In the uninfected state, resistant insects exhibited enhanced basal expression of genes related to regeneration and amelioration of Bt toxin activity in the midgut. In addition, these insects also exhibited elevated activity of genes linked to inflammation/stress management and immune defense in the fat body. Following oral infection with Bt, the expression of these genes was further elevated in the fat body and midgut of both lines and to a greater extent some of them in resistant line than the susceptible line. This gene expression analysis reveals a pattern of resistance mechanisms targeted to sites damaged by Bt with the insect placing greater emphasis on tissue repair as revealed by elevated expression of these genes in both the fat body and midgut . Unlike the susceptible insects, Bt infection significantly reduced the diversity and richness (abundance) of the  microbiota in the resistant insects. These observations suggest that the resistant line not only has a more intact midgut but is secreting antimicrobial factors into the  lumen which not only mitigate Bt activity but also affects the viability of other  bacteria. Remarkably the resistant line employs multifactorial adaptations for resistance to Bt without any detected negative trade off since the insects exhibited higher fecundity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31486062>Innervation and nerve-immune cell contacts in mouse Peyer's patches.</a></h2><p>Neural regulation of the function of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) relies on a delicate balance of the two divisions of its nervous system, namely, the intrinsic and extrinsic divisions. The intrinsic innervation is provided by the enteric nervous system (ENS), whereas the extrinsic innervation includes sympathetic/parasympathetic nerve fibers and extrinsic sensory nerve fibers. In the present study, we used immunofluorescent staining of neurofilament-heavy (NF-H) to reveal the distribution of nerve fibers and their associations with immune cells inside mouse Peyer's patches (PP), an essential part of -associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). Our results demonstrate (1) the presence of an extensive meshwork of NF-H-immunoreactive presumptive nerve fibers in all PP compartments including the lymphoid nodules, interfollicular region, follicle-associated , and subepithelial dome; (2) close associations/contacts of nerve fibers with blood vessels including high endothelial venules, indicating neural control of blood flow and immune cell dynamics inside the PP; (3) close contacts between nerve fibers/endings and /T cells and various subsets of dendritic cells ( e.g., B220-, B220+, CD4-, CD4+, CD8-, and CD8+). Our novel findings concerning PP innervation and nerve-immune-cell contacts in situ should facilitate our understanding of bi-directional communications between the PNS and GALT. Since the innervation of the , including PP, might be important in the pathogenesis and progression of some neurological, infectious, and autoimmune diseases, e.g., prion diseases and inflammatory bowel disease, better knowledge of PNS-immune system interactions in the GALT (including PP) should benefit the development of potential treatments for these diseases via neuroimmune manipulations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28267403>Antibiotics promote the sampling of luminal antigens and bacteria via colonic goblet cell associated antigen passages.</a></h2><p>Bacterial translocation is defined as the passage of live bacteria from the  lumen to distant sites.  commensal bacteria translocation has been attributed to 'leakiness', or 'barrier breach' of the intestinal , allowing live bacteria to cross an inappropriately permeable barrier and disseminate to distant sites. Alternatively, studies suggest dendritic cells directly capture luminal commensal bacteria and transport them to distant sites in the steady-state by extending dendrites between epithelial cells into the lumen. Recently we identified translocation of commensal  bacteria following antibiotics was associated with the formation of goblet cell associated antigen passages (GAPs) in the colon and dependent upon goblet cells (GCs). The translocation of native  commensal bacteria resulted in low-level inflammatory responses and potentiated mucosal damage in response to concurrent epithelial injury. Here we extend these observations and demonstrate properties of colonic GAPs and observations supporting their priority in the translocation of colonic commensal bacteria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25056659>Human buccal  acquires microbial hyporesponsiveness at birth, a role for secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor.</a></h2><p>Repetitive interaction with microbial stimuli renders epithelial cells (ECs) hyporesponsive to microbial stimulation. Previously, we have reported that buccal ECs from a subset of paediatric patients with Crohn's disease are not hyporesponsive and spontaneously released chemokines. We now aimed to identify kinetics and mechanisms of acquisition of hyporesponsiveness to microbial stimulation using primary human buccal .Buccal ECs collected directly after birth and in later stages of life were investigated. Chemokine release and regulatory signalling pathways were studied using primary buccal ECs and the buccal EC line TR146. Findings were extended to the intestinal mucosa using murine model systems.Directly after birth, primary human buccal ECs spontaneously produced the chemokine CXCL-8 and were responsive to microbial stimuli. Within the first weeks of life, these ECs attained hyporesponsiveness, associated with inactivation of the NF-κ pathway and upregulation of the novel NF-κ inhibitor SLPI but no other known NF-κ inhibitors. SLPI protein was abundant in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of hyporesponsive buccal ECs. Knock-down of SLPI in TR146-buccal ECs induced loss of hyporesponsiveness with increased NF-κ activation and subsequent chemokine release. This regulatory mechanism extended to the intestine, as colonisation of germfree mice elicited SLPI expression in small intestine and colon. Moreover, SLPI-deficient mice had increased chemokine expression in small intestinal and colonic ECs.We identify SLPI as a new player in acquisition of microbial hyporesponsiveness by buccal and intestinal  in the first weeks after microbial colonisation.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Since nutritional wellbeing of an individual is dependent on the nutrient harvesting capability of the  microbiome, it is important to understand how CAZyme repertoire in the  is influenced by factors like age, geography and food habits.This study reports a comprehensive in-silico analysis of CAZyme profiles in the  microbiomes of 448 individuals belonging to different geographies, using similarity searches of the corresponding  metagenomic contigs against the carbohydrate active enzymes database. The study identifies a core group of 89 CAZyme families that are present across 85% of the  microbiomes. The study detects several geography/age-specific trends in  CAZyme repertoires of the individuals. Notably, a group of CAZymes having a positive correlation with BMI has been identified. Further this group of BMI-associated CAZymes is observed to be specifically abundant in the Firmicutes phyla. One of the major findings from this study is identification of three distinct groups of individuals, referred to as 'CAZotypes', having similar CAZyme profiles. Distinct taxonomic drivers for these CAZotypes as well as the probable dietary basis for such trends have also been elucidated. The results of this study provide a global view of CAZyme profiles across individuals of various geographies and age-groups. These results reiterate the need of a more precise understanding of the role of carbohydrate active enzymes in human nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29360469> bacteria interaction with vagal afferents.</a></h2><p>Contemporary techniques including the use of germ-free models and next generation sequencing have deepened our understanding of the  microbiota dynamics and its influence on host physiology. There is accumulating evidence that the  microbiota can communicate to the CNS and is involved in the development of metabolic and behavioral disorders. Vagal afferent terminals are positioned beneath the   where they can receive, directly or indirectly, signals produced by the  microbiota, to affect host behavior, including feeding behavior. Supplementation with L. Rhamnosus in mice notably causes a decrease in anxiety and these effects are abolished by vagotomy. Additionally, chronic treatment with bacterial byproduct lipopolysaccharide (LPS) blunts vagally-mediated post-ingestive feedback and is associated with increased food intake. Inflammation in the nodose ganglion (NG), the location of vagal afferent neurons' cell bodies, may be a key triggering factor of microbiota-driven vagal alteration. Interestingly, several models show that vagal damage leads to an increase in immune cell (microglia) activation in the NG and remodeling of the vagal pathway. Similarly, diet-driven microbiota dysbiosis is associated with NG microglia activation and decreased vagal outputs to the CNS. Crucially, preventing dysbiosis and microglia activation in high-fat diet fed rodents normalizes vagal innervation and energy intake, highlighting the importance of microbiota/vagal communication in controlling feeding behavior. As of today, new consideration of potential roles for glial influence on vagal communication and new methods of vagal afferent ablation open opportunities to increase our understanding of how the  microbiota influence its host's health and behavior.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier .V.

No treatment is available to prevent chorioamnionitis-driven adverse intestinal outcomes. Evidence is increasing that plant sterols possess immune-modulatory properties. Therefore, we investigated the potential therapeutic effects of plant sterols in lambs intra-amniotically (IA) exposed to . Fetal lambs were IA exposed to  (, UP) for six days from 127 d-133 d of gestational age (GA). The plant sterols β-sitosterol and campesterol, dissolved with β-cyclodextrin (carrier), were given IA every two days from 122 d-131 d GA. Fetal circulatory cytokine levels,  inflammation, intestinal injury, enterocyte maturation, and mucosal phospholipid and bile acid profiles were measured at 133 d GA (term 150 d). IA plant sterol administration blocked a fetal inflammatory response syndrome. Plant sterols reduced intestinal accumulation of proinflammatory phospholipids and tended to prevent mucosal myeloperoxidase-positive (MPO) cell influx, indicating an inhibition of  inflammation. IA administration of plant sterols and carrier diminished intestinal mucosal damage, stimulated maturation of the immature , and partially prevented -driven reduction of mucosal bile acids. In conclusion, we show that β-sitosterol and campesterol administration protected the fetus against adverse  outcomes following UP-driven chorioamnionitis by preventing intestinal and systemic inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27371534>Hemidesmosome integrity protects the colon against colitis and colorectal cancer.</a></h2><p>Epidemiological and clinical data indicate that patients suffering from IBD with long-standing colitis display a higher risk to develop colorectal high-grade dysplasia. Whereas carcinoma invasion and metastasis rely on basement membrane (BM) disruption, experimental evidence is lacking regarding the potential contribution of epithelial cell/BM anchorage on inflammation onset and subsequent neoplastic transformation of inflammatory lesions. Herein, we analyse the role of the α6β4 integrin receptor found in hemidesmosomes that attach intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) to the laminin-containing BM.We developed new mouse models inducing IEC-specific ablation of α6 integrin either during development (α6) or in adults (α6).Strikingly, all α6 mutant mice spontaneously developed long-standing colitis, which degenerated overtime into infiltrating adenocarcinoma. The sequence of events leading to disease onset entails hemidesmosome disruption, BM detachment, IL-18 overproduction by IECs, hyperplasia and enhanced intestinal permeability. Likewise, IEC-specific ablation of α6 integrin induced in adult mice (α6) resulted in fully penetrant colitis and tumour progression. Whereas broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment lowered tissue pathology and IL-1β secretion from infiltrating myeloid cells, it failed to reduce Th1 and Th17 response. Interestingly, while the initial intestinal inflammation occurred independently of the adaptive immune system, tumourigenesis required  and T lymphocyte activation.We provide for the first time evidence that loss of IECs/BM interactions triggered by hemidesmosome disruption initiates the development of inflammatory lesions that progress into high-grade dysplasia and carcinoma. Colorectal neoplasia in our mouse models resemble that seen in patients with IBD, making them highly attractive for discovering more efficient therapies.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Fucosyltransferase (FUT) 2 and FUT3 determine expression of histo-blood group antigens in the  and may affect the intestinal microbiota. We investigated the association between FUT2 and FUT3 polymorphisms and UC in Chinese patients.We genotyped FUT2 (rs281377, rs1047781 and rs601338) and FUT3 (rs28362459, rs3745635 and rs3894326) in 485 UC patients and 580 healthy controls using SNaPshot. We also evaluated expression of Lewis a and  antigens in the sigmoid colon of 7 UC patients and 7 patients with benign colonic polyps.The frequencies of mutant allele (A) and genotype (GA+AA) in FUT3 (rs3745635) were higher in UC patients than controls (P = 0.016, 95%CI: 1.339-1.699; P = 0.038, 95%CI: 1.330-1.742, respectively).

Although expression of Lewis  antigen in the sigmoid colon did not differ between UC patients and controls, Lewis a antigen expression was higher in the cryptic  of both inflammatory and non-inflammatory sigmoid colon of UC patients than controls (P = 0.028).Our findings indicated that polymorphisms in FUT3 and its intestinal expression might be associated with UC pathogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30510170>Clostridium difficile toxins induce VEGF-A and vascular permeability to promote disease pathogenesis.</a></h2><p>Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is mediated by two major exotoxins, toxin A (TcdA) and toxin  (TcdB), that damage the colonic epithelial barrier and induce inflammatory responses. The function of the colonic vascular barrier during CDI has been relatively understudied. Here we report increased colonic vascular permeability in CDI mice and elevated vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), which was induced in vivo by infection with TcdA- and/or TcdB-producing C. difficile strains but not with a TcdATcdB isogenic mutant. TcdA or TcdB also induced the expression of VEGF-A in human colonic mucosal biopsies. Hypoxia-inducible factor signalling appeared to mediate toxin-induced VEGF production in colonocytes, which can further stimulate human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells. Both neutralization of VEGF-A and inhibition of its signalling pathway attenuated CDI in vivo. Compared to healthy controls, CDI patients had significantly higher serum VEGF-A that subsequently decreased after treatment. Our findings indicate critical roles for toxin-induced VEGF-A and colonic vascular permeability in CDI pathogenesis and may also point to the pathophysiological significance of the  vascular barrier in response to virulence factors of enteric pathogens. As an alternative to pathogen-targeted therapy, this study may enable new host-directed therapeutic approaches for severe, refractory CDI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25160818>The  microbiota engages different signaling pathways to induce Duox2 expression in the ileum and colon .</a></h2><p>The  is a first line of defense against microorganisms in the . Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have an important role in controlling the normal  microbiota and pathogenic bacteria. Dual oxidase 2 (DUOX2) is an important source of hydrogen peroxide in the small and large intestine, and the  microbiota induces Duox2 expression. Here, we investigated the microbial regulation of Duox2 expression. We found that Duox2 was expressed by intestinal epithelial cells mainly in the tip of the . Duox2 expression was strongly induced by the presence of a normal microbiota in mice, but not when germ-free mice were colonized with various commensal bacteria. Duox2 expression was more rapidly induced by the  microbiota in the colon than in the ileum. Furthermore, we showed that regulation of Duox2 expression in the ileum involved TIR-domain-containing adaptor protein including interferon-β (TRIF) and canonical nuclear factor-κ p50/p65 signaling, whereas regulation of Duox2 expression in the colon involved MyD88 and the p38 pathway.

Inversely, the effects of the microbiota on iron homeostasis have been little studied. So, we investigate whether the microbiota itself may alter host iron sensing. Duodenal cytochrome  and divalent metal transporter 1, involved in apical iron uptake, are 8- and 10-fold, respectively, more abundant in the duodenum of germ-free (GF) mice than in mice colonized with a microbiota. In contrast, the luminal exporter ferroportin is 2-fold less abundant in GF. The overall signature of microbiota on iron-related proteins is similar in the colon. The colonization does not modify systemic parameters as plasma transferrin saturation (20%), plasma ferritin (150 ng/L), and liver (85 µg/g) iron load. Commensal organisms (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482 and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii A2-165) and a probiotic strain (Streptococcus thermophilus LMD-9) led to up to 12-fold induction of ferritin in colon. Our data suggest that the intestinal cells of GF mice are depleted of iron and that following colonization, the epithelial cells favor iron storage.

However, most studies focus on immunity, with other defensive mechanisms being relatively overlooked. We have previously shown that the spider mite Tetranychus urticae does not mount an induced immune response towards systemic bacterial infections, entailing very high mortality rates. Therefore, we hypothesized that other defence mechanisms may be operating to minimize infection risk. Here, we test (a) if spider mites are also highly susceptible to other infection routes-spraying and feeding-and () if they display avoidance behaviours towards infected food. Individuals sprayed with or fed on Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas putida survived less than the control, pointing to a deficient capacity of the  , and possibly of the cuticle, to contain bacteria. Additionally, we found that spider mites prefer uninfected food to food contaminated with bacteria, a choice that probably does not rely on olfactory cues. Our results suggest that spider mites may rely mostly on avoidance behaviours to minimize bacterial infection and highlight the multi-layered nature of immune strategies present in arthropods.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31084433>Vitamin A and vitamin D regulate the microbial complexity, barrier function, and the mucosal immune responses to ensure intestinal homeostasis.</a></h2><p>Diet is an important regulator of the gastrointestinal microbiota. Vitamin A and vitamin D deficiencies result in less diverse, dysbiotic microbial communities and increased susceptibility to infection or injury of the gastrointestinal tract. The vitamin A and vitamin D receptors are nuclear receptors expressed by the host, but not the microbiota. Vitamin A- and vitamin D-mediated regulation of the intestinal  and mucosal immune cells underlies the effects of these nutrients on the microbiota. Vitamin A and vitamin D regulate the expression of tight junction proteins on intestinal epithelial cells that are critical for barrier function in the . Other shared functions of vitamin A and vitamin D include the support of innate lymphoid cells that produce IL-22, suppression of IFN-γ and IL-17 by T cells, and induction of regulatory T cells in the mucosal tissues. There are some unique functions of vitamin A and D; for example, vitamin A induces  homing receptors on T cells, while vitamin D suppresses  homing receptors on T cells.

CDX2 activation in IM is driven by reflux of bile acids and following chronic inflammation. But the mechanism underlying how bile acids activate CDX2 in gastric  has not been fully explored.We performed microRNA (miRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) profiling using microarray in cells treated with bile acids. Data integration of the miRNA/mRNA profiles with gene ontology (GO) analysis and bioinformatics was performed to detect potential miRNA-mRNA regulatory circuits. Transfection of gastric cancer cell lines with miRNA mimics and inhibitors was used to evaluate their effects on the expression of candidate targets and functions. Immunohistochemistry and in situhybridisation were used to detect the expression of selected miRNAs and their targets in IM tissue microarrays.We demonstrate a bile acids-triggered pathway involving upregulation of miR-92a-1-5p and suppression of its target FOXD1 in gastric cells. We first found that miR-92a-1-5p was increased in IM tissues and induced by bile acids. Moreover, miR-92a-1-5p was found to activate CDX2 and downstream intestinal markers by targeting FOXD1/FOXJ1 axis and modulating activation of nuclear factor kappa  (NF-κ) pathway. Furthermore, these effects were found to be clinical relevant, as high miR-92a-1-5p levels were correlated with low FOXD1 levels and high CDX2 levels in IM tissues.These findings suggest a miR-92a-1-5p/FOXD1/NF-κ/CDX2 regulatory axis plays key roles in the generation of IM phenotype from gastric cells. Suppression of miR-92a-1-5p and restoration of FOXD1 may be a preventive approach for gastric IM in patients with bile regurgitation.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

C. difficile infections (CDI) constitute a growing health problem with increasing rates of morbidity and mortality at groups of risk, such as elderly and hospitalized patients, but also in populations traditionally considered low-risk. This could be related to the occurrence of virulent strains which, among other factors, have high-level of resistance to fluoroquinolones, more efficient sporulation and markedly high toxin production. Several novel intervention strategies against CDI are currently under study, such as the use of probiotics to counteract the growth and/or toxigenic activity of C. difficile. In this work, we have analyzed the capability of twenty Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains, from human intestinal origin, to counteract the toxic effect of C. difficile LMG21717 upon the human intestinal epithelial cell line HT29. For this purpose, we incubated the bacteria together with toxigenic supernatants obtained from C. difficile. After this co-incubation new supernatants were collected in order to quantify the remnant A and  toxins, as well as to determine their residual toxic effect upon HT29 monolayers. To this end, the real time cell analyser (RTCA) model, recently developed in our group to monitor C. difficile toxic effect, was used. Results obtained showed that strains of Bifidobacterium longum and . breve were able to reduce the toxic effect of the pathogen upon HT29, the RTCA normalized cell-index values being inversely correlated with the amount of remnant toxin in the supernatant. The strain . longum IPLA20022 showed the highest ability to counteract the cytotoxic effect of C. difficile acting directly against the toxin, also having the highest capability for removing the toxins from the clostridial toxigenic supernatant. Image analysis showed that this strain prevents HT29 cell rounding; this was achieved by preserving the F-actin microstructure and tight-junctions between adjacent cells, thus keeping the typical -like morphology. Besides, preliminary evidence showed that the viability of . longum IPLA20022 is needed to exert the protective effect and that secreted factors seems to have anti-toxin activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590302>Mycotoxin Occurrence in Maize Silage-A Neglected Risk for Bovine  Health?</a></h2><p>Forages are important components of dairy cattle rations but might harbor a plethora of mycotoxins. Ruminants are considered to be less susceptible to the adverse health effects of mycotoxins, mainly because the ruminal microflora degrades certain mycotoxins. Yet, impairment of the ruminal degradation capacity or high ruminal stability of toxins can entail that the intestinal  is exposed to significant mycotoxin amounts. The aims of our study were to assess i) the mycotoxin occurrence in maize silage and ii) the cytotoxicity of relevant mycotoxins on bovine intestinal cells. In total, 158 maize silage samples were collected from European dairy cattle farms. LC-MS/MS-based analysis of 61 mycotoxins revealed the presence of emerging mycotoxins (e.g. emodin, culmorin, enniatin B1, enniatin , and beauvericin) in more than 70% of samples. Among the regulated mycotoxins, deoxynivalenol and zearalenone were most frequently detected (67.7%). Overall, 87% of maize silages contained more than five mycotoxins. Using an in vitro model with calf small intestinal epithelial cells , the cytotoxicity of deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, fumonisin B1 and enniatin  was evaluated (0-200 µM). Absolute IC50 values varied in dependence of employed assay and were 1.2-3.6 µM, 0.8-1.0 µM, 8.6-18.3 µM, and 4.0-6.7 µM for deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, fumonisin B1, and enniatin , respectively.

Here, we discovered a totally different activity of Bac: the neutralization of bacterial exotoxins. Bac prevented intoxication of mammalian cells with the binary enterotoxins Clostridium botulinum C2, C. perfringens ι, C. difficile transferase (CDT), and Bacillus anthracis lethal toxin. The transport () subunits of these toxins deliver their respective enzyme (A) subunits into cells. Following endocytosis, the  subunits form pores in membranes of endosomes, which mediate translocation of the A subunits into the cytosol. Bac inhibited formation of such  pores in lipid bilayers in vitro and in living cells, thereby preventing translocation of the A subunit into the cytosol. Bac preserved the epithelial integrity of toxin-treated CaCo-2 monolayers, a model for the human  . In conclusion, Bac should be discussed as a therapeutic option against infections with medically relevant toxin-producing bacteria, including C. difficile and . anthracis, because it inhibits bacterial growth and neutralizes the secreted toxins.-Schnell, L., Felix, I., Müller, ., Sadi, M., von Bank, F., Papatheodorou, P., Popoff, M.

In addition, two different aspects of probiotic administration, therapeutic and prophylactic test were also examined. Results showed that micro-organisms could inhibit expression of biomarkers and therapeutic culture conditions were more effective than prophylactic tests. The results obtained suggest that it is possible to incorporate the administration of probiotics in BO and OA prevention.© 2015 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29746173>Induction of  proteasome activity in hemorrhagic shock and its recovery by treatment with diphenyldihaloketones CLEFMA and EF24.</a></h2><p>Multiorgan failure in hemorrhagic shock is triggered by  barrier dysfunction and consequent systemic infiltration of proinflammatory factors. Our previous study has shown that diphenyldihaloketone drugs 4-[3,5-bis[(2-chlorophenyl)methylene]-4-oxo-1-piperidinyl]-4-oxo-2-butenoic acid (CLEFMA) and 3,5-bis[(2-fluorophenyl)methylene]-4-piperidinone (EF24) restore  barrier dysfunction and reduce systemic inflammatory response in hemorrhagic shock. We investigated the effect of hemorrhagic shock on proteasome activity of intestinal  and how CLEFMA and EF24 treatments modulate proteasome function in hemorrhagic shock. CLEFMA or EF24 (0.4 mg/kg) were given 1 h after withdrawing 50% of blood from Sprague-Dawley rats; no other resuscitation was provided. After another 5 h of compensation, small  was collected to process tissue for proteasome activity, immunoblotting, and mRNA levels of genes responsible for unfolded-protein response (XBP1, ATF4, glucose-regulated protein of 78/95 kDa, and growth arrest and DNA damage inducible genes 153/34), polyubiquitin  and C, and immunoproteasome subunits β type-8 and -10 and proteasome activator subunit 1. We found that hemorrhagic shock induced proteasome activity in  tissue and reduced the amounts of ubiquitinated proteins displayed on antiubiquitin immunoblots. However, simultaneous induction of unfolded-protein response or immunoproteasome genes was not observed. CLEFMA and EF24 treatments abolished the hemorrhagic shock-induced increase in proteasome activity. Further investigations revealed that the induction of proteasome in hemorrhagic shock is associated with disassembly of 26S proteasome; CLEFMA and EF24 prevented this disassembly. Consistent with these data, CLEFMA and EF24 reduced hemorrhagic shock-induced degradation of 20S substrate ornithine decarboxylase in  tissue. These results suggest that activated proteasome plays an important role in ischemic  pathophysiology, and it can be a druggable target in shock-induced  dysfunction. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Ischemic injury to the  is a trigger for the systemic inflammatory response and multiple organ failure in trauma and hemorrhagic shock. We show for the first time that hemorrhagic shock induces the  proteasome activity by engendering 26S proteasome disassembly. Diphenyldihaloketones 4-[3,5-bis[(2-chlorophenyl)methylene]-4-oxo-1-piperidinyl]-4-oxo-2-butenoic acid and 3,5-bis[(2-fluorophenyl)methylene]-4-piperidinone treatment prevented the 26S disassembly.

Based on computational docking studies, transcriptional activation experiments and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) protein immunofluorescence localization assays in cultured cells, 16α-hydroxytrametenolic acid (HTA) was discovered as a novel GR agonist in this study. HTA ameliorates TNF-α-induced Caco-2 monolayer intestinal epithelial barrier damage and suppressed activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase  (Akt), which attenuated downstream Iκ and nuclear factor kappa- (NF-κ) phosphorylation through GR activation. Moreover, HTA prevented NF-κ translocation into the nucleus and binding to its cis-element and suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced downstream NO production and pro-inflammatory cytokines at both protein and mRNA expression levels. In conclusion, HTA from  improves intestinal barrier function through a GR-mediated PI3K/Akt/NF-κ signaling pathway and may be potentially exploited as a supportive dietary therapeutic strategy for restoring  health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25608526>Methyl-deficient diet promotes colitis and SIRT1-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress.</a></h2><p>Methyl donor deficiency (MDD) aggravates experimental colitis in rats and increases endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress through decreased sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in neuronal cells and myocardium. ER stress plays a key role in IBD pathogenesis.We investigated whether the influence of MDD on colitis resulted from an ER stress response triggered by decreased SIRT1 expression.The unfolded protein response (UPR), chaperones proteins, heat shock factor protein 1 (HSF1) and SIRT1 were examined in rats with MDD and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in a Caco-2 cell model with stable expression of transcobalamin-oleosin (TO) chimera, which impairs cellular availability of vitamin B12, and in IBD. The effects of SIRT1 activation were studied both in vitro and in vivo.MDD aggravated DSS-induced colitis clinically, endoscopically and histologically. MDD activated ER stress pathways, with increased phosphorylate-PKR-like ER kinase, P-eiF-2α, P-IRE-1α, activating transcription factor (ATF)6, XBP1-S protein and ATF4 mRNA expression levels in rats. This was accompanied by reduced SIRT1 expression level and greater acetylation of HSF1, in relation with a dramatic decrease of chaperones (binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP), heat shock protein (HSP)27 and HSP90). Adding either vitamin B12, S-adenosylmethionine or an SIRT1 activator (SRT1720) reduced the UPR in vitro. In rats, SIRT1 activation by SRT1720 prevented colitis by reducing HSF1 acetylation and increasing expression of BIP, HSP27 and HSP90. Immunohistochemistry showed impaired expression of SIRT1 in the colonic  of patients with IBD.SIRT1 is a master regulator of ER stress and severity of experimental colitis in case of MDD. It could deserve further interest as a therapeutic target of IBD.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

During the neonatal stage, the intestinal  is under immune repression, allowing the transition for newborns from a relatively sterile intra-uterine environment to one that is rich in foreign antigens. The mechanism underlying such immune repression remains largely unclear, but involves downregulation of IRAK1 (interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase), an essential component of toll-like receptor-mediated NF-κ signaling. We report here that heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein I (hnRNPI), an RNA binding protein, is essential for regulating neonatal immune adaptation. We generated a mouse model in which hnRNPI is ablated specifically in the intestinal epithelial cells, and characterized intestinal defects in the knockout mice. We found that loss of hnRNPI function in mouse intestinal epithelial cells results in early onset of spontaneous colitis followed by development of invasive colorectal cancer. Strikingly, the -specific hnRNPI knockout neonates contain aberrantly high IRAK1 protein levels in the colons and fail to develop immune tolerance to environmental microbes. Our results demonstrate that hnRNPI plays a critical role in establishing neonatal immune adaptation and preventing colitis and colorectal cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27703009>Epithelial Cholesterol Deficiency Attenuates Human Antigen R-linked Pro-inflammatory Stimulation via an SREBP2-linked Circuit.</a></h2><p>Patients with chronic intestinal ulcerative diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, tend to exhibit abnormal lipid profiles, which may affect the  epithelial integrity. We hypothesized that epithelial cholesterol depletion may trigger inflammation-checking machinery via cholesterol sentinel signaling molecules whose disruption in patients may aggravate inflammation and disease progression. In the present study, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) as the cholesterol sentinel was assessed for its involvement in the epithelial inflammatory responses in cholesterol-depleted enterocytes. Patients and experimental animals with intestinal ulcerative injuries showed suppression in epithelial SREBP2. Moreover, SREBP2-deficient enterocytes showed enhanced pro-inflammatory signals in response to inflammatory insults, indicating regulatory roles of SREBP2 in  epithelial inflammation. However, epithelial cholesterol depletion transiently induced pro-inflammatory chemokine expression regardless of the well known pro-inflammatory nuclear factor-κ signals. In contrast, cholesterol depletion also exerts regulatory actions to maintain epithelial homeostasis against excessive inflammation via SREBP2-associated signals in a negative feedback loop. Mechanistically, SREBP2 and its induced target EGR-1 were positively involved in induction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a representative anti-inflammatory transcription factor. As a crucial target of the SREBP2-EGR-1-PPARγ-associated signaling pathways, the mRNA stabilizer, human antigen R (HuR) was retained in nuclei, leading to reduced stability of pro-inflammatory chemokine transcripts. This mechanistic investigation provides clinical insights into protective roles of the epithelial cholesterol deficiency against excessive inflammatory responses via the SREBP2-HuR circuit, although the deficiency triggers transient pro-inflammatory signals.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30426826>Immobilization of cadmium and lead by  GR-1 mitigates apical-to-basolateral heavy metal translocation in a Caco-2 model of the intestinal .</a></h2><p>Heavy metals are highly toxic elements that contaminate the global food supply and affect human and wildlife health. Purification technologies are often too expensive or not practically applicable for large-scale implementation, especially in impoverished nations where heavy metal contamination is widespread.  GR-1 (LGR-1) was shown in previous work to reduce heavy metal bioaccumulation in a Tanzanian cohort of women and children through indeterminant mechanisms. Here, it was hypothesized that LGR-1 could sequester the heavy metals lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd), thereby reducing their absorption across intestinal . LGR-1 and other lactobacilli significantly reduced the amount of Pb and Cd in solution at all concentrations tested (0.5 mg/L - 50 mg/L) and exhibited sustained binding profiles over a 48-hour period. Relative binding efficiency of LGR-1 decreased as Pb concentration increased, with an absolute minimum binding threshold apparent at concentrations of 2 mg/L and above. Electron microscopy revealed that Pb formed irregular cell-surface clusters on LGR-1, while Cd appeared to form intracellular polymeric clusters. Additionally, LGR-1 was able to significantly reduce apical-to-basolateral translocation of Pb and Cd in a Caco-2 model of the intestinal . These findings demonstrate the absorbent properties of LGR-1 can immobilize Pb and Cd, effectively reducing their translocation across the intestinal  .

CDX2, a transcription factor required to form intestinal , is a target of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated  cells (NF-κ) signalling, which can be inhibited by aspirin. We explored mechanisms underlying differences between NES- and NES-G cells in CDX2 expression and effects of aspirin on that CDX2 expression.We exposed NES- and NES-G cells to acid and bile salts, with and without aspirin, and evaluated effects on Iκ-NF-κ-PKAc complex activation, p65 NF-κ subunit function, and CDX2 expression.In both NES- and NES-G cells, acid and bile salts activated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase to generate HO, which activated the Iκ-NF-κ-PKAc complex. NES- cells exhibited higher levels of phosphorylated Iκ and p65 and greater NF-κ transcriptional activity than NES-G cells, indicating greater Iκ-NF-κ-PKAc complex activation by acid and bile salts in NES- cells, and p65 siRNA prevented their increased expression of CDX2. Aspirin blocked Iκ phosphorylation, p65 nuclear translocation, CDX2 promoter activation and CDX2 expression induced by acid and bile salts in NES- cells.Differences between NES- and NES-G cells in NF-κ activation by acid and bile salts can account for their differences in CDX2 expression, and their CDX2 expression can be blocked by aspirin. These findings might explain why some patients with GORD develop Barrett's oesophagus while others do not, and why aspirin might protect against development of Barrett's oesophagus.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Interleukin-22 binding protein (IL-22BP), provided by dendritic cells at the sub-epithelial dome region, inhibits the IL-22-mediated secretion of antimicrobial peptides by the FAE. The Notch signal from stromal cells underneath the FAE diminishes goblet cell differentiation. These events dampen the mucosal barrier functions to allow luminal microorganisms to readily gain access to the luminal surface of the FAE. Furthermore, receptor activator of nucleic factor-kappa  ligand (RANKL) from a certain stromal cell type induces differentiation into microfold (M) cells that specialize in antigen uptake in the mucosa. Microfold (M) cells play a key role in mucosal immune surveillance by actively transporting external antigens from the  lumen to the lymphoid follicle. The molecular basis of antigen uptake by M cells has been gradually identified in the last decade. For example, GPI-anchored molecules (e.g., glycoprotein 2 (GP2) and cellular prion protein (PrP)) and β1-integrin facilitate the transport of specific types of xenobiotics. The antigen transport by M cells initiates antigen-specific mucosal immune responses represented by the induction of secretory immunoglobulin A (S-IgA). Meanwhile, several invasive pathogens exploit M cells as a portal to establish a systemic infection. Recent findings have uncovered the molecular machinery of differentiation and functions of M cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30130441>AMPK in regulation of apical junctions and barrier function of intestinal .</a></h2><p>  covers the inner layer of the gastrointestinal tract and provides a physical barrier to separate the host from its external environment, and its barrier function is critical for maintaining host health. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) as a master regulator of energy metabolism plays a critical role in epithelial barrier function. AMPK activation promotes epithelial differentiation and facilitates cell polarity establishment, both of which strengthen epithelial barrier. In addition, AMPK promotes the assembly of tight junctions and adherens junctions by direct phosphorylation of proteins composing apical junctions, junctional anchors, and cytoskeletons.

However, direct interactions between intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and adipocytes have not been investigated, in part because IEC physiology is difficult to replicate in culture. In this study, we originally prepared intact, polarized, and cytokine responsive IEC monolayers from primary or induced pluripotent stem cell-derived intestinal organoids by simple and repeatable methods. When these physiological IECs were co-cultured with differentiated adipocytes in Transwell, pro-inflammatory genes were induced in both cell types, suggesting reciprocal inflammatory activation in the absence of immunocompetent cells. These inflammatory responses were blocked by nuclear factor-κ or signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 inhibition and by anti-tumor necrosis factor- or anti-interleukin-6-neutralizing antibodies. Our results highlight the utility of these monolayers for investigating IEC biology. Furthermore, this system recapitulates the intestinal -mesenteric fat signals that potentially trigger or worsen inflammatory disorders such as Crohn's disease and obesity-related enterocolitis.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

However, some individuals experience a range of symptoms in response to wheat ingestion, without the characteristic serological or histological evidence of coeliac disease. The aetiology and mechanism of these symptoms are unknown, and no biomarkers have been identified. We aimed to determine if sensitivity to wheat in the absence of coeliac disease is associated with systemic immune activation that may be linked to an enteropathy.Study participants included individuals who reported symptoms in response to wheat intake and in whom coeliac disease and wheat allergy were ruled out, patients with coeliac disease and healthy controls. Sera were analysed for markers of intestinal cell damage and systemic immune response to microbial components.Individuals with wheat sensitivity had significantly increased serum levels of soluble CD14 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein, as well as antibody reactivity to bacterial LPS and flagellin. Circulating levels of fatty acid-binding protein 2 (FABP2), a marker of intestinal epithelial cell damage, were significantly elevated in the affected individuals and correlated with the immune responses to microbial products. There was a significant change towards normalisation of the levels of FABP2 and immune activation markers in a subgroup of individuals with wheat sensitivity who observed a diet excluding wheat and related cereals.These findings reveal a state of systemic immune activation in conjunction with a compromised intestinal  affecting a subset of individuals who experience sensitivity to wheat in the absence of coeliac disease.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Nur77 is crucial in regulating the T helper 1/regulatory T-cell balance, is expressed in macrophages and drives M2 macrophage polarization. In this study we aimed to define the function of Nur77 in inflammatory bowel disease. In wild-type and Nur77-/- mice, colitis development was studied in dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)- and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced models. To understand the underlying mechanism, Nur77 was overexpressed in macrophages and  epithelial cells. Nur77 protein is expressed in colon tissues from Crohn's disease and Ulcerative colitis patients and colons from colitic mice in inflammatory cells and . In both mouse colitis models inflammation was increased in Nur77-/- mice. A higher neutrophil influx and enhanced IL-6, MCP-1 and KC production was observed in Nur77-deficient colons after DSS-treatment. TNBS-induced influx of T-cells and inflammatory monocytes into the colon was higher in Nur77-/- mice, along with increased expression of MCP-1, TNFα and IL-6, and decreased Foxp3 RNA expression, compared to wild-type mice. Overexpression of Nur77 in lipopolysaccharide activated RAW macrophages resulted in up-regulated IL-10 and downregulated TNFα, MIF-1 and MCP-1 mRNA expression through NFκ repression. Nur77 also strongly decreased expression of MCP-1, CXCL1, IL-8, MIP-1α and TNFα in  epithelial Caco-2 cells. Nur77 overexpression suppresses the inflammatory status of both macrophages and  epithelial cells and together with the in vivo mouse data this supports that Nur77 has a protective function in experimental colitis.

A wide array of chemoattractants, chemoattractant receptors, and adhesion molecules expressed by leukocytes, mucosal endothelium, , and stromal cells controls leukocyte recruitment and microenvironmental localization in intestine and in the -associated lymphoid tissues (GALTs). Naive lymphocytes traffic to the -draining mesenteric lymph nodes where they undergo antigen-induced activation and priming; these processes determine their memory/effector phenotypes and imprint them with the capacity to migrate via the lymph and blood to the intestines. Mechanisms of T-cell recruitment to GALT and of T cells and plasmablasts to the small intestine are well described. Recent advances include the discovery of an unexpected role for lectin CD22 as a -cell homing receptor GALT, and identification of the orphan G-protein-coupled receptor 15 (GPR15) as a T-cell chemoattractant/trafficking receptor for the colon. GPR15 decorates distinct subsets of T cells in mice and humans, a difference in species that could affect translation of the results of mouse colitis models to humans. Clinical studies with antibodies to integrin α4β7 and its vascular ligand mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 are proving the value of lymphocyte trafficking mechanisms as therapeutic targets for inflammatory bowel diseases. In contrast to lymphocytes, cells of the innate immune system express adhesion and chemoattractant receptors that allow them to migrate directly to effector tissue sites during inflammation.

Therefore, it has evolved the ability to breach the intestinal epithelial barrier to deploy an arsenal of effector proteins, which permits bacterial invasion and leads to a severe inflammatory response. However, the mechanisms used by Shigella to regulate epithelial barrier permeability remain unknown. To address this question, we used both an intestinal polarized model and a human ex-vivo model to further characterize the early events of host-bacteria interactions. Our results showed that secreted Serine Protease A (SepA), which belongs to the serine protease autotransporter of Enterobacteriaceae family, is responsible for critically disrupting the intestinal epithelial barrier. Such disruption facilitates bacterial transit to the basolateral pole of the , ultimately fostering the hallmarks of the disease pathology. SepA was found to cause a decrease in active LIM Kinase 1 (LIMK1) levels, a negative inhibitor of actin-remodeling proteins, namely cofilin. Correspondingly, we observed increased activation of cofilin, a major actin-polymerization factor known to control opening of tight junctions at the epithelial barrier. Furthermore, we resolved the crystal structure of SepA to elucidate its role on actin-dynamics and barrier disruption. The serine protease activity of SepA was found to be required for the regulatory effects on LIMK1 and cofilin, resulting in the disruption of the epithelial barrier during infection. Altogether, we demonstrate that SepA is indispensable for barrier disruption, ultimately facilitating Shigella transit to the basolateral pole where it effectively invades the .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31260331>Challenges in the management of HIV infection: update on the role of probiotic supplementation as a possible complementary therapeutic strategy for cART treated people living with HIV/AIDS.</a></h2><p>: Recent insights show that -mucosal immunity and intestinal microbiota play a key role in the pathogenesis of HIV infection.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study unveiling the adverse effects of NiO-NPs on a soil invertebrate (Eisenia fetida). Our findings clue towards looking extensively into the risks of NiO-NPs on soil organisms bearing agricultural and environmental significance.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Although all STEC strains produce Stx, only a few serotypes cause infection in humans. To determine which virulence traits in vitro are linked to human disease in vivo, 13 Stx2a-producing STEC strains of seropathotype (SPT) A or  (associated with severe human intestinal disease and outbreaks) and 6 strains of SPT D or E (rarely or not linked to human disease) were evaluated in a microaerobic human colonic epithelial infection model. All SPT strains demonstrated similar growth, colonization of polarized T84 colon carcinoma cells and Stx release into the medium. In contrast, Stx translocation across the T84 cell monolayer was significantly lower in SPT group DE compared to SPT group AB strains. Further experiments showed that Stx penetration occurred via a transcellular pathway and was independent of bacterial type III secretion and attaching and effacing lesion formation. These results suggest that the extent of Stx transcytosis across the   may represent an important indicator of STEC pathogenicity for humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29465310>Dietary starch breakdown product sensing mobilizes and apically activates α-glucosidases in small intestinal enterocytes.</a></h2><p>Dietary starch is finally converted to glucose for absorption by the small intestine mucosal α-glucosidases (sucrase-isomaltase [SI] and maltase-glucoamylase), and control of this process has health implications. Here, the molecular mechanisms were analyzed associated with starch-triggered maturation and transport of SI. Biosynthetic pulse-chase in Caco-2 cells revealed that the high MW SI species (265 kDa) induced by maltose (an α-amylase starch digestion product) had a higher rate of early trafficking and maturation compared with a glucose-induced SI (245 kDa). The maltose-induced SI was found to have higher affinity to lipid rafts, which are associated with enhanced targeting to the apical membrane and higher activity. Accordingly, in situ maltose-hydrolyzing action was enhanced in the maltose-treated cells. Thus, starch digestion products at the luminal surface of small intestinal enterocytes are sensed and accelerate the intracellular processing of SI to enhance starch digestion capacity in the intestinal lumen.-Chegeni, M., Amiri, M., Nichols, .

Defensins, including porcine β-defensin (pBD)2, are crucial antimicrobial peptides for  protection owing to their antibacterial and immunomodulatory activities. The purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effects of pBD2 on mucosal injury and the disruption of the epithelial barrier during the pathological process of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. The effects and mechanism of pBD2 were evaluated both using a DSS-induced C57BL/6 mouse model and, in vitro, using Caco-2 and RAW264.7 cells. DSS-induced colitis was characterized by higher disease activity index, shortened colon length, elevated activities of myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase, histologic evidence of inflammation, and increased expression levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8. pBD2 increased the expression of zonula occludens-1, zonula occludens-2, claudin-1, mucin-1, and mucin-2 mRNA and proteins, and it decreased permeability to FITC-D, as well as apoptosis, in DSS-treated mice. pBD2 also decreased inflammatory infiltrates of the colon . In Caco-2 cells, pBD2 increased transepithelial electrical resistance and mucin mRNA expression, and it decreased the permeability of FITC-D while preserving the structural integrity of the tight junctions. The effects of pBD2 appeared to be through upregulation of the expression of genes associated with tight junctions and mucins, and by suppressing DSS-induced increases in inflammation, inducible NO synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, and apoptosis. These results show that pBD2 improves DSS-induced changes in mucosal lesions and paracellular permeability, possibly by affecting the activation of NF-κ signaling. The present study demonstrates that intrarectal administration of pBD2 may be a novel preventive option for ulcerative colitis.Copyright © 2015 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26153762>Responsive population dynamics and wide seeding into the duodenal lamina propria of transglutaminase-2-specific plasma cells in celiac disease.</a></h2><p>A hallmark of celiac disease is autoantibodies to transglutaminase 2 (TG2). By visualizing TG2-specific antibodies by antigen staining of affected  tissue, we identified TG2-specific plasma cells in the lamina propria as well as antibodies in the subepithelial layer, inside the , and at the brush border. The frequency of TG2-specific plasma cells were found not to correlate with serum antibody titers, suggesting that antibody production at other sites may contribute to serum antibody levels. Upon commencement of a gluten-free diet, the frequency of TG2-specific plasma cells in the lesion dropped dramatically within 6 months, yet some cells remained. The frequency of TG2-specific plasma cells in the celiac lesion is thus dynamically regulated in response to gluten exposure. Laser microdissection of plasma cell patches, followed by antibody gene sequencing, demonstrated that clonal cells were seeded in distinct areas of the mucosa. This was confirmed by immunoglobulin heavy chain repertoire analysis of plasma cells isolated from individual biopsies of two untreated patients, both for TG2-specific and non-TG2-specific cells.

These inflammation-silencing effects are associated with . vulgatus mpk-mediated induction of semi-mature dendritic cells, especially in the colonic lamina propria (cLP). However the beneficial interaction of bacteria with host immune cells is limited due to the existence of a large mucus layer covering the intestinal . How can intestinal bacteria overcome this physical barrier and contact the host immune system? One mechanism is the production of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) via ubiquitous blebbing of the outer membrane. These proteoliposomes have the ability to traverse the mucus layer. Hence, OMVs play an important role in immunomodulation and the maintenance of a balanced  microbiota. Here we demonstrate that the stimulation of bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) with isolated OMVs originated from . vulgatus mpk leads to the induction of a tolerant semi-mature phenotype. Thereby, microbe- associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) delivered by OMVs are crucial for the interaction and the resulting maturation of immune cells. Additional to the binding to host TLR4, a yet unknown ligand to TLR2 is indispensable for the conversion of immature BMDCs into a semi-mature state. Thus, crossing the epithelial mucus layer and directly contact host cells, OMV mediate cross-tolerance via the transport of various Toll-like receptor antigens. These features make OMVs to a key attribute of . vulgatus mpk for a vigorous acellular prevention and treatment of systemic diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29087765>Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli is phagocytosed by macrophages underlying villus-like intestinal epithelial cells: modeling ex vivo innate immune defenses of the human .</a></h2><p>There is a paucity of information on diarrheagenic enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC)'s interaction with innate immune cells, in part due to the lack of reliable models that recapitulate infection in human .

The isolate was identified based on the morphological, physiological, biochemical and molecular characters. LD value with intramuscular injection was determined as 2.6 × 10 cfu/shrimp and sequential pathology was studied giving 6.1 × 10 cfu/shrimp (LD). Total plate count (TPC) and total Vibrio count (TVC) in water, pond sediment, haemolymph, muscle, HP and  were found significantly (P < 0.01) higher in natural cases than the experimental set up. Clinical signs and lesions observed in the natural and experimental cases were anorexia, lethargy, cuticle softening, loose shells, abdominal muscle cramp, red discoloration, opaque and whitish abdominal and tail musculature, necrosis of exoskeleton or splinter burns, reddish pleural borders of antennae, uropods and telson, swollen tail fan, ulcers, moribund shrimp sinking to bottom, and mortalities with shrunken discoloured HP with empty . Total haemocyte count (THC), small nongranular haemocyte (SNGH), large nongranular haemocyte (LNGH), small granular haemocyte (SGH) and large granular haemocyte (LGH) counts lowered significantly (P < 0.01) at 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96 and 192 h post injection (p.i). No LGH were found after 96 h of challenge. The post injection qPCR analyses of haemocytes showed up-regulations of penaeidin-3a, lysozyme, prophenoloxidase I, prophenoloxidase II and serine protein at 3 and 6 h of infection. There was total down-regulation of crustin from 3 to 192 h p.i. There was a remarkable elevation in the level of proPO I with concomitant depletion of proPO II. The pattern of up- and down-regulations in proPO I and SP were similar. The post infection qPCR analyses showed that these immune related genes could be used as markers for assessing the immune status of P. vannamei. Major histopathological manifestations observed were haemocyte infiltration/nodule in the epidermis, skeletal and cardiac muscles, atrophy of the excretory organ, and disrupted HP tubules with diffuse interstitial edema and haemocytic infiltration. Further HP showed that there was thickening of intertubular space, karyomegaly with prominent nucleoli, rounding and sloughing of HP tubular , many mitotic figures with bacterial colonies and apoptotic bodies, separation of shrunken tubule  from myoepithelial fibers, regeneration of tubules, cystic, dilated and vacuolated appearance of HP tubules, hypoplastic changes in the tubules with no , R and F cells, granuloma formation, concretions in tubules, calcification, necrosis, and washed out appearance with complete loss of architecture. The progression of the degenerative changes in the HP tubular epithelial cells was from proximal to distal end. In haematopoietic organ, increased mitotic activities with focal to extensive depletion and degeneration were observed. Degeneration of the stromal matrix with spheroid formation in lymphoid organ was observed among the Vp infected natural and experimental animals. Degeneration of glandular structures in the prehensile appendages with bacterial colonies, melanization and loss of epithelial layer in oesophagus, swelling and loss of architecture with mucinous secretion in the stomach, degeneration of peritrophic membrane in the lumen of intestine were observed in field cases but not in the experimental studies.

Polarized basolateral intestinal secretion of inflammatory mediators, followed by activation of NF- signaling and inflammatory pathways in endothelial cells, efficiently triggers extravasation of neutrophils from the vasculature, therefore contributing to the development and maintenance of intestinal inflammation. Proper regulation of NF- activation at the epithelial interface is crucial for the maintenance of physiological tissue homeostasis. Many papers reported that anthocyanins, a group of compounds belonging to flavonoids, possess anti-inflammatory effects and modulate NF- activity. In this study, by using a coculture in vitro system, we aimed to evaluate the effects of TNF--stimulated intestinal cells on endothelial cells activation, as well as the protective effects of cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G). In this model, TNF- induced nuclear translocation of NF- and TNF- and IL-8 gene expression in Caco-2 cells, whereas C3G pretreatment dose-dependently reduced these effects. Furthermore, TNF--stimulated Caco-2 cells induced endothelial cells activation with increased E-selectin and VCAM-1 mRNA, leukocyte adhesion, and NF- levels in HUVECs, which were inhibited by C3G. We demonstrated that selective inhibition of the NF- pathway in epithelial cells represents the main mechanism by which C3G exerts these protective effects.

Preterm infants exhibit defects in  maturation, weak innate immunity against intestinal infection and increased susceptibility to inflammatory disorders, all of which may be related to the inappropriate microbial colonization of their immature intestines. The earliest microbes to colonize the preterm infant  encounter a naïve, immature intestine. Thus this earliest microbiota potentially has the greatest opportunity to fundamentally influence intestinal development and immune function. The aim of this study was to characterize the effect of early microbial colonization on global gene expression in the distal small intestine during postnatal  development.Gnotobiotic mouse models with experimental colonization by early (prior to two weeks of life) intestinal microbiota from preterm human infants were utilized. Microarray analysis was used to assess global gene expression in the intestinal .Multiple intestinal genes involved in metabolism, cell cycle regulation, cell-cell or cell-extracellular matrix communication, and immune function are developmental- and intestinal microbiota- regulated. Using a humanized gnotobiotic mouse model, we demonstrate that certain early preterm infant microbiota from prior to 2 weeks of life specifically induce increased NF-κ activation and a phenotype of increased inflammation whereas other preterm microbiota specifically induce decreased NF-κ activation. These fundamental differences correlate with altered clinical outcomes and suggest the existence of optimal early microbial communities to improve health outcomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27190155>Cytotoxic damage of soybean agglutinin on intestinal epithelial cells of broiler chicks: in vitro protection by Bifidobacterium infantis CRL1395.</a></h2><p>Plant lectins, which are proteins/glycoproteins present in a wide range of vegetables, fruits, cereals and beans, are resistant to digestive enzymes and food cooking temperatures.

Studies of mice lacking p38α in several different cell types have demonstrated that p38α signaling is essential to maintaining the proliferation-differentiation balance in developing and steady-state tissues. The mechanisms underlying these roles involve cell-autonomous control of signaling and gene expression by p38α. In this study, we show that p38α regulates -associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) formation in a noncell-autonomous manner. From an investigation of mice with intestinal epithelial cell-specific deletion of the p38α gene, we find that p38α serves to limit NF-κ signaling and thereby attenuate GALT-promoting chemokine expression in the intestinal . Loss of this regulation results in GALT hyperplasia and, in some animals, mucosa-associated  cell lymphoma. These anomalies occur independently of luminal microbial stimuli and are most likely driven by direct epithelial-lymphoid interactions.

Their high hatching success seems to be linked to their proteins or perivitellins, which surround the developing embryo providing nutrients, sunscreens and varied defenses. The defensive mechanism has been unveiled in P. canaliculata and P. maculata eggs, where their major perivitellins are pigmented, non-digestible and provide a warning coloration while another perivitellin acts as a toxin. In P. scalaris, a species sympatric to the former, the defense strategy seems different, since no toxin was found and the major perivitellin, PsSC, while also colored and non-digestible, is a carbohydrate-binding protein. In this study we examine the structure and function of PsSC by sequencing its subunits, characterizing its carbohydrate binding profile and evaluating its effect on  cells. Whereas cDNA sequencing and database search showed no lectin domain, glycan array carbohydrate binding profile revealed a strong specificity for glycosphingolipids and ABO group antigens. Moreover, PsSC agglutinated bacteria in a dose-dependent manner. Inspired on the defensive properties of seed lectins we evaluated the effects of PsSC on intestinal cells both in vitro (Caco-2 and IEC-6 cells) and in the gastrointestinal tract of rats. PsSC binds to Caco-2 cell membranes without reducing its viability, while a PsSC-containing diet temporarily induces large  alterations and an increased absorptive surface.

The gastrointestinal tract is home to a vast population of commensal bacteria and numerous studies have demonstrated a symbiotic relationship between intestinal bacteria and intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) in maintaining homeostatic functions of the intestine. However, whether enteric bacteria play a role in DOXO-induced damage is not well understood.

DOXO administration induced significant increases in apoptosis in jejunal  regardless of the presence of enteric bacteria; however, the resulting injury, as demonstrated by statistically significant changes in crypt depth, crypt number, and proliferative cell number, was dependent upon the presence of enteric bacteria. Furthermore, we observed expansion of Paneth and goblet cells and presence of intermediate cells only in CONV and not GF mice.

Tremendous progress has been made in exploring the interactions between nutrients, the microbiome, and the intestinal, -enteric nervous, endocrine and immune systems and the brain. The basis of the -brain axis comprises of an array of multichannel sensing and trafficking pathways that are suggested to convey the enteric signals to the brain. These are mediated by neuroanatomy (represented by the vagal and spinal afferent neurons), the neuroendocrine-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (represented by the  hormones), immune routes (represented by multiple cytokines), microbially-derived neurotransmitters, and finally the gate keepers of the intestinal and brain barriers.

Metallopro-teinase II (MPII) and fragilysin (FRA) are the structurally related enzymes encoded by the pathogenicity island in the enterotoxigenic strains. Accordingly, there is a significant overlap between the cleavage preferences of MPII and FRA. These proteinases, however, are counter-transcribed in the bacterial genome suggesting their distinct and specialized functions in the course of infection. It is well established that FRA directly cleaves E-cadherin, a key protein of the cell-to-cell adhesion junctions in the intestinal . Counterintuitively, MPII directly binds to, rather than cleaves, E-cadherin. Structural modeling suggested that a potential E-cadherin binding site involves the C-terminal -helical region of the MPII catalytic domain. The sequence of this region is different in MPII and FRA. Here, we employed substitution mutagenesis of this C-terminal -helical region to isolate the MPII mutants with the potentially inactivated E-cadherin binding site. Overall, as a result of our modeling, mutagenesis and binding studies, we determined that the C-terminal ten residue segment is essential for the binding of MPII, but not of FRA3, to E-cadherin, and that the resulting MPII•E-cadherin complex does not impair E-cadherin-dependent cell-to-cell contacts. It is possible to envision that the putative cleavage targets of MPII should be explored not only on the host cell surface but also in . .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26555459>Two highly adhesive lactic acid bacteria strains are protective in zebrafish infected with Aeromonas hydrophila by evocation of  mucosal immunity.</a></h2><p>To increase the knowledge of probiotic effects and potential mechanisms, we report on the use of the zebrafish model to investigate the in vivo colonization ability, as well as the protective effects associated with  mucosal immune barrier and responses against Aeromonas hydrophila infection of previously characterized probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains, Bacillus coagulans 09·712 and Lactobacillus plantarum 08·923, in comparison with that of three commercialized strains.The results indicated differential adhesion capabilities, and . coagulans and Lact. plantarum strains exhibited a more robust adhesion capability based on fluorescence observation.

Here, we characterise a conditionally immortalised canine intestinal epithelial cell (cIEC) line for use in in vitro assays, to assess the effect of food ingredients on intestinal barrier function, permeability, cell health, and inflammation. Microscopy and flow cytometry confirmed that cIECs had a phenotype consistent with those of epithelial origin, and were able to differentiate to mature enterocytes. The cIECs also formed a monolayer when grown on Transwell® inserts, producing functional tight junctions between the cells. In contrast to the human-derived Caco-2 cell line, transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was increased in cIECs in response to two different raw ingredients. The exposure of cIECs to known inflammatory stimuli and raw ingredients induced the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated -cells (NF-?).

Using Latin hypercube sampling and Monte Carlo simulations for parameter estimation, we fit our model to human immune data from two Shigella EcSf2a-2 vaccine trials and a rechallenge study in which antibody and -cell responses against Shigella's lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and O-membrane proteins (OMP) were recorded. The clinically grounded model is used to mathematically investigate which key immune mechanisms and bacterial targets confer immunity against Shigella and to predict which humoral immune components should be elicited to create a protective vaccine against Shigella. The model offers insight into why the EcSf2a-2 vaccine had low efficacy and demonstrates that at a group level a humoral immune response induced by EcSf2a-2 vaccine or wild-type challenge against Shigella's LPS or OMP does not appear sufficient for protection. That is, the model predicts an uncontrolled infection of  epithelial cells that is present across all best-fit model parameterizations when fit to EcSf2a-2 vaccine or wild-type challenge data. Using sensitivity analysis, we explore which model parameter values must be altered to prevent the destructive epithelial invasion by Shigella bacteria and identify four key parameter groups as potential vaccine targets or immune correlates: 1) the rate that Shigella migrates into the lamina propria or , 2) the rate that memory  cells (BM) differentiate into antibody-secreting cells (ASC), 3) the rate at which antibodies are produced by activated ASC, and 4) the Shigella-specific BM carrying capacity.

Their potential has recently led to a significant increase in research interest in their effects on the intestine, mainly by reinforcing the intestinal  and modulating the  microbiota. This study aimed to evaluate the probiotic features of Lactobacillus plantarum strain L15 based on adhesive properties for the inhibition of the adhesion of infectious pathogens. The molecular identification of the strain was performed from the sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA with 27FYM and 1492R primers, and its probiotic features, including resistance to gastric juices, resistance to bile salts, and hydrophobicity were evaluated. The potential of Lactobacillus plantarum strain L15 to adhere to human adenocarcinoma intestinal cell line, Caco-2, as well as the auto and co-aggregation and anti-adherence activity against Escherichia coli were investigated. The results demonstrated that this strain has a desirable potential for passing through the low pH of the stomach and entering the intestines. Moreover, 54% hydrophobicity, 44% auto-aggregation, and 32% co-aggregation were observed for this strain. The adhesion level of Lactobacillus plantarum strain L15 to Caco-2 cells was 12%, and adhered lactobacilli cells were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Furthermore, this strain showed appropriate anti-adherence effects, including competition, inhibition, and replacement properties against Escherichia coli.

When CVB1 was introduced into the -lined intestinal lumen of the device, virions entered the , replicated inside the cells producing detectable cytopathic effects (CPEs), and both infectious virions and inflammatory cytokines were released in a polarized manner from the cell apex, as they could be detected in the effluent from the epithelial microchannel. When the virus was introduced via a basal route of infection (by inoculating virus into fluid flowing through a parallel lower 'vascular' channel separated from the epithelial channel by a porous membrane), significantly lower viral titers, decreased CPEs, and delayed caspase-3 activation were observed; however, cytokines continued to be secreted apically. The presence of continuous fluid flow through the epithelial lumen also resulted in production of a gradient of CPEs consistent with the flow direction. Thus, the human -on-a-Chip may provide a suitable in vitro model for enteric virus infection and for investigating mechanisms of enterovirus pathogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26070365>Impact of dextran sulphate sodium-induced colitis on the intestinal transport of the colon carcinogen PhIP.</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer is one of the most frequent cancers in Western countries. Chronic intestinal diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, in which the intestinal barrier is massively disturbed, significantly raise the risk of developing a colorectal tumour. 2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-]pyridine (PhIP) is a genotoxic heterocyclic aromatic amine that is formed after strongly heating fish and meat.

However, the link between obesity-associated microbiota and gastric pathogenesis has not been clarified. We demonstrated that high-fat-diet (HFD) feeding causes intestinal metaplasia, which are precancerous lesions of the stomach, with augmented gastric leptin signaling. The aim of this study was to investigate the precise role of leptin signaling in the altered microbiota composition and pathogenesis in the stomach during diet-induced obesity.Male C57 BL/6 J, leptin receptor (Lepr)-mutated db/db, and gastrointestinal -specific Lepr conditional knockout (T3 -Lepr cKO) mice were fed a HFD or control diet. Gastrointestinal microbiota was analyzed by 16 S rRNA gene sequences and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Transplantation of gastric microbiota of HFD-fed mice was performed to evaluate metaplasia onset in recipient mice.One week of HFD caused severe microbial dysbiosis in the stomach. The microbiota changes were accompanied by increased gastric leptin, leading to the consequent development of intestinal metaplasia. Transplantation of gastric microbiota from HFD-fed mice induced intestinal metaplasia in recipient mice; however, only a limited effect on pathogenesis was noted. HFD-fed db/db mice did not show a decrease in microbial abundance. Moreover, T3 -Lepr cKO mice failed spontaneous obesity, and suppressed decreased abundance of gastric microbiota and occurrence of intestinal metaplasia during HFD feeding similar to db/db mice.Gastric leptin signaling modulates the gastric microbiota community and regulates the pathogenesis in the gastric mucosa.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Here, the planktonic filter feeder Daphnia magna was used to track routes of uptake and target tissues of polystyrene nanoparticles (PSNPs). A sublethal concentration of 5 mg L fluorescent PSNPs (25 nm) was used to monitor accumulation in adult animals as well as their embryos in the open brood pouch.

One possible mechanism is that the microbiota may attenuate the severity of disease by specific metabolite-mediated regulation of host inflammation and injury. The microbiota-derived tryptophan-metabolite indole is abundant in the healthy mammalian  and positively influences intestinal health. We thus examined the effects of indole administration on NSAID enteropathy. Mice (n = 5 per group) were treated once daily for 7 days with an NSAID (indomethacin; 5 mg/kg), indole (20 mg/kg), indomethacin plus indole, or vehicle only (control).

The final concentration of . cereus in the simulated lumen at 8 h of incubation was 6.62 ± 0.87 log CFU ml(-1). At that point, the percentage of adhesion was approximately 6%.

Despite this, the molecular basis of host-pathogen and host-symbiont interactions in the human intestine remains poorly understood owing to the limited availability of human tissue, and the biological complexity of host-microbe interactions. Over the past decade, technological advances have enabled long-term culture of organotypic intestinal tissue derived from human subjects and from human pluripotent stem cells, and these in vitro culture systems already have shown the potential to inform our understanding significantly of host-microbe interactions.

However, the physiological impact of bioactive nitrogen oxides produced from dietary nitrate has remained largely elusive. Here, we report a hitherto unrecognized nitrite-dependent nitrating pathway that targets tight junction proteins in the stomach. Inorganic nitrate, nitrite or saliva obtained after the consumption of lettuce were administered by oral gavage to Wistar rats. The enterosalivary circulation of nitrate was allowed to occur for 4 h after which the animals were euthanized and the stomach collected. Nitrated occludin was detected by immunoprecipitation in the gastric  upon inorganic nitrite administration (p < .05) but was not observed in the case of inorganic nitrate or human saliva administration. This observation, along with differences in NO production rates from inorganic and salivary nitrite under simulated gastric conditions, suggests that competing reactions at acidic pH determine the production of nitrating agents (NO) or other, more stable, oxides. Accordingly, it is shown in vitro that salivary nitrite yields higher steady state concentrations of NO (0.37 ± 0.01 μM) than sodium nitrite (0.12 ± 0.03 μM). Dietary-dependent reactions involving the production of nitrogen oxides should be further investigated as, in the context of occludin nitration, the consumption of green leafy vegetables (with high nitrate content), if able to modulate  barrier function, may have important implications in the context of leaky  disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27181920>Translocation of 40 nm diameter nanowires through the intestinal  of Daphnia magna.</a></h2><p>Nanowires (NWs) have unique electrical and optical properties of value for many applications including lighting, sensing, and energy harnessing. Consumer products containing NWs increase the risk of NWs being released in the environment, especially into aquatic ecosystems through sewage systems. Daphnia magna is a common, cosmopolitan freshwater organism sensitive to toxicity tests and represents a likely entry point for nanoparticles into food webs of aquatic ecosystems. Here we have evaluated the effect of NW diameter on the  penetrance of NWs in Daphnia magna. The animals were exposed to NWs of two diameters (40 and 80 nm) and similar length (3.6 and 3.8 μm, respectively) suspended in water. In order to locate the NWs in Daphnia, the NWs were designed to comprise one inherently fluorescent segment of gallium indium phosphide (GaInP) flanked by a gallium phosphide (GaP) segment. Daphnia mortality was assessed directly after 24 h of exposure and 7 days after exposure. Translocation of NWs across the intestinal  was investigated using confocal fluorescence microscopy directly after 24 h of exposure and was observed in 89% of Daphnia exposed to 40 nm NWs and in 11% of Daphnia exposed to 80 nm NWs.

In this review we will summarize recent literature regarding the role of -lymphocytes and immunoglobulins in  immunity in teleost fish, with specific focus on immunoglobulin isotypes and the microorganisms, pathogenic and non-pathogenic that interact with the immune system.Copyright © 2016.

In this respect, the gastro-intestinal motility and hypersecretion essays were evaluated using a simple test meal (10% charcoal in 5% gum arabic) and castor oil induced diarrhea. However, the effect of GOAE on glucose absorption and homeostasis was assessed by the Ussing chamber system and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) measures.Various doses of the Quercus ilex aqueous extract (125, 250 and 500mgkg) administered orally produced a significantly dose-related inhibition of  meal travel distance in normal rat. The highest intestinal transit reduction of 49.34% was obtained with 500mgkg compared to 58.33% caused by reference drug (clonidine, 1mgkg). In castor oil induced diarrhea in rat, Q. ilex extract reduced the frequency of defecation, fluid accumulation and electrolyte transport. These effects were associated with decreased histopathological damage and regulation of intracellular mediators disturbance in the intestinal mucosa. In addition, GOAE treatment improved glucose tolerance and significantly and dose-dependently reduced (>50%) the glucose absorption via intestinal . Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of many bioactive natural compounds.These results suggest that the extract was effective towards reducing diarrhea, fluid accumulation, electrolyte transport and glucose absorption, and no toxic effects of the GOAE presented on this study.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Although blocking plant virus transmission would allow for crop protection, virus receptors in insect vectors are unknown. Here we identify membrane alanyl aminopeptidase N (APN) as a receptor for pea enation mosaic virus (PEMV) coat protein (CP) in the  of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, using a far-Western blot method. Pulldown and immunofluorescence binding assays and surface plasmon resonance were used to confirm and characterize CP-APN interaction. PEMV virions and a peptide comprised of PEMV CP fused to a proline-rich hinge (-P-) and green fluorescent protein (CP-P-GFP) specifically bound to APN. Recombinant APN expressed in Sf9 cells resulted in internalization of CP-P-GFP, which was visualized by confocal microscopy; such internalization is an expected hallmark of a functional  receptor. Finally, in assays with aphid -derived brush border membrane vesicles, binding of CP-P-GFP competed with binding of GBP3.1, a peptide previously demonstrated to bind to APN in the aphid  and to impede PEMV uptake into the hemocoel; this finding supports the hypothesis that GBP3.1 and PEMV bind to and compete for the same APN receptor. These in vitro data combined with previously published in vivo experiments (S. Liu, S. Sivakumar, W. O. Sparks, W. A. Miller, and . C. Bonning, Virology 401:107-116, 2010, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2010.02.009) support the identification of APN as the first receptor in a plant virus vector. Knowledge of this receptor will provide for technologies based on PEMV-APN interaction designed to block plant virus transmission and to suppress aphid populations.A significant proportion of global food production is lost to insect pests. Aphids, in addition to weakening plants by feeding on their sap, are responsible for transmitting about half of the plant viruses vectored by insects. Growers rely heavily on the application of chemical insecticides to manage both aphids and aphid-vectored plant viral disease. To increase our understanding of plant virus-aphid vector interaction, we provide in vitro evidence supporting earlier in vivo work for identification of a receptor protein in the aphid  called aminopeptidase N, which is responsible for entry of the plant virus pea enation mosaic virus into the pea aphid vector. Enrichment of proteins found on the surface of the aphid   resulted in identification of this first aphid  receptor for a plant virus. This discovery is particularly important since the disruption of plant virus binding to such a receptor may enable the development of a nonchemical strategy for controlling aphid-vectored plant viruses to maximize food production.Copyright © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

During subsequent sampling in November 2008 and January 2009, chronic proliferative gill inflammation and peritonitis was observed. Cumulative mortalities of 5.6-12.8% and severe growth retardation were observed. Routine diagnostic analysis revealed no diseases known to salmon at the time, but microsporidian infection of tissues was observed.To characterize the disease outbreak, a combination of histopathology, in situ hybridization (ISH), chitin, calcofluor-white (CFW) staining, and real-time PCR were used to describe the disease progression with visualization of the D. lepeophtherii stages in situ.The presence of the microsporidian Desmozoon lepeophtherii was confirmed with real-time PCR, DNA sequencing and ISH, and the parasite was detected in association with acute lesions in the gills and peritoneum. ISH using a probe specific to small subunit 16S rRNA gene provided an effective tool for demonstrating the distribution of D. lepeophtherii in the tissue. Infection in the peritoneum seemed localized in and around pre-existing vaccine granulomas, and in the gastrointestinal walls. In the heart, kidney and spleen, the infection was most often associated with mononuclear leucocytes and macrophages, including melanomacrophages. Desmozoon lepeophtherii exospores were found in the nuclei of the gastrointestinal  for the first time, suggesting a role of the gastrointestinal tract in the spread of spores to the environment.This study describes the progression of D. lepeophtherii disease outbreak in an Atlantic salmon farm without any other known diseases present. Using different methods to examine the disease outbreak, new insight into the pathology of D. lepeophtherii was obtained. The parasite was localized in situ in association with severe tissue damage and inflammation in the gills, peritoneal cavity and in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract that links the parasite directly to the observed pathology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26193312>Effects of Lactofermented Beetroot Juice Alone or with N-nitroso-N-methylurea on Selected Metabolic Parameters, Composition of the Microbiota Adhering to the   and Antioxidant Status of Rats.</a></h2><p>An objective of this work was to assess the biological activity of beetroot juice (Chrobry variety, Beta vulgaris L. ssp. vulgaris), which was lactofermented by probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus brevis 0944 and Lactobacillus paracasei 0920. The oxidative status of blood serum, kidneys, and liver of rats consuming the fermented beetroot juice were determined. The experimental rats were divided into four groups on diet type: Basal diet, basal diet supplemented with fermented beetroot juice, basal diet and N-nitroso-N-methylurea treatment, and basal diet supplemented with fermented beetroot juice and N-nitroso-N-methylurea treatment. Mutagen N-nitroso-N-methylurea, which was added to diet in order to induce aberrant oxidative and biochemical processes and disadvantageous changes in the count and metabolic activity of the   microbiota. The nutritional in vivo study showed that supplementing the diet of the rats with the lactofermented beetroot juice reduced the level of ammonia by 17% in the group treated with N-nitroso-N-methylurea. Furthermore, the positive modulation of the  microflora and its metabolic activity was observed in groups of rats fed with the diet supplemented with the fermented beetroot juice. A concomitant decrease in the -glucuronidase activity was a consequence of the   microbiota modulation. The antioxidant capacity of blood serum aqueous fraction was increased by about 69% in the group of rats treated N-nitroso-N-methylurea mixed with the fermented beetroot juice and N-nitroso-N-methylurea versus to the N-nitroso-N-methylurea treatment, whereas the antioxidant parameters of the blood serum lipid fraction, kidneys, and liver remained unchanged.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26634447>Intestinal M cells.</a></h2><p>We have an enormous number of commensal bacteria in our intestine, moreover, the foods that we ingest and the water we drink is sometimes contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms. The intestinal  is always exposed to such microbes, friend or foe, so to contain them our  is equipped with specialized -associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), literally the largest peripheral lymphoid tissue in the body. GALT is the intestinal immune inductive site composed of lymphoid follicles such as Peyer's patches. M cells are a subset of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) residing in the region of the  covering GALT lymphoid follicles. Although the vast majority of IEC function to absorb nutrients from the intestine, M cells are highly specialized to take up intestinal microbial antigens and deliver them to GALT for efficient mucosal as well as systemic immune responses. I will discuss recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of M-cell differentiation and functions.© The Authors 2015.

In the present paper, we discuss their immunomodulating effects. It is suggested that immunomodulation is elicited through indirect and direct mechanisms. Indirect mechanisms encompass stimulation of growth and activity of lactic acid bacteria, but can also be caused by fermentation products of these bacteria, i.e., short chain fatty acids. Evidence for direct effects on the immune system generally remains to be confirmed. It is suggested that inulin-type fructans can be detected by  dendritic cells (DCs), through receptor ligation of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-like receptors, nucleotide oligomerization domain containing proteins (NODs), C-type lectin receptors, and galectins, eventually inducing pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. DCs may also exert antigen presenting capacity toward effector cells, such as  cells, T cells, and natural killer cells locally, or in the spleen. Inulin-type fructans may also ligate PRRs expressed on  , which could influence its barrier function. Inulin-type fructans are potent immunomodulating food components that hold many promises for prevention of disease. However, more studies into the mechanisms, dose-effect relations, and structure-function studies are required.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25894545>Phenotypic Analysis of a Population of IgA+ Cells in the Follicle-Associated  of Mouse Peyer's Patches.</a></h2><p>The follicle-associated  (FAE) selectively transports prions, viruses, pathogenic bacteria, commensal microflora, and even secretory IgA (SIgA)-immune complexes from the intestinal lumen to underlying -associated lymphoid tissues like Peyer's patches. The FAE consists of a single layer of columnar epithelial cells that includes enterocytes and M (microfold) cells, intermingled with dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, and naïve and memory  and T lymphocytes. In this report we describe a population of IgA+ cells that reside within and immediately below the FAE in mouse Peyer's patches. Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis indicated that the FAE-associated IgA+ cells were negative for surface antigen markers specific for  cells (B220), T cells (CD3), DCs (CD11c), and plasma cells (CD138). The IgA+ cells were also negative Ki-67 and IRF4, indicating that they are not mature  cells or plasma cells. The IgA+ cells were, however, often found in close proximity to DCs, leading us to speculate that the population of IgA+ cells in the FAE constitutes an atypical subset of  cells involved in mucosal antigen surveillance and/or immune recall.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25537883>Quantitative proteomic analysis reveals heat stress-induced injury in rat small intestine via activation of the MAPK and NF-κ signaling pathways.</a></h2><p>The intestinal  plays a critical role in absorbing nutrients and maintaining the integrity of the  barrier. Extreme heat stress induces damage to the intestinal . However, the protein expression changes and the mechanism behind this damage remain poorly understood. In this study, morphological observation showed that heat stress induced desquamation of intestinal epithelial cells, and destruction of intestinal microvilli and mitochondria. Heat stress-induced changes in the intestinal proteome were quantified using the iTRAQ method followed by mass spectrometry and software analysis. A total of 1689 proteins were identified in rat intestine tissue, of which 41 showed significantly altered expression between the heat stressed and control groups. However, these proteins with significant alterations were involved in biological processes such as cellular assembly and organization, developmental disorder, organismal injury and abnormalities, and inflammation. We found that members of the MAPK and NF-κ signaling pathways act as hub proteins in the network interaction analysis. Furthermore, western blot analysis verified that the MAPK and NF-κ signaling pathways were activated by heat stress as expected. This study suggests that heat stress induces cell cytoskeleton reorganization and an inflammatory response, and the activation of the MAPK and NF-κ signaling pathways, which may ultimately contribute to intestinal injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31434568>Current understanding of the  microbiota shaping mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Increasing evidences have shown strong associations between  microbiota and many human diseases, and understanding the dynamic crosstalks of host-microbe interaction in the  has become necessary for the detection, prevention, or therapy of diseases. Many reports have showed that diet, nutrient, pharmacologic factors and many other stimuli play dominant roles in the modulation of  microbial compositions. However, it is inappropriate to neglect the impact of host factors on shaping the  microbiota. In this review, we highlighted the current findings of the host factors that could modulate the  microbiota. Particularly the -associated factors, including the innate immune sensors, anti-microbial peptides, mucus barrier, secretory IgAs, epithelial microvilli, epithelial tight junctions,  metabolism, oxygen barrier, and even the microRNAs are discussed in the context of the microbiota shaping. With these shaping factors, the  epithelial cells could select the residing microbes and affect the microbial composition.

It has been demonstrated that intestinal lymphocytes infiltrate into the brain and aggravate tissue injury after stroke. However, less attention has been paid to the influence on the intestinal immunology as well as morphology. Here, we utilized a rat permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model to investigate the influences on intestinal mucosa, lymphocytes of the -associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), and the intestinal expression of CCL25 mRNA and CCL19 mRNA of stroke. Rats were randomly divided into stroke, sham, and control groups. Stroke and sham groups were further divided into interval groups of 6h, 12h, and 24h after surgery. Intestinal pathophysiological changes were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. The lymphocyte numbers were detected by flow cytometry. The expression of CCL25 mRNA and CCL19 mRNA was tested with the PCR technique. We found significant necrosis and shedding of the  after stroke. Moreover, the lesion aggravated with time. In addition, there was a significant increase of T lymphocytes in Peyer's patches (PPs), especially at 12h and 24h after stroke, while no differences in the number of  lymphocytes and the intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) were found. The data displayed no alteration of CCL25 mRNA expression. In contrast, an upregulation of CCL19 mRNA expression was detected at 6h after stroke.

Circadian rhythm disruption (CRD) is suggested as a risk factor for inflammatory bowel disease. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Intestinal biopsies from Per1/2 mutant and wild-type (WT) mice were investigated by electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and bromodeoxyuridine pulse-chase experiments. TNF-α was injected intraperitoneally, with or without necrostatin-1, into Per1/2 mice or rhythmic and externally desynchronized WT mice to study intestinal epithelial cell death. Experimental chronic colitis was induced by oral administration of dextran sodium sulfate. , caspase activity was assayed in Per1/2-specific small interfering RNA-transfected cells.  was overexpressed to study antiapoptosis and the cell cycle. Genetic ablation of circadian clock function or environmental CRD in mice increased susceptibility to severe intestinal inflammation and epithelial dysregulation, accompanied by excessive necroptotic cell death and a reduced number of secretory epithelial cells. Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase (RIP)-3-mediated intestinal necroptosis was linked to increased mitotic cell cycle arrest  Per1/2-controlled Wee1, resulting in increased antiapoptosis  cellular inhibitor of apoptosis-2. Together, our data suggest that circadian rhythm stability is pivotal for the maintenance of mucosal barrier function.

The emergence of hypervirulent strains has contributed to increased mortality and morbidity of CDI. The C. difficile toxins contribute directly to CDI-associated lesions of the , but other bacterial factors are needed for the bacteria to adhere and colonize the intestinal . The C. difficile flagella, which confer motility and chemotaxis for successful intestinal colonization, could play an additional role in bacterial pathogenesis by contributing to the inflammatory response of the host and mucosal injury. Indeed, by activating the TLR5, flagella can elicit activation of the MAPK and NF-κ cascades of cell signaling, leading to the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In the current study, we demonstrate, by using an animal model of CDI, a synergic effect of flagella and toxins in eliciting an inflammatory mucosal response. In this model, the absence of flagella dramatically decreases the degree of mucosal inflammation in mice and the sole presence of toxins without flagella was not enough to elicit epithelial lesions. These results highlight the important role of C. difficile flagella in eliciting mucosal lesions as long as the toxins exert their action on the .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26439723>Gastrointestinal stability of urolithins: an in vitro approach.</a></h2><p>Urolithins are bioactive ellagitannin-derived metabolites showing a wide phenotypic variation in their production by the  microbiota. This work represents a first in vitro step toward the development of new strategies focused on the oral supplementation of urolithins with the aim of overcoming their selective production and making their putative health benefits available for the whole population.In order to study their gastrointestinal stability, urolithin A, urolithin , and urolithin -glucuronide, as well as ellagic acid, were subjected to a simulated gastrointestinal digestion model consisting of oral, gastric, and pancreatic steps followed by a 24-h fecal fermentation. The effect of the entero-hepatic recirculation on urolithin -glucuronide, a phase II metabolite, was also investigated.Urolithin  was the molecule able to resist to a greater extent the conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, while urolithin A and ellagic acid were drastically unstable during the colonic step. Conjugation with glucuronic acid, ideally occurring in the liver, conferred to urolithin  an increased stability, which may be interesting in the framework of entero-hepatic recirculation.This set of experiments lets hypothesize that orally supplemented urolithins may come into contact with the colonic  and become accessible for uptake or exert local anti-inflammatory activity, overcoming the limitations of enterotypes unable to convert ellagitannins into these putatively beneficial metabolites.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29462405> barrier function: Effects of (antibiotic) growth promoters on key barrier components and associations with growth performance.</a></h2><p>The  barrier, comprising the microbiota and their products, mucus layers, host-derived antimicrobial compounds [e.g., host defense peptides (HDP), IgA], , and underlying immune tissues, performs the essential function of preventing the passage of harmful microorganisms and substances into the body, while enabling the acquisition of dietary nutrients. Antibiotic growth promoters (AGP) are widely accepted as the "gold standard" of performance-enhancing feed additives, which had become integral and valuable components of modern, efficient animal production, but are now being phased out in many parts of the world. This review, therefore, examines the reported effects of AGP on the key components of  barrier function, particularly where corresponding (positive) growth performance data were provided to indicate that any changes were beneficial, and some important trends do emerge. Certain bacterial families (e.g., Lachnospiraceae), genera (e.g., Faecalibacterium, Propionibacterium, and Ruminococcus), or species (e.g., F. prausnitzii, . fragilis, and some Lactobacillus spp.) have been reported to increase with AGP use, are associated with improved growth performance, and show benefit across species, which may be related to their production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). Various studies have investigated the effects of AGP on mucus-related parameters (e.g., goblet cell size, density, and mucin mRNA expression) but these do not always seem to correlate well with the actual physical characteristics of the mucus layer(s). Surprisingly, there are little data relating to HDP or IgA, even though they have recognized benefits. There are clear AGP benefits on epithelial structure and function (e.g., nutrient digestibility), and these may (currently) provide the most reliable indicators of the efficacy of growth promoters. Data investigating effects on  immune parameters (e.g., cell populations, cytokines, and chemokines), with corresponding growth performance, are limited and require further detailed interrogation. This review highlights both important observations related to the effects of AGP on key  barrier components, with associated growth performance, and areas that require further investigation, thus providing an informative basis for assessing the potential of AGP alternatives.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31119977>Regulation of interferon signaling in response to  microbes by autophagy.</a></h2><p>The cellular degradative pathway of autophagy prevents unrestrained inflammatory signaling by removing intracellular microbes, damaged organelles, and other factors that trigger immune reactions. Consistent with this function, a common variant of the autophagy gene  is associated with susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a disorder characterized by a chronic immune reaction directed against the  microbiota. We recently contributed to our understanding of the link between autophagy and inflammatory signaling in the intestine by demonstrating that autophagy proteins including ATG16L1 are necessary in the  to prevent a spontaneous type I interferon response to the  microbiota. Enhanced innate immunity that occurs upon autophagy inhibition is protective in mouse models of infection by an enteric bacterial pathogen and acute epithelial injury. Although avoiding excess immune reactions towards the microbiota is necessary to prevent IBD, these observations indicate that autophagy hampers productive immunity at the intestinal epithelial barrier in certain contexts. Here, we discuss how this counterintuitive consequence of autophagy inhibition can be reconciled with the established beneficial role of the pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28708377>Membrane Association Dictates Ligand Specificity for the Innate Immune Receptor NOD2.</a></h2><p>The human  must regulate its immune response to resident and pathogenic bacteria, numbering in the trillions. The peptidoglycan component of the bacterial cell wall is a dense and rigid structure that consists of polymeric carbohydrates and highly cross-linked peptides which offers protection from the host and surrounding environment. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2), a human membrane-associated innate immune receptor found in the   and mutated in an estimated 30% of Crohn's disease patients, binds to peptidoglycan fragments and initiates an immune response. Using a combination of chemical synthesis, advanced analytical assays, and protein biochemistry, we tested the binding of a variety of synthetic peptidoglycan fragments to wild-type (WT)-NOD2. Only when the protein was presented in the native membrane did binding measurements correlate with a NOD2-dependent nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated  cells (NF-κ) response, supporting the hypothesis that the native-membrane environment confers ligand specificity to the NOD2 receptor for NF-κ signaling. While N-acetyl-muramyl dipeptide (MDP) has been thought to be the minimal peptidoglycan fragment necessary to activate a NOD2-dependent immune response, we found that fragments with and without the dipeptide moiety are capable of binding and activating a NOD2-dependent NF-κ response, suggesting that the carbohydrate moiety of the peptidoglycan fragments is the minimal functional epitope. This work highlights the necessity of studying NOD2-ligand binding in systems that resemble the receptor's natural environment, as the cellular membrane and/or NOD2 interacting partners appear to play a crucial role in ligand binding and in triggering an innate immune response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25613998>Cloning and characterization of a novel sigma-like glutathione S-transferase from the giant panda parasitic nematode, Baylisascaris schroederi.</a></h2><p>Baylisascaris schroederi, an intestinal nematode of the giant panda, is the cause of the often fatal disease, baylisascariasis. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are versatile enzymes that can affect parasite survival and parasite-host interactions and, are therefore, potential targets for the development of diagnostic tests and vaccines.In this study, we identified a full-length cDNA that encoded a novel, secretory sigma-like GST (Bsc-GSTσ) from a . schroederi-omic dataset. Following cloning and sequencing, sequence and structural analyses and comparative modeling were performed using online-bioinformatics and proteomics tools. The recombinant Bsc-GSTσ (rBsc-GSTσ) protein was prokaryotically expressed and then used to detect antigenicity and reactivity using immunoblotting assays. In addition, the native protein in female adult . schroederi was located via immunofluorescence techniques, while the preliminary ELISA-based serodiagnostic potential of rBsc-GSTσ was assessed in native and infected mouse sera.Bsc-GSTσ contained a 621-bp open reading frame that encoded a polypeptide of 206 amino acids with two typical sigma GST domain profiles, including a GST_N_Sigma_like at the N-terminus and a GST_C_Sigma_like at the C-terminus. The presence of an N-terminal signal sequence indicated that Bsc-GSTσ was a secretory protein. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses showed that Bsc-GSTσ was a nematode-specific member of the Sigma class GSTs and shared the closest genetic distance with its homologue in Ascaris suum. Further comparative structure analyses indicated that Bsc-GSTσ possessed the essential structural motifs (e.g., βαβαββα) and the consensus secondary or tertiary structure that is typical for other characterized GSTσs. Immunolocalization revealed strong distributions of native Bsc-GSTσ in the body hypodermis, lateral chords,  ,  microvilli, oviduct , and ovaries of adult female worms, similar to its homologue in A. suum. Building on good immunogenic properties, rBsc-GSTσ-based ELISA exhibited a sensitivity of 79.1% and a specificity of 82.0% to detect anti-. schroederi IgG antibodies in the sera of experimentally infected mice.This study presents a comprehensive demonstration of sequence and structural-based analysis of a new, secretory sigma-like GST from a nematode, and its good serodiagnostic performance suggests that rBsc-GSTσ has the potential to detect . schroederi and, therefore, could be used to develop an ELISA-based serological test to diagnose baylisascariasis in giant pandas.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27491828>HIV-1 Tat exacerbates lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine release via TLR4 signaling in the enteric nervous system.</a></h2><p>The loss of   integrity leads to translocation of microbes and microbial products resulting in immune activation and drives systemic inflammation in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. Although viral loads in HIV patients are significantly reduced in the post-cART era, inflammation and immune activation persist and can lead to morbidity. Here, we determined the interactive effects of the viral protein HIV-1 Tat and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on enteric neurons and glia. Bacterial translocation was significantly enhanced in Tat-expressing (Tat+) mice. Exposure to HIV-1 Tat in combination with LPS enhanced the expression and release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α in the ilea of Tat+ mice and by enteric glia. This coincided with enhanced NF-κ activation in enteric glia that was abrogated in glia from TLR4 knockout mice and by knockdown (siRNA) of MyD88 siRNA in wild type glia. The synergistic effects of Tat and LPS resulted in a reduced rate of colonic propulsion in Tat+ mice treated with LPS. These results show that HIV-1 Tat interacts with the TLR4 receptor to enhance the pro-inflammatory effects of LPS leading to gastrointestinal dysmotility and enhanced immune activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25678452>SLAMF4 Is a Negative Regulator of Expansion of Cytotoxic Intraepithelial CD8+ T Cells That Maintains Homeostasis in the Small Intestine.</a></h2><p>Intraepithelial T lymphocyte cells (IEL) are the first immune cells to respond to pathogens; they help maintain the integrity of the epithelial barrier. We studied the function of the mouse glycoprotein Signaling Lymphocyte Activation Molecule Family receptor (SLAMF) 4 (encoded by Slamf4) on the surface of CD8αβ αβ T-cell receptor (TCR)(+) IELs, and the roles of these cells in homeostasis of the small intestine in mice.SLAMF4(-) CD8(+) αβTCR(+) cells isolated from spleens of OT-I Rag1(-/-) mice were induced to express -homing receptors and transferred to C57BL/6J mice; levels of SLAMF4(+) cells were measured in small intestine tissues. After administration of anti-CD3 or antigen, with or without anti-SLAM4, to C57BL/6J and Slamf4(-/-) mice, CD8αβ αβTCR(+) IELs were collected; cytokine production and cytotoxicity were measured. Depletion of CX3CR1(+) phagocytes was assessed in mice by live-cell confocal imaging or by cytofluorometry; small intestine tissues were analyzed by histology and inflammation was quantified.Splenic CD8(+) αβTCR(+) cells began to express SLAMF4 only after migrating to the small intestine. Injection of C57BL/6J mice with anti-SLAMF4 and anti-CD3 increased levels of interleukin 10 and interferon gamma secretion by IEL, compared with injection of anti-CD3 only. Similarly, the number of granzyme (+) cytotoxic CD8(+) αβTCR(+) IELs increased in Slamf4(-/-) mice after injection of anti-CD3 and anti-SLAMF4, administration of antigen, or injection of anti-CD3. Surprisingly, in vivo activation of CD8αβ(+) IELs with anti-CD3 or antigen caused transient depletion of CX3CR1(+) phagocytes, which was prolonged by co-injection with anti-SLAMF4 or in Slamf4(-/-) mice. Anti-CD3 aggravated inflammation in the small intestines of Slamf4(-/-) mice and Eat2a(-/-)Eat2b(-/-) mice, indicated by flattened villi and crypt hyperplasia.In mice, the intestinal environment induces SLAMF4 expression and localization to the surface of CD8(+) αβTCR(+) IELs.

Differentiation of M cells from epithelial stem cells in intestinal crypts requires the cytokine receptor activator of NF-κ ligand (RANKL) and the transcription factor Spi-. We used three-dimensional enteroid cultures established with small intestinal crypts from mice as a model system to investigate signaling pathways involved in M cell differentiation and the influence of other cytokines on RANKL-induced M cell differentiation. Addition of RANKL to enteroids induced expression of multiple M cell-associated genes, including Spib, Ccl9 [chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 9], Tnfaip2 (TNF-α-induced protein 2), Anxa5 (annexin A5), and Marcksl1 (myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate) in 1 day. The mature M cell marker glycoprotein 2 (Gp2) was strongly induced by 3 days and expressed by 11% of cells in enteroids. The noncanonical NF-κ pathway was required for RANKL-induced M cell differentiation in enteroids, as addition of RANKL to enteroids from mice with a null mutation in the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 14 (Map3k14) gene encoding NF-κ-inducing kinase failed to induce M cell-associated genes. While the cytokine TNF-α alone had little, if any, effect on expression of M cell-associated genes, addition of TNF-α to RANKL consistently resulted in three- to sixfold higher levels of multiple M cell-associated genes than RANKL alone. One contributing mechanism is the rapid induction by TNF-α of Relb and Nfkb2 (NF-κ subunit 2), genes encoding the two subunits of the noncanonical NF-κ heterodimer. We conclude that endogenous activators of canonical NF-κ signaling present in the -associated lymphoid tissue microenvironment, including TNF-α, can play a supportive role in the RANKL-dependent differentiation of M cells in the follicle-associated .Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28746740>CCR6 promotes steady-state mononuclear phagocyte association with the intestinal , imprinting and immune surveillance.</a></h2><p>The intestinal lamina propria (LP) contains antigen-presenting cells with features of dendritic cells and macrophages, collectively referred to as mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs). Association of MNPs with the  is thought to play an important role in multiple facets of intestinal immunity including imprinting MNPs with the ability to induce IgA production, inducing the expression of  homing molecules on T cells, facilitating the capture of luminal antigens and microbes, and subsequent immune responses in the mesenteric lymph node (MLN). However, the factors promoting this process in the steady state are largely unknown, and in vivo models to test and confirm the importance of LP-MNP association with the  for these outcomes are unexplored. Evaluation of epithelial expression of chemoattractants in mice where MNP-epithelial associations were impaired suggested CCL20 as a candidate promoting epithelial association. Expression of CCR6, the only known receptor for CCL20, was required for MNPs to associate with the . LP-MNPs from CCR6 mice did not display defects in acquiring antigen and stimulating T-cell responses in ex vivo assays or in responses to antigen administered systemically. However, LP-MNPs from CCR6-deficient mice were impaired at acquiring luminal and epithelial antigens, inducing IgA production in  cells, inducing immune responses in the MLN, and capturing and trafficking luminal commensal bacteria to the MLN. These findings identify a crucial role for CCR6 in promoting LP-MNPs to associate with the intestinal  in the steady state to perform multiple functions promoting  immune homeostasis.© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29440671>Impaired airway mucociliary function reduces antigen-specific IgA immune response to immunization with a claudin-4-targeting nasal vaccine in mice.</a></h2><p>Vaccine delivery is an essential element for the development of mucosal vaccine, but it remains to be investigated how physical barriers such as mucus and cilia affect vaccine delivery efficacy. Previously, we reported that C-terminal fragment of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (C-CPE) targeted claudin-4, which is expressed by the  associated with nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT), and could be effective as a nasal vaccine delivery. Mice lacking tubulin tyrosine ligase-like family, member 1 (Ttll1-KO mice) showed mucus accumulation in nasal cavity due to the impaired motility of respiratory cilia. Ttll1-KO mice nasally immunized with C-CPE fused to pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA-C-CPE) showed reduced PspA-specific nasal IgA responses, impaired germinal center formation, and decreased germinal center -cells and follicular helper T cells in the NALT. Although there was no change in the expression of claudin-4 in the NALT  in Ttll1-KO mice, the  was covered by a dense mucus that prevented the binding of PspA-C-CPE to NALT. However, administration of expectorant N-acetylcysteine removed the mucus and rescued the PspA-specific nasal IgA response. These results show that the accumulation of mucus caused by impaired respiratory cilia function is an interfering factor in the C-CPE-based claudin-4-targeting nasal vaccine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25577136>New insights into gastrointestinal anthrax infection.</a></h2><p>Bacterial infections are the primary cause of gastrointestinal (GI) disorders in both developing and developed countries, and are particularly dangerous for infants and children. Bacillus anthracis is the 'archetype zoonotic' pathogen; no other infectious disease affects such a broad range of species, including humans. Importantly, there are more case reports of GI anthrax infection in children than inhalational disease. Early diagnosis is difficult and widespread systemic disease develops rapidly. This review highlights new findings concerning the roles of the  epithelia, commensal microbiota, and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in initiation of disease and systemic dissemination in animal models of GI anthrax, the understanding of which is crucial to designing alternative therapies that target the establishment of infection.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The epithelial barrier plays an important role in organ development, disease pathogenesis, and aging. The major component of an epithelial barrier is the single columnar  and tight junctions. Tight junctions are located at the most apical region of the junctional complex and contain many integral membrane proteins, such as occludin, the claudin family, and junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs). The disruption of intestinal epithelial barriers may lead to several pathophysiological conditions causing malabsorption of nutrition and chronic inflammation. In this review, we provide an update on the alterations of epithelial barriers associated with  diseases using experimental animal models; we appraise the role of tight junctions in neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and colorectal cancer; we also compare some common features as well as differences and similarities in the pathophysiology of intestinal inflammation in neonatal (NEC) and adult (IBD) .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25536194>Dietary cholesterol directly induces acute inflammasome-dependent intestinal inflammation.</a></h2><p>Prolonged ingestion of a cholesterol- or saturated fatty acid-enriched diet induces chronic, often systemic, auto-inflammatory responses resulting in significant health problems worldwide. In vivo information regarding the local and direct inflammatory effect of these dietary components in the intestine and, in particular, on the intestinal  is lacking. Here we report that both mice and zebrafish exposed to high-fat (HFDs) or high-cholesterol (HCDs) diets develop acute innate inflammatory responses within hours, reflected in the localized interleukin-1β-dependent accumulation of myeloid cells in the intestine. Acute HCD-induced intestinal inflammation is dependent on cholesterol uptake via Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 and inflammasome activation involving apoptosis-associated Speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain, which leads to Caspase-1 activity in intestinal epithelial cells. Extended exposure to HCD results in localized, inflammation-dependent, functional dysregulation as well as systemic pathologies. Our model suggests that dietary cholesterol initiates intestinal inflammation in epithelial cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30409105> bacteriocin is associated with intestinal and systemic improvements in diet-induced obese mice and maintains epithelial barrier integrity .</a></h2><p>We investigated the  bacteriocin plantaricin EF (PlnEF) system for its contributions to  mediated benefits in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity. C57BL/6J mice on a high-fat diet (HFD) were administered a rifampicin resistant mutant of  NCMIB8826 (NICMB8826-R) or an isogenic Δ mutant strain, LM0419, every 48 h for nine weeks. Mice fed wild-type , but not LM0419, reduced their consumption of the HFD starting three weeks into the study and exhibited an overall 10% reduction in weight gain. The responses were independent of glucose homeostasis, as both NCMIB8826-R and LM0419 fed mice had improved oral glucose tolerance compared to sham controls. Although bacteriocins have antibacterial properties, the ileal, cecal, and fecal microbiota and cecocolic metabolomes were unchanged between mice fed either wild-type  or the Δ mutant. Instead, only mice fed NCMIB8826-R showed an increased production of ZO-1 in ileal tissues. To verify a potential role for the plantaricin EF system in supporting intestinal epithelial function, synthesized PlnEF peptides were applied to Caco-2 cell monolayers challenged with TNF-α and IFN-γ. The combination of PlnE and PlnF were required to prevent sustained cytokine-induced losses to Caco-2 cell para- and transcellular permeability and elevated IL-8 levels. In conclusion, this study shows that probiotic  ameliorates the effects of obesogenic diets through a mechanism that involves the plantaricin EF system and likely includes  induced fortification of the intestinal .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28300642>Distribution and phylogeny of Brachyspira spp. in human intestinal spirochetosis revealed by FISH and 16S rRNA-gene analysis.</a></h2><p>During six years as German National Consultant Laboratory for Spirochetes we investigated 149 intestinal biopsies from 91 patients, which were histopathologically diagnosed with human intestinal spirochetosis (HIS), using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) combined with 16S rRNA gene PCR and sequencing. Aim of this study was to complement histopathological findings with FISH and PCR for definite diagnosis and species identification of the causative pathogens. HIS is characterized by colonization of the colonic mucosa of the human distal intestinal tract by Brachyspira spp. Microbiological diagnosis of HIS is not performed, because of the fastidious nature and slow growth of Brachyspira spp. in culture. In clinical practice, diagnosis of HIS relies solely on histopathology without differentiation of the spirochetes. We used a previously described FISH probe to detect and identify Brachyspira spp. in histological  biopsies. FISH allowed rapid visualization and identification of Brachyspira spp. in 77 patients. In most cases, the bright FISH signal already allowed rapid localization of Brachyspira spp. at 400× magnification. By sequencing, 53 cases could be assigned to the . aalborgi lineage including ". ibaraki" and ". hominis", and 23 cases to . pilosicoli. One case showed mixed colonization. The cases reported here reaffirm all major HIS Brachyspira spp. clusters already described. However, the phylogenetic diversity seems to be even greater than previously reported. In 14 cases, we could not confirm HIS by either FISH or PCR, but found colonization of the  by rods and cocci, indicating misdiagnosis by histopathology. FISH in combination with molecular identification by 16S rRNA gene sequencing has proved to be a valuable addition to histopathology. It provides definite diagnosis of HIS and allows insights into phylogeny and distribution of Brachyspira spp. HIS should be considered as a differential diagnosis in diarrhea of unknown origin, particularly in patients from risk groups (e.g. patients with colonic adenomas, inflammatory polyps, inflammatory bowel disease or HIV infection and in men who have sex with men).Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Ingestion is one of the major NP exposure routes, and potential effects are often studied using Caco-2 cells, a well-established model for the  . MCF-7 cells are epithelial breast cancer cells with extensive well-characterized toxicogenomics profiles. In the present study, we aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the cellular molecular responses in Caco-2 and MCF-7 cells after AgNP exposure in order to evaluate whether epithelial cells derived from different tissues demonstrated similar responses. These insights could possibly reduce the size of cell panels for NP hazard identification screening purposes. AgNPs of 20, 30, 60, and 110 nm, and AgNO were exposed for 6 h and 24 h. AgNPs were shown to be taken up and dissolve intracellularly. Compared with MCF-7 cells, Caco-2 cells showed a higher sensitivity to AgNPs, slower gene expression kinetics and absence of NP size-dependent responses. However, on a molecular level, no significant differences were observed between the two cell types. Transcriptomic analysis showed that Ag(NP) exposure caused (oxidative) stress responses, possibly leading to cell death in both cell lines. There was no indication for effects specifically induced by AgNPs. Responses to AgNPs appeared to be induced by silver ions released from the AgNPs. In conclusion, differences in mRNA responses to AgNPs between Caco-2 and MCF-7 cells were mainly related to timing and magnitude, but not to a different underlying mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29883265>The enteric microbiota regulates jejunal Paneth cell number and function without impacting intestinal stem cells.</a></h2><p>Paneth cells (PCs) are epithelial cells found in the small intestine, next to intestinal stem cells (ISCs) at the base of the crypts. PCs secrete antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that regulate the commensal  microbiota. In contrast, little is known regarding how the enteric microbiota reciprocally influences PC function. In this study, we sought to characterize the impact of the enteric microbiota on PC biology in the mouse small intestine. This was done by first enumerating jejunal PCs in germ-free (GF) versus conventionally raised (CR) mice. We next evaluated the possible functional consequences of altered PC biology in these experimental groups by assessing epithelial proliferation, ISC numbers, and the production of AMPs. We found that PC numbers were significantly increased in CR versus GF mice; however, there were no differences in ISC numbers or cycling activity between groups. Of the AMPs assessed, only Reg3γ transcript expression was significantly increased in CR mice. Intriguingly, this increase was abrogated in cultured CR versus GF enteroids, and could not be re-induced with various bacterial ligands. Our findings demonstrate the enteric microbiota regulates PC function by increasing PC numbers and inducing Reg3γ expression, though the latter effect may not involve direct interactions between bacteria and the intestinal . In contrast, the enteric microbiota does not appear to regulate jejunal ISC census and proliferation. These are critical findings for investigators using GF mice and the enteroid system to study PC and ISC biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28290735>Quantitative biokinetics of titanium dioxide nanoparticles after intratracheal instillation in rats: Part 3.</a></h2><p>The biokinetics of a size-selected fraction (70 nm median size) of commercially available and V-radiolabeled [V]TiO nanoparticles has been investigated in healthy adult female Wistar-Kyoto rats at retention time-points of 1 h, 4 h, 24 h, 7 d and 28 d after intratracheal instillation of a single dose of an aqueous [V]TiO-nanoparticle suspension. A completely balanced quantitative biodistribution in all organs and tissues was obtained by applying typical [V]TiO-nanoparticle doses in the range of 40-240 μg·kg bodyweight and making use of the high sensitivity of the radiotracer technique. The [V]TiO-nanoparticle content was corrected for residual blood retained in organs and tissues after exsanguination and for V-ions not bound to TiO-nanoparticles. About 4% of the initial peripheral lung dose passed through the air-blood-barrier after 1 h and were retained mainly in the carcass (4%); 0.3% after 28 d. Highest organ fractions of [V]TiO-nanoparticles present in liver and kidneys remained constant (0.03%). [V]TiO-nanoparticles which entered across the   following fast and long-term clearance from the lungs via larynx increased from 5 to 20% of all translocated/absorbed [V]TiO-nanoparticles. This contribution may account for 1/5 of the nanoparticle retention in some organs. After normalizing the fractions of retained [V]TiO-nanoparticles to the fraction that reached systemic circulation, the biodistribution was compared with the biodistributions determined after IV-injection (Part 1) and gavage (GAV) (Part 2). The biokinetics patterns after IT-instillation and GAV were similar but both were distinctly different from the pattern after intravenous injection disproving the latter to be a suitable surrogate of the former applications. Considering that chronic occupational inhalation of relatively biopersistent TiO-particles (including nanoparticles) and accumulation in secondary organs may pose long-term health risks, this issue should be scrutinized more comprehensively.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27446815>Flagellin Induces β-Defensin 2 in Human Colonic Ex vivo Infection with Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli.</a></h2><p>Enterohemorrhagic E.coli (EHEC) is an important foodborne pathogen in the developed world and can cause life-threatening disease particularly in children. EHEC persists in the human  by adhering intimately to colonic  and forming characteristic attaching/effacing lesions. In this study, we investigated the innate immune response to EHEC infection with particular focus on antimicrobial peptide and protein expression by colonic . Using a novel human colonic biopsy model and polarized T84 colon carcinoma cells, we found that EHEC infection induced expression of human β-defensin 2 (hBD2), whereas hBD1, hBD3, LL-37, and lysozyme remained unchanged. Infection with specific EHEC deletion mutants demonstrated that this was dependent on flagellin, and apical exposure to purified flagellin was sufficient to stimulate hBD2 and also interleukin (IL)-8 expression ex vivo and in vitro. Flagellin-mediated hBD2 induction was significantly reduced by inhibitors of NF-κ, MAP kinase p38 and JNK but not ERK1/2. Interestingly, IL-8 secretion by polarized T84 cells was vectorial depending on the side of stimulation, and apical exposure to EHEC or flagellin resulted in apical IL-8 release. Our results demonstrate that EHEC only induces a modest immune response in human colonic  characterized by flagellin-dependent induction of hBD2 and low levels of IL-8.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27405092>TLR ligands and butyrate increase Pyy expression through two distinct but inter-regulated pathways.</a></h2><p>The intestinal  is an active barrier separating the host from its microbiota. It senses microbial compounds through expression of a wide range of receptors including the Toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLRs have been shown to regulate  permeability or secretion of defensin by Paneth cells. However, the expression and function of TLRs in enteroendocrine L-cells, a specific subtype of intestinal cells secreting PYY and GLP-1, have not yet been assessed. PYY and GLP-1 are implicated in regulation of  motility, food intake and insulin secretion, and are of great interest regarding obesity and type 2 diabetes. Using a cellular model of human L-cells and a reporter system for NF-κ activation pathway, we reported functional expression of TLRs in these cells. Stimulation with specific TLR-agonists increased expression of Pyy but not Proglucagon in an NF-κ-dependent manner. Moreover, the effect of TLR stimulation was additive to butyrate, a product of bacterial fermentation, on Pyy expression. Additionally, butyrate also increased Tlr expression, including Tlr4, and the NF-κ response to TLR stimulation. Altogether, our results demonstrated a role of TLRs in the modulation of Pyy expression and the importance of butyrate, a product of bacterial fermentation in regulation of microbial TLR-dependent sensing.© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27068089>Macrophage Apoptosis Triggered by IpaD from Shigella flexneri.</a></h2><p>Shigellosis, a potentially severe bacillary dysentery, is an infectious gastrointestinal disease caused by Shigella spp. Shigella invades the human colonic  and avoids clearance by promoting apoptosis of resident immune cells in the . This process is dependent on the Shigella type III secretion system (T3SS), which injects effector proteins into target cells to alter their normal cellular functions. Invasion plasmid antigen D (IpaD) is a structural component that forms a complex at the tip of the T3SS apparatus needle. Recently, IpaD has also been shown to indirectly induce apoptosis in  lymphocytes. In this study, we explored the cytotoxicity profile during macrophage infection by Shigella and discovered that the pathogen induces macrophage cell death independent of caspase-1. Our results demonstrate that IpaD triggers apoptosis in macrophages through activation of host caspases accompanied by mitochondrial disruption. Additionally, we found that the IpaD N-terminal domain is necessary for macrophage killing and SipD, a structural homologue from Salmonella, was found to promote similar cytotoxicity. Together, these findings indicate that IpaD is a contributing factor to macrophage cell death during Shigella infection.Copyright © 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

For a long time, Campylobacter jejuni has been considered as a commensal microorganism which colonizes its primary host rather than infecting it, in the absence of any obvious clinical signs. However, recent studies question this and argue for a deeper understanding of the host-bacteria interaction. Following oral uptake, it was demonstrated that C. jejuni interacts intimately with the   and influences cellular functions of the host, with consequences on nutrient absorption. The immune reaction of the host which was revealed in some studies confirmed the infectious nature of C. jejuni. In agreement with this, an increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes was noticed. The ability to induce intestinal damage and to modulate the barrier function of the intestinal epithelia has further consequences on  integrity, as it facilitates the paracellular passage of C. jejuni into the underlying tissues and it supports the translocation of luminal bacteria such as Escherichia coli to internal organs. This is associated with an alteration of the  microbiota as infected birds have a significantly lower abundance of E. coli in different parts of the intestine. Some studies found that the  microbiota influences the infection and translocation of C. jejuni in chickens in various ways. The effects of C. jejuni on the intestinal function of chickens already indicate a possible interference with bird performance and welfare, which was confirmed in some experimental studies. Furthermore, it could be demonstrated that a Campylobacter infection has an influence on the movement pattern of broiler flocks, supporting experimental studies. The intense interaction of C. jejuni with the chicken supports its role as an infectious agent instead of simply colonizing the . Most of the findings about the impact of Campylobacter on chickens are derived from studies using different Campylobacter isolates, a specific type of bird and varying experimental design. However, experimental studies demonstrate an influence of the aforementioned parameters on the outcome of a certain trial, arguing for improved standardization. This review summarizes the actual knowledge of the host-pathogen interaction of C. jejuni in chickens, emphasizing that there are still major gaps despite recently gained knowledge. Resolving the cascade from oral uptake to dissemination in the organism is crucial to fully elucidating the interaction of C. jejuni with the chicken host and to assess the clinical and economic implications with possible consequences on preventive interventions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28535698>Effect of urolithins on oxidative stress of colorectal adenocarcinomacells-Caco-2.</a></h2><p>Urolithins (UROs) are metabolites derived from ellagic acid (EA) and ellagitannins (ETs) by  microbiota after consumption of different ETs.

The aim of this work was at assessing the effect of URO-A; -; -C; -D on the oxidative status of colon  using as a model colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line (Caco-2). No significant cytotoxic effects of UROs was noted, with the applied treatments. Supplementation of cell growth medium with a mixture of UROs decreased the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species both after short- and long-term exposure.

The goal was to determine the effect of Eimeria maxima infection on the expression of genes that encode peptide and amino acid transporters (AATs), and also to determine whether decreased feed intake contributes to the change in gene expression by including a pair-fed group of broilers. Three groups of male Ross broilers: 1) not infected, 2) infected, and 3) not infected pair-fed groups were used. Chicks were infected with 1,000 oocysts of E. maxima at 21 d of age. Feed consumption was obtained daily, and at d 0, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14 post-infection (PI), 6 birds were euthanized, and a portion of the jejunum was removed for qRT-PCR. Infected birds had significantly decreased feed consumption between d 6 to 9 PI. At d 7 PI infected birds had a 45% reduction in weight gain, and pair-fed birds had a 32% reduction in weight gain. The feed conversion ratio at d 7 PI of infected birds was 2.2 while that of pair-fed birds was 1.7, compared to 1.5 in uninfected birds. Growth parameters were more affected in infected birds than in pair-fed birds. By measuring expression levels of nutrient uptake and processing genes via qRT-PCR, it was determined that genes encoding proteins located at the brush border of the   were affected by infection as well as change in feed intake. The expression of AATs °AT, °,+AT, EAAT3, and PepT1 in infected birds decreased sharply at the height of infection; however, in birds that were pair fed, an increase in expression of °,+AT, and PepT1 was observed, and little change was seen in expression of °AT and EAAT3.

These unique phagocytic epithelial cells enable the mucosal immune system to sample antigens within the lumen of the intestine. The differentiation of M cells from uncommitted precursors in the FAE is dependent on the production of receptor activator of nuclear factor-κ ligand (RANKL) by subepithelial stromal cells. The ligation of a variety of cell surface receptors activates the nuclear factor-κ (NF-κ) family of transcription factors which in-turn induce the transcription of multiple target genes. RANKL-stimulation can stimulate the nuclear translocation of the NF-κ subunit c-Rel. We therefore used c-Rel-deficient mice to determine whether the differentiation and functional maturation of M cells in the Peyer's patches was dependent on c-Rel. Our data show that c-Rel-deficiency does not influence the expression of RANKL or RANK in Peyer's patches, or the induction of M-cell differentiation in the FAE. RANKL-stimulation in the differentiating M cells induces the expression of SpiB which is essential for their subsequent maturation. However, SpiB expression in the FAE was also unaffected in the absence of c-Rel. As a consequence, the functional maturation of M cells was not impaired in the Peyer's patches of c-Rel-deficient mice. Although our data showed that the specific expression of CCL20 and ubiquitin D in the FAE was not impeded in the absence of c-Rel, the expression of ubiquitin D was dramatically reduced in the  cell-follicles of c-Rel-deficient mice. Coincident with this, we also observed that the status of follicular dendritic cells in the  cell-follicles was dramatically reduced in Peyer's patches from c-Rel-deficient mice. Taken together, our data show that c-Rel is dispensable for the RANKL-mediated differentiation and functional maturation of M cells.Copyright © 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

This passage involves the neonatal-Fc-receptor (FcRn) binding IgG in the proximal and highly endocytic vacuolated enterocytes in the distal immature small intestine (SI). Recent studies have suggested an involvement of the transcription factor -lymphocyte-induced maturation-protein-1 (Blimp-1) in the regulation of SI maturation in mice. Hence, the objective of the present study was to monitor the development of the intestinal barrier function, in relation to Blimp-1 expression during both natural and precociously induced intestinal maturation in rats.During the suckling period IgG plasma levels increased, while after  closure it temporarily decreased. This corresponded to a high expression of FcRn in the proximal SI  and the presence of vacuolated enterocytes in the distal SI.

In parallel to this epithelial shift, Blimp-1 expression decreased in the distal SI.The switch from foetal- to adult-type , with decreased proximal expression of FcRn and distal replacement of vacuolated enterocytes, was concurrent in the two SI regions and could be used for monitoring SI maturation in the rat.

They are secreted at high levels by placental syncytiotrophoblast into maternal blood during pregnancy, and are implicated in immunoregulation, thromboregulation, and angiogenesis. To determine whether PSGs are expressed in tumors, we characterized 16 novel monoclonal antibodies to human PSG1 and used 2 that do not cross-react with CEACAMs to study PSG expression in tumors and in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract using tissue arrays and immunohistochemistry. Staining was frequently observed in primary squamous cell carcinomas and colonic adenocarcinomas and was correlated with the degree of tumor differentiation, being largely absent from metastatic samples. Staining was also observed in normal oesophageal and colonic . PSG expression in the human and mouse GI tract was confirmed using quantitative RT-PCR. However, mRNA expression was several orders of magnitude lower in the GI tract compared to placenta. Our results identify a non-placental site of PSG expression in the  and associated tumors, with implications for determining whether PSGs have a role in tumor progression, and utility as tumor biomarkers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29899562>Immunome differences between porcine ileal and jejunal Peyer's patches revealed by global transcriptome sequencing of -associated lymphoid tissues.</a></h2><p>The  of the intestinal mucosa and the -associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) constitute an essential physical and immunological barrier against pathogens. In order to study the specificities of the GALT transcriptome in pigs, we compared the transcriptome profiles of jejunal and ileal Peyer's patches (PPs), mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and peripheral blood (PB) of four male piglets by RNA-Seq. We identified 1,103 differentially expressed (DE) genes between ileal PPs (IPPs) and jejunal PPs (JPPs), and six times more DE genes between PPs and MLNs. The master regulator genes FOXP3, GATA3, STAT4, TBX21 and RORC were less expressed in IPPs compared to JPPs, whereas the transcription factor BCL6 was found more expressed in IPPs. In comparison between IPPs and JPPs, our analyses revealed predominant differential expression related to the differentiation of T cells into Th1, Th2, Th17 and iTreg in JPPs. Our results were consistent with previous reports regarding a higher T/ cells ratio in JPPs compared to IPPs. We found antisense transcription for respectively 24%, 22% and 14% of the transcripts detected in MLNs, PPs and PB, and significant positive correlations between PB and GALT transcriptomes. Allele-specific expression analyses revealed both shared and tissue-specific cis-genetic control of gene expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30597072>Modulation of broiler  microbiota and gene expression of Toll-like receptors and tight junction proteins by diet type and inclusion of phytogenics.</a></h2><p>This study evaluated the effect of reduced dietary energy (ME) and crude protein (CP) levels along with inclusion of a phytogenic feed additive (PFA) on  microbiota composition and gene expression of Toll-like receptor(s) (TLR), tight junction proteins, and inflammatory cytokines expressed in secondary lymphoid organs. Depending on dietary ME and CP level down regulation and the inclusion or not of PFA at 125 mg/kg diet, 450 one-day-old male broilers were allocated in the following 6 treatments for 42 D according to a 3 × 2 factorial design: A: diet formulated optimally to meet broiler nutrient requirements; APh: A+PFA; : suboptimal in ME and CP levels by 3%; BPh: +PFA; C: suboptimal in ME and CP levels by 6%; CPh: C+PFA. Diet type and PFA supplementation were shown to affect mostly the mucosa-associated microbiota compared to the luminal ones. Ileal mucosa-associated total bacteria (PD= 0.005), Lactobacillus spp. (PD= 0.003), and Clostridium cluster XIVa (PD= 0.009) were affected by diet type with broilers fed diet  having lower levels compared to broilers fed diets A or C. Moreover, diet type affected cecal mucosa-associated Lactobacillus spp. (PD= 0.002) with broilers fed diet C having lower levels compared to broilers fed diets A or . Supplementation with PFA resulted in higher levels of cecal mucosa-associated Bacteroides (PP= 0.031), Clostridium cluster IV (PP= 0.007), and Clostridium cluster XIVa (PP= 0.039). Diet type affected TLR2 (PD= 0.046) and claudin 5 (PD= 0.027) in cecal . Lower TLR2 (PP= 0.021) and higher zonula occludens 2 (PP= 0.031) relative gene expressions were seen in ileal  following PFA supplementation. Moreover, in cecal , PFA supplementation resulted in lower TLR2 (PP < 0.001) and higher zonula occludens 2 (PP= 0.009), claudin 5 (PP= 0.005) and occludin (PP= 0.039) relative gene expressions. There were no significant diet type and PFA effects on cytokines in secondary lymphoid organs, except for a dietary effect on transforming growth factor beta 4 (PD= 0.023) in cecal tonsils.

Widely available dietary phenolics, curcumin and piperine are purported to have antiinflammatory and anticarcinogenic activities through yet-to-be-delineated multitarget mechanisms. Piperine is also known to increase the bioavailability of dietary components, including curcumin. The objective of the study was to determine whether curcumin and piperine have individual and combined effects in the setting of  inflammation by regulating mTORC1 in human intestinal epithelial cells. Results show that curcumin repressed (a) mTORC1 activity (measured as changes in the phosphorylation state of p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1 and 40S ribosomal protein S6) in a dose-dependent manner (2.5-20 μM, P<.007) and () synthesis of nascent proteins. Piperine inhibited mTORC1 activity albeit at comparatively higher concentrations than curcumin. The combination of curcumin + piperine further repressed mTORC1 signaling (P<.02). Mechanistically, curcumin may repress mTORC1 by preventing TSC2 degradation, the conserved inhibitor of mTORC1. Results also show that a functional mTORC1 was required for the transcription of TNFα as Raptor knockdown abrogated TNFα gene expression. Curcumin, piperine and their combination inhibited TNFα gene expression at baseline but failed to do so under conditions of mTORC1 hyperactivation. TNF∝-induced cyclooxygenase-2 expression was repressed by curcumin or curcumin + piperine at baseline and high mTORC1 levels. We conclude that curcumin and piperine, either alone or in combination, have the potential to down-regulate mTORC1 signaling in the intestinal  with implications for tumorigenesis and inflammation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

To obtain any influence in a specific tissue or organ, these bioactive compounds must be bioavailable, i.e., effectively absorbed from the  into the circulation and transferred to the appropriate location within the body while still maintaining their bioactivity. One of the key factors affecting the bioavailability of anthocyanins is their transport through the  . The Caco-2 cell line, a human intestinal epithelial cell model derived from a colon carcinoma, has been proven to be a good alternative to animal studies for predicting intestinal absorption of anthocyanins. Studies investigating anthocyanin absorption by Caco-2 cells report very low absorption of these compounds. However, the bioavailability of anthocyanins may be underestimated since the metabolites formed in the course of digestion could be responsible for the health benefits associated with anthocyanins.

The osmolarity within the lumen is subjected to high variations meaning that water transport often has to take place against osmotic gradients. It has been hypothesized that LI-cadherin is important in this process by keeping the intercellular cleft narrow facilitating the buildup of an osmotic gradient allowing water reabsorption. LI-cadherin is exceptional among the cadherin superfamily with respect to its localization along the lateral plasma membrane of epithelial cells being excluded from adherens junction. Furthermore it has 7 but not 5 extracellular cadherin repeats (EC1-EC7) and a small cytosolic domain. In this study we identified the peptide VAALD as an inhibitor of LI-cadherin trans-interaction by modeling the structure of LI-cadherin and comparison with the known adhesive interfaces of E-cadherin. This inhibitory peptide was used to measure LI-cadherin dependency of water transport through a monolayer of epithelial CACO2 cells under various osmotic conditions. If LI-cadherin trans-interaction was inhibited by use of the peptide, water transport from the luminal to the basolateral side was impaired and even reversed in the case of hypertonic conditions whereas no effect could be observed at isotonic conditions. These data are in line with a recently published model predicting LI-cadherin to keep the width of the lateral intercellular cleft small. In this narrow cleft a high osmolarity can be achieved due to ion pumps yielding a standing osmotic gradient allowing water absorption from the  even if the faeces is highly hypertonic.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29439001>The Cdx2 homeobox gene suppresses intestinal tumorigenesis through non-cell-autonomous mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Developmental genes contribute to cancer, as reported for the homeobox gene  playing a tumor suppressor role in the .

Patients suffering from IBD, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, present with skeletal complications. However, the mechanism underpinning IBD-associated bone loss remains vague. Intestinal inflammation generates an inflammatory milieu at the intestinal  that leads to dysregulation of mucosal immunity through -residing innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and other cell types. ILCs are recently identified mucosal cells considered as the gatekeeper of  immunity and their function is regulated by intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-secreted cytokines in response to the inflammatory microenvironment. We first demonstrate that serum as well as IECs collected from the intestine of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice contain high levels of inflammatory and osteoclastogenic cytokines. Mechanistically, heightened inflammatory response of IECs was associated with significant intrinsic activation of NF-κ (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated  cells) in IECs and increased frequency of ILC1, ILC3, and myeloid osteoclast progenitors. Validating the central role of IEC-specific NF-κ activation in this phenomenon, conditional expression of constitutively active inhibitor kappa  kinase 2 (IKK2) in IECs in mice recapitulates the majority of the cellular, inflammatory, and osteolytic phenotypes observed in the chemically induced colitis. Furthermore, conditional deletion of IKK2 from IECs significantly attenuated inflammation and bone loss in DSS-induced colitis. Finally, using the DSS-induced colitis model, pharmacologic inhibition of IKK2 was effective in reducing frequency of ILC1 and ILC3 cells, attenuated circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines, and halted colitis-associated bone loss.

Members of the NKR-P1 gene family are expressed in various innate immune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells, and their cognate Clr ligand family members are expressed in various specialized tissues, including the intestinal , where they may play an important role in mucosal-associated innate immune responses. In this study, we show that the inhibitory NKR-P1B receptor, but not the Ly49 receptor, is expressed in -resident NK cells, ILC, and a subset of γδT cells in a tissue-specific manner. ILC3 cells constitute the predominant cell subset expressing NKR-P1B in the  lamina propria. The known NKR-P1B ligand Clr- is broadly expressed in -associated cells of hematopoietic origin. The genetic deletion of NKR-P1B results in a higher frequency and number of ILC3 and γδT cells in the  lamina propria. However, the function of -resident ILC3, NK, and γδT cells in NKR-P1B-deficient mice is impaired during gastrointestinal tract infection by Citrobacter rodentium or Salmonella typhimurium, resulting in increased systemic bacterial dissemination in NKR-P1B-deficient mice.

A treat-to-target approach is strongly advocated, consisting of early and aggressive inflammatory control. However, a great proportion of affected subjects lack response or are intolerant to conventional therapy. Even though the first-line biologic therapy targeting tumor necrosis factor-alfa (TNF-α) is associated with improvement of inflammation in some patients, others do not respond at first or lose response over time. These findings brought about the possibility of different mechanisms being involved in perpetuating the chronic inflammatory state. Novel drugs targeting different inflammatory pathways have been studied in CD, specifically addressed to leucocyte trafficking.

Recently, we reported a high prevalence of Helicobacter suis (H. suis) in patients with Parkinson's disease. Here, we evaluated the effect of gastric H. suis infection on the brain in mice. One month of infection with H. suis resulted in increased brain inflammation, reflected in activation of microglia and cognitive decline. Additionally, we detected choroid plexus inflammation and disruption of the epithelial blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier upon H. suis infection, while the endothelial blood-brain barrier (BBB) remained functional. These changes were accompanied by leakage of the gastrointestinal barrier and low-grade systemic inflammation, suggesting that H. suis-evoked gastrointestinal permeability and subsequent peripheral inflammation induces changes in brain homeostasis via changes in blood-CSF barrier integrity. In conclusion, this study shows for the first time that H. suis infection induces inflammation in the brain associated with cognitive decline and that the choroid plexus is a novel player in the stomach-brain axis.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

How such changes affect ENS development and its subsequent function throughout life is an emerging field of study that holds great interest but which is inadequately explored thus far. In this addendum, we discuss our recent findings showing that a component of the ENS, the enteric glial cell network that resides in the  lamina propria, develops after birth and parallels the evolution of the  microbiota. Importantly, this network was found to be malleable throughout life by incorporating new cells that arrive from the area of the  wall in a process of directional movement which was controlled by the lumen  microbiota.

Before activating the immune system, gluten peptides are transferred by the epithelial barrier to the mucosal lamina propria, where they are deamidated by intestinal tissue transglutaminase 2. As a result, they strongly bind to human leucocyte antigens (HLAs), especially HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8, expressed on antigen-presenting cells. This induces an inflammatory response, which results in small bowel enteropathy. Although gluten is the main external trigger activating both innate and adaptive (specific) immunity, its presence in the intestinal lumen does not fully explain CD pathogenesis. It has been hypothesized that an early disruption of the  barrier in genetically susceptible individuals, which would result in an increased intestinal permeability, could precede the onset of gluten-induced immune events. The intestinal barrier is a complex functional structure, whose functioning is dependent on intestinal microbiota homeostasis, epithelial layer integrity, and the -associated lymphoid tissue with its intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs).

The effector Shigella enterotoxin 2 (ShET2), or OspD3, is encoded by the sen or ospD3 gene on the virulence plasmid. Previous literature has suggested that ospD3 is in an operon downstream of the ospC1 gene, and expression of both genes is controlled by a promoter upstream of ospC1. Since the intergenic region is 328 bases in length and contains several putative promoter regions, we hypothesized the genes are independently expressed. Here we provide data that ospD3 and ospC1 are not co-transcribed and that OspC1 is not required for OspD3/ShET2 function. Most importantly, we identified strong promoter activity in the intergenic region and demonstrate that OspD3/ShET2 can be expressed and secreted independently of OspC1.

We compared O2-consumption and N excretion rates in vivo, and sodium, chloride, glucose, and ammonia transport characteristics of  sac preparations in vitro. The Pacu had a significantly higher weight-specific oxygen consumption, and a lower N/Q ratio than the omnivorous Tambaqui, and a significantly lower urea-N excretion rate than the carnivorous black Piranha, suggesting N-limitation in the herbivorous Pacu. With a value of 2.62 ± 0.15,  to fork length ratio in the Pacu was about 2.5 times higher than in the black Piranha, and 2.0 times higher than in the Tambaqui. Anterior intestinal activities of three enzymes involved in N-fixation for amino acid synthesis (glutamate dehydrogenase, glutamate-oxaloacetate transferase, and glutamate-pyruvate transferase) were generally greatest in the carnivore and lowest in the herbivore species. In all three species, sodium, chloride, glucose, and ammonia were taken up at high rates from the intestine, resulting in an isosmotic fluid flux. Comparing the area-specific fluid flux of the anterior, mid, and posterior  sections, no difference was detected between the three sections of the Pacu, while in the Tambaqui, it was highest in the anterior section, and in the black Piranha highest in the middle section. Overall, the area-specific uptake rates for sodium, chloride, glucose, and ammonia of anterior, mid, and posterior sections were similar in all three species, indicating that there is no difference in the area-specific transport rates associated with trophic position. The net ammonia uptake flux from  interior was not significantly different from the net ammonia efflux to the serosal fluid, so that the ammonia removed from the intestine by the mucosal  was quantitatively transferred through the tissue to the serosal side in all three species. Thus, metabolic activity of  tissue did not significantly influence the net ammonia transfer. Due to the much higher  to fork length ratio, the overall transport capacity of the  of the herbivorous Pacu by far exceeded the transport capacity of their carnivorous and omnivorous relatives, thus compensating for the lower digestibility and the low Na(+), Cl(-), and N-content of the plant diet.

The intestinal epithelial tissue derived from 19-day-old chicken embryo was cultured in Matrigel and the dynamic properties of the forming organoids were analyzed by time-lapse image analysis. It was observed that about one in ten organoids actively moved through the matrix, at a speed of 10-20 μm/h. Moreover, rotation was observed in the majority of organoids that did not migrate long distances. The fusion events took place between organoids, which collided during the movement or growth. In our previous paper, we showed that the presence of Toll-like receptor 4 ligand, Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 μg/ml), increased the mean organoid diameter. Here, we confirm this result and demonstrate that the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632 (10 μM) did not completely abolish organoid migration, but prevented the fusion events, in both LPS-treated and untreated cultures. In consequence, in the presence of Y-27632, the differences between cultures incubated with and without LPS were not visible. We conclude that migration and fusion of organoids may influence their morphology and suggest that these phenomena should be taken into account during the design of experimental settings.</p></html>
