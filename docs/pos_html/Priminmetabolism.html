IC₅₀ values comparable with COX reference inhibitor indomethacin were recorded for several quinones (, alkannin, diospyrin, juglone, 7-methyljuglone, and shikonin). For some of the compounds, we suggest the redox potential of quinones as the mechanism responsible for in vitro COX inhibition because of the quantitative correlation with their pro-oxidant effect. Structure-relationship activity studies revealed that the substitutions at positions 2 and 5 play the key roles in the COX inhibitory and pro-oxidant actions of naphthoquinones. In contrast, the redox mechanism alone could not explain the activity of , embelin, alkannin, and diospyrin. For these four quinones, molecular modeling suggested similar binding modes as for conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17827773>A new dihydrobenzofuran derivative from the endophytic fungus Botryosphaeria mamane PSU-M76.</a></h1><p>One new dihydrobenzofuran derivative, botryomaman (1), was isolated from the broth extract of the endophytic fungus Botryosphaeria mamane PSU-M76 along with six known compounds, 2,4-dimethoxy-6-pentylphenol, (R)-(-)-mellein, , cis-4-hydroxymellein, trans-4-hydroxymellein and 4,5-dihydroxy-2-hexenoic acid.

The Claisen-based methodology was extended to the first synthesis of the marine benzoquinones verapliquinones A and B (5 and 6), and panicein A (7). Isoarnebifuranone (9) was also synthesized by a similar strategy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23472470>Inhibition of in vitro leukotriene B4 biosynthesis in human neutrophil granulocytes and docking studies of natural quinones.</a></h1><p>Quinones are compounds frequently contained in medicinal plants used for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Therefore, the impact of plant-derived quinones on the arachidonic acid  pathway is worthy of investigation. In this study, twenty-three quinone compounds of plant origin were tested in vitro for their potential to inhibit leukotriene B4 (LTB4) biosynthesis in activated human neutrophil granulocytes with 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) activity. The benzoquinones  (3) and thymohydroquinone (4) (IC50 = 4.0 and 4.1 microM, respectively) showed activity comparable with the reference inhibitor zileuton (1C50 = 4.1 microM). Moderate activity was observed for the benzoquinone thymoquinone (2) (1C50 = 18.2 microM) and the naphthoquinone shikonin (1) (IC50 = 24.3 microM). The anthraquinone emodin and the naphthoquinone plumbagin (5) displayed only weak activities (IC50 > 50 microM). The binding modes of the active compounds were further evaluated in silico by molecular docking to the human 5-LOX crystal structure. This process supports the biological data and suggested that, although the redox potential is responsible for the quinone's activity on multiple targets, in the case of 5-LOX the molecular structure plays a vital role in the inhibition. The obtained results suggest  as a promising compound for the development of dual COX-2/5-LOX inhibitors.</p></html>
