Polygonatum kingianum has been used in the treatment of  and related diseases in China for centuries. Total saponins (TSPK) and total polysaccharides (PSPK) were reported to be major types of active constituents of P. kingianum. This research aims at investigation of their therapeutical mechanisms on  based on the regulation of gut microbiota.Type 2  (T2D) rats were induced by high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin-injection from male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. The blood biochemical indicators were measured. Intestinal microbial diversities and the overall structural changes in gut microbiota and the contents of the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were discussed.T2D rats were treated with TSPK (0.025 and 0.1g/kg) and PSPK (0.1g/kg) for 56 days. Major biochemical indexes, such as fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FINS) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), were measured. Intestinal microbial diversities and the overall structural changes in gut microbiota were discussed based on the sequencing results on V4 region of 16S rDNA. Moreover, the contents of the SCFAs in faeces, which were fermentation products produced from gut microbiota were determined by gas chromatography (GC).Oral administration of TSPK and PSPK prevented the increase of FBG. TSPK (0.025g/kg) enhancing the content of FINS at the end of research. Furthermore, TSPK and PSPK improved the intestinal microecology by decreasing the abundances of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, and increasing that of Firmicutes. However, TSPK.L, PSPK and TSPK.H displayed discrepant regulation roles on Firmicutes. TSPK.L and PSPK significantly increased the abundance of Ruminococcaceae family and Ruminococcus genus in Firmicutes phylum, however, TSPK.H increased the abundances of Veillonellaceae family and Anaerovibrio genus. 57 Key variables, altered after treated by TSPK and PSPK, correlated to the alternations of FBG, FINS, LPS and body weight were identified. In addition, TSPK.L, PSPK and TSPK.H showed different adjustment on the contents of SCFAs.These results suggested that, compared to the normal rats, the structure of gut microbiota was significantly changed in diabetic rats. Oral administration with TSPK and PSPK could prevent T2D by its regulation role on the gut microbiota.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

Ophiopogonis Radix is a common Chinese herb that is popularly used as functional food in China. Polysaccharide and steroidal saponin, e.g., ophiopogonin, mainly ophiopogonin D (Oph-D) and ophiopogonin D' (Oph-D'), are the major constituents in this herb. In order to reveal the role of gut  in metabolizing ophiopogonin, an in vitro metabolism of Oph-D and Oph-D' by human gut , in combination with or without  polysaccharide, was conducted. A sensitive and reliable UPLC-MS/MS method was developed to simultaneously quantify Oph-D, Oph-D' and their final metabolites, i.e., ruscogenin and  in the broth of . An elimination of Oph-D and Oph-D' was revealed in a time-dependent manner, as well as the recognition of a parallel increase of ruscogenin and .  polysaccharide was shown to stimulate the gut -induced metabolism of ophiopogonins. This promoting effect was further verified by increased activities of β-D-glucosidase, β-D-xylosidase, α-L-rhamnosidase and β-D-fucosidase in the broth. This study can be extended to investigate the metabolism of steroidal saponins by gut  when combined with other herbal products, especially those herbs enriched with polysaccharides.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29085554>Biotransformation of  by Rat Intestinal Microflora and Cardioprotective Effects of .</a></h2><p>Studying the biotransformation of natural products by intestinal microflora is an important approach to understanding how and why some medicines-particularly natural medicines-work. In many cases, the active components are generated by metabolic activation. This is critical for drug research and development. As a means to explore the therapeutic mechanism of  (DN), a medicinal plant used to treat myocardial ischemia (MI), metabolites generated by intestinal microflora from DN were identified, and the cardioprotective efficacy of these metabolites was evaluated. Our results demonstrate that  is the main metabolite produced by rat intestinal microflora from DN. Further, our results show that  protects the myocardium against ischemic insult through increasing enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant levels  and by decreasing oxidative stress damage. These mechanisms explain the clinical efficacy of DN as an anti-MI drug.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30305604> promotes antitumor immunity and PD-1 antibody efficacy against melanoma by regulating intestinal .</a></h2><p>, a natural steroidal saponin, can exert antitumor effect by regulating immune function and improving intestinal . The response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy is associated with intestinal  and effector T cells in tumor microenvironment. We hypothesize that the modulation of  on intestinal  can facilitate antitumor immunity and the therapeutic efficacy of PD-1 antibody. In melanoma-bearing C57BL/6 mice, we observed that the anti-melanoma effect of  relied more on antitumor immunity than direct tumor inhibition activity evidenced by obvious CD4/CD8 T-cell infiltration and IFN-γ expression in tumor tissues, and it could improve the compositions of intestinal . Antibiotics impaired the therapeutic efficacy and immunity responses of  through disturbing intestinal , indicating the importance of intestinal  in 's in vivo antitumor activity. More importantly, the combined administration of PD-1 antibody with  aggravated the tumor necrosis and apoptosis by eliciting augmented T-cell responses. Taken together,  can be used as a microecological regulator to induce antitumor immunity and improve the efficacy of immune checkpoint antibody, making it more suitable for the treatment of malignant tumors.</p></html>
