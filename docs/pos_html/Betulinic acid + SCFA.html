Nicolson (Araceae), commonly called Suran or Jimmikand, has high medicinal value and is used ethnomedicinally for the treatment of different gastrointestinal and inflammatory disorders.The present study evaluated the effects of extracts of Amorphophallus paeoniifolius tubers on acetic acid-induced ulcerative  (UC) in rats.Wistar rats were orally administered methanol extract (APME) or aqueous extract (APAE) (250 and 500 mg/kg) or standard drug, prednisolone (PRDS) (4 mg/kg) for 7 days. On 6th day of treatment, UC was induced by transrectal instillation of 4% acetic acid (AA) and after 48 h  was assessed by measuring  parameters, biochemical estimations and histology of colon.APME or APAE pretreatment significantly (p < .05-.001) prevented AA-induced reduction in body weight and increase in  parameters viz. stool consistency, colon weight/length ratio and ulcer score, area and index. Extracts treatment attenuated (p < .001) increase in alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase in serum and myeloperoxidase activity and cytokines in colon tissue due to AA administration. Extracts treatment prevented AA-induced elevation in lipid peroxidation and decline in activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase and reduced-glutathione content (p < .05-.001) along with histopathological alterations. PRDS also showed similar ameliorative effect on .APME and APAE showed a preventive effect on UC, and ameliorated inflammation and oxidative damage in colon. The effects may be attributed to presence of phytochemicals, , β-sitosterol, and glucomannan. In conclusion, the tuber of Amorphophallus paeoniifolius exhibited an anticolitic effect through anti-inflammatory and antioxidant action.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27593449>Evaluation of seasonal changes of triterpenic acid contents in Viscum album from different host trees.</a></h2><p>Viscum album L. (Loranthaceae) is a semi-parasitic plant used in pharmacy and medicine mostly for its hypotensive and anticancer activity. The effects may be related to the presence of triterpenic acids, such as betulinic (BA) and oleanolic (OA) acids.In our investigations the content of triterpenic acids in V. album from different host trees depending on the season of harvest was determined.V. album herb was dried and extracted with ethyl acetate using ultrasound energy. The reversed phase HPLC-PDA method was used for the analysis of triterpenic acids. The structure of the target components was confirmed by mass spectrometry with an electrospray ionization source.Diversity in the content of both compounds was noted; however, OA was the dominant triterpenic acid and the amount thereof was ∼10 times higher than that of BA. The analysis of changes in the amount of triterpenic acids during the spring-winter period revealed the highest content of OA in summer (from 6.84 to 13.65 mg/g). In turn, in the other seasons of harvest, the content was in the range of 4.41-9.83, 6.41-9.56 and 5.59-12.16 mg/g for spring, autumn and winter, respectively. In most cases, a similar tendency was observed for BA.In most cases, the highest amount of the investigated compounds was found in summer; thus, this period seems to be optimal for acquisition of plant material rich in triterpenic acids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30296385>Improved accumulation of betulin and  in cell suspension culture of Betula pendula roth by abiotic and biotic elicitors.</a></h2><p>Betulin (B) and  (BA) are two triterpenes with diverse pharmacological and physiological actions. Elicitation of Betula pendula Roth cell cultures by elicitors is an excellent strategy to increase B and BA levels. Six abiotic and biotic elicitors were studied to improve accumulation of B and BA in the cell culture of B. pendula. The B and BA production in treated cells was verified by HPLC. The results showed the maximum growth index (7) on day 3 in cells treated with 0.5 mg L chlorocholine chloride (CCC). The increased accumulation of BA in the cells treated with 200 mg L of chitosan was found to be 5.9 × (6.5 mg g DW) higher over control cells. Treating the cells with 2 mg L of CCC, after 7 days, led to 149.3× enhancement of B content (19.4 mg g DW) over the controls. Production of this triterpenoid at a much shorter time with a much higher growth rate can be economic and lead to producing large amounts of B and BA for anti-cancer and HIV drugs preparation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29279966> alleviates dextran sulfate sodium-induced  and visceral pain in mice.</a></h2><p> (BA) exhibits many biological effects including anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities. Free radicals and pro-inflammatory mediators play an important role in the pathology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and associated pain. We, therefore, examined the anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-nociceptive potential of BA in .  was induced with 3% (w/v) dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water in mice for 1to7 days. BA (3, 10 and 30 mg/kg) was given orally for 0 to 7 days. BA was also tested for its efficacy in acetic acid and mustard oil-induced visceral nociception in mice at same doses. BA significantly prevented diarrhea; bleeding and colonic pathological changes induced by DSS. Further, BA reduced the colon nitrite, malondialdehyde, myeloperoxidase, and lipid hydroperoxide levels and restored the superoxide dismutase, catalase and reduced glutathione levels to normalize the redox balance in DSS-exposed mice. Inflammatory mediators like matrix metalloproteinase-9 and prostaglandin E2 levels were also significantly attenuated by BA in  mice. Additionally, BA reduced acetic acid and mustard oil-induced visceral pain in mice. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that BA possesses good anti-nociceptive activity and the anti-IBD effects of BA are due to its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory potential.</p></html>
