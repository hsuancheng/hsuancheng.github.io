We investigated the actions of  and A2 in the in vitro calcifying fibroblastic-colony forming unit assay which can partially mimic the in vivo anabolic effects of PGE2. It was found that  and A2 both stimulated colony formation in a dose-dependent manner with a maximum at 10(-6) M and to a similar degree to PGE2. In contrast to PGE2,  and PGA2 both caused an inhibition of cAMP accumulation. Furthermore, the addition of protein kinase A inhibitors, H8 and H89, had no significant effect on the stimulation of colony number by PGE2. These data suggest that (a) the bone anabolic effects of PGE1 and E2 are, in part at least, mediated by their dehydration products  and A2 and (b) that they are mediated via pathways not necessarily involving the cAMP/protein kinase A cascade.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9525913>Increased activity of a novel low pH folate transporter associated with lipophilic antifolate resistance in chinese hamster ovary cells.</a></h2><p>Previous studies described a Chinese hamster ovary cell line, PyrR100, resistant to -soluble antifolates due to the loss of an energy-coupled folate exporter resulting in a marked increase in intracellular folate cofactor accumulation. There was, in addition, an unexplained increase in folic acid influx in PyrR100 cells which is shown in this paper to be mediated by a transporter with a low pH optimum. The pH profile for folic acid influx in parental Chinese hamster ovary AA8 cells indicated peak activity at pH 6; this was increased >3-fold in PyrR100 cells. In contrast, methotrexate (MTX) influx in AA8 cells showed two peaks of comparable activities at pH 6 and 7.5; in PyrR100 cells, the component at pH 6 was increased 2-fold. Folic acid was a potent inhibitor of [3H]MTX or [3H]folic acid influx (1 microM) via the low pH route with IC50 values of approximately 1 microM.  was a potent inhibitor of [3H]MTX influx via the reduced folate carrier 1 at pH 7.5 with only a small inhibitory effect on the low pH route. The addition of 10 microM folic acid to PyrR100 cells resulted in a MTX influx pH profile identical to that of AA8 cells, consistent with suppression of the low pH route. In contrast, addition of 25 microM  to PyrR100 cells resulted in a MTX influx pH profile comparable to that of folic acid, consistent with the loss of the reduced folate carrier-mediated component. Inhibition ( approximately 70%) of [3H]folic acid influx by approximately 10 microM unlabeled folic acid at pH 7.5 indicated that the low pH transporter accounts for the majority of folic acid transport at physiological pH. This study demonstrates the functional importance of a low pH folate transporter that is increased when enhanced folic acid entry into cells is required as an adaptive response to antifolate selective pressure. This may represent a mechanism of resistance to new antifolate inhibitors of folate cofactor-dependent enzymes in which cytotoxic activity is limited by expanded cellular folate pools.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23349138>TGA transcription factors and jasmonate-independent COI1 signalling regulate specific plant responses to reactive oxylipins.</a></h2><p>Jasmonates and phytoprostanes are oxylipins that regulate stress responses and diverse physiological and developmental processes. 12-Oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) and phytoprostanes are structurally related electrophilic cyclopentenones, which activate similar gene expression profiles that are for the most part different from the action of the cyclopentanone jasmonic acid (JA) and its biologically active amino acid conjugates. Whereas JA-isoleucine signals through binding to COI1, the bZIP transcription factors TGA2, TGA5, and TGA6 are involved in regulation of gene expression in response to phytoprostanes. Here root growth inhibition and target gene expression were compared after treatment with JA, OPDA, or phytoprostanes in mutants of the COI1/MYC2 pathway and in different TGA factor mutants. Inhibition of root growth by phytoprostanes was dependent on COI1 but independent of jasmonate biosynthesis. In contrast, phytoprostane-responsive gene expression was strongly dependent on TGA2, TGA5, and TGA6, but not dependent on COI1, MYC2, TGA1, and TGA4. Different mutant and overexpressing lines were used to determine individual contributions of TGA factors to cyclopentenone-responsive gene expression. Whereas OPDA-induced expression of the cytochrome P450 gene CYP81D11 was primarily regulated by TGA2 and TGA5, the glutathione S-transferase gene GST25 and the OPDA reductase gene OPR1 were regulated by TGA5 and TGA6, but less so by TGA2. These results support the model that phytoprostanes and OPDA regulate differently (i) growth responses, which are COI1 dependent but jasmonate independent; and (ii) lipid stress responses, which are strongly dependent on TGA2, TGA5, and TGA6. Identification of molecular components in cyclopentenone signalling provides an insight into novel oxylipin signal transduction pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16979589>Addition of electrophilic lipids to actin alters filament structure.</a></h2><p>Pathophysiological processes associated with oxidative stress lead to the generation of reactive lipid species. Among them, lipids bearing unsaturated aldehyde or ketone moieties can form covalent adducts with cysteine residues and modulate protein function. Through proteomic techniques we have identified actin as a target for the addition of biotinylated analogs of the cyclopentenone prostaglandins 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-PGJ(2) (15d-PGJ(2)) and PGA(1) in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. This modification could take place in vitro and mapped to the protein C-terminal end. Other electrophilic lipids, like the isoprostane 8-iso-PGA(1) and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, also bound to actin. The C-terminal region of actin is important for monomer-monomer interactions and polymerization. Electron microscopy showed that actin treated with 15d-PGJ(2) or 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal formed filaments which were less abundant and displayed shorter length and altered structure. Streptavidin-gold staining allowed mapping of biotinylated 15d-PGJ(2) at sites of filament disruption. These results shed light on the structural implications of actin modification by lipid electrophiles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18034160>Anti-inflammatory lipid mediator 15d-PGJ2 inhibits translation through inactivation of eIF4A.</a></h2><p>The signaling lipid molecule 15-deoxy-delta 12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) has multiple cellular functions, including anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic activities. Here, we report that 15d-PGJ2 blocks translation through inactivation of translational initiation factor eIF4A. Binding of 15d-PGJ2 to eIF4A blocks the interaction between eIF4A and eIF4G that is essential for translation of many mRNAs. Cysteine 264 in eIF4A is the target site of 15d-PGJ2. The antineoplastic activity of 15d-PGJ2 is likely attributed to inhibition of translation. Moreover, inhibition of translation by 15d-PGJ2 results in stress granule (SG) formation, into which TRAF2 is sequestered. The sequestration of TRAF2 contributes to the anti-inflammatory activity of 15d-PGJ2. These findings reveal a novel cross-talk between translation and inflammatory response, and offer new approaches to develop anticancer and anti-inflammatory drugs that target translation factors including eIF4A.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3663753>[Nonenzymatic incorporation of  into phospholipids in rat liver microsomes].</a></h2><p>The incorporation of [5,6(n)-3H] () and [1-14C]oleic acid into membrane phospholipids of rat liver microsomes was studied.

Three partially purified membrane fractions were obtained by sucrose density gradient centrifugation at the final step of purification from crude homogenate. About 96% of the basal and 89% of PGE2-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in the homogenate were recovered in three membrane fractions. Two lighter membrane fractions (I and II), which were enriched 11-fold and 8.4-fold in adenylate cyclase activity over crude homogenate, were pooled and subjected to various studies. Results suggested that the basal activity of the membrane preparations has, as in many other cell types, a relatively broad pH optimum (pH 7.5 to 8.5), requires Mg2+, which must be present in excess ATP, and is inhibited by Ca2+. Highly reactive sulfhydryl group(s), which may be present in the  bilayer, is required for the adenylate cyclase activity. Because both fluoride ions and GTP augment the enzymatic activity, P388D1 cell membrane adenylate cyclase must possess stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding protein. The membrane preparations respond to exogeneously added PG by 1.5-fold to 3-fold increase in adenosine 3'-5' cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) production. The magnitude of PG-responsiveness was dependent on the types of PG and the order of potency in stimulation was PGE1 greater than PGE2 greater than PGI2. , B1, B2, F1 alpha, and F2 alpha stimulated adenylate cyclase only at the highest concentration tested.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10487535>Inhibitory effects of  on membrane transport of folates mediated by both the reduced folate carrier and ATP-driven exporters.</a></h2><p>Studies are reported that describe the multifaceted inhibitory effects of  () on processes that govern the transport of folates across the plasma membrane of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells: the reduced folate carrier, RFC1, and ATP-dependent exporters.  was a noncompetitive inhibitor of MTX influx mediated by RFC1 with a Ki of approximately 21 microM. The onset of inhibition was virtually instantaneous, not reversible, and appeared to require the incorporation of  into the  membrane; surface adsorption alone was insufficient for inhibition of RFC1 transport activity. In contrast, the effect of  on folic acid transport was small (approximately 20% inhibition of total influx), consistent with the observation that the major portion of folic acid transport in CHO cells is mediated by a low pH mechanism distinct from RFC1.  was also a potent inhibitor of the ATP-driven efflux of both MTX and folic acid. At a concentration of 7 microM , the efflux rate constants for these folates were depressed by approximately 70 and approximately 50%, respectively. The net effects of  on the bidirectional folate fluxes translated into marked alterations in net transport. The addition of 7 microM  to cells at steady state with 1 microM MTX produced a rapid onset of net uptake and the achievement of an approximately 3-fold increase in the steady-state free MTX level as compared with untreated CHO cells. The addition of 7 microM  to cells at steady state with 1 microM folic acid produced an approximately 5-fold increase in the free folate level. These studies establish  as a potent inhibitor of both the reduced folate carrier and ATP-driven folate exporter(s). The noncompetitive nature of the inhibition of RFC1 is unique among anionic compounds, which are usually competitive inhibitors of the carrier.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6256749>Prostaglandin I2 modifies both prolactin binding capacity and fluidity of mouse liver membranes.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to determine if prostaglandins alter the fluidity of hepatic membranes and if this, in turn, modifies their ability to bind prolactin. Liver homogenates of adult C3H female mice incubated with 1-1000 nM , A2, B2, F1 alpha, 6-keto-F1 alpha, E1, E2, I2, or thromboxane B2 provided the 100,000 X g membrane pellets for subsequent ovine prolactin binding and membrane fluidity studies. Only membrane preparations treated with prostaglandin I2 showed an increase in specific binding of ovine prolactin. The effect (40-50%) was maximal at 100 nM prostaglandin I2 after 30 min of incubation and was due to an increase in the number of receptor sites. Under the same conditions, prostaglandin I2 induced a 17% decrease in membrane microviscosity. These data suggest that specific prostaglandins may modulate the number of prolactin receptors in vivo by modifying the fluidity of the  bilayer and the subsequent ease with which receptors can assume active configurations within the matrix.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6804622>Possible mechanisms of 15-hydroperoxyarachidonic acid-induced contraction of the canine basilar artery in vitro.</a></h2><p>Pharmacological studies of the contraction induced by 15-hydroperoxyarachidonic acid (15-HPAA) were done in the isolated canine basilar artery. The maximal contractile force produced by 15-HPAA was 1.5 times that of serotonin and was equivalent to that of prostaglandin (PG) F2 alpha or . At concentrations in which reductions of [14C]-6-keto-PGF1 alpha (the breakdown product of PGI2) occurred, both 15-HPAA and tranylcypromine contracted the artery, whereas indomethacin consistently relaxed it. In the case of indomethacin, as the drug inhibited the synthesis of [14C]-PGE2, F2 alpha and thromboxane(TX) B2 (the breakdown product of TXA2) as well, it has been considered that the balances between PGI2 and other vasoconstrictive PGs or TX may regulate the tone of the artery. Furthermore, it was shown that 15-HPAA enhanced the synthesis of lipoxygenase products from [14C]arachidonic acid. Experiments were done, therefore, to know whether these enhanced lipoxygenase products participated in the manifestation of contraction induced by 15-HPAA or not. As a result, although indomethacin did not affect the contraction, significant reductions of the contraction were shown by eicosatetraynoic acid. These results suggest that enhanced synthesis of lipoxygenase products may be involved in eliciting contractile responses of 15-HPAA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29433435>Growth and metabolic characteristics of oleaginous microalgal isolates from Nilgiri biosphere Reserve of India.</a></h2><p>Renewable  for sustainable development is a subject of a worldwide debate since continuous utilization of non-renewable  sources has a drastic impact on the environment and economy; a search for alternative  resources is indispensable. Microalgae are promising and potential alternate  resources for biodiesel production. Thus, our efforts were focused on surveying the natural diversity of microalgae for the production of biodiesel. The present study aimed at identification, isolation, and characterization of oleaginous microalgae from shola forests of Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve (NBR), the biodiversity hot spot of India, where the microalgal diversity has not yet been systematically investigated.Overall the higher biomass yield, higher lipid accumulation and thermotolerance observed in the isolated microalgal strains have been found to be the desirable traits for the efficient biodiesel production. Species composition and diversity analysis yielded ten potential microalgal isolates belonging to Chlorophyceae and Cyanophyceae classes. The chlorophytes exhibited higher growth rate, maximum biomass yield, and higher lipid accumulation than Cyanophyceae. Among the chlorophytes, the best performing strains were identified and represented by Acutodesmus dissociatus (TGA1), Chlorella sp. (TGA2), Chlamydomonadales sp. (TGA3) and Hindakia tetrachotoma (). The Chlamydomonadales sp. recorded with the highest growth rate, lipid accumulation and biomass yield of 0.28 ± 0.03 day (μ), 29.7 ± 0.69% and 134.17 ± 16.87 mg L day, respectively. It was also found to grow well at various temperatures, viz., 25 °C, 35 °C, and 45 °C, indicating its suitability for open pond cultivation. The fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis of stationary phase cultures of selected four algal strains by tandem mass spectrograph showed C16:0, C18:1 and C18:3 as dominant fatty acids suitable for biodiesel production. All the three strains except for Hindakia tetrachotoma () recorded higher carbohydrate content and were considered as potential feed stocks for biodiesel production through hydrothermal liquefaction technology (HTL).In conclusion, the present investigation is a first systematic study on the microalgal diversity of soil and water samples from selected sites of NBR. The study resulted in isolation and characterization of ten potent oleaginous microalgae and found four cultures as promising feed stocks for biodiesel production. Of the four microalgae, Chlamydomonadales sp. (TGA3) was found to be significantly thermo-tolerant and can be considered as promising feedstock for biodiesel production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18566475>CYP4F3B is induced by  in human liver cells: a regulation of the 20-HETE synthesis.</a></h2><p>The regulation of the human liver-specific cytochrome P450 4F3B (CYP4F3B) isoform, a splice variant of the CYP4F3 gene with strong substrate specificity for long chain fatty acids, is yet an unsolved question. This report provides the first evidence that CYP4F3B is uniquely induced by  () in human hepatocyte-like HepaRG cells and leads to the synthesis of 20-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs). Real time PCR, immunoblot analysis with a specific antipeptide antibody, and determination of fatty acid omega-hydroxylase activity demonstrate that  treatment strongly increases expression of CYP4F3B. This induction drives the production of 20-HETE (19-fold increase). SiRNA-mediated-silencing of CYP4F3 suppresses both 20-HETE synthesis and  induced 20-HETE production. Taken together, these results provide evidence that CYP4F3B is the key enzyme to produce 20-HETE by omega-hydroxylation of arachidonic acid in liver cells. Since 20-HETE is a potent activator of PPARalpha and an important inflammatory mediator, CYP4F3B may exert important functions in  homeostasis and in inflammatory diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17164176>Biologically active oxidized lipids (phytoprostanes) in the plant diet and parenteral lipid nutrition.</a></h2><p>Phytoprostanes (PP) are autoxidation products of alpha-linolenate that are present in all plant tissues. Several classes of PP with a prostaglandin (PG) F1-, E1-, A1- and B1-like structure were identified and quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in vegetable oils and parenteral nutrition (intralipid). High levels of PP (0.09 up to 99 mg/l) were found even in apparently fresh vegetable oils. After oral consumption of olive or soybean oil, PPF1 were absorbed, found to circulate in plasma in conjugated form and excreted in free form into urine. Evidence is emerging that certain PP, such as the PPE1, may modulate the function of immune cells in a PG-like fashion. Here, we show that PPA1- and deoxy-PPJ1 display potent anti-inflammatory and apoptosis inducing activities similar to  and deoxy-PGJ2. Results of this study indicate that PP are novel, biologically active lipids in plant nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26487510>Molecular Interactions and Implications of Aldose Reductase Inhibition by  and Clinically Used Prostaglandins.</a></h2><p>Aldose reductase (AKR1B1) is a critical drug target because of its involvement in diabetic complications, , and tumorigenesis. However, to date, development of clinically useful inhibitors has been largely unsuccessful. Cyclopentenone prostaglandins (cyPGs) are reactive lipid mediators that bind covalently to proteins and exert anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects in numerous settings. By pursuing targets for modification by cyPGs we have found that the cyPG  binds to and inactivates AKR1B1. A -AKR1B1 adduct was observed, both by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and by SDS-PAGE using biotinylated  (-B). Insight into the molecular interactions between AKR1B1 and  was advanced by molecular modeling. This anticipated the addition of  to active site Cys298 and the potential reversibility of the adduct, which was supported experimentally. Indeed, loss of biotin label from the AKR1B1--B adduct was favored by glutathione, indicating a retro-Michael reaction, which unveils new implications of cyPG-protein interaction.  elicited only marginal inhibition of aldehyde reductase (AKR1A1), considered responsible for the severe adverse effects of many AKR1B1 inhibitors. Interestingly, other prostaglandins (PGs) inhibited the enzyme, including non-electrophilic PGE1 and PGE2, currently used in clinical practice. Moreover, both  and PGE1 reduced the formation of sorbitol in an ex-vivo model of diabetic cataract to an extent comparable to that attained by the known AKR inhibitor epalrestat. Taken together, these results highlight the role of PGs as AKR1B1 inhibitors and the interest in PG-related molecules as leads for the development of novel pharmacological tools.Copyright © 2015 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11290870>Antitumor activity, optimum administration method and pharmacokinetics of 13,14-dihydro-15-deoxy-deoxy-Delta7 - methyl ester (TEI-9826) integrated in  microspheres (Lipo TEI-9826).</a></h2><p>13,14-Dihydro-15-deoxy-Delta7- methyl ester (TEI-9826), an antitumor prostaglandin analog, is a candidate for clinical trial. In the present study, we examined its biological stability in vitro, antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo, and pharmacokinetics. Although TEI-9826 was rapidly hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid form (TOK-4528), TOK-4528 as well as Delta12-prostaglandin J2 (PGJ2) were found to be stable in rat, mouse and human serum in vitro. TEI-9826 exhibited nearly identical or greater potential antitumor activity compared to Delta12-PGJ2 and Delta7- in vitro against Colon26 tumor cells. Further evaluation of TEI-9826 using the 38 human cancer cell lines panel and COMPARE analysis suggested that its mode of action is quite different from other anticancer agents that are currently used. TEI-9826 was integrated into  microspheres (Lipo TEI-9826) for dosing. Growth inhibition by Lipo TEI-9826 against Colon26 tumor inoculated s.c. in mice depended on administration route, i.e. at 80 mg/kg, no growth suppressive effect was observed for daily bolus i.v., but significant growth suppressive effect was observed for daily i.p., daily s.c. every other day s.c. and 4 times a day continuous (5 min) i.v. These tumor growth-suppressive effects were cytostatic and the tumor started to regrow at the end or a few days after the end of administration. The pharmacokinetic study suggested that maintaining the blood level of TEI-9826 and/or TOK-4528 was essential for their antitumor effects.

Although these actions are very well documented, we have no information on the mechanisms of PGs actions in insect cells. Here we report on the outcomes of experiments designed to test our hypothesis that PGs modulate gene expression in an insect cell line established from pupal ovarian tissue of the moth Helicoverpa zea (BCIRL-HzAM1 cells). We treated cells with either PGA(1) or PGE(1) for 12 or 24h then analyzed cell lysates by 2-D electrophoresis. Analysis of the gels by densitometry revealed substantial changes in protein expression in some of the protein spots we analyzed. These spots were processed for mass spectrometric analysis by MALDI TOF/TOF, which yielded in silico protein identities for all 34 spots. The apparent changes in three of the proteins were confirmed by semi-quantative PCR, showing that the changes in mRNA expression were reflected in changes in protein expression. The 34 proteins were sorted into six categories, protein actions, , signal transduction, protection, cell functions and .

Also, it has been demonstrated that prostaglandin (PG) helps prevent membrane damage by hepatotoxic chemicals. In this study, the authors examined PG's effects on the toxicity of ethanol in the primary culture of rat regenerations.We examined two kinds of parameters, i.e., DNA synthesis and  peroxidation in the primary culture of rat hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were isolated by the collagenase perfusion method. The rate of DNA synthesis was determined by pulse-labelling cultured cells with [3H]-thymidine. Incorporation of (3H)-thymidine was determined by liquid scintillation spectrophotometer. DNA content was measured by the fluorescence spectrophotometer. The  peroxidation was assayed with spectrophotometer.The results were as follows: 1) PG family (, PGD2, PGE1, PGE2, PGG2a, PGI2 & Thromboxane B2) stimulated the DNA synthesis of hepatocytes (especially PGD2 and PGE1), 2) ethanol decreased DNA synthesis by clear dose-dependent manner, 3) the combined treatment of PGD2 or PGE1, prevents the decreasing of DNA synthesis, which was induced by ethanol, 4) in ethanol treatment,  peroxidation was decreased significantly, but PGD2, PGE1 and  were not affected, and 5) PGD2, PGE1 and  decreased  peroxidation with ethanol, significantly.From these results, we concluded that PG could be useful for the treatment of degenerative liver disease and alcohol-induced liver disease in the assumption that further studies on the action mechanisms of PG will continue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25482810>A tandem affinity purification tag of TGA2 for isolation of interacting proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana.</a></h2><p>Tandem affinity purification (TAP) tagging provides a powerful tool for isolating interacting proteins in vivo. TAP-tag purification offers particular advantages for the identification of stimulus-induced protein interactions. Type II bZIP transcription factors (TGA2, TGA5 and TGA6) play key roles in pathways that control salicylic acid, ethylene, xenobiotic and reactive oxylipin signaling. Although proteins interacting with these transcription factors have been identified through genetic and yeast 2-hybrid screening, others are still elusive. We have therefore generated a C-terminal TAP-tag of TGA2 to isolate additional proteins that interact with this transcription factor. Three lines most highly expressing TAP-tagged TGA2 were functional in that they partially complemented reactive oxylipin-responsive gene expression in a tga2 tga5 tga6 triple mutant. TAP-tagged TGA2 in the most strongly overexpressing line was proteolytically less stable than in the other 2 lines. Only this overexpressing line could be used in a 2-step purification process, resulting in isolation of co-purifying bands of larger molecular weight than TGA2. TAP-tagged TGA2 was used to pull down NPR1, a protein known to interact with this transcription factor. Mass spectrometry was used to identify peptides that co-purified with TAP-tagged TGA2. Having generated this TGA2 TAP-tag line will therefore be an asset to researchers interested in stimulus-induced signal transduction processes.</p></html>
