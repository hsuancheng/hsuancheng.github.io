Recent discoveries, which include the specific identification of endogenous cardenolide (endogenous ouabain) and  (marinobufagenin) CTS in humans along with the delineation of an alternative mechanism by which CTS can signal through the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, have increased the interest in this field substantially. Although CTS were first considered important in the regulation of renal sodium transport and arterial pressure, more recent work implicates these hormones in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and fibrosis, the modulation of immunity and of carbohydrate metabolism, and the control of various central nervous functions and even behavior. This review focuses on the physiological interactions between CTS and other regulatory systems that may be important in the pathophysiology of essential hypertension, preeclampsia, end-stage renal disease, congestive heart failure, and . Based on our increasing understanding of the regulation of CTS as well as the molecular mechanisms of these hormone increases, we also discuss potential therapeutic strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15530960>Biologically active substances from amphibians: preliminary studies on anurans from twenty-one genera of Thailand.</a></h2><p>Amphibian skin has been the source of a wide variety of biologically active substances, but less than one-third of the known genera of amphibians have been probed for such active substances. Skins of 21 genera of anurans from Thailand have now been investigated for noxious secretions, toxic substances, and alkaloids. Four genera of bufonid toads (Bufo, Ansonia, Leptophryne, Pedostipes) were toxic due to the presence of bufadienolides or -like compounds. Two species of ranid frogs (Rana raniceps, Rana signata) were toxic, perhaps due to the presence of toxic peptide(s). Two species of rhacophorid frogs (Polypedates) were slightly noxious/toxic. One species of microhylid frog (Kaloula pulchra) was noxious. Trace amounts of pumiliotoxin alkaloids were detected in a ranid frog (Limnonectes kuhli). A further 18 species did not exhibit noxious or toxic properties to a significant extent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15970492>Endogenous digitalis-like ligands and Na/K-ATPase inhibition in experimental .</a></h2><p>Dysregulation of the Na/K-ATPase (NKA) in the kidney, cardiovascular system, and peripheral nervous system is believed to contribute to pathogenesis of  (DM) and its complications. Recently we demonstrated that, in addition to endogenous ouabain (EO), mammalian tissues contain another NKA inhibitor, a  marinobufagenin (MBG). In vitro MBG, a natriuretic and a vasoconstrictor, acts as a selective inhibitor of alpha-1 NKA, the main isoform of the sodium pump in renal tubules and vascular smooth muscle. To determine whether digitalis-like NKA inhibitors are linked to NKA dysregulation in DM, we studied changes in renal excretion and plasma levels of MBG and EO and the activity of erythrocyte NKA in male Wistar rats with type 1 DM and type 2 DM. Rats with type 1 DM were studied four weeks following a single intraperitoneal injection of 65 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ)(n = 12), and rats with type 2 DM were studied 10 weeks after intraperitoneal injection of STZ during the neonatal period (n = 12). Renal excretion and plasma levels of EO did not change in rats with both types of DM as compared to that in the control groups. Renal excretion (57.5 +/- 9.4 pmol/kg/ 3 hours vs. 12.6 +/- 2.1 pmol/kg/ 3 hours; P less than 0.01) and plasma levels (2.23 +/- 0.82 nmol/L vs. 0.29 +/- 0.07 nmol/L; P less than 0.01) of MBG increased, and NKA activity in erythrocytes was inhibited by 50% in rats with type 1 DM as compared to controls. In rats with type 2 DM, plasma levels (1.48 +/- 0.09 nmol/L vs. 0.46 +/- 0.02 nmol/L; P less than 0.01) and renal excretion (21.3 +/- 3.2 pmol/kg/ 3 hours vs. 13.1 +/- 2.1 pmol/kg/ 3 hours) of MBG also became elevated, but less than in the animals with type 1 DM. Accordingly, activity of NKA in erythrocytes from rats with type 2 DM was inhibited by 35%. In vitro treatment of erythrocytes from rats with type 1 and type 2 DM with anti-MBG antibody reversed the DM induced inhibition of the NKA. These results suggest that digitalis-like factors are involved in the pathogenesis of DM and that MBG, rather than EO, is responsible for DM-induced NKA inhibition.</p></html>
