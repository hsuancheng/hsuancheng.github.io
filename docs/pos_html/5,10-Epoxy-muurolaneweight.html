<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667426>Oregano: A potential prophylactic treatment for the intestinal microbiota.</a></h1><p>Prophylactic use of antibiotics in poultry diets has been identified as a problematic practice because of its potential to exacerbate the spread of antibiotic resistance to human pathogens. A range of countries have opted to completely ban the use of antibiotics in animal feed. The animal production industries are looking for alternative ways to effectively control pathogens while providing the performance benefits previously secured by antibiotics in feed. Here, we present evidence that oregano () could be a potential alternative for pathogen control in the poultry industry. Broiler diets were supplemented with oregano powder (0%, 0.%, 1%, and 2%) for six weeks. The capacity for pathogen control was estimated by microbiota profiling of the jejunum, ileum, and caecum content, and in the faeces, by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The concentrations of short-chain fatty acids in the caecal content were also measured, as were villus/crypt parameters in the ileum. There were no differences among treatments in  gain, feed intake, or the concentration of short-chain fatty acids. The height, width, and the surface area of villi in the ileum were not influenced by oregano addition. However, 1% and 2% of oregano produced a significant increase in the villus height to crypt depth ratio. There were no visible histopathological changes in the liver in control and treated groups. Although oregano had no significant effect on overall microbial diversity and gross composition, some specific genera, like ,  and , which include known pathogens, were reduced in relative abundance by oregano treatment. , recognized as a beneficial and probiotic genus, was also suppressed by the oregano treatment.© 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670172>Reliability and validity of the four-level Chinese emergency triage scale in mainland China: A multicenter assessment.</a></h1><p>An effective emergency triage system is lacking in mainland China. The Chinese Emergency Triage Scale (CETS) was developed based on vital complaints and vital parameters, according to Chinese data.The aim of this study was to assess the reliability and validity of the CETS by emergency department (ED) nurses in eight EDs in mainland China.A cross-sectional multi-center study was conducted.Eight EDs in the eastern, western, northern, and central areas of mainland China.A total of 51 ED nurses and 8000 active ED patients participated in the study between May and September 2018 in eight EDs.Standardized triage scenarios and active patients were assigned to nurses who used the CETS for evaluative purposes. Accuracy was defined by concordance with the key for the scenarios and was calculated as percentages. Inter-rater reliability was measured by weighted κ to compare the triage nurse's rating with the research nurse's acuity level for each patient. The triage time and clinical outcome of 1000 active patients per site also were collected. The criterion-related validity of the CETS was evaluated; criteria included ED mortality, number of patients discharged, and admission to ICU or general ward. The relationship between the CETS acuity levels triaged by the research nurse and four possible outcomes was assessed with a cross-classification table, using a chi-square test. The ability of the CETS to predict ED mortality was assessed via the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC).Mean pooled accuracy from all sites was 89.4% (95% CI = 86.9%-91.8%), and the proportion of over-triage slightly exceeded under-triage (6.% vs. 4.1%). There was no difference in accuracy between sites or according to nurse experience. Inter-rater reliability values for triage nurses and research nurses were 0.96 (95% CI = 0.95-0.97), based on the quadratic  κ. Trauma cases were assigned to triage with greater accuracy than were nontrauma cases, both for the scenarios and for active patients. The average triage time of ED nurses in all sites was 151. ± 26.3 s, using the computer-based triage instrument. The chi-square test showed that there was a significant difference in triage time between the CETS levels (p < 0.001). The AUC was 0.968 (95% CI = 0.958-0.979).The CETS is a reliable system for ED triage and can promote rapid and effective triage in mainland China.Copyright © 2019.

A total of 342, 26-d-old Cobb500 broilers were divided into  groups with 6 replicates. Treatments were as follows: (a) Low stocking density (L, 9 birds per cage); (b) High stocking density (H, 12 birds per cage); (c) H + 50 ppm NAM; (d) H + 500 ppm BA; (e) H + 50 ppm NAM + 500 ppm BA (COMB). The results showed that high stocking density significantly reduced the feed intake and  gain of broilers, while COMB improved the growth performance at high stocking density. High stocking density significantly reduced the liver metallothionein content, liver mitochondrial membrane potential and the activities of Na+K+-ATPase and Ca2+Mg2+-ATPase. In contrast, the liver metallothionein contents in the NAM, BA and COMB fed group were higher than those in the H group. COMB increased the activity of ATPase as well, but it failed to enhance the mitochondrial membrane potential. Stocking density also affected gut microbiota of broilers. The high-density group increased the relative abundance of Blautia. Supplementation of BA and NAM increased the abundance of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria, respectively. In conclusion, a combination of NAM and BA can improve the performance, antioxidant capacity, mitochondrial function and intestinal microbiota of broilers at high stocking density.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675354>Risk Factors of Nosocomial Infection for Infants in Neonatal Intensive Care Units: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.</a></h1><p>BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to identify the nosocomial infection (NI) risk factors in neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU). MATERIAL AND METHODS Databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, VANFUN, CNKI, and VTTMS) were searched using index words to find relevant studies published before November 2018. Meta-analyses of relative risk (RR) were performed for the identification of risk factors. RESULTS Data from 22 cohort studies (2270 infants with and 21 605 infants without NI) were included in the meta-analysis. Infant  of <2500 g (RR: 3.44, 95% CI: 2.31-.11), gestational age of <37 weeks (RR: 3.85, 95% CI: 1.87-7.92), mechanical ventilation use (RR: 3.16, 95% CI: 2.21-4.50), venipuncture (RR: 3.01, 95% CI: 1.20-7.57), the incidence of asphyxia (RR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.04-2.71), and feeding intolerance (RR: 2.12, 95% CI: 1.60-2.81) were identified as the risk factors for the incidence of NI. There was no significant publication bias. CONCLUSIONS This study shows that <2500 g infant , gestational age of <37 weeks, mechanical ventilation utility, venipuncture, asphyxia incidence, and feeding intolerance are the risk factors for NI nosocomial infection in infants in NICU. Appropriate preventive  and targeted interventions are needed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662172>Benefits and Barriers to Exercise among Individuals with Class III Obesity.</a></h1><p> In this paper, we describe the degree of exercise and sedentary behavior among individuals with class III obesity, identify perceived benefits and barriers to exercise, and discuss the association of exercise barriers with activity and sedentary behavior.  This was a cross-sectional study at a tertiary care center. Adults with class III obesity referred to the Bariatric Program completed the exercise benefits/barriers scale, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short-Form, and the Sedentary Behavior Questionnaire. Participants were asked to list additional exercise barriers.  The 80 participants engaged in a median of 699.0 MET-minutes/week of physical activity, and were sedentary 10.4 ± 4. hours/day. The mean exercise benefits/barriers score was 126.3 ± 12.8 (barrier score = 31.6 ± .3, benefit score = 87.8 ± 9.4). Less than 60% identified exercise as enjoyable, or a form of social interaction. More than 60% identified exercise barriers related to physical exertion. Additional barriers included pain and musculoskeletal comorbidities (39.4%), psychological factors (14.7%), and  (12.6%). There was no statistically significant association between exercise barriers and sedentary behavior (p = .69) or physical activity (p = .08).  Participants reported low physical activity, with high sedentary behavior and exercise barriers. Physical exertion, pain and musculoskeletal comorbidities were common barriers, which highlights importance of thoughtful exercise with attention to exercise barriers in this population .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657491>Nonosmotic secretion of ADH and salt loss in hyponatremia in Kawasaki disease.</a></h1><p>The precise mechanism of hyponatremia in Kawasaki disease (KD) remains elusive because assessment of volume status based on serial changes in  is lacking.Seventeen patients who were diagnosed with KD and hyponatremia (serum sodium levels < 135 mmol/L) were analyzed. Volume status was assessed based on serial changes in . Plasma arginine vasopressin (ADH), urine electrolytes, and serum cytokine levels were measured at diagnosis of hyponatremia. An increase and decrease in  by >3% was defined as hypervolemia and hypovolemia, respectively.The volume status was hypervolemic in 3 (18%), euvolemic in 14 (82%), and hypovolemic in no (0%) patient. Five (29%) and no (0%) patients were diagnosed with SIADH and hypotonic dehydration, respectively. The contribution of decreased total exchangeable cations (salt loss) to hyponatremia (.9% [interquartile range, 4.3%, 6.7%]) was significantly larger than that of increased total  water (-0.7% [-1.8%, 3.1%]) (p = 0.004). Serum interleukin-6 levels were elevated in all of 9 patients who were evaluated. Among 12 (71%) patients who did not meet the criteria of SIADH and hypotonic dehydration, plasma ADH levels were inappropriately high in 10 patients. These patients were also characterized by euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia and salt loss, which might be compatible with a diagnosis of SIADH.Our study shows that hyponatremia in KD is euvolemic or hypervolemic and is associated with nonosmotic secretion of ADH and salt loss in the majority of patients.© 2019 Japan Pediatric Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667208>An osteogenic helioxanthin derivative suppresses the formation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts.</a></h1><p>The helioxanthin derivative 4-(4-methoxyphenyl)thieno[2,3-b:,4-c']dipyridine-2-carboxamide (TH) is a low-molecular- compound that was identified through screening for osteogenic compounds that enhance the activity of mouse preosteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. In the present study, we found that TH suppressed osteoclast differentiation.Using the hematopoietic stem cells of ddY mice, TH was added to the culture in the experimental group, and the number of osteoclasts was measured with rhodamine phalloidin staining and TRAP staining. In osteo assay, bone resorption area was compared by the von Kossa staining.Specifically, TH inhibited the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-degrading activity of phosphodiesterase (PDE), promoted nitric oxide (NO) production, and dose-dependently suppressed osteoclast differentiation in an osteoclast formation culture of mouse bone marrow cells. The NO-competitive guanylyl cyclase inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) attenuated the suppressive activity of TH on osteoclast differentiation. Conclusion: Given the previously reported suppressive action of cGMP on osteoclastogenesis, our data suggest that TH negatively impacts osteoclast differentiation at least to some extent by stimulating NO production and inhibiting PDE activity, both of which lead to the upregulation of intracellular cGMP. This study supports the potential use of TH as a novel antiosteoporotic reagent that not only stimulates bone formation but also inhibits bone resorption.© 2019 The Japanese Society for Regenerative Medicine.

Also, the influence of LaONPs on macro and trace elements in the rats' femur bone was assessed. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and inductively coupled plasma optical spectrometry (ICP OES) were used for total element determination in the bone after decomposition while laser ablation-ICP-MS (LA-ICP-MS) was used to investigate element distribution (bio-imaging) in the bone. Some differences in element concentrations in the bone between the rats treated with LaONPs at 1.0 mg kg (T1), 10.0 mg kg (T2), and 100 mg kg (T3)  (bw) and the control rats (CTR) were observed. More differences were observed in the bone of rat treated with 10.0 mg kg LaONPs bw. However, the highest change observed was for Mg, which concentration ranged from 5230 ± 12 μg kg for the CTR group to 4130 ± 138 μg kg for the T3 group. Minor changes were observed for Ba, Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mg, Na, Pb, Sr, and Zn between CTR and animals treated with LaONPs at the different levels of concentration. It was possible to observe from LA-ICP-MS analysis that LaONPs were accumulated only on the surface of the bone, not deeper than about  μm. LA-ICP-MS allowed also to investigate the distribution of La and the other elements in a cross section of the femur bone head, where higher amounts of the elements are present at the external part of the bone. Therefore, it was demonstrated that LaONPs are incorporated on the surface of the bone and it has a small influence on some of the other elements evaluated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663091>Poly(triazolyl methacrylate) glycopolymers as potential targeted unimolecular nanocarriers.</a></h1><p>Synthetic glycopolymers are increasingly investigated as multivalent ligands for a range of biological and biomedical applications. This study indicates that glycopolymers with a fine-tuned balance between hydrophilic sugar pendant units and relatively hydrophobic polymer backbones can act as single-chain targeted nanocarriers for low molecular  hydrophobic molecules. Non-covalent complexes formed from poly(triazolyl methacrylate) glycopolymers and low molecular  hydrophobic guest molecules were characterised through a range of analytical techniques - DLS, SLS, TDA, fluorescence spectroscopy, surface tension analysis - and molecular dynamics (MD) modelling simulations provided further information on the macromolecular characteristics of these single chain complexes. Finally, we show that these nanocarriers can be utilised to deliver a hydrophobic guest molecule, Nile red, to both soluble and surface-immobilised concanavalin A (Con A) and peanut agglutinin (PNA) model lectins with high specificity, showing the potential of non-covalent complexation with specific glycopolymers in targeted guest-molecule delivery.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669580>Ecological momentary assessment of the snacking environments of children from racially/ethnically diverse households.</a></h1><p>Children consume nearly one-third of their daily energy intake as snacks (i.e., eating occasions that occur between meals); thus there is a growing interest in understanding what snacking occasions look like in the homes of young children. This study makes use of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to 1) examine differences in the contextual factors, including location, food preparation style, people present, presence of media devices, and overall atmosphere, between meal and snack occasions; and 2) explore differences in the context of snacking occasions across children's gender and  status. Data for the current study came from the Family Matters Study, which included 150 families with children aged -7 years old (n = 25 from each of the following groups: Black/African American, Hispanic, Hmong, Native American, Somali, White). Parents completed an 8-day EMA observation period, during which they were surveyed after each eating occasion with the study child; questions explored contextual factors including location, food preparation style, people present, presence of media devices, and the overall atmosphere of each eating occasion. Differences between meals and snacks were observed; a smaller percentage of snacks (compared to meals) were prepared by the parent, consisted of only homemade food, and were planned ahead of time, as opposed to being served in response to a child's request. Snacks were more likely than other meals to be eaten on the couch and in the presence of a screen. Furthermore, important differences in snacking context were observed by child gender and  status. Findings illuminate opportunities to improve children's overall dietary intake via interventions focused on improving the quality of foods served during snacks, as well as the contextual environment in which snacks are eaten.Copyright © 2019.

Dose applied was 3 mg/10 g fish . After feeding, they were let out into aquarium and kept there for 3 days. Aquarium water containing excreted metabolites was extracted, and sample was purified and finally analyzed by means of HPLC/MS. Expected both primary (products of hydroxylation) and secondary (products of glucuronidation and sulfatation) metabolites of abiraterone acetate were identified. The NMR measurement of one of the prevailing metabolites presumed to be one of possible hydroxy-abiraterones discovered that it is not hydroxy-abiraterone but abiraterone 16,17-epoxide.

The rats in normal feeding group were given a free diet (27 g/d, containing 18% protein fodder), and the rats in protein-malnutrition group were given a low protein diet (27 g/d, containing % protein fodder). The rats in energy-malnutrition group were given a low energy diet (9 g/d, containing 18% protein fodder). After 4 weeks of continuous feeding, 8 rats from each group were sacrificed for malnutrition evaluation. The  of , thymus and spleen were measured. The percentages of spleen T lymphocyte subsets and M1 macrophage were determined by flow cytometry. Plasma interleukins (IL-6 and IL-10) levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The remaining 28 rats in each group were collected for cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) to reproduce the sepsis model, 20 rats of which were used for Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and the other 8 rats were sacrificed at 8 hours after CLP. The levels of plasma IL-6 and IL-10 were determined by ELISA, and the percentage of spleen M1 macrophages was determined by flow cytometry. The mRNA expressions of tissue factor (TF) and plasminogen activation inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in liver tissue were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Pearson correlation method was used to analyze the correlation between the mRNA expressions of TF and PAI-1 and IL-6 in rats after CLP.(1) After 4 weeks of feeding, the rats in the normal feeding group and protein-malnutrition group gained , while those in the energy-malnutrition group lost 25% of their initial . The  of , thymus and spleen in the protein-malnutrition group and the energy-malnutrition group were significantly lower than those in the normal feeding group. Compared with the normal feeding group and the protein-malnutrition group, the percentages of spleen CD3T lymphocytes, CD4T lymphocytes, M1 macrophages and plasma IL-6 levels were significantly increased in the energy-malnutrition group [CD3T lymphocytes percentage: (52.1±3.7)% vs. (46.9±3.9)%, (44.±2.2)%; CD4T lymphocyte percentages: (35.0±3.6)% vs. (26.3±2.2)%, (25.1±2.3)%; M1 macrophage percentages: (8.7±2.0)% vs. (3.2±1.3)%, (4.2±1.1)%; IL-6 (ng/L): 129.4±16.2 vs. 48.1±10.0, 53.0±8.3, all P < 0.05]. (2) Kaplan-Meier survival analysis at 7 days after CLP showed: all rats in the energy-malnutrition group died, and the 7-day cumulative survival rate was significantly lower than that in the normal feeding group and the protein-malnutrition group [0% (0/20) vs. 35% (7/20), 55% (11/20), both P < 0.05]. The mortality of the normal feeding group was 65%, which was consistent with moderate CLP mortality, indicating that the CLP model was successfully prepared. After CLP, the plasma IL-6 level in the protein-malnutrition group was significantly lower than that in the normal feeding group [IL-6 (ng/L): 154.6±34.7 vs. 233.4±41.2, P < 0.05]. Compared with the normal feeding group, the mRNA expressions of TF and PAI-1 in liver and plasma IL-6 levels in the energy-malnutrition group were significantly increased [TF mRNA (2): 4.±2.2 vs. 1.1±0.7, PAI-1 mRNA (2): 3.3±1.8 vs. 1.3±0.9, IL-6 (ng/L): 382.7±118.2 vs. 233.4±41.2, all P < 0.05], the percentage of M1 macrophages in spleen was significantly lowered [(8.9±2.4)% vs. (15.2±.4)%, P < 0.05]. There was no significant difference in plasma IL-10 level among all the groups. Correlation analysis showed that the mRNA expressions of TF and PAI-1 in the liver of rats after CLP were positively correlated with plasma IL-6 level (r = 0.644, r = 0.574, both P < 0.01).Long-term sustained stress (starvation) leads to sustained chronic inflammatory state, and stimulated the release of related inflammatory factors and activation of the coagulation system after infection.

Although postpartum family planning (PPFP) is an increasingly high priority for many countries, uptake and need for PPFP varies in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to characterize postpartum contraceptive use, and predictors and barriers to use, among postpartum women in LMIC.PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, and Global Health databases were searched for articles and abstracts published between January 1997 and May 2018. Studies with data on contraceptive uptake through 12 months postpartum in low- and middle-income countries were included. We used random-effects models to compute pooled estimates and confidence intervals of modern contraceptive prevalence rates (mCPR), fertility intentions (birth spacing and birth limiting), and unmet need for contraception in the postpartum period.Among 669 studies identified, 90 were selected for full-text review, and 35 met inclusion criteria. The majority of studies were from East Africa, West Africa, and South Asia/South East Asia. The overall pooled mCPR during the postpartum period across all regions was 41.2% (95% CI: 15.7-69.1%), with lower pooled mCPR in West Africa (36.3%; 95% CI: 27.0-45.%). The pooled prevalence of unmet need was 48.% (95% CI: 19.1-78.0%) across all regions, and highest in South Asia/South East Asia (59.4, 95% CI: 53.4-65.4%). Perceptions of low pregnancy risk due to breastfeeding and postpartum amenorrhea were commonly associated with lack of contraceptive use and use of male condoms, withdrawal, and abstinence. Women who were not using contraception were also less likely to utilize maternal and child health (MCH) services and reside in urban settings, and be more likely to have a fear of method side effects and receive inadequate FP counseling. In contrast, women who received FP counseling in antenatal and/or postnatal care were more likely to use PPFP.PPFP use is low and unmet need for contraception following pregnancy in LMIC is high. Tailored counseling approaches may help overcome misconceptions and meet heterogeneous needs for PPFP.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667369>Culture of  using indigenous floral extract in the hilly terrains of Koraput district of Odisha, India.</a></h1><p>An experimental design for culturing  in four experimental ponds of size 25 m was taken up in Koraput district of Odisha, India. The ponds were filled with water and  PL were released in the ponds with stocking density @ 4 m.

Water quality parameters like surface water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, transparency, nitrate, phosphate and silicate, chlorophyll  and organic carbon were monitored for 195 days. Significant variation (p < 0.05) in the water quality parameters were observed during the culture period between ponds respectively. Growth parameters like daily growth rate (DGR), specific growth rate (SGR) and condition index (CI) were monitored simultaneously which showed a discrete growth during the first 90 days and then a stable growth form. Length and  relationship of prawns were calculated for all the culture ponds which showed highly positive relationship (p < 0.01) proving unique contribution of feed towards the growth of prawns. Feed conversion ratio (FCR) values (Ranging from 2.74 ± .05 to 2.95 ± 0.04) also proved the greater acceptance of feed towards the growth of prawns.

Thus, DOAC therapy in this population remains controversial.  To investigate rivaroxaban as a safe and effective alternative to warfarin for venous thromboembolism (VTE) treatment and prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation identified as extremely obese or of high .  A retrospective chart review was performed at 2 academic medical centers in patients ≥18 years old and BMI >40 kg/m or  >120 kg, newly initiated on warfarin or rivaroxaban for atrial fibrillation or VTE treatment. The primary end point was incidence of clinical failure, defined as VTE recurrence, stroke incidence, and mortality, within 12 months of initiation. Secondary end points included length of stay (LOS) and bleeding complications.  A total of 176 patients were included, with 84 and 92 patients in the rivaroxaban and warfarin arms, respectively. Clinical failure was lower in the rivaroxaban group but did not reach statistical significance when compared with warfarin (% vs 13%;  = 0.06).

We investigated the safety of naringenin, its effects on metabolic rate, and blood glucose and insulin responses in a single female subject with diabetes. The subject ingested 150 mg naringenin from an extract of whole oranges standardized to 28% naringenin three times/day for 8 weeks, and maintained her usual food intake. , resting metabolic rate, respiratory quotient, and blood chemistry panel including glucose, insulin, and safety markers were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks. Adverse events were evaluated every 2 weeks. We also examined the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), protein kinase A (PKA), and protein kinase G (PKG) in the response of human adipocytes to naringenin treatment. Compared to baseline, the  decreased by 2.3 kg. The metabolic rate peaked at 3.% above baseline at 1 h, but there was no change in the respiratory quotient. Compared to baseline, insulin decreased by 18%, but the change in glucose was not clinically significant. Other blood safety markers were within their reference ranges, and there were no adverse events.  and  mRNA expression was reduced by inhibitors of PPAR and PPAR, but there was no effect of PKA or PKG inhibition. We conclude that naringenin supplementation is safe in humans, reduces  and insulin resistance, and increases metabolic rate by PPAR and PPAR activation. The effects of naringenin on energy expenditure and insulin sensitivity warrant investigation in a randomized controlled clinical trial.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670165>Effects of walking speeds and durations on plantar skin blood flow responses.</a></h1><p>Various walking speeds and durations in daily life cause different levels of ischemia of plantar tissues. It is unclear what walking speeds and durations significantly affect plantar tissue viability and risks for foot ulcers in non-diabetics and diabetics.The aim of this study was to establish the normal response of plantar skin blood flow to different speeds and durations of walking exercise in non-diabetics that would be needed to quantify impaired responses in diabetics.Laser Doppler flowmetry was used to measure plantar skin blood flow of the first metatarsal head in 12 non-diabetics. A 3 × 2 factorial design, including 3 speeds (slow at 3 km/h, moderate at 6 km/h, and fast at 9 km/h) and 2 durations (10 and 20 min), was used in this study. Skin blood flow after walking was expressed as a ratio of skin blood flow before walking. The 3 × 2 two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated  was used to examine the main effects of speeds and durations and their interaction.The walking speed significantly affected skin blood flow responses (p < 0.01). Walking at 9 km/h significantly increased plantar skin blood flow (.71 ± 1.89) compared to walking at 6 km/h (2.1 ± 0.29) and 3 km/h (1.16 ± 0.14), especially at 20-minute walking duration (p < 0.01). The walking duration showed a trend of significance on affecting skin blood flow responses (p = 0.06). There was no significant interaction between walking speeds and durations (p > 0.05).Our results provide the first evidence that walking speeds affect plantar skin blood flow and a fast walking speed (9 km/h) significantly increases plantar skin blood flow compared to moderate (6 km/h) and slow (3 km/h) walking speeds.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The drugs used to treat these conditions are largely inadequate or dangerous, and a well-researched approach based on nutraceuticals would be highly useful. Pterostilbene (Pt), i.e., 3,-dimethylresveratrol, has been reported to be effective in animal models of obesity, acting on different metabolic pathways. We investigate here its ability to induce browning of white adipose tissue. Pt ( µM) was first tested on 3T3-L1 mature adipocytes, and then it was administered (352 µmol/kg/day) to mice fed an obesogenic high-fat diet (HFD) for 30 weeks, starting at weaning. In the cultured adipocytes, the treatment elicited a significant increase of the levels of Uncoupling Protein 1 (UCP1) protein-a key component of thermogenic, energy-dissipating beige/brown adipocytes. In vivo administration antagonized  increase, more so in males than in females. Analysis of inguinal White Adipose Tissue (WAT) revealed a trend towards browning, with significantly increased transcription of several marker genes (, , , , , and ) and an increase in UCP1 protein levels, which, however, did not achieve significance. Given the lack of known side effects of Pt, this study strengthens the candidacy of this natural phenol as an anti-obesity nutraceutical.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671904>Antibacterial Property of Composites of Reduced Graphene Oxide with Nano-Silver and Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles Synthesized Using a Microwave-Assisted Approach.</a></h1><p>Graphene oxide (GO) composites with various metal nanoparticles (NPs) are attracting increasing interest owing to their broad scope in biomedical applications.

Hence, detrusor instability, and subsequently bladder overactivity, may lead to undesirable outcomes including incontinence. Multiple mechanisms may underlie the pathogenesis of detrusor overactivity including inflammation and oxidative stress. Herein, we tested the possibility that CoQ10 may have a potential therapeutic role in detrusor overactivity.Forty adult male Wistar albino rats weighing 100-150 g were used in the present study. Rats were divided (10/group) into control (receiving vehicles), monosodium glutamate (MSG)-treated (receiving  mg/kg MSG daily for 15 consecutive days), MSG + OO-treated (receiving concomitantly  mg/kg MSG and olive oil for 15 consecutive days), MSG + CoQ10-treated (receiving concomitantly  mg/kg MSG and 100 mg/kg CoQ10 daily for 15 consecutive days) groups.MSG resulted in significant increase in bladder  and sensitised the bladder smooth muscles to acetylcholine. MSG has also resulted in significant increase in bladder TNF-α, IL-6, malondialdehyde, nerve growth factor and connexion 43, with significant decrease in the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase. Olive oil had no effect on MSG induced alterations of different parameters. Treatment with CoQ10 has resulted in a significant restoration of all the altered parameters.Taken together, our results suggest that CoQ10 antagonizes the deleterious effects of MSG on detrusor activity. We propose that CoQ10 could be a therapeutic strategy targeting urinary bladder dysfunction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669555>Optimization, stabilization, and characterization of amphotericin B loaded nanostructured lipid carriers for ocular drug delivery.</a></h1><p>The current study sought to formulate, optimize, and stabilize amphotericin B (AmB) loaded PEGylated nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) and to study its ocular biodistribution following topical instillation. AmB loaded PEGylated NLC (AmB-PEG-NLC) were fabricated by hot-melt emulsification followed by high-pressure homogenization (HPH) technique. 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)] (mPEG-2K-DSPE) was used for surface PEGylation. mPEG-DSPE with different PEG molecular , 1K, 2K, 5K, 10K, and 20K, were screened for formulation stability. Furthermore, the AmB loaded PEGylated (2K) NLC (AmB-PEG2K-NLC) was optimized using Box-Behnken design with respect to the amount of AmB, castor oil, mPEG-2K-DSPE, and number of high-pressure homogenization cycles as the factors; particle size, zeta potential, PDI, entrapment efficiency, and loading efficiency as responses. Stability of the optimized AmB-PEG2K-NLC was assessed over 4 weeks, at 4°C as well as 25°C and effect of autoclaving was also evaluated. AmB-PEG2K-NLC were tested for their in vitro antifungal activity against Candida albicans (ATCC 90028), AmB resistant Candida albicans (ATCC 200955) and Aspergillus fumigatus (ATCC 204305). Cytotoxicity of AmB-PEG2K-NLC was studied in human retinal pigmented epithelium cells. In vivo ocular biodistribution of AmB was evaluated in rabbits, following topical application of PEGylated NLCs or marketed AmB preparations. PEGylation with mPEG-2K-DSPE prevented leaching of AmB and increased the drug load significantly. The optimized formulation was prepared with a particle size of 218 ±  nm; 0.3 ± 0.02 PDI, 4.6 ± 0.1% (w/w) drug loading, and 92.7 ± 2.% (w/w) entrapment efficiency. The optimized colloidal dispersions were stable for over a month, at both 4°C and 25°C. AmB-PEG2K-NLCs showed significantly (p<0.05) better antifungal activity in both wild-type and AmB resistant Candida strains and, was comparable to, or better than, commercially available parenteral AmB formulations like Fungizone and AmBisome®. AmB-PEG2K-NLC did not show any toxicity up to a highest concentration of 1% (v/v) (percent formulation in medium). Following topical instillation, AmB was detected in all the ocular tissues tested and statistically significant (p>0.05) difference was not observed between the formulations tested. An optimized autoclavable and effective AmB-PEG2K-NLC ophthalmic formulation with at least one-month stability, in the reconstituted state, has been developed.Copyright © 2019.

GICA-VTE remains a challenging clinical scenario with MB concerns for utilization of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC), especially with active cancer therapies.To evaluate patient risk factors, effectiveness (VTE) and safety (MB) of DOACs and low molecular  heparin (LMWH) in patients with active GICA-VTE.A retrospective chart review of patients receiving DOACs and LMWH with GICA and symptomatic or incidental VTE treated at comprehensive cancer center from November 2013 to February 2017 was performed. Inclusion criteria included active GI cancer diagnosed at any stage or treatment +/- 6 mo of VTE diagnosis, whom were prescribed 6 mo or more of DOACs or LMWH. The Chi-squared test was used for overall and the Fisher exact test for pairwise comparisons of the proportions of patients experiencing recurrent VTE and MB events. Odds ratios were used to compare the relative odds of the occurrence of the outcome given exposure to the risk factor.A total of 144 patients were prescribed anticoagulation, in which 106 fulfilled inclusion criteria apixaban (27.3%), rivaroxaban (34.9%) and enoxaparin (37.7%), and 38 were excluded. Patients median age was 66. years at GICA diagnosis and 67 years at CAVTE event, with 62% males, 80% Caucasian, 70% stage IV, pancreatic cancer (40.%), 30% Khorana Score (≥ 3 points), and 43.% on active chemotherapy. Sixty-four percent of patients completed anticoagulation therapy (range 1 to 43 mo). Recurrent VTE at 6 mo was noted in 7.% ( = 3), 6.8% ( = 2) and 2.7% ( = 1) of patients on enoxaparin, apixaban and rivaroxaban, respectively (all  = NS).

Our study aims to evaluate the impact of the use of the QUiPP app on maternal anxiety levels.A retrospective cohort study on asymptomatic pregnant women attending the Prevention of Preterm Birth Clinic in a busy tertiary unit. Women included in the study had a history of previous PTB. The study assessment occurred at approximately 4 weeks prior to the gestation of the earliest previous PTB and included measurement of cervical length and vaginal fetal fibronectin. Data was inputted into the QUiPP application, which in turn estimated risk of preterm delivery at specific intervals. Measured outcomes were gestation at delivery, time from risk assessment to delivery, infant birth , NICU admission and length of stay. In addition, maternal anxiety levels were retrospectively assessed using a questionnaire with a Likert scale.Seventy six women were included in the study. All women were asymptomatic for preterm labour at assessment. The mean gestation at the time of risk assessment was 27 weeks, the mean time from risk assessment to delivery was 72 days. Average gestation at time of delivery was 37 weeks (range 22-42 weeks). The preterm birth rate was 29% (n = 22).Seventy seven percent of women who delivered <37 weeks, and 80% who delivered <34 weeks were given QUiPP scores predicting a ≥% chance of PTB within four weeks of their actual delivery date. Sixteen percent of infants were admitted to NICU (n = 12) with a mean length of stay of 21 days. All infants went home well with their parents.Eighty four percent of respondents to our questionnaire reported feeling anxious about their pregnancy prior to attending the clinic. After receiving a QUIPP score 90% said they felt reassured and 79% reported that the felt less anxious.In asymptomatic women, the use of the QUiPP app helps to predict, prevent, and optimise PTB. This surveillance has a beneficial role for maternal mental well-being in that it reduces anxiety at a key time during a pregnancy.© 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662982>Chlorogenic Acid Attenuates Kidney Ischemic/Reperfusion Injury via Reducing Inflammation, Tubular Injury, and Myofibroblast Formation.</a></h1><p>Kidney ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) injury is the main cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) involving renal function deterioration, renal architecture damage, and inflammation. This condition may lead to kidney fibrosis with epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and myofibroblast formation. Inhibition of chronic effects of kidney I/R injury may provide effective strategies for treating AKI and chronic kidney diseases (CKDs). Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is recognized as a powerful antioxidant, with anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic properties in many conditions. However, the effect of CGA on kidney I/R injury has not been elucidated yet. Kidney I/R injury was performed on male Swiss background mice (I/R group,  = , 3-4 months, 30-40 g) which underwent bilateral renal pedicles clamping for 30 minutes and then were euthanized on day three after operation. Three groups of I/R were treated with 3 different doses of CGA intraperitoneally for 2 days: 3. (I/R + CGA1 group), 7 (I/R + CGA2 group), and 14 (I/R + CGA3 group) mg/kg of . Tubular injury was quantified based on Periodic Acid-Schiff staining, while reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was performed to quantify mRNA expression of TGF-1, vimentin, SOD-1, TLR-4, TNF-α, NF-κB and MCP-1. Immunohistochemical staining was done to quantify proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), myofibroblast (-SMA), SOD-1 and macrophage (CD68) number. Kidney I/R demonstrated tubular injury and increased inflammatory mediator expression, macrophage number, and myofibroblast expansion. Meanwhile, histological analysis showed lower tubular injury with higher epithelial cell proliferation in CGA-treated groups compared to the I/R group. RT-PCR also revealed significantly lower TGF-1 and vimentin mRNA expressions with higher SOD-1 mRNA expression. CGA-treated groups also demonstrated a significantly lower macrophage and myofibroblast number compared to the I/R group. These findings associated with lower mRNA expression of TLR-4, TNF-α, NF-κB, and MCP-1 as inflammatory mediators in CGA groups. I/R + CGA3 represented the highest amelioration effect among other CGA-treated groups. CGA treatment attenuates kidney I/R injury through reducing inflammation, decreasing myofibroblast expansion, and inducing epithelial cells proliferation.Copyright © 2019 Nur Arfian et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667540>Mouse model of the human serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region.</a></h1><p>Genetic factors play a significant role in risk for mood and anxiety disorders. Polymorphisms in genes that regulate the brain monoamine systems, such as catabolic enzymes and transporters, are attractive candidates for being risk factors for emotional disorders given the  of evidence implicating monoamines involvement in these conditions. Several common genetic variants have been identified in the human serotonin transporter (-HTT) gene, including a repetitive sequence located in the promoter region of the locus called the serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (-HTT-LPR). This polymorphism has been associated with a number of mental traits in both humans and primates, including depression, neuroticism, and harm avoidance. Some, but not all, studies found a link between the polymorphism and -HTT levels, leaving open the question of whether the polymorphism affects risk for mental traits via changes in -HTT expression. To investigate the impact of the polymorphism on gene expression, serotonin homeostasis, and behavioral traits, we set out to develop a mouse model of the human -HTT-LPR. Here we describe the creation and characterization of a set of mouse lines with single-copy human transgenes carrying the short and long -HTT-LPR variants. Although we were not able to detect differences in expression between the short and long variants, we encountered several technical issues concerning the design of our humanized mice that are likely to have influenced our findings.

A population-based sample of 13,263 and 5944 rural Chinese people aged ≥35 years and without hypertension at baseline was included in our analysis of BMI changes (from (2004-2006) to 2008) and short- and long-term outcomes of hypertension (from 2008 to 2010 and 2010 to 2017). The participants were divided into four groups by a comprehensive cross-sectional combination according to baseline BMI (18.-24 vs. ≥24 kg/m) and follow-up changes (decreased vs. increased). Adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). During a median follow-up period of 4.8 (short-term) and 11.7 (long-term) years, 2299 (17.33%) and 2020 (33.98%) participants developed hypertension, respectively. For participants with a baseline BMI ≥ 24 kg/m, when BMI decreased in follow-ups, the multivariable-adjusted HRs (95% CI) of short-term hypertension were 0.898 (0.857-0.942). For baseline 18. kg/m ≤ BMI < 24 kg/m, when BMI increased in follow-ups, the risks of short-term hypertension were 1.103 (1.068-1.139). We detected that BMI changes had a lower impact on the incidence of hypertension in long-term than short-term. Our study indicated that BMI changes were significantly associated with the incidence of hypertension for the short-term, and it had a stronger impact on short-term outcomes than long-term.

First, four types of parameters were calculated, namely, the geometric parameters (7), electronic parameters (), physical and chemical parameters (8), and spectral parameters (7), but the physical and chemical parameters heat of formation (HF) and critical volume (CV) were excluded after the establishment of the 2D-QSAR model. Then, after PCA, it was found that the first principal component represented the main driving factors affecting the molecular genetic toxicity of FQs. In addition, after comprehensive analysis of the factor loading of the first, second, and third principal components, seven parameters affecting the genotoxicity of the FQs were screened out, namely, total energy (TE), critical temperature (CT), and molecular  (Mol Wt) (increased with increasing genotoxicity of the FQs) and steric parameter (MR), quadrupole moment Q (Q), quadrupole moment Q (Q), and boiling point (BP) (decreased with increasing genotoxicity of the FQs); the above key parameters were also verified by sensitivity analysis. The obtained rules could be used to determine the substitution sites and the substitution groups associated with higher genotoxicity in the process of FQ modification, and these rules agreed well with the hologram quantitative structure-activity relationship (HQSAR) model.

It is a symptom of many chronic diseases, including cancer, liver failure, congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease, and there is as yet no effective treatment. While the mechanisms underlying cachexia are complex, it is often accompanied by elevated angiotensin II (Ang II). Human placental extract (HPE) is a source of numerous biologically active molecules and has been used clinically to treat chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and other chronic diseases. Here, we investigated the effects of HPE in an Ang II-induced cachexia model in mice. HPE treatment preserved both fat mass and lean  mass and suppressed  loss in the cachexia model, though food intake was unaffected. Ang II infusion also caused cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. HPE suppressed these effects as well as Ang II-induced cardiac expression of genes related to heart failure and cardiac remodeling. HPE also reversed Ang II-induced downregulation of mitochondria-related molecules and suppressed cardiac inflammation and oxidative stress. HPE administration may thus be an effective approach to the treatment of cachexia, cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657284>Thrombolysis in elderly stroke patients in Italy (TESPI) trial and updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.</a></h1><p>Since its approval, the use of alteplase had been limited to patients aged ≤80 years.TESPI trial had been designed to evaluate whether alteplase treatment within 3 h in patients with acute ischemic stroke aged >80 years resulted in favorable benefit/risk ratio compared with standard care. The meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was updated to put findings in the context of all available evidence.TESPI was a multicenter, open-label with blinded outcome evaluation, randomized, controlled trial. Main clinical endpoints were 90-day favorable functional outcome (mRS score 0-2) and mortality and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. The trial was prematurely terminated for ethical reasons after publication of IST-3 trial which provided evidence of treatment benefit in elderly.Of the planned 600 patients, 191 (88 assigned to alteplase) were enrolled. Overall, 24/83 (28.9%) alteplase patients had a favorable outcome compared to 22/95 (23.2%) controls (non-significant absolute difference of .7% for alteplase; OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.69-2.64,  = 0.381). Rates of death were non-significantly lower in the alteplase patients (18.1% vs. 26.%); rates of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage were similar between the two groups (.9% vs. .1%). The updated meta-analysis showed consistent results with prior estimates and add .The effects of alteplase observed in this interrupted trial did not reach statistical significance, probably for the small numbers, but are consistent with and add  to the sum total of the randomized evidence demonstrating that alteplase is beneficial in patients with acute ischemic stroke aged over 80 years, particularly if given within 3 h.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670177>Maternal sociodemographic and health behaviours associated with adiposity in infants as measured by air displacement plethysmography.</a></h1><p>Identifying modifiable factors associated with  fat in infancy may improve health outcomes.

Reproductive traits were available between 2005 and 2014 for 7857 litters from 1029 Large White and 858 Landrace sows. In 2012 and 2013, Hb levels, sow BW and sow back fat depth were measured on 348 sows with 529 litters  days prior to farrowing. In addition, Hb levels were available for 1127 one-day-old piglets from 383 litters (a maximum of three piglets per litter) of 277 sows with Hb levels. The average Hb levels in sows (sow Hb), their litters (litter Hb, based on average Hb of three piglets) and individual piglets (piglet Hb) were 112 ± 12.6 g/l, 103 ± 15.3 g/l and 105 ± 21.7 g/l, respectively. Heritabilities for Hb levels were 0.09 ± 0.07 for sow Hb, 0.19 ± 0.11 for litter Hb and 0.08 ± 0.05 for piglet Hb. Estimates for the permanent environment effect of sows were 0.09 ± 0.09 for sow Hb, 0.11 ± 0.12 for litter Hb and 0.12 ± 0.03 for piglet Hb. In comparison, heritabilities for both number of stillborn piglets and pre-weaning survival were lower (0.05 ± 0.01 and 0.04 ± 0.01). Sow BW had no significant heritability, while sow back fat depth was lowly heritable (0.10 ± 0.08). Positive genetic correlations were found between sow Hb and litter Hb (0.64 ± 0.47) and between litter Hb and sow back fat depth (0.71 ± 0.53). Higher litter Hb was genetically associated with lower number of stillborn piglets (-0.78 ± 0.35) and higher pre-weaning survival (0.28 ± 0.33). Negative genetic correlations between sow Hb and average piglet birth  of the litter (-0.60 ± 0.34) and between piglet Hb and birth  of individual piglets (-0.37 ± 0.32) indicate that selection for heavier piglets may reduce Hb levels in sows and piglets. Similarly, selection for larger litter size will reduce average piglet birth  (rg: -0.40 ± 0.12) and pre-weaning survival (-0.57 ± 0.13) and may lead to lower litter Hb (-0.48 ± 0.27). This study shows promising first results for the use of Hb levels as a selection criterion in pig breeding programs, and selection for higher Hb levels may improve piglet survival and limit further reduction in Hb levels in sows and piglets due to selection for larger and heavier litters.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667423>High fat diet modulates the protein content of nutrient transporters in the small intestine of mice: possible involvement of PKA and PKC activity.</a></h1><p>Chronic high fat consumption has been shown to modulate nutrient transporter content in the intestine of obese mice; however it is unclear if this regulation occurs before or after the establishment of obesity, and the underlying molecular mechanism requires elucidation.Towards this goal C57BL/6 mice were fed a low fat diet (LFD) or high fat diet (HFD), and specific protein and gene expression levels were assessed for up to 12 weeks. Similar experiments were also performed with leptin-deficient (Ob/Ob) mice.The results showed that the HFD group presented decreased GLUT2, PEPT1, FAT/CD36 and NPC1L1, and increased NHE3, MTTP and L-FABP content. Animals fed an HFD also presented enhanced lipid transporter gene expression of , , ,  and . Additionally, FAT/CD36 and NPC1L1 protein levels were reduced in both HFD-induced obese and Ob/Ob mice. Ob/Ob mice also exhibited increased  and  mRNAs expression, but the protein expression levels remained unchanged. The HFD also attenuated PKA and PKC activities. The inhibition of PKA was associated with decreased FAT/CD36 content, whereas increased L-FABP levels likely depend on CREB activation, independent of PKA. It is plausible that the HFD-induced changes in NPC1L1, MTTP and L-FABP protein content involve regulation at the level of transcription. Moreover, the changes in GLUT2 and PEPT1 content might be associated with low PKC activity.The results indicated that an HFD is capable of reducing nutrient transporter content, possibly attenuating nutrient uptake into the intestine, and may represent a feedback mechanism for regulating . Furthermore, the elevated levels of NHE3, L-FABP and MTTP may account for the increased prevalence of hypertension and dyslipidemia in obese individuals. All of these changes are potentially linked to reduced PKA or PKC activities.© 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667392>Protective effects of hydro-alcoholic extract of  and  on ovarian follicle reserve in the first-generation mouse pups.</a></h1><p>The present study was conducted to investigate the protective effects of fennel and flaxseed during pre- and post-natal period until puberty and menopause on ovarian follicular reserve (OFR).Pregnant NMRI mice received fennel (FV, 500 mg/kg/day), flaxseed (LU, 500 mg/kg/day), LU + FV (500 mg/kg/day) and no treatment was given to the controls. Female pups were studied on post-natal-days 1, 56 and 240 (PND1, 56, 240). Ovary  and diameters, the number of primordial (PF), atretic (AF) and apoptotic (APF) follicles were determined. The expression of Bcl2 and STAT3 (apoptosis-related-genes), micoRNA-125a-5p, and also serum levels of sex hormones were measured. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA test.FV and FV + LU groups showed a marked rise in  and ovary  and diameters as compared to the control group. The number of PF at PND1, PND56, and PND240 increased significantly in the FV and FV + LU groups but decreased in the LU group compared to the control mice. There was a significant reduction in the mean of AF in the FV and FV + LU group and a marked increase in the LU group compared to the controls. Also, more APF were observed in the LU group, whereas less apoptotic follicles were present in the FV group. FSH and estradiol serum levels increased significantly while LH decreased in the FV group. The anti-apoptotic-genes expression and pro-apoptotic microRNA, respectively, increased and decreased in the FV group versus control group.It can be concluded that fennel alone and in combination with flaxseed could improve OFR during pregnancy, lactation, and afterwards until puberty and menopause.© 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666311>Incidence of necrotising enterocolitis before and after introducing routine prophylactic  and  probiotics.</a></h1><p>To compare rates of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), late-onset sepsis, and mortality in -year epochs before and after implementation of routine daily multistrain probiotics administration in high-risk neonates.Single-centre retrospective observational study over the 10-year period from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2017.Level 3 neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, UK.Preterm neonates at high risk of NEC: admitted to NICU within 3 days of birth at <32 weeks' gestation or at 32-36 weeks' gestation and of birth  <1500 g.Prior to 1 January 2013 probiotics were not used. Thereafter, dual-species  and  combination probiotics were routinely administered daily to high-risk neonates; from April 2016 triple-species probiotics (    and   subspecies ) were used.Incidence of NEC (modified Bell's stage 2a or greater), late-onset sepsis, and mortality.Rates of NEC fell from 7.% (35/469 neonates) in the pre-implementation epoch to 3.1% (16/513 neonates) in the routine probiotics epoch (adjusted sub-hazard ratio=0.44, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.85, p=0.014). The more than halving of NEC rates after probiotics introduction was independent of any measured covariates, including breast milk feeding rates. Cases of late-onset sepsis fell from 106/469 (22.6%) to 59/513 (11.%) (p<0.0001), and there was no episode of sepsis due to  or . All-cause mortality also fell in the routine probiotics epoch, from 67/469 (14.3%) to 47/513 (9.2%), although this was not statistically significant after multivariable adjustment (adjusted sub-hazard ratio=0.74, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.12, p=0.155).Administration of multispecies  and  probiotics has been associated with a significantly decreased risk of NEC and late-onset sepsis in our neonatal unit, and no safety issues. Our data are consistent with routine use of  and  combination probiotics having a beneficial effect on NEC prevention in very preterm neonates.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Twenty-eight mature male Liaoning Cashmere goats were divided into four groups based on  (56.2 ± 2.45 kg) and semen characteristics; these goats were fed with basal diet supplemented with 0, 20, 40, or 80 mg Zn/kg DM (zinc sulfate) for 3 months. Results showed that the Zn-supplemented diets linearly increased the semen volume (0.98, 1.04, 1.27, and 1.17 ml for the 0, 20, 40, and 80 mg Zn/kg DM supplementation, respectively) (P < 0.05) and the total sperm output (3.87, 4.52, .73, and .33 × 10/ml for the 0, 20, 40, and 80 mg Zn/kg DM supplementation, respectively) (P < 0.05); by contrast, Zn supplementation exerted no effect on sperm concentration, motility, and abnormal sperms rate. The activities of copper zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD) (linear P < 0.05) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) (linear P < 0.05; quadratic P < 0.01) were highest in the intermediate supplementation (40 mg Zn/kg DM). Moreover, the malondialdehyde (MDA) content of spermatozoa decreased linearly (P < 0.01) with the increase in Zn supplementation. In seminal plasma, the highest GSH-Px activity was observed in 20 mg Zn/kg DM supplementation (P < 0.05). Catalase (CAT) activities both in the spermatozoa and seminal plasma showed no difference in all treatments. Seminal plasma Zn level was highest in 40 mg Zn/kg DM (linear P = 0.068), and K increased linearly (P = 0.001) with increasing Zn level. Furthermore, blood plasma Zn (linear P < 0.01; quadratic P < 0.05), Fe (linear P < 0.05; quadratic P < 0.05), and Mg (linear P < 0.05) increased with increasing Zn supplementation.

This study was aimed to determine whether adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AdMSCs) might restore RI-induced SG dysfunction in a murine model. Forty -five mice were divided into three groups; a PBS sham group, a RI+ PBS sham group (0.01 mCi/g mouse, orally), and an RI+AdMSCs (1 × 10 cells/150 uL, intraglandular injection on experimental day 28) treated group. At 16 weeks after RI treatment,  , SG , salivary flow rates (SFRs), and salivary lag times were measured. Morphologic and histologic examinations and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed and the activities of amylase and EGF in saliva were also measured. Changes in salivary Tc pertechnetate excretion were followed by SPECT and TUNEL assays were performed. The  and SG  were similar in the AdMSCs and sham groups. Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed the AdMSCs group had more mucin-containing acini than the RI group. Furthermore, AdMSCs treatment resulted in tissue remodeling and elevated expressions of epithelial (AQP5) and endothelial (CD31) markers, and increased SFRs. The activities of amylase and EGF were higher in the AdMSCs group than in the RI treated group. Tc pertechnetate excretions were similar in the AdMSCs and sham group. Also, TUNEL positive apoptotic cell numbers were less in the AdMSCs group than in the RI group. Local delivery of AdMSCs might regenerate SG damage induced by RI.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670003>Injected laquinimod D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol-1000 succinate polymeric micelles for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h1><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic relapsing disorders of the gastrointestinal tract characterized pathologically by intestinal inflammation and epithelial injury. Laquinimod (LAQ), a poorly water-soluble compound, was proved to be effective for colitis remission at low dose of 0. mg/kg in patients with Crohn's disease. Due to its extremely low solubility in water, it was difficult to develop an injectable liquid dosage form. Herein, D-α-Tocopheryl polyethylene glycol-1000 succinate (TPGS) polymeric micelles were developed as a delivery vehicle of LAQ for the management of inflammatory bowel disease. Using the LAQ/TPGS ratio of 1:100, LAQ-loaded micelles were successfully prepared by thin-film dispersion method. The solubility of LAQ in water was significantly increased from 10. μg/mL in pure water to 500 μg/mL in TPGS micelles. LAQ-loaded micelles of TPGS exhibited the fine particle size of 34.6 nm and Zeta potential of -0.67 mV. Moreover, the good stability of LAQ-loaded micelles in physiology-mimicking medium was confirmed by detecting their particle size, zeta potential and leakage of the loading drug. Therapeutic effect of LAQ-loaded micelles on DSS-induced mice was proved by detecting DAI score, colon length and loss of . Moreover, the morphology and colonic mucosal barrier of the injured colon of DSS-induced mice was largely recovered after treatment with LAQ-loaded micelles. Meanwhile, the inflammation of colitis colon was also obviously alleviated by LAQ-loaded micelles. Conclusively, polymeric micelles of TPGS may be a promising delivery vehicle of LAQ for the management of inflammatory bowel disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To answer this question, we conducted a broad systematic search of non-surgical and non-pharmacological obesity treatment studies with the following strict criteria: (a) minimum 3-year follow-up, (b) %  mass lost, (c) no continued interventions in the follow-up-period, (d) prospective design, and (e) less than 30% attrition from the start of the follow-up period. While the search revealed a very large number of published articles, only eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Several of the nonincluded studies report a majority of participants achieving satisfactory  loss and little regain, especially among studies with continued interventions during the follow-up period. In contrast, the eight high-quality studies included in this study demonstrate a trend of  regain towards pretreatment baseline. This review concludes that the majority of high-quality follow-up treatment studies of individuals with obesity are not successful in maintaining  loss over time. The results suggest that excess  can be lost but is likely regained over time, for the majority of participants.© 2019 World Obesity Federation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663283>Prediction of Collapse Using Patient-Specific Finite Element Analysis of Osteonecrosis of the Femoral Head.</a></h1><p>To develop a prediction method for femoral head collapse by using patient-specific finite element analysis of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH).The retrospective study recruited 40 patients with ARCO stage-II ONFH (40 pre-collapse hips). Patients were divided into two groups according to the 1-year follow-up outcomes: patient group without femoral head collapse (noncollapse group, n = 20) and patient group with collapse (collapse group, n = 20). CT scans of the hip were performed for all patients once they joined the study. Patient-specific finite element models were generated based on these original CT images following the same procedures: segmenting the necrotic lesion and viable proximal femur, meshing the computational models, assigning different material properties according to the Hounsfield unit distribution, simulating the stress loading of the slow walking gait, and measuring the distribution of the von Mises stress. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the predictive performance of the maximum level of the von Mises stress. The optimal cut-off value was selected based on the Youden index and the corresponding predictive accuracy was reported as well.The mean level of the maximum von Mises stress in the collapse group was 2.955 ± 0.539 MPa, whereas the mean stress level in the noncollapse group was 1.923 ± 0.793 MPa (P < 0.01). ROC analysis of the maximum von Mises stress found that the area under the ROC curve was 0.842 (95% CI: 0.717-0.968, P < 0.01). The maximum Youden index was 0.60, which corresponded to two optimal cut-off values: 2.7801 MPa (sensitivity: 0.70; specificity: 0.90; predictive accuracy: 80.00%; LR+: 7), and 2.7027 MPa (sensitivity: 0.75; specificity: 0.85; predictive accuracy: 77.50%; LR+: ).Finite element analysis is a potential method for femoral head collapse prediction among pre-collapse ONFH patients. The maximum level of the von Mises stress on the -bearing surface of the femoral head could be a good biomechanical marker to classify the collapse risk. The collapse prediction method based on patient-specific finite element analysis is, thus, suitable to apply to clinical practice, but further testing on a larger dataset is desirable.© 2019 The Authors.

Parasite infections and diseases are some of the causes that directly affected the survival and breeding rates of animal population. A study on the endoparasites of 70 hares (37 hunted free-living hares, and 33 bred on farms hares) was performed between 2015 - 2017 in the province of Grosseto (central Italy), an area where the impact of parasites in the hare population has never been investigated. During necroscopic analysis of hunted hares the following helminthes were found:  (87.1 %),  (12.9 %) and  spp. (6.4 %) in the intestinal tract,  (8.3 %) in lungs and  (16.7 %) in livers. The prevalences of the intestinal helminthes in bred hares were: 12.1 % for  and 3 % for . The coprological analysis showed prevalences of 64.9 % for coccidia in the 37 hunted hares and 45. % in the 33 bred hares. The relationship between the intensities of parasitic infections and  was evaluated. The results of the present study in the Grosseto area indicate that free-living hares have few species of parasites and that the intensities of parasitic infection did not affect their general condition and health, suggesting that endoparasites played no detectable role in the dynamics of this hare population.© 2018 V.

Neonates receiving continuous infusion of dobutamine -20 μg kg min were included. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and cardiac output of right and left ventricle (RVO, LVO) were measured on echocardiography; heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), peripheral arterial oxygen saturation and cerebral regional oxygen saturation were recorded from patient monitors.28 neonates with median (range) gestational age of 30.4 (22.7 - 41.0) weeks and birth  (BW) of 1618 (465 - 4380) g were included. PK data was adequately described by one-compartmental linear structural model. Dobutamine clearance (CL) was described by allometric scaling on BW with sigmoidal maturation function of postmenstrual age (PMA). The final population PK model parameter mean typical value (standard error) estimates, standardised to median BW of 1618 g, were 41.2 (44.) l h for CL and .29 (0.821) l for volume of distribution, which shared a common between subject variability of 29(17.2) %. The relationship between dobutamine concentration and RVO/LVEF was described by linear model, between concentration and LVO/HR/MAP/cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction by sigmoidal E model.In postnatal transitional period PK of dobutamine was described by one-compartmental linear model, CL related to BW and PMA.

It is a severe challenge for surgeons to preserve residual ischemic bowel segment in the management of short bowel syndrome,especially in neonates.We report a newborn baby with gut malrotation associated with jejuno-ileal atresia, congenital SBS and jejunal volvulus. Hematemesis and abdominal distention were noted. At laparotomy, malrotation associated with jejuno-ileal atresia, congenital SBS and jenunal volvulus was confirmed. The total length of the small bowel was 63 cm with proximal jejunal bowel segment measuring 38 cm, including 18 cm necrotic segment below the Treitz's ligament and 20 cm severe ischemic segment. The distal part of the small bowel was 25 cm in length and only about 0.8 cm in diameter. Ladd's procedure, necrotic segment resection and end-to-back duodeno-ileal anastomosis were performed. The residual severe ischemic jejunum was preserved with single proximal stoma and distal end closure. Three months later, to restore the continuity of the isolated gut segment, end-to-end duodeno-jejunal and jejuno-ileal anastomosis was performed. The entire functional small bowel length increased to 80 cm. Intravenous fluid therapy and parenteral nutrition were discontinued on the 10 day postoperatively. Twelve months later, her  was 9. kg.Isolation of severe ischemic bowel segment and staged anastomosis to restore the gut continuity for infants with SBS are safe and feasible.©The Author(s) 2019.

In the production of P(3HB), urea and glucose feeding streams were developed to characterize the fed-batch culture conditions for new Cupriavidus necator NSDG-GG mutant. Feeding urea in repeated fed-batch stage (RFB-I) at 6, and 12 h in cultivation led to insignificant kinetic effect on the cell dry mass (CDM) and P(3HB) accumulation. Feeding glucose in repeated fed-batch stage (RFB-II) demonstrated that the incremental feeding approach of glucose after urea in fill-and-draw (F/D) mode at 24, 30, 36, 42, and 48 h in fermentation increased CDM and P(3HB) concentration. In the 1 cycle in RFB-II, the cumulative CDM reached the value of 26.22 g/L and then it increased with the successive repeated fed-batches to attain biomass of 145 g/L at the end of  cycle of RFB-II. The final cumulative P(3HB) concentration at the end of  cycle of RFB-II reached 111 g/L with the overall yield of 0.50 g P(3HB) g gluc; the CDM productivity from the RFB-II cycles was in the range of 0.84-1.3 g/(L·h). The RFB-II of glucose in an increment mode produced nearly 2.2 times more increase in CDM and P(3HB) productivities compared to the decrement RFB-II mode. Repeated cultivation had also the advantage of avoiding extra time required for innoculum preparation, and sterilization of bioreactor during batch, thereby it increased the overall industrial importance of the process.Copyright © 2019.

To present contemporary height-, - and  mass index (BMI)-for-age references reflecting children's growth in modern Switzerland. Cross-sectional sample comprising 30,141 boys and girls aged 0-20 years measured between 2012 and 2019. Height,  and BMI reference curves were created using the LMS method. Derived percentiles were compared with those of Prader, WHO and neighbouring countries. Growth in the first  years is almost identical with Prader curves. Thereafter children are taller, yet their final height is only about 1 cm higher. Today's children, in particular boys, are considerably heavier. In comparison with WHO growth references, Swiss children are taller from the second year until adulthood; the WHO 3rd percentiles lie about 4 cm below those of our updated references.  and BMI median percentiles from our sample are similar to those of WHO and higher than the Prader curves. However, the course of the 97th BMI percentile WHO curves extends well below the 97th percentile of the updated Swiss curves.

We evaluated the relation of self-reported severe  loss with fatigue and the predictors for fatigue in old patients at hospital discharge. Severe  loss was defined according to involuntary  loss ≥% in the last three months. We determined fatigue with the validated  questionnaire. The regression analyses were adjusted for age, sex, number of comorbidities, medications/day, and BMI. Of 424 patients aged between 61 and 98 y, 34.1% had severe  loss. Fatigue was higher in patients with severe  loss (3.7 ± 2.3 vs. 3.2 ± 2.3 points,  = 0.021). In a multinomial regression model,  loss was independently associated with higher risk for moderate fatigue (OR:1.172, CI:1.026-1.338,  = 0.019) and with increased risk for severe fatigue (OR:1.209, CI:1.047-1.395,  = 0.010) together with the number of medications/day (OR:1.220, CI:1.023-1.455,  = 0.027). In a binary regression model, severe  loss predicted moderate-to-severe fatigue in the study population (OR:1.651, CI:1.052-2.590,  = 0.029). In summary, patients with self-reported severe  loss at hospital discharge exhibited higher fatigue levels and severe  loss was an independent predictor of moderate and severe fatigue, placing these patients at risk for impaired outcome in the post-hospital period.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668945> contouring in adolescents after bariatric surgery.</a></h1><p>Bariatric surgery leads to sustained  loss and resolution of obesity-associated co-morbidities in severely obese adolescents. However, one consequence of massive  loss is excess skin and soft tissue. Many details regarding the timing, outcomes, and barriers associated with  contouring surgery (BCS) in youth who have undergone bariatric surgery are unknown.Describe the incidence and effect of BCS following bariatric surgery among adolescents.University Hospitals METHODS: Teen-Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery is a prospective multi-institutional study of 242 adolescents who underwent bariatric surgery from 2007 to 2012. Utilization of BCS was analyzed in this population with comparison of anthropometrics and excess skin-related symptoms between those who did and those who did not undergo BCS.Among the 198 study participants with BCS data available, 25 (12.6%) underwent 41  contouring procedures after bariatric surgery. The most common BCS was panniculectomy (n = 23). Presence of pannus-related symptoms at baseline and the magnitude of  loss within the first year after bariatric surgery were independently associated with subsequent panniculectomy (P = .04 and P = .03, respectively). All adolescents who underwent panniculectomy experienced resolution of pannus-related symptoms. At  years after bariatric surgery, 74% of those who did not undergo panniculectomy reported an interest in the procedure, and 58% indicated that cost/insurance coverage was the barrier to obtaining BCS.Few adolescents who underwent bariatric surgery later underwent BCS procedures. Panniculectomy effectively treated pannus-related symptoms. Disparities in access to surgical care for adolescents who desire BCS warrants further investigation.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Bariatric Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Iron fortificants adversely affect the infant gut microbiota, while co-provision of prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) mitigates most of the adverse effects. Whether variations in maternal HMO profile can influence the infant response to iron and/or GOS fortificants is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine HMO profiles and the secretor/non-secretor phenotype of lactating Kenyan mothers and investigate their effects on the maternal and infant gut microbiota, and on the infant response to a fortification intervention with  mg iron (2. mg as sodium iron ethylenediaminetetraacetate and 2. mg as ferrous fumarate) and 7. g GOS. We studied mother-infant pairs ( = 80) participating in a 4-month intervention trial in which the infants (aged 6.-9. months) received daily a micronutrient powder without iron, with iron or with iron and GOS. We assessed: (1) maternal secretor status and HMO composition; (2) effects of secretor status on the maternal and infant gut microbiota in a cross-sectional analysis at baseline of the intervention trial; and (3) interactions between secretor status and intervention groups during the intervention trial on the infant gut microbiota, gut inflammation, iron status, growth and infectious morbidity. Secretor prevalence was 72% and HMOs differed between secretors and non-secretors and over time of lactation. Secretor status did not predict the baseline composition of the maternal and infant gut microbiota. There was a secretor-status-by-intervention-group interaction on  ( = 0.021), Z-scores for length-for-age ( = 0.022) and -for-age ( = 0.018), and soluble transferrin receptor ( = 0.041). In the no iron group, longitudinal prevalence of diarrhea was higher among infants of non-secretors (23.8%) than of secretors (10.4%) ( = 0.001). In conclusion, HMO profile may modulate the infant gut microbiota response to fortificant iron; compared to infants of secretor mothers, infants of non-secretor mothers may be more vulnerable to the adverse effect of iron but also benefit more from the co-provision of GOS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671025>Social work and toddler overweight risk: Identifying modifiable child and parent factors across the socioeconomic gradient.</a></h1><p>: Childhood obesity is associated with long-term health consequences, yet little is known about the prevalence of child and parent risk factors of overweight across the socioeconomic gradient in early life. This exploratory study documents the prevalence of risk factors that contribute to overweight among toddlers within and across socioeconomic status (SES). : Obesity risk factors were examined within and across SES quintiles in a nationally representative sample. Data were collected from ,100 mothers and 2-year-old children. Weighted regression models assessed child and parent characteristics that predict toddler  status in a national sample and samples stratified by SES quintiles. : Higher rates of overweight were observed in Q1 (29.2%) and reduced with each successive SES quintile (16.9%-Q5), suggesting a gradient effect. Results indicated factors unique within quintiles, distinct from the full national sample: Q1-motor development; Q2-motor and mental development, maternal BMI, breastfeeding, bottle feeding, introduction of solid foods; Q3-breastfeeding; and Q4--introduction of solid foods. : Findings further existing knowledge of toddler obesity by uncovering risks relevant for specific SES groups.

This study investigates the effects of consumption of yoghurt enriched with vitamins B, in comparison with conventional yoghurt, on  management and glycemic control of patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Thirty-three overweight/obese patients (BMI 27-36 kg m-2) were randomized into two groups receiving two servings of non-fat yoghurt per day, either strawberry-flavored enriched with vitamins B1, B5 and B6 (VY) or conventional (CY) for 12 weeks. At the beginning and the end of the dietary intervention, anthropometric characteristics, biochemical parameters, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1b (IL-1b), vitamins B and homocysteine concentrations were determined. Dietary assessments were also performed. At the end of the intervention,  and BMI were reduced in the VY group (86. ± 3.1 vs. 87.7 ± 3.0 kg, and 29.2 ± 1.0 vs. 29.6 ± 0.9 kg m-2, respectively, P < 0.05) and dietary intake was lower compared to the CY group (7277.6 ± 332.6 vs. 9918.2 ± 612.1 kJ day-1, P < 0.05). HbA1c was marginally reduced in the VY group (6.2 ± 0.2 vs. 6.4 ± 0.3%, P = 0.08), concentrations of B1, B2 and B6 were increased (63.8 ± .6 vs. 52.8 ± 1.7 μg L-1, P = 0.09, 9.2 ± 1. vs. 6.9 ± 1.4 μg L-1, P < 0.05 and 23.0 ± 2.8 vs. 14.9 ± 1.2 μg L-1, P < 0.05, respectively) and a trend towards reduced homocysteine concentrations was observed (16.9 ± 1.7 vs. 18.3 ± 2.0 μmol L-1, P = 0.06). IL-6 was decreased in both groups but significantly in the CY group (1.33 ± 0.13 vs. 1.67 ± 0.63 pg mL-1, P < 0.05).

This class of drugs is used for the treatment of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. Fenofibrate is one of the members of this class of synthetic PPARα receptor ligands. The oral administration of 0.3% fenofibrate caused a decrease in strength due to loss of  in laboratory animals when improving behavioural features. Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of liver cells showed a genotoxic effect of fenofibrate, due to accumulation of reactive oxygen species, which could be attributed to activation of peroxisomal β-oxidation processes, as well as to the lack of increase in the expression of genes encoding antioxidant defense proteins. Treatment with fenofibrate did not cause brain mtDNA damage. It has been shown that fenofibrate induced mitochondrial β-oxidation in the brain, as indicated by the increased expression of the Acadm and Cpt1a and Ppargc1a and Ppara. The study found no effect of fenofibrate on the increase of mitochondrial biogenesis in brain and liver cells. Thus, we can conclude that fenofibrate significantly affects lipid metabolism in the liver and brain, but in the liver it is associated with an increase of oxidative stress, resulting in mtDNA oxidative damage. However, fenofibrate-induced increase in the expression of Ppargc1a is not associated with an increase of mitochondrial biogenesis. This is consistent with the recent suggestion that PGC-1α might not be a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658931>Effect of overlaying rubber on fully slatted concrete floors on hoof health and lying postures in finishing dairy-origin bulls offered two contrasting diets.</a></h1><p>Fully slatted concrete floors are labour-efficient, cost-effective and thus common in beef cattle housing. However, the welfare of cattle accommodated on them has been questioned. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of floor and diet on hoof health and lying behaviours of housed dairy-origin bulls, from a mean age of 8 months to slaughter at 15. months old. Forty-eight bulls, which had a mean initial live  of 212 (SD = 23.7) kg, were allocated to one of four treatments, which consisted of two floors and two diets arranged in a 2 × 2 factorial design. The floors evaluated were a fully slatted concrete floor and a fully slatted concrete floor overlaid with rubber, while the diets offered were either a high concentrate diet or a grass-silage-based diet supplemented with concentrates. The mean total duration of the study was 216 days. Floor had no significant effect on claw measurements measured on day 62 or 139. However, bulls accommodated on slats overlaid with rubber had a tendency to have a higher front toe length measured pre-slaughter than those accommodated on concrete slats (P = 0.063). Floor had no significant effect on the net growth of toes or heels during the duration of the study. The number of bruises (P < 0.01) and the bruising score (P < 0.05) were significantly higher on day 62 in bulls accommodated on fully slatted concrete floors than on concrete slats overlaid with rubber, but there was no significant effect of floor on these parameters on day 139 or at the measurement taken pre-slaughter. There was a tendency for bulls accommodated on concrete slats to have a higher probability of having sole bruising at the end of the experiment than those accommodated on slats overlaid with rubber (P = 0.052). Diet had no significant effect on toe length or heel height, number of bruises, or overall bruising score at any time point of the study. There was little evidence in the current study to suggest that bulls lying on fully slatted concrete floors could not express lying postures similar to those on concrete slats overlaid with rubber.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667519>Short-term dietary reduction of branched-chain amino acids reduces meal-induced insulin secretion and modifies microbiome composition in type 2 diabetes: a randomized controlled crossover trial.</a></h1><p>Epidemiological studies have shown that increased circulating branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D). This may result from altered energy metabolism or dietary habits.We hypothesized that a lower intake of BCAAs improves tissue-specific insulin sensitivity.This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, crossover trial examined well-controlled T2D patients receiving isocaloric diets (protein: 1 g/kg ) for 4 wk. Protein requirements were covered by commercially available food supplemented ≤60% by an AA mixture either containing all AAs or lacking BCAAs. The dietary intervention ensured sufficient BCAA supply above the recommended minimum daily intake. The patients underwent the mixed meal tolerance test (MMT), hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps (HECs), and skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue biopsies to assess insulin signaling.After the BCAA- diet, BCAAs were reduced by 17% during fasting (P < 0.001), by 13% during HEC (P < 0.01), and by 62% during the MMT (P < 0.001). Under clamp conditions, whole- and hepatic insulin sensitivity did not differ between diets. After the BCAA- diet, however, the oral glucose sensitivity index was 24% (P < 0.01) and circulating fibroblast-growth factor 21 was 21% higher (P < 0.05), whereas meal-derived insulin secretion was 28% lower (P < 0.05). Adipose tissue expression of the mechanistic target of rapamycin was 13% lower, whereas the mitochondrial respiratory control ratio was 1.7-fold higher (both P < 0.05). The fecal microbiome was enriched in Bacteroidetes but depleted of Firmicutes.Short-term dietary reduction of BCAAs decreases postprandial insulin secretion and improves white adipose tissue metabolism and gut microbiome composition.

Generally, it is a chronic and progressive disease, however in many cases it can be prevented or treated. Nevertheless, effective control of this disease requires awareness of symptoms in the society.The aim of the study was to assess the level of HF knowledge in the Polish population.The questionnaire concerning knowledge about HF prepared by the Competence Network HF under the patronage of the European Heart Failure Association of the ESC, was used. The survey included 534 contributors who formed three groups: medical students - in vast majority at first half of the study course (MS) - 198 (37.1%), HF Awareness Day participants (HFDP) - 134 (25.1%) and other (OP) - 202 (37.8%).Study groups differed in terms of gender, age and level of education. As predicted, MS achieved the highest score (22. [20.0-24.0]), compared to HFDP (20.0 [17.0-22.0], P <0.001) and OP (19.0[16.0-21.0], P <0.001). Knowledge on typical HF symptoms was alarmingly low in the analyzed groups - dyspnea (MS - 96.0%, HFDP - 78.4%, OP - 74.6%), ankle edema (MS - 79.8%, HFDP - 50.6%, OP - 32.2%),  gain (MS - 14.1%, HFDP - 17.2%, OP - 4.%). By multivariate model medical education (β 3.372, 95% CI 2.738-4.005) and own illness or having relatives or friends with HF (β 0.654, 95% CI 0.066-1.242) independently affected the score of awareness questionnaire.The basic knowledge on HF in Poland is not sufficient.

Among 976 identified publications, 20 randomized clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. The initial search was extended to include five studies published between July 2016 and September 2018.Maternal and infant 25(OH)D concentrations, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, cesarean section, maternal parathyroid hormone and calcium concentrations, and infant gestational age, birth , and birth length.Mean differences, odds ratios, and 95% CIs were calculated, only for the initial search, using separate random-effects meta-analyses for each outcome.Evidence was good or strong that maternal vitamin D supplementation significantly increased maternal (13 studies, n=18, mean difference, 14.1 ng/mL [35.2 nmol/L]; 95% CI=9.6-18.6 ng/mL [24.0-46.4 nmol/L]) and infant (nine studies, n=12; 9.7, .2, 14.2 ng/mL [24.2, 12.9, 35. nmol/L]) 25(OH)D concentrations, although heterogeneity was significant (I=95.9% and I=97.4, respectively, P<0.001). Evidence was fair that vitamin D supplementation significantly decreases maternal homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (five studies, n=7; -1.1, -1., -0.7) and increases infant birth  (nine studies, n=11, 114.2, 63.4, 165.1 g), both had insignificant heterogeneity. A null effect of maternal supplementation on other maternal (preeclampsia, cesarean section) and infant (gestational age, birth length) outcomes was found.Results show vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy improves maternal and infant 25(OH)D concentrations and may play a role in maternal insulin resistance and fetal growth. To further inform practice and policies on the amount of vitamin D, which supports a healthy pregnancy, high quality dose-response randomized clinical trials, which assess pregnancy-specific 25(OH)D thresholds, and appropriately powered clinical outcomes are needed.Copyright © 2019 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

Patients in this cohort achieved a mean %TWL of 6.2% (standard deviation, .52%) and mean TWL of 6.8 kg within 30 days postoperatively (n = 147; 24-30 d).Our data show patients met approximately 50% of their target  loss 30 days after IGB placement. Nausea, vomiting, and poor nutrition status were the most common complications within 30 days of the procedure. Long-term follow-up is necessary to determine if these patients are able to sustain their  loss and for how long.Copyright © 2019.

Study investigators and outcomes assessors were blinded to participant groups. Data were collected and analyzed from May 23, 2016, through November 13, 2017, based on intention to treat.All participants were advised to weigh themselves daily, with a goal of 6 or more days per week, and received text messaging feedback on their performance. Incentive group participants were eligible for a lottery-based incentive worth an expected value of $3.98 in week 1 that escalated by $0.43 each week they achieved their self-weighing goal during months 1 to 6 (phase 1), followed by no incentives during months 7 to 12 (phase 2).The primary outcome was  change at the end of phase 1. Secondary outcomes included  change at the end of phase 2 and changes in self-reported physical activity and eating behaviors.A total of 258 participants (128 in the incentive group and 130 in the control group) had a mean (SD) age of 48.0 (10.) years and mean (SD)  mass index of 32.1 (3.9); 225 (87.2%) were women; 235 (91.1%) were white; and 102 (39.%) had an annual income of at least $100 000.  measurement was transmitted by 250 participants (96.9%) at 6 months and 227 (88.0%) at 12 months. The percentage of weeks that incentive and control participants achieved a mean self-weighing of at least 6 times was 85.3% vs 75.8%, respectively (P = .002) in phase 1 and 37.7% vs 50.2%, respectively (P = .009) in phase 2. Mean  changes at the end of phase 1 were -1.1 (95% CI, -2.1 to -0.1) kg in the incentive group and -1.9 (95% CI, -2.9 to -0.8) kg in the control group, with a mean difference of 0.7 (95% CI, -0.7 to 2.2) kg (P = .30 for comparison). At the end of phase 2, mean  changes were 0.2 (95% CI, -1.2 to 1.7) kg in the incentive group and -0.6 (95% CI, -2.0 to 0.8) kg in the control group, with a mean difference of 0.8 (95% CI, -1.2 to 2.8) kg (P = .41 for comparison).Compared with an active control condition of weekly messages, escalating lottery-based incentives transiently increased rates of self-weighing but did not significantly enhance  loss maintenance.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663146>Antihypertensive and antioxidant activities of enzymatic wheat bran protein hydrolysates.</a></h1><p>Bioactive peptides from plant protein sources have been continuously identified as nutrient supplements for low toxicity but multiple physiological activities such as antihypertensive, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory. In this study, wheat bran protein isolate was digested with alcalase to produce wheat bran protein hydrolysate (WPH) that was then separated into different peptide fractions (<1, 1-3, 3-, and -10 kDa) by membrane ultrafiltration. WPH and the peptide fractions were evaluated for in vitro activities such as antioxidant, renin inhibition, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. In addition, the blood pressure-lowering effects of WPH and the <1 kDa peptides were determined by oral administration to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Results showed that the ACE and renin inhibitions were significantly (p < .05) higher for the <1 kDa fraction (84.25% ± 2.45%, 75.19% ± 1.75%, respectively) when compared to the WPH and >1 kDa fractions. The <1 kDa fraction also showed significantly (p < .05) higher oxygen radical antioxidant activity with 2044.73 ± 37.45 (μM TE/g protein) when compared to lower values obtained for the >1 kDa membrane fractions and WPH. Oral administration (100 mg/kg ) of the <1 kDa membrane fraction to SHRs resulted in a better decrease (-35 mmHg) in the systolic blood pressure when compared to the WPH (-20 mmHg) after 6 hr. And seven peptides (NL, QL, FL, HAL, AAVL, AKTVF, and TPLTR) were identified and amino acid sequence was determined by tandem mass spectrometry. We conclude that the WPH could be considered as a suitable natural antihypertensive and antioxidant resource. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The results of the present study indicate that WPH and its ultrafiltration fractions possess potential as a source of antihypertensive and strong antioxidant peptides. It has been proved that wheat bran has a good blood pressure lowering and antioxidation and other biological activities, and the <1 kDa fraction showing high oxygen radical absorbance capacity level also has better in vitro ACE inhibition and renin-inhibitory activity. The higher antihypertensive efficiency of the <1 kDa fraction may be because the peptides can be better absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract or an increased ability to interact with the enzyme (ACE or renin) protein structure to change the active conformation and lead to decreased catalysis. The results of this study indicate that WPH, especially <1 kDa peptide, can be used as a component in formulating antihypertensive functional foods and nutraceuticals, thus improving the industrial production efficiency and bioavailability of wheat bran.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661553>Population pharmacokinetics of vancomycin in obesity: finding the optimal dose for (morbidly) obese individuals.</a></h1><p>For vancomycin treatment in obese patients, there is no consensus on the optimal dose that will lead to the pharmacodynamic target (AUC 400-700 mg*h L ). This prospective study quantifies vancomycin pharmacokinetics in morbidly obese and non-obese individuals, in order to guide vancomycin dosing in the obese.Morbidly obese individuals (n=20) undergoing bariatric surgery and non-obese healthy volunteers (n=8) (total  (TBW) 60.0-234.6 kg) received a single vancomycin dose (obese: 12. mg kg , maximum 2500 mg; non-obese: 1000 mg) with plasma concentrations measured over 48 hours (11-13 samples per individual). Modelling, internal validation, external validation using previously published data and simulations (n=9950 individuals, TBW 60-230 kg) were performed using NONMEM.In a three-compartment model, peripheral volume and clearance increased with TBW (both p<0.001), which was confirmed in the external validation. A dose of 35 mg kg per day (maximum 5500 mg/day) resulted in a >90% target attainment (AUC>400 mg*h L ) in individuals up to 200 kg, with corresponding trough concentrations of .7-14.6 mg L (twice daily dosing). For continuous infusion, a loading dose of 1500 mg is required for steady state on day 1.In this prospective, rich sampling pharmacokinetic study, vancomycin clearance was well predicted using TBW. We recommend that in obese individuals without renal impairment, vancomycin should be dosed as 35 mg kg per day (maximized at 5500 mg/day). When given over two daily doses, trough concentrations between .7-14.6 mg L correspond to the target exposure in obese individuals.This article is protected by copyright.

Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a non-invasive imaging modality that can be used to detect potential abnormalities in the microvasculature in this population. The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of a newly developed handheld swept source OCT (SS-OCT) device to successfully acquire structural vitreoretinal and retinal microvascular images in awake premature infants.OCT and OCTA images were acquired at the time of routine ROP examinations from awake, unsedated preterm infants in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit using a clinical research prototype handheld probe integrated with an SS-OCT system working at 1,060 nm wavelength and an imaging speed of 200,000 A-scans per second (200 kHz), enabling volume OCT and OCTA scans. Each volume was acquired with approximately 36˚ field of view (~6.3×6.3 mm in infants) in 4.8 s. Quality of acquired OCT and OCTA volume images, microvascular information, and vitreoretinal features were determined by 3-masked grader consensus.Twelve infants ( females, mean gestational age 28.3 weeks, median birth  901 g, stages 0 to 3 ROP) underwent a total of 73 individual eye imaging sessions. High-quality OCT images of the fovea and the optic nerve were present in 69/73 (94.%) and 56/73 (76.7%) scans, respectively. Vitreous bands were observed in 10/73 (13.7%); punctate hyperreflective vitreous opacities in 47/73 (64.4%); epiretinal membrane (ERM) in 6/73 (8.2%); and cystoid macular edema (CME) in 12/73 (16.4%) scans. Mild vessel elevation was noted in 3/73 (4.1%) images, and severe vessel elevation in 4/73 (.%) scans. OCTA images obtained in 8 awake infants revealed good quality images of the foveal microvasculature in 11/19 (58%) eye imaging sessions for 6/8 (75%) infants; and peripapillary microvasculature in 14/19 (74%) eye imaging sessions for /8 (63%) infants.The SS-OCTA handheld device can capture important vitreoretinal characteristics such as peripapillary and foveal microvasculature, as well as hyperreflective punctate vitreous opacities and tractional vitreous bands, which may predict ROP severity. These images were captured in awake, premature infants without the use of direct ocular contact, an eyelid speculum, or sedation.2019 Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery.

Clinical studies have isolated fat within bone and muscle using MRI. In this cross-sectional study, we hypothesized that bone marrow adiposity and muscle adiposity are related, and that this relationship is associated with osteoporosis. Postmenopausal women 60-85 years of age were recruited as part of the Appendicular Muscle and Bone Extension Research Study (AMBERS). Participants completed DXA of the hip and spine to diagnose osteoporosis. Muscle adiposity was measured with MRI at the 66% site of the leg. Fat segmentation was achieved using a semi-automated iterative threshold-optimizing algorithm (error<%). Peripheral quantitative computed tomography measured marrow density of the 4% distal tibia (surrogate for marrow fat) by threshold-based, edge-detection segmentations and by examining residuals from trabecular bone density regressed on trabecular tissue mineral density. Muscle adiposity from MRI was regressed on marrow density using linear regression. Models were further examined with an interaction with osteoporosis status. Among 312 women (age: 75.4±.9yrs, BMI: 29.±.7kg/m ), a larger amount of muscle fat was associated with lower marrow density at the 66% mid-tibia (B: 84.08(27.56), p=0.002) and at the 4% distal tibia (B: 129.17(55.96), p=0.022) after accounting for age, height, , average daily energy expenditure, hypertension and diabetes. Interactions of this relationship with osteoporosis status were also significant. Upon probing these interactions, the relationships were significant only in women with osteoporosis, but not in those without osteoporosis. Fat from bone marrow and muscle may be related to one another through the same phenomenon, which is likely also responsible for osteoporosis, but independent of hypertension and diabetes. More research should focus on the potential abnormalities in muscle and bone fat metabolism and mesenchymal cell commitment to fat within patients with osteoporosis.

Recent study have been showed that glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 and GLP-2 has protective in chemotherapy-induced AM. While the DPP-4 enzyme degrades this GLP-1, the DPP-4 inhibitor blocks the degradation process and raises the concentration of GLP-1. This study aimed to assess the role of DPP-4 inhibitor, a well-known hypoglycemic agent, on chemotherapy-induced AM.Twenty-four 6-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were divided into 4 groups: control, -fluorouracil (-FU), DPP-4 inhibitor, and saline (DPP-4i), and DPP-4 inhibitor and -FU (DPP-4i + -FU). Mucositis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of -FU (400 mg/kg). DPP-4 inhibitor (50 mg/kg) was administered orally for four days starting the day before -FU administration. Post 72 h of -FU injection, mice were sacrificed and  change, diarrhea score, villus height, villus/crypt ratio, histologic characteristics including goblet cell count, and mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6, were assessed.Daily  change was not statistically significant between the -FU and the DPP-4i + -FU group (P = 0.571). Diarrhea score was significantly different between these two groups (P = 0.033). In the -FU group, the villus height was not maintained well, the epithelial lining was irregular, and inflammatory cell infiltration was observed. Goblet cell count in the DPP-4i + -FU group was significantly higher than in the -FU group (P = 0.007). However, in the DPP-4i + -FU group, the villus height, epithelial lining, and crypt structure were better maintained than in the -FU group. Compared with the control group, mRNA expression of TNF-α was significantly up-regulated in the -FU group. Moreover, mRNA expression of TNF-α in the DPP-4i + -FU group was down-regulated compared to the -FU group. However, IL-6 in the -FU group was significantly down-regulated compared to the control, there was no significant difference in expression of IL-6 between the -FU and DPP4i + -FU group.DPP-4 inhibitor can improve -FU induced AM and, therefore, has potential as an alternative treatment for chemotherapy-induced AM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672670>Metabolic Syndrome: A Major Risk Factor for Morbidity & Mortality in Severely Injured Trauma Patients.</a></h1><p>Metabolic syndrome (MetS) increases cardiovascular risk and is associated with poor patient outcomes. We hypothesized that MetS confers an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in severely injured trauma patients.We performed a retrospective review of trauma patients from 2014 through 2018, excluding patients <16 years of age, ISS <16, and with incomplete height and/or  documentation. MetS was defined as the presence of diabetes, hypertension, and a BMI ≥30 kg/m. Outcomes included length of stay (LOS), complications, discharge location, and mortality.There were 4,491 patients meeting criteria of which 100 (2.2%) had MetS. Patients with MetS were older (64.0 vs 38.6 years, p<.0001) but similar in ISS (22 vs 22, p=.70). Hospital LOS was significantly longer with MetS (16. vs 11 days, p <.0001) as was ICU LOS (9 vs  days, p=.0002). MetS correlated with higher rates of AKI (19% vs 3.6%,p<.0001), ARDS (11.0% vs 4.6%, p=.01), cardiac arrest (10.0% vs 4.0%, p=.01), MI (2.0% vs 0.3%, p=.05), severe sepsis (8.0% vs 3.3%, p=.03), unplanned intubation (11.0% vs .0%, p=.02), unplanned ICU admission (13.0% vs 6.1%, p=.02), and non-home discharge (51.0% vs 30.2%, p=.0007). After controlling for age, GCS, ISS, gender, and mechanism, MetS remained an independent predictor of mortality (OR 2., 95% CI 1.33-4.7, p=.004).MetS occurs infrequently in our severely injured trauma population but is strongly associated with increasing LOS as well as cardiac, pulmonary, infectious, and renal complications. MetS also significantly and independently predicts death and should be identified early to facilitate prompt multidisciplinary treatment.Copyright © 2019.

Fifteen chronic stroke participants completed visual feedback only and combined pelvic corrective force and visual feedback conditions during treadmill walking. Each condition included: 1-minute baseline, 7-minute training with visual feedback only or additional pelvic corrective force, 1-minute post training, 1-minute standing break, and another -minute training. EMGs from the paretic leg muscles and step length were measured. Overground walking was evaluated before treadmill walking, immediately and 10 minutes after treadmill walking. Greater increases in integrated EMG of all muscles, except vastus medialis and tibialis anterior, were observed with the application of additional pelvic corrective force compared to visual feedback only during treadmill walking. Overground walking speed significantly increased after treadmill training with combined pelvic correction force and visual feedback, but was not significant for the visual feedback only condition. Voluntary  shifting with additional pelvic corrective force enhanced paretic leg muscle activities and improved gait characteristics during walking.

To address the high cost of current piezoelectric sensors in installation and maintenance, a study on developing a low-cost piezoceramic sensing system is presented in this paper. The proposed system features distributed monitoring and integrated packaging, for calculating vehicle's dynamic load and its wheel position. Results from the laboratory tests show that the total output of the sensing system increases linearly with the increase of the peak load when the loading amplitude is -25 kN (equivalent to the half-axis load of 20-100 kN); when the loading frequency is between 15 Hz and 19 Hz (equivalent to a speed of 17.8-23.2 km/h), the total output of the system fluctuates around a value of 1.305 V. Combined with finite-element simulation, the system can locate load lateral position with a resolution of 120 mm. Due to the protection packaging, the peak load transferred to the sensing units is approximately 4.36% of the applied peak load. The study indicates the proposed system can provide a promising low-cost, reliable and practical alternative for current WIM systems.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661768>Protective Effect of Resveratrol Improves Systemic Inflammation Responses in LPS-Injected Lambs.</a></h1><p>Highly intensive livestock production often causes immune stress to animals, which makes them more susceptible to infections.

However, 2,129 proteins remain listed as missing proteins (MPs) in the newest neXtProt release (2019-02). The main reasons for MPs are a low-abundance, low-molecular- (LMW), unexpected modifications, membrane characteristics, etc. Moreover, more than 50% of the MS/MS data have not been successfully identified in shotgun proteomics. Open-pFind, an efficient open search engine, recently released by the pFind group in China, might provide the opportunity to identify these buried MPs in complex samples. In this study, proteins and potential MPs were identified using Open-pFind and three other search engines to compare their performance and efficiency with three large-scale datasets digested by three enzymes (Glu-C, Lys-C, and Trypsin) with specificity on different amino acid (AA) residues. Our results demonstrated that Open-pFind identified 44.7-93.1% more peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs), and 21.3-61.6% more peptide sequences than those identified by the second-best search engine. As a result, Open-pFind detected 53.1% more candidate MPs than MaxQuant and 8.8% more candidate MPs than Proteome Discoverer. In total,  (PE2) of the 124 candidate MPs identified by Open-pFind were verified from two unique peptides containing more than 9 AA by using spectrum theoretical prediction with pDeep, and synthesized peptide matching with pBuild, after spectrum quality analysis, isobaric post-translational modification, and single amino acid variant (SAAV) filtering. These five verified MPs can be saved as PE1 proteins. In addition, three other candidate MPs were verified with two unique peptides (one peptide containing more than 9 AA and the other containing only 8 AA), which were slightly lower than the criteria listed by C-HPP, and required additional verification information. More importantly, unexpected modifications were detected in these MPs.

To test whether the difference might be explained by rapid tachyphylaxis in response to elevated concentrations of GIP, and whether patients with type 2 diabetes and their relatives are more susceptible to tachyphylaxis than healthy subjects.In a two-way crossover design, insulinotropic responses to repeated bolus injection (50 pmol/kg  at 30 and 120 min) and continuous infusion of GIP (2 pmol.kg-1.min-1 from 30-180 min) under hyperglycaemic clamp conditions (8. mmol/l) was compared in age- gender- and -matched patients with type 2 diabetes, first degree relatives of such patients, and healthy subjects.Insulin secretory responses to the first and second GIP bolus were not significantly different in any of the subject groups. Subjects with type 2 diabetes had a significant relative impairment versus healthy subjects with continuous (C-peptide, -13.2 %, p < 0.05), but not with repeated bolus administration of GIP (+11.1 %, n.s.).

Optimized treatment strategies are needed to reduce the risk of antiviral resistance. This phase IIIb, randomized, double-blind study () evaluated conventional-dose or double-dose oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza in immunocompromised patients.Patients with primary or secondary immunodeficiency and influenza infection were randomized 1:1 to receive conventional-dose oseltamivir (75 mg adolescents/adults [≥ 13 years]; 30-75 mg by  in children [1-12 years]) or double-dose oseltamivir (150 or 60-150 mg, respectively), twice daily for an extended period of 10 days. Nasal/throat swabs were taken for virology assessments at all study visits. Co-primary endpoints were safety/tolerability and viral resistance. Secondary endpoints included time to symptom alleviation (TTSA) and time to cessation of viral shedding (TTCVS).Of 228 patients enrolled between February 2008 and May 2017, 215 (199 adults) were evaluable for safety, 167 (151 adults) for efficacy, and 152 (138 adults) for resistance. Fewer patients experienced an adverse event (AE) in the conventional-dose group (50.%) versus the double-dose group (59.1%). The most frequently reported AEs were nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and headache. Fifteen patients had post-baseline resistance, more commonly in the conventional-dose group (n  = 12) than in the double-dose group (n  = 3). In adults, median TTSA was similar between arms, while median TTCVS was longer with conventional dosing.Oseltamivir was well tolerated, with a trend toward better safety/tolerability for conventional dosing versus double dosing.

We aimed to determine the frequency of ARFID symptoms and study its characteristics and associated gastrointestinal symptoms.We conducted a retrospective review of charts from 410 consecutive referrals (ages 18-90 y; 73.0% female) to a tertiary care center for neurogastroenterology examination, from January through December 2016. Blinded coders (n=4) applied DSM- criteria for ARFID, with substantial diagnostic agreement (κ=.66).Twenty-six cases (6.3%) met the full criteria for ARFID and 71 cases (17.3%) had clinically significant avoidant or restrictive eating behaviors with insufficient information for a definitive diagnosis of ARFID. Of patients with ARFID symptoms (n=97), 90 patients (92.8%) cited fear of gastrointestinal symptoms as motivation for their avoidant or restrictive eating. A series of binary logistic regressions showed that likelihood of having ARFID symptoms increased significantly in patients with eating- or -related complaints (odds ratio [OR], .09; 95% CI, 2.54-10.21); with dyspepsia, nausea, or vomiting (OR, 3.59; 95% CI, 2.04-6.32); with abdominal pain (OR, 4.72; 95% CI, 1.87-11.81); or with more than 1 diagnosis of a gastrointestinal disorder (OR=1.63, 95% CI, 1.26-2.10).In a retrospective study of patients undergoing neurogastroenterology examinations, we found ARFID symptoms to be most frequently related to fear of gastrointestinal symptoms. Patients undergoing neurogastroenterology or motility examinations should be evaluated for symptoms of ARFID, particularly when providers consider dietary interventions.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

Thus, the objective of the study is to evaluate the efficiency of Nordic Walking for  loss and improvement of functional and physiological state in young adults with overweight and obesity.The study enrolled 77 students from Sechenov University with overweight and obesity aged from 17 to 23 years. 40 students in the main group completed an individual 9-months Nordic Walking exercise program. 37 students in the control group were engaged in physical training within the curriculum of the university. The components of  composition, level of physical working capacity and psycho-emotional status were studied.The final tests showed significant excessive  loss in students in the main group due to fat mass reduction by 18%; increase of physical working capacity by 22.%; improvement of emotional stability by 22% and self-confidence level growth by 24%.Nordic Walking is an effective type of physical training with high motivational component for excessive  loss in young adults. It is proved by significant improvement of the majority of morphofunctional and psychological parameters in students in the main group. Nordic Walking can be used in physical education program at high schools for pupils and students with overweight and obesity.

Diffusion tensor imaging showed significantly higher FA in the cooled than the non-cooled infants in left PLIC and several white matter tracts. After adjusting for sex, birth  and gestational age, the mean difference in PLIC FA between groups was 0.026 (95% CI 0.004 to 0.048, p=0.023). Conventional MRI was available for 46 infants and demonstrated significantly less moderate/severe abnormalities in the cooled (n=2, 9%) than in the non-cooled (n=10, 43%) infants. There was no difference in adverse events between groups.This study confirmed that TH induced by PCM reduced brain injury detected on MRI in infants with moderate HIE in a neonatal intensive care unit in India. Future research should focus on optimal supportive treatment during hypothermia rather than looking at efficacy of TH in low-resource settings.CTRI/2013/05/003693.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Few of the previous studies were able to take into account related reproductive variables simultaneously. The aim of the present study was to explore the influence of these two reproductive factors on the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in postmenopausal parous women from Southeast China.In all, 1,536 postmenopausal parous women were recruited. Self-reported information about reproductive status, including age at menarche, age at menopause, number of children, prepregnancy , and oral contraceptive use, was collected, and duration of reproductive years and time since menopause were calculated. Clinical parameters related with metabolic syndrome were also measured.Longer duration of reproductive years was significantly related with increased presence of the metabolic syndrome (odds ratio [OR] 1.570, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.091, 2.259 for tertile 2 group; OR 1.850, 95% CI 1.163, 2.944 for tertile 3 group; P for trend = 0.010). Women with more than 20 years since menopause were more likely to experience metabolic syndrome (OR 2.422, 95% CI 1.109, .286, P = 0.026) and elevated blood pressure (OR 3.239, 95% CI 1.406, 7.458, P = 0.006) when compared with those with less than 10 years since menopause.Longer duration of reproductive years and time since menopause were associated with higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome in postmenopausal parous women from Southeast China.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658922>Associations of early-life growth with health using an allostatic load score in young, urban African adults: Birth to Twenty Plus Cohort.</a></h1><p>Growth in early life is associated with various individual health outcomes in adulthood, but limited research has been done on associations with a more comprehensive measure of health. Combining information from multiple biological systems, allostatic load (AL) provides such a quantitative measure of overall physiological health. We used longitudinal data from the Birth to Twenty Plus cohort in South Africa to calculate an AL score at age 22 years and examined associations with birth  and linear growth and  gain from age 0 to 2 years and 2 to  years, as attenuated by trajectories of  mass index and pubertal development in later childhood and adolescence. Differences in total AL score between males and females were small, though levels of individual biological factors contributing to AL differed by sex. Increased  gain from age 2 to  years among males was associated with an increased risk of high AL, but no other early-life  were associated with AL. Increased adiposity through childhood and adolescence in females was associated with higher AL in early adulthood. These results illustrate that patterns of early-life growth are not consistently associated with higher AL. While more research is needed to link AL in young adulthood to later health outcomes, these results also suggest increased adiposity during childhood and adolescence represents a potential early sign of later physiological risk.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673966>Genome-wide association studies for growth traits in buffaloes using the single step genomic BLUP.</a></h1><p>Growth traits are important for the profitability of buffalo breeding systems, since in general, these animals are raised both for meat and milk. In this study, the single-step genomic BLUP method was employed to prospect the genomic regions' associated with  at standard ages of 100, 210, 365, and 550 days in a buffalo population, aiming to identify genes with stronger expression for those characteristics. We found 6, 1, 2, and  SNPs significantly associated (p value < 10) with  at 100, 210, 365, and 550 days of age, respectively, where those SNPs respectively explained 0.164, 0.040, 0.044, and 0.213% of the additive variance of each trait. SNP AX-85099682 (BBU24) was significant for  at 100, 210, and 365 days, indicating the existence of a possible QTL affecting the initial growth rate of buffaloes. All told, eight genes (CBLB, TRNAG-UCC, GADD45B, LOC112583811, MGAT4C, KCNMA1, SLC5A2, and TGFB1I1) were identified as candidates for the growth traits of buffaloes.

Previously, we reported a series of novel bicyclic and monocyclic ACC1-selective inhibitors. Among them, compound 1a exhibited highly potent cellular activity (acetate uptake IC = 0.76 nM) as well as promising in vivo PD efficacy. However, compound 1a caused severe  reduction in repeated dose administration in the mouse model. Since 1a showed potent inhibitory activity against mouse ACC1 as well as strong inhibition of mouse ACC2, we further examined a series of 1a analogues in order to reduce undesirable  change. The replacement of acetamide moiety with ureido moiety dramatically improved selectivity of mouse ACC1 against ACC2. In addition, analogue 1b displayed favorable bioavailability in mouse cassette dosing PK study, hence in vivo PD studies were also carried out. Oral administration of 1b significantly reduced the concentration of malonyl-CoA in HCT-116 xenograft tumors at doses of more than 30 mg/kg. Furthermore, compound 1b showed significant antitumor efficacy in 786-O xenograft mice at an oral dose of 30 mg/kg (T/C = 0.%). Accordingly, our novel potent ACC1-selective inhibitor represents a set of useful orally-available research tools, as well as potential therapeutic agents particularly in terms of new cancer therapies.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has previously been shown to improve transplant eligibility through  loss.We aimed to examine the role LSG plays in improving patient outcomes postrenal transplantation, including possible impact on new-onset diabetes after transplant (NODAT).University Hospital.A single-center analysis was performed identifying all patients who underwent KT after LSG from 2011 to 2017 (n = 41). Exclusion criteria included type I diabetes and previous pancreas transplantation. NODAT was defined as a new insulin requirement after KT. Delayed graft function was defined as need for dialysis within the first week after KT. Mean posttransplant follow-up period was 22 months.Forty-one patients underwent KT after LSG after median time of 16 months. Median age of postLSG patients undergoing KT was 56.0 years at time of KT. Average  mass index decreased by 9 from the time of LSG to KT, and no patients regained  at 1-year follow-up. After LSG, the number of patients with hypertension (85.4% versus 48.%) and the number of antihypertensive medications used decreased significantly (1.6 versus .6) at time of KT (P < .001 each). At 1-year follow-up, the improvement in hypertension persisted (51.2% versus 48.%, P = nonsignificant). The average insulin regimen decreased from 33.0 ± 51.6 to 11.7 ± 21. units at KT (P < .001). This improvement also persisted at 1-year follow-up (11.9 versus 11.7 units, P = nonsignificant). Zero patients suffered NODAT over the follow-up period (versus institutional rate of NODAT at 15.8%). One patient developed delayed graft function (2.4%, versus institutional rate of 13.3%). After 1 year postKT, there was 1 graft loss (2.4%) and no mortality.This is the largest reported series of KT after planned LSG in morbidly obese patients.

Whether disease-modifying therapies affect the lipoprotein profile in PwMS has scarcely been studied.The study aims to assess whether fingolimod and dimethyl fumarate (DMF) affect lipoproteins in PwMS.We compared retrospectively the blood lipoprotein levels of 29 fingolimod-treated and 41 DMF-treated patients before and after 3 and 12 months of therapy. Patients treated with cholesterol-reducing medications were not included. Data on  change and disease activity during 1-year follow-up were obtained.HDL level, HDL/LDL ratio and HDL/total cholesterol ratio were increased in both treatment groups after 3 months' therapy and sustained, with no change in LDL or triglycerides. While at baseline only 26% of patients met the recommended minimum of HDL 60 mg/dl, after 3 months' therapy, 43% of fingolimod-treated and 47% of DMF-treated patients reached the recommended level. The majority of patients had no  reduction.Fingolimod and DMF therapies are associated with a specific increase in HDL in PwMS.

Targeting microglialactivationhas proven to be a viable option to develop a disease-modified therapy for PD. Galectin-1, which has been reported to have an anti-neuroinflammation effect was used in the present study to evaluate its therapeutic effects on microglia activation and neuronal degeneration in Parkinson's disease model. It was found that galectin-1 attenuated the inflammatory insult and the apoptosis of SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cells from conditioned medium of activated microglia induced by Lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Nonetheless, galectin-1 administration (0. mg/kg) inhibited the microglia activation, improved the motor deficits in PD mice model induced by MPTP (25 mg/kg  of mouse, i.p.) and prevented the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Administration of galectin-1 resulted in p38 and ERK1/2 dephosphorylation followed by IκB/NFκB signaling pathway inhibition. Galectin-1 significantly decreased the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and protein levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). The protective effects and modulation of the MAPK/IκB/NFκB signaling pathway were abolished with β-D-galactose which blocked the carbohydrate-recognition domain of galectin-1.

We evaluated the effect of prenatal maternal stress on fetal growth and birth outcomes in rural Ghana.Leveraging a prospective, rural Ghanaian birth cohort, we ascertained prenatal maternal negative life events, categorized scores as 0-2 (low stress; referent), 3- (moderate), and >  (high) among 353 pregnant women in the Kintampo North Municipality and Kintampo South District located within the middle belt of Ghana. We employed linear regression to determine associations between prenatal maternal stress and infant birth , head circumference, and length. We additionally examined associations between prenatal maternal stress and adverse birth outcome, including low birth , small for gestational age, or stillbirth. Effect modification by infant sex was examined.In all children, high prenatal maternal stress was associated with reduced birth length (β = - 0.91, p = 0.04; p-value for trend = 0.04). Among girls, moderate and high prenatal maternal stress was associated with reduced birth  (β = - 0.16, p = 0.02; β = - 0.18, p = 0.04 respectively; p-value for trend = 0.04) and head circumference (β = - 0.66, p = 0.05; β = - 1.02, p = 0.01 respectively; p-value for trend = 0.01). In girls, high prenatal stress increased odds of any adverse birth outcome (OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.01-.75; p for interaction = 0.04). Sex-specific analyses did not demonstrate significant effects in boys.All infants, but especially girls, were vulnerable to effects of prenatal maternal stress on birth outcomes.

Since the beginning of the 1990s, several telemedicine projects and studies focused on type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Over the last  years, numerous telemedicine projects based on connected objects and new information and communication technologies (ICT) (elements defining telemedicine 2.0) have emerged or are still under development. Two examples are the DIABETe and Telesage telemonitoring project which perfectly fits within the telemedicine 2.0 framework - the first to include artificial intelligence (AI) with MyPredi and Diabeo. Mainly, these projects and studies show that telemonitoring diabetic result in: improvements in control of blood glucose (BG) level and significant reduction in HbA1c (e.g., for Telescot et TELESAGE studies); positive impact on co-morbidities (arterial hypertension, , dyslipidemia) (e.g., for Telescot and DIABETe studies); better patient's quality of life (e.g., for DIABETe study); positive impact on appropriation of the disease by patients and/or greater adherence to therapeutic and hygiene-dietary  (e.g., The Utah Remote Monitoring Project); and at least, good receptiveness by patients and their empowerment. To date, the magnitude of its effects remains debatable, especially with the variation in patients' characteristics (e.g., background, ability for self-management, medical condition), samples selection and approach for the treatment of control groups.

Outcomes were mortality (procedure-related, 30-day), complications (early (≤ 30 days) and late) and success rates.   A total of 760 procedures (469 PRG and 291 PEG) were analyzed. Most common indications were head and neck cancer (HNC), cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Success rates for placement were 91.2 % for PEG and 97.1 % for PRG (   = 0.001). Procedure-related mortality was 1.7 % in PEG and 0.4 % in PRG (   = 0.113). The 30-day mortality was 10.7 % in PEG and .1 % in PRG (   = 0.481 after multivariate logistic regression) CVA was associated with higher 30-day mortality, whereas ALS, higher , and prophylactic placements in HNC were associated with lower rates. Tube-related complications were less frequent in PEG, both early (2.7 % vs. 26.4 %,   ≤ 0.001) and late (8.6 % vs. 31. %,   ≤ 0.001). The percentage of major complications and infections did not differ.   With respect to procedure-related and 30-day mortality, PEG and PRG compare equally. PRG had a higher procedural success rate. Tube-related complications and pain are less frequent after PEG compared to PRG.

ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: .The 109 patients in this study had a baseline  mass index and age of 33.0 ± 4.7 and 17.6 ± 2.2 (range: 10-21) years, respectively. Ninety-nine (90.8%) were females. The mean procedure time was 61 ± 19 minutes. The mean % total  loss at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months was 14.4% ± 6.%, 16.2% ± 8.3%, 15.4% ± 9.2%, and 13.7% ± 8.0%, respectively. Fourteen adolescents visited the ambulatory clinic for analgesia. One patient (aged 19.8 years) requested removal of endoscopic stitches due to abdominal pain, and another underwent Redo-ESG for insufficient  loss. There were no blood transfusions, emergency admissions, mortality, or significant morbidity.In this first study to date on ESG in pediatric patients, we observed that the procedure is safe and effective in children and adolescents with obesity. Significant  loss occurs during the first 2 years without mortality or significant morbidity, and this  loss seems to be maintained.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663633>Delayed adverse events in male plateletpheresis donors: Initial insights on donor safety.</a></h1><p>Minimal information is available regarding delayed adverse donor events (D-ADEs) in plateletpheresis donors. Proactive follow up of donors for D-ADEs is not done routinely by BTS. The aim of this study was to analyze frequency and type of D-ADEs and its correlation with contributory factors if any.In this prospective observational study all eligible donors were contacted by telephone twice and asked about general wellbeing and questions specific to adverse donor events (ADEs). Donors were called at 24 hours and 2 weeks after donation. The ADEs were categorized in accordance with the International Society of Blood Transfusion standard guidelines.A total of 531 donors were analyzed in the study. D-ADEs were more common as compared to immediate ADEs (I-ADEs) (19.21% vs .46%, P < .0001). The most common D-ADEs were bruises (7.34%) and sore arms (3.58%). Localized D-ADEs in form of bruise and hematomas were more frequent as compared to systemic D-ADEs like fatigue and vaso-vagal reactions (16.01% vs 3.20% P < .0001). Repeat donors had a lower incidence of systemic D-ADEs (1.61% vs 6.96%, P = .001). Donors with  ≤75 kg and platelet count ≤230 × 10  μL were more prone to systemic D-ADEs (P < .05). Citrate toxicity was more common in donors with  ≤ 75 kg (P = .002).Plateletpheresis procedures are relatively safer without any sequelae. D-ADEs are more common than I-ADEs. Localized D-ADEs are more frequent than systemic D-ADEs. First-time donors are more prone to D-ADEs than repeat donors.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672064>Association of WIC Participation and Growth and Developmental Outcomes in High-Risk Infants.</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to describe the association of enrollment in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and infant growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes.  scores and Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-Third Edition (Bayley-III) and Vineland Adaptive/Behavior Scale-II (VABS-II) scores represented primary outcomes.

Calves were randomised to receive meloxicam (0. mg/kg) or an equivalent volume of placebo subcutaneously at birth. Calf blood samples were collected between one and seven days of age to determine serum immunoglobulin (IgG) concentration. Colostrum intake, treatment for disease, mortality, and weaning  were recorded. Multilevel linear or logistic regression models were used to determine the effects of meloxicam and to identify risk factors.There was no effect of meloxicam on serum IgG concentrations, average daily gain (ADG), or risk of inadequate TPI (serum IgG concentration <24 g/l), treatment for disease, or mortality (P>0.05). Bottle or tube feeding calves were associated with decreased serum IgG concentrations (P=0.01) compared with nursing. Calves with an incomplete tongue withdrawal reflex had higher odds of being treated for disease compared with those with complete withdrawal (P=0.009). Being born meconium-stained and having decreased serum IgG concentrations were associated with an increased risk of mortality (P=0.03). Being born of a mature cow, having a higher birth , and increased serum IgG concentrations were associated with greater ADG to weaning (P<0.05).Vigour assessment at birth along with good colostrum management may be important to improve TPI and health in high-risk calves such as those assisted at birth.© British Veterinary Association 2019.

Polluted media are closely linked to food security through plants, especially agricultural crops. However, measuring EFC's in plant tissues remains difficult, and high-throughput screening is of greater challenge. A novel rapid freeze-thaw/centrifugation extraction followed by high performance liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) analysis was developed for high-throughput quantification of eleven EFCs with diverse chemical properties, including: estriol, codeine, oxazepam, 2,4-dinitrotoluene, 1,3,-trinitroperhydro-1,3,-triazine, bisphenol-A, triclosan, caffeine, carbamazepine, lincomycin, and DEET, in three representative crops, corn, tomato, and wheat. The internal aqueous solution, i.e. sap, is liberated via a freeze/thaw cycle, and separated from macromolecules utilizing molecular  cut-off membrane centrifugal filtration. Detection limits ranged from 0.01 μg L-1 to 2.0 μg L-1. Recoveries of spiked analytes in three species ranged from 83.7% to 109%. Developed methods can rapidly screen EFCs in agriculture crops and can assess pollutant distribution at contaminated sites and gain insight on EFCs transport in plants to assess transmembrane migration in vascular organisms. The findings contribute significantly to environmental research, food security, and human health, as it assesses the first step of potential entry into the food chain, that being transmembrane migration and plant uptake, the primary barrier between polluted waters or soils and our food.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667896>Food restriction, nutrition status, and growth in toddlers with atopic dermatitis.</a></h1><p>Multiple factors affect growth in children with atopic dermatitis (AD).

The feather shaft is an important connective unit, made of a lightweight material, which also contributes to aiding flight. The shaft can withstand loads from different directions and has outstanding compression resistance. In this study, the microstructure and composition of the A. fabalis feather shaft were observed by scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, and its compression resistance was studied by compression testing. The results indicated that the mechanical property of the shaft is related to its microstructure. Compression testing verified that the primary feathers had the strongest mechanical properties, followed by the secondaries, and finally the alulae. Under the same conditions, the specific energy absorption of the three feather types was .96, .02, and 3.17 J/g, respectively. With increasing moisture content, the rachis was softened and the energy absorption was reduced. At low moisture content, the specific energy absorption of the primaries was reduced to 1.03 J/g, that of the secondaries was reduced to 1.72 J/g, and that of the alulae to 0.39 J/g.

The incidence of lung cancer is increasing rapidly, in parallel with an increased incidence of smoking. Effective chemoprevention may be an alternative strategy to control the incidence of lung cancer. Thus, the objective of current work was to ascertain the possible preventive and therapeutic efficacies of  extract in a mouse model of lung tumorigenesis and its cytotoxicity toward the A549 human lung cancer cell line. Lung tumorigenesis was induced by the oral administration of benzo(a)pyrene (50 mg/kg b.w.) twice per week to Swiss albino mice for 4 weeks. Benzo(a)pyrene-treated mice were orally administered  (300 mg/kg ,  days/week) for 2 weeks before or 9 weeks after the first benzo(a)pyrene dose, for a total of 21 weeks. At the end of the administration period, various parameters were measured in the serum and lung tissues. The results revealed that the oral administration of benzo(a)pyrene resulted in increases in relative lung , serum levels of tumor markers (ADA, AHH, and LDH), and the inflammatory marker NF-κB, and a decreased total antioxidant capacity compared with the control. In addition, decreased levels of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, with a concomitant increase in lipid peroxidation, metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-12), and the angiogenic marker VEGF were detected in lung tissues. Moreover, benzo(a)pyrene administration induced the upregulation of PKCα, COX-2, and Bcl-2 expression, with the downregulation of BAX and caspase-3 expression.  treatment alleviated all alterations in these parameters, which was further confirmed by the histopathological analysis of lung tissues.

The main objective of this study was to identify the risk factors for acute undernutrition among under- children in Bangladesh. Data were taken from the nationally representative Bangladesh Demographic Health and Survey conducted in 2014. The study sample comprised 7131 under- children. Of these, 4.6% were found to be severely wasted (Z-score < -3.0), 11.1% moderately wasted (-3.0≤Z-score < -2.0) and 84.3% adequately nourished (Z-score ≥-2.0). Chi-squared analysis was used to investigate the association between child nutrition status and selected covariates. Multinomial logistic regression was applied to identify the risk factors for acute undernutrition. The selected factors division, place of residence, sex of child, place of delivery, child age, respiratory illness, size at birth, measles vaccination, fever, diarrhoea, maternal BMI, maternal education, paternal occupation, wealth index and household toilet facilities were found to be highly significant (p < 0.05) in the analysis. Multinomial regression analysis revealed that residence in Barisal and Chittagong divisions, a smaller than average size at birth and low maternal BMI (≤18.50 kg/m2) were significant determinants of both moderate and severe acute undernutrition among under- children in Bangladesh.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671415>Probing the Griffiths like phase, unconventional dual glassy states, giant exchange bias effects and its correlation with its electronic structure in Pr<sub>2-x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>CoMnO<sub>6</sub>.</a></h1><p>Crystal structure, electronic structure, dc and ac magnetization properties of the hole substituted (Sr2+) partially B-site disordered double perovskite Pr2-xSrxCoMnO6 system have been investigated. The XRD pattern analysis showed the systematic decrease in the lattice parameters owing to the enhanced oxidation states of the Co/Mn ions. The electronic structure study by XPS measurements suggested the presence of mixed valence states of the B-site ions (Co2+/Co3+ and Mn3+/Mn4+) with significant enhancement of the average oxidation states due to hole doping. The mere absence of electronic states near the Fermi level in the valence band (VB) spectra for both of the pure (x=0.0) and Sr doped (x=0.) systems indicated the insulating nature of the samples. Sr substitution is observed to increase the spectral  near the Fermi level suggesting for an enhanced conductivity of the hole doped system. The dc magnetization data divulged a Griffiths like phase above the long-range ordering temperature. A typical re-entrant spin glass like phase driven by the inherent anti-site disorder (ASD) has been recognized by ac susceptibility study for both the pure and doped systems. Most interestingly, the emergence of a new cluster glass like phase (immediately below the magnetic ordering temperature and above the spin-glass transition temperature) solely driven by the Sr substitution has been unravelled by ac magnetization dynamics study. Observation of these dual glassy states in a single system is scarce and hence placed the present system amongst the rare materials. The isothermal magnetization measurements further probed the exhibition of the giant exchange bias effect originated from the interfacial exchange interactions due to existence of low temperature antiferromagnetic clusters embedded in the glassy matrix.© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675673>Antidepressant and antinociceptive activities in animal models and in vitro assessment of the anti-thyroid activity of bis(DL-pyroglutamate)magnesium complex.</a></h1><p>Magnesium is an essential element related with biochemistry of the brain and different types of depression have been associated with its deficiency.The structure of a novel magnesium bis(DL-pyroglutamate) (Mg(DL-pGlu)) was elucidated by X-ray crystallography. Wistar rats were used in the in vivo experiments. The antidepressant-like effect was assessed by the forced swim test (FST) and the antinociceptive activity was evaluated using hot plate test. In both, non-specific effects were evaluated by the open field test. Anti-thyroid activity was examined using Lang's method. Albumin binding behavior was evaluated by 3D fluorescence spectroscopy.For the Mg(DL-pGlu) complex (30 mg/kg), the FST test on Wistar rats revealed a decrease of 22% in the immobility time and an increment of 106% in the swimming time. The compound alters neither the locomotor activity nor the  after chronic administration. At the same dose, it showed antinociceptive activity, increasing the response latency. It blocks iodination reactions generating a charge transfer complex with iodine hence indicating anti-thyroid activity (K = 45366. ± 29 M). Albumin 3D fluorescence spectroscopy experiments showed intensity increase of peak A and decrease of peak B.The results showed that the new compound produced a lowering of the immobility time and an increment of the swimming ability of the rats.

Although some progress has been made in the past years, the pathogenesis of ALI is still poorly understood and the therapeutic outcome has still not been significantly improved. It is well-recognized that magnesium sulfate (MgSO) possesses potent anti-inflammation capacity. The present study was designed to investigate the protective effects of MgSO in lipopolysaccharides (LPSs)-induced ALI taken into account that excessive inflammatory response plays critical role in the development of ALI. In this study, Kunming mice were intravenously injected with LPS through tail vein to establish the ALI model and in parallel, A549 cells were used to establish cell model. The lung wet-to-dry  ratio, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in lung tissue, lung permeability index, hematoxylin and eosin staining, cytokines in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), neutrophil counts in BALF, LPS-induced A549 cell apoptosis as well as apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), and Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) expression in both mice and A549 cells were detected. Our results demonstrated that MgSO significantly attenuated the LPS-induced ALI, oxidative stress (decreased MDA levels), and lung inflammatory response. Moreover, MgSO exerted protective effects by mitigating LPS-induced A549 cell apoptosis. Furthermore, MgSO decreased the AIF and PARP-1 expression both in vivo and in vitro. Our results, taken together, demonstrated that MgSO is a potential therapeutic agent for ALI taken into consideration that MgSO is commonly used in clinical settings.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657983>Correlation between Dental Maturity and  Mass Index in Korean Children.</a></h1><p>: The aim of this study was to determine relationships between dental maturity and  mass index (BMI) in Korean children. : 600 Korean children aged between  and 10 years for whom panoramic radiographs have been obtained between 2010 and 2017 were selected.

To better understand these relationships, we examined cross-sectional associations between bone turnover markers (BTMs) and metabolic traits in a population with high bone mass (HBM, BMD Z-score≥+3.2).β-C-terminal telopeptide of type-I collagen (β-CTX), procollagen type-1 amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP) and osteocalcin were assessed by electrochemiluminescence immunoassays. Metabolic traits, including lipids and glycolysis-related metabolites, were measured using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy. Associations of BTMs with metabolic traits were assessed using Generalized Estimating Equation linear regression, accounting for within-family correlation, adjusting for potential confounders (age, sex, height, , menopause, bisphosphonate and oral glucocorticoid use).198 adults with HBM had complete data, mean [SD] age 61.6 [13.7] years; 77% female. Of 23 summary metabolic traits, citrate was positively related to all BTMs: adjusted β =0.050 (95% CI 0.024,0.076),p=1.71x10 , β =6.54x10 (1.87x10 ,0.001),p=0.006 and β =2.40x10 (6.49x10 ,4.14x10 ),p=0.007 (β= increase in citrate (mmol/L) per 1μg/L BTM increase).

Compared to the 2-year follow-up, no further subsidence was observed.The rate of stem revision (0%) at the mid-term follow-up was remarkable and indicates the principle of using a calcar-guided short stem as being a safe procedure. However, signs of bone-remodelling, indicating some amount of stress-shielding, must be acknowledged at  years depending on stem alignment and type of anchorage.IV, Prospective observational study Trial registration German Clinical Trials Register, DRKS00012634, 07/07/2017 (retrospectively registered).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666551>Robot-assisted Nipple-sparing Mastectomy with Immediate Breast Reconstruction: An Initial Experience.</a></h1><p>Seeking smaller and indistinct incisions, physicians have attempted endoscopic breast surgery in breast cancer patients. Unfortunately, there are some limitations in the range of movement and visualization of the operation field. Potentially addressing these limitations, we investigated the outcomes of gas and gasless robot-assisted nipple-sparing mastectomy (RANSM) with immediate breast reconstruction (IBR). Ten patients underwent 12 RANSM with IBR between November 2016 and April 2018. Patients with tumors measuring > cm in diameter, tumor invasion of the skin or nipple-areolar complex, proven metastatic lymph nodes, or planned radiotherapy were excluded. Age, breast , diagnosis, tumor size, hormone receptor status, and operation time were retrospectively collected. Postoperative outcomes including postoperative complications and final margin status of resected were analyzed. The median total operation time and console time were 351 min (267-480 min) and 51 min (18-143 min), respectively. The learning curve presented as a cumulative sum graph showed that the console time decreased and then stabilized at the eighth case. There was no open conversion or major postoperative complication. One patient had self-resolved partial nipple ischemia, and two patients experienced partial skin ischemia. We deemed that RANSM with IBR is safe and feasible for early breast cancer, benign disease of the breast, and BRCA 1/2 mutation carriers. RANSM is an advanced surgical method with a short learning curve.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660108>Prevalence and Risk Factors of Retinopathy of Prematurity in Iran.</a></h1><p>The present study aimed to evaluate the frequency and risk factors of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) among Iranian infants.A retrospective cohort study was conducted on infants who had undergone screening for ROP at Farabi Eye Hospital, between March 2016 and March 2017. Data were analyzed based on the presence of extreme prematurity (gestational age  28 weeks), extremely low-birth- (  1000 g), and multiple-gestation (MG) infants.The prevalence of ROP was 27.28% (  = 543) among all screened infants, 74.4% for extremely preterm (EP) infants, 77.% for extremely low birth  (ELBW) babies, and 27.25% for infants from MG pregnancies. On multivariate analysis, gestational age, birth , and history of transfusion (  < 0.0001,  < 0.0001, and  = 0.04, respectively) were found to be significantly associated with ROP. More advanced stages of ROP (  < 0.0001) were observed in EP and ELBW infants. Birth  (  = 0.088), history of transfusion (  = 0.066), and intubation (  = 0.053) were not associated with increased risk of ROP in EP infants, while gestational age (  = 0.037) and history of transfusion (  = 0.040) were significant risk factors for ROP in ELBW infants. Gestational age (P < 0.001) and birth  (  = 0.001) were significantly associated with ROP in infants from MG pregnancies in multivariate analysis.ROP remains a commonly encountered disease, especially in ELBW and EP infants. The history of transfusion may have a role in stratifying the risk for ROP and guiding future screening guidelines.Copyright © 2019 Zarei et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663832>Relationships between -scores at the hip and bone mineral density at the distal femur and proximal tibia in persons with spinal cord injury.</a></h1><p> To identify -score values at the total hip (TH) and femoral neck (FN) that correspond to the cutoff value of <0.60 g/cm for heightened risk of fracture at the distal femur (DF) and proximal tibia (PT Retrospective analysis of data in a research center's database.

Gastrointestinal hormones are involved in energy and glucose homeostasis, thus postoperative changes of their circulating levels may be mediating future  loss. To investigate how the circulating concentrations of gastrointestinal hormones change in response to the most common types of bariatric operation and whether these changes can predict future  loss.We measured circulating GLP-1, GLP-2, oxyntomodulin, glicentin, glucagon, major proglucagon fragment (MPGF), ghrelin, GIP, PYY after overnight fasting and/or after a mixed meal test (MMT) in: a) 14 subjects that have undergone either an adjustable gastric banding [AGB] (n = 9) or a Roux-en-Y bypass (RYGB) (n = ) (Pilot study 1), b) 28 subjects that have undergone either a vertical sleeve gastrectomy (n = 17) or a RYGB (n = 11) before and three, six and twelve months after surgery.In addition to the expected associations with GLP-1, the most robust increases were observed in postprandial levels of oxyntomodulin and glicentin three months after VSG or RYGB (but not after AGB) and are associated with degree of  loss. Oxyntomodulin and glicentin levels at the third and sixth month postoperative visit are positively associated with feeling of satiety which may be underlying the observed associations with future  loss.Beyond GLP-1, early postprandial changes in circulating oxyntomodulin and glicentin are predictors of  loss after bariatric surgery, possibly through regulation of satiety. Further studies should focus on underlying mechanisms, and their potential as attractive therapeutic tools against obesity and related comorbidities.Copyright © 2019.

Cystinosis is caused by mutations in the CTNS gene that encodes the lysosomal cystine carrier protein cystinosin. CTNS mutations result in either complete absence or reduced cystine transporting function of the protein. The diagnosis of nephropathic cystinosis is generally based on measuring leukocyte cystine level, demonstration of corneal cystine crystals by the slit lamp examination and confirmed by genetic analysis of the CTNS gene.A boy born to consanguineous Caucasian parents had the characteristic clinical features of the infantile nephropathic cystinosis including renal Fanconi syndrome (polydipsia/polyuria, metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, low molecular  proteinuria, glycosuria, cystine crystals in the cornea) and elevated WBC cystine levels. Initially we performed RFLP analysis of the common in the Northern European population 57-kb deletion of proband's DNA, then a direct Sanger sequencing which revealed no mutations in the coding part of the CTNS gene. To confirm the diagnosis we performed RT-PCR analysis of total RNA obtained from patient-derived fibroblasts in combination with cDNA sequencing. This revealed the skipping of exon 4 and exon  in the CTNS in our patient. Therefore, we detected a novel 9-kb homozygous deletion in the CTNS gene at genomic DNA level, spanning region from intron 3 to intron . In order to identify the inheritance pattern of the deletion we analyzed DNA of proband's mother and father. Both parents were found to be heterozygous carriers of the CTNS mutation.Analysis of CTNS gene transcript allowed to identify a large homozygous deletion in the patient with infantile nephropathic cystinosis. Mutational detection at RNA level may be an efficient tool to establish the genetic defect in some cystinosis patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657610>Effect of water consumption on  loss: a systematic review.</a></h1><p>Water intake has been proposed for  loss; however, the evidence of its efficacy is limited. The aim of this study was to systematically review the randomized clinical trials that assessed the effect of water consumption on  with a follow up ≥ 12 weeks. A systematic query-based search was performed on PubMed, EBSCO, and Cochrane Library to identify eligible records that quantitatively measured  change after interventions. This review included six RCTs that reported different strategies for  loss achievement: increasing daily water intake, replacement of caloric beverages with water, and premeal waterload. All the studies showed a  loss effect after follow-up, ranged from -0.4 kg to -8.8 kg with a mean percentage of  loss of .15%. The most effective intervention among the studies was the replacement of caloric beverages with water. The quality of the evidence for the primary outcome of  loss was rated low to moderate. The main limitation of these results is the short-term follow up-period. In conclusion, despite .15% of  loss, the low to moderate quality of evidence and the short term of follow-up are limitations to support evidence-based recommendations of water consumption for  loss.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672447>The Rho GTPase RND3 regulates adipocyte lipolysis.</a></h1><p>Adipose tissue plays a crucial role in diet- and obesity-related insulin resistance, with implications for several metabolic diseases. Identification of novel target genes and mechanisms that regulate adipocyte function could lead to improved treatment strategies. RND3 (RhoE/Rho8), a Rho-related GTP-binding protein that inhibits Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling, has been linked to diverse diseases such as apoptotic cardiomyopathy, heart failure, cancer and type 2 diabetes, in part by regulating cytoskeleton dynamics and insulin-mediated glucose uptake.We here investigated the expression of RND3 in adipose tissue in human obesity, and discovered a role for RND3 in regulating adipocyte metabolism. In cross-sectional and prospective studies, we observed -fold increased adipocyte levels of RND3 mRNA in obesity, reduced levels after surgery-induced  loss, and positive correlations of RND3 mRNA with adipocyte size and surrogate  of insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR and circulating triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TAG/HDL-C) ratio). By screening for RND3-dependent gene expression following siRNA-mediated RND3 knockdown in differentiating human adipocytes, we found downregulation of inflammatory genes and upregulation of genes related to adipocyte ipolysis and insulin signaling. Treatment of adipocytes with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), hypoxia or cAMP analogs increased RND3 mRNA levels 1.-2-fold. Functional assays in primary human adipocytes confirmed that RND3 knockdown reduces cAMP- and isoproterenol-induced lipolysis, which were mimicked by treating cells with ROCK inhibitor. This effect could partly be explained by reduced protein expression of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL).We here uncovered a novel differential expression of adipose RND3 in obesity and insulin resistance, which may at least partly depend on a causal effect of RND3 on adipocyte lipolysis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Six-hundred and ninety-seven subjects (38 with T2DM) were enrolled. A baseline FLI ≥ 60 (the threshold for fatty liver) was found in 264 subjects (37.9%). The mean duration of fasting was 8. ± 4.0 days (range 6-38). FLI decreased significantly (-14.02 ± 11.67;  < 0.0001), with a larger effect in individuals with T2DM (-19.15 ± 11.0;  < 0.0001;  = 0.002 compared to non-diabetic subjects).  mass index (BMI) decreased by -1.51 ± 0.82 kg/m, and 49.9% of the subjects lost ≥% . After fasting, nearly half of the 264 subjects with FLI ≥ 60 (highest risk category) shifted to a lower category. The improvement of FLI correlated with the number of fasting days (r = -0.20,  < 0.0001) and with the magnitude of BMI reduction (r = 0.14,  = 0.0001).

Renal resistive index (RI) by using renal Doppler can be a helpful tool in detecting functional alterations in renal hemodynamics. This study was conducted on 100 children and adolescents with type 1 DM. They were further subdivided into two equal subgroups: group 1 with type 1 DM and normo-albuminuria [urinary albumin excretion (UAE) <30 mg/24 hours], and group 2 with type 1 DM and hyper-albuminuria (increased UAE >30 mg/24 hours). There were 37 males (37%) and 63 females (63%); their mean ages were 13.6±2.53 (range, 10-19) years and mean disease duration was 8.867±2.260 (range, -13) years. Progressive increase in RI was significantly associated with increased disease duration more than 10 years, elevated serum HbA1c more than 7.% and early pubertal stages. While not significantly related to sex, , height, blood pressure or serum lipid profile, diabetic micro-vascular complications (nephropathy and sensory neuropathy) were more prevalent among patients with RI more than 0.58. Renal RI could be a useful complementary test for the evaluation of functional alterations in renal hemodynamics in the early stages of diabetic nephropathy.2019 Annals of Translational Medicine.

A prospective cohort study.</a></h1><p>To evaluate the short-term impact of long-distance running on knee joints using MRI.82 healthy adults participating in their first marathon underwent 3T (Tesla) MRI of both knees 6 months before and half a month after the marathon: 71 completed both the 4 month-long standardised training programme and the marathon; and 11 dropped-out during training and did not run the marathon. Two senior musculoskeletal radiologists graded the internal knee structures using validated scoring systems. Participants completed Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score questionnaires at each visit for self-reporting knee function.Premarathon and pretraining MRI showed signs of damage, without symptoms, to several knee structures in the majority of the 82 middle-aged volunteers. However, after the marathon, MRI showed a reduction in the radiological score of damage in: subchondral bone marrow oedema in the condyles of the tibia (p=0.011) and femur (p=0.082). MRI did also show an increase in radiological scores to the following structures: cartilage of the lateral patella (p=0.0005); semimembranosus tendon (p=0.016); iliotibial band (p<0.0001) and the prepatellar bursa (p=0.016).Improvement to damaged subchondral bone of the tibial and femoral condyles was found following the marathon in novice runners, as well as worsening of the patella cartilage although asymptomatic. This is the most robust evidence to link marathon running with knee joint health and provides important information for those seeking to understand the link between long distance running and osteoarthritis of the main -bearing areas of the knee.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Of those, 2498 veterans who underwent bariatric surgery were allocated to the surgery cohort. Sequential stratification was used to match each patient in the surgery cohort with up to 3 patients who had not undergone bariatric surgery but were of the same sex, race/ethnicity, diabetes status, and VA regional network and were closest in age,  mass index (calculated as  in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), and comorbidities. A total of 7456 patients were identified and allocated to the nonsurgery (control) cohort. The VA health care expenditures among the surgery and nonsurgery cohorts were estimated using regression models. Data were analyzed from July to August 2018 and in April 2019.The bariatric surgical procedures (n = 2498) included in this study were Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (1842 [73.7%]), sleeve gastrectomy (381 [15.3%]), adjustable gastric banding (249 [10.0%]), and other procedures (26 [1.0%]).The study measured total, outpatient, inpatient, and outpatient pharmacy expenditures from 3 years before surgery to 10 years after surgery, excluding expenditures associated with the initial bariatric surgical procedure.Among 9954 veterans with severe obesity, 7387 (74.2%) were men; the mean (SD) age was 52.3 (8.8) years for the surgery cohort and 52. (8.7) years for the nonsurgery cohort. Mean total expenditures for the surgery cohort were $5093 (95% CI, $4811-$5391) at 7 to 12 months before surgery, which increased to $7448 (95% CI, $6989-$7936) at 6 months after surgery. Postsurgical expenditures decreased to $6692 (95% CI, $6197-$7226) at  years after surgery, followed by a gradual increase to $8495 (95% CI, $7609-$9484) at 10 years after surgery. Total expenditures were higher in the surgery cohort than in the nonsurgery cohort during the 3 years before surgery and in the first 2 years after surgery. The expenditures of the 2 cohorts converged  to 10 years after surgery. Outpatient pharmacy expenditures were significantly lower among the surgery cohort in all years of follow-up ($509 lower at 3 years before surgery and $461 lower at 7 to 12 months before surgery), but these cost reductions were offset by higher inpatient and outpatient (nonpharmacy) expenditures.In this cohort study of 9954 predominantly older male veterans with severe obesity, total health care expenditures increased immediately after patients underwent bariatric surgery but converged with those of patients who had not undergone surgery at 10 years after surgery. This finding suggests that the value of bariatric surgery lies primarily in its associations with improvements in health and not in its potential to decrease health care costs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662081>The genetics of morphological and behavioural island traits in deer mice.</a></h1><p>Animals on islands often exhibit dramatic differences in morphology and behaviour compared with mainland individuals, a phenomenon known as the 'island syndrome'. These differences are thought to be adaptations to island environments, but the extent to which they have a genetic basis or instead represent plastic responses to environmental extremes is often unknown. Here, we revisit a classic case of island syndrome in deer mice () from British Columbia. We first show that Saturna Island mice and those from neighbouring islands are approximately 35% (approx.  g) heavier than mainland mice and diverged approximately 10 000 years ago. We then establish laboratory colonies and find that Saturna Island mice are heavier both because they are longer and have disproportionately more lean mass. These trait differences are maintained in second-generation captive-born mice raised in a common environment. In addition, island-mainland hybrids reveal a maternal genetic effect on . Using behavioural testing in the laboratory, we also find that wild-caught island mice are less aggressive than mainland mice; however, laboratory-raised mice born to these founders do not differ in aggression. Together, our results reveal that these mice have different responses to the environmental conditions on islands-a heritable change in a morphological trait and a plastic response in a behavioural trait.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660682>Early clinical experience with varian halcyon V2 linear accelerator: Dual-isocenter IMRT planning and delivery with portal dosimetry for gynecological cancer treatments.</a></h1><p>Varian Halcyon linear accelerator version 2 (The Halcyon 2.0) was recently released with new upgraded features. The aim of this study was to report our clinical experience with Halcyon 2.0 for a dual-isocenter intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) planning and delivery for gynecological cancer patients and examine the feasibility of in vivo portal dosimetry.Twelve gynecological cancer patients were treated with extended-field IMRT technique using two isocenters on Halcyon 2.0 to treat pelvis and pelvic/or para-aortic nodes region. The prescription dose was 45 Gy in 25 fractions (fxs) with simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) dose of 55 or 57. Gy in 25 fxs to involved nodes. All treatment plans, pretreatment patient-specific QA and treatment delivery records including daily in vivo portal dosimetry were retrospectively reviewed. For in vivo daily portal dosimetry analysis, each fraction was compared to the reference baseline (1st fraction) using gamma analysis criteria of 4 %/4 mm with 90% of total pixels in the portal image planar dose.All 12 extended-field IMRT plans met the planning criteria and delivered as planned (a total of 300 fractions). Conformity Index (CI) for the primary target was achieved with the range of 0.99-1.14. For organs at risks, most were well within the dose volume criteria. Treatment delivery time was from .0 to 6. min. Interfractional in vivo dose variation exceeded gamma analysis threshold for 8 fractions out of total 300 (2.7%). These eight fractions were found to have a relatively large difference in small bowel filling and SSD change at the isocenter compared to the baseline.Halcyon 2.0 is effective to create complex extended-field IMRT plans using two isocenters with efficient delivery. Also Halcyon in vivo dosimetry is feasible for daily treatment monitoring for organ motion, internal or external anatomy, and  which could further lead to adaptive radiation therapy.© 2019 The Authors.

Plasma concentrations of MTX were determined in blood samples collected at 24, 36, 42 or 48 h post-infusion, by means of the CMIA immunoassay. The development of the population pharmacokinetic model was performed using the NONMEM software evaluating the covariates that influence in clearance (CL), intercompartmental clearance (Q), central (V) and peripheral (V) volume of distribution of MTX.A two-compartment open model was selected to describe concentration-time data and  surface area (BSA) was the covariate that influences on MTX total CL. The population pharmacokinetic model obtained was: CL (L/h) = 6. × BSA, V (L) = 0.36 × , Q (L/h) = 0.41 and V (L) = 3.2. Internal validation was performed by bootstrap and visual predictive check.

The study explored changes in the faecal microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) associated with the diet (including nonnutritive sweeteners (NNSs)) and evaluated metabolic consequences in subjects with morbid obesity. The diet was assessed with a validated food frequency questionnaire. One unit of NNSs was 100 mL beverage with NNSs or 2 tablets/teaspoons of NNSs. The faecal microbiota was assessed with GA-map® dysbiosis test and SCFA with gas chromatography and flame ionisation detection. Fourteen men and 75 women with a mean age of 44.6 (SD 8.7) years, BMI 41.8 (SD 3.6) kg/m, and intake of NNSs 7. units/day (SD 3.2; range 0-43) were included. Faecal butyric acid was positively and negatively associated with the intake of starch (partial correlation = 0.264; =0.015) and NNSs (partial correlation = -0.274; =0.011), respectively. NNSs were associated with changes in four out of 39 bacterial groups. Butyric acid has antiobesogenic effects, reduces insulin resistance, and improves dyslipidaemia. Since the -reducing effect of NNSs on obese adults trying to lose  is dubious, it seems imprudent to use NNSs that might counteract the favourable effects of butyric acid.Copyright © 2019 Per G.

From April to October 2018, 70 children with asthma in clinical remission were selected from Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University using randomized controlled study design. These children were randomly divided into study group and control group, with 35 cases in each group. In the study group,  cases were lost to follow-up, and 30 cases were actually enrolled. In the control group, 6 cases were lost to follow-up, and 29 cases were actually enrolled. Children in the control group received routine medication and regular outpatient consultation, and children in the study group received the five-in-one asthma management model. In the first time of seeing a doctor, after 3 months and 6 months of follow-up, asthma control test score, medication compliance index score and lung function index (forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), PEF were evaluated respectively.Parental satisfaction, asthma acute episodes, , height and biochemical index were recorded during the 6 months of follow-up. Pulmonary function index, asthma control score and  mass index of overweight children with asthma were compared with -test, medication compliance was compared with chi-square test, and the rank sum test was used for the comparison of the number of emergency visits of asthma attacks and parents' satisfaction.  A total of 59 children with asthma were included, among them 30 were in the study group (8.1±1.) years old and 29 in the control group (9.2±1.1) years old. After 3 months of follow-up, FEV1, PEF, asthma control score in the study group were (86.3±1.)%, (83.3±2.4)%, (24.7±2.6) points respectively; and in the control group, FEV1, PEF, asthma control score were (84.4±2.)%, (82.2±1.9)%, (21.1±1.3) points respectively. The indicators in the study group were higher than those in the control group (3.62, 1.97, 6.64, 0.05). After 6 months of follow-up, FEV1, PEF, asthma control score in the study group were (88.4±2.3)%, (85.4±2.2)%, (26.8±1.8) points respectively; and in the control group, FEV1, PEF, asthma control score were (85.±1.9)%, (83.2±1.7)%, (22.±1.4) points respectively. The indicators in the study group were significantly higher than those in the control group (.34, 4.24, 10.41, 0.05). During the 6-month follow up, the number of emergency visits of asthma attacks in the study group and in the control group were 0.42(0.36, 0.51) and 0.92(0.72, 1.27) respectively. The indicator in the study group was significantly lower than that in the control group (3.21, 0.05). After 3 months of follow-up, the proportions of children with good compliance in the study group and control group were 67% (20/30) and 62% (18/29), the proportions of poor compliance were 27% (8/30) and 34% (10/29), the proportions of non-compliance were 7% (2/30) and 7% (2/29). There were no statistically significant differences (χ(2)=0.14, 0.43, 0.00, 0.71, 0.51, 0.97). After 6 months of follow-up, the proportions of children with good compliance in the study group and control group were 87% (26/30) and 69% (20/29), the proportion of poor compliance were 10% (3/30) and 28% (8/29), the proportion of non-compliance were 3% (1/30) and 7% (2/29), There were no statistically significant differences (χ(2)=2.70, 3.00, 0.39, 0.10, 0.08, 0.53). After 6 months of follow-up, the number of great satisfaction, satisfaction and dissatisfaction in the study group were 20, 10 and 0 respectively, the satisfaction rate was 100%, meanwhile those indicators in the control group were 4, 15 and 10 respectively, the satisfaction rate was 66%, The indicator in the study group was significantly higher than that in the control group (4.60, 0.05).  The application of "five-in-one" asthma management model (standardized asthma treatment, asthma diary, PEF monitoring, reasonable diet and physical exercise) for school-age children with asthma can significantly improve lung function, as well as reduce the number of acute asthma attacks. It has a high parent satisfaction, therefore it should be recommended for clinical implementation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672669>Factors Mediating Type 2 Diabetes Remission and Relapse after Gastric Bypass Surgery.</a></h1><p>Defining factors associated with remission and relapse of type 2 diabetes (T2D) after gastric bypass (RYGB) may allow targeting modifiable factors. We investigated factors associated with T2D remission and relapse after RYGB.Retrospective review of consecutive patients with T2D who underwent RYGB between 1993 and 2017. T2D remission was defined as medications discontinuation and/or HbA1c<6.%; relapse was defined as recurrent medication use and/or HbA1c≥6.%. Independent correlates of T2D remission and relapse were identified using logistic regression.621 patients (aged 46.7±10.6 years; 30% on insulin; BMI 49.8±8.3 kg/m) had at least one-year follow-up. Median follow-up was 4.9 (range 1-23.6) years. Prevalence of T2D remission was 74% at one year, 73% from one to three years, 63% between 3 and 10 years, and 47% beyond 10 years. 93% of remissions occurred within 3 years of RYGB, 25% relapsed. The median (IQR) time to relapse was .3 (3-7.8) years after remission. Higher one-year percentage total  (%TBW) loss, lack of preoperative insulin use, and younger age at surgery were independently associated with T2D remission. Preoperative insulin use, lower %TBW loss at one year, and greater %TBW gain after one year were independently associated with T2D relapse.This longitudinal retrospective analysis shows that preoperative insulin use and age, one-year  loss, and regain after that influence T2D remission and relapse following RYGB. Referring patients at a younger age, before insulin is needed, and optimizing both  loss and  maintenance after RYGB may improve the rates and durability of T2D remission.Copyright © 2019.

Using accelerometry to develop a better understanding of the complex gait of these agile canines may help to eliminate injury contributing factors. This study used a single Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) equipped with a tri-axial accelerometer to characterise the galloping of thirty-one greyhounds on five different race tracks. The dorsal-ventral and anterior-posterior accelerations were analysed in both the time and frequency domains. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) and Morlet wavelet transform were applied to signals. The time-domain signals were synced with the corresponding high frame rate videos of the race. It was observed that the acceleration peaks in the dorsal-ventral accelerations correspond to the hind-leg strikes which were noted to be fifteen times the greyhound's . The FFT analysis showed that the stride frequencies in all tracks were around 3. Hz. The Morlet wavelet analysis also showed a reduction in both the frequency and magnitude of signals, which suggests a speed reduction throughout the race. Also, by detecting abrupt changes along the track, the wavelet analysis highlighted potentially hazardous locations on the track. In conclusion, the methods applied in this research contribute to animal safety and welfare by eliminating the factors leading to injuries through optimising the track design and surface type.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658724>Valorization of Red Grape Pomace Waste Using Polyethylene Glycol and Fibrolytic Enzymes: Physiological and Meat Quality Responses in Broilers.</a></h1><p>The amount of grape pomace (GP) waste that can be included as a functional feed in broiler diets is limited by anti-nutritional compounds such as fiber and condensed tannins. This study evaluated the effect of pre-treating GP with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and a cellulolytic enzyme mixture on physiological and meat quality parameters of broilers. Cobb 500 broilers (249.2 ± 20.31 g live-) were reared on five isoenergetic and isonitrogenous diets: 1. Commercial chicken diet (CON); 2. CON containing untreated GP at 100 g/kg (dGP); 3. CON containing 100 g/kg GP pre-treated with PEG (50 g/kg) (dPEG); 4. CON containing 100 g/kg GP pre-treated with enzyme (1 g/kg) (ENZ); and . CON containing 100 g/kg GP pre-treated with PEG (50 g/kg) and enzyme (1 g/kg) (PENZ). Overall  gains were similar in broilers reared on the CON, dPEG, ENZ and PENZ diets but lower in dGP chickens. The meat of birds reared on dPEG, ENZ, dGP and CON had a similar water-holding capacity, which was lower than in PENZ chickens. Diets influenced the size of duodenum, ileum, jejunum and caeca. Polyethylene glycol treatment promoted similar  gains and hot carcass  as the commercial control diet, suggesting that the anti-nutritional effects of condensed tannins were successfully ameliorated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666147>LIFE BEEF CARBON: a common framework for quantifying grass and corn based beef farms' carbon footprints.</a></h1><p>Europe's roadmap to a low-carbon economy aims to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. Beef production is an important source of GHG emissions and is expected to increase as the world population grows. LIFE BEEF CARBON is a voluntary European initiative that aims to reduce GHG emissions per unit of beef (carbon footprint) by 15% over a 10-year period on 2172 farms in four large beef-producing countries. Changes in farms beef carbon footprint are normally estimated via simulation modelling, but the methods current models apply differ. Thus, our initial goal was to develop a common modelling framework to estimate beef farms carbon footprint. The framework was developed for a diverse set of Western Europe farms located in Ireland, Spain, Italy and France. Whole farm and life cycle assessment (LCA) models were selected to quantify emissions for the different production contexts and harmonized. Carbon Audit was chosen for Ireland, Bovid-CO2 for Spain and CAP'2ER for France and Italy. All models were tested using 20 case study farms, that is,  per country and quantified GHG emissions associated with on-farm live  gain. The comparison showed the ranking of beef systems gross carbon footprint was consistent across the three models. Suckler to weaning or store systems generally had the highest carbon footprint followed by suckler to beef systems and fattening beef systems. When applied to the same farm, Carbon Audit's footprint estimates were slightly lower than CAP'2ER, but marginally higher than Bovid-CO2. These differences occurred because the models were adapted to a specific region's production circumstances, which meant their emission factors for key sources; that is, methane from enteric fermentation and GHG emissions from concentrates were less accurate when used outside their target region. Thus, for the common modelling framework, region-specific LCA models were chosen to estimate beef carbon footprints instead of a single generic model. Additionally, the Carbon Audit and Bovid-CO2 models were updated to include carbon removal by soil and other environmental metrics included in CAP'2ER, for example, acidification. This allows all models to assess the effect carbon mitigation strategies have on other potential pollutants. Several options were identified to reduce beef farms carbon footprint, for example, improving genetic merit. These options were assessed for beef systems, and a mitigation plan was created by each nation. The cumulative mitigation effect of the LIFE BEEF CARBON plan was estimated to exceed the projects reduction target (-15%).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668383>Metformin prevents the pathological browning of subcutaneous white adipose tissue.</a></h1><p>Browning, the conversion of white adipose tissue (WAT) to a beige phenotype, has gained interest as a strategy to induce  loss and improve insulin resistance in metabolic disorders. However, for hypermetabolic conditions stemming from burn trauma or cancer cachexia, browning is thought to contribute to energy wasting and supraphysiological nutritional requirements. Metformin's impact on this phenomenon and underlying mechanisms have not been explored.We used both a murine burn model and human ex vivo adipose explants to assess metformin and -aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR)'s effects on the development of subcutaneous beige adipose. Enzymes involved in fat homeostasis and browning, as well as mitochondrial dynamics, were assessed to determine metformin's effects.Treatment with the biguanide metformin lowers lipolysis in beige fat by inducing protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) independently of adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) activation. Increased PP2A activity catalyzes the dephosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Ser 79) and hormone sensitive lipase (Ser 660), thus promoting fat storage and the "whitening" of otherwise lipolytic beige adipocytes. Moreover, co-incubation of metformin with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid countered the anti-lipolytic effects of this biguanide in human adipose. Additionally, we show that metformin does not activate this pathway in the WAT of control mice and that AICAR sustains the browning of white adipose, offering further evidence that metformin acts independently of this cellular energy sensor.This work provides novel insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of metformin's therapeutic benefits and potential as an agent to reduce the lipotoxicity associated with hypermetabolism and adipose browning.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

However, data are limited and conflicting regarding the consequences of changes in  fat distribution. The main aims of this paper are to investigate the association between changes in waist circumference (WC) and all-cause and CVD mortality and to examine these changes in relation to concurrent changes in .The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC-Norfolk) study recruited 25,639 participants between 1993 and 1997, aged 39-79, a number of whom also attended a second examination (1998-2000), and were followed up to 2016 for mortality. Participants were eligible for inclusion if they had WC,  and height measurements at both time-points; those with a self-reported history of CVD or cancer,  mass index < 18. kg/m2 or missing data on covariates were excluded, leaving 12,337 participants for analyses. The median (IQR) follow-up time was 16.4 (15.7, 17.2) years. Hazard Ratios (HRs) for all-cause (2866 deaths) and CVD mortality (822 deaths), by categories of WC change, were determined using Cox proportional hazards analyses.After multivariable adjustment, the HRs (95% CIs) for all-cause mortality for men and women with a WC gain (WCG) >   cm were 1.51 (1.29-1.75) and 1.25 (1.06-1.46) respectively. For CVD mortality in men and women with a WCG >   cm, the HRs were 1.84 (1.39-2.43) and 1.15 (0.85-1.55) respectively. In analyses of concurrent changes in WC and , the greatest risk (HRs) (95% CIs) in men occurred with  loss and WCG: 1.80 (1.13-2.86) for all-cause and 2.22 (1.03-4.82) for CVD mortality. In women, the greatest risk for both all-cause (HR 1.50 (1.16-1.95)) and CVD mortality (HR 1.81 (1.15-2.85)) was observed in those with  loss and maintenance of WC (WCM).Objectively measured WCG >  cm, was associated with subsequent higher total mortality risk and higher CVD mortality risk in men.

Previous studies have suggested that there is an increased risk of fracture in gastric cancer survivors. However, these studies were performed without proper control groups. Therefore, we used Korean national health insurance data to compare the fracture risk in gastric cancer survivors who received gastrectomy to that of the general population.A total of 133,179 gastric cancer survivors were included and matched to noncancer controls using 1:1 propensity score matching. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to determine the relative risk of fracture between the gastric cancer survivors and matched controls. We also examined the factors associated with fracture in gastric cancer survivors.Compared with the matched controls, gastric cancer survivors had an elevated risk of osteoporotic fracture (hazard ratio [HR] 1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.53-1.70), which was most prominent in patients who underwent total gastrectomy (HR 2.18, 95% CI 1.96-2.44) and adjuvant chemotherapy (HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.81-2.23). In multivariate analysis, anemia was significantly associated with increased fracture risk (aHR 1.34, 95% CI 1.13-1.59), while decrease in  >% was not (aHR 1.06, 95% CI 0.89-1.25).Gastric cancer survivors who underwent gastrectomy had an increased osteoporotic fracture risk than did matched controls. Total gastrectomy, adjuvant chemotherapy, and anemia were associated with an even higher risk in these patients. Additional studies are needed to establish optimal strategies, such as screening for osteoporosis and preventive interventions, that will reduce fracture risk in this population.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668975>Characteristics of newly diagnosed adults with type 1 diabetes in the UK and evolution of glycaemic control,  mass index and Charlson comorbidity index over the first  years after diagnosis.</a></h1><p>This retrospective, longitudinal study characterised 2430 adults (mean age 40.8±16.1years) with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes (T1D) over the first 5years of insulin treatment.Data from 1year pre- and up to  years post-insulin initiation were extracted from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (1990-2013).

The affected individuals represent a notable reduction in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content, which leads to malfunction of the components of the respiratory chain. MDS is classified according to the type of affected tissue; the most common type is hepatocerebral form, which is attributed to mutations in nuclear genes such as DGUOK and MPV17. These two genes encode mitochondrial proteins and play major roles in mtDNA synthesis.In this investigation patients in three families affected by hepatocerebral form of MDS who were initially diagnosed with tyrosinemia underwent full clinical evaluation. Furthermore, the causative mutations were identified using next generation sequencing and were subsequently validated using sanger sequencing. The effect of the mutations on the gene expression was also studied using real-time PCR. A pathogenic heterozygous frameshift deletion mutation in DGUOK gene was identified in parents of two affected patients (c.706-707 + 2 del: p.k236 fs) presenting with jaundice, impaired fetal growth, low-birth , and failure to thrive who died at the age of 3 and 6 months in family I. Moreover, a novel splice site mutation in MPV17 gene (c.461 + 1G > C) was identified in a patient with jaundice, muscle weakness, and failure to thrive who died due to hepatic failure at the age of 4 months. A -month-old infant presenting with jaundice, dark urine, poor sucking, and feeding problems was also identified to have another novel mutation in MPV17 gene leading to stop gain mutation (c.277C > T: p.(Gln93*)).These patients had overlapping clinical features with tyrosinemia.

Data collected included demographics, ventilatory modes, extubation data, and presence of complications. Infants extubated to either CPAP or NIV were compared using Wilcoxon rank- sum and Chi-square tests, and data were corrected using logistic regression models. Data are presented as medians.A total of 120 infants were included, of whom 62% were extubated to NIV. The incidence of BPD was significantly lower in the CPAP group vs NIV (57% vs. 78%, p = 0.011). Infants in the CPAP group were heavier (birth  (BWT) of 833 vs 724 grams, p = 0.005), more mature (gestation age (GA) 27 vs 25 weeks, p <  0.001) and were extubated significantly earlier (2 vs 8 days, p <  0.001). After adjusting for BWT and GA, NIV continued to be significantly associated with higher incidence of BPD among those extubated on the first day of life (odds ratio .9; 95% CI: 1.2-29.1, p = 0.029).This study concludes that, as compared to CPAP, early use of NIV is associated with higher risk of BPD in ELBW infants.

Obesity aggravates symptoms of SLE; however, these symptoms can be improved by  loss through diet therapy and bariatric surgery. However, there are only a few reports regarding the effectiveness of bariatric surgery in obese patients with SLE. Herein, we discuss the laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) performed in an obese patient with SLE while undergoing long-term steroid therapy.A 36-year-old female, suffering from SLE for 10 years with effects on the central nervous system, developed diabetes mellitus (DM) triggered by the steroid therapy for SLE. The patient was undergoing steroid therapy (6 mg/day) for SLE since a long time. For DM management, her HbA1c level was maintained at 7.4%. She was 158 cm tall and 91.6 kg in . Her  mass index was 36.7. She could not work and depended on welfare services. To improve her obesity and DM, physicians suggested that she should undergo bariatric surgery in our hospital. Eventually, she underwent LSG, which lasted for 185 min, with minimal blood loss and without complications. Her blood glucose level stabilized immediately after the surgery; hence, her antidiabetic medication was discontinued. She was discharged 8 days after surgery, and her  decreased steadily. In the first year after surgery, her  was 54.4 kg, and she had lost approximately 37 kg from her initial . Her steroid requirement had also reduced to 4 mg/day. Through  loss, she could begin to work and became a part of society again.LSG was safely performed in an obese patient with SLE undergoing long-term steroid therapy. We noted substantial  loss, improved DM condition, and reduced requirement of SLE therapy after surgery. Hence, surgical risks must be carefully examined before patients undergo bariatric surgery.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659983>The Obesity Paradox Revisited:  Mass Index and Long-Term Outcomes After PCI From a Large Pooled Patient-Level Database.</a></h1><p>To evaluate the relationship between  mass index (BMI) and outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous revascularization.In 13 randomized trials 22,922 patients were stratified (in kg/m2) as underweight (BMI &lt;18.), normal  (18.≤BMI&lt;25, used as reference), overweight (25≤BMI&lt;30), and obese (Class I [30≤BMI&lt;35], Class II [35≤BMI&lt;40], or Class III [BMI≥40]). The primary endpoint was all-cause death at  years. Secondary endpoints were cardiac and non-cardiac death, target (TLR) and non-target lesion revascularization (NTLR), myocardial infarction (MI), and definite/probable stent thrombosis. Despite adjustment for multiple confounders, overweight and Class I obesity were associated with lower all-cause mortality vs normal  (HR 0.83; 95%CI 0.71-0.96 and HR 0.83; 95%CI 0.69-0.96 respectively); however, non-cardiac death was the major contributor to this effect (HR 0.77; 95% CI 0.63-0.94 for overweight). Conversely, cardiac mortality was higher in severely obese individuals (HR 1.62; 95%CI 1.05-2.51 for Class III obesity).

The antibacterial, antibiofilm and in vitro cytotoxicity activity of the OsSNPs was determined. Surface Plasmon Resonance peak was at 500 nm. Functional groups such as hydroxyl; alcohol, phosphate, and amine among others were responsible for the capping and stabilization of proteins in the nanoparticles. The OsSNPs were spherical with size of 10 nm and are thermostable to an extent without totally losing its . EDX analysis revealed a strong signal of silver element. DLS shows the particle diameter average of 0.000 nm and 558.1 nm with a polydispersity index of 0.580. The OsSNPs had effective antibacterial activity against the test bacterial pathogens with zone of inhibition ranged from 1 - 21 mm. OsSNPs exhibited strong antibiofilm activity. However, the toxicity of the OsSNPs to  (brine shrimp) was observed to be insignificant with the highest mortality at 4000 μg/mL and lethal dose (LC) of 2630.3 μg/mL. Greenly synthesized OsSNPs had effective antibacterial potency and low cytotoxicity which suggests its use in biomedical and pharmacological applications.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668708>Diagnostic laparoscopy is more accurate than Computerized Tomography for internal hernia after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.</a></h1><p>Internal hernia rate after Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) is variable (0.%-9%).We retrospectively reviewed all patients who underwent diagnostic laparoscopy for possible internal hernia after RYGB from 2009 to 2016.

Diagnostic laparoscopies after RYGB done at our institution showed internal hernia in 3/6 (50%), none at Petersen space, none had incarcerated small bowel or were converted to open. While 20/27 (74%) of diagnostic laparoscopies after RYGB done at outside institutions had an internal hernia, 18/20 (90%) at Petersen space, 15/27 (55%) had incarcerated small bowel and 3.7% needed small bowel resection or were converted to open. Our internal hernia rate after RYGB was 0.%. Computerized Tomography (CT scan) was falsely negative in 44-50% of patients with laparoscopy after RYGB.Diagnostic laparoscopy is more accurate than CT scan in evaluating patients with abdominal pain after RYGB.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We have previously shown beneficial effects of fermented green tea with Aquilariae Lignum (fGT) via an oral route in diabetic and obese models. Thus, the toxicological safety of fGT was assessed at limited oral doses for a rodent. Mice or rats of both genders were orally administered distilled water as a control and fGT at 2.0, 1.0, and 0. g/kg. There were no mortalities or gross abnormalities in the fGT groups for 2 weeks following the single oral dose in mice. No fGT-relevant abnormalities were found in postmortem and histopathological examinations, suggesting LD of fGT at more than 2.0 g/kg with no specific target organs. There were also no fGT-relevant mortalities or abnormal signs in the repeated oral dose for 13 weeks in rats. In the fGT groups, no  changes or daily metabolic changes were found, and hematological and serum biochemical ranges were normal. The postmortem and histopathological examinations revealed few fGT-related abnormalities in most of the organs including the liver, although slight lymphoid cell hyperplasia in the lymph node was observed in a few rats with fGT at 2.0 g/kg. This may be secondary to increased immune response to the highest dose because there were no histopathological lesions or organ  changes. It suggests nontoxic safety of fGT at up to 2.0 g/kg, which provides useful information for clinical use.Copyright © 2019 Sol Lee et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669947>Qualitative in vitro study on the degradation of mineral complexes in vegetables.</a></h1><p>Mechanisms of degradation and absorption of mineral complexes by the human digestive system are complex and still under investigation. The elaborate matrix of vegetables, and the presence of phytates and other inhibitors make study of these mechanisms difficult. In this qualitative study, extracts from freeze-dried savoy cabbage, broccoli, kale and spinach were subjected to digestion in vitro at pH 2.0 and pH 7. and analysed using SEC-ICP-MS. The results suggest that low molecular  species (peak 6), related to the iron and zinc fractions, which appeared after acidic digestion in all vegetables, except in kale, were considerably reduced after digestion at pH 7.. Low molecular  species (peak 9), related to the phosphorus fraction, were present in all vegetables, except in kale, after alkaline digestion.

We present a simple, low-cost method for the sensitive and efficient extraction from soil of thiamethoxam, clothianidin and imidacloprid, the three neonicotinoid insecticides approved in New Zealand as seed coatings. We have validated this method by applying it to uncontaminated soil samples spiked with environmentally relevant concentrations of the three targets. Absolute recoveries were >80% with instrument detection limits <1 ng g wet soil. We also applied the method to soil samples collected from maize fields in New Zealand's North Island and found imidacloprid in 43 out of 45 samples and clothianidin in every one. Mean imidacloprid concentrations varied from 0. to 9.4 ng g (wet ) and clothianidin from 2.1 to 26.7 ng g (wet ). Imidacloprid concentrations exceed the New Zealand Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Exposure Limit of 1 ng g (dry ) at eight of the nine sites sampled. These results are remarkable because we have detected multiple neonicotinoid residues at every site sampled. Imidacloprid residues appear to persist at significant concentrations at five of our sites from an application at least two years previously. This is only the third study to report the presence of neonicotinoid residues in NZ's environment and the first to show that those residues are persistent in the environment at nominally hazardous concentrations.Copyright © 2019.

This was a randomised controlled trial included 114 women with placenta praevia (between 24 and 28 weeks). They were randomly assigned to group I (17α-OHP-C) who received weekly injection of 17α-OHP-C (250 mg/IM) till completing 37 weeks' gestation or group II (Non 17α-OHP-C). The percentage of placenta praevia patients went into PTD in the 17α-OHP-C group was significantly less in comparison to the PTD in the Non 17α-OHP-C group (∼37%  63.%,  = .004). Furthermore, the mean gestational age was significantly longer (36.7 ± 0.7  34.9 ± 1.2 weeks,  < .000), the mean number of bleeding attacks was significantly less and the mean birth  was significantly higher (2841 ± 159  2561 ± 168 g,  < .000). In conclusion, maintenance tocolysis with intramuscular 17α-OHP-C in placenta praevia women appears beneficial in decreasing the number of bleeding attacks, the percentage of PTD and the neonatal ICU admission.IMPACT STATEMENT Over the last two decades, a large number of studies indicated that placenta praevia is a major risk factor for preterm labour and prematurity with its neonatal complications. Increasing caesarean section rates had proportionally increased the incidence of placenta praevia. Up to now, the effective and safe tocolytic agent among these patients is not established. The results of this study (prospective, randomised and controlled with calculated sample size) added a considerable support for hydroxyprogesterone caproate as an effective, safe and cheap tocolytic agent with excellent patient compliance. Our findings may prompt researchers to conduct a large multicentre study to evaluate the prophylactic use of hydroxyprogesterone caproate to decrease preterm labour due to placenta praevia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668669>Early prenatal exposure to suspected endocrine disruptor mixtures is associated with lower IQ at age seven.</a></h1><p>Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are xenobiotics with the ability to interfere with hormone action, even at low levels. Prior environmental epidemiology studies link numerous suspected EDCs, including phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA), to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, results for some chemicals were inconsistent and most assessed one chemical at a time.To evaluate the overall impact of prenatal exposure to an EDC mixture on neurodevelopment in school-aged children, and identify chemicals of concern while accounting for co-exposures.Among 718 mother-child pairs from the Swedish Environmental Longitudinal, Mother and child, Asthma and allergy study (SELMA) study, we used Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression to assess the association between 26 EDCs measured in 1st trimester urine or blood, with Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (IV) Intelligence Quotient (IQ) scores at age 7 years. Models were adjusted for child sex, gestational age, mother's education, mother's IQ (RAVEN), , and smoking status. To evaluate generalizability, we conducted repeated holdout validation, a machine learning technique.Using repeated holdout validation, IQ scores were 1.9-points (CI = -3.6, -0.2) lower among boys for an inter-quartile-range (IQR) change in the WQS index. BPF made the largest contribution to the index with a  of 14%. Other chemicals of concern and their  included PBA (9%), TCP (9%), MEP (6%), MBzP (4%), PFOA (6%), PFOS (%), PFHxS (4%), Triclosan (%), and BPA (4%). While we did observe an inverse association between EDCs and IQ among all children when training and testing the WQS index estimate on the full dataset, these results were not robust to repeated holdout validation.Among boys, early prenatal exposure to EDCs was associated with lower intellectual functioning at age 7. We identified bisphenol F as the primary chemical of concern, suggesting that the BPA replacement compound may not be any safer for children. Future studies are needed to confirm the potential neurotoxicity of replacement analogues.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the placenta in MCLR-induced significant reduction in fetal , especially the changes in placental structure and function. Pregnant mice were intraperitoneally injected with MCLR ( or 20 μg/kg) from gestational day (GD) 13 to GD17. The results showed MCLR reduced fetal  and placenta . The histological specimens of the placentas were taken for light and electron microscopy studies. The internal space of blood vessels decreased obviously in the placental labyrinth layer of mice treated with MCLR. After the ultrastructural examination, the edema and intracytoplasmic vacuolization, dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum and corrugation of the nucleus were observed. In addition, maternal MCLR exposure caused a reduction of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD11B2) expression in placentae, a critical regulator of fetal development. Several genes of placental growth factors, such as Vegfα and Pgf and several genes of nutrient transport pumps, such as Glut1 and Pcft were depressed in placentas of MCLR-treated mice, however nutrient transporters Fatp1 and Snat4 were promoted. Moreover, significant increases in malondialdehyde (MDA) revealed the occurrence of oxidative stress caused by MCLR, which was also verified by remarkable decrease in the glutathione levels, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) as well as the activity of antioxidant enzymes. Real-time PCR and western blot analysis revealed that GRP78, CHOP, XBP-1, peIF2α and pIRE1 were remarkable increased in placentas of MCLR-treated mice, indicating that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway was activated by MCLR. Furthermore, oxidative stress and ER stress consequently triggered apoptosis which contributed to the impairment of placental development. Collectively, these results suggest maternal MCLR exposure results in reduced fetal , which might be associated with ROS-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress and impairment in placental structure and function.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Biomolecules exhibit a wide range of functions and structures, including chemical recognition (of enzyme substrates or adhesive ligands, for instance), exquisite nanostructures (composed of peptides, proteins or nucleic acids), and unusual mechanical properties (such as silk-like strength, stiffness, viscoelasticity and resiliency). Here we combine the computational design of physical (noncovalent) interactions with pathway-dependent, hierarchical 'click' covalent assembly to produce hybrid synthetic peptide-based polymers. The nanometre-scale monomeric units of these polymers are homotetrameric, α-helical bundles of low-molecular- peptides. These bundled monomers, or 'bundlemers', can be designed to provide complete control of the stability, size and spatial display of chemical functionalities. The protein-like structure of the bundle allows precise positioning of covalent linkages between the ends of distinct bundlemers, resulting in polymers with interesting and controllable physical characteristics, such as rigid rods, semiflexible or kinked chains, and thermally responsive hydrogel networks. Chain stiffness can be controlled by varying only the linkage. Furthermore, by controlling the amino acid sequence along the bundlemer periphery, we use specific amino acid side chains, including non-natural 'click' chemistry functionalities, to conjugate moieties into a desired pattern, enabling the creation of a wide variety of hybrid nanomaterials.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661063>The association of smoking with ultrasound-measured kidney dimensions .</a></h1><p>Ultrasound is considered a preferred first-line imaging technique for the assessment of kidney function. The potential relationship between tobacco smoke exposure and ultrasound-measured renal characteristics has yet to be explored. We hypothesized that exposure to tobacco smoke would be associated with reduced kidney dimensions.This was a cross-sectional study that included all individuals over age 18 at a single site in Mojokerto, Indonesia. A questionnaire was used to assess prior history and environmental exposure, and blinded evaluators performed ultrasound assessments. Six kidney parameters (length, width, and parenchymal thickness of each kidney) were considered as dependent variables, and statistical relationships were assessed using multivariate analysis. Echogenicity was evaluated using a -point grading scale described previously.Of the 445 participants assessed, a total of 138 male and 269 female subjects were included in the final analysis. There was a statistically significant association between kidney  and the following independent variables: pack years smoking (p < 0.001), height (p < 0.001),  (p < 0.001), and beginning to smoke at the age of 25 or younger (p < 0.001). There was not a statistically significant association between kidney  and hypertension (p > 0.05) or diabetes (p > 0.05). Echogenicity was similar among all smoking groups.Kidney dimensions were decreased in individuals with increased smoking history. This association is notable, particularly given that statistically significant associations were not observed between renal dimensions and hypertension or diabetes. The null findings using echogenicity are consistent with previous studies. .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668721>A randomized, controlled, double-blind crossover study on the effects of isoeffective and isovolumetric intravenous crystalloid and gelatin on blood volume, and renal and cardiac hemodynamics.</a></h1><p>Blood volume expanding properties of colloids are superior to crystalloids.

Participants were studied over 240 min. Changes in blood volume were calculated from changes in  and hematocrit. Renal volume, renal artery blood flow (RABF), renal cortex perfusion and diffusion, and cardiac index were measured with magnetic resonance imaging.Ten of 12 males [mean (SE) age 23.9 (0.8) years] recruited, completed the study. Increase in  and extracellular fluid volume were significantly less after infusion B than infusions A and C, but changes in blood volume did not significantly differ between infusions. All infusions increased renal volume, with no significant differences between infusions. There was no significant difference in RABF across the infusion time course or between infusion types. Renal cortex perfusion decreased during the infusion (mean 18% decrease from baseline), with no significant difference between infusions. There was a trend for increased renal cortex diffusion (4.2% increase from baseline) for the crystalloid infusion. All infusions led to significant increases in cardiac index.A smaller volume of colloid (4% succinylated gelatin) was as effective as a larger volume of crystalloid at expanding blood volume, increasing cardiac output and changing renal function.

A total of 101 postmenopausal women, aged 45 to 65 years with  mass index (calculated as  in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) from 30 to 40, who were at least  years after menopause, had fewer than 3 hours of structured physical activity per week, and lived in the Sydney metropolitan area of New South Wales, Australia, were recruited between March 2013 and July 2016. Data analysis was conducted between October 2018 and August 2019.Participants were randomized to either 12 months of moderate (25%-35%) energy restriction with a food-based diet (moderate intervention) or 4 months of severe (65%-75%) energy restriction with a total meal replacement diet followed by moderate energy restriction for an additional 8 months (severe intervention). Both interventions had a prescribed protein intake of 1.0 g/kg of actual  per day, and physical activity was encouraged but not supervised.The primary outcome was whole- lean mass at 12 months after commencement of intervention. Secondary outcomes were , thigh muscle area and muscle function (strength), bone mineral density, and fat mass and distribution, measured at 0, 4, 6, and 12 months.A total of 101 postmenopausal women were recruited (mean [SD] age, 58.0 [4.2] years; mean [SD] , 90.8 [9.1] kg; mean [SD]  mass index, 34.4 [2.]). Compared with the moderate group at 12 months, the severe group lost more  (effect size, -6.6 kg; 95% CI, -8.2 to -.1 kg), lost more whole- lean mass (effect size, -1.2 kg; 95% CI, -2.0 to -0.4 kg), and lost more thigh muscle area (effect size, -4.2 cm2; 95% CI, -6. to -1.9 cm2). However, decreases in whole- lean mass and thigh muscle area were proportional to total  loss, and there was no difference in muscle (handgrip) strength between groups. Total hip bone mineral density (effect size, -0.017 g/cm2; 95% CI, -0.029 to -0.005 g/cm2), whole- fat mass (effect size, -. kg; 95% CI, -7.1 to -3.9 kg), abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (effect size, -1890 cm3; 95% CI, -2560 to -1219 cm3), and visceral adipose tissue (effect size, -1389 cm3; 95% CI, -1748 to -1030 cm3) loss were also greater for the severe group than for the moderate group at 12 months.Severe energy restriction had no greater adverse effect on relative whole- lean mass or handgrip strength compared with moderate energy restriction and was associated with 2-fold greater  and fat loss over 12 months. However, there was significantly greater loss of total hip bone mineral density with severe vs moderate energy restriction.

Compared with the reported air filters, the resultant membrane (Ag@STPNM) with high surface polarity and the porous structure possessed the low density, high removal efficiency, and small pressure drop. For instance, the removal efficiency and the pressure drop of Ag@STPNM with basis  of only 3.9 g·m-2 for PM2. reached to 98.84% and 59 Pa, respectively. In terms of the excellent thermal stability of Ag@STPNM, the adsorbed PMs could be removed simply by a calcination process. The filtration performance of Ag@STPNM kept stable during five purification-regeneration cycles, and the long-time filtration for 12 h, exhibiting excellent recyclability and durability. Furthermore, the embedded Ag nanoparticles could achieve the effective resistance to the breeding of bacteria on Ag@STPNM, giving the bacteriostatic rate of 95.8%. Therefore, Ag@STPNM holds promising potentials as a highly efficient, reusable, and antibacterial air filter in the practical purification of indoor environment or personal air.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673504>Safety evaluation of calcium L-methylfolate.</a></h1><p>Calcium L-methylfolate (L--MTHF-Ca; CAS Number 151533-22-1) is a source of folate and an alternative to folic acid for use in human food and food supplements. The safety of L--MTHF-Ca was evaluated by testing for genotoxicity, subchronic and prenatal developmental toxicity. In  assays L--MTHF-Ca was not mutagenic and did not induce other chromosomal events. Additionally, L--MTHF-Ca was not genotoxic in the  micronucleus test nor did it induce DNA damage in rat liver cells. In a subchronic toxicity study, rats administered up to 400 mg/kg bw/day of L--MTHF-Ca  oral gavage for 13 weeks had no treatment-related mortalities, and no treatment-related effects were identified on behaviour, , food consumption, ophthalmology, haematology, or organ . No treatment-related macroscopic or histopathological findings were observed. Calcium and sodium levels increased with increasing dosage, however the slight increases were within historical control ranges and reversible after the recovery period. L--MTHF-Ca is neither teratogenic nor embryotoxic. Based on the results of the  and  studies, the safe use of L--MTHF-Ca as an ingredient in foods is supported. The no observed adverse effect level was the highest dose in the subchronic toxicity study,  400 mg/kg bw/day for male and female rats.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663298>Dietary intake of people with dementia on acute hospital wards.</a></h1><p>The aim of this service evaluation was to understand the factors affecting meal provision on a dementia ward and assess whether meals-based dietary intake met estimated mean energy requirement and reference nutrient intake (RNI). A mixed-methods approach was adopted: 1. Mapping the dietary intake for a cohort ( n =6) of inpatients with advanced dementia over a period of four consecutive days. 2. Semi-structured interviews to explore the experiences of the professionals ( n =) involved. Two of the participants' four-day mean intakes did not meet their estimated energy requirement based on meal provision. All participants apart from one met the target of 0.75g of protein per kg  per day for the general population. Several of the nutrients consumed were at or exceeded the RNI for adults of this age, although participants' mean dietary vitamin D intake was substantially below the RNI for the general population. The themes included communication, time pressure and the continuity of service provision. The meals provided were nutritionally sound. Individuals' nutritional status was improved through staff supporting them with eating. The contribution of drinks and snacks to nutrient intake warrants further exploration. Effective communication between food providers and ward areas is important. Mealtimes should reflect patient need - for example, having the main meal in the evening and a lighter option at lunch. This does not clash with the benefits of a flexible breakfast time.© 2019 RCN Publishing Company Ltd. All rights reserved.

The compositional analysis of heavy oil products has become a key step in conversion processes, but the complexity of these oil matrices tends to increase with their boiling point. In this study, comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LCxLC) coupled to inductively coupled mass spectrometry (ICP-MS/MS) is considered with a view to meet new requirements and to bring additional information regarding the species present in these matrices. In search for a high degree of orthogonality, two separation techniques involving two different retention mechanisms were evaluated: Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) and Reverse Phase Liquid Chromatography (RPLC). In SEC, the analytes are separated according to their molecular  while according to their hydrophobicity in RPLC. The separation power of both individual separation techniques was first evaluated. Off-line and on-line LCxLC were compared on the basis of an optimization approach. It is shown that off-line SECxRPLC can provide, for the same analysis time of 150 min, a higher peak capacity (2600 vs 1700) than on-line RPLCxSEC while a similar dilution factor (close to 30) but also requires far fewer fractions to be analyzed (12 vs 400). Asphaltenes which constitute the heaviest fraction of crude oils (obtained from petroleum industry) were analyzed by the developed off-line SECxRPLC method. The resulting 2D-contour plots show that co-elutions could be removed leading, for the first time, to new information on high molecular  species containing sulfur and vanadium.Copyright © 2019.

However, this practice may be unnecessarily burdensome and time-consuming in the research setting.The aim of the study was to evaluate the use of SS criteria, and compare it to alternative approaches in adults with overweight and obesity.In this cross-sectional, ancillary analysis, participants enrolled in a bariatric (study 1; n = 13) and lifestyle (study 2; n = 51)  loss intervention were included. Indirect calorimetry was performed during baseline measurements using a metabolic cart for 25 min, including a -min stabilization period at the start. SS was defined as the first -min period with a coefficient of variation (CV) ≤10% for both VO and VCO (hereafter REE).  composition was measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis in study 2 participants only. REE was compared against the lowest CV (REE), -min time intervals (REE, REE, REE, REE), 4-min and 3-min SS intervals (REE and REE), and time intervals of 6-15, 6-20 and 6-25 min (REE, REE, and REE) using repeated  ANOVA and Bland-Altman analysis to test for bias, limits of agreement and accuracy (±6% measured REE).Participants were 54 ± 13 years old, mostly women (75%) and had a BMI of 35 ±  kg/m. Overall, 54/63 (84%) of participants reached REE, often (47/54, 87%) within the first 10-min (6-15 min). Alternative approaches to estimating REE had a relatively low bias (-16 to 13 kcals), narrow limits of agreement and high accuracy (83-98%) when compared to REE, in particular, outperforming standard prediction equations (e.g., Mifflin St. Joer).Indirect calorimetry measurements that utilize the -min SS approach to estimate REE are considered the gold-standard. Under circumstances of non-SS, it appears 4-min and 3-min SS periods, or fixed time intervals of atleast  min are accurate and practical alternatives for estimating REE in adults with overweight and obesity. However, future trials should validate alternative methods in similar populations to confirm these findings.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Zinc is considered to be one of the promising biomaterials with respect to biodegradation rate and biocompatibility. However, no information regarding the biodegradability and biocompatibility of topologically ordered AM porous zinc is yet available. Here, we applied powder bed fusion to fabricate porous zinc with a topologically ordered diamond structure. An integrative study was conducted on the static and dynamic biodegradation behavior (in vitro, up to 4 weeks), evolution of mechanical properties with increasing immersion time, electrochemical performance, and biocompatibility of the AM porous zinc. The specimens lost 7.8% of their  after 4 weeks of dynamic immersion in a revised simulated  fluid. The mechanisms of biodegradation were site-dependent and differed from the top of the specimens to the bottom. During the whole in vitro immersion time of 4 weeks, the elastic modulus values of the AM porous zinc (E = 700-1000 MPa) even increased and remained within the scope of those of cancellous bone. Indirect cytotoxicity revealed good cellular activity up to 72 h according to ISO 10993- and -12. Live-dead staining confirmed good viability of MG-63 cells cultured on the surface of the AM porous zinc. These important findings could open up unprecedented opportunities for the development of multifunctional bone substituting materials that will enable reconstruction and regeneration of critical-size load-bearing bone defects. Statement of Significance No information regarding the biodegradability and biocompatibility of topologically ordered AM porous zinc is available. We applied selective laser melting to fabricate topologically ordered porous zinc and conducted a comprehensive study on the biodegradation behavior, electrochemical performance, time-dependent mechanical properties, and biocompatibility of the scaffolds. The specimens lost 7.8% of their  after 4 weeks dynamic biodegradation while their mechanical properties surprisingly increased after 4 weeks. Indirect cytotoxicity revealed good cellular activity up to 72 h. Intimate contact between MG-63 cells and the scaffolds was also observed. These important findings could open up unprecedented opportunities for the development of multifunctional bone substituting materials that mimic bone properties and enable full regeneration of critical-size load-bearing bony defects.Copyright © 2019.

HSUVs are used in economic evaluations to determine quality-adjusted life years or as a measure of disorder burden. The main objective of the current study is to present HSUVs for a broad range of EDs based on DSM- diagnoses.We used pooled data of two Health Omnibus Surveys (2015 and 2016) including representative samples of individuals aged 15 + years living in South Australia. HSUVs were derived from the SF-6D (based on the SF-12 health-related quality of life questionnaire) and analysed by ED classification, ED symptoms (frequency of binge-eating or distress associated to binge eating) and  status. Multiple linear regression models, adjusted for socio-demographics, were used to test the differences of HSUVs across ED groups.Overall, 18% of the 5609 individuals met criteria for ED threshold and subthreshold. EDs were associated with HSUV decrements, especially if they were severe disorders (compared to non-ED), binge ED: -0.16 (95% CI -0.19 to -0.13), bulimia nervosa: -0.12, (95% CI -0.16 to -0.08). There was an inverse relationship between distress related binge eating and HSUVs. HSUVs were lower among people with overweight/obese compared to those with healthy  regardless of ED diagnosis.EDs were significantly associated with lower HSUVs compared to people without such disorders. This study, therefore, provides new insights into the burden of EDs. The derived HSUVs can also be used to populate future economic models.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670196>Influence of Brevibacterium linens RS16 on foliage photosynthetic and volatile emission characteristics upon heat stress in Eucalyptus grandis.</a></h1><p>Heat stress induces secondary metabolic changes in plants, channeling photosynthetic carbon and energy, away from primary metabolic processes, including, growth. Use of ACC (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate) deaminase containing plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) in conferring heat resistance in plants and the role of PGPB, in altering net carbon assimilation, constitutive and stress volatile emissions has not been studied yet. We exposed leaves of Eucalyptus grandis inoculated and non-inoculated with PGPB Brevibacterium linens RS16 to two levels of heat stress (37 °C and 41 °C for  min) and quantified temporal changes in foliage photosynthetic characteristics and volatile emission rates at 0. h, day 1 and day  after the stress application. Heat stress resulted in immediate reductions in dark-adapted photosystem II (PSII) quantum yield (F/F), net assimilation rate (A), stomatal conductance to water vapor (g), and enhancement of stress volatile emissions, including enhanced emissions of green leaf volatiles (GLV), mono- and sesquiterpenes, light  oxygenated volatile organic compounds (LOC), geranyl-geranyl diphosphate pathway volatiles (GGDP), saturated aldehydes, and benzenoids, with partial recovery by day . Changes in stress-induced volatiles were always less in leaves inoculated with B. linens RS16. However, net assimilation rate was enhanced by bacterial inoculation only in the 37 °C treatment and overall reduction of isoprene emissions was observed in bacterially-treated leaves. Principal component analysis (PCA), correlation analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) indicated that different stress applications influenced specific volatile organic compounds. In addition, changes in the expression analysis of heat shock protein 70 gene (DnaK) gene in B. linens RS16 upon exposure to higher temperatures further indicated that B. linens RS16 has developed its own heat resistance mechanism to survive under higher temperature regimes. Taken together, this study demonstrates that foliar application of ACC deaminase containing PGPB can ameliorate heat stress effects in realistic biological settings.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Muscle force imbalance is the primary cause of such deformity. Many diseases can lead to muscle force imbalance, such as tethered cord syndrome, cerebral palsy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and trauma. At present, many surgical treatments are available for cavovarus foot. For older children, priority should be given to midfoot osteotomy and fusion. Since complications such as abnormal foot length, foot stiffness, and abnormal gait tend to develop postoperatively, it is important to preserve the joints and correct the deformity as much as possible. Adequate soft tissue release and muscle balance are the keys to correcting the deformity and avoiding its postoperative recurrence.To assess the efficacy of soft tissue release combined with joint-sparing osteotomy in the treatment of cavovarus foot deformity in older children.The clinical data of 21 older children with cavovarus foot deformity (28 feet) who were treated surgically at the Ninth Department of Orthopedics of Jizhong Energy Xingtai Mining Group General Hospital from November 2014 to July 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. The patients ranged in age from 10 to 14 years old, with an average age of 12.46 ± 1.20 years. Their main clinical manifestations were deformity, pain, and gait abnormality. The patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine, electromyographic examination, -bearing anteroposterior and lateral X-rays of the feet, and the Coleman block test. Surgical procedures including metatarsal fascia release, Achilles tendon or medial gastrocnemius lengthening, "V"-shaped osteotomy on the dorsal side of the metatarsal base, opening medial cuneiform wedge osteotomy, closing cuboid osteotomy, anterior transfer of the posterior tibial tendon, peroneus longus-to-brevis transfer, and calcaneal sliding osteotomy to correct hindfoot varus deformity were performed. After surgery, long leg plaster casts were applied, the plaster casts were removed 6 wk later, Kirschner wires were removed, and functional exercise was initiated. The patients began -bearing walk 3 mo after surgery. Therapeutic effects were evaluated using the Wicart grading system, and Meary's angles and Hibbs' angles were measured based on X-ray images obtained preoperatively and at last follow-up to assess their changes.The patients were followed for 6 to 32 mo, with an average follow-up period of 17.68 ± 6.290 mo. Bone healing at the osteotomy site was achieved at 3 mo in all cases. According to the Wicart grading system, very good results were achieved in 18 feet, good in 7, and fair in 3, with a very good/good rate of 89.3%. At last follow-up, mean Meary's angle was 6.36° ± 1.810°, and mean Hibbs' angle was 160.21° ± 4.167°, both of which were significantly improved compared with preoperative values (24.11° ± 2.948° and 135.86° ± .345°, respectively;  < 0.001 for both). No complications such as infection, skin necrosis, or bone nonunion occurred.Soft tissue release combined with joint-sparing osteotomy has appreciated efficacy in the treatment of cavovarus foot deformity in older children.©The Author(s) 2019.

EEG power spectra data were investigated in two conditions: (a)  min of resting state (RS) and (b)  min of RS after a single taste of a milkshake (ML-RS). EEG analyses were performed using exact Low-Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography software (eLORETA).Cluster analysis performed on the EDE-Q responses revealed a group of 17 women with high levels of ED pathology falling into the subclinical (i.e., sub-threshold) EDs category and a group of 20 women with low levels of ED pathology (controls). In the RS conditions, no significant modifications were observed between groups. Compared to controls, women with subclinical EDs showed an increase in theta activity in the parieto-occipital areas in the ML-RS condition. After controlling for  mass index and general psychopathology, theta activity in these brain structures was positively associated with EDE-Q global and subscale (restraint, shape and  concern) scores.Our results may reflect the neurophysiological substrate of ED psychopathology core features like shape/ concerns. Previous brain imaging and qEEG studies with full-syndrome ED patients also underscored the involvement of parieto-occipital areas in ED pathophysiology. These studies also found brain alterations in the RS condition, not observed here. This is notable given that full-syndrome and subclinical EDs are considered as different manifestations of the same disease along a severity spectrum.Level V, cross-sectional, electroencephalographic, descriptive study.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666482>Consumption of Low-Dose of Ethanol Suppresses Colon Tumorigenesis in 1,2-Dimethylhydrazine-Treated Rats.</a></h1><p>The effect of low-dose of ethanol consumption on the development of colon cancer is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of low-dose ethanol (0.%, 1%, and 2% [v/v] ethanol in drinking water) for 28 wk on colon tumor incidence in rats injected with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine. , fluid and food consumption, and the total numbers of colon adenomas (mild-, moderate-, and severe-grade dysplasia) per rat were unaffected by ethanol consumption. However, the numbers of severe-grade dysplasia were significantly reduced by 1% ethanol compared with the control (0% ethanol; -93%) but not by 0.% and 2% ethanol. Although the numbers of total adenocarcinomas were unaffected, those of total of adenomas and adenocarcinomas together were significantly reduced by 0.% and 1% ethanol (-39% and -41%, respectively). Intriguingly, real-time PCR assay indicated the abundance of cecal Clostridium leptum (a putative immunosuppressor) was the least in rats received 1% ethanol. Furthermore, 1% ethanol markedly increased colonic mRNA of IL-6, a putative suppressor of regulatory T-cells and cytoprotector. This study provides the first evidence for the potential of 1% ethanol, but not 2% ethanol, to prevent colon tumorigenesis in rats, supporting the J-curve hypothesis of the effect of low-dose alcohol on health. Further, the modulation of C. leptum and expression of IL-6, potentially linking to carcinogenesis, by 1% ethanol may provide an insight into the underlying mechanisms of the anti-colon tumor effect.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675159>Childhood Obesity and the Food Environment: A Population-Based Sample of Public School Children in New York City.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to examine the relationship between proximity to healthy and unhealthy food outlets around children's homes and their  outcomes.A total of 3,507,542 student-year observations of height and  data from the 2009-2013 annual FitnessGram assessment of New York City public school students were used. BMI z scores were calculated, student obesity or obesity/overweight was determined using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts, and these data were combined with the locations of four food outlet types (fast-food restaurants, wait-service restaurants, corner stores, and supermarkets) to calculate distance to the nearest outlet. Associations between  status outcomes and distance to these food outlet types were examined using neighborhood (census tract) fixed effects.Living farther than 0.025 mile (about half of a city block) from the nearest fast-food restaurant was associated with lower obesity and obesity/overweight risk and lower BMI z scores. Results ranged from 2.% to 4.4% decreased obesity. Beyond this distance, there were generally no impacts of the food environment and little to no impact of other food outlet types.Proximity to fast-food restaurants was inversely related to childhood obesity, but no relationships beyond that were seen. These findings can help better inform policies focused on food access, which could, in turn, reduce childhood obesity.© 2019 The Obesity Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666643>Empagliflozin and Dulaglutide are Effective against Obesity-induced Airway Hyperresponsiveness and Fibrosis in A Murine Model.</a></h1><p>Patients with asthma with obesity experience severe symptoms, are unresponsive to conventional asthma treatment, and lack proper pharmacotherapy. Empagliflozin and dulaglutide, developed for diabetes, reduce , decrease insulin resistance, and exert additive effects. We evaluated the efficacy of empagliflozin, dulaglutide, and their combination on obesity-induced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and lung fibrosis using a murine model. We assigned C57BL/6J mice to five groups: control, high-fat diet (HFD), and HFD with empagliflozin, dulaglutide, or both. Mice received a 12-week HFD, empagliflozin ( days/week, oral gavage), and dulaglutide (once weekly, intraperitoneally). Both drugs significantly attenuated HFD-induced  increase, abnormal glucose metabolism, and abnormal serum levels of leptin and insulin, and co-treatment was more effective. Both drugs significantly alleviated HFD-induced AHR, increased macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and co-treatment was more effective on AHR. HFD-induced lung fibrosis was decreased by both drugs alone and combined. HFD induced interleukin (IL)-17, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, and IL-1β mRNA and protein expression, which was significantly reduced by empagliflozin, dulaglutide, and their combination. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-6 showed similar patterns without significant differences. HFD-enhanced T helper (Th) 1 and Th17 cell differentiation was improved by both drugs.

Antenatal care provided by a general practitioner (GP) in the primary care setting is an important model of care, particularly for women in regional areas where rates of overweight and obesity are highest. The aim of this study is to explore GPs' perceptions and experiences of implementing GWG recommendations in GP-led antenatal care.A qualitative exploratory approach recorded GPs' experiences and insights regarding the application of GWG recommendations in practice. Data were collected via semi-structured interviews informed by the revised Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Deductive thematic analysis grouped coded text into TDF domains from which main themes were generated.Twenty GPs (13 female, 7 male) from metropolitan and regional Victoria, Australia participated. Codes related to at least one of 11 TDF domains. Five main themes were apparent: 1) Despite low awareness of guidelines, GWG advice is provided; 2) 'I should do this more'; 3) Lack of everyday resources; 4) Working 'against the odds' at times; and ) Optimism and reality. GPs were aware of the importance of optimal GWG however, other pregnancy-related issues are given precedence during consultations. Enablers for the implementation of GWG guidelines were practitioner-based and included GPs' strong sense of their professional role to provide advice, and ongoing and trusting relationships with women throughout pregnancy. Barriers were mostly health system-based with limited time, remuneration, and restrictive referral pathways being limiting factors.There is a need to support GPs to provide GWG advice in accordance with current national guidelines. Solutions potentially lie in strategies that promote the effective dissemination and uptake of guidelines, and changes to policy and funding within the health-system so that longer GP-led antenatal care consultations are remunerated and referrals to allied health are accessible to women who require additional support to optimise GWG.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671470>Value of routine ultrasound examination at 35-37 weeks' gestation in diagnosis of non-cephalic presentation.</a></h1><p>Undiagnosed non-cephalic presentation in labor carries increased risks for both the mother and baby. Routine pregnancy care based on maternal abdominal palpation fails to detect the majority of non-cephalic presentations.To report the incidence of non-cephalic presentation at a routine scan at 35 - 36 weeks' gestation and subsequent management of such pregnancies.This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data in 45,847 singleton pregnancies that had undergone routine ultrasound examination at 35 - 36 weeks' gestation. Patients with breech or transverse / oblique presentation were divided into two groups, first those that would have elective cesarean section for fetal or maternal indications other than the abnormal presentation, and second, those that would potentially require ECV. The latter group was reassessed in 1-2 weeks and if there was persistence of the abnormal presentation the parents were offered the options of ECV versus elective cesarean section at 38-40 weeks' gestation. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was carried out to determine which of the factors from maternal and pregnancy characteristics provided a significant contribution in the prediction of first, non-cephalic presentation at the 35 - 36 weeks scan, second, successful ECV from non-cephalic to cephalic presentation, and third, spontaneous rotation from non-cephalic to cephalic presentation.First, at 35 - 36 weeks the fetal presentation was cephalic in 43,416 (94.7%) pregnancies, breech in 1,987 (4.3%) and transverse or oblique in 444 (1.0%). Second, multivariable analysis demonstrated that the chance of non-cephalic presentation increased with increasing maternal age and , decreasing height, earlier gestational age at scan, and it was higher in the presence of placenta previa, oligohydramnios and polyhydramnios, in nulliparous than parous women and lower in women of South Asian and mixed racial origin than in White women. Third, 22% of cases of non-cephalic presentation were not eligible for ECV because of planned cesarean section for indications other than the malpresentation. Fourth, of those eligible for ECV only 48.% (646/1,332) accepted the procedure and this was successful in 39.0% (252/646) of cases. Fifth, the chance of successful ECV increased with increasing maternal age and was lower in nulliparous than parous women. Sixth, in 33.9% (738/2,179) of pregnancies with non-cephalic presentation where successful ECV was not carried out there was a subsequent spontaneous rotation to cephalic presentation. Seventh, the chance of spontaneous rotation from non-cephalic to cephalic presentation increased with increasing interval between the scan and delivery and decreased with increasing birth , it was higher in women of Black than White racial origin, if the presentation was transverse or oblique than breech and if there was polyhydramnios and lower in nulliparous than parous women and in the presence of placenta previa. Eighth, in 109 (0.3%) of cephalic presentations there was subsequent rotation to non-cephalic presentation and in 41% of these the diagnosis was made during labor. Ninth, in the total of 2,431 cases of non-cephalic presentation at the time of the scan the presentation at birth was cephalic in 985 (40.%); in 738 (74.9%) this was due to spontaneous rotation and in 247 (25.1%) due to successful ECV. Tenth, prediction of non-cephalic presentation at the 35 - 36 weeks scan and successful ECV from maternal and pregnancy factors was poor, but prediction of spontaneous rotation from non-cephalic to cephalic presentation was moderately good and this could be incorporated in the counselling of women prior to undertaking ECV.The problem of unexpected non-cephalic presentation in labor can to a great extent be overcome by a routine ultrasound examination at 35 - 36 weeks' gestation.

We aimed to characterize the exopolysaccharide (EPS) produced by novel probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum C70 (accession number KX881779) isolated from camel milk and to investigate its bioactivities and rheological properties. EPS-C70 had a -average molecular  (Mw) of 3.8 × 10 Da. Arabinose (13.3%), mannose (7.1%), glucose (74.6%), and galactose (.0%) were the major monosaccharides constituents. EPS-C70 had two endothermic peaks at 76.95°C and 158.76°C corresponding to glass transition (T) and melting point (T), respectively. Zeta potential and particle size of EPS-C70 were -330.71 mV and 525. nm, respectively. DPPH and ABTS of EPS-C70 were 75.91% and 49.42% at 10 mg/mL concentration, respectively. The cytotoxic activities against colon cancer and breast cancer lines were 88.1% and 73.1% at concentration 10 mg/mL, respectively. EPS-C70 exhibited shear-thinning behaviour. Salts and pH values had a significant impact on the rheological properties of EPS-C70.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Interventions with prebiotics, the key modulators of the gut microbiota, have paramount impact on host-associated metabolic disorders. Herein, we investigated the effect of fungus-derived (1,3)/(1,6)-β-glucan, a highly soluble dietary fiber, on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic distress.Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed with different diet groups (n = 11): control diet, HFD, 3 g/kg or  g/kg of β-glucan-incorporated HFD. At the end of experimental study period (12th week), , feces  and fecal moisture content were observed. Further, colonic motility was measured using activated charcoal meal study. Proteins extracted from liver and intestine tissues were subjected to western blot technique. Paraffin-embedded intestinal tissues were sectioned for histochemical [Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and Alcian blue (AB) staining] analysis. Fecal microbiota analysis was performed using MOTHUR bioinformatic software.β-glucan consumption exhibited anti-obesity property in mice groups fed with HFD. In addition, β-glucan ameliorated HFD-induced hepatic stress, colonic motility and intestinal atrophy (reduction in colon length, goblet cells, and mucosal layer thickness). Further, β-glucan incorporation shifted bacterial community by increasing butyrate-producing bacteria such as Anaerostipes, Coprobacillus, and Roseburia and decreasing reportedly obesity-associated bacteria such as Parabacteroides and Lactococcus.Altogether, the outcomes of this present pre-clinical animal study show β-glucan to be a promising therapeutic candidate in the treatment of HFD-induced metabolic distress. Further comprehensive research has to be conducted to brace its clinical relevance, reproducibility and efficacy for aiding human health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657064>Nursing knowledge of the principles of self-care of heart failure in primary care: a multicentre study.</a></h1><p>Nurses play an important part in the education of patients with HF. To prepare patients with HF for self-care maintenance behaviours, nurses must have knowledge of basic self-care maintenance principles.The aim of this study was to determine the degree of knowledge of primary care (PC) nurses on the principles of self-management of HF and variables associated with this.This is an observational, cross-sectional descriptive study, carried out in 2014, in the city of Barcelona (Catalonia). Nurses' Knowledge of Heart Failure Education Principles questionnaire (NKHFEP) was used to assess the principles of HF self-care education. Instrument items assess knowledge of nurses on  themes: diet, liquids/, worsening signs or symptoms, medication and exercise. Factors related to adequate knowledge were evaluated.Of 216 PC nurses, who completed the questionnaire, the average score was 15.6 (SD: 2.2). Only 36 (16.7%) obtained an adequate level of knowledge and defined as a score ≥ 18 points. In multivariate logistic regression, nurse factors associated with an adequate knowledge of principles of self-care of HF were having achieved a PhD degree (OR: 36.4, 95% CI: 2.8-468.2, p = 0.006) and previous specific training in HF (OR: 19.8, 95% CI: 1.4-279.3, p = 0.026).The degree of knowledge of PC nurses in the principles of self-care in HF was higher among nurses who had completed the doctorate and in nurses who had received specific training in HF.© 2019 Nordic College of Caring Science.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657058>Influence of multi-enzyme preparation supplemented with sodium butyrate on growth performance blood profiles and economic benefit of growing rabbits.</a></h1><p>The present study was carried out to explore the impacts of dietary supplementation of enzyme mixture with sodium butyrate on the growth performance, carcass traits, blood profile and economic benefit in two breeds of weanling rabbits adapted to survive in Egypt (New Zealand White and Rex). One-hundred and twenty weaned male rabbits (New Zealand White and Rex) of 6 weeks of age and 770. ± 20 g  were allotted randomly into four groups in a factorial arrangement. The obtained results indicated that there were non-significant differences in all growth performance traits, blood profile and economic parameters due to the breed effect. However, there were significant differences in most of carcass traits due to the breed effect except total giblets and New Zealand White breed showed the highest value of these parameters including dressing % (p < .01), forequarter and loin % (p < .001) and hindquarter % (p < .003) compared with Rex breed counterparts. The effect of the treatment and its interaction with the breed significantly (p < .05) improved  gain, feed consumption and carcass traits (percentage of dressing, forequarter, hind quarter and lion). However, final  and feed conversion ratio were not significantly influenced. Supplementing a diet with treatment significantly decreased blood triglycerides, cholesterol and the ratio between albumin and globulin (A/G ratio), while increased blood total protein and globulin. Although higher feed cost and total costs in treated groups than control ones in each breed, they showed higher total return and net return. Rex non-treated rabbit breed showed the lowest profitability  compared with other groups. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of multi-enzyme with sodium butyrate is highly recommended in growing rabbits due to their beneficial effects on the growth performance and profitability.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663316>Prediction of  fat in male athletes from ultrasound and anthropometric measurements versus DXA.</a></h1><p>To compare the accuracy of  fat percentage (BF%) measured by an ultrasound portable device and anthropometric measurements with a Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) as the reference technique in male athletes.A total of 100 athletes: 16 boxers, 4 rowers,  gymnasts, 6 base ball players, 19 judo players, 10 taekwondo players, 7 basket-ball players, 21 wrestlers, 6 cyclists on track and 6 karate expert aged from 18 to 30 years participated. All athletes were selected from the French National Institute of Sports and Physical Education . Ultrasound measurements were made with a sonographic US BOX at the mid-thigh level. We developed a multi -linear model of  fat estimation from ultrasound and anthropometric dimensions (height, , waist circumference) using the DXA reference method. A cross-validation study was then performed with this linear regression on 62 males athletes proportionally stratified across the sports.The best accuracy of BF was obtained using a multi-linear model from ultrasonic and anthropometric measurements with a concordance correlation pc = 0.941. This model was then used to estimate BF on the 62 males athletes. The concordance correlation pc= 0.931 and SEE =1.60. The 95% limits of agreement for individual BF% were [-4.1;3.6%] with symmetrically distributed deviations.Comparing to DXA, ultrasonic and anthropometric measurements are both accurate techniques to estimates BF%.

Anthropometry measurements were conducted on the index child at birth and approximately 1 and 2 years of age. A directed acyclic graph was used to identify minimal sufficient adjustment sets. Log-binomial regression was used to estimate the relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).3,,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPY), a metabolite of chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos methyl, and 4-nitrophenol, a metabolite of parathion and methyl parathion, were detected in nearly all women with geometric mean (95% CI) values of 3.17 (2.82-3.56) and 18.66 (17.03-20.46) µg/g creatinine, respectively. 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), a non-specific metabolite of several pyrethroids, and 2-isopropyl-4-methyl-6-hydroxypyrimidine (IMPY), a diazinon metabolite, were detected in 19.8% and 16.1% of women, respectively. The remaining four pesticide biomarkers were detected in <10% of women. Women in the highest quartile of 4-nitrophenol were more than 3 times more likely to deliver preterm than women in the lowest quartile: unadjusted RR (95% CI), 3.57 (1.65, 7.73). Women in the highest quartile of 4-nitrophenol were also at increased risk of having a child born small for gestational age: RR (95% CI) adjusted for household income, maternal education, and maternal total energy and meat intake, 3.81 (1.10, 13.21). Women with detectable concentrations of IMPY were at increased risk of having a child born with low birth  compared to women with non-detectable concentrations: adjusted RR (95% CI), 2.13 (1.12, 4.08). We observed no association between any of the pesticide biomarkers and stunting at 1 or 2 years of age.Exposure to the insecticides parathion and diazinon during early pregnancy may increase the risk of adverse birth outcomes.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Obesity is not only a merely aesthetic disease but is the "mother" of most chronic diseases such as associated with a range of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and cancer. However, although there is a need to find a strategy to stop this epidemic disease, most of the times the current nutritional strategies are not effective in  loss and in long term  maintenance. Very low-calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) is increasingly establishing as a successful nutritional pattern to manage obesity; this is due to rapid  loss that gives rise to a positive psychological cycle which in turn increases the compliance to diet. Another important key point of VLCKD is the ability to preserve fatty free mass which is known to play a role of paramount importance in glucose metabolism. Despite the clinical evidence of VLCKD there are paucity of data regarding to its management. Therefore, we will provide a useful guide to be used by nutrition experts taking care of subjects with obesity. In particular, we will report recommendations on the correct use of this therapeutic approach for  loss and management of side effects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658816>Racial/Ethnic Differences in Diet Quality and Eating Habits Among WIC Pregnant Women: Implications for Policy and Practice.</a></h1><p>One of the major federal food assistance programs, the Special Supplemental Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), serves approximately 1. million low-income pregnant women per year; however, limited information is available on their dietary habits. This is critical because low-income women are at higher risk of gaining excess  during pregnancy. Thus, the study objectives were to (1) determine the overall diet quality of WIC pregnant women and (2) examine diet quality and eating behaviors by race/ethnicity and other sociodemographics.This was a cross-sectional study.One of the 3 WIC offices in a north-central county in North Carolina, USA.Pregnant women (n = 198) in the second trimester.Interviews included sociodemographics, food security, diet, and eating behaviors. Diet quality was assessed by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) 2010 scores.Descriptives, bivariate analysis, and multivariate analysis.Average participant age was 26 years, and the mean HEI-2010 score was 56 of maximum score of 100. Specifically, African American women consumed significantly lower servings of whole grains (β = -1.71; 95% CI: -3.10 to -0.32;  < .05) and dairy (β = -1.42; 95% CI: -2.51 to -0.33;  < .05) compared with non-Hispanic white women. Hispanic women scored higher in daily intake of fruits (β = 0.98; 95% CI: 0.17-1.79;  < .05) and for consuming empty calories in moderation (β = 1.57; 95% CI: 0.06-3.09;  < .05). Frequency of intake of fast foods/outside meals was higher among African American women (57%,  = .025).Efforts are warranted to promote optimal nutrition among WIC pregnant women. Specifically, African American women are highly vulnerable to poor dietary habits during pregnancy. Further investigation of barriers/facilitators for healthy eating is necessary to address nutrition disparities among WIC pregnant women.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667370>Comprehensive evaluation of voltage stability based on EW-AHP and Fuzzy-TOPSIS.</a></h1><p>Large-scale voltage collapse incidences, which result in power outages over large regions and extensive economic losses, are presently common occurrences worldwide. Therefore, the voltage stability analysis of power systems has become a topic of increasing interest. This paper firstly presents a comprehensive evaluation method for conducting static and transient voltage stability analysis in electric power systems. To overcome the limitations associated with single-index systems in the evaluation of voltage stability, the analysis approach employs a multi-index system with four primary criteria based on separate analysis methods with ten sub-criteria based on individual indices. In addition, this paper proposes a comprehensive method for establishing index , which combines the subjective analytic hierarchy process weighting method and the objective entropy weighting method. An innovative index- optimization method based on the Lagrange conditioned extreme value is presented and sensitivity analysis is applied to test the robust of the proposed method. Finally, Fuzzy-TOPSIS is employed to rank the voltage buses of a power system as the final results, considering system functionality and proportionality. The results obtained for an actual power grid in Hami City, China demonstrate that the proposed method represents an effective approach for determining the weakest bus in power systems.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660621>Distributed Deep Learning Across Multi-site Datasets for Generalized CT Hemorrhage Segmentation.</a></h1><p>As deep neural networks achieve more success in the wide field of computer vision, greater emphasis is being placed on the generalizations of these models for production deployment. With sufficiently large training datasets, models can typically avoid overfitting their data; however, for medical imaging it is often difficult to obtain enough data from a single site. Sharing data between institutions is also frequently nonviable or prohibited due to security  and research compliance constraints, enforced to guard protected health information (PHI) and patient anonymity.In this paper, we implement cyclic  transfer with independent datasets from multiple geographically disparate sites without compromising PHI. We compare results between single-site learning (SSL) and multi-site learning (MSL) models on testing data drawn from each of the training sites as well as two other institutions.The MSL model attains an average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0:690 on the holdout institution datasets with a volume correlation of 0:914, respectively corresponding to a 7% and % statistically significant improvement over the average of both SSL models, which attained an average DSC of 0:646 and average correlation of 0:871.We show that a neural network can be efficiently trained on data from two physically remote sites without consolidating patient data to a single location. The resulting network improves model generalization and achieves higher average DSCs on external datasets than neural networks trained on data from a single source.© 2019 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673891>Benefits and risks of low molecular  heparin in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.</a></h1><p>Low molecular  heparin (LMWH) is an anticoagulant that has recently been found benefit in the acute exacerbation stage of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). But its efficacy is controversial. The objective of this paper is to compare the harm/benefit of LMWH combined with conventional therapy versus single conventional therapy in the acute exacerbation stage of COPD.PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CNKI, and Clinical Trials.gov were searched from inception until March 2019. Randomized control trials were included if they reported the use of LMWH for the treatment of COPD. Continuous variable data were reported as mean difference (MD), risk difference (RD), and Peto odds ratio (OR) with corresponding 95% CIs.Twelve RCTs (N = 1086 subjects) were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled results exhibited that LMWH treatment significantly improved the levels of arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO) (MD = 4.58, 95% CI: 1.78-7.39, P = 0.001), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) (MD = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.09-0.29, P = 0.0002), and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) (MD = 10.44, 95% CI: .40-15.48, P < 0.0001), and significantly reduced the risk of thrombosis (RD, - 0.03; 95% CI, - 0.07 to 0.00; P = 0.05). There was a marginally but nonsignificant improvement in PaCO levels vs non-LMWH treatment. Moreover, pooled results exhibited that LMWH may increase the risk of hemorrhage. Subgroup analyses exhibited that LMWH treatment only was associated with a significantly increased risk of minor bleeding but not major hemorrhage.When compared with single conventional therapy, addition of LMWH to conventional therapy may provide more clinical benefits in the acute exacerbation stage of COPD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667614>Impact of age on morbidity and mortality following bariatric surgery.</a></h1><p>Bariatric surgery is the most effective modality to treat obesity and obesity-related comorbidities. This study sought to utilize the MBASQIP® Data Registry to analyze the impact of age at time of surgery on outcomes following sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) procedures.The MBSAQIP® Data Registry for patients undergoing SG or RYGB procedures between 2015 and 2016 was reviewed. Patients were divided into 4 age groups [18-44; 45-54; 55-64; > 65 years]. Minimal exclusions for revisional and/or emergency surgery were selected and combination variables created to classify complications as major or minor. A comorbidity index was constructed to include diabetes, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and prior cardiac surgery. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to compare age stratifications to the young adult (18-45 years) cohort.Of 301,605 cases, 279,419 cases (71.2% SG) remained after applying exclusion criteria (79.2% female, mean BMI 45. ± 8.1 kg/m, 8.9% insulin-dependent diabetics). Mean age was 44.7 ± 12.0 years (51.3% 18-44 years; 26.9% 45-54 years; 16.3% 55-64 years; .% > 65 years). A univariate analysis demonstrated preoperative differences of lower BMI with increasing age concomitant with increasing frequency of RYGB and a higher comorbidity index (p < 0.0001 vs. 18-45 years). At age > 45 years, major complications and 30-day mortality increased independent of procedure type (p < 0.0001). A multivariate analysis controlling for comorbidity indices demonstrated increasing age (> 45 years) increased risk for major complications and mortality.Overall, bariatric surgery (SG or RYGB) remains a low mortality risk procedure for all age groups. However, all age group classifications > 45 years had higher incidence of major complications and mortality compared to patients 18-45 years (despite older individuals having lower preoperative BMI) indicating delaying surgery is detrimental.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659705>Outcomes of mitral valve replacement with bileaflet mechanical prosthetic valve in children.</a></h1><p>We examined the outcomes following mitral valve replacement with bileaflet mechanical prosthetic valve in children and identified the predictors for mortality and reoperation.Medical records from 49 children who underwent mitral valve replacement between 1982 and 2015 were reviewed retrospectively. Median age and  at initial mitral valve replacement were 2.4 years and 9.7 kg, respectively. The median follow-up was 13 years. Surgical results and predictors for mortality and reoperation were investigated.There was no operative mortality; eight late deaths occurred. The actuarial survival rates were 89.%, 84.2%, and 80.7% at , 10, and 15 years, respectively, after initial mitral valve replacement. The actuarial freedom rates from related complications were 89.%, 78.3%, and 70.7% at , 10, and 15 years, respectively. Nineteen patients required 1st re-mitral valve replacement at a median of .9 years; six of these 19 required 2nd re-mitral valve replacement at a median of 8.9 years after 1st re-MVR. The actuarial freedom rates from re-mitral valve replacement were 86.0%, 56.8%, and 44.2% at , 10, and 15 years, respectively. No predictor for death was determined; however, the predictor for re-mitral valve replacement was initial valve diameter less than 19 mm.Survival outcomes among children after mitral valve replacement with bileaflet mechanical prosthetic valve in biventricular heart were satisfactory. However, complications, including re-mitral valve replacement, were frequent and the predictor was of a small prosthesis size.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668447>Pattern of milk yield and immunoglobulin concentration and factors associated with colostrum quality at the quarter level in dairy cows after parturition.</a></h1><p>First colostrum yield and constituents as well as milk yield during established lactation vary considerably among mammary quarters in dairy cows. However, data on the development of milk yield, IgG concentration, and their distribution per quarter within cows during the first milkings after calving are scarce. We analyzed milk production and IgG concentration at the individual quarter level in 29 multiparous Holstein cows during the first  milkings after calving. Cow- and calf-related factors (time interval between calving and first milking, parity number, previous lactation yield, gestation length, dry period length, sex, and birth  of the calf) potentially affecting first colostrum quality and quantity were assessed. Milking of first colostrum was carried out between 30 and 180 min after parturition. Further milkings were performed twice daily. Quarter milk yield varied between 0.1 and . kg at the first milking and between 1.4 and .1 kg at the fifth milking relative to parturition. Quarter IgG concentration ranged between 18.8 and 106.0 mg/mL at the first milking and between 0.8 and 46.1 mg/mL at the fifth milking. Distribution of milk yield and IgG concentration among quarters was not entirely repeatable during the first  successive milkings after parturition; that is, the ranking of quarters changed (intraclass correlation coefficients for quarter milk yield and IgG concentration: 0.64 and 0.79, respectively). The average hourly milk production increased in all quarters, ranging from 0.02 to 0.26 kg/h between the first 2 milkings up to 0.11 to 0.45 kg/h between the fourth and fifth milkings. First colostrum yield was not affected by any of the evaluated cow- and calf-related factors. Quarter colostrum IgG concentration was higher in cows with a higher previous lactation yield, whereas a lower colostrum IgG content was observed in cows with a longer gestation period and consequently heavier calves. In conclusion, milk yield and IgG concentration of individual quarters varied considerably, and their distribution among quarters within cows was moderately repeatable in consecutive milkings and changed partially over time. The decline of IgG concentration was independent of the concomitant increase in milk secretion, with changes occurring at different rates in individual quarters. Our results confirm the independence of the single mammary quarters at the onset of lactation despite an identical exposure to endocrine stimuli.Copyright © 2020 American Dairy Science Association.

This was a secondary analysis of the nation-wide survey data from Kaifukuki (convalescent) rehabilitation wards (KRWs). Data of patients aged ≥20 y with disabilities and  mass index (BMI) <18. kg/m and who were discharged from 1,099 KRWs were analyzed. The primary outcome was BMI at discharge. Secondary outcomes were Functional Independence Measure (FIM) at discharge and returning to home. Patients were divided into two groups: those in KRWs with ≥1 or <1 dedicated RD per ward (KRW/RD+ and KRW/RD-, respectively). Of ,843 eligible participants (female, 63%; median age, 82 y; hip/vertebral/knee fracture, 47%; stroke, 34%; disuse syndrome secondary to acute illness, 11%; others, 8%), 1,288 and 4,555 were from the KRW/RD+ and KRW/RD- groups, respectively. At discharge, KRW/RD+ patients had higher FIM (93 vs. 90) and BMI (17.1 vs. 17.0 kg/m) than did KRW/RD- patients. Multivariable analysis showed that assignment of dedicated RDs (B=0.213, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.036-0.389), number of nurses (B=0.023, 95% CI, 0.003-0.043), and daily rehabilitation dose were significantly associated with changes in . Furthermore, these factors positively affected BMI at discharge. Number of nurses and rehabilitation dose correlated with FIM, but assignment of RDs did not correlate with FIM. In conclusion, assignment of RDs, nurses, and sufficient rehabilitation dose may contribute to BMI gain. Nurses and daily rehabilitation dose may positively affect functional recovery.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659466>Trends in age- and sex-adjusted  mass index and the prevalence of malnutrition in children with cancer over 42 months after diagnosis: a single-center cohort study.</a></h1><p>The adequate nutritional status of pediatric cancer patients is particularly important to enable them to cope with the demands of the disease and its treatment and to maintain normal growth. Malnutrition and obesity have both been associated with reduced survival and increased drug toxicity. We investigated trends in the age- and sex-adjusted  mass index (ISO-BMI) and the prevalence of malnutrition in a Finnish cohort of 139 consecutive children receiving chemotherapy for cancer, with a follow-up period of 42 months after diagnosis. In total, 28% (39/139) of the patients experienced malnutrition (ISO-BMI < 17 or > 10%  loss), and 12% (16/139) had a nasogastric tube or underwent gastrostomy. Patients with acute or chronic myeloid leukemia (/10), central nervous system (CNS) tumors (/13), or solid tumors (13/31) most frequently suffered from malnutrition. There was a significant increase in the ISO-BMI of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (+ 2.1 kg/m) and lymphomas (+ 2.4 kg/m) during the first 6 months, and the ISO-BMI of patients with ALL remained higher at 42 months compared to baseline (+ 1.9 kg/m).Conclusion: The cumulative incidence of malnutrition in Finnish pediatric cancer patients is comparable to that reported in other populations. The nutritional status of patients with acute myeloid leukemia, CNS tumors, or solid tumors should be monitored with extra care to facilitate early intervention in the case of impending malnutrition. What is known: • Both malnutrition and obesity are associated with reduced survival and increased drug toxicity in pediatric cancer patients. What is new: • Overall, 28 % of Finnish children receiving chemotherapy for cancer suffer from malnutrition during the first 42 months following the initial cancer diagnosis. • ISO-BMI curves from initial diagnosis to 42 months after diagnosis are provided for patients with different types of cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672146>Short-term treatment with high dose liraglutide improves lipid and lipoprotein profile and changes hormonal mediators of lipid metabolism in obese patients with no overt type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind clinical trial.</a></h1><p>Long-term treatment with up to 1.8 mg liraglutide improves cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is currently under investigation in subjects without diabetes. Aim of our study was to investigate whether high dose (3 mg) short-term ( weeks) treatment with liraglutide in obese patients with no overt type 2 diabetes affects metabolites, lipid and lipoprotein profile and components of activin-follistatin axis in cardiovascular beneficial or detrimental way.Twenty obese patients participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind study and were administrated liraglutide 3 mg or placebo for  weeks. Metabolites, fatty acids, lipid-lipoprotein profile and concentrations of activins and follistatins (250 parameters) were assessed in serum at start and completion of each treatment.Concentrations of important cardiovascular markers such as total, free and remnant cholesterol were reduced with liraglutide before and after adjusting for  loss. Similarly, reductions in number of small and medium size LDL particles and in their total lipid concentration were observed with liraglutide and partially -loss related. Tyrosine levels were reduced and behenic acid levels were increased whereas only minor changes were observed in HDL, VLDL and IDL. Concentrations of activin AB and follistatin were significantly reduced in liraglutide-treated group.Treatment of obese patients without overt type 2 diabetes with high dose of liraglutide for a short period of time induces changes in lipid-lipoprotein and hormonal profile that are suggestive of lower risk of atherosclerosis and CVD.

Alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) has been reported to decrease dietary protein levels, promote intestinal health in piglets and reduce environmental pollution. However, the underlying mechanisms of AKG are largely unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of low-protein diet supplementation of AKG on the growth performance, nitrogen metabolism, relative expression of amino acid transporter genes and mTOR signalling pathway of skeletal muscle in piglets. Forty-eight piglets with an initial  of 11.53 ± 0.04 kg were randomly divided into four groups. Each group had four replicates, and each replicate had three pigs. A low-protein (LP) diet (crude protein was 14.96%) served as the control without AKG, while 0.%, 1.0% and 1.% AKG were added to the LP diet for the other experimental groups. The trial period lasted for 28 days. Compared with the LP group, the LP + 1.0%A and LP + 1.%A groups increased the growth performance (p < .05);increased the mRNA levels of amino acid transporters in the duodenum, anterior jejunum and posterior jejunum (p < .05); and reduced faecal nitrogen and urine nitrogen emissions (p < .05). They also showed greater mRNA levels and phosphorylated protein levels for S6 kinase beta (S6K) (p < .05), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (p < .05) and 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) (p < .05) in skeletal muscle. An LP diet supplemented with AKG activated the mTOR signalling and promoted the ability of the small intestine to absorb protein, thereby increasing protein deposition. Taken together, an LP diet supplemented with AKG provides a theoretical basis for the promotion and application of AKG in piglet production.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670396>Screening for small-for-gestational-age fetuses.</a></h1><p>It is well established that correct antenatal identification of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) fetuses reduces their risk of adverse perinatal outcome with long-term consequences. Ultrasound estimates of fetal  (EFW ) is the ultimate tool for this identification. It can be conducted as a "universal screening", ie all pregnant women at a specific gestational age. However, in Denmark it is conducted as "selective screening", ie only on clinical indication. The aim of this study was to assess the performance of the Danish national SGA screening program and the consequences of false positive and false negative SGA cases.In this retrospective cohort study, we included 2928 women with singleton pregnancies with due date in 2015. We defined "risk of SGA" by an EFW ≤ -15% of expected for the gestational age and "SGA" as birthweight ≤ -22% of expected for gestational age.At birth, the prevalence of SGA was 3.3%. The overall sensitivity of the Danish screening program was 62% at a false-positive rate of .6%. Within the entire cohort, 63% had an EFW as compared to 79% of the SGA-cases. The sensitivity was 79% for those born before 37 weeks' gestation but only 40% for those born after 40 weeks' gestation. The sensitivity was also associated to birthweight deviation; 73% among extreme SGA cases (birthweight deviation ≤ -33%) and 55% among mild SGA (birthweight deviation between -22% and 27%). False diagnosis of SGA was associated with an increased rate of induction of labor (OR = 2.51, 95% CI; 1.70 to 3.71) and cesarean section (OR = 1.44, 95% CI; 0.96 to 2.18).The performance of the Danish national screening program for SGA based on selective EFW on clinical indication have improved considerably over the last 20 years. Limitations of the program are the large proportion of women referred to ultrasound scan and the low performance post-term.© 2019 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology.</p></html>
