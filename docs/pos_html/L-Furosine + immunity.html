Disruption of lung integrity and impaired antibacterial  during IAV infection participate in colonization and dissemination of the bacteria out of the lungs. One key feature of IAV infection is the profound alteration of lung myeloid cells, characterized by the recruitment of deleterious inflammatory monocytes. We herein report that IAV infection causes a transient decrease of lung conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) (both cDC1 and cDC2) peaking at day 7 post-infection. While triggering emergency monopoiesis, IAV transiently altered the differentiation of cDCs in the bone marrow, the cDC1-biaised pre-DCs being particularly affected. The impaired cDC differentiation during IAV infection was independent of type I interferons (IFNs), IFN-γ, TNFα and IL-6 and was not due to an intrinsic dysfunction of cDC precursors. The alteration of cDC differentiation was associated with a drop of local and systemic production of Fms-like  kinase 3 ligand (Flt3-L), a critical cDC differentiation factor. Overexpression of Flt3-L during IAV infection boosted the cDC progenitors' production in the BM, replenished cDCs in the lungs, decreased inflammatory monocytes' infiltration and lowered lung damages. This was associated with partial protection against secondary pneumococcal infection, as reflected by reduced bacterial dissemination and prolonged survival. These findings highlight the impact of distal viral infection on cDC genesis in the BM and suggest that Flt3-L may have potential applications in the control of secondary infections.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30417091>A  sulfation-dependent HLA-I modification identifies memory B cells and plasma cells.</a></h2><p>Memory B cells and plasma cells are antigen-experienced cells tasked with the maintenance of humoral protection. Despite these prominent functions, definitive cell surface markers have not been identified for these cells. We report here the isolation and characterization of the monoclonal variable lymphocyte receptor B (VLRB) N8 antibody from the evolutionarily distant sea lamprey that specifically recognizes memory B cells and plasma cells in humans. Unexpectedly, we determined that VLRB N8 recognizes the human leukocyte antigen-I (HLA-I) antigen in a  sulfation-dependent manner. Furthermore, we observed increased binding of VLRB N8 to memory B cells in individuals with autoimmune disorders multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Our study indicates that lamprey VLR antibodies uniquely recognize a memory B cell- and plasma cell-specific posttranslational modification of HLA-I, the expression of which is up-regulated during B cell activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31392076>Lenvatinib promotes antitumor  by enhancing the tumor infiltration and activation of NK cells.</a></h2><p>Based on previous reports, the efficacy of lenvatinib against cancer is mainly attributed to its antiangiogenic activity and its ability to suppress tumor proliferation, which are mediated by targeting receptor  kinases (RTKs). However, the effects of lenvatinib on tumor immune modulation have rarely been explored. Here, we show that lenvatinib effectively inhibited murine melanoma and renal cancer, and this inhibition was associated with enhanced tumor infiltration by natural killer (NK) cells. Critically, lenvatinib-induced tumor growth inhibition was attenuated by antibody-mediated NK cell depletion or the blockade of NK cell chemotaxis with an anti-CXCR3 blocking antibody. In addition, the expression of natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) by tumor-infiltrating NK cells and the expression of cytotoxic cytokines in the tumor tissue were also augmented by lenvatinib. These data thus suggest that lenvatinib may be used not only as a direct cytotoxic drug against tumor angiogenesis and proliferation but also as a potent adjunct for enhancing the efficacy of immune-based cancer therapies by enhancing the tumor infiltration and activation of NK cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30311057>Chronic Aichi Virus Infection in a Patient with X-Linked Agammaglobulinemia.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920458>Genetics in community-acquired pneumonia.</a></h2><p>Host defense against community-acquired pneumonia depends on an intact innate and acquired immune system.

Its biological actions are primarily mediated by PPAR-α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors α) and the orphan receptor GPR55. Palmitoylethanolamide exerts potent anti-inflammatory actions but its physiological role and promise as a therapeutic agent in chronic arterial inflammation, such as atherosclerosis remain unexplored. Approach and Results- First, the polarization of mouse primary macrophages towards a proinflammatory phenotype was found to reduce N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D expression and palmitoylethanolamide bioavailability. N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D expression was progressively downregulated in the aorta of apolipoprotein E deficient (ApoE) mice during atherogenesis. N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D mRNA levels were also downregulated in unstable human plaques and they positively associated with smooth muscle cell markers and negatively with macrophage markers. Second, ApoE mice were fed a high-fat diet for 4 or 16 weeks and treated with either vehicle or palmitoylethanolamide (3 mg/kg per day, 4 weeks) to study the effects of palmitoylethanolamide on early established and pre-established atherosclerosis. Palmitoylethanolamide treatment reduced plaque size in early atherosclerosis, whereas in pre-established atherosclerosis, palmitoylethanolamide promoted signs of plaque stability as evidenced by reduced macrophage accumulation and necrotic core size, increased collagen deposition and downregulation of M1-type macrophage markers. Mechanistically, we found that palmitoylethanolamide, by activating GPR55, increases the expression of the phagocytosis receptor MerTK (proto-oncogene -protein kinase MER) and enhances macrophage efferocytosis, indicative of proresolving properties. Conclusions- The present study demonstrates that palmitoylethanolamide protects against atherosclerosis by promoting an anti-inflammatory and proresolving phenotype of lesional macrophages, representing a new therapeutic approach to resolve arterial inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082431>Non-receptor  kinase signaling in autoimmunity and therapeutic implications.</a></h2><p>Autoimmune diseases are characterized by impaired immune tolerance towards self-antigens, leading to enhanced  to self by dysfunctional B cells and/or T cells. The activation of these cells is controlled by non-receptor  kinases (NRTKs), which are critical mediators of antigen receptor and cytokine receptor signaling pathways. NRTKs transduce, amplify and sustain activating signals that contribute to autoimmunity, and are counter-regulated by protein  phosphatases (PTPs). The function of and interaction between NRTKs and PTPs during the development of autoimmunity could be key points of therapeutic interference against autoimmune diseases. In this review, we summarize the current state of knowledge of the functions of NRTKs and PTPs involved in B cell receptor (BCR), T cell receptor (TCR), and cytokine receptor signaling pathways that contribute to autoimmunity, and discuss their targeting for therapeutic approaches against autoimmune diseases.Copyright © 2019.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play an important role in triggering the immune response in other contexts. Here, we propose a model by which EVs isolated from human islets stimulate proinflammatory immune responses and lead to peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) activation. We show that human islet EVs are internalized by monocytes and B cells and lead to an increase in T-helper 1, 2, and 17 cytokine expression, as well as T and B cell proliferation. Importantly, we demonstrate memory T and B cell activation by EVs selectively in PBMCs of patients with T1D. Additionally, human islet EVs induce an increase in antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) in T1D PBMCs. Furthermore, pretreatment of T1D PBMCs with ibrutinib, an inhibitor of Bruton  kinase, dampens EV-induced memory B cell activation and GAD65 antibody production. Collectively, our findings indicate a role for human islet EVs in mediating activation of B and T cells and GAD65 autoantibody production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31434951>Catalytically Impaired TYK2 Variants are Protective Against Childhood- and Adult-Onset Systemic Lupus Erythematosus in Mexicans.</a></h2><p>Type I interferon (IFN-I) pathway plays a central role in the systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pathogenesis. Recent data suggest that SLE is associated with variants in IFN-I genes, such as  kinase 2 (TYK2), which is crucial in anti-viral . Here, five TYK2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 368 childhood-onset SLE Mexican patients and 516 sex-matched healthy controls. Allele frequencies were also estimated in four indigenous groups. SLE protection was associated with TYK2 risk infection variants affecting residually its catalytic domain, rs12720356 (OR = 0.308; p = 0.041) and rs34536443 (OR = 0.370; p = 0.034), but not with rs2304256, rs12720270, and rs280500. This association was replicated in a 506 adult-onset SLE patients sample (OR = 0.250; p = 0.005, and OR = 0.277; p = 0.008, respectively). The minor alleles of both associated SNPs had a lower frequency in Mestizos than in Spaniards and were absent or rare in indigenous, suggesting that the presence of these alleles in the Mexican Mestizo population was derived from the Spaniards. For the first time, we report genetic variants with a protective effect in childhood- and adult-onset SLE Mexican population. Our results suggest that the frequency of IFN-I alleles associated with SLE, may have been shaped in populations exposed to infectious diseases for long periods, and this could be an explanation why Native American ancestry is associated with a higher SLE prevalence and an earlier onset.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30636557>Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms of PTPN22 Gene in Iranian Patients with Ulcerative Colitis.</a></h2><p>Protein  phosphatase non-receptor type 22 gene (PTPN22) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) have been associated with a number of different autoimmune diseases. This study aimed to investigate the association of five polymorphisms of PTPN22 gene with susceptibility to ulcerative colitis (UC) in Iran.A total of 67 patients diagnosed with UC (35 female and 32 male all under 18 years) and 93 healthy subjects were selected. The samples were genotyped for the, rs12760457, rs2476601, rs1310182, rs1217414, and rs33996649 in PTPN22 gene using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) allelic discrimination TaqMan genotyping assays.The frequencies of the rs1310182 A and G alleles, and also the AA and GG genotypes were significantly different between the patient and the control groups (p < 0.05). The carriage of G allele of rs1310182 was significantly associated with increased risk of UC (OR (95% CI) = 1.17 (0.70-1.98), p < 0.001). Moreover, the genotype GG of SNP rs1310182 was significantly associated with UC (OR (95% CI) = 2.32 (1.13-4.76), p < 0.01).

A mutant screen for suppressors of agb1-2 susceptibility (sgb) to P. cucumerina BMM identified sgb10, a new null allele (mkp1-2) of the mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP1). The enhanced susceptibility of agb1-2 to the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 and the oomycete Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis is also abrogated by mkp1-2. MKP1 negatively balances production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) triggered by MAMPs, since ROS levels are enhanced in mkp1. The expression of RBOHD, encoding a NADPH oxidase-producing ROS, is upregulated in mkp1 upon MAMP treatment or pathogen infection. Moreover, MKP1 negatively regulates RBOHD activity, because ROS levels upon MAMP treatment are increased in mkp1 plants constitutively overexpressing RBOHD (35S::RBOHD mkp1). A significant reprograming of mkp1 metabolic profile occurs with more than 170 metabolites, including antimicrobial compounds, showing differential accumulation in comparison with wild-type plants. These results suggest that MKP1 functions downstream of the heterotrimeric G protein during MAMP-triggered , directly regulating the activity of RBOHD and ROS production as well as other immune responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30294329>Systemic ST6Gal-1 Is a Pro-survival Factor for Murine Transitional B Cells.</a></h2><p>Humoral  depends on intrinsic B cell developmental programs guided by systemic signals that convey physiologic needs. Aberrant cues or their improper interpretation can lead to immune insufficiency or a failure of tolerance and autoimmunity. The means by which such systemic signals are conveyed remain poorly understood. Hence, further insight is essential to understanding and treating autoimmune diseases and to the development of improved vaccines. ST6Gal-1 is a sialyltransferase that constructs the α2,6-sialyl linkage on cell surface and extracellular glycans. The requirement for functional ST6Gal-1 in the development of humoral  is well documented. Canonically, ST6Gal-1 resides within the intracellular ER-Golgi secretory apparatus and participates in cell-autonomous glycosylation. However, a significant pool of extracellular ST6Gal-1 exists in circulation. Here, we segregate the contributions of B cell intrinsic and extrinsic ST6Gal-1 to B cell development. We observed that B cell-intrinsic ST6Gal-1 is required for marginal zone B cell development, while B cell non-autonomous ST6Gal-1 modulates B cell development and survival at the early transitional stages of the marrow and spleen. Exposure to extracellular ST6Gal-1  enhanced the formation of IgM-high B cells from immature precursors, and increased CD23 and IgM expression. Extrinsic sialylation by extracellular ST6Gal-1 augmented BAFF-mediated activation of the non-canonical NF-kB, p38 MAPK, and PI3K/AKT pathways, and accelerated  phosphorylation after B cell receptor stimulation. , systemic ST6Gal-1 did not influence homing of B cells to the spleen but was critical for their long-term survival and systemic IgG levels. Circulatory ST6Gal-1 levels respond to inflammation, infection, and malignancy in mammals, including humans. In turn, we have shown previously that systemic ST6Gal-1 regulates inflammatory cell production by modifying bone marrow myeloid progenitors. Our data here point to an additional role of systemic ST6Gal-1 in guiding B cell development, which supports the concept that circulating ST6Gal-1 is a conveyor of systemic cues to guide the development of multiple branches of immune cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31232162>Structural basis of Type IV CRISPR RNA biogenesis by a Cas6 endoribonuclease.</a></h2><p>Prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems rely on small non-coding RNAs derived from CRISPR loci to recognize and destroy complementary nucleic acids. However, the mechanism of Type IV CRISPR RNA (crRNA) biogenesis is poorly understood. To dissect the mechanism of Type IV CRISPR RNA biogenesis, we determined the x-ray crystal structure of the putative Type IV CRISPR associated endoribonuclease Cas6 from  ( Cas6-IV) and characterized its enzymatic activity with RNA cleavage assays. We show that  Cas6-IV specifically cleaves Type IV crRNA repeats at the 3' side of a predicted stem loop, with a metal-independent, single-turnover mechanism that relies on a histidine and a  located within the putative endonuclease active site. Structure and sequence alignments with Cas6 orthologs reveal that although  Cas6-IV shares little sequence homology with other Cas6 proteins, all share common structural features that bind distinct crRNA repeat sequences. This analysis of Type IV crRNA biogenesis provides a structural and biochemical framework for understanding the similarities and differences of crRNA biogenesis across multi-subunit Class 1 CRISPR immune systems.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30339875>Silkworm serpin32 functions as a negative-regulator in prophenoloxidase activation.</a></h2><p>The extracellular serine protease cascade is an essential component of insect humoral . Serine protease inhibitors (serpins) play an important regulatory role in the process of insect  by regulating the serine protease cascade pathway. We aimed to clarify the function of Bmserpin32 in this study. First, we performed homologous sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis of Bmserpin32. Bmserpin32 was found to share 64% amino acid sequence identity with Manduca sexta serpin7, an immunomodulatory protein. Bmserpin32 cDNA was cloned, and the recombinant Bmserpin32 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity and gel filtration chromatography. The activity assay showed that Bmserpin32 had significant inhibitory activity against trypsin. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis combined with activity assays indicated that the cleavage site of Bmserpin32 is between Arg and Ile. After infection with E. coli or Micrococcus luteus, the expression level of Bmserpin32 in immune-related tissues was significantly upregulated. In addition, Bmserpin32 could delay or inhibit the melanization of hemolymph by inhibiting the activation of prophenoloxidase in larval hemolymph. Furthermore, a physiological target of Bmserpin32 was identified as the clip protease, BmPAP3, an apparent ortholog of M. sexta propenoloxidase-activating protease-3. Our observations enable a better understanding of the physiological role of Bmserpin32 in regulating melanization in silkworm.Copyright © 2018.

However, insights into the role of CFH in B cell biology are limited. Here, we demonstrate that deficiency of CFH in mice leads to altered splenic B cell development characterized by the accumulation of marginal zone (MZ) B cells. Furthermore, B cells in h mice exhibit enhanced B cell receptor (BCR) signaling as evaluated by increased levels of phosphorylated Bruton's  kinase (pBTK) and phosphorylated spleen  kinase (pSYK). We show that enhanced BCR activation is associated with uncontrolled C3 consumption in the spleen and elevated complement receptor 2 (CR2, also known as CD21) levels on the surface of mature splenic B cells. Moreover, aged h mice developed splenomegaly with distorted spleen architecture and spontaneous B cell-dependent autoimmunity characterized by germinal center hyperactivity and a marked increase in anti-double stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies. Taken together, our data indicate that CFH, through its function as a complement repressor, acts as a negative regulator of BCR signaling and limits autoimmunity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31397086>Effects of BTK signalling in pathogenic microorganism infections.</a></h2><p>As a cytoplasmic protein  kinase, Bruton's  kinase (Btk) is widely considered as a vital kinase in many aspects of different physiologic processes.

Given the diverse and critical roles of Eph receptors and ephrin ligands throughout the immune system during both resting and activated states, this review aims to highlight the critical yet underappreciated roles of this family of signaling molecules in the immune system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646846>Btk inhibitor ibrutinib reduces inflammatory myeloid cell responses in the lung during murine pneumococcal pneumonia.</a></h2><p>Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major causative agent in community-acquired pneumonia and sepsis. Overwhelming lung inflammation during pneumococcal pneumonia may hamper lung function. Ibrutinib is an irreversible inhibitor of Bruton's  kinase (Btk), a key signaling protein controlling the activation of various immune cells, including macrophages and neutrophils. The aim of this study was to determine whether ibrutinib treatment ameliorates acute lung inflammation during pneumococcal pneumonia.Mice were treated orally with ibrutinib and the effect on acute pulmonary inflammation elicited by the gram-positive bacterial cell wall component lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and during ceftriaxone-treated pneumococcal pneumonia was assessed.Treatment with ibrutinib prior to and after intranasal LTA instillation reduced alveolar macrophage activation, neutrophil influx, cytokine release and plasma leakage into the lung. Postponed treatment with ibrutinib supplementing antibiotic therapy during ongoing pneumococcal pneumonia did not impair bacterial killing in lung, blood and spleen. In this setting, ibrutinib reduced alveolar macrophage and systemic neutrophil activation and substantially diminished further monocyte and neutrophil influx in the lung. In vitro, ibrutinib inhibited macrophage TNF secretion and neutrophil activation upon LTA and pneumococcal stimulation.Taken together, these data indicate that the Btk inhibitor ibrutinib reduces inflammatory myeloid cell responses during acute pulmonary inflammation evoked by LTA and antibiotic-treated pneumococcal pneumonia and suggest that ibrutinib has the potential to inhibit ongoing lung inflammation in an acute infectious setting.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667592>First genome-wide association study of non-severe malaria in two birth cohorts in Benin.</a></h2><p>Recent research efforts to identify genes involved in malaria susceptibility using genome-wide approaches have focused on severe malaria. Here, we present the first GWAS on non-severe malaria designed to identify genetic variants involved in innate  or innate resistance mechanisms. Our study was performed on two cohorts of infants from southern Benin (525 and 250 individuals used as discovery and replication cohorts, respectively) closely followed from birth to 18-24 months of age, with an assessment of a space- and time-dependent environmental risk of exposure. Both the recurrence of mild malaria attacks and the recurrence of malaria infections as a whole (symptomatic and asymptomatic) were considered. Post-GWAS functional analyses were performed using positional, eQTL, and chromatin interaction mapping to identify the genes underlying association signals. Our study highlights a role of PTPRT, a  phosphatase receptor involved in STAT3 pathway, in the protection against both mild malaria attacks and malaria infections (p = 9.70 × 10 and p = 1.78 × 10, respectively, in the discovery cohort). Strong statistical support was also found for a role of MYLK4 (meta-analysis, p = 5.29 × 10 with malaria attacks), and for several other genes, whose biological functions are relevant in malaria infection.

Other TKIs, including imatinib and nilotinib, were also developed for treatment of CML, and recent studies were increasing about the therapeutic effects of other TKIs on solid tumors. However, the effect of radotinib on solid tumors has not yet been investigated. In this study, radotinib killed CML cell line K562 directly; however, radotinib did not enhance NK cell cytotoxicity against K562 cells. Because K562 is known as a Fas-negative cell line, we investigated whether radotinib could regulate cell cytotoxicity against various Fas-expressing solid cancer cell lines. Radotinib dramatically increased NK cell cytotoxicity against various Fas-expressing solid cancer cells, including lung, breast, and melanoma cells. Additionally, the efficiency of radotinib-enhanced cytotoxicity was lower in Fas siRNA-transfected cells than in negative controls, suggesting that Fas signaling might be involved in the radotinib-enhanced NK cell cytotoxicity. This study provides the first evidence that radotinib could be used as an effective and strong therapeutic to treat solid tumors via upregulation of NK cell cytotoxicity, suggesting that radotinib has indirect killing mechanisms via upregulation of antitumor innate immune responses as well as direct killing activities for CML cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619358>Bovine Neonatal Monocytes Display Phenotypic Differences Compared With Adults After Challenge With the Infectious Abortifacient Agent .</a></h2><p>The neonatal period represents a window of susceptibility for ruminants given the abundance of infectious challenges in their environment. Maternal transfer of  does not occur  but post-parturition, however this does not compensate for potential deficits in the cellular compartment. Here we present a cellular and transcriptomic study to investigate if there is an age-related difference in the monocyte response in cattle during intra-cellular protozoan infection. We utilized , an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite that causes abortion and negative economic impacts in cattle worldwide, to study these responses. We found neonatal animals had a significant greater percentage of CD14 monocytes with higher CD80 cell surface expression. Adult monocytes harbored more parasites compared to neonatal monocytes; additionally greater secretion of IL-1β was observed in neonates. Microarray analysis revealed neonates have 535 genes significantly upregulated compared to adult with 23 upregulated genes. Biological pathways involved in immune response were evaluated and both age groups showed changes in the upregulation of  phosphorylation of STAT protein and JAK-STAT cascade pathways. However, the extent to which these pathways were upregulated in neonates was much greater. Our findings suggest that neonates are more resistant to cellular invasion with protozoan parasites and that the magnitude of the responses is related to significant changes in the JAK-STAT network.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31399492>Hypofractionated EGFR  kinase inhibitor limits tumor relapse through triggering innate and adaptive .</a></h2><p>Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are a first-line therapy for rapidly killing tumors such as those associated with non-small cell lung cancer by blocking oncogenic receptor signaling, but tumor relapse often occurs. Here, we have observed that hypofractionated EGFR TKI treatment (HypoTKI) is more potent than standard hyperfractionated EGFR TKI treatment (HyperTKI), and its antitumor effect associated with preventing tumor relapse depends on T cells. HypoTKI triggers greater innate sensing for type I IFN and CXCL10 production through the Myd88 signaling pathway to enhance tumor-specific T cell infiltration and reactivation. We also demonstrate that timely programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) blockade can synergize with HypoTKI to control advanced large tumors and effectively limit tumor relapse without severe side effects. Our study provides evidence for exploring the potential of a proper combination of EGFR TKIs and immunotherapy as a first-line treatment for treating EGFR-driven tumors.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

The aim of this study was to determine the role of platelet Btk in vascular integrity and host defence during murine pneumosepsis caused by the common human pathogens  and . Using the Cre-loxP system, male platelet-specific Btk-deficient mice (PF4creBtk/Y) were created. Similar to platelets from total Btk-deficient mice, platelets from PF4creBtk/Y mice showed abrogated aggregation and P-selectin expression when stimulated with the GPVI ligand cross-linked collagen-related peptide. Upon infection with , PF4creBtk/Y mice showed increased lung bleeding, but unimpaired anti-bacterial defence. During pneumosepsis evoked by , platelet Btk deficiency was not associated with lung bleeding and did not impact on host defence, even when platelet function was further compromised by blocking secondary platelet activation by the P2Y receptor antagonist clopidogrel.

Male and female C57BL/6J weanlings were used, initially 19 days of age, and malnutrition was produced using a nitrogen-deficient diet. In preliminary work ten daily subcutaneous 1.0 µg doses of murine Flt3L, comparable to a protocol effective in humans, expanded the splenic conventional dendritic cell compartment (CD11cF4/80) of healthy weanlings without affecting the numbers of lymphocytes, macrophages, or recoverable mononuclear cells. Two subsequent experiments showed that, despite advancing malnutrition, exogenous Flt3L was able both to exert its classic influence on splenic conventional dendritic cell numbers and to invigorate the attenuated primary splenic cell-mediated inflammatory response to sheep erythrocytes. A final experiment showed that the cytokine intervention did not affect dendritic cell maturity according to several phenotypic indices. The findings provide new support for the proposition that dendritic cell numbers are the first limiting factor in the weak cell-mediated immune competence of acute pre-pubescent malnutrition. More substantially, intervention with Flt3L sustained an inflammatory systemic immune character despite progressive weanling malnutrition and weight loss. This outcome provides new support of fundamental character for the Tolerance Model which posits that the cell-mediated inflammatory incompetence of acute pre-pubescent protein and energy deficits is a regulated adaptive attempt, the antithesis of the classic paradigm of unregulated immunological attrition.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the mechanisms and key molecules that mediate the effects of EVs on lymphocytes are unclear.  We used Quantibody Human Cytokine Antibody Array 440 to determine the tumor -related cytokine profile of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) stimulated with EVs derived from peritoneal washes or malignant ascites. We detected 21 upregulated and 27 downregulated proteins, including the immunosuppressive receptors Siglec-10, SLAM, PD-1, and TIM-3.  Flow cytometry analysis of PBLs or ovarian cancer ascites suggested that Siglec-10 expression on CD3+ T cells was higher in ovarian cancer patients than in healthy controls and in the malignant ascites of ovarian cancer patients than in their blood. Moreover, the expression of CD24, the Siglec-10 ligand, was associated with tumor stage and cancer cell metastasis. Finally, compared to the benign peritoneal wash-derived EVs, the malignant EVs significantly upregulated Siglec-10 expression on Jurkat T cells, inhibited the protein kinase C activity induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin, and impaired the phosphorylation of the  kinase ZAP-70 activated by crosslinking with an anti-CD3 antibody.  The EVs secreted by malignant ovarian cells upregulated Siglec-10 expression on T cells and impaired T cell activation in the tumor microenvironment. We believe that a comprehensive understanding of the regulation of Siglec-10 and CD24 by malignant EVs has clinical importance, as it will aid in the development of better immunotherapeutic strategies for ovarian cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30837655>Dual role of the Anopheles coluzzii Venus Kinase Receptor in both larval growth and .</a></h2><p>Vector-borne diseases and especially malaria are responsible for more than half million deaths annually. The increase of insecticide resistance in wild populations of Anopheles malaria vectors emphasises the need for novel vector control strategies as well as for identifying novel vector targets. Venus kinase receptors (VKRs) constitute a Receptor  Kinase (RTK) family only found in invertebrates. In this study we functionally characterized Anopheles VKR in the Gambiae complex member, Anopheles coluzzii. Results showed that Anopheles VKR can be activated by L-amino acids, with L-arginine as the most potent agonist. VKR was not required for the fecundity of A. coluzzii, in contrast to reports from other insects, but VKR function is required in both Anopheles males and females for development of larval progeny. Anopheles VKR function is also required for protection against infection by Plasmodium parasites, thus identifying a novel linkage between reproduction and  in Anopheles. The insect specificity of VKRs as well as the essential function for reproduction and  suggest that Anopheles VKR could be a potentially druggable target for novel vector control strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30387778>Crystal structures and kinetics of N-acetylneuraminate lyase from Fusobacterium nucleatum.</a></h2><p>N-Acetyl-D-neuraminic acid lyase (NanA) catalyzes the breakdown of sialic acid (Neu5Ac) to N-acetyl-D-mannosamine (ManNAc) and pyruvate. NanA plays a key role in Neu5Ac catabolism in many pathogenic and bacterial commensals where sialic acid is available as a carbon and nitrogen source.

In this study, atomic resolution structures of NanA from Fusobacterium nucleatum (FnNanA) in ligand-free and ligand-bound forms are reported at 2.32 and 1.76 Å resolution, respectively. F. nucleatum is a Gram-negative pathogen that causes gingival and periodontal diseases in human hosts.

Although pain and psychological factors influence fatigue, there is an increasing understanding that there is a genetic basis, and that activation of the innate immune system is an essential generator of fatigue. Mast cells are important actors in innate  and serve specialized defense responses against parasites and other pathogens. They are also major effector cells in allergic reactions. Primary disorders causing constitutively hyperactivity of mast cells are called mastocytosis and are frequently due to a gain-of-function mutation of the KIT gene encoding the transmembrane  kinase receptor.

By contrast, serine phosphorylation (pS) of STAT3 can augment its nuclear transcriptional activity and promote essential mitochondrial functions, yet the role of pS-STAT3 among epithelial cancers is ill-defined. Here, we reveal that genetic ablation of pS-STAT3 in the   spontaneous gastric cancer mouse model and human gastric cancer cell line xenografts abrogated tumor growth that coincided with reduced proliferative potential of the tumor epithelium. Microarray gene expression profiling demonstrated that the suppressed gastric tumorigenesis in pS-STAT3-deficient   mice associated with reduced transcriptional activity of STAT3-regulated gene networks implicated in cell proliferation and migration, inflammation, and angiogenesis, but not mitochondrial function or metabolism. Notably, the protumorigenic activity of pS-STAT3 aligned with its capacity to primarily augment RNA polymerase II-mediated transcriptional elongation, but not initiation, of STAT3 target genes. Furthermore, by using a combinatorial  and  proteomics approach based on the rapid immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry of endogenous protein (RIME) assay, we identified RuvB-like AAA ATPase 1 (RUVBL1/Pontin) and enhancer of rudimentary homolog (ERH) as interacting partners of pS-STAT3 that are pivotal for its transcriptional activity on STAT3 target genes. Collectively, these findings uncover a hitherto unknown transcriptional role and obligate requirement for pS-STAT3 in gastric cancer that could be extrapolated to other STAT3-driven cancers.

Here we identify a variant of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) with a Gly→Arg substitution (hIgG1-G396R), which positively correlates with systemic lupus erythematosus. In induced lupus models, murine homolog Gly→Arg (G390R) knockin mice generate excessive numbers of plasma cells, leading to a burst of broad-spectrum autoantibodies. This enhanced production of antibodies is also observed in hapten-immunized G390R mice, as well as in influenza-vaccinated human G396R homozygous carriers. This variant potentiates the phosphorylation of the IgG1 immunoglobulin tail  (ITT) motif. This, in turn, alters the availability of phospho-ITT to trigger longer adaptor protein Grb2 dwell times in immunological synapses, leading to hyper-Grb2-Bruton's  kinase (Btk) signaling upon antigen binding. Thus, the hIgG1-G396R variant is important for both lupus pathogenesis and antibody responses after vaccination.Copyright © 2018 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

However, the function of avian TYK2 in innate immune response remains largely unknown. In this study, the full-length duck TYK2 (duTYK2) cDNA was cloned for the first time, which encoded a putative protein of 1187 amino acid residues and showed the high sequence similarity with bald eagle, crested ibis, and white-tailed tropicbird TYK2s. The duTYK2 was widely expressed in all examined tissues of healthy ducks and showed diffuse cytoplasmic localization in duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs). Overexpression of duTYK2 significantly enhanced ISRE promoter activity and induced the expression of viperin, PKR, 2',5'-OAS, Mx and ZAP in DEFs. The C-terminal kinase domain of duTYK2 is essential for duTYK2-mediated ISRE promoter activation. Furthermore, knockdown of duTYK2 dramatically decreased duck Tembusu virus (DTMUV)-, duck enteritis virus (DEV)-, poly(I:C)- or poly(dA:dT)-induced ISRE promoter activation.

In particular, BCAP suppresses inflammatory signaling by Toll-like receptors (TLRs). However, how BCAP itself is regulated and what its interaction partners are is unclear. Here, using human immune cell lines, including THP-1 cells, we characterized the complex phosphorylation patterns of BCAP and used a novel protein complex trapping strategy, called virotrap, to identify its interaction partners. This analysis identified known interactions of BCAP with phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) p85 subunit and NCK adaptor protein (NCK), together with previously unknown interactions of BCAP with SH2 and SH3 domain-containing adaptor proteins, notably growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) and CRK-like proto-oncogene, adaptor protein (CRKL). We show that the SH3 domain of GRB2 can bind to BCAP independently of BCAP phosphorylation status, suggesting that the SH2 domains mediate interactions with activated receptor  kinase complexes including the CD19 subunit of the B-cell receptor. Our results also suggested that the PI3K p85 subunit binds to BCAP via SH3 domains forming an inactive complex that is then activated by sequential binding with the SH2 domains. Taken together, our results indicate that BCAP is a complex hub that processes signals from multiple pathways in diverse cell types of the immune system.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30949760>Evaluation of CD33 as a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.</a></h2><p>In 2011, genome-wide association studies implicated a polymorphism near CD33 as a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. This finding sparked interest in this member of the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectin family which is linked to innate . Subsequent studies found that CD33 is expressed in microglia in the brain and then investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the CD33 genetic association with Alzheimer's disease. The allele that protects from Alzheimer's disease acts predominately to increase a CD33 isoform lacking exon 2 at the expense of the prototypic, full-length CD33 that contains exon 2. Since this exon encodes the sialic acid ligand-binding domain, the finding that the loss of exon 2 was associated with decreased Alzheimer's disease risk was interpreted as meaning that a decrease in functional CD33 and its associated immune suppression was protective from Alzheimer's disease. However, this interpretation may need to be reconsidered given current findings that a genetic deletion which abrogates CD33 is not associated with Alzheimer's disease risk. Therefore, integrating currently available findings leads us to propose a model wherein the CD33 isoform lacking the ligand-binding domain represents a gain of function variant that reduces Alzheimer's disease risk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666931>T-helper 1-type cytokines induce apoptosis and loss of HER-family oncodriver expression in murine and human breast cancer cells.</a></h2><p>A recent neoadjuvant vaccine trial for early breast cancer induced strong Th1  against the HER-2 oncodriver, complete pathologic responses in 18% of subjects, and for many individuals, dramatically reduced HER-2 expression on residual disease. To explain these observations, we investigated actions of Th1 cytokines (TNF-α and IFN-γ) on murine and human breast cancer cell lines that varied in the surface expression of HER-family receptor  kinases. Breast cancer lines were broadly sensitive to the combination of IFN-γ and TNF-α, as evidenced by lower metabolic activity, lower proliferation, and enhanced apoptosis, and in some cases a reversible inhibition of surface expression of HER proteins. Apoptosis was accompanied by caspase-3 activation. Furthermore, the pharmacologic caspase-3 activator PAC-1 mimicked both the killing effects and HER-2-suppressive activities of Th1 cytokines, while a caspase 3/7 inhibitor could prevent cytokine-induced HER-2 loss. These studies demonstrate that many  effects of vaccination (apparent tumor cell death and loss of HER-2 expression) could be replicated  using only the principle Th1 cytokines. These results are consistent with the notion that IFN-γ and TNF-α work in concert to mediate many biological effects of therapeutic vaccination through the induction of a caspase 3-associated cellular death mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30571460>Macrophage Inflammation, Erythrophagocytosis, and Accelerated Atherosclerosis in Jak2  Mice.</a></h2><p>The mechanisms driving atherothrombotic risk in individuals with JAK2  ( Jak2 ) positive clonal hematopoiesis or myeloproliferative neoplasms are poorly understood.The goal of this study was to assess atherosclerosis and underlying mechanisms in hypercholesterolemic mice with hematopoietic Jak2  expression.Irradiated low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout ( Ldlr) mice were transplanted with bone marrow from wild-type or Jak2  mice and fed a high-fat high-cholesterol Western diet. Hematopoietic functions and atherosclerosis were characterized. After 7 weeks of Western diet, Jak2  mice showed increased atherosclerosis. Early atherosclerotic lesions showed increased neutrophil adhesion and content, correlating with lesion size. After 12 weeks of Western diet, Jak2  lesions showed increased complexity, with larger necrotic cores, defective efferocytosis, prominent iron deposition, and costaining of erythrocytes and macrophages, suggesting erythrophagocytosis. Jak2  erythrocytes were more susceptible to phagocytosis by wild-type macrophages and showed decreased surface expression of CD47, a "don't-eat-me" signal. Human JAK2VF erythrocytes were also more susceptible to erythrophagocytosis. Jak2  macrophages displayed increased expression and production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, prominent inflammasome activation, increased p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling, and reduced levels of MerTK (c-Mer  kinase), a key molecule mediating efferocytosis. Increased erythrophagocytosis also suppressed efferocytosis.Hematopoietic Jak2  expression promotes early lesion formation and increased complexity in advanced atherosclerosis. In addition to increasing hematopoiesis and neutrophil infiltration in early lesions, Jak2  caused cellular defects in erythrocytes and macrophages, leading to increased erythrophagocytosis but defective efferocytosis. These changes promote accumulation of iron in plaques and increased necrotic core formation which, together with exacerbated proinflammatory responses, likely contribute to plaque instability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31333682>Route of Vaccine Administration Influences the Impact of Fms-Like  Kinase 3 Ligand (Flt3L) on Chlamydial-Specific Protective Immune Responses.</a></h2><p>We tested the hypothesis that the impact of the Fms-like  kinase 3-ligand (Flt3L; FL) on recombinant  ghost (rVCG) vaccine-induced chlamydial  is influenced by route of vaccine delivery. Female C57BL/6J mice were immunized rectally (IR) or intramuscularly (IM) with rVCG co-expressing the  PmpD and PorB proteins (rVCG- PmpD/PorB) with and without FL or glycoprotein D of HSV-2 (rVCG-gD2) as antigen control. Vaccine evaluation was based on measurement of T cell proliferation, Th1/Th2 cytokine, and humoral responses at systemic and mucosal compartments, and protection against intravaginal challenge infection. Results revealed that high levels of CD4+ T cell-mediated and humoral immune responses, were elicited in mice as a function of both IR and IM immunization. Unexpectedly, co-administration of vaccine with FL enhanced specific Th1-type cytokine levels and T cell proliferative responses following IR but not IM immunization. While administration of vaccine with FL enhanced the specific mucosal and systemic IgA antibody responses following both immunization routes, IgG2c responses were not enhanced following IR delivery. The vaccine-induced immune effectors protected mice against live heterologous  infection irrespective of route of vaccine administration, with the regimen incorporating FL having a protective advantage. Further evaluation showed that protection afforded by the FL adjuvanted vaccine was facilitated by CD4+ T cells, as indicated by reduction in the intensity and duration of genital chlamydial shedding by naïve mice following adoptive transfer of immune CD4+ T cells. Taken together, the results indicate that comparable protective , which is enhanced by co-delivery with FL, is elicited in the female genital tract against  infection after mucosal and systemic administration, highlighting the ability of FL to function as an effective immunostimulator at both mucosal and systemic sites. The differential modulation of humoral and cellular immune responses, and protective  afforded by the FL adjuvanted vaccine following IR administration indicates that the immunomodulatory impact of FL on chlamydial-specific  is influenced by the route of vaccine administration. Thus, targeting of VCG-based vaccines to antigen presenting cells by co-delivery with FL is a feasible immunization approach for inducing effective chlamydial  in the female genital tract.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30540534>G-protein-coupled formyl peptide receptors play a dual role in neutrophil chemotaxis and bacterial phagocytosis.</a></h2><p>A dogma of innate  is that neutrophils use G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) for chemoattractant to chase bacteria through chemotaxis and then use phagocytic receptors coupled with  kinases to destroy opsonized bacteria via phagocytosis. Our current work showed that G-protein-coupled formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) directly mediate neutrophil phagocytosis. Mouse neutrophils lacking formyl peptide receptors (Fpr1/2) are defective in the phagocytosis of Escherichia coli and the chemoattractant N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP)-coated beads. fMLP immobilized onto the surface of a bead interacts with FPRs, which trigger a Ca response and induce actin polymerization to form a phagocytic cup for engulfment of the bead. This chemoattractant GPCR/Gi signaling works independently of phagocytic receptor/ kinase signaling to promote phagocytosis. Thus, in addition to phagocytic receptor-mediated phagocytosis, neutrophils also utilize the chemoattractant GPCR/Gi signaling to mediate phagocytosis to fight against invading bacteria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31444334>Single-cell profiling guided combinatorial immunotherapy for fast-evolving CDK4/6 inhibitor-resistant HER2-positive breast cancer.</a></h2><p>Acquired resistance to targeted cancer therapy is a significant clinical challenge. In parallel with clinical trials combining CDK4/6 inhibitors to treat HER2+ breast cancer, we sought to prospectively model tumor evolution in response to this regimen in vivo and identify a clinically actionable strategy to combat drug resistance. Despite a promising initial response, acquired resistance emerges rapidly to the combination of anti-HER2/neu antibody and CDK4/6 inhibitor Palbociclib. Using high-throughput single-cell profiling over the course of treatments, we reveal a distinct immunosuppressive immature myeloid cell (IMC) population to infiltrate the resistant tumors. Guided by single-cell transcriptome analysis, we demonstrate that combination of IMC-targeting  kinase inhibitor cabozantinib and immune checkpoint blockade enhances anti-tumor , and overcomes the resistance. Furthermore, sequential combinatorial immunotherapy enables a sustained control of the fast-evolving CDK4/6 inhibitor-resistant tumors.

To address this, a CT-26 colon cancer xenograft model was established in mice since this cell line is insensitive to SHP099. Consequently, SHP099 minimally affected CT-26 tumor growth in immuno-deficient nude mice, but significantly decreased the tumor burden in CT-26 tumor-bearing mice with intact immune system. SHP099 augmented anti-tumor , as shown by the elevated proportion of CD8IFN-  T cells and the upregulation of cytotoxic T-cell related genes including , which decreased the tumor load. In addition, tumor growth in mice with SHP2-deficient T-cells was markedly slowed down because of enhanced anti-tumor responses. Finally, the combination of SHP099 and anti-PD-1 antibody showed a higher therapeutic efficacy than either monotherapy in controlling tumor growth in two colon cancer xenograft models, indicating that these agents complement each other.

Triple‑negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 15‑20% of all breast cancers and is defined by its aggressive nature and limited treatment options. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop effective therapies for TNBC in order to improve breast cancer outcomes, as targeted therapies have done in other subtypes of breast cancer. Discoidin domain receptor  kinase 1 (DDR1) is activated by collagens, which are important components of the tumor stroma; therefore, DDR1 may serve a critical role in the communication between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment. The aim of the present study was to determine how tumor DDR1 regulated tumor growth by affecting tumor infiltrated T cells. First, the DDR1 expression levels from a cohort of patients with breast cancer were analyzed. The results revealed that there were higher levels of DDR1 expression in tumor tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. Overexpression of DDR1 in 4T1 cells promoted tumor growth in vivo, while knockout of DDR1 in EMT6 cells decreased tumor growth in vivo. In addition, it was revealed that DDR1 regulated tumor growth by modulating tumor infiltrating T cells, CD4+ and CD8+. Furthermore, inhibition of DDR1 by neutralizing antibodies decreased breast cancer growth in vivo. To the best of our knowledge, the results of the present study demonstrated for the first time that DDR1 expressed on the tumor cells promoted breast tumor growth by suppressing antitumor . The present findings indicated that DDR1 may not only have a critical role in the progression of breast cancer, but may also serve as a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer, particularly TNBC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30381052>The Synthesis of Sulfated CCR5 Peptide Surrogates and their Use to Study Receptor-Ligand Interactions.</a></h2><p> sulfation is an important post-translational modification of secreted and membrane proteins in multi-cellular organisms. This modification is catalyzed by tyrosylprotein sulfotransferases that often modify  residues in their target substrates in a heterogeneous manner. Chemokine receptors such as CCR5, which play roles in inflammation,  and viral infection, are sulfated on  residues in their extracellular N-termini. The heterogeneity of the sulfation has made it difficult to obtain atomic-resolution information on this region of CCR5.

However, the underlying mechanism in invertebrates is largely unknown. Integrin/focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling pathway modulates the apoptosis in vertebrates. In this study, a novel FAK was identified from A. japonicus (designated as AjFAK) by β-integrin (designated as AjITGB) -mediated GST-pull down assay. This interaction was further validated in the LPS-exposed coelomocytes through co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence analyses. To investigate the functional role of AjFAK in AjITGB-mediated coelomocyte apoptosis, we cloned the full-length cDNA of AjFAK and characterized its relationship with AjITGB through real-time PCR. The mRNA expression levels of AjFAK exhibited consistent expression patterns with those of AjITGB in our previous work with 0.48- and 0.22-fold decreases at 12 and 96 h in LPS-exposed coelomocytes and in Vibrio splendidus challenged sea cucumber, respectively. Moreover, the expression level of AjFAK decreased to 0.35-fold in AjITGB knockdown treatment by specific small interference RNA (siRNA). We further performed an assay for the apoptotic rate of coelomocytes in AjITGB, AjFAK, and AjITGB/AjFAK silencing conditions and found that their apoptotic percentages increased to 26%, 25%, and 30%, respectively, compared with those of the control. Finally, the expression levels of four caspases from A. japonicus were also investigated to determine the apoptotic effector. After AjITGB or AjFAK was silenced, the mRNA levels of caspase-3 were 6.6-fold and 2.5-fold higher than those of the control, respectively. In addition, the enzymatic activity of caspase-3 was enhanced to 1.82- and 1.79-fold that of the control in the two groups. However, no significant changes were detected in caspase-2/6/8.

Exosomes and microRNAs are closely associated with collagen in cancer. Hypoxia, which is common in collagen-rich conditions, intensifies cancer progression, and other substances in the extracellular matrix, such as fibronectin, hyaluronic acid, laminin, and matrix metalloproteinases, interact with collagen to influence cancer cell activity. Macrophages, lymphocytes, and fibroblasts play a role with collagen in cancer  and progression.

Contact residues, shown to be critical for binding of the respective human and murine PD-1 ligands are mostly conserved between avian and mammalian species, whereas residues that define the cytoplasmic immunoreceptor -based inhibitory motif (ITIM) and immunoreceptor -based switch motif (ITSM) are highly conserved across higher vertebrates and frog. Constitutive expression of duPD-1 transcripts was predominantly found in lymphocyte-rich tissues, and mitogen-stimulation of duck peripheral blood mononuclear cells transiently increased duPD-1 mRNA expression. A soluble duPD-1 protein was expressed and shown to engage the identified duck PD-1 ligands. Our observations show considerable evolutionary conservation between mammalian and avian PD-1 orthologues. This work will facilitate further investigation of the role of PD-1 signaling in adaptive  in the Pekin duck, a non-mammalian vertebrate and pathogen host with relevance for human and animal health.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, the role of ET in systemic anthrax is unclear. Efferocytosis is a cAMP-sensitive, anti-inflammatory process of apoptotic cell engulfment, the inhibition of which may promote sepsis in systemic anthrax. Here, we tested the hypothesis that ET inhibits efferocytosis by primary human macrophages and evaluated the mechanisms of altered efferocytic signaling. ET, but not PA or EF alone, inhibited the efferocytosis of early apoptotic neutrophils (PMN) by primary human M2 macrophages (polarized with IL-4, IL-10, and/or dexamethasone) at concentrations relevant to those encountered in systemic infection. ET inhibited Protein S- and MFGE8-dependent efferocytosis initiated by signaling through MerTK and αVβ5 receptors, respectively. ET inhibited Rac1 activation as well as the phosphorylation of Rac1 and key activating sites of calcium calmodulin-dependent kinases CamK1α, CamK4, and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, that were induced by the exposure of M2(Dex) macrophages to Protein S-opsonized apoptotic PMN. These results show that ET impairs macrophage efferocytosis and alters efferocytic receptor signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31316206>Intestinal infection triggers Parkinson's disease-like symptoms in Pink1 mice.</a></h2><p>Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder with motor symptoms linked to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra compacta. Although the mechanisms that trigger the loss of dopaminergic neurons are unclear, mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation are thought to have key roles. An early-onset form of Parkinson's disease is associated with mutations in the PINK1 kinase and PRKN ubiquitin ligase genes. PINK1 and Parkin (encoded by PRKN) are involved in the clearance of damaged mitochondria in cultured cells, but recent evidence obtained using knockout and knockin mouse models have led to contradictory results regarding the contributions of PINK1 and Parkin to mitophagy in vivo. It has previously been shown that PINK1 and Parkin have a key role in adaptive  by repressing presentation of mitochondrial antigens, which suggests that autoimmune mechanisms participate in the aetiology of Parkinson's disease. Here we show that intestinal infection with Gram-negative bacteria in Pink1 mice engages mitochondrial antigen presentation and autoimmune mechanisms that elicit the establishment of cytotoxic mitochondria-specific CD8 T cells in the periphery and in the brain. Notably, these mice show a sharp decrease in the density of dopaminergic axonal varicosities in the striatum and are affected by motor impairment that is reversed after treatment with L-DOPA. These data support the idea that PINK1 is a repressor of the immune system, and provide a pathophysiological model in which intestinal infection acts as a triggering event in Parkinson's disease, which highlights the relevance of the gut-brain axis in the disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30377944>AAV-Vectored Fms-Related  Kinase 3 Ligand Inhibits CD34 Progenitor Cell Engraftment in Humanized Mice.</a></h2><p>Humanized mice have become useful animal models for HIV/AIDS. Since NOD.Cg-Prkdc scid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice allow the engraftment of primary human immune cells, we aim to determine the role of human Fms-related  kinase 3 ligand (hFlt3L), a major growth factor for dendritic cells (DCs), in regulating the differentiation of cord blood-derived CD34 progenitor cells in this murine species. Soluble recombinant hFlt3L protein and AAV-vectored hFlt3L were administrated before or after human CD34 progenitor cell transplantation, respectively. We then measured the peripheral levels of hFlt3L by ELISA. Meantime, reconstituted human immune cells were analyzed by flow cytometry over time. We found that without hFlt3L there were significantly increased types of human immune cells in NSG-huCD34 compared with NSG-huPBL mice but the frequency of human DCs remains low. Transient treatment with recombinant hFlt3L expanded human conventional CD1c and CD141 DCs as well as plasmacytoid DCs in humanized NSG-huCD34 mice. Surprisingly, however, the prolonged in vivo expression of AAV-vectored hFlt3L resulted in significant suppression of total human CD34 cell engraftment and differentiation. The suppression occurred within 2 weeks when AAV-vectored hFlt3L was administered either before or after the transplantation of CD34 progenitor cells, which was likely associated with the induction of murine myeloid-derived immune suppressive cells and reactive oxygen species in NSG-huCD34 mice. Since chronic  HIV-1 patients displayed significantly high levels of hFlt3L expression, our findings may have implication to explore the role of prolonged hFlt3L in regulating  the differentiation of human CD34 progenitor cells in both NSG-huCD34 mice and infected people.

Microenvironmental stresses such as hypoxia and various resistance mechanisms promote carcinoma cell plasticity. AXL, a member of the TAM (Tyro3, Axl, and Mer) receptor  kinase family, is widely expressed in human cancers and increasingly recognized for its role in cell plasticity and drug resistance. To investigate mechanisms of immune resistance, we studied multiple human lung cancer clones derived from a model of hypoxia-induced tumor plasticity that exhibited mesenchymal or epithelial features. We demonstrate that AXL expression is increased in mesenchymal lung cancer clones. Expression of AXL in the cells correlated with increased cancer cell-intrinsic resistance to both natural killer (NK)- and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated killing. A small-molecule targeting AXL sensitized mesenchymal lung cancer cells to cytotoxic lymphocyte-mediated killing. Mechanistically, we showed that attenuation of AXL-dependent immune resistance involved a molecular network comprising NF-κB activation, increased ICAM1 expression, and upregulation of ULBP1 expression coupled with MAPK inhibition. Higher ICAM1 and ULBP1 tumor expression correlated with improved patient survival in two non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cohorts. These results reveal an AXL-mediated immune-escape regulatory pathway, suggest AXL as a candidate biomarker for tumor resistance to NK and CTL , and support AXL targeting to optimize immune response in NSCLC.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30738042>Exchange protein directly activated by cAMP plays a critical role in regulation of vascular fibrinolysis.</a></h2><p>Plasmin-mediated fibrinolysis at the surface of vascular endothelial cells (SVEC) plays a key role in maintaining vascular hemostasis, in which the cAMP pathway participates. After externalization to the SVEC, annexin A2 (ANXA2) serves as a platform for conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. Here we describe a regulatory role of the exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC) in ANXA2 externalization and vascular fibrinolysis. Knockout of EPAC1 in mice results in a decreased ANXA2 expression on the SVEC associated with increased fibrin deposition and fibrinolytic dysfunction. Reduced levels of EPAC1 are also found in endocardial tissues beneath atrial mural thrombi in patients. Notably, administration of recombinant ANXA2 ameliorates fibrinolytic dysfunction in the EPAC1-null mice. Mechanistically, EPAC1 regulates the SVEC plasminogen conversion depended on ANXA2. EPAC1 promotes -23 phosphorylation of ANXA2, a prerequisite for its recruitment to the SVEC. Our data thus reveal a novel regulatory role for EPAC1 in vascular fibrinolysis.Copyright © 2019.

(). Mutational studies and targeted proteomics revealed that the RaxX precursor peptide (proRaxX) is processed and secreted by the protease/transporter RaxB, the function of which can be partially fulfilled by a noncognate peptidase-containing transporter component B (PctB). proRaxX is cleaved at a Gly-Gly motif, yielding a mature peptide that retains the necessary elements for RaxX function as an immunogen and host peptide hormone mimic. These results indicate that RaxX is a prokaryotic member of a previously unclassified and understudied group of eukaryotic  sulfated ribosomally synthesized, posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs). We further demonstrate that sulfated RaxX directly binds XA21 with high affinity.

The kinetic proofreading model can explain T cell antigen receptor (TCR) ligand discrimination; however, the rate-limiting steps have not been identified. Here, we show that  phosphorylation of the T cell adapter protein LAT at position Y132 is a critical kinetic bottleneck for ligand discrimination. LAT phosphorylation at Y132, mediated by the kinase ZAP-70, leads to the recruitment and activation of phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1), an important effector molecule for T cell activation. The slow phosphorylation of Y132, relative to other phosphosites on LAT, is governed by a preceding glycine residue (G131) but can be accelerated by substituting this glycine with aspartate or glutamate. Acceleration of Y132 phosphorylation increases the speed and magnitude of PLC-γ1 activation and enhances T cell sensitivity to weaker stimuli, including weak agonists and self-peptides. These observations suggest that the slow phosphorylation of Y132 acts as a proofreading step to facilitate T cell ligand discrimination.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31357836>[Anti-lung cancer effect of myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cell combined vaccines loaded with tumor cell lysates in vitro].</a></h2><p> To investigate the feasibility of myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cell combined vaccines loaded with heat-treated Lewis lung cancer cell lysates for treatment of lung cancer in mice.  Bone marrow cells were induced by the recombinant mouse fms-like  kinase receptor 3 ligand (rmFlt3-L) in vitro, myeloid dendritic cells (mDC) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) were separated by magnetic beads. The mDC, pDC, and mDC∶pDC=1∶1 were stimulated with heat-treated Lewis lung cancer cell lysates, respectively. The effects of each group on stimulating of lymphocyte proliferation and inducing of T cell to kill tumor cells in vitro were compared. The alternations of the immunophenotypes of CD80, CD86, CD40 and major histocompatibility complex Ⅱ (MHC-Ⅱ) were detected by flow cytometry. The secretion of cytokines including interlukin-12 (IL-12), interlukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).  The lymphocyte proliferation in mice stimulated with mDC+ pDC group loaded with heat-treated Lewis lung cancer cell lysates was 10.80±0.66, significantly higher than 8.63±0.65 of mDC group and 7.10±0.46 pDC group under the same culture conditions, respectively (<0.05). When the ratio of effector cells: target cells (E∶T) was 10∶1, the killing rate of the mDC+ pDC group loaded with heat-treated tumor cell lysate was 31.68%±2.93%, significantly higher than 17.44%±0.97% of mDC group and 10.29%±1.33% of pDC group, respectively (<0.05). When the ratio of E∶T was 20∶1, the killing rate of the mDC+ pDC group loaded with heat-treated tumor cell lysate was 54.77%±3.28%, significantly higher than 35.25%±1.51% of mDC group and 15.52%±0.73% of pDC group, respectively (<0.05). When the ratio of E∶T was 40∶1, the killing rate of the mDC+ pDC group loaded with heat-treated tumor cell lysate was 73.01%±0.91%, significantly higher than 51.36%±0.58% of mDC group and 22.65%±1.28% of pDC group, respectively (<0.05). With the rate of E∶T increased, the killing rate also increased. The mean fluorescence intensities of surface molecules including CD80, CD86, CD40 and MHC-Ⅱ of mDC: pDC=1 group pulsed with heat-treated Lewis lung cancer cell lysates were higher than those of mDC group and pDC group. The IL-6 cytokine concentrations of mDC+ pDC group, mDC group and pDC group loaded with heat-treated Lewis lung cancer cell lysates were (586.67±52.52) pg/ml, (323.33±67.14) pg/ml and (166.67±16.07) pg/ml, respectively. The concentrations of IL-12 in each group were (2 568.75±119.24) pg/ml, (2 156.25±120.55) pg/ml and (672.92±31.46) pg/ml, respectively. The concentrations of TNF-α in each group were (789.33±48.08) pg/ml, (584.89±116.49) pg/ml and (291.56±40.73) pg/ml, respectively. The concentrations of IL-6, IL-12 and TNF-α secreted by mDC+ pDC group were much higher than those of mDC group and pDC group under the same culture conditions (<0.05).  The mDCs and pDCs combined vaccines pulsed with heat-treated Lewis lung cancer cell lysates have synergistic effects on inducing of T lymphocyte proliferation and killing tumor cells in vitro. This synergistic anti-tumor effect is related with up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules and increased secretion of cytokines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30307695>Remodeling Tumor-Associated Macrophages and Neovascularization Overcomes EGFR -Associated Drug Resistance by PD-L1 Nanobody-Mediated Codelivery.</a></h2><p>Precision medicine has made a significant breakthrough in the past decade. The most representative success is the molecular targeting therapy of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)  kinase inhibitors (TKI) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with oncogenic drivers, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as first-line therapeutics for substituting chemotherapy. However, the rapidly developed TKI resistance invariably leads to unsustainable treatment. For example, gefitinib is the first choice for advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutation, but most patients would soon develop secondary EGFR mutation and acquire gefitinib resistance. TKI resistance is a severe emergency issue to be solved in NSCLC, but there are a few investigations of nanomedicine reported to address this pressing problem. To overcome EGFR -associated drug resistance, a novel delivery and therapeutic strategy is developed. A PD-L1 nanobody is identified, and first used as a targeting ligand for liposomal codelivery. It is found that simvastatin/gefitinib combination nanomedicine can remodel the tumor microenvironment (e.g., neovascularization regulation, M2-macrophage repolarization, and innate ), and display the effectiveness of reversing the gefitinib resistance and enhancing the EGFR -mutated NSCLC treatment outcomes. The novel simvastatin-based nanomedicine provides a clinically translatable strategy for tackling the major problem in NSCLC treatment and demonstrates the promise of an old drug for new application.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

CARs are synthetic receptors that redirect T cells towards a tumour-associated antigen and activate them through various fused signalling regions, for example derived from CD3ζ, 4-1BB or CD28. Analysis of the optimal combination of CAR components including signalling domains is not yet comprehensive and may vary with the particular application. The C-terminus of the T-cell surface receptor CD6 is critical for its co-stimulatory effects and signals through two phospho- motifs that bind to the intracellular adaptor proteins GADS and SLP-76. Addition of the C terminus of CD6 did not compromise CAR expression, showing it was a stable moiety that can be used independently of the native receptor. A third-generation CAR containing 4-1BB, CD3ζ and the C terminus of CD6 (4-1BBz-CD6) enhanced interferon-γ release and cytotoxicity when compared with the second-generation 4-1BB CD3ζ (4-1BBz) CAR. The CD6 C terminus is a valuable addition to potential components for modular design of CARs to improve effector function, particularly cytotoxicity.© 2018 The Authors.

However, cellular-intrinsic regulation of NF-κB activity during inflammatory diseases remains incompletely understood. Ubiquitin-like protein 4A (UBL4A, GdX) is a small adaptor protein involved in protein folding, biogenesis and transcription. Yet, whether GdX has a role during innate immune response is largely unknown.  To investigate the involvement of GdX in innate , we challenged GdX-deficient mice with lipopolysaccharides (LPS). To investigate the underlying mechanism, we performed RNA sequencing, real-time PCR, ELISA, luciferase reporter assay, immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses, flow cytometry, and structure analyses. To investigate whether GdX functions in inflammatory bowel disease, we generated dendritic cell (DC), macrophage (Mφ), epithelial-cell specific GdX-deficient mice and induced colitis with dextran sulfate sodium.  GdX enhances DC and Mφ-mediated innate immune defenses by positively regulating NF-κB signaling. GdX-deficient mice were resistant to LPS-induced endotoxin shock and DSS-induced colitis. DC- or Mφ- specific GdX-deficient mice displayed alleviated mucosal inflammation. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by GdX-deficient DCs and Mφ was reduced. Mechanistically, we found that -protein phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2, TC45) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) form a complex with RelA (p65) to mediate its dephosphorylation whereas GdX interrupts the TC45/PP2A/p65 complex formation and restrict p65 dephosphorylation by trapping TC45.  Our study provides a mechanism by which NF-κB signaling is positively regulated by an adaptor protein GdX in DC or Mφ to maintain the innate immune response. Targeting GdX could be a strategy to reduce over-activated immune response in inflammatory diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31296851>Zinc-binding to the cytoplasmic PAS domain regulates the essential WalK histidine kinase of Staphylococcus aureus.</a></h2><p>WalKR (YycFG) is the only essential two-component regulator in the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. WalKR regulates peptidoglycan synthesis, but this function alone does not explain its essentiality. Here, to further understand WalKR function, we investigate a suppressor mutant that arose when WalKR activity was impaired; a histidine to  substitution (H271Y) in the cytoplasmic Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain of the histidine kinase WalK. Introducing the WalK mutation into wild-type S. aureus activates the WalKR regulon. Structural analyses of the WalK PAS domain reveal a metal-binding site, in which a zinc ion (Zn) is tetrahedrally-coordinated by four amino acids including H271. The WalK mutation abrogates metal binding, increasing WalK kinase activity and WalR phosphorylation. Thus, Zn-binding negatively regulates WalKR. Promoter-reporter experiments using S. aureus confirm Zn sensing by this system. Identification of a metal ligand recognized by the WalKR system broadens our understanding of this critical S. aureus regulon.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31018963>Multiple conformational states of the HPK1 kinase domain in complex with sunitinib reveal the structural changes accompanying HPK1 trans-regulation.</a></h2><p>Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1 or MAP4K1) is a Ser/Thr kinase that operates via the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways to dampen the T-cell response and antitumor . Accordingly, selective HPK1 inhibition is considered a means to enhance antitumor . Sunitinib, a multi-receptor  kinase (RTK) inhibitor approved for the management of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and pancreatic cancer, has been reported to inhibit HPK1  In this report, we describe the crystal structures of the native HPK1 kinase domain in both nonphosphorylated and doubly phosphorylated states, in addition to a double phosphomimetic mutant (T165E,S171E), each complexed with sunitinib at 2.17-3.00-Å resolutions. The native nonphosphorylated cocrystal structure revealed an inactive dimer in which the activation loop of each monomer partially occupies the ATP- and substrate-binding sites of the partner monomer. In contrast, the structure of the protein with a doubly phosphorylated activation loop exhibited an active kinase conformation with a greatly reduced monomer-monomer interface. Conversely, the phosphomimetic mutant cocrystal structure disclosed an alternative arrangement in which the activation loops are in an extended domain-swapped configuration. These structural results indicate that HPK1 is a highly dynamic kinase that undergoes trans-regulation via dimer formation and extensive intramolecular and intermolecular remodeling of the activation segment.© 2019 Johnson et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30655520>TCR microclusters form spatially segregated domains and sequentially assemble in calcium-dependent kinetic steps.</a></h2><p>Engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR) by stimulatory ligand results in the rapid formation of microclusters at sites of T cell activation.

Here we show, using TIRF-SIM to examine the organization of microclusters at sub-diffraction resolution, the presence of two spatially distinct domains composed of ZAP70-bound TCR and LAT-associated signaling complex. Kinetic analysis of microcluster assembly reveal surprising delays between the stepwise recruitment of ZAP70 and signaling proteins to the TCR, as well as distinct patterns in their disassociation.

A variant in protein  phosphatase non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) is associated with reduced risk of developing IBD, but promotes the onset of autoimmune disorders. While the role of PTPN22 in modulating molecular pathways involved in IBD pathogenesis is well studied, its impact on shaping the intestinal microbiota has not been addressed in depth. Here, we demonstrate that mice carrying the PTPN22 variant (619W mice) were protected from acute dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis, but suffered from pronounced inflammation upon chronic DSS treatment. The basal microbiota composition was distinct between genotypes, and DSS-induced dysbiosis was milder in 619W mice than in WT littermates. Transfer of microbiota from 619W mice after the first DSS cycle into treatment-naive 619W mice promoted colitis, indicating that changes in microbial composition enhanced chronic colitis in those animals. This indicates that presence of the PTPN22 variant affects intestinal inflammation by modulating the host's response to the intestinal microbiota.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30319654>Dimensions and Interactions of Large T-Cell Surface Proteins.</a></h2><p>The first step of the adaptive immune response involves the interaction of T cells that express T-cell receptors (TCRs) with peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complexes expressed by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Exactly how this leads to activation of the TCR and to downstream signaling is uncertain, however. Recent findings suggest that one of the key events is the exclusion of the large receptor-type  phosphatase CD45, from close contacts formed at sites of T-cell/APC interaction. If this is true, a full understanding of how close contact formation leads to signaling would require insights into the structures of, and interactions between, large membrane proteins like CD45 and other proteins forming the glycocalyx, such as CD43. Structural insights into the overall dimensions of these proteins using crystallographic methods are hard to obtain, and their conformations on the cell surface are also unknown. Several imaging-based optical microscopy techniques have however been developed for analyzing protein dimensions and orientation on model cell surfaces with nanometer precision. Here we review some of these methods with a focus on the use of hydrodynamic trapping, which relies on liquid flow from a micropipette to move and trap membrane-associated fluorescently labeled molecules. Important insights that have been obtained include (i) how protein flexibility and coverage might affect the effective heights of these molecules, (ii) the height of proteins on the membrane as a key parameter determining how they will distribute in cell-cell contacts, and (iii) how repulsive interactions between the extracellular parts of the proteins influences protein aggregation and distribution.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30618742>Neuroprotective Effects of a Traditional Multi-Herbal Medicine Kyung-Ok-Ko in an Animal Model of Parkinson's Disease: Inhibition of MAPKs and NF-κB Pathways and Activation of Keap1-Nrf2 Pathway.</a></h2><p>Kyung-Ok-Ko (KOK), a traditional multi-herbal medicine, has been widely used in Oriental medicine as a restorative that can enforce vitality of whole organs and as a medicine that can treat age-related symptoms including lack of vigor and weakened . However, the beneficial effect of KOK on neurological diseases such as Parkinson's diseases (PD) is largely unknown. Thus, the objective of this study was to examine the protective effect of KOK on neurotoxicity in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse model of PD. Pre-treatment with KOK at 1 or 2 g/kg/day (p.o.) showed significant mitigating effects on neurological dysfunction (motor and welfare) based on pole, rotarod, and nest building tests. It also showed effects on survival rate. These positive effects of KOK were related to inhibition of loss of  hydroxylase-positive neurons, reduction of MitoSOX activity, increased apoptotic cells, microglia activation, and upregulation of inflammatory factors [interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, cyclooxygenase-2, and inducible nitric oxide], and reduced blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and/or striatum after MPTP intoxication. Interestingly, these effects of KOK against MPTP neurotoxicity were associated with inhibition of phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathways along with up-regulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 pathways in SNpc and/or striatum. Collectively, our findings suggest that KOK might be able to mitigate neurotoxicity in MPTP-induced mouse model of PD via multi-effects, including anti-neuronal and anti-BBB disruption activities through its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities. Therefore, KOK might have potential for preventing and/or treating PD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31171644>Ibrutinib induces multiple functional defects in the neutrophil response against Aspergillus fumigatus.</a></h2><p>Bruton's  kinase inhibitor ibrutinib has become a leading therapy against chronic lymphoid leukemia. Recently, ibrutinib has been associated with the occurrence of invasive fungal infections, in particular invasive aspergillosis. The mechanisms underlying the increased susceptibility to fungal infections associated with ibrutinib exposure are currently unknown. Innate , in particular polymorphonuclear neutrophils, represents the cornerstone of anti-Aspergillus  however the potential impact of ibrutinib on neutrophils has been little studied. Our study investigated the response to Aspergillus fumigatus and neutrophil function in patients with chronic lymphoid leukemia or lymphoma, who were undergoing ibrutinib therapy. To answer this question, we studied the consequences of ibrutinib exposure on the functions and anti-Aspergillus responses of neutrophils obtained from healthy donors and 63 blood samples collected at different time points amongst 32 patients receiving ibrutinib for lymphoid malignancies. We used both flow cytometry and video-microscopy approaches to analyze neutrophils' cell surface molecule expression, cytokine production, oxidative burst, chemotaxis and killing activity against Aspergillus. Ibrutinib is associated, both in vitro and in patients under treatment, with multiple functional defects in neutrophils, including decreased reactive oxygen species production, impairment of their capacity to engulf Aspergillus and inability to efficiently kill germinating conidia. Our results demonstrate that ibrutinib-exposed neutrophils develop significant functional defects that impair their response against Aspergillus fumigatus, providing a plausible explanation for the emergence of invasive aspergillosis in ibrutinib-treated patients.Copyright © 2019, Ferrata Storti Foundation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30552619>FcRγ deficiency improves survival in experimental sepsis by down-regulating TLR4 signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Fc receptor common γ signaling chain (FcRγ), a common subunit shared by Fc receptors (FcγRI, III, IV, FcαRI, and FcεRI), is an important immune regulator both in innate and adaptive .

This protective effect was characterized by decreased TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10. Further experiments in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) in vitro also showed that FcRγ deficiency resulted in decreased production of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 upon LPS stimulation.

The sterile alpha motif (SAM) and RVxF motifs of PfpTKL were found to interact with the P. falciparum proteins serine repeat antigen 5 (SERA5) and protein phosphatase type 1 (PP1) respectively, suggesting that pTKL has a scaffolding role. Furthermore, we found that PP1c activity in a heterologous model was modulated in an RVxF-dependent manner. During the trophozoite stages, PbpTKL was exported to infected erythrocytes where it formed complexes with proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization or host cell maturation and homeostasis. Finally, genetic analysis demonstrated that viable strains obtained by genomic deletion or knocking down PbpTKL did not affect the course of parasite intra-erythrocytic development or gametocyte emergence, indicating functional redundancy during these parasite stages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30540779>Gamma secretase dependent release of the CD44 cytoplasmic tail upregulates IFI16 in cd44-/- tumor cells, MEFs and macrophages.</a></h2><p>The adhesion molecule and co-receptor of receptor  kinases, CD44, is expressed in all cells of the immune system, but also in numerous non-immune cells. CD44 plays roles in the cellular response to different pathogens. The molecular actions of CD44 during these processes are by and large still unknown. The CD44 molecule undergoes a sequential proteolytic cleavage which leads to the release of a soluble intracellular domain (CD44-ICD). Previous reports had shown that the CD44-ICD is taken up into the nucleus where it enhances transcription of specific target genes. By RNA profiling we identified a CD44-dependent transcriptional increase of interferon-responsive genes, among them IFI16. IFI16 is important in the innate immune response. It senses and binds pathogenic DNA and, together with cGAS, activates the cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway and induces the expression of genes relevant for the response, e.g. IFN-β. Our results show that the enhancement of IFI16 expression depended on CD44 cleavage. A CD44-negative tumor cell line, embryonic fibroblasts and bone marrow-derived macrophages from cd44-/- mice were reduced in their response to IFN-γ, to viral DNA fragments and to Listeria monocytogenes infection. We could rescue the deficiency of CD44 negative RPM-MC cells and cd44-/- MEFs by expressing only the soluble CD44-ICD in the absence of any other CD44 domain. Expression of the CD44-ICD carrying a mutation that prevented the uptake into the nucleus, could not rescue the absence of CD44. This molecular aspect of regulation by CD44 may explain part of the immune phenotypes of mice with cd44 gene disruption.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30515156>Phosphatase of Regenerating Liver-1 (PRL-1) Regulates Actin Dynamics During Immunological Synapse Assembly and T Cell Effector Function.</a></h2><p>The regulatory role of most dual specific phosphatases during T cell activation remains unknown. Here, we have studied the expression and function of phosphatases of regenerating liver (PRLs: PRL-1, PRL-2, and PRL-3) during T cell activation, as well as, the dynamic delivery of PRL-1 to the Immunological Synapse (IS). We found that T cell activation downregulates the expression of PRL-2, resulting in an increased PRL-1/PRL-2 ratio. PRL-1 redistributed at the IS in two stages: Initially, it was transiently accumulated at scanning membranes enriched in CD3 and actin, and at later times, it was delivered at the contact site from pericentriolar, CD3ζ-containing, vesicles. Once at the established IS, PRL-1 distributed to LFA-1 and CD3ε sites. Remarkably, PRL-1 was found to regulate actin dynamics during IS assembly and the secretion of IL-2. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of the catalytic activity of the three PRLs reduced the secretion of IL-2. These results provide evidence indicating a regulatory role of PRL-1 during IS assembly and highlight the involvement of PRLs in immune responses by mature T cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30796032>A Novel mTORC1/2 Inhibitor (MTI-31) Inhibits Tumor Growth, Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition, Metastases, and Improves Antitumor  in Preclinical Models of Lung Cancer.</a></h2><p>We aimed to investigate efficacy and mechanism of MTI-31 (LXI-15029), a novel mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitor currently in human trial (), in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) models of multiple driver mutations and  kinase inhibitor (TKI)-resistance.Gene depletion, inhibitor treatment, immunological, flow cytometry, cellular, and animal studies were performed to determine  and  efficacy in NSCLC models of driver mutations and elucidate roles by mTOR complexes in regulating migration, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), metastasis, intracranial tumor growth, and immune-escape.MTI-31 potently inhibited cell proliferation (IC <1 μmol/L) and  tumor growth in multiple NSCLC models of EGFR/T790M, EML4-ALK, c-Met, or KRAS (MED <10 mg/kg). In EGFR-mutant and/or EML4-ALK-driven NSCLC, MTI-31 or disruption of mTORC2 reduced cell migration, hematogenous metastasis to the lung, and abrogated morphological and functional traits of EMT. Disruption of mTORC2 inhibited EGFR/T790M-positive tumor growth in mouse brain and prolonged animal survival correlating a diminished tumor angiogenesis and recruitment of IBA1+ microglia/macrophages in tumor microenvironment. MTI-31 also suppressed programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in EGFR- and ALK-driven NSCLC, mediated in part by mTORC2/AKT/GSK3β-dependent proteasomal degradation. Depletion of mTOR protein or disruption of mTOR complexes profoundly downregulated PD-L1 and alleviated apoptosis in Jurkat T and primary human T cells in a tumor-T cell coculture system.Our results highlight mTOR as a multifaceted regulator of tumor growth, metastasis, and immune-escape in EGFR/ALK-mutant and TKI-resistant NSCLC cells.

ABCA4 is a flippase in photoreceptor outer segments (OS) that translocates retinaldehyde conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine across OS disc membranes. Loss of ABCA4 in   mice and STGD1 patients causes buildup of lipofuscin in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and degeneration of photoreceptors, leading to blindness. No effective treatment currently exists for STGD1. Here we show by several approaches that ABCA4 is additionally expressed in RPE cells. () By in situ hybridization analysis and by RNA-sequencing analysis, we show the  mRNA is expressed in human and mouse RPE cells. () By quantitative immunoblotting, we show that the level of ABCA4 protein in homogenates of wild-type mouse RPE is about 1% of the level in neural retina homogenates. () ABCA4 immunofluorescence is present in RPE cells of wild-type and   but not   mouse retina sections, where it colocalizes with endolysosomal proteins. To elucidate the role of ABCA4 in RPE cells, we generated a line of genetically modified mice that express ABCA4 in RPE cells but not in photoreceptors. Mice from this line on the   background showed partial rescue of photoreceptor degeneration and decreased lipofuscin accumulation compared with nontransgenic   mice. We propose that ABCA4 functions to recycle retinaldehyde released during proteolysis of rhodopsin in RPE endolysosomes following daily phagocytosis of distal photoreceptor OS. ABCA4 deficiency in the RPE may play a role in the pathogenesis of STGD1.Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).

The present study represents the first description of the cloning and structural and functional analysis of LILRB1 and LILRB3 isolated from two genetically disparate chicken lines.Chicken LILRB1-3 genes were identified by bioinformatics approach. Expression studies were performed by transfection, quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Signal transduction was analyzed by western blots, immunoprecipitation and flow cytometric. Cytokine levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Amino acid homology and phylogenetic analyses showed that the homologies of LILRB1 and LILRB3 in the chicken line 6.3 to those proteins in the chicken line 7.2 ranged between 97%-99%, while homologies between chicken and mammal proteins ranged between 13%-19%, and 13%-69%, respectively. Our findings indicate that LILRB1 and LILRB3 subdivided into two groups based on the immunoreceptor -based inhibitory motifs (ITIM) present in the transmembrane domain. Chicken line 6.3 has two ITIM motifs of the sequence LxYxxL and SxYxxV while line 7.2 has two ITIM motifs of the sequences LxYxxL and LxYxxV. These motifs bind to SHP-2 (protein  phosphatase, non-receptor type 11) that plays a regulatory role in immune functions. Moreover, our data indicate that LILRB1 and LILRB3 associated with and activated major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and β2-microglobulin and induced the expression of transporters associated with antigen processing, which are essential for MHC class I antigen presentation. This suggests that LILRB1 and LILRB3 are transcriptional regulators, modulating the expression of components in the MHC class I pathway and thereby regulating immune responses. Furthermore, LILRB1 and LILRB3 activated Janus kinase2/ kinase 2 (JAK2/TYK2); signal transducer and activator of transcription1/3 (STAT1/3), and suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 genes expressed in Macrophage (HD11) cells, which induced Th1, Th2, and Th17 cytokines.These data indicate that LILRB1 and LILRB3 are innate immune receptors associated with SHP-2, MHC class I, β2-microglobulin, and they activate the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling pathway. Thus, our study provides novel insights into the regulation of  and immunopathology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31000683>Oncogenic kinase inhibition limits Batf3-dependent dendritic cell development and antitumor .</a></h2><p>Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is driven by an activating mutation in the  proto-oncogene. Using a mouse model of GIST and human specimens, we show that intratumoral murine CD103CD11b dendritic cells (DCs) and human CD141 DCs are associated with CD8 T cell infiltration and differentiation. In mice, the antitumor effect of the Kit inhibitor imatinib is partially mediated by CD103CD11b DCs, and effector CD8 T cells initially proliferate. However, in both mice and humans, chronic imatinib therapy decreases intratumoral DCs and effector CD8 T cells. The mechanism in our mouse model depends on Kit inhibition, which reduces intratumoral GM-CSF, leading to the accumulation of Batf3-lineage DC progenitors. GM-CSF is produced by γδ T cells via macrophage IL-1β. Stimulants that expand and mature DCs during imatinib treatment improve antitumor . Our findings identify the importance of tumor cell oncogene activity in modulating the Batf3-dependent DC lineage and reveal therapeutic limitations for combined checkpoint blockade and  kinase inhibition.© 2019 Medina et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31045320>Identification of lncRNA-155 encoded by MIR155HG as a novel regulator of innate  against influenza A virus infection.</a></h2><p>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are single-stranded RNA molecules longer than 200 nt that regulate many cellular processes. MicroRNA 155 host gene (MIR155HG) encodes the microRNA (miR)-155 that regulates various signalling pathways of innate and adaptive immune responses against viral infections. MIR155HG also encodes a lncRNA that we call lncRNA-155. Here, we observed that expression of lncRNA-155 was markedly upregulated during influenza A virus (IAV) infection both in vitro (several cell lines) and in vivo (mouse model). Interestingly, robust expression of lncRNA-155 was also induced by infections with several other viruses. Disruption of lncRNA-155 expression in A549 cells diminished the antiviral innate  against IAV. Furthermore, knockout of lncRNA-155 in mice significantly increased IAV replication and virulence in the animals. In contrast, overexpression of lncRNA-155 in human cells suppressed IAV replication, suggesting that lncRNA-155 is involved in host antiviral innate  induced by IAV infection. Moreover, we found that lncRNA-155 had a profound effect on expression of protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) during the infection with IAV. Inhibition of PTP1B by lncRNA-155 resulted in higher production of interferon-beta (IFN-β) and several critical interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Together, these observations reveal that MIR155HG derived lncRNA-155 can be induced by IAV, which modulates host innate  during the virus infection via regulation of PTP1B-mediated interferon response.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30515783>Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy augments lenvatinib's efficacy by favorably altering the immune microenvironment of murine anaplastic thyroid cancer.</a></h2><p>Patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) have an extremely poor prognosis despite multimodal therapy with surgery and chemoradiation. Lenvatinib, a multi-targeted  kinase inhibitor, as well as checkpoint inhibitors targeting the programmed cell death pathway, have proven effective in some patients with advanced thyroid cancer. Combination of these therapies is a potential means to boost effectiveness and minimize treatment resistance in ATC. We utilized our novel immunocompetent murine model of orthotopic ATC to demonstrate that lenvatinib led to significant tumor shrinkage and increased survival, while combination therapy led to dramatic improvements in both. Lenvatinib monotherapy increased tumor-infiltrating macrophages, CD8 T-cells, regulatory T-cells, and most notably, polymorphonuclear myeloid derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs). While both combination therapies led to further increases in CD8 T-cells, only the lenvatinib and anti-PD-1 combination decreased PMN-MDSCs. PMN-MDSC expansion was also seen in the blood of mice and one patient receiving lenvatinib therapy for ATC. RNA-Seq of the ATC cell line used in our mouse model demonstrated that lenvatinib has multifaceted effects on angiogenesis, response to hypoxia, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and on multiple pathways implicated in inflammation and host . Combination of lenvatinib with anti-Gr-1 antibody ameliorated lenvatinib's expansion of MDSCs and significantly improved lenvatinib's anti-tumor effect. These data suggest that MDSCs play a negative role in ATC's response to lenvatinib and support future study of their role as a potential biomarker and treatment target.© 2018 UICC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31230667>Nitrosative Stress Is Associated with Dopaminergic Dysfunction in the HIV-1 Transgenic Rat.</a></h2><p>Advances in antiretroviral therapy have resulted in significantly decreased HIV-related mortality. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, however, continue to be a major problem in infected patients. The neuropathology underlying HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders has not been well characterized, and evidence suggests different contributing mechanisms. One potential mechanism is the induction of oxidative stress. Using the HIV-1 transgenic (Tg) rat model of HIV, we found increased striatal NADPH oxidase-4 and neuronal nitric oxide synthase expression in the adult (7- to 9-month-old) Tg rat compared with control rats but not in the young (1-month-old) Tg rats. This was accompanied by increased 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) immunostaining in the adult Tg rats, which worsened significantly in the old Tg rats (18 to 20 months old). There was, however, no concurrent induction of the antioxidant systems because there was no change in the expression of the nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 and its downstream targets (thioredoxin and glutathione antioxidant systems). Colocalization of 3-NT staining with neurofilament proteins and evidence of decreased  hydroxylase and dopamine transporter expression in the old rats support dopaminergic involvement. We conclude that the HIV-1 Tg rat brain shows evidence of nitrosative stress without appropriate oxidation-reduction adaptation, whereas 3-NT modification of striatal neurofilament proteins likely points to the ensuing dopaminergic neuronal loss and dysfunction in the aging HIV-1 Tg rat.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

Therefore, the aim of this work was to confirm whether an oxidative/inflammatory stress occurs in immune cells from adult mice with premature aging, similar to that shown in leukocytes from chronologically old animals, and if this results in immunosenescence. Several oxidants/antioxidants and inflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokines were analyzed in peritoneal leukocytes from adult female CD1 mice in two models of premature aging-(a) prematurely aging mice (PAM) and (b) mice with the deletion of a single allele (hemi-zygotic: HZ) of the  hydroxylase () gene (TH-HZ), together with cells from chronologically old animals. Several immune function parameters were also studied in peritoneal phagocytes and lymphocytes. The same oxidants and antioxidants were also analyzed in spleen and thymus leukocytes. The results showed that the immune cells of PAM and TH-HZ mice presented lower values of antioxidant defenses and higher values of oxidants/pro-inflammatory cytokines than cells from corresponding controls, and similar to those in cells from old animals. Moreover, premature immunosenescence in peritoneal leukocytes from both PAM and TH-HZ mice was also observed. In conclusion, adult PAM and TH-HZ mice showed oxidative stress in their immune cells, which would explain their immunosenescence.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30562046>Personalized Transcriptomics Reveals Heterogeneous Immunophenotypes in Children with Viral Bronchiolitis.</a></h2><p> A subset of infants are hypersusceptible to severe/acute viral bronchiolitis (AVB), for reasons incompletely understood.  To characterize the cellular/molecular mechanisms underlying infant AVB in circulating cells/local airway tissues.  Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and nasal scrapings were obtained from infants (<18 mo) and children (≥18 mo to 5 yr) during AVB and after convalescence. Immune response patterns were profiled by multiplex analysis of plasma cytokines, flow cytometry, and transcriptomics (RNA-Seq). Molecular profiling of group-level data used a combination of upstream regulator and coexpression network analysis, followed by individual subject-level data analysis using personalized -of-1-pathways methodology.  Group-level analyses demonstrated that infant peripheral blood mononuclear cell responses were dominated by monocyte-associated hyperupregulated type 1 IFN signaling/proinflammatory pathways (drivers: TNF [tumor necrosis factor], IL-6, TREM1 [triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1], and IL-1B), versus a combination of inflammation (PTGER2 [prostaglandin E receptor 2] and IL-6) plus growth/repair/remodeling pathways (ERBB2 [erbb-b2 receptor  kinase 2], TGFB1 [transforming growth factor-β1], AREG [amphiregulin], and HGF [hepatocyte growth factor]) coupled with T-helper cell type 2 and natural killer cell signaling in children. Age-related differences were not attributable to differential steroid usage or variations in underlying viral pathogens. Nasal mucosal responses were comparable qualitatively in infants/children, dominated by IFN types 1-3, but the magnitude of upregulation was higher in infants (range, 6- to 48-fold) than children (5- to 17-fold). -of-1-pathways analysis confirmed differential upregulation of innate  in infants and natural killer cell networks in children, and additionally demonstrated covert AVB response subphenotypes that were independent of chronologic age.  Dysregulated expression of IFN-dependent pathways after respiratory viral infections is a defining immunophenotypic feature of AVB-susceptible infants and a subset of children.

The molecular mechanism was further verified in vivo using mouse models. The clinical significance was determined using IHC in human clinical specimens. Liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy (LC/MS-MS) was used to identify the metabolites that are released by PCC, which trigger T cells inactivation.PCM inhibits T cells proliferation and impairs their ability to produce inflammatory cytokines. PCM decreases ATP production and increases ROS production in T cells by inhibiting complex III of the electron transport chain. We further show that SHP1 as the key molecule that is upregulated in T cells in response to PCM, inhibition of which reverses the phenotype induced by PCM. Using metabolomics analysis, we identified 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) as a vital molecule that is released by PCC. P5C is responsible for suppressing T cells signaling by increasing ROS and SHP1, and decreasing cytokines and ATP production.

Because of the pathogenesis of Bcc infections, we wondered if a novel mechanism of microbial host defense involving direct antibacterial activity by natural killer (NK) cells might play a role in the control of Bcc. We demonstrate that NK cells bound Burkholderia, resulting in Src family kinase activation as measured by protein  phosphorylation, granule release of effector proteins such as perforin and contact-dependent killing of the bacteria.

CD45 activates Lck by opposing the negative regulatory kinase Csk. Paradoxically, CD45 has also been implicated in suppressing TCR signaling by dephosphorylating the same signaling motifs within the TCR complex upon which Lck acts. We sought to reconcile these observations using chemical and genetic perturbations of the Csk/CD45 regulatory axis incorporated with computational analyses. Specifically, we titrated the activities of Csk and CD45 and assessed their influence on Lck activation, TCR-associated ζ-chain phosphorylation, and more downstream signaling events. Acute inhibition of Csk revealed that CD45 suppressed ζ-chain phosphorylation and was necessary for a regulatable pool of active Lck, thereby interconnecting the activating and suppressive roles of CD45 that tune antigen discrimination. CD45 suppressed signaling events that were antigen independent or induced by low-affinity antigen but not those initiated by high-affinity antigen. Together, our findings reveal that CD45 acts as a signaling "gatekeeper," enabling graded signaling outputs while filtering weak or spurious signaling events.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

In immune cells, TAM RTKs can dampen inflammation in favor of homeostatic wound-healing responses, thus potentially contributing to the evasion of cancer cells from immune surveillance. Here we characterize the small-molecule RXDX-106 as a selective and potent pan-TAM RTK inhibitor with slow dissociation kinetics and significant antitumor activity in multiple syngeneic tumor models. Expression of AXL and MER on both immune and tumor cells increased during tumor progression. Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) following treatment with RXDX-106 was observed in wild-type mice and was abrogated in immunodeficient mice, suggesting that the antitumor activity of RXDX-106 is, in part, due to the presence of immune cells. RXDX-106-mediated TGI was associated with increased tumor-infiltrating leukocytes, M1-polarized intratumoral macrophages, and activation of natural killer cells. RXDX-106 proportionally increased intratumoral CD8 T cells and T-cell function as indicated by both IFNγ production and LCK phosphorylation (pY393). RXDX-106 exhibited its effects via direct actions on TAM RTKs expressed on intratumoral macrophages and dendritic cells, leading to indirect activation of other immune cells in the tumor. RXDX-106 also potentiated the effects of an immune checkpoint inhibitor, α-PD-1 Ab, resulting in enhanced antitumor efficacy and survival. Collectively, these results demonstrate the capacity of RXDX-106 to inhibit tumor growth and progression and suggest it may serve as an effective therapy against multiple tumor types.

Currently, no data exist regarding the role of LILRB4 and LILRB5 in the activation of immune signaling pathways in mammalian and avian species. Here, we report for the first time, the cloning and structural and functional analyses of chicken LILRB4-5 genes identified from 2 genetically disparate chicken lines. Comparison of LILRB4-5 amino acid sequences from lines 6.3 and 7.2 with those of mammalian proteins revealed 17 to 62% and 19 to 29% similarity, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the chicken LILRB4-5 genes were closely associated with those of other species. LILRB4-5 could be subdivided into 2 groups having distinct immunoreceptor -based inhibitory motifs, which bind to Src homology 2-containing  phosphatase 2 (SHP-2). Importantly, LILRB4-5 also upregulated the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and β2-microglobulin gene expression as well as the expression of transporter associated with antigen processing 1-2, which play an important role in MHC class I activation. Our results indicate that LILRB4-5 are transcriptional regulators of the MHC class I pathway components and regulate innate immune responses. Furthermore, LILRB4-5 could activate the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway genes in macrophages and induce the expression of chemokines and T helper (Th)1, Th2, and Th17 cytokines.

Additionally, they activate the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and control the expression of cytokines in macrophages.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30385692>Fas activation alters tight junction proteins in acute lung injury.</a></h2><p>The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by protein-rich oedema in the alveolar spaces, a feature in which Fas-mediated apoptosis of the alveolar epithelium has been involved. To determine whether Fas activation increases protein permeability by mechanisms involving disruption of the paracellular tight junction (TJ) proteins in the pulmonary alveoli.  Protein permeability and the expression of TJ proteins were assessed in vivo in wild-type and Fas-deficient lpr mice 16 hours after the intratracheal instillation of recombinant human soluble Fas ligand (rh-sFasL), and at different time points in vitro in human pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (HPAEpiC) exposed to rh-sFasL Activation of the Fas pathway increased protein permeability in mouse lungs and altered the expression of the TJ proteins occludin and zonula occludens-1 in the alveolar-capillary membrane in vivo and in human alveolar epithelial cell monolayers in vitro. Blockade of caspase-3, but not inhibition of  kinase dependent pathways, prevented the alterations in TJ protein expression and permeability induced by the Fas/FasL system in human alveolar cell monolayers in vitro. We also observed that both the Fas-induced increase of protein permeability and disruption of TJ proteins occurred before cell death could be detected in the cell monolayers in vitro. Targeting caspase pathways could prevent the disruption of TJs and reduce the formation of lung oedema in the early stages of ARDS.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

Aging has a profound impact in the frequency, phenotype and function of NK cells. Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is caused by the BCR-ABL gene formation encoding aberrant oncoprotein  kinase. Treatment with  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) induces durable deep molecular response. The response to treatment and life expectancy is lower in older patients with chronic phase of CML than in younger patients. In this work we analyse NK cells from TKI-treated CML patients and healthy controls stratified according to age. We have analyzed the expression of NK receptors, activation markers, NK cell differentiation in CD56 and CD56 NK cell subsets and the expression of CD107a and IFN-γ in NK cells stimulated with K562. Whereas significant differences on the phenotype and function of NK cells were found between middle-aged (35-65 years old) and elderly (older than 65) healthy individuals, NK cells from TKI-treated CML patients do not show significant differences related with age in most parameters studied, indicating that age is not a limitation of the NK cell recovery after treatment with TKI. Our results also revealed differences in the expression of NK receptors, activation markers and functional assays in NK cells from TKI-treated CML patients compared with age-matched healthy controls. These results highlight the relevance of NK cells in TKI-treated patients and the need of an extensive analysis of the effect of aging on NK cell phenotype and function in these patients in order to define new NK-cell based strategies directed to control CML progression and achieve long-term disease remission after TKI cessation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31570755>Abl family  kinases govern IgG extravasation in the skin in a murine pemphigus model.</a></h2><p>The pathway of homeostatic IgG extravasation is not fully understood, in spite of its importance for the maintenance of host , the management of autoantibody-mediated disorders, and the use of antibody-based biologics. Here we show in a murine model of pemphigus, a prototypic cutaneous autoantibody-mediated disorder, that blood-circulating IgG extravasates into the skin in a time- and dose-dependent manner under homeostatic conditions. This IgG extravasation is unaffected by depletion of Fcγ receptors, but is largely attenuated by specific ablation of dynamin-dependent endocytic vesicle formation in blood endothelial cells (BECs). Among dynamin-dependent endocytic vesicles, IgG co-localizes well with caveolae in cultured BECs. An Abl family  kinase inhibitor imatinib, which reduces caveolae-mediated endocytosis, impairs IgG extravasation in the skin and attenuates the murine pemphigus manifestations. Our study highlights the kinetics of IgG extravasation in vivo, which might be a clue to understand the pathological mechanism of autoantibody-mediated autoimmune disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30277607>Inhibition of hematopoietic cell kinase dysregulates microglial function and accelerates early stage Alzheimer's disease-like neuropathology.</a></h2><p>Emerging evidence have posited that dysregulated microglia impair clearance and containment of amyloid-β (Aβ) species in the brain, resulting in aberrant buildup of Aβ and onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hematopoietic cell kinase (Hck) is one of the key regulators of phagocytosis among the Src family  kinases (SFKs) in myeloid cells, and its expression is found to be significantly altered in AD brains. However, the role of Hck signaling in AD pathogenesis is unknown. We employed pharmacological inhibition and genetic ablation of Hck in BV2 microglial cells and J20 mouse model of AD, respectively, to evaluate the impact of Hck deficiency on Aβ-stimulated microglial phagocytosis, Aβ clearance, and resultant AD-like neuropathology. Our in vitro data reveal that pharmacological inhibition of SFKs/Hck in BV2 cells and genetic ablation of their downstream kinase, spleen  kinase (Syk), in primary microglia significantly attenuate Aβ oligomers-stimulated microglial phagocytosis. Whereas in Hck-deficient J20 mice, we observed exacerbated Aβ plaque burden, reduced microglial coverage, containment, and phagocytosis of Aβ plaques, and induced iNOS expression in plaque-associated microglial clusters. These multifactorial changes in microglial activities led to attenuated PSD95 levels in hippocampal DG and CA3 regions, but did not alter the postsynaptic dendritic spine morphology at the CA1 region nor cognitive function of the mice. Hck inhibition thus accelerates early stage AD-like neuropathology by dysregulating microglial function and inducing neuroinflammation. Our data implicate that Hck pathway plays a prominent role in regulating microglial neuroprotective function during the early stage of AD development.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30595195>Immunothérapie des cancers du rein.</a></h2><p>Clear cell kidney cancer is a tumour type whose development and progression is driven by the HIF/VEGF angiogenesis pathway. Anti-angiogenic (AA) agents, particularly anti-VEGFR  kinase (TKI) inhibitors, have profoundly modified the prognosis of patients in the metastatic setting (mRCC) since their registration in 2006. At the same time, mTOR inhibitors have also brought significant benefit to patients. More recently, treatments restoring adaptive anti-tumor , anti-program death 1 (anti-PD-1) checkpoint inhibitors (ICP), have in turn revolutionized the management of patients with mRCC. The multi-tumor efficacy of these ICPs proves the crucial role of anti-tumor  in tumor development and progression in a number of tumors including clear cell kidney tumours (ccRCC). The tumor immune microenvironment (TME) of ccRCC is known to be highly immunosuppressive. Thus ccRCCs are characterized by a strong infiltration of CD8+ T lymphocytes, frequently expressing immunological checkpoint molecules on their surface, giving them a poor prognostic feature. These characteristics partly explain the effectiveness of ICP in ccRCC and constitute a strong rationale for their further development, either at an earlier stage or in combination, particularly with AA or TKI. In this review are compiled the main clinical results of immunological checkpoint molecules alone or in combination in 1line or after TKI failure.© 2018 Société Française du Cancer.

LCK activation also initiates a negative feedback loop mediated by the phosphatase SHP-1 that turns off TCR signaling. In this article, we report that the thousand-and-one amino acid kinase 3 (TAOK3) is a key regulator of this feedback. TAOK3 is a serine/threonine kinase expressed in many different cell types including T cells. TAOK3-deficient human T cells had impaired LCK-dependent TCR signaling resulting in a defect in IL-2 response to canonical TCR signaling but not to bacterial superantigens, which use an LCK-independent pathway. This impairment was associated with enhanced interaction of LCK with SHP-1 after TCR engagement and rapid termination of TCR signals, a defect corrected by TAOK3 reconstitution. Thus, TAOK3 is a positive regulator of TCR signaling by preventing premature SHP-1-mediated inactivation of LCK. This mechanism may also regulate signaling by other Src family kinase-dependent receptors.Copyright © 2018 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31384667>Recruitment of Intratumoral CD103 Dendritic Cells by a CXCR4 Antagonist-Armed Virotherapy Enhances Antitumor .</a></h2><p>Intratumoral dendritic cells play an important role in stimulating cytotoxic T cells and driving antitumor . Using a metastatic ovarian tumor model in syngeneic mice, we explored whether therapy with a CXCR4 antagonist-armed oncolytic vaccinia virus activates endogenous CD103 dendritic cell responses associated with the induction of adaptive  against viral and tumor antigens. The overall goal of this study was to determine whether expansion of CD103 dendritic cells by the virally delivered CXCR4 antagonist augments overall survival and  boosting with a tumor antigen peptide-based vaccine. We found that locoregional delivery of the CXCR4-A-armed virus reduced the tumor load and the immunosuppressive network in the tumor microenvironment, leading to infiltration of CD103 dendritic cells that were capable of phagocytic clearance of cellular material from virally infected cancer cells. Further expansion of tumor-resident CD103 DCs by injecting the FMS-related  kinase 3 ligand, the formative cytokine for CD103 DCs, provided a platform for a booster immunization with the Wilms tumor antigen 1 peptide-based vaccine delivered intraperitoneally with polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidylic acid as an adjuvant. The vaccine-induced antitumor responses inhibited tumor growth and increased overall survival, indicating that expansion of intratumoral CD103 dendritic cells by CXCR4-A-armed oncovirotherapy treatment can potentiate  cancer vaccine boosting.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762153>Blockade of the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) as potential therapy for anaplastic thyroid cancer.</a></h2><p>Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is a rare, highly aggressive form of thyroid cancer (TC) characterized by an aggressive behavior and poor prognosis, resulting in patients' death within a year. Standard treatments, such as chemo and radiotherapy, as well as  kinase inhibitors, are ineffective for ATC treatment. Cancer immunotherapy is one of the most promising research area in oncology. The PD-1/PD-L1 axis is of particular interest, in light of promising data showing a restoration of host  against tumors, with the prospect of long-lasting remissions.In this study, we evaluated PD-L1 expression in a large series of TCs (20 cases) showing a progressive dedifferentiation of the thyroid tumor from well differentiated TC to ATC, employing two different antibodies [R&D Systems and VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody]. We also tested the anti PD-L1 mAb in an in vivo animal model.We found that approximately 70-90% of ATC cases were positive for PD-L1 whereas normal thyroid and differentiated TC were negative. Moreover, all analyzed cases presented immunopositive staining in the endothelium of vessels within or in close proximity to the tumor, while normal thyroid vessels were negative. PD-L1 mAb was also effective in inhibiting ATC growth in an in vivo model.These data suggest that immunotherapy may be a promising treatment specific for ATC suggesting the need to start with clinical TRIALs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31157930>Cytoskeletal Exposure in the Regulation of  and Initiation of Tissue Repair.</a></h2><p>This article reviews and discusses emerging evidence suggesting an evolutionarily-conserved connection between injury-associated exposure of cytoskeletal proteins and the induction of tolerance to infection, repair of tissue damage and restoration of homeostasis.

In the present study, we focused on the mechanism of melatonin in the regulation of vascular permeability. We found that melatonin could inhibit both VEGF- and EGF-induced monolayer permeability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and change the  phosphorylation of vascular-endothelial (VE-)cadherin, which was related to endothelial barrier function. In addition, phospho-AKT (Ser) and phospho-ERK(1/2) played significant roles in the regulation of VE-cadherin phosphorylation. Both the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT inhibitor LY49002 and MEK/ERK inhibitor U0126 could inhibit the permeability of HUVECs, but with different effects on  phosphorylation of VE-cadherin. Melatonin can influence the two growth factor-induced phosphorylation of AKT (Ser) but not ERK(1/2). Our results show that melatonin can inhibit growth factor-induced monolayer permeability of HUVECs by influencing the phosphorylation of AKT and VE-cadherin. Melatonin can be a potential treatment for diseases associated with abnormal vascular permeability.  We found that melatonin could inhibit both EGF- and VEGF-induced monolayer permeability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells, which is related to phosphorylation of vascular-endothelial cadherin. Blockade of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT and MEK/ERK pathways could inhibit the permeability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and phosphorylation of AKT (Ser) might be a critical event in the changing of monolayer permeability and likely has cross-talk with the MEK/ERK pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988178>Exaggeration and cooption of innate  for social defense.</a></h2><p>Social insects often exhibit striking altruistic behaviors, of which the most spectacular ones may be self-destructive defensive behaviors called autothysis, "self-explosion," or "suicidal bombing." In the social aphid , when enemies damage their plant-made nest called the gall, soldier nymphs erupt to discharge a large amount of body fluid, mix the secretion with their legs, and skillfully plaster it over the plant injury. Dozens of soldiers come out, erupt, mix, and plaster, and the gall breach is promptly sealed with the coagulated body fluid. What molecular and cellular mechanisms underlie the self-sacrificing nest repair with body fluid for the insect society? Here we demonstrate that the body cavity of soldier nymphs is full of highly differentiated large hemocytes that contain huge amounts of lipid droplets and phenoloxidase (PO), whereas their hemolymph accumulates huge amounts of  and a unique repeat-containing protein (RCP). Upon breakage of the gall, soldiers gather around the breach and massively discharge the body fluid. The large hemocytes rupture and release lipid droplets, which promptly form a lipidic clot, and, concurrently, activated PO converts  to reactive quinones, which cross-link RCP and other macromolecules to physically reinforce the clot to seal the gall breach. Here, soldiers' humoral and cellular immune mechanisms for wound sealing are extremely up-regulated and utilized for colony defense, which provides a striking case of direct evolutionary connection between individual  and social  and highlights the importance of exaggeration and cooption of preexisting traits to create evolutionary novelties.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

However, the role of Dock5 on B-cell  still remain elusive. In this study, we generated a Dock5 knockout mouse model to study the effect of Dock5 deficiency on B cell development, differentiation and BCR signaling. We found that the absence of Dock5 leads to a moderate effect on B cell development in the bone marrow and reduces follicular (FO) and marginal zone (MZ) B cells. Mechanistically, the key positive upstream B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling molecules, CD19 and Brutons  kinase (Btk), whose activation determines the fate of FO and MZ B cells, is reduced in Dock5 KO B cells upon antigenic stimulation by using total internal reflection fluorscence microscopy (TIRF) and immunoblot. Interestingly we found that the cellular filamentous actin (F-actin), also decreased in Dock5 KO B cells upon stimulation, which, in turn, offers feedback to BCR signaling. Our study has unveiled that Dock5 regulates the peripheral B cell differentiation via controlling the CD19-Btk signaling axis as well as actin reorganization.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Here we demonstrate both direct therapeutic effects of MERTK inhibition on leukemia cells and induction of anti-leukemia  via suppression of the coinhibitory PD-1 axis. A MERTK-selective  kinase inhibitor, MRX-2843, mediated therapeutic anti-leukemia effects in immunocompromised mice bearing a MERTK-expressing human leukemia xenograft. In addition, inhibition of host MERTK by genetic deletion (Mertk-/- mice) or treatment with MRX-2843 significantly decreased tumor burden and prolonged survival in immune-competent mice inoculated with a MERTK-negative ALL, suggesting immune-mediated therapeutic activity. In this context, MERTK inhibition led to significant decreases in expression of the coinhibitory ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 on CD11b+ monocytes/macrophages in the leukemia microenvironment. Furthermore, although T cells do not express MERTK, inhibition of MERTK indirectly decreased PD-1 expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and decreased the incidence of splenic FOXP3+ Tregs at sites of leukemic infiltration, leading to increased T cell activation. These data demonstrate direct and immune-mediated therapeutic activities in response to MERTK inhibition in ALL models and provide validation of a translational agent targeting MERTK for modulation of tumor .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31462771>Fatty acids and cancer-amplified ZDHHC19 promote STAT3 activation through S-palmitoylation.</a></h2><p>Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) has a critical role in regulating cell fate, inflammation and . Cytokines and growth factors activate STAT3 through kinase-mediated  phosphorylation and dimerization. It remains unknown whether other factors promote STAT3 activation through different mechanisms. Here we show that STAT3 is post-translationally S-palmitoylated at the SRC homology 2 (SH2) domain, which promotes the dimerization and transcriptional activation of STAT3. Fatty acids can directly activate STAT3 by enhancing its palmitoylation, in synergy with cytokine stimulation. We further identified ZDHHC19 as a palmitoyl acyltransferase that regulates STAT3. Cytokine stimulation increases STAT3 palmitoylation by promoting the association between ZDHHC19 and STAT3, which is mediated by the SH3 domain of GRB2. Silencing ZDHHC19 blocks STAT3 palmitoylation and dimerization, and impairs the cytokine- and fatty-acid-induced activation of STAT3. ZDHHC19 is frequently amplified in multiple human cancers, including in 39% of lung squamous cell carcinomas. High levels of ZDHHC19 correlate with high levels of nuclear STAT3 in patient samples. In addition, knockout of ZDHHC19 in lung squamous cell carcinoma cells significantly blocks STAT3 activity, and inhibits the fatty-acid-induced formation of tumour spheres as well as tumorigenesis induced by high-fat diets in an in vivo mouse model. Our studies reveal that fatty-acid- and ZDHHC19-mediated palmitoylation are signals that regulate STAT3, which provides evidence linking the deregulation of palmitoylation to inflammation and cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30452438>Co-expression of IL-15 enhances anti-neuroblastoma effectivity of a  hydroxylase-directed DNA vaccination in mice.</a></h2><p>Long-term survival of high-risk neuroblastoma (NB) patients still remains under 50%. Here, we report the generation, in vitro characterization and anti-tumor effectivity of a new bicistronic xenogenic DNA vaccine encoding  hydroxylase (TH) that is highly expressed in NB tumors, and the immune stimulating cytokine interleukin 15 (IL-15) that induces cytotoxic but not regulatory T cells. The DNA sequences of TH linked to ubiquitin and of IL-15 were integrated into the bicistronic expression vector pIRES. Successful production and bioactivity of the vaccine-derived IL-15- and TH protein were shown by ELISA, bioactivity assay and western blot analysis. Further, DNA vaccine-driven gene transfer to the antigen presenting cells of Peyer's patches using attenuated Salmonella typhimurium that served as oral delivery system was shown by immunofluorescence analysis. The anti-tumor effect of the generated vaccine was evaluated in a syngeneic mouse model (A/J mice, n = 12) after immunization with S. typhimurium (3× prior and 3× after tumor implantation). Importantly, TH-/IL-15-based DNA vaccination resulted in an enhanced tumor remission in 45.5% of mice compared to controls (TH (16.7%), IL-15 (0%)) and reduced spontaneous metastasis (30.0%) compared to controls (TH (63.6%), IL-15 (70.0%)). Interestingly, similar levels of tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells were observed among all experimental groups. Finally, co-expression of IL-15 did not result in elevated regulatory T cell levels in tumor environment measured by flow cytometry. In conclusion, co-expression of the stimulatory cytokine IL-15 enhanced the NB-specific anti-tumor effectivity of a TH-directed vaccination in mice and may provide a novel immunological approach for NB patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30963244>Regulation of centromeric heterochromatin in the cell cycle by phosphorylation of histone H3  41.</a></h2><p>Constitutive heterochromatin packages long stretches of repetitive DNA sequences at the centromere and telomere, and ensures genomic integrity at these loci by preventing aberrant recombination and transcription. The chromatin scaffold of heterochromatin is dynamically regulated in the cell cycle, and inheritance of the epigenetically silenced state is dependent on a transcriptional event imposed on the underlying non-coding RNA in conjunction with the DNA replicative phase. Heterochromatin becomes transiently loosened in response to a reduction in the binding of Swi6, a heterochromatin protein, and this allows RNA polymerase II access to the underlying sequence. The derived transcripts, in turn, drive heterochromatin formation via the recruitment of other silencing factors. It remains unclear how heterochromatin becomes decompacted in a cell cycle-specific manner. Here, we describe a mechanism of heterochromatin decompaction initiated by a novel histone modification, histone H3  41 phosphorylation (H3Y41p). We will discuss how H3Y41p cooperates with other regulatory pathways to enforce cell cycle-dependent regulation of constitutive heterochromatin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30538178>Structural Constraints at the Trimer Apex Stabilize the HIV-1 Envelope in a Closed, Antibody-Protected Conformation.</a></h2><p>The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope (Env) trimer evades antibody recognition by adopting a closed prefusion conformation. Here, we show that two conserved tyrosines (Y173, Y177) within the second variable (V2) loop of the gp120 Env glycoprotein are key regulators of the closed, antibody-protected state of the trimer by establishing intramolecular interaction with the base of the third variable (V3) loop. Mutation of Y177 and/or Y173 to phenylalanine or alanine dramatically altered the susceptibility of diverse HIV-1 strains to neutralization, increasing sensitivity to weakly and nonneutralizing antibodies directed against diverse Env regions, consistent with the adoption of an open trimer configuration. Conversely, potent broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against different supersites of HIV-1 vulnerability exhibited reduced potency against V2 loop  mutants, consistent with their preferential targeting of the closed trimer. Mutation of V3 loop residues predicted to interact with the V2 loop tyrosines yielded a similar neutralization phenotype. Sera from chronically HIV-1-infected patients contained very high titers of antibodies capable of neutralizing V2 loop  mutants but not wild-type viruses, indicating that the bulk of antibodies produced in infected hosts are unable to penetrate the protective shield of the closed trimer. These results identify the -mediated V2-V3 loop complex at the trimer apex as a key structural constraint that facilitates HIV-1 evasion from the bulk of host antibodies. The extraordinary ability of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to evade host  represents a major obstacle to the development of a protective vaccine. Thus, elucidating the mechanisms whereby HIV-1 protects its external envelope (Env), which is the sole target of virus-neutralizing antibodies, is an essential step toward vaccine design. We identified a key structural element that maintains the HIV-1 Env trimer in a closed, antibody-resistant conformation. A major role is played by two conserved tyrosines at the apex of the Env spike, whose mutation causes a global opening of the trimer structure, exposing multiple concealed targets for neutralizing antibodies. We also found that HIV-infected individuals produce very large amounts of antibodies that neutralize the open Env form; however, the bulk of these antibodies are unable to penetrate the tight defensive shield of the native virus. This work may help to devise new strategies to overcome the viral defensive mechanisms and facilitate the development of an effective HIV-1 vaccine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30402958>Characterisation of the Toxoplasma gondii  transporter and its phosphorylation by the calcium-dependent protein kinase 3.</a></h2><p>Toxoplasma gondii parasites rapidly exit their host cell when exposed to calcium ionophores. Calcium-dependent protein kinase 3 (TgCDPK3) was previously identified as a key mediator in this process, as TgCDPK3 knockout (∆cdpk3) parasites fail to egress in a timely manner. Phosphoproteomic analysis comparing WT with ∆cdpk3 parasites revealed changes in the TgCDPK3-dependent phosphoproteome that included proteins important for regulating motility, but also metabolic enzymes, indicating that TgCDPK3 controls processes beyond egress. Here we have investigated a predicted direct target of TgCDPK3, ApiAT5-3, a putative transporter of the major facilitator superfamily, and show that it is rapidly phosphorylated at serine 56 after induction of calcium signalling. Conditional knockout of apiAT5-3 results in transcriptional upregulation of most ribosomal subunits, but no alternative transporters, and subsequent parasite death. Mutating the S56 to a non-phosphorylatable alanine leads to a fitness cost, suggesting that phosphorylation of this residue is beneficial, albeit not essential, for  import. Using a combination of metabolomics and heterologous expression, we confirmed a primary role in  import for ApiAT5-3. However, no significant differences in  import could be detected in phosphorylation site mutants showing that if  transport is affected by S56 phosphorylation, its regulatory role is subtle.© 2018 The Authors.

In this study, the CD79a (OnCD79a) and CD79b (OnCD79b) were cloned and identified from Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). The cDNA of ORF for OnCD79a and OnCD79b are 669 and 627 bp, coding 222 and 208 amino acids, respectively. The deduced protein analysis showed that both CD79a andCD79b contain an immunoreceptor -based activation motif in their intracellular tails that used to propagate a signal in a B cell. Expression analysis revealed that both CD79a and CD79b expressed at high levels in immune tissues, such as anterior kidney and spleen, and in IgM B cells. Upon Streptococcus agalactiae (S. agalactiae) infection, the expressions of OnCD79a and OnCD79b were significantly up-regulated in anterior kidney and spleen. The significant up-regulations of OnCD79a and OnCD79b were also detected in leukocytes after in vitro challenge with S. agalactiae. Further, stimulations of LPS and anti-OnIgM monoclonal antibody induced significant up-regulations of OnCD79a and OnCD79b in leukocytes. Taken together, the results of this study indicated that CD79 molecule, playing roles in BCR signaling, was likely to get involved in host defense against bacterial infection in Nile tilapia.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We show that decreased extracellular Mg reduced intracellular Mg levels and impaired the Ca flux, activation marker up-regulation, and proliferation after T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. Reduced Mg specifically impairs TCR signal transduction by IL-2-inducible T cell kinase (ITK) due to a requirement for a regulatory Mg in the catalytic pocket of ITK. We also show that altered catalytic efficiency by millimolar changes in free basal Mg is an unrecognized but conserved feature of other serine/threonine and  kinases, suggesting a Mg regulatory paradigm of kinase function. Finally, a reduced serum Mg concentration in mice causes an impaired CD8 T cell response to influenza A virus infection, reduces T cell activation, and exacerbates morbidity. Thus, Mg directly regulates the active site of specific kinases during T cell responses, and maintaining a high serum Mg concentration is important for antiviral  in otherwise healthy animals.This is a work of the U.S. Government and is not subject to copyright protection in the United States.

However, the consequences of this polymorphism, which introduces an arginine to tryptophan substitution at amino acid 620, for the function of PTPN22 protein is unclear and conflicting results have been obtained in human compared to mouse cells expressing this variant phosphatase. In mouse the variant appears to be a loss-of-function allele resembling a milder form of the null allele, while studies in human cells have reported it to be a gain-of-function mutation. To address whether the phosphatase has distinct functions in mouse vs. human T cells, we used CRISPR gene-editing to generate the first example of human PTPN22-KnockOut (KO) T cells. By comparing isogenic human T cells which express or lack PTPN22, we showed that PTPN22 KO T cells displayed enhanced expression of IL-2 and CD69 upon stimulation with cognate antigen. PTPN22 KO cells also showed increased Erk phosphorylation upon stimulation with weak antigen, but the difference was diminished in response to strong antigen, indicating that PTPN22 plays a more critical role in regulating weak-antigen responses. These data are in keeping with a role for PTPN22 in determining the threshold of stimulation required to activate T cells, a critical function of autoimmune pathogenesis. Our data indicate that PTPN22 has comparable functions in mouse and human T cells, and that the conflicting results in the literature regarding the impact of the point mutation are not due to differences in the activity of PTPN22 itself, but may be related to interactions with other proteins or splice variation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31462002>PD-L1 Induction by Cancer-Associated Fibroblast-Derived Factors in Lung Adenocarcinoma Cells.</a></h2><p>Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) exert various effects upon biological behaviours of cancer. In this study, we examined the correlation of CAFs with the intra-tumoural immune system in the lung adenocarcinoma microenvironment. We studied 27 and 113 cases of lung adenocarcinoma tentatively as Cohorts 1 and 2, respectively. The patients in Cohort 1 received epidermal growth factor receptor- kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) for recurrent lung adenocarcinoma. -smooth muscle actin (-SMA), a surrogate marker for CAFs, was examined by immunohistochemistry. We then examined the effects of CAFs isolated from lung cancer tissues on programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. No significant associations were detected between -SMA status and the ratios of CD8/CD4 and Foxp3/CD8 in Cohort 1. However, -SMA status was significantly associated with PD-L1 status in both Cohorts 1 and 2. Conditioned medium of CAFs significantly induced PD-L1 expression in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, A549, PC-9, and H1975. Among the cytokines examined by antibody array, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CXCL2) increased PD-L1 mRNA expression in these cell lines. CXCL2 is therefore considered to have a potential to induce PD-L1 expression in lung adenocarcinoma cells as a result of an interaction between carcinoma cells and CAFs. These findings did firstly demonstrate that CAFs indirectly influenced tumour  through increasing PD-L1 expression in lung adenocarcinoma cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625033>Role of JAM-A  phosphorylation in epithelial barrier dysfunction during intestinal inflammation.</a></h2><p>Junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A), an epithelial tight junction protein, plays an important role in regulating intestinal permeability through association with a scaffold signaling complex containing ZO-2, Afadin, and the small GTPase Rap2. Under inflammatory conditions, we report that the cytoplasmic tail of JAM-A is  phosphorylated (p-Y280) in association with loss of barrier function. While barely detectable Y280 phosphorylation was observed in confluent monolayers of human intestinal epithelial cells under basal conditions, exposure to cytokines TNFα, IFNγ, IL-22, or IL-17A, resulted in compromised barrier function in parallel with increased p-Y280. Phosphorylation was Src kinase dependent, and we identified Yes-1 and PTPN13 as a major kinase and phosphatase for p-JAM-A Y280, respectively. Moreover, cytokines IL-22 or IL-17A induced increased activity of Yes-1. Furthermore, the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 rescued cytokine-induced epithelial barrier defects and inhibited phosphorylation of JAM-A Y280 in vitro. Phosphorylation of JAM-A Y280 and increased permeability correlated with reduced JAM-A association with active Rap2. Finally, we observed increased phosphorylation of Y280 in colonic epithelium of individuals with ulcerative colitis and in mice with experimentally induced colitis. These findings support a novel mechanism by which  phosphorylation of JAM-A Y280 regulates epithelial barrier function during inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30514903>Glycolipid iGb3 feedback amplifies innate immune responses via CD1d reverse signaling.</a></h2><p>The cross-talk between cellular lipid metabolism and the innate immune responses remains obscure. In addition to presenting lipid antigens to Natural Killer T-cells (NKT cells), the Cluster of Differentiation 1D Glycoprotein (CD1d) might mediate reverse signaling in antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Here we found CD1d deficiency attenuated Toll-like receptor (TLR)-triggered inflammatory innate responses in macrophages and dendritic cells, protecting mice from endotoxin shock. TLR activation in macrophages induced metabolic changes of glycosphingolipids (GSLs), among which glycolipid isoglobotrihexosylceramide (iGb3) was rapidly produced. The endogenously generated iGb3 bound CD1d in endosomal compartments and then synergized with the initially activated TLR signal to induce Tyr332 phosphorylation of CD1d intracellular domain. This led to the recruitment and activation of proline-rich  kinase 2 (Pyk2). Pyk2 interacted with IκB kinase β (IKKβ) and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), and enhanced  phosphorylation of Tyr188/199 of IKKβ and Tyr179 of TBK1 and thus, their activation to promote full activation of TLR signaling. Thus, intracellular CD1d reverse signaling, triggered by endogenous iGb3, amplifies inflammatory innate responses in APCs. Our findings identify a non-canonical function of CD1d reverse signaling activated by lipid metabolite in the innate immune response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631812>A review of checkpoint inhibitors in the management of renal cell carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Renal cell carcinoma is a common malignancy of the genitourinary system and is the eight most common cancer type in the United States. The overall incidence of renal cell carcinoma appears to be increasing but death rates have been declining. Patients with poor risk, advanced disease have a two-year survival rate of approximately 7%. Prior to the advent of  kinase inhibitors, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, and checkpoint inhibitors, IFN-α and high-dose IL-2, were standard of care treatment options but, conversely, their use is now limited to select patients. Immunotherapies have played a significant role in the treatment of various cancers and have continued to expand. It is of utmost importance that practitioners include checkpoint inhibitors as treatment options for renal cell carcinoma as they mark a new era in the treatment of advanced or relapsed setting. Nivolumab, pembrolizumab, avelumab, ipilimumab, and atezolizumab all play a role in management of disease as either monotherapy or in combination with other agents. Ongoing clinical trials are ongoing to further assess the benefits of inducing cellular  in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. In this article, the available data on immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of advanced or relapsed renal cell carcinoma and their place in therapy are reviewed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30356214>Nuclear cGAS suppresses DNA repair and promotes tumorigenesis.</a></h2><p>Accurate repair of DNA double-stranded breaks by homologous recombination preserves genome integrity and inhibits tumorigenesis. Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is a cytosolic DNA sensor that activates innate  by initiating the STING-IRF3-type I IFN signalling cascade. Recognition of ruptured micronuclei by cGAS links genome instability to the innate immune response, but the potential involvement of cGAS in DNA repair remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that cGAS inhibits homologous recombination in mouse and human models. DNA damage induces nuclear translocation of cGAS in a manner that is dependent on importin-α, and the phosphorylation of cGAS at  215-mediated by B-lymphoid  kinase-facilitates the cytosolic retention of cGAS. In the nucleus, cGAS is recruited to double-stranded breaks and interacts with PARP1 via poly(ADP-ribose). The cGAS-PARP1 interaction impedes the formation of the PARP1-Timeless complex, and thereby suppresses homologous recombination. We show that knockdown of cGAS suppresses DNA damage and inhibits tumour growth both in vitro and in vivo. We conclude that nuclear cGAS suppresses homologous-recombination-mediated repair and promotes tumour growth, and that cGAS therefore represents a potential target for cancer prevention and therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30429880>Sonodynamic therapy-induced foam cells apoptosis activates the phagocytic PPARγ-LXRα-ABCA1/ABCG1 pathway and promotes cholesterol efflux in advanced plaque.</a></h2><p>In advanced atherosclerotic plaques, defective efferocytosis of apoptotic foam cells and decreased cholesterol efflux contribute to lesion progression. In our previous study, we demonstrated that 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-mediated sonodynamic therapy (SDT) could induce foam cells apoptosis via the mitochondrial-caspase pathway. In the current research, we sought to explore ALA-SDT-induced apoptosis of phagocytes and the effects of cholesterol efflux and efferocytosis in advanced apoE mice plaque.  apoE mice fed western diet were treated with ALA-SDT and sacrificed at day 1, day 3, day 7 and day 28 post treatment. THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells were treated with ALA-SDT. 5 hours later, the supernatant was collected and added to fresh foam cells (phagocytes). Then, the lipid area, efferocytosis, cholesterol efflux, anti-inflammatory reactions and PPARγ-LXRα-ABCA1/ABCG1 pathway were detected in plaque  and in phagocytes .  We found that ALA-SDT induced foam cells apoptosis coupled with efferocytosis and upregulation of Mer  kinase (MerTK) both  and . The lipid content in plaque decreased as early as 1 day after ALA-SDT and this tendency persisted until 28 days. The enhancement of phagocytes cholesterol efflux was accompanied by an approximately 40% decrease in free cholesterol and a 24% decrease in total cholesterol . More importantly, anti-inflammatory factors such as TGFβ and IL-10 were upregulated by ALA-SDT treatment. Finally, we found that PPARγ-LXRα-ABCA1/ABCG1 pathway was activated both  and  by ALA-SDT, which could be blocked by PPARγ siRNA.  Activation of PPARγ-LXRα-ABCA1/ABCG1 pathway induced by ALA-SDT treatment engages a virtuous cycle that enhances efferocytosis, cholesterol efflux and anti-inflammatory reactions in advanced plaque  and in phagocytes .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311882>Axl Promotes Zika Virus Entry and Modulates the Antiviral State of Human Sertoli Cells.</a></h2><p>Zika virus (ZIKV) is unique among mosquito-borne flaviviruses in its ability to be sexually transmitted. Persistent ZIKV infection in the testes, which are immune privileged organs, long after peripheral clearance suggests involvement of immunosuppressive pathways; however, the underlying mechanisms remain undetermined. We recently demonstrated that ZIKV infects human Sertoli cells (SC), the major cell type of the seminiferous epithelium responsible for maintaining the immune privileged compartment of seminiferous tubules. Recent reports have identified the TAM (Tyro3, Axl, Mer) receptor  kinase Axl as an entry receptor and/or immune modulator for ZIKV in a cell type-specific manner. Interestingly, the seminiferous epithelium exhibits high basal expression of the Axl receptor where it is involved in clearance of apoptotic germ cells and immunosuppression. Here, we show that Axl was highly expressed in SC compared to Leydig cells (LC) that correlated with robust ZIKV infection of SC, but not LC. Further, neutralization of Axl receptor and its ligand Gas6 strongly attenuated virus entry in SC. However, inhibition of Axl kinase did not affect ZIKV entry but instead led to decreased protein levels of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) and SOCS3, increased expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), and reduced ZIKV replication. Similarly, treatment of multicellular human testicular organoids with an Axl kinase inhibitor attenuated ZIKV replication and increased ISG expression. Together, our data demonstrate that Axl promotes ZIKV entry and negatively regulates the antiviral state of SC to augment ZIKV infection of the testes and provides new insights into testis antiviral  and ZIKV persistence. Recent Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreaks have identified sexual transmission as a new route of disease spread not reported for other flaviviruses. ZIKV crosses the blood-testis barrier and establishes infection in seminiferous tubules, the site for spermatozoa development. Currently, there are no therapies to treat ZIKV infection, and the immune mechanisms underlying testicular persistence are unclear. We found that multiple human testicular cell types, except Leydig cells, support ZIKV infection. Axl receptor, which plays a pivotal role in maintaining the immunosuppressive milieu of the testis, is highly expressed in Sertoli cells and augments ZIKV infection by promoting virus entry and negatively regulating the antiviral state. By using testicular organoids, we further describe the antiviral role of Axl inhibition. The significance of our research lies in defining cross talk between Axl and type I interferon signaling as an essential mechanism of immune control that can inform therapeutic efforts to clear ZIKV from the testis.Copyright © 2019 Strange et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30336126>A platform for assessing outer segment fate in primary human fetal RPE cultures.</a></h2><p>The daily shedding and renewal of photoreceptor outer segments (OS) is critical for maintaining vision. This process relies on the efficient uptake, degradation, and sorting of shed OS material by the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Poor OS degradation has been linked to retinal degenerations such as Stargardt disease and may contribute to macular degeneration. While primary human fetal RPE cultures have emerged as a valuable model of in vivo human RPE function, surprisingly few studies have utilized the model for tracking the degradation and fate of OS components in the RPE. Here, we establish an improved platform for studying this topic by modifying existing protocols and creating new methods. Our human fetal culture model facilitates studies of RPE secretion in response to OS ingestion, preserves RPE differentiation and polarization during live-cell imaging of OS phagocytosis, and minimizes costs. We optimize Mer  kinase-dependent OS phagocytosis assays specifically in human fetal cultures and provide a simple and accurate method for measuring total OS consumption by the RPE. Finally, we utilize chemical transfection, dextran labeling, and immunocytochemistry to evaluate key players in OS degradation, including lysosomes and autophagy proteins. To facilitate quantification of autophagy vesicles, we develop customized image analysis macros in the Fiji/ImageJ software environment. These protocols will facilitate a broad range of studies in human fetal RPE cultures aimed at determining the ultimate fate of OS components after ingestion, a critical step in understanding the pathogenesis of numerous retinal diseases.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of ANAs as a prognostic factor in CLL.This study retrospectively analyzed clinical data from 216 newly diagnosed CLL subjects with ANAs test from 2007 to 2017. Multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to screen the independent prognostic factors related to time to first treatment (TTFT), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Receiver operator characteristic curves and area under the curve (AUC) were utilized to assess the predictive accuracy of ANAs together with other independent factors for OS.The incidence of ANAs abnormality at diagnosis was 13.9%. ANAs positivity and TP53 disruption were independent prognostic indicators for OS. The AUC of positive ANAs together with TP53 disruption was 0.766 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.697-0.826), which was significantly larger than that of either TP53 disruption (AUC: 0.706, 95% CI: 0.634-0.772, P = 0.034) or positive ANAs (AUC: 0.595, 95% CI: 0.520-0.668, P < 0.001) in OS prediction. Besides, serum positive ANAs as one additional parameter to CLL-international prognostic index (IPI) obtained superior AUCs in predicting CLL OS than CLL-IPI alone.This study identified ANAs as an independent prognostic factor for CLL, and further investigations are needed to validate this finding.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30413670>The Transcription Factors PU.1 and IRF4 Determine Dendritic Cell-Specific Expression of RALDH2.</a></h2><p>RALDH2 expressed in dendritic cells (DCs) plays a critical role in the development of regulatory T cells in mesenteric lymph nodes. Despite the importance of RALDH2 in intestinal , little is known about the mechanism of DC-specific expression of RALDH2.

The mRNA level of , and subsequently the enzyme activity, were decreased by knockdown of PU.1 and IRF4 in bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) of BALB/c mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that PU.1 and IRF4 bound to the  gene ∼2 kb upstream from the transcription start site in BMDCs. A reporter assay and an EMSA revealed that the  promoter was synergistically transactivated by a heterodimer composed with PU.1 and IRF4 via the EICE motif at -1961/-1952 of the gene. The effect of small interfering RNAs for  and  and specific binding of PU.1 and IRF4 on the  gene were also observed in DCs freshly isolated from spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes, respectively. GM-CSF stimulation upregulated the  transcription in Flt3 ligand-generated BMDCs, in which the IRF4 expression and the PU.1 recruitment to the  promoter were enhanced. We conclude that PU.1 and IRF4 are transactivators of the  gene in vitro and ex vivo.Copyright © 2018 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30971695>A CRISPR-Cas9 delivery system for in vivo screening of genes in the immune system.</a></h2><p>Therapies that target the function of immune cells have significant clinical efficacy in diseases such as cancer and autoimmunity.

The aim of this study was to examine the levels of the soluble forms of coinhibitory receptors and their ligands, namely, galectin-9 (the ligand of T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3) and CD155 (the ligand of T cell immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor -based inhibitory motif domain), and their association with clinical features in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). The serum levels of galectin-9 and soluble sCD155 were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in patients with SSc, and the results were evaluated with respect to clinical features. Patients with SSc exhibited raised serum levels of galectin-9, but not sCD155. Serum galectin-9 levels were raised not only in patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc but also in patients with limited cutaneous SSc. Furthermore, serum galectin-9 levels correlated positively with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. In addition, increased serum galectin-9 levels tended to be associated with higher mortality and serious organ involvement. These results suggest that galectin-9, but not CD155, may be involved in the pathogenesis of SSc. In addition, the measurement of serum galectin-9 levels could be used to predict serious organ involvement and high mortality in patients with SSc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31229844>Ablation of core fucosylation attenuates the signal transduction via T cell receptor to suppress the T cell development.</a></h2><p>Precise glycosylation plays a crucial and distinctive role in thymic T cell development. The core fucosylation is dramatically up-regulated at the transition from CD4CD8 (DN) to CD4CD8 (DP) in the thymic development. Ablation of core fucosylation in T cells did reduce the size of the thymus due to a significant loss of CD4 SP, CD8 SP and DP thymocytes in core fucosyltransferase (Fut8) knockout (Fut8) mice. T cell receptors (TCRs) are heavily core fucosylated glycoproteins. Loss of core fucosylation of TCR contributed to the reduced phosphorylation of ZAP70 (pZAP70) in Fut8 DP cells was observed. Compare to the Fut8OT-II DP thymocytes, pZAP70 was significantly reduced in Fut8 OT-II DP thymocytes with OVA stimulation. Also, the pZAP70 of Fut8OT-I DP thymocytes with OVA stimulation was remarkably attenuated by treatment of the fucosidase. Upon anti-CD3/CD28 Abs stimulation, the increased apoptosis was found in Fut8 thymocytes compared with Fut8 thymocytes. Moreover, the TCRCD69 (post-positive selection thymocytes) was markedly depleted in the Fut8 thymus without any stimulation. The expression of CD5 was significantly down-regulated on the DP cells in the Fut8 thymus. Our results therefore demonstrate that ablation of core fucosylation results in the abnormal T cell development due to the attenuated signaling via TCR.Copyright © 2019.

Three adaptors, LAT, Gads, and SLP-76, form a heterotrimeric complex that mediates signaling by the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) and by the mast cell high affinity receptor for IgE (FcεRI). In both pathways, antigen recognition triggers  phosphorylation of LAT and SLP-76. The recruitment of SLP-76 to phospho-LAT is bridged by Gads, a Grb2 family adaptor composed of two SH3 domains flanking a central SH2 domain and an unstructured linker region. The LAT-Gads-SLP-76 complex is further incorporated into larger microclusters that mediate antigen receptor signaling. Gads is positively regulated by dimerization, which promotes its cooperative binding to LAT. Negative regulation occurs via phosphorylation or caspase-mediated cleavage of the linker region of Gads. FcεRI-mediated mast cell activation is profoundly impaired in LAT- Gads- or SLP-76-deficient mice. Unexpectedly, the thymic developmental phenotype of Gads-deficient mice is much milder than the phenotype of LAT- or SLP-76-deficient mice. This distinction suggests that Gads is not absolutely required for TCR signaling, but may modulate its sensitivity, or regulate a particular branch of the TCR signaling pathway; indeed, the phenotypic similarity of Gads- and Itk-deficient mice suggests a functional connection between Gads and Itk. Additional Gads binding partners include costimulatory proteins such as CD28 and CD6, adaptors such as Shc, ubiquitin regulatory proteins such as USP8 and AMSH, and kinases such as HPK1 and BCR-ABL, but the functional implications of these interactions are not yet fully understood. No interacting proteins or function have been ascribed to the evolutionarily conserved N-terminal SH3 of Gads.

The peroxynitrite formed can attack a wide range of biomolecules via direct oxidative reactions or indirect radical-mediated mechanisms thus triggering cellular responses leading to cell signaling, oxidative injury, committing cells to necrosis or apoptosis. Cellular DNA is an important target for ONOO- attack, and can react with deoxyribose, nucleobases or induces single strand breaks. The free radical-mediated damage to proteins results in the modification of amino acid residues, cross-linking of side chains and fragmentation. Free/protein-bound tyrosines are attacked by various reactive nitrogen species (RNS), including peroxynitrite, to form free/protein-bound nitrotyrosine (NT). The formation of NT represents a specific peroxynitrite-mediated protein modification, and the detection of NT in proteins is considered as a biomarker for endogenous peroxynitrite activity. The peroxynitrite-driven oxidation and nitration of biomolecules may lead to autoimmunity and age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Hence, peroxynitrite modified DNA and nitrated proteins can act as neoantigens and lead to the generation of autoantibodies against self-components in autoimmune disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846830>The human lung mucosa drives differential Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection outcome in the alveolar epithelium.</a></h2><p>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) is deposited into the alveolus where it first encounters the alveolar lining fluid (ALF) prior contacts host cells. We demonstrated that M.tb-exposure to human ALF alters its cell surface, driving better M.tb infection control by professional phagocytes. Contrary to these findings, our results with non-professional phagocytes alveolar epithelial cells (ATs) define two distinct subsets of human ALFs; where M.tb exposure to Low (L)-ALF or High(H)-ALF results in low or high intracellular bacterial growth rates in ATs, respectively. H-ALF exposed-M.tb growth within ATs was independent of M.tb-uptake, M.tb-trafficking, and M.tb-infection induced cytotoxicity; however, it was associated with enhanced bacterial replication within LAMP-1/ABCA1 compartments. H-ALF exposed-M.tb infection of ATs decreased AT immune mediator production, decreased AT surface adhesion expression, and downregulated macrophage inflammatory responses. Composition analysis of H-ALF vs. L-ALF showed H-ALF with higher protein  nitration and less functional ALF-innate proteins important in M.tb pathogenesis. Replenishment of H-ALF with functional ALF-innate proteins reversed the H-ALF-M.tb growth rate to the levels observed for L-ALF-M.tb. These results indicate that dysfunctionality of innate proteins in the H-ALF phenotype promotes M.tb replication within ATs, while limiting inflammation and phagocyte activation, thus potentiating ATs as a reservoir for M.tb replication and survival.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31044580>Therapies for multiple sclerosis targeting B cells.</a></h2><p>Increasing evidence suggests that B cells contribute both to the regulation of normal autoimmunity and to the pathogenesis of immune mediated diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). B cells in MS are skewed toward a pro-inflammatory profile, and contribute to MS pathogenesis by antibody production, antigen presentation, T cells stimulation and activation, driving autoproliferation of brain-homing autoreactive CD4+ T cells, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and formation of ectopic meningeal germinal centers that drive cortical pathology and contribute to neurological disability. The recent interest in the key role of B cells in MS has been evoked by the profound anti-inflammatory effects of rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting the B cell surface marker CD20, observed in relapsing-remitting MS. This has been reaffirmed by clinical trials with less immunogenic and more potent B cell-depleting mAbs targeting CD20 - ocrelizumab, ofatumumab and ublituximab. Ocrelizumab is also the first disease-modifying drug that has shown efficacy in primary-progressive MS, and is currently approved for both indications. Another promising approach is the inhibition of Bruton's  kinase, a key enzyme that mediates B cell activation and survival, by agents such as evobrutinib. On the other hand, targeting B cell cytokines with the fusion protein atacicept increased MS activity, highlighting the complex and not fully understood role of B cells and humoral  in MS. Finally, all other approved therapies for MS, some of which have been designed to target T cells, have some effects on the frequency, phenotype, or homing of B cells, which may contribute to their therapeutic activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30872773>Renal expression of JAK2 is high in polycystic kidney disease and its inhibition reduces cystogenesis.</a></h2><p>Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common renal genetic disorder, however it still lacks a cure. The discovery of new therapies heavily depends on understanding key signalling pathways that lead to ADPKD. The JAnus Kinase and Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway is aberrantly activated and contributes to ADPKD pathogenesis via enhancing epithelial proliferation. Yet the mechanisms underlying the upregulation of JAK/STAT activity in this disease context is completely unknown. Here, we investigate the role of JAK2 in ADPKD using a murine model of ADPKD (Pkd1). In normal kidneys, JAK2 expression is limited to tubular epithelial and vascular cells with lesser staining in bowman's capsule and remains below detection level in the interstitium. By contrast, in kidneys of mice with ADPKD, JAK2 is higher in cyst-lining cells when compared to normal tubules and critically, it is ectopically expressed in the interstitium, suggesting that ectopic JAK2 may contribute to ADPKD. JAK2 activity was inhibited using either curcumin, a natural compound with strong JAK2 inhibitor activity, or Tofacitinib, a clinically used selective JAK small molecule inhibitor. JAK2 inhibition led to significantly reduced  phosphorylation of STAT3 and markedly reduced cystic growth of human and mouse ADPKD-derived cells in cystogenesis assays. Taken together, our results indicate that blockade of JAK2 shows promise as a novel therapeutic target in ADPKD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31172552>Binding and uptake of single and dual-opsonized targets by macrophages.</a></h2><p>Our current understanding of phagocytosis is largely derived from studies of individual receptor-ligand interactions and their downstream signaling pathways. Because phagocytes are exposed to a variety of ligands on heterogeneous target particles in vivo, it is important to observe the engagement of multiple receptors simultaneously and the triggered involvement of downstream signaling pathways. Potential crosstalk between the two well-characterized opsonic receptors, FcγR and CR3, was briefly explored in the early 1970s, where macrophages were challenged with dual-opsonized targets. However, subsequent studies on receptor crosstalk were primarily restricted to using single opsonins on different targets, typically at saturating opsonin conditions. Beyond validating these initial explorations on receptor crosstalk, we identify the early signaling mechanisms that underlie the binding and phagocytosis during the simultaneous activation of both opsonic receptors, through the presence of a dual-opsonized target (immunoglobulin G [IgG] and C3bi), compared with single receptor activation. For this purpose, we used signaling protein inhibitor studies as well as live cell brightfield and fluorescent imaging to fully understand the role of  kinases, F-actin dynamics and internalization kinetics for FcγR and CR3. Importantly, opsonic receptors were studied together and in isolation, in the context of sparsely opsonized targets. We observed enhanced particle binding and a synergistic effect on particle internalization during the simultaneous activation of FcγR and CR3 engaged with sparsely opsonized targets. Inhibition of early signaling and cytoskeletal molecules revealed a differential involvement of Src kinase for FcγR- vs CR3- and dual receptor-mediated phagocytosis. Src activity recruits Syk kinase and we observed intermediate levels of Syk phosphorylation in dual-opsonized particles compared with those opsonized with IgG or C3bi alone. These results likely explain the intermediate levels of F-actin that is recruited to sites of dual-opsonized particle uptake and the notoriously delayed internalization of C3bi-opsonized targets by macrophages.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31137556>Comparison of Bacterial Populations in the Ceca of Swine at Two Different Stages and their Functional Annotations.</a></h2><p>The microbial composition in the cecum of pig influences host health, , nutrient digestion, and feeding requirements significantly.

Functional annotation of microbiome by level-three KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway analysis revealed that glycine, serine, threonine, valine, leucine, isoleucine arginine, proline, and tryptophan metabolism were differentially enriched in stage L, whereas alanine, aspartate, glutamate, cysteine, methionine, phenylalanine, , and tryptophan biosynthesis metabolism were differentially enriched in stage LD. Through machine-learning approaches such as LEfSe (linear discriminant analysis effect size), random forest, and Pearson's correlation, we found pathways such as amino acid metabolism, transport systems, and genetic regulation of metabolism are commonly enriched in both stages. Our findings suggest that the bacterial compositions in cecum content of pigs are heavily involved in their nutrient digestion process.

By dephosphorylating  residues, PTPs have been shown to modulate enzyme activity and both mediate and disrupt protein-protein interactions. Through these molecular mechanisms, PTPs ultimately impact lymphocyte responses to environmental cues such as inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as antigenic stimulation. Mouse models of acute and chronic intestinal inflammation have been shown to be exacerbated in the absence of PTPs such as PTPN2 and PTPN22. This increase in disease severity is due in part to hyper-activation of lymphocytes in the absence of PTP activity. In accordance, human PTPs have been linked to intestinal inflammation. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) identified several PTPs within risk loci for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Therapeutically targeting PTP substrates and their associated signaling pathways, such as those implicated in CD4 T cell responses, has demonstrated clinical efficacy. The current review focuses on the role of PTPs in controlling CD4 T cell activity in the intestinal mucosa and how disruption of PTP activity in CD4 T cells can contribute to intestinal inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30508136>Clinical significance of Janus Kinase inhibitor selectivity.</a></h2><p>Cytokines are key drivers of inflammation in RA, and anti-cytokine therapy has improved the outcome of RA. Janus Kinases (JAK) are intracellular  kinases linked to intracellular domains of many cytokine receptors. There are four JAK isoforms: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. Different cytokine receptor families utilize specific JAK isoforms for signal transduction. Phosphorylation of JAK when cytokine binds to its cognate receptor leads to phosphorylation of other intracellular molecules that eventually leads to gene transcription. Oral JAK inhibitors (JAKi) have been developed as anti-cytokine therapy in RA. Two JAKi, tofacitinib and baricitinib, have been approved recently for the treatment of RA, and many JAKi are currently in development. JAKi inhibit JAK isoforms with different selectivity. This review discusses the efficacy and safety of JAKi in RA, in particular the potential clinical significance of JAKi selectivity.© The Author(s) 2018.

MLV glycoGag not only enhances MLV replication and disease progression but also increases human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infectivity as Nef does. Recently, SERINC5 (Ser5) was identified as the target for Nef, and the glycoGag Nef-like activity has been attributed to the Ser5 antagonism. Here, we investigated how glycoGag antagonizes Ser5 using MLV glycoMA and murine Ser5 proteins. We confirm previous observations that glycoMA relocalizes Ser5 from plasma membrane to perinuclear punctated compartments and the important role of its YXXL motif in this process. We find that glycoMA decreases Ser5 expression at steady-state levels and identify two other glycoGag crucial residues, P31 and R63, for the Ser5 downregulation. The glycoMA and Ser5 interaction is detected in live cells using a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay. Ser5 is internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis and relocalized to Rab5 early, Rab7 late, and Rab11 recycling endosomes by glycoMA. Although glycoMA is not polyubiquitinated, the Ser5 downregulation requires Ser5 polyubiquitination via the K48- and K63-linkage, resulting in Ser5 destruction in lysosomes. Although P31, Y36, L39, and R63 are not required for glycoMA interaction with Ser5, they are required for Ser5 relocalization to lysosomes for destruction. In addition, although murine Ser1, Ser2, and Ser3 exhibit very poor antiviral activity, they are also targeted by glycoMA for lysosomal destruction. We conclude that glycoGag has a broad activity to downregulate SERINC proteins via the cellular endosome/lysosome pathway, which promotes viral replication. MLV glycoGag not only enhances MLV replication but also increases HIV-1 infectivity similarly as Nef. Recent studies have discovered that both glycoGag and Nef antagonize a novel host restriction factor Ser5 and promote viral replication. Compared to Nef, the glycoGag antagonism of Ser5 is still poorly understood. MLV glycoGag is a transmembrane version of the structural Gag protein with an extra 88-amino-acid leader region that determines its activity. We now show that glycoGag interacts with Ser5 in live cells and internalizes Ser5 via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Ser5 is polyubiquitinated and relocalized to endosomes and lysosomes for massive destruction. In addition to the previously identified -based sorting signal, we find two more important residues for Ser5 relocalization and downregulation. We also find that the Ser5 sensitivity to glycoGag is conserved in the SERINC family. Together, our findings highlight the important role of endosome/lysosome pathway in the enhancement of viral replication by viral proteins.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770800>Tryptophan-kynurenine pathway attenuates β-catenin-dependent pro-parasitic role of STING-TICAM2-IRF3-IDO1 signalosome in Toxoplasma gondii infection.</a></h2><p>Recent studies have documented the diverse role of host  in infection by the protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii. However, the contribution of the β-catenin pathway in this process has not been explored. Here, we show that AKT-mediated phosphorylated β-catenin supports T. gondii multiplication which is arrested in the deficiency of its phosphorylation domain at S552 position. The β-catenin-TCF4 protein complex binds to the promoter region of IRF3 gene and initiates its transcription, which was also abrogated in β-catenin knockout cells. TBK-independent phosphorylation of STING(S366) and its adaptor molecule TICAM2 by phospho-AKT(T308S473) augmented downstream IRF3-dependent IDO1 transcription, which was also dependent on β-catenin. But, proteasomal degradation of IDO1 by its  phosphorylation (at Y115 and Y253) favoured parasite replication. In absence of IDO1, tryptophan was catabolized into melatonin, which supressed cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and boosted parasite growth. Conversely, when  phosphorylation was abolished by phosphosite mutations, IDO1 escaped its ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation system (UPS) and the stable IDO1 prevented parasite replication by kynurenine synthesis. We propose that T. gondii selectively utilizes tryptophan to produce the antioxidant, melatonin, thus prolonging the survival of infected cells through functional AKT and β-catenin activity for better parasite replication. Stable IDO1 in the presence of IFN-γ catabolized tryptophan into kynurenine, promoting cell death by suppressing phospho-AKT and phospho-β-catenin levels, and circumvented parasite replication. Treatment of infected cells with kynurenine or its analogue, teriflunomide suppressed kinase activity of AKT, and phosphorylation of β-catenin triggering caspase-3 dependent apoptosis of infected cells to inhibit parasite growth. Our results demonstrate that β-catenin regulate phosphorylated STING-TICAM2-IRF3-IDO1 signalosome for a cell-intrinsic pro-parasitic role. We propose that the downstream IRF3-IDO1-reliant tryptophan catabolites and their analogues can act as effective immunotherapeutic molecules to control T. gondii replication by impairing the AKT and β-catenin axis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31375130>Comparison of baricitinib, upadacitinib, and tofacitinib mediated regulation of cytokine signaling in human leukocyte subpopulations.</a></h2><p>The in vitro pharmacology of baricitinib, upadacitinib, and tofacitinib was evaluated to understand differences among these JAK inhibitors (JAKis) at the cellular level.Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors were incubated with different JAKis, levels of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription (pSTAT) were measured following cytokine stimulation, and half maximum inhibitory concentration (IC) values were calculated in phenotypically gated leukocyte subpopulations. Therapeutic dose relevance of the in vitro analysis was assessed using calculated mean concentration-time profiles over 24 h obtained from JAKi-treated subjects. Time above IC and average daily percent inhibition of pSTAT formation were calculated for each JAKi, cytokine, and cell type.Distinct JAKis displayed different in vitro pharmacologic profiles. For example, tofacitinib and upadacitinib were the most potent inhibitors of the JAK1/3-dependent cytokines tested (interleukin [IL]-2, IL-4, IL-15, and IL-21) with lower IC values and increased time above IC translating to a greater overall inhibition of STAT signaling during the dosing interval. All JAKis tested inhibited JAK1/2-dependent cytokines (e.g., IL-6 and interferon [IFN]-γ), the JAK1/ kinase 2 (TYK2)-dependent cytokines IL-10 and IFN-α, the JAK2/2-dependent cytokines IL-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and the JAK2/TYK2-dependent cytokine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), but often to significantly differing degrees.Different JAKis modulated distinct cytokine pathways to varying degrees, and no agent potently or continuously inhibited an individual cytokine signaling pathway throughout the dosing interval. Notably, baricitinib inhibited JAK1/3 signaling to a lesser extent than upadacitinib and tofacitinib, while upadacitinib, baricitinib, and tofacitinib inhibited the signaling of JAK2/2-dependent cytokines, including GM-CSF and IL-3, as well as the signaling of the JAK2/TYK2-dependent cytokine G-CSF.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31143189>Myo1f, an Unconventional Long-Tailed Myosin, Is a New Partner for the Adaptor 3BP2 Involved in Mast Cell Migration.</a></h2><p>Mast cell chemotaxis is essential for cell recruitment to target tissues, where these cells play an important role in adaptive and innate . Stem cell factor (SCF) is a major chemoattractant for mast cells. SCF binds to the KIT receptor, thereby triggering  phosphorylation in the cytoplasmic domain and resulting in docking sites for SH2 domain-containing molecules, such as Lyn and Fyn, and the subsequent activation of the small GTPases Rac that are responsible for cytoskeletal reorganization and mast cell migration. In previous works we have reported the role of 3BP2, an adaptor molecule, in mast cells. 3BP2 silencing reduces FcεRI-dependent degranulation, by targeting Lyn and Syk phosphorylation, as well as SCF-dependent cell survival. This study examines its role in SCF-dependent migration and reveals that 3BP2 silencing in human mast cell line (LAD2) impairs cell migration due to SCF and IgE. In that context we found that 3BP2 silencing decreases Rac-2 and Cdc42 GTPase activity. Furthermore, we identified Myo1f, an unconventional type-I myosin, as a new partner for 3BP2. This protein, whose functions have been described as critical for neutrophil migration, remained elusive in mast cells. Myo1f is expressed in mast cells and colocalizes with cortical actin ring. Interestingly, Myo1f-3BP2 interaction is modulated by KIT signaling. Moreover, SCF dependent adhesion and migration through fibronectin is decreased after Myo1f silencing. Furthermore, Myo1f silencing leads to downregulation of β1 and β7 integrins on the mast cell membrane. Overall, Myo1f is a new 3BP2 ligand that connects the adaptor to actin cytoskeleton and both molecules are involved in SCF dependent mast cell migration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30378264>Tumour cell-intrinsic CTLA4 regulates PD-L1 expression in non-small cell lung cancer.</a></h2><p>Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) are immune checkpoint proteins expressed in T cells. Although CTLA4 expression was found in multiple tumours including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues and cells, its function in tumour cells is unknown. Recently, PD-1 was found to be expressed in melanoma cells and to promote tumorigenesis. We found that CTLA4 was expressed in a subset of NSCLC cell lines and in a subgroup of cancer cells within the lung cancer tissues. We further found that in NSCLC cells, anti-CTLA4 antibody can induce PD-L1 expression, which is mediated by CTLA4 and the EGFR pathway involving phosphorylation of MEK and ERK. In CTLA4 knockout cells, EGFR knockout cells or in the presence of an EGFR  kinase inhibitor, anti-CTLA4 antibody was not able to induce PD-L1 expression in NSCLC cells. Moreover, anti-CTLA4 antibody promoted NSCLC cell proliferation in vitro and tumour growth in vivo in the absence of adaptive . These results suggest that tumour cell-intrinsic CTLA4 can regulate PD-L1 expression and cell proliferation, and that anti-CTLA4 antibody, by binding to the tumour cell-intrinsic CTLA4, may result in the activation of the EGFR pathway in cancer cells.© 2018 The Authors.

Two prevalent models of SYK activation exist. The "OR-gate" model contends that SYK can be fully activated by phosphorylation or binding of its SH2 domains to a dual-phosphorylated immune-receptor -based activation motif (ppITAM). An alternative model proposes that SYK activation requires ppITAM binding and phosphorylation of the SH2-kinase linker by a SRC family kinase such as LYN proto-oncogene, SRC family  kinase (LYN). To evaluate these two models, we generated directly comparable unphosphorylated (upSYK) and phosphorylated (pSYK) proteins with or without an N-terminal glutathione -transferase (GST) tag, resulting in monomeric or obligatory dimeric SYK, respectively. We assessed the ability of a ppITAM peptide and LYN to activate these SYK proteins. The ppITAM peptide strongly activated GST-SYK but was less effective in activating upSYK untagged with GST. LYN alone activated untagged upSYK to a greater extent than did ppITAM, and inclusion of both proteins rapidly and fully activated upSYK. Using immunoblot and phosphoproteomic approaches, we correlated the kinetics and order of site-specific SYK phosphorylation. Our results are consistent with the alternative model, indicating that ppITAM binding primes SYK for rapid LYN-mediated phosphorylation of Tyr-352 and then Tyr-348 of the SH2-kinase linker, which facilitates activation loop phosphorylation and full SYK activation. This gradual activation mechanism may also explain how SYK maintains ligand-independent tonic signaling, important for B-cell development and survival.© 2019 Mansueto et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680987>Immunomodulatory Activity of  Kinase Inhibitors to Elicit Cytotoxicity Against Cancer and Viral Infection.</a></h2><p> kinase inhibitors (TKIs) of aberrant  kinase (TK) activity have been widely used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) for decades in clinic. An area of growing interest is the reported ability of TKIs to induce immunomodulatory effects with anti-tumor and anti-viral activity, which appears to be mediated by directly or indirectly acting on immune cells. In selected cases of patients with CML, TKI treatment may be interrupted and a non-drug remission may be observed. In these patients, an immune mechanism of increased anti-tumor cytotoxic activity induced by chronic administration of TKIs has been suggested. TKIs increase some populations of natural killer (NK), NK-LGL, and T-LGLs cells especially in dasatinib treated CML patients infected with cytomegalovirus (CMV). In addition, dasatinib increases responses against CMV and is able to inhibit HIV replication . Recent studies suggest that subclinical reactivation of CMV could drive expansion of specific subsets of NK- and T-cells with both anti-tumoral and anti-viral function. Therefore, the underlying mechanisms implicated in the expansion of this increased anti-tumor and anti-viral cytotoxic activity induced by TKIs could be a new therapeutic approach to take into account against cancer and viral infections such as HIV-1 infection. The present review will briefly summarize the immunomodulatory effects of TKIs on T cells, NKs, and B cells. Therapeutic implications for modulating  against cancer and viral infections and critical open questions are also discussed.Copyright © 2019 Climent and Plana.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31217165>An EGFR-Induced  Lung Tumor Model Identifies Alternative Combination Treatments.</a></h2><p>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-associated mortality.

EVs are involved in a variety of cellular processes under physiological conditions as well as in pathological settings. In particular, they exert profound effects on the innate immune system, and thereby are also capable of modulating adaptive . The mechanisms underlying their interaction with their recipient cells, particularly their preferential association with monocytes and granulocytes in the circulation, however, remain to be further clarified. Surface molecules exposed on EVs are likely to mediate immune recognition and EV uptake by their recipient cells. Here, we investigated the involvement of Tyro3, Axl, and Mer (TAM)  kinase receptors and of integrin CD11b in the binding of platelet-derived EVs, constituting the large majority of circulating EVs, to immune cells in the circulation. Flow cytometry and Western Blotting demonstrated a differential expression of TAM receptors and CD11b on monocytes, granulocytes, and lymphocytes, as well as on monocyte subsets. Of the TAM receptors, only Axl and Mer were detected at low levels on monocytes and granulocytes, but not on lymphocytes. Likewise, CD11b was present on circulating monocytes and granulocytes, but remained undetectable on lymphocytes. Differentiation of monocytes into classical, intermediate, and non-classical monocyte subsets revealed distinct expression patterns of Mer and activated CD11b. Co-incubation of isolated monocytes and granulocytes with platelet-derived EVs showed that the binding of EVs to immune cells was dependent on Ca. Our data do not support a particular role for TAM receptors or for activated CD11b in the association of platelet-derived EVs with monocytes and granulocytes in the circulation, as anti-TAM antibodies did not interfere with EV binding to isolated immune cells, as binding was not dependent on the presence of TIM4 acting synergistically with TAM receptors, and as neither low levels of Gas6, required as a linker between phosphatidylserine (PS) on the EV surface and TAM receptors on immune cells, nor masking of PS on the EV surface did interfere with EV binding.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31231771>Sulfated plant peptide hormones.</a></h2><p>Sulfated peptides are plant hormones that are active at nanomolar concentrations.

STING changes its cellular distribution from ER to perinuclear Golgi, where it activates the protein kinase TBK1 that catalyzes the phosphorylation of IRF3. Here we found that STING trafficking is regulated by myotubularin-related protein (MTMR) 3 and MTMR4, members of protein  phosphatases that dephosphorylate 3' position in phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) and generate PtdIns5P from PtdIns3,5P and PtdIns from PtdIns3P. We established MTMR3 and MTMR4 double knockout (DKO) RAW264.7 macrophage cells and found that they exhibited increased type I interferon production after interferon-stimulatory DNA (ISD) stimulation and herpes simplex virus 1 infection concomitant with enhanced IRF3 phosphorylation. In DKO cells, STING rapidly trafficked from ER to Golgi after ISD stimulation. Notably, DKO cells exhibited enlarged cytosolic puncta positive for PtdIns3P and STING was aberrantly accumulated in this puncta. Taken together, these results suggest that MTMR3 and MTMR4 regulate the production of PtdIns3P, which plays a critical role in suppressing DNA-mediated innate immune responses via modulating STING trafficking.© 2019 Dewi Pamungkas Putri et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699285>Anti-Inflammatory Role of TAM Family of Receptor  Kinases Via Modulating Macrophage Function.</a></h2><p>Macrophage is an important innate immune cell that not only initiates inflammatory responses, but also functions in tissue repair and anti-inflammatory responses. Regulating macrophage activity is thus critical to maintain immune homeostasis. Tyro3, Axl, and Mer are integral membrane proteins that constitute TAM family of receptor  kinases (RTKs). Growing evidence indicates that TAM family receptors play an important role in anti-inflammatory responses through modulating the function of macrophages. First, macrophages can recognize apoptotic bodies through interaction between TAM family receptors expressed on macrophages and their ligands attached to apoptotic bodies. Without TAM signaling, macrophages cannot clear up apoptotic cells, leading to broad inflammation due to over-activation of immune cells. Second, TAM signaling can prevent chronic activation of macrophages by attenuating inflammatory pathways through particular pattern recognition receptors and cytokine receptors. Third, TAM signaling can induce autophagy which is an important mechanism to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages. Fourth, TAM signaling can inhibit polarization of M1 macrophages. In this review, we will focus on mechanisms involved in how TAM family of RTKs can modulate function of macrophage associated with anti-inflammatory responses described above.

Here, we report that a potent type 2 immune response associated with the accumulation of neutrophils, eosinophils and alternatively activated (M2) macrophages was observed in response to sterile microparticles similar in size to wear debris associated with prosthetic implants. Although elevations in interleukin-33 (IL-33) and type 2 cytokines occurred independently of caspase-1 inflammasome signalling, the response was dependent on Bruton's  kinase (BTK). IL-33 was produced by macrophages and BTK-dependent expression of IL-33 by macrophages was sufficient to initiate the type 2 response. Analysis of inflammation in patient periprosthetic tissue also revealed type 2 responses under aseptic conditions in patients undergoing revision surgery. These findings indicate that microparticle-induced sterile inflammation is initiated by macrophages activated to produce IL-33.

Here, we investigate the role of  phosphorylation in the regulation of rice  RESISTANCE 21 (XA21)-mediated . We demonstrate that the juxtamembrane and kinase domain of -expressed XA21 (XA21JK) autophosphorylates on  residues. Directed mutagenesis of four out of the nine  residues in XA21JK reduced autophosphorylation. These sites include Tyr in the juxtamembrane domain, and Tyr, Tyr, and Tyr in the kinase domain. Rice plants expressing XA21-GFP fusion proteins or proteins with these  residues individually mutated to phenylalanine (XA21-GFP), which prevents phosphorylation at these sites, maintain resistance to  pv. . In contrast, plants expressing phosphomimetic XA21 variants with  mutated to aspartate (XA21-GFP) were susceptible. In vitro purified XA21JK, XA21JK, and XA21JK variants are catalytically active, whereas activity was not detected in XA21JK and the four XA21JK variants. We previously demonstrated that interaction of XA21 with the co-receptor OsSERK2 is critical for biological function. Four of the XA21JK variants maintain interaction with OsSERK2 as well as the XA21 binding (XB) proteins XB3 and XB15 in yeast, suggesting that these four  residues are not required for their interaction. Taken together, these results suggest that XA21 is capable of  autophosphorylation, but the identified  residues are not required for activation of XA21-mediated  or interaction with predicted XA21 signaling proteins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886186>A Systems Vaccinology Approach Reveals the Mechanisms of Immunogenic Responses to Hantavax Vaccination in Humans.</a></h2><p>Hantavax is an inactivated vaccine for hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). The immunogenic responses have not been elucidated yet. Here we conducted a cohort study in which 20 healthy subjects were administered four doses of Hantavax during 13-months period. Pre- and post- vaccinated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and sera were analysed by transcriptomic and metabolomic profilings, respectively. Based on neutralizing antibody titers, subjects were subsequently classified into three groups; non responders (NRs), low responders (LRs) and high responders (HRs). Post vaccination differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with innate  and cytokine pathways were highly upregulated. DEG analysis revealed a significant induction of CD69 expression in the HRs. High resolution metabolomics (HRM) analysis showed that correlated to the antibody response, cholesteryl nitrolinoleate, octanoyl-carnitine, , ubiquinone-9, and benzoate were significantly elevated in HRs, while chenodeoxycholic acid and methyl palmitate were upregulated in NRs and LRs, compared with HRs. Additionally, gene-metabolite interaction revealed upregulated gene-metabolite couplings in, folate biosynthesis, nicotinate and nicotinamide, arachidonic acid, thiamine and pyrimidine metabolism in a dose dependent manner in HR group. Collectively, our data provide new insight into the underlying mechanisms of the Hantavax-mediated immunogenicity in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30955811>NLRP3 inflammasome plays an important role in caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion in macrophages infected with Pasteurella multocida.</a></h2><p>Pasteurella multocida is a Gram-negative bacterium that is responsible for a variety of diseases in birds and mammals, including humans. We have previously reported that the P. multocida serotype A strain PmCQ2 causes severe lung pneumonia in bovines. Transcriptomic analysis showed that many genes related to the immune response were significantly upregulated in the lungs of mice infected with P. multocida compared with uninfected mice. However, the mechanism by which P. multocida induces host inflammatory cytokine secretion is poorly understood. In this study, the mechanism of caspase-1 activation and subsequent IL-1β secretion in macrophages infected with P. multocida was elucidated. The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome was shown to be involved in inducing this cellular response. Compared with wild-type macrophages, Nlrp3 macrophages exhibited a clear decrease in caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion in response to P. multocida infection. Furthermore, spleen  kinase (Syk) was indicated to be involved in IL-1β secretion, possibly by regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome. Our results provide new insight into the host proinflammatory immune response against P. multocida and the critical involvement of the NLRP3 inflammasome in this activity.Copyright © 2019.

Here, we demonstrate that CCR7 in addition acts as a potent co-stimulatory molecule in T cell activation. We found that antigen recognition and engagement of the TCR results in CCR7 accumulation at the immunological synapse where CCR7 and the TCR co-localize within sub-synaptic vesicles. We demonstrate that CCR7 triggering alone is sufficient to recruit and activate ZAP70, a critical kinase for T cell activation, through Src kinase, whereas TCR CCR7 co-stimulation results in increased and prolonged ZAP70 kinase activity. Finally, we show that ZAP70, acting as adapter molecule, is critical for CCR7-mediated inside-out signaling to integrins, thereby modulating LFA-1 valency regulation to promote cell adhesion, a key step in immunological synapse formation and efficient T cell activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530751>The HLA ligandome landscape of chronic myeloid leukemia delineates novel T-cell epitopes for immunotherapy.</a></h2><p>Antileukemia  plays an important role in disease control and maintenance of  kinase inhibitor (TKI)-free remission in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Thus, antigen-specific immunotherapy holds promise for strengthening immune control in CML but requires the identification of CML-associated targets. In this study, we used a mass spectrometry-based approach to identify naturally presented HLA class I- and class II-restricted peptides in primary CML samples. Comparative HLA ligandome profiling using a comprehensive dataset of different hematological benign specimens and samples from CML patients in deep molecular remission delineated a panel of novel frequently presented CML-exclusive peptides. These nonmutated target antigens are of particular relevance because our extensive data-mining approach suggests the absence of naturally presented BCR-ABL- and ABL-BCR-derived HLA-restricted peptides and the lack of frequent tumor-exclusive presentation of known cancer/testis and leukemia-associated antigens. Functional characterization revealed spontaneous T-cell responses against the newly identified CML-associated peptides in CML patient samples and their ability to induce multifunctional and cytotoxic antigen-specific T cells de novo in samples from healthy volunteers and CML patients. Thus, these antigens are prime candidates for T-cell-based immunotherapeutic approaches that may prolong TKI-free survival and even mediate cure of CML patients.© 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30657766>Th1 cytokines sensitize HER-expressing breast cancer cells to lapatinib.</a></h2><p>The HER family of receptor  kinases has been linked to deregulation of growth and proliferation for multiple types of cancer. Members have therefore become thefocus of many drug and immune-based therapy innovations. The targeted anti-cancer agent, lapatinib, is a small molecule inhibitor that directly interferes with EGFR (HER-1)and HER-2 signaling, and indirectly reduces HER-3 signaling, thus suppressing important downstream events. A recently-developed dendritic cell-based vaccine against early breast cancer (ductal carcinoma in situ; DCIS) that generates strong Th1-dominated  against HER-2 has induced pathologic complete response in about one-third of immunized individuals. In vitro studies suggested cytokines secreted by Th1 cells could be major contributors to the vaccine effects including induction of apoptosis and suppression of HER expression. With a view toward improving complete response rates, we investigated whether the principle Th1 cytokines (IFN-γ and TNF-α) could act in concert with lapatinib to suppress activity of breast cancer lines in vitro. Lapatinib-sensitive SKBR3, MDA-MB-468 and BT474 cells were incubated with Th1 cytokines, lapatinib, or both. It was found that combined treatment maximized metabolic suppression(Alamar Blue assay), as well as cell death (Trypan Blue) and apoptosis(Annexin V/Propidium Iodide and TMRE staining). Combined drug plus cytokine treatment also maximized suppression of both total and phosphorylated forms of HER-2 and HER-3. Interestingly, when lapatinib resistant lines MDA-MB-453 and JIMT-1 were tested, it was found that the presence of Th1 cytokines appeared to enhance sensitivity for lapatinib-induced metabolic suppression and induction of apoptotic cell death, nearly abrogating drug resistance. These studies provide pre-clinical data suggesting the possibility that targeted drug therapy may be combined with vaccination to enhance anti-cancer effects, and furthermore that robust  in the form of secreted Th1 cytokines may have the capacity to mitigate resistance to targeted drugs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649671>Modulation of TLR4 Sialylation Mediated by a Sialidase Neu1 and Impairment of Its Signaling in  Infected Macrophages.</a></h2><p>Altered sialylation is generally maintained by a fine balance between sialidases and sialyltransferases, which plays an essential role during disease pathogenesis. TLR4 is a membrane-bound highly sialylated glycoprotein predominantly having α2,3-linked sialic acids. It is one of the most important client molecules in the anti-leishmanial innate immune arm. Here, we initiated a comprehensive study on the modulation of TLR4 sialylation in  ()-infected macrophages by a mammalian sialidase/neuraminidase-1 (Neu1) having substrate specificity toward α2,3-linked sialic acids. We observed reduced membrane-associated Neu1 with its decreased enzyme activity in infected macrophages. Moreover, we demonstrated reduced association of Neu1 with TLR4 leading to enhanced sialylation of TLR4 in these infected cells. Conversely, Neu1 over expression exhibited enhanced association of TLR4 with Neu1 leading to reduced sialylation which possibly linked to increased association of TLR4 with its downstream adaptor protein, MyD88. This, in turn, activated downstream MAP kinase signaling pathway, with enhanced nuclear translocation of NFκB that resulted in increased genetic and protein levels expression of Th1 cytokines and effector molecule nitric oxide secretion which ultimately leads to reduced parasite burden in macrophages. This was further validated by Neu1 silencing in infected macrophages which reversed such a situation. Such events strongly confirm the importance of Neu1 in modulation of TLR4 sialylation during parasite infection resulting in impairment of innate immune response. Furthermore, decreased membrane-bound Neu1 in infected macrophages could be attributed to its reduced -phosphorylation as well as diminished association with cathepsin A. Both these phenomenon possibly play significant roles in inhibiting translocation of the sialidase from cytosol to membrane. Taken together, our study first time demonstrated impaired translocation of cytosolic Neu1 to the membrane of -infected macrophages due to impaired phosphorylation of this enzyme. This novel finding establishes a link between enhanced α2,3-linked sialic acids on TLR4 and reduced membrane-bound Neu1 which plays a significant role for inhibiting downstream signaling to establish successful infection in the host cells.Copyright © 2019 Karmakar, Roy and Mandal.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735121>MicroRNA-122 supports robust innate  in hepatocytes by targeting the RTKs/STAT3 signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>MicroRNA-122 (miR-122) is the most abundant microRNA in hepatocytes and a central player in liver biology and disease. Herein, we report a previously unknown role for miR-122 in hepatocyte intrinsic innate . Restoration of miR-122 levels in hepatoma cells markedly enhanced the activation of interferons (IFNs) in response to a variety of viral nucleic acids or simulations, especially in response to hepatitis C virus RNA and poly (I:C). Mechanistically, miR-122 downregulated the phosphorylation (Tyr705) of STAT3, thereby removing the negative regulation of STAT3 on IFN-signaling. STAT3 represses IFN expression by inhibiting interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), whereas miR-122 targets MERTK, FGFR1 and IGF1R, three receptor  kinases (RTKs) that directly promote STAT3 phosphorylation. This work identifies a miR-122-RTKs/STAT3-IRF1-IFNs regulatory circuitry, which may play a pivotal role in regulating hepatocyte innate .

The substrates exhibit antibodies directed against the TCR-complex in the form of a patterned array of sub micrometric dots surrounded by a fluid supported lipid bilayer (SLB) which may itself be functionalized with another bio-molecule. We show that for T cell adhesion mediated by T cell receptor (TCR) alone, in the patterned, but not in the corresponding homogeneous controls, the TCR, ZAP-70 and actin are present in the form of clusters or patches that co-localize with the ligand-dots. However, global cell scale parameters like cell area and actin distribution are only weakly impacted by ligand clustering. In presence of ICAM-1 - the ligand of the T cell integrin LFA-1 - on the SLB, the TCR is still clustered due to the patterning of its ligands, but now global parameters are also impacted. The actin organization changes to a peripheral ring, resembling the classical actin distribution seen on homogeneous substrates, the patterned membrane topography disappears and the membrane is flat, whereas the cell area increases significantly. These observations taken together point to a possible pivotal role for LFA-1 in amplifying the effect of TCR-clustering. No such effect is evident for co-engagement of CD28, affected  its ligand B7.2. Unlike on ICAM-1, on B7.2 cell spreading and actin organization are similar for homogeneous and patterned substrates. However, TCR and ZAP-70 clusters are still formed in the patterned case. These results indicate complementary role for LFA-1 and CD28 in the regulation and putative coupling of TCR micro-clusters to actin. The engineered substrates presented here clearly have the potential to act as platform for fundamental research in immune cell biology, as well as translational analyses in immunotherapy, for example to screen molecules for their role in T cell adhesion/activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30315204>Effects of dietary protein restriction followed by realimentation on growth performance and liver transcriptome alterations of lamb.</a></h2><p>The present study aimed to investigate the compensatory effect of early protein restriction followed by a realimentation on growth performance of lamb and to explore the transcriptomic changes in liver. Thirty-two lambs with an initial birth weight of 2.3 ± 0.20 kg that were weaned on day 15 were randomly divided into two groups. The lambs were fed a basal diet with normal protein level (NPL, protein level in the milk replacer and starter, 25 and 21%, respectively) or low protein level (LPL, protein level in the milk replacer and starter, 19 and 15%, respectively) from 15 to 60 d, after which all lambs consumed the same diet with a normal protein level from 61 to 90 d. Protein restriction led to a significant decrease in average daily gain (ADG), body weight and liver weight (P < 0.05). Transcriptome analysis showed that 302 or 12 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified during the restriction or recovery periods, respectively (P < 0.05). The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis indicated that DEGs enriched in nutrient metabolism and antioxidant capacity were down-regulated, while vessel development and  response-related genes up-regulated. The genes involved in metabolism of  were still down-regulated in the realimentation phase. Studies in this area indicated the accelerated growth effect of early protein restriction followed by a realimentation on growth performance of lambs and explored the transcriptomics change of liver which can help to develop feeding strategies to optimize the use of feedstuffs and in providing a new perspective for the study of early nutrition and epigenetics in later life.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30718299>NK Cells Require Cell-Extrinsic and -Intrinsic TYK2 for Full Functionality in Tumor Surveillance and Antibacterial .</a></h2><p> kinase 2 (TYK2) is a widely expressed receptor-associated kinase that is involved in signaling by a variety of cytokines with important immune regulatory activities. Absence of TYK2 in mice results in impaired NK cell maturation and antitumor activity, although underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Using conditional ablation of TYK2 in NK cells we show that TYK2 is required for IFN-γ production by NK cells in response to IL-12 and for an efficient immune defense against  Deletion of TYK2 in NK cells did not impact NK cell maturation and IFN-γ production upon NK cell activating receptor (actR) stimulation. Similarly, NK cell-mediated tumor surveillance was unimpaired upon deletion of TYK2 in NK cells only. In line with the previously reported maturation-associated  promoter demethylation, the less mature phenotype of  NK cells correlated with an increased CpG methylation at the  locus. Treatment with the DNA hypomethylating agent 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine restored the ability of  NK cells to produce IFN-γ upon actR but not upon IL-12 stimulation. NK cell maturation was dependent on the presence of TYK2 in dendritic cells and could be rescued in Tyk2-deficient mice by treatment with exogenous IL-15/IL-15Rα complexes. IL-15 treatment also rescued the in vitro cytotoxicity defect and the impaired actR-induced IFN-γ production of  NK cells.

The removal of apoptotic cells prevents them from undergoing secondary necrosis and releasing their inflammation-inducing intracellular contents. Efferocytosis also limits tissue damage by increasing immunosuppressive cytokines and leukocytes and maintains tissue homeostasis by promoting tolerance to antigens derived from apoptotic cells. Thus, tumor cell efferocytosis following cytotoxic cancer treatment could impart tolerance to tumor cells evading treatment-induced apoptosis with deleterious consequences in tumor residual disease. We report here that efferocytosis cleared apoptotic tumor cells in residual disease of lapatinib-treated HER2 mammary tumors in MMTV-Neu mice, increased immunosuppressive cytokines, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), and regulatory T cells (Treg). Blockade of efferocytosis induced secondary necrosis of apoptotic cells, but failed to prevent increased tumor MDSCs, Treg, and immunosuppressive cytokines. We found that efferocytosis stimulated expression of IFN-γ, which stimulated the expression of indoleamine-2,3-dioxegenase (IDO) 1, an immune regulator known for driving maternal-fetal antigen tolerance. Combined inhibition of efferocytosis and IDO1 in tumor residual disease decreased apoptotic cell- and necrotic cell-induced immunosuppressive phenotypes, blocked tumor metastasis, and caused tumor regression in 60% of MMTV-Neu mice. This suggests that apoptotic and necrotic tumor cells, via efferocytosis and IDO1, respectively, promote tumor 'homeostasis' and progression. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings show in a model of HER2 breast cancer that necrosis secondary to impaired efferocytosis activates IDO1 to drive immunosuppression and tumor progression.©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31463627>Variable impact of three different antiangiogenic drugs alone or in combination with chemotherapy on multiple bone marrow-derived cell populations involved in angiogenesis and .</a></h2><p>In contrast to VEGF pathway-targeting antibodies, antiangiogenic  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have failed to meet primary endpoints in almost all phase III clinical trials when combined with conventional chemotherapy. One exception is the combination of nintedanib and docetaxel as a second-line therapy for rapidly progressing advanced NSCLC. In addition to increased toxicity caused by this type of combination, thus necessitating drug dose reductions or treatment breaks, such phase III trial failures may also be related to the differential impact of host-mediated responses involving mobilization and tumor infiltration of bone marrow-derived cell populations (BMDCs), comprising both pro-angiogenic as well as immune effector cells. Herein, we evaluated two different antiangiogenic TKIs (sunitinib or nintedanib) and a VEGFR-2 antibody (DC101) either alone or combined with maximum tolerated dose paclitaxel for their differential impact on the BMDC host response, evaluating four different cell types. TKIs (in particular sunitinib) induced myelosuppression similar to paclitaxel, whereas DC101 had no such effect. Sunitinib also significantly decreased the number of tumor-infiltrating CD8 + T and B cells, MDSCs, and macrophages. In contrast, the effect of nintedanib on these BMDC populations was less marked, behaving closer to the VEGFR-2 antibody effects than sunitinib. The results raise the possibility that differences observed between antiangiogenic antibodies and TKIs in increasing chemotherapy efficacy could be related, at least in part, to differential effects on cells associated with local  within the tumor microenvironment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30274229>Redox Signaling of NADPH Oxidases Regulates Oxidative Stress Responses,  and Aging.</a></h2><p>An accumulating body of evidence suggests that transient or physiological reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases act as a redox signal to re-establish homeostasis. The capacity to re-establish homeostasis progressively declines during aging but is maintained in long-lived animals to promote healthy aging. In the model organism , ROS generated by dual oxidases (Duox) are important for extracellular matrix integrity, pathogen defense, oxidative stress resistance, and longevity. The Duox enzymatic activity is tightly regulated and under cellular control. Developmental molting cycles, pathogen infections, toxins, mitochondrial-derived ROS, drugs, and small GTPases (e.g., RHO-1) can activate Duox (BLI-3) to generate ROS, whereas NADPH oxidase inhibitors and negative regulators, such as MEMO-1, can inhibit Duox from generating ROS. Three mechanisms-of-action have been discovered for the Duox/BLI-3-generated ROS: (1) enzymatic activity to catalyze crosslinking of free  ethyl ester in collagen bundles to stabilize extracellular matrices, (2) high ROS bursts/levels to kill pathogens, and (3) redox signaling activating downstream kinase cascades to transcription factors orchestrating oxidative stress and  responses to re-establish homeostasis. Although Duox function at the cell surface is well established, recent genetic and biochemical data also suggests a novel role for Duoxs at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane to control redox signaling. Evidence underlying these mechanisms initiated by ROS from NADPH oxidases, and their relevance for human aging, are discussed in this review. Appropriately controlling NADPH oxidase activity for local and physiological redox signaling to maintain cellular homeostasis might be a therapeutic strategy to promote healthy aging.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30460991>A sequence conserved between CD5 and CD6 binds an FERM domain and exerts a restraint on T-cell activation.</a></h2><p>CD5 and CD6 are related surface receptors that limit and promote T-cell responses. Co-stimulatory effects of CD6 depend on binding a cell surface ligand, CD166, and recruitment of the intracellular adaptor proteins GADS and SLP-76 by C-terminal phosphotyrosines. We have continued to identify interactions of CD5 and CD6 to understand their roles in T-cell activation. In a screen to identify binding partners for peptides containing a cytoplasmic sequence, SDSDY conserved between CD5 and CD6, we identified ezrin radixin moesin (ERM) proteins, which link plasma membrane proteins to actin. Purified radixin FERM domain bound directly to CD5 and CD6 SDSDY peptides in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (K = 0·5-2 μm) at 37°. In human T-cell blasts, mutation of the CD6 SDSDY sequence enhanced CD69 expression in response to CD3 monoclonal antibody. In this proximal readout, interactions of the SDSDY sequence were dominant compared with the C-terminal tyrosines of CD6. In contrast, in a more downstream readout, interleukin-2 expression, in response to immobilized CD3 and CD6 monoclonal antibodies, the C-terminal tyrosines were dominant. The data suggest that varying functional effects of CD6 and potentially CD5 depend on interactions of different cytoplasmic regions with the cytoskeleton and alter depending on the stimuli.© 2018 The Authors.

Interactions of LCK proto-oncogene, SRC family  kinase (LCK), and the IL-2-inducible T cell kinase (ITK) with the T cell-specific adapter protein (TSAD) promotes LCK-mediated phosphorylation and thereby ITK activation. Both ITK and LCK interact with TSAD's proline-rich region (PRR) through their Src homology 3 (SH3) domains. Whereas LCK may also interact with TSAD through its SH2 domain, ITK interacts with TSAD only through its SH3 domain. To begin to understand on a molecular level how the LCK SH3 and ITK SH3 domains interact with TSAD in human HEK293T cells, here we combined biochemical analyses with NMR spectroscopy. We found that the ITK and LCK SH3 domains potentially have adjacent and overlapping binding sites within the TSAD PRR amino acids (aa) 239-274. Pulldown experiments and NMR spectroscopy revealed that both domains may bind to TSAD aa 239-256 and aa 257-274. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments further revealed that both domains may also bind simultaneously to TSAD aa 242-268. Accordingly, NMR spectroscopy indicated that the SH3 domains may compete for these two adjacent binding sites. We propose that once the associations of ITK and LCK with TSAD promote the ITK and LCK interaction, the interactions among TSAD, ITK, and LCK are dynamically altered by ITK phosphorylation status.© 2019 Andersen et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31512745>Identification of novel key lncRNAs involved in periodontitis by weighted gene co-expression network analysis.</a></h2><p>Periodontitis is a multifactorial disease that can lead to the progressive destruction of dental support tissue. However, the detailed mechanisms and specific biomarkers involved in periodontitis remain to be further studied. Recently, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been found to play a more important role than other types of RNAs. In our study, we analysed the expression of lncRNAs in periodontitis by analysing GSE16134.We identified highly correlated genes by analysing GSE16134 with weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and identified 50 hub lncRNAs that were dysregulated. Then, we used the Linear Models for Microarray Data (Limma) package to identify the hub lncRNAs that were differentially expressed (DElncRNAs). The ceRNA co-expression network data were obtained from several sites, including miRcode, and were used to assess the potential WGCNA function of hub DElncRNAs in periodontitis. Besides, we divided the samples into LBX2-AS1 high and low expression group by the expression level of LBX2-AS1 and calculated DEG by Limma package. Furthermore, we performed GO function, KEGG pathway and GSEA enrichment of DEGs.In the analysis, we identified 50 hub lncRNAs that may play important roles in periodontitis. Then, we used the Limma package to identify 3 hub DElncRNAs (LINC00687, LBX2-AS1 and LINC01566). We elucidated the potential function of the hub DElncRNA LBX2-AS1 in periodontitis by constructing a co-expression network of lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions. Totally, 573 DEGs (354 up- and 219 downregulated) in periodontitis samples were identified. DEGs were enriched in different GO terms and pathways, such as neutrophil degranulation, neutrophil activation, neutrophil activation involved in immune response, neutrophil-mediated , antigen processing and presentation, JAK-STAT signalling pathway, natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, EGFR  kinase inhibitor resistance, phosphatidylinositol signalling system and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) signalling pathway.In our study, we found that 3 hub DElncRNAs (LINC00687, LBX2-AS1 and LINC01566) may be involved in the pathogenesis of periodontitis based on WGCNA and Limma analysis.

Here we show that PRL3-zumab specifically inhibits PRL3 cancer cells in vivo, but not in vitro. PRL3 antigens are detected on the cell surface and outer exosomal membranes, implying an 'inside-out' externalization of PRL3. PRL3-zumab binds to surface PRL3 in a manner consistent with that in classical antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity or antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis tumor elimination pathways, as PRL3-zumab requires an intact Fc region and host FcγII/III receptor engagement to recruit B cells, NK cells and macrophages to PRL3 tumor microenvironments. PRL3 is overexpressed in 80.6% of 151 fresh-frozen tumor samples across 11 common cancers examined, but not in patient-matched normal tissues, thereby implicating PRL3 as a tumor-associated antigen.

CARD9 promotes the recruitment of neutrophils to the fungus-infected CNS, which mediates fungal clearance. In the present study we investigated host and pathogen factors that promote protective neutrophil recruitment during invasion of the CNS by Candida albicans. The cytokine IL-1β served an essential function in CNS antifungal  by driving production of the chemokine CXCL1, which recruited neutrophils expressing the chemokine receptor CXCR2. Neutrophil-recruiting production of IL-1β and CXCL1 was induced in microglia by the fungus-secreted toxin Candidalysin, in a manner dependent on the kinase p38 and the transcription factor c-Fos. Notably, microglia relied on CARD9 for production of IL-1β, via both transcriptional regulation of Il1b and inflammasome activation, and of CXCL1 in the fungus-infected CNS. Microglia-specific Card9 deletion impaired the production of IL-1β and CXCL1 and neutrophil recruitment, and increased fungal proliferation in the CNS. Thus, an intricate network of host-pathogen interactions promotes antifungal  in the CNS; this is impaired in human deficiency in CARD9, which leads to fungal disease of the CNS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31420873>The impacts of zanubrutinib on immune cells in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma.</a></h2><p>Ibrutinib, a first-generation Bruton's  kinase (BTK) inhibitor, could improve  of relapsed or refractory (R/R) chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) patients. Whether zanubrutinib, a second-generation selective BTK inhibitor, has similar effects as ibrutinib remains to be determined. Dynamics of number and immunophenotype of immune cells during zanubrutinib treatment in 25 R/R CLL/SLL patients were examined by flow cytometry and blood routine tests. The expression intensity of programmed death-1 (PD-1) on total CD4 (P < .01), total CD8 (P < .01), and T helper cells (P < .05) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) on total CD4 (P = .010) and regulatory T cells (P < .05) reduced after treatment. There were significant differences in expression intensity of CD19 (P < .01), C-X-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CXCR5) (P < .01), and CD49d (P < .05) on B cells before and after treatment. Downregulation of PD-1 on T cells and CXCR5 and CD19 on B cells were observed in nearly all patients after zanubrutinib treatment. Programmed death-ligand 1 expression downregulated, especially in the female, CLL, normal spleen, normal β2-macroglobulin (β2-MG) and abnormal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) subgroups, and CTLA-4 expression on CD4+ T cells tended to decrease in the male, old, CLL, splenomegaly, abnormal β2-MG, normal LDH, IGHV-mutated and wild-type tumor protein 53 subgroups after zanubrutinib treatment. These findings suggest that zanubrutinib can regulate  primarily by improving T cell exhaustion, inhibiting suppressor cells and disrupting CLL cells migration through downregulation of adhesion/homing receptors. Furthermore, favorable changes in cell number and immunophenotype were preferably observed in patients without adverse prognostic factors.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30455690>ATF3 Sustains IL-22-Induced STAT3 Phosphorylation to Maintain Mucosal  Through Inhibiting Phosphatases.</a></h2><p>In gut epithelium, IL-22 transmits signals through STAT3 phosphorylation (pSTAT3) which provides intestinal . Many components in the IL-22-pSTAT3 pathway have been identified as risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and some of them are considered as promising therapeutic targets. However, new perspectives are still needed to understand IL-22-pSTAT3 signaling for effective clinical interventions in IBD patients. Here, we revealed activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), recently identified to be upregulated in patients with active IBD, as a crucial player in the epithelial IL-22-pSTAT3 signaling cascade. We found ATF3 is central to intestinal homeostasis and provides protection during colitis. Loss of ATF3 led to decreased crypt numbers, more shortened colon length, impaired ileal fucosylation at the steady state, and lethal disease activity during DSS-induced colitis which can be effectively ameliorated by rectal transplantation of wild-type colonic organoids. Epithelial stem cells and Paneth cells form a niche to orchestrate epithelial regeneration and host-microbe interactions, and IL-22-pSTAT3 signaling is a key guardian for this niche. We found ATF3 is critical for niche maintenance as ATF3 deficiency caused compromised stem cell growth and regeneration, as well as Paneth cell degeneration and loss of anti-microbial peptide (AMP)-producing granules, indicative of malfunction of Paneth/stem cell network. Mechanistically, we found IL-22 upregulates ATF3, which is required to relay IL-22 signaling leading to STAT3 phosphorylation and subsequent AMP induction. Intriguingly, ATF3 itself does not act on STAT3 directly, instead ATF3 regulates pSTAT3 by negatively targeting protein  phosphatases (PTPs) including SHP2 and PTP-Meg2. Furthermore, we identified ATF3 is also involved in IL-6-mediated STAT3 activation in T cells and loss of ATF3 leads to reduced capacity of Th17 cells to produce their signature cytokine IL-22 and IL-17A. Collectively, our results suggest that via IL-22-pSTAT3 signaling in the epithelium and IL-6-pSTAT3 signaling in Th17 cells, ATF3 mediates a cross-regulation in the barrier to maintain mucosal homeostasis and .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30971437>Dietary supplementation with inulin-propionate ester or inulin improves insulin sensitivity in adults with overweight and obesity with distinct effects on the gut microbiota, plasma metabolome and systemic inflammatory responses: a randomised cross-over trial.</a></h2><p>To investigate the underlying mechanisms behind changes in glucose homeostasis with delivery of propionate to the human colon by comprehensive and coordinated analysis of gut bacterial composition, plasma metabolome and immune responses.Twelve non-diabetic adults with overweight and obesity received 20 g/day of inulin-propionate ester (IPE), designed to selectively deliver propionate to the colon, a high-fermentable fibre control (inulin) and a low-fermentable fibre control (cellulose) in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design. Outcome measurements of metabolic responses, inflammatory markers and gut bacterial composition were analysed at the end of each 42-day supplementation period.Both IPE and inulin supplementation improved insulin resistance compared with cellulose supplementation, measured by homeostatic model assessment 2 (mean±SEM 1.23±0.17 IPE vs 1.59±0.17 cellulose, p=0.001; 1.17±0.15 inulin vs 1.59±0.17 cellulose, p=0.009), with no differences between IPE and inulin (p=0.272). Fasting insulin was only associated positively with plasma  and negatively with plasma glycine following inulin supplementation. IPE supplementation decreased proinflammatory interleukin-8 levels compared with cellulose, while inulin had no impact on the systemic inflammatory markers studied. Inulin promoted changes in gut bacterial populations at the class level (increased Actinobacteria and decreased Clostridia) and order level (decreased Clostridiales) compared with cellulose, with small differences at the species level observed between IPE and cellulose.These data demonstrate a distinctive physiological impact of raising colonic propionate delivery in humans, as improvements in insulin sensitivity promoted by IPE and inulin were accompanied with different effects on the plasma metabolome, gut bacterial populations and markers of systemic inflammation.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Here, the biological function of PvRXLR131 was investigated via heterologous expression. Constitutive expression of PvRXLR131 in Colletotrichum gloeosporioides significantly enhanced its pathogenicity on grapevine leaves. Constitutive expression of PvRXLR131 in Arabidopsis promoted Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 and P. syringae DC3000 (hrcC ) growth as well as suppressed defence-related callose deposition. Transient expression of PvRXLR131 in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves could also suppress different elicitor-triggered cell death and inhibit plant resistance to Phytophthora capsici. Further analysis revealed that PvRXLR131 interacted with host Vitis vinifera BRI1 kinase inhibitor 1 (VvBKI1), and its homologues in N. benthamiana (NbBKI1) and Arabidopsis (AtBKI1). Moreover, bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis revealed that PvRXLR131 interacted with VvBKI1 in the plasma membrane. Deletion assays showed that the C-terminus of PvRXLR131 was responsible for the interaction and mutation assays showed that phosphorylation of a conserved  residue in BKI1s disrupted the interaction. BKI1 was a receptor inhibitor of growth- and defence-related brassinosteroid (BR) and ERECTA (ER) signalling. When silencing of NbBKI1 in N. benthamiana, the virulence function of PvRXLR131 was eliminated, demonstrating that the effector activity is mediated by BKI1. Moreover, PvRXLR131-transgenic plants displayed BKI1-overexpression dwarf phenotypes and suppressed BR and ER signalling. These physiological and genetic data clearly demonstrate that BKI1 is a virulence target of PvRXLR131. We propose that P. viticola secretes PvRXLR131 to target BKI1 as a strategy for promoting infection.© 2019 The Authors.

In the current study, we unravel a previously unappreciated role of nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIA (NMHC-IIA) as a negative regulator in inflammatory responses. We identified that cell surface NMHC-IIA recognized sialic acids on sialylated RNA viruses during early infections and interacted with an immune adaptor DNAX activation protein of 12 kDa (DAP12) to recruit downstream spleen  kinase (Syk), leading to suppressed virus-triggered proinflammatory responses. More importantly, recognition of sialylated RNA viruses or sialic acid mimics by NMHC-IIA was shown to inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced proinflammatory responses via the DAP12-Syk pathway. These findings uncover a novel negative regulation mechanism of proinflammatory responses and provide a molecular basis to design anti-inflammatory drugs. NMHC-IIA, a subunit of nonmuscle myosin IIA (NM-IIA), takes part in diverse physiological processes, including cell movement, cell shape maintenance, and signal transduction. Recently, NMHC-IIA has been demonstrated to be a receptor or factor contributing to viral infections. Here, we identified that NMHC-IIA recognizes sialic acids on sialylated RNA viruses, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). Upon recognition, NMHC-IIA associates with the transmembrane region of DAP12 to recruit Syk. Activation of the DAP12-Syk pathway impairs the host antiviral proinflammatory cytokine production and signaling cascades. More importantly, sialic acid mimics and sialylated RNA viruses enable the antagonism of LPS-triggered proinflammatory responses through engaging the NMHC-IIA-DAP12-Syk pathway. These results actually support that NMHC-IIA is involved in negative modulation of the host innate immune system, which provides a molecular basis for prevention and control of the sialylated RNA viruses and treatment of inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2019 Liu et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021409>Immunohistochemical analysis of the mouse celiac ganglion: An integrative relay station of the peripheral nervous system.</a></h2><p>Celiac ganglia are important sites of signal integration and transduction. Their complex neurochemical anatomy has been studied extensively in guinea pigs but not in mice. The goal of this study was to provide detailed neurochemical characterization of mouse celiac ganglia and noradrenergic nerves in two target tissues, spleen and stomach. A vast majority of mouse celiac neurons express a noradrenergic phenotype, which includes  hydroxylase (TH), vesicular monoamine transporter 2, and the norepinephrine transporter. Over 80% of these neuron also express neuropeptide Y (NPY), and this coexpression is maintained by dissociated neurons in culture. Likewise, TH and NPY were colocalized in noradrenergic nerves throughout the spleen and in stomach blood vessels. Somatostatin was not detected in principal neurons but did occur in small, TH-negative cells presumed to be interneurons and in a few varicose nerve fibers. Cholinergic nerves provided the most abundant input to the ganglia, and small percentages of these also contained nitric oxide synthase or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. A low-to-moderate density of nerves also stained separately for the latter markers. Additionally, nerve bundles and varicose nerve fibers containing the sensory neuropeptides, calcitonin gene-related polypeptide, and substance P, occurred at variable density throughout the ganglia. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that principal neurons of mouse celiac ganglia have less neurochemical diversity than reported for guinea pig and other species but receive input from nerves expressing an array of neurochemical markers. This profile suggests celiac neurons integrate input from many sources to influence target tissues by releasing primarily norepinephrine and NPY.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30773771>Variation and inheritance of the Xanthomonas raxX-raxSTAB gene cluster required for activation of XA21-mediated .</a></h2><p>The rice XA21-mediated immune response is activated on recognition of the RaxX peptide produced by the bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). The 60-residue RaxX precursor is post-translationally modified to form a sulfated  peptide that shares sequence and functional similarity with the plant sulfated  (PSY) peptide hormones. The 5-kb raxX-raxSTAB gene cluster of Xoo encodes RaxX, the RaxST tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase, and the RaxA and RaxB components of a predicted type I secretion system. To assess raxX-raxSTAB gene cluster evolution and to determine its phylogenetic distribution, we first identified rax gene homologues in other genomes. We detected the complete raxX-raxSTAB gene cluster only in Xanthomonas spp., in five distinct lineages in addition to X. oryzae. The phylogenetic distribution of the raxX-raxSTAB gene cluster is consistent with the occurrence of multiple lateral (horizontal) gene transfer events during Xanthomonas speciation. RaxX natural variants contain a restricted set of missense substitutions, as expected if selection acts to maintain peptide hormone-like function. Indeed, eight RaxX variants tested all failed to activate the XA21-mediated immune response, yet retained peptide hormone activity. Together, these observations support the hypothesis that the XA21 receptor evolved specifically to recognize Xoo RaxX.© 2019 The Authors.

These receptors contain immunoreceptor -based inhibition motifs (ITIMs) in the cytoplasmic region. Although many of the inhibitory co-receptors negatively regulate BCR signaling by activating SH2-containing protein  phosphatase 1 (SHP-1), different inhibitory co-receptors have distinct functional properties. CD22, Siglec-G, and CD72 preferentially regulate tonic signaling in conventional B cells, B-1 cell homeostasis, and development of lupus-like disease, respectively. CD72 recognizes RNA-related lupus self-antigen Sm/RNP as a ligand. This ligand recognition recruits CD72 to BCR in Sm/RNP-reactive B cells thereby suppressing production of anti-Sm/RNP autoantibody involved in the pathogenesis of lupus. In contrast, Siglec-G recognizes α2,3 as well as α2,6 sialic acids whereas CD22 recognizes α2,6 sialic acid alone. Because glycoproteins including BCR are dominantly glycosylated with α2,3 sialic acids in B-1 cells, Siglec-G but not CD22 recruits BCR as a ligand specifically in B-1 cells, and regulates B-1 cell homeostasis by suppressing BCR signaling in B-1 cells. Thus, recognition of distinct ligands determines functional properties of different inhibitory B cell co-receptors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30936146>T-Cell-Specific PTPN2 Deficiency in NOD Mice Accelerates the Development of Type 1 Diabetes and Autoimmune Comorbidities.</a></h2><p>Genome-wide association studies have identified  as an important non-MHC gene for autoimmunity. Single nucleotide polymorphisms that reduce  expression have been linked with the development of various autoimmune disorders, including type 1 diabetes. The  phosphatase PTPN2 attenuates T-cell receptor and cytokine signaling in T cells to maintain peripheral tolerance, but the extent to which PTPN2 deficiency in T cells might influence type 1 diabetes onset remains unclear. NOD mice develop spontaneous autoimmune type 1 diabetes similar to that seen in humans. In this study, T-cell PTPN2 deficiency in NOD mice markedly accelerated the onset and increased the incidence of type 1 diabetes as well as that of other disorders, including colitis and Sjögren syndrome. Although PTPN2 deficiency in CD8 T cells alone was able to drive the destruction of pancreatic β-cells and the onset of diabetes, T-cell-specific PTPN2 deficiency was also accompanied by increased CD4 T-helper type 1 differentiation and T-follicular-helper cell polarization and increased the abundance of B cells in pancreatic islets as seen in human type 1 diabetes. These findings causally link PTPN2 deficiency in T cells with the development of type 1 diabetes and associated autoimmune comorbidities.© 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30518232>M2 Polarization by Baicalin Enhances Efferocytosis via Upregulation of MERTK Receptor.</a></h2><p>Baicalin is the main active ingredient primary isolated from the Chinese herb, Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi. Although baicalin can induce M2 macrophage polarization, we still do not know the subtype of macrophages polarized by baicalin. In this study, we characterized that murine bone marrow derived macrophages induced by M-CSF can be further polarized into M2 phenotype by baicalin. The signatures of M2 macrophages for mRNA expression like interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), interleukin-10 (IL-10), MERTK and PTX3 were up-regulated. Moreover, we observed the concomitantly decreasing of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-  ), interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5), IL-6. In contrast, M2 macrophages polarized by IL-4 increased gene transcript of arginase-1 (Arg-1) and surface marker of CD206 indicates that their identity as M2 rather than M2 subtypes. Interestingly, the phagocytosis as well as efferocytosis activity were significantly enhanced in M2 macrophage polarized by baicalin and these capacities were associated with the expression of MERTK receptor. Finally, we conclude that baicalin induced M2 macrophages polarization with both elevations of efferocytosis and anti-inflammatory activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062694>Pulmonary artery denervation using catheter-based ultrasonic energy.</a></h2><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a devastating disease characterised by pulmonary vascular remodelling and right heart failure. Radio-frequency pulmonary artery denervation (PDN) has improved pulmonary haemodynamics in preclinical and early clinical studies; however, denervation depth is limited. High-frequency non-focused ultrasound can deliver energy to the vessel adventitia, sparing the intima and media. We therefore aimed to investigate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of ultrasound PDN.Histological examination demonstrated that innervation of human pulmonary arteries is predominantly sympathetic (71%), with >40% of nerves at a depth of >4 mm. Finite element analysis of ultrasound energy distribution and ex vivo studies demonstrated generation of temperatures >47ºC to a depth of 10 mm. In domestic swine, PDN reduced mean pulmonary artery pressure induced by thromboxane A2 in comparison to sham. No adverse events were observed up to 95 days. Histological examination identified structural and immunohistological changes of nerves in PDN-treated animals, with sparing of the intima and media and reduced  hydroxylase staining 95 days post procedure, indicating persistent alteration of the structure of sympathetic nerves.Ultrasound PDN is safe and effective in the preclinical setting, with energy delivery to a depth that would permit targeting sympathetic nerves in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30382432>MEG3 modulates TIGIT expression and CD4 + T cell activation through absorbing miR-23a.</a></h2><p>T cells are involved in bone marrow failure in aplastic anemia (AA). MEG3 is a long, non-coding RNA that can modulate target gene expression and T cell differentiation by acting as a microRNA sponge. Our previous study showed that T cell immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor -based inhibition motif (ITIM) domain (TIGIT) plays a critical role in regulating CD4 + T cell functions. In this study, we found that MEG3 expression was significantly downregulated in CD4 + T cells derived from AA patients. MEG3 modulated CD4 + T cell proliferation and IFN-γ and TNF-α levels, as well as TIGIT, T-bet, and orphan nuclear receptor (RORγt) expression. Furthermore, MEG3 overexpression sequestered miR-23a and prompted TIGIT expression in CD4 + T cells. CD4 + T cells with MEG3 overexpression impeded expansion of Th1 and Th17 cells, restored the decreased red blood cell count, attenuated the increase in serum INF-γ and TNF-α levels, and lengthened median survival time, as well as upregulated mRNA levels of CD34, stem cell factor (SCF), and granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in bone marrow mononuclear cells of a mouse model.

Prominent among these are the specialized CD1dCD5 regulatory B (B) cells that exert a pro-tumorigenic role by promoting tumor cell proliferation. Dissecting the molecular pathways regulating this immune sub-population can thus be valuable for uncovering potential therapeutic targets. Here, we investigate Bruton's  kinase (BTK), a key B-cell kinase, as a potential regulator of CD1dCD5 B differentiation in the pancreatic tumor microenvironment. Treatment of cytokine-induced B cells in vitro with the high specificity BTK inhibitor Tirabrutinib inhibited CD1dCD5 B differentiation and production of IL-10 and IL-35, essential mediators of B immunosuppressive functions. The BTK signaling pathway was also found to be active in vivo in PanIN-associated regulatory B cells. Tirabrutinib treatment of mice bearing orthotopic Kras-pancreatic lesions severely compromised stromal accumulation of the CD1dCD5 B population. This was accompanied by an increase in stromal CD8IFNγ cytotoxic T cells and significant attenuation of tumor cell proliferation and PanIN growth.

The regulation and activation of Bruton's  kinase (Btk) is known as a pivotal step of B cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling in TI humoral , as observed in patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) experiencing a high incidence of encapsulated bacterial infections. However, key questions remain as to whether a well-established canonical BCR signaling pathway is sufficient to regulate the activity of Btk. Here, we find that inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP) acts as a physiological regulator of Btk in BCR signaling. Absence of higher order inositol phosphates (InsPs), inositol polyphosphates, leads to an inability to mount immune response against TI antigens. Interestingly, the significance of InsP-mediated Btk regulation is more prominent in IgM plasma cells.

However, given the widespread expression of this kinase and its reported interactions with numerous other proteins, it is possible that RIP2 may also function in roles outside of peptidoglycan sensing. In this work, we show that RIP2 undergoes  phosphorylation and activation in response to engagement of the Fc γ receptor (FcγR). Using bone marrow-derived macrophages from WT and RIP2-KO mice, we show that loss of RIP2 leads to deficient FcγR signaling and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production upon FcγR cross-linking without affecting cytokine secretion, phagocytosis, or nitrate/nitrite production. The FcγR-induced ROS response was still dependent on NOD2, as macrophages deficient in this receptor showed similar defects. Mechanistically, we found that different members of the Src family kinases (SFKs) can promote RIP2  phosphorylation and activation. Altogether, our findings suggest that RIP2 is functionally important in pathways outside of bacterial peptidoglycan sensing and that involvement in such pathways may depend on the actions of SFKs. These findings will have important implications for future therapies designed to target this kinase.© 2019 Shehat et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31501515>Loss of PTPN22 abrogates the beneficial effect of cohousing-mediated fecal microbiota transfer in murine colitis.</a></h2><p>Fecal microbiota transfer (FMT) is a very efficient approach for the treatment of severe and recurring C. difficile infections. However, the beneficial effect of FMT in other disorders such as ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease remains unclear. Furthermore, it is currently unknown how disease-associated genetic variants in donors or recipients influence the effect of FMT. We found that bacteria-transfer from wild-type (WT) donors via cohousing was efficient in inducing recovery from colitis in WT mice, but not in mice deficient in protein- phosphatase non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22), a known risk gene for several chronic inflammatory diseases. Also cohousing of PTPN22-deficient mice with diseased WT mice failed to induce faster recovery. Our data indicate that the genetic background of the donor and the recipient influences the outcome of microbiota transfer, and offers a potential explanation why transfer of fecal microbes from some, but not all donors is efficient in UC patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31332347>HER2 recruits AKT1 to disrupt STING signalling and suppress antiviral defence and antitumour .</a></h2><p>Sensing cytosolic DNA through the cGAS-STING pathway constitutes a widespread innate immune mechanism to monitor cellular damage and microbial invasion. Evading this surveillance is crucial in tumorigenesis, but the process remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that the receptor  kinase HER2 (also known as ErbB-2 or Neu) potently inhibits cGAS-STING signalling and prevents cancer cells from producing cytokines, entering senescence and undergoing apoptosis. HER2, but not EGFR, associates strongly with STING and recruits AKT1 (also known as PKB) to directly phosphorylate TBK1, which prevents the TBK1-STING association and TBK1 K63-linked ubiquitination, thus attenuating STING signalling. Unexpectedly, we observed that DNA sensing robustly activates the HER2-AKT1 axis, resulting in negative feedback. Accordingly, genetic or pharmacological targeting of the HER2-AKT1 cascade augments damage-induced cellular senescence and apoptosis, and enhances STING-mediated antiviral and antitumour . Thus, our findings reveal a critical function of the oncogenic pathway in innate immune regulation and unexpectedly connect HER2-AKT1 signalling to the surveillance of cellular damage and antitumour .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31333677> Dephosphorylation of ASC Modulates the Activation of the NLRP3 and AIM2 Inflammasomes.</a></h2><p>The inflammasome is an intracellular multi-protein complex that orchestrates the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, and a form of cell death known as pyroptosis.  phosphorylation of the inflammasome sensors NLRP3, AIM2, NLRC4, and the adaptor protein, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC) has previously been demonstrated to be essential in the regulation of the inflammasome. By using the pharmacological protein  phosphatase (PTPase) inhibitor, phenylarsine oxide (PAO), we have demonstrated that  dephosphorylation is an essential step for the activation of the NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes in human and murine macrophages. We have also shown that PTPase activity is required for ASC nucleation leading to caspase-1 activation, IL-1β, and IL-18 processing and release, and cell death. Furthermore, by site-directed mutagenesis of ASC  residues, we have identified the phosphorylation of  Y60 and Y137 of ASC as critical for inflammasome assembly and function. Therefore, we report that ASC  dephosphorylation and phosphorylation are crucial events for inflammasome activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31289116>Sensing of apoptotic cells through Axl causes lung basal cell proliferation in inflammatory diseases.</a></h2><p>Epithelial cell proliferation, division, and differentiation are critical for barrier repair following inflammation, but the initial trigger for this process is unknown. Here we define that sensing of apoptotic cells by the TAM receptor  kinase Axl is a critical indicator for tracheal basal cell expansion, cell cycle reentry, and symmetrical cell division. Furthermore, once the pool of tracheal basal cells has expanded, silencing of Axl is required for their differentiation. Genetic depletion of Axl triggers asymmetrical cell division, leading to epithelial differentiation and ciliated cell regeneration. This discovery has implications for conditions associated with epithelial barrier dysfunction, basal cell hyperplasia, and continued turnover of dying cells in patients with chronic inflammatory pulmonary diseases.© 2019 Fujino et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573679>Histone acetyltransferase CBP is critical for conventional effector and memory T-cell differentiation in mice.</a></h2><p>Compared with naïve T cells, memory CD8 T cells have a transcriptional landscape and proteome that are optimized to generate a more rapid and robust response to secondary infection. Additionally, rewired kinase signal transduction pathways likely contribute to the superior recall response of memory CD8 T cells, but this idea has not been experimentally confirmed. Herein, we utilized an MS approach to identify proteins that are phosphorylated on  residues in response to -induced T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation in both naïve and memory CD8 T cells from mice and separated by fluorescence- and flow cytometry-based cell sorting. This analysis identified substantial differences in  kinase signaling networks between naïve and memory CD8 T cells. We also observed that an important axis in memory CD8 T cells couples Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) hyperactivation to the phosphorylation of CREB-binding protein (CBP). Functionally, JAK2-catalyzed phosphorylation enabled CBP to bind with higher affinity to acetylated histone peptides, indicating a potential epigenetic mechanism that could contribute to rapid initiation of transcriptional programs in memory CD8 T cells. Moreover, we found that CBP itself is essential for conventional effector and memory CD8 T-cell formation. These results indicate how signaling pathways are altered to promote CD8 memory cell formation and rapid responses to and protection from repeat infections.© 2019 Piccirillo et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31185757>Disturbed Transcription of TLRs' Negative Regulators and Cytokines Secretion among TLR4- and 9-Activated PBMCs of Agammaglobulinemic Patients.</a></h2><p>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are inevitable elements for  development and antibody production. TLRs are in close interaction with Bruton's  kinase which has been found mutated and malfunctioned in the prototype antibody deficiency disease named X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). TLRs' ability was evaluated to induce transcription of TLR-negative regulators, including suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 3 (IRAK-M), tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3, A20), and Ring finger protein 216 (RNF216), and Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and Interferon-α (IFN-α) production via Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and CpG-A oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-A ODN). Measured by TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), meaningfully increased transcripts of SOCS1 and RNF216 were found in XLA peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Also, TLR inductions of XLA have led to similar downregulations in the regulator's transcription which was different from that in healthy donors. Cytokine measurement by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) revealed a significant lower TNF-α production both before and after LPS. By selected molecules in this study, TLRs' potential defectiveness range expands TLRs expression, downstream signaling, and cytokine production. The results show new potential elements that could play a part in TLRs defect and pathogenesis of agammaglobulinemia as well.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30931941>Integrin activation by the lipid molecule 25-hydroxycholesterol induces a proinflammatory response.</a></h2><p>Integrins are components of cell-matrix adhesions, and function as scaffolds for various signal transduction pathways. So far no lipid ligand for integrin has been reported. Here we show that a lipid, oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), directly binds to α5β1 and αvβ3 integrins to activate integrin-focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling. Treatment of macrophages and epithelial cells with 25HC results in an increase in activated αvβ3 integrin in podosome and focal adhesion matrix adhesion sites. Moreover, activation of pattern recognition receptor on macrophages induces secretion of 25HC, triggering integrin signaling and the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-6. Thus, the lipid molecule 25HC is a physiologically relevant activator of integrins and is involved in positively regulating proinflammatory responses. Our data suggest that extracellular 25HC links innate immune inflammatory response with integrin signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811474>Lenvatinib plus anti-PD-1 antibody combination treatment activates CD8+ T cells through reduction of tumor-associated macrophage and activation of the interferon pathway.</a></h2><p>Lenvatinib is a multiple receptor  kinase inhibitor targeting mainly vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors. We investigated the immunomodulatory activities of lenvatinib in the tumor microenvironment and its mechanisms of enhanced antitumor activity when combined with a programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) blockade. Antitumor activity was examined in immunodeficient and immunocompetent mouse tumor models. Single-cell analysis, flow cytometric analysis, and immunohistochemistry were used to analyze immune cell populations and their activation. Gene co-expression network analysis and pathway analysis using RNA sequencing data were used to identify lenvatinib-driven combined activity with anti-PD-1 antibody (anti-PD-1). Lenvatinib showed potent antitumor activity in the immunocompetent tumor microenvironment compared with the immunodeficient tumor microenvironment. Antitumor activity of lenvatinib plus anti-PD-1 was greater than that of either single treatment. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that lenvatinib reduced tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and increased the percentage of activated CD8+ T cells secreting interferon (IFN)-γ+ and granzyme B (GzmB). Combination treatment further increased the percentage of T cells, especially CD8+ T cells, among CD45+ cells and increased IFN-γ+ and GzmB+ CD8+ T cells. Transcriptome analyses of tumors resected from treated mice showed that genes specifically regulated by the combination were significantly enriched for type-I IFN signaling. Pretreatment with lenvatinib followed by anti-PD-1 treatment induced significant antitumor activity compared with anti-PD-1 treatment alone. Our findings show that lenvatinib modulates cancer  in the tumor microenvironment by reducing TAMs and, when combined with PD-1 blockade, shows enhanced antitumor activity via the IFN signaling pathway. These findings provide a scientific rationale for combination therapy of lenvatinib with PD-1 blockade to improve cancer immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30765061>Resistant silkworm strain block viral infection independent of melanization.</a></h2><p>Melanization mediated by the prophenoloxidase-activating system (proPO) is an important immune response in invertebrates. However, the role of melanization on viral infection has not been wildly revealed in Bombyx mori (B. mori), silkworm. Here, we investigated the extent of melanization of susceptible (871) and resistant (near-isogenic line 871C) B. mori strains. The result showed that the extent of melanization was significantly higher in the susceptible strain than in the resistant strain. A majority of Serpins were up-regulated in the resistant strain through iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics, comparing with susceptible strain. Our data further identified that Serpin-5, Serpin-9 and Serpin-19 reduced PO activity, indicating that the menlanization pathway was inhibited in the resistant strain. Moreover, our results indicated that the hemolymph of 871 reduced viral infection in the presence of PTU, indicating that melanization of 871 strain hemolymph blocked viral infection. However, viral infection was significantly suppressed in the hemolymph of 871C strain regardless of the presence of PTU or not, which implied that the resistant strain inhibited viral infection independent of the melanization pathway. Taken together, our findings indicated that the melanization pathway was inhibited in resistant strain. These results expend the analysis of melanization pathway in insects and provide insights into understanding the antiviral mechanism.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In the study, the vaccination with cancer stem cells (CSCs) with high expression of the type I receptor  kinase-like orphan receptor (ROR1) was evaluated in a murine model for the vaccine's immunogenicity and protective efficacy against epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC). CD117CD44 CSCs were isolated from human EOC HO8910 cell line using a magnetic-activated cell sorting system; murine ID8 EOC suspension sphere cells, which are collectively known as cancer stem-like cells, were acquired from serum-free suspension sphere-forming culture. Mice were subcutaneously immunized with the repeat cycles of freezing and thawing whole HO8910 CD117CD44 CSCs and ID8 cancer stem-like cells, respectively, followed by a challenge with HO8910 or ID8 cells at one week after final vaccination. The results showed that the CSC vaccination significantly induced  against EOC growth and markedly prolonged the survival of EOC-bearing mice in the prophylactic setting compared with non-CSC vaccination. Flow cytometry showed significantly increased immunocyte cytotoxicities and remarkably reduced CSC counts in the CSC-vaccinated mice. Moreover, the protective efficacy against EOC was decreased when the ROR1 expression was downregulated by shRNA in CSC vaccines. The findings from the study suggest that CSC vaccines with high ROR1 expression were highly effective in triggering  against EOC in vaccinated mice and may serve as an effective vaccine for EOC immunoprophylaxis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30964564>Myeloid C-type lectin receptors in skin/mucoepithelial diseases and tumors.</a></h2><p>Myeloid C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), which consist of an extracellular carbohydrate recognition domain and intracellular signal transducing motif such as the immunoreceptor -based activation motif (ITAM) or immunoreceptor -based inhibitory motif (ITIM), are innate immune receptors primarily expressed on myeloid lineage cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) and Mϕs. CLRs play important roles in host defense against infection by fungi and bacteria by recognizing specific carbohydrate components of these pathogens. However, these immune receptors also make important contributions to immune homeostasis of mucosa and skin in mammals by recognizing components of microbiota, as well as by recognizing self-components such as alarmins from dead cells and noncanonical non-carbohydrate ligands. CLR deficiency not only induces hypersensitivity to infection, but also causes dysregulation of muco-cutaneous immune homeostasis, resulting in the development of allergy, inflammation, autoimmunity, and tumors. In this review, we introduce recent discoveries regarding the roles of myeloid CLRs in the immune system exposed to the environment, and discuss the roles of these lectin receptors in the development of colitis, asthma, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and cancer. Although some CLRs are suggested to be involved in the development of these diseases, the function of CLRs and their ligands still largely remain to be elucidated.©2019 The Authors.

Drugs inhibiting B-cell-receptor (BCR)-associated kinases, including BTK inhibitors, act on B cells and on a wide spectrum of tissues and cells, including innate  cells. Thus, alterations in the Bruton's  kinase (BTK) kinase function could lead to an impairment of innate immune cells functions and to an increased infectious risk in patients receiving BTK inhibitors. We analyzed in vivo neutrophils oxidative burst, neutrophils granules release and cytokine production in relapsed/refractory CLL patients treated over time with ibrutinib as single-agent. We observed a dramatic reduction of neutrophils oxidative burst, Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs)-mediated degranulation and IL-8 plasma levels already after the first forty-eight hours of therapy with ibrutinib. However, ibrutinib treatment did not alter the surface expression of CD11b nor cytokine and proteinases release not mediated by FcγRs engagement. After three weeks, oxidative burst was still impaired, while degranulation and IL-8 levels were restored. In a group of CLL patients who survived for more than three years, all processes triggered by FcγRs completely recovered except the release of neutrophil elastase (NE) and IL-8. In conclusion, during the initial phases of ibrutinib therapy, the reduction of IL-8, NE, myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels and oxidative burst negatively impacted on mechanisms involved in neutrophils microbicidal activity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, Lyn from Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) (OnLyn) was identified and characterized at expression pattern against bacterial infection, and regulation function in BCR signaling. The open reading frame of OnLyn contained 1536 bp of nucleotide sequence encoded a protein of 511 amino acids. The OnLyn protein was highly conversed to other species Lyn, including SH3, SH2 and a catalytic Tyr kinase (TyrKc) domain. Transcriptional expression analysis revealed that OnLyn was detected in all examined tissues and was highly expressed in the head kidney. The up-regulation OnLyn expression was observed in the head kidney and spleen following challenge with Streptococcus agalactiae (S. agalactiae) in vivo, and was also displayed in head kidney leukocytes challenge with S. agalactiae and LPS in vitro. In addition, after induction with mouse anti-OnIgM mAb in vitro, the OnLyn expression and phosphorylation of OnLyn (Y) were significantly up-regulated in the head kidney leukocytes. Moreover, after treatment with AZD0530 and mouse anti-OnIgM monoclonal antibody, the down-regulation of cytoplasmic free-Ca concentration was detected in the head kidney leukocytes in vitro. Taken together, the findings of this study revealed that OnLyn might play potential roles in BCR signaling and get involved in host defense against bacterial infection in Nile tilapia.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The growth arrest-specific protein 6 (Gas6) and its  receptor Mer have been implicated to involve in the regulation of inflammation, innate  and tissue repair. However, the role of Gas6 or Mer in silica-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis has not been investigated previously. In this study, we observed a remarkable increase of Gas6 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from wild-type C57BL/6 mice after silica intratracheal administration. Then, we investigated whether genetic loss of Gas6 or Mer could attenuate silica-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis. Our results showed that Gas6 and Mer mice exhibited reduced lung inflammation response from days 7 to 84 after silica exposure. We also uncovered an overexpression of the suppressor of cytokine signaling protein 1 in silica-treated deficient mice. Moreover, Gas6 or Mer deficiency attenuated silica-induced collagen deposition by inhibiting the expression of transforming growth factor-β. We conclude that gene absence of Gas6 or Mer is protective against silica-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis in mice. Targeting Gas6/Mer pathway may be a potential therapeutic approach to treat pulmonary fibrosis in patients with silicosis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Among the four members, JAK3 is probably the more attractive target for treatment of inflammatory diseases because its inhibition demonstrates the greatest immunosuppression and most profound effect in the treatment of such disorders. Although many JAK3 inhibitors are already available, certain shortcomings have been identified, mostly acquired drug resistance or unwanted side effects. To discover and identify new promising lead candidates, in this study, the structure of JAK3 (3LXK) was obtained from the Protein Data Bank and used for simulation modeling and protein-ligand interaction analysis. The ~36,000 Chinese herbal compounds obtained from TCM Database@Taiwan were virtually screened by AutoDock Vina docking program and filtered with Lipinski's Rules and ADME/T virtual predictions. Because of high occurrence of fake hits during docking, we selected 12 phytochemicals which have demonstrated modulating JAKs expressions among the top 50 chemicals from docking results. To validate whether these compounds are able to directly mediate JAK3 kinase, we have investigated the inhibitory activity using enzymatic activity assays, western blot, and HEK 293 cell STAT5 transactivity assays. The molecular analysis included docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in order to investigate structural conformations and to explore the key amino acids in the interaction between JAK3 kinase and its putative ligands. The results demonstrated that Cryptotanshinone, Icaritin, and Indirubin exhibited substantial inhibitory activity against JAK3 kinase . The results also provide binding models of the protein-ligand interaction, detailing the interacting amino acid residues at the active ATP-binding domains of JAK3 kinase.

Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that Gas6/PS-mediated activation of TAM receptors on tumor cells leads to subsequent upregulation of PD-L1, defining a putative PS→TAM receptor→PD-L1 inhibitory signaling axis in the cancer microenvironment that may promote tolerance. In this study, we tested combinations of TAM inhibitors and PD-1 mAbs in a syngeneic orthotopic E0771 murine triple-negative breast cancer model, whereby tumor-bearing mice were treated with pan-TAM kinase inhibitor (BMS-777607) or anti-PD-1 alone or in combination. Tyro3, Axl, and Mertk were differentially expressed on multiple cell subtypes in the tumor microenvironment. Although monotherapeutic administration of either pan-TAM kinase inhibitor (BMS-777607) or anti-PD-1 mAb therapy showed partial antitumor activity, combined treatment of BMS-777607 with anti-PD-1 significantly decreased tumor growth and incidence of lung metastasis. Moreover, combined treatment with BMS-777607 and anti-PD-1 showed increased infiltration of immune stimulatory T cells versus either monotherapy treatment alone. RNA NanoString profiling showed enhanced infiltration of antitumor effector T cells and a skewed immunogenic immune profile. Proinflammatory cytokines increased with combinational treatment. Together, these studies indicate that pan-TAM inhibitor BMS-777607 cooperates with anti-PD-1 in a syngeneic mouse model for triple-negative breast cancer and highlights the clinical potential for this combined therapy.

Drugs that target epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations (eg, gefitinib, erlotinib, icotinib, and osimertinib) are among the most commonly used targeted therapies. Afatinib is an irreversible second-generation EGFR- kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), and the LUX-Lung 3 trial demonstrated the superiority of afatinib to cisplatin and pemetrexed in the frontline treatment of treatment-naïve patients with advanced EGFR mutation adenocarcinoma of the lung. Although these drugs show significant therapeutic efficacy, most patients invariably experience disease progression resulting in death. Immunotherapy targeting programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) has now been approved for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC. These can produce sustained clinical responses by reversing negative regulators of T-cell function; however, immunotherapy response rates remain low, and only a few patients ultimately benefit from this approach.
